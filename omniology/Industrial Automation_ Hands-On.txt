Preface
T
his book is meant to serve as an outline for automation and 
industrial machinery concepts and terminology. It is suitable 
as a guidebook for newcomers to the field of automation 
as well as a reference for the seasoned automation professional. 
The book emphasizes control systems, but many other subjects—
including machine building, mechanical engineering and devices, 
manufacturing business systems, and job functions in an industrial 
environment—are also covered extensively.
I began my career in the U.S. Air Force as an electronics instructor 
and engineering/installation technician. The military requires its 
members to follow detailed instructions and document work activities 
and procedures accurately—a requirement that equipped me with 
the tools and discipline necessary to pursue a career in engineering. I 
learned the fundamental elements of electronics and electricity from 
a practical, hands-on perspective—tracing signal flow through 
schematics and using specialized tools such as soldering irons and 
wire-wrap guns to install and repair components. I also learned to 
develop, follow, and present lesson plans in a military classroom. 
During my service in the military, I was fortunate enough to be able 
to travel internationally and experience other cultures and methods 
of accomplishing things.
After eight years in the military, I started college as a 30-year-old 
freshman. My math and science background was not particularly 
strong, so I was forced to play catch-up to keep up with my student 
peers who came out of high schools and junior colleges with some 
calculus and physics experience. Fortunately my military background 
gave me the self-discipline to study these prerequisites independently, 
and I began to learn the core subjects of engineering. I attended a 
large state university with a highly regarded engineering department 
and numerous top-notch professors. Although all engineering 
students were required to complete mechanical and industrial 
engineering courses, my interest and concentration was in the controls 
field of electrical engineering. To supplement my controls classes, 
xiii

P r e f a c e
I also studied power and digital electronics, plasma, communications, 
drafting/CAD, thermodynamics, semiconductor theory, and various 
computer programming classes in addition to an assortment of liberal 
arts and general courses. This curriculum provided a well-rounded 
and complete engineering education intended to ready me for entry 
into the workforce.
After finishing college and obtaining a degree in electrical and 
computer engineering, I discovered that there was a gap in my 
education from a practical standpoint. Industrial automation is tricky. 
The theoretical requirements are great, but the practical knowledge 
necessary is even greater. The traditional ways of teaching automation 
simply don’t transfer the practical knowledge you obtain after years 
of experience. Sure, you can learn a lot of mathematical and scientific 
concepts that will give you an excellent theoretical understanding of 
the field, but they fail to provide the necessary practical knowledge 
that normally comes from years of trial and error. This book is 
intended to fill some of these “experience gaps.”
My automation background has been primarily in machine 
building and systems integration. Before starting my own custom 
systems integration and machine-building company, I worked for 
two controls and electrical component distributers and learned the 
value of manufacturers’ catalogs and training classes. Much of the 
information contained in this book is gleaned from catalogs that 
provide specifications of equipment for systems. Prior to the 
emergence of the Internet as a widespread and accessible resource, 
most of the technical data for components had to be obtained from 
specification sheets and physical catalogs. Classes and seminars 
presented by manufacturers were—and still are—excellent resources 
for hands-on training using actual hardware.
After operating a small machine-building and systems integration 
company for 10 years, I went to work for a large custom machine 
builder. This provided me with insight about how major corporations 
and engineering firms bid out and procure large integrated turnkey 
production lines and systems and how teams of engineers work 
together on extremely complex systems to produce integrated 
production lines. The many valuable tools and templates I used in 
my position at Wright Industries were instrumental in my ability to 
design systems in a coordinated and organized way. I will always be 
grateful to Wright Industries and the Doerfer Companies for the 
experiences and training I received during my tenure there, as well as 
the ability to play with large-scale and expensive “toys.”
While working within this much larger organization, I was often 
asked how things worked or what the best technique might be to 
accomplish a particular task. I also had questions myself on areas 
outside my expertise. As these important questions were answered, 
I began collecting information with the primary aim of starting a 
general guidebook for these often-asked questions in the field of 

P r e f a c e  
xv
automation. I also started a blog, www.automationprimer.com, and 
began posting subjects of interest to the automation community. This 
allowed me to refine some of the subjects and begin organizing the 
content of this book. It also allowed me to cross-link with several 
other automation bloggers and gain valuable contacts in the industry.
During this period I also obtained my Six Sigma Green Belt 
certification. My interest in lean manufacturing and the business 
aspect of the automation and manufacturing industries grew, and 
I began adding more business-related content to the book. I left 
Wright Industries in 2011 and restarted my automation company 
with more of a focus on the education and consulting aspect of 
industrial automation rather than machine design and programming.
One of the major purposes of this book is to serve as a single-
point resource for those involved in the design and use of automated 
machinery. I used many of the charts and tables in this book as 
design aids when specifying systems during my automation career, 
and I hope they serve as useful quick-reference guides for readers as 
well. There are also many topics that provide general information 
on industry-related subjects that might also be of interest to readers 
who hope to expand their general knowledge of automation-related 
subjects.
The book is laid out in an outline format for easy reference. 
Chapter 1 provides a general overview of manufacturing and 
automation. Chapter 2 introduces many of the concepts used in 
automation, controls, machinery design, and documentation. Chapter 3 
discusses many of the individual hardware components used in the 
automation industry. Chapter 4 links some of these components 
together and describes some of the machinery subsystems that help 
comprise an automated machine or line. Chapter 5 brings these 
subsystems together and exemplifies machinery used in some of 
the different areas of manufacturing. Chapter 6 covers some of the 
different kinds of software used in the programming, design, and 
documentation of industrial machinery and information systems as 
well as business enterprise software. Chapter 7 describes job functions 
in the automation and manufacturing industries, and Chap. 8 covers 
some of the business organization and concepts used in the industrial 
and manufacturing fields. Lean manufacturing and various business 
tools are also discussed there. Chapter 9 covers a hypothetical machine 
procurement, design, and implementation process, while Chap. 10 
contains some examples of automation projects and systems I have 
been involved in during my career. There are also a number of handy 
tables and charts and an index in the back of the book.
Mechanical engineers who want to know more about controls or 
business, electrical engineers and technicians who need more 
information on mechanical concepts and components, and factory 
management employees needing more background on technical 
subjects will find this book helpful. Machine operators hoping to 

xvi 
P r e f a c e
move into the maintenance field and maintenance technicians needing 
more information on engineering techniques will also find subjects of 
interest contained within these pages.
Because the subject matter is broad, covering both technical and 
business aspects of manufacturing and industrial automation, no 
particular subject is covered in great depth. There are thousands of 
excellent resources available in textbooks, catalogs, and online that 
go into much more detail on specific areas of the automation, business, 
and manufacturing fields. I would encourage readers to explore these 
subjects in greater detail and hope that you get as much enjoyment 
out of this fascinating field as I have.
This material has been developed with the assistance of many 
individuals to whom I wish to express my sincere appreciation. To 
my daughter Mariko, who provided extensive editing, proofreading, 
and other book- and picture-related help throughout the entire 
process. To the technical reviewers who made suggestions and 
corrections in their areas of expertise:

CHAPTER 1
Automation and 
Manufacturing
H
uman beings have been making things for many thousands 
of years. Originally most products were made on an 
individual as-needed basis; if a tool was required, it was 
fashioned by hand and in turn used to make more tools. As time 
passed, more complex techniques were developed to help people 
accomplish fabrication and production tasks. Metalworking 
technology, weaving looms, water-driven grinding mills, and the 
development of steam and gasoline engines all contributed to a 
greater ability to make various products, but things were still 
generally made one at a time by craftspeople skilled in various 
techniques. It was only after the Industrial Revolution and common 
use of electrical energy and mechanisms that manufacturing of 
products on a large scale became commonplace.
1.1 Automation
Automation is the use of logical programming commands and 
mechanized equipment to replace the decision making and manual 
command-response activities of human beings. Historically, 
mechanization—such as the use of a timing mechanism to trip a lever 
or ratchet and pawl—aided humans in performing the physical 
requirements of a task. Automation, however, takes mechanization a 
step further, greatly reducing the need for human sensory and mental 
requirements while simultaneously optimizing productivity.
It is believed that the term automation was first coined in the 
1940s by a Ford Motor Company engineer describing various 
systems where automatic actions and controls were substituted for 
human effort and intelligence. At this time, control devices were 
electromechanical in nature. Logic was performed by means of 
relays and timers interlocked with human feedback at decision 
points. By wiring relays, timers, push buttons, and mechanical 
position sensors together, simple logical motion sequences could be 
performed by turning on and off motors and actuators.

C h a p t e r  O n e
With the advent of computers and solid-state devices, these 
control systems became smaller, more flexible, and less expensive to 
implement and modify. The first programmable logic controllers 
were developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Modicon in response to a 
challenge by GM to develop a substitute for hardwired relay logic. As 
technology improved and more automation companies entered the 
market, new control products were developed. Today, myriad 
computerized logic control devices developed by hundreds of 
different manufacturers exist in the industry.
1.1.1 Advantages
A few advantages of automation are:
Human operators performing tasks that involve hard physical 
• 
or monotonous work can be replaced.
Human operators performing tasks in dangerous environments, 
• 
such as those with temperature extremes or radioactive and 
toxic atmospheres, can be replaced.
Tasks that are beyond human capabilities are made easier. 
• 
Handling heavy or large loads, manipulating tiny objects, or 
the requirement to make products very quickly or slowly are 
examples of this.
Production is often faster and labor costs less on a per product 
• 
basis than the equivalent manual operations.
Automation systems can easily incorporate quality checks 
• 
and verifications to reduce the number of out-of-tolerance 
parts being produced while allowing for statistical process 
control that will allow for a more consistent and uniform 
product.
Automation can serve as the catalyst for improvement in the 
• 
economies of enterprises or society. For example, the gross 
national income and standard of living in Germany and Japan 
improved drastically in the 20th century, due in large part to 
embracing automation for the production of weapons, 
automobiles, textiles, and other goods for export.
Automation systems do not call in sick.
• 
1.1.2 Disadvantages
Some disadvantages of automation are:
Current technology is unable to automate all desired tasks. 
• 
Some tasks cannot be easily automated, such as the 
production or assembly of products with inconsistent 
component sizes or in tasks where manual dexterity is 

A u t o m a t i o n  a n d  M a n u f a c t u r i n g  
3
required. There are some things that are best left to human 
assembly and manipulation.
Certain tasks would cost more to automate than to perform 
• 
manually. Automation is typically best suited to processes 
that are repeatable, consistent, and high volume.
The research and development cost of automating a process 
• 
is difficult to predict accurately beforehand. Since this cost 
can have a large impact on profitability, it is possible to finish 
automating a process only to discover that there is no 
economic advantage in doing so. With the advent and 
continued growth of different types of production lines, 
however, more accurate estimates based on previous projects 
can be made.
Initial costs are relatively high. The automation of a new 
• 
process or the construction of a new plant requires a huge 
initial investment compared with the unit cost of the product. 
Even machinery for which the development cost has already 
been recovered is expensive in terms of hardware and labor. 
The cost can be prohibitive for custom production lines where 
product handling and tooling must be developed.
A skilled maintenance department is often required to service 
• 
and maintain the automation system in proper working 
order. Failure to maintain the automation system will 
ultimately result in lost production and/or bad parts being 
produced.
Overall, the advantages would seem to outweigh the disadvantages. 
It can be safely said that countries that have embraced automation 
enjoy a higher standard of living than those that have not. At the 
same time, a concern is often aired that automating tasks takes jobs 
from people that used to build things by hand. Regardless of the 
social implications, there is no doubt that productivity increases with 
the proper application of automation techniques.
1.1.3 The Factory and Manufacturing
A factory, or manufacturing plant, is an industrial building where 
workers produce, assemble, process, or package goods by operating 
and supervising machines and processing lines (Fig. 1.1). Most 
modern factories house innovative machinery used for production, 
gauging, testing, packaging, and a host of other manufacturing-
related operations. From a business perspective, factories serve as the 
central site where labor, capital, and plant are concentrated for the 
development of mass produced, small batch, or specialty goods.
The factory setting proved to be an efficient environment for 
mass production during the Industrial Revolution, when England 
spearheaded a shift from an agrarian-based society to one powered 

4 
C h a p t e r  O n e
by machinery and manufacturing. At this time, factories simply 
served as buildings where laborers gathered to produce goods using 
simple tools and machinery. Advancements in agriculture and 
textile- and metal-manufacturing technologies coupled with cheap 
labor resulted in increased output, efficiency, and profit for factory 
owners.
In the early 20th century, Henry Ford advanced the factory 
concept further with the innovation of mass production in order to 
meet a growing demand for his Model T automobiles. Through a 
combination of the employment of precision manufacturing, the 
division of highly specialized labor, the use of standardized and 
interchangeable parts, and the creation of a continuously rolling, 
precisely timed assembly line, Ford was able to drastically reduce 
assembly time per vehicle and ultimately decrease production costs.
Ford’s model changed the way virtually all goods were 
manufactured in the 20th century and paved the way for the next 
generation of factories to evolve with several improvements.
One such improvement, pioneered by American mathematician 
William Edwards Deming, was the advancement of statistical methods 
of quality control—an innovation he brought overseas, which turned 
Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and 
production quality. The latest advancements in quality control have 
led to the concepts of Six Sigma and lean manufacturing. These 
concepts are covered in depth in the later chapters of this book.
Another improvement to the factory model was the innovation of 
industrial robots, which began appearing on factory floors in the 
1970s. These computer-controlled arms and grippers conducted 
simple tasks but were instrumental in improving speed and cutting 
costs. Primary functions of these high-endurance precision machines 
include welding, painting, pick and place, assembly, inspection, and 
testing.

Manufacturing is the systematic fabrication of goods through the 
use of machines, tools, and labor. Manufacturing of the 21st century 
most commonly applies to industrial production, where large 
quantities of raw materials are transformed into finished products. 
This process usually happens in many stages; a finished product from 
one process becomes one of many components required for another 
process. Those finished products may be sold to end users by way of 
wholesalers or retailers, or they can be used to manufacture other, 
more complex products before they are ultimately sold to consumers. 
Assembly, conversion, packaging, and processing/batching are all 
examples of manufacturing operations.
Figure 1.2 illustrates a simple diagram of production for a typical 
product. Note that for every stage of the production cycle, there are 
many support activities involved that do not directly affect the 
manufacturing process itself. Many of these activities are also 
performed by separate companies and facilities, involving financial 
transactions and product movement between corporations and 
locations.
Most industrial automation occurs within the manufacturing and 
production phase of the product life cycle; however, examples of 
automated functions can be found in many nonindustrial applications. 
As an example, virtually every computer program uses command 
and response automation to operate; the word automation also refers 
to the application of computer processing to a task, an example being 
the term office automation.
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing, is a process of 
making solid objects from a solid model drawing by incrementally 
adding successive layers of material rather than removing them by 
machining, which is a subtractive process. While not currently 
practical for mass production from a time and cost standpoint, it is a 
useful method for making a single object for rapid prototyping.
Methods used in additive manufacturing include extruding 
layers of polymer or metal; laminating layers of foil, paper, or plastic 
film; or using electron beams to selectively fuse granular metals layer

by layer. Related methods of rapid prototyping are stereolithography 
and digital light processing. These methods produce solid parts out 
of a liquid by exposing the liquid to intense light beams, hardening 
the exposed polymer.
Additive manufacturing is a rapidly evolving technology that 
may have a major impact on the future of manufacturing production 
methods.
1.1.4 The Manufacturing Environment
Factories are often thought of as dirty, noisy places with lots of heavy 
equipment; this is not always true. Places like foundries and metal-
processing plants can certainly have these characteristics, requiring 
ear and clothing protection; however, factories can also be immaculate 
and relatively quiet, depending on what is being produced or 
processed.
Most industrial facilities require a minimum of protective 
equipment to be worn while on the factory floor. Safety glasses are 
nearly always required. There is often a box containing extra pairs for 
visitors next to the doors from the office space to the plant. Earplug 
dispensers are also often located in the same area. In food-processing 
plants and clean rooms, hairnets and beard nets, coats, shoe covers, 
and gloves may also be required.
A clean room is an environment where particles of dust or 
contaminants are prevented from entering. Clean rooms are classified 
by the number of particles above certain sizes that may be allowed 
within a volume of air. The ISO standard on clean rooms was 
published in 1999, establishing numbers for classification as shown in 
Table 1.1.
This standard is used as the basis for the European Union 
classifications. In the United States, Federal Standard 209D is used 
to classify clean rooms in a similar way, as shown in Table 1.2. This 
classification defines the number of particles in a cubic foot of air 
rather than a cubic meter.
Federal Standard 209E uses the same criteria as 209D, but it also 
defines classes by cubic meter in addition to cubic foot. Since most 
U.S. facilities still refer to clean room classifications as “class 100,000” 
and below, Standard 209E is not shown here.
Controlled environments are also referred to by grade when 
referring to antiseptic or sterilized conditions. Grades A through D 
are used in conjunction with clean room classes with grade “A” being 
the most restrictive, used in aseptic preparation and filling of sterilized 
products.
Clean rooms are used in manufacture of semiconductor devices, 
computer hard drives, pharmaceuticals, and some food-preparation 
facilities. Additional methods of maintaining clean room quality 
include minimum air volume exchange rates, decontamination, air 
locks, and filtering. Components intended for use in a clean room

environment typically require extra preparation before being 
approved for use. Using low outgassing materials, covering all 
moving parts that might generate debris, using greases that do not 
splatter, or even pulling a slight vacuum within the component so 
that contaminants are exhausted out of the room are all methods of 
component preparation. Robots and ball screw stages are examples of 
clean room ready components.
An additional concern in manufacturing plants is the use and 
disposal of hazardous substances. For chemicals used in manufacturing 
facilities, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheet 
(SDS) is required for cataloguing information on substances. 
Information on how to handle or work with the substance; physical 
data such as melting, boiling, or flash points; storage; disposal; and 
spill-handling procedures are all required. Formats can differ, 
depending on national and local regulations. These data sheets are 
placed close to the location where any chemical is stored or used.
In the electronics industry, dangerous substances are prohibited 
above certain concentrations. Materials such as lead, mercury, 
cadmium, and several other substances are limited by weight or 
percentage, and products are tested for compliance. The Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive limits amounts of 
dangerous chemicals in consumer products and packaging. Products 
affected include electronic and electrical tools, automatic dispensers, 
lightbulbs and lighting equipment, household appliances, toys, and 
many other consumer devices.
Discharge of waste substances into water, landfills, and air is also 
regulated by various U.S. and international agencies. While often 
criticized by environmental groups, most companies in industrialized 
nations spend vast sums of money ensuring that factory impacts on 
the environment are minimized or eliminated. Water treatment, waste 
packaging, and air filters and scrubbers are used to reduce the impact 
of pollutants on the environment. Remediation of polluted areas is 
also an important requirement of manufacturing and industry 
enforced by governmental agencies.

CHAPTER 2
Important Concepts
2.1 Analog and Digital
The most basic element of automation logic is its digital state. A switch 
or signal may only be on or off. This can be represented as a signal 
being a 0 (off) or a 1 (on). There are many elements in an automation 
scheme that can be represented as a 1 or 0—the state of a switch or 
sensor; the state of a motor, valve, or pilot light; or even the state of a 
machine itself.
The state of many devices cannot be so simply described. A motor 
can be described as being on or off, but it has other parameters, such 
as its speed, that can only be described numerically. For this purpose 
an analog representation of the value is used. Depending on the types 
of numbers that are used, an analog value can be represented as an 
integer or a fractional number with a decimal point.
Analog input signals take the form of changes in either voltage or 
current. The analog device may be measuring position, speed, flow, 
or another physical characteristic. These signals are connected to a 
circuit, which then converts the signal into a digital number. Output 
analog signals also take the form of changes in voltage or current. A 
digital set point is converted to an analog output, which may drive 
the speed of a motor or the position of a valve.
Analog inputs and outputs must go through these digital-to-
analog and analog-to-digital conversions because of the inherently 
digital nature of computer and control systems. An analog value can 
have an infinite number of values within a given range. Pick any two 
points along the constant slope of a voltage change and there can 
always be another point between them.
Electrical signals are converted to digital from analog inputs 
using an analog-to-digital converter circuit (ADC). Signals are 
converted from digital to analog using a DAC, or digital-to-analog 
converter. These converter circuits are designed to operate over a 
fixed range of signals based on the application. The number of digital 
steps that an ADC or DAC is capable of is known as the resolution of 
9

10 
C h a p t e r  T w o
the converter, this is described by the number of bits of the digital 
signal. A 16-bit DAC has a higher resolution than a 14-bit DAC, 
meaning it displays a higher number of subdivided values within its 
range.
Another specification related to analog signals is linearity. This is 
a definition relating to the “straightness” of the input signal or 
resultant conversion. Linearity may relate to aspects of the signal 
being measured or to the converting device itself. It may be thought 
of as how much the converted signal deviates from the original.
2.1.1 Scaling
Analog values must be converted into units of measurement to be 
displayed. The formula for doing this is derived from the formula for 
a line, Y = m × x + b, where m is the scalar created by dividing the 
engineering unit range by the current or voltage range (also commonly 
referred to as the slope of the line), x is the analog value from the input 
point, and b is the offset (if there is any). Y is the engineering unit 
value to be displayed.
As an example, let us say we have a 4 to 20 mA input representing 
a weight in pounds. At 4 mA we have a reading of 0 lb, while at 
20 mA we have a reading of 100 lb. Assume a 16-bit card that gives a 
reading of 0 at 4 mA and 65,536 at 20 mA. The range for pounds is 
then 100 and the range for the current is 65,536; the scalar is then 
100/65,536 = 0.0015259, which is the number of pounds per digital 
count. In this example, let us assume we have a value of 27,000 from 
our card. Multiplying by the scalar gives a value of 41.199, or about 
42 lb. Note that in this example, there was no offset since both ranges 
started at 0.
Now let us use an example that does have an offset. Assume we 
wanted to know at what current value the weight of 20 lb would be. 
The scalar would then be 16/100 = 0.16 mA/lb. Since the reading of 
0 lb is at 4 mA, we have to use the offset b. The formula would then 
be (0.16 × 20) + 4 or 7.2 mA. Another convenient way to get an 
approximate value is to simply graph a line on a piece of graph paper 
using the appropriate scales. Figure 2.1 illustrates how this is done 
for the above example.
Drawing a graph is also a great way to roughly check your math!
This process is even simpler when converting an analog signal to 
engineering units in a control program. Simply take whatever value 
is present when the process is at 0 (in the above example 0 lb) and 
subtract it from the signal. This is your offset. Then take the range 
from your new 0 to some known value (such as the 20 lb above) and 
determine the scalar: 20 lb/number of counts = scalar. As in the above 
example, this should be approximately 0.001526. This process can be 
automated to self-calibrate by using the resting value or unloaded 
value of the device to log the offset automatically and by using a 
calibrated weight to determine the range or scalar.

2.2 Input and Output (Data)
The control of a system reacts to input information and configures 
output(s) accordingly. Input and output information can be in the 
form of physical signals, such as electrical and pneumatic pulses or 
levels, or it can be in a virtual form, such as text instructions or data. 
A controller may react to switches or fluid levels by turning on valves 
or running motors at a given speed, or a computer may react to text 
or mouse-click-type instructions by changing display screens or 
running a program. These are both cause and effect illustrations of 
automation at work.
2.2.1 Discrete I/O
Most control systems on a manufacturing plant floor use discrete I/O 
(or input/output) in some form on both the input and output sides of 
the process. Digital signals, such as switches, push buttons, and 
various types of sensors, are wired to the inputs of a system. Outputs 
can drive motors or valves by turning them off and on.
Typical electrical I/O uses low-voltage and current signals for 
inputs and outputs. The most widely used signals are 24 volt (V) DC 
(24VDC) and 120VAC, although this can vary by application and by 
country. In some systems that need even lower electrical energy 
because of a hazardous environment, low-voltage systems called 
“intrinsically safe” circuits are used. These are typically about 8VDC 
or less. When a system is shielded from outside effects, such as signals 
inside a controller or on a circuit board, signals of 5VDC or less are 
common.
Because of personnel safety concerns, 120VAC I/O is not as 
widely used; however, systems that have sensors and actuators

spread over a large physical area still sometimes use AC. Many older 
automation systems still use 120VAC, but 24VDC is more widely 
accepted on newer systems as electrical code requirements have 
limited the access to electrical systems over 60 V (refer to NFPA 70E). 
Process plants with AC valves and motor starters or large conveying 
systems still occasionally use 120VAC, but distributed communication 
or network-based I/O is becoming more common.
Other types of discrete I/O are used for special cases. Pneumatic 
valves can be plumbed in a configuration called “air logic,” where 
switches may allow air to flow in a circuit, actuating valves and other 
air switches to serve much the same purpose as electrical signals. Air 
logic is used in some cases where electricity can be hazardous, but it 
is not as common as the use of electrical signals.
2.2.2 Analog I/O
Analog inputs and outputs typically take the form of changes in 
either voltage or current. Analog inputs may represent the position of 
a device, an air pressure, the weight of an object, or any other physical 
property that can be represented numerically. Most measurement 
systems use analog inputs. Analog outputs may be used to control 
the speed of a motor, the temperature of an oven, and many other 
properties. An example of how discrete and analog I/O signals differ 
is shown in Fig. 2.2.
Common analog ranges in industrial applications are 0 to 20 mA 
or 4 to 20 mA when using current or 0 to 10VDC for voltage. Current 
control is considered to be less susceptible to electrical noise—and 
hence more stable—while voltage control can be used over longer 
distances.

PID Control
Control of a closed-loop system (Fig. 2.3) is often done with PID 
control algorithms or controllers. A closed-loop system takes feedback 
from whatever variable is being controlled, such as temperature or 
speed, and uses it to attempt to maintain a set point. PID stands for 
proportional-integral-derivative, the names of the variables set in the 
controlling algorithm. Another name for this is “three-term control.”
In a closed-loop system, a sensor is used to monitor the process 
variable of the system. This may be the speed of a motor, the pressure 
or flow of a liquid, the temperature of a process, or any variable that 
needs to be controlled. This value is then digitized into a numerical 
value scaled to the engineering units of what is being measured. The 
variable is then compared to the set point for the system; the difference 
between the set point and the process variable is the error or difference 
that must be minimized by the system. This value is “fed back” into 
the system to counteract the error. Figure 2.4 shows a graphic diagram 
of PID control.
For any error that must be compensated for, there is some actuator 
or value that must be controlled to offset the error. In the case of 
temperature, this might be a proportional valve that feeds hot water 
into a system or gas into a burner; for a motor it might be current to 
increase speed or torque. The current error within the system is

closely related to the P or proportional value; in other words, the 
variable is used as a direct offset to the detected error.
One might think it would be sufficient to simply use the P value 
to constantly introduce an offset into a process; if one is trying to keep 
a container of liquid at a constant temperature, why cannot one just 
add heat until the container is at the desired temperature and then 
remove the heat? Experience would say that the temperature would 
either overshoot the set point or take a very long time to get there. 
There is the possibility that we would want to achieve the set point 
very quickly, further increasing the overshoot. This is where the other 
variables, the I and D parameters, are applied.
If the proportional variable is the current error, the integral or I 
value can be thought of as the accumulation of past errors, while the 
derivative or D value can be thought of as a prediction of future errors. 
These values are affected by the rate of change in the sensed PV and, 
if properly applied, can improve control of the process immensely. 
The I and D parameters are not always used in the process. One or the 
other is often omitted, creating the terms PI and PD control.
PID controllers may be a self-contained device such as a panel-
mounted temperature controller or an algorithm within a PLC or 
DCS controlling an analog “loop.” There are various ways to arrive at 
the P, I, and D values, including the Zeigler-Nichols method, “Good 
Gain” method, and Skogestad’s method, but one of the most common 
is the “guess and check” or trial and error method.
Parameters and variables are set in an iterative process after 
defining the cycle. An example of this process for a temperature loop 
is illustrated here:
Predefine and set up a PV (process variable), CV (control 
1. 
variable), and SP (set point). In this example, assume PV is a 
temperature input 4 to 20 mA signal (RTD) downstream of the 
CV, where the CV is a modulating analog steam control valve. 
The set point would then be the desired water temperature 
the PV would need to achieve after steam is added.
Set integral and derivative variables to zero (0).
2. 
Start the process and adjust the proportional/gain tuning 
3. 
parameter until the PV starts modulating above and below 
the SP.
Time a cycle or period of this oscillation. Record this time as 
4. 
the natural period or cycle time.
After timing and recording the cycle, reduce the P 
5. 
(proportional) value to half of the setting needed to achieve 
the natural cycle.
At this point set the I (integral) parameter to the natural cycle. 
6. 
This will decrease the amount of time it takes for the PV to 
reach SP than with the P setting alone.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
15
The D (derivative) may generally be safely set to approximately 
7. 
one-eighth of the integral setting. This value helps with 
“damping” or controlling the overshoot of the process. If a 
process is noisy or dynamics are fast enough, where PI is 
sufficient the D value may often be left at 0.
While moving from just the (P) setup to adding the (I) value, it is 
important to stop and restart the process as well as any setting 
adjustments that need to be made in a manual mode. If the process 
remains in automatic and attempts are made to adjust variables, the 
system will be looking at the previous cycles and will not be a true 
indication of PID performance in a typical start-up scenario.
There are many other possible modifications to hardware and 
software PID controllers, such as set point softening, rate before reset, 
proportional band, reset rate, velocity mode, parallel gains, and P-on-
PV. Users should first select the standard PID form when setting up 
controller values. It is also important to make sure the loop update 
time is 5 to 10 times faster than the natural period.
Servo systems and software programs usually have auto-tuning 
algorithms that use results from input information, known system 
characteristics, and detected loads to approximate PID settings. 
Many manufacturers preset algorithm variables based on the 
hardware selected and input information about the process. Process 
control and servo system loops can act very differently, however, 
and a general knowledge of PID can be useful in setting initial 
parameters.
2.2.3 Communications
Communications methods can be applied to transfer larger amounts 
of information to and from a controller. With this method, digital and 
analog I/O statuses, along with text and numerical data, can be 
transferred. There are many different methods of communication-
based input and output protocols. Many of the communication 
techniques described below have been adapted to allow remotely 
mounted devices and I/O blocks to be distributed to various locations 
on a machine or within a system and to be controlled from a central 
point. Often the remotely mounted I/O points can be semiautonomous 
in controlling their local stations, with only periodic communication 
to the central controller.
Devices and controllers are linked together to form a 
communications network. A network may be as simple as two devices 
talking to one another or a multilayered scheme with hundreds or 
even millions of devices on it (as with the Internet). Common 
topologies or layouts for networks include ring or star configurations 
(Fig. 2.5). An individual element of a network is also known as 
a node.

16 
C h a p t e r  T w o
Serial
Serial communications are strings of digital 1s and 0s sent over a 
single wire. They can alternate between sending and receiving data 
or have a dedicated line for each signal. The protocols for the data 
sent across the lines can vary widely but a few of the common types 
of serial communications are RS232, RS422 and RS485. The RS in 
these designations is an acronym for “recommended standard” and 
does not describe the actual communication protocol being used.
RS232 communications typically use separate send and receive 
lines. These are labeled as TX for transmit and RX for receive. They 
can also use other lines such as CTS and CTR for clear-to- send and 
clear-to-receive as a traffic control or hardware handshaking method. 
There are a number of parameters such as baud rate (the speed of the 
communication or bit rate), number of bits per character (7 or 8), 
whether or not a “stop” bit is used, and whether the CTS and CTR 
lines are used (hardware handshaking). RS 232 signals are a common 
standard 
used 
between 
computer 
terminals 
and 
various 
manufacturers’ control platforms. A nine-pin serial port is often 
included on a computer or control system, which makes it a convenient 
tool for downloading programming into control devices. The TX and 
RX lines can either connect to the same pin numbers on each end or 
connect RX-TX and TX-RX, which is known as a “null-modem” 
configuration. Adapters are readily available to reverse these pins or 
convert a male plug to a female one. These are commonly known as 
“gender benders.”
RS422 and RS485 communications use a pair (or two) of twisted 
wires to carry the transmit and receive signals bidirectionally. Though 
it is not necessary to use twisted pair wiring, it helps with noise 
FIGURE 2.5 Ring and star topologies.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
17
rejection. Many RS422 encoder cables do not use twisted pair because 
of their typically shorter length.
RS422 and RS485 can be used over a much longer distance and 
at a higher data rate than RS232 because it requires a lower signal 
voltage. RS422 is a multidrop configuration, whereas RS485 is a 
multipoint or “daisy-chain” configuration. These are often referred 
to as balanced or differential signaling (for example, 4 wire RS422 
has RX+, RX–, TX+, and TX-). Over long distances, RS422/485 
needs termination resistors at both ends (typically 120 ohm, like 
the CAN bus).
Serial ports also still exist in the Universal Serial Bus (USB) world, 
not only through USB/serial converters, but also because many USB 
devices use the USB port as a virtual serial port.
The protocols used in serial communication are typically based 
on strings of American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
(ASCII) characters. Information is generally text/alphanumeric based 
with line feeds (LF) and/or carriage returns (CR), indicating the end 
of a string of information. Device manufacturers often develop their 
own protocols for issuing commands or encoding data. This includes 
printers, test equipment, ID readers such as bar code and RFID, or 
simple text-based operator interfaces.
Parallel
Parallel communications allow multiple bits to be transmitted 
simultaneously over parallel lines. This can increase the throughput 
of data over RS232 signals, but it increases the cost of the cabling 
between two points. A common use of parallel cabling is between a 
computer’s parallel port and a printer. Another common use of 
parallel communications is between CPU chips and the various 
registers used for processing data on a controller board. This 
configuration is easily visible when looking at the many parallel 
traces on a circuit board or the multicolored ribbon cables that often 
connect boards to each other. The backplanes of many control systems 
that connect controllers to their I/O cards are often parallel busses. 
Parallel communications are generally used over much shorter 
distances than serial communications.
Ethernet
Ethernet is a framework for computer networking technology that 
describes the wiring and signaling characteristics used in local area 
networks (LANs). The medium used for cabling Ethernet 
communications can be in the form of twisted pair wiring, coaxial 
cabling, or fiber-optic lines between points. As with the other 
communication methods described in this section, Ethernet only 
describes the physical characteristics of the system in terms of wiring 
and not the communication protocol used across the wires or fibers. 
Because of the widespread use of Ethernet in computing, nearly every 
computer is now equipped with an Ethernet port. Switches and hubs 

18 
C h a p t e r  T w o
are used to connect computers and control devices in wide-ranging 
configurations. There are two different pin configurations for standard 
Ethernet cables: one with direct terminal-to-terminal configurations 
used with switches and hubs, and another known as a “crossover” 
cable for direct port-to-port connection.
Ethernet communications are very fast in comparison to serial 
and parallel communications and can transfer large amounts of data 
quickly. Devices are assigned a unique address at the factory called 
the MAC address, an abbreviation for media access control. This is a 
48-bit binary address that is usually represented in hexadecimal with 
dashes, such as 12-3C-6F-0A-31-1B. Addresses must then be 
configured for each device on a network in the format of “xxx.xxx.
xxx.xxx.” Addresses can be configured directly by typing them into a 
field or configured automatically by a server using Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Typical LAN systems use DHCP to 
prevent accidental duplication of addresses. A subnet mask is also 
used to prevent crosstalk between different connected networks.
TCP/IP is the set of communication protocols used for the Internet 
and other similar networks. This collection of standards is now 
commonly referred to as the Internet Protocol Suite. It gets its name 
from two of the most important protocols in it—the Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which were the 
first two networking protocols defined in the standard. Today’s IP 
networking is a combination of several developments that began in 
the 1960s and 1970s. The Internet and LANs began to emerge in 
the 1980s and evolved with the advent of the World Wide Web in 
the early 1990s.
The Internet Protocol Suite may be viewed as a collection of 
wiring and signaling “layers.” Each layer addresses a set of problems 
involving the transmission of data. Services are provided to the upper 
layers by the lower layers, which translate data into forms that can be 
transmitted. The stream of data being transmitted is divided into 
sections called frames. These frames contain both source and 
destination addresses along with the transmitted data and error-
checking information. This allows the information to be retransmitted 
if it is detected to be different from what was sent originally. Errors 
are often caused by data “collisions” and require the data to be resent; 
this is more common as more devices are placed on a network. 
Because of this, the network speed is slowed dramatically and cannot 
always be reliably estimated. Standard Ethernet is considered to be a 
nondeterministic networking system because of this and is not 
suitable for direct I/O control.
Ethernet/IP is a subset of Ethernet often used in process control 
and other industrial control applications. Developed by Rockwell 
Automation and managed by ODVA, it is an application layer 
protocol, and it considers all of the devices on a network as a series of 
“objects.” Ethernet/IP is built on the widely used CIP (Common 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
19
Industrial Protocol), which makes seamless access to objects from 
ControlNet and DeviceNet networks. Maximum response times can 
be configured and managed within this protocol, making it much 
more suitable for control applications.
A recent advancement in Ethernet topology is the Device Level 
Ring (DLR) which basically incorporates a two-port switch into each 
of the devices on the ring so that a level of redundancy can be 
achieved. Using this topology, even with the loss of communication 
between two devices, the entire system can still maintain 
communication. This topology does require a ring supervisor that 
determines how to send the packets of data to best manage the system 
and also monitor for any breaks in communication. Because of its 
wide acceptance in both IT and on the automation side, the Ethernet 
protocol seems to be a very widely accepted method of control and 
communication in newer automation topologies.
USB
USB is a configuration widely used in computer peripheral devices, 
but it is beginning to be adopted into automation systems. It was 
originally designed as a replacement for some of the RS232 and other 
serial connections on the backside of PCs. Along with communications 
between peripheral devices, it can also provide a limited amount of 
current to power devices. USB signals are transmitted on twisted pair 
data cable. Unlike some of the physical-only specifications described 
previously, the USB standard also includes frame and communications 
protocols for more commonality between devices from different 
manufacturers.
Special Automation Protocols
Many automation component vendors have developed their 
own protocols for communications using the various physical 
forms described above. Communication of data between controllers 
and operator interface touch screens are often developed by 
the manufacturer and, as such, are not used between different 
manufacturers. To facilitate communication between different 
manufacturers’ devices, drivers are made available to allow devices to 
be easily interfaced.
Because of the interconnection problems between devices from 
different 
manufacturers, 
protocols 
have 
been 
adopted 
for 
communication and I/O control as standards.
Most of the following protocols are used for data communication 
and distributed I/O between a main controller and a remote node.
DeviceNet is an open communications protocol used to connect 
low-level devices, such as sensors and actuators, to higher-level 
devices, such as PLCs. DeviceNet leverages the controller area 
network (CAN) physical communication standard, which is a serial 
communication method for intelligent devices to talk to each other. 

20 
C h a p t e r  T w o
It uses CAN hardware to define a method of configuring, accessing, 
and controlling devices. It is commonly used for remote I/O and 
control of servo and other motor control systems. DeviceNet is not 
very fast compared to many other network methods, but it is 
considered very robust and reliable. DeviceNet networks can be 
difficult to implement initially and require special configuration 
software to commission.
CANOpen is a communication protocol used in embedded 
systems. It is also a device profile specification that defines 
an application layer for hardware. CANOpen consists of this 
application layer, an addressing scheme, and several smaller internal 
communication protocols. Because it is a mature, open protocol, 
CANOpen is supported extensively by servo and stepper controller 
manufacturers.
PROFIBUS is a bit-serial Fieldbus protocol developed by a group 
of companies in Germany. It is a global market leader among protocols 
because it can be used in both production automation and process 
automation. PROFIBUS PA is a low-current variation used to monitor 
measuring equipment in process automation (PA). PROFIBUS DP 
(Decentralized Peripherals) is used to operate sensors and actuators 
via a centralized controller in a production environment. Siemens is a 
major player in the PROFIBUS market.
Fieldbus is a group of industrial computer networking protocols 
developed for distributed control in real time. Prior to this 
development, computers were often connected using RS232 or other 
serial methods. Fieldbus includes most of the special protocols 
described above as well as Modbus, ASIbus, Sercos, ControlNet, and 
EtherCAT and other Ethernet-based networking methods such as 
EtherNet PowerLink, PROFINET, and Modbus/TCP.
In general terms, a fieldbus can be described as a network designed 
specifically for industrial control. This includes the protocols and 
physical layer definitions required to implement the communication 
system.
The highway addressable remote transducer (HART) protocol 
uses the 4 to 20 mA analog wiring of instrumentation devices as a 
medium for its communication signal. It superimposes a low-level 
digital signal over the analog value. HART technology is a master/
slave protocol, which means that the slave device (the sensor or 
actuator) only replies when spoken to by the master device (the 
controller).
Though originally developed by Rosemount as a proprietary 
method of communication for its own products, it was made an open 
protocol for other vendors in the mid-1980s. There is a very large 
installed base around the world, mostly in the process industry. One 
reason for this is its ease of retrofitting into an existing wiring scheme. 
At only 1200 bps, it is not a very fast method of communication, but 
it is considered to be simple and reliable.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
21
The signal includes diagnostic and status information from the 
device as well as the measured variable. The 4 to 20 mA signal is still 
considered to be the primary measured value and is unchanged by the 
superimposed digital communications. Communications are permitted 
in either point-to-point or multidrop network configurations.
Media for these various protocols vary from simple twisted pair 
wiring to shielded multiconductor or coaxial cable. Fiber-optic media 
can also be used in Ethernet communication and generally have a 
longer transmittable range than the various forms of copper media. 
Permissible distances between devices will vary based on the voltage 
level of the protocol and the configuration and type of media used.
Wireless
Wireless network refers to any type of computer network that is not 
connected by cables of any kind. This method avoids the more costly 
process of routing cables into a building or as a connection between 
distant equipment locations. Wireless telecommunications networks 
are generally implemented and administered over radio waves. This 
implementation takes place at the physical level or layer of the 
network structure.
A wireless local area network (WLAN) links two or more devices 
over a short distance, usually providing a connection through an 
access point for Internet access. The use of spread-spectrum 
technologies may allow users to move around within a local coverage 
area and still remain connected to the network. This is especially 
handy for devices such as portable HMIs.
Products using the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards are marketed 
under the Wi-Fi brand name. Fixed wireless technology implements 
point-to-point links between computers or networks at two distant 
locations, often using dedicated microwave or modulated laser light 
beams over line of sight paths. It is often used in systems such as 
AGVs (automated guided vehicles), which move products around 
within a factory. It is also used with some RFID systems.
2.2.4 Other Types of I/O
High-Speed Counters
High-speed counters receive pulses at a high rate of speed. These 
pulses may indicate the speed or position of a motor or other revolving 
or linear device. High-speed counters are typically used with encoders 
and have other features such as inputs for homing signals and 
interrupts. They may be in the form of a stand-alone instrument or a 
card in a PLC rack.
Decoders
Decoders receive analog rotary position information from resolvers 
to provide angular position and velocity for a rotating axis. The input 

22 
C h a p t e r  T w o
is typically a sinusoidal waveform in the millivolt range. Like high-
speed counters, there are usually other input and output points 
available associated with the axis.
2.3 Numbering Systems
Various systems are used for numerical representation in the 
automation world. Some systems are configured for ease of use by 
computer- or microprocessor-based systems, while others are geared 
more toward high precision or being easily read by human beings. 
Table 2.1 illustrates how different radix-based numbering systems 
relate to each other.
2.3.1 Binary and BOOL
The binary numbering system is a base-2 system where each digit 
may only be a 0 (or “off” state) or 1 (or “on” state). Computers use 
this system internally because of the gate or switch logic nature of 
computing systems. The 1s and 0s can be grouped in such a way as to 
easily be converted into other numbering systems.
Though not directly related to the binary numbering system, 
logical operations on strings of binary characters are called Boolean 
or bitwise operations. For this reason, the binary system is sometimes 
referred to as a Boolean system, though not entirely correctly.
2.3.2 Decimal
The system most people are used to is the decimal or base-10 system. 
This system has a radix of 10 and allows fractional numbers to be 
represented conveniently using a radix point for base 10 or decimal 
point. Decimal numbers are not as easily converted to and from 
binary numbers because its radix of 10 is not a power of 2 like the 
hexadecimal and octal numbering systems.
2.3.3 Hexadecimal and Octal
The hexadecimal system is a base-16 system. Its primary use is as an 
easily convertible representation of groups of binary digits. It uses 16 
symbols, most often 0 to 9 for the first 10 digits and A to F for the 
values 10 to 15. Since each digit represents four binary digits, it serves 
as convenient shorthand for values in base 2. A hexadecimal number 
is sometimes referred to as a “nibble,” which consists of 4 bits as 
shown in Table 2.1.
The octal numbering system is a base-8 system that uses the 
numerical values of 0 to 7. Like the hexadecimal system, octal is easily 
converted from binary since it is grouped as three binary digits (its 
radix is an even power of 2). The octal and hexadecimal numbering 
systems are sometimes used as an I/O numbering base.

2.3.4 Floating Point and REAL
Noninteger numbers are represented as floating point or real numbers. 
These are usually represented using 32 bits, also known as single 
precision. Sixty-four-bit floating point numbers are known as double 
precision.
Floating point numbers allow the radix point (decimal point in 
base 10) to be variable depending on whether a very large or very 
small number is being represented. Because the radix point (decimal 
point or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can be placed 
anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number, floating 
point numbers can support a much wider range of values than fixed-
point and integers.
Floating point representation is advantageous in that it can 
support a wider range of values. However, the floating format 
requires slightly more storage to encode the position of the radix 
point and is slightly less precise than fixed-point numbers.
2.3.5 Bytes and Words
Bits can be grouped for convenience into 8-bit “bytes” and 16-bit 
“words.” These numerical structures are convenient for passing 
packets of information that include numbers and text characters. 
Bytes can be further subdivided into 4-bit “nibbles,” which can then 
be used to represent hexadecimal values. Table 2.1 illustrates this 
relationship further. Thirty-two-bit double words or double integers 
(DINTs) are also commonly used as a grouping technique.
For multiple byte data types (see Sec. 6.1.3 for more on this) 
bytes may be ordered in most significant value or “big end” in the 
first data register (big endian) or least significant value in the lowest 
data register (little endian). It is important to know how the data is 
arranged and used in computer registers since the wrong byte 
ordering will produce incorrect math results and mixed up text 
displays.
2.3.6 ASCII
ASCII is a coding standard that can be used for representing words 
and text characters. It is implemented as a character-encoding scheme 
primarily in computers and communications equipment. ASCII 
includes definitions for 128 characters. Thirty-three are nonprinting, 
mostly obsolete control characters that affect how text is processed. 
Ninety-four are printable characters, and the space is considered an 
invisible graphic. An “extended” ASCII table is included in the 
appendix of this book.
ASCII values are often grouped into user readable arrays called 
strings in programming. These arrays are arranged in such a way as 
to be readable by the human eye on HMIs, computers, or printed 
pages.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s

2.4 Electrical Power
Most control systems are electrical in nature with a few exceptions. 
Electrical power can be divided into two categories: alternating 
current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC is generated by rotating the 
windings of a rotor inside the stationary windings of a stator. Power 
generation plants use this technique to generate power at a very high 
voltage and transfer it across long distances. AC current changes 
polarity or direction many times a second. This waveform is 
represented using a sinusoidal shape (see Fig. 2.8 for a three-phase 
illustration). At the point of use, electricity is stepped down in voltage 
using a transformer to a more usable voltage. Typically DC voltage is 
then converted from a lower AC voltage using a DC power supply. 
The DC power is then used for devices in an automation system.
2.4.1 Frequency
The frequency of an AC voltage is expressed in hertz, abbreviated Hz. 
This is a unit of measurement of cycles per second, which directly 
relates to the rotary method used to generate the AC voltage. The 
frequency power-generating systems use in the United States is 
60 Hz, while 50 Hz is common over much of the rest of the world. 
Ship- and aircraft-based power-generating systems often use 400 Hz.
Frequencies are carefully controlled at the power stations of most 
countries; however, in some remote areas, the frequency of the power 
grid can vary somewhat. In most cases, automation and control 
equipment can handle a slight variation in frequency, but some 
devices, such as AC motors, are designed for use at a specific 
frequency. It is important to know the power frequency of the country 
a system is designed for since many of the devices, such as 
transformers, motors, and power supplies, are designed around a 
specific frequency. There are often switches or internal jumpers that 
must be set to the correct frequency for proper equipment operation.
2.4.2 Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Subatomic particles called electrons flowing through a conducting 
medium such as a wire constitute electricity. The amount of electrons 
flowing through the conductor is known as current, which is measured 
in amperes, or amps. The force or “pressure” being applied to the 
current is called voltage, measured in volts. It is sometimes convenient 
to think of electricity in terms of water flow; the number of gallons 
per period of time being similar to current, and the water pressure 
being similar to voltage. If this analogy is carried further, the amount 
of restriction of water flow, such as kinking a hose, is similar to 
resistance in electricity, which is measured in ohms.
If any two values of an electrical circuit are known, the third can 
be determined using a formula called Ohm’s law. This states that 

26 
C h a p t e r  T w o
Voltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R). Conversely, I = V/R and 
R = V/I. The letter E is sometimes substituted for V in these equations.
Resistors
Components that are made for the purpose of providing a fixed 
amount of resistance to current flow are called resistors. These are 
commonly made of carbon, although metal film, wirewound around 
a core, and various foils are also used. Carbon resistors often have a 
color code printed on them to identify their resistance value in ohms 
and their tolerance or precision (Fig. 2.6). Resistors are also classified 
by how much power they can dissipate; as current flows through a 
resistor, heat is created, which can damage the resistor and cause it to 
fail. Most low-power electrical circuits use currents that are well 
below the rating of the resistor.
Resistors can also be made in such a way that their resistance is 
variable. A wirewound resistor can be tapped at different points along 
its windings to vary the resistance between the tap and endpoint of the 
resistor. A diagram of these variable resistors is shown in Fig. 2.7. The 
first arrangement is known as a rheostat and is used to control current 
flow; I1 is variable in the diagram. If both ends of the windings are used 
along with the tapped point, the arrangement is known as a potentiometer. 
The potentiometer arrangement is also known as a voltage divider; V2 
is variable in the diagram. Note also that I1 = I2 + I3. Both rheostats and

potentiometers can be arranged in a linear fashion (slider) or a rotary 
configuration suitable for adjustment with a knob or dial.
2.4.3 Power
Power is the amount of electrical energy in a circuit or system and is 
expressed in watts. It can be calculated by multiplying voltage and 
current, or P = V × I. Power is closely related to other units of energy, 
such as joules or horsepower, and can also be used to calculate the 
heat generated by a system or device if the efficiency is known. Power 
can be calculated in other ways for an AC voltage, depending on the 
number of phases of the electrical system. For larger power ratings, 
these values are usually expressed in kilowatts (thousands of watts), 
abbreviated kW.
2.4.4 Phase and Voltages
Electricity is usually supplied as a multiphase voltage. Three phases, 
each 120 electrical rotational degrees from each other, is very common 
in industrial facilities (Fig. 2.8). Though higher voltage is usually 
supplied at the service entrance of a building, it is generally stepped 
down using a transformer to various commonly used voltages. 
Common voltages for three-phase AC electrical power in the United 
States are 480, 240, and 208 V. Power is also often converted to single 
phase 120, 177, and 240 V. Voltages in some countries can be as high 
as 575VAC, so standard conductors are often rated at 600 V.
Voltages are not as precisely controlled as frequencies. A 480VAC 
voltage is usually measured at slightly below the stated voltage, 
while 220, 230, and 240VAC systems are often used interchangeably. 
Motors are specified for a range of voltages, as are DC power 
supplies.
Three-phase systems can be arranged in a delta configuration or 
a wye, which includes a neutral leg. The wye configuration produces 
not only the phase-to-phase voltage, but also an additional lower 
phase to neutral voltage. Additionally, windings can be center tapped 
to produce other voltages.

2.4.5 Inductance and Capacitance
An inductor is a coil of wire. Any conductor creates a magnetic field 
proportional to the current flowing through it; by forming the 
conductor into a coil this magnetic field is concentrated into a smaller 
area. As the current is changed through the coil, the magnetic field 
tends to oppose this change. This property is known as inductance, 
and its unit of measure is the henry (typical inductor values are in the 
millihenry range). Inductors are used for filtering signals, shifting the 
phase of a voltage, or reducing noise in electrical circuits. Because of 
the opposition to current change, voltage is said to lead current when 
AC current is passed through an inductor.
Inductors may consist of multiple turns of wire with nothing in 
the center or may be wrapped around a ferrite (iron-based) core to 
increase the inductance. They may even take the form of a spiral 
etched into a circuit board for integrated circuits. A pair of inductors 
placed in parallel will induce a voltage from one coil to the other 
when alternating current is applied, forming a transformer.
A capacitor is formed of two plates of conducting material 
separated by an insulator, known as a dielectric. When a voltage is 
applied across the two plates, the capacitor builds up a static charge 
since the current cannot pass through the insulating dielectric 
material. This ability to hold an electrical charge is known as 
capacitance and is measured in farads (a standard capacitance value 
might be in the microfarads). If the voltage is alternated across the 
capacitor plates, the charges will tend to oppose the change. Capacitors 
therefore tend to have many complementary properties with 
inductors; where an inductor opposes a change in current, a capacitor 
opposes a change in voltage. An inductor passes current easily at low 
frequencies but increases its resistance to current as the frequency 
increases. This property is called inductive reactance and can be

thought of as a variable resistance to AC. A capacitor passes current 
much easier as the applied frequency increases while creating a 
greater opposition to current flow at low frequencies, effectively 
becoming an open circuit when DC is applied (0 Hz). This frequency-
based variation in resistance is called capacitive reactance. Current is 
said to lead voltage when AC current is passed through a capacitor.
Capacitors can take various forms; two plates placed in parallel 
with a thin piece of insulating material between them, long strips of 
conducting foil and insulating paper or plastic wound into a cylinder, 
or aluminum plate material separated by an oxidized material and an 
electrolytic liquid.
Historically, inductors were often called chokes, while capacitors 
were known as condensers, today the terms inductor and capacitor are 
most often used. Inductors, capacitors, and resistors are used together 
extensively in electrical circuits to control and filter signals and as 
supporting elements for solid-state circuits and integrated circuits (ICs).
These components are often termed passive components to 
differentiate them with active solid-state components (Fig. 2.9). 
Inductor and capacitors are also called “reactive” components because 
their response can vary depending on the frequency of the applied 
signal.
2.4.6 Solid-State Devices
Semiconductors are materials that have properties in between 
conductors and insulators. By introducing impurities into these 
materials, their properties can be changed to affect the electrical 
current that passes through them.
Current can be thought of as the flow of electrons through a 
conducting material in a direction determined by where electrons are

repelled by a positive charge; hence, current flow is often indicated as 
being from positive to negative. Another way of describing current is 
known as hole flow; a space that an electron can fill can be thought of 
as a hole. Current flow can then also be thought of as the flow of holes 
from a negative to a positive direction. This can be useful when 
describing semiconductor devices.
Common semiconductor materials are silicon, germanium, and 
gallium arsenide, with the most commonly used being silicon based. 
The introduction of impurities into semiconductor materials is known 
as doping, which creates an excess of either electrons (N-type material) 
or holes (P-type material).
The simplest semiconductor device is called a diode. This is a 
device created by bonding a piece of P material and N material 
together. A characteristic of a diode is that when a voltage is applied 
across it, current can only flow in one direction. This makes it useful 
as a current control device in solid-state circuits. Diodes are commonly 
used in rectifier circuits that convert AC to DC. Certain types of 
diodes can also be used to detect light (photodiodes) or generate light 
(light-emitting diodes, or LEDs).
If semiconductor material is arranged is such a way that more 
than one P-N junction is formed, it is known as a transistor. A 
common type of transistor is created when two junctions are formed 
in an NPN or PNP arrangement. This is called a bipolar junction 
transistor and is often used in amplification applications. Other 
common types of transistor include JFET (junction field effect 
transistor) and MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor) types. Both of these make use of the property of 
semiconductors that an electrical field can change the conductivity 
of the material.
By applying a small voltage to one of the transistor leads, the 
current flowing through the device can be changed. When a transistor 
is placed in a circuit with constant resistances a small change in 
voltage on one lead can create a larger change in voltage at another; 
this is known as amplification. If the change in voltage is large enough 
a transistor acts as a switch, either allowing a large current to flow or 
nearly reducing it to 0. Amplifiers can therefore either be used in 
switching circuits or amplification circuits. Solid-state devices are 
considered “active” components because they can be used to convert 
a small low-voltage signal into a larger high-voltage or current signal. 
Figure 2.10 shows some of the schematic symbols used to represent 
active semiconductor devices.
Transistors are often wired together with other discrete components 
on printed circuit boards with metal traces and small holes for leads to 
be placed into. Components are usually attached by soldering and 
form transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits, amplifiers, or other types 
of electronic circuits. These can also be combined with IC devices to 
accomplish various electronic or processing functions.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
31
TTL
Switching circuits can be combined into combinations that perform 
logic functions. An example might be producing an output signal only 
if certain input signals are present or not present. These circuits are often 
arranged as “gates” and are available in various combinations on 
integrated circuit chips. AND gates produce an output if all input signals 
are present or “high.” OR gates produce an output if any input signal is 
high. The output of the circuit may be inverted (NAND or Not AND, 
NOR or Not OR) as may some or all of the input signals. This is usually 
designated by a small circle on the lead signifying an inversion. TTL 
arrangements can be arranged in vast combinations to form complex 
logical functions and form much of the basis of microprocessor logic.
These same logic symbols are often used in flowcharting for 
decision-making or logical processes along with other symbols. 
Figure 2.11 shows some of the standard logic symbols used in electrical 
or logic diagrams.
2.4.7 Integrated Circuits
When solid-state devices such as transistors and diodes are combined 
with passive devices such as capacitors, inductors, and resistors, 
circuits are formed that can alter electrical signals by amplifying, 
switching, and filtering them. These circuits may be made of discrete 
components mounted onto a circuit board or by patterning the 
components onto a semiconductor substrate material. These patterns 
form integrated circuits that can be miniaturized with millions of 
elements on a single semiconductor device. These devices may take 
the form of switching or amplification circuits, memory storage, 
microprocessors, or combinations of different types of circuits.
Integrated circuits are built up layer by layer on a silicon or other 
semiconductor wafer by imaging a pattern onto the surface, doping

or depositing materials into the pattern, and chemically etching into 
the surface. Many layers can be formed in this fashion onto a single 
wafer, producing multiple “chips” or integrated circuits, which are 
then bonded to metal conductor leads to introduce signals or voltages 
into the chip. Figure 2.12 shows how transistors can be combined 
within a single chip to provide logic switching.
Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology 
is a common method of achieving high density for integrated circuits. 
CMOS circuits include image sensing, microprocessors, logic, data 
conversion, and communication transceiver circuits, among many 
others.
2.5 Pneumatics and Hydraulics
Collectively, the use of pressurized liquids or gases to drive actuators 
is known as fluid power.
Hydraulics define power generated by liquids, such as mineral oil 
or water, and pneumatics define power that is generated using gas,

such as air or nitrogen. Fluid power can actuate cylinders in a linear 
fashion, motors in a rotational motion, or actuators in a rotational 
motion of less than 360°.
The advantages of hydraulics and pneumatics vary. While 
pneumatics are typically cheaper to implement and operate, they are 
less precise and are typically limited to larger utilities because of the 
high velocity of expansion once the gas is decompressed. On the other 
hand, while hydraulics might be more precise, they are more expensive 
to build and maintain because of their requirement for a means of 
liquid drainage and recovery and the need for larger equipment.
2.5.1 Pneumatics
Pneumatic or compressed air is used to move cylinders or actuators 
and is even used in some switching logic. Air is typically filtered, 
dried, and regulated to a usable pressure and distributed from a 
compressor to the various devices and actuators where it is required. 
A variety of quick disconnect devices and fittings have been designed 
in metric and standard sizes and are in wide use in industry. Pneumatic 
air supplies are distributed through most industrial facilities and are 
readily available for a wide range of uses.
Air pressure is usually applied to an additional filter regulator 
with a gauge for setting pressure at a machine or system. An 
additional lubricator is sometimes used to apply a minute amount 
of oil to lubricate the insides of air cylinders. Filter regulators (FR) 
and filter-regulator lubricators (FRL) are relatively low-cost and are 
regularly used at the entry point to a pneumatic control system. 
Additional pressure regulators, flow controls, and valves are used 
to control actuators for the desired effect. Control valves are common 
in 120VAC and 24VDC varieties. Figure 2.13 shows how these 
components are combined in a typical pneumatic circuit.
Air pressure in industrial facilities can be as high as several 
hundred psi, but typically pneumatic cylinders are operated at 60 to 
80 psi. Pressure regulators can be used to reduce pressure within the 
system as required.
Flow controls can be placed on either or both ends of a pneumatic 
cylinder to regulate the speed of movement. The term meter in refers 
to restricting the inlet flow of air to a cylinder, while meter out refers 
to restricting the flow out of the other end. After a cylinder has been 
in position without airflow from either port, the pressure tends to 
slowly bleed off. This can cause a sudden “lunge” of the cylinder 
when pressure is reintroduced. To control movement in a selected 
direction, it is generally considered better to meter out rather than 
meter in to make the motion more consistent. In most pneumatic 
cylinders, flow controls are used on both ports and adjusted for 
desired movement in both directions.
Most valves are of the on/off or discrete variety, providing airflow 
(and therefore movement) to a cylinder until it is turned off. 

34 
C h a p t e r  T w o
Proportional air valves are also used to control motion by rapidly 
pulsing air or varying pressure or flow based on actuator position. 
This allows a simple form of motion control for position and speed.
The force that a cylinder can produce is based on the size of the 
bore of the cylinder and the air pressure available to the cylinder. The 
simple equation for the force a cylinder can produce is
 
Force = pressure × area 
(2.1)
Pressure in this equation is the available air pressure (in force/area 
units) and Area is the size of bore available to move the piston in the 
cylinder—typically Area = PI × bore radius2 – rod diameter2 (if the 
rod reduces the available area in the direction in which the force is 
being applied). This data is available in the specification sheets or 
catalogs from the manufacturer.
2.5.2 Hydraulics
Hydraulic systems, unlike pneumatic or air systems, typically have a 
pump located at each machine and are therefore more self-contained. 
Hydraulic pressure is used where more force is required than a 
pneumatic application. Like pneumatic systems, there is a wide variety 
of hydraulic cylinders and actuators available from manufacturers for 
each application. Hydraulic systems are much more costly to 
implement than pneumatic since the systems usually operate at higher 
pressure and more care must be taken to ensure that fluids do not leak 
from the system. Various other components, such as oil coolers and 
intensifiers, can also add to the cost of hydraulic systems.

Hydraulic systems do not operate as quickly as pneumatic 
systems, but, because of the lower compressibility of oil, they can be 
more precisely controlled. Pressures and force obtained from 
hydraulic systems are typically much higher than those of pneumatic 
systems and are therefore often used in metal forming applications.
2.5.3 Pneumatic-Hydraulic Comparison
Advantages of pneumatics:
Cleanliness
• 
Simplicity of design and control
• 
Machines are easily designed using standard cylinders 
 0
and other components. Control is easy as it consists of 
simple on/off-type control.
Reliability
• 
Pneumatic systems tend to have long operating lives and 
 0
require very little maintenance.
Because gas is compressible, the equipment is less likely to 
 0
be damaged by shock. The gas in pneumatics absorbs 
excessive force, whereas the fluid of hydraulics directly 
transfers force.
Storage
• 
Compressed gas can be stored, allowing the use of machines 
 0
when electrical power is lost.
Safety
• 
Very few fire hazards (compared to hydraulic oil).
 0
Machines can be designed to be overload safe.
 0
Typically lower cost
• 
Compressed air readily available in most manufacturing 
 0
environments.
Advantages of hydraulics:
Fluid does not absorb any of the supplied energy.
• 
Hydraulic systems operate at much higher pressures 
• 
(typically 3000 psi) than pneumatic systems, providing 
greater force for a given bore size.
The hydraulic working fluid is basically incompressible, 
• 
leading to a minimum of spring action. When hydraulic fluid 
flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the 
pressure on the load; there is no need to “bleed off” pressurized 
air to release the pressure on the load.

2.6  Continuous, Synchronous, and Asynchronous 
Processes
Processes may take various forms in automated production. They 
may be continuous, as with the mixing of chemicals; synchronous, 
where operations are performed in unison; or asynchronous, where 
operations are performed independently. Manual and automated 
tasks may be mixed to utilize the decision-making and dexterity 
advantages of human labor.
2.6.1 Continuous Processes
Chemical, food, and beverage production often operates in a 
continuous fashion. Chemicals or ingredients are mixed together 
continuously to produce a “batch” of product. Plastics are often 
extruded continuously and then segmented into individual pieces for 
further operations.
2.6.2 Asynchronous Processes
Processes are said to be asynchronous when they do not rely on a 
master timing signal. An example of this might be an operation that 
takes place when a product arrives at an operator station from a 
previous process on a conveyor. The component may then be operated 
on when its arrival has been detected by a sensor rather than at the 
index completion signal from the conveyor.
2.6.3 Synchronous Processes
Synchronous processes rely on a master clock or timing signal. This 
may be an electrically or mechanically based system; cam-driven 
devices on a line shaft are examples of a synchronous process. 
Assembly-line operations may be synchronous or asynchronous, or 
a combination of both, depending on the source of the initiating 
trigger.
2.7 Documentation and File Formats
As automation systems are designed and built, documentation is 
generated both to convey fabrication information to the people 
building the system and to support it after it is in use. Computer-
aided design (CAD) software, office software, and various proprietary 
packages are used to capture and plan the details of design. 
Specifications, requirements, documents, and manufacturers cut 
sheets are collected and usually presented as part of a maintenance 
manual for a machine or system.
There is a wide variety of file formats generated by the software 
that is used to create documentation. Many of these formats are 
proprietary to the companies that created the software, while some 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
37
are open source. While Microsoft has dominated much of the office 
software arena since the PC has become common, picture or image 
formats have come from a variety of sources, each of which have their 
own advantages and disadvantages.
2.7.1 Drafting and CAD
Electrical and mechanical designs need to be conveyed to the people 
who will be fabricating parts and systems for automated machinery. 
Before computers, this had to be done by hand, using pencil and 
paper. Tools such as squares and triangles, protractors and compasses, 
and templates for devices and lettering were used to aid designers. 
Many engineers and draftsmen developed excellent lettering skills 
during their training.
Three-dimensional or isometric drawings as well as drawings of a 
part from three different views were often used for mechanical 
components. These drawings were often quite large, created on drafting 
boards with sheets of paper taped to them. They were then rolled up 
and placed in tubes for transportation and storage. Dimensioning of 
these mechanical parts was either in standard English, metric scales, or 
degrees, or used various drafting-specific symbols.
Electrical and logic drawings were done in the same way. Symbols 
for electrical or logical components were cut out of template material 
for tracing onto the page. Many of the symbols in use today are 
electronic versions of these template symbols.
CAD
As computers developed and became more economical, CAD was 
developed. This made design much faster and allowed engineers to 
do their own drawing rather than relying on draftsmen. Universities 
now offer classes in various software CAD packages, such as Pro/
ENGINEER, SolidWorks, or AutoCAD, rather than drafting.
CAD software packages are either two-dimensional vector-based 
drafting systems or three-dimensional solid and surface modelers. 
Three-dimensional packages allow rotation in all dimensions and 
adjustment of color and transparency of various components. Viewers 
for assemblies are often available for free from the software designer 
so that customers can see designs without having to purchase the 
software.
Some CAD software is also capable of doing mathematical 
modeling of components. This allows strength and dynamic analysis 
of assemblies. It can then be used throughout the engineering process 
from the conceptual design or quoting stage through definition of the 
manufacturing methods for components. These dynamic modeling 
packages are often marketed as CADD for computer-aided design and 
drafting. Three-dimensional CAD is also known as solid modeling.
Electrical drawings and some mechanical design is still done 
using two-dimensional CAD. The most popular versions are made 

38 
C h a p t e r  T w o
by Autodesk and marketed as AutoCAD. A less expensive version 
called AutoSketch is also available. File formats for AutoCAD end 
with the extension “.dwg,” but drawings may be saved as .dxf files 
for easy exchange with other CAD programs.
Electrical drawings are referred to as schematics. Special symbols 
for electrical components are often kept in software “libraries” for 
repetitive use. Modern CAD systems can use these components to 
generate bills of materials (BOMS) for purchasing and spare parts. 
These systems can also analyze drawings to determine numbers of 
terminal blocks and labels, also generating off-page connector and 
line numbers for component labeling.
CAD drawings are typically printed or plotted to standardized 
page sizes. The most common for electrical drawing packages are 
D size, or 11-by-17 in. Electrical drawing pages usually have line 
numbers down the edge of each page, indexed by page number. This 
allows wire numbers to coincide with the line numbers for easy 
reference. Electrical drawings also have a title block, generally in the 
lower-right corner of the page border. This block contains project and 
page titles, revision numbers, dates, and initials for the people who 
drew, checked, and approved the drawings. This is an important part 
of the error-proofing process for electrical design.
Even with the checking process, mistakes and changes make 
drawing changes necessary after the drawings are released for 
assembly. Changes are often drawn in by hand using a red pen; this 
is known as “red-lining” a drawing. It is important that only one set 
of approved drawings be kept with red lines so that changes are kept 
for later drawing updates.
Mechanical drawings are often created in a three-dimensional 
software package but plotted to two-dimensional three-view 
drawings for fabrication. Like electrical drawings, changes may be 
red-lined by machinists or assembly technicians for later update. 
Mechanical drawings may be released on a wide variety of page sizes, 
depending on the complexity and size of the component or assembly. 
It is also common for a computer with a three-dimensional viewing 
software package installed for machine assembly to be present in the 
assembly area of a plant.
GD&T
Mechanical drawings are dimensioned using arrows and extension 
lines with tolerances in a fairly standard format, but for precision 
components or production parts additional information may be 
required. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) uses a 
symbolic language on engineering drawings to define and communicate 
the nominal or theoretically perfect geometry of a part and its 
components along with the allowed variation. It also defines the possible 
variation in form and often describes the function of the part. It may 
describe the allowable variation in orientation and location between the 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
39
features of a part. This is done using a datum reference, which is a 
theoretical ideal plane, line, point, or cylinder. A datum feature is a 
physical feature of the part identified by a datum feature symbol and 
corresponding datum feature triangle as shown in Fig. 2.14.
These are then referred to by one or more datum feature references, 
which indicate measurements should be made with respect to the 
corresponding datum feature and may be found in a datum reference 
frame.
The standard in the United States for GD&T is the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standard Y14.5–2009. It 
provides a fairly complete set of standards within one document and 
is intended to describe the engineering intent for parts and assemblies. 
Other standards such as those issued by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) vary slightly from Y14.5 and address one 
topic at a time. There are separate standards that provide the details 
for each major symbol and topic such as position, flatness, profile, 
and others.
GD&T is typically not used for design of automation machinery 
unless many machines must be built exactly the same way or precision 
manufacture of parts requires it. It is, however, used in the parts an 
automated machine may produce or assemble, so it is worth 
mentioning here. GD&T is used extensively in the automotive and 
production parts industries.
2.7.2 Other Design Packages and Standards
A variety of other documentation tools are used in specific industries, 
a few of which are described below.

P&ID
A piping and instrumentation diagram/drawing (P&ID) is a diagram 
used primarily in the process industry that shows the piping of the 
process flow together with the installed equipment and instrumentation. 
It is defined by the Institute of Instrumentation and Control as follows:
1. A diagram that shows the interconnection of process 
equipment and the instrumentation used to control the 
process. In the process industry, a standard set of symbols is 
used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument 
symbols used in these drawings are generally based on 
International Society of Automation (ISA) Standard S5. 1.
2. The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a process 
control installation.
Figure 2.15 shows how a P&ID diagram for a simple spray booth 
might look.
P&IDs play an important role in the documentation, 
maintenance, and modification of the process that they describe. 
During the design stage, the diagram provides a basis for the 
development of system control schemes. It allows the visualization 
of the sequence of equipment and systems and their interconnections 
both electrically and mechanically. Though used primarily in the 
process and instrumentation fields, P&IDs can be useful as a 
method of communication between mechanical and electrical

further safety and operational investigations, such as for a hazard

systems, devices, and line styles is generally included in the drawing 
package. A few are shown in Table 2.2 for reference.

Adobe Acrobat and pdf Files
As software became more varied and new vendors appeared, methods 
were developed to convert files from one platform to another or 
present them in a common form. One of these is the Adobe Acrobat 
pdf reader and writer. This allows forms and documents to be printed 
to a reduced-size file that can be opened by anyone with a reader 
program installed on their computer.
The reader software can be downloaded for free off the Internet 
from the Adobe web site. Drivers to allow a file to be printed to a pdf 
document have also been created by a number of other developers. 
Typically these small programs are available for free or for a nominal 
charge after a free evaluation period.
A pdf writer is a bit more expensive and allows pdf files to be 
combined and modified from their native format. Since pdf files are 
similar to a picture of a document rather than the native document 
itself, it is not as easily formatted or changed once it has been 
converted outside text or other content. Pdfs have become one of the 
most common methods of publishing user manuals and other 
manufacturing 
documentation 
because 
of 
their 
widespread 
availability and smaller file size.
2.7.3 Image File Formats
As part of the documentation process, images or pictures are usually 
imported into documents. Image file formats are standardized means 
of organizing and storing digital images. There are a great many 
different types of image file used in documentation, but many can 
easily be converted from one into another by either shareware or 
vendor-specific software installed with printers or drawing packages.
Image files are composed of either vector-based geometric data 
converted to pixels by rasterization on a graphic display or files made 
up of the pixels themselves. An example of vector data is an AutoCAD 
drawing as described previously. The two main families of graphics 
are generally divided into raster (or pixel) and vector.
Pixels that constitute an image are ordered as a grid of rows and 
columns. Each pixel consists of numbers representing its grid 
location, magnitude of brightness and/or color, and possibly even 
elements such as transparency. The more numbers associated with 
each pixel, the larger an image file becomes. The greater the number 
of rows and columns becomes, the higher the image’s resolution. 
Also each pixel increases in size as its color depth increases. An 8-bit 
or 1-byte pixel stores 256 colors or shades of black and white, while 
a 24-bit (3-byte) pixel stores 16 million colors. This is also known as 
truecolor.
Algorithms are often used to reduce the size of an image file. 
Higher-resolution cameras can produce huge image files of many 
megabytes. Not only may the image itself have a high resolution, but 
when using truecolor a 12-megapixel image can occupy 36,000,000 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
43
bytes of memory! Since a digital camera needs to store many images 
to be practical, various image file formats have been developed, 
primarily for reasons of image storage both within the camera and on 
a computer.
Other formats containing both raster and vector information also 
exist called metafiles. These files are application independent and are 
often used as a transfer medium from one application or software 
program to another. These are often known as intermediate formats, 
an example is the Windows metafile or .wmf, which can be opened 
by most Microsoft Windows–based applications. Another classification 
of formats that describes the layout of a printed page is “page 
description languages.” Examples of this are PostScript, PCL, and the 
previously described pdf file from Adobe.
Including proprietary file types, there are hundreds of image file 
extensions. Following are just a few of the more common ones.
JPEG Files
JPEG or .jpg files are created by a compression method as described 
previously. The images are usually stored in the JPEG File Interchange 
Format, or JFIF. The algorithm produces relatively small files because 
it only supports 8 bits per color (red, green, and blue) for a 24-bit 
total. The resolution can also be reduced, and, as long as it is not by 
too much, the compression does not detract noticeably from the 
image quality. JPEG files do suffer from degradation when repeatedly 
edited and saved. Most digital cameras can save images in the .jpg 
format, many pdf generators also use it as their image compression 
algorithm.
TIFF Files
TIFF or. tif files are not as commonly used as JPEGs but are more 
flexible. They can be used to save files with either 8 or 16 bits per 
color in red, green, and blue for 24- and 48-bit pixels. They can be 
either “lossy” or lossless depending on the algorithm used. TIFFs 
can offer a good lossless compression for black-and-white (bi-level) 
images.
TIFF images are often used by optical character recognition (OCR) 
software packages to generate monochrome images for scanned text 
pages. Because of the flexibility of the format, there are few if any 
readers that can read every type of TIFF format that exists. Web 
browsers also do not support this format as commonly as with 
JPEGs.
PNG Files
The Portable Network Graphics (PNG or .png) file format is an 
excellent choice for editing pictures. It was created as a patent-free 
successor to the GIF file and is open source. Unlike the GIF format, 
it supports truecolor. Because of this, the file sizes are larger, but 

44 
C h a p t e r  T w o
this format is optimum for images with large areas of the same 
color.
PNG is designed to work well online as it has a method of 
interlacing images that offers an early preview of an image even 
when only a small portion has been transmitted. It allows full 
streaming capability for online viewing applications like web 
browsers. It is also considered a very robust format since it checks for 
transmission errors and provides full file integrity.
GIF Files
The GIF or Graphics Interchange Format is commonly used for 
storing simpler graphics such as shapes, logos, and diagrams. The 
files are small because colors are limited to an 8-bit or 256-color 
palette. The format is often used for image animation but is not as 
effective for detailed images. It is one of the most common compression 
methods along with the JPEG.
BMP Files
The Windows Bitmap (BMP) or .bmp file is an uncompressed format 
that handles graphics within Microsoft’s operating system. Because 
they are very large since they are not compressed, they are often 
converted to other formats for storage, but they are useful since they 
can be edited at the pixel level. They are often used within HMI 
programming software for graphic objects.
Vision systems and smart cameras also do not typically compress 
their image files so the files can be saved and analyzed as bitmaps. 
Since features are often quite small and may be analyzed to a sub-
pixel level when measuring, machine vision images are generally left 
uncompressed, making this an excellent format for this purpose. 
Figure 2.16 shows a bitmap obtained from a vision system inspecting 
parts on a conveyor. The center part has been captured and processed 
by the camera to highlight and count the holes in the component.
2.8 Safety
When designing machinery for automated processes, one of the most 
important factors to consider is the safety of the personnel who will 
be using the equipment. Of secondary importance is the protection of 
the machinery itself. Because of the movement of machine components, 
hot surfaces, caustic substances, and sharp edges all pose potential 
dangers to exposed personnel. Because of this, many standards and 
regulations have been established as guidelines for the design of 
safety systems.
Each country and region has its own standards concerning safety, 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and RF emissions. Though 
the European Union (EU) directives only specifically apply to member 
states, since the European countries are a major customer of most 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
45
companies, these companies find it necessary to comply with European 
regulations by obtaining CE marking, indicating compliance.
In 1995 a law was passed applying to all machinery built for use 
in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA). The law mandates 
that machine builders comply with the Machinery Directive on safety 
and indicate compliance by placing CE marking on their machinery. 
CE stands for Communate’ Europe’ene, or European Community. 
Although this directive is European in origin, since components are 
sourced from around the world and the final destination of a product 
may not be known to the manufacturer, these regulations impact 
companies everywhere.
The Machinery Directive applies to machines functioning as a 
whole unit as well as interchangeable equipment modifying the 
function of a machine. It is a comprehensive set of rules applying to 
safety and is officially referenced as 89/392/EEC. These requirements 
cover every aspect of the machine: mechanical design, electrical 
design, controls, safety, and the potential for the machine to create 
hazardous situations. While the directive discusses controls and 
safety components, it only does so in the context of designing a safe 
machine as a whole.
The directive states that most manufacturers can self-certify, 
clearly stating exceptions. Some confusion arises when designers 
assume that this means if they are using components with CE 
FIGURE 2.16 Machine vision bitmap.

46 
C h a p t e r  T w o
marking, then their machines will meet CE requirements; this is not 
true. CE marking on a control component usually indicates compliance 
with the Low Voltage or Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive; 
this is an entirely different set of regulations. A similar analogy would 
be assuming that just because UL-listed components are used in a 
control panel that the panel meets UL requirements. To create a UL-
approved panel, components must be wired and installed using an 
acceptable methodology, the National Electric Code. CE marking of 
machinery follows a similar reasoning.
Self-certification of equipment involves the examination of standards 
(types A, B, and C; applies to various aspects of safety by classification of 
machinery). Machinery is then tested against the requirements and 
“information for use” documentation is generated. If self-certification is 
allowed, a Declaration of Conformity is signed and the CE marking is 
affixed to the equipment. If self-certification is not permitted according 
to the Machinery Directive, an “EC Type Examination” is submitted for.
EN regulations or “European Norms” state the specific requirements 
of the directives. The key standards for clarification are EN-292–1 and 
EN-292–2, Safety of Machinery. EN-292 provides machine designers 
with basic concepts and terminology of machine safety, including 
safety critical functions, movable guarding, two hand control and trip 
devices, descriptions of hazards, and strategies for risk assessment and 
reduction.
The entire EC Machinery Directive (89/392/EEC) consists of 14 
articles describing the requirements of manufacturers and European 
member states as well as procedures involved in the marking and 
associated documentation. There are also seven “annexes” or 
appendices elaborating on requirements.
China and Japan also have their own safety, RoHS, and RF 
emission and susceptibility standards. In many cases, if equipment 
meets the requirements of CE, it will also meet other countries’ 
standards, but it is always a good idea to check the regulations of the 
country to which equipment is being shipped.
Whenever the potential for injury exists, it must be evaluated and 
safeguarded with at least the minimum required level of protection. 
In the United States, installation and use of machine safety and 
guarding is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA). Some states also have their own safety 
organizations with regulations that must be at least as strict as the 
federal OSHA standards. A great reference for safety-related topics as 
they relate to the industrial workplace is the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) web pages on the Center 
for Disease Control (CDC) web site.
There are a variety of ways to safeguard operators from machine 
hazards. These include emergency stop (E-Stop) circuits, physical 
guarding, Lockout/Tagout, designed mitigation, guard devices, and 
software. In addition, several other agencies have established guidelines 

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
47
that influence safety design. The National Fire Protection Agency 
(NFPA) provides requirements for industrial systems. NFPA 79–07, the 
Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery, is used for design of 
automated systems. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
publishes the B11 standards to provide information on the construction, 
care, and use of machine tools. Since presses, cutting tools, and other 
processes are used in many machines and production lines, these 
standards often apply in addition to OSHA and NFPA regulations.

2.8.1 Hazard Analysis
To determine the level of risk to an operator or other personnel, a 
hazard analysis or risk assessment is performed. Classifications can 
then be made based on the results of the assessment and proper 

48 
C h a p t e r  T w o
remedies applied. In most cases, there is more than one hazard present 
in a system; each must be addressed in the analysis.
In some cases, hazards can be completely eliminated by completely 
automating a process and removing human presence from the 
equation. This is not always possible because of cost or technology 
limits, however, and some risk may have to be accepted. To properly 
evaluate an application, the risk must be quantified. The potential 
consequences of an accident, the likelihood of avoidance, and the 
probability of occurrence must all be considered. Assessment of risk 
is then made by combining these in a matrix. Risks that fall into the 
“unacceptable” category must be mitigated by some means to reduce 
the level of safety risk.
The definitions below are from ANSI/RIA R15.06–1999, Table 1; 
Hazard Severity/Exposure/Avoidance Categories.
Severity:
S1—Slight Injury. Normally reversible, requires first aid as defined 
in OSHA 1904.12.
S2—Serious Injury. Normally irreversible or fatality. Requires 
more than fi rst aid as defi ned in OSHA 1904.12.
Exposure:
E1—Infrequent Exposure. Exposure to the hazard less than once 
per day or shift.
E2—Frequent Exposure. Exposure to the hazard more than once 
per hour.
Avoidance:
A1—Likely. Can move out of the way, sufficient reaction time/
warning, or robot speed less than 250mm/second.
A2—Not Likely. Cannot move out of the way, inadequate reaction 
time or robot speed greater than 250mm/second.
Severity, exposure, and avoidance are assigned a category according 
to the above criteria. A risk reduction category may then be calculated 
using Table 2.3.
This table is a combination of ANSI/RIA 15.06–1999 Tables 2 and 3. 
Using this chart, safeguards may then be chosen based on the results of 
the analysis. Certain task and hazard combinations, such as material-
related tasks that include exposure to sharp parts, thermal, and 
ergonomic hazards, require the application of the highest level of 
feasible safeguarding and fall outside the scope of these tables. 
Appropriate standards and regulations should be consulted.
2.8.2 Emergency Stops
There are three different categories of stop functions: 0, 1, and 2.

to the machine actuators. Category 1 is a controlled stop with power 
to the machine actuators available to achieve the stop; then power is 
removed when the stop is achieved. Category 2 is a controlled stop 
with power left available to the machine actuators. The E-Stop circuit 
is a category 0 stop with only mechanical removal of circuit power 
allowed; that is, no software can be involved.
E-Stop buttons are an important safety component of most types 
of automated equipment. They are designed to allow an operator 
or bystander to stop the equipment quickly should anything go 
wrong.
E-Stop buttons are wired in series with a control circuit on a piece 
of equipment. Pressing the E-Stop button breaks the circuit and 
removes power from the holding relay that keeps the circuit energized. 
If the E-Stop device is a push button, it must be a mushroom-head-
type and be red in color. There is also usually a yellow ring or 
background around the button. Figure 2.17 shows an E-Stop button 
on a control panel; note that the ring is not present in this illustration. 
This would not be acceptable for many safety systems; however, it 
often occurs on OEM equipment.
An E-Stop device does not have to be a push button, it may be a 
cable pull device or a guard door switch.
To energize the E-Stop control circuit, the operator presses the 
reset button. This provides power momentarily to a relay coil. The 
FIGURE 2.17 E-Stop push button.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
51
relay is often called a master control relay (MCR) or master safety 
relay (MSR). As the relay coil is energized, it closes its normally open 
contact so that power is provided through the relay contact to both 
the relay coil and the load. The load may be the power that feeds 
output cards or any other device that is hazardous. The power that is 
provided to the load is known as switched power.
As long as the relay is energized, the circuit is complete and power 
is provided to the load. Pressing the stop or E-stop button breaks the 
circuit, allowing the relay to return to its normally open position.
There are several degrees of reliability defined for E-stop circuits; 
simple, single channel, single channel monitored, and control reliable, 
which includes dual channel monitored circuits. Figure 2.18 illustrates 
a simple and a control reliable (monitored) circuit.
2.8.3 Physical Guarding
Physical guarding of a hazard is the simplest method of safety. A 
cover or other physical barrier is interposed between the hazard and 
the operator. The cover must be removed using a tool, or, if it is 
hinged as with a door, it must have a safety switch. Safety switches 
are available with locking mechanisms that are only released with an 
E-Stop condition if required by the safety and hazard analysis.
Mesh guarding is often used around machinery, allowing visibility 
into the machine. The size of the openings in the mesh is dependent 
on the distance from the hazard and the size of an operator appendage, 
such as a finger or arm. Figure 2.19 shows a mesh guard around an 
operating robot.
Hazard warnings and signage are required on machinery 
wherever hazards such as pinch points or electrical hazards exist. The 
symbols and colors for these signs are standardized and should not 
be created by individuals, but rather purchased from the appropriate 
vendor.
2.8.4 Lockout/Tagout
It should be noted that E-Stop systems cannot be used for energy 
isolation in a Hazardous Energy Control Procedure, or lockout. 
Devices for this purpose must physically separate the energy source 
from the downstream components. There are a number of requirements 
describing how branch fusing is applied, but all stand-alone machines 
must have a disconnect that removes power from the entire machine.
Disconnects are usually designed with a feature that allows a 
lockout device (usually a lock or a metal assembly that allows several 
locks to be inserted) to lock the disconnect in the deenergized position. 
A tag is then attached to each lock with the person’s name who the 
lock belongs to and the date. Lockout/tagout is used whenever power 
needs to be removed from a machine or system for maintenance or 
when someone might be exposed to electrical power.

Disconnects are often designed with a mechanism that prevents the 
opening of an electrical enclosure with the disconnect in the on position. 
Defeater mechanisms that allow the door to be opened with power 
applied using a tool are also often part of the disconnect design.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
53
2.8.5 Design Mitigation
Another method of hazard reduction is by designing safety into the 
machine or system. An example might be rounding corners or placing 
moving parts and actuators in locations not easily accessible to 
personnel. This is usually the lowest-cost solution and a good designer 
will take this into account. Use of “finger-safe” terminal blocks and 
rubber bumpers or pads are examples of reducing exposure.
2.8.6 Guard Devices
There are many types of guard devices designed for safety 
applications. Some of the most common are light curtains and safety 
floor scanners. Nearly all of these devices are designed for use with 
control reliable (dual channel monitored) safety circuits. To accomplish 
this, circuit devices such as safety relay controllers monitor the 
actuation of the safety contacts with respect to the status of the 
received light beams. Light curtains are usually specified by the 
length of the covered area and the pitch or distance between beams. 
When specifying a light curtain, it is important to base the distance of 
FIGURE 2.19 Mesh guarding of a robot.

54 
C h a p t e r  T w o
the hazard to the guarding device on the reaction time of the safety 
circuit and its ability to stop motion before an operator can reach the 
hazard. There are software programs and testing mechanisms available 
to estimate appropriate distances and verify effectiveness of devices.
Figure 2.20 shows a 12-in quick disconnect light curtain.
Floor scanners and light curtains can also be “muted” to disregard 
areas of the curtain or covered area. This may be done on a permanent 
basis, such as teaching a floor scanner where fixed objects such as 
conveyor legs are, or conditionally, such as when an operator must 
enter a guarded area during normal operation. These types of circuits 
may also be automatically reset when the obstruction is removed. 
Typically this is done with a sensor such as a photo-eye sensing when 
an object is moving through the safety zone along a predefined path, 
such as an object on a conveyor.
Other types of safety devices are commonly used in guards circuits. 
Safety mats sense the weight of an operator and disable hazardous 
motions while the weight is present. Safety switches monitor the 
position of a door or gate that allows personnel access to a hazardous 
area. These types of sensors are often connected in a separate circuit 
from the E-Stops to allow an automatic reset. Circuit diagrams for guard 
circuits resemble those of safety circuits, removing power from output 
devices while personnel are located within the guarded area.
FIGURE 2.20

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
55
A rapidly emerging component of safety systems is the safety 
controller. Whereas many safety devices and circuits must be 
hardwired and redundant, safety controllers allow logic functions to 
be included in the circuit without having to use relays and timers. 
Safety controllers may take the form of a “Safety PLC,” where logic is 
programmed in ladder logic, or as a generic safety controller 
programmed by function selections and simple code. All safety 
controllers must meet the requirements of the Machinery Directive 
on safety, a European standard indicating compliance with CE.
Safety controllers provide a method of consolidating guard door 
switches, E-Stops, robot- and servo-enabled inputs into one control 
point. This allows circuits to be separated and prioritized while still 
meeting safety standards.
2.8.7 Software
In addition to the hardware methods described previously, additional 
steps must be taken to ensure software compliance with safety 
requirements. Hazard analyses for software are performed to identify 
potential hazards that may be caused by or prevented by programming. 
For software that controls or monitors potentially hazardous functions, 
the industry “best practices” for conducting a software safety hazard 
analysis are prescribed in IEEE STD-1228–1994, Software Safety Plans.
Like the ANSI hazard classifications described previously, the 
severity of the consequences establishes the criticality level of the 
software. Criticality levels are assigned from A to E; Catastrophic 
to No Safety Effect. The A and B levels require higher levels of rigor 
within the affected software task.
Analysis of software for risks must be performed by peers of the 
programmer or people knowledgeable of the programming language. 
Templates and programming standards also usually structure 
programs in such a way that conditions may be self-monitoring. An 
example might be ensuring that extended and retracted proximity 
sensors cannot be active at the same time or that a photo-eye is 
blocked only once during every cycle.
Built-in self-test (BIST) is often mandated for software programs. 
This may be a routine that checks an unattended machine to discover 
whether it needs maintenance or repair or perhaps determines whether 
a machine may be safely started. This is most common in military or 
computer applications but is sometimes seen in PLC and DCS 
programming.
Machine faults or alarms are created whenever safety devices are 
tripped or inappropriate conditions such as those described previously 
are detected. These faults may then deactivate or retract actuators to 
protect personnel, machine hardware, or products. Faults and alarms 
may trigger cycle or immediate stop commands or remove pneumatic 
force from a machine using an “air dump” valve or piloted check 

56 
C h a p t e r  T w o
valves. In some cases, power may be removed from wired output 
terminals when a fault is detected.
2.8.8 Intrinsic Safety
When controls and instrumentation must be operated in hazardous 
environments such as explosive or flammable atmospheres, a 
protection technique known as intrinsic safety (IS) may be applied. In 
normal use, electrical equipment often creates internal tiny sparks in 
switches, motor brushes, connectors, and in other places. Such sparks 
can ignite flammable substances present in air. A device termed 
intrinsically safe is designed to not contain any components that 
produce sparks or that can hold enough energy to produce a spark of 
sufficient energy to cause an ignition.
Originally the IS concept was developed for process control 
instrumentation in hazardous areas such as gas platforms. The idea 
behind the application of IS is to ensure that the available thermal and 
electrical energy in an exposed environment is low enough that ignition 
of an explosive or flammable atmosphere cannot occur. IS barriers 
ensure that only low voltages and currents are present within the 
hazard area. Electrical signal and supply wires are protected with a 
Zener diode or galvanic isolation circuit within the barrier. Figure 2.21 
is an example of several DIN-rail mountable IS barriers.
In the use of these barriers, a low-voltage (typically under 8VDC) 
device or sensor is connected to the field side of the barrier and the 
other side is wired into the standard inputs of a controller (typically 
24VDC). The barriers are then located outside the hazardous area.
FIGURE 2.21 Intrinsically safe barriers. (Courtesy of Pepperl+Fuchs.)

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
57
Namur sensors are two wire sensors that change resistance when 
a target approaches the sensor. Namur is a German association that 
represents the users of measurement and control technology in the 
chemical industry. They standardized the use of intrinsically safe 
sensors typically used with barriers. When a Namur sensor “sees” a 
target, the resistance goes from low to high. This is opposite to the 
action of a conventional limit switch, where normally the resistance 
goes from high (infinity) to low (connected) when the switch is 
activated. This characteristic causes confusion frequently. They require 
an interface such as an intrinsically safe barrier that has a selection 
switch on the front that is used to reverse the action of the output relay 
contacts. This makes it behave like a limit switch (note that the action 
of the relay is reversed, not the action of the sensor). These sensors 
comply with European Standard EN 60947–5-6 (formerly EN 50227).
In the application of IS techniques, there are other considerations, 
such as abnormal component temperature. A short circuit inside a 
small component on a circuit board can cause the thermal energy 
within the immediate area to be much higher than during normal 
use. Current limiting by using resistors and fuses in branch circuits 
can be used to prevent autoignition of a combustible atmosphere.
Explosion-proof housings are also used to contain a fire or 
explosion within a confined area. These enclosures are usually sealed 
with multiple bolts through a removable cover, and special conduit 
is used to bring wiring to the device. These housings are often used 
in applications where non-IS devices or instrumentation must be 
used.
Chemical and petrochemical facilities are major users of IS devices 
and products. Grain processors and storage silos are also major users 
because of the flammable and explosive nature of organic dust.
Many sensor and device manufacturers have products designed 
for use in hazardous areas either with a barrier or as a self-contained 
unit. A well-known manufacturer of both intrinsically safe barriers 
and devices is the German company Pepperl+Fuchs. Further 
information can be found in their product literature.
2.9 Overall Equipment Effectiveness
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a method of monitoring 
and improving the effectiveness of manufacturing processes. 
Individual machines, manufacturing cells, and assembly lines all 
benefit from this lean manufacturing and total productive maintenance 
technique. OEE and productivity display screens are a common 
feature found on control system HMIs for machinery.
OEE takes the most common and important sources of 
manufacturing productivity loss, places them into three categories, 
and applies metrics to allow evaluation of the process. OEE evaluation 
and analysis begins with the amount of time that a production line is 

58 
C h a p t e r  T w o
available for operation. This time is referred to as plant or line 
operating time. From this number a time category is subtracted called 
planned shutdown. This consists of all events that should be excluded 
from the OEE calculation because there is no intention of running the 
line. Examples of this include lunch and other breaks, scheduled 
maintenance, holidays, and periods of time when there is no product 
available to process. The time remaining after subtracting shutdown 
time from operating time is called planned production time.
In automated systems when a machine is in auto-run mode with 
no faults but is not running (often because of lack of operator-
introduced material or operator stoppages), time is logged as “idle 
time.” Machine builders often exclude this time from the downtime 
calculations during machine runoffs or factory acceptance tests (FATs) 
since they may be held to a minimum OEE for machine acceptance. 
Since operator-induced downtime is an important source of waste or 
“Muda,” it should be included in the OEE calculation. Idle time may 
have to be discussed as a separate issue during runoffs if it is deemed 
to be excessive.
2.9.1 Availability
To determine the availability of equipment, efficiency and productivity 
losses are determined and analyzed. The first category of loss that is 
considered is downtime loss. This time is composed of any event that 
stops production for enough time to log an event. This can vary 
depending on whether events are logged automatically through the 
control system or by hand using an operator. Downtime includes 
such causes as equipment failure or faults, material shortages or 
“starvation,” and changeover time. Faults and material shortages can 
be eliminated completely in an ideal situation, while changeover time 
should be minimized.
After subtracting downtime from planned production time, the 
remaining available time is called operating time. This can also be 
expressed as a percentage by dividing the operating time by the 
planned production time and multiplying by 100.
 
Availability % = (operating time/planned production time) × 100
(2.2)
2.9.2 Performance
Machinery is designed to operate at an optimum speed. With no 
human involvement, this is usually fairly easy to calculate by 
evaluating a machine’s operation under perfect conditions or looking 
at the speed of individual components within a system. Factors such 
as machine wear and tear, nonconforming product, operator 
inefficiency, and product misfeeds can all contribute to reducing a 
machine’s designed ideal rate.

I m p o r t a n t  C o n c e p t s  
59
A machine’s net operating time can be determined by subtracting 
downtime due to performance from the operating time that was 
determined previously. This can be difficult in an automated 
environment, so performance is often expressed as a percentage. 
A machine’s or line’s production output can be divided by its ideal 
output to determine a speed loss percentage. This can then be used to 
calculate downtime due to performance causes.
Performance % = [(ideal cycle time × total pieces)/operating time] × 100
(2.3)
2.9.3 Quality
The quality of a process is determined by subtracting reject or 
defective parts from the total number of parts produced. The result 
can then be used to calculate a percentage of losses due to quality 
issues. This includes parts that have to be reworked.
Rejects can further be divided into losses that are incurred because 
of start-up activities and those that are truly bad parts. Activities like 
warm-up, splices, and setup errors should be differentiated from true 
failed parts. The goal of OEE calculation is to improve or eliminate 
causes of downtime and waste, so division of root causes into as 
many categories as possible can be useful.
 
Quality % = (good parts/total parts) × 100 
(2.4)
2.9.4 Calculating OEE
The results of the availability, performance, and quality calculations 
can be multiplied to determine overall machine OEE.
 
OEE = availability × performance × quality 
(2.5)
Improving overall OEE is an important goal, but cannot be looked 
at so simply. For instance, few companies would trade a 5 percent 
improvement in availability for a 3 percent increase in rejects, even 
though the overall OEE would be better. All factors contributing to 
machine performance should be weighed and evaluated carefully.
Machine HMIs are often programmed with a productivity screen 
accessible from the main screen. Information such as shift times, ideal 
cycle times, and break/no-work times can be set by quality personnel, 
allowing OEE to be calculated and stored in the controller’s memory. 
Data can then be recalled by shift, day, or week and evaluated along 
with downtime due to individual faults, manually logged operator 
events, and other data. Any cause that can be detected automatically 
should be programmed into the controls by category. Causes of 
downtime and reject types can be assigned “reason codes” for later 
evaluation.

2.10 Electrostatic Discharge
When two charged objects come into contact or close proximity with 
each other, a sudden flow of electricity can create a spark or voltage 
spike. This can be caused by a buildup of static electricity or by 
electrostatic induction. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can cause 
damage to sensitive electronic devices, fires, or explosions.
In addition to precautions listed in the IS section of this chapter, 
extra steps must often be taken to prevent ESD-related hazards. For 
electronics manufacturers, even a small discharge that does not create 
a spark can be enough to damage a semiconductor device. When 
working with ESD-sensitive parts, typically everything within a 
specified radius of the part must be grounded. This area is known as 
an electrostatic preventive area (EPA). Parts within the EPA must be 
made of conductive materials such as stainless steel or electroless 
nickel-plated aluminum; certain dissipative plastics may also be 
used. Operators and technicians on the factory floor wear conductive-
soled shoes, and the floor may be painted with conductive or 
dissipative epoxy paint. Conductive wrist and foot straps are often 
required, and electrostatic mats and humidity control are common. 
ESD prevention may extend outside the EPA by using ESD-safe 
packing materials and design techniques for external protection 
components or protection of input and output pins.

CHAPTER 3 
Components and 
Hardware
A
utomated systems use a wide range of mechanical and 
electrical products from a great variety of manufacturers. 
Catalogs from the manufacturer, whether in paper or 
electronic form, can be a great resource for technical information not 
only on the manufacturer’s specific product, but on general control 
and automation techniques.
3.1 Controllers
Controllers provide the computing, calculation, and I/O management 
part of an automation system. They may act as a nucleus or be 
networked together and distributed throughout the system.
3.1.1 Computers
In addition to being used as a tool to write the programs for control 
systems, computers are also used as the actual controller for some 
machines. Computers have the advantage of being relatively low cost 
because of their wide availability. Since computers already have a 
monitor and some sort of pointing device such as a mouse, human-
machine interface (HMI) programs can also be easily implemented 
using standard computers.
Computer operating systems are not usually optimized for 
performing real-time control on machines. Most PC systems run a 
variety of the Microsoft Windows operating system, which by its 
nature contains many components not required or wanted in a control 
system. Because of this, a special platform, Microsoft Windows CE, 
was developed to remove many of the features not required for a 
control system. Windows CE is less memory intensive and component 
based and therefore more appropriate for real-time control. Embedded 
controllers are beginning to use Windows CE as a standard platform.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
3.1.2 Distributed Control Systems (DCSs)
Distributed control systems (DCSs) are often found in process control 
applications such as chemical plants. They are used extensively in 
processes that are continuous or batch oriented. DCSs are connected 
to sensors and actuators and use set point control to control the flow 
of material through the plant. The most common example is a set 
point control loop containing a pressure sensor, controller, and control 
valve. Pressure or flow measurements are transmitted to the controller, 
usually through the aid of a signal conditioning I/O device. When 
the measured variable reaches a certain point, the controller instructs 
a valve or actuation device to open or close until the fluidic flow 
process reaches the desired set point. Large oil refineries have many 
thousands of I/O points and employ very large DCSs. Processes are 
not limited to fluidic flow through pipes, however, and can also 
include things like paper machines and their associated variable 
speed drives and motor control centers, cement kilns, mining 
operations, ore-processing facilities, and many others.
A typical DCS consists of functionally and/or geographically 
distributed digital controllers capable of executing from 1 to 256 or 
more regulatory control loops in one control box. The I/O devices can 
be integral with the controller or located remotely via a field network. 
Another name for this is distributed I/O. Today’s controllers have 
extensive computational capabilities and, in addition to PID control, 
can generally perform logic and sequential control.
A DCS may employ one or several workstations and can be 
configured at the workstation or by an off-line personal computer. 
Local communication is handled by a control network with 
transmission over twisted pair, coaxial, or fiber-optic cable. A server 
and/or applications processor may be included in the system for extra 
computational, data collection, and reporting capability.
3.1.3 Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
Programmable logic controllers (PLCs), are widely used to control 
plant floor automation systems. They are essentially digital computers 
used to control electromechanical processes. PLCs are used in many 
different industries and machines, such as packaging and 
semiconductor machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the 
PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, 
extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and 
resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine 
operation are typically stored in battery-backed or nonvolatile 
memory. A PLC is an example of a real-time system since output 
results must be produced in response to input conditions within a 
bounded time; otherwise unintended operation will result.
The main difference from other computers is that PLCs are 
armored for severe conditions (dust, moisture, heat, cold, and so on) 
and have the facility for extensive I/O arrangements. These connect 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
63
the PLC to sensors and actuators. PLCs read limit switches or other 
sensors, analog process variables (such as temperature and pressure), 
and the positions of complex positioning systems. On the actuator 
side, PLCs operate electric motors, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, 
magnetic relays or solenoids, or analog outputs. The I/O arrangements 
may be built into a simple “brick”-style PLC, or the PLC may have 
digital and analog I/O modules that plug into a PLC rack. Rack-
mounted communication modules can also be used to interface 
remote I/O blocks into the processor. An example of a rack-based 
PLC is shown in Fig. 3.1.
Major PLC manufacturers also sell the software to program their 
platforms. These software packages are specific to the platform; they 
cannot be used on other manufacturers’ hardware. Additional software 
is often necessary to configure network communications and program 
HMIs; this may be packaged in a common software suite.
Prior to the advancement of computer systems, logic would be 
drawn manually using the same techniques as those used to design 
physical relay control systems and then converted into a shorthand 
that could be entered using a handheld keypad or text-based 
computer. As technology advanced, logic could be drawn on a 
computer screen. This was usually still converted into the same 
shorthand and available for documentation. Logic was often still 
printed out in a graphical format also.
Because of memory limitations, descriptive comments for coils, 
contacts, and other instructions were not stored in the PLC memory. 
Symbols could be used to create a reference for these devices, but 
generally they were simply referred to by bit or integer number. 
Memory registers were generally reserved for the type of data that 
was used; bit, word, or floating point values. Timers and counters 
also reserved areas as well as math registers.

In more modern PLCs, memory size is much less of an issue. 
More descriptive tags are allowed to be stored and other methods 
such as structured text and sequential function charts are able to be 
used. Programmers can even use a combination of these and ladder 
logic based on what is most appropriate. Further information on PLC 
software is contained in Chap. 6.
3.1.4 Embedded Controllers and Systems
Embedded systems are special-purpose computing systems that are 
usually designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions, often 
with real-time computing constraints. It is usually embedded as part of 
a complete device including hardware and mechanical parts. In 
contrast, a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer, 
can do many different tasks depending on programming. Embedded 
systems control many of the common devices in use today. Common 
control components of an embedded system are the microprocessor 
or CPU, RAM or random-access memory, and flash memory.
In general, embedded system is not an exactly defined term, as 
many systems have some element of programmability. For example, 
handheld computers share some elements with embedded systems—
such as the operating systems and microprocessors that power 
them—but are not truly embedded systems, because they allow 
different applications to be loaded and peripherals to be connected.
Temperature and Process Controllers
One type of special-purpose controller in wide use is the temperature 
controller. These devices may perform simple on/off heater control 
in reaction to a sensed temperature or control multiple zones using 
PID control. Controllers may be designed for a specific type of 
temperature sensor or configurable by software or dip switches.
Stand-alone temperature controllers are often sized using the 
DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung) system, a German standard. 
They may thus be classified as 1/16 DIN, 1/8 DIN, or 1/4 DIN sizes. 
Timers and counters are also often sized this way. This ensures that 
controllers will fit a certain-size panel cutout. Figure 3.2 shows a 1/4 
DIN panel mount temperature controller. Parameters such as the 
process value (PV) and set value (SV) are displayable in different 
colors for ease of use. Setting of parameters is done using the 
membrane keypad buttons on the front of the controller.
Temperature is not the only parameter that may be controlled by 
a separate controller. Nearly any process variable can be controlled 
using a stand-alone panel-mounted unit. Process controllers can be 
used to control the position of a valve based on flow or pressure; they 
effectively use an input variable to control an output variable as 
shown in Fig. 2.3, a closed-loop feedback system. Process controllers 
physically resemble temperature controllers; the major difference is 
the type of input circuitry.

3.2 Operator Interfaces
Machine operators need to interact with machinery in order to 
activate devices or processes and get status feedback. Historically 
this was done with push buttons, switches, and pilot lights. As 
technology has advanced, these have been replaced with dedicated 
text and graphic displays with membrane push buttons and touch 
screens. Industrial computers with a built-in monitor using a keyboard 
and pointing device such as a mouse are another form of machine 
interface. Computer interfaces with dedicated controllers are also 
widely used. The operator interface includes hardware (physical) 
and software (logical) components. Like the earlier description of 
automated systems, operator interfaces provide a means of:
Input, allowing the user to send signals or data to a system or 
• 
controller
Output, allowing the system to control the effects of the users’ 
• 
manipulation
An operator interface is programmed by means of software on a 
standard computer terminal. The interface should be designed to 
produce a user interface that makes it simple and efficient to operate 
the machinery. The operator should be able to provide minimal input 
FIGURE 3.2 1/4 DIN Temperature Controller. (Courtesy of Omron.)

66 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
to produce the desired result, and the interface should provide only 
the desired information back to the operator. This requires careful 
planning of the screen menu structure and machine representative 
graphics and icons and consistently organized displays for an effective 
interface.
Other terms associated with operator interfaces are MMI (man-
machine interface), HMI, GUI (graphical user interface), and OIT 
(operator interface terminal).
3.2.1 Text-Based Interfaces
Operator interfaces may be text based, simply providing instructions 
or machine status to the operator. They may or may not include 
buttons for input. The displays are typically backlit LCD but may be 
vacuum fluorescent bulbs. LED arrays are also common in larger 
message-only-type displays with a greater viewing distance. 
Individual lights are arranged in a pattern, allowing selected points 
to illuminate in the shape of alphanumeric characters. These may be 
arranged in multiple rows or columns, depending on the required 
message length and size of characters. Figure 3.3 shows production 
data displayed in a workcell. Colors are configurable within each 
field to make the display more readable; it can even be programmed 
for fields to change color based on numerical limits.
3.2.2 Graphical Interfaces
With improvements in technology, it has become standard for 
machines to use graphic interfaces with pictorial representations of 
the machine or production line for diagnostic purposes. These may 
be either monochrome or color and have membrane-type buttons, 
touch screens, or both.
FIGURE 3.3 Text display. (Courtesy of Mills Products.)

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
67
Graphic interfaces are manufactured by most PLC or DCS 
manufacturers and also by third parties who specialize in these 
products. They may use a proprietary operating system or be based 
on a computer platform, such as Microsoft Windows. Software for 
programming these operator interfaces is almost always proprietary 
to the manufacturer. Drivers are generally available for most popular 
controls platforms.
Graphical interfaces provide the ability to create a virtually 
unlimited number of screens and interface objects. Smaller screens 
can be superimposed over larger ones or minimized like the Windows 
operating system.
Faceplates may also be used with a graphical interface. A faceplate 
is an object that contains a standardized arrangement of buttons and 
indicators that may be populated via software with different device 
data. Thus if there are many similar devices, such as motors or 
conveyors, they can all use the same faceplate with their own start 
and stop buttons and status indicators.
3.2.3 Touch Screens
A touch screen is an electronic visual display that can detect the 
presence and location of a touch within the display area. Determining 
the location of a touch requires two measurement values, one on the 
X axis and one on the Y. The term generally refers to touching the 
display of the device with a finger or hand. It enables one to interact 
directly with what is displayed, rather than indirectly with a pointer 
controlled by a mouse, trackball, or touch pad.
Measurements coordinates are in analog form and are generally 
converted using a 10-bit analog to digital converter, providing 1024 
positions in the X and Y directions. Touch points are then passed to a 
computer or HMI microprocessor using serial communication. 
Following are some of the different types of touch screen technologies 
available.
Resistive
Resistive touch screens are made of several layers of material. A hard 
outer surface provides insulation between an operator’s finger and 
the inner conductive materials. Behind this layer are two thin 
electrically conductive layers separated by a small gap or space. The 
gap is separated by an array of very small transparent insulating 
dots; when the outer surface is pressed, the inner layers touch and the 
panel acts as a pair of voltage dividers. This creates electrical currents 
that indicate where the screen was pressed. This data is then sent to 
the controller for interpretation based on the address of the button or 
control that was drawn in that spot.
Resistive touch screens are cost-effective and are often used in 
restaurants and hospitals in addition to factories because of their 
resistance to liquids and other contaminants. A disadvantage of this 

68 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
technology is that it is easily damaged by sharp objects, such as tools. 
It also provides only about 75 percent optical transparency because of 
the extra layers and insulators.
Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)
Touch screens using surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology use a 
glass surface and so are more resistant to sharp objects than resistive 
touch screens. SAW devices consist of two interdigital transducer 
arrays (IDTs) that transmit ultrasonic waves across the surface of the 
screen. Touching the screen surface absorbs a portion of the wave, 
registering the location on the surface. This is sent to the touch screen 
controller for interpretation.
Image clarity using SAW technology is better than that of resistive 
or capacitive touch screens because there are no extra layers between 
the image and the glass. Multiple touched points can also be sensed 
simultaneously. Contaminants on the surface of the screen can interfere 
with the ultrasonic waves, however. Because of the transmitting and 
receiving transducers being exposed along the edges of the screen, 
they are also not completely sealable and can be damaged by large 
amounts of liquids, dirt, or dust. They also must be touched with a 
fairly wide object, such as a finger; a hard stylus will not work.
Capacitive
A capacitive touch screen panel consists of an insulator such as glass 
coated with a transparent conductor. The human body is also an 
electrical conductor, so touching the surface of the screen results in a 
distortion of the screen’s electrostatic field, measurable as a change in 
capacitance. The location is then sent to the controller for processing. 
Unlike a resistive touch screen, one cannot use a capacitive touch 
screen with an electrically insulating material, such as a standard 
glove. A special capacitive stylus or glove with fingertips that generate 
static electricity are sometimes used, but this can be inconvenient for 
everyday use.
There are several different capacitive technologies used for touch 
screens, each with its own cost or technical advantages. Surface 
capacitance technology provides a fairly durable and inexpensive 
product but has limited resolution, is prone to false triggering, and 
needs calibration during the manufacturing process. Projected 
capacitive touch (PCT) screens are more accurate because of a greater 
resolution. The top layer is also glass, making it more impervious to 
sharp objects. Because the conductive layer is etched, the clarity and 
light transmission are reduced, however.
Mutual capacitive touch (MCT) screens have a capacitor at the 
intersection of each row and column. This allows the registration of 
multiple touches to be detected, but these are more expensive than 
surface capacitive screens. Self-capacitive sensors can also be used 
with the same X-Y grid. They provide a stronger signal than the 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
69
mutual capacitance type but cannot resolve more than one finger or 
touch at a time.
Infrared
An infrared touch screen uses an array of infrared LED and photodetector 
pairs around the edges of the screen to detect an interruption in the 
pattern of beams. These LED beams cross each other in a vertical and 
horizontal or X-Y pattern allowing the sensors pick up the exact location 
of the touch. This type of technology can detect nearly any input, 
including a finger, gloved finger, stylus, or pen. It is generally used in 
applications that cannot rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to 
activate the touch screen. Infrared touch screens do not require any 
patterning on the glass, which increases durability and optical clarity of 
the overall system, unlike capacitive or resistive technologies.
Optical Imaging
Optical imaging uses charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors 
similar to a digital camera along with an infrared backlight. An object 
is then detected as a shadow. This can be used to detect both the location 
and the size of the touching object. As the cost of CCD components has 
lowered, this technology has become more popular. It is very versatile 
and scalable, especially for large-screen applications.
Dispersive Signal Technology
This technology uses sensors to detect the piezoelectricity generated 
in the glass due to a touch. Since the mechanical vibrations are used 
to detect the contact, any object can be used to touch the screen. Like 
SAW and optical imaging technologies, since there are no objects or 
etching behind the screen, the optical clarity is excellent. Because of 
the mechanical aspect of the technology, after the initial touch the 
system cannot detect a motionless finger.
Acoustic Pulse Recognition (APR)
Another interesting technology is acoustic pulse recognition (APR). 
Four small transducers along the edges of the screen detect the sound 
of an object hitting the glass. This sound is then compared using a 
lookup table to prerecorded sounds for every position on the glass. 
APR ignores ambient sounds since they do not match the stored 
digitized sounds. Like dispersive signal technology, after the initial 
touch the motionless finger cannot be detected, but the table lookup 
method is much simpler than the complex algorithm used to detect 
the piezoelectric contact.
3.3 Sensors
Sensors provide input data to control systems and can take many 
different forms. Discrete sensors may signal the absence or presence 
of an object or the position of an actuator, while analog sensors may 

70 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
be used to sense pressure, position, or many other physical qualities 
that can be described numerically.
3.3.1 Discrete Devices
Discrete sensors are digital in nature and provide an on or off signal. 
They often come with an attached cable for termination into a control 
cabinet, but they also have a variety of “quick disconnect” (QD) 
cabling options. They are typically available in 24VDC, 120VAC, or 
contact closure (relay) output configurations.
DC sensors use solid-state transistors as a switching method. 
There are two different types depending on the nature of input device 
they are being interfaced with: PNP, or “sourcing,” and NPN, or 
“sinking.” A sourcing sensor provides a positive reference signal to 
an input, or “sources” current. This means that it must be attached to 
a sinking, or NPN-type, input device. The opposite is true for a 
sinking sensor, which is connected to a sourcing input point that 
provides positive-to-negative current flow into the sensor.
QD cables are standardized for sensors; most are of the Micro or 
Pico QD variety. Cables are available in three, four, or five wire varieties, 
depending on the configuration of the sensor. For large devices such as 
light curtains, a QD cable with more conductors is specified.
Buttons, Switches, and Contact Closures
Buttons and switches are used by machine or system operators to 
signal a control system to perform a task or set a state, such as 
automatic or manual control mode. A push button typically has only 
two states, on or off, and may be maintained in each position 
(toggle)—momentary on or momentary off. Most push buttons are 
mechanical in nature and have a set of electrical contacts attached to 
the backside of the button. The contacts may be of the normally open 
(NO) or normally closed (NC) configuration. Some buttons may be 
touch sensitive or capacitive in nature with solid-state or mechanical 
contacts. Figure 3.4 shows schematic symbols for some of these 
different kinds of discrete input devices.
Selector switches may have multiple positions, each with a 
separate contact or group of contacts associated with it. Switches may 
be maintained at each position or spring return, giving the switch a 
“home” position or momentary effect.
Contact closures may also be controlled by the coil of a relay or 
solid-state signal. These are often wired to the inputs of a controller to 
indicate a status or condition. One by-product of using physical 
contacts in an electrical circuit is transients. Whenever a switch is 
opened or closed on an electrical circuit, a spike of voltage is created. 
Current is not interrupted immediately, and a small arc usually forms 
between the contact points. This can have an effect on the contacts 
themselves, causing pitting. It can also create a spark, which can 
cause problems in flammable or explosive atmospheres. If a controller 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
71
is looking for a single change of state on an input, it can sometimes 
detect multiple “bounces” of the contacts due to transients. This can 
cause problems if an input is used as a counter.
Physical devices such as diodes are sometimes used on coils and 
contacts to help minimize these effects, while software “debouncing” 
can be used to ensure pulses are of a specified duration before 
accepting them as valid input. Solid-state devices are also commonly 
used to minimize the effects of transients.
Photo-Eyes
Photoelectric sensors, or photo-eyes, transmit and receive a light 
signal. The sensor changes state when the light changes from being 
received to not being received or vice versa. There are two conditions 
for the output of a photo-eye—Light On, where the output of the 
sensor is energized when light is detected, and Dark On, where the 
sensor output is energized when no light is being received. This is 
usually a selectable parameter with a switch or wire selection.
Photo-eyes are generally available in AC or DC varieties, although 
DC is much more common. DC photo-eye outputs are configured for 
PNP (sourcing) or NPN (sinking) outputs. There are also usually 
indicator lights on the body of the photo-eye for indication of power, 
switching status, or margin (amount of light received).
Usually, photo-eyes use an LED to generate the light signal. A 
lens is typically placed in front of both emitter and receiver to help 
amplify the light signal. The LED may be of various colors in the 
visible light range or in the infrared spectrum, which gives the light a

longer range. Lasers are also often used for precise detection or 
longer-range applications. Visible LEDs are usually red, but green 
or blue are also used in diffuse or color-sensing applications.
When photo-eyes are placed too close together there is the 
possibility that light from one photo-eye’s transmitter will trigger the 
receiver of a different eye. To reduce this possibility, manufacturers 
often modulate the light at different frequencies for different eyes 
within the same product group. Not all photo-eyes have this feature, 
but for those that do, there are typically series numbers or other 
markings that allow the eyes to be differentiated.
In addition to classifying photo-eyes by their output type, there 
are several physical configurations of the sensor.
Through-beam photo-eyes have a separate emitter, which transmits 
the light, and receiver, which receives the signal and controls the 
output state. Figure 3.5 shows this configuration. Because the sensor 
has to have two separate cables terminated for power and signal and 
it has two physical pieces, it is more expensive in both installation 
time and in hardware cost than other configurations. The through-
beam photo-eye has a longer range and is considered to be most 
reliable when detecting the absence and presence of objects.
Retroreflective photo-eyes use a reflective tape or a plastic reflector 
to bounce the light off back into its receiver, as shown in Fig. 3.6. The 
emitter and receiver are both built into the same housing and use a 
common power wire, which reduces cost over the through-beam 
type, but the range is shorter.
To minimize interference from the light bouncing off other 
reflective surfaces, a polarized signal is often used. A corner cube-
type reflector shifts the light 90° before it is received, and only light 
out of phase with the transmitted light is accepted as a signal. This 
allows the gain of the input circuit to be set at a higher level since the

sensor will ignore signals from highly reflective objects that are not 
out of phase.
Diffuse reflective photo-eyes use the object to be detected as a 
target, as shown in Fig. 3.7. Light is transmitted from the emitter and 
received similar to the other configurations; however, the light 
received indicates the presence of a target rather than its absence, as 
with the through-beam and retroreflective configurations. Diffuse 
reflective photo-eyes are not the ideal sensor to use for simple absence 
or presence of an object since the amount of light received is affected 
by the reflectivity and color of the target. This property can, however, 
be used to an advantage when using the sensor to differentiate 
between colors. A red LED signal will reflect much more strongly 
from a red object than from a green object and vice versa. Techniques 
using red, green, blue, yellow, and white LEDs as light sources are 
often used in color detection photo-eyes.
There are also various additional physical configurations for 
photo-eyes. The amplifier that powers the transmitting and receiving

LEDs may be self-contained with lenses or it may have a head for 
attachment of fiber optics; see Fig. 3.8). Fibers may be made of plastic 
or glass. Plastic fibers usually have an opaque plastic cladding around 
the outside the clear inner fiber. This protects the fiber and acts as a 
waveguide for the light to reflect back into the core, keeping the light 
confined. Glass fibers typically can be used in longer-distance 
applications; however, they are more fragile than plastic fibers. Plastic 
fibers can be bent in a tighter radius than glass fibers.
Lenses and right-angle tips are often used for fiber optics. The 
mounting end of fiber-optic cables may also be threaded for use with 
nuts. Plastic fibers may be cut to length using a small cutter that is 
often available from the photo-eye manufacturer. Glass fibers usually 
have factory ends on them to prevent damage and must be purchased 
in the required length.
Proximity Switches
Proximity switches are used to detect the position of an object. While 
photo-eyes are also sometimes referred to as proximity switches, here 
we are discussing inductive, capacitive, limit switch, and Hall effect 
types. Proximity switches are often called proxes for brevity.
Inductive proximity switches are used to detect metal objects. 
A coil of thin wire is energized with a weak current that is connected 
to an oscillating circuit. When a large enough piece of metal enters 
the field created by the current flowing through the coil, the oscillator 
is stalled and a discrete signal is generated, signaling the presence of 
an object. The type of metal being detected strongly influences the 
range of an inductive proximity switch. Metals, such as steel containing 
iron, make the best target, while aluminum reduces the sensing range 
by about 60 percent.
In addition to the PNP or NPN output designation, inductive 
proximity switches are categorized as being shielded or unshielded. 
Shielded proxes have a metal housing all the way up to the sensing 
face of the switch. This reduces the range but allows the sensor to be 
FIGURE 3.8 Fiber-optic amplifi ers.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
75
mounted flush with a metal surface without detecting the metal to 
the side. Unshielded proxes have a longer range since the field 
extends out from the sides of the prox, but are more susceptible to 
damage or interference.
Inductive proximity switches are available in a threaded barrel 
style, a flat surface mount, or various other configurations. Barrel 
proxes typically have a metal housing with a plastic-covered sensing 
surface, but they can be made entirely of stainless steel for ruggedness. 
Figure 3.9 shows a shielded barrel proximity switch sensing a metal 
target block. Note that it is threaded completely into its mounting 
block, indicating that it is shielded.
Capacitive proximity switches use a capacitive sensing surface 
that discharges when an object is placed close to it. As such, it can be 
used to detect nonmetal solid or liquid objects. A common use of 
capacitive proxes is to detect a liquid through the sides of a plastic or 
fiberglass vessel. As long as the vessel walls are fairly thin, the prox 
can be set to detect the difference in mass between an empty and full 
vessel. Capacitive proxes are also sometimes used as operator push 
buttons for ergonomic purposes since they take no pressure to 
activate, unlike mechanical push buttons.
Like the inductive proximity switch, capacitive proxes have a 
very short detection range. They are usually larger than their inductive 
cousins.
Hall effect sensors create a voltage difference based on the amount of 
magnetic field they sense. Hence, they are used to sense magnetic 
objects, such as a magnet moving with a piston inside a cylinder body. 
FIGURE 3.9 Inductive barrel proximity switch.

76 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Any current-carrying conductor creates a slight magnetic field of its 
own, transverse to the direction of current flow. With a known magnetic 
field, its distance from the Hall plate can be determined. This makes 
Hall effect sensors a great choice for end-of-cylinder stroke sensors 
since they can sense the magnet through a metal (typically aluminum) 
body. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.10; inside the aluminum body of the 
Festo cylinder is a magnet attached to the cylinder’s piston head. These 
electromagnetic transducers are used for proximity switching, 
positioning, speed detection, and current-sensing applications.
Hall sensors and inductive proximity switches are the most 
common sensors used in detecting cylinder or actuator position. What 
is the major difference between a Hall switch and an inductive prox? 
Essentially, a Hall effect sensor can sense a magnetic field, whereas an 
inductive sensor creates its own magnetic field.
Limit switches are mechanically activated devices that open or 
close electrical contacts when an object contacts it. There are wide 
variety of configurations, sizes, and degrees of ruggedness for limit 
switches. Roller limit switches have a metal or plastic roller that 
allows an object, such as a cam, to slide along the contact point. Lever 
arm and “whisker”-style switches extend the reach of the switch. 
FIGURE 3.10 Hall effect sensor on pneumatic cylinder.

77
Figure 3.11 shows several roller and lever arm switches mounted on a 
rotating display at a trade show; as the arm rotates in the center of the 
display, the lever arms move actuating the internal switch contacts.
Precision limit switches are used to precisely control the actuation 
point of a switch for positioning or measurement. They are typically 
plunger-type switches with a very short stroke.
3.3.2 Analog
Analog sensors produce an output that is proportional to a measured 
property. There can often be offsets and linear errors associated with 
analog sensors that must be taken into account when using the 
resulting measurements, and calibration to a known standard is often 
required. Analog sensors are often known as transducers.
Analog sensors are often used in automated and manual gauging. 
Special-purpose machines are often built around a specific type of 
gauge or group of gauging devices as a test station.
Pressure, Force, Flow, and Torque Sensing
Force can be measured using a variety of devices. One common 
element in measuring the amount of force exerted on an object is a 
strain gauge. Because strain gauge wires are fragile and difficult to 
FIGURE 3.11 Roller limit switches.

78 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
handle, they are typically attached by an adhesive, such as superglue, 
to an insulating flexible backing, such as plastic. As stress is applied 
to the mounted strain gauge, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical 
resistance to change. The resulting resistance change—usually 
measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit—is related to the strain 
by the “gauge factor,” or the ratio of electrical resistance to mechanical 
strain, factoring in temperature, which also plays a small role. This 
circuit is illustrated in Fig. 3.12.
A strain gauge can be configured in a variety of physical packages 
to measure force or weight or to determine vibration and acceleration.
For small strain measurements, semiconductor strain gauges 
known as piezoresistors are preferred because they usually have 
larger gauge factors—or changes in resistance over a range of strain—
than a foil gauge, thus allowing for more accuracy. Downfalls of 
semiconductor gauges include the higher cost, fragility, and greater 
sensitivity to temperature changes.
A load cell is a transducer that converts an input mechanical force 
into a measurable electrical output signal. When weight, or load, is 
applied, the strain gauge deforms, changing the electrical resistance 
of the gauges in proportion to the load. The strain gauge measures 
the deformation, or strain, as an electrical signal as current is passed 
through the gauge element.
In order to ensure maximum sensitivity and account for 
temperature changes, the typical load cell consists of four strain 
gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells with one

strain gauge, a quarter bridge, or two strain gauges, a half bridge, are 
also available.
Because of the small amount of electrical signal output produced, 
typically only in the range of a few millivolts, amplification by an 
instrumentation amplifier is required. The amplified output is then 
fed into an algorithm to calculate and scale the force applied to the 
transducer.
Pressure may be measured by using a piezoresistive strain gauge 
as described previously. The gauge is attached to a force collection 
element, such as a diaphragm, piston, or bellows, and deflection is 
measured proportional to the change in pressure. Absolute, 
differential, gauge, and vacuum pressures can be measured using 
this method. A diaphragm with a pressure cavity can be used to form 
a variable capacitor that is effective in detecting low pressure changes. 
Displacement of the diaphragm can also be measured inductively by 
measuring deflection of a magnet, use of a linear variable differential 
transducer (LVDT), or detection of an induced eddy current. These 
methods are known as electromagnetic pressure sensing. Optical 
methods can also be used by detecting changes in light transmission 
through an optical fiber as it is deformed.
Flow of liquids or gases can be measured in a number of ways. A 
rotary potentiometer (resistive element) is often used when attached 
to a vane that turns in the fluid or gas. Other flow sensors are based 
on devices that measure the transfer of heat caused by the moving 
medium. This principle is common when using microsensors to 
measure flow. Flow meters are related to devices called velocimeters 
that measure velocity of fluids flowing through them. Laser-based 
interferometry is often used for airflow measurement, but for liquids, 
it is often easier to use a physical deformation of some kind to measure 
the flow. Another approach is Doppler-based methods for flow 
measurement. Hall effect sensors may be used on a flapper valve, or 
vane, to sense the position of the vane, as displaced by fluid flow.
Detection of flow and pressure along with the measurement of 
valve positions in the process industry is known as instrumentation. 
Analyzers that detect properties such as acidity, viscosity, or density 
can also be included in this group. Outputs from instrumentation are 
often connected to transmitters, which convert signals into standard 
ranges such as 4 to 20 mA or 0 to 10 V signals.
Commonly, torque sensors or torque transducers use strain gauges 
applied to a rotating shaft or axle. Because of the relative movement 
of the shaft a noncontact means to power the strain gauge bridge is 
necessary, as well as a means to receive the signal from the rotating 
shaft. This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, 
or rotary transformers. Newer types of torque transducers add 
conditioning electronics and an ADC to the rotating shaft (rotor). 
Stator electronics then read the digital signals and convert those 
signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/–10VDC

Color and Reflectivity
As described in the digital sensor section 3.3.1, various colors of LED 
light reflect from different colored materials with varying intensity. 
This property can be used to sample the amount of light returning to 
a receiver and determine color. Combinations of reflected red, green, 
and blue light can be analyzed to determine shades and hues to 
separate items of different color properties. Despite this being listed 
in this current section, color sensors are often “taught” a color and an 
output is then switched if the color is detected.
For more accurate determination of color, a CCD is used to capture 
a colored region. CCDs react to photons, and when a filter called a 
Bayer Mask is placed over the CCD, it becomes a color-sensitive 
device. Red, blue, and green again are the operative colors for color 
CCDs. CCDs are also used to create black-and-white images that can 
be converted to a scale for intensity measurement.
LVDTs
LVDTs are a type of electrical sensor used for measuring linear 
displacement. The transformer-like device has three solenoidal coils 
placed end to end around a tube. The center coil is the primary, and 
the two outer coils are the secondaries. A cylindrical ferromagnetic 
core, attached to the object whose position is to be measured, slides 
along the axis of the tube.
An alternating current is driven through the primary, causing a 
voltage to be induced in each secondary proportional to its mutual 
inductance with the primary. The frequency is usually in the range 1 
to 10 kHz.
As the core moves, these mutual inductances change, causing the 
voltages induced in the secondaries to also change. The coils are 
connected in reverse series, so that the output voltage is the difference 
(hence “differential”) between the two secondary voltages. When the 
core is in its central position, equidistant between the two secondaries, 
equal but opposite voltages are induced in these two coils, so the 
output voltage is 0.
When the core is displaced in one direction, the voltage in one coil 
increases as the other decreases. This causes the output voltage to 
increase from 0 to a maximum. The output voltage is in phase with 
the primary voltage. When the core moves in the other direction, the 
output voltage also increases from 0 to a maximum, but its phase is 
opposite to that of the primary. The magnitude of the output voltage 
is proportional to the distance moved by the core (up to its limit of 
travel), which is why the device is described as “linear.” The phase of 
the voltage indicates the direction of the displacement. Figure 3.13 
illustrates the internal arrangement of an LVDT.
Because the sliding core does not touch the inside of the tube, it 
can move without friction, making the LVDT a highly reliable device.

The absence of any sliding or rotating contacts allows the LVDT to be 
completely sealed against the environment.

Ultrasonics
Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound pulses at a high frequency and 
evaluate the echo received back from the sensor. Sensors calculate the 
time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to 
determine the distance to an object.
Ultrasonic sensors are often used for distance measurement but 
are common in liquid and tank level applications. The technology is 
limited by the shapes of surfaces and the density or consistency of the 
material; for example, foam on the surface of a fluid in a tank could 
distort a reading.
Because of the effect of the air medium on the speed of sound on 
the signal, ultrasonic sensors are not particularly repeatable or precise; 
however, they can be used over fairly long distances and tend to have 
a smoothing or averaging effect when measuring irregular or moving 
surfaces.
Distance and Dimensions
Photoelectric sensors, proximity switches, LVDTs, ultrasonics, and 
encoders can all be used to measure distance and dimensions.
With optical sensors such as photo-eyes, the property of reflectivity 
can be used to determine the relative distance of an object from the 
Voltage Source

sensor. As an object moves farther away, the amount of light received 
by the sensor becomes less. The color of the target also has an effect 
on the received signal, however, so optical distance measurement is 
best used on a consistent target. Laser-based devices can be used 
similarly to LED photoelectrics with longer range and less dependence 
on color.
Rows of LEDs or lasers that can measure dimensions based on the 
number of beams broken or the amount of light received and CCD-
based devices that can measure distances accurately are other usable 
optical methods. These methods do not depend on reflectivity and 
can be used to measure nearly any object as long as it is not too large. 
Techniques using precision tooling and physical contact with the 
target such as LVDTs are also commonly used where contact with 
the target is feasible.
For longer-distance strokes LVDTs may not offer enough accuracy 
for an application. An excellent option for measuring distance is time-
based magnetostrictive position sensing. Magnetostriction uses a 
ferromagnetic measuring element known as a waveguide, along with 
a movable position magnet. The magnet generates a direct-axis 
magnetic field within the waveguide. When a current or “interrogation 
pulse” is passed through the waveguide, a second magnetic field is 
created radially around the guide. The interaction between the two 
fields generates a strain pulse that travels at a constant speed from its 
point of generation at the magnet (the measuring point) to the end of 
the waveguide. A sensor detects the pulse and generates a highly 
accurate positional reading through the electronics of a high-speed 
counter.
Magnetostrictive sensors provide an absolute position reading 
that never needs recalibration or homing after a power loss. This can 
be a significant advantage over using LVDTs and encoders. The only 
limitation of this technology is that it cannot be used for short-distance 
dimensional measurements; the minimum range is about 25 mm. 
A well-known manufacturer and the first to develop products using 
this technology is MTS Systems, developer of Temposonics sensors.
Thermocouples and Temperature Sensing
There are a variety of devices that can be used to measure temperature. 
One of the most commonly used is the thermocouple. A thermocouple 
is a junction between two different metals that produces a voltage 
related to a temperature difference. They are inexpensive and 
interchangeable, have standard connectors, and can measure a wide 
range of temperatures. The main limitation when using a thermocouple 
is its accuracy; system errors of less than one kelvin (K) can be difficult 
to achieve.
Any circuit made of dissimilar metals will produce a temperature-
related difference of voltage. Thermocouples for measurement of 
temperature are made of specific alloys, which in combination have a 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
83
predictable and repeatable relationship between temperature and 
voltage. This relationship is not linear, however, and the voltage 
curve must be linearized in the input instrument. Temperature loop 
controllers contain linearization algorithms for the most common 
types of thermocouples. Selection of the thermocouple type can be 
made by setting dipswitches or software parameters.
Different alloys are used for different temperature ranges and to 
resist corrosion. Where the measurement point is far from the 
measuring instrument, the intermediate connection can be made by 
extension wires, which are less costly than the materials used to make 
the sensor itself. Thermocouples are standardized against a reference 
temperature of 0°C; instruments then use electronic methods of cold-
junction compensation to adjust for varying temperature at the 
instrument terminals. Electronic instruments also compensate for the 
varying characteristics of the thermocouple within the linearization 
algorithm and help improve the precision and accuracy of 
measurements. An example of a thermocouple is shown in Fig. 3.14; 
the probe at the bottom is the sensing element inside a protective 
“well,” while the container at the top is the head, which contains the 
termination points for the thermocouple wire.
FIGURE 3.14  
Thermocouple.

84 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Thermocouples are widely used in science and industry; a few 
applications would include temperature measurement for kilns and 
injection molding of plastics, measurement of exhaust temperature of 
gas turbines or diesel engines, ovens, and many other industrial 
processes.
The most common type of thermocouple in use is the K 
thermocouple (chromel-alumel). This covers temperature ranges 
from –200°C to 1350°C. It is inexpensive and available in a variety of 
styles. J thermocouples (iron-constantan) are less popular than K 
because of their lower usable temperature range of –40°C to 750°C. 
Other types of thermocouple include E, N, B, R, S, T, C, M, and 
chromel-gold/iron. A table for the different types of thermocouples is 
located in App. F.
One note on thermocouple polarity: there is a polarity labeled + 
and – for connection to input terminals. Counter to the common 
thought that the red wire is positive in many DC circuits, red is always 
the negative lead for thermocouples. Not every thermocouple pair 
has a red wire, but when using the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) color code, the red lead will always be negative.
Thermistors are a type of resistor with resistance proportional to 
its temperature. Thermistors are usually made of a ceramic or polymer 
material. They have a high precision over a limited temperature 
range, typically –90°C to 130°C.
Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) also change resistance 
proportionally with temperature, but are made of pure metals. They 
are useful over a wider temperature range than thermistors but are 
less accurate. RTDs and thermistors may both be used with standard 
analog inputs and an excitation voltage because of their linearity, 
unlike thermocouples, which must use a special input to linearize the 
signal.
Infrared thermocouples or infrared temperature sensors are used as 
noncontact methods of sensing temperature. They use the thermal 
emission from the target to scale temperature to a readable value. 
They are usually manufactured to be used in place of a J- or K-type 
thermocouple for convenience.
3.3.3 Special-Purpose Sensors
There are various sensing devices that do not meet the criteria of 
being either digital or analog as they use elements of both.
Encoders and Resolvers
An encoder is a type of transducer that senses position or orientation, 
usually for use as a reference or active feedback to control position. 
Encoders may be rotary or linear, optical or magnetic, analog or 
digital, depending on the type of application.
Rotary optical encoders use a rotating glass or metal disk with 
slots or perforations along the circumference. An LED emits light 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
85
along the path of the slots creating a train of pulses that can be used 
to count or measure distance. Figure 3.15 shows an open-style 
encoder.
Encoders may be open as in the illustration but are usually housed 
in a rugged metal housing with bearings and shaft for attaching to a 
motor with a coupling. The housing is generally watertight and may 
have either a potted cable or a multipin connector for termination.
By placing two sets of slots 90° out of phase with each other, the 
direction of rotation can also be determined. These two signals are 
known as the A and B pulses of the encoder. The inverse of the encoder 
A and B pulses are also often used, commonly known as A not and B 
not. A single slot is also placed along the circumference and is known 
as the Index or Z pulse; this is used for identifying the home or 
reference position of the encoder or device attached to it. This offset A 
and B pulse configuration is known as quadrature. This configuration 
is illustrated in Fig. 3.16.
Encoders are often of the multiturn variety; that is, they will turn 
multiple times, providing a count much higher than the number of 
slots on the disk. This means that the high-speed counter or servo 
module that the encoder is connected to must keep track of the 
number of turns or total count of the pulses. If the power is removed 
from the counter or control system, it is necessary to “home” the axis 
or device attached to the encoder, typically to an external “home” 
sensor and the index pulse.
Absolute encoders use a parallel signal to provide a binary count of 
the position of the encoder. The signal from an absolute encoder gives

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
an unambiguous position within its travel range without requiring 
knowledge of any previous position. This means that the encoder 
will have a fixed range or number of turns. Absolute encoders are 
often used when a system or axis must retain its position even when 
powered off and moved. Absolute and incremental encoders provide 
the same accuracy, but the absolute encoder is more robust to 
interruptions in transducer signal.
Resolvers are also used to detect rotary position and velocity. A 
resolver is best described as a rotating electrical transformer that 
provides a sinusoidal output, which is then converted to a digital 
value representing position. A common type is the brushless 
transmitter resolver. This type of resolver is similar to an electric 
motor in that it has a rotor and stator. The stator portion is made up 
of an exciter winding and two two-phase windings, labeled X and Y. 
These windings are located at 90° angles to each other. When an 
alternating current is induced into the exciter winding, the signal is 
transferred into the rotor windings and then back into the X and Y 
windings. This provides a sine and cosine feedback current, which is 
measured to determine the angle of the rotor. On one full revolution, 
the two feedback signals repeat their waveforms. Because resolvers 
are analog, they effectively have infinite resolution. Figure 3.17 shows 
a cutaway resolver in an industrial housing.
Vision Systems
Also known as machine vision, vision systems apply microprocessor 
or computer-based vision processing to inspection, measurement, 
and guidance tasks. While computer vision is mostly focused on 
image processing, machine vision may also require digital I/O

devices to control other manufacturing equipment. Machine vision is 
used in the inspection of manufactured goods such as semiconductor 
chips, automotive parts, food, and pharmaceuticals. It is also often 
used as a guidance method for robots.
Just as human inspectors working on assembly lines visually 
inspect parts to judge the quality of workmanship, so machine vision 
systems use smart cameras or digital cameras with computer-based 
image-processing software to perform similar inspections. Individual 
characteristics of parts can be assigned parameters to judge on a pass-
fail basis for absence/presence, measurement tolerances, color, 
surface defects, and a number of other visually determined aspects.
Machine vision systems are also programmed to perform simpler 
tasks, such as counting objects on a conveyor, reading serial numbers, 
and measuring parts. Manufacturers favor machine vision systems 
for cases that require high-speed, high-magnification, 24-hour 
operation, and/or repeatability of measurements. Vision systems are 
more consistent than human beings because of distraction, illness, 
and other physical or mental limitations; humans are better at making 
finer qualitative judgments and adapting to new undefined defects.
Computers do not “see” in the same way human beings do. 
Cameras are not equivalent to human optics. Computing devices see 
by examining the individual pixels of images, processing them, and 
attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge 
FIGURE 3.17 Resolver.

bases and features, such as pattern recognition engines. Although 
some machine vision algorithms have been developed to mimic 
human visual perception, no machine vision system can yet match the 
capabilities of human vision in terms of image comprehension, 
tolerance to lighting variations, image degradation, and part variability.
A number of unique processing methods have been developed to 
process images and identify relevant image features in an effective 
and consistent manner. Among these are various line, circular, or area 
tools to detect edges or count pixels within a defined intensity or 
brightness range; “blob” tools to identify patterns or shapes of a 
certain size; and color and text recognition tools.
A typical machine vision system will consist of several of the 
following components:
A digital or analog camera (black-and-white or color) with 
1. 
optics for acquiring images.
Camera interface for digitizing images (widely known as a 
2. 
“frame grabber”). This converts the image to a digitized 
format, typically a two-dimensional array of intensity values. 
This is then placed in memory for analysis by the software 
algorithms.
A processor (often a PC or embedded processor, such as a 
3. 
digital signal processor [DSP]).
I/O hardware (digital I/O) or communication links (usually 
4. 
a network or RS-232 connection) to report results.
A lens to focus the desired field of view onto the image sensor.
5. 
Suitable, often very specialized, light sources (LED 
6. 
illuminators, fluorescent or halogen lamps, direct on-axis, 
and others). The lighting is designed to enhance or highlight 
certain features while obscuring or minimizing those that are 
not of interest. Generating or eliminating shadows is one of 
the principal purposes of adding lighting.
A program to process images and detect relevant features.
7. 
A synchronizing sensor for part detection (often a photo-eye 
8. 
or proximity switch) to trigger image acquisition and 
processing. This sensor may also be used to trigger a 
synchronized lighting pulse to freeze a sharp image.
In some cases, some or all of the above are combined within a single 
device, called a smart camera. The use of an embedded processor 
eliminates the need for a frame grabber card and external computer, 
reducing cost and complexity of the system while providing dedicated 
processing power to each camera. Smart cameras are typically less 
expensive than systems made up of a camera and a board and/or 
external computer. Figure 3.18 shows two different types of camera. 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
89
The one on the right is used for reading bar code images. Note the 
adjustable lens on the left camera; this is used to regulate the light 
input and focus the image.
The camera itself typically uses a CCD or CMOS image sensor. 
Both of these devices perform the task of converting light into an 
electrical signal. The array of pixels creates an image by patterning 
the light and dark pattern focused onto the sensor by the optics of the 
camera. The intensity levels are then processed by the software into 
patterns that can be analyzed by the various tools.
Usually the software takes several steps to process an image. First 
the image is processed to reduce noise. It may also convert the many 
analog shades of gray into a simpler combination of black-and-white 
pixels, a process known as binarization. To do this an analog threshold 
is set in the software. After this simplification of the image, software 
can count or identify objects and measure or determine the size of 
patterns and features. The final step is to pass or fail the captured 
image based on the criteria entered by the user. The result is then 
communicated by digital signals or communications to a control 
system that can then act on the information to reject or process the 
part.
Though most machine vision systems rely on black-and-white 
cameras, the use of color cameras is becoming more common. It is 
also increasingly common for machine vision systems to include 
digital camera equipment for direct connection rather than a camera 
and separate frame grabber, thus reducing signal degradation.
X-ray sensors are sometimes used to look inside materials for 
flaws such as cracks or bubbles. When combined with vision 
technology, these sensors can be used for automatic material sorting.

Gas Chromatography
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a method that is 
used in some chemical and process plants as a means of identifying 
and separating substances. This requires that a sample of the substance 
be captured, ionized, accelerated, deflected, and detected at the 
molecular level. The instruments that do this are quite expensive but 
are used in the food and beverage, perfume, and pharmaceutical 
industries.
Bar Codes, RFID, and Inductive ID
A bar code is a method of representing data by putting it into a visible, 
machine-readable format. Originally, bar codes were only represented 
by parallel lines that varied in width and spacing to encode 
alphanumeric data. This is called one-dimensional (1-D) or linear bar 
coding. Two-dimensional methods are also widely used today as the 
reader technology has evolved.
Linear or 1-D readers contain a light source that reflects off the 
black-and-white lines similar to a diffuse photo-eye. The light source 
is generally a red LED or laser. To cover a larger read area, the 
transmitted light will sometimes “raster” or move up and down. 
Figure 3.19 shows a commonly seen linear bar code.
The mapping of patterns into characters is known as a “symbology.” 
This specification includes the coding for the alphanumeric characters 
along with the start and stop characters and computation of a checksum 
(a simple error-detection scheme).
There are more than 30 different 1-D codes in use. Most of these 
fall into two groups, discrete or continuous, depending on whether 
characters begin and end with a bar or not. There are also two-width 
or many-width classifications. Some of the more common symbologies 
are UPC, Code 39, and interleaved 2 of 5. Most 1-D readers can be set 
to read any of the common formats.
FIGURE 3.19 1-D bar code.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
91
Bar codes later evolved into other geometric patterns in two 
dimensions (2-D). These bar codes are usually made up of rectangles, 
dots, hexagons, or other geometric shapes arranged in a grid pattern. 
Readers for 2-D bar codes generally use a CCD camera to capture the 
bar code image. Two-dimensional symbologies cannot be read by a 
laser as there is typically no sweep pattern that can encompass the 
entire symbol. Figure 3.20 shows a 2-D bar code.
Some of the more common codes for 2-D symbologies are 
DataMatrix, Codablock, EZCode, and QR code. The automotive 
industry is a major user of 2-D DataMatrix codes since the pattern can 
be directly imprinted into a metal part using a pinstamp or “dot peen” 
marking system. Laser etching can be used for the same purpose.
Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are another method 
of tagging parts and identifying them. Unlike bar codes, however, the 
tag does not have to be within line of sight range of the reader and 
may even be embedded inside an object. A common use of RFID 
systems in industrial automation is to track pallets or carriers through 
a process. An RFID system consists of a radio transmitter-receiver for 
two-way communication interfaced with a processor for the received 
information and the RFID tags that contain the information. Tags 
consist of an integrated circuit containing data and an antenna. The 
RFID reader sends a signal to the tag and reads its response. It may 
also work as a read-write system that transmits data to the tag for 
tracking purposes.
RFID tags can be passive, using the radio energy transmitted by 
the reader to power its circuit, or active with a tiny battery. Another 
option is a battery-backed passive tag, which is only activated 
when in the presence of a reader. Passive tags can be made much 
smaller and less expensively than active or battery-backed passive 
tags but must be very close to the reader for the field to be strong 
enough to activate the tag. Figure 3.21 shows a reader and several 
RFID tags.
FIGURE 3.20 
2-D bar code.

92 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Tags may contain a precoded unique serial number for lookup in 
a database or hold product-related information such as a part number, 
production date, or lot code. Read-write tags may be coded at various 
locations as a part travels through production, or they may be of the 
write-once read-multiple variety, also known as a field programmable 
tag. Information coded into a tag is stored electronically using 
nonvolatile memory.
RFID systems usually operate either in the high-frequency (HF) 
or ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) range of the radio spectrum. The 
distance at which an RFID tag can be read varies from less than a foot 
for some inexpensive, small passive tags to hundreds of feet for some 
larger active tags. More than one tag at a time may respond to the 
interrogation signal transmitted by a reader, so collision detection is 
often an important feature for an RFID controller.
Inductive ID systems serve a similar function to RFID systems but 
use a coil of wire similar to a proximity switch. The reader will excite 
an oscillator circuit in the tag that will transmit a serial code. Inductive 
ID systems can be lower cost and less susceptible to radio interference, 
but typically handle less information. They also have a much shorter 
range. Like RFID tags, inductive tags also come in active or passive, 
read-write, or read-only varieties.
Keyboard Wedge
A keyboard wedge is an interface that allows a device such as a bar 
code scanner or magnetic strip reader to emulate a keyboard. The 
name “wedge” describes the physical position it occupies wedged 
between the keyboard and the computer port—Fig. 3.22 illustrates 
this arrangement. For example, a bar code reader converts the scanned 
FIGURE 3.21 RFID reader and tags.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
93
code into a human readable alphanumeric format and then passes it 
through the wedge as if it were typed on the keyboard. The computer 
does not know whether the data came from the keyboard or another 
device, and the data is translated seamlessly.
A keyboard wedge may also be a software program that takes 
information into a USB or COM port and routes it through the 
keyboard buffer. Again, this is a transparent process from the 
perspective of the computer. This is a less expensive method of 
interfacing card scanners or bar code readers with a control system, 
but typically designers would choose a dedicated port for peripheral 
devices that are to be used often.
3.4 Power Control, Distribution, and Discrete Controls
From the service entrance of most industrial facilities power is 
distributed by way of three-phase busway or wired into distribution 
panels. Usually voltage at the service entrance is reduced via 
transformer to three-phase 480VAC. Various fused disconnects or 
circuit breakers are located to provide protection for branches of the 
distribution system. Disconnects that can only be reached by long 
poles with hooks at the end are often located at the point of power

drops to individual machines. Wiring is distributed inside rigid 
conduit or EMT to fixed locations or in flexible Seal-Tite or power 
cable to more temporary or movable spots. Cable tray is often 
mounted from the ceiling with multiconductor control or power cable 
laid in it and dropped to points of use. It is important to consult the 
National Electric Code or local regulations when planning a power 
distribution system.
Wire and cable are sized by the allowable amount of current that 
they are rated to carry for certain conditions, such as temperature or 
insulation. Wire is rated by gauge and may be sized in terms of 
American wire gauge (AWG), standard wire gauge (SWG), or imperial 
wire gauge. Wire is usually rated by Ampacity, another name for the 
amount of current it can safely carry.
Relays and contactors are a form of switching device that applies 
or removes power from a circuit based on a remote or external signal. 
Timers and counters also switch power or signals based on a delay or 
set number of pulses.
3.4.1 Disconnects, Circuit Breakers, and Fusing
An individual line of automation equipment or single machine will 
typically have one main disconnect to allow power to be removed 
from a single source. These disconnects usually have a set of fuses or 
a circuit breaker rated appropriately for the equipment they are 
supplying. There will often be several levels of branch circuit 
protection after the main disconnect in the form of fuses or circuit 
breakers. In most cases these also serve as a manual disconnect for 
the branch, although some motor circuits will simply have a fuse clip 
with no disconnecting means upstream. There are regulations 
concerning disconnects being present within a certain distance from 
a motor, so disconnects without fusing are sometimes located nearby 
for quick power removal. Disconnects consist of a set of contacts rated 
for the amount of current they must break with a manual means of 
actuation. These may also include a means of remote actuation or 
control.
Circuit Breakers
A circuit breaker is a circuit protection device that can be reset after 
detection of an electrical fault. Like all circuit protection devices, its 
purpose is to remove power from an electrical device or group of 
devices, protecting the circuit from damage. Circuit breakers are rated 
by the current at which they are designed to trip, as well as the 
maximum current they can safely interrupt during a short circuit.
Circuit breakers interrupt a current automatically; this requires 
some kind of stored mechanical energy, such as a spring or an internal 
power source, to actuate a trip mechanism. Small breakers such as 
those used for branch circuit or component protection in a machine 
are usually self-contained inside a molded plastic case. Larger circuit

breakers usually have a pilot device that senses a spike in current and 
operates a separate trip mechanism. Current is detected in several 
ways. Magnetic breakers route the current through an electromagnetic 
circuit. As the current increases, the pulling force on a latch also 
increases, eventually letting the contacts open by spring action. 
Thermal magnetic circuit breakers use a bimetallic strip to detect 
longer-term over current conditions while using a magnetic circuit to 
respond instantly to large surges, such as a short circuit.
Circuit breakers usually have a reset lever to manually trip and 
reset the circuit. This is an advantage over using fuses, which must be 
replaced after one use. In industrial applications most circuit breakers 
are used for low-voltage application (under 1000 V). Medium-voltage 
(1000 to 72 k) and high-voltage (more than 72.5 kV) breakers are used 
in switchgear applications but are rarely seen in industrial plants, 
though medium voltage switchgear is used in some process facilities. 
Low-voltage breakers may be of the DC or AC variety and generally 
fall into the categories of miniature circuit breakers (usually DIN rail 
mounted, up to 100 A) and molded case circuit breakers (self-
contained, up to 2500 A). An example of a molded case breaker is 
shown in Fig. 3.23.
Circuit breakers must carry the designed current load without 
overheating. They must also be able to withstand the arc that is 
generated when the electrical contacts are opened. Contacts are 
usually made of copper or a variety of alloys. Contact erosion occurs 
FIGURE 3.23

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
every time the contacts are opened under load; usually miniature 
circuit breakers are discarded when the contacts are worn, but some 
larger breakers have replaceable contacts.
There are two types of trip units in low-voltage circuit breakers: 
thermal magnetic and electronic. The thermal magnetic trip units 
contain a bimetallic thermal device that actuates the opening of the 
breaker with a delay depending on the overcurrent value. These are 
used for overload protection. The magnetic trip device has either a 
fixed or adjustable threshold that actuates the instantaneous trip of 
the breaker on a predetermined overcurrent value—usually a multiple 
of the overload current rating.
Electronic trip units use a microprocessor to process the current 
signal. Digital processing provides four different trip functions: the 
long and short time-delay trip functions per ANSI code 51 (AC time 
overcurrent), the instantaneous trip function per ANSI code 50 
(instantaneous overcurrent), and the ground-fault trip function per 
ANSI code 51 N (AC time ground fault overcurrent).
Circuit breakers are categorized by their characteristic curves for 
different applications. Highly inductive loads, such as transformers, 
can have very high inrush currents of 10 to 20 times the current rating 
of the device. These are classified as a class “D” curve. Normal 
inductive loads, including most motors, have a current inrush rating 
of 5 to 10 times the rating of the device and are classified as a class 
“C” curve. A class “B” curve is used for most lighter-duty noninductive 
loads and has a rating of two to five times the circuit breaker rating.
Circuit breakers are also rated for use as branch, supplementary, 
or feeder devices. Feeder circuit breakers are generally of the molded-
case variety and are designed for main power feeds. They are typically 
tested at 20,000 A interrupting rating. Branch circuit protection is 
tested for at least 5000 A interrupting rating and is used for branch 
circuits under the main breaker. Feeder and branch circuit breakers 
must be listed devices by Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
Supplementary protection devices are used for equipment 
protection in a branch circuit. They are classified as “recognized 
components” by UL rather than listed. They are tested with upstream 
branch circuit protection and are generally rated for 5000 A or less.
Motor circuit protectors (MCPs) are special application breakers 
with adjustable magnetic settings. They allow the operator to set the 
breaker’s magnetic protection level just above the inrush level of the 
motor. Overload protection for the motor is supplied in the starter’s 
overload relay. This combination allows protection of the motor without 
causing nuisance trips. MCPs are UL-recognized components.
Motor protector circuit breakers (MPCBs) are UL-listed circuit 
breakers with fixed magnetic protection and built-in motor overload 
protection. These breakers’ trip units are adjustable for Motor FLA 
ratings and can be set for overload trip class. MPCBs can be used directly 
with a contactor for a complete motor starting and protection package.

Fuses
A fuse or fusible link is an overcurrent protection device that is 
designed to melt (or “blow”) when excessive current flows through 
it. It is composed of a metal strip or wire element rated at a specified 
current plus a small percentage. This is mounted between two 
electrical terminals and generally surrounded with a nonflammable 
insulating housing.
Fuses are placed in series with the current flow to a branch or 
device. If the current flow through the element becomes too high, 
enough heat is generated to melt the element itself or a solder joint 
within the fuse.
Dual element fuses contain a metal strip that melts instantly for a 
short circuit as well as a low melting solder joint for longer-term 
overloads. Time delay or “slow blow” fuses allow short periods of 
overcurrent conditions and are used for motor circuits, which can 
have a higher current inrush as the motor starts.
Fuses are made in many different shapes, sizes, and materials, 
depending on the manufacturer and application. While the terminals 
and fuse element must be made of a metal or alloy for conductivity, 
the fuse body may be glass, fiberglass, ceramic, or insulating 
compressed fibers. Fuse sizes and mounting methods generally fall 
into several standardized formats. Figure 3.24 shows several cartridge-
type fuses; note that the larger fuse on the left has an indented area or 
FIGURE 3.24 Cartridge fuses.

98 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
groove at the bottom end of the fuse. This is known as a rejection fuse, 
the feature ensures that the fuse can only be placed into its holder 
one way.
Most fuses used in industrial applications are cartridge fuses. 
These are cylindrical with conducting caps on each end separated by 
the fusible link covered by the housing. These may be small glass or 
ceramic fuses for light loads or larger J or R class fuses. Cartridge 
fuses are also known as ferrule fuses. The caps may have bladed ends 
for insertion into clips or have a hole in the blade for bolting to a 
terminal. The most common methods are spring clips or terminal 
block–style fuse holders.
Fuses for use on printed circuit boards (PCBs) are generally 
soldered into place. They may have wire leads or solder pads 
depending on the desired mounting technique.
Fuses Compared with Circuit Breakers
Fuses are less costly than circuit breakers but must be replaced every 
time an overcurrent event occurs. This is not as convenient as simply 
resetting a breaker, though, and makes it more difficult to ignore 
intermittent faults.
Fuses react more quickly than circuit breakers, especially the 
“current-limiting” variety. This helps minimize the damage to 
downstream equipment.
3.4.2 Distribution and Terminal Blocks
Cable and wire is distributed to multiple circuits by terminating the 
ends into a securing means such as a screw or clamp. Distribution 
blocks are used for larger gauges of wire. They are usually connected 
by means of screwing a threaded stud into a block of metal. One side 
will have one termination point and the other will have multiples to 
feed branch circuits. Distribution blocks are mounted into insulating 
carriers with dividers between phases and are available in one to four 
pole configurations. They can have one or more terminations for each 
pole on the incoming side and up to 12 terminations each on the 
outgoing or branch side. Figure 3.25 shows a three-phase open-style 
distribution block; there are six connections for each phase. Wire 
gauges start at around 14 AWG and go all the way up into large 
MCM-size cable. MCM is an abbreviation for thousand circular mil (a 
mil is a thousandth of an inch).
Multiterminal copper or aluminum bus bars with a series of screw 
terminals are often used for ground or neutral terminations in panels. 
These are typically for smaller wire sizes that have no voltage present.
Terminal blocks are used to make wiring and cable connections 
and manage wiring. They are sized for the ranges of the wire and 
cables that are to be connected. Screw terminal and spring clamp 
types are both widely used on smaller conductors, but for large wire 
sizes screw terminals are usually used.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
99
There are a wide variety of styles and manufacturers of terminal 
blocks. The main purpose of terminal blocks other than wire 
management is to insulate the exposed wiring ends when making 
connections. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association 
(NEMA) has a number of standards associated with terminal block 
specifications as does the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC). Terminal blocks are often categorized as being NEMA or IEC 
style. NEMA terminal blocks are typically a more open style, while 
IEC is considered a “finger-safe” style with insulation surrounding 
the screw or clamp terminals.
Terminal blocks are generally sized to mount on uniform-size 
metal rails known as DIN rail. DIN is an abbreviation for Deutsches 
Institut für Normung, a German standard. Figure 3.26 shows a 
selection of various types of labeled IEC terminal blocks mounted on 
a piece of DIN rail. The larger black block is a cartridge fuse-holding 
terminal block.
Usually connections are straight through the block from terminal 
to terminal, but removable jumpers, switches, or fuses are sometimes 
built into the block. Terminal blocks for fuses are also called fuse 
blocks. These are made to swing open for fuse removal and also double 
as a branch or component disconnect. LED indicators are also 
embedded in some terminal blocks for energy presence or blown fuse 
indication. Special-purpose terminal blocks with contacts for 
thermocouples and extremely low or high voltages are also available.
Terminal blocks are commonly available in one-, two-, and three-
level configurations as a space-saving feature. They are usually 
mounted to some type of metal rail, the most common being DIN rail. 
FIGURE 3.25 Distribution block.

100 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
This allows blocks from different manufacturers to be mounted on a 
common surface. They are made in a wide variety of colors, which 
are often used for circuit identification.
A wide range of accessories are available for terminal blocks, 
including center and side jumpers to form a common bus, DIN rail, 
labels and labeling kits, and end caps and anchors.
3.4.3 Transformers and Power Supplies
Transformers are used to isolate or transfer energy in the form of AC 
current from one circuit to another. This is done by the principle of 
mutual inductance. If a changing current is passed through a coil of 
wire, it creates a magnetic field that can be used to create a current in 
another coil of wire that is electrically isolated from the first coil. This 
is most often accomplished by wrapping both coils around a common 
core of iron rich metal.
One of the principles of this induced voltage is that the voltage can 
be raised or lowered in proportion to the number of turns in the coils. 
A formula that can be used to express this relationship is Vp/Vs = 
Np/Ns, where V is voltage, N is the number of turns in the coil, p is 
the primary or the coil where the voltage is applied, and s is the 
secondary where the converted voltage is applied to the load. 
A transformer that is used to increase the voltage from the primary to 
the secondary is known as a “step-up” transformer, and the opposite 
FIGURE 3.26 IEC Terminal blocks on DIN rail.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
101
is a “step-down” transformer. Of course, by Ohm’s law, when the 
voltage is increased, the current will be decreased accordingly and 
vice versa.
Figure 3.27 is a wiring diagram for a single-phase power 
transformer. Transformers can typically be “tapped” or wired in 
different ways, as shown in this diagram. This particular transformer 
can provide 480 to 120, 480 to 240, 240 to 120, and 240 to 240 voltage 
conversions.
Transformers are also used for isolation purposes, as shown in 
the 240 to 240 wiring (which could also be 120 to 120). Since a voltage 
cannot change instantaneously through an inductor, isolation 
transformers are often used to protect the load from quick spikes in a 
circuit. They are commonly used in control and drive systems.
Transformers come in a wide range of sizes, from small internally 
mounted transformers inside devices such as DC power supplies to 
large three-phase transformers that power an entire production line 
or section of a plant. Many commercially available transformers have 
multiple taps, allowing the same transformer to provide a range of 
voltages depending on how these taps are connected.
Another method of obtaining different voltages from one 
transformer is to use an autotransformer. This is a transformer that 
only has one winding with taps on each end and one at an intermediate 
point. Voltage is applied to two of the terminals. The secondary is 
then taken from one of the primary terminals and the third terminal. 
The location of the intermediate tap determines the windings ratio 
and therefore the output voltage. If insulation is removed from part 
of the windings, the intermediate tap can be made movable using a

sliding brush, making the output voltage variable similar to a 
potentiometer.
The purpose of a transformer in an automation system is either to 
convert an AC voltage to a different voltage for distribution in the 
system or to isolate a circuit from another. Commonly three-phase 
480VAC is applied to the disconnect of a control enclosure. From the 
disconnect power is distributed through various branches with circuit 
protection for different purposes. Where a lower voltage (usually 
240,208 or 120VAC) is required, a transformer is connected to reduce 
the voltage level. Transformers may be used between individual 
phases to develop a single-phase voltage or across all three phases. 
Windings are often tapped in the center and grounded to develop 
two phases 180° out of phase with each other. This is similar to a 
common residential service entrance, where 240VAC is wired to a 
distribution or breaker panel along with a neutral (the grounded 
center tap). The 240 V can then be used for higher-power appliances 
and two rows of breakers supply 120VAC to branch circuits. 
Transformers typically have circuit protection such as fuses or power 
supplies on both the primary and secondary side.
DC power supplies are used to provide lower-voltage DC power 
for I/O devices such as sensors and solenoid valves. Power supplies 
usually have regulated outputs to prevent current or voltage 
fluctuations. They are usually protected on the AC and DC sides by 
fuses or circuit breakers.
The most common voltage used for industrial machinery is 
24VDC. This is a low enough voltage to prevent most injuries but 
high enough to minimize noise interference and allow distribution 
over a reasonable distance. 12VDC is also sometimes used, while 
higher DC levels of 48 or more volts may be used for DC motors such 
as steppers. Servos and DC motors do not usually use separate power 
supplies, but generate their own DC power in the drive.
3.4.4 Relays, Contactors, and Starters
A relay is a device that allows switching of a circuit by electrical 
means. There are various types of relays, including electromechanical 
and solid-state coils, reed or mercury wetted contact, but the purpose 
is generally the same: to control a circuit with one voltage with a 
signal from another or to use one signal to switch multiple circuits, as 
in Fig. 3.28.
Electromechanical relays use an electromagnetic coil to physically 
pull a set (or sets) of contacts either from an open to a closed position 
or from closed to open. AC or DC may be used to switch the coil; this 
is one of the specifications of a relay along with the number of poles 
and amount of current that can be handled by the contacts. Contacts 
are specified as NO or NC, referring to their deenergized state. Relays 
may have multiple poles of both NO and NC contacts. Figure 3.29 
shows a variety of different relay types; the relay to the far left is a 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e

tube-base electromechanical relay and socket, and the next two are 
often referred to as “ice-cube” relays. The relay on the lower right is a 
heavier-duty DIN rail mount electromechanical relay, while the one 
at the upper right is an adjustable timing relay.
Solid-state relays use transistor technology to switch current flow. 
Voltage is applied to a solid-state “coil” that may switch current 
directly through a transistor or CMOS device or energize an LED to 
optically isolate the circuits. Solid-state relays have no moving parts, 
which gives them greater longevity than electromechanical relays; 
however, they are rated at a lower current-switching capability.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Some relays have a coil to latch the relay on and a separate coil to 
reset it. These are used when a circuit state needs to be maintained 
even if power is lost. These are known as latching or set-reset (SR) 
relays.
Safety circuits often use relays that have force-guided contacts. 
This means that the contacts are mechanically linked together so that 
all of them switch together. This ensures that if a set of contacts weld 
together because of arcing, then one set of contacts can be used to 
reliably monitor the state of the relay. These safety relays also use 
redundant sets of contacts for each circuit for the same reason.
Relays come in a variety of form factors also. Large relays 
generally are screw or bolt mounted directly to a panel or backplane, 
while many standard industrial relays have round pins or blades that 
can be plugged into a DIN rail–mounted socket. Sockets are available 
in tube base for round pins and bladed base or pin sockets for small 
relays. Small relays may also be soldered to a circuit board.
A type of relay that can handle the high power required to directly 
control an electric motor is called a contactor. Continuous current 
ratings for common contactors range from 10 A to several hundred 
amps. Contactors are an element of motor starters; a motor starter is 
simply a contactor with overload protection devices attached. The 
overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a 
coil heats a bimetal strip, or where a solder pot melts, releasing a 
spring to operate an auxiliary set of contacts. These auxiliary contacts 
are in series with the coil. If the overload senses excess current in the 
load, the coil is deenergized.
Motor starters are generally categorized as NEMA or IEC style. 
NEMA starters are generally larger and have replaceable overload 
elements. They can generally be rebuilt if necessary; however, they 
are physically larger and more expensive than an IEC motor starter of 
the same rating. IEC starters are not usually rebuilt and are simply 
discarded when the contacts wear out. Figure 3.30 is an IEC motor 
starter in a manual motor control enclosure.
3.4.5 Timers and Counters
A timer reacts to an applied signal or power feed and switches a set 
of contacts based on a delay. It may also create a repetitive series of 
pulses. Timers may be purely mechanical, such as with a pneumatic 
timer; electromechanical with a motor and clutch; or entirely 
electronic. They are available in both analog and digital formats.
Timers generally fall into the following categories:
On Delay—Timer changes state after a specified period of 
• 
time and remains in that state until the signal is removed.
Off Delay—Timer changes state immediately and reverts to 
• 
its original state after a specified period of time.
One Shot—Timer creates a single pulse of specified length.
• 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
105
Pulse or Repeat-Cycle—Timer creates a series of on and off 
• 
pulses with configurable on and off times until signal is 
removed.
As with temperature controllers, timers and counters are often sized 
using the DIN system, ensuring that they will fit a certain-size panel 
cutouts. They are usually available in 1/16 DIN, 1/8 DIN, or 1/4 DIN 
sizes. Figure 3.31 shows a 1/16 DIN digital timer.
Electromechanical timers such as the Eagle Signal Cycle Flex 
timer shown in Fig. 3.32 are often used in applications where electronic 
timers may not be appropriate. Mechanically switched contacts may 
still be less expensive than the semiconductor devices needed to 
control powerful lights, motors, and heaters. An electromechanical 
cam timer uses a small synchronous AC motor turning a cam against 
a bank of switch contacts. The AC motor is turned at an accurate rate 
by the applied frequency, which is regulated very accurately by the 
power companies. Gears drive a shaft at the desired rate and turn the 
cam. These timers are still in use in many industrial facilities because 
FIGURE 3.30 IEC motor starter.

106 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
they are easily rebuilt, rugged, and switch high-current loads; 
however, they are often replaced with less expensive and more 
reliable electronic timers.
The most common application of electromechanical timers now is 
in washers, driers, and dishwashers. This type of timer often has a 
friction clutch between the gear train and the cam, so that the cam can 
be turned to reset the time. This is a less expensive method of performing 
multiple timing segments with high-current load switching than with 
an electronic version.

107
A counter also reacts to input signals, totalizing them and 
changing the state of a signal when the specified count has been 
reached. Counters are generally classified as up counters, where state 
changes increment the value until the set point is reached, or down 
counters, where the counter starts at the set point and counts down to 
0. Counters may also be combinational with both up and down 
signals. Counters also have a reset input to set the counter back to its 
starting point. They may be mechanical in nature, such as with a 
totalizer, or be incremented electronically.
3.4.6 Push Buttons, Pilot Lights, and Discrete Controls
Before the advent of touch screens, signaling and machine control 
had to be done with push buttons, switches, and indicator lights. A 
large variety of components are still used as discrete interfaces 
between an operator and a machine today.
Push Buttons and Switches
A push button is a manually operated spring-loaded method of 
opening or closing a set of electrical contacts. Industrial push buttons 
generally come in several standard sizes; 30 mm, 22 mm, and 16 mm 
diameters. There are larger and smaller sizes also available, but the 
vast majority of push buttons, switches, and pilot lights fall within 
these standard sizes.
Larger push buttons (22 and 30 mm) are often modular in nature, 
having an actuator to which contact blocks can be mounted and 
removable mounting rings and bezels. Contact blocks are available in 
NO and NC configurations and may be mixed and matched as 
necessary. These blocks can also be stacked on top of each other for 
up to four sets of contacts. Push buttons may also have an internal 
light that may be illuminated from a control output or through one of 
the sets of contacts; these are usually LED or incandescent bayonet 
base bulbs.
Push buttons come in various colors, generally black, red, yellow, 
green, blue, or white, although other colors are also sometimes seen. 
The actuator may be mushroom head, extended, or flush with the 
bezel. They also may be of the momentary (spring return) or maintained 
(toggling) variety. Figure 3.33 is a 30 mm flush push button.
Selector switches have many of the same characteristics as push 
buttons; they use the same types of contact blocks and come in the 
same 16, 22, and 30 mm diameters. The color is usually black, although 
inserts may be of various colors. Lights are not commonly used in 
selector switches.
As with push buttons, switches may be of the maintained or 
spring return variety. Most switches have two or three positions, 
although four positions or even more are sometimes seen. Unlike 
push buttons, however, all of the contacts do not switch at the same 
time. For a three-position switch the contacts on one side will switch 

108 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
in the left position and the opposite side will switch in the right 
position. Both sides usually remain unswitched in the center. 
Contact blocks are actuated with a cam rotating with the switch 
body.
Part of the push button or selector switch assembly is usually an 
antirotation ring. This is a ring with a tab that fits into a slot in the 
device and also a tab that fits into a slot cut into the punched hole in 
the cabinet or enclosure.
Pilot Lights and Stack Lights
Pilot lights are available in the same standard sizes as push buttons 
and switches, although much larger lights are sometimes used for 
greater visibility and small 8 mm and 10 mm lights are common for 
higher-density display. Lamps for pilot lights are generally of the 
incandescent or LED type. Most lamps are white and a plastic cover is 
used to change the color of the light. They are available for “full voltage” 
applications of 120 to 240VAC, which use a small transformer, as well 
as 12 and 24VDC. For low-voltage or computer card outputs, 5 and 
6VDC lamps are often used. Some pilot lights also have a spring-loaded 
“push to test” feature that will illuminate the lamp, although there are 
no external contacts for these as there would be on a lighted push 
button. If pilot lights are connected to controlled outputs, a separate 
“push to test” push button is sometimes used to illuminate all of the 
lamps on a panel at once.
Stack lights, also called light stacks or tower lights, are columnar 
sets of lights that usually indicate the state of a whole machine or 
control system. They are also modular, usually beginning with a base 
unit that may or may not include a horn or buzzer. The base may be 
connected using a quick disconnect cable or terminals with a strain 
FIGURE 3.33 30 mm push button.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e

relief entry. Light units are then stacked onto the base in the required 
order, generally up to five units in height. A common combination of 
lights would be red, yellow, and green (from top to bottom), red 
generally signifying a fault or alarm, yellow signifying either caution 
or manual/maintenance mode, and green signifying auto mode or 
machine running. There is no universal stand for these colors, and 
each company or plant may have their own specifications. Blinking 
the lights to signify auto/not started or cycle stop versus immediate 
stop conditions is an example of how a stack light might be used to 
deliver additional information. Blue or white lights are sometimes 
added for signals like low bin or hopper or other special functions as 
defined by the designer. Figure 3.34 shows several arrangements of 
four-color stack lights; the two rightmost stacks have a buzzer or 
audible alert in the top position.
FIGURE 3.34 Stack lights. (Courtesy of Banner.)

110 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
As with pilot lights, they may be energized by 24VDC, 120VAC, 
or various other voltages as required. Other modules for playing a 
recorded voice or music are also available. A feature of some stack 
lights that may be beneficial is a flexible base to reduce the chance of 
the stack breaking off a low-mounted cabinet or machine. Stack lights 
may also be pole mounted and side mounted, depending on the 
application.
Other Panel-Mounted Devices
Some items grouped under the heading “discrete controls” may not 
be discrete at all. An example is a panel-mounted potentiometer for 
analog speed control of a motor drive. These are often available in the 
same form factors as selector switches in 22 mm or 30 mm sizes. 
Temperature controllers, timers, and counters are also devices you 
might find mounted on the front of a controls enclosure.
Horns and buzzers are other discrete devices that may be panel 
mounted. Buzzers are generally piezoelectric and susceptible to 
moisture since they cannot be easily sealed.
Along with all of the devices that might be mounted on a controls 
enclosure come labels for these devices. Most commonly engraved 
plastic tags or painted metal tags that have the appropriate-size hole 
are used with push buttons, switches, and pilot lights. Engraved 
plastic or metal tags are of two colors, an inside and outside color. An 
example is Gravoply plastic, which may be black or red on the outside 
with a white inside color. When characters are cut into the plastic, the 
inside color shows through. Tags may be premade with common 
terms like stop, start, and so on, or be sold as blanks for the user to 
engrave.
Tags are not only used for devices on the outside an enclosure; 
they are also common inside the cabinet or mounted next to a sensor 
on a machine. These may be engraved or printed and contain 
schematic, I/O, or descriptive text for components. Safety warnings 
also fall into the premade or purchased label category.
3.4.7 Cabling and Wiring
An important part of the distribution of power and signals throughout 
a system is cable and wire. Individual wires and multiconductor 
cables are used to connect the various control devices and distribution 
components within a machine or system. Wire sizes or gauges are 
specified as described in the appendixes of this book. Wire may be 
made of any conductive metal but is usually copper or aluminum. 
Usually it is covered with a thermoplastic insulation available in a 
wide range of colors. Wire is manufactured in solid or stranded forms, 
depending on the application.
Multiconductor cables consist of a collection of insulated wires 
inside a protective jacket. The wires may be twisted together in pairs 
for noise immunity or simply run in parallel. Multiconductor cables 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e

often carry a noninsulated shield or drain wire to help carry away 
unwanted stray signals. This wire should be grounded at one end only
to prevent a ground loop. An additional foil covering is often wrapped 
around the bundle inside the jacket but in contact with the shield wire. 
Examples of several multiconductor cables are shown in Fig. 3.35.
For 
high-flexing 
and 
repetitive 
movement 
applications, 
multiconductor cable is often made with fine stranding to improve its 
bend radius and increase usable lifetime. Specifications for expected 
number of cycles and minimum bend radius are often listed in wiring 
catalogs.
Connecting individual wires or multiconductor cables together 
may be done with terminal blocks, but in some cases they must be 
spliced. This may be done using crimp on malleable metal pieces 
called butt splices or wires may be soldered. After soldering, the wire 
junction must be insulated using electrical tape or shrinkable tubing, 
also known as heat shrink.
Strain Relief
To prevent pulling wire and cabling out of terminations a strain 
relief–type fitting is placed at enclosure entry points and built into 
cable plugs. These may be of a screw clamp type or a rubber “donut” 
shape that clamps down on the cable when a fitting is tightened. 
Another type of strain relief has a series of ridges at the point where 
the cable meets the enclosure or junction box. The main purpose of a 
FIGURE 3.35 Multiconductor cables.

112 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
strain relief is to reduce wear or stress at the point of entry when a 
cable is pulled. Strain reliefs often also provide ingress protection 
from liquids. Strain reliefs often come in standard hole sizes like 
electrical fittings; 3/8 in, 1/2 in, and 3/4 in. One inch and larger are 
all standard sizes. They may be made of a galvanized metal or plastic. 
Figure 3.36 illustrates a 1/2-in cord grip strain relief installed in the 
side of an enclosure.
Ferrules
A ferrule is a circular clamp or sleeve used to hold together and attach 
fibers or wires by crimping the ferrule to permanently tighten it onto 
the wire end. Wiring ferrules often have a color-coded piece of plastic 
molded around one end both to allow easy wire entry and for 
identification of wire gauge. Ferrules prevent smaller stranded wires 
from splaying and provide a solid electrical connection for terminal 
block clamps or screws. Special crimping tools with selectable dies 
are used to crimp the ferrule firmly onto the exposed wire end. Figure 
3.37 shows several different sizes of insulated ferrules.
Soldering
A common method of attaching wires to each other or to pins in plugs 
is soldering. It is used in electronics, where it is used to connect 
electrical wiring and to connect electronic components to PCBs. 
Soldering is also used in plumbing to connect metal piping together 
with a water and gas tight bond.
Solder is a metal filler material that melts at a low temperature. 
For electrical connections it is usually composed of tin and lead in 
FIGURE 3.36 Cord grip strain relief. (Courtesy of Thomas & Betts.)

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
113
various proportions, the most common being 63 percent tin and 37 
percent lead. This proportion also has the benefit of being eutectic, 
meaning it passes directly from a liquid phase to a solid phase. This 
is important because metals that pass through an intermediate 
“plastic” phase are subject to cracking if disturbed while cooling.
Other alloys used for electrical connections are lead-silver for 
higher strength, tin-zinc or zinc aluminum for joining aluminum, and 
tin-silver and tin bismuth for other electronics. These alloys all melt 
at a lower temperature than the materials they are joining. This is the 
major difference between soldering and welding, which melts part of 
the workpiece. All of these alloys are known as soft solder, although 
silver solders are sometimes excepted from this classification.
The process of soldering involves melting the solder and flowing 
it into the joined wires or components. This process can be assisted by 
using a rosin water-based or “no-clean” type of “flux” to coat the 
joined pieces; solder flows to wherever the flux is applied. Many 
FIGURE 3.37 Ferrules.

114 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
solders have a flux core that helps in this process. In addition to 
assisting the solder to flow, flux also helps clean the materials and 
prevent oxidation. When soldering stranded wires, solder is usually 
applied to the wire ends individually first; this is known as tinning 
the wires. If flux is applied to the strands beforehand or as part of the 
solder core, solder is drawn up into the strands by capillary action, 
called wicking.
Soldering by hand is done with a soldering iron, which is an 
electrically heated tool with an insulated handle and various different 
sizes of tip. Many of these have a temperature adjustment for 
different-size work. Figure 3.38 shows a soldering iron and roll of 
rosin-core solder. Often when soldering solid-state components, a 
clip-on “heat sink” is used between the wire lead and the component 
to prevent damage; proper temperature and tip size are important 
here also.
Soldering of components to PCBs on a production line is done by 
a process known as wave soldering. Components are adhesively 
attached to the board with leads extending through holes in the board 
and touching contact pads. The boards are then passed over pools of 
molten solder, which are vibrated, creating waves. This allows solder 
to contact the pads and leads without immersing the entire underside 
of the circuit board.
Another method of production soldering is to apply a solder 
powder and flux mixture in little clumps to the solder joint. This 
can then be melted with a heat lamp, hot air pencil, or most 
commonly in an oven. This method is called reflow soldering. 
FIGURE 3.38 Solder and soldering iron.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
115
Often a combination of wave, reflow, and hand soldering will be 
used on the same PCB.
3.5 Actuators and Movement
Actuators are used to move tooling on a machine, usually for the 
purpose of controlling the movement or positioning of a workpiece 
or sensor. They may be of a linear or rotating nature or a combination 
of both. Linear actuators are often used to generate a rotary movement 
by pushing a rotary pinned on an axis, or rotating devices such as 
motors can be used to generate linear motion via a belt or ball screw. 
Applications of these actuators are further discussed in section 3.7 of 
this primer.
A word on the nomenclature used in actuation. The words home, 
advanced or extended, returned or retracted are often used to describe 
the position of an actuator or its tooling. Great care must be taken to 
identify whether the designer is speaking of the tooling or the actuator 
itself. These positions can be the opposite of each other and cause 
physical rework and software changes if misinterpreted. It is 
preferable to refer to the position of the tooling generally since it is 
the most easily identified by maintenance or operators.
Descriptions such as “Tooling Raised” or “Pallet Stop Extended” 
can help reduce the ambiguity of generic movement labels for both 
electrical and mechanical designers.
3.5.1 Pneumatic and Hydraulic Actuators and Valves
Collectively the use of pneumatic and hydraulic energy is known as 
fluid power. The operation of actuators in fluid power applications is 
similar in the flow of liquids or gases through the systems; however, 
pneumatic systems use easily compressible air (or other inert gases) 
while hydraulic power is generated by the flow of much less 
compressible fluids, usually oil.
Pneumatic and hydraulic actuators may be linear or rotary in 
nature. Air cylinders generate a linear motion by injecting air through 
a port on one side or the other of a rounded piston surface inside a 
tubular housing. As air is injected through a valve into one end of the 
cylinder, the same valve releases air from the other side. A diagram of 
the internal configuration of an air cylinder is shown in Fig. 3.39. The 
end of the piston rod is threaded for attachment to various tooling 
pieces, such as a clevis or ball end.
Single acting cylinders use the force provided by air to move in 
one direction (usually out or “advanced”) and a spring to return to 
the “home” or retracted position. Double acting cylinders use the air 
to move in both extend and retract directions. They have two ports to 
allow air in: one for the outward stroke and one for the return stroke. 
For a typical cylinder, the round piston face is attached to a rod 
extending through the end of the cylinder body. Some cylinders have 

116 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
a rod attached to both faces of the piston face and extending out 
through both ends of the body. These are sometimes called double-
ended or reciprocating cylinders.
Air cylinders are specified by their bore, or piston diameter, and 
their stroke, or how far the end of the shaft moves. Other specifications 
such as cushions to slow the last portion of motion, port sizes, and 
mounting method are also usually included in the part number. Sizes 
may be specified in both metric and standard measurements. Since 
stroke is specified in increments, stroke distances are sometimes 
limited by using shaft collars or limiting the movement of the tooling 
with stops. When this is done, the cushion may no longer be useful as 
it is at the farthest reach of the cylinder’s stroke.
Figure 3.40 shows a very long stroke guided cylinder. These have 
bearings in a guide block that take the side load off the piston rod and 
ensure that force is applied linearly. Guide blocks can be ordered as a 
separate unit to mount a cylinder into.
Rodless air cylinders have no piston rod. They are actuators that 
use a mechanical or magnetic coupling to impart force, typically to a 
table or other body that moves along the length of the cylinder body 
but does not extend beyond it. These are also often called band 
cylinders. This is shown in Fig. 3.41.
Air cylinders are available in a variety of sizes and range from a 
small 2.5 mm diameter air cylinder, which might be used for picking 
Retract “B” Port
Piston Seals
Extend “A” Port
Piston Rod
Rod Seal
Cushion Adjustment Screws

up a small electronic component, to 400 mm diameter air cylinders, 
which would impart enough force to lift a car. Some pneumatic 
cylinders reach 1000 mm in diameter and are used in place of 
hydraulic cylinders for special circumstances where leaking hydraulic 
oil might impose a hazard.
Pneumatic valves operate by using an electrically operated 
solenoid that shifts a spool inside the valve. This spool allows air to 
pass from an input port to an output port, also allowing air to escape 
from the exhaust side of the cylinder through the valve. The valves 
may be arranged in a variety of different ways, depending on the 
requirements of the application. Pneumatic valves are generally 
described by the number of ports in the valve body and the number 
of positions the spool may have. Like electrical circuits, they are also 
often specified as NC and NO, referring to their deenergized state. 
Examples of these are 2/2 and 3/2 valves. Most automated systems 
tend to use banks of 5/2 and 5/3 valves with open or blocked centers, 
depending on whether it is desirable to be able to move the actuator 
by hand in the deenergized state or not.
In addition to valves, fittings and devices like flow controls, 
pressure regulators, filters and a wide range of tubing and hoses are 
necessary to complete a pneumatic or hydraulic system. Accumulators 
and pressure intensifiers are also components sometimes used in 
pneumatic circuits. Table 3.1 shows pneumatic symbols for some of 
these valves and devices.
Hydraulic cylinders and actuators operate in a similar way to 
pneumatics except that they must be able to withstand much higher 
pressures and forces. More care must be taken to prevent the escape 
of fluids from the actuator also. Because of this, hydraulic actuators 
are more ruggedly built than typical pneumatic cylinders. External 
FIGURE 3.41 Rodless cylinder. (Courtesy of SMC.)

118 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
rods are often threaded into the end caps to help withstand the greater 
force exerted within the cylinder. Hydraulic cylinders are used in 
applications requiring great force, such as presses.
Unlike pneumatic systems, which are often supplied from a 
plantwide system, hydraulic systems have dedicated pumps. When 
oil is compressed, it generates heat, so the hydraulic fluid must also 
usually be cooled. Because of these extra components, hydraulic 
systems are much more expensive than pneumatic ones. Hybrid 
devices like air over oil actuators can sometimes help reduce the cost 
and complexity of hydraulic systems.

3.5.2 Electric Actuators
Electrically driven actuators are often used where air is not available 
or precision location is required. Though typically more costly than 
an air cylinder, they are less expensive and complex than a hydraulic 
system. Electric actuators are often servomotor driven and ball screw 
or belt based. They can be found in many of the same packaged 
configurations as air cylinders.
Small magnetic solenoids may also be used to extend a rod a short 
distance; these consist of a coil of wire wrapped around a bushing 
with a metal rod inside. A well-known example of this type of actuator 
is those used in pinball machines for the flippers and bumpers. The 
spool in solenoid valves uses this same principle.
3.5.3 Motion Control
Motion control is often considered an entire subchapter within the 
field of automation. Motion control differs from standard discrete 
controls such as pneumatic cylinders, conveyors, and the like because 
the positions and velocities are both controlled by analog or digitally 
converted analog methods. This is accomplished by the use of 
hydraulic or pneumatic proportional valves, linear actuators, or 
electric motors, usually servos. Stepper motors are also a common 
component in small motion control systems, especially when feedback 
may not be economical. Motion control is used extensively in 
packaging, printing, textile, semiconductor, and assembly industries. 
It also forms the basis of robotics and CNC machine tools.
The basic architecture of a motion control system consists of:
A motion controller to generate the desired output or motion 
• 
profile. Movement is based on programmed set points and 
closing a position or velocity feedback loop.
A drive or amplifier to transform the control signal from the 
• 
motion controller into a higher-power electrical control 
current or voltage. This is what is applied to the actuator and 
actually makes it move.
An actuator such as a hydraulic or air cylinder, linear actuator, 
• 
or electric motor for output motion.
One or more feedback sensors, such as optical encoders, 
• 
resolvers, or Hall effect devices. These return the position or 
velocity of the actuator to the motion controller in order to 
close the position or velocity control loops. Newer “intelligent” 
drives can close the position and velocity loops internally, 
resulting in more accurate control.
Mechanical components to transform the movement of the 
• 
actuator into the desired motion. Examples are gears, shafting, 
ball screws, belts, linkages, and linear and rotational bearings.

120 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Figure 3.42 shows the physical arrangement of a motion control 
system.
A stand-alone motion control axis is common when positioning; 
however, there are times when motions must be coordinated closely. 
This requires tight synchronization between axes. Robotics is an 
example of a coordinated motion system working together. Prior to 
the development of fast open communication interfaces in the early 
1990s, the only open method of coordinated motion was analog 
control being brought back to the controller in the form of encoder, 
resolver, and other analog methods such as 4 to 20 mA and 0 to 10 V 
signals. The first open digital automation bus to satisfy the 
requirements of coordinated motion control was Sercos (www.sercos.
com). This is an international standard that closes the servo feedback 
loop in the drive rather than in the motion controller. This arrangement 
reduces the computational load on the controller, allowing more axes 
to be controlled at once. Since the development of Sercos, other 
interfaces have been developed for this purpose, including ProfiNet 
IRT, CANopen, EtherNet PowerLink, and EtherCAT.
Besides the common control functions of velocity and position 
control, there are several other functions that may be considered. 
Since torque feedback can be determined from the current and 
velocity of the servo, pressure or force control is another function of a 
servo actuator. Electronic gearing can be used to link two or more 
axes together in a master/slave relationship. Cam profiling where 
one axis follows the motion of a master axis is an example of this.

More detailed profiles, such as trapezoidal moves or S-curves, can 
also be computed by a motion controller enhancing standard 
positional moves. This helps to eliminate acceleration or deceleration 
impacts such as “jerk.”

components is Motion Control Resource (www.motioncontrolresource.
com). This site is amazingly free of advertisements and contains links

distributors.
3.6 AC and DC Motors
An electric machine is a link between an electrical system and a 
mechanical system. The process of converting energy from one of 
these forms to the other is electromechanical energy conversion. In 
these machines, the process is reversible. If the conversion is from 
mechanical to electrical, the machine is acting as a generator, and if 
the conversion is from electrical to mechanical, the machine is acting 
as a motor.
Three types of electrical machines are used extensively for 
electromechanical energy conversion: DC, induction, and synchronous 
motors. Other types of motors are permanent magnet (PM), hysteresis, 
and stepper motors. Conversion from electrical to mechanical energy 
is based on two electromagnetic principles: when a conductor moves 
within a magnetic field, voltage is induced in the conductor; 
simultaneously, when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a 
magnetic field, the conductor experiences a mechanical force. In a 
motor, an electrical system makes current flow through conductors 
placed in the magnetic field and a force is exerted on each conductor. 
If the conductors are placed on a structure that is free to rotate, an 
electromagnetic torque is produced, making the structure rotate. This 
rotating structure is called a rotor. The part of the machine that does 
not move and provides the magnetic force is called the stator. Usually 
this is the outer frame of the machine or motor with the exception of 
special cases such as powered rollers.
Both stator and rotor are made of ferromagnetic (iron-rich) 
materials. The iron core is used to maximize the coupling between 
the coils of wire, increasing the magnetic flux density in the motor 
and therefore allowing its size to be reduced. In most motors, slots are 
cut on the inner periphery of the stator and outer periphery of the 
rotor and conductors are placed in the slots. If a time-varying electrical 
signal is placed on the stator or rotor (or both), it will cause a 
mechanical torque to be exerted by the rotor. The conductors placed 
in the slots are interconnected to form windings; the winding through 
which the current is passed to create the major source of magnetic 
flux is called the field winding, although in some motors the main 
source of magnetic flux is a PM.

122 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Electric motors are used in many different applications of 
automated systems, from blowers, pumps, and fans to conveyors, 
robotics, and actuators. They may be powered by AC supplied from 
a power grid within the plant or a motor drive, or DC from batteries 
or a converter. Motors may be classified by their construction method, 
their source of power, or their application and the type of motion they 
provide. In the industrial field they are generally standardized as to 
size and horsepower or wattage range.
3.6.1 AC Motors
A typical AC motor consists of two parts: a stator having coils supplied 
with AC current to produce a rotating magnetic field and an inside 
rotor attached to an output shaft. The rotor is provided a torque by the 
rotating field that is generated by the alternating current.
AC motors often include designations relating to their physical 
construction such as TE (totally enclosed), FC (fan cooled), and PM. 
Other information, such as frame size, also describes motors 
physically, including mounting options, sealing methods, and shaft 
sizes. A good motor catalog will describe these options well.
Synchronous Motors
A synchronous motor is an AC machine with a rotor that rotates at the 
same speed as the alternating current that is applied. This is 
accomplished by exciting the rotor’s field winding with a direct 
current. When the rotor rotates, voltage is induced in the armature 
winding of the stator; this produces a revolving magnetic field whose 
speed is the same as the speed of the rotor. Unlike an induction motor, 
a synchronous motor has zero “slip” while operating at speed.
Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. 
The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed; 
hence, the name synchronous motor. Synchronous motors are used 
mainly in applications where a constant speed is desired and are not 
as common in industrial applications as induction motors.
One problem with synchronous motors is that they are not self-
starting. If an AC voltage is applied to the stator terminals and the 
rotor is excited with a field current, the motor will simply vibrate. 
This is because as the AC voltage is applied it is immediately rotating 
the stator field at 60 Hz, which is too fast for the rotor poles to catch 
up to. For this reason synchronous motors have to be started by either 
using a variable frequency supply (such as a drive) or starting the 
machine as an inductive motor. If a drive is not used, an extra winding 
can be used called a “damper” winding. In this instance, the field 
winding is not excited by DC but is shunted by a resistance. Current 
is induced in the damper winding, producing a torque; as the motor 
approaches synchronous speed, the DC voltage is applied to the rotor 
and the motor will lock onto the stator field.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
123
Three-Phase AC Synchronous Motors
The stator of a three-phase synchronous motor has a distributed 
winding called the armature winding. It is connected to the AC supply 
and is designed for high voltage and current. DC is then applied to the 
rotor coils of the motor through slip rings and brushes from a separate 
source. This creates a continuous field, and the rotor will then rotate 
synchronously with the alternating current applied to the stator.
Synchronous motors can be further divided by two different 
construction types: high-speed motors with cylindrical rotors and 
low-speed motors with salient pole rotors. The nonsalient pole or 
cylindrical motor has one distributed winding and a uniform air gap 
between the rotor and stator. The rotor is generally long and has a 
small diameter. These motors are often used in generators.
Salient pole motors have concentrated windings on the motor 
poles and a nonuniform air gap. The rotors are shorter and have a 
greater diameter than cylindrical rotor synchronous motors. Salient 
pole motors are often used to drive pumps or mixers.
One use for a synchronous motor is its use in a power factor 
correction scheme; these are referred to as synchronous condensers. 
This method uses a feature of the motor where it consumes power at 
a leading power factor when its rotor is overexcited. It appears to the 
supply to be a capacitor, and can then be used to correct the lagging 
power factor that is usually presented to the electric supply by 
inductive loads. Since factories are charged extra for their electricity 
consumption if the power factor is too low, this can help correct a 
plant’s power profile. The excitation is adjusted until a near unity 
power factor is obtained (often automatically). Motors used for this 
purpose are easily identified as they have no shaft extensions.
Single-Phase AC Synchronous Motors
Small single-phase AC motors can also be designed with PM rotors. 
Since the rotors in these motors do not require any induced current, 
they do not slip backward against the stator frequency; instead, they 
rotate synchronously. Because they are very accurately synchronized 
with the applied frequency, which is carefully regulated at the power 
plant, these motors are often used to power mechanical clocks, chart 
recorders, or anything else that requires a precise speed.
Hysteresis synchronous motors use the hysteresis property of 
magnetic materials to produce torque. The rotor is a smooth cylinder 
of a magnetic alloy that stays magnetized but can be demagnetized 
fairly easily as well as remagnetized with poles in a new location. The 
stator windings are distributed to produce a sinusoidal magnetic flux. 
Because of the hysteresis of the magnetized rotor, it tends to lag behind 
the rotating field. This creates a constant torque up to the synchronous 
speed, a useful feature for some applications. A hysteresis motor is 
quiet and smooth running; however, it is more expensive than a 
reluctance motor of the same rating.

124 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
A reluctance motor has a single-phase distributed stator winding 
and a cage-type rotor, often called a “squirrel cage.” This is a 
cylindrical-shaped rotor with bars spaced around the periphery. In 
a reluctance motor, some of these teeth are removed. The stator of a 
single-phase reluctance motor has a main winding and an auxiliary 
starting winding. When the stator is connected to a single-phase 
supply, the motor starts as an induction motor. A centrifugal switch is 
then used to disconnect the auxiliary winding at about 75 percent of 
the synchronous speed. The motor continues to gain speed until it is 
synchronized with the rotating field. Reluctance motors are generally 
several times larger than an equivalent horsepower motor with DC 
excitation; however, because it has no slip rings, brushes, or field 
winding, it is low cost and fairly maintenance-free. A single-phase 
squirrel cage motor is shown in Fig. 3.43.
Asynchronous Motors
Induction motors are the most rugged and widely used motor for 
industrial applications. An induction motor has a stator and rotor 
with a uniform air gap between their windings. The rotor is mounted 
on bearings and is made of laminated sheets of ferromagnetic metal 
with slots cut on the outer surface. The rotor winding may be of the 
squirrel cage type or the wound rotor type. The stator is also made of 
laminations of high-grade sheet steel with distributed windings. In 
induction motors, alternating current is applied to both the stator and 
rotor windings.
Three-Phase AC Induction Motors
Windings of both the stator and the rotor of a three-phase motor are 
distributed over several slots in the laminated sheets. Terminals of 
the rotor windings are connected to three slip rings; using stationary

brushes, the rotor can then be connected to an external circuit. Power 
applied to the three-phase windings of the stator and rotor produce 
rotating fields 120° apart electrically, as shown in the waveform for 
three-phase power in Chap. 2. A cutaway diagram of a three-phase 
induction motor is shown in Fig. 3.44.
Current is induced in the rotor by the rotating fields of the stator. 
As the rotor rotates, the relative speed of the rotor and fields decreases 
as the motor speeds up. If the rotor speed were to reach the rotating 
field speed, the rotor would provide no torque. The difference 
between the rotor speed and the synchronous speed is called slip. 
When loaded, standard motors have between 2 and 3 percent slip; a 
three-phase 60-Hz motor typically runs at 1725 to 1750 rpm as 
opposed to a calculated speed of 1800 rpm.
Induction motors are the most commonly used AC motors in 
industrial automation and are produced in standard frame sizes up 
to about 500 kW or 670 horsepower. This makes them easily 
interchangeable, though European and North American standards 
are different.
Single-Phase AC Induction Motors
Most single-phase induction motors have squirrel cage rotors and a 
single-phase distributed stator winding. Some single-phase induction 
motors use a wound rotor, but these are far less common. The squirrel 
cage motor takes its name from its shape—a ring at either end of the 
rotor connected by bars running along its length, forming a cage shape.
Single-phase induction motors are classified by the methods used 
to start them. Some common types are resistance-start or split-phase, 
capacitor start, capacitor run, and shaded pole.
The split-phase induction motor has a main winding and an 
auxiliary winding on the stator. The auxiliary winding is used for

starting as described in the reluctance synchronous motor. The two 
windings are placed 90 electrical degrees apart and the currents of the 
two windings are therefore phase shifted from each other. This 
produces a starting torque; the auxiliary winding can then be removed 
from the circuit using a centrifugal switch as described previously.
If a capacitor is placed in series with the auxiliary winding, a 
greater phase angle is created, creating a higher starting torque. This 
method of starting is known as a capacitor start motor. The cost of this 
motor is slightly higher than that of the split-phase type, though 
because the circuit is only used for starting an inexpensive AC 
electrolytic capacitor can be used.
In a capacitor run motor, the starting capacitor and auxiliary 
winding are not removed from the circuit while at full speed. This 
requires a different kind of capacitor, usually an AC paper-oil type. 
Although the capacitor is more expensive than the electrolytic type, 
the centrifugal switch is removed, reducing the cost. Starting torque 
is not as high as that of the capacitor start type; however, the motor is 
quieter running.
If both optimum starting and optimum running torque are 
desired, a combination starting method called capacitor-start capacitor-
run can be used. This places an electrolytic capacitor in series with the 
auxiliary winding and a smaller value paper-oil-type capacitor in 
series with the main winding. This is a more expensive motor than 
the others; however, it provides the best performance.
Shaded pole motors use the salient pole construction method 
described previously in the synchronous motor. The main winding is 
wound on the salient poles, but a short-circuited copper turn is placed 
between the main coil and the rotor, “shading” the magnetic flux as it 
rotates. This creates a small starting torque. This method is used in 
low torque applications, such as fans or small devices.
A resistance start motor is a split-phase induction motor with a 
resistance inserted in series with the start-up winding, creating a 
starting torque. The resistance provides assistance in the starting and 
initial direction of rotation without producing excess current. Starting 
torque in a resistance start motor is higher than that of a shaded pole 
or capacitor run motor, but not as high as a capacitor start.
3.6.2 DC Motors
A DC motor places the armature winding on the rotor and the field 
windings on the stator, which is the opposite of the AC motors 
described previously. It is designed to run on DC power, though it 
alternates the direction of current flow in the windings through 
commutation. The stator has salient or projecting poles excited by 
one or more field windings; these produce a magnetic field that is 
symmetrical around the pole axis, also called the field or direct axis. 
The voltage induced in the armature winding alternates by using a 
commutator-brush combination as a mechanical rectifier. Alternatively, 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
127
a brushless DC motor uses an external electronic switch synchronized 
to the position of the rotor.
The field and armature windings can be connected in a variety of 
ways to provide different performance characteristics. The field 
windings can be connected in series, in shunt (parallel with the 
armature), or as a combination of both, called a compound motor. DC 
motors can also have a PM.
Brushed DC Motors
The field winding is placed on the stator to excite the field poles and 
the armature winding is placed on the rotor. The commutator consists 
of a split ring connected to each end of the rotor windings. DC voltage 
is then applied to the brushes; as the rotor turns, the brushes 
alternately contact the different halves of the ring, changing the 
direction of the current flow and thereby creating an alternating field. 
This field never fully aligns with the salient poles of the stator, which 
keeps the rotor moving.
More than one set of rings and poles can be and often are used in 
larger DC motors. The distance between the centers of adjacent poles 
is known as pole pitch, while the difference between the two sides of 
the coil is called coil pitch. If the coil pitch and pole pitch are equal, it 
is called a full-pitch coil. A coil pitch that is less than a pole pitch is 
known as a short pitch or fractional pitch coil. AC motors often have 
short pitch coils, while DC motors have full-pitch coils. Figure 3.45 
illustrates the construction of a brushed DC motor.

Disadvantages of Brushes
Because brushes constantly wear as they press against the commutator 
rings, they eventually have to be replaced. Brushes also create sparks 
as they cross the insulating gaps in the commutator. At high speeds the 
brushes have a harder time maintaining contact with the commutator; 
this also creates sparking. Sparking can pit the commutator surface, 
creating irregularities and making the contacts of the brushes bounce, 
which causes even more sparking. This can overheat and eventually 
destroy the commutator and brushes. Brushed DC motors also create 
quite a bit of electrical noise because of this sparking, and maximum 
speed is limited.
Many of the problems created by the brushes are eliminated in 
brushless motors, which last longer and are more efficient in their use 
of energy.
Some of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in 
the brushless design. In this motor, the mechanical “rotating switch” 
or commutator brush gear assembly is replaced by an external 
electronic switch synchronized to the rotor’s position. Brushless 
motors are typically 85 to 90 percent efficient or more (higher efficiency 
for a brushless electric motor of up to 96.5 percent was reported by 
researchers at the Tokai University in Japan in 2009), whereas DC 
motors with brushes are typically 75 to 80 percent efficient.
Brushless DC Motors
The brushless DC motor replaces the brushes and commutator with 
an electronically alternating pulse that is synchronized to the position 
of the rotor. Hall effect sensors are used to sense the position of PMs 
on the rotor and the driving coils are activated sequentially. Coils are 
usually arranged in groups of three, acting very similarly to a three-
phase synchronous motor.
Another method of sensing rotor position is by detecting the 
back-EMF in the inactivated driving coils. This allows the drive 
electronics to sense both speed and position of the motor. These 
motors are often used in applications where very accurate speed 
control is required.
Brushless DC motors last much longer than those with brushes 
and run cooler than AC motors. They are very quiet from an electrical 
noise standpoint as well as audibly. Since they do not create sparks 
like motors with brushes, they are better suited to chemical or 
explosive environments.
Coreless or Ironless DC Motors
A motor capable of very rapid acceleration is the coreless or ironless 
motor. This motor makes use of a very lightweight rotor by making it 
almost entirely of the windings themselves with no steel or 
ferromagnetic material in the rotor. This method of construction can 
be used for brush and commutator or brushless motors. The rotor can 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
129
either be placed inside the stator magnets or form a cylindrical basket 
shape outside the stator. Windings for these rotors are often 
encapsulated in epoxy for physical stability. These types of motors 
are also typically rather small. They also tend to generate quite a bit 
of heat since there is no metal to act as a heat sink; this often necessitates 
an additional cooling method, such as forcing air over the rotor 
windings.
Universal Motors and Series Wound DC Motors
DC motors with the field and armature windings placed in series 
allow the motor to run on either AC or DC power. These motors are 
called universal or series wound motors. Though very flexible as far 
as power usage, they have several disadvantages when comparing 
them with standard AC or DC varieties.
As a universal motor increases its speed, its torque output decreases, 
making it impractical for high-speed high torque applications. Without 
a load attached, these motors also tend to “run away,” potentially 
damaging the motor. A permanent load such as a cooling fan is often 
attached to the shaft to limit this problem. The high starting torque can 
be useful in some starting applications.
Universal motors operate better using DC than AC and are best 
for intermittent use. Accurate speed control can also be problematic.
3.6.3 Linear Motors
Linear motors operate in a similar manner to standard electric motors 
except that the rotor and stator are placed next to each other in a linear 
fashion, or “unrolled.” Generally linear motors are classified as either 
low or high acceleration. AC linear induction motors (LIMs) are used 
for high acceleration applications. Typically they use a powered stator 
winding with a conducting plate as the rotor carrying the load.
Linear synchronous motors (LSMs) are used for larger motors 
requiring high speed or high torque. They also use a powered stator 
winding but use an array of alternating pole magnets mounted to the 
load-bearing frame as a rotor. These motors have a lower acceleration 
than the LIM type.
3.6.4 Servomotors and Stepper Motors
Servomotors are specially designed and built for use in feedback 
control systems. This requires a high speed of response, which 
servomotors achieve by having a low rotor inertia. Servomotors are 
therefore smaller in diameter and longer than typical AC and DC 
motor form factors. They must often operate at low or zero speed, 
which makes them typically larger than conventional motors with a 
similar power rating. Peak torque values are often 3x continuous 
torque ratings, but may be as high as 10x.
Servo power ratings can range from a fraction of a watt to several 
hundred watts. Within a specific power range, different inertias may 

130 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
also be specified by some motor manufacturers. They are used in a 
wide variety of industrial applications, such as robots, machine tools, 
positioning systems, and process control. Both AC and DC servomotors 
are used in industry.
Brushless servomotors often use sinusoidal commutation to 
produce smooth motion at lower speeds. If the more traditional 
trapezoidal or “six-step” DC commutation method is used, motors 
tend to “cog” or produce a jerky motion at low speed, partially 
because of the low inertia of servomotors. Motors rotate because of 
the torque produced by the interacting magnetic fields of the rotor 
and stator. The torque is proportional to the magnitudes of the fields 
multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Maximum torque 
is produced when the rotor and stator angles are at 90°. Torque can 
then be controlled by varying the angle between the two waveforms. 
To detect the relative positions of the rotor and stator, a commutation 
encoder can be used to find the phase angles relative to each other. 
These are incremental encoders with additional tracks for regulating 
motor commutation.
Servomotors are driven by servo drives that provide precise 
velocity, torque, and position control by using encoder, resolver, and/
or current signals that comprise the feedback components of a 
servomechanism. Additional components of a servomechanism 
actuator are a home switch to establish a reference position and 
overtravel switches to prevent actuator or tooling damage.
DC Servos
DC servomotors may be separately excited or PM DC motors. The 
principle of operation is the same as described in the DC motor 
section 3.6.2 previously. They are normally controlled by varying the 
armature voltage, which has a large resistance, ensuring that the 
torque-speed ratio is linear. The torque response is very fast in these 
motors, making them ideal for quick changes in position or speed.
AC Servos
AC servos are robust in construction and have a lower inertia than 
DC servomotors; however, they are nonlinear in their torque-speed 
response. They also have lower torque capability than DC servos of a 
similar size.
Most AC servos are two-phase squirrel cage–type motors. The 
stator has two distributed windings displaced 90° electrically. One 
winding, the reference or fixed phase winding, is connected to a 
constant voltage source. The other winding is called the control phase 
and is supplied with a variable voltage at the same frequency as the 
reference phase. For industrial applications, the frequency is usually 
60 Hz. The control phase voltage is supplied from a servo amplifier, 
which controls rotation direction by shifting the phase plus or minus 
90° from the reference voltage.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
131
Figure 3.46 shows a typical AC servomotor with its electrical 
cable connections. A gearbox is often bolted to the motor flange.
The squirrel cage rotor has a high resistance like the DC rotor 
windings; varying this resistance provides different torque-speed 
characteristics. Lowering the resistance decreases the torque at low 
speed and increases it at higher speeds, making the curve very 
nonlinear. This is not desirable in control systems.
Two-phase AC servomotors are built as high-speed low torque 
actuators and are usually geared down severely to achieve the desired 
result. Typical speeds of these motors are 3000 to 5000 rpm.
Stepper Motors
A stepper motor is a DC motor that rotates a specific number of 
degrees based on its construction, that is, number of poles. It converts 
digital pulse inputs to shaft rotation; a train of pulses is made to turn 
the motor shaft by steps. This allows the position to be controlled 
precisely without a feedback mechanism. Typical resolutions of 
commercially available stepper motors range from a few steps per 
revolution to as many as 400. They can follow signals of up to 1200 
pulses per second and may be rated up to several horsepower.
There are several different types of stepper motors, including 
single and multiple stack variable reluctance motors and PM types. 
Variable reluctance motors operate by exciting the poles of the stator, 
causing the rotor to align itself with the magnetic field. The poles may 
be energized in combinations, allowing the rotor to line up between 
stator poles as well as directly with them. Multiple stack versions 
arrange the poles in several levels or “stacks,” allowing finer 
resolution positioning by phasing from stack to stack.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
PM steppers use magnets for the rotor poles. They have a higher 
inertia than variable reluctance motors and therefore cannot accelerate 
as fast; however, they produce more torque per ampere of stator current. 
Figure 3.47 shows a four-pole stepper arrangement with PMs; the A, B, 
C, and D poles are energized in sequence in one polarity after which the 
polarities are reversed to achieve eight positions per revolution.
Hybrid stepper motors use a combination of variable reluctance 
and PM motor techniques. This provides maximum power in a small 
package size. Hybrid stepper motors are probably the most commonly 
used type of stepper in industrial automation.
Though steppers can be a lower-cost alternative to servos for 
positioning applications since feedback is not required, stepper 
motors do not provide nearly as much torque as servomotors, 
especially at higher speeds.
Command signals for stepper motors are usually low power logic 
circuits using TTL or CMOS transistors, power amplification stages 
are placed between the pulse train generators and the motors.
3.6.5 Variable Frequency Drives
Variable frequency drives (VFDs) are solid-state power converters. 
They first convert an incoming AC voltage into DC, then reconstruct 
an AC waveform by switching the DC power rapidly at the desired 
frequency and voltage to approximate a sinusoidal signal. The 
rectifier that converts the incoming voltage to DC is usually a three-
phase full wave bridge; single-phase power may also be used for 
smaller VFDs. Figure 3.48 is a diagram of this system.
In order to deliver a consistent torque value while varying speed, 
the applied voltage must be adjusted proportionally with the

frequency. If a motor is rated for 480VAC at 60 Hz, the voltage must 
be reduced to 240VAC for 30 Hz, 120VAC for 15 Hz, and so on. This 
is sometimes called volts per hertz control. Additional methods such 
as vector control and direct torque control allow the magnetic flux 
and mechanical torque of the motor to be controlled more precisely.
The stage that converts the DC back into a sinusoidal form is 
known as an inverter circuit. This circuit usually uses pulse-width 
modulation (PWM) to adjust both output voltage frequency and 
voltage as required. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.49.
Newer drives often use special transistors called IGBTs, or 
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors. These are electronic switches that 
operate over a wide current range, have high efficiency and fast 
switching, making them ideal for PWM.
A microprocessor is used to control the operation of the VFD. 
Typically there are a range of parameters that can be set to control the 
operation of the drive: acceleration and deceleration, maximum 
speed and velocity set points, and peak current are some of the more 
common values. Digital I/O connections for start/stop, alarms, and 
speed preset selection are also common. These may be hardwired or 
communications based. Analog values may also be interfaced with 
the drive physically as in a 0 to 10 V or 4 to 20 mA signal or via 
mapping communication values from a controller.
An OIT may also be mounted on the front of the drive for setting 
parameters and viewing operational data, such as current or speed. 
These may be built into the drive or removable so that it can be shared 
between VFDs. Like servo systems, VFDs can also be used with 
feedback devices such as encoders and resolvers to improve control; 
however, typically a controller such as a PLC or DCS is used as an 
intermediary between the device and the drive.

VFDs can be operated at speeds above the speed listed on the 
nameplate of the motor, depending on the application. At ranges 
above 150 percent, it is usually recommended that a gearbox be used. 
Another consideration when planning a system using a VFD is the 
distance of the motor from the drive. At distances over 150 ft or so, a 
phenomenon called reflected wave can occur because of the rapid 
switching of the transistors. This can cause high voltages to be present 
in the cabling and motor. There are a number of ways to mitigate this, 
including filters and using inverter duty motors, but ideally the drive 
should be located relatively close to the motor.
3.7 Mechanisms and Machine Elements
Mechanisms or machine elements make up the basic components of 
mechanical systems. The primary purpose of a mechanism is to 
transfer or transform force from one form or direction into another. 
The most basic elements of mechanisms were described as “simple 
machines” by Renaissance scientists and included the following:

Gears and cams were developed as an offshoot of several of these 
elements and are also important types of mechanisms. The classical 
concept of decomposing machines into these simple elements still 
has relevance today, though there are elements that do not fall directly 
into these categories. Mechanisms and simple machines can be 
thought of as the building blocks of more complex machines.
Machine elements include components that allow power to be 
transmitted from one mechanism to another. Elements such as 
bearings, couplings, clutches, brakes, belts, and chains are examples 
of components that facilitate movement.
3.7.1 Cam-Driven Devices
One method of translating rotary motion into linear motion is the use 
of a cam on a rotating shaft. By offsetting the center of a round or oval 
disc on the shaft, the cam surface will vary in distance from the shaft 
center. This can be used to drive a shaft linearly; the linear shaft is 
often called a follower. Springs are used to keep the end of the follower 
in contact with the cam as it rotates. Figure 3.50 shows a cam and 
follower arrangement.
Cams are used extensively in line shaft–type applications. They 
allow stations to be synchronized with a master motor and run at 
higher speeds than standard asynchronous applications. The 
downside is that they are more difficult to modify movement profiles 
as the cams must be machined or replaced.

3.7.2 Ratchet and Pawl Systems
A ratchet is a mechanism that allows a linear or rotary movement in 
one direction only. Movement in the opposite direction is prevented by 
a spring-loaded pawl that engages teeth on the ratchet as it turns. The 
teeth are angled such that the pawl cannot be forced out of the slots 
between the ratchet teeth when the ratchet is reversed. Figure 3.51 
illustrates this arrangement.
Ratchet and pawl systems are used in lifting mechanisms such as 
jacks and winding mechanisms, and even plastic cable ties. Ratchet 
gearing may be used to transmit intermittent motion or to simply 
prevent the reverse movement of the gear.
3.7.3 Gearing and Gear Reduction
Gearing is used to translate rotary motion from one speed, direction, 
or force into another. A gear is a mechanism, usually round, that has 
teeth that engage with another toothed device. The mating interface 
between the two machine parts is called a spline.
Gears can be combined into “trains,” which can change speeds 
and therefore torque outputs incrementally rather than all at once. 
They may have teeth on the outside or inside circumference or a 
combination of both. Gear tooth profiles are almost always slightly 
curved in a shape called an involute curve. This curve is based on the 
diameter of the gear and is important in keeping gear movement and 
interfacing smooth and consistent.
Gear reduction is the process of converting a high-speed low 
torque component, such as a servomotor, into a lower-speed higher 
torque output without creating excessive backlash. This is usually 
done with a self-contained gearbox, which also may change the shaft 
or rotation direction.
The simplest type of gear is the cylindrical spur gear. Spur gears only 
mesh if the gear axles are parallel with each other. There are two types

Ratchet and pawl.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e

of spur gears: internal and external. External spur gears transmit drive 
between parallel shafts, making them rotate in opposite directions. This 
is illustrated in Fig. 3.52. They work well at moderate speeds but can be 
noisy at higher speeds. Internal spur gears are spur gear arrangements 
that transmit motion to shafts rotating in the same direction.
Helical gears have teeth cut at an angle to the axis. As with the spur 
gear arrangements, they can be arranged in an internal or external 
manner. Unlike spur gears, however, helical gears can also mesh on 
nonparallel axes. Whereas spur gears must be parallel but produce 
thrust only perpendicular to the load, helical gears produce axial 
thrust when arranged with parallel shafts. They may be arranged with 
the shafts at an angle to each other, even completely perpendicular—
his is known as a crossed helical gear arrangement. Figure 3.53 
illustrates a set of helical gears at a slight angle to each other.
Helical gears can take more torque than spur gears and are often 
used in higher-speed applications. The higher torque causes more 
axial thrust, however, which can be mitigated by using double helical 
gears. These are the equivalent of two mirrored helical gears stacked 
on top of each other and are sometimes called herringbone gears. 
Because of the more gradual engagement of the teeth, helical gears 
are quieter than spur gears. The more complex profile makes double 
helical gears more expensive than helical or spur gears.
Bevel gears are conical gears with the teeth cut at an angle to the 
shaft. They are designed to connect two shafts on intersecting axes, as 
shown in Fig. 3.54. Straight bevel gears have teeth that are cut radially 
toward the apex of the conical section. Spiral bevel gears have curved 
oblique teeth that reduce noise and improve the smoothness of 
meshing between gears, similar to the effect of the helical gear.
FIGURE 3.52 Spur gears.

139
Hypoid bevel gears are a combination of spiral bevel gears and 
worm gears. The axes of these gears do not intersect. The distance 
between the axes is called the offset. Hypoid bevel gears allow a 
greater gear ratio than regular bevel gears, making them a good 
choice for gear reduction in mechanical differentials.
Crown gears have teeth that project perpendicular to the plane of 
the gear or parallel with the shaft. They are considered to be part of 
the bevel gear grouping and are sometimes called contrate gears. 
They may be meshed with other bevel-type gears or spur gears.
A worm gear is used to transmit motion at a right angle to its shaft. 
They have line tooth contact and are often meshed with disk-type 
gears, sometimes called the wheel or worm wheel. A worm gear 
resembles a screw and may have one or more toothed tracks running 
around it, as shown in Fig. 3.55. Because the pitch of the worm can be 
made quite small, high ratios of gear reduction can be achieved; 
however, this is at the cost of efficiency. When a worm and gear 
combination is used, the worm can always drive the gear; however, the 
reverse is not always true. If the ratio is high enough, the teeth may 
lock together because the force exerted by the wheel cannot overcome 
the friction of the worm gear. This can be an advantage if it is preferable 
to hold a worm-driven object in position against the force of gravity.
Worm gearing can be divided into two general categories—fine 
and coarse pitch gearing. The main purpose of fine pitch gearing is to 
transmit motion rather than power, while the opposite is true of 
coarse pitch.
A rack is a linear toothed rod or bar that usually engages with a 
round gear called a pinion gear. This is a common method of converting 
rotational motion into linear motion and vice versa. As with other gear 
types, teeth may be cut straight or at an angle to the axis of motion. A 
rack is often used in gear theory as a gear of infinite radius.
FIGURE 3.55 
Worm and gear 
combination.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
A rack and pinion system is an excellent method of moving a 
linear axis rapidly over a long distance. The rack is usually the fixed 
component, and the pinion gear is rotated from the traveling part of 
the system, which is guided by linear bearings. Figure 3.56 shows an 
industrial rack and pinion.
Planetary or epicyclic gearing is a method of combining gears in 
such a way that one or more of the gear axes is movable, usually one 
rotating around another. There are various arrangements that 
accomplish this using bevel or spur-type gears. Epicyclic gearing is a 
very compact method of achieving gear reduction and is often used in 
servo gearboxes. Figure 3.57 shows a cutaway of a planetary gearbox.

3.7.4 Bearings and Pulleys
Bearings allow sliding or rolling contact between two or more parts. 
They fall into three general categories based on their purpose: radial 
bearings that support rotating shafts or journals, thrust bearings that 
support axial loads on rotating elements, and guide bearings that 
support and guide moving elements in a straight line. Bearings are 
also often described by the principle of operation or the direction of 
the applied load.
Bearings that provide sliding contact are known as plain bearings. 
Relative motion between the parts of plain bearings may be of the 
lubricated type, either a hydrodynamic interface (a wedge or film 
buildup of lubricant is produced by the bearing surface) or hydrostatic 
interface (a lubricant is introduced into the mating surfaces under 
pressure). The motion interface may also be unlubricated with a 
material such as nylon, brass, or Teflon. Plain bearings are also known 
as bushings when they operate on a shaft.
Rolling contact–type bearings use rolling elements, such as balls 
or rollers, in place of lubricants or direct contact. Figure 3.58 shows a 
cutaway of a roller bearing with cylindrical rollers. Roller bearings 
generally have a much lower friction coefficient than plain bearings 
and therefore have less energy loss. They also generally hold tighter 
tolerances and are consequently more precise. Normally, the rolling 
elements and the races they ride in are hardened to reduce wear. 
Roller-type bearings are also generally shielded or sealed to reduce 
the chance of contaminants entering the bearing races.
The use of linear roller bearings and rails is one of the most 
common guiding methods for linear movement. They often support 
ball screw or worm gear–driven axes in motion control applications. 
A rail with two bearing blocks is shown in Fig. 3.59.

142 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
FIGURE 3.59 Linear bearings and rail.
An air bearing is a pneumatic device that uses a film of air between 
surfaces. They are often used in moving heavy loads on a floor 
surface, similar to a hovercraft or air hockey table. Rotary, spindle, 
and slide air bearings provide almost no resistance to motion and are 
very precise. Air bearings may be externally pressurized with a 
continuous flow or generate a film of air from the relative motion of 
the two surfaces.
A pulley, sometimes called a sheave, is a wheel or drum mounted on 
an axle. It generally has a groove or channel between two flanges that 
carries a belt, chain, or cable. Pulleys can change the direction or speed 
of a motion, much in the same manner as gearing. Pulleys of different 
dimensions transfer speed changes in proportion to the diameters or 
circumferences of the pulleys. For example, if a pair of pulleys has a 
diameter ratio of 2 to 1, the speed will be increased proportionally.
Pulleys are often used with flexible belts in industrial applications. 
It is common to use a steel-reinforced toothed belt in a belt-driven 
actuator to provide linear motion. In this case, the pulley will also 
have grooves in the surface parallel to the shaft, as shown in Fig. 3.60. 
These are called positive drive belts. Belt and pulley combinations 
without positive drive are known as friction drives.
The number of degrees that the belt is in contact with the pulley 
is called the wrap angle. Belt and pulley combinations should be 
selected such that the wrap angle on the smaller pulley is at least 120° 
for a friction drive belt. For a toothed belt, the wrap angle can be 
closer to 90°. Any less than this can cause the belt to skip teeth.
Pulleys can be arranged in combinations that provide mechanical 
advantage along with the speed reduction. For any given pair of 
pulleys, it is usually best to not exceed a ratio of 8 to 1, and 6 to 1 is a 

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
143
reasonable maximum. If a greater ratio is required, it is best to use a 
compound drive of several pulleys. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.61.
3.7.5 Servomechanisms
A servomechanism is a combination of mechanical and control hardware 
that uses feedback to affect the control of a system. The feedback is in 
the form of an error or difference between the sensed parameter and 
FIGURE 3.60 Positive drive (toothed) pulley and belt.

its desired value. Servomechanisms generally operate on the principle 
of negative feedback, where the error is subtracted from the output. 
A servomechanism is known as a closed-loop system. This has already 
been described in PID Control (section 2.2.2) and the Servomotor 
(section 3.6.4) sections of this book; however, it is important to 
mention that servomechanisms control not only position, speed, and 
torque, but may control variables such as temperature, pressure, or 
anything measurable. An example of a servomechanism that does not 
involve a servomotor is a hydraulic actuator that has its speed and 
position controlled by a spool valve using feedback from an externally 
mounted analog position sensor. Figure 3.62 illustrates the physical 
layout of a servo system.
3.7.6 Ball Screws and Belt-Driven Linear Actuators
A ball screw is a mechanical linear actuator that translates rotary 
motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides 
a spiral raceway for ball bearings, which act as a precision screw. The 
ball assembly acts as the nut, while the threaded shaft is the screw. 
They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in 
situations where high precision is necessary.
The pitch of a ball screw determines the potential linear speed of 
a linear actuator as well as its ability to hold a load against the force 
of gravity. Higher pitch (more turns per inch) provides more precision 
and a greater ability to stop a vertical load from turning the screw, but 
it requires a higher motor speed to move at the same rate as a lower 
pitch screw. Figure 3.63 shows a 12 mm ball screw and nut with a 
4 mm screw pitch.
Belt-driven linear actuators use a toothed belt and gears to move a 
carriage attached to the belt. The linear speed of a belt-driven actuator 
is typically faster than that of a ball screw but can be less rugged and 
precise. Belt-driven actuators are more likely to slip with a heavy load; 
toothed belts can even be damaged if the load is beyond the rating of 
the actuator as teeth can be stripped off the belt. Figure 3.64 shows a 
cutaway of an actuator showing the belt inside the sealed housing.

3.7.7 Linkages and Couplings
A linkage is a combination of rigid elements and hinges or joints that 
constrain element movement. A linkage can be used to multiply or 
translate force or motion between mechanisms or components. 
Examples of linkages are scissor lifts and four bar linkages.
The simplest linkage is the lever. By pinning a point on the length 
of the lever to a fixed location, the lever pivots around that point, the 
fulcrum. A point nearer to the fulcrum will rotate in a smaller arc than 
a point farther from the fulcrum, creating a multiplication of distance 
or velocity. With this comes a reduction in the force output; the reverse 
of this is also true, with a large movement driving a smaller one, the 
force output is multiplied proportionally. This is known as a mechanical 
advantage.
A four bar linkage is a group of four joints and four bars that allows 
points on the linkage to move in restrained ways when one or two of 
the joints are fixed in a location. Depending on the lengths of the bars 
and whether the joints can rotate through a full circular motion, 
different arcs and motions can be created, as shown in Fig. 3.65.
FIGURE 3.64 Belt-driven actuator.
FIGURE 3.63 
Ball screw.

146 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
This is a type of mechanism that uses a four bar linkage with two 
degrees of freedom known as a pantograph. It allows shapes to be 
duplicated at scaled sizes—a tool especially useful for engraved 
lettering. Similar arrangements can be used to constrain movement in 
mechanisms.
A common type of mechanism that uses a toggle linkage is the 
clamp. A toggle mechanism is a type of four bar linkage that folds 
and locks at a certain position. Some pneumatically driven clamps 
perform a rotate-and-lower movement that is partially cam based, 
but a manual toggle clamp uses a four bar linkage to produce a high 
clamping force, as shown in Fig. 3.66. A well-known manufacturer of 
toggle and other types of clamps is DE-STA-CO.
A coupling connects two shafts or rotating members together. A 
coupling can be rigid or flexible. A rigid coupling has the advantage 
of keeping shafts precisely aligned and holding the ends very securely. 
Flexible couplings allow for misalignment and tend to dampen 
vibration. Helical flexible couplings are commonly used to drive a 
shaft with a servomotor, AC motor, or DC motor in automated 
systems. Another name for a helical coupling is a beam coupling; an 
example is shown in Fig. 3.67.
A Lovejoy or spider coupling has two metal-toothed hubs and an 
elastomer insert or “spider” to reduce vibrations. The three parts fit 
together with a press fit. These are also used extensively in servo 
systems but are not as forgiving to angular misalignment as helical 
couplings.
Universal joints allow shafts to be driven at an angle, as do gear 
joints. These are often used in power transmission. For lighter 
applications, hoses or bellows-type couplings are sometimes used for 
nonaligned shafts.

3.7.8 Clutches and Brakes
A clutch allows two rotating elements to be engaged and disengaged 
with each other. The most common type of clutch is a friction clutch. 
There are several different types of friction clutch, including conical, 
radially expanding, contraction band, and friction disk clutches. It is 
common for the driving and driven members of friction clutches to 
be held in contact with each other by spring pressure. They may then 
be actuated to the open position by pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical, 
magnetic, or even centrifugal force. Clutch surfaces can be made of a 
variety of materials, including metals, ceramics, resin-wire fabric, 
and rubbers with a high durometer.
Brakes are used to rapidly stop a rotating member, also using 
frictional methods. Typically, brakes use a disk or pad to contact a 
rotating surface, such as a plate or shaft. In industrial applications, 
most brakes are composed of semimetallic, organic, or ceramic 
materials. Like clutches, brakes may be actuated in a number of ways, 
including pneumatics and hydraulics, electrical, or mechanical 
methods.
A clutch brake is a device that either engages a clutch to provide 
motion from a rotating to a nonrotating member or quickly brings the 

148 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
driven member to a stop when the clutch is not engaged. Clutch 
brakes are used extensively in conveyor applications and often in 
other servo and motor-driven machinery.
3.8 Structure and Framing
Machines are often built with a welded or bolted steel frame as a base 
structure. Today, however, more and more machines are built of 
aluminum extrusion or pipe-based structures. There are also many 
small structural assembly components available from machine part 
vendors.
Electrical components must be kept in an enclosed space to 
protect components or prevent personnel from contact with voltages. 
There are a number of classifications associated with this protection.
3.8.1 Steel Framing
Most steel frames are welded for rigidity and permanence. Steel 
tubing, flat-stock, and angle pieces are cut to length and welded 
together, generally using a jig, clamp, or fixture to ensure alignment. 
Because steel rusts or oxidizes, it usually has to be cleaned by grinding 
before being primed and painted. For food-processing or medical 
applications, frames are often made of stainless steel to eliminate the 
need for paint, which can cause contamination.
Premade welded steel bases can be purchased as a standard 
product from various manufacturers. These generally consist of a 
welded tube steel base, a ground steel top plate for mounting 
components, and adjustable feet and holes for bolting them to the 
floor (leveling feet). An example is shown in Fig. 3.68.
FIGURE 3.68 Welded machine base.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
149
Frames may also be bolted together. This is often done for one of 
two reasons. One, the relative cost compared with welding is much 
cheaper; two, the ability to unbolt the frame later makes for easy 
transport or modification. Using fasteners to build a frame is not as 
desirable as welding, especially on heavy-duty frames that may be 
subject to vibration.
If components are to be mounted to a frame, a piece of steel is 
often welded to the frame to be machined to a specific thickness 
afterward. This machine pad can then be ground, drilled, and tapped 
for precise location of a component or subassembly.
During the welding and machining process, stresses are induced 
into the welded frame. Prior to assembly, these stresses are often 
relieved by heating the frame in an oven or attaching a stress-relieving 
vibrator to the frame. This is especially important on larger frames or 
frames that have critical dimensions.
Shims
A shim is a thin piece of material used to fill a space or increase a 
dimension by a slight amount. It is used as an adjustment method 
and is often placed between two objects that have been bolted together 
as a spacer.
Shim stock can be purchased in varying widths and thicknesses 
to be cut into desired sizes. For industrial machinery, shim stock is 
usually made of metal, although plastic composites are sometimes 
used. Shim stock is also available in a laminated foil, which can be 
peeled off a stack to build up a surface.
Dowels and Dowel Pins
A dowel or dowel pin is a solid cylindrical piece of material that can 
be pressed into a hole as a locating device. Dowels in industrial 
machinery are usually made of hardened steel. Dowel material is 
usually machined to a very tight tolerance. This material is available 
in long sections called dowel rods, which are then cut into pins. The 
ends of the pins are then usually lightly chamfered. Figure 3.69 shows 
a pair of dowel pins.
FIGURE 3.69 
Dowel pins.

150 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Dowel pins may have a slightly smaller diameter than the hole 
into which they are inserted so that they float freely, or they may have 
the same diameter as the hole, which is then reamed for a press fit.
Using bolts as fasteners introduces mechanical play into the 
positioning of the mounted piece. Typically, fasteners have clearances 
because of the oversizing of the through holes. This is proportional to 
the size of the fastener. By using dowels for precise location, this 
mechanical play can be reduced by up to ten times or eliminated 
altogether. The use of dowels does often increase the amount of 
assembly and disassembly time for components, but when precision 
is required, it is well worth the added cost.
Dowels are not meant to provide structural support. Any more 
than two dowels in a single assembly is not recommended. As soon 
as a side load is applied a few times, the brunt of the force will be 
transferred to one of the dowels, making the others redundant. It also 
makes it very difficult to reassemble the pieces if they are ever taken 
apart. Fasteners or keys and slots should be used to take the side load 
forces. Dowels should be used only as a precision locating method.
Keys, Keyseats, and Fixture Keys
A key is used to transmit torque between a shaft and hub. If both 
shaft and hub have a rectangular slot or keyseat placed in the axial 
direction, a key can be assembled into the grooves, providing a 
positive surface for the motor shaft to exert force against.
Keyseats or keyways are sized based on the diameter of the shaft 
in both width and depth. ANSI provides a table for sizing the key size 
and keyseat depth. Key stock and bar stock are available in standard 
or metric dimensions, and their cross sections may be rectangular or 
square-shaped.
Figure 3.70 shows a keyed motor shaft with a key inserted. 
Since this key is captured (that is, the keyway does not extend to 
FIGURE 3.70 
Keyed motor shaft.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
151
the end of the shaft), it must be inserted before sliding it into a 
coupling.
Fixture keys are used to accurately locate fixtures or machine 
components. Typically, they are assembled into a hole or a machined 
slot. There are many different types of fixture keys, from simple 
square or rectangular keys inserted into slots in two mating surfaces 
(Fig. 3.71) to stepped or sine-type keys. They are made in metric or 
standard dimensions, usually of hardened steel. Socket head screws 
are sometimes threaded into the key for fastening.
Unlike dowels, fixture keys are designed to spread a load over a 
surface and are, therefore, appropriate for perpendicular support, 
that is, “side loading.”
Machine Pads and Grind Spacers
Machine pads are pieces of flat stock that are welded to a frame in 
order to have something mounted to them. They often have tapped 
or through holes to accommodate the bolts for the mating assembly. 
There are two important reasons for using machine pads rather than 
mounting directly to a frame: to provide thickness for tapping or 
structural integrity and to provide a surface that can be ground to 
make it flat and parallel to other surfaces.
For large assemblies that are to be mounted onto a machine pad 
or other flat surface, grind spacers are often designed into a machine. 
These are pieces of metal that are purposely inserted between the flat 
machined surface on a frame and an assembly. This allows them to be 
ground to different thicknesses to make up for small differences in 
parallel surfaces. Rather than having to grind a large assembly or 
pads on a frame, the spacers can be easily removed and ground 
individually.
Fasteners
Fasteners are any device used to attach two pieces of material together. 
They include such classifications as rivets, bolts, and screws.
Fixture Key

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
A rivet is a fastener used to attach items permanently. There are 
several different types of rivets including solid, tubular, or blind 
rivets—also known as “pop” rivets. Rivets consist of a shaft with a 
head on one end and are deformed after being inserted through a hole 
that passes through both pieces to be joined. This creates a connection 
that must be ground or drilled to remove. Solid rivets are typically 
deformed with a hammer, a rivet compression tool, or a crimping tool, 
which may be hydraulic, pneumatic, or electromagnetic. These types 
of riveting methods are used near the edge of the fastened materials so 
that the riveting tool can access both sides of the rivet.
For connections made away from the edge of the materials, a 
blind rivet, as shown in Fig. 3.72, is used. This is a tubular rivet with 
a large head that has a shaft with a mandrel through the center. The 
rivet is inserted through the hole and a special tool is used to pull the 
mandrel head into the rivet. The mandrel is designed to break off 
when enough force is applied.
Rivets may be made of steel, aluminum, or various other metals. 
In industrial automation, one of the most common uses of rivets is to 
attach wireway or other components permanently to an electrical 
backplane.
A bolt or screw is a fastener with a threaded shaft with a head on 
one end that is used to apply torque, driving the fastener into a 
threaded hole or a nut. Screws are usually used to drive into a hole 
without the use of a nut and often create their own threads in the hole, 
whereas bolts may be threaded into a prethreaded hole or into a nut. 
Bolt and screw heads come in many different shapes, depending on 
the type of tool that is used to drive them. Socket head and hex head 
are common forms of bolts, while Phillips or slotted heads are most 
common with screws. Screw heads can be pan or dome-shaped, round, 
countersunk, or several other forms. Special forms of bolt or screw 
heads also include hex socket, Robertson—or square drive—Torx, 
spanner head, and a variety of so-called “security” heads.

Blind or pop rivet.

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
153
Screws and bolts are usually threaded in a right-handed direction, 
meaning that the fastener must be turned clockwise to tighten and 
counterclockwise to loosen it. Sizes of bolts and screws generally fall 
into standard (SAE) and metric dimensions, which specify the shaft 
diameter and thread pitch.
3.8.2 Aluminum Extrusion
Profiles of extruded aluminum are frequently used for machine 
guarding but can also be used to build machines of substantial size. 
Aluminum sections are available in both metric and standard sizes 
from a variety of manufacturers. There is a wide range of available 
accessories, such as brackets, fasteners, hinges, plastic covers, and 
caps. Profiles are square or rectangular in their cross sections and 
include a “T-slot” in the side for fasteners, panels, or the routing of 
cables or hoses. Common vendors of these extrusion products include 
80/20, Item and Bosch. Figure 3.73 illustrates hardware for joining 
two pieces of aluminum extrusion.
Aluminum extrusion also comes in a variety of different colors, 
although the natural silver/gray anodized color is most common.
While aluminum profile is more expensive than an equivalent 
length of tube steel, this is offset by the cost of welding, painting, and 
labor. Aluminum is not subject to rust and is usually anodized for 
hardness and electrical resistance.
3.8.3 Piping and Other Structural Systems
For lighter-duty applications, structures may be built of threaded 
pipe, angle, and flat stock. As with aluminum extrusion, these 
systems are sold by several different companies. Creform is probably 
FIGURE 3.73 Aluminum extrusion. (Courtesy of Bosch.)

154 
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
the best known of the threaded pipe systems. These types of 
structural systems are often used for carts, roller conveyor stands, 
and racks. Automation elements, such as pick-to-light sensors and 
gravity conveyor rollers, can also be mounted using accessories 
from these systems. Figure 3.74 shows a bin rack made of threaded 
pipe.
On a smaller scale, other vendors, such as Misumi, make structural 
items to mount sensors, gauges, or other devices. These items, 
sometimes known as “tinkertoys” (not to be confused with the 
wooden toy of the same name), are available in metric and standard 
sizes. Small brackets, bearings, gearing systems, and various other 
items are also available from this manufacturer.
3.8.4 Electrical Enclosures and Ratings
Control and electrical components are usually housed in metal or 
nonmetallic enclosures. Enclosures may be made of steel, galvanized 
sheet metal, fiberglass, or plastic. These enclosures are available in 
a wide range of sizes and configurations and from various 
FIGURE 3.74 Pipe structure rack. (Courtesy of Creform.)

C o m p o n e n t s  a n d  H a r d w a r e  
155
manufacturers. They typically have either screw covers or hinged 
doors for access to internal components and wiring.
Sizes range from small junction boxes or push-button boxes to 
large multidoor enclosures. Enclosures are rated for suitability for 
different environments by NEMA and IEC, as explained in the next 
section. A NEMA 12 enclosure is shown in Fig. 3.75. Larger enclosures 
are often manufactured with holes to mount a flange-mounted 
disconnect on the side by the door. These may be specified for 
disconnects from Allen-Bradley, Square D, Cutler-Hammer, or other 
major manufacturers.
Other accessories, such as filtered vents, fans, or even air 
conditioners, are available from enclosure manufacturers. Fluorescent 
lighting that is activated when a door is opened is another standard 
accessory.
Most enclosures are manufactured with studs to hold a metal 
backplane to mount components on. Backplanes may be steel or 
galvanized metal and are usually grounded during panel fabrication. 
Well-known electrical enclosure manufacturers include Hoffman and 
Rittal.

Tables from NEMA 250-2003 are contained in App. D.
IEC and IP Ratings
The IEC also rates both enclosures and other electrical devices for 
suitability in various environments. A rating known as IP, for Ingress 
Protection, is used. This can be converted to an equivalent NEMA 
rating using Table 3.2.
The IP Code consists of the letters I and P followed by two digits 
or one digit and one letter and an optional letter. As defined in 
IP Code

international standard IEC 60529, IP Code classifies and rates the 
degrees of protection provided against the intrusion of solid objects 
(including body parts like hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, 
and water in mechanical casings and with electrical enclosures.
The standard aims to provide users with more detailed information 
than vague marketing terms such as “waterproof.” However, no 
edition of the standard is openly published for unlicensed readers, 
hence leaving room for varying interpretation.
The digits (IP numerals) indicate conformity with the conditions 
summarized in the tables below. Where there is no protection 
rating with regard to one of the criteria, the digit is replaced with 
the letter X.
For example, an electrical socket rated IP22 is protected against 
insertion of fingers and will not be damaged or become unsafe during 
a specified test in which it is exposed to dripping water. IP22 or 2X 
are typical minimum requirements for the design of electrical 
accessories for indoor use.
Solids, First Digit
The first digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure 
provides against access to hazardous parts (for example, electrical 
conductors, moving parts) and the ingress of solid foreign objects, as 
shown in Table 3.3.

CHAPTER 4
Machine Systems
T
he elementary actuators and techniques described in Chap. 3 
are used in concert with one another to accomplish different 
tasks. For instance, motors, gearboxes, bearings, and belts are 
combined within a frame to form a conveyor, or pneumatic actuators; 
vibratory thrusters and sensors are built into a vibratory part feeder. 
Manufacturers often concentrate their expertise into combining 
these techniques into standard products, whereas custom machine 
builders use these systems to create unique combinations for each 
application.
4.1 Conveyors
Conveyors are used to move objects or substances from one point to 
another. They can take many forms and are usually driven by a motor, 
air, or gravity. Large conveyor systems often have a centralized 
control system controlled by a PLC. Because of the long distances 
associated with conveyor systems, sensors and actuators were 
historically often operated at 120VAC; however, with advances in 
technology using distributed I/O and modern safety regulations, 
24VDC systems are now common. Figure 4.1 shows a conveyor system 
in a cotton-testing facility.
Motors on these large systems are usually of the three-phase 
480VAC variety. This requires I/O and motor power to be run 
separately if 24VDC I/O is used because of the potential of electrical 
interference. Distributed I/O using communication methods such as 
Profibus, Ethernet, or DeviceNet requires additional cabling that is 
also usually attached to the frame of the conveyors. A local disconnect 
is often provided near each motor and may be monitored by the 
control system. Safety devices such as E-Stop push buttons and cable-
pull actuated E-Stops are also generally mounted to the frames.
HMIs often depict the layout of the system, showing the status of 
the system components along with production or packaging machines 
integrated with the system. Conveyor control systems can be very 
elaborate and have hundreds or thousands of I/O points. They also 
often use multiple variations of the types of conveyors described in 
this chapter.

C h a p t e r  F o u r
4.1.1 Belt Conveyors
A belt conveyor consists of two or more pulleys or rollers with a 
continuous loop of material with the conveyor belt rotating around 
them. One or both of the pulleys may be powered, moving the belt 
and the material on the belt forward. Powered pulleys or rollers are 
called drive or driven elements, while the undriven rollers or 
pulleys are called idlers. Idlers may also be located on the underside 
of the conveyor for support of the return strand of belt. Motors for 
belt conveyors are typically located at the head, or pulling end, of 
the conveyor. For reversing conveyors, the motor may be located in 
the middle.
Belts may be made of many different materials ranging from 
rubber or plastic compounds to metal mesh. Many belts are made of 
composites with an under layer for strength and a cover material to 
protect the product. Belt conveyors are usually used in applications 
requiring a solid surface, where materials cannot be easily passed 
across rollers. Belt materials are often chosen based on strength 
requirements or load, the amount of friction required, and the 
environment that they are exposed to. Cleats and sidewalls may be 
attached to the belt surface to help confine materials or reduce the 
need for high-friction surfaces that may damage products. Cleat 
spacing and durability are key factors in the choice of material and 
bonding methods for a cleated belt.
FIGURE 4.1 Conveyor system.

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
167
If belt conveyors are used on an incline or decline, the friction 
coefficient of the belt is typically high. A nose-over section is often 
placed on the top, bottom, or both sections of incline belt conveyors 
to allow for easy transitions of material from other conveyors or into 
hoppers. Figure 4.2 shows a small cleated conveyor on wheels used 
for packaging.
Belt conveyors are one of the least expensive types of conveyor. 
They typically have a metal framework with rollers at each end. 
The belt may be pulled across a flat surface or bed. For heavier 
loads, it may also move across additional rollers. These are known 
as slider bed and roller bed conveyors, respectively. To ensure the 
belt is at the proper tightness and tracks well across the rollers, the 
end roller is often adjustable. Rollers may also be crowned to ensure 
belt centering.
4.1.2 Roller Conveyors
Roller conveyors can take several forms: they may be powered or 
unpowered, belt or chain driven, or even series of individually 
powered rollers.
Rollers are usually a metal shell with a shaft on each end. 
Depending on the weight and material being conveyed, rollers may 
be thin-wall aluminum or heavier-gauge steel, rubber coated or 
individual gravity “skate wheels.” Thin-wall rollers are easily bent, 
dented, or cut and are not suitable for all applications, but they are 
often used for package handling. Axles on these rollers are often 
spring-loaded for easy removal.
FIGURE 4.2 Cleated incline belt conveyor. (Courtesy of Nalle Automation 
Systems.)

168 
C h a p t e r  F o u r
Roller conveyors are usually used for moving packages with flat 
bottoms, like boxes. Rollers should be spaced so that at least three 
rollers are underneath the package at any time. Rollers may be driven 
using various methods. A line shaft may be placed along the length of 
the conveyor with individual urethane belts attached to each roller 
from spools on the shaft. Another method of driving rollers is to place 
either a flat or V belt on the underside of the rollers.
Metal chain can also be used to drive the rollers. A single chain 
can be used to drive all of the rollers or rollers can be linked together 
with roller-to-roller links. A greater number of sprocket teeth in 
contact with the chain allows for heavier loading.
Roller conveyors present special challenges when used on a 
curved section. Rollers must be spaced farther apart at the outside 
edge of the curve. Using a double section of rollers with more rollers 
on the outside section can mitigate this. Some rollers are even made 
that are larger on one end than the other. One note on curved 
conveyors—product should never be accumulated on a curve.
Figure 4.3 illustrates part of a roller conveyor system for cardboard 
containers. This section is known as a “merge.”
An interesting product sometimes used for roller conveyors is the 
individually powered roller. These are essentially cylindrical motors 
with fixed shafts. These are usually DC powered and can be used to 
drive products section by section.
Gravity roller conveyors may be of the roller, or “skate wheel,” 
type. These unpowered conveyors are usually used in short horizontal 
runs where operators push products from one end to the other or 
when products drop from one level to another. Skate wheel conveyors 
are often placed on a wheeled frame so that it can be moved from one 
location to another. Another closely related nonpowered conveying 
FIGURE 4.3 Roller conveyor.

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
169
device is the ball table, which allows products to be moved in any 
direction by pushing them across a table embedded with large ball 
bearings. These are often used when moving totes of parts in machine 
loading and unloading areas.
4.1.3 Chain and Mat Conveyors
Chain conveyors use a continuous chain that runs from one sprocket 
to another at each end of a frame. Pendants or containers may be 
attached to the chain for product containment and transport. The 
most common type of chain conveyor is the tabletop chain conveyor, 
which has flat plates connected to the chain. Cleats are sometimes 
added to these plates for product separation and indexing.
Chain conveyors often use parallel strands of chain mounted to 
dual sprockets or gears on each end of an axle or shaft. This allows for 
devices such as lifts, stops, or transfers to be mounted between the 
chains. Tabletop chains with slats or plates can then be used to move 
pallets or products between these devices.
Tabletop chains may be composed of a thermoplastic material 
or metal. The chain is usually contained in a channel between the 
sprockets that guide it. The plates can also be made in such a way 
that they overlap and can turn, allowing for curved conveyor runs. 
Another term for this type of conveyor is multiflexing since the 
chain is flexible both sideways and on an incline. An example of a 
tabletop chain conveyor is shown in Fig. 4.4. Because the plates 
have space between them, they are also effective for drainage or 
airflow—an important consideration if working with metal machine 
parts.
Tabletop chain conveyors are not placed under tension like a belt 
conveyor since a sprocket is used to drive it. A catenary is typically 
used at the ends on the chain; this is a hanging loop that allows for an 
easy return of the chain on the underside of the conveyor frame. The 
catenary runs from the sprocket over a “shoe” and into containment 
by Teflon guides underneath.
Chain conveyors may also be used for suspending parts or 
pendants. A common application for this type of conveyor is for paint 
booths or ovens. In this case, the chain is almost always metal with 
hooks located at intervals along the chain.
The mat top conveyer is closely related to the single column of 
links used in a chain conveyor. This type of conveyor uses multiple 
columns of links chained together in a mat. Although not as flexible 
as tabletop chains on curves, mat top conveyors can generally support 
more weight.
Chain and mat conveyors are usually driven by AC motors, often 
with variable speed drives for speed control. Chain and mat conveyors 
with cleats may also be driven with a servo for indexing purposes. 
Typically this is done using a sensor at the cleat for stopping the 
indexing motion and verifying position.

FIGURE 4.4 Tabletop chain conveyor.
4.1.4 Vibrating Conveyors
Vibrating conveyors are used for moving bulk materials. Sometimes 
called shakers or shaker tables, they have a solid conveying surface 
with sides to contain the material being conveyed.
Vibrating conveyors operate on the natural frequency principle. 
With only a small energy input, an object can be made to vibrate at 
some frequency by alternately storing and releasing energy using 
supporting springs. The drive mechanism is usually an electric motor 
with a fixed eccentric shaft or rotating weight. A flat pan vibrating 
conveyor will convey most materials at a 5° incline from horizontal.
Food grade applications use vibrating conveyors extensively. 
Because vibrating conveyors are often made of stainless steel and can 
be easily coated with materials such as Teflon, they are suitable for 
wash-down and corrosive environments. They are low maintenance 
and excellent for sanitary applications. They are also used in 
applications for sorting, screening, classifying, and orienting parts.
Accessories for vibrating conveyors include counterbalance 
members for reducing reactions by generating an out-of-phase 

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
171
response to conveyor motion and weighted bases with isolation 
springs to reduce transmitted vibrations.
Air knife separators are an air-driven method of separating 
different weight materials. They are sometimes used with vibrating 
conveyors as a sanitary noncontact method of diverting material.
4.1.5 Pneumatic Conveyors
Pneumatic conveyors use pipes or ducts to transport materials using 
a stream of air. The most commonly transported materials using this 
method are dry pulverized or free-flowing powdery materials.
Carriers can also be transported using air. Items can simply be 
pushed from one location to another using a push or pull pressure 
system.
Following are three basic systems that are used to generate high-
velocity airstreams for conveying:
Suction or vacuum systems use a vacuum created in the 
1. 
pipeline to draw the material with the surrounding air. The 
system is operated at a low pressure, usually 0.4 to 0.5 atm of 
pressure. This method is used mainly in conveying light free-
flowing materials.
Pressure type systems use a 
2. 
positive pressure to push material 
from one point to the next. The system is ideal for conveying 
material from one loading point to a number of unloading 
points. It operates at a pressure of 6 atm and upward.
Combination systems use a suction system to convey material 
3. 
from a number of loading points and a pressure system to 
deliver it to a number of unloading points.
Air pressure may be generated using an industrial blower or fan. 
Alternatively, compressed air is sometimes used for small-volume 
applications.
4.1.6 Accessories
In addition to conveying components, there are various devices that 
are used to guide product in conveying systems.
Diverters are used to move product in a transverse direction to the 
direction of the conveyor. Sometimes called plows when used for 
bulk materials, diverters usually have a pivot point at one end. 
Diverters may be used to move product off the side of a conveyor 
onto spurs or guide product into lanes for sorting.
When guiding objects, it is important to consider the angle at 
which the diverter will operate. To ensure a smooth transition for 
items such as packages, it is best to operate the diverter at 30° to the 
conveyor flow. Under no circumstance can they be at greater than 
45°. Bulk materials can generally operate at greater angles.

172 
C h a p t e r  F o u r
Diverters can be used with belt, roller, and chain conveyors. 
Pneumatic system diverters are also common. Diverters usually use 
air cylinders for actuation, but servo-operated diverters are also 
common where multiple positions are required.
Pushers are used to move objects at right angles to the conveyor. 
They are usually pneumatically operated and are often used in roller 
conveyors; however, they are not appropriate for belt conveyors.
Gates and lifts can be used to allow passage of personnel and 
vehicles. These are essentially self-contained conveyors on hinges.
Elevators are also commonly used to move product from one 
conveyor level to another. These may be pneumatically or motor 
operated and usually include a short length of conveyor within the 
lifting platform. With safety devices and traffic control sensors, these 
are often self-contained machines.
4.2 Indexers and Synchronous Machines
Indexers move objects a fixed distance for repetitive positioning and 
to avoid cumulative errors. They are often used to move objects 
being worked between fixed location stations. Walking beams and 
pick-and-place mechanisms also move objects from one location to 
another.
4.2.1 Rotary Cam Indexers
Rotary indexers are used to move actuators to fixed points in a circular 
path. They are built to move to discrete points and are typically 
available in 2- to 12-point configurations. Because they are cam 
driven, they can be moved at a high rate of speed and handle heavy 
loads. They can be driven by constant speed motors and can drive 
auxiliary actuators to perform other repetitive tasks as part of their 
operation. A common name for a rotary indexer with a machined 
platform for stations on top is a dial table. An example of a four-station 
dial table is shown in Fig. 4.5. Well-known manufacturers of these 
indexing devices include Camco and Stelron.
Sensors are used to detect when the indexer is within the “dwell” 
part of the index so station devices can operate on the product. A 
common device that is often used on dial tables is an overload clutch. 
If the motor tries to index the dial, but something is in the way, the 
dial will “break away” from the drive unit. A sensor is used to detect 
this condition, and the dial must be put back into position manually.
4.2.2 Synchronous Chassis Pallet Indexers
Synchronous chassis make use of a motor and line shaft to index 
pallets and synchronize devices performing operations around the 
chassis. Cams on the line shaft are used to operate devices in time 
with the movement of pallets, as well as control pallet movement 

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
173
and dwell times. Synchronous chassis are more robust than systems 
using sensors and independent control of stations but less flexible 
and more difficult to reconfigure. Indexing drives and cam motions 
are specific to the machine application. Machine timing is 
mechanically fixed, so there is no risk of losing timing or position on 
individual workstations.
A clutch may be used to disconnect the drive mechanism from the 
chassis. This must be done while the cam is in the dwell, or nondriving 
part, of the cam motion. Otherwise, a chassis must be slowed at a 
gradual rate to reduce stress on the cam-driven mechanisms.
4.2.3 Walking Beams
A walking beam uses an X-axis and Z-axis configuration to repetitively 
index parts a fixed distance in a single direction. The X-axis moves 
forward with the Z-axis raised, carrying or pushing the part in the 
desired direction. The Z-axis is then lowered and the X-axis returned 
to its origin to begin another index. Walking beams are common in 
packaging and assembly operations because of their relatively low 
cost and repetitive accuracy. Axes may be pneumatically or servo 
actuated. Figure 4.6 illustrates the principle of a two-axis walking 
beam.
A variation of a walking beam for boxes, totes or flat products 
that does not require a Z-axis is a spring-finger walking beam. This is 
a horizontal axis with sloped fingers that are held in the raised 
position with springs. As the beam is moved backward underneath 
the product, the product pushes down the fingers; when the beam 
FIGURE 4.5 Dial table.

174 
C h a p t e r  F o u r
moves in the forward direction, the fingers pop back up and propel 
the product forward.
4.2.4 Pick-and-Place
A pick-and-place is so named because it typically picks up an object 
and places it in another location. It consists of an X-axis, or horizontal 
axis; a Z-axis, or vertical axis; and a picking mechanism such as a 
mechanical gripper, vacuum cups, or even a magnet. If another

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
175
horizontal axis, or Y-axis, is added, it is described as a gantry, which 
is further described in the robotic section 4.4 of this book.
Pick-and-place mechanisms may be pneumatically or servo 
driven, depending on speed requirements and the number of locations 
that must be accessed. It is common to see mechanisms that are a 
combination of both. Servo axes provide flexibility since their 
positions and speeds can be reprogrammed for different products. 
Figure 4.7 is a three-axis robot from Adept Robotics. A gripper can be 
attached to the lower end of the vertical axis, or Z-axis, creating a 
pick-and-place.
Other variations of the pick-and-place can be fabricated using 
linkages, cams, and other basic mechanisms. An example is a literature 
or sheet feeder that strips sheets of paper from a hopper or rack using 
vacuum cups and places them onto a flat surface.
4.3 Part Feeders
Part feeders supply components to a variety of manufacturing 
processes. They often serve as a buffer and part orientation device.
4.3.1 Vibratory Bowls and Feeders
Vibratory bowls and feeders use a variable amplitude controller to 
control a drive unit with spring thrusters oriented in the direction of 
part movement. Similar to the method of driving vibratory conveyors, 
leaf springs are mounted on a base unit oriented in the direction of 
the desired travel of the part. A bowl with special tooling and tracks 
sized to the component is then mounted to the other end of the 
springs to guide the parts. The tooling is also used to orient 
components within the bowl, guiding improperly oriented parts back 
into the bowl and allowing parts with the correct orientation to 
proceed. Figure 4.8 shows a vibratory bowl used to feed plastic caps.
Linear tracks also use vibratory drive units to move components 
in a straight line. Sensors and stops or gates may then be used to 
control the flow of parts along the tracks.
Drive units are available in electromagnetic and pneumatic 
drives. Parts are forced up a circular inclined track inside the bowl. 
The track length, width, and depth are carefully chosen to suit the 
application and component shape and size. Special track coatings are 
applied according to shape, size, and material of the component, 
which aids traction, minimizes damage to the product, and lowers 
acoustic levels.
Different materials travel better with different vibration 
frequencies. The amplitude and frequency of the electronic drive unit 
is generally set based on the optimum movement rate for the part 
being moved. Weights can also be added or removed from motors to 
adjust coarse feed rates. Spring constant values and lengths are other 
important considerations that affect part movement.

176 
C h a p t e r  F o u r
Vibratory feeders are used by most industries, including 
pharmaceutical, automotive, electronic, food, packaging, and 
metalworking. They are most commonly used in the assembly process 
as they align components for access by other mechanisms.
Vibratory hoppers and trays are also used to move bulk materials 
and are not always associated with orienting or singulating parts. 
These are more commonly used in the material handling and process 
industries for flow control.
4.3.2 Step and Rotary Feeders
Step feeders remove component parts from a hopper by either elevating 
parts with a single moving stepper plate onto stationary ledges, as 
illustrated in Fig. 4.9, or by counterrotating two stepper plates. Plates 
are moved on linear guides pushing product up out of the bin or 
hopper. Components are elevated until they reach the desired transfer 
height, generally feeding into a linear track or conveyor. Step feeders 
are often used on parts that are cylindrical and are not appropriate for 
vibrating feeders because of potential product abrasion.
Key features of a step feeder are that it operates quietly and 
without vibration. Width and thickness of the stepper plates are 
important variables to consider in feeder design. When considering 
using a step feeder over a vibratory system, it is important to 
remember that the part will be elevated considerably above the level 
of the hopper.
Centrifugal feeders, also referred as rotary feeders, have a conical 
central-driven rotor surrounded by a circular bowl wall. The feeder 
FIGURE 4.8 Vibratory bowl.

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
177
separates component parts using rotary force; then parts revolve with 
high speed and are pulled to the outside of the bowl. As parts 
accumulate at the outside edge of the bowl, they tend to line up 
allowing for orientation and singulation of the parts.
Centrifugal feeders can be operated at higher feed rates than 
vibratory bowls. They are also better at handling oil-covered parts 
but do not work as well if parts tangle easily. Specialized tooling for 
parts orientation is used in much the same way as a vibratory bowl, 
with machined protrusions on the outside track of the feeder.
4.3.3 Escapements and Parts Handling
An escapement is a pair of actuators that allows for singulation of 
parts. If components are separated by a space, gates or pop-up stops 
can be used between parts as they move through the system. As a 
part is detected at the forward stop, another stop is raised behind the 
part. After the forward stop allows the part to exit and is raised again, 
the rear stop is lowered, allowing the part to move forward, after 
which the cycle is repeated.
Escapements may take the form of stops operating from above, 
below, or the sides. They may also use pressure against the side of the 
part itself; this is useful if parts do not have space between them.
Escapements are used in conveying systems, feeders, pallet 
indexing systems, and assembly. They are one of the basic elements of 
parts handling.
In general, parts handling involves controlling the movement of 
components within a system. A good rule of thumb is once you have 
control of randomized parts through orientation and singulation, you 
should never relinquish it. This means that if parts have been 
individualized, do not let them recombine. If they have been oriented, 
do not allow them to return to a mixed state.

Most part-handling techniques have been discussed in other 
sections of this chapter. Pushers and diverters, pick-and-places, and 
other actuator-based mechanisms are all examples of parts handling. 
Additional methods include using parallel urethane cord conveyors 
at an angle on the sides of parts to lift them out of moving conveyor 
pockets, using rubber wheels to accelerate low-friction parts for 
singulation, and using air to blow rejected or disoriented parts off a 
conveyor or out of a track. Actuators, air, and sensors can be used in 
many creative ways to create the desired part movement.
4.4 Robots and Robotics
A robot is an electromechanical machine that can perform tasks on its 
own or with guidance. Industrial robots are used widely throughout 
the manufacturing sector, and the various categories of these robots 
come in different configurations and sizes. Robots are most often 
driven by coordinated servo gear motors moving directly on axes; 
however, hydraulic robots are also used in some applications.
An industrial robot is defined by ISO 8373 as an “automatically 
controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable 
in three or more axes.” In industry, the term robotics can be defined as 
the design and use of robot systems for manufacturing.
The most commonly used robot configurations are articulated 
robots, SCARA robots, and Cartesian coordinate robots (also known 
as gantry robots or x-y-z robots). Speed requirements, the positions 
that must be attained, and the cost of the system are factors that 
determine which type of configuration is generally used for a 
particular function.
4.4.1 Articulated Robots
An articulated robot is one that uses rotary joints to access its work 
space. Usually the joints are arranged in a “chain,” so that one joint 
supports another farther in the chain. Another term for an articulated 
robot is a “robotic arm.”
Articulated robots usually have anywhere from three to six joints. 
More than six joints are possible, but these robots generally fall into 
the custom category. Another term for this is “degrees of freedom,” 
defined as the number of independent motions that make up the 
robot’s area of operation. Joints are usually defined as J1-Jx, where x 
is the number of joints in the robot. J1 is the joint nearest the base of 
the robot, and other joints increment from there. Typically, J1 rotates 
horizontally around the robot base. Because of the cables that need to 
make their way through the various joints for servo power and 
position, joint rotation for J1 is usually less than 360°. Figure 4.10 
shows a six-axis Denso robotic arm mounted on a base.
J2 and J3 usually operate in the vertical plane. Along with the 
rotation of J1, this allows the other joints to be placed close to nearly 

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
179
every point within the robot’s operating envelope. J4, J5, and J6 
typically act as manipulators, with the last joint, J6, usually being a 
rotary to which grippers or other devices are attached.
4.4.2 SCARA Robots
The SCARA acronym stands for Selective Compliant Assembly Robot 
Arm or Selective Compliant Articulated Robot Arm. These are usually 
of the four-axis variety, with J1 and J2 being horizontal rotary joints to 
access X-Y points, J3 being a Z-axis, and J4 being a rotary or T-axis 
mounted at the end of J3.
Because of the parallel axes of J1 and J2, the end of the vertical 
axis J3 is rigidly controlled in the X-Y position, hence the term 
“selective compliant.” SCARA robots are widely used for assembly 
operations that require this rigidity in the X-Y plane, such as placing 
a round pin into a vertical hole without binding. An example of a 
SCARA-type Adept robot is shown in Fig. 4.11.
SCARA robots are less expensive than similar-size, fully articulated 
robots by virtue of the lower number of joints they possess. They are 
also faster and more compact than Cartesian gantry systems because 
the pedestal mount has a smaller footprint than the multiple-point 
mounting of a gantry.

4.4.3 Cartesian Robots
A Cartesian robot, also called a linear or gantry robot, has three linear 
axes of control in the X, Y, and Z directions. Rather than having rotary 
joints, the X-axis is usually mounted at both ends with the Y-axis 
mounted to it. Some gantries suspend the Y-axis between two X-axes 
using a four post arrangement. This creates a box-shaped working 
envelope. The Z-axis is mounted to the Y-axis and may have an 
additional rotary axis mounted to the end. A gripper or other end 
effector is then attached to this for part handling. The Adept “Python” 
three-axis robot shown in Fig. 4.7 is an example of a Cartesian robot.
Gantry arrangements are the simplest control scheme for robots 
since coordinates are in the familiar X-Y-Z or Cartesian system and do 
not have to be converted or interpolated as with other systems. This 
allows for separate controllers or servo drives to be used for 
movements if coordinated moves are not required.
A popular application for Cartesian robots is the Computer 
Numerical Control (CNC) machine. These machines are used widely 
in industry for the automated machining of metal parts.
4.4.4 Parallel Robots
A parallel robot makes use of four or more linkages or kinematic chains 
from a central actuation point to an end effector. They are considered 

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
181
closed-loop systems since each of the links are constrained by the 
others. When compared with serial manipulators, such as robotic arms 
and SCARAs, the structural members are very light and therefore 
provide a much greater linear speed. The disadvantage of a parallel 
robot is that its work space is limited when compared to the space it 
occupies. Figure 4.12 shows an Adept “Quattro” parallel robot.
Parallel robots are usually suspended above the objects being 
manipulated. A common use for parallel robots is the insertion of 
components into printed circuit boards.
4.4.5 Robot Basics and Terminology
Robotic systems are made up of several components. The robot itself, 
with its motors, joints, and structures, makes up the moving part of 
the system. Motor and feedback cables are usually routed through 
the structural members of the robot for protection. Motors used in 
smaller robots are usually high-speed, low torque DC motors with 
high gear ratios. Larger robots use various different types of 
servomotors, depending on speed and payload requirements, but all 
use gearing or gearboxes of some kind.
FIGURE 4.12 Parallel robot. (Courtesy of Adept.)

C h a p t e r  F o u r
For stability, the robot is mounted to a base, which is usually 
bolted to a solid foundation or steel frame. The base also usually has 
cable connections from the controller.
The robot controller contains drives for each of the axes along 
with the “brains” for running robot programs and coordinating axis 
movements. Communication ports for interfacing with programming 
computers and other controllers are also present. Safety interface 
connections for E-Stop and guard circuits are generally mounted here 
as terminal connections. Cables to the robot base connect to the 
controller as well as a port for the robot’s programming pendant. This 
is also where the power connection for the robot is made.
The robot pendant is used to write or edit robot programs as well 
as to manually move the robot and “teach” positions. Pendants 
resemble an HMI with a touch screen and usually a membrane 
keypad. They also have an E-Stop button for integration into a 
machine safety circuit. A “dead-man” switch is built into the pendant, 
which must be held down during any manual robot movements.
The end effector is tooling placed on the working end of the robot. 
It is typically used to manipulate parts, but it may also be used to 
carry a welding tip or sprayer head. End effectors may carry 
pneumatic or hydraulic grippers, magnets, suction cups, or various 
other types of tooling. Some end effectors can be quite elaborate, 
having several actuators and sensors. Cameras and measurement 
devices are also often mounted on the end effector.
Terminology for robots and robotics can vary widely, depending 
on the manufacturer. Following are some of the more general terms 
that apply to a variety of platforms. Other terms for specific platforms 
can be found in manufacturers’ documentation.
Specifications for a robot involve an analysis of the product and 
movements required. The payload, or carrying capacity, is the amount 
of weight that the robot must lift, including the weight of end effector 
tooling. This can be affected by the speed, acceleration, and force that 
are required. Kinematics is the arrangement of the rigid members and 
joints as described previously. Choosing between articulated, SCARA, 
Cartesian, or other configurations involves determining the envelope 
of the points that need to be accessed and at what angle. Two axes are 
required to access any point in a plane, while three are required to 
reach any point in a X-Y-Z space. In order to completely control 
orientation, an additional three rotational axes are required—pitch, 
yaw, and roll. Additional axes are sometimes added to reach around 
obstructions or into cavities.
Accuracy and repeatability are measurements of the precision at 
which the robot operates. Accuracy is a measurement of how closely 
a robot will move to a programmed or commanded position, while 
repeatability is a measure of how well the robot will return to the 
same position each time. Compliance is a measure of how much a 
robot will move when a force is exerted against it. When a load is 

M a c h i n e  S y s t e m s  
183
being carried, positions will be slightly different than when there is 
no load at all. Joint positions may be detected accurately, but even 
solid members or joints will bend slightly under load. Acceleration 
can affect compliance even further and must be considered because 
of potential overshoot in position.
A frame or tool frame is a coordinate reference that is used to allow 
an entire set of points to be translated to a new location. As an 
example, if you have taught a large group of points around a station 
that the robot will access, then either the robot or the station needs to 
be moved. By using a frame recorded at X-Y-Z on the station, all that 
needs to be done is to teach the new frame, rather than reteaching all 
of the points.
A singularity is a condition at which robots can reach a point 
through more than one joint configuration, making the axes 
redundant. The American National Standard for Industrial Robots 
and Robot Systems—Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) 
defines a singularity as “a condition caused by the collinear alignment 
of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion 
and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-
roll wrist.” This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist—
controlling yaw, pitch, and roll—all pass through a common point.
The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers make 
users aware of singularities if they can occur while robots are being 
manually manipulated. Some industrial robot manufacturers have 
attempted to sidestep the situation by slightly altering the robot’s 
path to prevent singularity conditions.
Often, SCARA robot arm positions are defined as being right- or 
left-handed to avoid singularities arising when the robot could 
access a point from either configuration. Articulated robots may 
have even more joint combinations that can theoretically reach a 
particular point through various arm configurations. Some 
singularity problems can be avoided by switching from Cartesian 
moves to individual joint movements within a program. Another 
method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed 
required for the wrist to make the transition, avoiding the condition 
sometimes referred to as “wrist flip.”
An area definition or vector can be used to define an area for 
safety or movement control. By defining a point along X, Y, and Z 
dimensions, a three-dimensional space can be used to control 
operations within an area. This is often used to set or reset an output 
when the robot enters or leaves a space. Terminology for this varies 
widely for different platforms.
An approach or depart move generally describes moving to or 
from a point at a certain angle. Rather than having to define a specific 
position for a move, the approach or depart move can make use of a 
defined position by telling the robot to move toward or away from a 
point using the current orientation of the end effector tooling.

184 
C h a p t e r  F o u r
4.4.6 Robot Coordinate Systems
Robot movements and positions can be defined in a number of 
different coordinate systems. “World” coordinate systems apply to 
any coordinate system using the robot’s base as the origin. “Tool” 
coordinates use the end of the robot’s arm where the tooling is 
mounted as the origin. “Workpiece” coordinates use a point on the 
work area tooling rather than a point on the robot itself as the origin.
The most familiar X-Y-Z, or Cartesian, coordinates are usually 
easiest for a human to visualize and so are often used for position 
definitions. Additional coordinates are sometimes added to the X 
(primary horizontal), Y (secondary horizontal), and Z (vertical). These 
are sometimes referred to as A (rotation around X), B (rotation around 
Y), and C (rotation around Z). SCARA and gantry-type robots require 
little interpolation or conversion to use this system. This coordinate 
system is sometimes referred to as a “space” coordinate system.
Joint coordinates describe the angular position of each of the robot’s 
joints. Controllers use joint coordinates and perform mathematical 
calculations or interpolations to arrive at Cartesian points. These may 
be addressed in a program in variables such as J1-Jx or A1-Ax, 
depending on the software platform.
When operating a robot from a pendant, it may be advantageous 
to switch between different coordinate systems and work spaces, 
depending on the ease of visualization.
Further information on robot programming and software is 
addressed in Chap. 6.

CHAPTER 5 
Process Systems 
and Automated 
Machinery
P
rocess control is a method of manufacturing that uses formulas 
and recipes rather than assembling components to produce 
products. The primary way to determine if an application falls 
under the category of process manufacturing is whether the end 
product can be returned to its basic components. For example, an 
automobile can be disassembled and its components returned to stock, 
whereas a bottle of shampoo cannot be returned to its basic ingredients.
Process manufacturing is used in the chemical, food and beverage, 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and packaging industries. In the 
process industry, ingredients, formulas, and bulk are the elements of 
the end product rather than parts, assemblies, and components. Raw 
materials are also processed into intermediate forms that can be used 
in the manufacture of components. The materials that automated 
machines process all have their own special properties and techniques 
that are associated with their manufacture. There are many similarities 
in the processing of metals and plastics. For instance, both involve the 
mixing of different elements in a molten state and the machining or 
forming of shapes.
Automated machinery is created by combining the components 
and machine subsystems described previously in this book. 
Automated production lines use a combination of custom machines 
and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) equipment to assemble 
or produce an end product.
Some machines are fairly standardized, such as hydraulic presses, 
web-handling equipment, and injection molding machines. These 
machines are often made in several sizes and configurations, and 
only the tooling needs to be customized. They are often manufactured 
by OEMs who specialize in a specific kind of machinery. Other 
machinery is often customized to fit a specific application, such as 
assembly and gauging machinery. Custom machine builders often 
185

186 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
use a combination of OEM products and custom machines, moving 
components and products through a production or assembly line to 
produce the end result. The combining of the various machines and 
control systems into a single entity is a process known as integration.
5.1 Chemical Processing
Chemical processing involves combining or mixing ingredients and 
often changing their temperature or pressure. Some chemicals or 
compounds are produced in bulk form for use in further processing, 
including commodity chemicals in solid or liquid form, polymers or 
plastics, and petrochemicals. These products are generally packaged 
or contained in bulk for shipment to other facilities or processors.
Bulk chemicals may undergo further processing to produce 
specialty or fine chemicals, such as adhesives, sealants and coatings, 
industrial gases, electronic chemicals, catalysts, and cleaning 
compounds. They are also used in consumer products, such as soaps, 
detergents, lotions, and cosmetics. The life science industry also uses 
bulk chemicals and compounds in the production of pharmaceutical 
drugs and medicines, vitamins, and diagnostic products. Because of 
the higher research and development costs and government 
specifications and regulations, these products are usually produced 
in a controlled laboratory environment and are more costly.
Key process variables in the production of chemicals and 
compounds are residence time (lowercase Greek letter tau), volume 
(V), temperature (T), pressure (P), concentrations of chemicals (C1, 
C2, C3. . . ., Cn), and heat transfer (h or U). Chemical processing is 
concentrated around the control and monitoring of these variables.
Chemical production and processing can be very hazardous because 
of the reactionary nature of chemicals. Pressures, temperatures, acidity, 
and quantities must all be monitored and controlled very precisely. This 
requires instrumentation and visualization using a wide range of 
products. HMIs are used in the field and in control rooms to display 
process diagrams and provide control and detailed alarms. P&ID 
diagrams are used to design and troubleshoot chemical processing 
systems and may also be accessed through computers or HMIs.
Valves for controlling the flow of liquids and gases in a process 
are often analog; they not only completely open or close, but also 
move to intermediate positions. These are known as proportional 
valves. They also usually have a feedback sensor to verify position, 
although sometimes a downstream flow sensor or pressure feedback 
is used. Process variables are monitored using standardized limits 
such as H and L, indicating values within which operation is 
considered normal, and HH and LL, indicating limits that require 
alarms and may initiate shutdown.
Because of the caustic and explosive nature of many chemicals, 
safety is an overriding concern in the chemical industry. Controls are 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
187
often redundant and mechanical elements are designed with high 
safety margins. IS and explosion-proof products are used extensively 
within chemical process facilities. Both PLCs and DCSs are used for 
control along with stand-alone temperature and PID controllers. The 
physical layout of chemical processing facility generally includes 
elaborate piping with multiple holding and containment vessels.
Vessels designed to contain chemicals as they undergo mixing or 
property changes are known as reactors. These are designed to 
maximize their value for the given reaction, providing the highest 
yield while minimizing cost of materials or energy. Basic vessel types 
include tanks in various shapes or pipes (tubular reactors). They may 
operate in a steady state, where materials flow into and out of the 
system continuously, or a transient state, where a process variable 
such as heat or pressure is changed over time.
Three main basic models for estimation of process variables are used 
in chemical processing; the batch reactor model (batch processing), the 
continuous stirred tank reactor model (CSTR), and the plug flow reactor 
model (PFR). Catalysts may require different models or techniques than 
these three basic models, such as a catalytic reactor model.
5.2 Food and Beverage Processing
Food processing uses meat, grain, or vegetable components to 
produce packaged food products for commercial use. Like chemical 
processing, food processing involves the control of temperature and 
often the mixing of ingredients. Administration of the food-processing 
industry regulations in the United States is monitored by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA). Of primary concern is sanitation and the 
elimination of contamination.
Special techniques specific to the food industry include clean-
in-place, flash freezing, spray drying, and various filtration 
methods. Water treatment is also an important part of the process 
because of the necessity of cleaning equipment with caustic 
substances and federal regulations involving wastewater discharge. 
Product or material handling and packaging are also integral to the 
food-processing industry.
Food-processing machinery may be made by OEMs who specialize 
in specific aspects of production or by custom machine builders who 
are knowledgeable of the special requirements of food processing. 
Food-processing machines may be used for the preparation of 
ingredients (chopping or cutting, crushing, peeling, or molding into 
shapes); the application or removal of heat (cooking, baking, or freezing); 
mixing of ingredients or seasoning; or product filling. Most food service 
equipment is built using stainless steel and techniques allowing for 
pressurized wash-down of equipment. Great care is taken to ensure 
equipment does not have crevices where contaminants can lodge.

188 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
Controls in the food- and beverage-processing industries are 
similar to that of chemical processing, although mostly PLC controlled. 
Instrumentation is used to measure temperatures and flow rates, 
sometimes using individual controllers with data read back into a 
SCADA or monitoring system.
Food is produced by several different methods. One-off or 
individualized production does not lend itself to automated methods. 
An example of this would be wedding cakes or cake decoration. Batch 
production is commonly used in bakeries, where a certain number of 
products of the same size and ingredients are made on a periodic 
basis. Equipment is set up with an end number in mind, and 
ingredients are ordered based on an estimate of the demand. Many 
OEM food production machines are constructed with recipe, batching, 
and counting features built into the software. Weighing and liquid 
measurement are also an important part of the batching process. Mass 
production is a continuous method of producing products, such as 
canned or packaged foods, and individual items, such as candy. 
Product passes from one stage to another along a production line in 
this method.
Beverage processing involves the formulation of the product as 
well as the bottling or packaging. Basic ingredients may be mixed in a 
batch form to control proportions accurately or in a continuous manner. 
Some beverages, such as beer or whiskey, require long periods where 
ingredients age or ferment in a tank at a specific temperature. Others 
can be continuously processed directly into a bottling or packaging 
area. Bottling is a high-speed process with many OEMs involved in 
making standard or semicustomized machinery. Packaging equipment, 
from sterilized product containers to bulk shipping, is also a major part 
of both the food- and beverage-processing industries.
Like the chemical-processing industry, food and beverage 
processing involves a great deal of process visualization. HMIs and 
integrated control systems allow the viewing of the entire process 
from raw ingredients through packaging. Many control component 
vendors have packaged templates specific to the food and beverage 
industry with three-dimensional images, recipe management, and 
historical data collection. There are also quite a few integrators and 
custom machine builders who specialize in food- and beverage-
processing equipment.
5.3 Packaging
The packaging industry encompasses the containment, labeling, 
orientation, and material handling of products for distribution, 
storage, and sale. Products are packaged in different ways, depending 
on the stage of production and type of product. Many products are 
produced in bulk form but must be packaged as individual units for 
shipment or sale.

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
189
Packaging can be described in three broad categories. Primary 
packaging is the first layer of material that surrounds or holds the 
product. This layer is often consumer packaging that is labeled for 
marketing and comes in direct contact with the product. Secondary 
packaging is often used to group primary packaging together, usually 
also labeled for consumer use. Tertiary packaging is used for bulk 
handling, storage, and shipment.
Packaging materials are generally made of some form of plastic or 
cardboard, although in the food and pharmaceutical industries, glass 
and metals are also widely used. Packaging machinery generally takes 
these materials in a rolled or collapsed form and uses it to envelop the 
product.
Common methods of primary packaging include shrink-wrapping, 
cartoning, blister packing, and vacuum packing. These methods also 
lend themselves to easy labeling for consumers by application of 
adhesive labels, direct printing, or printed cartons and bags. Secondary 
methods also include cartoning, bagging, and shrink-wrapping. 
Tertiary packaging uses corrugated cardboard, palletizing, bag-in-box, 
and other techniques. Packaging for transport is typically less concerned 
with marketing and the appearance of a packed unit than with 
protection and ease of handling.
Packaging machinery can be purchased as off-the-shelf equipment 
from many OEMs. Labelers, check-weigh systems, baggers, case 
erectors, sleeve-wrappers, and shrink-wrappers are made in standard 
sizes by many manufacturers and can be ordered with short lead 
times. They are usually adjustable for various standardized sizes of 
packaging and labeling materials. Machinery can also be customized 
by many manufacturers from a standard design. Some packaging 
machinery must be custom-built because of special requirements 
related to material handling, package size, or speed requirements. 
End users often customize or manufacture their own packaging 
machinery in-house.
Considerations when choosing packaging machinery includes 
type of packaging and its final appearance, floor space requirements, 
throughput, reliability and maintainability, labor requirements to 
operate machinery, and flexibility of the equipment related to product 
sizes and changeover. Packaging machinery is often built into a line 
involving material handling and an integrated control system. 
Accumulating, orienting, and collating are commonly part of the 
material-handling process as well as inspecting and weighing of 
product. Machine vision and metal detecting are common in the 
packaging industry. Figure 5.1 shows a typical packaging line layout.
Liquid packaging includes filling, capping, closing, seaming, and 
sealing. Because the packaging of liquids may involve foods or 
beverages, cleaning and sterilizing may also be part of this process. 
Cooling and drying are also common in the material handling and 
packaging of products.

190 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
The use of plastic wrap involves shrinking film using ovens and 
heated air and the sealing of packages using bar sealing equipment. 
Temperature and time are important variables in this process and are 
often controlled by discrete devices, such as temperature controllers, 
timers, and variable speed conveyors. Packaging machinery uses a 
wide range of technologies ranging from simple control and 
mechanical components to high-speed servo and robotic systems.
Palletizers are used to arrange boxes and cartons in layers on 
plastic or wooden pallets. They are often robotic and can be 
programmed for different patterns. Pallets are then usually stretch-
wrapped using a rotary wrapper or by hand and transported by 
forklift to the shipping area.
Labeling may be applied to packages by means of adhesive labels 
from a dispenser or directly printed onto cartons, bags, or boxes. 
Labelers are often controlled by means of a part detection sensor 
acting as a trigger and may also use an encoder or other speed 
detection device to control spacing. Bar coding is also an important 
part of the labeling industry. Bar codes may be preapplied to labels or 
printed directly on the product.
5.4 Web Handling and Converting
A web is a continuous piece of material. Paper, fabric, and some 
extruded materials are examples of a web. Webs are usually moved 
through processes using rollers, which may also serve to apply

tension, heating, or cooling to the material. Webs may be processed 
directly from the manufacturing of the material or from rolls or coils. 
Common materials processed in web form include Nonwovens, 
films, textiles, foams, and paper.
Because webs are moved continuously, they can be processed at 
higher speeds than individual sheets of material. Common uses of 
web processing include bonding layers of material together; cutting 
material into sheets or slitting it into smaller rolls; cutting or punching 
pieces out of it; or passing the material through other heating, cooling, 
or chemical processes.
Web-handling machinery is usually composed of individual 
drives arranged in a linear fashion with sections performing different 
operations on the web sequentially. Web guiding and tensioning are 
important facets of controlling webs, and a variety of products are 
manufactured to help in these areas. Web guides and steering 
mechanisms sense the position of the edges of the web and adjust 
rollers in real time to correct for misalignment. These are often placed 
immediately before critical sections of a line, such as printing. Tension 
may be monitored by load cells and strain gauges, or torque feedback 
may be sensed by roller drives. Gaps between rollers must often be 
controlled and adjusted carefully for tensioning or product thickness. 
Pull units are drive and roller sections that have methods for these 
adjustments built in. They may consist of full-width or “nip” rollers 
at the web edges. Figure 5.2 shows a web being processed.
Accumulators are used to isolate sections of web from the tension 
effects of other sections. They also store material while rolls are being 
changed. Accumulators are sometimes built with multiple festoons 
or may take the form of a simple take-up mechanism. Unwinders and 
FIGURE 5.2 Web line.

192 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
winders pay out rolls of material and wind them up at the ends of the 
process. Splicers are placed between the unwinding station and an 
accumulator to allow web to feed out continuously. These stations 
may be fully automated or operator assisted.
Slitters are used to cut webs lengthwise on a continuous basis. 
They may have stationary blades or rolling knives and are usually 
adjustable for different widths.
Some operations, such as heating, cooling, and slitting, are 
continuous processes, while other operations, such as ultrasonic 
welding, punching, or cutting across the web, may be done by starting 
and stopping or slowing the web between accumulators.
Converting is the process of turning raw materials, often in rolled 
or sheet form, into new products. Common materials used in the 
converting process are woven and nonwovens, paper, adhesives, 
rubber, foam, and plastics.
Continuous rolls of material are threaded into processing 
machinery, which then performs intermediate or final operations to 
produce product. An example of converting is taking a web of two 
layers of plastic, fusing the edges together and sealing the ends, and 
cutting it to produce plastic bags. Common operations in the 
converting process include coating, application of adhesives, 
ultrasonic welding, or other types of material bonding, sealing, and 
patterning. Converting methods are also often used in the assembly 
process.
5.5 Metal, Plastic, Ceramic, and Glass Processing
Processing of metals, plastics, ceramics, and glass are similar in 
several ways. They all involve the combination of raw materials and 
often the application of heating, cooling, chemicals and pressures. 
They are processed in their solid and liquid, or molten states. They 
often pass through several intermediate forms and shapes before 
being made into a final product.
5.5.1 Metals
Raw metals are extracted from the earth in the form of ores that must 
be processed to extract the pure metals. The initial processing may use 
chemical or electrolytic reduction, pyrometallurgy (high temperature), 
or hydrometallurgy (aqueous or water-based chemistry). When an ore 
is an ionic compound of a metal with impurities, it must be smelted to 
extract the pure metal. Ores such as iron, aluminum, and copper are 
typically mixed with other compounds or chemical elements, which 
must be separated out by breaking the bonds either electrically or 
chemically. Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted by 
combining the ore with carbon as a reducing agent at high heat.
To separate aluminum from the ore bauxite—a common practice 
in extractive metallurgy—carbon and electricity must be introduced.

193
The aluminum is extracted using an electrochemical process in a 
carbon-lined vat or “cell” using molten cryolite or synthetic sodium 
aluminum fluoride. Aluminum smelters consume a great deal of 
electricity because of the very high melting point of the metal.
Copper ore contains a very low percentage of copper metal 
and goes through several stages to purify the metal. The ore is first 
ground and separated from other minerals. It then undergoes 
hydrometallurgical or froth flotation procedures to further refine the 
metal before being smelted. The smelter produces about a 70 percent 
copper sulfide, which is then further refined and purified using 
electrolysis.
Purified metals or alloys are usually made into a solid form, such 
as ingots, sheets, or coils, and shipped to other facilities for further 
processing.
Alloys
An alloy is a mixture of materials in which the major component is a 
metal. Alloys of iron are the most common, including tool steel, cast 
iron, and stainless steel. Alloying iron with different amounts of 
carbon produces low-, mid-, and high-carbon steels. More carbon 
reduces the ductility but increases the hardness and strength of 
steel.
Cast iron is an alloy containing iron, carbon, and silicon. It is 
melted and poured into molds to form different shapes, which are 
then often processed further. Common uses for cast iron include 
motor housings, pipes, and machine parts. Cast iron can be brittle, so 
other elements are often alloyed with it to increase its malleability, 
hardness, or tensile strength. Cast iron has a relatively low melting 
point and is easy to machine.
Stainless steel is made by alloying carbon steel with chromium. 
Other elements, such as nickel and molybdenum, are sometimes 
added to make it less brittle or increase hardness. Stainless steel is 
used primarily for its resistance to corrosion. It is used in food 
processing and medical devices as it can be easily sterilized and does 
not need painting or other surface coatings. Stainless steel is commonly 
formed into coils, sheets, plates, bars, wire, or tubing before being 
further processed.
Copper, aluminum, titanium, and magnesium are other common 
alloys produced for commercial use. Copper and its alloys are often 
used for electrical wiring, while alloys of aluminum, titanium, and 
magnesium are valued for their high strength to weight ratios. Alloys 
designed for special or very demanding applications may contain 
more than 10 elements.
Smelters are major users of automation. Because of the high 
temperatures and toxic fumes, it is difficult for operators to work in 
close proximity to the molten materials. Material handling, power 
distribution, and process control are important elements of metal 

194 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
alloying and refining. Visualization of the process using HMIs and 
SCADA (System Control And Data Acquisition) are common.
Metal Processing
Once a metal has been alloyed into its final constitution, it must be 
brought into a useful form. It is common to melt the raw alloy into 
ingots for further treatment or use a continuous process to form it 
into sheets or plates. This is often done at the smelter prior to shipping 
using extrusion or rolling mills.
Casting is a forming process that requires melting a metal and 
molding it into a shape. There are a variety of methods to accomplish 
this. Molten metal may be poured directly into a form using investment 
or “lost wax” casting. Metals may also be forced into a die at high 
pressure (die casting), poured into a mold made of sand (sand and 
shell casting), or formed by rotating the molten materials within a 
mold (centrifugal, spin, and rotocasting).
Extrusion uses metals in a liquid, plastic, or solid state to shape it 
by forcing it through a die. The metal is pushed or drawn at high 
pressure through an opening of a desired shape. It is then often 
stretched to straighten it. The process may be continuous or produce 
individually shaped pieces using a “blank” or billet. Extrusion presses 
may be hydraulically or mechanically driven.
Wire is usually made by drawing annealed metal through a hole 
in a die. Dies used for producing wire are often called draw plates 
and may have more than one hole for pulling multiple wires. 
Annealing, a heat treating process, makes metals or wires more 
flexible or ductile. Wire is often drawn more than once, making it 
thinner each time. It can be drawn up to three times before it needs to 
be annealed again.
Thicker cables or stranded wire is woven or twisted from 
individual wires by specialized equipment, often in machinery 
located directly after the draw plate. Wire is also woven into wire 
netting or wire cloth and mesh and is often further treated with heat 
or chemicals to change its properties after being drawn. Common 
metals used for wire are copper, aluminum, silver, platinum, iron, 
and gold, which have the ductility that make them suitable for wire.
Rolling is a technique that passes metal stock through a pair of 
rollers. This may be done at high temperatures, above the 
recrystallization temperature of the metal, or at lower temperatures; 
processes known as hot rolling and cold rolling, respectively. Metals 
may be rolled into rectangular cross sections as sheets or plates, rolled 
into a very thin sheet called a foil, or passed through consecutive rolls 
to shape the cross section, a process called roll forming. Roll forming 
is usually performed on coiled steel rolls. Figure 5.3 shows a roll 
former with progressive forming dies.
If metals are rolled thin enough, they may then be rerolled for 
shipment. Larger rolls are often slit into smaller rolls by other facilities. 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
195
The smaller rolls may then be further processed using cutting, 
punching, or pressing techniques.
Forging uses pressure to form metals into desired shapes. Like 
rolling, forging may take place at temperatures above or below the 
recrystallization temperature of the metal, known as hot or cold 
forging. Cast or formed pieces may be further processed after the 
shape is cooled. They are usually finished using presses or machine 
tools.
Drop forging uses a heavy weight or “hammer” to strike and 
deform the workpiece. Drop forging uses open or closed dies to shape 
the material. Open die drop forging is often called smith forging, 
while closed die forging is known as impression forging. In impression 
forging, the workpiece is often moved through a series of cavities in 
the die to achieve its final form. The hammer may be dropped several 
times, depending on the complexity of the part being forged.
Press forging applies a continuous pressure to the metal as it is 
formed. Like drop forging, dies can be partially open, allowing 
material to flow outside the die, or completely closed. Presses are 
typically hydraulic when used for forging. Press forging allows for 
more complete control of the forging process since the rate of 
compression can be timed.
Another form of press forging is known as upset forging. This is 
a method of increasing the diameter of a workpiece by reducing its 
length. Dies in upset presses often have multiple cavities and are 
used to compress rods or wires (thin rods) into the raw stock for bolts, 
screws, and other fasteners. The raw stock is then threaded in other 
FIGURE 5.3 Roll former. (Courtesy of Mills Products.)

C h a p t e r  F i v e
machinery. Engine valves and couplings are other products often 
produced by upset forging.
Presses are also used on sheet metals to form shapes by drawing 
or stretching it. If the metal is stretched longer than its diameter, it is 
known as deep drawing. Pressure and lubrication are important 
variables used in the drawing process, along with the rate of die 
movement. Another common use of presses is to punch shapes into 
sheet metal or to “coin” parts, impressing a pattern onto the surface.
Presses often have self-contained control systems. Hydraulic 
presses have pumps to move hydraulic fluid through cylinders and 
often also have a coolant pump. Motor starters or variable frequency 
drives are usually part of the control panel. Proportional valves and 
positional feedback are also typical elements of a press. Typically, 
presses are controlled by a PLC also handling safety and other 
actuators and sensors. Figure 5.4 shows a hydraulic press with the die 
removed.

Hydroforming applies water at high pressure to the inside of a 
closed metal shape such as a pipe. This allows the forming of contoured 
shapes such as curved handles. Pressurized liquid is introduced into 
the shape during the final closing of a hydraulic press die.
Powder metallurgy (P/M) is the compression of metal powder 
into a form of the desired shape. A number of different metals and 
their alloys are used in the P/M process, including iron, steel, stainless 
steel, copper, tin, and lead. Powders are produced using atomization 
(transforming a stream of molten metal into a spray of droplets that 
solidify into powder), chemical methods, and electrolytic processes. 
Powders can then be blended and ground further in a ball mill.
Forming of components is done using a variety of pressing 
techniques. Mechanical presses such as crank and toggle presses are 
often used if a high production rate is required; however, forces are 
limited. Hydraulic presses are used for higher loads, but production 
rates are lower. The formed component is then heated (but not melted) 
to allow a metallurgical bond to form between the particles. The 
forming or compacting process is usually done at room temperature 
in a die. The result of this operation is a briquette or green compact 
with a solid form. This shape is quite fragile and must be handled 
carefully.
The second step in the formation of a P/M component is the 
heating of the component, typically in a hydrocarbon gas atmosphere. 
Formed briquettes are usually heated to between 60 and 80 percent of 
the melting point of the constituent with the lowest melting point. 
This process is called sintering. The result is a formed metal solid that 
is smaller than the original component. Secondary operations such 
as restriking or reforging, sizing, heat treatment, impregnation, 
machining, grinding, and finishing may also be part of the process. 
Small parts are often made using P/M techniques because the density 
of the metal is more uniformly controlled.
Other metal-processing methods include various cutting and 
machining techniques. Shearing, sawing, and burning are common 
cutting methods. Erosion methods such as water jet or electric 
discharge are also used to cut metals. Wire electrical discharge 
machining (EDM) uses electrical current to erode material and allows 
detailed cutting beyond the capability of chip-producing processes.
Machining methods are chip-producing processes used to shape 
metals. One of the most common machining techniques is drilling, 
which uses the point of the tool to make holes in material. Milling 
uses either the side of a tool or its face to remove material. Grinding 
and polishing are other machining methods. Turning uses the rotation 
of a workpiece and a fixed or slowly moving tool to remove material. 
A common machine using this technique is a lathe. Where heat is 
generated by tool friction, cutting fluids or coolant are often used to 
remove heat from the workpiece. Coolant is usually recaptured, 
filtered, and cooled before being reused on the product.

198 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
Machine tools are often automated; servo systems precisely 
control speeds and positions. Computer numerical control (CNC) 
machines allow CAD and CAM programs to be interpreted and move 
tooling automatically to produce a part. Tools are often automatically 
changed using robotic “tool changers.” Robotic operations may also 
be used to move parts from station to station within a workcell.
CNC machines are usually programmed using G-code; however, 
other languages such as Step-NC and control languages similar to 
BASIC are commonly used also.
After forming metals into the desired shape, the metal is often 
treated using chemicals, heat, and electricity to change its properties. 
Heat treatments are generally used to change the ductility, 
malleability, or hardness of metals, while chemicals and coatings are 
used to change the finish or corrosion resistance of metals. 
Galvanization applies a protective coating of zinc to steel or iron to 
prevent rusting. Anodization increases the thickness of the natural 
oxidization layer on metal parts using an electrical process, which 
improves corrosion resistance and provides a good surface for 
adhesives or paints.
Like the smelting industry, metal processing uses automation 
extensively. Thicknesses and lengths must be accurately measured 
and roll speeds controlled and monitored. As with other industries, 
there are many OEMs that manufacture equipment specific to metal 
processing. Machines are often built around standard equipment to 
provide material handling and safety features. Production lines are 
built using individual machines, often taking product from a raw 
sheet, ingot, or blank to its finished form.
5.5.2 Plastics
Plastics are made from organic materials, usually synthetic or 
semisynthetic solids. Crude oil is processed using a method called 
catalytic cracking to break it down into substances such as gasoline, 
oils, ethylene, propylene, and the butylenes. Natural gas is processed 
using thermal cracking to produce many of the same components. 
The petrochemical monomers or raw materials that are derived 
from these substances include ethylene glycol, isobutene, isopropyl 
benzene, toluene, chloroprene, styrene, and many more. These raw 
materials are then processed further to produce rubbers, adhesives, 
lubricants, asphalts, and plastics.
There are two categories of plastics: thermoplastics and 
thermosetting polymers. All plastics are formable when they are 
heated, thus the prefix thermo. Thermoplastics do not change their 
chemical properties when they are heated and can be formed or 
molded multiple times. Polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are all 
examples of thermoplastics.

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
199
Thermosets or thermosetting polymers are formed into a shape 
one time. After they are formed, they remain solid. Thermosets are 
usually liquid or malleable before they are cured by heat or chemical 
processing. They are usually stronger than thermoplastics but are 
also more brittle. Epoxy resins, Bakelite, vulcanized rubber, Duroplast, 
and polyamides are examples of thermoset materials, as are many 
adhesives.
Additives are used to change the hardness, color, flammability, 
biodegradability, or other properties of the plastic. These may be 
added during the preprocessing stages of creating the plastic or 
added later while forming the part.
Extrusion
Plastics extrusion is a process that forms plastic material into a 
continuous profile. Extrusion is used to produce pipe and tubing, 
adhesive tape, wire insulation, and various plastic framing profiles.
Raw thermoplastic material in the form of beads or pellets is fed 
from a hopper into the rear part of the extruder barrel. A rotating 
screw forces the beads, also called resin, forward into the barrel. 
Additives are sometimes mixed with the resin to color the plastic or 
make it UV resistant. The barrel is heated to melt the plastic, usually to 
between 200°C (392°F) and 275°C (527°F), depending on the polymer. 
Heating is often done in stages, using different controllers for each 
stage, allowing the beads to melt gradually. Pressure and friction 
within the barrel contribute to the heat of the melt. Sometimes air or 
water is used to cool the polymer if the material becomes too hot. 
Figure 5.5 shows a thermoset material being extruded from a die.
After the molten plastic leaves the barrel, it is passed through a 
screen pack and breaker plate to remove contaminants. It then enters 
the die, where it is shaped to the desired profile. After exiting the die, 
the material is pulled through a cooling section, typically a water 
bath. Plastic sheeting is sometimes fed through cooling rolls. After 
cooling, secondary processes may be performed, like applying 
adhesive to tape. The finished product is then cut into sections, rolled, 
or spooled.
Injection Molding
Plastic injection molding is a process that can be used for both 
thermoplastics and thermosets. The initial stages of injection molding 
are similar to that of plastic extrusion, with beads or resin being fed 
into a heated barrel from a hopper. It is then injected into a mold 
cavity, where it cools and hardens in the shape of the mold. Molds are 
usually made of steel or aluminum and are precision machined to 
form the features of the part.
Thermosets typically use two different materials that are injected 
into the barrel. The materials begin chemical reactions that eventually 
harden the material irreversibly. This can cause problems if the 

200

material were to harden inside the barrel, so minimizing the time the 
material is in the barrel and screw is important.
Molds often have channels between cavities to allow flow of 
material, called sprue, which must be removed from the mold and 
the product. The mold also needs to be separated to remove the part. 
This separation, along with ejector pins that help push the part out of 
the mold, creates lines and marks on the product. Material that needs 
to be removed from the product is called flash and must often be 
removed manually. Figure 5.6 shows a commercially available 
injection molding machine.
Injection molding is a common process for manufacturing parts 
of every size. Injection molding machines are usually manufactured 
by OEMs who specialize in plastics. They are usually PLC controlled 
and are configurable through an HMI. Recipes and control of 
temperatures, times, and speeds are standard features. Automatic 
unloading of parts is often a feature of injection molding machines.
Thermoforming
Plastic sheets or films can be formed into a mold by heating the 
material and pulling it into a mold with vacuum. This process is 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
201
called thermoforming. Material must then be trimmed from the edges 
after cooling. Often, secondary processes such as drilling or punching 
are performed while the part is still on the machine. This and the 
trimming operation can be incorporated into the control system if 
required.
Automated thermoforming machines are much simpler to 
manufacture than extrusion or injection molding machines. They are 
often made by custom machine builders and machine shops rather 
than OEMs since they consist of essentially a frame to hold the mold, 
heaters, and plumbing for vacuum. If water or air cooling is necessary, 
this is usually easy to implement also.
Thermoforming is used on products such as cups, lids, and trays 
for the food industry; blisters and clamshells for the packaging 
industry; and specialty components for the medical field. All of these 
are examples of thin gauge thermoforming. Large production 
machines making thousands of parts an hour are often used for thin 
gauge products. Parts can be formed continuously at high speed 
using a sheet or film on a roll, similar to web processing. Indexing 
chains are often used to transport the material across molds and 
through ovens and cooling zones. These chains may have pins or 
spikes to hold the material between the molding areas, helping in the 
transport process. The remaining material is rolled up at the end of 
the line after formed parts have been removed. This material can then 
be recycled by grinding it up in a granulator.
Thick gauge products are usually made at a much slower rate 
because of the longer heating and cooling times. Unlike thin gauge 
forming, thick gauge processing usually involves loading and 
indexing individual sheets through multiple stations. Sheets are 
placed or clamped into a frame at a load station. Stations may be

C h a p t e r  F i v e
indexed linearly or on a rotating carriage. The first station heats the 
sheet, usually in a pressure box with mating molds closed over the 
sheet. Vacuum and pressurized air are used to pull or push the sheet 
into the contours of the mold. Some molds will have movable sections 
that help push the material into parts of the mold with an actuator; 
this is called a “plug.” Plug assists are used for taller or deep-drawn 
parts in addition to vacuum to help distribute the material evenly.
After a defined forming time, the mold is opened. At the same 
time, the vacuum is removed and a burst of air is applied to the 
mold—an action known as air eject. A stripper plate may also be 
actuated to assist in the removal of the formed sheet. The formed 
sheet is then indexed into a station that cools the sheet and cuts the 
parts out of the sheet with a die. Automotive door and dashboard 
panels, plastic pallets, and truck bed liners are examples of thick 
gauge thermoforming.
Blow Molding
Hollow plastic items, such as bottles, are formed in a process called 
blow molding or blow forming. There are several techniques used in 
this process, including extrusion blow molding (EBM), injection blow 
molding (IBM), and stretch blow molding (SBM). Deformable or 
moving dies are also sometimes used in the process.
The blow molding process begins with a plastic form called a 
preform, or parison—a tube of plastic with one end open for air 
injection. The parison is clamped into a mold, the parison is heated, 
and compressed air is blown into the opening inflating the form into 
the shape of the mold. After the plastic has cooled and hardened, the 
mold is opened and the part ejected. Thicker parts often have excess 
flash still attached to the part that must be trimmed. For cylindrical 
parts, this is usually done using a spin trimmer, which rotates the 
part while trimming material with a titanium blade. Figure 5.7 
illustrates the blow molding process.

203
Stretch molding first uses a preform that often has premolded 
features, such as a threaded neck for a cap connected to the parison. 
These preforms are then reheated in “Reheat Stretch” blow molding 
machines. The stretching of the plastic induces strain hardening of 
the plastic, which is useful for bottles that contain carbonated 
beverages.
EBM is used on continuous profile such as hoses and pipes. This 
is done in much the same way as standard plastic extrusion, although 
air is blown around a mandrel through the center of the tube.
Common plastics used in the blow molding process include PET, 
PC, PVC, HDPE, PE+LDPE, and LLDPE. Other brand-name products 
such as BAREX and K Resin are used also. Most blow molded 
materials are thermoplastics.
Plastic Sheet and Materials
Plastic sheet and film is produced by a rolling process called 
calendering. Material is formed by passing it through a series of heated 
rollers. Thickness is determined by setting the spacing between the 
calendering rolls. For final packaging and shipment, film can be 
rolled or spooled after cooling, while thicker plastic sheets are cut 
and a protective removable film is often applied before it is stacked 
and ready for shipment.
Sheet, films and machinable plastics are used in the packaging 
and machine-building industries, so it is important to consider some 
of the properties of plastics.

augers, bin and hopper liners, chutes, bearings, bushings, and 
gears. FDA and USDA concurrence for contact with food and

Composites and Reinforced Materials
Composite materials are plastic resins that have been reinforced with 
organic or inorganic materials. They differ from reinforced materials 
in that the fiber structure of the reinforcing material is continuous.
Plastic resins may be reinforced with cloth, paper, glass fibers, and 
graphite fibers. Usually these fibers are in short pieces that are randomly 
oriented since they are simply mixed with the resin. They do not have 
the same strength as true composite materials, which run unbroken 
through the resin. Reinforced plastics are extremely strong, durable, and 
lightweight. Reinforced plastics are manufactured in several different 
ways, including calendering of cloth with a plastic coating. Plastic 
coatings can also be brushed or sprayed onto materials.
Laminating is the process of layering different materials together. 
Often done at high pressure, sheets of material are placed between 
heated steel platens and compressed hydraulically. This bonds the 
layers of a laminate into a rigid sheet. These laminates can also be 
formed around corners and bonded to other materials.
Another common process is fiberglassing. Alternating layers of 
glass fiber fabric and plastic resin are coated over a form or mold. 
While the resin is in the liquid state, short pieces of glass fiber can be 
mixed in to provide added structure. After hardening, fiberglass can 
be finished using mechanical abrasives, such as sanding and buffing. 
Common uses for fiberglass are in the manufacture of boat hulls and 
swimming pools.
Composites are very lightweight and durable. A popular composite 
material is epoxy resin reinforced with graphite fibers. The fibers 
form the main structural component of the composite, usually the 
reinforcing fiber, makes up about half of the total material weight. 
Both thermoplastics and thermosetting materials are used in composites. 
Thermosets are often used because of the high heat that composites 
must sometimes withstand.
Composites can be manufactured in several ways. One method is 
a process called reverse extrusion, or “pulltrusion.” In this method, 
the fiber portion is pulled or drawn through liquid resin and then 
through a heated die. Structural members and tubing can be made in 
this manner. Another method is winding filaments back and forth 
around a form and coating the fibers with epoxy resin. This method 
is used to form hollow products like tanks and pressure vessels; after 
the shape has cured, the form is removed from the inside of the vessel. 
A third method of manufacturing composites is to laminate alternating 
layers of resin containing structural fibers.
5.5.3 Ceramics and Glass
Industrial ceramics are made from the oxides of metals such as silicon, 
aluminum, and magnesium. Carbides, borides, nitrides, feldspar, and 
clay-based materials are also important ingredients. Ceramics are 
produced in many of the same ways as metals and plastics; extrusion, 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
207
pressing, casting, injection molding, and sintering are all common 
methods. Most ceramic parts begin with a ceramic powder that may 
be mixed with other substances, depending on the required properties. 
Raw materials may be blended wet or dry with other ingredients, 
such as binders and lubricants.
Cold forming is the most common process in the ceramics 
industry, although hot forming processes are also used in some 
instances. Pressing techniques include dry pressing, isostatic pressing, 
and hot pressing. Slip casting is a common method of forming thin 
walled and complex shapes; this method is sometimes combined 
with the use of applied pressure or vacuum.
Extrusion is used to form continuous profiles and hollow shapes. 
This is done in a similar manner to that of plastic extrusion, although 
without the application of heat. The plastic form of ceramic material 
is simply the mixture of clay and water at ambient temperature. This 
mixture is forced through a die using a large screw called an auger.
Most ceramic materials must be heat treated after forming. This is 
necessary both to dry the ceramic form from its plastic state and to 
“fire” or harden the material into its final consistency. Intermediate 
processes such as sintering are also done to transform a porous form 
into a denser product by diffusing the material.
Final firing of ceramics is generally done in a furnace at a very 
high heat, often in the thousands of degrees. This causes the 
vitrification process to occur, where some of the components of the 
ceramic enter a glass phase, bonding some of the unmelted particles 
together and filling some of the pores in the material. This creates a 
very hard, dense, yet brittle material that may be used for many 
purposes.
Ceramics are used for insulators, in abrasives for grinding, as 
coatings on cutting tools, dielectrics for capacitors, for heat resistant 
containers, and many other products. The ceramic properties of 
hardness and resistance to high heat levels makes ceramics an 
important component in such parts as jet engine turbine components, 
engine valves, and thermal insulation tiles.
Glass is a substance that is made from inorganic materials, 
primarily SiO2, or silica. It is manufactured by heating its ingredient 
to a liquid state or “fusion” and then cooled to a rigid state. Sheet 
glass is produced by a method called floating, where molten glass is 
floated on a bed of molten metal, usually tin. After cooling the sheet 
from about 1100°C to 600°C, the sheet can be lifted out of the bath and 
placed on rollers. The glass is further cooled as it passes through a 
kiln so that it anneals without strain. This produces a continuous 
ribbon of very flat and uniform glass, which is then cut into sections 
for shipment or further processing.
Laminating sheets of glass with a plastic interlayer in an autoclave 
produces shatterproof “safety” glass that is used for automotive 
windshields. Reheating glass to a semiplastic state and then cooling it 

208 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
quickly with air or “air quenching” produces tempered glass. This 
provides glass with greater mechanical strength and creates smaller, 
less dangerous pieces if broken. Tempered glass is often specified for 
windows and doors for strength and safety.
Glass containers are produced by pressing, blowing, or a 
combination of both. Bottles, jars, and lightbulb envelopes are formed 
by blowing molten glass into a mold. This process is similar to that 
described in the blow molding of plastics, where a partly manufactured 
container called a “parison” is reheated and blown into its final shape. 
This method is known as “blow and blow” and is used for narrow-
necked containers. In the “press and blow” method, the parison is 
formed by a metal plunger pressing the solid piece of glass or “gob” 
into the mold. After the plunger is withdrawn, the parison is blown 
into the mold. A mechanism is then used to take the formed product 
out of the mold and the glass container is slowly cooled evenly, or 
annealed. Some containers undergo further treatment such as 
dealkalization—a chemical gas treatment—to improve the chemical 
resistance of the glass.
Fiber optics are formed in much the same manner as wire, by 
drawing a preform into a thin strand of glass. A hollow glass tube is 
placed horizontally on a lathe, where it is rotated slowly. The preform 
tip is heated, and optical fiber is pulled out as a string. Gases are 
injected along with oxygen as the heat is applied to optimize the 
fiber’s optical properties. Strands are grouped into a fiber-optic 
bundle and then sheathed in plastic for durability and protection.
5.6 Assembly Machines
Individual components made from metals, plastics, and other 
elements must be combined to produce many of the consumer 
products in use today. Material handling, robotics, and many of the 
mechanisms and devices discussed previously are used to put these 
components together into a usable form.
Assembly machines may be fully automated or involve manual 
operations by a machine operator. Much of the assembly process 
involves the moving of individual product elements into proximity 
with each other and fastening them together. Many times a central 
processing path is used to move an item through an assembly machine 
or production line with peripheral processes feeding components in 
from the sides. Often a product is moved on pallets and indexed 
through a series of machines. Figure 5.8 shows an assembly machine 
for cables, parts are loaded by an operator.
5.6.1 Part Handling
Assemblies often start with one base piece, usually a larger component 
of some kind. Many products have a frame or housing of some sort 
that contains other elements. If an assembly processing line is pallet 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
209
based, this first element is placed onto the pallet either manually by 
an operator or with an automated device such as a robot or pick-and-
place mechanism. Larger components may be presented in a palletized 
form or in a bin. Because of their size and often their method of 
shipping, these items may be difficult to handle with automation. 
Palletized parts are usually easier to load automatically since they 
can be precisely located within a formed pallet and the pallets can be 
made in a uniform and stackable size. Automated depalletizers are 
often built to handle these types of pallet stacks. Filled pallets enter 
on a conveyor, are destacked and emptied, and a stacker restacks the 
empties and sends them out on another conveyor. Stacks of pallets 
are generally handled by forklift.
Not all products can be easily handled by automation. Some basic 
components may be difficult or expensive to handle because of size 
or shape. Others may be hard to locate because of shipping and 
packaging methods. Items that are randomly oriented in bins or must 
be unwrapped may be more economical to load by hand.
Parts that are easily handled and located may be handled in a 
number of methods. If parts are presented in an array, such as within 
a formed or divided pallet or bin, they must be indexed, either by an 
actuator that can move a gripper to multiple X and Y positions or by 
FIGURE 5.8 Cable assembly machine.

210 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
a system such as an indexing table. These typically take the form of a 
pair of servo actuators arranged in a perpendicular manner. If parts 
are arranged in layers, a servo-operated Z-axis may also be required, 
otherwise the Z or vertical movement may be a simple pneumatic 
cylinder with a gripper, magnet, or vacuum cups on the lower end. 
Robots are increasingly used for this purpose because of their 
flexibility.
Intermediate part-handling methods are often used in assembly 
machines also. Components may be placed onto a dial table or moving 
fixture so that some kind of work can be performed on the product. 
Tooling to accurately locate the part is often mounted to the dial or 
fixture so that a device, such as a screwdriver or adhesive applicator, 
can precisely approach a point on the part. This tooling is removable 
so that it can be easily replaced or modified.
Feeders and conveyors are standard components on many 
assembly machine and production lines. Feeders usually have queuing 
and orienting outfeed sections that help locate parts precisely for 
pickup. Conveyors in assembly machines are often indexing conveyors 
with fixed stopping points. These may be cleated belt or chain type 
conveyors or chains with pendants that fixture parts accurately.
Simple methods such as pushers, lifts, pick-and–places, and 
guides are often used within assembly systems to move and maintain 
control of parts. A rule of thumb for handling parts is to never lose 
control, orientation, or containment once you have gained it. Parts 
may be oriented on a conveyor end to end, be singulated by pushing 
them perpendicular to their flow, and lined up in magazines or 
collated into rows. Once they are contained, they should never be 
placed back into a random arrangement such as a bin unless being 
rejected or removed.
5.6.2 Fastening and Joining
An important part of the assembly process is attaching parts and 
components to each other. After components of a product have been 
brought into close proximity and have been located accurately, one or 
both components are picked up or guided into contact. Parts may be 
connected using fasteners, adhesives, or using various welding 
methods.
Fasteners are often delivered from fairly standardized systems. 
Vibratory feeders are a common method of singulating and 
orienting screws, bolts, and rivets. Generally, fasteners are fed into 
a tool, such as a nut or screwdriver, by blowing oriented fasteners 
up a tube and into an intermediate escapement or buffering section. 
Queued fasteners are then brought individually to the tip or 
receiver of the driver and the fastener is installed either by an 
operator or automatically. Threaded or tapped holes are generally 
formed into the base workpiece, usually the larger of the two items 
being connected.

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
211
Most fastener systems are manufactured by OEMs who specialize 
in this type of equipment. A controller is generally attached to the 
spindle remotely. The drive mechanism is usually electrical so that 
torque can be accurately sensed and controlled. Controllers are easily 
integrated into control systems with digital I/O and communications 
interfacing to the main control system. Torque and screwdrivers 
almost always need to collect torque and angle (number of rotations) 
information for validation. Fastener systems are often operated 
manually because of the possible inconsistency of hole locations and 
angles. There is always the possibility of cross threading and the 
necessity of reversing the screw or bolt and removing it. Fasteners also 
may have flaws that require intervention by an operator. Automated 
fastener systems can be a major cause of machine downtime in 
assembly systems both in the feed system and the insertion.
Adhesive applicators use cold, air cured, or hot-melt systems to 
glue parts together. Like fastener systems, adhesive applicators and 
systems are usually made by OEMs with expertise in this field. Glues 
and adhesives are usually pumped from a reservoir to an application 
head. Cold adhesive systems are closed systems that prevent exposure 
of the adhesive to air until the glue is applied. For cold gluing 
applications, the glue may be applied using contact or noncontact 
methods. The distribution for cold systems may use a centralized 
tank with pipes to application heads or open-wheel pots, bulk 
containers with gravity feed or pumps through a siphon, or air-
operated piston or diaphragm pumps. Pressurized tanks are another 
simple way to distribute adhesives.
Cold adhesives are generally acidic. Stainless steel piping is 
generally the best choice for the distribution system. Fiber-reinforced 
engineered plastics and PVC piping are sometimes used but must be 
protected from temperature extremes and physical abuse. After 
adhesive has been distributed to a point near the applicator, plastic 
tubing and noncorrosive synthetic materials are used to bring the 
adhesive to the applicator. Pressure regulators are usually placed 
between the pumping system and dispensing guns. Manual regulators 
can be used if application time and/or line speed are constant; 
automatic regulators may be required if pressures need to vary by 
product.
Applicators may be pneumatically or electrically operated. A 
tapered needle with a ball in a nozzle seat is moved to allow adhesive 
to flow. Electric guns integrate the solenoid into the applicator with 
the needle body located inside the solenoid coil. This allows the gun to 
respond more quickly than a pneumatic valve, allowing more control 
of the amount applied. The dispensing gun may spray the glue 
through a nozzle or pattern plate, apply a bead, or extrude adhesive 
through a slot. Slot dies are used to provide an even coverage and 
control edge position. They are often used in moving web applications. 
Spray guns and bead extrusion are both noncontact methods of 

212 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
application where the nozzle does not contact the part or substrate. 
Pattern plate and slot dies are both contact methods of application.
Hot-melt systems use a melter to bring a thermoplastic adhesive 
to a liquid state. Adhesives are loaded into a reservoir in pellet, block, 
or slat form and heated. A pump is then used to carry the adhesive 
through a heated hose to the valve, gun, or manifold, commonly 
known as the adhesive dispenser. Hot-melt systems are commonly 
used for packaging applications such as carton or case sealing and 
tray forming.
Both cold adhesive and hot-melt systems may be used in an 
automated or manual process. Automated application of adhesive 
may also use heads that apply small dots of adhesive before pressing 
parts together. Adhesive systems and applicators must be cleaned 
often and require periodic maintenance.
Many assembly machines and production lines use a combination 
of automated and manual processes for joining parts. The decision on 
which method to use may be based on cost or the difficulty of 
accessing and handling certain products. Robots may be used in some 
adhesive applications but are usually not cost-effective.
Other methods of joining components include ultrasonic welding 
of plastic components and welding of metals. Ultrasonic welding 
uses high-frequency vibrations to melt plastics together. Parts are 
placed in a fixed nest called the anvil and an acoustic vibration is 
transmitted through a metal horn, or sonotrode. Vibrations are 
generated using a piezoelectric transducer known as an ultrasonic 
stack. The stack contains a converter that converts an electrical signal 
into mechanical vibration, a booster that modifies the amplitude of 
the vibrations, and the horn that applies the vibrations to the part. 
The stack is tuned to resonate at a specific frequency, usually 20 to 
40 kHz. The two parts are pressed together and an ultrasonic generator 
delivers a high-powered AC signal to the stack for an appropriate 
period of time.
Metal welding is generally done robotically in assembly machines. 
Figure 5.9 shows robotic welding of a metal tube. There are several 
methods of welding, but the most commonly used in automated 
applications are metal inert gas (MIG) or wire welding and laser or 
electron beam welding. MIG welding uses a wire feed as an electrode. 
An inert or semi-inert gas mixture is used to protect the weld from 
oxidization and contamination. The gas also acts as a shield to prevent 
porosity in the weld; porosity reduces the strength of the weld and 
may cause a pressurized vessel to leak. This method is sometimes 
called gas metal arc welding (GMAW). A related process called flux-
cored arc welding (FCAW) uses a steel wire surrounding a powder 
fill material. This wire is more expensive than solid wire but allows 
for higher speed and penetrates deeper into the metal being welded.
Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) is also called stick welding. 
It is also sometimes called manual metal arc welding (MMA) since it 

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
213
is not used in automated applications. Electric current is passed 
between a metal rod coated with flux and the workpiece. The flux 
produces a CO2 gas that protects the weld area from oxidation. The 
metal rod acts as an electrode and is consumed during the operation. 
Stick welding is often used when deeper weld penetration is required 
than wire welding.
Plasma arc welding uses a tungsten electrode and a plasma gas to 
make an electrical arc. It is often used when welding stainless steel. 
A variation of this is plasma cutting, which uses air to blow the melted 
steel out of the workpiece separating it.
5.6.3 Other Assembly Operations
Many of the operations and processes discussed in the previous 
chapters are also used during the assembly operation. Converting 
operations, such as pressing or punching, are often performed as 
long as the residue material can be easily removed. Lubrication of 
mechanical assemblies and mechanisms is also often done before 
parts are sealed.
FIGURE 5.9 Robotic welding. (Courtesy of Mills Products.)

214 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
Machining and chip-producing processes are usually performed 
on parts before they begin the assembly process, but there are 
exceptions. Inspection of parts following critical processes is also 
common. This may be a simple part presence check using discrete 
sensors or separate systems, such as leak testers or machine vision. 
Adhesive application is often checked using ultraviolet sensors that 
look for dyes mixed into the adhesive. Dimensional checks are 
performed with LVDTs or other analog devices. Check weighing may 
be done on parts that are in transit or in stations where a part is set on 
a scale. Failed parts are either removed from the line as rejects or 
marked/identified for later removal. Parts that are indexed through 
the line can be tracked either through shift registers in the software or 
through tracking devices such as bar codes or RFID tags.
Marking and labeling are also common procedures in the 
assembly process. Adhesive labels, direct printing, and pin stamping 
are methods often used to imprint alphanumeric characters or bar 
codes onto products before being packaged.
5.7 Inspection and Test Machines
Inspection and gauging machinery is often built as a stand-alone unit 
separate from the assembly process. After completion of an assembly 
process, the final product may be inspected for quality, tested for 
function or gauged dimensionally. Many of the individual components 
of an assembly may have been checked during the assembly process 
also, but final testing is common for many complex products.
5.7.1 Gauging and Measurement
There are various ways of checking the physical dimensions of parts. 
Tooling can be used to ensure that parts fit where they are designed 
to. An example is placing posts in a fixture where bolt holes are 
located on a part. Discrete sensors such as photo-eyes and proximity 
switches can be used to detect the absence, presence, or location of 
features on an assembled part. Some manual assembly stations are 
outfitted with these types of “Pokayoke” checks built in.
Figure 5.10 shows a manual 6 LVDT gauging station for 
automotive parts. LVDTs often have pneumatic actuators that can 
extend to measure the position of parts relative to the fixture or to 
each other. This is not always desirable since tooling must contact 
the part, so machine vision and optical sensors are often preferred.
5.7.2 Leak and Flow Testing
Products often need to be tested to ensure that they do not leak or that 
airflow is within prescribed limits. Seals, filters, and gaskets may be 
part of the assembly being tested. In addition to ensuring their 
presence during the assembly process, leak or flow testing ensures 
that they are installed and are operating correctly.

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
215
Systems may be as simple as a few valves, some pipe or hose, and 
a simple pressure transducer. If the purpose is simply to detect gross 
leaks, detailed validation procedures and calibration to a standard 
may not be required.
When performing tests that require more precision and a 
validation procedure, it is usually necessary to purchase a packaged 
system. As with many of the other special-purpose systems discussed 
here, these systems are usually manufactured by companies that 
specialize in the field rather than custom machine builders. 
Purchased systems such as this have a lot in common, regardless 
of the manufacturer. The system is plumbed with various valves into 
an analog pressure transducer. There is an onboard controller with 
I/O connections for triggering and results, generally 24VDC. There 
are various communication ports for exchanging information with a 
PLC or computer as well as a separate programming port and usually 
FIGURE 5.10 LVDT gauging. (Courtesy of Nalle Automation Systems.)

216 
C h a p t e r  F i v e
a printer port also. These ports may be assignable as to communication 
protocols. Ethernet/IP, RS232, or open protocols such as DeviceNet 
or Profibus are common. The RS232 or Ethernet ports generally 
transmit a configurable string containing test data, time/date, and 
selected program information. This allows the parsing of the string(s) 
for the data that the user requires for archiving and display.
Fixturing the tested device usually involves some kind of rubber 
seal. This may be a solid surface that the product is pressed against or 
an inflatable bladder that is inserted into a round hole. Regardless of 
the type of sealing, the process usually involves movement of the 
part or tooling (or both), which brings the aspect of safety, that is, 
light curtains or physical guarding, into the picture. Figure 5.11 shows 
a manually loaded leak tester for automotive parts.
FIGURE 5.11 Leak tester. (Courtesy of Nalle Automation Systems.)

P r o c e s s  S y s t e m s  a n d  A u t o m a t e d  M a c h i n e r y  
217
The interface generally allows the test parameters to be set by 
program number. Fill time, stabilize time, test time, and pass or fail 
criteria are settable within the interface. Alternatively, these can be 
externally controlled by means of I/O. A special mode for calibration 
allows the user to place a calibrated orifice into the flow circuit to test 
to a known standard. This can be automated for a periodic check.
5.7.3 Other Testing Methods
Products are often functionally tested by moving components and 
checking torque values, measuring electrical characteristics such as 
resistance or current flow, or applying power to a device and 
operating it. Many of these operations are often done at the end of an 
assembly line within a system, but “Test Benches” are often designed 
as a standalone unit to perform these checks.
Solid items are sometimes examined using ultrasonic testers or 
X-ray testers to locate internal cracks or flaws. Ultrasonic testing is 
often done in a water bath, so pumps and plumbing as well as material 
handling may be part of the machine or system. Safety and guarding 
are also important to ensure personnel are not exposed to harmful 
effects.
There are many different kinds of specialty devices, such as eddy 
current testers, which are used to check threading on the inside of 
tapped holes; ion source leak testing, which determines the size of 
tiny holes in materials; and various material testing systems for 
hardness or chemical composition. Some tests may be destructive, 
rendering the product unusable after testing. These types of test are 
usually done on a sampling basis.

CHAPTER 6
Software
S
oftware is used to drive the motions of an automated machine 
or line and to gather data about its operation. It is also used to 
design and document automated systems. As with hardware, 
there are a wide variety of vendors for automation software. 
Manufacturers of control hardware usually also provide the software 
for programming their systems. This can often be quite expensive 
since the hardware manufacturer is usually the only provider for 
such software.
Design software may be proprietary and specific to machinery or 
a general-purpose package used for other applications. CAD and 
other visualization software packages, discussed in Chap. 2, are 
commonly used for the physical design of machinery and controls.
Analysis software is used to determine whether a solution will 
work before actually implementing it or to mathematically calculate 
parameters for physical systems. This software is sometimes combined 
with design software, such as three-dimensional modeling, or provided 
as an accessory to products, such as servo systems or robots.
6.1 Programming Software
Controllers, OITs, computers, motion systems, robots, and all manner 
of other complex automation devices make use of programming 
software in order to configure a target device to behave in a certain 
way. The programming languages vary from standard programming 
languages, such as BASIC, C, or ladder logic, to customized vendor-
specific languages. Even the standard languages have wide variations 
within different vendor packages. PLC programming packages may 
all use ladder logic as a basis, but each manufacturer has developed 
their own interface and compilation strategy.
Operator interface software is typically graphical in nature. 
Buttons, set values, and indicators are drawn on a screen using 
standard tools, such as a mouse and keyboard. These items are 
assigned bit or word addresses in a controller for input or feedback. 
Pop-up text messages may be triggered from a controller to display 
machine status, and working parts of a machine or system may be 
animated to simulate the movement or status of actuators. Operator 
219

220 
C h a p t e r  S i x
interfaces can be quite elaborate and are only limited by the 
imagination of the programmer and the information that may be 
exchanged with the controller.
Robot programming software usually takes the form of classic 
programming languages of the BASIC or Fortran variety. There 
are usually various modules or code sections associated with 
items, such as points, move trajectories, logic, and local I/O. Some 
of the programming is accomplished in combination with a “teach 
pendant” attached to the robot controller. This allows the robot to 
be moved to a point by controlling the separate axes or using real-
world coordinates. The position may then be “taught” or entered 
into the robot’s coordinate point list.
Individual or multiple servo axes are often programmed 
independently of a machine’s master controller. This is because servos 
must react quickly to outside effects, such as an axis not being at the 
point where it is commanded to go. Movement of servos is monitored 
constantly by the axis controller to ensure that there is no deviation 
from the projected move. The programming of servos is usually done 
with the particular manufacturer’s software and usually consists of 
configuration settings for preprogrammed moves and speeds, fault 
reactions, and other motion parameters. Servo controllers are usually 
tied closely with a master controller. Controllers often have specialized 
motion cards in their I/O racks to perform local motion control. These 
can sometimes be configured or programmed by connecting to the 
main controller.
Programs must usually be compiled before downloading them to 
a controller. Online or real-time programming can often be done, but 
the program is still usually converted to a lower-level “machine 
language” that operates more efficiently than its graphical and user-
friendly counterpart.
6.1.1 Programming Concepts
Programming involves the entire process of design, coding, debugging, 
and maintaining software. A computer program is a series of 
instructions that tells a computer or microprocessor to perform certain 
tasks. In the automation field, the processor of these instructions may 
be a controller, such as a PLC, DCS, embedded processor, or robot 
controller. A computer may also execute instructions for data acquisition 
and display, database operations, or control functions. Programs may 
be written in a low-level, machine-specific language or in a high-level 
machine-independent language.
In automation, inputs and outputs are represented by digital 
values of “On” and “Off,” True or False, or 1 and 0. Conditional 
statements such as “If,” “Then,” “Else,” “And,” and “Or” are used in 
combination with variables to make statements that create the desired 
result. Variables are names that may represent physical I/O, data 
values in string, number or boolean form, or internal data. Variables 

S o f t w a r e  
221
may be as simple as a single letter, as in the statement “IF X AND Y, 
THEN Z,” or they can be more descriptive, such as in “IF Motor_On 
AND Button_Pressed, THEN Conveyor_On.” Descriptive variables, 
such as those stated in the previous sentence, are known as tags. In a 
dedicated controller, such as a PLC or DCS, there are usually registers 
dedicated to different types of data. Tags may then represent different 
types of data, such as bits, integers, floating point or REAL, timers, 
and counters. Some PLC platforms allow the programmer to choose 
which registers are used for which data type and size memory 
accordingly.
The representation of a program may be text based, using 
alphanumeric characters, or graphical in nature. Ladder logic, used 
in PLC programming, uses representations of electrical components, 
such as contacts and coils. Some software uses blocks similar to 
flowcharts to program. The code inside these blocks may take 
another form, such as text or ladder logic. HMI and other visual 
programs have a graphical representation of the screen that will be 
displayed to the user. Objects on that screen are configured by entering 
the tag or variable that it interfaces with. Logical functions are 
sometimes embedded in the objects to execute when they are activated 
by the user.
Regardless of the software development platform, the final 
program must satisfy some basic requirements. The program must be 
reliable. Algorithms must produce the correct results; resources, such 
as buffer and data allocation size; should be correctly used; and there 
should be no logic errors. The program should also be robust; the 
program should anticipate problems not caused by programmer 
error, such as incorrect input and corrupted data. The program should 
be usable; textual, graphical, and even hardware elements should 
improve the clarity, intuitiveness, and completeness of the user 
interface. If possible, the program should be portable; software should 
be able to run on all the hardware and operating systems for which it 
is designed. Some software development programs only operate for 
the manufacturer’s proprietary hardware. The program should be 
maintainable; present or future developers should be able to easily 
modify the code for improvements or customizations, fix bugs, or 
adapt it to new environments. Good practices and documentation 
during initial development help in this regard. Finally, a program 
should be efficient; the code should consume as few resources as 
possible. Memory leaks should be eliminated and unused code 
deleted.
6.1.2 Programming Methodologies
The first step in most formal software development processes is to 
analyze the requirements for the program. The scope of the 
requirements often determines whether a program will be written 
by a single programmer or by a team. The analysis phase involves 

222 
C h a p t e r  S i x
reviewing deliverables and determining input, processing, output, 
and data components. Many programmers or teams will use what 
is known as an Input-Process-Output (IPO) chart to list these. If it 
is possible to meet with users of the software during this phase, it 
can be advantageous. This initial phase allows programmers to be 
sure they completely understand the scope and purpose of the 
software.
After ensuring that all the requirements of the program are 
known, the next step is to design the solution. This is a graphical or 
written description of the step-by-step procedures to solve the 
problem. The method that is chosen to design the solution will depend 
on the type of software platform and the preference of the programmer. 
There are two common methods used for solution design: process 
modeling, often called structured design, and object modeling, or 
object-oriented design.
In structured design, the programmer usually begins with a 
general design and moves toward a more detailed design. This 
method is sometimes called top-down design. The first step in top-
down design is to identify the major function of the program, 
sometimes called the main routine or main module. This module is 
then broken down into smaller sections, called subroutines or 
modules. To document this procedure, programmers use a hierarchy 
chart or structure chart to show program modules graphically. This 
process is also known as flowcharting; Fig. 6.1 provides an example 
of this.
Structured design is simple, readable, and easily maintained, but 
it does not provide a way to keep the data and the program together. 
To eliminate this problem, some programmers use the object-oriented 
approach for solution design.
In object-oriented design, programmers package the data and 
procedure into a single unit, called an object. This concept of 
combining the data and program together is called encapsulation. By 
encapsulating an object, the programmer is hiding its details. The 
object sends and receives messages and also contains code and data. 
As an example, a print button or object is used to interface with a 
printer port and the attached hardware. When users access the object, 
they do not need to know how the procedure operates; they just use 
it. Programmers do need to understand how the object works so that 
they can use it effectively.
Objects are often grouped by type into classes. In standard 
computer programming, a designer uses a class diagram to represent 
classes and their relationships graphically. When programming a 
PLC or HMI, this may take the form of diagramming functions, 
special-purpose reusable code, such as servos, or OEM device 
interfaces. After completing a high-level class or function diagram, a 
designer should develop a detailed diagram for each class that 
provides a visual representation of each object, its attributes, and its 

S o f t w a r e  
223
methods. The methods are then translated into program instructions 
that perform the required tasks.
After the solution is designed, the third step is to validate the 
design. This step consists of reviewing the code for accuracy and, if 
possible, testing it with real data. There are several methods of 
validation, the simplest is known as desk checking. In this method, 
various sets of test data are developed and expected outputs 
determined independent of the algorithms. The code is stepped 
through using this data, ideally by a different programmer, and 
results are recorded. Expected results are then compared with actual 
results and faulty code is corrected. Another method is that of

emulation. Many software packages allow for the operation of a 
virtual machine or emulator. For physical machinery, inputs can be 
manipulated, HMIs can be operated, and code simulating processes 
can be run. This code is often time based; as an example, for a 
synchronous machine, a set of variables can be manipulated 
simulating the indexing of a chassis, and the relationship between 
stations can be monitored.
Implementation of the design is the fourth step in the software 
development process. If the program is simply accessing and 
manipulating data, there are usually no safety issues concerned other 
than security and the possible interruption of processes running on 
other machines. Implementation may simply consist of installing 
software, compiling the program or programs, and downloading 
them. In the case of software that operates moving machinery, I/O 
and electrical checks, safety system testing and hazard reviews with 
personnel must be completed before any code is activated. When 
using a standard personal computer, the compiled program is kept 
on the hard drive. It is loaded into random-access memory (RAM), 
along with variables and their values, when the program is started. A 
database is often used to store these variables and their values when 
power is removed from the system.
After implementing the program, it must be tested and debugged. 
This is to ensure that the program runs correctly and is error-free. In 
general, debugging of computer code involves finding two types of 
error: syntax errors and logic errors. Syntax errors are often flagged 
by the programming software using a debug utility. Incorrectly 
spelled commands, duplicate outputs in PLC programs, or illegal 
operations are examples of syntax errors. Logic errors often take 
more time to locate and cannot be done automatically. They often 
involve the movement of actuators on machines and may only be 
detected when an operation malfunctions. Debugging can be time-
consuming; code needs to be tested by operating software or 
machinery correctly and by introducing incorrect data or purposeful 
fault conditions. Since many conditions are not easy to anticipate, 
sufficient time must be allocated to try many different kinds of 
unusual circumstances.
Debugging of automation machinery involves operating actuators 
and moving parts under varying conditions and observing results. 
As such, it is an iterative process; often when solving one issue it will 
reveal another. Introducing anomalous conditions—such as E-Stops, 
flagging sensors at inopportune times, or introducing or removing 
parts—may be part of the debugging procedure.
The final step in the development process is to document the 
program and clean up the code. Most programmers comment on 
their program as they write code, but it is always a good idea to have 
peers examine the program to ensure that it is easy to read and well 
organized.

6.1.3 Languages
Programming languages are chosen based on several different 
factors. Companies may have a standard that they use a certain 
programming language because that is what their employees are 
familiar with. Customers may have a standard with which they 
require all vendors to comply. Many hardware platforms are only 
programmable with software sold by that vendor. Some software 
packages may be easier to learn than others or have capabilities not 
available in other packages. Of course, cost must also be considered. 
Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand 
will be selected.
Certain instructions and functions appear in any programming 
language. Programs must be able to handle input. This may be from a 
computer keyboard, an HMI, sensors attached to an input device, or 
from a file. They must be able to deliver output—displaying data to a 
screen, turning on physical outputs on a device, or writing data to a 
file. Instructions must be able to perform arithmetic, whether simple 
addition and multiplication or complex trigonometric and 
interpolation functions. They must be able to execute conditional 
statements, making decisions based on information and performing 
the appropriate functions in response. Finally, they must be able to 
repeat actions, often with some kind of variation.
Many computer languages also provide a mechanism to call 
functions provided by libraries. Provided the functions in a library 
follow the same method of passing arguments, then these functions 
may be written in another language. The exception is with closed 
architectures, such as PLC programming software. Most software 
packages, even proprietary ones, do, however, allow data exchange 
with such protocols as object linking and embedding (OLE), OLE for 
process control (OPC), and open database connectivity (ODBC). 
ActiveX component interfacing is also common.
Computer Languages
Source code, the written instructions that make up a program, cannot 
be directly understood by a computer or microprocessor. There are 
many different languages, but all must be converted or “compiled” 
into a hexadecimal machine language that a processor can understand. 
Machine language or machine code instructions use a series of binary 
digits arranged in groups of hexadecimal numbers. These are not 
visibly interpretable by a programmer since they do not use 
meaningful instructions or codes. Machine language is also known as 
first-generation code.
The second generation of code is a low-level language known as 
assembly language. This is a language written in symbolic instruction 
codes that are meaningful abbreviations, such as A for Add, C for 
Compare, LD for Load, and so on. While easier to write and 
understand, coding in assembly language is very tedious and not 

226 
C h a p t e r  S i x
efficient for the programmer. Figure 6.2 shows a section of assembly 
language code with its hex or machine code equivalent.
Procedural languages, often known as third-generation languages, 
use English-language words like ADD, PRINT, IF, and ELSE to write 
instructions. DO WHILE and FOR NEXT are common program control 
and repetitive task instructions. They also use arithmetic operators such 
as “*’ for multiplication and “/” for division. Third-generation languages 
must be interpreted or compiled into machine language also. The 
resulting machine language program is known as object code. Compilers 
convert the entire program before executing it, while interpreters 
translate and execute the code one line at a time. An advantage of 
interpreted code is that if an error is found, the interpreter will provide 
feedback immediately. Many languages have both an interpreter and a 
compiler for easy program development. COBOL and C are examples 
of third-generation languages.
Other “classic” programming languages include BASIC, Fortran, 
and several others. Variations of these are often used in OEM 
equipment to perform logic functions such as printing and presenting 
test or operation results.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses items that can contain 
both data and the procedures that read or manipulate it. These items 
are called objects. An advantage of OOP is that once an object has been 
created, it can be reused and modified by other existing or future 
programs. An object represents a transaction, event, or physical object. 
In addition to being able to work with objects, OOP languages are 
event driven. Events are actions, such as keyboard or other device 
inputs. These may be generated by pressing a button on an HMI, a 
sensor being activated in a control system, or typing a value into a text 
box. Examples of OOP languages are Java, C++, C#, and Visual Basic.

PLC Languages
The IEC has defined an open international standard for PLCs. IEC 
61131-3 is the third section of eight and deals with programming 
languages. Three graphical and two textual languages are defined in 
the standard. Text-based languages are instruction list (IL) and structured 
text (ST), while the graphical languages are ladder diagram (LD), 
function block diagram (FBD), and sequential function chart (SFC).
The standard also defines data types and variables, configuration 
of PLCs, program organization units, resources, and tasks. The 
elements in this standard had already existed for many years before 
the standard was created in 1993, but the definition helped to pull 
many of the diverse elements of different platforms into a common 
framework.
Data types in PLC programming are defined as follows:
Bit strings (groups of on/off values):
BOOL—1 bit
BYTE—8 bit
WORD—16 bit
DWORD—32 bit
LWORD—64 bit
Integers (whole numbers):
SINT—Signed Short, 1 byte
INT—Signed Integer, 2 byte
DINT—Double Integer, 4 byte
LINT—Long Integer, 8 byte
U—Unsigned Integer (prepend to type to make unsigned)
Real (fl oating point IEC 559, IEEE):
REAL—4 byte
LREAL—8 byte
TIME (duration for timers, processes)
Date and time of day:
DATE—(calendar date)
TIME_OF_DAY—(clock time)
DATE_AND_TIME—(time and date)
STRING (character strings surrounded by single quotes)
WSTRING (multibyte strings)
ARRAY (multiple bytes stored in the same variable)
Subranges (limits on values, such as 4 to 20 current)
Derived (derived from the above types):
TYPE—Single Type
STRUCT—Composite of several variables and types (that 
is, UDT)

228 
C h a p t e r  S i x
Data elements may be held in predefined registers, or, in some cases, 
their location may be completely assignable and configurable by the 
user.
Variables are defined within the standard as being global 
(accessible by all routines), direct or local (accessible only by the 
containing routine), I/O mapping (inputs and outputs), external 
(passed from an outside source), and temporary. Configurations of 
the program are also defined. Resources are items originating from or 
pertaining to the CPU itself. Tasks are groups of programs or 
subroutines of which one is usually designated as the “main.” There 
may be multiple mains per CPU. Programs and subroutines then run 
under tasks and form organizational units or subunits.
Other program organization units include functions, such as 
ADD, SQRT, SIN, COS, GT, MIN, MAX, AND, OR, and others, that 
may also be custom or user defined. Function blocks are containers 
for these functions. They may be customized or can be available as 
libraries from vendors or third parties.
An LD, or ladder logic, is a graphical representation of physical 
coils and contacts derived from the time when relays were used to 
control systems. Program elements are arranged in horizontal lines 
called rungs that simulate an electrical circuit. These lines are drawn 
between two vertical lines called rails. Contacts, coils, timers and 
counters, and various data operations are arranged along the rungs 
of the diagram. The resulting graphic looks very similar to a ladder, 
hence the name. Figure 6.3 shows a section of ladder logic.
Contacts may be NO, NC, or various forms of one-shot or single-
scan contacts. Coils are similar to coils of a relay and may be active 
only if the preceding logic is true or may retain its state as a latch-
unlatch or set-reset pair. Constructs such as timers, counters, and 
mathematical functions are predefined as elements in ladder software. 
Some PLC software manufacturers have hundreds of predefined 
special-purpose functions, while others allow the creation of functions 
by the programmer.
Rather than operating linearly and waiting for an instruction to step 
before the program proceeds, a PLC scans the entire program from start 
to finish, then updates the internal I/O table many times per second. 
This is one reason why PLCs are considered more deterministic than 
computers. It can also create race conditions if a programmer is not 
careful. This is where operations do not happen in the order intended, 
because rungs are active elsewhere in the program. This condition is not 
always dependent on where the operation is located in the program.
Because of the inherent program difficulties associated with 
scanning, sequencers are often used to control program flow. These 
define the state of an action or process by numerical “equal” 
statements or bit-of-word logic. A common use for a sequencer would 
be in the definition of a step-by-step automatic sequence to control a 
mechanism such as a pick-and-place.

S o f t w a r e

Because PLC programming software is developed by different 
companies for different hardware, the symbols or names of variables, 
devices, and techniques can vary widely. Inputs are commonly 
labeled I or X, while outputs are usually O, Y, or Q. Timers are usually 
T and counters C, while internal bits and variables can be nearly 
anything. Techniques for performing mathematical functions may 
use a single block with multiple variables, such as ADD, with A and 
B being added to produce result C. Another technique is to use 
separate commands, such as Load A (LD A), Load B (LD B), ADD,

OUT C. These would typically be placed in the same rung; the load 
command is loading a register known as the accumulator.
FBDs use boxes and lines to indicate program flow. The diagram 
describes functions between input and output variables, using arrows 
to connect blocks signifying the movement of data. Single lines called 
“links” are used to connect logical points within the diagram. The 
lines are oriented with arrows at one end. Figure 6.4 shows an example 
of FBD programming.
Links are drawn to connect an input variable to the input of a 
block, the output of a block to the input of another block, or the output 
of a block to an output variable. Multiple right side connections can 
also be used with a junction point, these are known as divergences.
SFCs are another graphical method of programming. SFC 
programming is based on a graphical language called Grafcet, which 
is a method of representing automated systems and logic flow. The 
components of SFC are steps, along with their associated actions; 
transitions with their logic conditions; and directional links between 
steps and transitions.
Steps in SFC may be either active or inactive. They are activated 
either upon being designated as an initial step by the programmer or 
by preceding logic. If all the steps before a step have activated and 
the logic connecting them becomes true, then the current step will 
become active. Variables associated with a step may be Set (S), Reset 
(R), or Continuous (N). Set and reset commands are latched and 
unlatched, while the continuous action N is only on if the step is 
active. Figure 6.5 is an example of an SFC.
A sequence of steps in SFC is abbreviated as a POU. Multiple 
POUs can be active at once, making SFC a parallel language. Outputs 
and variables from one POU can be used in another, an action known 
as “forcing.” LDs can also be used within the blocks of an SFC

very easy to test, maintain, troubleshoot, and design with.
IL is a low-level text-based language similar to assembly language. 
Prior to the use of graphic terminals and PCs, ladder logic had to be 
entered into the PLC using a handheld terminal with a keypad. The 
language consists of many lines of code with each line representing 
one operation. Mnemonic codes are used for operations and addresses 
must be referred to directly, that is, no symbols or comments.
Instructions and expressions use a memory construct known as a 
stack. Instruction values are entered line by line and “pushed” onto 
the stack. After all lines have been entered for a rung, the logical 
calculations within the stack are performed up to the output device 
statement. Figure 6.6 shows an example of IL programming.
IL programming is the most fundamental level of PLC 
programming languages; all ladder programs can be converted to IL. 
IL programs cannot always be converted to ladder, however, since it 
is easily possible to build illegal rungs. If instructions compatible 
with IEC 61131 are used, IL can be used to migrate programs from 
one vendor platform to another.

ST is a high-level textual language based on PASCAL. Variables 
and function calls are defined by IEC 61131; they share common 
elements with other languages within the standard. Because of the 
adherence to the standard, a ladder logic program can call a structured 
text subroutine.
ST programs are composed of statements separated by semicolons. 
Programs start with statements defining variables, and the program 
begins following these declarations. Programs then use predefined 
statements, subroutines, and variables to execute the code. Good 
practices, such as indenting and comments, should be used as with 
any programming protocol. ST is not case sensitive, but making 
statements uppercase and variables lowercase can be a useful 
technique to enhance readability. Figure 6.7 shows an example of ST 
programming.
Unlike linear programs used in computers, ST is scanned 
continuously as indicated in the ladder logic description above. 
Because of this difference it is important to ensure DO-WHILE or 
FOR-NEXT loops do not take too much time to execute. PLCs 
constantly monitor the time it takes to complete a full scan with a 
watchdog timer. If the configured time is exceeded, a controller fault 
will be created.
Organization of code in all the previously listed programming 
methods uses tasks, programs, and subroutines for program control 
and separation. Usually, a main routine is used to call the subroutines. 
A common method of organization is to place inputs, outputs, 
sequences, faults, and system/mode control in separate subroutines. 
If a machine or line is fairly large, these subroutines are then placed 
in groups of program “cells” or “stations” for organization. For 
example, a device like a dial table, pick-and-place, or robot may be 
placed in its own program with subroutines for inputs, outputs, and

so on. Tags within each program or cell are considered local and can 
only be seen by routines within the program. Tags scoped for the 
controller are global and can be seen by all programs. Figure 6.8 
shows the organization of a sample program in Allen-Bradley’s 
ControlLogix software.
Well-known PLC programming software packages include Allen-
Bradley/Rockwell Software, Siemens, Modicon, Omron, Mitsubishi, 
Automation Direct/Koyo, and many more. Not all software makes 
use of the IEC 61131 standard for compatibility, but all are 
programmable in ladder and can usually also be viewed as an IL.

computer or a controller is made easier by the use of images and 
graphics to guide the user through operations.
The goal of any GUI is to allow the user to interface with the 
software and underlying system in a simple and intuitive way. 
Location of similar devices in the same position on each screen and 
laying out elements in the order in which they are used are both 
important techniques in interface design. The user should be able to 
navigate through the screens with little or no instruction. GUI design 
should be an iterative process with improvements being made 
constantly as the software is developed.
The Windows operating system is an example of a GUI. 
Commercial programs that run in Windows have familiar elements 
such as menus, radio buttons, icons, windows, and check boxes. Some 
programs also use buttons that reference the function keys on the 
keyboard. This technique is carried over into many operator interfaces 
both with and without touch screens.
Custom GUIs may be programmed in a variety of languages. 
Most languages have common devices such as buttons, text and

numerical inputs, and the ability to interface with objects and 
components. Visual Basic was one of the early platforms used for 
GUI programming and is still used. Other common programming 
languages are Java, .NET, Python, C/C++/C#, and Perl, among 
others. Figure 6.9 is an example of a robot programming software 
GUI run on the Microsoft Windows operating system.
There are important questions to consider when developing a 
GUI for computer use. How easy is the language to learn and 
implement? Do you need customized controls, and will it interface 
with different objects? Will it need to run on different platforms, that 
is, Windows, Unix, Apple? For simple utilities running on a Windows 
platform, Visual Basic 6 is probably the easiest to learn. More 
powerful—but still relatively easy to learn—is C#, while Java is a 
good choice for running across different platforms.
Most of the larger PLC manufacturers also make GUI development 
software for the PC. They tend to cost more than the above listed 
programs, often being priced by the number of tags that will be used. 
These packages are generally easier to learn and have built-in drivers 
and configurations for PLCs. They also interface with objects such as 
ActiveX components and use OLE. OPC and ODBC are also standard. 
If developing a GUI for a specific brand of PLC, this is often a good 
choice.
In automation, if a computer is chosen over a simpler HMI it is 
usually because of requirements like data archiving and retrieval, 
interfacing with other computers on a network, and access to other 
software on the same computer. Computers are usually not as robust 
FIGURE 6.9 Windows GUI.

C h a p t e r  S i x
for plant floor applications as dedicated HMIs and can be expensive 
when industrial versions are used. Because of this, hybrid HMIs 
running Windows CE are often used as HMIs. These can interface with 
a server to log data while still booting up faster than a standard PC.
For standard HMIs, the software development package is 
provided by the manufacturer. In most cases, they can be interfaced 
with several different PLCs, although functionality may be limited 
outside the manufacturer’s product. PLC bits and words are 
addressed either directly (by address) or through the use of tags. 
Tags can often be imported directly from the PLC or through an 
intermediate step like importing a .csv (comma separated file) 
through Microsoft’s Excel. Figure 6.10 shows a GUI developed for a 
machine HMI.
Automation-related GUI and HMI software generally has a 
number of features not found in open packages like Visual Basic and 
Java. Because the software interfaces with machinery, alarm display 
is an important part of the package. Alarms are created based on bit 
status or the numerical range of tags. They can be prioritized and 
displayed in order of priority. Buttons for acknowledging and clearing 
the alarm are standard objects. Alarms can be made different colors 
and sometimes have an alternate text field that can display a corrective 
action. A history display is often standard in a software package that 
allows a configurable number of alarms to be archived along with 
time of occurrence, time of acknowledgment, and time of reset or 
fault correction.
Graphics can be imported to assist the operator in identifying 
machine sections. Indicators are often superimposed over graphics to 
draw attention to an occurrence, such as a blinking red icon for an 
E-Stop or a red rectangle for an open guard door. Graphical

representations of actuators may be “animated” or moved on the 
screen to show their position. Sensor indicators are often placed on 
the screen to show actuator status.
Push buttons are configured with both a button tag and an indicator 
tag. If the button is used to control an actuator in manual mode, the 
button tag sends the command to the controller, while the indicator is 
used to indicate its position. The position status is generally directly 
indicated by the state of the sensor; although if a sensor is not used, it 
may be controlled by the output command status.
GUIs for automated machinery are often programmed in a 
hierarchical manner, with a main screen and various “trees” of 
displays. It is common for a graphic of the entire machine or 
production line to be placed on the main or “start-up” screen with 
areas of the graphic acting as screen select buttons leading to cells or 
stations. Other buttons placed on the main screen may lead to 
production data displays, calibration screens, fault histories, password 
setup, and I/O status screens. Security is usually a part of the GUI 
programming package, with different levels of security giving access 
to password-protected screens.
Robot Programming
Robots are programmed using a combination of a computer and a 
teach pendant. There are two basic types of data that must be 
programmed or taught: procedures and positional data. The setup 
and programming of motions and sequences is usually done by 
linking the robot controller to a computer with the programming 
software installed. Initial communication parameters are set up using 
the pendant to allow the controller to interface with both the 
programming computer and any other controllers.
Once the programming computer has been connected, programs 
and positional data can be transferred from computer to robot 
controller and vice versa. Program design for robots is similar to that 
for machines in general; it is usually a good idea to start with a 
flowchart or sequence of events. Articulated robots perform by 
storing a series of positions in memory and moving to them at various 
times in their programming sequence. For example, a robot that is 
installing a part on a workpiece might have a simple pick-and-place 
program similar to the following:
Define points P1–P5:
1. At home position (defined as P1)
2. 10 cm above bin with part (defined as P2)
3. At position to take part from bin (defined as P3)
4. 10 cm above workpiece (defined as P4)
5. At position to release part at workpiece (defined as P5)

Move to P2
6. 
Move to P4
7. 
Move to P5
8. 
Open gripper
9. 
Move to P4
10. Move to P1 and finish
After defining points and events, the program is written using the 
computer software. Software usually uses procedural languages as 
described in the computer language section (Sec. 6.1.3). Decision-
based structures, such as IF-THEN-ELSE and logical statements, are 
standard in robot software.
Programs may be much more complex than the example above. 
Handshakes using I/O from other controllers are common. These 
may be physically wired into points and addressed as local I/O or be 
interfaced using communications methods such as DeviceNet, 
Profibus, or Ethernet/IP.
A robot and a collection of machines or peripherals are often 
referred to as a cell or workcell. A typical cell might contain a parts 
feeder, an assembly station, and a robot. A PLC is often used to control 
the other stations and provide direction to the robot. How the robot 
interacts with other machines or stations in the cell must be 
programmed, both with regard to their positions in the cell and 
synchronizing with them. I/O mapping is a common element of a 
robot program, configuring inputs as commands to the robot and 
outputs as status bits. The cell controller may step the robot through 
every motion individually, or the robot may perform a sequence of 
moves, only stopping for interrupt or fault conditions.
Positions may be taught in several ways. X-Y-Z positions may be 
specified within the program, using a GUI or text commands. This 
technique has limited value because it relies on accurate measurement 
of the positions of the associated equipment and also relies on the 
positional accuracy of the robot. Robot positions can be taught via a 
teach pendant. Common features of such units are their ability to 
manually send the robot to a desired position or “inch” or “jog” to 
adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since 
a low speed is usually required for careful positioning or while 

S o f t w a r e  
239
test-running through a new or modified routine. This is probably the 
most common method of teaching positions on articulated robots. 
Another technique offered by many robot manufacturers is “Lead by 
the Nose.” In this method, one user holds the robot’s manipulator, 
while another person uses the pendant to deenergize the robot, 
causing it to go limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the 
required positions and/or along a required path while the software 
logs these positions into memory. The program can later run the robot 
to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular 
for tasks such as paint spraying.
A common device interfaced in robot software is machine vision. 
There are basically two different ways to use machine vision with 
robots: mounting the camera on the robot’s end effector tooling, so 
that wherever the tooling moves is what the camera is looking at, and 
mounting the camera in a fixed position to look at the robot’s area of 
operation.
The first thing that has to be done is to place the two systems on 
the same coordinates. If the robot is at an angle to the camera’s field 
of view (FOV), the robot’s work space or frame reference must be 
changed. For this, a calibration grid is used, which is a printout of a 
checkerboard pattern with squares of a known dimension.
The printout is placed in the approximate center of the camera’s 
FOV so that the x-axis of the pattern lines up with the camera pixels. 
The robot is then taught two points on the x-axis and entered into a 
“work” or frame variable. When this work space is invoked, the 
robot’s X-Y space is then referenced to this variable.
The camera is then used to capture the image and save it. Cognex 
has an algorithm for calibration that places crosshairs at all the 
intersections on the grid. One set is then chosen as the origin, and the 
X and Y directions are defined from there. The robot is then used to 
locate the coordinates of the origin, and the data is entered into the 
camera. After the grid spacing is entered, the calibration algorithm is 
triggered, and the camera can then report the location of objects 
within the FOV in real-world robot X-Y coordinates.
Because objects at the edge of the FOV are farther from the lens, a 
parallax is created where coordinates have to be slightly scaled—this 
is another feature of the Cognex vision system. This is common in 
vision applications where measurement data must be very accurate. 
In some applications, the X and Y coordinates, as well as the rotation 
of the target object, are sent directly to the robot controller from the 
vision system. These values can then be massaged slightly to create a 
pickup point for the robot. The Z value will be a constant if picking 
from a one-dimensional array of parts. If not, another camera can be 
used to capture the position or an array of offsets can be used.
Using a camera with a fixed FOV is fairly straightforward because 
the coordinates remain constant, as does the focus. If the camera is 

240 
C h a p t e r  S i x
mounted on the end effector tooling, the coordinate system needs to 
follow the robot’s position and the focus may need to vary. This 
brings up an entirely different set of issues to be addressed. It is also 
common for the camera to be offset from the gripper tooling in both 
cartesian and rotational coordinates.
6.2 Design Software
Design software is often used to produce drawings in two or three 
dimensions of a physical system. 3-D modeling packages such as 
AutoCAD Inventor, SolidWorks, and Pro-E are used by a designer to 
lay out machines or manufactured products. Electrical and pneumatic 
circuits and other systems are often drawn in a 2-D drafting package 
such as AutoCAD or AutoSketch. These packages are often 
customized for the discipline of the designer. For instance, an 
electrical designer may have no need for three-dimensional drawings 
but may require libraries of special devices or cross-references to 
catalog part numbers. Many component manufacturers have made 
their hardware available in a variety of drawing formats for these 
libraries.
Design software is also available for devices such as CPLDs, 
FPGAs, ASICs, and other processors. These devices are used in 
embedded controllers, usually in OEM equipment. This software 
allows the user to configure electrical systems for board-level 
components, laying out architectures and power management and 
performing simulations. This software is also a useful tool for board-
level vision systems and image processing. Altera is a manufacturer of 
both components and design software for system-on-a-programmable-
chip (SOPC) design.
Special-purpose software for development of P&ID diagrams or 
other specialized documents contain tools allowing the developer or 
designer to quickly generate drawings for their purpose.
6.3 Analysis Software
Analysis software is used for sizing servomotors, determining stresses 
on mechanical systems and constructions, or calculating any factor in 
the design process. Engineers often create their own analysis software 
on platforms like Microsoft Excel, MATLAB, or LabVIEW.
Vendors often provide software free or at a nominal fee to assist 
purchasers of their products in selecting a proper solution. Allen-
Bradley’s Motion Analyzer software is a useful program for 
configuring servo systems. It allows the user to enter information 
about the application, such as size and physical attributes of the 
applied load, required speed, available power, and duty cycle. It then 
calculates inertia and other physical parameters and provides a 

S o f t w a r e  
241
selection of motor and gearbox pairs to satisfy the solution. Siemens 
Drive ES does the same. Because these are provided by the hardware 
vendors, the motor choices are limited to those provided by the 
vendor.
Pneumatic hardware vendors also provide sizing software for 
their products, allowing the user to provide weights and speeds along 
with available air for the application. Valve banks and actuators are 
then selected by the software—again, only from the vendor’s 
products. Details such as cylinder style, mounting methods, and 
sensors are all configurable. Festo, SMC, and Numatics all have useful 
software for this purpose.
Pneumatic, hydraulic, and servo software is also available from 
third-party vendors; however, it mostly provides simulations and 
does not select product numbers for the user. Instead, it sizes 
components by kW, bore size, and so on, and leaves it to the user to 
choose components.
Factory physics and simulation software can be used to model a 
plant in 3-D. Routing of products, production times, shift calendars, 
and downtime can be programmed into the simulation and used to 
determine bottlenecks in a process. Since the simulation can be sped 
up and run using different product, process, and resource 
combinations, this type of software can help optimize performance 
and make production more efficient. Popular factory simulation 
software packages include AutoMod, eMPower, ProModel, FlexSim, 
the UGS VisFactory suite, including VisSim and VisProduction, and 
Adept Technology’s Production Pilot software.
Machine simulation software can also be used to simulate 
product and actuator movement in a production line. Most 3-D 
CAD-CAM programs allow for a certain amount of simulation 
within the solid model to determine interferences and maximum 
rates. From a machine-building perspective, simulation software can 
help avoid risk and correct unbuildable conditions. SolidWorks, 
Pro-E, and AutoCAD Inventor all have the ability to simulate machine 
movement.
6.4 Office Software
Various office-type software products are used as part of the 
documentation process. Spreadsheets are used to document bills of 
material and capture costs, databases are used to archive data for 
easy retrieval, and word-processing software is used to generate 
written documents describing maintenance and operation of a 
machine or system.
Project management software allows schedules to be created and 
tracked as the implementation of a project progresses. Milestones are 
created and tasks can be shifted with dependencies being moved in 

242 
C h a p t e r  S i x
concert. The number of resources required to finish a project by a 
certain date can be determined along with visually representing the 
critical path of a project. Estimates can then be adjusted and their 
impact viewed as a project progresses, creating a record that can be 
analyzed upon project completion.
Presentation software allows the visualization of a project or plan 
for meetings. Flowcharting software can be used for software design 
or project flow. Contact management and live meeting software allow 
people in different places to communicate with each other effectively.
Because of the widespread use of the Microsoft Windows 
operating system, most of the office software used in industry is 
compatible with the Microsoft Office software suite. This suite 
includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, Access, Outlook, and several 
utility applications. Microsoft Project is most often used for project 
scheduling and tracking.
Macros within spreadsheet packages are also used extensively for 
data collection, calculations, and display. These are marketed by 
third-party developers to operate within a standard spreadsheet like 
Microsoft Excel. They allow users to turn data into histograms, Pareto 
charts, and other analysis graphs and displays.
6.5 SCADA and Data Acquisition
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) packages are used 
to both control automated systems and gather information about the 
processes. SCADA is nearly always installed on a computer or 
computers and is usually networked to other controllers on the plant 
floor. Controllers act as collection points for machine or node-specific 
data and often act as a backup for the collected information. Operator 
terminals may also be used as data entry points for operators, 
supervisors, or engineers. These may or may not be attached to a 
machine controller.
One of the major purposes of a SCADA system is to archive and 
share data. Data may be gathered on a periodic or event-driven basis. 
As an example, pressure values from various points may be logged 
on a periodic timescale, such as minutes or hours, or values may be 
recorded when a pressure crosses an alarm threshold. Values are 
often recorded to standard database platforms or formats such as .dbf 
files or SQL databases. This allows the data to be manipulated with 
third-party software packages for statistical analysis or archiving.
Computers running the SCADA software packages are connected 
to sensors through controller communication ports or through cards 
mounted in the computer itself. Some manufacturers have developed 
their own hybrid computer systems by placing a computer card in a 
chassis containing I/O and communications cards rather than using 
off-the-shelf computer systems. This can have the advantage of 

S o f t w a r e  
243
making for a more rugged system, but it can increase system cost and 
make it more difficult to find replacement components.
Data acquisition systems can often run without being connected 
to a computer. These are similar to SCADA systems except that they 
often run without having a graphical interface.
6.6 Databases and Database Programming
Automation systems must often save data in an organized and easily 
retrievable way. Production data—such as machine OEE, operator 
log-in, product and password management, and historical information 
on each machine—are often managed through data exchange with a 
database, which is simply an organized collection of data. Information 
is stored in a way that it can easily be accessed by categories at a later 
date. Pieces of data can relate to each other in various ways. 
Correlations of one type of information with another must be made 
in a meaningful way from the factory floor or from within management 
software.
Data is usually categorized in classifications that can support the 
process of relating the information pieces to each other and drawing 
conclusions from it later. An example might be relating machine 
faults to product selection to determine if a machine may need 
mechanical work on a station to accommodate a specific product.
Here is another example of how a database might be used in a 
business scenario. An engineer keeps a schedule of critical production 
and task dates for each job number. Purchasing uses a spreadsheet 
with component part numbers and delivery dates, also by job number. 
A project manager then uses a database to enter customer information 
and link to the engineer and purchasing data sets by using the job 
number as the primary key. Reports can then be generated using this 
information for a specific project, perhaps by determining whether a 
project schedule slipped because of late part shipments or other 
causes. By changing the primary key to look at reports by vendor, 
comparisons can be made to track on-time and correct part shipment 
percentages.
A database is technically only the data and its structures, not the 
management and relational aspects that control it. The engines that 
actually perform searches and access data are contained within the 
database management system (DBMS). The data and DBMS together 
are called a database system.
Commonly used database management systems include Microsoft 
Access and SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and several SQL-based 
variants. SQL is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language, a 
method of relating data categories in multiple ways. Object-oriented 
and object-relational databases often use a query language called 
Object Query Language (OQL), which uses many of the same rules, 
grammar, and keywords as SQL. A DBMS is required to manage data 

244 
C h a p t e r  S i x
according to availability to multiple users simultaneously, accuracy, 
usability or user-friendliness, and resilience or recovery from errors. 
This can be a complex task, and systems often connect many different 
servers and data collections. Nearly every aspect of business uses 
databases in various ways and on different platforms that often do 
not communicate directly. This requires additional software to 
perform translation and control of data and its acquisition, usually 
using standards like SQL and ODBC together.
Databases can be classified in a number of ways—by their content, 
such as text, images, or file types, or by their application area, such as 
production, accounting, or maintenance. The term may also refer to 
the logical programming and data retrieval aspect or the data content 
in computer storage. Following are some of the different types of 
database in use.
A relational database stores data in rows and columns. Each row 
has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It 
can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be different for 
each record, such as a social security number, or it can be generated 
by the DBMS. Each column also must have a unique name. Access, 
MySQL, and SQL Server are examples of relational databases.
An object-oriented database (OODB) stores data in objects. Objects 
are items that contain data as well as the procedures that read or 
manipulate it. Members of the database are objects that might contain 
several related data characteristics, such as name, address, and age, 
as well as the instructions for how to print the record or a formula to 
calculate a member’s paycheck. A relational database would contain 
only the data about the member. GemFire and Versant are two 
OODBs.
There are several programs that are known as object-relational 
databases, which have the ability to do both. Examples of these are 
DB2, Oracle, and Visual FoxPro.
A multidimensional database stores data in dimensions. While a 
relational database uses columns and rows (two dimensions), a 
multidimensional database allows for more than two dimensions, 
allowing users to access and analyze the view from any aspect. 
This multidimensional table is sometimes called a “hypercube.” 
The number of dimensions used will depend on the requirements 
of the application. An example might be a database with product, 
manufacturer, vendor, time, and the model of machine it is used 
on. A user would be able to look up data by date, product number, 
vendor, and so on. Multidimensional databases are also faster at 
consolidating data than relational databases. A query that takes 
minutes to process in a relational database may take seconds in 
a multidimensional database. A well-known multidimensional 
database is Oracle Express.
Databases are also classified by their content. A multimedia 
database stores images, audio clips, and video clips. A voice mail 

S o f t w a r e  
245
system database is an example. A groupware database stores 
schedules, calendars, manuals, memos, and reports. Searching a 
schedule for available rooms or meeting times would use a groupware 
database. A CAD database stores data about engineering designs 
and drawings. It might include lists of components, relationships 
between parts or drawings, and drawing revision data.
When designing a database, it is a good idea to follow some basic 
guidelines. First, the purpose of the database must be determined. 
This will help the designer with what kind of information will be 
required. Next, the tables or files should be designed. Each table 
should contain data about one subject. For example, the product file 
should only contain data about the product. Third, the records and 
fields are designed for each table or file. Each record should have a 
primary key. Separate fields should be used for logically distinct 
items; a name, for instance, should have fields for title, first, last, and 
so on. Fields should not be created for information that can be 
derived from other fields (for example, the field for age can be 
derived from a birth date field). After the tables and files are 
completed, the relationships between them can be determined, 
completing the design.
For database users, macros can be used to remember sequences of 
operations, automating repetitive functions. These macros can be 
saved and reused any time a similar task needs to be performed, 
creating easily modified user tools.
6.7 Enterprise Software
Enterprise computing often involves the use of computers in LANs 
or wide area networks (WANs). Businesses produce and gather large 
volumes of information about customers, products, suppliers, and 
employees. This information often flows both inside and outside the 
enterprise, with users consuming information and computers tracking 
interactions.
Information systems can be organized into five basic categories:
1. Office information system (OIS): This enables employees to 
perform tasks with computers rather than manually. This is 
sometimes referred to as office automation. OISs support 
administrative activities such as word processing, spreadsheets, 
databases, presentation graphics, e-mail, personal information 
management, and groupware. Appointment management and 
scheduling are also components of this system.
2. Transaction-processing system (TPS): This captures and 
processes data from daily business activities. A transaction is 
an individual business activity, such as an order, deposit, 
payment, reservation, or employee clock-in. TPSs were some 

246 
C h a p t e r  S i x
of the earliest forms of computerized data processing. Early 
TPSs used batch processing; in this method the computer 
collects data over time and processes all transactions later as 
a group. Batch processing is used by many businesses to 
calculate paychecks or print invoices. Online transaction 
processing is done in real time, with data being exchanged 
immediately. Credit card processing is an example of this.
3. Management information system (MIS): This generates 
information for managers and other users to utilize in making 
decisions, solving problems, supervising activities, and 
tracking progress. The computer’s ability to compare data 
and generate reports with only the required information 
makes this a useful tool. MISs are usually integrated with 
TPSs. The system can take information on customer sales, 
account balances, and inventory and generate reports 
recapping daily, weekly, and monthly activities. It can flag 
issues like unpaid balances or spot trends and make forecasts. 
MISs create three basic types of report: detailed, summary, 
and exception. Detailed reports are simply lists of transactions, 
usually sorted by date. Summary reports make data easier to 
understand by consolidating it into tables, charts, and graphs 
with totals for some time period. Exception reports flag data 
that falls outside the norm, such as unpaid bills or part 
inspection failures.
4. Decision support system (DSS): This helps users analyze data 
generated by TPSs and MISs. These systems often use data 
from both internal and external sources. Internal data might 
consist of sales figures, inventory, or financial data, while 
outside sources may include interest rates or economic 
forecasts. DSSs often contain statistical analysis tools, 
spreadsheets, graphics, and scenario-modeling capabilities. 
Executive information systems (EISs) are a special type of 
DSS that present information as charts and tables that show 
trends, ratios, and statistics.
5. Expert system: This is programmed with the knowledge of 
human experts and imitates human reason and decision 
making. Expert systems are composed of two main 
components: a knowledge base and inference rules. These 
rules are a set of logical decision algorithms that are applied 
to the knowledge base whenever a user describes a situation 
to the expert system. This is an example of the use of artificial 
intelligence (AI) and adaptive learning in computers.
Application software used in business makes use of all five of these 
different types of information systems by combining them into 
packages. A common term for this is integrated information systems.

S o f t w a r e  
247
Customer relationship management (CRM) software manages 
information and interactions with customers and prospects. It is used 
primarily across sales, marketing, and customer service departments 
within an enterprise. It tracks correspondence and sales and helps 
companies gain a competitive edge by using analytical tools. An 
important aspect of this software in today’s market is social media 
and interaction with customers on mobile devices.
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software provides a centralized 
and integrated platform for all the major business activities of an 
enterprise. This type of software is customized for different kinds of 
business and often takes years to fully implement. It integrates 
information across all departments, providing a complete view of the 
entire organization for management. Because information is shared 
rapidly, ERP helps manage global operations in real time. The reliance 
on one system rather than many from different vendors allows the IT 
(information technology) department to focus on one type of 
technology. ERP software packages can still be modular, with separate 
solutions for financials, human capital management, sales and service, 
procurement and logistics execution, product development and 
manufacturing, and corporate services. These can be purchased 
separately from the same vendor and integrated into the system as it 
grows. The largest and most well-known vendor for ERP and other 
enterprise application software is SAP.
Content management systems (CMSs) are a combination of 
databases, software, and procedures that organizes and allows access 
to a variety of different kinds of documents and files. It includes 
information about the data and files called metadata. This type of 
information might include revision numbers, a brief summary of the 
file, and the name of the author. The CMS also includes security 
controls that limit access to the file, adding content to the database, or 
modifying its content. Content is added through a GUI or a secure 
portal with a web page. The CMS provides the ability to categorize, 
index, process, and store content within the system.
Material requirements planning (MRP) software helps monitor and 
control processes related to production. It includes inventory 
management and forecasting tools to ensure that materials required 
for manufacturing are available when needed. Basic functions include 
inventory control, BOM processing, and scheduling tools. MRP is 
used to plan and integrate manufacturing, purchasing, and delivery 
activities. Data that is considered in MRP software includes shelf life 
of stored materials, BOMs, how many and when items are required 
for production, materials in stock and on order from vendors, and 
planned production goals. Output from the MRP software 
encompasses the recommended production schedule and the 
recommended purchasing schedule.
Manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) is an extension of material 
requirements planning. It includes elements of MRP but also contains 

248 
C h a p t e r  S i x
tools to track production in real time and monitor product quality. 
Shop floor data collection may be done using manual data entry from 
operators or by integrating machinery control systems with the MRP 
and MRP II software. Likewise, quality control may be a combination 
of periodic product checks with manual data or real-time measurement 
and gauging integrated with production machinery.
Integration of plant floor systems and business enterprise software 
can be a complex task. Production control systems require quick 
response and deterministic processing. Data collection is often done 
within the machine control system itself and may be transferred 
periodically to the enterprise system or it may be performed on a 
continuous basis. Because of the bandwidth requirements of data 
exchange on the plant floor, it is usually best to separate the enterprise 
data collection systems from the control systems. This is often done 
by implementing several layers of communication networks with 
separate ports for each. Figure 6.11 illustrates how a plant network 
might be set up to isolate traffic and provide security for different 
communication layers.
Additional security measures employed in a plant data network 
include password log-in and administration that changes passwords 
periodically and ensures password strength. Communications are 
often encrypted and firewalls employed to prevent hacking. Virus 
protection is commonly provided for every computer on the network. 
Separation of networks as shown in the plant data network can also 
be effective for security. Plant procedures such as prohibiting USB or 
thumb drives can also have some limited effect.
Data historian software is essentially a database that stores 
historical information about processes or machinery. Data may be

updated on change of state of monitored tags, periodic updating of 
monitored process values, or by manual entry by an operator. 
Examples of data that might be stored include total products or total 
defects for a shift or day, current temperature of an oven, maximum 
flow rate of a pump over a period of time, or the reason for a line 
stoppage entered by a maintenance technician.
A batch server is used to help applications develop, schedule, 
manage, and monitor batch jobs as described in the previous TPS 
section (Sec. 6.7). Because batch jobs must often be load-balanced 
across several tasks, they are often placed on their own server in a 
network.
There may be many different servers on a network performing 
different tasks, all communicating with each other simultaneously. 
The load on the network can vary, network traffic tends to peak at 
certain times. Choices of hardware, network layout, and software 
implementation can all have a major effect on network speed and 
efficiency.

CHAPTER 7
Occupations and 
Trades
T
here are quite a few different kinds of employment opportunities 
in the automation field. Manufacturing facilities are becoming 
increasingly more automated to improve production, vendors 
are looking for knowledgeable people to sell their technical products, 
and OEMs employ skilled labor to design, maintain, and build their 
products. System integrators and machine builders hire engineers 
and tradespeople to assist companies in solving their automation 
problems.
7.1 Engineering
Engineering is a discipline that applies scientific knowledge in the 
fields of physics and chemistry, materials, mathematics, and logic to 
solve real-world problems. Engineers use the tools they acquire in the 
study of scientific and mathematical principals to invent, design, and 
create physical solutions to problems.
Creativity is a major factor in the application of science to the 
physical world. The design and development of structures, 
machines, and processes require a full understanding of the 
materials and physics of the components and devices used. Behavior 
of machinery and processes must be forecast under all operating 
conditions. Personnel and equipment safety, the economics of 
designing, building and operating equipment, and ethical practice 
of the engineering profession are important elements in the training 
of engineers.
Licensing requirements vary depending on the engineering 
discipline and its application. Formal designations include the 
Professional Engineer (PE) and Chartered Engineer license. The basic 
requirement for an engineer is the completion of a bachelor of science 
degree from an accredited university.
Engineering disciplines are divided into a number of subfields. 
There are basic math and science classes that all engineers must 
take, including calculus, physics, and chemistry. In addition, most 
251

252 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
engineering courses require a certain amount of cross-training from 
other disciplines as well as general college coursework.
7.1.1 Mechanical
Mechanical engineers design assemblies and systems to accomplish 
automated tasks. They are often hired to supervise a cell of machines 
in a manufacturing plant or upgrade a production line. Their job 
usually includes the use of design and CAD software, both two- and 
three-dimensional. Design processes will often involve timing charts 
to analyze machine movement and the relationships of components 
to each other.
Basic mechanical engineering coursework includes solid 
mechanics, instrumentation and measurement, strength of materials, 
hydraulics and pneumatics, combustion, and product design. 
Mechanical engineers also study fluid flow and thermodynamics. 
Cross-disciplinary 
training 
often 
includes 
some 
computer 
programming, electrical, industrial, and possibly chemical engineering 
classes. Mechanical engineers are often involved with the specification 
of sensors and the effects of temperature or chemicals on different 
materials or manufacturing processes. Specializations include 
robotics, transport and logistics, cryogenics, biomechanics, vibration, 
automotive engineering, and more.
Knowledge of components such as motors, bearings, linear 
actuators, gearing, and various other elements, as described in 
previous chapters, is critical. The ability to specify and size framing 
and piping components and select appropriate material and 
components is an important skill. Mechanical engineers and designers 
rely heavily on manufacturers’ specification sheets and their own 
knowledge of a range of components. Vendor training can also be of 
great value.
7.1.2 Electrical and Controls
Electrical engineers are often involved in systems design and software 
for automation equipment. In manufacturing, they are usually 
involved in modifying code in the systems controller, specifying and 
adding sensors, modifying HMI screens, and adding motor or power 
circuits for line upgrades. In system integration or machine-building 
companies, controls engineers design electrical control panels and 
draw schematics, flowchart, and write control code. When designing 
machines, they work very closely with their mechanical counterparts 
for a fully integrated machine design. They are usually responsible 
for the start-up and debug of machines also.
The curriculum for electrical engineering includes the basic 
science and math coursework described previously. In addition, 
mechanical classes in statics and dynamics, thermodynamics, and 
materials science are usually required. Engineering economics and 
engineering ethics are also generally part of the program. After 

O c c u p a t i o n s  a n d  Tr a d e s  
253
studying general electrical design and concepts, electrical engineers 
usually specialize in a subdiscipline, such as power, electronics, 
digital circuits and microelectronics, optics, controls, plasma 
engineering, communications, or computers.
For OEM equipment, knowledge of IC design can be important. 
Some OEM equipment uses proprietary circuit boards and “System 
on a Chip” components in the design of their equipment. Printed 
circuit board design and layout can be an important element in 
machine control design.
For process systems, electrical and controls engineers need to 
know about power distribution and P&ID diagrams. They also often 
end up in niche fields, becoming specialists in fields like robotics, 
vision, or integrated servo systems. A good foundation in IT skills is 
often important as plants become more integrated between the factory 
floor and production planning and management. Software and 
computer programming is a required skill for all electrical engineering 
disciplines.
Because controls engineers often take the lead in the start-up of 
equipment, they must also have a good mechanical background. 
Pneumatic design and specification are often performed by electrical 
or controls engineers. Motor sizing involves the evaluation of 
mechanical systems and machine dynamics.
7.1.3 Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering
Industrial engineers determine the most effective way to use people, 
equipment, and materials to produce a product. They are often 
involved in planning and efficiency studies of complex systems and 
production procedures. Ergonomics and safety are also areas that 
industrial engineers often have responsibility for. Although not as 
often involved in the functional design of machinery, industrial 
engineers are usually the ones who decide where machines will be 
located in relation to one another for the most efficient process 
flow.
Material movement, flow, and storage are also issues addressed 
by industrial engineers. Processes are often a combination of manual 
and automated procedures that must be analyzed and optimized. 
Industrial engineers are often trained in Six Sigma process 
improvement and other business-oriented disciplines. Operations 
management is one of the underlying concepts behind industrial 
engineering. As such, a good knowledge of commercial enterprise 
computer software and platforms is important. The use of quantitative 
methods and statistics in the analysis of industrial operations is an 
important tool for industrial engineers.
The industrial engineering curriculum includes the essential 
math and science classes required for all engineering disciplines in 
addition to specialized courses in management, systems theory, 
ergonomics, safety, statistics, and economics.

254 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
Manufacturing engineers direct and coordinate processes for 
production. They are involved with the initial concept of how a 
product will be produced through the full implementation of a 
production line. The manufacturing engineering curriculum is very 
similar to that of a mechanical engineer. Manufacturing engineers are 
often formally trained in another discipline, such as industrial or 
mechanical engineering, but are designated manufacturing engineers 
because of the position they occupy in the industry.
The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) provides 
certifications for manufacturing engineers in the United States. 
Candidates for the Certified Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT) 
certificate must have four years of combined education and 
manufacturing-related work experience. A three-hour, 130-question 
exam covering mathematics, manufacturing processes, automation, 
and manufacturing management is administered to qualified 
candidates for the certification. The Certified in Manufacturing 
Engineering (CMfgE) qualification requires eight years of combined 
education and manufacturing-related work experience. A passing 
grade in a three-hour, 150-question exam, which covers more in-
depth topics of the CMfgT, is required for this certification.
SME also provides additional certifications for engineering 
management, Six Sigma, and lean manufacturing. Engineers from 
many different disciplines often obtain these certifications in addition 
to their formal training.
7.1.4 Chemical and Chemical Process Engineers
Chemical engineering involves the design and operation of plants and 
machinery in the chemical- and bulk-processing areas, as well as 
converting raw materials and chemicals into other forms. These 
disciplines are often subdivided into chemical process engineering and 
chemical product engineering. The processing of materials in solid, 
bulk, liquid, and gaseous forms is the focus of process engineering, 
while the individual unit reactions of substances and elements with 
each other for commercial use is the subject of product engineering.
Chemical reaction engineering concerns the management of 
processes and conditions to ensure a safe and predictable chemical 
reaction. Models are used to simulate processes and predict reactor 
performance. Process design involves activities such as drying, 
crystallization, evaporation, and other reactant preparation steps. 
Conversion processes are also designed for nitration, oxidization, 
and other material effects. These involve biochemical, thermochemical, 
and other processes. Transport of materials involves the effects of 
heat transfer, mass transfer, and fluid dynamics as substances or 
compounds are moved from one place to another.
In addition to standard engineering course requirements, chemical 
engineers take various science and engineering courses, including 
physical chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, biochemistry, reactor 

O c c u p a t i o n s  a n d  Tr a d e s  
255
design, reactor kinetics, fluid flow and thermodynamics, statistics, 
instrumentation, and environmental engineering classes. Chemical 
engineers are involved in designing and optimizing processes for 
commercial product production. As such, they need a good background 
in mechanical and electrical disciplines. Process engineering involves 
the application of heating and cooling, pressure and vacuum, bulk 
movement, design of reactor vessels, and piping. P&ID diagrams are 
used to describe the processes in terms of components and fluid flow/
airflow, which chemical engineers are usually familiar with.
In industrial automation, petrochemical-related processing is a 
major employer of chemical engineers—both in the extraction and 
refining fields and in plastics. Biological sciences, waste management 
companies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers also commonly 
hire chemical engineers. Most process-oriented companies, such 
as nonwoven web converting, paper manufacturing, chemical 
compounding, and consumer product manufacturing firms, also 
use chemical engineers for process and product design.
7.1.5 Other Engineering Disciplines and Job Titles
Within most companies that use or implement automation, there are 
usually a variety of job titles associated with engineering. Plant 
managers, for instance, are often from the engineering field, since 
problem solving is an important skill for both job functions.
Quality engineers may come from another engineering discipline 
also, although industrial and systems engineering programs teach 
many of the elements of quality programs. Six Sigma and lean 
manufacturing techniques are used by quality engineers to make 
processes more efficient and reduce defects. Total quality management 
(TQM) is a technique used to continuously improve a product or 
service. The production part approval process (PPAP) is another 
element of quality engineering.
Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering 
that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed 
and managed over the life cycle of a project. Issues such as logistics, 
the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of 
machinery become more difficult when dealing with large, complex 
projects. Systems engineering deals with work processes and tools to 
handle such projects, and it overlaps with both technical and human-
centered disciplines, such as control engineering, industrial 
engineering, organizational studies, and project management. Some 
universities offer advanced degrees in systems engineering. Systems 
engineers are generally employed by large companies or government-
related (DoD, DoE) manufacturers.
Applications
Applications engineers do a lot of the pre-engineering on projects. 
The task of an applications engineer is to come up with a way to 

256 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
perform a given task in the quickest or most cost-effective way. 
Vendors and manufacturers often employ applications engineers to 
support the sales staff and provide value to the buyers of their 
products. They also often perform technical training in this role.
Machine builders and integrators use applications engineers to 
put together quotes for machines and systems. They will often use 
in-house developed tools to estimate costs for parts and labor and 
3-D software to develop layouts and concepts for machines or process 
lines that will be embedded in quote documents.
Applications engineers often spend a lot of time visiting plant 
sites and seeing how things work. They usually have many years of 
experience and often come from a design background.
Sales
Sales engineers are usually employed by vendors and manufacturers 
of automation equipment. They often also act as applications 
engineers, helping customers determine the best application of their 
technical product. Sales engineers often attend factory training on 
their products and can be of immense help to design engineers in 
coming up with the best way to solve a particular problem.
Sales engineers often carry or have access to samples of their 
product, which can be tested or examined by the customer. They also 
may have software demos that can be used to illustrate the application 
of the product. It goes without saying that people skills and good 
written and verbal communication are important parts of a sales 
engineer’s toolbox.
Training programs in sales techniques and sales management are 
available from many third-party companies that specialize in the 
sales training field. There are also many excellent books available. 
Public speaking and communications skills training are also available 
through associations and companies.
Project Engineers
Project engineers usually perform a lead role in the actual 
implementation of an automation project. Not only are they 
responsible for the overall design; they also often have to interface 
with the customer regularly. Mechanical and electrical project 
engineers typically team up to implement a quoted project. As such, 
they are often well versed in each other’s disciplines.
Project engineers usually have experience as a design engineer 
prior to taking project responsibility. They are usually proficient in 
CAD or design software and knowledgeable about many products.
Design Engineers
Design engineers work with CAD software within their discipline to 
create mechanical or electrical schematics for fabrication. They need 
to be adept at their design software platform and able to examine 
designs with a critical eye for possible mistakes. Mechanical design 

O c c u p a t i o n s  a n d  Tr a d e s  
257
engineers usually work with 3-D modeling software to create solid 
models that can be used to simulate machine motions. Drawings are 
often then converted to 2-D printouts of components for fabrication 
or converted to a CNC compatible file, such as G-code or STEP-NC.
Electrical design engineers take design elements, such as 
mechanical layouts, I/O lists, and machine specifications, and convert 
them into electrical schematics. They are also involved in the 
specification and selection of electrical components. Along with 
project engineers, design engineers are responsible for ensuring that 
specifications for an automation project are followed.
Project Managers
Project managers are responsible for adherence to the schedule and 
budget of a contract. While they often come from an engineering 
background, they usually have experience in a business field also. 
Financial spreadsheets and scheduling software are important tools 
of the trade. Interfacing with the customer and generating issues lists, 
working with purchasing for expediting, and keeping management 
apprised of project status are also important project management 
tasks. Project managers often perform supervisory tasks for teams of 
project engineers and act as a liaison between the customer and the 
engineering team.
Project management certification and training often includes 
many of the lean manufacturing and Six Sigma techniques discussed 
later in this book. The Project Management Institute (PMI) administers 
the certification of project managers through training and testing. 
Much of a project manager’s core training information is contained in 
the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), authored by the 
PMI. Certifications for project managers include Project Management 
Professional (PMP), Program Management Professional (PgMP), PMI 
Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP), PMI Risk Management 
Professional (PMI-RMP), and PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP).
7.2 Trades
The physical implementation of automation equipment and machinery 
is usually done by skilled tradespeople with extensive experience in 
their field. Often, people who work on equipment have to make 
“design-on-the-fly” decisions as a machine is being built or modified. 
This requires knowledge and experience in a variety of fields, including 
fabrication techniques, materials, and sensor applications.
7.2.1 Mechanical
Manufacturing and Machining
Machinists and operators of programmable CNC equipment produce 
components for automated machinery. They are usually trained on a 

258 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
variety of equipment, ranging from mills, lathes, and grinders to 
water cutting and sheet metal forming equipment. They work off 
detailed prints or “details” provided in CAD format from engineering. 
In the case of highly automated CNC machinery, they have to be able 
to program the machining center to produce the desired part.
Other titles and job descriptions that are related to machinists 
include tool and die makers, mold makers, pattern makers, and 
others. A person who produces mechanical parts is sometimes 
referred to as a “turner,” while a person who assembles them together 
can be referred to as a “fitter.”
Setup of machining equipment is critical to the precision and 
accuracy of the finished part. Jigging and fixturing contributes to a 
machine staying within the tolerances that a part is designed to fit. If 
parts are not set up and fixtured properly, expensive material can be 
destroyed. Precise measurement of parts using a variety of tools and 
instruments is an important factor in the accurate fabrication of 
parts. The use of tools, such as micrometers, calipers, and coordinate 
measurement machines (CMMs), is an integral part of a machinist’s 
training.
Formal training programs for machinists are usually offered by 
vocational schools and community colleges. Two-year degree 
programs in machine technology focus on theory and technical skills. 
Classes include lathe and milling operations, CNC machining, 
precision measurement, blueprint reading, math, and quality control. 
Trainees often apprentice in machine shops under the supervision of 
skilled machinists. Certifications for machinists include degrees from 
accredited programs and testing from societies, such as the Fabricators 
and Manufacturers Association (www.fmanet.org).
Knowledge of the properties of the materials they are working 
with is essential to a good machinist. Metals, such as steel and 
aluminum, as well as materials such as UHMW, Delrin, or Teflon, all 
have their own associated techniques required to form them as well 
as associated tool speeds. Knowledge of treatments, such as anodizing, 
heat -treating, and forming, is commonly used to shape or change the 
properties of materials.
Assembly
When building machinery, assemblers put together the various 
components of a machine according to a set of prints. Aluminum 
extrusion is often used for guarding—or even for the whole machine—
and knowledge of different types of connections, such as brackets, 
end fasteners, and anchor fasteners, is important. A variety of 
fastening techniques, such as using bolts, screws, dowel pins, or 
welding, is employed to mount parts to the frame of the machine. 
Mechanical actuators and linear or rotary motion components also 
each have their own associated assembly techniques.

O c c u p a t i o n s  a n d  Tr a d e s  
259
Pneumatic and hydraulic plumbing and routing, conveyor 
assembly, and even a machining background can all be helpful skills 
in this field. Assemblers are often also skilled in machine wiring.
When machinery has already been built, millwrights or other 
maintenance personnel generally perform other tasks associated with 
working on automation equipment.
Welding
Machine frames and piping systems are often welded for stability. 
Welding techniques are discussed in depth in Chap. 5. Stick welding 
or SMAW is a technique that cannot be easily automated and is only 
applicable to manual welding. MIG, or wire welding, is also often 
used in manual applications.
Other techniques closely related to welding include plasma 
cutting, brazing, heat control and metallurgy, test methods, and 
safety. nondestructive evaluation (NDE), also known as nondestructive 
testing, is often used on welds to check for lack of fusion of the weld 
to the base metal, cracks or porosity within the weld, and variations 
in weld density. Techniques for testing include X-rays, ultrasonic 
testing, liquid penetrant testing, and eddy current testing. Welders 
should be familiar with these techniques.
Welders often attend training schools and require certification for 
their trade. The American Welding Society (AWS) has certification 
programs for testing procedures used on structural steel, petroleum 
pipelines, sheet metal, and chemical refinery industries. AWS can 
also test to company supplied or noncode welding specifications. 
Certification programs include the Certified Welder Program (CW), 
Certified Welding Engineer Program (CWENG), and Certified 
Welding Inspector Program (CWI). Certification is also available for 
robotic arc welding. Welding is subject to inspections and testing on 
a per-piece basis and costs more if done improperly. Like machinists, 
welders also require a solid background in the properties and behavior 
of metals.
Millwrights
When moving and installing large machinery, millwrights and riggers 
often perform most of the work. Operating equipment like forklifts 
and cranes is an important part of this. Their job requires a thorough 
knowledge of the load-bearing capabilities of the equipment they 
use, as well as an understanding of blueprints and technical 
instructions. Another common name for a millwright is a rigger.
Millwrights must be able to read blueprints and schematic 
drawings to determine work procedures and to construct foundations 
for and to assemble, dismantle, and overhaul machinery and 
equipment. They must be able to use hand and power tools and direct 
workers engaged in such endeavors. The use of lathes, milling 

260 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
machines, and grinders may be required to make customized parts or 
repairs. In the course of work, millwrights are required to move, 
assemble, and install machinery and equipment such as shafting, 
precision 
bearings, 
gearboxes, 
motors, 
mechanical 
clutches, 
conveyors, and tram rails, using hoists, pulleys, dollies, rollers, and 
trucks. Additionally, a millwright may also perform all duties of 
general laborer, pipefitter, carpenter, and electrician. A millwright 
may also perform some of the duties of a welder, such as arc welding, 
MIG welding, and oxyacetylene cutting.
Millwrights are also involved in routine tasks, such as machinery 
lubrication, bearing replacement, seal replacement, cleaning of parts 
during an overhaul, and preventative maintenance.
7.2.2 Electrical
Panel Building
Panel building involves the mounting of electrical components to the 
backplane of a metal enclosure and the wiring of these components. 
Panel layout drawings and schematic diagrams are used to lay out 
the components in a prescribed manner. Adherence to the National 
Electrical Code and customer specifications is a critical part of the 
process. Electrical panels take many different forms and contain a 
variety of different types of components. Elements—from PLCs and 
other controllers to motor starters and servo drives—may be mounted 
in the panel. Voltages from 5 or 24VDC to 480VAC or higher may be 
present in the same enclosure, and great care must be taken to keep 
these separated.
Mounting techniques include riveting, drilling, tapping, and 
cutting or punching holes in the metal enclosure to mount rectangular 
components. Wiring involves labeling of wiring conductors, use of 
ferrules to prevent the splaying or birdcaging of stripped wires, and 
termination of wires and cables to terminal blocks or component 
terminals. Spade and ring terminals are often crimped to the ends of 
wires for termination.
Soldering is an important skill for a panel builder. Wires may be 
attached to circuit boards or plug connectors this way, and a good 
connection is critical.
Routing of wires and cables through wireway— typically plastic 
with “fingers” or tabs to allow routing through the sides—is an 
important wire management element. Ensuring that components are 
mounted straight, labels are legible and in the same direction, and 
wires are formed into neat bends is another important aesthetic part 
of panel building. A panel-building operation in progress is shown in 
Fig. 7.1
Tools used by a panel builder include wire strippers, crimpers, 
screwdrivers, and a host of other hand tools. There are also various 
special-purpose tools, including hole punches, DIN rail shears or 

O c c u p a t i o n s  a n d  Tr a d e s  
261
cutters, and label printers that are specific to wiring and control 
panels.
Panel builders typically learn their craft through experience or 
training programs at some large manufacturers. Unlike with 
machinists, welders, and electricians, there are no formal training 
schools for panel building.
Electricians
The electrician trade involves wiring of buildings, machines, and 
process equipment. This is differentiated from linemen, who work on 
electrical utility distribution systems at higher voltages. Electricians 
often concentrate in three different general categories: residential, 
commercial, and industrial wiring. In the industrial automation and 
manufacturing fields, electricians fall into the industrial grouping. 
Industrial electricians are responsible for facility wiring and 
maintenance and often work on high-voltage distribution bus bars 
mounted on the ceiling. Knowledge of factory power distribution 
systems and switchgear is part of an industrial electrician’s tool kit.
Electricians typically perform the external wiring of machinery. 
They route wiring from the control enclosure to the various motors, 
sensors, and other electrical devices on a machine or line. This wire or 
cable may be run in conduit, emt, cable tray, metal wireway, or even 
directly strapped to the frame of the machine, depending on the 
requirement.
Training for electricians usually involves an apprenticeship under 
the general supervision of a master electrician and the direct 
supervision of a journeyman electrician. Electricians often attend two 
years of vocational school or community college for training in 
electrical theory and the National Electric Code. Electricians are 
FIGURE 7.1 Panel building.

262 
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
usually licensed, but for wiring of machines, this is usually not a 
requirement. Licensing is generally performed in the United States at 
the state level, while enforcement is generally undertaken on a local 
level.
Electricians may often build control panels, but panel building 
and machine wiring are entirely different skills. In an automation 
environment, electricians must also be familiar with pneumatics and 
hydraulics, as they may be the ones who route air hoses and hydraulic 
piping on a machine or production line.
Knowledge of the National Electrical Code, wiring techniques, 
and devices and a familiarity with various hand tools are necessary 
skills for electricians. Wire strippers, cable cutters, and multimeters 
or volt-ohm meters (VOMs) are standard tools for electricians. 
Knowledge of electricity and power distribution, as well as various 
conduit bending and connecting techniques, is important. In addition 
to safety issues associated with working at heights and with power 
tools, electricians must always be aware of the hazards of working 
with electricity.
Instrumentation Technicians
In process control facilities, instrumentation is a key element in the 
monitoring and control of production. Maintenance and calibration 
of devices and troubleshooting of systems is the job of specialized 
technicians well versed in electronic, pneumatic, and hydraulic 
systems. Centralized monitoring of control loops is often accomplished 
with DCSs. Signals are wired to and from this central point from 
widely separated locations. This wiring network often involves 
intermediate control and junction points as well as communication-
network-based I/O.
Local display of pressure and flow is often accomplished with 
mechanical gauges. Some gauges must be placed in-line with the 
process flow, while others are plumbed parallel and may have 
pneumatic tubing or piping interfaces. Mechanical interfacing is 
almost always an element of the instrumentation process.
Technicians must be able to interface with valves and 
instrumentation through SCADA, HMI, or other monitoring software 
to determine the causes of process problems. The ability to read and 
modify P&ID diagrams and electrical schematics are important skills. 
Calibration of instrumentation must be accomplished on a periodic 
schedule and records carefully maintained. Mechanical aptitude is 
also important, as pipefitting and welding can often be required. 
Instrumentation technicians and other process control personnel often 
undergo extensive safety training and usually require certification. 
Training programs are generally available in community colleges, 
vocational schools, and larger process-focused corporations.

CHAPTER 8
Industrial and 
Factory Business 
Systems
T
here are many different types of businesses involved in the 
field of automation in one form or another. Manufacturers and 
OEMs use automation components in the production of goods, 
manufacturers’ representatives and distributors sell automation 
components and devices to OEMs and end users, and machine 
builders and systems integrators use and specify components to 
produce machinery and systems.
Functions within these companies can vary widely depending on 
their size and organization, but they generally fit within the same 
general structure.
8.1 Automation-Related Businesses
There are many different types of businesses that produce or make 
use of automated equipment. Government agencies, such as the 
Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, all use automation equipment. The following is a list 
of broad categories of automation-related businesses.
8.1.1 Manufacturers
The largest users of automated production equipment are 
manufacturers. Manufacturers may produce individual products or 
process materials, as described in the converting section of this book 
(Sec. 5.4). Larger manufacturers may also build their own automation 
equipment since they have developed the expertise within their fields 
over years of experience.
Of course, some manufacturers also produce automation 
components and devices themselves. A list of some of these 
manufacturers is included in the back of this book (Appendix E).
263

264 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
8.1.2 OEMs
OEMs are manufacturers that produce machinery or equipment of 
their own. These may include standard products, such as appliances 
or automobiles, which include automation components. Standard or 
niche automation-related products made by OEMs include vibratory 
bowls, torque drivers, compressors, cam indexers, web-processing 
equipment, testers, ovens, and many other system components.
Many OEMs build standard products that are controlled by PLC 
or DCS. Examples of these are building HVAC and environmental 
controls, food-processing machinery, and packaging machines. 
Others may control their product with embedded processors or 
“systems on a chip.”
8.1.3 Manufacturers’ Representatives
Manufacturers’ representatives serve as a regional sales and technical 
resource for automation component and device manufacturers. They 
often handle multiple products and call on both end users and 
distributors. They provide product demonstrations, training, and 
seminars. Typically a manufacturers’ representative’s income is a 
percentage of all products sold within his or her territory. For some 
specialized products, such as instrumentation, the representative 
may sell directly to the end user.
Manufacturers’ representatives are often used by smaller 
companies that cannot afford to have a full-time salesperson within a 
territory. In this case, the representative is expected to prospect and 
follow up leads within his or her area. Other representatives may work 
directly for the manufacturer and cover a large geographical area. In 
this case, they often evaluate applications and perform training.
8.1.4 Distributors
Distributors sell products directly to end users. They usually fall into 
general categories, such as fluid power, electrical, or industrial 
supplies. Often distributors have branch offices over a region or 
nationwide. A distributor with a physical location who keeps product 
on the shelf is known as a stocking distributor.
Most distributors do not have exclusive rights to a product within 
a geographic area but compete with other distributors. Exceptions to 
this are Allen-Bradley and Siemens, who generally only allow one 
distributor in each territory. In exchange for this exclusivity, they 
attempt to control pricing and require the distributor to employ a 
technical support staff.
8.1.5 Machine Builders
Machine builders are different from OEMs in that they build 
machinery customized for a specific purpose. Although they 
sometimes specialize within a field, such as material handling or 

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
265
inspection and gauging, they will often take on any project they feel 
comfortable executing.
Machine-building companies can vary in size from four or five 
people building small machines to large firms with hundreds, or even 
thousands, of employees spread over multiple locations. Larger 
machine builders house various departments, as described in Sec. 8.2.
Machine shops often branch out into machine building. They 
may form a relationship with a systems integrator or controls 
company to design and build machines.
8.1.6 Systems Integrators
Systems integrators take separate systems and combine them into a 
functioning entity that operates as a whole. They are usually oriented 
around controls and IT but often have mechanical capabilities or 
partnerships with machine builders.
A company that does programming and/or panel building is 
often referred to as a “controls house.” These companies are typically 
fairly small and do systems integration also. An example of systems 
integration on a small scale would be integrating test equipment, 
such as leak testers or gauging systems to a machine control system. 
This usually involves displaying results from the test and overall 
machine status on a touch screen.
Larger integrators often focus on specific industries, such as 
wastewater, environmental control, or chemical processing. Others 
may take on any type of job above a certain dollar figure. Closely 
related to systems integration companies are engineering firms. These 
companies usually perform some systems integration tasks and 
subcontract others. They usually employ professional engineers that 
can stamp or certify documents for large projects.
8.1.7 Consultants
Consultants are often used to provide expertise in a specific area of a 
project. They may have expertise in business enterprise systems, 
lean/Six Sigma, or a technical specialty, such as vision, data 
acquisition, or software. They may charge by the hour or week, or 
they can be kept on a retainer.
8.2 Departments and Functions
Business organizations usually have three basic functional areas: 
operations, finance, and marketing. Automation and manufacturing 
activities fall within the area of operations, which is responsible for 
producing goods and services for consumers.
Most of the companies involved in the industrial and automation 
fields are incorporated businesses with a variety of departments. 
Companies may be public (owned by stockholders) or privately held.

266 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
The functions of the departments may differ depending on the 
size and type of business. Larger companies and corporations tend to 
have more layers of management. A business with fewer layers of 
management is said to have a “flatter” organizational structure. Some 
large conglomerates separate business activities into completely 
independent organizations, each with its own structure. Manufacturing 
plants and product divisions are often organized this way, with little 
day-to-day interaction with a corporate headquarters on operational 
issues.
8.2.1 Management
There may be various layers of management, depending on the size 
of the organization. Usually there will be a single executive-level 
president or CEO (chief executive officer) with final decision-making 
authority. If the organization is large enough, there will be various 
layers of management below this in charge of each department or 
function. Titles for these may range from vice president to director or 
manager. Managers at the VP level are likely to be specialists in 
several areas. Managers at the CEO, president, and vice president 
levels are often referred to as upper management.
Below the upper-management level is middle management. 
This includes plant managers and department heads. For larger

organizations, this second tier of management may operate in 
geographically different locations. Large manufacturers often have 
plants in different states or countries with management reporting to 
a headquarters. These functions may be fairly autonomous, requiring 
little oversight. Plant managers often have final decision-making 
authority on personnel and capital projects up to a certain cost.
Department heads have responsibility for such areas as production, 
maintenance, quality, personnel, accounting, and marketing. They may 
report to both the plant management of their facility and to the vice 
president of their functional area.
Lower management is responsible for direct supervision of 
production and maintenance workers. Job titles include line 
supervisors, foremen, or lead. Managers in this position have 
extensive experience in their craft or on the production equipment 
they supervise. They are often promoted from within the ranks of 
experienced machine operators.
8.2.2 Sales and Marketing
All businesses need ongoing efforts to present their products or 
services to customers. The vice president of sales generally leads this 
department for larger companies and may have several department 
heads under his or her supervision.
Marketing 
materials 
may 
include 
television 
and 
radio 
advertisements, printed brochures or flyers, and social network 
marketing campaigns. An Internet presence is an important part of 
marketing. Web sites provide information about a company’s 
products and services and must be maintained and updated after 
they are established.
Sales efforts may involve outside salespeople who call directly on 
customers. Outside sales personnel demonstrate products, provide 
information, and maintain a relationship between companies. They 
also seek out new customers and follow up on sales leads. For highly 
technical products or systems, they often must have an engineering 
background or degree. Inside salespeople take orders from customers 
online or by phone. In some cases, they may assist outside sales with 
prospecting or customer research. Applications and technical support 
staff members help solve customer problems and answer product-
related questions. Training seminars and classes are used to familiarize 
customers with company products and improve the perception of the 
product.
8.2.3 Engineering and Design
For businesses involved in manufacturing, the engineering 
department is responsible for product design, making changes to the 
product, ordering and installing new production equipment, and 
generally taking care of technical changes related to machinery. The 
department usually falls under a vice president of engineering or 

268 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
engineering manager, depending on the size of the company. Product 
or design engineers are responsible for the creation of drawings for 
the products themselves as well as tooling used in the manufacturing 
process.
Process-control-based 
companies 
also 
often 
have 
large 
engineering departments that design and install their own 
equipment. Since much of this equipment is customized to the 
process, it is often more cost-effective to modify a process internally. 
Many of the products used in process control are commercially 
available or easily outsourced to vendors, such as reactors and 
pressure vessels. Design engineers in these departments often design 
components and piping in a modular manner and then contract 
fabrication and installation services.
Within the organizational framework, there is also often a research 
and development (R&D) department or team that may operate under 
a separate VP. The R&D process involves design and testing of new 
products or modifications to existing ones. They may also design new 
machinery and processes to produce things in a different way. 
Whereas some research and development endeavors are focused on 
the development of products, others may attempt to discover new 
knowledge of scientific and technical topics to uncover opportunities 
for products and services that do not yet exist.
The PPAP is a standard used mainly in the automotive industry 
to ensure that component parts are made in a consistent manner and 
meet the user’s needs. As part of this process, the design, manufacture, 
and testing techniques of a manufacturer are examined and 
documented. There are 18 elements within this process, extending 
from the initial design through qualification of production machinery 
and sample production parts. Two of these steps involve a standardized 
tool called failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).
The design FMEA (DFMEA) evaluates the potential causes of 
failure within a part on a per-component basis. It identifies causes, 
establishes severity levels, and relates them to other components. As 
potential problems are identified, this gives designers an opportunity 
to correct problems. A process FMEA (PFMEA) considers the same 
elements in the manufacturing process. The PFMEA follows the steps 
defined in the process flow and determines the effects of failures in 
machinery and worst-case consequences for products, equipment, 
and personnel. This evaluation is of special concern to machine 
builders as they must comply with results of the analysis.
8.2.4 Maintenance
The maintenance department takes care of the equipment and 
facilities. Also known as maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), 
personnel in this department are responsible for mechanical, 
plumbing, or electrical repair of the building and production 
equipment within it. The maintenance department is usually a 

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
269
subdepartment under manufacturing. Facilities and equipment 
maintenance may be organized into different departments.
Routine maintenance activities are separated into scheduled 
maintenance and preventive maintenance. Scheduled maintenance 
includes activities that keep equipment in working order by replacing 
worn devices and assemblies before they fail. Preventive maintenance 
involves activities such as lubrication, cleaning, and other actions 
that prevent age-related equipment breakdowns. Shutdowns are 
often held annually or semiannually to accomplish major repairs or 
upgrades; installations are also common during these periods. 
Machine breakdowns (unscheduled maintenance or repair) and 
upgrades must also be handled as required.
MRO software can be useful in managing scheduled maintenance 
activities. This tool can help increase system availability and uptime, 
track machine BOMs, and schedule routine maintenance tasks. It also 
creates a record of activities that can be useful for production. MRO 
software tracks component data, such as “as designed,” “as built,” 
“as maintained,” and “as used.” It can be used to manage repair 
inventory, store serial numbers, keep track of warranty and guarantee 
documents, and track machinery service history. MRO software is 
often integrated with other enterprise business software.
Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a program for improving 
machine availability. Equipment and tools are put on proactive 
maintenance schedules that involve operators in the maintenance of 
machinery. An aggressive maintenance schedule will include 
“deterioration prevention” techniques that identify issues as soon as 
possible and attempts to prevent problems from occurring. With 
added operator involvement, maintenance technicians are liberated 
from mundane maintenance tasks and enabled to focus on urgent 
repairs and proactive maintenance activities. TPM techniques rely on 
the 5S system used in lean manufacturing.
8.2.5 Manufacturing and Production
In a manufacturing company, most of the personnel are in the 
production department, which is usually under the control of a vice 
president of manufacturing, who generally reports to the CEO. When 
facilities are located in multiple geographic locations, plant managers 
usually report to the VP of manufacturing. Other subdepartments in 
the manufacturing sector include production control and scheduling, 
shipping and receiving, tool design, maintenance, and various 
industrial engineering functions.
Manufacturing engineers are often placed in charge of the 
installation, operation, and improvement of production lines. As 
such, they spend a lot of time on the factory floor evaluating machinery 
and production efficiency. They are often also involved in the 
supervision of production activities. Production supervisors oversee 
the stocking of raw materials and components required for the 

270 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
manufacture of products. They also interface with maintenance in 
ensuring that equipment is kept in safe working order.
Production employees often operate production machinery that 
can be quite sophisticated. Consequently, they are often trained in the 
care and maintenance of machinery and systems. Machine operators 
may be responsible for the upkeep of their assigned machine. Since 
they spend most of their working hours with the machine, they often 
get to know its quirks better than maintenance or even the company 
that initially built the machine.
8.2.6 Finance and Human Resources
The finance department includes purchasing, payables, receivables, 
payroll, and accounting. These are often separated into subdepartments, 
which report to a VP of finance or a comptroller who oversees accounting 
activities and auditing of company finances.
Purchasing directors or managers are responsible for the 
acquisition of goods and services. One of the jobs of the purchasing 
department is to obtain goods at the most advantageous terms to the 
company. This requires negotiation skills on the part of the buyer. 
Some products have a standard pricing arrangement that is 
nonnegotiable, but machinery and contracts are often sent out for 
bid. Evaluation of proposals and offered services are part of a buyer’s 
skill set. Some purchasing agents set up “blanket” or “master” 
agreements for longer-term consumables in order to reduce the 
administrative costs of repetitive orders, also requiring negotiation.
Organizations often use a checks and balances system to ensure 
that the system remains ethical, often having different acquisition 
activities report to different senior managers. Departments involved 
in the buying process can include purchasing or buying, receiving, 
engineering, accounts payable, or plant management. As a two-way 
check if purchasing orders are issued, accounts payable will often 
process the invoice independently, checking with the requisitioner to 
ensure they received their order.
Accounts receivable is responsible for billing a company’s 
customers for products sold and delivered. Accounts payable pays 
vendors for goods and services purchased. These functions often fall 
within the purchasing department but, as mentioned previously, may 
report to different supervisors. Payroll is a function that falls within 
the realm of finance but interfaces with human resources.
The purchasing department issues purchase orders to vendors 
for raw materials, components, machinery, and other items. Technical 
items are usually selected by engineering or maintenance staff; the 
vendor for these items, however, may be selected by purchasing. This 
can cause problems if the vendor has provided a service in the 
expectation of receiving an order.
The human resources department is responsible for the well-
being of the company’s employees. They handle employee benefits, 

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
271
such as health insurance and 401k and benefit plans. Attracting new 
employees, selecting and assessing them, and sometimes terminating 
employment are all duties of the human resource management (HRM 
or HR) department. The department is usually under the supervision 
of a VP-level personnel director.
Training usually also falls under the direction of HR. Employee 
training and education through the company may be handled internally 
or outsourced, depending on the subject matter. Companies also 
sometimes outsource human resource functions or use consultants. 
The human resources department is also usually responsible for labor 
relations in unionized plants. Collective bargaining agreements are 
negotiated between the union and the HR department.
The human resources department often administers employee 
benefit plans or payroll. These programs may be outsourced or run 
by specialists within the organization. HR is also often involved in 
the mergers and acquisitions process.
8.2.7 Quality
The quality department is responsible for the output of the company 
product in terms of individual product conformance to standards, 
quantity of scrap material, and efficiency of the process. Quality can 
be defined in various ways, depending on the product, but one way 
to think of it is the degree to which performance of a product or 
service meets or exceeds customer expectations. Quality control and 
quality assurance are usually placed under the direction of a vice 
president of quality. This department often has decision-making 
responsibility that supersedes that of the manufacturing and 
production departments.
A quality management system (QMS) is an organizational 
structure containing procedures, processes, and resources to 
implement quality management. Historically, quality control involved 
finding the defects in manufacturing before they left the factory. The 
methodology has changed extensively in the past 50 years or so 
because of implementation of standards and competition from foreign 
and domestic manufacturers. Personnel within the quality department 
are expected to be well trained in modern quality techniques and 
often specialize in specific areas.
Standards
There are many quality management techniques that have been 
developed and formalized for manufacturing. Standards such as 
ISO 9000 require that companies are audited for compliance 
periodically. ISO 9001 certification requires that a company is 
committed to the methods and model defined within the standard. 
This means that procedures for manufacturing and quality control 
have to be developed, documented, and followed, which requires 
time, money, and paperwork. This, in turn, can lead to fairly large 

272 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
quality departments within corporations that are required by 
customers to be certified. ISO 9000 standards include system 
requirements, management requirements, resource requirements, 
realization of requirements, and remedial requirements.
Another standard that companies often must comply with is 
ISO 14000. This standard concerns what an organization does to 
minimize harmful effects to the environment caused by its operations. 
The standard focuses on three major areas: management systems, 
operations, and environmental systems. Certification for this standard 
also falls within the domain of the quality department.
Total Quality Management
TQM is a philosophy that involves everyone in the organization in an 
effort to improve quality. There are many programs and techniques 
that have evolved from this philosophy that directly impact business 
operations and methods. There are a number of TQM practices that 
are identified within a wide variety of resources, including training 
courses and books. These practices include continuous improvement, 
involving everyone in the organization, and meeting or exceeding 
customer expectations. Cross-functional product design, process 
management, supplier quality management, strategic planning, and 
cross-functional training are also elements of the TQM philosophy.
The TQM concept was originally developed in the United States 
in the mid-1900s by several management consultants but was not 
widely accepted. The philosophy was adopted by Japanese 
automakers in the 1980s, and a number of new concepts were added. 
Among many other Japanese terms, kaizen—a Japanese term that 
means continuous improvement—made its way into the terminology 
of quality management as the philosophy evolved.
Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a business management strategy originally developed by 
Motorola in 1986. As of 2013, it is widely used in many industrial 
sectors. Statistically, Six Sigma means that there will be no more than 
3.4 defects per million opportunities in a manufacturing process. 
From a quality perspective, the term refers to improving the quality 
of process outputs. Six Sigma achieves this goal by identifying and 
removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in 
manufacturing and business processes.
Six Sigma uses a project methodology called DMAIC, an acronym 
for Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control—a method used for 
improving existing business processes. In each step of DMAIC are 
several tools that can be used to achieve the next step of the 
methodology. Another tool used for creating new product or process 
designs is Define-Measure-Analyze-Design-Verify (DMADV)—also 
known as Design for Six Sigma (DFSS). Statistical tools used in the Six 
Sigma methodology include histograms, Pareto charts, regression 
analyses, scatter diagrams, run charts, and analyses of variance.

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
273
Six Sigma creates a special infrastructure of people within the 
organization composed of Master Black Belts, Black Belts, and Green 
Belts who are experts in these methods. Executive management is a 
critical component of an effective Six Sigma project, and “buy-in” at 
this level is a necessity. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an 
organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified 
financial targets (cost reduction and/or profit increase).
8.2.8 Information Technology
The IT department takes care of the company computer systems 
related to both hardware and software. It spans a wide variety of 
areas that include computer software, information systems, computer 
hardware, databases, security, and training. Depending on the size 
and structure of a company, the manager of the IT department may 
be at a VP level (VP of information technology or chief information 
officer [CIO]) or at a network administrator level.
IT provides businesses with several types of service that help 
execute business strategy. The department maintains business 
enterprise, office, and CAD software, including associated databases 
and security. It maintains and improves existing network and hardware 
systems, and it is often necessary for IT personnel to write programs 
and software utilities to integrate existing software and databases.
Security is an important part of a company computer network. 
The IT department is responsible for developing and enforcing 
policies to safeguard data and information from unauthorized users. 
Virus software, firewalls, and password control are all part of an IT 
professional’s domain.
IT also maintains multimedia equipment for companies. Phone 
systems are often tied into a company’s computer network. Larger 
companies use computers to answer and route telephone calls, process 
orders, update inventory, and manage accounting, purchasing, and 
payroll activities. Training on computer software and systems within 
an organization is also often the responsibility of IT personnel.
8.3 Lean Manufacturing
Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived from the 
Toyota Production System. It is focused on the elimination of waste in 
various forms from the production process. The Toyota Production 
System originally identified seven different types of waste, or 
Muda—a Japanese term meaning uselessness, futility, or wastefulness. 
The seven wastes describe resources that are often wasted in the 
manufacturing process:
1. Transportation: Every time a product is moved in a process it 
adds time. It also runs a risk of being lost, damaged, or 
delayed, and it does not add any value to the product that is 
being transported.

274 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
2. Inventory: Raw materials, works in progress (WIPs), and 
completed products represent capital outlay that is producing 
no income. If items are not being actively processed, they are 
considered to be wasting time and capital.
3. Motion: Excess motion of machinery contributes to wear on 
equipment, while excess movement of operators can 
contribute to repetitive stress injuries. Motion also increases 
the possibility of accidents that can damage equipment or 
injure personnel.
4. Waiting: If a product is not being processed, it is waiting—
wasting both time and space. Most products spend most of 
their lifetime in a manufacturing plant waiting.
5. Overprocessing: Anytime more work or operations are 
performed on a product than is necessary, it is considered to 
be overprocessed. This includes tools that are more precise or 
expensive than required or machinery that is overly 
complex.
6. Overproduction: When more goods are produced than is 
required by existing orders from customers, the product is 
overproduced. Creating large batches of product often creates 
this condition since customer needs can change while product 
is being made. Many consider this to be the worst from of 
waste since it can hide and generate the other forms of Muda. 
Overproduction leads to excess inventory, more storage 
space, and additional movement of product.
7. Defects: Extra cost is incurred in handling the part, wasted 
material, rescheduling of production, and extra transportation 
of defects.
Lean manufacturing uses a number of tools in identifying and 
eliminating waste. The application of the lean methodology is often 
paired with that of Six Sigma and used within the management, 
manufacturing, and quality departments. This gives rise to the term 
Lean Six Sigma as an approach to business and manufacturing. The 
two systems can be used together to complement and reinforce each 
other as a strategy to make systems more efficient.
One of the basic tenets of the Toyota Production System and lean 
philosophies is that of just-in-time (JIT). This is an operation system 
where materials are moved through a system and are delivered with 
precise timing just as they are needed. This reduces in-process 
inventory and the associated carrying costs. To accomplish this, 
information about the process must be monitored carefully to ensure 
that product flows smoothly.
Another Japanese term used in the Toyota Production System 
is Mura, which means “unevenness” or “irregularity.” Leveling 
production and eliminating waste through the application of the 

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
275
proper techniques should lead to a smooth and predictable workflow. 
Mura is avoided by applying JIT techniques properly.
A third Japanese term describing waste is the word Muri, meaning 
“unreasonableness” or “impossible beyond one’s power.” Another 
way to describe Muri is the overburdening of machinery or personnel. 
Examples of Muri are workers performing dangerous tasks or 
working at a pace beyond their physical limits. The concept also 
applies to machinery and running a system or production line beyond 
its designed capabilities.
8.3.1 Kanban and “Pull”
To meet the objectives of JIT, one of the techniques used is Kanban. 
This is a manual system that uses signals between different points in 
the manufacturing process. Kanban applies to both deliveries to the 
factory and to individual workstations. The signal may consist of 
cards or tickets that indicate the status of a bin or storage area or 
simply an empty bin. These act as a trigger to replace the bin with a 
full one and order new parts.
Electronic methods of Kanban are sometimes used within 
enterprise software systems. Triggers in this case may be manual or 
automatic. If stock of a particular component is depleted by the 
amount of the Kanban card, electronic signaling can be used to 
generate a purchase order with a predefined quantity to a vendor. 
Arrangements are made with the vendor to ensure that material is 
delivered within a defined lead time at a specified price. The result of 
a successful Kanban system is the delivery of a steady stream of 
containers of parts throughout the workday. Each container usually 
holds a small supply of parts or materials, and empty containers are 
replaced by full ones. An example of the implementation of Kanban 
might be a three-bin system, where one bin is on the factory floor in 
use, one bin is in the storeroom, and a third bin is always ready at the 
supplier’s location. When the bin being used has been consumed, it is 
sent with its Kanban card to the supplier. The bin is replaced on the 
factory floor with the bin from the storeroom. The supplier then 
delivers a full bin to the factory storeroom, completing the loop.
To track Kanban cards, a visual scheduling tool called a Heijunka 
Box is sometimes used. This is a rack or series of boxes placed on a 
wall to hold Kanban cards. A row for each component is labeled with 
the name of the component or product. Columns are used to represent 
time intervals of production. Cards are often made in different colors 
to make it easier to identify the status of upcoming production runs. 
Heijunka is a Japanese term meaning production smoothing. It 
originates from the Toyota Production System and the concept that 
production flow will vary naturally and that the capacity of machinery 
and personnel will be forced or overburdened at certain times (Muri).
In supply chain management, one of the concepts that drives 
production is “push” versus “pull.” In a push strategy, product is 

276 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
pushed toward the consumer. Forecasting of customer demand is 
used to predict how much of a product will be needed. This can lead 
to excess or insufficient inventory since there is always inaccuracy in 
forecasting. In a pull strategy, production is based on consumer 
demand and response to specific orders. Material or parts are replaced 
on demand, and only what is needed is produced.
This does not mean that products must be made to order to satisfy 
JIT and the pull system. A limited inventory is often kept on hand or 
in process and is replenished as it is consumed. A Kanban system is a 
means to this end.
8.3.2 Kaizen
Continuous improvement, or kaizen, is a major element of the TQM 
system and is used in manufacturing, engineering, and business 
management. It involves all employees of a company, from the CEO 
to production workers. By improving and standardizing processes, 
waste is eliminated, achieving the goals of lean methodology.
Kaizen is a daily process that teaches employees to apply a 
scientific method to the identification and elimination of waste. It can 
be applied individually, but often small groups are formed to look at 
specific applications or work areas. The group may be guided by a 
line supervisor but may also be assisted or led by people trained in 
Six Sigma techniques.
Kaizen events are often organized as a weeklong activity to 
address a specific issue. They are sometimes referred to as a “Kaizen 
Blitz.” They are generally very limited in scope and involve all

277
personnel involved in the process. Results from a kaizen event are 
often used in later events after careful evaluation.
A kaizen cycle can be divided into several steps. The first is to 
standardize an operation or its activities—in other words, ensuring 
that a system is in place in the beginning. The next step is to measure 
the operation using whatever measurement is appropriate. Examples 
include cycle time, waste material, in-process inventory, or defective 
parts. These measurements are then compared to the design 
requirements of the operation. Innovations and improvements can 
then be applied to the process and, hopefully, improve productivity. 
In turn, the results of this cycle become the new standard, which is 
used as the basis for the next kaizen, and the cycle repeats.
Another name for this cycle is PDCA—an acronym for Plan-Do-
Check-Act or Plan-Do-Check-Adjust. The planning stage is used to 
establish the objectives and processes necessary to achieve the desired 
results. Doing involves implementing the plan, executing the process, 
or making the product. Data collection about the process is also 
performed during this step. The checking stage studies the results 
gathered during the previous step. Comparing the results to what 
was expected is made easier by charting the data and making it easier 
to spot trends. The acting or adjusting stage is used to apply corrective 
actions to the process. The PDCA cycle predates kaizen by many 
years and has its roots in the origination of the scientific method 
hundreds of years ago.
8.3.3 Poka-Yoke
Safeguards that are built into a process in order to reduce the 
possibility of making an error are referred to in lean manufacturing 
by the Japanese term poka-yoke. This error-proofing technique is used 
to prevent, correct, or draw attention to mistakes as they occur.
The originator of the term was a Japanese industrial engineer 
named Shigeo Shingo who acted as a consultant to Toyota in the 
1960s and 1970s. Shingo believed that errors were inevitable in any 
manufacturing process, but if mistakes were detected or prevented 
before products were shipped, the cost of these mistakes to the 
company would be reduced. Detecting a mistake as it is being made 
is known as a warning poka-yoke, while preventing the mistake is 
called a control poka-yoke.
Three types of poka-yoke are recognized as methods of detecting 
and preventing errors in a production system. The contact method 
tests a product’s shape, color, size, weight, or other physical property. 
This method is often implemented in automated processes by using 
sensors and test stations. The fixed-value, or constant number, method 
alerts the operator if a number of movements have not been made. 
The motion-step, or sequence, method determines whether the required 
steps in a sequence have been followed. In automation, this method 
is performed by creating a fault in a system when a step is either not 

278 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
completed within a prescribed time or if an actuator does not complete 
its movement correctly.
In manual assembly, there are several techniques that are used to 
error-proof assemblies. Pick-to-light systems use signals to guide 
operators through the correct assembly process by blinking a light at 
the correct bin location for the component that is to be installed. 
Sensors are used to detect whether a part was removed from the 
proper location and/or installed correctly. Manual tools, such as 
torque drivers, can be used to ensure that the proper angle and torque 
are achieved when installing screws. Carefully shaped fixturing and 
tooling are used to prevent parts from being placed incorrectly, and 
embedded sensors validate placement.
Ideally, mistakes are detected as they occur. Production lines often 
have test stations at several points in the process to eliminate further 
processing of reject parts. Test devices, such as gauges, leak testers, 
machine vision, and weighing systems, are used to flag parts or mark 
them for removal. Reject bins or reject spurs are equipped with 
sensors or identification systems to ensure parts do not proceed 
through production.
8.3.4 Tools and Terms
Lean manufacturing tools have been developed over years of 
refinement to improve the efficiency of production. In addition to the 
techniques of Kanban, kaizen, and poka-yoke, other methods to aid 
in the organization of the workplace and analysis of data have been 
adopted by many manufacturers.
Standardized work instructions (SWI) allow processes to be 
completed in a consistent, timely, and repeatable manner. This 
technique involves testing work processes in order to determine the 
most efficient and accurate way to accomplish a task. Work instructions 
are created using photos, simple text, and diagrams to clearly indicate 
what an operator is to do. Employees often want to do things their 
own ways, but developing the most appropriate method to accomplish 
a task is a critical element of process improvement. Workers should 
be encouraged to challenge the instructions and help make 
FIGURE 8.3 
Pick-to-light.

279
improvements, but consistency is reinforced when everyone is 
completing tasks in the “current best way.”
The 5S system creates a workplace that is clean, organized, and free 
of materials not needed for production. The 5S system, sometimes called 
the “visual workplace” or “visual factory,” is a housekeeping tool with 
five behaviors intended to make the workplace more effective.
Sort
1. 
: Decide which items are needed to accomplish the task 
and remove all others.
Straighten/Set in Order
2. 
: Organize the items in a work area so 
that they can be accessed quickly. Make a place for everything, 
and put everything in its place.
Sweep/Shine
3. 
: Clean and inspect everything in the work area. 
Perform equipment and tool maintenance regularly.
Standardize
4. 
: Use standard procedures and instructions for all 
work. Use discipline and structure to maintain consistency.
Sustain/Self-Discipline
5. 
: Continue to maintain the 5S efforts 
through auditing and documentation. Ensure that employees 
understand company expectations and the need for an 
uncluttered and organized workplace.
Value stream mapping (VSM) is used to design and analyze the 
flow of products or information between key work processes. This 
technique is used to differentiate value adding activities from non-
value-adding ones and reduce waste. Software tools and templates 
are available for accomplishing this task, but VSM is often performed 
by teams drawing diagrams by hand. Shigeo Shingo suggested that 
value-added steps be drawn horizontally across the center of a page 
and non-value-added steps represented by vertical lines at right 
angles to the value stream. Shingo referred to the value-added steps 
as the process and the “waste” steps as operations. Separating the 
steps allows them to be evaluated using different methods; VSM 
often leads to the discovery of hidden waste activities.
OEE is used to monitor and improve the effectiveness of 
manufacturing processes. It is described in terms of its application to 
machinery in Sec. 2.9.
Statistical process control (SPC) refers to the application of 
statistical tools to the monitoring and control of a process in order to 
ensure it operates at full potential. The goal of a process is generally 
to produce as much conforming product as possible with a minimum 
of waste. Inspection methods detect defective product after it is 
made, while SPC emphasizes early detection and prevention of 
problems. SPC is not only used to detect waste; it can reduce the time 
that it takes to produce a product. It is used to identify bottlenecks in 
a process, waiting times, and sources of delay. SPC can be used on 
any process where the output of conforming product (product 
meeting specifications) can be measured.

280 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
SPC monitors a process by using control charts. Control charts use 
objective criteria to distinguish background variation (“noise”) from 
significant events. The first step in SPC is to map the process, breaking 
it down into individual steps. This can be done using a flowchart or a 
list of subprocesses. Typical variables identified during the process 
mapping step include downtime, defects, delays, and cost. The next 
step is to measure sources of variation using control charts. A common 
type of control chart is a line chart. The line chart is used to correlate 
measurements over time or a number of samples.
By adding an average line to the line chart, a run chart is generated. 
A run chart shows the variations of the process from the average over 
time. Adding upper control limits (UCL) and lower control limits 
(LCL) creates a control chart.
The type of data that is being collected determines the type of 
control chart to use. Attribute control charts include p charts, np 
charts, c charts, and u charts. Types of variable control charts include 
Xbar-R charts, Xbar-s charts, moving average and moving range 
charts, individual charts, and run charts. Descriptions and further 
treatment of these can be found in SPC books or online.
Control charts provide a graphical method of viewing when a 
process exceeds control limits, but there are many rules that must 
be applied to the statistical results to determine whether a process 
is stable or not. If none of the various detection triggers occurs, the 
process is determined to be stable. If a process is found to be 
unstable other tools, such as Ishikawa diagrams, designed 
experiments, and Pareto charts, can be used to identify sources of 
excessive variation. Ishikawa diagrams, also known as fishbone or 
herringbone diagrams, are line drawings that show the causes of a

specific event. Causes are usually grouped into categories such as 
people, 
methods, 
machines, 
materials, 
measurement, 
and 
environment, which are then further subdivided into potential 
factors contributing to error.
8.4 Systemization
The information and discussion in this section of the chapter is solely 
the opinion of the author after observation of the working methods 
used in various companies.
The tools discussed in this chapter are just that: tools. Like any 
tool they can be misapplied and misused. Tools do not perform any 
work themselves; they have to be applied by people. Therein lies the 
problem: everyone does things differently. One of the key elements of 
implementing a successful business, project, or machine is 
systemization. This can be described as a method of ensuring that 
things are done the same “current best way” every time.
With all the tools and resources available, it is sometimes easy 
to arrive at “analysis paralysis,” where a great deal of time is spent 
determining which solution or solutions to apply to a problem, but 
no solution is ever applied. A systematic method of choosing a 
solution involves careful analysis of the problem, establishing a 
deadline for selecting a method, and application of the solution 
based on a criteria such as most appropriate, least time-consuming, 
lowest cost, simplest, and so on. It is important not to implement 
multiple solutions that may be at cross-purposes with each other. 
Many lean manufacturing and Six Sigma experts are very 
experienced in selecting the appropriate solution; bringing in

outside help for defining and solving company problems can be a 
wise investment.
Even if the correct tools are used, incorrect inputs can lead to 
errors in output. There is an acronym for this used in the computer 
industry, GIGO, or “garbage in, garbage out.” This not only applies to 
programs and algorithms; it also applies in the business world. As an 
example, when discussing a problem with involved personnel, their 
opinion can be colored by relationships with other people also 
involved. An unbiased opinion can be hard to obtain, and direct 
observation of operations is usually the preferred method. Ideally all 
information used as input to solve a problem should be quantifiable.
8.4.1 Job and Task Descriptions
The SWI described in the previous section apply to processes typically 
found in the manufacturing environment. They are often represented 
by pictures of activities and numbered, written descriptions of how a 
specific task is to be done. This same method can be applied to nearly 
any job function in the workplace, although it may not be necessary 
to post them in a public location as you might see on a factory floor.
All too often the most basic of job descriptions do not exist in 
many businesses. Employees are hired as “manufacturing engineers,” 
“buyers,” “sales,” or “maintenance,” as if these functions are the 
same in every business. This can lead to disappointment and 
frustration when jobs are not performed as expected.
Ideally job and job function descriptions should be provided to 
employees before the first day of work. This provides a list of 
expectations and general functional descriptions for each position in 
a company. This should be a “living” document that is updated on a 
regular basis as job functions evolve, which they generally do over 
time. The document should start with a general overall description of 
the position, the title of the person filling the position, where in the 
overall management hierarchy the position falls, and the names of 
employees that relate with the person in this position on a regular 
basis. This gives new employees a sense of belonging within the 
overall organization and within their department.
After the general description of the position, an outline of the 
functions within that job should be listed. This can be broken down 
into as many levels as necessary; again this should be an evolving 
document. The statement “it’s not my job” should never occur within 
an organization that has a properly documented list of job function 
descriptions. As conflicts appear as to where a particular function 
falls within an organizational map, the issue should be documented 
for discussion at the next job function meeting. Of course, until the 
conflict is resolved someone still has to perform the task.
Job function meetings should be held at least on a monthly basis 
initially. They can be informal and last as little time as necessary, but 
they should never be put off or ignored. Input should be gathered 

I n d u s t r i a l  a n d  F a c t o r y  B u s i n e s s  S y s t e m s  
283
from every person possibly affected by a change in function; members 
attending the meeting should include at a minimum immediate 
supervisors of the position being discussed; department heads should 
also be involved if possible.
Feedback from employees should be a part of the process. In the 
initial stages of documenting a job and its functions, it may take 
several kaizen-type meetings to produce a satisfactory initial 
document. As the document is fleshed out, the process can be done 
on a more periodic basis and with less involvement by nonaffected 
personnel. Since the description falls under the “current best way” 
category, efforts should be made to keep the document as accurate as 
possible.
8.4.2 Communications
As part of daily activities in the workplace people engage in many 
different forms of communication. Verbal, electronic, printed, or 
handwritten and even nonverbal methods are commonly used. 
Choice of the proper method of communications is a critical part of 
the business process.
Meetings are a major component of most business methods. They 
are intended to be a method of two-way communications between 
individuals or groups of people. All too often they end up being more 
of a one-way method, where a presenter provides information to a 
group of people without much feedback. This type of meeting is often 
more appropriately done through a written method for two important 
reasons. The first reason is that meetings take more time than reading 
a presentation. They are also less flexible in terms of timing; they are 
scheduled for a specific time during which everyone must stop what 
they are doing and attend. So the first disadvantage is that of time.
The second reason applies to more than just meetings: verbal 
presentations are often not documented. Sometimes an outline is 
presented to attendees; people may even take notes. The problem here 
is that there is no guarantee that the important information was received 
and understood by all attendees in the same way. This reemphasizes the 
importance of clear, written communications in business.
Meetings can serve an important function: when two-way 
communications are needed between individuals or groups, they are 
the most efficient way to exchange information or come to an 
agreement. Even here it is important to document them with written 
communications so that there is not later disagreement over what 
actually took place. Most people in larger organizations would agree 
that too much of their time is taken up by meetings. One way to 
reduce the number of meetings is to determine whether they can be 
replaced with written forms of communication.
Conversations between individuals should also often be 
documented by written communications. If an important decision or 
instruction is not documented, there may be disagreements later as to 

284 
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
what was actually said. The statements “you never told me” or “that’s 
not what I/you said” should never be made if proper communication 
methods are chosen. With the development of technologies such as 
personal communication devices able to send texts or e-mails, there is 
simply no excuse for miscommunication or misinterpretation. 
Especially for project-based work, documented communication 
between coworkers and vendors/customers is critical.
8.4.3 Hiring and Training
The hiring process often includes rigorous analysis of a prospective 
employee’s experience and skill set, suitability for a position, and ability 
to “fit in” with an organization. Candidates are often interviewed by 
multiple people, including (hopefully) peers familiar with the person’s 
field of expertise. If an employee is being hired for a position that 
requires specific skills, testing of the candidate should be part of the 
process. Examples in the technical field might be generating CAD 
drawings, writing a short program, fabricating a part, or troubleshooting 
a machine. Decisions on whether a candidate for a position is to be hired 
are usually based on various factors, including personality, experience, 
skills, and compensation requirements.
Even with all this careful examination of a candidate, there is a 
variety of skills that will likely not match exactly. Every company has a 
different method of accomplishing tasks, and new employees often need 
guidelines or training to completely mesh with their new organization.
If the job and task descriptions described in Sec. 8.4.1 are detailed 
enough they can serve as an important training tool. Examples of 
previous work or projects can also be a useful element in the training 
process. If an employee with a similar job function is available, he or 
she may also be assigned to help with the orientation process.
Even with all these internal resources, sometimes outside help 
must be obtained to facilitate the training process. Vendors such as 
distributors’ and manufacturers’ representatives can be an excellent 
resource for product-specific training. They will often provide “lunch 
and learn” activities in order to help promote their products. Trade 
shows also often provide hands-on training on many products.
Skills such as CAD/CAM and lean manufacturing techniques are 
often taught by independent companies and consultants. Establishing 
a budget for employee training can be a wise investment for a 
company provided employee retention is high. Training programs 
are often administered by the human resources department.
A common problem is balancing training with retention of 
employees. Companies often hire personnel at a relatively low pay 
rate with the intent of training them into a position, only to find that 
once the employee’s skills have increased, he or she has become more 
marketable and goes to find a higher-paying job. It is important that 
companies stay competitive in the job market while still controlling 
their own bottom line.

8.4.4 Engineering and Project Notebooks
An important tool often used by inventors, engineers, and designers 
is the engineering or project notebook. The intent is to capture vital 
details of the engineering process and create an ongoing record of the 
project. Observations, ideas, and even meeting notes help provide a 
timeline for the project. Formal engineering notebooks are often used 
as a permanent record of a project accessible by all members; these 
are usually bound books (so that all pages are accounted for), written 
in ink (pencil and erasable ink are not acceptable), with all entries 
dated and signed. There are often formal methods of making 
corrections (no Wite-Out, a single line drawn through errors), and 
they may even contain signatures of team members who attended 
project meetings.
While formal engineering notebooks may be used in large 
companies and engineering firms, they are not common in factories 
and industrial plants. Perhaps people believe that they take too much 
time to maintain or they have simply never heard of them.
I have created a notebook for every project I have ever been 
involved with. While breaking nearly every rule listed above (mine 
are usually written in pencil, I use loose-leaf binders, and I do not 
sign anything or expect others to), I still find them very useful. I have 
often gone back to a project notebook to review how I solved a 
particular problem or wrote a piece of code.
In addition, I use a different notebook to keep records and ideas 
in that do not fall into a particular project. My project notebooks are 
always available for other team members or employees to look at, but 
my personal notebook contains scheduling information, random 
thoughts, and even passwords for the various web sites and 
unimportant accounts I am signed up for. In some ways it is a hybrid 
journal and life-project notebook.
As mentioned earlier in this section, I am a big believer in written 
communications and records. Many times I have visited a plant to 
evaluate a project only to find that there is insufficient information on 
a machine or system to be able to properly estimate the time it would 
take to solve the problem. Documentation is the primary and most 
important tool used in troubleshooting. This not only applies to the 
formal documentation that is supplied with a manufactured system, 
but also to the maintenance records and notes that operators and 
technicians keep on the equipment. For the cost of some paper and a 
little bit of time, it is possible to save thousands of dollars by simply 
recording the events in a system’s history.
This can also be extended to the business world. By keeping 
written documentation of daily events, it is much less likely that tasks 
will be forgotten. There are various electronic devices such as personal 
data assistants (PDAs), laptops, iPads, or even cell phones that can 
aid in this task, but I personally still prefer the handwritten method.

CHAPTER 9
Machine and 
System Design
This chapter describes the typical cycle of machine quoting, 
procurement, design, fabrication, debug, and installation.
After a recent improvement in the business forecast, the ACME 
Widget Company has discovered that they will need a new widget 
line within the year. Mark, a company project engineer, has been 
tasked with finding appropriate vendors for the equipment and 
getting the line installed and started up for production.
9.1 Requirements
Mark’s first task is to define the requirements for the new production 
line. A meeting is held with the engineering manager, production 
supervisor, quality manager, maintenance manager, and process 
manager. The company’s vice president of operations and comptroller 
are also present.
The forecast for the next few years’ production is that about 
100,000 widgets per year will be required for the first couple of years 
ramping up to between 150,000 and 200,000 per year for the next few 
years after that. In addition, a slightly larger widget has been designed 
that will be put into production next year. This brings the total number 
of different kinds of widgets produced by ACME up to seven.
9.1.1 Speed
ACME currently works two eight-hour shifts a day. The current two 
production lines produce about 70,000 widgets per year, the bulk 
coming off a newer line installed about five years ago. This line 
produced about 42,000 widgets last year but was down for 
maintenance, repair, or setup/changeover about 20 percent of the 
available time.
The total days worked excluding weekends, holidays, and 
schedule shutdowns are 48 weeks multiplied by 5 days per week, or 
240 days per year. This comes out to 3840 hours per year of available 
production time. If the total downtime of 768 hours is subtracted, this 
287

288 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
leaves 3072 hours of actual production time. Since 42,000 widgets 
came off line B in 3072 hours, this means the line averages about 13.67 
widgets per hour.
The production supervisor says he is sure that the line was 
specified at 16 widgets an hour and had achieved 18 during the 
initial runoff. After some quick calculations, the quality manager 
determines that the line is running at about 85 percent efficiency 
(13.67/16 x 100% = 85%), discounting maintenance, repair, and 
changeover. Since the ACME company has an active Six Sigma/
lean manufacturing program, the quality manager notes that this 
would be a good subject for a kaizen improvement project to reduce 
downtime.
After more discussion, it is decided that the specification for the 
line speed will be set at 18 widgets per hour. If the line efficiency can 
be raised to 90 percent, this should allow for (3840 hours x 18 widgets/
hour) x .9 efficiency = 62,208 widgets. This should easily accomplish 
the initial target of 100,000 per year but will leave the capacity short 
after about 1.5 to 2 years if the forecast is accurate.
9.1.2 Improvements
The production supervisor and maintenance manager believe that if 
some of the current pneumatic actuators were replaced with servos 
setup time would be reduced by up to 50 percent. Since setup time is 
estimated to be about 40 percent of the total downtime, this could be 
a significant improvement. In addition, several problem areas on the 
current line seem to cause most of the downtime.
The quality manager asks if data is collected to help determine the 
cause of line stoppages. The production supervisor states that data 
had been collected during several periods over the lifetime of the 
production line but not recently because of manpower constraints.
The engineering manager mentions that it would not be terribly 
expensive to implement a data collection system using the existing 
PLC on the line. In addition, the information could be collected into a 
production PC located on the factory floor.
Mark has been noting all these comments during the meeting. He 
asks the VP of operations and comptroller if a budget has been 
determined for the project.
9.1.3 Cost
The comptroller has a report from the implementation of the line five 
years ago. The line had taken a full year to build and install from start 
to finish. It had cost in the neighborhood of $2 million, including 
facilities improvements, in-house labor, and payments to vendors. At 
that time there had been a much larger engineering department and 
much of the system design and layout had been done internally, 
including implementation of the packaging system.

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
289
The VP of operations says that he thought they would have about 
$2.4 million available for this project, but that Mark would not have 
much access to internal labor. He mentions that he thought he could 
think of a few areas where costs could be reduced and would get 
together with Mark and the engineering manager the next day to 
discuss some of these ideas.
9.1.4 Requirements Documentation
Mark uses the company template to begin generating a requirements 
document for the new widget line. Many of the items, such as electrical 
and mechanical specifications, have already been included in the 
template, so Mark starts by making a list of the requirements specific 
to this project. Information such as the line speed capability, packaging 
requirements, footprint or space requirement, and dimensions of the 
widget, including the new product, are included. Much of this 
information has to be collected from different departments within the 
company.
Mark also knows that per company requirements he will need to 
get a minimum of three quotes from machine builders and integrators. 
Because of this, the requirements documentation needs to be very 
complete to minimize questions.
9.2 Quoting
Mark knows of several machine builders both locally and nationally 
that are appropriate for building the new widget line. The company 
that built line B five years ago is from pretty far away but had done a 
decent job on the previous line. They were very large, however, and 
not always as responsive as he would have liked.
Another company had recently made a few sales calls on both 
Mark and the engineering manager, trying to drum up new business. 
They were from the same city as ACME and had left some brochures 
with Mark describing some of the jobs they had done. The brochure 
looked very professional and had some nice pictures of some pretty 
impressive-looking machines, but nothing looked very similar to 
what this line would look like.
There are two other large machine builder/integrators that Mark 
knows can build the line, again both very far away. After going online 
and checking out their web sites, Mark decides to send quote requests 
to LineX, the company that had built line B; LocalTech, the company 
that had called on them recently; and the Mammoth Corp, one of the 
two large national machine builder/integration companies.
9.2.1 Quote Request
Mark writes up a fairly brief quote request with a description of the 
proposed line, a picture and description of the widget, and a statement 

290 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
that further information, details, and specifications would be sent if 
the company would be interested in quoting the line. He e-mails the 
request to all three companies and begins further refining the 
requirements document.
Later the same day, Mark receives a call from Bill, the applications 
and sales engineer from LocalTech. Bill asks if he could stop in the 
next day and take a look at the existing Line B. Mark replies that 
tomorrow would be fine and that he would have the requirements 
finished by then so that Bill could take them with him.
The next morning Mark receives another call from Jack, the sales 
rep for LineX. Jack says that he will be in town early next week and 
he would like to stop in and meet with Mark at his convenience. Mark 
says sure and puts Jack on the schedule.
When Bill arrives, Mark has him fill out a standard nondisclosure 
agreement with the receptionist. He then takes him out onto the plant 
floor, first picking up a set of safety glasses and earplugs. Mark and 
Bill spend about two hours watching the line run and discussing the 
operations. Bill asks several questions about hardware, sequencing, 
and when the order might be expected to be placed. Bill also takes 
quite a few notes as he examines the line. Mark gives him a copy of 
the requirements documentation, including a machine specification. 
Bill says it will probably be the end of next week before he can work 
up a quotation. Mark also gives Bill a sample of a widget directly off 
the line for Bill to take with him.
The following week Jack arrives. Mark discusses the previous 
line’s operation and mentions the slow response of LineX to several 
machine issues over the past few years. Jack explains that LineX has 
undergone a reorganization and that they now have a separate service 
department and are much more responsive. Mark gives Jack the 
requirements documentation and a sample widget to aid in his 
quoting process.
Since Mark has not heard anything from the Mammoth Corp, he 
gives their sales department a call. He is connected to the regional 
applications engineer, Steve, who explains that they have been 
inundated with quote requests and would not be able to make it out 
to look at the application for a couple of weeks. They set up a meeting 
for Thursday a couple of weeks later.
By the time Steve makes it out to ACME, Mark has already 
received quotations from the other two companies. Steve says he 
should be able to turn a quote around in a week or so, but that 
deliveries are running a bit long currently.
9.2.2 Quote Analysis
Two weeks later a meeting is set up with the same members as the 
kickoff meeting to discuss the quotations. The Mammoth Corp barely 
got their quote in on the evening before the meeting, making Mark 
worry about the comment Steve had made concerning long delivery.

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
291
The Mammoth Corp provided the most detailed and comprehensive 
of the three quotes. Much of it appeared to be boilerplate, but it was 
obvious that they had done their homework. It was accompanied by a 
nice cover letter and 3-D renderings of what the finished system would 
look like. It was also the most expensive of the three quotations at about 
$2.2 million.
LineX provided a detailed quote also with pictures of line B and 
detailed descriptions of machine operation. Improvements to the 
new line were also described, including an innovative part-flipping 
mechanism. The quote was the lowest price of the three companies at 
a bit over $1.7 million. Since the previous line had cost almost $1.6 
million, this seemed quite reasonable with the proposed improvements. 
Of course, having built the previous line, it was expected that LineX 
would be the least expensive of the three.
LocalTech’s quotation came in at just under $2 million. Like the 
Mammoth Corp, the quotation included 3-D solid models of the line. 
Details were also broken out into sections proposing improvements 
to both the original line and the new one.
It was obvious that LocalTech was very hungry for the job; 
emphasis on the local support was evident in the quotation. Assurance 
that they had the expertise required for the application was also 
written into the proposal.
9.2.3 The Decision
After weighing all the factors, it was decided that a purchase order 
would be issued to LocalTech. Although the pricing was higher than 
that of LineX, it was agreed that the local support could be valuable 
in the long run. Mark had called several of LocalTech’s references and 
it was generally agreed that LocalTech stood behind their work and 
really went the extra mile for the customer.
Mark drafted a statement of work (SOW) that effectively restated 
the items in the quote request and set out the tasks and expectations 
of both the vendor and customer.
9.3 Procurement
Mark called Bill from LocalTech with the good news that they had 
decided to use them to build the new line. Bill stopped by later that 
afternoon with his engineering manager, Jim, to discuss the procedures 
that would be used to manage the project. During the discussion, the 
conversation got around to payment terms and Bill mentioned that 
there might be a bit of a problem.…
9.3.1 Terms
LocalTech’s requested terms were 40 percent down payment with 
order, 40 percent prior to shipment, and 20 percent net 60 days after 
delivery, or 40/40/20. ACME had a standard policy of 30 percent 

292 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
down, 30 percent after receipt of 90 percent of materials, 30 percent 
after FAT and prior to shipment, and 10 percent net 90 days after 
successful SAT. After a phone meeting was held between ACME’s 
buyer and the owner of LocalTech, it was agreed to abide by ACME’s 
terms. A clause was written into the purchase order that the second 
30 percent would be paid no longer than 120 days after initial parts 
requisitioning by LocalTech to help with cash flow.
A purchase order was faxed to LocalTech two days after the 
meeting and mailed one day later. LocalTech sent an invoice to ACME, 
and payment was received 57 days after that.
9.4 Design
A project kickoff meeting was held at LocalTech to discuss the 
application. Bill and Jim described the project, and the quotation was 
presented to the project team. LocalTech had two project managers 
that managed the budget and schedule for machines and systems; 
Paul was assigned to manage this project. He reviewed the quotation 
documents and generated a Gantt chart using Microsoft Project for 
distribution to the project members.
9.4.1 Mechanical
Joe was assigned as the mechanical lead on the project. There were 
three mechanical project engineers at LocalTech and it was fortunate 
that Joe’s previous project was winding down since he had built a 
line very similar at his previous job. Joe asked if any documentation 
from the previous line B would be available to leverage for the project. 
Bill said he did not think that Mark from ACME would feel comfortable 
giving them any solid models or CAD files since LineX had bid on the 
line but had not gotten the job. Everyone agreed that that would 
probably not be an ethical thing to do.
The first thing Joe had to do, however, was read the specifications. 
After asking a few questions about hardware choice restrictions, he 
was ready to start work on the design.
Joe first generated a timing and device chart using his template. 
This was a Microsoft Excel template that was used by applications, 
mechanical, controls, and software departments jointly to determine 
machine timing, pneumatic sizing, and the actuators to be used on 
the machine.
The next step in the design process was to start designing machine 
assemblies. An assembly is a grouping of components to accomplish 
a specific task. It may consist of a simple actuator or something as 
complex as a multiaxis pick-and-place with mixed electrical and 
pneumatic cylinders. Though this could be decided arbitrarily by the 
mechanical designer, LocalTech had a standard procedure for 
deciding what would make up an assembly.

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
293
Joe decided that a Stelron chassis would be used for the movement 
of widgets around the machine. Widgets would be fed from a 
vibratory feeder or bowl onto a pallet on one corner of the chassis via 
a two-axis pneumatic pick-and-place with gripper. After proceeding 
clockwise around the chassis through various assembly and inspection 
stations, widgets would be removed at the adjacent corner after 
moving across three sides of the chassis. Empty pallets then rotated 
around to be loaded again.
Since the process would be mostly synchronous, some of the 
actuators would be moved by the chassis itself. Those that were not 
had to be dimensioned and sized to determine their capability and 
suitability.
Mechanical Drawing
All LocalTech’s designs were done in SolidWorks, a 3-D solid 
modeling program. Joe had worked on this platform for over 10 years 
and was quite comfortable with it; in fact he had generated the solid 
model representations of the line concept for Bill.
Joe decided to spend a day or so downloading files from vendors 
for the chassis, actuators, and other purchased components that 
would be used on the system. There were four additional mechanical 
designers at LocalTech for a total of seven mechanical licenses, or 
“seats.” The designers acted as a resource pool for the mechanical 
department, filling in where necessary for the project engineers. After 
Joe had spent some time assembling a list of proposed components 
(preliminary bill of materials), he gave part of the list to a designer 
and downloaded the rest himself.
Most of the vendors for the major components had step files, a 
generic file format that worked across solid modeling platforms, 
available for their hardware. A few had only AutoCAD files in three 
views; these would have to be turned into solid models.
With the help of the mechanical designer, it took about three 
weeks to get all the individual assemblies modeled.
Finite Element and Stress Analysis
After drawing all the assemblies and floating them above the chassis 
locations, Joe entered the estimated weights and dimensions of 
hardware into a spreadsheet and did some analysis on the expected 
stresses that would be incurred by the mechanisms, bracketry, and 
framing of the main machine. Joe had a finite element method (FEM) 
software package that allowed detailed visualization of where 
structures would bend or twist. This allowed him to produce stiffness 
and strength calculations that would help minimize and optimize 
weight, materials, and costs throughout the machine.
Framing and Bracketry
With the FEM analysis done, the mechanical team was able to attach 
all the assembly models to the chassis. As with any design, various 

294 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
interference points were found and brackets and locations had to be 
modified. One of the advantages of using a chassis was that locations 
were fixed; if there was not enough space for an assembly, one could 
simply ensure that the required space was available by leaving empty 
pallet stations. In one case a mechanically linked station had to be 
moved over one spot; the chassis was requoted by Stelron with no 
change in price.
Joe decided that most of the framing and brackets would be made 
of welded cold-rolled steel. Of course, this had to be painted, but it 
was typically the least expensive option. An exception was the 
mounting for the vision system: Joe decided to use aluminum 
extrusion since the camera needed to be adjustable. A few of the 
sensor mounts were made of aluminum plate since load requirements 
were not high, the brackets were small, and they did not need to be 
painted.
Joe also decided to use aluminum extrusion for the guarding on 
the upper frame of the machine. This way it would be easy to make 
doors and mount hinges and switches; also it was much easier to 
correct mistakes that might be overlooked during the design process.
Detailing
After a mechanical design review with the customer, Joe and his 
mechanical designer started detailing the individual components of 
the machine for manufacturing. This involved breaking the assemblies 
down into their individual parts again and dimensioning, tolerancing, 
and specifying finish and materials on two-dimensional drawings. 
Some of this data could be put into a CNC machine directly, but much 
of it would be made the old-fashioned way by machinists on mills 
and lathes.
Much of the hardware was detailed here also; bolt and screw sizes 
and plate thicknesses were determined to generate the final BOM. 
Plate and tubing thicknesses sometimes had to be ordered oversize 
because of the skimming of material during the machining process.
Instructions for the machinists were also placed on the detail 
drawings, things like which pieces to stress relieve and whether 
assemblies had to be machined again after welding. This was 
especially important for some of the machine pads that needed to 
hold brackets completely parallel.
9.4.2 Electrical and Controls
Gordon had been at the initial project kickoff meeting and had also 
read the specifications. Most of his controls hardware brands were 
pretty well spelled out in the specifications and requirements 
documentation, so nothing looked particularly difficult. ACME was 
pretty heavily specced on Allen-Bradley controls. The original 
controller had been an SLC 5/05. Most of what was being used in the 
industrial world nowadays was of the ControlLogix family. Gordon 

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
295
gave Mark from ACME a call and asked if it would be OK to use 
ControlLogix.
Mark did not know offhand, but after a quick call to Jake, the 
controls tech on the plant floor, he had his answer. ACME did have 
Allen-Bradley ControlLogix processors in the plant, but since they 
had not renewed their license, they were about two revisions back on 
their software. Gordon assured him that would be OK since he had 
revision 17 on his laptop.
Gordon had met with Joe early in the design process to help him 
tweak the timing and device chart. They had agreed on the names 
they would use for the actuators and sensors, and Joe had done a lot 
of the sizing of the pneumatic cylinders already. The first thing 
Gordon started working on was the I/O list, which would dictate the 
layout of the controls.
One of the improvements LocalTech had proposed was using 
networked I/O on the machine to save space. They had used DeviceNet 
and ControlNet on quite a few projects, but Ethernet I/P-based I/O 
was very cost-effective and would be used on this system.
Since there were a couple of external systems, including a bowl 
feeder, vision system, and two packaging machines, to be integrated, 
networking and distributing the I/O made a lot of sense. The vision 
system was to be a Cognex Insight smart camera, which already had 
Ethernet I/P connectivity and a host of examples on their web site. 
There was no controller on the vibratory bowl, but the sensors were 
to be paralleled into a local node for data acquisition.
After calling the vendors for the two packaging machines, it was 
discovered that one was an Allen-Bradley SLC 5/05, so Ethernet I/P 
would be no problem. The other was a Siemens S7 Controller with 
PROFIBUS capability but no Ethernet I/P. The interface between the 
controllers could be digitally “bit-banged,” where inputs of one 
controller are connected to outputs from the other and vice versa, or 
a ProfiBus card was available from ProSoft for the ControlLogix 
rack. After weighing the cost, speed requirements, and integration 
time into the equation, Gordon decided on the digital “bit-bang” 
approach.
Gordon finished his I/O list and started a simple single-line 
diagram to show power supplied to the various components of the 
system. Since there were a couple of 480VAC motors on the conveyors 
and packaging systems, he drew a three-phase 480V line and placed a 
box indicating each conveyor and the packaging machine underneath. 
There were quite a few 120VAC devices, including the PLC, vibratory 
bowl, DC power supply, and a computer utility port, so he decided to 
use a single-phase transformer to supply this power internally.
For safety all sensors were to be 24VDC so he placed a single line 
of 24 V power under the 120VAC row. For all the boxes placed under 
these lines, he placed approximate fuse sizes to get an idea of the total 
current draw of the system.

296 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
Like Joe, Gordon had a couple of electrical designers he used to 
generate his actual electrical drawings. After a meeting where he 
provided a designer his I/O list and single lines and described the 
system, he began to consider his programming task.
After a couple of weeks the designer had generated a fairly 
complete set of drawings for review. Gordon used a red pen to “red-
line” corrections onto the drawings, the designer made the changes, 
and the drawing package was ready to review with the customer.
9.4.3 Software and Integration
LocalTech was a small company, so controls project engineers did 
double duty on electrical design and software programming. This of 
course kept Gordon and other controls engineers quite busy, but 
everyone took up slack for each other to make schedule.
Flowcharting
While the designer was drawing schematics, Gordon started making 
flowcharts for his programming. As with most of the design functions 
at LocalTech, there was a template for this. Microsoft Visio was used 
to draw logical statements and flow similarly to any computer 
program. Although PLCs did not operate in quite as linear a fashion 
as the usual Fortran, Basic, or C programs since scanning was 
involved, the techniques used were much the same.
Automatic Code Generation
Another time-saving technique LocalTech used in program design 
was a spreadsheet-based tool. On the I/O spreadsheet where all the 
I/O assignments were made, there were a number of Excel macros 
written to generate AutoCAD descriptions for the designers and 
tags for the PLC and HMI. In addition to the I/Os, a column was 
dedicated to defining what kind of device the I/O point belonged 
to. Photo-eyes and proxes, push buttons, solenoids, motors, and 
even servo components were designated, and internal program 
permissives, HMI buttons and indicators, and even fault tags were 
generated.
LocalTech could program quite a few different types of controller, 
both PLC based and others, but one of the advantages of using Allen-
Bradley’s ControlLogix platform was that the usually graphical 
ladder logic could be programmed mnemonically. This meant that 
text statements could be used to generate an L5K program that could 
then be viewed graphically. The macros in the program would 
generate actual ladder logic rungs with tags in the correct locations 
and subroutines. This saved a tremendous amount of time since 
many of the I/O rung subroutines as well as faults and data 
acquisition/OEE subroutines and rungs were generated automatically. 
A generic PLC program template was then opened and all these 
routines copied into it.

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
297
Coding
Auto sequence subroutines and other nonstandardized logic still had 
to be created the old-fashioned way, but the flowcharts were quite 
helpful there. It always helps to plan the code out structurally first. 
By the time the electrical design review was held with the customer, 
Gordon had made a good start on his coding.
Gordon preferred to use numerical values for sequence states. Bit 
of DINT and State Logic techniques were often used by his peers at 
other machine builders and integrators, but since Gordon had been at 
LocalTech the longest of all the controls engineers, he was able to 
institute this as a standard.
Each sequence was contained in its own subroutine called by the 
station routine. The line was logically divided into zones and stations 
agreed on with his mechanical counterpart, Joe.
The HMI
HMI tags were also generated by the spreadsheet and imported into 
the program software. An Allen-Bradley Panelview Plus HMI was 
used for the ACME line; sometimes customers wanted the extra 
capability of an actual computer for the system, but it was not required 
for this application.
By the time Gordon got to the HMI part of his programming and 
design, Joe had created a number of renderings of the entire line and 
some of its stations. Joe was able to easily export these as .dxf files. 
Gordon opened them in his AutoCAD program, then re-exported 
them as bitmaps to Microsoft Paint so that he could simplify them. 
He then imported his bitmaps into the HMI program.
As with the PLC program, there was an HMI template. It had a 
main screen; a couple of sample station screens; screens representing 
PLC I/O, OEE, and data production screens; standard servo screens; 
and faceplates. This gave the programmer a good jump on creating 
the application.
Integration
There were several external systems to the main line. The vibratory 
bowl fed a conveyor, which fed the chassis; the chassis fed its output 
to a conveyor, which passed through a packaging system including a 
case erector and filler. The Cognex vision system also had to be tied 
into the system and triggered and timed with a reject mechanism for 
failed widgets.
Meetings had been held with the packaging machine and 
vibratory bowl manufacturers when purchase orders had been placed 
by LocalTech. Gordon had received quite a bit of preliminary 
information from these vendors, but final drawings would not be 
completed until shortly before delivery.
LocalTech had a close relationship with a local machine vision 
consultant who specialized in Cognex. An order had been placed 

298 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
based on the number of hours Bill had thought the project might take 
to be set up. Gordon also had experience with Cognex vision, so after 
the system was initially set up, he could take responsibility and 
maintain it.
9.5 Fabrication
As parts started arriving from the vendors after being ordered by the 
design teams, they were stored on shelves next to the assigned 
assembly area. At any given time LocalTech generally had several 
projects under way, and it was important to place parts and assemblies 
in a common location so they could be easily located.
9.5.1 Structural
Much of the main structure of the line was supported by the chassis 
and conveyors, but a welded frame was needed at the two ends of the 
chassis to mount a pick-and-place assembly. The frames were welded 
together in an area off the machine shop and then finished in the CNC 
machine.
Most of the brackets that provided station structure were done in 
the same way. The frame was then stress relieved using a vibratory 
stress relief unit, and the bracketry was done in an oven. The pieces 
were then masked and sent out to be painted since LocalTech did not 
have a paint shop. When they arrived back at the receiving dock, they 
were immediately tagged and brought to assembly.
9.5.2 Mechanical
Many of the other mechanical assemblies were simply made in the 
machine shop, and most were to be bolted together. As with the 
structural pieces, when they were completed, they were tagged and 
brought out to the assembly area.
Several pieces were very tightly toleranced and had to be verified 
on the new CMM. In tolerance parts were brought out to the floor, 
while out of tolerance parts were either reworked or remade.
9.5.3 Electrical
After the schematic drawings had final approval from Gordon and 
ACME, the panel shop was given the released drawings. Components 
had been arriving for more than a week, but there were still not 
enough to warrant starting the panel-building process. Gordon gave 
the vendor a call and found that they were still waiting for a connector 
for a servo drive before they could ship complete. Gordon knew the 
electrical guys were eager to get started, so he told the controls vendor 
to go ahead and ship what he had.
Since most of the parts had arrived, the backplane was laid on a 
couple of sawhorses and a pencil was used to carefully mark where 

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
299
the DIN rail, wireway, and major components would be mounted. 
Holes were drilled and tapped for components and through drilled 
for the rivet-mounted wireway. All the major elements were then 
mounted to the painted steel backplane to be wired.
LocalTech had an employee who had done all the panel wiring 
since the company had started. There were several electricians who 
wired and plumbed machines, but all panel wiring was left to Mieko 
since her wiring was beautiful to behold. Since she had small fingers 
and an eye for symmetry and distance, she was well known as a 
fastidious and fast worker.
Larger AC wiring was used for all the 480VAC elements. This was 
color-coded brown, orange, and yellow so that phases could be 
identified easily. AC wiring was then done in red and white and DC 
wiring in blue and white-striped blue wire. All wiring was routed 
through wireway and made neat 90° turns, adhesive wraparound 
labels were consistently located about 1/8 in from terminal blocks, 
and care was taken to ensure different voltage levels were not routed 
together.
9.5.4 Assembly
The chassis had been on the assembly floor for a couple of weeks 
before the frames and structural components were delivered from the 
paint shop. The assembly crew had put together several of the 
subassemblies and stations on worktables, and now they could start 
putting together the whole machine.
The electrical enclosure was a low double door cabinet that 
mounted to the frame at the entry to the chassis. Holes were punched 
in the cabinet before mounting it to the frame, and the fully wired 
backplane was bolted inside.
After all the major stations and assemblies were mounted to the 
frame and chassis, the guarding structure was attached to the top of 
the machine. Lexan panels and doors were inserted, and much of the 
main chassis was complete.
The conveyors had arrived at about the same time as the vibratory 
bowl and chassis, but the packaging machines were running a bit 
late on delivery. Gordon and Joe had attended runoffs at both 
manufacturers and had found a number of items that did not meet 
ACME’s specifications. While the manufacturers had agreed to fix 
most of the issues, a few would have to be handled by LocalTech.
Conveyors and auxiliary machinery were placed into position, 
and a laser transit was used to locate and level components to each 
other. Machinery was then lagged to the floor and the rest of the 
guarding put in place tying the production line elements together.
The electricians and Mieko began wiring the sensors, valve banks, 
and other components back to the main panel. Plastic wireway was 
mounted to the framework of the machine and guarding to provide 
convenient routing for cables and hoses. Quick disconnect cables 

300 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
were used in various spots, so that the machine could be easily 
disassembled and shipped later.
9.6 Start-Up and Debug
The original Gantt chart Paul had created showed that the project was 
about two weeks behind schedule. After discussing the options, it was 
decided that the team would try and make up the time during the start-
up phase by working some later hours and Saturdays. This was a fairly 
common occurrence in the machine-building industry, and several of 
the team members appreciated the extra hours on their paychecks.
Assembly was finally ready to turn the machine over for start-up, 
and the project team was assembled on the assembly floor for a safety 
briefing. Gordon and Joe handed out a list of potential safety hazards 
and a start-up checklist to each of the team members. This reiterated 
lockout/tagout procedures and stated that only Gordon and Joe were 
authorized to power up and operate the machine until debug was 
complete.
9.6.1 Mechanical and Pneumatics
Before applying power to the machine air was applied to the 
pneumatic quick disconnect. A technician went to all the actuator 
valves and ensured that they were plumbed correctly by manually 
actuating the valve with a screwdriver. Flow controls were set to 
ensure that cylinders operated at the appropriate speed with Joe’s 
supervision. They were then locked down to ensure they would not 
be moved inadvertently.
Gordon did a basic electrical check to make sure that there were 
no short circuits phase to phase, phase to ground, or + to -. Fuses 
were all checked against the schematics, and the fuse holders and 
breakers were left open. Gordon had everyone stand back, closed the 
main enclosure door, and turned the main disconnect on.
Gordon then sequentially engaged all the branch fusing and 
breakers, starting from the highest values closest to the disconnect. 
Since he had checked all the circuits himself using his meter, he knew 
there should be no problems, but it was always safest to follow good 
practices.
All the E-Stops were pulled to their disengaged positions, and 
Gordon pushed the Power On/Reset button. The button illuminated, 
the MCR engaged, and the machine was finished with its power-up 
procedure.
9.6.2 Packaging Integration
Before the program was downloaded, all the auxiliary equipment 
was powered on and tested. The conveyors were driven by VFDs, so 
the keypad on the front was used to turn the conveyors on. This 
ensured that the motors would turn in the correct direction; if they 

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
301
did not it was easy to go into the parameter settings on the drives. If 
motor starters had been used, the phases to the starters would have 
had to be swapped. Speed control of the conveyors was needed, 
though, so VFDs had been chosen.
The vibratory bowl was quite simple and started right up. The 
filler would not seem to run no matter what was done, so Gordon 
arranged for a technician to come out the next day.
When the technician arrived, he explained that the E-Stop circuit 
had to be wired into the main line and the jumpers for auxiliary 
equipment had been inadvertently left out. After the jumpers were in 
place and the E-Stop circuit wired into the line, the technician ran the 
filler through its paces.
After all the stand-alone elements had been set up and exercised, 
it was time to begin integrating the entire line.
9.6.3 Controls
The standard equipment layout for LocalTech included a computer 
utility port on the front of the enclosure. This was manufactured by 
Grace Engineered Products and was somewhat generically called a 
“Graceport.” This was a standard duplex electrical utility outlet with 
a GFCI; it also included a communications port that could be ordered 
in various configurations. This one had an RJ45 Ethernet port 
connected to an internal Ethernet switch linking the PLC, HMI, and 
Ethernet/IP I/O devices.
Gordon first used a BootP utility to set the addresses on the PLC 
and HMI. After communications was established, he downloaded 
both the PLC and HMI programs.
As usual there were a few indicators on the HMI that did not 
connect to the right points in the PLC. These were easy to spot since 
they showed up as dark blue spots on the screen. Gordon corrected 
the addresses and went through all the screens to ensure that 
everything flowed properly.
Usually Gordon used an emulator to test the PLC and HMI 
programs during the writing of the software, but there had simply 
not been enough time. Since this was a smaller line, it was really just 
as easy to check the software on the machine anyway.
Gordon brought up the I/O screens and showed the electrician 
how to navigate the HMI. He gave the electrician an I/O list and had 
him go to every sensor and actuator and ensure they worked all the 
way through the system.
Since the E-Stop circuit had been checked and actuator movements 
adjusted, Gordon then placed the line in manual mode. After checking 
the light stack and ensuring the yellow light was illuminated, he went 
through the process of pressing all the actuator buttons and ensuring 
movement. He started and stopped the chassis drive without the 
clutch engaged and then went ahead and restarted to observe the 
chassis operation. So far everything had worked without a hitch!

302 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
As a standard part of the PLC template, LocalTech had a mode 
called “dry cycle.” This allowed the line to be operated without any 
product loaded just to exercise all the actuators. The next morning 
Gordon decided to let the machine dry cycle for a few hours just to 
make sure that nothing was loose. After lunch the electrician told 
Gordon that the machine had run pretty continuously except for a 
prox that had needed to be adjusted and a loose bolt on a pusher. That 
afternoon it was time to load a few widgets into the machine and see 
how the machine reacted.
It took nearly two weeks of work before Gordon and Joe were 
satisfied that the machine was ready for full automatic operation. The 
vibratory bowl was loaded with widgets provided by ACME, and 
they ran the machine for several more days.
Mark, the project engineer from ACME, had been talking with 
Gordon and Joe regularly since the start of the project. He had stopped 
by during the assembly of the line and stopped in again to watch the 
operation of the line in auto. Everyone agreed that it was time to talk 
about running the factory acceptance test (FAT).
9.7 FAT and SAT
9.7.1 Factory Acceptance
Mark and the production manager, along with two experienced line 
operators from line B, showed up bright and early Monday morning. 
The FAT for this line was to be a continuous four hour run with at 
least 95 percent uptime and full specified speed of 18 parts per hour.
A major element of the speed requirement was that the operators 
had to perform their tasks in concert with the machine. Exceptions for 
bathroom breaks and machine maintenance were a part of the overall 
plan, but for this run the line operation needed to be continuous. 
Rejected parts would also be checked for conformance and known 
bad components inserted by the operators.
Check sheets with a list of performance criteria had been created 
by ACME with input from LocalTech for both this runoff and the 
subsequent one after installation.
After a nearly flawless run the maintenance technicians and 
operators ran the machine through some manual and calibration 
procedures as part of their training process. Mark had no qualms in 
signing off the line as being ready for shipment.
9.7.2 Site Acceptance
After the machine had been shipped and installed, the site acceptance 
test (SAT) was performed similarly to the FAT. An eight-hour run (a 
full shift) was performed using additional operators from line B. The 
line seemed to run even better with over 98 percent uptime.

M a c h i n e  a n d  S y s t e m  D e s i g n  
303
During the initial start-up at ACME, there had been some issues 
with the Cognex vision system. Gordon had found out that light from 
the Mercury Vapor overhead lighting was casting a reflected beam 
into the inspection area; a quickly fabricated shield was placed over 
the guarding and documented for inclusion in the maintenance 
manual.
9.8 Installation
9.8.1 Shipping
After the FAT, the line was taken apart into its individual machines. 
The original crating for the vibratory bowl and packaging machines 
had been set aside and were brought back out for reshipping.
The main chassis was unbolted from the floor and placed on 
wooden “4 × 4” skids. The machine was picked up one end at a time 
using a forklift to slide the skidding underneath, and the legs were 
bolted to the skidding.
Since the machine only had to be shipped across town, it was 
loaded onto a local truck without any crating. Straps were used to tie 
it off, and the other machines and various boxes of odds and ends 
were loaded on the same truck.
9.8.2 Contract Millwright and Electrician
LocalTech had formed a relationship with a local mechanical 
millwright and industrial electrician for installations. They met the 
truck at the ACME plant along with Gordon and Joe and assisted 
with getting the crates and skids to the installation area.
Unlike the assembly area at LocalTech, production areas did not 
always have overhead bridge cranes or forklifts to lift heavy 
equipment. The millwright had assisted with the installation of many 
of LocalTech’s machines in the past and could be counted on to treat 
the equipment carefully.
After getting the equipment into the right location on the plant 
floor, the crating and skidding were removed. The machines were all 
releveled and bolted to the floor using a hammer drill and concrete 
anchors. Special concrete pads had been poured to drill into for part 
of the framing.
With the help of LocalTech’s electrician and the industrial 
electrical contractor, the machines were reconnected. New conduit 
was run from the main panel to the individual machines for power; 
this had been temporary at the LocalTech assembly floor.
ACME’s facility engineer came out and ensured that power and 
air were dropped to the proper location for the line. The machines 
were powered up much more quickly than during the original start-
up since the system had already been checked thoroughly. After 

304 
C h a p t e r  N i n e
Gordon and Joe did a quick check of the machinery, they powered up 
the line and prepared for SAT.
9.9 Support
After the SAT two weeks went by while ACME performed training 
and qualification of the equipment. Mark spent nearly all his time out 
on the floor as two shifts had to be brought up to speed. After two 
weeks the line went into full production as line C.
9.9.1 The First Three Months
There was no doubt that line C was faster and more high-tech than 
line B. Despite the fact that LineX had more experience with the 
widget manufacturing industry, LocalTech had proven to be very 
technical and detail oriented.
The OEE screens on the HMI were helpful in determining the 
causes of stoppages in specific areas of the line. The quality manager 
in particular mentioned that he would like to see this implemented 
on lines A and B also if the budget would allow for it.
Gordon and Joe had needed to come by several times during the 
first few months to make some minor adjustments and software 
changes, but overall the project had turned out to be a huge success. 
LocalTech would be seeing more business from ACME on future 
projects for sure!
9.9.2 Warranty
About nine months into the operation of the line, one of the AC 
motors on a conveyor had stopped working. LocalTech was called 
and the motor sent to the manufacturer for replacement. Since the 
motor had been on the recommended spare parts list, it was quickly 
replaced and production resumed.
One of the photo-eyes on the outfeed conveyor had also 
mysteriously been found broken in the morning twice (after night 
shift, of course). Mark had a guard fabricated and bolted over the 
sensor and anticipated no further issues.

CHAPTER 10
Applications
These are some of the machines and systems the author has designed 
or been involved with over the past 20 years or so.
10.1 Binder-Processing Machine
Customer: Avery Dennison
Completed: 1999
Mechanical: Nalle Automation Systems (NAS)
Controls: Automation Consulting (ACS)
Frame: Aluminum Extrusion
Controller: Allen-Bradley SLC 5/04
Other Components: Emerson Servo
This is a machine built by NAS in the 1998 to 1999 time frame. As you 
can tell, NAS was a huge user of aluminum extrusion; for about five 
years or so they were the biggest 80–20 customer in East Tennessee. 
This machine was built for Avery Dennison in Chicopee, 
Massachusetts. It took the components of a three-ring binder—rings, 
inserts, labels, and so on—assembled them, arranged them in 
alternating stacks, and put them in a box for shipping.
At least five of these machines were built over about a three-year 
period. Probably the most interesting feature of the machine was the 
method of indexing binders from station to station. The binders slid 
into a loading station; then a servo actuated mechanism slid a pair of 
spring-loaded fingers behind the back edge of the binder and pushed 
it from station to station. As the indexer returned from its push, the 
fingers were pressed down beneath the binder surface by the binder 
itself; as the finger emerged behind the binder, the spring would pop 
it up again.
Whenever relying on a purely mechanical method such as this 
plenty of sensors and monitoring of torque needs to be used to detect 
the inevitable crashes. The product is not always completely uniform 
and operator loading error could also be a factor. Quite a few binders 
were destroyed in the runoff process. If they were not in too bad of 
shape, they were used as project notebooks.
305

306 
C h a p t e r  T e n
The drive system used for this system was an Emerson Servo. The 
nice thing about this particular servo was that it was quite self-
contained and had a very user-friendly software and configuration 
package. Integrated servo packages existed within the A-B SLC500 
platform that we were using, but they were much less user-friendly 
than they are with the Kinetix and Sercos systems used today. A-B 
also had the Ultra stand-alone systems at that time, but they were still 
much less user-friendly.
At a basic level this machine was still a packaging machine despite 
the assembly parts of it. NAS eventually moved on to building 
primarily standard packaging equipment.
10.2 Crystal Measurement
Customer: CTI
Completed: 2005
Mechanical: Agile Engineering
Controls: Automation Consulting (ACS)
Frame: Welded Steel Base, Aluminum Extrusion Guarding
Controller: Koyo DL205
Other Components: Keyence Laser Scanner
FIGURE 10.1 Binder-processing machine.

A p p l i c a t i o n s  
307
This station shown in Fig. 10.2 was used to measure a small crystal 
used in the manufacture of medical CT scanners. A Keyence laser 
scanner was used to measure the crystal in three different axes, 
providing both dimensional and “squareness” information to an 
operator.
The controller used was a Koyo (Automation Direct) PLC and a 
Keyence precision scanning CCD laser measurement system. The 
operator unit on the right shows the Keyence unit where set points 
and measurement data are set up. This information is transferred 
serially to the PLC, which logs the data into registers for transfer to a 
computer with a database. This technique is often used in multiple 
measurement applications where a PLC is used as a manipulator 
controller and a data concentrator.
The crystal (shown in Fig. 10.3 to the left of the stainless steel 
datum—it is very small) is placed in the tooling, which contains a small 
vacuum hole. The vacuum pulls the crystal up firmly into a small 
pocket. An analog vacuum measurement is used to determine whether 
the top of the crystal is flat; irregularities cause the vacuum to leak. The 
steel datum point is used as a reference to measure the length of the 
crystal precisely rather than using the actual position of the actuators. 
FIGURE 10.2 Crystal gauging station.

308 
C h a p t e r  T e n
This provides accuracy greater than if the actual position were used 
because of the slop in the actuator bearing. The distance from the side of 
the crystal to the datum is also measured at the top and bottom of the 
crystal to give the parallelness of the top to the sides. The crystal is 
rotated 90° on axis and the measurement taken again. The entire 
mechanism then tilts 90° to measure the length.
There is a lot going on in a very small space in this application. 
The tooling was designed by Agile Engineering in Knoxville, 
Tennessee, for the end user, CTI. My old company, ACS, designed 
and built the controls. Another example of several companies working 
together for a successful project.
10.3 SmartBench
Customer: None (Prototype)
Completed: 2003
Mechanical and Controls: Automation Consulting (ACS)
FIGURE 10.3 Crystal manipulator and measurement.

A p p l i c a t i o n s  
309
Frame: Aluminum Extrusion
Controller: Koyo DL205
Other Components: Maple Systems Touchscreen
The SmartBench is a combination of software and hardware controls 
that allows the programming of sequential events by means of 
entering functions by number into step locations on a touch screen. 
Functions may react to specified inputs, energize or deenergize 
outputs, perform timed “waits,” or detect timed or out of sequence 
faults. As configured in Fig. 10.4, there are 32 digital inputs and 32 
digital outputs grouped into eight 4in/4out cable ports, which can be 
connected to configured stations such as the assembly pallet shown 
above. Functions are then allowed to be named by the programmer 
by means of a pop-up alphanumeric touch screen on the HMI.
The system will automatically start at the first programmed step 
or function, proceeding to the next when the current step’s completion 
is accomplished. This will continue until a nonprogrammed or zero 
step is encountered, after which the sequence will start over.
FIGURE 10.4 The SmartBench.

310 
C h a p t e r  T e n
The operating system of the SmartBench shown above is a Koyo/
Automation Direct PLC with two 16-point input and two 16-point 
output cards. There is also a slot-mounted Ethernet card installed for 
remote download of recipes or sequences from a PC, allowing the 
sequence to be arranged by means of a spreadsheet or database 
program such as Microsoft Excel or Access.
The current onboard operator interface or HMI is a Maple Systems 
touch screen with onboard recipe memory. The PLC performs the 
logic, sequencing, and timing functions and rearranging of function 
names into their proper step locations, fault detection, and password 
access to screens. The operator interface stores the configured 
sequences and allows entry of alphanumeric data descriptions into 
the PLC registers associated with each function. The picture in Fig. 
10.4 was taken at an industrial trade show. The HMI touchscreen is to 
the right; the computer on the left was used for the attached vision 
system.
The SmartBench was created as a replacement for several 
dedicated purpose assembly stations at TRW Koyo, Vonore, Tennessee. 
It was meant to be able to individually replace any of the existing 
machines as they were retooled for the next program year of hose 
assemblies. At the Greenville tradeshow, a pallet was built where 
attendees could assemble a balsa airplane. As the first part, the body, 
was inserted into the tooling, a latch was activated, locking the piece 
in place. Lights would blink on both the bins and the tooling indicating 
where the operator was to pick or place the next component. After all 
parts were detected to be in place, a camera was triggered to inspect 
the plane for items such as upside-down wings or missing components. 
After successful completion, the plane would be released and the 
sequence started over. The trade show was quite successful in acquiring 
new projects, although most were related to other applications.
Although a Koyo PLC and a Maple Systems touch screen were 
used for the prototype SmartBench, the programming techniques 
can be used on any platform that has the same capabilities. The most 
cost-effective form would be to put the operating system on a 
microprocessor and create a circuit card that could interface with I/O.
10.4 Sagger Load Station
Customer: Alcoa/Howmet
Completed: 2005
Mechanical and Controls: Automation Consulting (ACS)
Frame: Aluminum Extrusion
Controller: Allen Bradley SLC5/05
Other Components: Maple Systems Touchscreen, Motoman HP6 
Robot

A p p l i c a t i o n s

The Sagger Load Station is a system that loads ceramic turbine 
blade castings into a ceramic box filled with sand called a “sagger.” 
Loaded saggers are placed on an infeed conveyor, where they are 
indexed into a pick-and-place station that inverts the sagger over a 
screen, allowing the sand to fall into a hopper. The empty sagger is 
then indexed around to the backside of the hopper, where a layer of 
sand is fed by a screw feeder from the bottom of the hopper into the 
sagger. The sagger indexes to a load position, where a robot removes 
ceramic castings from a mold and gently embeds it into the sand 
layer. Once the layer of castings is complete, the sagger is indexed 
back to the hopper station and another layer of sand is poured over 
the casting layer. After indexing back under the robot, a layer of 
castings is inserted, then a layer of sand until the sagger is loaded. A 
final layer of sand is placed on the top, and the sagger exits the station. 
Operators then place the saggers in an oven for several hours; the 
sagger is brought back to the station and unloaded and the sand-
filled sagger placed on the infeed conveyor again.
A unique feature of this station is the spring-loaded cammed 
pick-and-place inverter. As the saggers were quite heavy, a mechanism 
was used to balance the sagger load at every point as it was inverted, 
allowing a much smaller rotary pneumatic cylinder to be used for 
both forward and reverse motions.
This system was installed in early 2005 and was one of ACS’s 
first large machines. It used an Allen-Bradley SLC5/05 processor 
and a Maple Systems touch screen. A MotoMan HP6 Robot was 
used to unload the molding press and place castings into the 
sagger.

10.5 Tray Handlers
Customer: Undisclosed
Completed: 2009
Mechanical and Controls: Wright Industries
Frame: Welded Steel
Controller: Siemens S7
Other Components: WinCC Touch Screen, Siemens Sinamics Servos
Figure 10.6 is an illustration of a nonrobotic motion control 
application. As with most of my other motion jobs, this one did not 
have any kinds of coordinated motion involved, but it was challenging 
from a sensing standpoint. The concept was to be able to stack (fill) 
FIGURE 10.6 Tray handler.

A p p l i c a t i o n s

or destack (empty) trays. An operator would load the tray handler 
with an either full or empty stack of trays with a forklift. The trays 
would be presented one at a time to an operator, starting either from 
the bottom or the top of the stack. Much of the coding involved 
teaching or programming the various stack heights, tray positions, 
and lift points and remembering where you were in the process 
regardless of what manual activities had taken place.
Two parallel pairs of Z-axes were used to lift the trays. One was 
the tray lift, which would move to the tray above that which was to 
be removed. It would extend fingers into slots in the trays and then 
lift the stack off the target tray. The tray extender would then extend 
its fingers, lift slightly, and a horizontal axis would extend the tray 
forward to be either filled or emptied by the operator. The two Z-axes 
and the horizontal axis were all Siemens Sinamics servo drives and 
motors controlled by a Siemens S7-300 PLC. All drive and HMI 
communications were via Profibus.
The trickiest part of this application was in knowing where the 
trays were. Since the tray stacks were always full of trays of the same 
thickness, all the tray positions were simply programmed as an index 
value. This saved money from the standpoint of not having to put 
sensors on the fingers or scan the stack, but it caused some problems 
when stacks that did not conform were inserted. The trays and spacer 
poles were made of graphite, a brittle ceramic material that could 
withstand high oven temperatures; as such they were quite breakable. 
A few photo-eyes were located in the machine for product location, 
but they did not always work where trays were misoriented.
Overtravel switches were located in the usual locations near the 
ends of the axes, but ideally they would have been put on the vertical 
axes tooling mounts themselves since the axes could hit each other 
long before they reached end of stroke. This is a good thing to 
remember whenever working with two parallel axes that can interfere 
with each other: always take into account what else the axis can hit 
besides end of travel on the actuator itself.
10.6 Cotton Classing System
Customer: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Completed: 2000
Controls: Automation Consulting (ACS)
Conveyors: Nalle Automation (NAS)
Testers: Zellweger-Uster
Frame: Aluminum Extrusion
Controller: Allen-Bradley SLC5/04
Other Components: Rockwell RSView32 on computer, embedded 
controllers on testers

314 
C h a p t e r  T e n
The picture in Fig. 10.7 is of the cotton classing system at the USDA 
facility in Memphis. This was a cooperative project between my 
company ACS, NAS, and Zellweger-Uster. This is an example of 
automation that is not located in your typical industrial facility.
Often companies or organizations without a great deal of 
automation history reach a point where they feel they need to 
automate some of their processes to save money or increase 
production. The people who are part of the processes being automated 
are usually highly skilled at their tasks but do not have experience 
with automation techniques and concepts. Devices like HMIs, 
E-Stops, and light curtains may be new to the facility, and there is 
often no maintenance staff skilled in the troubleshooting and care of 
these systems. There is also the incongruity of noisy industrial 
equipment being placed into a lab or clean room–type environment.
In this case, the product being handled and inspected is cotton 
samples from growers throughout the Southeast. The picture back in 
Fig. 4.1, shows a cotton sample being transported on this system. 
Prior to using this system, small pieces of cotton samples were placed 
under cameras by hand to determine color and the quantity of foreign 
matter and seeds in the sample. This system allowed the material 
handling to be done without human intervention. As with many 
other projects, there were a lot of iterations of the system, and it grew 
more complex as lessons were learned. A third level of conveyors was 
added to allow retesting of the samples upon inconclusive results. 
FIGURE 10.7 Cotton classing system.

A p p l i c a t i o n s

Because of the loose tufts of cotton that inevitably ended up floating 
around the facility, there was talk of entirely enclosing the cotton 
sample pallets; I believe the system was decommissioned before this 
was ever done.
Because of this same incongruity of having semi-industrial 
equipment effectively installed on a tile floor in the equivalent of an 
office building, the system eventually was removed and operators 
went back to loading test samples by hand. There are some things 
that just cannot be automated effectively, was this one of them? Only 
time will tell. . . .

APPENDIX A
ASCII Table
A
SCII stands for American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so 
an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character 
such as a or @ or an action of some sort. ASCII was developed a long 
time ago and now the nonprinting characters are rarely used for their 
original purpose. Below is the ASCII character table, which includes 
descriptions of the first 32 nonprinting characters. ASCII was actually 
designed for use with teletypes, so the descriptions are somewhat 
obscure. If someone says they want your document in ASCII format, 
all this means is they want “plain” text with no formatting such as 
tabs, bold, or underscoring—the raw format that any computer can 
understand. This is usually so they can easily import the file into their 
own applications without issues. Notepad.exe creates ASCII text, or 
in MS Word you can save a file as “text only.”

APPENDIX F
Thermocouples
Types
Certain combinations of alloys have become popular as industry 
standards. Selection of the combination is driven by cost, availability, 
convenience, melting point, chemical properties, stability, and output. 
Different types are best suited for different applications. They are 
usually selected based on the temperature range and sensitivity 
needed. Thermocouples with low sensitivities (B, R, and S types) 
have correspondingly lower resolutions. Other selection criteria 
include the inertness of the thermocouple material and whether it is 
magnetic or not. Standard thermocouple types are listed below with 
the positive electrode first, followed by the negative electrode.
K
Type K (chromel{90 percent nickel and 10 percent chromium}–alumel)
(Alumel consisting of 95 percent nickel, 2 percent manganese, 
2 percent aluminum, and 1 percent silicon) is the most common 
general purpose thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 
41 μV/°C, chromel positive relative to alumel. It is inexpensive, and 
a wide variety of probes are available in its −200°C to +1350°C / –328°F 
to +2462°F range. Type K was specified at a time when metallurgy was 
less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may 
vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, 
nickel, is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with 
magnetic material is that they undergo a deviation in output when the 
material reaches its Curie point; this occurs for type K thermocouples 
at around 150°C.
E
Type E (chromel–constantan) has a high output (68 μV/°C), which 
makes it well suited to cryogenic use. Additionally, it is nonmagnetic.
341

342 
A p p e n d i x  F
J
Type J (iron–constantan) has a more restricted range than type K 
(−40°C to +750°C), but higher sensitivity of about 55 μV/°C. The Curie 
point of the iron (770°C)] causes an abrupt change in the characteristic, 
which determines the upper temperature limit.
N
Type N (nicrosil–nisil) (nickel-chromium-silicon/nickel-silicon) 
thermocouples are suitable for use at high temperatures, exceeding 
1200°C, because of their stability and ability to resist high temperature 
oxidation. Sensitivity is about 39 μV/°C at 900°C, slightly lower than 
type K. Designed to be an improved type K because of increased 
stability at higher temperatures, it is becoming more popular, 
although the differences may or may not be substantial enough to 
warrant a change.
Platinum (Types B, R, and S)
Types B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum–rhodium 
alloy for each conductor. These are among the most stable 
thermocouples but have lower sensitivity than other types, 
approximately 10 μV/°C. Type B, R, and S thermocouples are usually 
used only for high temperature measurements because of their high 
cost and low sensitivity.
B
Type B thermocouples use a platinum–rhodium alloy for each 
conductor. One conductor contains 30 percent rhodium, while the 
other conductor contains 6 percent rhodium. These thermocouples 
are suited for use at up to 1800°C. Type B thermocouples produce the 
same output at 0°C and 42°C, limiting their use below about 50°C.
R
Type R thermocouples use a platinum–rhodium alloy containing 
13 percent rhodium for one conductor and pure platinum for the 
other conductor. Type R thermocouples are used up to 1600°C.
S
Type S thermocouples are constructed using one wire of 90 percent 
platinum and 10 percent rhodium (the positive or “+” wire) and 
a second wire of 100 percent platinum (the negative or “–” wire). Like 
type R, type S thermocouples are used up to 1600°C. In particular, 
type S is used as the standard of calibration for the melting point of 
gold (1064.43°C).

T h e r m o c o u p l e s  
343
T
Type 
T 
(copper–constantan) 
thermocouples 
are 
suited 
for 
measurements in the −200 to 350°C range. Often used as a differential 
measurement since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both 
conductors are nonmagnetic, there is no Curie point and thus no 
abrupt change in characteristics. Type T thermocouples have a 
sensitivity of about 43 μV/°C.
C
Type C (tungsten 5 percent rhenium–tungsten, 26 percent rhenium) 
thermocouples are suited for measurements in the 0°C to 2320°C 
range. This thermocouple is well suited for vacuum furnaces at 
extremely high temperatures. It must never be used in the presence of 
oxygen at temperatures above 260°C.
M
Type M thermocouples use a nickel alloy for each wire. The positive 
wire (20 alloy) contains 18 percent molybdenum, while the negative 
wire (19 alloy) contains 0.8 percent cobalt. These thermocouples are 
used in vacuum furnaces for the same reasons as with type C. Upper 
temperature is limited to 1400°C. It is less commonly used than other 
types.
Chromel–Gold/iron
In chromel–gold/iron thermocouples, the positive wire is chromel 
and the negative wire is gold with a small fraction (0.03 to 0.15 atom 
percent) of iron. It can be used for cryogenic applications (1.2 to 300 K 
and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range 
depends on the iron concentration. The sensitivity is typically around 
15 μV/K at low temperatures, and the lowest usable temperature 
varies between 1.2 and 4.2 K.
