May
i suggest a perspective for looking at this book, for seeing its sig-
nificance, and the reason for publishing
it.
Suppose that in some un-
catalogued pile of
1 7th century archives, a manuscript should be discov-
ered doing for—well, let us say for Ter Borch, or Jan Steen, or Peter de
Hooch, what
is here done for a man who portrays the everyday life of
everyday people in his time as they did in theirs. Would you fall eagerly
upon such a record of the development of one of the Dutch genre paint-
ers? You know you would. And you would be richly rewarded
if the
artist had, as Rockwell does in this volume, lent himself with honesty
and a disarming lack of complacency to a report on his training in youth
and his work up to his middle period.
There are so many
little—and vital—things which nobody ever tells
us about the
artists of the past.
Take the brothers LeNain, who alone
among the French
artists of their period, painted the plain farm men
and women and the artisans of the 17th century. How much
it would
mean to us if we could learn how they set their palettes, how they pre-
pared their canvases, how they learned draughtsmanship, what they did
to earn their livings in their apprentice period, what the effect upon them
was of the understanding (in their case, probably, the misunderstanding,
underestimating and neglect)
of their work by their contemporaries.
Suppose that such a book were about Jan Steen, and that from it we
had learned that he had, in his youth, painted (an amusing idea) some
pious altar-pieces, with portraits on each side of the rich donor and his
vii

wife
stiffly dressed up in their brocaded Sunday best. Such painting for
pay was in those days, we may assume, the equivalent of advertisements
for
the modern
artist.
The comparison
of such early work with Jan
Steen's later competent painting of noisy tavern scenes would probably
be
as
striking
as,
in
this book,
the comparison between the youthful
Norman P. Rockwell's advertisements and covers, with such a canvas as
his
fine,
imaginative, harmonious portrait
of Ichabod Crane, with
its
touch of just-right grotesqueness.
For a young person a chance
to study the beginnings of a mature
character
is
priceless.
But he does not get many such opportunities.
Most people have a strong Minerva-springing-full-grown-from-the-head-
of-Jove complex. They cover up with nervous care evidences of the fact
that they too were once young and fumbling their way uncertainly to-
wards maturity. Very few have the quiet lack of personal vanity of the
subject
of
this book;
a
quality
truly surprising (human nature being
what it is)
in a man so widely loved and admired as he.
All in all, I feel that if you want to understand this report about a con-
temporary, you will do well to consider
it such a record as the hypo-
thetical ones
I have imagined, not only of the development of an illus-
trator and painter, but of an interpreter of his nation's life.
I have recently written a defense of those serious and sincere modern
authors who attempt to understand and portray what they see in Amer-
ican
life, even
if their report
is shocking to those who have never come
in contact with filth and moral degradation. My argument
is that
if. in
American
life, such sordidness and misery are often found, nothing
is
gained by pretending in books that things in our country are different
from what they are.
Having gone on record publicly with
this claim
of the right of an
honest portrayer of human life to give us his report, even if it sickens us,
I think
I have the right to make the same claim for another honest por-
trayer of human life even if his report cheers and comforts us.
Just at present the one
is up on the see-saw of aesthetic fashion and
the other
is down.
This
is,
I think, an especial reason for calling the at-
tention of Americans to the story of Norman Rockwell's work (up to his

PREFACE
ix
middle period )
.
If he had painted in the mid-Victorian period of hush-
hush about the ugly and ignoble aspects of human
life, a comment on
what he gives us should, perhaps, have contained a reminder that—the
traditional European reproach to Emerson—he does not look at death,
failure, defeat.
But we have in these last decades supped deep of por-
trayals of frustration and defeat. Such portrayals give but one aspect of
real life. Another aspect has the right to our recognition.
It is true that,
in our country, minorities suffer from savagely unjust discriminations,
that there are shocking inequalities of opportunity which cause wide-
spread human misery.
But in our America there are also—so familiar
that a portrayal of them gives to millions the pleasure of recognition
uncountable homes, warm with love and
trust, and with thankfulness
for the
shelter,
in the very midst
of the typhoon
of human struggle,
which such homes give to those who live in them.
No one can deny that in many tenement houses the poor are ground
down by poverty, disease or racial injustice into the dreadfulness of wish-
ing, being hurt themselves, to hurt others weaker than they. Our hearts
have been frozen by many a powerful book-presentation of this literal
but
partial
truth.
Norman Rockwell reminds us (we must not forget
that he
is as accurately true to the literal fact, and as partial), that in
those same tenement houses are also many homes in which the safe re-
turn of a soldier son—insignificant droplet in the military ocean—sets
off an explosion of a joy magnificent in its power and purity.
We have always imagined the smart
British
officers, and the well-
trained, well-equipped British professional soldier, sneering coldly at our
Yankee Doodle bumpkin.
Norman Rockwell shows them laughing in
easy, golden good nature
at the hobbledehoy.
Undoubtedly some
of
them did
so.
That
is as likely, granted British character, as the other.
(In passing don't fail to examine with attention the admirable draughts-
manship in the page of preliminary drawings of the old British gren-
adier.)
In a period when wormwood and vinegar are the fashionable
flavorings,
it is genuine originality for Rockwell to dip his brush into the
honey-pot of lovableness and zest in living.
His originality
(it must take some courage, too)
in thus painting an

XORMAX ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
aspect
of the truth which he chooses to paint,
is shown again by his
swimming against the current of fashion—in ignoring what is known as
"natural''
beauty.
Just
as he does not portray misery and malicious
wrong-doing (although the extreme sensitiveness of his face in the photo-
graph standing before
his
easel, page
32, gives evidence that he can-
not
but
be
aware
of
it)
so
he
resolutely
paints
landscapes.
In
a
period so given over to the Romantic School preoccupation with "nature
effects" that the general public almost considers red barns and covered
bridges and mirror reflections in water, or at least vegetables and
fruit,
as the only subjects for "real pictures," here is a painter who ignores the
non-human scene.
He has some to-be-respected forerunners in this. The great Londoner
Dr. Johnson had no use for the globe save as background
for human
life; Daumier the mighty, hardly ever shows anything on his canvases
but men and women and children.
Hogarth found humanity enough.
One might be permitted to cite here, because
it
is undoubtedly an ex-
pression of what many people feel, the remark of that city-loving Cabot
who said to a friend about to spend a day in the country, "Just kick a
tree for me, will you?"
Before the nineteenth century most people took this indifference to or
dislike of the country for granted.
But the modern Nature cult has been
so permeating that in our times that section of humanity which
is bored
by trees and rivers and barns, and interested only in other human beings,
scarcely realizes
it. And
if they were consciously aware that this
is their
real
feeling, few of them would dare to raise their voices against that
inosi unquestioned of all dictatorships, a prevailing aesthetic fashion.
In the case of a man so transparently sincere, so honestly earnest
as
Norman Rockwell, does
it take "courage"
to go against a fashionable
aesthetic convention?
Probably not.
Probably he has no time to think
whether he
is going against what the knowing ones of his period accept
It
is ol)\ lous from the story of bis life and work that he is single-heartedly
focused on what makes up the
life of am
kind of creative personality,
the
long, desperate
Struggle with
his own
limitations.
But
if we are to
understand him. we will do well to remember that
it does not make sense

PREFACE
XI
to think that his elimination of tragedy and cruelty can be laid to a wish
to please the people who look at his work, because he leaves out, firmly
and
consistently,
something
else
that would
please
them,
something
which moderns love to look at—the beauty of Nature.
In both instances it is plain that he purposefully makes his own choice
from an inner necessity.
Every artist learns early, or he is no artist, that
he must drink out of his own cup, must cultivate his own half-acre, be-
cause he never can have anv other.

Biographical Introduction-. Jack Alexander
Norman Rockwell discovered the Century of the Common Man
a
generation before the statesmen did.
This was appropriate enough, for
great
painters—and
great
novelists,
poets and
essayists—have always
jumped
the gun on
history while the
political leaders were squatting
back on
their haunches awaiting an audible
signal
or a
significantly
planted boot.
Intuition is a wonderful thing.
Rockwell's Century of the Common Man began in the early spring of
19 1 6 when he was a skinny, twenty-one-year-old artist dabbling around
a studio in New Rochelle. New
York. He was worrying alone blithely
on
fifty
dollars a month which a boys' magazine was paying him
for
drawing the cover of each issue, illustrating two stories and performing
the duties of art editor.
It was a
thankless grind, and
his studio mate,
a cartoonist named
Clyde Forsythe, kept telling him that he ought to be aiming, instead, at
the cover of America's dominant magazine, The Saturday Evening Post.
"Gosh, the Post." was
all young Rockwell said at
first.
But the idea
stuck
in
his mind
like a bur and he soon began experimenting with
sketches.
They were pictures of unreal, glorified girls dawdling around
with collar-ad men.
The Post, Forsythe advised him paternally, didn't
use that kind of cover;
it wanted scenes showing real people in simple,
everyday story situations.
Forsythe was pretty well established as a news-
paper artist and knew the ropes. Under the pseudonym of Vic. he was
drawing a popular sports-page comic strip based upon the adventures

NORMAN ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
of a ham prize fighter named Axel and his manager, Flooey.
Rockwell
bowed to superior knowledge, and did two paintings on the subject he
knew best—boys. He added a rough sketch of a third.
Although scared at his own brashness. young Rockwell prepared can-
nily for his call in Philadelphia. He was. and
still
is. the impulsive type
of person who gets his fingers tangled in the string while untying a pack-
age. To avoid such a fiasco and also to impress the art editor, he had a
harness maker build a big wooden case for his paintings.
Except for the
fact that
it was covered with black oilcloth, the case might easily have
been mistaken for a child's casket.
But
it opened and shut easily.
The then art editor. Walter H. Dower, received the paintings and the
rough sketch with a look of mild amazement at Rockwell's carrying case,
and took them into his private office.
Rockwell, with his case across his
knees,
sat nervously and waited
for the verdict, looking like one of his
subsequent
cover
subjects.
He glanced
at
the
walls of the anteroom
and saw hanging there originals by well-known Post
artists.
That gave
him a sinking feeling.
Two men. who. he later Learned, were Irvin S. Cobb and Samuel
(..
Blythe.
sauntered through
the room and stopped.
Rockwell stared
at
i hem, and they stared at the black case on
his lap.
With exaggerated
frowns, they walked around and around

Just then Dower came out
of his office and said he was buying both the paintings and wanted Rock-
well to go ahead with the sketch idea.

in the promulgation of an office rule assuring the personal attention of
the
art
editor,
or
his
assistant,
to any
artist bringing his wares
to the
editorial offices.
It was love at
first sight between Rockwell and the Post, and today
the affair is going as strongly as ever. The first Rockwell cover appeared
on the Post of May 20,
19 16, and more than 200 have appeared since
then.
Editors and associate editors have come and gone in that time, and
the present ones are as enthusiastic over Rockwell as their predecessors.
Rockwell, for his part, has never wavered in his attachment to the Post
and its traditions.
He has retained his pristine awe for it as an American institution and
his wonderment over the fact that a kid
artist could walk unheralded
into its offices and have his talent immediately recognized.
Year after year, he has gone on portraying the Common Man on this
magazine's
jacket—and
the Common
Man's
wife,
his
children,
his
pastor, his doctor, his garage mechanic, his druggist, his grocer, his bar-
ber,
his
flivver,
his dog and
his neighbors.
Rockwell's Common Man
was earthily American. He raised no clenched fist and carried no banner
demanding anything, and he didn't incite anyone to riot.
It is doubtful
if the artist would have recognized the term "social significance" if some-
one had bellowed
it at him from a platform.
But social significance his
covers had, because his characters wore the natural dignity of the ordi-
nary man who prefers to carry his own weight, if given the chance.
Rockwell
liked
his characters and he painted them with sympathy
and a decent humor, never with the stark distortion of his more arty con-
temporaries.
"I guess
I am a storyteller," he says now, in discussing his
work, "and although this may not be the highest form of art
it
is what
I love to do."
Because Rockwell breathed affection into his paintings,
they aroused affection in the heart of the beholder, and one was dull in-
deed who did not comprehend that the Common Man was a quite un-
common fellow. The political implications of the Rockwell covers were
obvious enough.
Through
the masterly
indirection
of the
artist,
the
Common Man asked only his rights as an American and silently pledged
his faith in the promise of his country and in the system under which he

lived and raised his family.
Rockwell's men are not Hollywood heroes,
his
girls are not Powers
models and his boys are not flaxen-haired angels. They are real people,
marked by the attritional processes of
life, and they are faithfully ren-
dered to the last wrinkle, callus, crow's-foot, shoulder stoop and irregular
nose line. They are people who have been thwarted and have had their
small triumphs; who have hungered and have sometimes feasted; who
have spoken their minds in meeting and have prayed, in the confidence
that their words were as important as those of a president or king; who
have kept alive in their hearts the hope of a constantly improving world.
They are the masses.
Some other professed spokesmen for them have
used the cynical paintbrush or the strident larynx.
Rockwell, with the sure perception of the great artist, has made their
dreams sing by helping to make America conscious of its quiet strength.
Post readers, writing
in, often say, "He understands us." and no inter-
preter could win higher praise.
So true
is the Rockwell portrayal that
mention
of
his models
is sometimes used
in
lieu of words themselves.
During the war, a New York Times war correspondent described a
fel-
low passenger in an Army plane
thus, "A small private sitting behind
me, who might have posed for one of Norman Rockwell's Saturday l;<
-
ning Post covers, tapped my shoulder." Willie

Once
a year or so. Rockwell leaves his home in Arlington. Vermont,
and
lectures at the Society of Illustrators in New York City, where he
always talks to a packed gathering. As an
artist unaffected bv am

rent
fad, and
intent only on straight portrayal of American
life, he
is
something of a curiosity, but students sit at his feet solely to learn some-
thing about his remarkable technique.
These
visits are homecomings
for Rockwell. He was born and spent
his childhood on Manhattan's Upper West
Side, where he was a choir
bo\
at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. He inherited artistic talent
from
his father, a cotton-goods merchant who was an amateur sketcher,
,ni(l from
his maternal grandfather. Thomas Hill, an English artisl who
emigrated
to
this country.

feather by feather, and Rockwell thinks that his own passion for detail
may
trace back
to
his grandfather.
In
his paintings. Rockwell never
fakes a detail.
If a setting calls for a Colonial bedstead or footstool, he
haunts auctions or antique shops until he gets what he wants. He gets
his dog models from the nearest dog pound because, he says, the inmates
have taken a beating from life and have character. He paints from live
human models wearing clothing taken from a wardrobe of 200-odd cos-
tumes he keeps on hand.
When
traveling, he constantly adds
to the
wardrobe.
In the collection
is a battered hat he bought for two dollars
from a guide who was taking him through Death Valley.
It has ap-
peared in four Post covers, to date.
Rockwell says that a hat cannot be aged artificially;
it needs plenty of
sweat and sunlight. A few years ago, while in the vicinity of Hannibal,
Missouri, preparing
to
illustrate
special
editions of Tom Sawyer and
Huckleberry Finn, he hailed a farmer who was plowing a field and of-
fered to trade trousers with him and throw in four dollars to boot. Eager
to make money the easy way. but suspicious that he was dealing with a
genial maniac, the farmer insisted on getting the four dollars in advance.

Rockwell got out of his car and handed
it over, and under a tree they
silently detrousered themselves and made the exchange.
Rockwell drove
away well
satisfied; he had added a superbly weather-beaten pair of
pants to his collection.
As a boy, Rockwell was always sketching, and when he was in
his
second year of high school he quit and entered the National Academy
of Design.
After a morning at the Academy, he would spend the after-
noon at the Art Students League, where he came under the tutelage of
an eminent teacher, George Bridgman. At seventeen, he was illustrating
children's books
for a New York publishing firm and
at eighteen he
worked into the boys'-magazine job he was holding down when he made
his Post debut, in 191 6.
A \ear after his first Post cover had appeared, the United States de-
clared war on Germany, and Rockwell, outwardly an almost giddy lad.
but deadly serious inwardly, laid aside his brushes and tried to enlist in
the Navy.
The recruiting office turned him down because he was eight
pounds underweight.
Overnight,
the candidate gorged himself on an
appalling
diet
of bananas, warm water and doughnuts, and
applied
again in the morning. He was accepted this time and shipped off to the
navy yard at Charleston, South Carolina.
Like most boys his age. Rockwell was anxious for action, but after he
had made a casual drawing of a chief petty officer, his identity as a Post
contributor was discovered. The commandant sent to New York for his
brushes and materials, and installed Rockwell
in the
officers' quarters.

became the commandants pet. When British or French admirals were
visiting,
Rockwell was summoned
to the
official dinner
to sketch
the
visitors, and
his work
delighted
everyone.
In between drawing naval
officers, he was permitted
to paint
Post
covers, and during

senger was stopped in mid-Atlantic by an American submarine, whose
skipper, yelling from the conning tower, ordered the vessel to turn about
and return to port.
Rockwell never did learn the reason for this, but for
a time suspected that the Charleston commandant had something to do
with
it. When news of the armistice arrived, Rockwell applied for his
discharge and was told he would have to wait.
"Unless," his patron added, "you commit some crime and get a dis-
honorable
discharge.
Or you might
get an
inadaptability
discharge,
which would mean that you were too stupid to perform your duties. Of
course, you wouldn't want
that."
The
officer was surprised when the
young man who was on his way to fame as an
artist accepted an in-
adaptability discharge
as a
third-class varnisher and painter. He was
mustered out on November fourteenth, one of the
first members of the
armed services to get out of uniform.
"I was painting a cruiser captain
at the time," he says now, reminiscently.
Rockwell's Post covers up to this time had been mostly of boys.
After
the war, he painted old men for a time and gradually worked people of
all ages into his paintings. He became so popular that the Post's editors
almost had to place an armed guard around him to fend off other pa-
trons.
Rockwell had the easygoing, carefree nature which
is endemic
among artists, and found
it difficult to say no to anyone who sought his
services. A result was that his Post cover schedule was irregular at times.
Another difficulty was a yearning Rockwell had for turning out a mag-
num opus, a painting that would mark him for the ages.
It
is a dream
that
all
artists have
to face
at some time
in
their
lives.
Professional
friends, dabbling in modernism, told him he ought to learn something
about dynamic symmetry, and
their arguments worried him.
"If you
don't get on the modernist band wagon, you're licked," they kept saying.
Stewing and fretting, Rockwell packed up and went to Paris to seek
refreshment of style at the feet of the moderns. He attended lectures
and bought Picassos to hang in his studio for inspiration. On his return
he set about applying what he had learned to Post covers. The dynam-
ically symmetric
results were nightmares.

Editor Lorimer ex-
amined

first new-Rockwell offerings he laid them aside and gave

the artist a paternal lecture on the value of being one's self, pointing out
in passing that
it was conceivably better to have one's work displayed
on the Post's covers than to have
it embalmed in art museums.
Chas-
tened. Rockwell agreed, and went back to being himself. He now refers
to his temporary aberration as "my James Joyce-Gertrude Stein period."
What did most to get Rockwell back on the beam and keep him there
was a vacation trip he made in 1930. While visiting his old friend Clyde
Forsythe
in
California, he met a Stanford
girl named Mary Barstow.
Three weeks later they were married.
That was the fastest important
job Rockwell ever completed.
In his Post art work he hesitates to trust
his own judgment, or anyone else's, and a person who didn't understand
the perfectionist
instinct of the good
artist would think he was shilly-
shallying.
Periodically he comes down to Philadelphia
to submit seven
or eight rough pencil drawings of cover ideas, and bubbles with enthusi-
asm as he discusses them.
If, say, four are approved for completion, he
may discover, on the ride back to Vermont, that two are imperfectly con-
ceived and telephone from Arlington
for permission
to change them.
Or he may decide to abandon one or both of them.
The calm that Mary Rockwell has brought into his home
life doesn't
touch the nerve-racking routine of seeing a painting through to comple-
tion, except during the actual brushwork
itself. When Rockwell
is be-
fore
his
easel, she reads novels or biographies aloud
to him. and
this
seems
to
aid him
in
concentrating.
But somewhere along the
route.
Rockwell usually pulls up short with a terrible feeling that something
is
wrong with the picture.
If Mrs. Rockwell can't supply the answer, a call
is
put
in
tor Mead Schaeffer or John Atherton, two other Post cover
artists who also live in Arlington and operate, with Rockwell, a Mutual-
Admiration, Hand-Holding and Aid
Society.
When any member

other Arlington friend, from the station-master to the general-store pro-
prietor, who can spare half an hour.
While the lay experts are wagging their heads and venturing opinions.
Rockwell keeps up a low. miserable chant consisting mostly of "Oh. gosh,
oh. gosh, what a palooka
I turned out to be
!'"
His state of indecision
sometimes persists for days.
Meanwhile, he sleeps badly,
tries out new
approaches
to his idea and
restlessly hikes through the near-by Green
Mountains,
his reedy.
135-pound frame bent over like that of a mon-
goose
flushing
a
cobra.
Ultimately,
the agony comes to an end with
the dawning of a gentle inner light, and Rockwell has what he describes
as "something I can sincerely paint." He paints
it and bundles the can-
vas off for Philadelphia.
"Then."* he says. "I
sit back and pray.*"
There is a saying in Arlington that posing for Rockwell. Schaeffer and
Atherton
is one
of the towns more important
industries.
It
is rarely
necessary
for the
artists to look beyond the town's boundaries for the
right types. The reason rural Vermonters make such good models. Rock-
well thinks,
is that they are a proud breed who would die before trying
to be
like anyone
else, and hence have an individuality unmarred by
attempts
at imitation.
City people, on the other hand, are ridden by
all sorts of strange inhibitions about appearance and tend thereby to lose
their distinctiveness, he says.
The Rockwells go to the village square dances and at one of them
Rockwell spotted a youngster named Bob Buck.
Buck straightway be-
came
the model
for a
Willie

so popular that
Rockwell made it into a series.

times,

for one another or
borrow one another's children as models.
For instance, on the

The Four Freedoms series turned out to be one of the hardest jobs
Rockwell ever tackled and he lost ten pounds working on the idea. The
idea came to him at three o'clock one morning, when he awoke suddenly,
flipped by a fear that people were saying. "Oh. yeah, the Four Free-
doms." without actually understanding their implications. He tried to
get back to sleep, but without success, and at five he dressed and went to
the studio, where he sketched
trial approaches to the concepts.
Later.
still
in a state of inner excitement, he telephoned Mead Schaeffer and
got him excited too. The upshot of their discussion was a trip to Wash-
ington, where Rockwell tried like a demon to give his idea to the Gov-
ernment, and Schaeffer faithfully seconded him.
For two days they were
shunted from bureau to bureau and didn't succeed in raising the blood
pressure of a single bureaucrat.
After a couple of days of this, they de-
cided
their expedition was a flop and headed sadly for home.
As the
train neared
Philadelphia,
Rockwell's face lighted up.
"The
Post,
of
course," he said. "Why didn't I think of it before?"
It was the only time in Rockwell's career that he didn't think of the
Post
first.
If the Post's rival had been another jade of a magazine, the
editors would have been sore, but they didn't mind being second choice
to
a Government
at work on a war.
Since the war came
to an end
Rockwell has been busy on Post covers, and in between these assignments
he has been recording in paint and charcoal high spots in the lives of the
Common
(i.e.,
the Ordinary)
Man, which
the
Post
publishes
as
art
spreads.
Some of these, such as the one on a Ration Board's activities,
were completed before the end of the war.
Others, including the widely-
acclaimed spread on a da\
in the
life of a country editor, are products
of the post-war Rockwell. A note common to almost
all of Rockwell's
spreads
is
that
they deal with
life
in
the middle areas of the United
States,
.i
region
in which he
feels as much
at home as he does
in
his
adopted state of Vermont. An exception
is a spread he did on the wait-
ing room of a maternity hospital
in which the sorrows of expectant fath-
ers were graphically
portrayed.
That waiting room could exist
in New
York Cit\
oi
Seattle as well as
in the corn belt, and
it doubdess does.

By Way oj Prologue
We are going on a personal
visit
to Norman Rockwell.
Through the
pages of this book we'll meet the noted artist face to face; we'll say hello
to
his wife and
fa?nily—take a quick glance at
his house and
its sur-
roundings.
We'll walk into his studio and stay as long as we like, poking
around
at
leisure, examining every nook and cranny.
We'll see some
of his recent drawings and paintings and thumb through many examples
of
his
previous
work,
including
every Saturday Evening
Post
cover
which he has painted in thirty years of prolific production.
Best of all, we'll look over his shoulder as he paints a magazine cover,
watching him hour
after hour, asking questions, listening
to
his com-
ments, learning precisely how he accomplishes every step from the con-
ception of the original idea until the final painting is ready for delivery.
Rockwell will even
tell us what brushes, canvases, paints, mediums and
varnishes he prefers and exactly how he employs them. We
will also
discover how he does other types of work—book and magazine illustra-
tions, advertising art, murals and portraits.
At times we'll accompany him as he wanders here and there round-
ing up his models and accumulating props. And on these trips, as well
as in the studio, we'll hear from his own lips not only some of his amus-
ing and illuminating experiences but why he paints as he does, divining
the thinking behind his doing.

Though
city borx and
bred. Xorman Rockwell has for some years
chosen
to
live and work
just
outside
the Green Mountain
village
of
Arlington. Vermont.
It's hard to say which
is the more fortunate. Ar-
lington or Rockwell.
It
is certainly a compliment to the
little village
and
to the State of Vermont
that
this much-travelled
artist, familiar
with
all America and
possessing
the freedom
to
live anywhere,
has
selected this peaceful spot in a perfect corner of one of America's most
beautiful states.
"As long as my fundamental purpose is to interpret the typical Ameri-
can," says Rockwell. ''Arlington affords the ideal residence.
From this
calm vantage point,
far from the
cities with their crowds and clamor,
I can view things with detachment and serenity; also. I can go about my
task with a minimum of interruption and with the knowledge that right
here are exactly the models needed for my purpose—the sincere, honest,
homespun types that I love to paint."
In point
of time. Rockwell
is by no means
far removed from New
York and Philadelphia,
to which
in the course of his business he must
frequently go.
By rail, or on any of several excellent highways, he can
reach either within a day.
A particularly lovely drive from New York
City to Arlington
is via Route
7.
If we take this road north—we pick
it up by cutting across into Connecticut or Massachusetts—we will pass
successively
through
such
delightful
Berkshire communities
as Great
Barrington. Stockbridge and Pittsfield.

itself
through
Williamstown
and
across
the
Massachusetts-Vermont
border, we will have feasted upon some of the loveliest of New England's
rugged landscape.
Still driving north through
historic Bennington—an attractive Ver-
mont
city with
its college and superbly located battle monument— it
is
but a matter of minutes before Arlington comes into view.
Gradually
the farm-checkered valleys have narrowed as the surrounding hills have
grown
in number and
stature, shouldering higher and higher against
the sky.
Arlington
village, with
its broad and shady
streets,
its
substantial,
well-kept
houses,
its
stately
old
inn and
its notable church with an
ancient burying ground, has for years been the residence of many dis-
tinguished
artists and authors.
Today there
is
little
in
this quiet spot
to remind us that
it was the stamping ground of boisterous, courageous
Ethan
Allen and
his
hell-raising,
ready-for-a-scrap Green Mountain
Boys of Ticonderoga fame.
Vet in this very place, nearly two centuries
ago.
Ethan's
lustily shouted
battle
cry was often
heard,
a monstrous
bellow from mighty lungs that brought his clan a-running. whether the
enemy consisted of the British or the equally detested "Yorkers" to the
west.
But enough for Arlington proper, for we are impatient to meet Rock-
well, who
lives at West Arlington a few miles away.
So just north of
the churchyard we turn
left from Arlington's main
street onto Route
313.
Almost
at once the village dwindles and the drive becomes more
intimate,
the road
skirting
the
Batten
Kill,
a winding stream which
busily works
its way toward the Hudson some thirty miles distant, well
over the New York State line.
And so on we roll past a scattering of houses, past the West Arlington
store
the storekeeper standing
in the doorway looks familiar-
he must
be one of Rockwell's models),
past
the Sandgate toad
(on which

at
length, having
fol-

for some minutes, we find ourselves with
almost

a

bridge

date 1852.
This bridge bears sharply away from the river road to span
the Kill.
We brake for the sudden turn and dive into the dark tunnel;
it's good to hear the planks rattle as we dash through.
Before us the road now intersects a green.
At our immediate right
stands an old church,
still in use; attached to
it
is the Grange hall.
At
our
left
is
the more modern, but appropriately modest,
schoolhouse.
Straight ahead we note a
pair
of
stately Colonial farmhouses almost
identical
in design.
That
at the right
is Rockwell's.
Our journey
is
over.
As we approach the house we discover Peter Rockwell—the youngest
son, aged ten—playing on the lawn, marvelously accoutred with Wild
West weapons.
He clanks away to announce our arrival and, by the
time we reach the porch. Mrs. Rockwell is there to welcome us.
In the
midst of our greetings the
artist himself appears, summoned from his
studio behind the house.
Accompanying him are Tom and Jerry, his
other sons, thirteen and fifteen respectively, and a couple of dogs from
the Edgertons' next door—there
is always
at
least one dog about the
place.
Introductions follow and we pass on into the house.
When you meet Rockwell
for the
first time several things are quite
likely
to impress you
:
First,
he's
just an everyday
sort of fellow.
It
wouldn't be surprising to discover that Norman's head had been some-
what
turned by
all
the
adulation
that
his
pre-eminent
position
has
brought him over the years.
But no.
He
is extremely modest.
He
is
also
sincere;
there's no sham
or
pretense
about
him.
And
he's
as
friendly as he
is sincere
; the moment you meet him his warm handclasp
and ready smile, plus the merry twinkle in his eye. win you completely.
Soon vou feel that vou have known him for \ ears.

36
XORMAX ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
As to physical characteristics, there
is little we need add to what our
photographs reveal.
Rockwell misses being a six footer by only half an
inch.
He
is lean and wiry, quick as to movement, and. when painting,
wears blue jeans and a flannel shirt, the everyday work clothes common
to his neighborhood.
One thing that
strikes you immediately
is Norman's boyishness,
his
exuberant
attitude toward
life.
Though
past
the
half-century mark
in
years,
in
a
certain admirable sense he has never quite grown up.
Possessing not only physical
vitality but a whiplash mind, he exhibits
enthusiasm
for everything he does.
In his conversation he reveals his
youthful point of view:
his observations are both keen and stimulating,
and they are delivered with an effervescence that
is all too rare in peo-
ple of any age.
Even in weighty discussions his conversation
is
full of
w it and anecdote.
He likes the dry and homely idiom of the Vermont
countryside and employs
it tellingly.
Rockwell loves fun.
Although an extremely serious fellow at his easel
—he
has an amazing
capacity
for
sustained
effort—he
extracts
an
unusual amount of joy from
life.
In moments of relaxation he
fairly
bubbles over with good spirits and, even as he paints, he
is ready for a
laugh at any comical situation which may arise.
All of this
is reflected
in his pictures, and accounts for much of their appeal.
The Rockwell
family
life
quite naturally
revolves around Norman
and
his work.
During rush
periods,
especially
as he approaches
his
important delivery deadlines, he
is kept as free as possible from need-
less interruptions.
Now and then he finds a moment to play ball with
the boys or to pit his skill with a .22 calibre rifle against theirs, but that's
about
all.
The boys arc well
able
to look
after themselves, however,
for with games and
sports, including fishing in the Kill, they lead
the
normal
lives
of country boys everywhere.
They are learning
that
life

A
VISIT TO ROCKWELL'S
STUDIO
the summer and Tommy earns his spending money by mowing neigh-
bors' lawns.
The Rockwells really belong to Arlington; they greatly enjoy taking
an active
part
in
its
affairs.
One evening while
I w as visiting them.
Norman collected tickets at the village square dance: he is on the dance
committee.
Meanwhile
his wife. Mary, helped with the refreshments.
This is typical of their cooperative interest in all such things.
Xow
for
a
quick
look
at
Rockwell's
house;
then
we'll
go on
to
the
studio.
The house, dating from
1792.
is exactly what you would
expect, knowing
its
occupants and
its Vermont
heritage—an ample
wooden
farmhouse,
painted
white,
of
that
chaste, impeccable design
and sturdy construction that our New England forefathers mysteriously
managed to achieve.
Before the Rockwells occupied the place in 1943.
soon after
fire had destroyed the studio at their former Arlington
resi-
dence a few miles
to the
east,
the house was thoroughly and sympa-
thetically remodelled.
The
interior walls are covered with reproduc-
tions of ancient wallpapers, an ideal background for the furniture which
is Early American blended with
a few pieces of Victorian.
Some of
these pieces have a familiar air; they have served as models in Rock-
well paintings.
The pictures on the walls are notable, being originals by such artists
as Arthur Rackham, Howard Pyle, Hugh Thomson, C. E. Brock. A. B.
Frost, Edmund Dulac, Walter Addison and Thomas Fogarty.
Conspicuous as one enters the living room from the hall are a large
south window facing the studio and, on the west wall opposite the en-
trance, a generous fireplace which in that country
is essential to com-
fort even in summertime.
Like the rest of the house,
this room has a
pleasant,
lived-in appearance with
its abundance of books and maga-
zines and comfortable places
to
sit and read.
Just now, one end has
taken on a studio look, for Tommy
is showing an interest in drawing;
his father has
set up an easel and
is coaching him in the rudiments.
At
this end of the room.
too. has been placed an old-fashioned parlor
pump-organ which Peter recently won on a ten-cent chance at a local
raffle.
So there, side bv side, the bovs are soins: in for the fine arts.

NORMAN ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
Across the hall
lies the dining room, and back of this
is Mary Rock-
u ell's study.
This
is an important room, for here she keeps
the family
accounts and helps her artist-husband in a hundred and one other ways.
It
is here that Rockwell's fan mail
is sorted and read.
Rockwell, either
directly or through The Saturday Evening Post, receives an astonishing
amount
of such
mail.
His April Fool cover of April
3,
1943. brought
thousands of
letters, a number exceeded only by the avalanche which
followed the publication of the "Four Freedoms'* paintings.
Norman
greatly enjoys
this fan mail.
The
arrival
of the rural de-
livery man often
finds him
at the house
for a brief respite, a "coke"
and a look through his letters.
"When you plug away pretty much by
yourself as
I do," he says, "you don't know what your public's reaction
to a new job may be
until your fan mail starts to arrive.
I look
for-
ward
to
it eagerly;
if
I don't get any for four or five days
I really feel
hurt.
After
all, any
artist works
for public acknowledgment and ap-
preciation—at least I do.
I love
it and fairly lap it up."
But now to Rockwell's studio, the workshop in which he creates his
paintings.
We can
stroll
out
via
the
flagstone walk which winds
its
way past the smokehouse, garage, and a corncrib. now converted into
a shed for storing garden utensils and the family bicycles.
The studio
is a somewhat
barn-iike
structure,
red with white
trim.
It
looks
so
seasoned—so much
in harmony with the other buildings near by—that
it
is hard to realize that
it is relativclv new
.
IN

Though Norman made light of his fire (forgive pun) h) im-
mediately doing these sketches for the Post,
it was actually a
severe
blow— it

Of this area, the main studio room occupies the greater portion, being
23 feet wide by 25 feet long.
It is open to the roof.
The entrance door
is on
the
cast side toward the
front.
Rockwell
tells of a time when he needed a horse as a model for one of his pictures
and was faced with the task of getting him through this door.
"I bor-
rowed
the horse from a neighbor," he
relates, "and then we
tried
to
lead him into the studio.
Did you ever attempt to get a horse through
a normal-sized door?
Well,
it's not
easy.
It took four of
us, one
at
the head to pull, one at the
tail to push, and one at each side to com-
press his belly.
It was a sort of battle of the bulge
!
Finally we got him
past
the jamb, and he snapped back
to natural
size again.
Once
in-
side, and expanded
to his
full proportion, he looked simply enormous.
You never realize how big a horse
is until you see one in the middle of
your own room."
The studio window
at
the north
starts some three and
a
half
feet
from the floor and
is eleven feet high.
It
is double-glazed to keep out

The lower part
is covered with a curtain, creating a semi-
top

II:
yiow Rockwell Paints
a Post Cover
Wherever Rockwell
goes,
there
is one
question which
is almost
in-
variably asked by layman and
artist
alike:
"Tell me. Mr. Rockwell,
how do you paint a Post cover?"
Here
is the answer in the form of a complete series of drawings and
paintings made by the
artist in producing his cover picture for August
3,
1946.
These illustrate, step by step, Norman's process from the con-
ception
of
his idea
until the delivery of
his painting.
In the accom-
panying captions, the artist describes the procedure in his own words.
Those who desire a more detailed account are referred
to Chapter
IX. "Rockwell's Creative and Technical Procedure.'" which deals fully
with
his materials and
painting methods.
It
also
includes a
discus-
sion of many of the diverse problems of the cover
artist, and ways in
which Rockwell solves them.
RIGHT:
THE ORIGINAL IDEA SKETCH
The
first job
is to
bit on a good idea.

one
for

cover.
I made
the accompanying rough
sketch
at
this exact

Then
I took
it to the

and Ken Stuart okayed
it.

countryside

other
things I needed.

After hunting up a suitable model for the rocking chair loafer.
I returned to

where
I posed and sketched him.
In

I should explain that when

I never take them myself, though
I direct them.
There are
too many other things for me
to be doing.)

PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA
For twenty-three years
I did all of my drawing and
painting without any help from the camera. Even to-
day
I often work without photographs,
yet
I have
found
that
if
they
are
properly
utilized
they
can
sometimes prove an
invaluable
aid.
Practically
all
illustrators
use them
to some
extent.
I
feel
very
strongly,
however,
that
no
one
should
resort
to
photographs until he has learned to draw and paint
extremely well without them.
If eventually he turns
to the camera as a supplementary tool, he will find it
especially helpful in recording transient effects,
diffi-
cult
poses, and subject matter far from the studio.
We shall deal with all this as we go along, particu-
larly on pages 198-200. Chapter IX.

III:
Some Come
Easy-. Some Come "Hard
We have seen
in the previous chapter that Rockwell
follows a very
definite
step-by-step
procedure
in
painting
his
covers.
This
enables
him not only to obtain better results, but to save an immense amount
of time and energy.
At
best, however, almost any cover requires many more hours than
the layman would imagine.
Practically never can one be painted in
less than a week from the time the idea has been settled upon; some-
times a month or more is needed.
Let's take a look at the history of the painting of two covers, one of
which might be called a "quick and easy" cover, as
it was carried for-
ward rapidly without
a
hitch, while the other proved
to be
a "slow
and hard" cover, in that
it not only demanded far more time, but even
in the end didn't work out as intended.
The
first of
this pair—it took only a few
days to complete
it—was
the charwomen subject reproduced on page 57:
this appeared on the
Post for April
6,
1946.
I asked Norman how he got the idea.
"Gee,
I don't know," he
replied.
"It just came
to me.
I think
I have
al-
ways wanted
to paint a charwoman or some similar type of worker
the poor
little drudge who has to tidy up after more fortunate people
have had a good time.
I've been interested in the hotel maid, for in-
stance, who has to lay out her ladyship's gown; in reality the maid may
be more of a lady—but let's not get into the social angle.

SOME COME EASY!
SOME COME HARD
55
was a logical setting.
I made my little idea sketch.
As soon as Kenneth
Stuart, Art Editor of The Saturday Evening Post, had okayed
this,
I
decided
to go to an actual theatre to obtain authentic information on
such things as seats and aisles.
I wanted my data in the form of sketches
and photographs which
I could use later in my studio as reference ma-
terial.
So
I went
to the office of the Shubert Theatres in New York.
I had supposed that
it would be simple
to learn just where
to go to
sketch and photograph
the empty
seats;
it
looked
like
a
job which
could be completed in an hour or two.
Actually
it took a
lot longer.
The physical properties manager felt that the Majestic Theatre, where
Carousel was
playing, was
typical,
so we decided on
that.
A minor
hitch came when
I learned that just
to turn on the lights would cost
about forty dollars.
(It seems there
is a Union requirement that a full
force of electricians and their assistants must be paid a day's wages to
switch on even one
light.
After considerable negotiation, a way was
found to reduce this force to one electrician and his assistant.
)
"With
this adjusted,
off we went to the Majestic, where
I sketched
and measured
while
a
photographer
took some
pictures—one
never
knows how much information he may need when he gets to work far
from
his original source.
Everybody was very accommodating.
Then
back
I hurried to Arlington where two neighbors, Mrs. Harvey McKee
and
Mrs.
Charles
Crofut,
posed
as
the charwomen.
I
felt
hesitant
about asking them to represent such humble characters, but they were
very good sports about
it.
"My task as
I went ahead with my studies and
final painting was
mainly one of orienting the figures to the theatre
interior.
Every de-
tail must be
right; my audience
is
supercritical.
After
the
painting
was published, a reader wrote to ask why

NORMAN ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
Now
let us contrast with the above forthright procedure, the round-
about ramblings required
in producing our "slow and
hard*' cover
that
for Thanksgiving.
1945.
I shall describe these ramblings at some
length
in
order
to emphasize
several
pertinent
points:
that such an
artist
as Rockwell often
finds
it advisable
to go a long distance from
home
for
his
setting and characters; that even the most
skillful
illus-
trator frequently has to struggle to obtain a satisfactory result
in time
to meet
his
deadline;
that
the metamorphosis from
the
initial
idea
sketch
to the
final painting
is not always as simple and predictable as
the casual reader might imagine.
In
August,
1945,
Rockwell was ready
to begin
this Thanksgiving
cover.
By way of a change from his familiar Vermont, he decided to
visit Maine
for his setting and characters.
Knowing that
I originally
came from Maine and was free at the moment, he invited me to join him.
The week's
trip proved more
thrilling than either of us had
antici-
pated.
First,
it was a job to round up enough gas coupons.
But finally
we had them and on Tuesday, the 14th, we headed for the coast.
The
beginning of the drive was pleasant but uneventful, though by the time
we reached Portsmouth, N. H., the rear of our car was filled with an-
tiques—notably a miniature desk—which Norman had acquired along
the way as props for future paintings.
But now
the excitement
started!
We had crossed
the bridge
into
Kitten, Maine, and were headed north somewhere between Ogunquit
and Wells when,
at seven o'clock, news came of Japan's capitulation.
Autos
suddenly
appeared
in amazing
numbers,
their
horns
blaring;
village church and school bells started clanging; sirens shrilled.
Towns-
people rushed onto their porches and into the streets, laughing, shout-
ing, waving
flags.
Hitchhikers sought
the larger
centers, which were
soon
filled with
celebrating
throngs.
Kenncbunk was bedlam: Bidde-
lord and Saco
(pronounced "socko"
well-nigh impassable, with
mill
whistles and
lire sirens adding to the unearthb din.
It was worth one's
life
to drive,
yet,
with
horn
screaming, we
kept
on.
It was
all meat
fun;
a momentous hour.
Nevertheless
it was with something of
relief
that we abandoned Route

us
to the
relative quiet of the shore and
to our day's destination, the
Bay View Lodge.
But
it was no time
to remain quiet; history was
in the making:
so
half an hour later we were back on the main road, soon to enjoy one
of those shore dinners
for which The Cascades
is famous.
With the
inner man appeased, Norman, ever interested in the reactions of people
(he
sees everything as a possible Post cover), suggested that we loop
through the heart of near-by Old Orchard Beach—Maine's Coney Island.
This we did.
To our surprise, though night had now fallen all amuse-
ment
places were
closed,
the
customary
strident
sounds and

Not that the place was dark

sweethearts.
Autos worried
their way
along, dragging
tin cans and

boilers.
Trucks came and went,
filled
to overflowing with sing-
^
ing, shouting merrymakers.
But gradually the excitement passed; we
returned to the Lodge, took a short walk along the beach, and the first
day of our Post cover forage was over.
Never was a morning more nearly perfect than that of Wednesday,
August
15th.
After our eggs
(and, amazingly, bacon!) we drove
to
Portland in search of a photographer, as Norman would require some
photographic data
to supplement such
notes,
sketches and
studies
as
he might make.
There, the street sweepers were endeavoring to reduce
the piles of paper which marked the celebration of the night before
a good cover idea
if
it could have been instantaneously
utilized.
But
soon we discovered that Portland,
like the
rest of America, was on a
two day holiday, photographers and
all,
so our project was of neces-
sity postponed.
Norman had long planned a pilgrimage to Winslow Homer's studio
at Prout's Neck, a few miles from Portland,
so. to use our time to ad-
vantage, out to the Neck we drove, pausing at the one and only store
to inquire our way.
While
I was
at the phone. Norman chanced
to
overhear a customer mention his familiaritv with Prout's Neck.
"Per-

haps."
Normal
inquired,
''you
can
direct me
to Window
Homer's
studio?"
"I am it!" came the booming but friendly reply.
"You aren't the deceased Homer himself?"
"No,
but
his nephew
Charles Homer.
I occupy Uncle Window's
studio.
It's only a step away."
So Norman introduced himself, and me. and soon we were seated in
the great master's
living room,
still maintained much
as
it had been
in
his day.
There
for an hour we were regaled with rare anecdotes
of the noted artist—stories extremely well told by our most genial host.
Many of these have never been published; and.
alas, some cannot be,
though we were told that several will appear in a forthcoming volume on
Homer by
Professor Beam
of Bowdoin
College.
We hope
so.
For
these incidents tend to correct the long-established but apparently erro-
neous notion that Homer—at any rate in his later life—was chronically
irascible.
Instead he enjoyed a good joke; he loved a good time. With
a touch of whimsy he once painted with
his own brush a sign which
his nephew showed us, to be set up on occasion beside the path leading
to his sketching grounds.
It reads, "Snakes!
Snakes!
Mice!"
I was
particularly glad
to discover
this side
of Homer's character,
for once

I

to watch him
at

only
to be

When at last we
left Prout's Neck
it was to enjoy, as we drove west
across the Scarboro marshes,
a
fiery
sunset, magnified by myriad
re-
flections in each bend of the little meandering tide streams.
But such pleasures of the traveller are almost certain to be tempered
occasionally by trouble or inconvenience.
Scarcely had the sunset faded
when we were confronted with an unexpected eating problem.
Driving
merrily back to The Cascades, our mouths watering for another shore
dinner, we were
refused
admittance though
it was
still
well
before
closing hour.
The demands of the unexpected holiday had exhausted
the food supply—far from surprising, for we soon discovered that many
other restaurants had been forced to close.
I might almost say that "all" restaurants were closed, for now started
a two hour search
for something to
eat.
Finally,
at the entrance to
one well-known place the
hostess locked the door
as we approached.
In desperation,
I decided to resort to strategy.
Not knowing the hostess
from Eve,
I nevertheless hurried around to the side porch, where
1 ac-
costed a chair-tilting old gentleman who seemed to belong to the place.
"Is Suzie in?
The hostess?"
I asked.
"I'm Guppy from out to Gor-
ham."
( I was raised in Gorham, not many miles away.
)
"She's not Suzie.
She's Abbie.
Abbie Smith.
I'll see
if
I can get
her," and
pulling
himself from
his chair with evident
reluctance he
ambled away.
And soon Abbie appeared, obviously tired.
"Abbie."
I
lied, standing
in the shadow to hide my face, and giving her no chance to say a word,
"You remember me.
I'm Guppy from
out
to Gorham.
You
can't
guess who's with me in the car?
Norman Rockwell!
The artist who
does all the Saturday Evening Post covers—the Four Freedoms posters.
You know—famous!
I got him to Maine to do a Post cover showing
Maine hospitality.
And we just can't find any Maine hospitality.
He's
hungry.
I'm hungry.
Every place
is closed.
Abbie. he's all for going
back to Portsmouth to eat.
That would mean a New Hampshire Post
cover.
Abbie.

I delivered
all
this at top speed.
At the end she sighed, "Well,

you'll have
to bring him
in; come around
this back way.
I
shouldn't do it.
You may have to wait."
And wait we did. but not for long.
And what a feast
!
Then Nor-
man autographed paper napkins for Abbie and the
girls, and soon we
were back at the Lodge.
By now we had learned with pleasure that the command.
"Fill her
up!" had again come
into use and

from Robert P. Tristram Coffin—Maine's noted poet, author and artist
—in
discovering

While Rockwell and
I
felt certain that a man who had written books

scarcely prepared for the unusually interesting house to which he con-

of
the
period
1780- 1875.
These were
built
in
sight
of the house,
several of them
right beside
it. with the
lines
at-
tached
to
trees which
still stand.
The house, dating from
1837. has
been occupied by
five
successive generations of Pennells.
At present
it
is the summer home of Andrew Pennell. a Bath banker, and his wife
Alice, who
is Dr. Coffin's sister.
^It
is their daughter Arline and their
son Carroll who appear
in our photographs, the
latter pointing to his
fifth generation picture.)
Every room of this sturdy old house, with
its fine period furnishings
and decoration, would delight the heart of the antiquarian.
But Nor-
man was impatient to be shown into the kitchen.
What a gem it proved
to be, with
its elaborately ornamented kitchen range set before a brick
oven of
still earlier date—the latter flanked by a built-in caldron.
Al-
most every detail was fascinating—the brass fog horn on the wall
(still
used to call the family to dinner), the decoy ducks, old flatirons, kero-
sene lamp and candles.
But
since
the
late
afternoon
light was
ill-suited
to
sketching and
photography, and
as Rockwell had
not
as
yet chosen people
to pose
for him. back we hurried
to Brunswick,
the immediate aim being to
round up the right type of soldier to pose for the ex-serviceman.
First
came a visit to the USO, where the hostess. Miss Bangs, was most coop-
erative, repeatedly telephoning
for us and serving as our guide as we

Still later. Norman and
I stood on street corners seeking our
prey; we hung around
the Moulton Union
at Bowdoin while dozens
of
service men had
their
evening meal; we
drove
slowly along
the
streets,
scanning
faces.
At
length Norman concluded

do.
So again we drove to the
Coffins'.
Richard
consented, and now the problem was to find a uniform to fit him.
After
an hour or more we discovered and borrowed one from a veteran re-
cently back from overseas.
The
rest proved
easy.
Mrs. Pennell consented to pose as the boy's
mother and Mr. Coffin agreed to act in any desired capacity
if called
upon; so with the hour set for a morning rendezvous, we drove to the
Eagle Hotel for a belated dinner.
The next morning—Friday—we shopped
for

picking up
Shelley,
our
photographer,
were
soon
off for the Pennell home.
There we found that Mrs. Pennell. throwing
herself wholeheartedly into the thing, had baked a pie and some pans
of raised
biscuits.
She even had steam up in the kettle
!
All we lacked
was a turke\
!
Norman now sprang into action-—he was
all over the place.
There
was hardly time for him to make his customary sketches and studies
he must strive for an adequate photographic record.
First he worked
with
Shelley,
to determine the camera's
position.
Next Richard was
posed
this way and that, amidst a bombardment of good-natured com-
mands: "Toe in!
No!
Try your feet on the chair rung.
Good!
Now
raise your elbow.
Relax!
Lean forward!
Look lovingly at that imagi-
nary
turkey;
that's right, keep your eye on the
little birdie!
Lean for-
ward
still more!
Get your
knife on that
potato!
Relax!
Stick out
your chin!
That's
right!
Hold
it
there!
Hold
it!"
And back and
forth Norman
darted between camera and
model, sometimes
taking
Richard's
place
in the chair
in order to demonstrate the desired
atti-
tude.
Shelley had
plenty
to do.
too.
Before each exposure he
tested
with
his light meter;
his job was far from easy, as he was working from
too
close
a
position and with natural
light—Norman wanted no
flash
bulbs to create artificial effects.
In
the meantime,
the
rest
of us perched around, enjoying ourselves
and
tossing
far-from-helpful comments
to and
fro,
until
at
lasl
poor
Richard, somewhat
the worse
for wear, was released.
Now, much the
same performance was repeated with Alice Pennell. while the spectators

reflectors

light.
Finally came shots
of Dr. Coffin, and others of the background alone.
The reader might wonder at the need for such careful photography.
since
the
illustrator customarily takes many
liberties with
his subject
matter when he
starts
to paint.
Yet the reason
is obvious
if
it
is re-
membered that in
this case the actual cover was to be executed hun-
dreds of miles from the scene, making
it necessary to record everything
which could conceivably be needed.
Then, too, Rockwell usually paints
with
almost photographic
realism,
so no matter how many changes
in form and tone he may ultimately make from his photographs, they
must nevertheless be very true
as to detail
if they are to be of much
help.
It was about noon when,
the photography finished, we offered the
Pennells and
Coffins our thanks and our adieus.
It would be a
full
day before Shelley could develop his film and deliver the prints.
The
war was over, gas available, the weather perfect,
so why not take to
the broad highway once more?
Therefore we sought Route
1
again,
and
rolled "down
east"
to
Cherry-field,
not
far from
the Canadian
border.
Here we spent the night with my uncle, Frank Stewart, and
his family.
The
next
afternoon—following
a
morning's
visit
to
thousands
of
acres of blueberry "barrens" near Cherryfield, and a tour through one
of the Stewart canning factories—we returned to Brunswick to pick up
the photographs seen in
this chapter, and many more.
The purpose
of our trip accomplished, we now headed for Arlington via the White
Mountains
of New Hampshire.
On Sunday,
after
a
pleasant jaunt
through the mountains, we reached the valley of the Connecticut River
down which we drove
to
Brattleboro.
Our
1300 mile
circuit com-
pleted, another hour saw us over the Molly Stark Trail to Bennington;
from there we drove to Arlington in ample time for Norman to obtain
a good night's rest before starting his cover on Monday morning.
Alas, the
trials of the cover artist!
In the days immediately follow-
ing, Norman labored
assiduously
to convert
all
this Maine
material
into an acceptable Post cover.
Study after study was made, but nothing

went
right.
First,
the perspective angle proved disappointingly sharp
—the camera had. as we have seen, been very close.
Then
it was de-
cided that Richard Coffin showed too few signs of strain for a returned
veteran.
A young man
better
suited
to the
cast was rounded up
at
Arlington; new photographs were made, and new
studies.
Still
the
thing was
all
wrong.
Perhaps
Mrs.
Pennell
wasn't
quite
the
old-
fashioned type one would expect
to find
in such a kitchen?
Another
substitute model was chosen, posed, and photographed.
More studies
weir undertaken, along with a
full-size charcoal layout. A final draw-
ing was now done on canvas.
But
the longer Rockwell worked the more discouraged he became.
The figures faced
the wrong way
like actors turning from their audi-
ence
; there were too many opposing lines, too many confusing elements
of detail.
The whole thing appeared staged and photographic; Nor-
man couldn't break away sufficiently from his reference material. Time
u as running short
; nerves were frayed.
So
in desperation, with only a few days
to
his deadline,
the
artist
started
afresh.
He threw overboard
all
that had
resulted from
that
week's hunting
in Maine; nothing was
left but
his basic idea.
A new
setting was arranged
in
his studio.
New models—local people—were
posed; new
sketches and
studies were hurried
through.
At
last
the
subject was on the canvas; the work was pushed forward at
full speed:
the final stroke was completed only in time to rush the cover to the Post.

^Magazine Illustration
While Rockwell
is best known for his Post covers, these have by no
means been his only work, for over the years he has executed an aston-
ishing number of other commissions in a wide variety of fields.
There
have been covers for other magazines,
for instance, and almost endless
'"undercover"
illustrations,
not
only
in
the
Post, but
in The Country
Gentleman, Ladies' Home Journal, Woman's Home Companion, Mr-
Call's, American Magazine, and the old Life and Judge.
Yet young Rockwell
really got
his
start by
illustrating books.
In
191 1, through the noted illustrator, Thomas Fogarty (one of his teach-
ers
at
the
Art
Students
League),
the
seventeen-year-old
artist met
Conde Nast, who gave him his
first professional break by commission-
ing him
to
illustrate
a volume called Tell Me Why Stories.
Also,
at
about that time he did an illustration for the American Book Company
for a volume on Samuel de Champlain.

as an
early—perhaps
his
very
first—published
drawing.
"I had a
terrible time with
this." he
recalls.
"I didn't know enough
about perspective to show the river lower than the parapet on which
Champlain stands."
His next job was to illustrate a book on camping, hunting and
fish-
ing.
Edward
Cave,
Editor
of
Boy's
Life—the
official organ
of
the
Boy Scouts of America—was the author.
Norman wasn't much of an
outdoor man so the subject was new to him, yet he produced authori-
tative pen drawings demonstrating such
skills of outdoor
life as pack-
ing a burro and carrying a canoe.
His success with
this led him to the magazine field and his
first sal-
aried position, Art Editor of Boy's Life.
Here he spent one day every
week accepting or rejecting submitted illustrations (including his own).
He
also did the covers and illustrated two stories for each
issue.
To
supplement
his meager income from
this, he produced covers and
il-
lustrations
for
other
boys'
and
children's
magazines
St.
Nicholas,
American Boy, Youth's Companion and Everyland.
He likewise
illus-
trated some books by Ralph Henry Barbour,
including Four
Afloat,
Onward and Forward and The Crimson Sweater.
This, then, was his start.
Scarcely had he come of age when, in 191 6,
he landed on the Post, thus completing what he calls "my journey from
pillow to Post."
By this time he was also working regularly for other
front-line
publications,
doing
both
covers and
illustrations.
Adver-
tising demanded more and more
of
his
effort,
too.
At an age when
most young men are leaving college, Norman already ranked as one of
America's leading illustrators.
It would be pointless
to recount
his whole career from that day
to
this, for his published work itself affords an adequate record.
Enough
to say that each passing year found him more sure of himself, and more
firmly entrenched
as a
top-flight man.
For a long period
there was
scarcely a leading publication that didn't carry
its quota of Rockwell
illustrations in charcoal, crayon, pen-and-ink. wash, or color.

pondered. "Sunset Avenue:
I don't seem
to ...
in just what section
of the city is that?"
Things were getting pretty hot for Norman; sweat
moistened his brow.
But he wasn't licked yet
!
"Why, out in the Sun-
set section." he extemporized.
"Sunset section?" mused Bradley.
He
wheeled around in his chair and stood up.
"Just a minute," he said.
"Let me go inside and get my map!"'
That was too much for Norman.
When
the door
closed behind
Bradley,
the young fibber grabbed up
his pictures and
fled
to the elevator.
Safe in the lobby he discovered
he had left his hat—with the label of a New York store
And so young Rockwell went the rounds, trying out his schemes for
selling, learning the tricks of the trade.
Gradually he disposed of more
and more work, and bit by bit his already substantial reputation grew.
After his first covers appeared on the Post, he was in frequent commu-
nication
with
its
editors,
often by
phone.
He was
sharing
a New
Rochelle
studio with
his
friend, Clyde Forsythe.
"I was
really awe-
inspired over the Post business," he says, "terribly impressed and abso-
lutely
afraid
of the
editors.
They would
call me from Philadelphia
by
long
distance, and
it always made me so excited
I could
scarcely
hear or speak.
Clyde, or 'Vic,' as he was called, was a very good mimic
and an
inveterate
joker.
He knew
this weakness of mine and would
call me up from outside the studio and say, 'This is Walter H. Dower of
The Saturday Evening Post speaking.'
Immediately.
I would get
all
jittery, scared half to death, and stutter. 'V-V-Ves. Mr. Dower." and then
Vic would come back with some remark
that can't be quoted.
One
da) when Vic was out, the telephone rang and a voice
said. 'This
is
Walter H. Dower speaking,'
'Oh.
is
it?'
I shouted.
"Well, you old son-
of-a-gun, you can go straight
to

Rockwell was not cut out to be an illustrator of the popular boy and
girl type of periodical literature.
He had no interest in painting pretty
faces, and he admits that no matter how seductive he might try to pic-
ture women—and he
did
try—they always turned
out
to look more
like a fellow's mother or sister.

the best that was in him.
This, unlike frothy light romance, was solid;
it gave him something to put his teeth into.
His handling of the hospital waiting room subject (page 84) which
ran in the Post reflects his whole attitude toward illustration;
it points
up his insistence upon making his own commentary on life rather than
merely
picturing
incidents
lifted from an author's manuscript.
That
story was about two boys on a bicycle trip.
There was bare mention of
the fact that one of them, a year before, had anxiously sat in a hospital
waiting room.
The
tense atmosphere
of that situation and the reac-
tion of three people to
it represented something so significant in human
behavior that Rockwell, always the philosopher, could not pass
it up.
Such independence, however, drives authors crazy; they are more
in-
terested in the illustrator's skill with a brush than in his philosophy!
We have just called Rockwell philosopher; perhaps "historian" would
be more accurate, although
his canvases that depict the current scene
go far beyond graphic reports of
its customs and manners.
They de-
rive their incentive from the
artist's emotional kinship with the people
he portrays—his response to the spirit with which they meet life's mani-
fold problems.
If they attract us at
first by their picturesqueness. they

The Post sent me to the White House, where

Everything

portrayed realistically.
I made all of these illustrations twice, the first set being
destroyed in my
fire.
These small engravings give only a
hint at the much

NORM AX ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
soon tug at our hearts whether thev be sav or sober in theme.
This compulsion of Rockwell's to tell his own stories in his own way
has given us some of his most significant work, such as the Four Free-
doms—perhaps
his
greatest—and
that
continuing
series
of
graphic
Americana which
includes
his
portrayals
of
the
Ration
Board,
the
Country Editor, A Night on
a Troop Train and So You Want to See
the
President!
These
are
all
historically important documents
and.
however they will be regarded by posterity as works of art. there
is little
doubt
that
they
will become
a permanent and valued record
of the
pageant of present-day America.
This, rather than the belief that he
is a great
painter,
is the
basis of Rockwell's confidence
in the worth-
w hileness of his work.
The
artist's encounters with
all
kinds
of people
have
netted him
many amusing
stories.
One. with which we must
close
this chapter,
came out of his brush with his Vermont ration board, in preparing for
one of the pictures just mentioned.
"What I would like," he explained
to them, "is the privilege of painting pictures of all you board members
in session."
The initial reaction, as expressed in their faces, must have
been pretty much like that seen in the picture he finally produced.
But
the
first moments
of surprise and perhaps mistrust soon gave way
to
genial
acceptance
of the
proposal
but with
the
reservation
from
the
chairman. "Make
us
look good now."
Rockwell's
response was
in-
stantaneous.
"If
I
do." he bargained,
"will you
give me
a B card.'"
Back came the rejoinder. "No, but
if you don't, we'll take away your
A card."

These two pages of drawings ran as a feature in the Post for January 2j. 1945.
They were in pen-and-ink on scratchboard, a unique material much favored by
artists drawing for reproduction. As
it is coated with a chalky substance, white
lines can easily be scratched on any blackened area.
I gained the effect of rain

TOM SAWYER— FULL-SIZE DETAIL OF AN
OIL STUDY
Every
illustrator appreciates the opportunity afforded by a
fine book
written
by a great author. A poorly written book
is difficult to illustrate.
The reason
is
obvious.
The good author has thought
on
his
subject
exhaustively, and
knows
it so thoroughly that his book teems with picture possibilities. A poorly
written story will always bring in elements which,
if illustrated,
will just ruin
the
pictorial
quality.
In "Tom Sawyer" and ''Huckleberry Finn"
there
is a
picture
on
aery
single
page—there
is
nothing
that Mark
Twain
has
his
characters do
that
isn't
just
perfect.
1
therefore
greatly
enjoyed
illustrating
these books for the Heritage Pn
rx.
N. R.

V:
Illustrating
the Book
Rockwell's
reputation
as
a book
illustrator has been earned more
by the quality than by the quantity of his product; he has illustrated
relatively
few
books.
These
few,
however,
have
proved
immensely
popular, so much so that publishers are constantly using every type of
persuasion—including amazing chunks of monetary bait—to tempt him
to do more.
But Norman has become casehardened to all such approaches.
His
work for the Post, interrupted nowadays only by his occasional excur-
sions
into
the
calendar
field,
occupies
every moment.
Not
that
he
would mind doing more books
if time permitted.
"It's fun
to do a
really good book," he says, "but only the best
titles give me any satis-
faction.
Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn are of the
type
I
enjoy.
These had long intrigued me,
so when George Macy
of the Heritage Press invited me several years ago to illustrate them,
I was able to throw myself into the task with real enthusiasm."
Having undertaken
this
commission, Norman,
with
his customary
thoroughness, did what no illustrator of these books had ever done be-
fore: he journeyed to Hannibal, Missouri, in order to see with his own
eyes
the
scenes
of Mark Twain's boyhood.
For
days he wandered
about,
absorbing the
feeling
of the
place.
He talked
to inhabitants
young and old, questioning, listening, thinking.
Notebook and sketch-
book in hand, he jotted down hundreds of impressions.
One night Norman visited the cave where Tom and Becky got
lost.

ILLUSTRATING THE BOOK
IO3
It seems that a couple of murders had just been committed in St. Louis,
and the murderers had been known to come toward Hannibal.
One
of Norman's newly acquired friends had volunteered to act that night
as guide to the cave, but at the last minute his wife decided that with
murderers approaching she was afraid to be left alone.
Therefore Nor-
man was led to the cave as agreed, but his guide immediately returned
home.
Norman entered the spooky place alone and had scarcely started
to
explore
it when
his
acetylene
light
flickered
out,
leaving him
in
Stygian darkness.
Only then did he begin to worry about those two mur-
derers.
Had they come to Hannibal?
Were they by any chance in the
cave?
What would they do
if they found him?
And so he sat there
in the dark still as a mouse, apprehensive, startled by every slight sound.
One hour passed, two, two and a half.
Suddenly a wavering light ap-
peared in the distance, then drew nearer,
eerily illuminating the gro-
tesque
forms
of
that
strange
interior.
Could
it
be
the
murderers
approaching? His
heart quickened.
But
his
fears soon proved to be
unfounded— it was only
his guide come
to conduct him back
to the
village.
After some days, his study material assembled, Norman left Hannibal
for home where he took keen enjoyment in completing his task.
For
each
of
the
books, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, he made
a
chapter heading,
eight paintings
in
full color and a drawing for the
binding.
Here we reproduce a number of these paintings, along with a
pair of
his preliminary
studies.
The
latter are particularly revealing
to those who like to know how
it's
all done.
The
first of these
(page
100)
is a
full-size detail, in color, portraying the pipe-smoking episode
from Tom Sawyer.
The other, of the switching scene from Huckleberry
Finn, appears on page
104, opposite the final painting.
These studies,
by the way, were executed on sheets of illustration board which had
previously been coated with
shellac.
Not
all of the surface was cov-
ered with paint
; the brushwork is free and sketchy.
One of Rockwell's regular models, Fred Hildebrandt, posed for the
schoolmaster.
And what
a
difficult
pose!
It was due
to the
artist's
trouble in finding models capable of holding such action poses that he

first looked with favor on the camera as a possible aid.
It
is interesting
to compare the pose of this switching episode with the somewhat similar
one—though the latter pictures a rear view—used for the Interwoven
Socks advertisement on page 128.
Back
in Norman's New Rochelle days, before he used photographs
at
all, he
relied
largely on
less than a dozen models.
One
of these,
old Dave Campion, posed
for many of his pictures.
In a certain in-
stance he was supposed
to be
fishing.
"Just imagine. Dave,
that you
really
are
sitting
there
on
the bank
fishing,"
Rockwell
said.
Ten
minutes
passed; Norman
lost
himself
in
his work.
Suddenly Dave
jumped up, jerking his arms violently, his face grim.
Norman, startled,
calmed him down and asked
for an explanation.
"Didn't you see?"
Campion
replied.
"I hooked
a big one and almost landed him—but
he got away."
James K. Van
Brunt, an
elderly man
well marked
by
time, was
another
favorite model.
Norman
selected him
to
pose
for
the
Post
cover depicting a Colonial sign painter
(reproduced
in color on page
164), telling him a couple of weeks ahead all about the coming assign-
ment.
Van
Brunt,
standing
in
front
of
a
mirror
in
his own
room,
figured
out
poses which
he thought
suitable.
When
it came
to
the
actual painting,
it proved almost impossible to persuade him to relin-
quish these.
Van Brunt was a great character.
He had fought the Indians, and
was a veteran of the Civil and Spanish-American Wars.
And mighty
proud
of
it.
He wore
spats,
a
frock
coat,
a
fawn-colored
waistcoat,
and sometimes
affected
a high
silk
hat.
But
his piece
dc
resistance
was
his remarkable
eight-inch
mustache, which Norman
painted
so
many times that editors
finally threw up their hands
in
protest.
Vail
Brunt was a small man—he weighed but ninety-eight pounds;
his wife
weighed over two hundred.
She threatened to put him in a little bottle!
He was
also a
short man—of the exact
height of Napoleon-—but
ex-
tremely vigorous
for
his eights -odd
years.

While
at Hannibal, preparing to

Finn."
I talked with several people who were boys when Clemens was a boy.
It seems he uas not a rough-and-tumble kid at all. An old judge whom
I met
had known him well; he told me that Sam Clemens was really a sickly, sensi-
tive boy. so what he put into
his stories were the things that he would have
done had he been stronger—things that he no doubt dreamed of doing.
If
he had actually done these things, possibly he would have been such an extro-
vert that he could not have written about them
.
.
.
I have a feeling also that
;t Mark Twain had not been brought up in Hannibal, these stories could not
have happened: the place has everything!
It's on the Mississippi:
it's got the
cave,
the
bluffs,
the
island,
just as they
were described
in the book:
it pos-
sesses all the romance of an old-time river town. And you can get in a dugout
or on a raft and go down the Mississippi as Huck did

still be seen
!
Norman's boy models were many and
varied.
Eddie Carson and
Billy Paine were long on his preferred
list.
He also used the Bartnett
boys, Tom, Dick and Harry.
All of these appeared in dozens of paint-
ings.
Paine was a
lively youngster, much given to joking.
One day
while posing he amazed Rockwell by suddenly screaming, "Help
! help
!"
at the top of his lungs.
As
if by magic a policeman flung open the
door.
Billy had seen him passing and decided to stir things up.
These are but a few of dozens of models who have sat for Rockwell
whose
faces have become
familiar
to us through the pages of books
and magazines.
Rockwell says, "It would be a great party if my models
past and present could be brought together in costume under one roof.
There would be little devils from baseball lots and swimming holes, and
they would bring along their funny pups.
There would be young folks
and old folks, thin folks and fat folks, city folks and country folks. The
company
would
include
nosey
constables,
tired
druggists,
pompous
judges, the overworked postman, the friendly corner cop. What a mixed
group
it would be
! But I think we would all understand each other and
have a good time."
Rounding up the costumes for these Mark Twain books was part of the fun of
this assignment.
At that time
I lived in New Rochelle where people don't
wear
old
clothes,
so
in Hannibal
I bought my needed
costumes
right
off
people's backs.
I would lay in wait on Main Street; if a fellow came along in
old pants that had character,
I would accost him and ask if he wanted to sell
them.
"I'll give you
five dollars for those old pants,"
I would
say.
"They
ain't worth five dollars," he would reply.
I would convince him that I wanted
to buy them, and then we'd go over to the
car, pull down the curtains, and
he'd take them
off. The same with hats, shirts, and so forth.
In the meantime,
I'd have to go into a shop and buy new things to take their places.
Gradually
by purchase and
barter
I gathered the
toil-worn costumes
I needed.

JVlurals, Portraits and Such
Norman rockwell has devoted little time to mural and portrait paint-
ing, yet he has produced enough work to make us want
to see more.
As to murals, he has executed but one, the Yankee Doodle picture on
pages
1 14 and
1 15, now over the bar in The Yankee Doodle Tap Room
of The Nassau Tavern
at Princeton, New Jersey.
Some of his other
paintings,
not
originally
designed
as
murals,
have been
successfully
adapted for that purpose.
The making of an acceptable mural
is an achievement for an illus-
trator, as
it is not easy for one accustomed to working at relatively small
size,
for reproduction on
the
printed page,
to
adjust
himself
to the
problem of
filling large wall spaces with decorations which will take
their places as integral parts of the walls which bear them, and which
will at the same time possess qualities worthy of permanent display.
In short, the printed page and the interior walls of buildings call for
entirely
different
approaches.
Highly
dramatic
effects
are
entirely
suitable
for
the former—are
quite
essential,
indeed,
as
eye-catching
devices in the highly competitive
field of periodical publishing.
Such
dramatic productions,
if magnified
to a thousand times
their area
to
fill large
spaces, would
fairly jump
off the walls and overwhelm the
spectator.
Wall paintings must
therefore be handled with
restraint.
Violent
action,
strong contrasts of tone or
color, obtrusive forms and
acute perspective are, as a rule, avoided by the muralist.
Rockwell, in painting Yankee Doodle, dodged most of these pitfalls,

HERE IN BLACK AND WHITE IS THE OVER-BAR PAINTING OPPOSITE
though
his
result
is deliberately
illustrative
in the same
sort of story-
telling manner
in which he has always
liked
to
paint.
However,
in
telling his story he has displayed rather more of action than most mural-
ists would attempt.
He certainly was courageous in parading the pony-
riding Yankee Doodle, with
his accompanying
boys, dogs and
goose,
directly across the foreground of the canvas,
for,
as we have
just im-
plied,
it is almost a first principle of mural design not to set up strenuous
motion
of
this
sort.
But the
artist
skillfully counteracted
this strong
right-to-left movement.
First, he reduced
its speed by
a number of
expedients:
by cutting the hitching post and decorative ribbon across
the feet and legs of boy. dog and goose; by almost obscuring the legs
of the cantering pony; by "braking"' the pony by means of the barefoot
boy
in
a braced
position, holding
its
tail; by turning one dog's head
back, and by facing a figure or two toward the right.
Then he envel-
oped the lower half of the painting in a mist of shadowy tones that tend
to force the spectator's eye
to the more
distinct and significant areas
above.
By such means,
as well
as through
his distribution of human
interest among the various groups of figures—not to mention a scattered

spotting of color and tone—the artist has created an allover decoration
which satisfactorily weds liveliness and restraint.
He has nicely related this painting to the wall which supports
it. by
means
of several compositional
practices.
Foremost among
these, he
portrayed the painting's background of tavern wall, with
its doors and
windows, in straight front view; this gives us harmonizing verticals and
horizontals.
All the action takes place at or near this wall, so that we
face
it directly.
We have already mentioned the horizontal ribbon at
the bottom; this is another stabilizing influence, tying the whole together
and giving it a firm base.
We have
so
far
said nothing about
the
fine character
delineation
which the
artist has here achieved—we somehow expect this in
all his
work.
Every face and figure will stand critical analysis.
Dover Coach, which we have
also chosen to designate
as a mural,
is, from a compositional standpoint, somewhat similar to Yankee Doodle,
though there are two main differences.
First,
all the action in Dover
Coach takes place within the confines of the single vehicle—the figures
are moving as a
unit.
Second, the warm hues of Dover Coach, sur-
rounded by the cooler tones of the sky and background, create a domi-
nant central mass of color interest, wholly unlike the pattern of scattered
hues in Yankee Doodle.
While never intended as a mural, Rockwell's Sign Painter has been
included because
it
is
quite
suitable
for wall
use.
For
this purpose,
some of the stronger value contrasts could perhaps be suppressed ad-
vantageously, though
obviously much would depend on
the
picture's
setting.
Viewed purely as an historic painting—its true purpose—these
contrasts are highly effective.
The concentration of interest on the sign
painter, as he goes about his task,
is a dominant feature of this example.
Different from all of the above, both in subject matter and composi-
tion,
is Rockwell's Land of Enchantment.
Here the decorative frame
and foreground
figures stand in bold
silhouette against the dreamlike
"land" beyond.
The restraint of tone and color in this detached back-
drop
is notable— it
holds together very
nicely,
yet
the
spectator can
search
out without
trouble each
of
the famous characters
of
fiction.

The Ichabod Crane subject is still another which, though not planned
as a mural, might be so utilized.
It
is interesting to observe that here,
as in the Sign Painter, Dover Coach, and Yankee Doodle, parallel per-
spective,
rather than angular, has been chosen.
In fact
this
is quite
characteristic of this
artist, who
is inclined to avoid sharp perspective
unless he is stressing action or emotional intensity, as in the piano playing
subject, page 70, and the hospital waiting room, page 84.
Although the heading to our chapter makes reference to portraiture,
Rockwell has done very few formal portraits;
this of Colonel Avers
is
one of his occasional exceptions.
But
it might well be maintained that
he has painted portraits all his life, particularly during the years he has
devoted to subject pictures,
for these certainly are portraits in a sense
not characteristic of run-of-the-mill illustrations.
Printmaking
is
another
art
which
Rockwell seldom
practices,
al-
though he has always hoped to find more time for
it.
On one of his
trips abroad he bought an etching press in London, and at considerable
expense shipped
it home.
It is really a beauty, but
it stands in the back
room of his
studio, accusingly
idle.
"I am forever saying that
I am
going
to drypoint,'' Norman
states, "but because
I am always behind
in my schedule
I never seem to get to
it.
Just the same, one of these
days
I am going to do some drypoint—it
is a wonderful medium of ex-
pression.
The fact that you can pull so many prints makes copper plate
an excellent medium when duplicates are desired."
His drypoint on
page 126 indicates what he might do in this field, given the time.
There
is a type of work by Rockwell which should be gathered and
reproduced some day—his many unpublished sketches, often of a hu-
Opposite:

Fairfax Ayers was

The colonel
is a neighbor and a very good friend of mine.
He comes from a long line of
American fighting men.
He is a West Pointer, and teas a Colonel of Artillery

Like his forebears, he has won many medals and decorations.

morous nature, made purely for the fun of the thing, or as gifts to his
friends.
The four post cards which we include are representative. These
were done
in Europe during a pleasure
trip.
They were printed on
colored cardboard and touched up with opaque watercolor.
One might think that this artist would be intrigued by his picturesque
Arlington surroundings to paint landscapes.
But
this hasn't been the
case
to date.
Other
artists who
visit him get out
their brushes and
portray the covered bridge, the Kill, or some of the mountain scenery.
All this leaves Norman cold.
His interest, as we have repeatedly seen,
lies primarily in people.
And we wouldn't want it any other way.
When travelling,
it is always fun to send mail back home.
I drew these cards in
ink and had them printed; then I touched them up with opaque paint.

KL OIL PAINTING MADE FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES

VII:
Advertising Art
It
is common knowledge that there
is more money to be made in
advertising drawing than in any other type of illustration.
A generous
share of the huge sums big business spends for promotion finds its way
into
the
pockets
of
top-flight
illustrators.
Industry
does
not haggle
over a few thousand dollars when bidding for these artists' work. Rock-
well's own practice has been to charge twice as much for an advertising
picture as for a magazine cover or illustration. For even the most power-
ful of publications cannot compete with giant industry.
Consequently
many artists do more commercial work than editorial assignments, even
though, for creative satisfaction, they may prefer the latter.
Rockwell's work
is seldom seen today on advertising pages.
His in-
come from publication art
is sufficient to make him indifferent to the
lure
of more money from
advertisers.
Occasionally he succumbs
to
entreaties and
accepts an
advertising commission,
but
only
if given
free rein.
Opposite:
When people ask why
I sometimes
resort
to photographs,
I
tell
them what a job
it is to get models to take and hold poses such as were used
for
this Interwoven
Socks advertisement.
Any time you wish
to become a
model,
try either of these poses for a few minutes
.
.
. I have never learned to
letter well, for lettering is an art in itself, so whenever I have needed letter
as in this case.
I have called on an expert to draw
it.
Then I have painted
believing that
I could thus get character of my own into
it.

NORMAN ROCKWELL. ILLUSTRATOR
Most
advertising ideas originate in the
client's brain or in the ad-
vertising agency.
They are usually hatched in conferences which may-
or may not include the
artist.
This
is not to say that illustrators have
no creative
part
in
the
project;
their own dramatization of the idea
enhances
its power, and sometimes, of course, they themselves suggest
better ideas than the one originally proposed.
But, by and large, an
artist's genius has to compromise with the client's money.
In view
of Rockwell's consuming
interest
in people, particularly of
the homespun
variety, and
his eagerness to paint storytelling pictures
of those aspects of American life that are so close to his heart, it is easy to
understand how rarely an advertising idea, perhaps with a competing
message of its own, appeals to him.
Now and then something may be
right up
his
alley.
We
recall
a
painting he did for Capitol Boilers years ago.
A nearly destitute young
musician sits in his cold attic room, hands outstretched before the meager
heat
of a small
stove.
His
violin
rests upon
his knees waiting
until
numbed
fingers can be thawed
out and
the
interrupted
practice
re-
sumed.
The display line reads, "The melody stilled by cold."
Here the
artist could be himself; the story he wished to tell would perfectly sen e
the needs of the advertiser.
This was also the case with the two series
for Interwoven Socks and Fisk Tires.
The Bernadette poster is likew ise
a good Rockwellian theme.
Opposite:
This Fisk
Tire advertisement dates back more than
t waits
years.
The
painting
is
typical of the work
I was doing
at
that time.
One thing
1
liked about this series WOS the freedom to originate
ffl) own ideas: that's half
the
fun
of
painting.
I
always
enjoyed doing
these tramp
pictures.

HOY SCOUT CALENDAR PAINTING,
1946

JULY-1IS47
"la"
VIII:
CNow
It's Calendar Jime
"Twenty-two years ago," boasts America's biggest calendar publish-
ing
outfit, "Brown & Bigelow scooped the advertising world with the
creation of the Boy Scout Calendar, authorized by national headquarters
of that organization
!
Sparked by the genius of Norman Rockwell, this
unique idea
is now regarded as the most powerful feature in Remem-
brance Advertising and
is the envy of the advertising profession every-
where."
The Brown & Bigelow people go on to say that, throughout
the years, Norman Rockwell calendars have—to use their trade jargon
—"led the calendar parade."
Rockwell
got
himself
into
this Boy
Scout Calendar
business from
purely altruistic motives
; he painted the first few of the series as a labor
of love.
He recognized the significance of the Scouts' character build-
ing program,
believing
that
helpfulness and consideration
for
others
are things the world can use a
lot
of.
Later, realizing that he was on
the producing end
of what was getting to be—for the publishers—
a
pretty
lucrative
enterprise,
he
arrived
at
a
conclusion,
reasonably
enough, that there would be nothing unethical in accepting money for
creating the product.
Eventually his price per picture exceeded—as
Rufus Jarman put
it in a New Yorker article—"forty-five times what
/ truly enjoy doing this type of picture;
I bate now painted over twenty.
In
this particular one. my son Tommy posed as a Cub Scout, and his good friend
and neighbor, young Jim Edgerton. posed as the Boy Scout.

SOLDIER
IN THE PHILIPPINES
MRS. O'LEARY AND HER COW
They tell me that for many
years the Boy Scout Calendar has been the largest
selling calendar in America. At least this was true until the Dioune quintuplets
came along; then my friend, Andy Loomis, used them as a calendar subject, and
for
several
years they were
in
the lead.
But gradually the Boy
Scouts have
forged into first place again
.

—the two above, for example.

Rembrandt got
for Bathsheba After the Bath."
It even exceeds Rock-
well's own handsome per cover take from the Post
.
That the price is not excessive is evidenced by the continuing demands
of the St. Paul publishers, and other firms which would gladly pay even
more
for an occasional Rockwell
picture.
But one or two calendars
per annum are usually enough for Rockwell, who for the past few years
has bound himself to the Post in an agreement to paint only for their
magazine, and to do a limited number of calendar paintings, including
his annual "good deed" for the Boy Scouts.
Lauding one of his calendar pictures, Brown & Bigelow
tell us that,
"As usual Rockwell has done a remarkable job in perfection of detail,
color and
storytelling."
We
italicize
"perfection
of
detail,"
because
stark realism—that means photo-finish—is the sine qua non of all cal-
endar art.
And in the Scout calendars, storytelling
is a first considera-
tion.
Of
course
perfection
of
detail
characterizes
all
of
Rockwell's
paintings for publication, but what the Scout organization demands in
this respect—every calendar picture has to bear
its stamp of approval
—might
be termed
"super-perfection";
all
incidents
of Scout
ritual,
practice, accoutrement and insignia must be meticulously and authori-
tatively portrayed.
The Scout's uniform must always be immaculate,
regardless of the blood, sweat and tears that may have accompanied the
performance of his good deed.
The Scouts themselves have to be care-
fully typed.
They must be sturdy lads;
freshly complexioned, whole-
some and well-scrubbed—the pride and joy of every mother.
All
this
of course does violence
to reality and leads to an
artificial
result that Rockwell puts up with because he continues to believe that
the salutary effect of his yearly sermon in paint justifies a compromise
with esthetics. There is little doubt that his calendar pictures do "appeal
to every boy, every dad and mother, and to Scout leaders everywhere,"
the rank and
file of whom prefer them to anything that might be pro-
duced by a modern Rembrandt.
Picture ideas—as we have found
in our discussion of Post covers
sometimes come easy, sometimes hard.
Ideas for Boy Scout calendars
are no exception.
Frequently a chance incident, wholly unrelated to

I38
NORMAN ROCKWELL, ILLUSTRATOR
the particular problem, translates
itself in Rockwell's perceptive mind
into a good picture story.
For example, a panting, thirsty dog seen in a
baggage car suggested a very good deed for a calendar Boy Scout.
It
hasn't been too easy, though, to think of a new Scout cover idea every
year for over twenty years.
As Rockwell said, in the New Yorker article
just mentioned, "The Boy Scouts are simply going
to have
to devise
some new good deeds or Brown & Bigelow will be in a stew."
Yet
if anyone can think
of calendar
ideas, Rockwell can.
Just as
four-leaf
clovers seem
naturally
to jump
out
at some
people
from
millions
of the ordinary
variety, picture ideas leap from the mass of
everyday incident to Norman's mind.
For he has conditioned himself
throughout the years to discover his graphic themes in casual happen-
ings that pass unnoticed by others.
It is these undramatic things, after
all, that
fill most of our lives.
The awareness of what, in the kaleido-
scope of life's confusion, holds magic that will warm the hearts of mil-
lions
is,
without
doubt,
one
of
the
secrets
of Norman
Rockwell's
reputation as America's best-known and best-loved artist.
Rockwell's calendars
are
not
all on
the Boy
Scout
theme,
as
the
accompanying illustrations demonstrate.
Attention
is particularly called
to his lively drawings for the Four Seasons calendar.
Opposite:
These jour drawings, done in Wolf] crayon, are from a 194J cal-
endar which
is something of an innovation in that each of them
will be sur-
rounded by an ornamental border.
For example, "Winter" will ban a a\
of snowflakes around
it.
This treatment should creati an esthetic completeness
which many calendars lack.

PUBLISHER'S NOTE
It
is said that no other paintings in the world have ever been repro-
duced and distributed in such numbers as these four which follow, cre-
ated by Norman Rockwell in
1943. When he
first undertook them he
thought he could finish them in two months; actually it took seven. "The
job was too big for me," he relates.
"It should have been tackled by
Michelangelo."
But Michelangelo wasn't on hand and Rockwell was,
with his finger on the pulse of America's need.
When these paintings
first appeared in the Post their reception was
little short of miraculous; requests came for millions of reprints.
Then
the Government joined
in, and additional millions were distributed in
connection with the Treasury Department's War Bond Drives.
Some
were in the form of large posters. The originals were sent
all over the
nation to be exhibited during Four Freedoms War Bond Shows in which
numerous public officials, celebrities and entertainers took part.
Eventu-
ally the O.W.I, circulated floods of Four Freedoms posters abroad and
to the
nation's post
offices,
schools,
clubs, railroad
stations, and other
public
or
semi-public
buildings.
And everywhere
they were warm!)
acclaimed.
Many consider these paintings Rockwell's masterpieces; certainh the)
represent a tremendous contribution to the winning of the war.

Thirty Drears Of Post Covers
"Artists may come and artists may go. but Norman Rockwell goes on
forever !"
So paraphrased one of Norman's admirers at the close of the
recent
( 1946) exhibition of the Society of Illustrators, held at the Rocke-
feller Center galleries. New York.
And the remark was both pat and timely, for announcement had just
been made that the painting before which his friend was standing—that
of the red-headed marine displaying a captured Jap flag (see page 192)
—had been chosen by public vote
as the best
in the show.
Quite an
honor, for over twelve hundred persons had attended, drawn by the dis-
play of the finest illustration of the previous two years, as selected by an
eminent jury.
And. as
if this highest honor weren't enough, Rockwell's
painting of a home-coming soldier
(see page 188), was voted third best.
So Rockwell's thirty years of outstanding accomplishment as a painter
of Post
covers—of which
the
following pages
serve
as a reminder
haven't
left him weak and gasping for breath. On the contrary, they
have proved
to be merely a warming-up period
for more and better
things both now and in the future.
As Rockwell himself so amusingly
suggests in
his cradle-to-grave continuity on the preceding pages, he's
been doing covers ever since he was a youngster, and he'll continue to do
them as long as he can hold a brush.
Thus he
is creating a significant
and unbroken record of many years of typical life in the good old U. S. A.
during this amazing age of split atoms and such.

SELF-PORTRAIT:
THE ARTIST WAS FACED WITH A DILEMMA
In agony of soul this cover was done, because the most terrible thing an illus-
trator has to face is a deadline.
Often it is a case of either getting a picture in
on time—not done as well as you like—or of doing
it well and being too late
to have it published.
This portrait is reasonably accurate.

CAN YOU FIND FORTY-FIVE ERRORS
IN THIS APRIL FOOL COVER?
/ have never done a cover yet but that someone has found things wrong with
it.
I finally decided to do one cover plumb full of mistakes.
I believe there
were forty-five in
this, but I had a letter from South America listing one hun-
dred
eighty-four!
The
Post
was flooded
with
mail, and
so was
I.
Even

7ht Willie Qillis Series
This series grew out of my pondering the plight of an inoffensive, ordi-
nary little guy thrown into the chaos of war. He was not to be an avid,
brave, blood-and-guts soldier, though a perfectly willing—if somewhat
ineffective—one. My wife hit on the name "Wee Willie Gillis" :
it was
based on a child's book. So that was what I christened him, not realizing
that there were thousands of Gillises, some of them Willies.
There even
turned out to be a colonel—later promoted to brigadier general—named
Willie Gillis.
N(
\t
thing was
to
find a model.
One night
at a square dance
in
Arlington, Robert Buck came from over the mountain.
I kept moving
around him, studying him from different angles, until I decided he would
do. He told me afterwards that
if I had stared at him just once more
he would have knocked me flat.
The scries started on the Post of October 4, 1941.
After that, Willie
Gillis covers appeared with considerable regularity; there were eight or
ten
in
all.
Bob was supposedly
unfit for military service, which suited
me
fine; but suddenly he patriotically enlisted as a Navy aviator and
dashed
off to the South Seas.
So, when the Post wanted me to do an-
other Willie Gillis picture, I was in somewhat of a dilemma—all that I
had was a group of photographs of Buck.
But I finally worked up the
idea
of showing
Willie through
six generations.
The cover stirred up
unusual interest.
Hundreds of letters poured in from Gillises and others
all over the country.
I
still hear from people who want to learn what
has happened to Willie.
I really don't know; I haven't heard from him,
though
I've been
told
he's safe and sound. I'm afraid by the time he
gets bat
/.. he will be completely forgotten.

This Tattoo Artist cover was
very
well received, as were most of those which
1 did bearing on the war.
The model was my good friend and fellow

Schaeffer.

Portrait oj a Railway Station
It
hasn't been easy
to think
of good ideas for
thirty
or so Christmas
covers.
I always try to
hit on some new angle when I can.
In ig44
I
got the notion that I would like to do a railroad station interior during a
wartime Christmas season—the pathos and humor: the mother meeting
the son; the wife meeting her husband; one lover meeting another. The
Post liked the idea, and inasmuch as I was going to California, I stopped
off
at Chicago and
taxied around
to compare
the
different
stations,
finally deciding on the North Western Railroad Station.
The Station
Master and the Advertising Manager made it wonderful for me. A huge
ladder was brought out— the one used to wash the glass ceiling.
It had
a platform on
it.
They gave me four men
to guard
it at the bottom.
Tlun the photographer and I mounted the ladder to get the perspective
from every angle.
There were many astonished travelers that day, be-
ta use everyone that came in was made to go through a single gateway
so we could take pictures. We photographed over a hundred soldiers,
sailors and marines meeting their families and friends. We even stagi d
a few
meetings.
There was one man—/ don't
recall
his name—who
offered to help me, and he and I went out in the crowd and picked the
people we liked and induced them to pose.
In some cases we had to ask
l>< dutiful
;^irls to
kiss utter strangers, but they
all seemed happy about
the whole thing.
I arranged for one red-head to kiss a Navy Lieutenant
—she said
it was too bad I wasn't taking time exposures.
(They proud
to be a married couple!)
Only one person didn't want to pose— a
little
man
in white who was pushing a broom around. He not only refused;
he got
quite mad about
it.
Later a number of people wrote that they
)<
< ognizi
<l th, mst Ivt
\ in
tht
picture.
I took the photographs in June, and the painting based on them came
out
at Christmas.
I therefore had to change light summer clothing
to
heavy fu>\. overcoats, etc.
I left some of the uniforms light, my alibi be-
ing that these peopU wen coming in from the Southwt
rt.

IX: Rockwell's Creative and Technical Procedure
WE opened Chapter II with the question, "Tell me,
Mr. Rockwell, how do you paint a Post cover?"
In
answering that question
in Chapters II and
III, we
purposely avoided a detailed discussion of the
artist's
creative and
technical
processes,
realizing
that such
a discussion would seem tedious
to some of our gen-
eral
readers.
Yet
there
are many
others—laymen,
artists,
teachers and
students
alike—who
desire
to
know, down
to the last move, how Norman proceeds
with his work.
Hence
this final chapter, in which, after a consid-
eration
of some
of the cover designer's special prob-
lems, Rockwell's methods
of study and painting are
described in a sequence of fifteen steps which consti-
tute a complete record of his procedure in producing
a Post cover from
the conception
of the idea
to the
delivery of the finished picture.
Rockwell doesn't confine these methods to the paint-
ing
of
Post
covers, however.
Whatever
his work—
illustrations, advertisements, calendars, portraits, mu-
rals—he seldom wanders far from
these fifteen steps.
*
*
*
Before
turning
to cover
painting,
the
artist must
have learned how
to paint.
If that pronouncement
seems a bit too obvious, remember what happened to
an
illustration
student who
disappeared
from
art
school
after
only
a few
months'
instruction
in
the
fundamentals
of
drawing.
The
instructor,
asking
what had become of the missing one, was told by a
fellow student:
"Oh, he has bought a camera!"
VtAMM
More about photography
later; but any
artist will
agree
that, camera or no camera, the traditional art
school training
is recommended; an illustrator
is
first
of
all an
artist.
Granted
the
best
of
art
training, and
skill
as
a
painter,
the beginner must
also have
secured some
sort
of background
in connection with
the
require-
ments
peculiar
to cover
art.
This
he can
gain by
examining critically many a cover; by doing a great
deal of
leisurely thinking about covers; by endeavor-
ing
to
discover why one magazine
selects
a
certain
type, and another magazine a wholly contrary type.
Through
such
analysis, he
will
soon come
to
see
that
different
magazines
have
very
different
basic
editorial
plans
and,
as
cover
policies
are
naturally
linked
closely
to
these
basic
plans—are
actually
a
r^
part of them—it follows that these cover policies are
also widely divergent.
Some magazines closely relate
their cover material,
as
to general
type,
at
least,
to
their
between-cover
content;
others do
not.
Some
favor pretty girl covers; others never use them.
Some
employ
striking
subjects,
bright
colors
and
strong
contrasts, on
the
theory
that
they
will
thus
gain
a
maximum
of
newsstand
circulation;
others
largely
disregard
all this, apparently holding the premise that
lasting favor
(which,
after
all,
is what counts)
can
be won only by superior content on the pages within.
Such cover design policies are by no means fixed
;
they
are
subject
to constant
revision.
Some
of the
changes are marked, others so subtle or gradual that
we may
scarcely
realize they are taking place.
But
change
there
is.
In
fact,
the past has seen
definite
vogues
in cover design just

tume design.
The tendency toward experimentation
and innovation
is especially strong today as these are
fast-moving times.
While there are many reasons for such fluctuations
in
both
policies
and
practices,
in
the
last
analysis
these
changes
are
but
the
natural
reflection
of
the
rapidly altering pattern of our American way of
life.
Yet
there are
definite influences
at work from time
to time.
For example,
art editors and
artists play a
leading part in the genesis of each new trend.
Both
feel
that something new
is expected
of them
every
so often
; both get
tired of doing the same old thing
in the same old way.
So they deliberately alter their
course.
And younger
artists,
as they enter the
field,
know
that
it's good
business
to show
that they can
create something fresh and exciting, either in subject
matter
or
handling;
so
they
try
all
sorts
of
stunts,
some
of which prove extremely
effective.
If art
di-
rc( tors favor one of these stunts and use
it, and the
public accepts
it, a trend may be under way.
We needn't dwell further on such matters as trends
and
general
editorial
policies; our main purpose has
been
to
stress
the
rather obvious
fact,
already
indi-
cated,
that
before
the young or inexperienced
artist
tries
to paint covers he should be able
to approach
art
editors with an awareness not onlv of the trends
o!
the day.
but
of
their magazine
policies.
His

way
ol
judging what
policy a periodical
favors

is to study the covers
it

stimulating
in appearance, and
to
\
give each issue an individuality which
identifies
it as

the moment

stands.
Since a
main part of the Post's editorial plan
is to reflect and
interpret
current
life—though
it
is
by no means a
news magazine-—its covers are likely to have a repor-
torial
quality.
Yet Post covers are by no means
all
reportorial; a good gag
is occasionally acceptable, or
a cover by an outstanding "fine"
artist, or some other
break from the general
routine.
There
is seldom
if
ever any attempt
to relate the picture on a cover di-
rectly to any one feature inside.
The Post has been one of the leaders
in the recent
trend
towards
covers
that
depict an
entire
scene
the American scene—rather than an
incident.
This
is
exemplified
by
the

page
187. and
the home-coming soldier, page
188.

Might

Does

If the answer
is yes, the idea must be discarded.
Pages might profitably be
filled with discussions of
these and other conditions that give direction
to the
would-be cover designer, but
let us get on to our ac-
count of Norman Rockwell's handling of specific prob-
lems and
his
technical
procedures
in
executing
his
paintings.
Step
i:
Getting the Idea.
The
first consideration
in doing a cover
is, of course,
to find an acceptable
idea or motif.
Since a cover can be no better than
the idea behind
it,
it
is
essential
to think of a
truly
good idea before a single move
is made on paper or
canvas.
Rockwell's
natural
preference
has
always
been for the human-interest concept.
This
is best, he
believes, when founded on some
deep-seated
senti-
ment or emotion common to mankind.
A
cover,
particularly
if
of the gag
type, may de-
pict a
single, simple incident,
in which case
its mes-
sage
is immediately obvious,
as
it generally involves
but one emotion.
Norman
feels
that
if his painting
chances
to
permit
the
expression
of
two
opposing
emotions simultaneously—perhaps a laugh and a
little
6
*
sob—it
will
usually be
the
better
for
it.
He
points
out that Dickens and Shakespeare utilized much
this
same
principle
by
playing comedy
against
tragedy.
"And," he adds, "they were two pretty good men!"
Carrying this thought further,
it
is his opinion that
one reason why cover
pictures
of young people
arc-
so popular—schoolboys,
let
us say—is that even
if a
boy is doing something that evokes a smile, the reader,
unless
very
youthful,
will
experience some
nostalgic
impression, or sensation of sadness.
In the
past, Rockwell
did numerous covers based
on historic motifs, such as the sign painter, page
164.
Now,
his main
stress
is on today's happenings.
He
feels that contemporary
life
is so exciting that people
would
not
be
interested
in
more
than
occasional
motifs from
the long
ago.
During
the
late
war,
in
particular, life proved so challenging to him that there
just wasn't time
to do half as many paintings
as he
wished.
At
present he
calls
himself
a
reporter
of
current events, an interpreter of human emotions, a
recorder
of
contemporary
America.
Some
day
he
may again change
his approach; he may quite pos-
ibly return
to
the
simple,
rather
static
ideas which
were
in vogue
years back—even
the
historic
motifs
such as those of Colonial days—dusting them off and
putting them to use again.
But
in any
case,
Rockwell
favors
the
storytelling
idea.
He has never had the least interest in painting
covers merely to portray pretty
girls, flowers or land-
scapes.
While he realizes that a pretty face may have
newsstand appeal, he considers such appeal transient
and
shallow—far
less
important
than
the
type
of
reader
interest inherent
in a
storytelling
idea.
But,
to emphasize a point made
earlier, the idea must be
good.
"Without
a
good
idea
right
at
the
start;"
Norman says, "only failure can result.
No one has to
tell
the
artist when
such
an
idea
is
good;
it
just
naturally rings the
bell.
He wants to go ahead and
paint that idea and no other in the world.
He can't
think up any more.
If he has an
idea
that
hasn't
much merit he may sometimes
try
to convince him-
self that
it has, but
if he
persists
in using
it,
in the
end the cover is certain to prove a flop."
One reason why Rockwell
likes Arlington
is
that
here
it's very much easier for him
to generate ideas.
He
is so close to people that he comes to know almost
their every act and emotion.
Under such conditions
cover
ideas
are
not hard
to
find; he
is surrounded
with them.
And he literally thinks in terms of maga-
zine covers.
Inspiration sometimes hits him suddenly
at unexpected times and
places;
it's nothing uncom-
mon for him
to get out of bed in the night to make
a sketch of a thought that has unexpectedly popped.
Others are developed more painfully.
Rockwell states
that
it has never been
his practice to use cover sug-
gestions
created
by
others—not
that
they
aren't
offered by the hundred; almost every mail brings at
least one.
"Thinking up ideas
is part of the fun of
my job," he explains.
"So my advice to the young
artist
is to learn to create his own; he will be happier
and do more significant work."
Norman stresses the fact that the basic concept for
a cover must usually be decided months before the

S CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL PROCEDURE

cover
is
to
appear.
This
is important.
It
is
a
bit
hard for the beginner to realize that cover assignments
are made many months in advance.
And he should
be advised that such
special
issues
as Christmas and
Fourth of July are almost certain to be given to pro-
fessionals rather than the novice.
He had better con-
centrate, at first, upon the in-between issues.
Step 2:
Getting the Idea Okayed. When Norman
has thought of three or four ideas that really appeal
to him, his customary procedure
is to rough them out
very sketchily in pencil, at small scale, and take them
to Kenneth
Stuart,
art
editor
of
the
Post—a
top-
flight
cover
artist
in
his own
right—to
obtain
his
suggestions and an okay.
Once
there, Norman
per-
sonally demonstrates each idea by acting out the part
of
every
character
in
turn.
Having
worked
with
Stuart and previous Post
art
editors
for
so
long, he
knows rather well
in advance what may or may not
be approved.
He calls Stuart "simply wonderful" in
his cooperation.
If he shows him several sketches and
asks, "Which do you want me to do?"
Stuart's cus-
tomary reply
is: "Which do you want to do?" and
if
there
is nothing about any of them which could
legiti-
mately be criticized by the reader, Rockwell
is usually
left free to go ahead with
all.
Asked
if he had always had
this same experience
at the Post, he replied, "Oh my, no!
Not in the old
days.
When George Horace Lorimer was editor—he
was a great editor, a wonderful man—it was my prac-
tice
to
submit
five
sketches
at
a
time
because
it
seemed to be a policy with him never to accept more
than
three out
of
five.
I
generally made up
three
that
I really liked, and put in two fillers."
Occasionally the Post okays an idea which Rockwell
later
has
to abandon.
Even
though
he may have
been most enthusiastic over his original sketch, when
he gets to his studio
it doesn't work out as expected.
He simply can't go on with
it, sometimes to the keen
disappointment of the Post. Then another conference
with Stuart
is indicated.
We
have
already
seen
that
Rockwell's
original
sketches are usually as meager as they are small, giv-
ing
but
the
barest
suggestion
of
the
final
results.
Obviously an editor couldn't be expected to consider
seriously such incomplete sketches
if submitted by a
newcomer; the editor couldn't possibly judge how the
finals might turn
out.
Rockwell's advice
to the be-
ginner,
therefore,
is
to submit
at
least two or three
finished cover paintings, and only very carefully
fin-
ished sketches of any others, done in color, preferably
at actual reproduction size.
Step 3:
Selecting the Models. When the idea has
been accepted by the Post, Norman's next move
is to
hunt up
the
living models
to pose
for
the
different
characters.
This
is a most
critical
task.
Artists
fol-
low
all
sorts
of
procedures
in
connection
with
it.
Some engage professionals from model agencies
; others
rather
casually
choose
almost
any
individuals who
chance
to be
available,
providing they approximate
what
is needed; then, as these
artists paint, they take
many
liberties
as
to form,
expression and
all.
But
not
Rockwell.
He
always
insists upon
exactly
the
type
required, even
though
it may
entail
a
lengthy
search.
Professional models seem
synthetic
to him;
he much
prefers everyday
people.
If,
for
instance,
his
scheme
calls
for
a
housewife,
he
finds
that no
professional can act the part with the
skill and
spirit
of a real housewife.
When,
until
a
few
years
ago,
his
studio was
in
New
Rochelle, N.
Y., a place of some 60,000 popu-
lation, he would sometimes wander along the streets
for
miles
in an
effort
to
find
the
right
type
willing
to
pose.
He would
lurk
in doorways,
dart out from
-
'
alleys,
inveigle
likely prospects away from home and
business.
Though he was unusually successful at this,
it was time-consuming and sometimes nerve-racking,
so more often than not he would
fall back on one of
his regular models, five or six of whom he employed
again and again.
In
Arlington,
though
its
population
numbers
scarcely
1400, he has mentally catalogued practically
every
inhabitant;
usually
he
can
put
his
finger
at
once on
just the person required for any given pur-
pose.
He needs a fat one, a thin one; there they are

right
in town where he can get in touch with them
the moment he wants them.
It's nothing uncommon
for him
to
take
a farmer
right
out
of
the
field,
a
storekeeper away from his counter, or a neighbor off
of
his
porch.
"And."
as he states
it, "they are just
naturally good
actors,
not
at
being somebody
else
they
wouldn't
be
that—but
at
being
themselves.
Nearl) everyone seems to be a perfect model.
These
people have worked hard and their understanding of
the
fundamentals
of
life
is
reflected
in
their
faces.
That
is what
I
like to paint.
The more trouble they
have had, the more
interesting
their
faces.
Even
a
dog which has been kicked around has more character
than
a pampered one."
Realizing
the
desirability
of
(hanging
his
types
now and
then, Norman
keeps on
the
alert
at
local
Grange
meetings, square dances and such gatherings.
He
can't

use

they
look

eagerly
to
seeing
their
faces on the Post.

is whether

to heal
a person
described
as
"a

character." And
yet, paradoxically, when you make
a careful comparison of the dozens of individuals he
has painted and drawn, you wonder how he has been
able
to show
such
great
variety
of
face and
form.
Step 4:
Gathering the Props.
With suitable models
rounded up, Rockwell must hunt for clothes and ac-
cessories
of correct
size and
type.
Some
years ago
when
he
was
doing
Colonial
scenes,
tailors
were
summoned
to
produce
or
alter
the
costumes.
But
newly tailored costumes lack an honest, lived-in look,
so Rockwell gradually
collected used items
of every
kind until, by the time his studio burned in
1943. he
owned
one
of
the
largest and
finest
collections
of
historic costumes outside of museums.
Today, when
he
is
painting
the
contemporary
American
scene,
his
task
is
far more simple;
his main problem
is
to
get
his models
to come
in
the
things
they
regularly
wear.
If
left
to
themselves,
they
are
likely
to don
their
"Sunday-go-to-meeting"
clothes.
He
has
to
insist that they dress "in character." usually
in work
clothes.
"They say
it takes a
lot of loving to make a
home," says Norman.
"Well,
it takes a
lot of sun and
sweat to give clothes character."
\
/
Many and amusing arc hi- experiences in obtaining
these
things.
Once he was able
to buy an old over-
coat which he saw airing on a line only by purchasing
with
it a bag of rags and a couple of hundred pounds
of old iron.
The owner sized him up as a junkman.

in
the
final
painting.
First, he
explains
to
his models
the purpose
of
the
cover—its
idea and how he
is
trying
to
express
it.
Then
each
is
coached
in
the
part
he
is
to
play,
Norman often enacting
it himself by way of demon-
stration.
He
gives no
arbitrary commands
to em-
barass
his models; instead he has the
faculty
of
in-
spiring each to assume naturally the pose and expres-
sion called
for by the
job.
His patter of wisecracks
and witticisms usually puts them at ease.
When at length he has posed his models, two pos-
sible
procedures
lie
before him.
He can draw and
paint directly from his set-up, as he did for over twenty
years
(see the photographs, page 44)
and sometimes
does even now,
or,
as
is
his more common
practice
today,
he
can
have
an
abundance
of
photographs
taken
to paint from
later at his convenience.
If the
latter course
is pursued,
his photographer—Norman
never uses the camera himself—may take as many as
seventv-five
shots
in
preparation
for
a
single
cover!
While
this
is going on
the
artist
directs
his models,
shifting them from one position to another, rearrang-
ing
the
setting,
changing
the
lighting,
until
every
possibility
has
been
explored.
Sometimes Norman
poses his models singly, rather than in groups.
This
photographic
method
is
common
practice
among
today's
illustrators.
There
are many
argu-
ments for and against
it.
One negative point
is that
paintings
based
on
photographs
are
likely
to
look
too photographic—too inanimate.
As Rockwell says,
"The folks don't step out of the picture and
talk
to
you
as they do when you paint from them directly."
Another disadvantage of working from photographs
is that they often exhibit distortions of form or tone:
the
camera
and
the human
eve
do
not
see
alike.
Only
the
experienced
artist
has
the
skill
to
correct
such distortions.
Then too, the lighting arranged by
the photographer
is
frequently unnatural,
especially
if he employs flash bulbs or throws lights from several
sources at once.
But, by and
large, the camera
is a very useful tool
in the hands of a competent
artist.
One advantage
is
that
it can
record
poses which
a model
couldn't
hold long enough to permit the making of a drawing.
Another point: photographic shots can be taken from
unusual angles—downshots from above, for instance,
or
shots from near
the
floor.
The
artist would
be
unable to
lie on the floor for hours, painting models
above him!
Photographs are also useful for record-
ing
transient
effects,
or subject matter
located
at
a
distance from the studio. Photographs have the added
advantage of allowing the artist to try literally dozens
of compositions of a subject from which he can finally
choose
the
best,
or
combine
the
good
features
of
several.
Rockwell sometimes uses the camera to help
him decide on the right model by taking photos of a
number
of
people
until
he
finds
the
one who
ex-
presses exactly what he wants to say.
Perhaps
the greatest advantage
of the camera for
Norman
is
that
it saves him an amazing amount of
nervous wear and
tear.
He doubts
if he could keep
up
his
present
rapid pace without
it.
"In
the
old
days," he explains, "I would
sit and paint for hours
before a living model, constantly commanding. 'Hold
out
your
chin.'
'Turn
a
bit
more
this
way.'
or
'Straighten up!'
And always
I was painting against
time, rushing to finish before the model's rest period,
or before the light failed.
I was under an awful ten-
sion, particularly as I would act out every one of those
moves for the sitter in order to demonstrate my point.
When quitting time came I was a wreck.
"Then
I began to hear how effectively this or that
illustrator was using the camera.
At
first
I couldn't
believe
it.
Later
I became
convinced
that
it
was
true, but felt that the method was somehow a bit dis-
honest, like cheating at solitaire.
Still later,
I decided
that
there might
be some
merit
to
it
after
all.
It
struck me that the Old Masters, with their inventive-
nesSj would surely have found practical ways of utiliz-
ing the camera had
it been
available.
So
I began
to experiment and discovered that, although the cam-
era
is
a
very
tricky
thing,
it could
be
of legitimate
assistance
if employed
judiciously.
Frankly,
I
don't
know whether my work
is
better or worse
for
it.
I
do know
that
it has helped
to keep me working
all
these years.
"Painting from photographs can be a wholly crea-
tive performance
if the artist himself
is creative.

is not creative.
But one can be crea-
tive by modifying drawing, values and other aspects
of
the
photo
to
realize
the
creative
needs
of
the
subject.
The camera
is no substitute for those crea-
tive
faculties
of mind and hand which have always
produced art—and always will.
The artist who can't
draw
or
paint
will
never
get
anywhere
trying
to
work from
photographs.
An
unskilled
artist,
using
photographs,
can
easily develop
absurdities, such
as
the sun shining from two or three directions at once,
or one object incorrect in size in relation to the whole.
or
perspective
convergences
at
variance
one
with
another."
Even when Rockwell paints directly from the living
model
his approach has always been
a
realistic
one.
"It
has
never been
natural
for me
to deviate from
the
facta of anything before me." he says, "so
I have
always
dressed
the models and posed them
precisely
as
I
have wanted them
in my
picture:
then
I have
I HmIm
M<

t
t
painted the thing before me.
If a model has worn a
red
sweater,
I have painted
it red— I
couldn't
pos-
sibly have made
it
green.
I have
tried
again and
again
to
take such
liberties,
but
with
little
success.
But when working with photographs
I seem able to
recompose in many ways: as to form, tone, and color."
Incidentally, both in posing his models and
in
his
photography—not
to mention
his
later drawing and
painting—Rockwell
is
constantly
on
the
alert
for
anything
which may
improve
his
original
scheme.
Often some chance happening may react
to
his ad-
vantage.
Perhaps
it
rains when an outdoor subject
is being photographed.
Should he allow his photog-
rapher
to stop, discouraged?
No. A rainy-day cover
might be just the thing!
Whether
Rockwell
paints
from
the
model,
from
photographs, or from both, his method from this point
on
is much the same.
If he works from photographs, the day after they
are taken he has a complete
set of 8 x
io
prints in
his hands
before he
starts
painting
in
the morning,
usually around eight o'clock. Spreading them about—
see

selects
those
he
thinks
he
can
use and
discards
the
rest.

still another for a head or an arm. and
so on.

He applies
this freely, rubbing

(He
never

is sometimes necessarv
in
this
charcoal
layout
to draw

it
is

to keep

is
called
in
again:
he photographs the
layout and makes, on mat

several
photographic

at

Rockwell
next works out
his color

of

This
is a rapid
process—far quicker

three
grades—very
rough,
medium,
and
very
smooth.
He keeps
plenty on hand and
selects
the
type best suited
to his current project, tacking
it to a
stretcher frame
of
required
size.
"I
never
cut
off
any excess canvas until the picture
is done," he says,
"because halfway through the
picture
I may decide
that
it would be
better
if
I added an inch on one
side or the other.
In case the canvas
is the least bit
buckled after
it
is stretched,
I moisten it on the back
;
when
it
dries
it becomes
as
tight
as a drumhead."
He has no fixed way of surfacing this canvas.
If he
wishes to obtain a marked degree of texture, he opens
a
can
of Benjamin
Moore's
*'Sani-flat,"
pours
off
most
of
the
liquid
and
stirs
the
remaining
paste
(which
is
very hard)
until
it
is
completely
mixed.
Next, placing
his stretched canvas on the
floor, face
up,
he
brushes
the
thick
Sani-flat
over
its
entire
surface.
When
this paint has been well distributed,
and
before
it
dries,
it
is
possible
to do
all
sorts
of
things
to
it
to create
interesting
textures.
One can
pat
it with a big brush, or put a piece of paper over
the whole
surface and
pull
it
oft"
again.
"Some
of
the fellows,"
says Rockwell,
"press mosquito netting
and
the
like
into
the paint
to gain
the
effects
they
want, removing the material, of course, once
its im-
pression
is made.
It
takes
the
Sani-flat
half a day
to dry thoroughly
; once dry,
it forms a most beautiful
white
flat ground.
But
it's probably too much to ex-
pect permanency."
Occasionally Rockwell substitutes
for canvas the support favored by the Old Masters, a
wood panel prepared with a gesso ground.
Sometimes
he
paints
a
small
picture on
a
piece
of AVhatman
hot-pressed board, coating
it
first with shellac.
Step
10:
Transferring
to Canvas.
Rockwell now
makes
a
transfer from
his
full-size
charcoal
layout
to
the prepared canvas
as
follows:
First, he
lays
a
sheet of architects'
tracing paper—it
is nearly

parent—over the charcoal
layout.
On
this he care-
fullv
traces
the
entire
subject
in
pencil.
Next,
he
shifts
this
tracing
paper
to
the
canvas,
putting
a
sheet
of
transfer paper between
tracing and
canvas.
This must not be the carbon type which stenograph-
ers
use:
that would ruin the whole
thins: because
ol
its
penetrating
dye.)
He now
painstakingly
relines
each
line on
the
tracing
paper,
thus
transferrins
a
corresponding
image
onto
the
canvas:
this
is
then
sprayed with
fixatif to hold
it in place.
Asked
it
,ui assistant couldn't do this tracing, Rock-
well replied, "It
is next to impossible to find a capable
tracer.
There seem
to be only three
types:
the
'cre-
ative'
tracer who
tries
to improve
the
artist's
work,
the
'pernickety'
tracer who
traces
every thumb-tack
hole or
fly speck
in the paper, and the 'don't-give-a-
damn'
tracer
who
gets
everything
wrong.
That's
why

still
trace- my own."
Some
illustrators
transfer
by
another
method.
Photographing
their
charcoal
layout,
they
project
the photographii
image onto canvas by means of the
Balopticon or some similar projector, just as a lantern
slide
is thrown upon the screen.
The projected forms
are
then
outlined
on
the canvas
in
pencil
or
char-
coal,
alter which
they may be perfected
at
leisure.
While
considering
the
Balopticon, we
might add
that
it
is now
quite common practice among illustra-
tors, Once
their
models have
been
photographed,
to

Step
ii
:
Imprimatura.
Rockwell
is now
ready
to
paint.
He
usually
starts
by
staining
his
canvas
all
over with
a
thin, even coating,
called an "imprima-
tura," of a single color of oil paint, the hue of which
is determined by
the general
color scheme
intended
for
the
picture.
His pigment
for
this imprimatura
is usually thinned considerably with rectified turpen-
tine and
then rubbed over
the
entire canvas with a
rag.
Step
12:
Underpainting
in
Monochrome.
When
this imprimatura
is dry
(a matter of only a few min-
utes
)
.
the next move
is
to make upon
it an "under-
painting"
of
the
subject,
using a
single
color— raw
umber,
perhaps.
To
obtain
the
light
tones
of
this
underpainting Norman
uses no white, but dilutes
his
paint with turpentine.
He also tries for a sort of dry-
brush
quality.
Thus he gradually completes a mono-
chromatic
roughing-in
of
his
entire
subject.
With
this
underpainting

varnishes
his

The arrangement of these colors on Nor-

the accom-

Brushes,

Rockwell's preference
is for Rubens'
long bristle flats in a variety of sizes.
He avoids sable
brushes
excepting
for
small,
very
difficult
bits
of
detail.
Sables, he claims, are quite certain
to make
one's work too slick, smooth and uninteresting.

Step
1
»:
Final Painting.
Once Rockwell's allover
color
lay-in has been completed and has dried over-
night, he varnishes
it, using alcohol thinner
to dilute
the
varnish.
This
dries almost immediately and he
is ready to start his final painting.
In some instances
he paints the background
first, and saves for
last the
central head
(or heads).
In
others,
he
starts with
a head and paints from
there.
Stated
differently,
if
the atmosphere
of the
picture
is
the
vital
thing, he
first
paints the atmosphere, and then puts the figures
or
faces
in
the atmosphere;
if
a
head
counts
more-,
he
first paints the head and then docs the background.
In some
scenes he
paints
the distance
first,
then
the
middle
distance
and,
finally,
the
foreground
and
figures.
Whatever
his method
in
detail, he keeps
all
parts
developing
simultaneously,
believing
that
at
practically
ever)
stage
a
painting should have
a
fin-
ished
look.
Technical Methods.
Norman
follows
all
the- usual
orthodox
procedures.
In much
of
his work he em-
ploys
the-
typical
impasto
or
opaque
(solid

method common
to America,
in which the paints
.un-
applied practically as the) come from the tubes, being

enough
to
make
them
amenable- to brush application.

this
moistened
area,
gaining
a
hard-to-define
but
often
desirable character.
"Painting over dry paint
is
very
unsatisfactory
to
me,"
explains
Rockwell.
"Painting in soup permits a pleasant blending of the
new and former work."
As he
proceeds, he
often
finds
that many
of
the
"happy
accidents"
arrived
at
in
his
lay-in
can
be
preserved.
He
tells
of
the student who once asked
Dean Cornwell what to do
if one of these accidents
occurred.
"Get down
on
your
knees,"
the
noted
artist said, "and thank God for it."
"This way
I paint
is technically terrible," Norman
states, "piling paint on varnish and varnish on paint,
coat
after
coat,
without
adequate
time
for
drying.
John Atherton
says that
it's a wonder my paintings
don't explode.
Perhaps some day they
will!
I
cer-
tainly wouldn't want
to guarantee
their
durability.
But I'm inclined
to agree with Richard Miller who
to
do.
One
should never
just paint along vaguely
from
start
to
finish, hoping that sooner or
later the
picture will turn out
all right.
He should plot every
step and work
to a fixed schedule.
At
least / think
he should.
And he should take every possible means
to insure
success.
For example, by varnishing every
so often
as
I
do,
if something goes wrong
1 can rub
it
off with turpentine down
to the varnish, without
losing the painting beneath."
Rockwell
fears
that
his
greatest
fault
is
carrying
his
paintings too
far.
"Often my rough studies are
better
than my
finished
work,"
he
admits.
"Fre-
quently my wife sees a painting, say at ten o'clock in
the morning.
I am working on a head.
She thinks
it
is swell and says, 'Don't touch
it again.'
Then she
comes out at noon and
tells me
I have spoiled
it by
slicking
it up too much.
And
she's
right.
Even
if
I
try,
I can never get back the freshness of the
first
lay-in, with
its accidents.
But that's how
I do it."
Rockwell
sits at his work about half the time and
stands
the
rest.
"The
older
I
grow,
the more
I
stand,"
is
his comment.
His
working day
is
long.
He is usually in the studio at eight or eight-thirty and,
excepting
for
a
half
hour
at
noon
for
lunch—he
reads
as
he
eats—and
a
brief
recess
at
about two
when he goes to the house for a "coke" and his mail,
he keeps plugging away until he
is called
for dinner
at
six.
After dinner,
it
is not uncommon for him to
return
to
the studio for a
while,
either
to
paint,
to
clean
his
brushes
and
palette—he
does
this
every
night,
first with turpentine and next with Ivory soap
—or
to
plan
his
next
day's
work.
During
all
this
period he seldom
relaxes
his
effort excepting,
if he
finds
himself growing
tense,
to knock
off
for
a few
minutes to tidy up his studio.
When
a new
painting
is
started,
the
first day
or
two require
intensively
creative work—his very
best
thought and energy—but after that, many hours must
be spent on such tedious tasks as transferring to can-
didn't consider permanency too important.
'Let the
next generation paint
its own pictures,' was the sub-
stance
of
his comment.
One
thing
is
sure;
this
is
the only method
I
could
possibly use and meet my
deadlines.
I
couldn't meet
them,
even
as
it
is,
if
I didn't plan every move in advance and hold to my
schedule.
Some
artists
don't seem
to
worry
about
time,
but
in
illustration
it's
advisable
to make up
your mind to do a certain definite amount in a given
period and then do
it.
It's surprising, but true, that
you can accomplish
just about what you determine
vas,
filling
in
the
background
and
doing
details.
Rockwell sometimes
likes
to be read
to during these
otherwise
monotonous
periods.
Years
ago,
John
Malone,
one
of
his models,
started
this
practice by
reading
aloud
as
he
posed.
"He
read
beautifully,
eight hours a day," Norman
relates, "but never fully
comprehended anything he read.
We covered quite

Framing
and
Delivery.
As
Rockwell
works,
he
often
slips
his
painting
into
a
frame

aid him
in appraising the
effect and. once

pleted, be frames

And
in
this he
follows
his own advice.
Many people
say. "But

in
the frame.

replies,

Not
all
illustrators are as painstaking as Rockwell.
He considers that students and young illustrators are
likely
to
be
too
impatient and
casual
about many
things
-too much
inclined
to
rush
a
job
through,
to call
it good enough.
He believes that they should
be
willing
to make any
effort or
sacrifice
that may
lead
to
better
results.
"Neither time nor
effort nor
materials
should
be spared
if worthy work
is
to be
expected," he
says.
"Even
if
it
is
necessary
to give
up something—something outside the studio—in order
to
net
the
right things in the studio.
I think
it
is
al-
most criminal
not
to do
it that way.
I
learned
this
from Leyendecker
years ago—he never

or money.

I was in his studio when
he was doing a picture of an American aviator.
His
model was
wearing an

coat which
Leyen-
decker had bought.
He
told me
that
the
artist had
paid
forty dollars
for
this jacket and had given
it
to
him
to keep.
But
if Leyendecker hadn't done
that,

the
right characters to serve as models; how he rounds
up "props" from town and countryside.
We find ourselves chuckling with him as he spins yarns
about
his amusing encounters with
all
kinds of people
who have figured in one way or another in his amazing
career.
For those who are curious to learn about Rockwell's
technical procedures — what kind of paints, brushes, can-
vases, mediums and varnishes he uses — the book is a gold
mine.
It might appropriately have been
entitled, "How
to Become
a
Successful
Illustrator,"
so completely
has
Rockwell's success story been told.
Artists and laymen all will rejoice in the possession of
this volume which, fundamentally,
is a mammoth picture
book
filled with hundreds of Rockwell's paintings and
drawings covering every period of his life's work to date.
His most ardent fans and collectors have a treat in store
for them in the drawings made exclusively for this book
(88 chapter headings and marginal sketches). Rockwell
also has written extensive captions for many of the pic-
tures, in which he describes his reasons and procedures in
the execution of
his
ideas.
