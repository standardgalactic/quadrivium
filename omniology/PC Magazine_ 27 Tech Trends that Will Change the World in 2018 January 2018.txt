T
his month‚Äôs cover story for the PC 
Magazine Digital Edition is loaded with 
tech predictions for 2018. We interviewed 
dozens of engineers, executives, and futurists and 
got their opinions on where technology is 
KHDGLQJ¬≤XUVWRU\LV¬øOOHGZLWKUHYHDOLQJLQVLJKWV
from a wide spectrum of industry pioneers. But I 
want to clarify one thing: We are already living in 
the future. 
This assertion was best expressed by William 
Gibson, who said, ‚ÄúThe future is already here‚Äîit‚Äôs 
just not very evenly distributed.‚Äù Indeed, while 
there the are important debates to be had about 
the negative effects of unequal income 
distribution, unequal ‚Äúfuture distribution‚Äù may be 
the more important issue to track.
To see the future, you just have to look in the right 
places. I‚Äôve been travelling a lot during the past 
few months and have had the opportunity to see 
the future right now, all over the world. Here are 
just a few examples. 
I was in Hong Kong a few months ago and got to 
see what a cashless society looks like‚Äîand it looks 
like an octopus. Octopus is a cashless payment 
provider operating in that city that allows for NFC 
transactions to purchase cab rides, parking, 
convenience store items, and even meals. The 
company just launched a QR-code-based system 
to augment Octopus that doesn‚Äôt require the 
presence of NFC readers. Now the market is about 
to be taken over by WeChat Pay and Alipay, which 
offer even more ubiquity.

You may not know this if you don‚Äôt work in law

At the same time, every major city is converting to

Those Job-
Stealing 
Robots 
YOUR COMMENTS
READER INPUT
The entire history of civilization has been the 
development of the division of labor, with labor-
saving devices making society wealthier and 
raising standards of living. The Industrial 
Revolution threw huge numbers of people out of 
work by replacing hand work with machines. But 
the ultimate result was a higher standard of living 
for everyone. True, modern robotics pose new 
problems for employment that we haven‚Äôt seen 
before. But those problems are made much worse 
by ruling class policies of importing huge 
numbers of unskilled and low-skilled workers. 
The upper classes get cheap labor, cheap nannies 
and gardeners, etc. Everybody else gets lower 
wages and higher unemployment. 
‚ÄîBizarro World Observer
We‚Äôve been ‚Äúlosing jobs‚Äù to robots for a very long 
time. But do we want to go back to having people 
calculating bank interest by hand, operating 
elevators manually, or hand-sewing every stitch 
of clothing we wear? In reality, there are jobs that 
computers are good at replacing and others they 
can‚Äôt replace easily. Labor pricing is one place 
where tipping points are going to shift in favor of 
computer/robotic replacement of humans. A 
touch-screen-computer ordering system costs 
more upfront but saves lots of high-minimum 
wage labor. Supermarket self-checkout cuts down 
the number of checkers dramatically. 
Manufacturing is more likely to move overseas, 
which has a heavy surplus of cheap labor (India 
and China).
‚ÄîJeffrey Clinard
John C. Dvorak‚Äôs 
December column 
raised the specter of 
workers being 
displaced by robots. 
Here‚Äôs how readers 
reacted online.
RESUME

John‚Äôs proposition on labour displacement is correct, but the real issue that follows 
in an economic one. If nobody is working, then where does the tax revenue come 
from to fuel the publicly funded side of the economy? It‚Äôs probably impractical to tax 
the robots that have initiated the problem, and fewer and fewer wealthy people will 
own all the businesses in their entirety. Ergo, we are going to have to move to 
taxation systems based on the holding of assets instead of the present one based on 
earned incomes. By the way, no point in yelling ‚Äúbloody commie‚Äù at me‚ÄîI‚Äôm in my 
mid 70s and won‚Äôt be around to see the resolution  of these issues, but my 
grandchildren are going to have to live with it.
‚Äîmmpaca
Markets and economies have an equilibrium. If nobody has a job because they are 
displaced by robots, then nobody will be able to buy the things the robots are 
making, and the factory goes under. And the price of labor gets cheaper such that 
EX\LQJURERWVLVQRORQJHUFRPSHWLWLYH$QG.VKDYHGLVSODFHGGH¬øQHGEHQH¬øW
pensions (except for those lucky enough to work for the government). And stop 
fearing the forward march of technology‚Äîthat and cheap foreign labor (think of 
these as cyborgs) is why you‚Äôre living better now than you ever have. Robots? Bring 
them on!

ualcomm‚Äôs new Snapdragon 845 processor will make your photos 
brighter, your connections faster, and even stretch out the battery life in 
your wireless headphones. At the company‚Äôs Snapdragon Summit, we 
heard all about the 845‚Äôs new features and got hands-on time with a reference 
phone. Here are some of the coolest features in the Snapdragon 845.
QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON 845
This little chip is at the heart of the Snapdragon 845 experience. Unlike with PC 
CPUs, the Snapdragon 845 isn‚Äôt a single powerful processor. Instead, it‚Äôs a 
complex system of different components for different tasks, all joined together.
Hands On With the Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 845  BY SASCHA SEGAN  
MOBILE CHIPS
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

WHAT‚ÄôS INSIDE
Qualcomm upgraded several of the components from its Snapdragon 835. The 
X20 modem now lets wireless carriers hit gigabit LTE with a much more 
√ÄH[LEOHFRPELQDWLRQRIIUHTXHQFLHVPDNLQJLWPRUHOLNHO\WKDW\RX¬∂OOVHHJLJDELW
LTE near you. The Adreno GPU is 30 percent faster. The new image signal 
processor captures 4K HDR video with very broad colors.
THE KRYO 385 CPU
The Kryo 385 CPU is based on ARM‚Äôs Cortex-A75 and A55 cores, but 
4XDOFRPPVD\VLWKDVGRQHVLJQL¬øFDQWFXVWRPL]DWLRQPRVWQRWDEO\LQWHUPVRI
adding a shared L3 cache across all of the cores to smooth performance in 
multi-core workloads. Qualcomm CDMA Technologies president Cristiano 
Amon told us that much of the chip‚Äôs processing load is handled by DSPs and 
the GPU, however.

ULTRAHD PREMIUM
7KH6QDSGUDJRQLVWKH¬øUVWPRELOHFKLSWRUHFRUGLQ¬≥8OWUD+'3UHPLXP¬¥
which combines 4K, HDR, and the broad Rec 2020 color space for stunning 
photos and videos. It also supports the more common HDR10 format.
ACTIVE DEPTH SENSING
The Snapdragon 845 has a lot of features for augmented and virtual reality. One 
of the keys is active depth sensing, using an infrared camera to take a live, 3D 
map of what‚Äôs in front of you. Phone makers will need to install the infrared 
cameras on their phones, though.

SUPER-FAST WI-FI
We‚Äôve been hearing about 802.11ad for three years now. Also called WiGig, it‚Äôs a 
way to transmit data at extremely fast speeds over short distances, basically 
within the same room. You‚Äôd use it to share a gigabit connection, whether as a 
client or as a hotspot. There are a few 802.11ad routers out there. Snapdragon 
845 phones will support 802.11ad with two sets of antennas, so if your hand is 
covering one, the other one can still transmit.
FACIAL RECOGNITION
Of course, the Snapdragon 845 does secure facial scanning.

IMPROVING BLUETOOTH BATTERY LIFE
I really liked this feature. Qualcomm is able to split 
stereo Bluetooth transmissions into separate left and 
right streams and beam them to true wireless earbuds 
separately. That means the earbuds only have to receive 
(right now, one earbud needs to transmit to the other, 
which consumes a lot of battery power). This will make 
for much longer battery life for true wireless earbuds, 
although the trick won‚Äôt work with existing earbuds.
QUALCOMM 845 PHONE
Here‚Äôs the Snapdragon 845 reference phone. You aren‚Äôt 
going to be able to get this phone at retail, but it gave us 
a feel of what the Snapdragon 845 experience will be 
like in real life.

PLAYING LINEAGE II
I played Lineage II: Revolution on the Snapdragon 845 reference phone. It 
looked great and played smoothly, with lots of lighting effects. The 845 supports 
4K screens at 60fps as well as 2K phone screens at 120fps.
FASTEST LTE SPEED EVER
The new X20 modem is capable of 1.2Gbps speeds, which is the fastest we‚Äôve 
seen in a production LTE modem. But more important, it gives wireless carriers

VR EXPERIENCE WITH HAND TRACKING
This standalone VR headset let me walk around a room 
and use my hands as controllers. The experience didn‚Äôt 
work very well‚Äîthere was some visual tearing and my 
hands often felt out of place‚Äîbut, obviously, it wasn‚Äôt 
production software. The 845 promises AR and VR 
experiences with full-room and object mapping, not the

far in ARKit and ARCore.
QUALCOMM SMART SPEAKER
The 845‚Äôs audio chip is very good at separating your 
voice from surrounding music and noise, as we saw in a 
demo with this smart speaker. The chip is probably too 
expensive for mainstream speakers, but Qualcomm is 
driving the 845‚Äôs audio capabilities down into cheaper 
chipsets that don‚Äôt have the 845‚Äôs video capabilities.

How Technology and 
Fashion Intersect
FAST FORWARD
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

We cover fashion technology at PCMag‚Ä¶. when it‚Äôs 
Fashion Week, and we send people to the show. 
This year it seemed a little disappointing, from a 
technology perspective.
Yes, that‚Äôs interesting. Disappointing. So one of the main 
things that changed this year as opposed to some of the 
most recent years, is that there‚Äôs no longer a partnership 
happening between the CFDA, which is the Council of 
)DVKLRQ'HVLJQHUVRI$PHULFDZKRSXWVRQWKHRI¬øFLDO
Fashion Week. Their partnership with Intel is not 
happening anymore.
And coincidentally, a little less technology this year.
Exactly. In fact, Intel has dissolved their fashion group 
and kind of absorbed them into some of the other groups, 
so that partnership isn‚Äôt going on anymore. We‚Äôre not 
seeing that big push that‚Äôs at the forefront. But I would 
say that technology has completely upended Fashion 
Week. Even though we weren‚Äôt necessarily seeing things 
as much on the runways, the entirety of Fashion Week 
and [the event] in general has changed because of 
technology.
The fashion industry is in this, some would say crisis, 
because of this idea that‚Äôs called ‚Äúsee now, buy now‚Äù‚Äî
which basically means that people are buying what‚Äôs 
being shown on the runways as opposed to waiting six 
months or [more] for whatever is on the runway to 
actually come into a store‚Ä¶ When we show something on 
the runway, everyone posts it on Instagram, all these 
LQ√ÄXHQFHUVPD\EHJHWVDPSOHVRIWKHLWHPV%\WKHWLPH
it‚Äôs in the store six months later, there is so much fatigue 
in seeing our cool new designs that people don‚Äôt want to 
buy [them] anymore. So a lot of designers are trying to 
¬øJXUHRXWZKHQWRDFWXDOO\EHVKLSSLQJWKHFORWKHVWKDW
they‚Äôre showing on the runway.
Even though we 
weren‚Äôt 
necessarily 
seeing things as 
much on the 
runways, Fashion 
Week has 
changed because 
of technology.

That‚Äôs really interesting. Because the whole fashion industry was 
generally around a print cycle, and you‚Äôd have the fall line and the spring 
line, and there‚Äôd be months between when these things would be 
shown and then when they would actually be shipped.
Right, right. So long.
And now, you‚Äôre saying that whole thing has collapsed, and people want 
to buy now. And if they don‚Äôt build it and ship it now, somebody‚Äôs going 
to copy it and ship their version of it.
Always. The fast fashion, the Zaras and the Forever 21s and H&Ms of the world, 
they knock off stuff from the higher-end designers and even from indie 
designers. And they have it in the stores in two weeks‚Äîan insane time to 
market. They won‚Äôt see something, it‚Äôll be like a completely blank slate, and in 
two weeks they‚Äôll have it in stores, which is an incredible thing to do on the back 
end. But that‚Äôs another technological advance, if you will, that is pushing the 
fashion industry out of its comfort zone and having to change things entirely.
Can you talk a little bit about that, the rapid manufacturing model 
that‚Äôs gotten transformed? Rapid prototyping, but rapid prototyping 
at scale, where they‚Äôll build thousands of garments and send them all 
over the country.
Yes, [it happens] very quickly. And so some of the most interesting innovations 
in fashion are actually happening on the back end, behind the scenes in ways 
that consumers won‚Äôt see. I think a lot of times when we think of fashion tech, 
we think of either wearables or maybe a dress that lights up on the runway.
Technology elements‚Äîand I think it‚Äôs interesting that Intel may have 
had something to do with this‚Äîincorporating technology into the 
runways seemed a little forced a lot of times.
Right, absolutely.
Why are we shooting this with drones when we‚Äôre surrounded by 
photographers?

Why not? Because drones are there. And I think that there‚Äôs been an interesting 
thing that‚Äôs happened with fashion and with technology in that for a long time, 
the brands that people wanted and the money that, let‚Äôs say teenagers, were 
spending was going into fashion. I myself, when I was spending money as a 
teenager, I was spending it on certain brands of clothing. I wanted some Pepe 
jeans and an Aspree bag. I‚Äôm sure anyone else that was born in 1978 is like, ‚ÄúYes, 
I wanted that, too.‚Äù But right now, my daughter who is a teenager is not at all 
interested in fashion brands. She is interested in expressing herself, how she 
looks, and trends, but she could give a care about what the brands are. She‚Äôs 
more interested in making sure that she has the latest gadgets.
Because it enables her lifestyle in a way that clothing may or may not.
And she‚Äôs able to have expression as well. So, whereas before we might be 
expressing ourselves through our clothing, now she is very expressive on 
Snapchat, you know or through these other platforms. Dollars are moving from 
being spent on fashion to being spent on technology. So that‚Äôs something that 
fashion is really trying to grapple with‚Äîhow do we compete with this, how do 
we embrace this? And so we have a lot of these slacked on partnerships where 
\RX¬øQGGURQHVRQWKHUXQZD\RU\RXUGUHVVOLJKWVXS$QGWKDW¬∂VQRW
necessarily something that consumers are demanding, it‚Äôs marketing.
Google Glass made its epic debut during Fashion Week and it turned out 
to be a disaster. I wish somebody had asked me in advance whether or 
not this was a good idea. This was never going to belong on the runway. 
And by forcing it up there, it really highlighted all of the device‚Äôs 
weaknesses and none of its strengths.
You know, it‚Äôs interesting. I know the people that worked on that partnership 
and made that decision, and they don‚Äôt see it as an epic fail. I learned by asking 
how they felt about their epic fail! But they see it as, they wanted to test the 
market, and they tested the market, and they see it as a successful test.

O
ne of the greatest fears among 
automotive enthusiasts is that when 
vehicles become autonomous, the joy of 
driving will disappear, and we‚Äôll lose any 
emotional connection to cars. Even if you‚Äôre not a 
hardcore motorhead and hate your daily 
commute, you can probably imagine missing, say, 
the sensation of hitting the gas to get around a 
slowpoke or the visceral feeling that comes from 
controlling a multi-ton machine.
Several companies are working on ways to ensure 
humans feel comfortable in self-driving cars‚Äî
despite a perceived loss of control or fear of 
hurling from motion sickness. But a project 
developed by Hyundai and the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art goes a step further to 
explore how to improve the relationship between 
people and autonomous vehicles.
Titled The Roadable Synapse, the project centers 
around a prototype car that‚Äôs based on a Hyundai 
Ioniq, created by artist Jonathon Keats with the 
help of Hyundai engineer Ryan Ayler. Though the 
vehicle is piloted by a person, the goal is to learn 
how to engage humans in the operation of an 
autonomous vehicle rather than having them 
become passive passengers.

COMMENTARY

First, Keats and Ayler developed an interface that allows the driver to 
better perceive the car‚Äôs actions, whether punching the accelerator to 
pass or carving a hard turn, by controlling music playback. The music 
speeds up along with the car to give those inside a sense of being in sync 
with the vehicle.
‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is using data from the car‚Äôs computer to modulate the 
signal, so the driver experiences what the car is experiencing,‚Äù Keats told 
Wired magazine. ‚ÄúThe faster tempo arouses you emotionally, which 
alters your perception.‚Äù
Keats points to smartphones, which ‚Äúbecame a sort of cognitive and 
emotional extension of ourselves. They‚Äôve become part of us‚Äîwe get 
anxious when we‚Äôre separated from our devices,‚Äù he said. So Keats and 
$\OHUDUH¬≥DSSO\LQJQHXURVFLHQWL¬øFUHVHDUFKWRPHUJHWKHKXPDQDQGWKH
machine in a more organic way. It‚Äôs the car-as-wearable,‚Äù he told Wired.
One example of this is a seatbelt attachment that Keats and Ayler put 
together called a ‚Äúhunger undulator.‚Äù It uses vibrating motors to mimic 
stomach contractions so passengers feel hungry as the car starts to get 
low on fuel. Keats also came up with the idea of a power seat with 
settings that raise the occupant‚Äôs stress level when the car needs 
servicing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tapping into hormones,‚Äù Keats said.
At the core of Keats‚Äôs approach is that despite the prevailing wisdom, 
he‚Äôs not convinced that autonomous cars will completely decouple us 
from the experience we know today as driving. According to Keats, you 
could become even closer to your car in the future‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre not in 
control.

Silicon Valley, from social networks 
accepting Russian ad dollars to corporate tax 
issues. But I see the growing wage gap as one of 
the biggest problems for the region, as well as for 
tech hubs such as Seattle, San Jose, and Austin. 
It‚Äôs especially pronounced in the Midwest, the 
Rust Belt, and the south, where many people feel 
left behind by the rise of automation, jobs moving 
offshore, and a shift in markets. It‚Äôs no wonder so 
many look at the excesses of Silicon Valley in a 
negative light these days.
The chart below from the Economic Innovation 
Group Communities Index, which shows just how 
distressed many communities are in the US, 
should be very troubling to tech leaders and

The Tech World Needs to 
Get Serious About the 
Wage Gap
Tim Bajarin
COMMENTARY
Tim Bajarin is the 
president of Creative 
Strategies and a 
consultant, analyst, 
and futurist covering 
personal computers 
and consumer 
technology.

With the exception of a few years abroad and a 
stint in Illinois, I‚Äôve lived in San Jose and worked 
in the tech industry all of my life. But I‚Äôve been 
aware of the wage discrepancy issue for a long 
time; I heard rumblings of a Silicon Valley 
EDFNODVKDWOHDVW¬øYH\HDUVDJR1RZLQWKHZDNH
RIWKHHOHFWLRQDQGWKH5XVVLDQLQ√ÄXHQFH
controversy, we‚Äôre even hearing calls for tech 
companies to be regulated or broken up.
At the heart of this is an age-old question about 
sharing the wealth, which is often at odds in a 
capitalist society. As a child, I was pushed to excel 
and do my best and was told that what I earned 
was mine. For most workers, that is still their 
mantra. But when they see bankers, tech leaders, 
and some politicians making millions or billions 
of dollars, sometimes at workers‚Äô expense, it‚Äôs 
hard not to question the system.
I will let others debate capitalism versus socialism 
versus communism. But the tech world does need 
to become more sensitive to the fact that our 
earning potential has grown while many in the 
US have seen their wages stagnating and have 
little hope of getting a better, higher-paid gig. 
We‚Äôre on the fast track to greater wage disparity, 
and at some point, those who are struggling will 
rebel‚Äîat the ballot box or in the streets.
The tech world needs to take this seriously. I

Valley needs to use its innovative spirit to help 
their fellow citizen as much as their bottom line.

LG X Charge Phone Keeps 
Going and Going

REVIEWS

DESIGN, DISPLAY, AND FEATURES
The LG X Charge is a phone without pretension. It has a 
simple, textured, gray-plastic back, slick plastic sides, 
and a large black bezel. The back is nice and grippy, and 
the polycarbonate build is free of the creakiness you 
VRPHWLPHV¬øQGRQOHVVH[SHQVLYHGHYLFHV,WGRHVQ¬∂WIHHO
cheap, but the comparable Moto G5 Plus offers a nicer, 
metal build.
The phone measures 6.1 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches (HWD) 
and weighs 5.8 ounces. That‚Äôs similar to the G5 Plus 
(5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces), and a little 
thinner than the Moto E4 Plus (6.1 by 3.1 by 0.4 
inches), which has an even larger battery. The phone‚Äôs 
width, along with a large bottom bezel, makes it hard to 
use with one hand.
Unlike most new LG phones, the buttons are not on the 
back of the phone. Instead, the X Charge has a power 
button on the right and a volume rocker on the left. It 
also has a SIM/microSD card slot on the left that

Sturdy build. Excellent

Ô¨Ångerprint sensor. 
Lackluster camera. 
Not compatible with 
Verizon. 

The X Charge has a 5.5-inch, 1,280-by-720 TFT LCD. The resolution works out 
to 267 pixels per inch (ppi), which is a bit soft for the size. The 5.2-inch, 1080p 
panel on the G5 Plus (424ppi) gives you a much crisper image and has better 
viewing angles. That said, text and images look sharp enough on the X Charge, 
and viewing angles are decent, aside from some slight tinting when you view it 
from the side. Screen brightness isn‚Äôt very high, so the display can be hard to 
see in direct sunlight.
NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND CONNECTIVITY
The unlocked X Charge has LTE bands 2/4/5/13 with support for AT&T, Sprint,

on T-Mobile and saw good network performance in heavily congested midtown 
Manhattan, with top speeds of 19.6Mbps down and 15Mbps up.
Call quality is decent: Transmissions can sound a bit muddy on outgoing calls, 
but noise cancellation is very effective at blotting out background sound, and

environment it can be a little hard to hear.
Additional connectivity protocols are limited. You get Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz 
band and Bluetooth 4.2, both standard fare, though the similarly priced G5 Plus 
has dual-band Wi-Fi.
PROCESSOR, BATTERY, AND CAMERA
The X Charge is powered by a MediaTek 6750 chipset clocked at 1.5GHz. In the 
AnTuTu benchmark, which measures overall system performance, the phone 
scored 39,447, a little higher than the Snapdragon 427‚Äìpowered Moto E4 Plus 
(37,606). But it‚Äôs not nearly as powerful as the G5 Plus, which has a more 
capable Snapdragon 625 (63,845).
The phone has 2GB of RAM under the hood, giving you a decent ability to 
multitask, though performance can be sluggish. The phone hangs when you‚Äôre 
switching between apps, animations stutter, and it usually takes a few seconds 
to launch a new app. That said, I never experienced any crashes, and the phone 
handled key tasks such as browsing and navigation without issue. High-end 
games are beyond reach, though, as frame rates are too low and latency is too 
high for most FPS or racing games to be playable.

Battery life is likely the reason you‚Äôre here. With its 
4,500mAh cell, the X Charge clocked an impressive 11 
hours 8 minutes on our rundown test, in which we 
stream video over LTE at full brightness. That‚Äôs one of 
the longest results we‚Äôve seen, handily beating the G5 
Plus (7:35) and coming a close second to the 5,000mAh 
E4 Plus (11:44). The phone lasted for two days of 
UHJXODUXVHZLWKRXWDQ\GLI¬øFXOW\DQGLQVWDQGE\PRGH
it lasted nearly a week. Fast charging is supported, but 
fully charging the phone‚Äôs massive battery takes time.
Camera quality is a low point. The 13-megapixel rear 
camera takes mediocre photos in the best of 
circumstances. Even on a bright day, the X Charge takes 
muddy, noisy photos. Colors look undersaturated, with 
bright blues and whites appearing gray and washed out, 
making a sunny day look dull and depressing. Low-light 
shots are (unsurprisingly) not any better. Autofocus 
misses the mark more often than not and turns out 
blurry shots, or it simply gives you a grainy mess.
The camera records 1080p video at 30fps. Video tends 
to be on the soft side and drops frames in lower light,

The X Charge 
clocked an 
impressive 11 
hours 8 minutes 
on our rundown

SOFTWARE
The X Charge comes running Android 7.1.1 Nougat. LG‚Äôs UI layer makes a

menus. By default, apps are splashed across the home screen, and the app 
drawer is removed, but you can change that in Settings.
We tested the X Charge model subsidized by Amazon advertising, which means 
ads appear on the lock screen, and a removable widget on the home screen 
shows you deals, products, and services that may be of interest to you. If you log 
into your Amazon account, it‚Äôll be personalized; otherwise, you get generic 
offers.
The X Charge comes with no extra frills or features. As for preinstalled apps, 
you get Amazon‚Äôs full suite of nine apps, from Audible to Prime Video as well as 
Facebook, Instagram, and LG SmartWorld. Out of 16GB of total storage, a mere 
5.79GB is available, which isn‚Äôt much if you plan to take lots of photos or 
download music. You can use an SD card as removable media, but it‚Äôs not 
possible to make it integrated storage.
CONCLUSIONS
The LG X Charge offers a reasonable level of performance and tons of battery 
life for the price. If you‚Äôre a heavy user or a major traveler, the battery can last 
you longer than most other midrange phones. But as far as Amazon Prime 
phones go, you have better options. For a little bit more money, the Moto G5 
Plus offers a faster processor, sharper screen, and higher-quality metal build 
(albeit with less battery life). Even when battery is your primary concern, the 
Moto E4 Plus lasts longer than the X Charge and costs $30 less‚Äîplus it has a

RHA made its name with affordable, good-
looking earphones that sound far better than 
you might expect for the price. After releasing 
models in recent years that sounded great but 
were relatively expensive, the RHA MA390 
Universal earphones feel like a return to the company‚Äôs 
roots, with a stylish design, a solid array of accessories, 
and a wallet-friendly price. One might suspect that 
RHA cut corners on audio performance, but the sound 
quality is excellent, with full-bodied bass that doesn‚Äôt 
distort and crisp, detailed high-frequency response. 
That earns the MA390 our Editors‚Äô Choice for 
affordable earphones.

DESIGN
The MA390 Universal‚Äôs black-and-silver design 
includes details we often see in more expensive pairs, 
including aluminum earpieces and cloth-lined cabling. 
The lightweight earpieces are emblazoned with the 
5+$ORJR7KH\¬øWVHFXUHO\DQGFRPIRUWDEO\LQWKHHDU
sealing off the canal. Internally, dynamic drivers deliver 
a frequency range that RHA claims to be roughly 16Hz 
to 22kHz.
An inline remote control runs along the right earpiece‚Äôs 
cable, at roughly chin level. It‚Äôs of the single-button 
variety, which means you won‚Äôt be able to adjust 
volume levels with it. But it controls playback, call 
management, and track navigation (two taps for 
forward, three for backward).
The inline mic offers excellent intelligibility. Using the 
Voice Memos app on an iPhone 6s, we could 
understand every word we recorded clearly, and it was a 
high-quality recording. The mic picks up a decent 
amount of low-frequency content, and no obvious audio 
artifacts mucked things up.

with quality materials 
and a decent array of 
included accessories. 
Clear mic 
intelligibility. 
CONS Remote control

Mids are scooped out 
a bit. 

The earphones ship with more accessories than most 
budget pairs. You get a padded drawstring pouch, a 
shirt clip, and three pairs of silicone eartips. From the 
use of quality materials to the accessories, RHA has 
made the MA390 Universal look and feel like a product 
that costs at least twice as much.
PERFORMANCE
On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The 
Knife‚Äôs ‚ÄúSilent Shout,‚Äù the earphones deliver a powerful 
low frequency response that will appeal to bass lovers. 
At top, unwise listening levels, the bass never distorts 
on this challenging track‚Äîan impressive feat for $30 
earphones. At more reasonable listening levels, the sub-
bass still packs quite a punch and is balanced out by a 
solid high-mid and high frequency presence.
Bill Callahan‚Äôs ‚ÄúDrover,‚Äù a track with far less deep bass 
in the mix, gives us a better sense of the overall sound 
signature. The drums on this track can sound overly 
thunderous on bass-forward in-ears that push the lows 
too much, but here we get a round, full, rich bass 
response that isn‚Äôt over the top. The high frequency 
response is also clear, crisp, and detailed‚ÄîCallahan‚Äôs 
vocals and the attack of the guitar strums stand out and 
balance things so that the lows don‚Äôt overpower the mix. 
This is undeniably a scooped, sculpted sound, with 
strong lows and highs, and less low-midrange presence. 
But for $30, it‚Äôs impressive.
RHA has 
made the 
MA390 
Universal 
look and feel 
like a product 
that costs at

On Jay-Z and Kanye West‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Church in the Wild,‚Äù the kick drum loop gets 
an ideal amount of high-mid presence, allowing its attack to retain its sharp 
edge and slice through the layers of the mix. The sub-bass synth hits that 
punctuate the beat are delivered with gusto. We also hear plenty of the vinyl 
crackle that is usually relegated to background status‚Äîthis tells us the high-
mids and highs are sculpted and boosted quite a bit, yet the vocals somehow 
avoid sounding overly sibilant despite some added brightness.
Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene in John Adams‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Gospel According 
to the Other Mary,‚Äù sound excellent through the MA390 Universal. The lower 
register instrumentation has a full-bodied, rich presence in the mix without 
sounding overly boosted or unnatural, and the higher register brass, strings, 
and vocals retain their prominent place in the mix, with excellent high 
frequency detail and clarity.
CONCLUSIONS
We‚Äôve tested other standout pairs in this price range over the years, including 
the JLab Fit 2.0 and the Coloud No. 4. But the RHA MA390 Universal 
earphones sound good for $30‚Äîand they easily outmatch pairs we‚Äôve tested 
that cost twice as much. Audiophiles have very few choices in the budget-

listening audio performance here, but there‚Äôs lovely bass depth and detailed 
highs.
If you can spend a little more money, the Klipsch Reference X6i and the 1More 
Triple-Driver In-Ear Headphones offer excellent audio performance that‚Äôs an 
upgrade over the MA390. But if you‚Äôre wondering which pair of $30 wired 
in-ears you should get, and your top priority is audio performance, your search 
should begin and end with the handsomely designed RHA MA390 Universal.

Most wired gaming headsets hover in the $50 to $150 range, and 
we‚Äôve seen very few a wireless models break the $200 mark. The 
Beyerdynamic MMX 300 is $349, which makes it more than double 
the price of the excellent Turtle Beach Elite Pro Tournament Headset 
and even pricier than the wireless Astro Gaming A50. That‚Äôs because 
Beyerdynamic is a high-end headphone company, not a gaming accessory 
manufacturer, and its pedigree among audiophiles is strong. 
The MMX 300 is simply the best-sounding gaming headset we‚Äôve tested to date, 
offering an impeccable listening experience with fantastic stereo imaging and a

need to be aware of the issue.
ACCESSORIES AND COMPONENTS
The MMX 300 comes with a shorter cable for 
connecting the headset to a mobile device or game 
console (through the headset port on the controller) and 
a longer cable for connecting to a PC or any other 
device. The shorter cable is 3.9 feet long and terminates 
in a four-pole 3.5mm plug. An inline remote sits about a 
foot down from the earcup and features a volume wheel 
and microphone mute switch. The longer cable is 8.2 
feet long and terminates in two three-pole 3.5mm plugs. 
It has its own in-line remote, which provides the same 
function as the shorter cable‚Äôs remote but works with 
the separate headphone and microphone connections.

on the longer PC cable. Both cables are thick and sturdy.
Besides the two cables, Beyerdynamic includes a hard-
shell zip-up case and a 0.25-inch headphone adapter.

The headset combines hardware and design elements from Beyerdynamic‚Äôs 
excellent DT 770 Studio headphones for sound quality, studio microphones for 
the boom mic, and Aviation headsets for noise isolation. The DT 770 Studio is 
much less expensive than the MMX 300 at $180, but the company‚Äôs gooseneck 
capsule microphones (like the Classis GM 105) easily retail for at least $170, and 
Aviation headsets (like the HS 800) often cost upward of $800. It‚Äôs clear that 
the frame, padding, and microphone account for a big part of the MX 300‚Äôs 
price tag.
MUSIC PERFORMANCE
The MMX 300 is very capable at handling music, as you might expect from any 
headset based on the fantastic DT 770 Studio. It plays The Knife‚Äôs ‚ÄúSilent 
Shout,‚Äù our bass test track, at maximum volume without a hint of distortion.
The synth drumbeat in Erasure‚Äôs ‚ÄúChains of Love‚Äù sounds powerful and thumpy 
without overshadowing the lilting vocals or keyboard licks. It‚Äôs a full, clean 
sound that lets the dense mix come through without missing any details, a 
distinct rarity in often bass-heavy gaming headsets.
White Zombie‚Äôs ‚ÄúMore Human Than Human‚Äù also demonstrates impressive 
amounts of power and clarity, with snares popping out with distinct sharpness 
even over the thunderous bass drums. While Rob Zombie is no Andy Bell, his 
vocals are also prominent and easy to pick up over the grungy metal sound. On 
all of these tracks, the MX 300 offers a sense of space and depth that other 
gaming headsets, even the excellent Turtle Beach Elite Pro Tournament 
Headset, can‚Äôt touch.

GAME AND VOICE PERFORMANCE
Star Wars: Battlefront II sounds excellent on the MMX 300. The soundtrack is 
full and sweeping, and dialogue is clear regardless of how frantic the action is. 
The different blaster weapons sound distinct, and environmental sounds like 
forest creatures and crashing spaceships are clean and detailed. While the 
headset doesn‚Äôt have any simulated surround tricks, its stereo imaging provides 
a fantastic sense of horizontal direction.
Forza Motorsport 7 sounds just as impressive. The high-pitched rev of compact 
car engines comes through clearly against the sound of screeching tires and rain 
on windshields. The rumble of cars driving over rough terrain sounds deep and 
imposing, reaching well into the low frequencies to give a good sense of power 
and friction.
The boom microphone is similarly excellent. Test voice clips came through clear 
and clean, without any sibilance or fuzziness. It‚Äôs a high-end mic on a high-end 
headset, and will serve you well for both team voice chat and podcasts.
CONCLUSIONS
The Beyerdynamic MMX 300 is one of the most impressive-sounding gaming 
headsets we‚Äôve ever tested, beating out the Turtle Beach Elite Pro Tournament 
Headset in build and audio quality. It also eclipses Turtle Beach in terms of 
price, at a hefty $350. The headset‚Äôs aviation and studio pedigree help to justify 
it, but ultimately this is a luxury headset for users who are both hardcore 
gamers and dedicated audiophiles. It‚Äôs a fantastic choice if you don‚Äôt mind 
shelling out for it, and our Editors‚Äô Choice. If you want a good gaming audio 
experience but don‚Äôt want to pay quite as much for it, the Astro Gaming A10 is 
an excellent wired headset available for a fraction of the price of the MMX 300.

GOOD-LOOKING IN A TOYISH WAY
The Spin 11 is made of white polycarbonate plastic with 
a rubberized beige bumper around its bottom half, 
giving it a rugged look clearly meant for kids‚Äô clumsy 
hands. Black keys match the large black bezel around 
the glossy screen. The touch panel that covers the 
display is antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass, designed 
to resist not only knocks and scratches but also passing

PROS Rugged enough 
for school use. Wacom 
stylus included. Two 
USB-C and two USB 
3.0 ports. Two 
cameras. Snappy 
keyboard. 
CONS Small, low-res 
screen. Easy-to-lose 
stylus. Imperfect 
Android compatibility. 

The Acer is more expensive than the Dell Chromebook 
3189 and the Lenovo Flex 11, partly because of its 
ruggedized construction and partly because it comes 
with a Wacom stylus for scribbling or sketching on the 
screen in Tablet mode. The bad news is that it has no 
hole or niche for storing the stylus, so kids are 
guaranteed to lose it. The good news is that the 
batteryless pen works with good precision and palm 
rejection. You‚Äôll see a little lag when you whip the stylus 
across the screen at top speed, but in normal use, we 
found it a capable input tool for apps such as Google 
Keep and Autodesk SketchBook. It even responded with 
thin and thick lines to gentler and harder pressure in 
the latter.
Like the Dell and Lenovo chromebooks, the Spin 11 has 
an 11.6-inch IPS touch screen with 1,366-by-768 
resolution (compared with the Asus Flip‚Äôs 12.5-inch and 
1,920-by-1,080). Like many touch screens, the panel is 
SODJXHGE\UH√ÄHFWLRQVVRWKHEH]HODQGGDUNDUHDVDUH
like looking at a mirror. But the 360-degree hinges let 
you tilt the display back as far as it takes to minimize 
the effect. Otherwise, the screen is attractive, with

ersonal DNA testing is more popular than ever before, now that you can 
do it easily in the comfort of your home at an affordable cost. Even 
better, you‚Äôre more likely to get results: In August 2017, AncestryDNA 
(the genetics-focused arm of Ancestry) surpassed 5 million people in its DNA 
database, and in April, 23andMe topped 2 million. These large databases mean

AncestryDNA and 23andMe, we also explored HomeDNA, MyHeritage DNA, 
and National Geographic Genographic Project.

Five Top DNA Testing Kits

HOW DNA KITS WORK
Each of the kits work similarly: You answer a few questions about yourself, 
order the kit, collect your sample, register the kit (this is very important), send 
it back, and wait for the results. That said, they differ in the collection process 
and, to a smaller extent, the cost of shipping. 
When we tested 23andMe back in mid-2015, the company was unable to accept 
DNA samples collected in or sent from New York State, because of local laws 
(we had to cross the border to New Jersey). The company was also prohibited 
from shipping DNA kits to Maryland. The shipping issues resulted partly 
EHFDXVHZKHQWKHFRPSDQ\¬øUVWODXQFKHGLWWHVWHGIRUDOLWDQ\RIKHDOWKLVVXHV
and genetic markers for disease, raising concerns from the FDA and other 
agencies. 23andM3 stepped back and has been working more closely with 
governmental agencies as it rolls out more features.
Those restrictive laws are no longer on the books, but as DNA testing companies 
add more features, including tests related to medical conditions, more laws 
could surface. Be sure to check a site‚Äôs terms of service to see whether there are 
any restrictions in your locality before signing up.
SWAB, SCRAPE, SPIT, AND SEND
HomeDNA has the simplest DNA extraction process; just swipe each cheek 
twice with a cotton swab, and place the swabs in the included envelope. The 
National Geographic Genographic Project sent a scraper that you use on each 
cheek for 45 seconds and then place in a vial with stabilizing liquid; MyHeritage 
DNA has a similar process. 23andMe and AncestryDNA require that you spit 
LQWRDWXEHXSWRWKH¬øOOOLQHKDUGHUWKDQLWVRXQGVDQGVKLSLWEDFNZLWK
stabilization liquid. Most of the services said not to eat, drink, or smoke for 30 
minutes to an hour prior to testing to get the best possible sample.

The most important part of the DNA-testing process is 
UHJLVWHULQJ\RXUNLWEHIRUHVKLSSLQJLW$OO¬øYHVHUYLFHV
require this, and if you don‚Äôt do it, you won‚Äôt be able to 
access your results. This requirement is to protect your 
privacy‚Äîyour name won‚Äôt appear on the kit or the 
results‚Äîand to easily track your kit as it goes through 
the process. Of course, when you sign up for an account 
with these services, your identity is associated with it, 
but the sample and any reports stored on the service‚Äôs 
end have just a unique barcode.
Some services include shipping costs in the cost of the 
kit; AncestryDNA‚Äôs $99 fee includes two-way shipping. 
National Geographic‚Äôs Genographic Project ships the 
kits for free, but you have to purchase postage when you 
send your kit to their lab. 23andMe tacks on a two-way 
VKLSSLQJIHHRIIRUWKH¬øUVWNLWDQGIRUHDFK
additional one. HomeDNA includes a prepaid envelope 
to return your sample and offers three shipping options: 
$7 for two-day shipping, $14 for overnight, and free 
shipping that takes 7 to 12 business days. Finally, 
MyHeritage charges $12 for shipping; if you order two 
kits, you pay $6, and if you order three or more, you get 
free shipping.
Once you‚Äôve shipped your sample, it‚Äôs waiting time. All

take anywhere from three to eight weeks to process.
DNA RESULTS AND FAMILY TREE FEATURES
Next, you‚Äôll receive an email alert that your results are 
ready, and that‚Äôs when the fun begins. Your results may 
not be as dramatic as those portrayed in TV ads, but you 
PD\¬øQGVRPHVXUSULVHV
HomeDNA has 
the simplest 
DNA 
extraction 
process; just 
swipe each 
cheek twice 
with a cotton 
swab.

One important note: Results are different for women and men. Women, who 
have the XX chromosome, can trace back only their maternal line. Men, having 
the XY chromosome, can track both their maternal and paternal lines, painting 
a complete picture. Women with brothers could ask them to take a test and 
share the results. 
AncestryDNA, 23andMe, HomeDNA, and MyHeritage DNA all provide reports 
of your ethnicity, some showing maps of where your ancestors lived along with 
information about the particular countries and regions. National Geographic 
goes further back, pinpointing where in Africa your ancestors came from and 
tracing migration patterns through to near-present times. Its results are less 
about your personal genetic makeup and more about who your ancestors were 
and how you‚Äôre connected to the beginning of civilization.
On all platforms except National Geographic, you can initiate a search for 
relatives, though some services let you upload your National Geographic results 
for further analysis. The software continues to searches for DNA matches as 
more people share their results. This feature may be useful for those who are 
building a family tree or looking for relatives they‚Äôve never met; if not, it may 
more of a nuisance. You can opt in or out at any time, and the DNA service 
doesn‚Äôt share your contact information. Relatives can message you through the 
software, though. If you already use genealogy software, you may be able to 
download your results and upload them into your preferred program. 
Otherwise, AncestryDNA and others featured here have family tree software 
that you can easily link.

As mentioned, 23andMe started out by testing for 
genetic markers of diseases and medical conditions 
before rolling that back in response to the governmental 
concerns. It has since started slowly adding more 
health-related features with approval from the FDA. In 
April, 23andMe got approval to offer risk analysis for 
ten genetically linked diseases. The company now offers 
two options: Health + Ancestry ($199) and Ancestry 
($99). The Health + Ancestry plan includes testing for 
genetic health risks and carrier status, as well as reports 
on your genetic weight, hair loss, and other traits.
If you‚Äôre the family-tree manager for the family and 
want to track DNA results for other family members, 
you can do so. In some cases, you may have to create a 
separate account for each kit that you‚Äôre managing. You 
can also share your results as well with other members 
and connect family trees.
Again, be sure to read through the terms of service and 
any other agreements before proceeding. Don‚Äôt agree to 
anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.
HOW WE TEST DNA SERVICES
We evaluated each kit by ordering one, just like any 
customer would, and tracking how long it took to arrive 
at the lab and to get processed. Then we compared the 
breadth and depth of the results to see what rose to the 
top. The whole process was a lot of fun, in part because 
of the anticipation of getting the results. 
Most of the kits warn that testing your DNA can lead to 
surprising‚Äîeven life-changing‚Äîresults. Of course, 
there‚Äôs also a good chance that you won‚Äôt be surprised 
at all, but there‚Äôs satisfaction in knowing for certain 
where your ancestors lived and how you came to be who 
you are.

WHAT YOU‚ÄôLL PAY
In my writing and editing work, I‚Äôve relied on ABBYY 
FineReader for as long as I can remember;  one reason I 
work mostly in Windows and not on a Mac is that 
ABBYY FineReader Pro for Mac is a lot less powerful 
than FineReader 14 for Windows. For this review, I 
tested the FineReader 14 Corporate edition. The 
Standard version has all the OCR and PDF-editing 
features of Corporate but lacks the document-compare 
component and doesn‚Äôt include the Hot Folder feature 
WKDWDXWRPDWLFDOO\FUHDWHV3')¬øOHVIURPGRFXPHQWVRU
images saved to the folder.
For most users, the Standard version will be more than 
enough, but the document-comparison feature alone 
may be worth the extra price for the Corporate app. The 
prices, by the way, are perpetual, with no annoying 
subscription model like Adobe‚Äôs.
You‚Äôll typically use an OCR app to convert scanned 
images of printed text into either an editable Word

even need a scanner to create images that you can turn 
into editable documents or PDFs. However, your 
OCR software has to be able to work with skewed 
and otherwise irregular photos in addition to 
high-quality scans. 
FineReader has always excelled at cleaning up 
imperfect images, but Version 14 seems even more 
impressive than earlier versions. When I used my 
phone to take photos of two-page spreads in a book, 
FineReader effortlessly split the photos into single-page 
images, unskewed the images so that the text lines were 
horizontal, and recognized the text with often perfect 
accuracy.

EDITING MUSCLE
For basic PDF editing, FineReader has a clearer and more modern interface 
than Adobe Acrobat and makes it easier to perform tasks such as using a 
GHYHORSHUFHUWL¬øFDWHWRVLJQDGRFXPHQW)LQH5HDGHU¬∂VVHDUFKIHDWXUHKDV
conveniences that Adobe doesn‚Äôt match, such as the ability to highlight or 
underline all instances of a search string. You can also switch on a convenient 
redaction mode that lets you blank out any text or region in a document simply 
by selecting a region with a mouse, clicking, and moving on to the next.

On the other hand, FineReader doesn‚Äôt have Acrobat‚Äôs full-text indexing feature, 
which can make searching almost instantaneous in large documents. 
FineReader‚Äôs interface uses the familiar sidebar of thumbnails or bookmarks at 
the left of a full-size image, but the layout is exceptionally clear, and all icons are 
labeled. A new background-OCR feature means that you can start editing a PDF 
before the app has completed its text-recognition operations.

for checking OCR output and correcting recognition errors. Scanned images of 
old books, crumpled paper, or marked-up pages are almost certain to produce 
either outright errors or readings where the OCR software can‚Äôt be certain of the 
original text and makes a best guess of what was on the page. FineReader‚Äôs OCR 
editor works like a high-powered spelling checker in a word processor, quickly

with one keystroke or correct it with two or three keystrokes, typically selecting 
the right reading from a list that the program offers. This kind of repetitive work 
normally strains your hand muscles as you maneuver the mouse, but 
FineReader‚Äôs thoughtful design reduces strain to an absolute minimum. One

Everything in FineReader seems designed to reduce needless operations. When 
you install it, FineReader adds a Screenshot Reader app to your taskbar icons. 
This works like a superpowered version of Windows‚Äô built-in Snipping Tool. I 
use it to capture the text when an on-screen image shows a picture of some text 
but doesn‚Äôt let me select the text itself‚Äîfor example, an image of a page in 
Google Books or Amazon‚Äôs Look Inside feature. 
I start up the Screenshot Reader app, drag the mouse to frame the text I want to 
capture, and then wait a second or two while FineReader performs OCR on the 
image and sends the text to the Clipboard. Options in the app let me select a 
table or simply capture an image to the Clipboard. They also let me send the 
output directly to Microsoft Word or some other app instead of to the 
Clipboard. There‚Äôs nothing else out there that‚Äôs remotely as powerful and

competition. Adobe Acrobat DC is a PDF-editing powerhouse with strong OCR 
features built in, but it isn‚Äôt as accurate as FineReader and doesn‚Äôt offer 
anything like FineReader‚Äôs interactive OCR editor. OmniPage and the 
enterprise-level OmniPage Professional offer high-powered, automated OCR 
functions that work well for high-volume operations, but (at least in my limited 
testing) OmniPage doesn‚Äôt match FineReader in accuracy or in its OCR-editing 
interface. The lower-tech ReadIris Pro, bundled with many scanners, doesn‚Äôt 
match any of these three in convenience or accuracy. 
Acrobat, OmniPage, and FineReader leave all other OCR software in the dust. 
But FineReader, our Editors‚Äô Choice, offers the ultimate in accuracy, 
convenience, and control.

ondering what‚Äôs in store for tech in the year to come? We took the 
crystal-ball question outside of PCMag labs to tech experts in 
business and research and asked them to opine on the coming 
evolution of augmented and mixed reality, blockchain, security, and 
automation and IoT. Our major takeaways: Life will move even faster and 
become even more interesting in 2018.
AUGMENTED REALITY AND MIXED REALITY
Augmented reality is changing the way we work and play. This year, we‚Äôve seen 
an explosion in new AR headsets‚Äîeven Google Glass made a comeback in the 
business world‚Äîwhile Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Mixed Reality ecosystem churned 
out partner headsets that blend AR and virtual reality (VR) in immersive 
experiences. At the same time, smartphone-based AR has evolved, thanks to 
Apple and Google going all in on the technology. 
THE SMARTPHONE AR ERA IS HERE
Thanks to the iPhone X and the emergence of more accessible AR development 
tools such as Apple‚Äôs ARKit and Google‚Äôs ARCore, smartphone-based AR 
experiences are poised to evolve beyond fads like Pokemon Go and become 
everyday reality for mobile users.

‚ÄúOver a billion smartphone users will likely create AR 
content at least once in 2018, with at least 300 million 
doing so monthly, and tens of millions weekly.‚Äù
‚ÄîDeloitte‚Äôs 2018 Technology, Media, and 
Telecommunications Predictions Report
AR WILL REPLACE MANUALS, TIE INTO IOT
‚ÄúThe value of AR will grow exponentially as the IoT 
[Internet of Things] proliferates. As IoT data continues 
to grow... so too does the power of AR, as it allows us to 
leverage and interpret that information. AR serves as 
the bridge between the physical and digital worlds, 
opening up our ability to take advantage of the torrent 
of information and insights produced by billions of 
smart, connected products worldwide‚Ä¶ AR will [also] 
continue to supplement or replace traditional manuals, 
brochures, and training documents at an ever-faster 
pace. By implementing AR technology, companies will 
see a dramatic positive impact on the productivity and 
quality of procedures, especially in manufacturing.‚Äù
‚ÄîPTC CEO Jim Heppelmann
With AR 
technology, 
companies will 
see a dramatic 
positive 
impact on the 
productivity 
and quality of 
procedures.

A NEW AGE OF PRODUCT DESIGN
‚ÄúAs teams become more globally distributed, it can 
VRPHWLPHVEHGLI¬øFXOWWRJHWHYHU\RQHLQYROYHGWR
review a product design in a timely manner, collect all 
the information needed for the review, and capture 
feedback for future action. Using augmented reality, 
team members are able to visualize, interact with, and 
provide feedback on product designs from anywhere in 
the world. AR makes it possible for stakeholders to 
interact with a 3D model of the product, such as 
walking around it and viewing different states of the 
model‚Äîincluding going inside the model itself. AR also 
enables users to get a third-party perspective from other 
teammates.‚Äù‚ÄîKevin Wrenn, Divisional General 
Manager, PLM at PTC
AR DEVELOPERS WILL BE IN DEMAND
‚ÄúIn 2018 we‚Äôll see increasing demand for developers 
that know how to build augmented reality and natural 
language processing (NLP) based experiences. A short

AR WILL CHANGE THE WAY WE 
COMMUNICATE
‚ÄúMuch in the same way as the Internet evolved from a 
forum to share technical report to the robust network it 
is today, AR presents a new way of engaging with people 
that will change how we communicate. Because it allows 
for a remote presence, AR will change customer service 
and the way that companies interact with and serve 
customers. AR will also change the way we train 
employees.‚Äù‚ÄîPTC CEO Jim Heppelmann

BLOCKCHAIN
The meteoric rise in Bitcoin‚Äôs value has thrust the underlying technology 
beneath cryptocurrencies into the spotlight, but blockchain‚Äôs potential extends 
far beyond bitcoin. Blockchain‚Äôs distributed-network and immutable-ledger 
technology has the potential to fundamentally reengineer how we interact 
online, impacting everything from digital identity and healthcare data to 
insurance, mortgages and land titling, and the supply chain. As giants in the 
¬øQDQFLDODQGWHFKVHFWRUEHJLQLQWURGXFLQJQHZSODWIRUPVDQGWRROVLQWKH
maturing space, we‚Äôre already seeing blockchain‚Äôs potential to impact areas like 
cybersecurity and even global foodborne outbreaks.

Platform and Middleware at Oracle

GOVERNMENTS JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON
‚ÄúIBM believes that 2018 will be the year blockchain 
becomes an accepted and appreciated innovation for 
government, a year when the global public sector begins 
to look closely at this technology, and citizens begin to 
see its effects on the issues that impact them. 
Governments are already testing blockchain as a way to 
replace current voting systems. More ambitiously, it 
could formalize identity for every human on the planet, 
regardless of their residency status or whether or not

GROWING CRYPTO RESILIENCE
‚ÄúThere will be hacks, but overall, blockchain and crypto 
robustness will grow. These are ‚Äòresilience technologies‚Äô 
that have an anti-fragility model. The more 
cryptocurrencies get attached, the stronger they become. 
China bans ICOs [initial coin offerings] and hints at 
hurting Bitcoin exchanges, and the value of Bitcoin goes 
up. The Ethereum DAO gets attacked, and Ethereum 
takes hundreds of steps to make itself more robust and

A YEAR OF RECKONING
Forrester predicts we‚Äôll see a serious pruning of 
blockchain projects in 2018. The companies and 
projects that ‚Äúfailed to translate the headlines into 
reality will write off their investments and give up,‚Äù but 
the ones that survive the purge and move forward will 
fall into three categories: pure R&D, applications that

‚ÄúThe visionaries will forge ahead, those hoping for 
immediate industry and process transformation will 
give up. This is the answer I usually give when asked for 
a one-sentence summary of how I see 2018 shaping up 
in the blockchain technology arena.‚Äù‚ÄîMartha Bennett, 
Principal Analyst at Forrester Research
SECURITY
2017 was a rough year for online security. From the 
Equifax breach to full-on election hacking by a foreign 
government, major hacks and breaches touched nearly 
every industry, institution, and consumer in this 
country. We spoke to security experts from around the 
industry and rounded up 10 of the most prevalent 
security threats and trends you should watch out for 
in 2018.
Central banks 
will embrace 
digital assets 
as a means of 
exchanging 
value on the 
blockchain 
securely and in 
real-time.

THE RISE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY HACKS
‚ÄúAs cryptocurrencies grow in importance, including as a 
method of extracting revenue from cybercrime, Forcepoint 
predicts that the systems surrounding such currencies will 
increasingly come under attack. We expect to see an 
increasing amount of malware targeting user credentials of 
cryptocurrency exchanges and that cyber criminals will turn 
their attention to vulnerabilities in systems relying on 
blockchain-based technologies.‚Äù‚ÄîForcepoint Principal 
Security Expert Carl Leonard
EMAIL WILL STILL BE A PRIME TARGET
‚ÄúAccording to a recent PSA from the FBI, business email 
compromise and email compromise is a $5B industry, yet 80 
percent of business IP [intellectual property] is sent via 
email. Email will continue to be an attractive and lucrative 
target for cyber criminals while organizations rely on it to 
communicate sensitive and high-value information and 
maintain poor digital-hygiene practices, holding 
communications and records with private information much 
longer than they are useful. Email is also hard to secure for 
many reasons, one critical one being the vast opportunity for 
human error as phishing schemes and social engineering 
attacks get more sophisticated.‚Äù‚ÄîJoel Wallenstrom, 
CEO of Wickr
DATA AGGREGATORS WILL BE TARGETED
‚ÄúA data aggregator will be breached in 2018 using a known 
attack method. The Equifax breach rocked the security 
industry, and the full impact of this breach has not yet played

SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE WILL DRIVE CLOUD ADOPTION
‚ÄúOrganizations that have taken a ‚Äòwait and see‚Äô approach to cloud will speed up 
their adoption rates as they look for help defending against increasingly 
sophisticated cyberattacks, such as highly-targeted ransomware and phishing 
campaigns. In addition, as the GDPR goes into effect in May 2018, 
organizations will recognize that their ability to discover and manage sensitive 
personal information is made much more possible using cloud services, which 
will drive a major wave of migrations and investment.‚Äù‚ÄîRob Sadowski, Trust 
and Security Marketing Lead, Google Cloud
HIGH-END MOBILE MALWARE IS ON THE RISE
‚ÄúOur assessment is that the total [amount] of mobile malware existing in the 
wild is likely higher than currently reported, due to shortcomings in telemetry 
WKDWPDNHVWKHVHPRUHGLI¬øFXOWWRVSRWDQGHUDGLFDWH:HHVWLPDWHWKDWLQ
more high-end APT malware for mobile will be discovered, as a result of both 
an increase in attacks and improvement in security technologies designed to 
catch them.‚Äù‚ÄîKaspersky Lab 2018 Threat Predictions
DISRUPTION OF THINGS WILL EMERGE
‚ÄúThe wide scale adoption of IoT devices in consumer and business 
environments, coupled with these devices often being both easy to access and 
unmonitored, has made them an attractive target for cybercriminals wishing to 
hold them ransom or obtain a long-term, persistent presence on the network. 
While ransomware of these connected things is possible, it remains unlikely in 
2018. However, a new threat that will emerge is the disruption of things. As the 
IoT offers access to both disruptive possibilities and massive amounts of critical 
data, we will see attacks in this area, and may also see the integration of a man-
in-the-middle (MITM) attack.‚Äù‚ÄîForcepoint Principal Security Expert 
Carl Leonard

RANSOMWARE WILL FUEL DIGITAL EXTORTION

HOHPHQW¬≤ZLOOSURPSWF\EHUFULPLQDOVORRNLQJWRPDNHJHQHURXVSUR¬øWVRXWRI
targeting populations that will yield the most return possible. Attackers will 
continue to rely on phishing campaigns where emails with ransomware payload 
are delivered en masse to ensure a percentage of affected users. They will also 
go for the bigger buck by targeting a single organization, possibly in an 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, for a ransomware attack that 
will disrupt the operations and affect the production line. We already saw this 
in the fallout from the massive WannaCry and Petya outbreaks, and it won‚Äôt be 
long until it becomes the intended impact of the threat.‚Äù‚ÄîTrend Micro 
Paradigm Shifts Report
SECURITY WILL BE BUILT INTO THE CODE
‚ÄúMany of the world‚Äôs critical systems still aren‚Äôt hardened enough‚Äîand their 
surface area is only getting bigger. The steady stream of malware attacks we saw

production. We‚Äôll also see the rise of more intelligent systems, eventually 
culminating in a series of automatically secured layers.‚Äù‚ÄîJason Warner, SVP of 
Technology at GitHub

WATCH OUT FOR CONNECTED CARS
‚ÄúConnected vehicles will generate and process ever 
more data about the vehicle, but also about journeys 
and even personal data on the occupants. This will be of 
growing appeal to attackers looking to sell the data on 
the black market or to use it for extortion and 
blackmail. Car manufacturers are already under 
pressure from marketing companies eager to get 
legitimate access to passenger and journey data for real 
time location-based advertising.‚ÄîKaspersky Lab 
Automotive Threat Predictions for 2018
BREACHES WILL ENTER OUR PHYSICAL LIVES
‚ÄúThere is a difference between information and physical 
security. The breaches that plague organizations today 
are primarily information security violations. While 
painful, having credit card information, a social security 
number, or personal digital information stolen does not 
result in physical harm to the victim. In 2018, we will 
see a breach impact our physical, personal lives. It 
might be a medical device or wearable that is hacked 
and remotely controlled. Perhaps it will be an industrial 
IoT device or self-driving car that gets compromised. Or 
something closer to home, literally. Devices from the 
garage door to the refrigerator are becoming smarter 
and more connected. The impact of such an attack will 
force government, business, and individuals to take a 
closer look at the security of our infrastructure.‚Äù
‚ÄîBrendan O‚ÄôConnor, CTO of ServiceNow
Connected 
vehicles will 
generate ever 
more data about 
the vehicle, but 
also about 
journeys and 
even personal 
data.

AUTOMATION AND IOT
Over the past year, everything became more automated, connected, and 
intelligent. The Internet of Things has swelled to millions upon millions of 
connected devices in all our consumer and enterprise experiences. We asked 
experts from Forrester, Google, PTC, Salesforce, and more to predict how 
connected devices and autonomous systems will evolve in 2018, as companies 
automate our world, one process at a time.
ROBOTS WILL RESHAPE THE WORKFORCE
‚ÄúAs enterprises become more acclimated with automation, RPA [robotic process 
automation] will take over low-value repetitive tasks and rote work. In 2018,

enhanced customer experiences, according to Forrester. Digital transformation 
spending will increasingly emphasize automation, and operating models will be 
reengineered around it.‚ÄîChris Gardner, Senior Analyst at Forrester Research
POLITICAL BACKLASH TO AUTOMATION
‚ÄúAs people become more and more engaged with customer service automation 
such as kiosks and robots, there will be hesitation and, in some cases, 
resentment over change. However, enterprises and political organizations will 
reexamine change management procedures and reorient PR to navigate these 
waters. Automation will eventually win out, because its societal and economic

AN EVOLUTION OF SCALE
‚ÄúContrary to popular belief, automation will not mean that we need fewer 
humans; we‚Äôll just need humans to do different things. In the DevOps industry, 
our challenge is to build more scalable tools for those people to cope with even 
bigger levels of complexity and scale. Ten years ago, a typical server-to-
sysadmin ratio was measured in the dozens or maybe the low hundreds for a 
really top notch IT shop. Today, a lot of enterprises that have invested deeply in 
automation are getting to the point where they can run thousands of servers per 
human. In 2018, we‚Äôll see more companies go through an evolution of scale and 
begin to adopt automation tools that can empower them to do that.‚Äù

LOW-CODE ORCHESTRATION
‚ÄúIn 2018, the enterprise will prioritize developing 
business apps that take advantage of IoT data in real-
time. You‚Äôll see companies empowering any employee, 
regardless of developer skill level, to harness IoT data 
and drive customer experiences that open new revenue 
streams‚Äîfor example, admins at a manufacturing

the catalyst for this movement, bringing to IoT the same 
DIY ethos that transformed enterprise app 
development: enabling business users and citizen 
developers to build proactive sales, service, and 
marketing processes, powered by IoT data, with point-
and-click ease.‚Äù‚ÄîBo Mangels, Senior Marketing 
Manager, Salesforce IoT
RETURN ON IOT INVESTMENTS
‚ÄúThere are a lot of smart things; even a light bulb has an 
IP address behind it these days. Companies continued 
to invest in IoT initiatives in 2017, but 2018 will be the 
year where IoT monetization becomes critical. While it 
is a good start for enterprises to collect and store IoT 
data, what is more meaningful is understanding it, 
analyzing it, and leveraging the insights to improve

S
ocial media is the new college brochure. Like 
any business, schools that market themselves 
effectively on social media and listen to their 
social audiences have an easier time attracting top 
recruits than schools that ignore Facebook, Instagram, 
SnapChat, and Twitter (sorry, LinkedIn, these kids 
don‚Äôt need jobs yet).
For this story, I looked for schools that were creating 
beautiful photo and video content, using social media in 
new and interesting ways, and posting a diverse array of 
content, including links, memes, and GIFs. I asked 
social media experts to nominate colleges and 
universities, relied on published social media case 
studies, and did some old-fashioned digging. This list is 
subjective, incomplete, and totally updateable. 
MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY operates more

Instagram accounts. The Milwaukee-based 
school works with Sprout Social to analyze 
and study data to determine exactly what 
students and potential applicants like, 
dislike, and ignore on social media. 
The result, based on what they post, is a 
snapshot of student life. You‚Äôll see photos of 
the school‚Äôs mascot (the Golden Eagle) and 
images from basketball games, but the 
majority of posts focus on students out in the

generated and is (based on what I‚Äôve seen) the 
EHVWQRIULOOVUHFRUGRIZKDW\RX¬∂OO¬øQGZDONLQJ
around a major American college campus.

Perhaps no other major university account toes the line between football 
insanity and higher education better than the UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA 
(UGA). Nestled between adorable photos of Uga, the school‚Äôs rotund, slobbery 
mascot, and 6-second Georgia Bulldogs football highlight videos are links to 
stellar research on a wide variety of topics, including plastic waste, STEM-based 
instruction, and cell therapies for chronic diseases. If you‚Äôre not into football or 
bulldogs (God forbid), then stay away from the school‚Äôs accounts on Saturdays, 
when it‚Äôs all Dawgs, all day. 
Want to make yourself smarter? Follow 
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY on Facebook and Twitter. In 
addition to posting link after link of stunning 
new research (‚ÄúGravitational waves from a binary 
black hole merger,‚Äù as one example), MIT‚Äôs social 
IHHGVNQRZKRZWRKDYHIXQ<RX¬∂OO¬øQG
informative (and comprehensible) GIFs, LEGO 
caricatures of recent Nobel Prize winners, and 
copious amounts of robots. As you‚Äôd expect, MIT‚Äôs 
feeds don‚Äôt rely as heavily on sports-related 
content as other college-related social feeds. But it 
still posts a nice blend of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs 
athletics coverage, including co-ed club sports such 
as Shotokan Karate. If you follow PCMag (and our 
sister sites Geek.com and ExtremeTech), then you‚Äôll 
love following MIT.
Call me biased, but this New York City boy is partial 
to NEW YORK UNIVERSITY‚ÄôS INSTAGRAM 
account. Perhaps the biggest draw for applicants is 
the Big Apple itself; NYU‚Äôs Instagram page doubles

cityscapes. Seriously, if you‚Äôre missing New York City right now, pop over to the 
school‚Äôs Instagram page, click on a few photos, close your eyes, and I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôll 
be able to smell a Coney Island red hot. NYU‚Äôs Facebook and SnapChat pages 
are more traditional, relying heavily on student-lifestyle content, fundraising 
efforts, and school-related news.

How to Create and Send 
Animoji on iPhone X  BY LANCE WHITNEY  
A
mong the many cool new features offered by the newest iPhone is an 
addictive twist on emoji, dubbed Animoji. Apple iPhone X owners can 
insert any number of animated characters in a text message, thanks to 
the way the X maps your face. You can say anything you want to convey in the 
text, and the character speaks in your voice. The phone records your facial 
expressions at the same time, so the character takes on your mannerisms.
Though you can send an Animoji only from the iPhone X, anyone can receive 
them on an iOS device, a different type of smartphone, or a Mac. Here‚Äôs how to 
create and send an Animoji.
ANIMOJI
TIPS & HOW TOS

On your iPhone X, launch the Messages app. Start a 
new message to someone or respond to an existing text 
DQGWDSLQWKHL0HVVDJH¬øHOG7DSRQWKH$SS6WRUHLFRQ
(the one with the A) and then tap on the Monkey icon. 
Select ‚ÄúTap on to Start.‚Äù
View the collection of Animoji by swiping down on the 
OHIWVLGH6WRSZKHQ\RX¬øQGDQ$QLPRML\RXZDQWWR
send. Look at your iPhone until the message that says 
‚ÄúBring your face into view‚Äù goes away. You can now play 
around with your face, so to speak. Make different 
expressions and movements with your eyes, eyebrows, 
mouth, and overall face to see how the Animoji mimics 
you. Tap on the Up arrow to see your Animoji and the 
other Animoji full screen. Tap on the Down arrow to 
exit full-screen mode.
To record your speech and your facial expressions 
through the Animoji, tap on the red Record button. 
Speak your text. You can talk for up to 10 seconds 
before you‚Äôre cut off, so watch the seconds count down 
on the timer. To stop recording, tap the red Stop button. 
Your recording via the Animoji plays back so you can 
preview it before you send it. Preview it again by 
tapping on the Repeat button or delete it by tapping on 
the Trash Can icon. You can also tap on a different 
Animoji to see it speak the same recording. If you‚Äôre 
happy with the recording and the Animoji, tap on the 
Blue arrow to send it.
Apple iPhone X 
owners can 
insert 
animated 
characters in a 
text message, 
thanks to the 
way the X maps 
your face.

On the other end, your recipient receives the text with the Animoji but with the 
sound turned off. That person has to tap on the Volume icon to hear your 
recording. Tapping on the Animoji launches it full screen. The person can pause 
and replay the Animoji by tapping on the Pause or Play icon at the bottom of the 
screen.
You can also send a static Animoji with any 
facial expression. Select an Animoji, then look 
into your iPhone to place your face inside the 
frame. Make a face. Hold down the Animoji 
and drag it into a message to send it.
You can save an Animoji that you send or 
receive. Hold down the Animoji and swipe up 
on the screen. (On an iPhone 6 or earlier, an 
iPad, or an iPod touch, the recipient holds 
down the Animoji to bring up the menu.) 
Tap on Save, and the Animoji is saved to 
your device‚Äôs Camera Roll. To reuse it in a 
new text, tap on the Camera icon, and tap on 
the video clip of the Animoji (or select 
Photos as the source and then look for and 
tap on the clip).
From this menu, you can also copy the 
Animoji to use it in another message or 
forward it to someone else. Return to your 
text and tap on the Animoji to view it full 
screen. Tap on the iOS Share icon to share it 
via email, Facebook, Google +, or other apps 
and services.

WHATSAPP
TIPS & HOW TOS
T
he desire for encrypted communication is no longer limited to spies, 
informants, and journalists. Amidst news of widespread surveillance, 
secure messaging apps are growing in popularity. More than 1 billion 
people now use WhatsApp every day, sending 55 billion messages, 4.5 billion 
photos, and 1 billion videos.
:KDWV$SSPDNHVLWHDV\WRNHHSLQWRXFKZLWKIDU√ÄXQJIULHQGVRQWKHFKHDS
It‚Äôs free to text and call as long as you have a Wi-Fi or data connection. 
The IM-style service is more popular than the very similar Facebook Messenger, 
likely because it works on feature phones, which are common outside the US, 
and because it isn‚Äôt directly tied to Facebook, despite being owned by the huge 
social network.
Essential Tips for 
WhatsApp Users  BY CHANDRA STEELE  

Whatever you‚Äôre using WhatsApp for, though, you likely 
don‚Äôt know everything it can do. Here are our top tips.
FIND ME: If you don‚Äôt mind being caught in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 
¬øYHPLQXWHVDZD\¬¥¬øE\RXPLJKWZDQWWRWU\
WhatsApp‚Äôs Live Location feature. Share your 
location by opening a chat, clicking on the plus sign, 
and selecting Location, where you‚Äôll see an option to 
6KDUH/LYH/RFDWLRQ,W¬∂VDKDQG\ZD\WR¬øQG
someone in a crowd or to get an idea how long you 
have to wait before your friend shows up.
GET PINNED: Put the person you chat with more 
than anyone at the top of your messages list. Go to 
WKH&KDWVWDEDQG¬øQGWKHFKDW\RXZDQWWRPDNHD
priority. Swipe right and select Pin.
PRYING EYES: Do you want to be friendly but not 
give too much away on WhatsApp? Then protect 
your privacy by going to Settings > Account > 
Privacy. There you can change who can see when 
\RXZHUHODVWDFWLYH\RXUSUR¬øOHSKRWRDQGVWDWXV
You can also turn off read receipts, though you will 
then in turn not be able to see others‚Äô read receipts.
BACK IT UP: To save chats, whether you‚Äôre 
sentimental or stocking up on blackmail material, 
you can go to Settings > Chats > Chat Backup > Back 
Up Now.
YOU‚ÄôRE A STAR: Have a message you want to save? 
Star it so it‚Äôs easily accessible. Tap and hold the message 
and the Star icon will appear. To unstar it, do the same. 
The message is now viewable by going to Settings > 
Starred Messages.
TAKE YOUR FRIENDS WITH YOU: WhatsApp 
doesn‚Äôt operate only on your phone; you can use it on 

your computer, too. Go to web.whatsapp.com on your computer. On your 
phone, go to Settings > WhatsApp Web, and scan the QR code on your 
computer screen with your phone. There are also desktop apps for Windows 
and Mac.
GROUP THERAPY: If one of your #squadgoals is to never be out of touch one 
another, then you‚Äôll want to start a group chat. Go to the Chats tab and select 
New Group. Name the group, and select an image, if you want. Tap Next, and 
add participants either by selecting the plus (+) and adding them from a list or 
by typing in each name individually. Select Create when you‚Äôre done.
SHOUT IT OUT: To send a message to multiple people without them realizing 
they‚Äôre on a group chat, use the broadcast list feature. You can use this only with 
those who have you in their contact list. To broadcast, go to Chats > Broadcast 
Lists and either select an existing list or create a new one by clicking New List 
and typing in contact names. When recipients reply, it will be only to you and 
not the rest of the list.
PASSING NOTES: Last year, WhatsApp rolled out the ability to send 
GRFXPHQWVWRFRQWDFWV7RVHQGWDSWKHSOXVVLJQQH[WWRWKHWH[W¬øHOGL26
or the paperclip icon at the top of the screen (Android). On iOS, choose a doc 
from iCloud Drive or tap More for other options, like Google Drive (above). On 
Android, select the document you want to send and tap Send in the popup.

JAZZ UP YOUR PHOTOS & CHATS: In October, 
WhatsApp took a page from Snapchat, Instagram, and 
Skype, all of which allow the addition of text and 
doodles to images. On WhatsApp, editing tools appear 
automatically after you capture a new photo or video or 
import one saved on the phone. Then you can add text 
in different colors and fonts. WhatsApp also lets you use

tap the plus (+) button > Photos & Video Library > GIF 
button on bottom left. On Android, tap the emoji button 
and select GIF at the bottom of the screen.
STATUS CONSCIOUS: WhatsApp celebrated its 
eighth birthday by giving users the ability to expand 
their status updates beyond text. Photos, GIFs, and 
videos that disappear in 24 hours can now be shared 
with contacts. First, you‚Äôre going to want to control who 
sees your status update: Open WhatsApp and tap the 
Status icon in the bottom tray, then select Privacy. 
You‚Äôll be able to choose between your contacts, your 
contacts with the exception of some chosen people, and 
just contacts that you hand select. To use the feature, 
tap Status > My Status. It opens to the camera feature, 
where you can take a photo or record a video. Or select 
the photo icon, where you‚Äôll see your library of photos 
that you can select from. Also, at the bottom of that 
screen, you‚Äôll be able to tap GIF to search Giphy. Then 
just tap the send icon, and whoever you chose to see 
your status will receive it.
PICTURE PERFECT: WhatsApp has stepped up its 
photo game. When you get four or more photos or 
videos in a row from one person, they‚Äôre now be 
grouped together in a tile-display album within the 
message. When you tap it, you see a full-screen view of 
each image or video.
Editing tools 
appear auto-
matically after 
you capture a 
new photo or 
video or import 
one from your 
phone.

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING: Attach documents to a chat by opening the chat 
and tapping the plus (+). Click on Document, and choose the source you want to 
send it from.
PHOTO FINISH: Love them or hate them, you can handle a series of photos 
you‚Äôve received in one fell swoop. If you‚Äôve been sent multiple photos, tap them 
and hold, and you‚Äôll be presented with a choice to forward them all or delete 
them all.
TAKE IT BACK: There are some things you can never take back. But you can 
delete a message in WhatsApp. Tap and hold it, and choose Delete, followed by

WATCH ESPORTS ONLINE: Streaming esports via your desktop, laptop,

WATCH ESPORTS IN PERSON: The ‚Äúe‚Äù in ‚Äúesports‚Äù 
could lead you to believe that the only way to watch the 
contests is via electronic means, but that‚Äôs not the case. 
Esports has always had an ‚Äúanalog‚Äù real-world 
component, dating back to LAN parties and money bets 
LQGDQNVPRNH¬øOOHGDUFDGHV
For better or worse, LAN parties and arcades are pretty 
much things of the past. Nowadays, the two best 
methods to enjoy live esports is to visit community-run 
tournaments, such as East Coast Throwdown and 
&KLQDWRZQ%HDWGRZQRUPDVVLYHVWDGLXP¬øOOLQJHYHQWV
such as Brooklyn Beatdown and the Evolution 
Championship Series. Dedicated esports venues, 
including Blizzard Arena and Eleague Esports Arena, 
have popped up around the country in recent years as 
well. A few traditional sports venues, such as New 
York‚Äôs Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden, 
host esports events too.
You‚Äôll have to pay for tickets as you would for any other 
sporting event, but that‚Äôs the literal cost of cheering on 
your favorite player or team with thousands of other 
rabid fans.
