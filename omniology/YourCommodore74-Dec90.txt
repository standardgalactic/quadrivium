Limbo ll
You can wander around a
rather dank castle, smeg the
frag out of rival gangs, run a
successful games company,
and sort of gobble up loads
of dotty things, with this
month's completely FREE
plastic cassette thingmy!
Knightmare is based on the
ever so popular TeeVee
show where contestants ﬂap
around with a bucket on their
head, and is supplied by
Activision. Software House is
supplied by Cult, a
subsiduary of D&H Games,
and the other two are
completely original!!!

52 FISTS OUT FOR THE LADS
Sean Kelly, his name rymes with smelly, staples a squirrel to
a tree and beats the heck out of it... Afterwards he likes
nothing better than to have a cup of tea and a quick game of
International Karate 4.. Here he looks at the greatest beetles
ever (probably)!
56 QUASAR - LASER LIGHT FANTASTIC
What do you get if you invite a smattering of highly charged
journos to go around shooting each other with beams of
light? A group of even more highly charged journos going
around shooting beams of light at each the other. The YC
Team decided to accept the challenge and Jeffrey Davy,
he's not in the navy, reports.
62 ITS SYSTEMATIC
Rik Henderson. and his double jointed bendy thumb, takes a
trip to Pinner and the shiney ofﬁces of System 3. He looks at
their new releases, their old releases, and has a game of
Scalextric for old times sake, just don't ask us why!
STRIDER 2 - There's this geezer who mashes all kinds of
meanies, and do you know how he does it? By slashing
all over them! Yep, he gets out his chopper and uses it -
isn't it disgusting???
THE SPY WHO LOVED ME - Another serious case of
Bondage here with a Spyhunter clone disguised in a
tenous plot link with the early Roger Moore movie. He
was crap anyway, Sean Connery was much better, and
me mam thinks so too!

Big news in little Milton

2 k )  o f  YC covered in snot! Well, how else was I
First This except with a truly tacky and tasteless joke? Yep, it's time to
confess that YC, after one year, will be changing to suit 1991. But more of that
later, you want to know what's happening now!!!
If you ﬂap your mag around a bit you'll ﬁnd a big crunchy thing in the
middle, have a ﬂick through it 'cause this is your absolutely, splendidly free
comic featuring Post Apocalypse, Flame Head, and Oozin' Eugene in a look at
each of their lives in a way never seen before. And not only that but there's a
'cut-out-and-clothe' Posty with extra munchy add-ons to make him look even
more weird than ever before.
To compliment this though, next issue has another wicked free gift with
the inclusion of the Post Apocalypse board game (are we mega-generous or
what?), with tonnes of cards, counters, board and a game to coincide with it
on the tape. And for a few issues after that, there'll be more data on cassette,
more cards and more characters to collect in order to expand upon the basic
set (although everything you need to play for four players is included next
ish),
Also it's our birthday issue (why not send us a card, the best ones WILL be
rewarded) next month and we will be one year old (as VC). And to top it all,
there'll be more pages, more colour, more reviews, and a brand spanking new
look (Mark's got his thinking cap on)...
See ya around sometime (probably)!

TIE A
RE-INKED
RIBBON
Is the computer industry about to

EV Y
become a green issue along
with ozone friendly hairspray
and disposable nappies?
Ofﬁce 21 have come up with
their own answer to the 26
million computer ribbons
thrown away last year called
"Re-Ink"
which not only helps save the
environment but the
computer users pocket!
B A B  ES I
The ink formula, which
started off life in a bucket in
the MD Simon Caspell's
kitchen is sprayed onto the
top of the fading ribbon. I t
then spreads evenly as it
dries giving a better than
new quality black print. A  tin of this
wonder stuff costs El 2.95 and can
replenish ribbons over 30 times.
Think of all the savings! Th e
only problem is - what do you do
with the empty tin!

PLAYING
AGAINST
TIME
Joystick Kings, Spectravideo
have launched a new innovative
stick called the Mega Board to their
impressive range, complete with
well um nearly everything but the
kitchen sink, this stick does
everything apart from time travel
itself!
What's new about this one I hear
you ask - well, the stick is ﬁtted with
double digital stop watches, which
count both upwards and downwards
in time and which if used to best
effect can enhance gameplay no
end! Fo r instance, if in two-player
mode you can time eachother's
performance and compare results.
Think about it logically dudes - one-
player games can be made into two
player games! I f  you're on your own
(snifﬂe, snifﬂe) you can check your
own performances against
eachother - use one clock to
indicate your best time and the other
to measure current time. The clocks,
apart from just telling the time can
also vary the speed of the player
and the speed of the auto-ﬁre.
This Board-acious product is in
the shops now priced at £24.95 and
for the games player who thinks he
has everything would make a super
Chrimbo stocking ﬁller!
STARS

• This is the personal rating given by the reviewer

This game Is so abysmal that the only reason anybody

Not too awful, and probably somebody's cup of tea.

A good game with more going for it than most. It'd be best

NIGHT

Welcome to the game...
This is the Time to end all
Time;
This is the Time out of
Mind;
This is the Game out of
Time
And the game to blow your
Mind
"Welcome Watchers of
Illusion
To the Castle of Confusion.
I am known as Treguard,
Master of the Dungeons.
Now is the time that your
ﬁrst quest calls
From Damonia Castle's
dark
halls.
Fighting the evils that
creep here
From depths, things that
feed on fear.
Spell casting use in times
of need,
If ever you are to be freed.
Warning! Warning! I will
watch you
And give an occasional
clue.
Here be Oracles of good
and bad fame:
One named RUIALIS, one
Buggane.
Quiz them when you need
advising
1

On all sorts of things
surprising.
But the ﬁrst Knightmare
quest is yours
To win or lose (or die, of
course).
For here nothing Is real
And all must surely be an
illusion.
So just keep telling
yourself:
'It's only a game...'
Isn't it?"
Let us enter now the book of
legend...
I place you somewhere in time, in
a land where strangers are not
welcome. Survival is your aim,
knowledge is your target. Search the
dungeons and rooms of Damonia
Castle for the objects which may help
free you from the clutches of the dark
castle and it's fantastical inhabitants.
Your advisors are two oracles,
who act as clue givers. One oracle is
good, and often gives correct clues
in the form of riddles etc. The bad
oracle will do everything it can to
throw the knight into certain danger
and death. The knight may consult
the oracles, but only one will answer,
and may not be cross-examined by
the knight. By carefully studying the
contents of both oracles' statements,
valuable clues may be learned.
Your life force is represented by a
candle at the edge of the page. It will
decrease throughout the game. Life
force is further decreased each time
the player is hit by a guard, for
example, and life force never
increases.
Each page of the book details
some place within the castle, into
which life is breathed when you
direct the knight into it. The dungeon
master and oracles watch over all of
the knight's actions and each may
appear from time to time to offer
comment.
Controlling your
knight
View Words - 'SHIFT'
Enter Words - 'RETURN'
Certain inhabitants of the castle
will ask you questions and give you
problems to solve. Warning! Read the
questions very carefully before you
select an answer or solution. Conﬁrm
your selection by pressing the ﬁre
function.
To perform speciﬁc functions
within the castle, You may use one or
two word commands.
Select the ﬁrst word of your
required command by pressing the
ﬁrst letter of that word. If the speech
bubble at the top of the screen does
not display the word you require,
press the shift key. This will show you
the next available word.
When the speech bubble displays
your required ﬁrst word, press the
Enter Word function. A second word
will now appear - again, you may
alter this word by pressing the ﬁrst
letter of the required second word or
the Shift key to cycle through the
available words.
When both words together make
the command you wish to use - le,
open door - press the Enter Word
function key. This command will now
be issued. Be very choosy!
If you press 'D' and the word
'Drink' is displayed when you wish to
drop something, press the Shift key
until the word 'Drop' appears. Press
Enter Word function and select the
second word in similar fashion.
You may repeat your last
command by pressing Enter twice.
You may change the second word of
your instruction before pressing the
enter key a second time if you wish.
To view the available command
words press the Shift key.
Certain commands, such as Load,
Save or Quit are one word
commands.
To see your inventory (the things
you are carrying) press the 'I' key.
Spelicasting
The knight cannot see due to the
necessary full-facial helmet. And so
you must use a joystick and
keyboard keys to control the
movement of your knight.
The keys are:
Fire -
Move Left -
Move Right -
Move Down -
Move Up
Pause Game -
Resume Game - Use Fire
Quit Game - '0' Then 'Y'
Start Game - Use Fire
Merlin's Magic. You'll have to
work out how to gain these magical
powers, but beware! These powers
require experimentation - some of
them are good, some of them are
bad, you must establish for yourself
which is which.
We know very little about the
spells available but old spell books
tell us the following:
To use a spell, you must select
the word SPELL as the ﬁrst word,
then the name of the spell as the
second word, then press Enter or the
Life button to execute that spell.
Note! You ﬁrst have to ﬁnd the spells.
ANVIL: This is a large, cast-iron
anvil, which hovers at the top of the
screen, causing evils to be squashed
into the ground.
CASPAR: Caspar the key. May be
used on certain doors within the
castle.
ALCHEMY: Turns characters to a
solid gold sphere. Most objects
turned to gold may then be collected
by the knight as treasure.
ICE: A rain cloud will form and
freeze everything. As soon as the
cloud vapourises the characters will
come back to life.
TOAD: Turns characters into
'warty' toads.
METAMORPH: Turns characters
into different characters.
Fighting
In order to ﬁght you will need to
ﬁnd a weapon, such as a sword, then
by moving next to the character you
wish to ﬁght and pressing the ﬁre
function repeatedly you will be able
to engage in combat.
You may also pick up bricks to
throw at other characters. To do this
you may either use the instructions to
tell your knight to 'Throw Bricks' or
you may set the ﬁrst command word
to 'Throw' and then use the ﬁre
function to trigger the throwing.
Saving and
loading
If you choose the command
'Save' this will save your current
position for future usage. You may
return to this position by selecting
'Load'. Please note, this is a
RAMSAVE, and is not saved to
cassette or diskette, and so if you
switch off your computer you lose
your original position.
They say that life is but a game
So welcome to the game...
Where you can lose it;
Your life, that is.
MOBSTER
Mobster is fast, furious arcade
strategy game set in the dog-eat-dog
world of 1920s Chicago. As the boss
of a small gang of disgruntled thugs,
your ambition is to claw your way up
the slippery latter of organised crime
by taking on business opportunities,
or should one say organised
massacres that come on offer from
day to day.
The strategy-decision screens in
Mobster are very user-friendly. They
use a joystick-pointer system, so you
just point and press to select an
option.

Getting the scam
The game opens on the
information screen. This does not
allow you to input any commands,
but just displays basic information
about the gang. Your gang starts with:
3 members
2 shotguns
15 crates of booze
1 limousine
The gang's overall morale is 5,
and each member is being paid $15
per day. Your total starting capital is
$500.
Money makes the underworld go
round. This is what you're trying to
gain, and once you've got it you can
spend it on weapons, paying off gang
members, new limousines to carry
them, and booze which can be
pushed at a proﬁt or used.
To get money, you must take on
one of the 'jobs' on offer, or sell some
of your stock of booze. Every day,
four different jobs are on offer. To
view these, select the VIEW JOBS
option using the pointer. A specimen
job might read:
JOB #1 TAKE OUT A MINOR
MAFIA DRUGS RING ON 44TH
STREET FOR $2407.
Maﬁa hoods are moderately
skilled and therefore hard to go up
against. The other options are police,
the most difﬁcult, and civilian, the
least. The size of the operation;
small; large: or major determines the
number of snipers you must shoot to
gain control and complete the job.
The fee, of course varies with the
difﬁculty of job.
BONUSES
If you complete a job, various
bonuses may be awarded. Knocking
over the booze ring, above, would
award you extra booze. A protection
racket will get you extra money, a
headquarters; extra gang members
and an operation; extra weapons.
You don't always get the bonus.
To accept a job, you select one
from t he View Orders menu. Just
point to the job you want and press
ﬁre. This menu also allows you to buy
and sell booze and issue them to the
gang, and purchase other things
such as weapons and cars, providing
you have the money. You can also
increase the gang members' wages,
if they are getting restless.
When you have selected a job,
you can choose the resources you
wish to devote to it, including gang
members and limos. Remember you
can only get six gang members in
one limo. You can also select how
many weapons to use. These can be
shotguns or submachine guns.
Submachine guns can ﬁre faster, but
are more expensive and use up more
ammo.
Into Combat
After selecting and equipping your
force, you proceed to the combat
choice screen. This allows you to
Attack or Retreat. After every attack
you return to thus choice, but to attack
you must have hoods and weapons
left. Retreating without completing the
job may badly affect morale.
Selecting Attack will get you into
an arcade shoot-out. You will be
faced with a view of the buildings
holding the operation you are trying
to take out. The enemy snipers will
pop up in windows and on roofs, and
you must shoot as many of them as
you can as fast as possible.
The targetting cursor is a circle
controlled by the cursor. This is not
the gunsight, however. The sight is a
set of cross-hairs which has a certain
inertia i t  may take some time for it
to home in on the target, making life
much harder.
Be careful not to waste ammo, as
running out may lead to the loss of
men and weapons. If the snipers are
left standing for too long you may
also take losses.
If you shoot enough snipes, you
get paid, gang morale rises and you
stand a 60 per cent chance of getting
a bonus.
Keep the boys
happy
Bear in mind that morale is
crucial. If the gang's morale drops
too low, the treacherous bunch may
well shoot you in the back. At the
very least, their performance drops.
Morale may be preserved by paying
higher wages, or issuing some of
your stash of booze to the gang
members.
Got the picture? OK, now off you
go. Oh and remember le t 's be
careful out there!

running your own software company.
Can you be a successful director of
an up and coming software house?
You have the program n o w  it's up to
you. Is this all we can give in the way
of instructions? Yep, sure is!
LIM0
We now present for your
entertainment and amusement the
updated version of Limbo (previously
published on the YC tape), aptly titled
Limbo II P la n e t  Dillon. As before,
plug your joystick into port 2 to move
Wolthamstow around each zone. The
idea of the game is to clear all of the
blobs off the squares whilst avoiding
the Dillonite guards. Contact with
these or the scrolling background
results in energy loss. Flashing
squares will electrocute you. Blocks
with moving squares on them are
random squares, If you move onto
one of these and press the ﬁre
button, something at random will
happen. (It could be good, bad or
extremely bad). Squares with moving
arrows on them hurl you off in that
direction. That's all there is to it!!!

out his
chopper in sticky situations, waving
it in front of himself and watching
other people die in awe. This sort of
behaviour would have been liable to
get this fellow locked away for the
rest of his life if he wasn't Strider, the
righter of wrongs and habitual
slasher. And even then he'd have to
perform a few 'favours' for the local
constabulary.
One of the favours that he has
been roped in to perform in order for
certain people to ignore his
antisocial habits comes straight from
the top, from the leaders of the world
themselves. They seem to have
gotten themselves into a bit of
bovver, 'cause whilst they were
arguing about a new world wide
currency, and who could have the
last jam scone, some big bug eyed
loonies from outer space
zipped down, frolicked around
a bit, and made off with some
bint who just happens to look
like Maria Whittiker. Now if this
was THE Maria Whittiker we'd
not even bat an eyelid, we
might even have a street party,
but this gorgeous being in the
female mould just so happens
to be one of the most inﬂuential
world leaders on this planet.
Now you must put on your

call him Strider?) and rescue

and ban you from the crochet circle.
All you know though, is that she's
being held on the planet Magenta,
and she's at the end of ﬁve levels of
gruelling gameplay.
The ﬁrst level ﬁnds you in a forest
where you have landed your
transport and you must make your
way to the two towers (the outer
defence of the planet), which is the
second, and you must progress
through ﬁve areas of the planet in
order to ﬁnally rescue the pretty
politician.
Each level is HUGE and consists
of an immense amount of mapping,
'else the only way you'll complete it
is by an utter ﬂuke. There are tonnes
of Magentans (?) to stop you from

spacecraft, and even if you manage
to swathe your way through those
you have to face big munchy end-of-
level guardians before you can
progress. But Strider has a new
power in the sequel, you see, if you
collect the icons that are scattered
around and you manage to collect
enough of them, you'll transform into
a big and mean, I'll eat your spleen,
robot with extra
ﬁrepower. If
you don't then
you'll probably
ﬁt into another
can
as well as his wobbly sword, which
he can use when he is stationary, and
sometimes it will be essential to use
it. And as well as the little chap's
amazing acrobatic powers, he's able
to scale walls and climb up ropes
and chains too (amazing this fellow
isn't he?) and you'll need to do tons
of that believe me!

Strides is another name for
a pair of trousers, so is chaps

surprising because he'd spelt
trousers wrongly, and people
usually like their record sleeves
grammatically correct.

the sweep of hot laser ﬁre belching
from your sword spanks any
unwanted company. The graphics
though seem to have changed quite
dramatically and the colours aren't
as pretty as Strider, although when
you consider the fact that the
levels are much larger than
they were in the original you
probably have your
answer.
The ﬁrst game was a
Capcom coin-op
conversion and the
news is that this is going
the other way round, it
has been designed and
programmed by Tiertex
(responsible
for LOADS of
games) and
Capcom will be
converting it ONTO
an arcade machine.
Although Strider II
reminds me a lot of

it has suitable

beg fans of the original

to buy it. It's a rootin',

honours table mentions the
tipsters of the month, with
some of their ugly monikers,
and the prizes that they've
won, allowing for the tips
themselves to be free ﬂowing.
RANKINGS
Private Prat - A badge and a chance
to clean out Scum city's loos with a
toothbrush awaits those who get this
rating.
Corporal Crud - A T-shirt is the reward
for this honour, generally without the
sweat stains.
Sergeant Slime - A free game on
cassette or disk is for those who
manage this rank.
Captain Colostomy - Two free games
here.
General Gunge - Your tips would have
to be absolutely stunningly wonky for
this. If so you'll ﬁnd yourself on a day
out live role-playing with the YC team.
BEACH VOLLEY
(Ocean)
Not a great game but never mind.
When the computer serves to you
'dig' the ball towards your partner as
normal, then run off to the left. The
partner will help it towards you, but
the landing cross should be outside
the area. Let it land and the daft bug
gives a point to your side. Easy.
On your serve the best thing to do is
the jump serve, it occasionally beats
the opposition (unlike the useless
normal serve).
FLIMBO'S
QUEST
(System 3)
1. Of course the ﬁrst thing to buy is
the SUPER WEAPON. It lasts for the
length of 1 life only though.
2. Buy at least one unit of time each
level.
3. NEVER save up for a SUPER
SCROLL. If you do, and get past a
tricky level like 4 or 5, you will be
confronted by an even tougher one,
with barely any time or money.
Perhaps buy a normal scroll or two
later on.
4. Build up your money in the easy
early levels. Some creatures (like the
egg of level 3) always give you
money, while some like the small
walkers of levels 1 and 3 only give
you it a few times at the most.
5. Be careful, when you duck, to
release down before ﬁre on bridges,
etc. You could accidentally fall to
your doom!
BLASTBALL
(fC Tape - April
'90)
1. For the later levels an enlarged bat
is essential.
2. Be careful from changing from
enlarged bat to being small (which
can be disastrous).
3. When aiming a caught ball don't
take too long o r the ball will ﬂy off on
its own accord.
4. The laser can destroy otherwise
indestructible blocks, useful for
getting to others behind it.
DRAGON NINJA

1. The jump then kick is utterly

of them). Repeatedly use it and they

2. If you keep using a certain
movement, some baddies will get
wise to it and know how to defend
from it. Change your attacking
movement now and again.
3. In the ﬁnal level, on the helicopter,
don't fall off or do a high jump.
Similarly, don't go off the truck or the
train, or there goes some energy.
4. Turn off the computer before the
end screen comes up. It is so
disappointingly pathetic, you'll throw
up.
PIPEMANIA

bars.
ANNEFRANK - For a low energy top
up.
LUMBJAK - For double length energy
bar.
KLAX
(Domark)
Start Klax as normal and select the
ﬁrst wave. Press CAPS LOCK and at
any time during the game press
SPACE. While holding SPACE down
press 3 to skip a level or press 4 to
start on level 100.
DELIVERANCE
(Hewson)
To get onto levels 3+4, load them in
after 1+2 and type in RJAARDGB.
This enables you to start level 3 with
7 lives and 22 fairies.
To get onto levels 5+6, load them in
after 3+4 and type in ASEFFNWS.
This enables you to start level 5 with
8 lives and 21 fairies.
INTERNATIONAL
3D TENNIS
(Palace)
When you are serving hit the ball too
far on your ﬁrst serve. The computer
will usually miss the ball on your
second serve. N.B. This cheat will not
work in the ﬁnals.
NINJA SPIRIT
(Activision)
Type VODKA on the title screen for
inﬁnite lives.
KENNY
DALGLISH
SOCCER MATCH
(Impressions)
Turn off your computer before you
throw up.
CHAMBERS OF
SHAOLIN

On the swinging ball round, go to the
right of the screen,
move
around kicking the air and the ball
will soon start to move. Keep this up
and the ball soon knocks the door
down to block one water pipe.
ALIENS (US
VERSION)
(Alternative)
When you are asked your status
code enter:
5506F - To get to operations.
9061D - To reach the maze.
7060E - To reach landing bay.
Note I didn't include the last code,
that would make it too easy.
NEMESIS
(The Hit Squad)
At title screen hold down SHIFT and
press SPACE until a 'C' appears at
the top of the screen, you will then be
invincible.

NE SPY 1111110
O
but a mere seven years of age,
my uncle and aunt dragged
me down to a dodgy cinema in
Hackney to see this movie. Just as I
was getting into it the projector
broke down and we were all ejected
from the premises with our refunded
money clutched in our grubby mitts.
It wasn't for yonks and yonks that I
got to see the whole ﬁlm, and it's a
bit of a stonker too.
It's a shame that the game isn't
quite as good. This is probably due
to the fact that we've seen it, played
it, done it all before, and about six
years ago an'all. You see, Spyhunter
was a really corking game in it's day,
and if it were to be updated it would
need a fair amount of work to make
it as good as the current batch of
arcade garnes that are ﬂooding the
Chrissy market. The Spy Who Loved
Me has more in common with
Spyhunter than the word 'Spy', and
unfortunately it is not even as
playable as the ancient classic let
alone being a vastly better version.
But you may not have
encountered Spyhunter in the past
so I'll give you an idea of what the
gameplay is like. You are a car (or a
boat, or a jet ski) and you progress
up a vertically scrolling screen whilst
trying to keep to the road, or
avoiding the water hazards. You
must also collect icons on the way
(D' icons as it goes) and avoid the
nasty enemy cars who are trying to
stop you.
If you collect enough icons, you
can roll into the 'C' truck, that
appears on screen every so often,
and you can buy extra munchy
things for your car. If you collect
seventy ﬁve of the little buggers you
can buy Submarine capability for
your car, which allows you to access
the
shoot-
em-up part of the game (the only
variation in the gameplay). You must
eventually get this, and if you haven't

.101,1E1)
enough tokens by the time the water
entry post appears the road wraps
around and you must continue going

was but a minute part of the ﬁlm, yet
that is what the game concentrates
upon. Although The Spy Who Loved
Me is not a bad game in any
deﬁnition of the word - the graphics
are well-drawn though the scrolling is
very jerky, the action is pretty fast,
and the sound is boosted by an
excellent version of the Bond theme,
acid style - it is overshadowed by
former Bond games (Licence To Kill,
Live And Let Die) and this game has
been done oh so many times.

new one, we'll get that straight
from the start. System 3
deemed that The Last Ninja 2 was
mega stonkingly good game and it
is not right that it has been taken
from the shelves so that new
commie 64 owners can't buy
a copy. And that is the
essential reasoning
around the decision to
release a laded up'
version of the classic,
and owners of The Last
Ninja 2 must not be
confused into thinking
that this is a new Ninja
game.
All said and done though,
I'll review this like any other
release 'cause a) we've never
reviewed the original, b) it's
absolutely stonky in every respect,
and c) because I want to and I'll sit in
the corner sulking until you let me...
(Half an hour later, cries of "Okay,
you can review it" come from the
readers)... Snifﬂe...
The game was written in much
the same way as a movie would be,
and the plot was devised similarly,
and you get the feeling as if you are
really participating in the action as
you see it. This is helped by the 3D-
from-left-hand-corner perspective,
which adds a new dimension
(literally) to the tried and tested
typical beat-em-up, and
there is a lot of arcade
adventuring to be done too.
You see, you are
Armakuni and you've been
swiped by the gods and
placed in Manhaften (in a
park primarily) so that you
can hunt down the evil
Shogun Konitoki and kick his
head in. But all of
your
) 1 ( 1 1 '
Bare Facts
My grandad was so hard that
he could kill a man with his
bare feet, unfortunately he was
beaten up one day as he was
trying to get his shoes and
socks off. (This is such an old
joke that if we ever hear it
again your ganglies will be
kicked off by the Welsh rugby
team - The Readers).
Ninja guile and wit will be called for
because you've got no weapons
whatsoever, and there's loads of
police around that are on the
Shogun's payroll, and they have no
qualms about giving you a good
thrashing.
So you must explore the park to
ﬁnd objects that you'll need on your
quest, while you are having a bit of a
barney with the local constabulary,
and eventually ﬁnd the exit.
The game is in six parts (six loads
on everything but cartridge), each of
which with loads of enemies to be
degoolied, and tonnes of puzzles,
easy and hard, to be completed. Not
only must you pick up the objects
that are scattered around (some are
well hidden), you must also use them
at the right times, and in the right
way.
The graphics are STILL
incredible, and the presentation has
been vastly improved - the game's
intro is gorgeous. The Last Ninja 2,
and now Ninja Remix was, is, and
until The Last Ninja 3 is released,
always will be the best arcade
adventure available. It appeals to
many different sorts though, so if you
want something more than the
average shoot-em-up you can't go
far wrong with Ninja Remix.

once again the big
bag of YC mail...
PAP GROUPS
I would like to say how great your
mag is!! Well, I just did.
But not everything in the world is
so great, I am sorry to say. When I
buy my mag I expect computer
things. Why do I ﬁnd stupid pop
groups featured in the mag when it's
supposed to be for computers only?
Please do something about it as I
buy it for my computer.
Tell any pop groups to go and see
the producer of Smash Hits. Thank
You.
Adolphus Okalkol, Somewhere
on this (or another) planet
PA: The reason you ﬁnd pop
groups infesting these hallowed
pages is because if you
concentrated solely on computer
thangs your joystick would wilt
and your pixels would swell. The
occasional delve into the real
world is a laugh too, ne s t pas?
A QUICK POKE
I have just tried the pokes from
'Jeppo' in the September issue of
YC. I am utterly furious!
This guy ‘,..leppo' earned himself
lots of goodies which you kindly sent
him for a load of tips which just don't
work. When I ﬁrst saw his tips I
thought "great", some games I have
not yet cracked were included and I
would have them beat in half an
hour! But looking at the given 'SYS'
address' I thought they looked like
an unusual place to initiate machine
code. I was right. It is pretty obvious
this guy has just written anything,
without even attempting to give
instructions.
How can you permit this? He is
bringing down the standard of your
mag, confusing other readers and
being rewarded in the processIIIIII
Fair enough, I only tried six of his
tips, but come on six out of six
mistakes adds up to 100% rubbish.
Is this guy really this bad or can
Eugene not read? I am sure I speak
for all your readers.
Howlin' Mad Mick, Sunderland
PS. Is Oozin Eugene really
Eugene Lacey from Zzap?
PA: Ooze says that he's
looking into it, and his newly
trained hacking hamsters will be
vigorously checking every tip that
we receive in future, so it's not
worth sending in tips that you
know not to be genuine. And no,
he's not Eugene Lacey (ex) Zzap
member, and what is Zzap
anyway?
A FAIR KOP
Hello, you have never had a letter
from me before. I'd just like to say
that Rik is a good man cos he
supports the skillfulest, undefeated,
and the one and only team in the
league, LIVERPOOL!
I bought YC last year and have
bought it ever since, it is good. The
tape is brill and well worth the dosh.
The mag itself needs more tips and a
clever contact page, I would be
interested on starting the role. I have
completed ( print them on the CC
page please (if you want one)) these
games:
Z777, SE KAA OF ASSIAH, ZAK
MCKRACKEN, HOLY GRAIL, NEVER
ENDING STORY, KENTILLA,
CRICKET CRAZY, HOBBIT &
FOOTBALL FRENZY.
Also can you tell me when these
PA: No CC page is
likely, but Pauly babes has
completed every adventure
game ever anyway probably, so
those that need help should
write to him at the regular
address. But your knowledge
will be required if anybody
should wish tips for any of the
above games.
Liverpool FC is
not likely to be
released
'cause
Grands lam
went under
(a shame really
as Rik saw it way
back in January
and liked it a lot),
Mean Streets is out (we
reviewed it a fe w issues
ago), and the others will
never make it to the
commie
unfortunately.
PS. C64s
live forever?
Rik has just had to bury his
humble commie in the YC back
yard, and it was only an infant
(but a mere six years of age) so
they don't live forever, they all
go sometime.

You
WHAT?
What cartridge do
I buy?
John Roay,
Forest Hill,
London
PA: Erm... I really depends
on what you want to do with
it mate! if you want to turn
your commie into the QE2,
then you'll need the QE2
expansion kit, available at
many dockyards for only
about 10 squillion
quid. If you want to
enter
pokes without SYS numbers, you
should get yourself any of the
commercially available carts
(Power Cartridge, Action Replay,
etc).
TWIN FREAKS
After reading your article on
software piracy (which was well
pointed out), I think you are
right, it's not fair. I think the
blame lies partly with
public libraries, which
rent games out, and
people are
copying them on
twin tape
stereos.
Also, when I
write a decent
letter to a
magazine, I do
not expect to
be insulted
as I was in
your
magazine (Oct
- Post
Acropolis,
Multiloaderz...).
It's no use
putting a reply in
your mag for this
letter, as I have
cancelled my order for
VC.
G. Holland, St.
Helens
PA: Aaaah, is likkle
wikkle, pooky wookums upset at
the way he was treated. And
what's the point in writing if you
can't accept a little constructive
criticism (offered by my half
cousin, Post Acropolis).
Anyway, we've decided to
shop you to the
Federation Against
Software Piracy for
knowing how to copy
games (how many
pirate copies have
you got in your
collection).

SUPERMAG
I am writing to suggest that YC
does a C64GS section, seeing that all
the cartridges will work on all the
ordinary C64s (and C128s for that
matter) out in the wide world!
And also I think that YC is the top
C64 mag available in the sprawling
metropolismw (Slurp! Slurp!)
Richard Jeremy, Andover,
Hampshire
PS. I think that YC should have a
mail order service.
PPS, The Purple Fishlord of Czar
is strange.
PPPS. This tin of Spam is a dude.
PPPPS. You are impatient!! (So is
Flamehead!!)
PA: So you want a C64GS
section eh? Just as well 'cause in
our brand spanking new look
January ﬁrst birthday
extravaganza, there's about 10
pages dedicated to the 064GS,
and likewise in every issue on.
PS. We're working on it. How
about a fernall order service?
PPS. Fishy says "thanks".
PPPS. The tin of Spam is on
holiday at the moment in
HAMburg, he'll be back soon.
PPPPS. I'm not THAT
impatient, I can last about ﬁve
seconds before I shoot the rest
of the bus queue.
Don't forget, if you wish
your letters to be answered
by the man with less charm
than Bernard Manning's
groinal area, send them to
POST APOCALYPSE,
VC, 20 POTTERS LANE,
KILN FARM, MILTON
KEYNES, MK11 3HF.
The winner of the Letta
of the Munf award in

the game with the
highest score that
month, and every letter
printed will receive a
Post Apocalypse badge.
LETTER OF THE
JOLLY HOCKEY STICKS
In your radical October edition I noticed that your YC
reader's survey said that only 4.3% of your readers are
female. Well I'm proud to say that I am one of the 4.3%
who read this well ace mag, so I thought I'd write to you
and tell you that I'm not pleased.
Nearly every one of your editions has reviews or ads
about football games. I do enjoy football and I read
these reviews but my favourite sport is hockey. Do you
know if there are any hockey games for the C64? If so,
could you review them? After all I do go to a real lot of
trouble to get this mag 'cause it's real hard to get ya
hands on down here in the very south west. Apart from
that I think your mag is what we surfers call 'mellow'.
Emma Fitchett, St. Ives, Cornwall
PS. How come only 4.3% of your readers are
female but 6.8% wear kinky lace knickers (and I am
not one of the 6.8% either). This is weird and so
must be some of your male readers.
PA: We only review predominantly footy games 'cause
companies tend to only release that sort of thang. As for
hockey games, come on be sensible. Would a game that
features 22 men or women running around on a bit of
grass, hitting a small ball (but mostly smacking the heck
out of each other) with big wooden sticks, be a success?
Erm... Yes probably! There isn't anything at this time
though. There's a few games based on surﬁng.
PS. The fact that a few lads wear kinky lace knickers is
not weird to me. I wear a leather codpiece, with studs
(on the inside).

Rik casts his jeepers peepers over the latest
games that can be bought for under three quid...
FOOTBALL
CHAMPIONS
Cult
E2.99
We all know that Cult has made a
name for itself with good football
strategy games, but the formula
seems to be wearing a little thin now.
This is probably because the games
that are now being released are little
11111111111W1•110 Se I •  SIMMS* •  M I  •

more
than a poor reworking
of D&I-1
Games' (the owners of this budget
label) Football Director, and as such
are starting to bore.
This is stressed by the fact that
Football Champions offers nothing
new in the footy management stakes
in fact it doesn't offer enough.
There is only the league and the FA
Cup as awards for a good manager
and there are only three divisions in
any order. Not only that but the
updating of the games is a tad slow
and the whole event is one big yawn!
If you're after a good footy sim,
try Football Director if you're willing
to spend a tenner, or if you only have
three quid in your pocket, Cult has
more than enough football games in
its range that are far better.
SKORE 47
OUE-DEX
Kixx
E2.99
This was ﬁrst released, to much
acclaim, by Thalamus, and was
possibly one of the most original
pieces of software ever.
It's good to notethat things
haven't changed much. The game is
still very original, and still fares very
well amongst the rash of new think-
em-ups. Que-Dex also calls for
Imria
Atop.

lightning reﬂexes and sound joystick
handling. But what is so different
about it?
For a start you play the part of a
ball, something that only small,
unfunny comedians called Bobby
have succeeded in before. And you
must get from your starting point to
the goal, although this is not as easy
as John Barnes makes it seem.
There are many hazards to surpass,
and a clock that ticks down faster
than a dodgy microwave. And even if
you manage it, there are tonnes of
levels to complete, some of which
are very cunning.
This is more than worth three
quidies 'cause it'd have you hooked
for weeks, and that's what you want
from a game really, isn't it?
SKORE 97
THE GAMES
WINTER
EDITION
Ki)oc
E2.99
Another rerelease, this time one
of the famous Epyx Games
games,

although this is perhaps the
poorest of them all.lt was essentially
an updated version of the best-
selling Winter Games, and is very
similar in concept. It offers eight
players the chance to compete in an
Olympic style tournament that
consists of several different events,
but unfortunately most of the
separate sports in this'un are a little
too hard for the average games
player.
Mind you there ARE seven events
to complete, all of which are based
around winter sports, and there is a
good mix of games styles for the
more experienced games player.
The luge is okay, and the skiing
games are reasonable, but the ﬁgure
skating is bloody difﬁcult, and not too
interesting anyway. That said, if
you've got the rest of the games in
the range, The Games Winter Edition
is a worthwhile buy, mainly 'cause
you know what your getting. If you've
never seen what this sort of thing is
about, it'd be wise to buy one of the
others in the range ﬁrst.

OUTLAW
Players
Premier
E2.99
We've not heard much from
Players recently, but thanks to a deal
with Infogrames the label has gotten
hold of an excellent shoot-em-up for
rerelease.
Outlaw is very Commando in the
ﬁrst glance, but after a double take
you realise that it's a rather generic
vertically scrolling shooty, although it
is rather a fast and smooth one at
that. You get four levels to choose
from, and you must wander up the
screen, avoiding barrels and boulders
and shooting the cheap hoodlums
that lie between you and your bounty.
When you reach the end of a
level, you are faced with the criminal
that you were after and you must
shoot it out with him in order to
collect your dosh.
• i  t  t  •
•
tit•
The graphics are pretty simple,
but serve their purpose, and there are
extra weaponry, shields etc. to
collect on the way.
Well worth E2.99 if you ask me.

GUARDIAN
ANGEL
Codemasters
E2.99
What a pile of poop, and no
mistake. Shrouded in a thin excuse
for a plot, you are a Guardian Angel
in downtown Manhatten and you
must beat the frag out of everybody,
Guardian Angel is a small, neatly
formed, turd, with little more than a
rather nice plastic cassette box
going for it.
It was ﬁrst released abroad as

something just as ridiculous and it's
not hard to see why it was never
released as a full-price game in this
country.

I may sound unfair but I don't see
the appeal of a glitching character
shambling along a badly scrolling
backdrop and kicking the frag Out of
anything that moves, and that IS
essentially it!
Codemasters has done so much
better stuff in the past, and will do in
the future. Guardian Angel has a halo
made from a smelly brown
substance and no mistake.

Another management game from
the sport dedicated budget label and
this is much more like it. You are the
manager of a motorcycle team, and
must control two cyclists in the bid
for team, and individual glory.

make a game, so you must also take

a part in the racing by requesting
when one of your team must go in for
a pitstop (which is generally quite
often).
The racers have skill levels, and
the bikes have ratings so that
winning is not totally random, and
your actions will also have an effect
on the outcome, ie. the tyre tread for
the correct weather.
Although the races take a fair
while to adjudge, and the action is
about as interesting as you're going
to ﬁnd in this sort of game, the
interaction is weighed just about
right, and that's what makes a game
of this type work.

Epic, £1.25, John

(Writers), Mike
McMahon (artist)
Tony Pilgrim's
got a few problem.
He's the only
surviving member of
the human race. For
company he has
three droids; Abel,
Baker and Charlie
whose command of English is limited
to a bizarre and hilarious concoction
of late eighties adspeak - providing
an ironic counterpoint to the hideous
realities of this post-apocalypse thrill
kill kult. His mission. To defend the
USA against foreign inurgents,
except, there is no enemy to ﬁght. In
the circumstances he does what any
sane man would; he gets screaming,
raving, white hot drunk.
This latter day Pilgrim's Progress
is brought to you warts and big guns
'n• all b y three names what should
be familiar to anyone who has read
2000 AD for more than two weeks.
John Wagner created Judge Dredd,
writing a fair portion of the classic
stories with partner Alan Grant. And
for many of Britain's bright young
comic things, Mike McMahon, with
his big boots and incredible
hardware deﬁned the look of British
action/adventure comics. Take a look
at Tank Girl and compare if you don't
believe me. McMahon's been absent
from the scene for a few years due to
illness, but this is a startling return to
form. The only shame of it is that The
Last American, full of the trade mark
black humour and subtle politics of
classic British comics is published
by an American company, denying
you the chance to buy it at your local
newsagents.

Alan Grant is

SPECIAL
Fleetway, E2.50, Various
with Stuart Green
present he's writing Batman, Legion
90, Lobo, The Bogie Man (with John
Wager), and regularly contributing to
2000 AD as well as the above. Most
of the above are recognisable for
their smart ass, gin wracked humour,
but this, a revival of one of Jack
Kirby's lesser known characters sees
Grant turning in the jokes with the
empties.
The Demon is Etrigan, spawn of
hell, imprisoned in the body of a
mortal, one Jason Blood. Etrigan can
only get free when Blood sleeps,
which for the purposeds of the story
is most of the twenty-four pages. We
catch The Demon in mid-scheme as
he attempts to lead his bad seeds in
a mutiny and make bell his kingdom.
Despite the promising cover line:
"Ready, slime? It's showtimer It fails
to rise above the level of a rejected
storyline from Nightmare on Elm
Street:
Grant isn't helped either by DC's
usual trick of saddling British writers
with artists who haven't developed
beyond CSE grade one.
Avoid.
REVOLVER HORROR
Horror is the place where editors
let writers and artists experiment
these days so there's little in the way
of things that go bump in the night
here.
In the trade stakes, Nick (Hugo
Tate) Abadzis 'The Head', and Neil
(Sandman) Gaiman's 'Feeders and
Eaters' stand out. 'The Head' is
reminiscent of Poe and gives a
careful chill to the home as the mask
brought from foreign parts haunts
generations of a family. While
Gelman bumps into an old friend
who is being slowly eaten alive by
The Old Woman Who Lives Upstairs.
The frightening thing is it's presented
as autobiography. Neil Gelman either
has a strange imagination, or a few
strange friends. You decide.
The other stand out is Si
Spencer's 'First Blood' a tale of peer
pressure and a young girl's ﬁrst
period. It's handled sensitively, but
one can't help wondering why it's
included in a horror special.
Altogether,
the hits
outnumber the
misses, with only
a couple of
stories making
you regret the
South American
hardwoods that
might still stand if there had been a
few less pages.

THE MAGIC FLUTE #1 of

This is
adapted from
the opera by
Mozart, but
don't worry, you
don't need to
know the music
to get in the
swing, if you'll
pardon the pun.
Prince Tamini
is sent to rescue the daughter of the
Queen of the Night, Pamina, from the
evil Sarastro. On the way he
encounters the birdcatcher,
Papageno, and faces tests designed
to determine his spiritual purity. It's a
classical tale, and artist Russel has a
ﬁne sense of the magic and wonder
that is essential to any good fantasy,
placing it way above your average
Dungeon and Dragons scenario.

This is a real
stinker. After
welcoming
Ripley back to

setting up the
storyline in the
ﬁrst two
episodes with an ice cold chill that
did no disservice to those great
movies, Verheiden blows it with an
alien cast of thousands that
completely destroys credibility.
A real let down.

CURSE OF RA
RAINBOW ARTS -
E9.99 Tape,
£14.99 Disk
What's small, got
six legs and
moves blocks around with its
bottom? Puzzled? You will be
with this new think-em-up
from Rainbow Arts. Rik was
games around, and the logic
section adds a lot to the appeal of
the product. Everything is hinted with
an Egyptian feel and this increases
the presentation of the product. One
small moan though, the actual
gameplay graphics are far too messy,
and sometimes it is hard to
distinguish between the blocks and
the background, especially if your
brain in busy analysing the problem.
Ho well, it's not quite a Tetris or Klax,
but if you take your puzzling more
seriously then Curse Of Ra is the
only game that I'd recommend.
T
those who have been
lobotomised from the waist up,
is either puzzle games, or games
with bugs in them. Curse Of Ra is
original in the fact that it has both.
Giving it its dues though, it is also
very unlike most of the puzzle games
on the market.
Why? Well, the idea isn't TOO
original. You are a little bug who
must slide blocks around the screen
in order to match up two of the same
kind vertically or horizontally, and
they can be as far apart from each
other when you wipe them out as
you like. But you must have a block
that you can step onto afterwards
otherwise you are up the Nile withou
a eunuch. And when all the icon
blocks have been destroyed you
must end up on your starting block.
The reason why Curse Of Ra is
unlike, say Puzznic, is that you can
choose two different sorts of game,
and although the idea is still the
same, the techniques that you must
adopt in order to complete the
screens are radically different in
both.
For a start there is the arcade
game where you must race around
the screen, eliminating blocks at a
fair rate of knots, whilst the clock
, ticks away. if you stay on the block
that you've just wiped out you'll
'disappear into a vast chasm and
you'll lose one of your lives. The
puzzle element in this section is not
:too complex, some of the blocks are
-
, direction when you've stepped onto
and there are some blocks that
move by their own accord.
The logic section is for those that
are not quite so agile, but the brain
matter is going to be needed far
more. It also has the ice, but the
good thing is that each level has a
code word, so if you get pretty far
you can enter that word at the start
, and you'll be transported straight to
' that level.
Curse Of Ra is probably more
involved than most of the puzzle
ax
John Lennon
Beetles have six legs which
makes it ever so difﬁcult for
them to go ice skating. Not
Only do they have to spend
loads of dash on hiring three
pair of skates, but by the time
they've got them all tied up and
are raring to go, the rink has
closed down.
They are rather good at football
though.

DOMARK
E9.99 Tape,
E14.99 Disk
How come every
Domark game at the
moment has cars in
it? This makes it very hard to write
a decent intro. Rik tries his
hardest...
W
don't we? Well, the tin of
Spam doesn't 'cause he's
got ever such a bad memory, in fact
his memory only lasts about ten
seconds, so by the time I ﬁnish this
sentence he'll have forgotten that I
even asked him a question.
But getting back to the question,
we do! It was such a classic on every
other computer but our own, it's
about time somebody made up for
the amount of bugs, glitches, and
lack of speed by doing something
very similar that works. Domark took
the responsibility to do so by
acquiring the licence to Badlands,
the ofﬁcial sequel to Super Sprint,
and they've done a pretty ﬁne job of
converting it. The only problem is
that the gameplay seems a little dull
now.
The basic idea is this: You are the
driver of a battered old wreck (Mary
Whitehouse?) and you must race
against two other battered old
wrecks (Margaret Thatcher and
Edwina Currie?) or else the post
apocalyptic spectators may come
and help you towards an early grave.
If you do compete there's a very
good chance that you'll end up as
stiff as a baseball bat anyway, but at
least you've got a better chance
against two large pieces of metal
than against ﬁfty thousand muties
with halitosis and tour arms.
The action is seen from top-down
and you must guide your car around
the track, avoiding the pools of spilt
oil (blood?) and water, and even the
occasional time bomb. If you don't
come ﬁrst out of the three then
you're in trubb, and it's
goodbye to your head time, if
you do you'll get the chance
to compete in the next arena.
Fortunately between arenas
there is a shop that you can
exchange wrenches although
why somebody would want a
few bints who'll cater to their
every need (that's wenches,
not wrenches! - The
Readers)... Oh, anyway, if you
exchange three wrenches
you'll be able to get a wicked add-on
for your car (missiles, speed, better
tyres, etc.) all of which increase your
vehicle's ability.
Of course, if you want a better
chance of winning, you can invite a
friend to take over one of the other
cars, and therefore you only need to
beat one drone car in order to
qualify. There are eight tracks in all,
although if you complete them they'll
wrap round with even more hazards
and munchy things to avoid.
Badlands, a year ago, would have
been a truly great game, but the
theme has now been done to death
and there isn't enough variation in
the gameplay to compete against
other, much more involved arcade
conversions. It is the best Super
Sprint game
though, and if
you're into
them then
you'd could do,
and would do,
a lot worse.
Me? b e

conversion of

This month we - that
is, I - have a veerry
special treat for ?
y dear readers -
that is, you.
Remember the
very wonderful
Bard's Tale role-playing
game? Well, Bard's Tale 1
and 2 were
written by a gentleman by
the name of Michael
Cranford for
Interplay in the States.
Something happened. Our
Michael was
either kidnapped by alien
starﬁsh from the planet
Iveneverseenthiswomen
inmylifeyourhonour, o r  he
fell asleep in his
cornﬂakes and lapsed into
a coma or, and most
probably, he did
none of these things.
Whatever, he disappeared.
Blow me down with
a 25 ton steel girder but
doesn't he appear, running
and screaming, shouting
"hahahahahahaha", and
clutching a copy of The
Centauri Alliance, from
Broderbund in the States?
Well, I managed to
tackle Michael, ripped the
game from his
hands and hot-footed it
back to the Ye ofﬁces to give you
an
exclusive - sorry I'll repeat that -
EXCLUSIVE!!! review of this
RPG. Now, as Domark are the
exclusive entertainment software
distributors for Broderbund you
would assume that they would
bring the game over here - or then
again, they might not. Depends
how they're feeling, I suppose.
Okay, a bit of plot background is
Ego
called for here, I reckon
(Cue galactic Star Wars-type
sounds from the Berlin
Philharmonic
Orchestra).
It was when two other lifeforms
were discovered on Alpha
Centauri by a team from Earth that
the Alliance was initiated.
Technology was shared, ideas
passed around, other alien races
discovered. During AD 2214 six
races ofﬁcially formed the
Centauri Alliance. Although a wish
for peace predominated chaos
still reigned throughout the galaxy.
Now it appears that an
unfriendly lot, calling themselves
DAYNAB, are searching for the
"ultimate weapon", the Fractyr
Fist. This nasty piece of work is
spread across the galaxy in its
basic components. The aim of the
game, therefore, is to retrieve
the bits of the Fist before the
agents of DAYNAB do. If DAYNAB
succeed...
Coming on three
disks, two manuals, a
map and reference
cards and adopting a
familiar ''Bard's Tale"
look, The Centauri
Alliance (ICA) employs a
multi-window play-
screen. Top centre is
the window onto the
game-world. A ﬁrst
person perspective
viewpoint that scrolls in
a similar manner to
Bard's Tale. To the
right of that is a list of
your party of six
characters (NPCs can
be recruited too). Each
character can be one of
six races, each
with their own abilities
(eg: technical and
psionic) plus a set
of six stats: strength,
vitality, agility, IQ, life
and psionic.
Psionics is mental
energy that replaces
magic seen in Bard's
Tale. It is handled in a
similar way, though. You
"cast" a
psionic ability as you
would a spell. So you
can create creatures
to ﬁght for you, cause earthquakes,
detect the presence of
radiation and so on.
An excellent aspect of each
character's make-up (no, not
lippy) is the Skill option. Each
character is rated (0-10) for
four basic disciplines: Combat,
Tech, Psionics and Metamorph.
Within each discipline are one to
four skills. So the Combat

discipline contains melee (close
quarters), thrown (hurling
knives and explosives), sidearm and
master (an extension of the
other three). Inc idently, metamorph
is the intriguing description
of being able to change a
character's physical shape into one
of
several lifeforms.
Obviously, if certain problems
require a certain skill
you'll pick the most proﬁcient
character to complete it. So, for
example, if you need to repair a
mechanold robot you'll choose
the guy with a high "hardware" skill
(found in the Tech
discipline).
Items are plentiful. Weapons
range from the ubiquitous
dagger to shurikens, LIZIs, photon
blasters, poison-tipped celery
sticks, ﬁrst-class stamps with a
superglue coating on the back
(get your tongue around that one!)
and lots of other bits. Armour
ranges from combat and duro-fabric
to kevlar nappies and re-
enforced upper-lip protectors (ok,
ok - not all of those items
are included). There are umpteen
artifacts to be found in the
game, too.
But back to the game-screen
description. To the top-left of
the screen is a window containing
menu choices and long-lasting
psionic abilities (eg: light creation).
The large window on the
lower half of the screen displays
text messages.
The game area consists of eleven
worlds, each with their own
characteristics. Each world is
arranged in a similar way to
Bard's Tale, ie: on a square grid
maze system. You will need to
travel between worlds to complete a
variety of missions that must
be solved before the ﬁnal mission of
ﬁnding the Fist is
attempted.
As you might of guessed. If you
enjoyed Bard's Tale you'll
love Centauri Alliance. However, if
you didn't then...er, you
won't. The graphics are quite nice, if
a little repetitive in
certain areas. Spot animation is
plentiful, though. Sound is
minimal.
The actual RPG system is not
exactly ground breaking but it
does vastly improve on the Bard's
Tale series with the addition
of skills and the unique combat
interface. When this occurs you
are transported over to a combat
screen depicting a bunch of
enlarged hexes. Standing on the
hexes are your party and the
enemy (each party is portrayed as
one character). This hex-view
gives you a chance to contemplate
tactical manoeuvres and the
like.
The bottom line? A good solid
RPG with lots and lots of
gameplay that'll be enjoyed by any
RPG player but is a "must buy"
for Bard's Tale fans.

E19.99 DISK
BAT (The Bureau of Astral
Troubleshooters) is a RPG
from French software house,
Ubisoft. You play an agent of
BAT, on the
trail of the dastardly Vrangor
and his accomplice, Josue
Munewski.
BAT is joystick controlled, using
icons and menus for menu
choices. Competentaces and skills
form the meat of your
character's development. However,
these categories (evaluate,
vigilance, etc) are rather too subtle
and advanced to be noticed
in the rather simple game design that
BAT has.
There is a variety of equipment
that you can utilise on your
travels. For example there is the
Voktrasor, a light weapon the
size of a pen that can be easily
hidden and the Hacker 30 -
described as a "butcher's weapon".
No surprise really, as this
nasty piece of work projects several
thousand needles!
When combat occurs the screen
changes to a full-screen image
of your opponent. The game allows
you to arm yourself and trigger
your magnetic ﬁeld protection. After
which, you move the cursor
over the opponent and click on the
mouse button like crazy.
One major criticism is that there is
far too much eating and
drinking! It seems that, every ﬁve
seconds, your character
complains "I'm hungry/thirsty".
Which interrupts play too
frequently.
I also became confused with the
method of moving from one
location to another. Each location
takes the form of one full-
screen graphic. When you wish to
move to another location you
move the cursor around the screen
edge until it changes into an
arrow. Click and a new graphic
location appears. I was never
aware of moving east, west, etc.

Consequently, I often found
myself moving to the wrong
area, moving back to the
original
screen and then selecting
the correct direction. A bore
on the
064 as the graphic screens
take time to load from disk.
I would
have much preferred some
sort of compass rosette as
a
replacement. Then, at least I would
have some idea as to what
direction I was travelling in!
Graphics are well presented and
the background music is
pretty good on the C64. Spot effects
are minimal, though.

BUCK ROGERS
VOL.1 -

PRODUCER -
PRICE -  E24.99 DISK
Basically the plot to Buck Rogers
surrounds the RAM (Russo-
American Mercantile) organization
based on Mars. They want to
control the Solar System,
your task is to stop them by
leading
the NE0 (New Earth
Organization)
Using an uprated AD&D
system Buck Rogers
displays many
improvements. The complex
skill system being the most
inﬂuential.
Attributes hold one
surprise. "Tech" measures a
character's
technical knowhow. Character
classes, as in the fantasy genre,
may only have certain careers. The
available careers are
interesting and varied. Rocketjocks
and engineers mix with rogues
and warriors.
It is the skill system that provides
the heart to the game
and the qualiﬁcation for each career,
via minimum skill values.
Rocketjocks can, for example, pilot a
ﬁxed wing, a rocket, etc.
General skills are also included. They
are listed as 'extra
curricular' in the manual. During
character creation and level
increases you are able to allocate
points to any skill you have.
Skills have a direct inﬂuence in the
game. Leadership skills may
attract NPCs into the party during
combat sequences, for example.
Combat uses the usual raised-
side-view - ideal for tactical
play. Combat is divided into
'segments'. Each segment includes a
detailed array of variables such as
performance in zero-g
manoeuvering, tactics, initiative and
so on. Terrain can be used
during tactical play which aids the
tactical realism.
Space combat is also available
and includes boarding and
salvage as options. Many of the
menu options are similar in their
effects to the AD&D menu
system, with modiﬁcations such
as a
bar/restaurant instead of the
tavern, for example. Extra
facilities such as using the library
skill to ﬁnd info
is integrated well.
The skill system integrates
smoothly into the high-tec SF
ripoeiects

atmosphere giving a lot more depth
to gameplay. Each of your
characters appear more as
'individuals' rather than just an
assortment of a few re-rolled stats
such as charisma and
strength.
As time is passing we are seeing
RPGs separate into many
sub-groups, none of which should be
directly compared to each
other as they all occupy their own
little niches and strive for
different objectives. Some RPGs are
pure hack'n slash (Bard's
Tale) while others rely on interaction
to succeed (the later
Ultimas). Buck Rogers depends on
tactical combat to win the game.
As such, the combat is excellent
and will be enjoyed by
tacticians everywhere. Also because
of the large amount of detail
provided for each character (both in
normal play and during
combat) the game quickly becomes
absorbing and addictive.
Consequently, Buck Rogers is the
ﬁnest "tactical" RPG on th
market.

ADVENTURE
MAG ROUND-
UP PT.3
Up in the nether regions of Bonnie
Scotland - Glenrothes,
Fife to be exact, is a helpful chappie by
the name of Mike
"Bonnie" Brailsford. S0000 helpful is our
Bonnie Mike that he
edits a bonnie mag called Spellbreaker.
Soo° wonderful is
Spellbreaker that I must insist that you
buy a copy. In fact buy
three - one to carry around in your jacket,
nail one to the loo
door to read during times of
contemplation and another to the
chimney stack if ever you ﬁnd yourself
ﬁxing the roof and
suddenly ﬁnd that you've forgot to bring
your jacket. Happens to
me all the time.
Spellbreaker is jam packed with hints,
tips, solutions-Und
maps for just about every adventure
under the sun, under the bed
and under the arches. Oh - and then
there's lots of Bonnie
Brailsford too, plus letters, the odd
(literally) story and
features. Value for money or what?!? Mike
also offers a solution
service in which, for a nominal fee, you
can request a whole host
of adventure solutions and maps.
Spellbreaker (an A5 size mag including
around 40 pages - if
you count the cover) can be purchased
for a pifﬂing E1.50. If
you would like a subscription just multiply
that by 12. European
readers should pay E2.00 per issue as
should the rest of the
world using surface mail. Air Mail (rest of

Something incredibly cute is
coming your way...
W
preview. here's the review.
Creatures are still incredibly
cute. What's more they are very
cuddly, very colourful and very likely
to be very dead if you don't rescue
them very fast!
You are a born hero...after all,
every other creature is happy eating
the nourishing (yet rather boring)
plant life that grows near to the
village. After years of dull weeds for
tea (Rik knows about that...), you
decided to go adventuring to ﬁnd a
yummy basketful of tuck.However,
on your return with the berries that
Mother Nature was so kind to
supply you with, you ﬁnd to your
horror that the village is deserted!
What's more, there are huge
footprints leading (gasp!) into the
scary side of your (supposedly
deserted) island!
Pausing only to swill down the
tasty berries to get your energy up,
you grasp the challenge ﬁrmly by
the horns. Taking the advantage of
its eyes watering somewhat you
follow the footprints...
Anyone who has ever played a
platform game (and that's about
999 in 1000 of you) will take to
Creatures immediately. It's almost
sickeningly cute, incredibly
colourful and frantic, with loads of
great sprites, dinky tunes and
parallax scrolling. Despite your
cutesy appearance you can pack a
punch - or rather a laser beam -
and your supply of magic can be
upgraded as you progress in the
game.
Throughout the game are
various little buddies of yours that
the Demons who have kidnapped
the villagers left behind. Collect
enough ofthese fuzzy suckers and
you can spend them at the witch's
shop for extra weapons. Unlike your
own weedy magic these new spells
can be used to create curving
weapons, rapid ﬁring or long range
ones. If in a tight corner you can
use one of your limited
ﬂamethrowers to great effect!
Your energy is depleted on
contact with one of the nasty

creatures that inhabit the
horrible side of the island.
They come in all shapes
and forms and although
they are the enemy the
Demon's servants really
are cute to look at. They
are just as colourful and
wriggly as you are and it is
a shame to despatch them
However, fail to do this
and you could end up with
a sore tummy from lackof
food - as they take no
greater pleasure than
sapping the very strength
from your bones. Contact with them
is almost always fatal so avoid
them if at all possible. If it isn't
possible to avoid them then blast
them into little bits with your magic
weapon!!
Win through enough of the level
and you can meet the nasty little
Demon at the end. They are always
nasty but this one is nastier than
most. He has set up a torture for
one of your furry chums! These
tortures vary from level to level but
the basic idea is to think your way
to your pal's rescue and utilise the
objects around you to free him.
Fail and painful death for the
poor mite is always the result!
However, success is rewarded with
the creature's escape and the
vanquish of yet another
Demon. Can you win
through all ﬁve levels and
destroy the REALLY
nasty guy at the end of
the game?
Question is, will you
really want to? Happily
the answer is yes.
Creatures really is cute
and the gameplay lives
up to the great graphics,
with a maddeningly
addictive element that'll have
you coming back to the
keyboard time and time again.
One to look Out for, but don't look
under the bed after you switch off

Beat-em-ups come and
Beat-em-up go, and
some give you a good
hard kick in the goolies.
Sean Kelly ﬁnds out
which ones do what
I
it, but since just about the
beginning of time, man has used
ﬁsticuffs to sort out any dispute or
argument that he might be involved
in. It's not suprising really. It's faster
and more conclusive than suing
someone, and it gets rid of all that
pent up frustration. After all, straight
after someone has just put you
down in front of your mates there's
nothing worse than being stuck for
suitable reply, and more often than
not a quick boot in the gonads
serves just as admirably as a witty
retort worthy of Oscar Wilde.
Of course, the human obsession
with 'Iamping' anyone and everyone
who gets in someones way for fun
and sport hasn't been lost on the
People Who Make Computer
Games. So much so, in fact, that
today you can't so much as
announce a new computer or
console without learning that
System 3 are doing a version of 'The
Last Ninja' for it. But more on that
later. For the kick off (kick off-
geddit? Please yourself missus), let's
go back through the mists of time, to
where it all
began...
The ﬁrst major beat 'em up, of
course, was The Way of the
Exploding Fist', released by
Melbourne House when they weren't
one of Virgin Mastertronics
subsiduary labels. This caused what
is known as 'a bit of a storm' when it
ﬁrst appeared. It spawned hundreds
of imitators, some good, some bad,
and most appalling. What it also did
was provide computer gaming with
one of the most enduring of genres.
Here we present some of the
landmarks in the history of beat 'em
ups. Some are absolute show
stoppers, some will keep you
araldited to your computer for ages,
and none of them are crap.
As with the shoot 'em up feature
in the last ish. we've judged the
beaties with a special set of
markers. The ﬁrst is graphics, which
is fairly obvious. If it looks totally
funky and colourful, it hits the high
marks. If it looks like a Stone Roses
single cover, it's pushing the lower
limits. The second category is
sonics, which encompasses both
tunes and noises. If it sounds
atmospheric, and a well landed
punch sounds like something out of
Miami Vice, it's a biggie. If it
sounds like a Sonya and Big Fun
record, forget it. The third marking
category is 'brains'. Let me explain
the last one.
On some beat 'em ups, you
have to draw on massive brain
reserves to remember all thirty
seven thousand moves and the
sequence of eighteen joystick
manoevres to carry out just one,
whilst in others the most taxing
decision you have to make is
wether to kick your opponent in the
nuts or punch him in the face.
Either type of game can be
rewarding in their own way, so the
brain factor isn't an indication of
the games quality, but should
give you some indication of
whether you should bring your
brain along, or wether you should
leave it under the bed. The last of
the four marks is the overall marks,
which will tell you just how good
this particular ninjing wonder found
the game.
All clear? Good. Fists at the
ready, let the punching begin.
The Way of the
Exploding Fist.
The granddaddy of them all. First
released in 1805 or thereabouts, it's
an absolute classic. The idea of the
vi
"tor
game is simply to kick the living
daylights out of your opponent as
fast as possible. A number of moves
are available, and there's nothing
more satisfying than doing a quick
spin before landing your opponent
one on the side of his head and
watching him go crashing to the
ﬂoor. Way of the Exploding Fist also
gets a special mention for the fact
that singular sadists can set
the game on two player mode,
and kick the literally stationary
opponent to oblivion. Yuk YukI
This one's still got something
special after all those years, and is
still a playable little epic by anyone's
standards. There's quite a few
joystick manouvres to get to grips
with, but once you have them
sussed, Fist becomes an eminently
playable and addictive game.
Graphics are a tad ropey by todays
standards, but don't let that put you
off. It's a classic, and deservedly so.

F I S T S  O U T

Fist II
Not suprisingly, this one is the
sequel to TWOTEF I, and came
out quite a few years later. This
one takes the basic premise of
the ﬁrst game, but throws in a
massive arcade adventure as
well. You are descended from a
grand master, and have been
entrusted with defeating the evil
warlord by travelling all over the
shop, ﬁnding magical scrolls and
temple because... erm... well,
because.
This one isn't as good as it's
predecessor, but then there's
very few games that are. It's
playable, that's for sure, and the
music lends atmosphere to the
game. But, perhaps because the
playing area is so enormous, the
graphics are, apart from the
main sprites, pretty bland
throughout. The arcade
adventure element does
enhance the game though, and
mapping freaks could be playing
this game for eons.

Bushido:The
Way of the
Warrior
This one is a Microprose game
programmed at Graftgold by a team
including Steve Turner, in which the
main aim is to inﬁltrate a castle in
which the enemy of the leader of
your clan has entrenched himself,
and regain control. Dead easy or
what? The player can chose who he
sends into the castle to carry out his
aims, from the megastealthy Ninja to
Monks and Yambushis, or Mountain
Warriors, the
type of bloke who wrestles Tigers
and farts in bears faces for a laugh.
In addition to the ninjing and
ﬁghting, there's tons of stuff to
collect and use, and it all goes to
make this one massively huge and
sophisticated game.
The game is played in a self
mapping isometric castle of sorts,
and although the actual beat 'em up
element isn't exactly the most
sophisticated, the gameplay
exciting and good fun. The graphics
are good, and its obvious that a lot
of effort and thought have gone into
making sure it looks and 'feels'
good. As a consequence it has the
look of one of those pet projects
that someone develops themselves
and then places with a software
house once its just about ﬁnished.
Unusual, but a game that you will
keep on going back to to check out
what's round the next corner.

International Karate with a '+'
sign, along with some pretty good
improvements. I must admit that this
game from Sytem 3 is probably my
favourite beat 'em up of all time on
the Commodore 64. On it's basic
level it's quite simply a Fist variant
with various international
backdrops. Beyond that, though, it's
quite simply a highly polished and
addictive game.
The joystick commands are
straightforward and fairly easy to
learn, so you'll soon be bashing
away with style and ﬁnesse. Unlike
some beat 'em ups, there is also the
challenge of opponents who get
progressively more difﬁcult to beat,
and some thought has to go into

Bruce Lee
Based on the original and best of
the cinemas Kung Fu crowd, this
early C64 game featured a tiny sprite
that you are meant to think looks like
our hero. It doesn't, but that doesn't
stop this game from being a bit of a
corker. The aim of the game is to
collect all the lanterns in a room
before you will be allowed to
progress to the next
room. You will be attacked by
Ninjas and even nastier Green Yamo
as you attempt to do this, b u t are
able to leap around from ledge to
ledge and climb vines and ladders in
order to acheive your aims.
This game we ﬁrst released in
1984, and boy does it look it's age. It
even loads up with the American
National Anthem playing. Ptui.
Although the game looks horrible,
the sound isn't too bad, and it still
plays pretty well considering it's age.
As, far as I'm aware, it's only
available on a fab compilation called
'Karate Ace', but it's still worth
hunting out if you can ﬁnd a copy.
Dead old, but dead playable and
dead addictive.

Kung Fu Master
A basic scrolling beat 'em up, in
which the aim is to use your ninjing
skills to work your way to the ﬁfth
ﬂoor of the temple of the Wizard, in
order to rescue the beautiful maiden
he's holding captive. That's about it
as far as scenario goes for this one.
I might be wrong, and ﬂog me
with a wet codpiece dipped in
custard if I am, but I think this one
was based on an arcade game. One
thing's for certain, it plays like one.
The player has to work his way along
through each ﬂoor of the temple, and
on each he's assaulted by various
beasties and enemies. The moves
aren't sophisticated by any stretch,
but it's good fun, and has tons and
tons of 'just one more go'-ness
about it. Fab gear, and no messing.

The Way of the
Tiger
Why do most beat 'em ups have
to have the words 'the way ()L.'
thrown in somewhere, that's what I
want to know. This Gremlin epic sold
by the proverbial pigload when it ﬁrst
appeared. The scenario is the usual
stuff about defeating the bad guy
who's done your grand master wrong
and so on. What's different is that
Tiger involves three different
disciplines. namely Unarmed
combat, Pole ﬁghting and Samurai
Sword Fighting.
This is like a three game
compilation in itself really, as each
discipline has it's own individual and
distinct graphic and sonic style. The
pole ﬁghting is my particular
favourite, although each is more than
good enough. The programming is
very polished, and the tunes are tab.
It's out on the Kixx label for three
quid, and a bit of billy bargain it is
too.

Punch Line: A trio of

Ninja Remix
When System 3's 'The Last Ninja'
ﬁrst appeared on the C64, it was
astounding. It was like the beat 'em
ups of old, but done in full colour
isometric projection 3D. The aim was
to ninj your way around huge playing
areas for some reason that excapes
me at the moment, but that was
hardly the most important point
anyhow. Both games had massive
playing areas, brilliantly drawn and
animated sprites and
backdrops, and some of the best
music you'll ever hear on a C64.
The Ninja Remix features chunks
of both games, polished up and
bunged together for todays
audience. But, it's not released yet.
So, let's phone those nice people at
System 3 and ﬁnd out all about it.
Dial, dial...ring ring.... 'Hello. System
3 aren't at home at the moment, but
if you'd like to leave a message after
the tone....0h, and by the way, Ninja
Remix is going to be totally fab and

sponditious, combining all the best
bits of the ﬁrst two games into truly
funky gaming experience, we ll worth
the spondoolies any time.' Oh. That's
alright then.
Punch Line: If it's as
good as it's two
predecessors, it'll be a bit
of a classic.
Five People who would probably enjoy a
good beat em up.
1. Bruce Lee
A bit of a lad, or Bruce, and given to
curling his instep round a bad guys
cranium without so much as a by your
leave whenever the mood took him. It's
also rumoured that Bruce used to hang
around Scunthorpe Pier during the
summer season threatening to 'give a
good tonking' to anyone who even
glanced in his direction. This rumour is
not true.
2. James Bond
Famous spy and secret agent, who
probably knows seventeen thousand
ways to kill a man with his toenail
clippings. (His own, that is, not the
person he was killing. I mean, can you
imagine: 'I'm going to kill you now Mr.
Jaws, but before I do, would you mind
clipping your toenails...)
3. Frank Bruno
Well known English pugilist, famous for
his catch phrase Pass the sauce, Harry.'
4. Albert Einstein
Respected scientist and physicist. What
is not generally known is that he got his
theory of relativity accepted by the
scientiﬁc community by threatening to
'come round with the lads and give a
seeing to' to any member of the scientiﬁc
community questioning his assertions.
5. Sylvester
Stallone
Highly regarded art expert and

portrayals of shrinking violets such
as Rocky, Rambo and.... oh. That's

_Well, you can always
dream, eh readers? (Only
ioking, Rik!) The closest to
that I've ever got was at
the headquarters of one of
North London's newest
(and possibly most
militaristic and gratuitous)
pastimes - "Quasar - the
live action space game".
Foolishly, and many
moons ago, a team of four
(now mostly ex-) YC staff -
Rik Henderson (the Big Ed), Mark
Newton (designer), Ashley Cotter-
Cairns (contributor) and Manni Cesai
(ex-photographer) - had challenged
the "Rest of the World" - myself, so-
called 'contributor', Duncan Evans,
Hew Pryce, Marcus Bamford, and a
Girlie called Michelle. They paid for
their arrogance!
Quasar originated in Australia
and New Zealand. I t  expanded half
way around the world to Turnpike
Lane, North London, where it opened
L A S E R - L I G H T  F A N T A S T I C
in June last year. Since then it has
gained 11,000 members with loads
of potential space-warriors ﬂocking
to its converted cinema premises
every day.
A new "franchise" (like a branch)
has recently opened in Dublin with a
wide futuristic
-
LIVE  ACTION SPACE GAME
plaza layout and
improved (more
accurate)
weapons and
weapon packs
(they talk and
give a kick when
you get hit).
There are
currently plans
to open two
more Quasar
Centres, in
Romford and
Manchester.
Games last
thirty minutes
and up to twenty
people (on two - Red and Green -
teams of ten) can scamper around
the split-level arena. Each player has
three "lives", displayed as red lights
on their front-mounted pack.
If they're shot, the lights ﬂash and
one goes out. Lose all three and
they're DEAD. Well, alright then,
more sort-of suspended animation
a small rejuvenating booth has to be
visited to restore the life-lights before
going back to the game.
The guns themselves come in
two different varieties. There is the
standard type which glows red at the

end (which makes it a target - people
can shoot that, causing the fun's
owner to lose a life) and has a (ever-
so-slightly inaccurate) range of 30
feet and the new "boomer" requires
more accuracy but doesn't glow -
this can be quite advantageous.
Players don't just 'waste' people,
there's a system of (personal) scoring
- 100 per hit on an opponent, 500 on
the enemy team's HQ (which lets out
a siren sound when being shot),
minus 30 if they're shot and minus 30
if they shoot a member of their own
team. Up at the end of the hall is a
large scoreboard which keeps track
of team scores - this is the telling
point at the end of the game, as the
YC lot found to their cost!
...The game began and the two
teams slid silently into the dark,
smoke-ﬁlled arena -Rushing to ﬁnd
vantage points from which to snipe at
the opposition. Swirling lights pick
out scampering ﬁgures, the ﬂow of
life-lights red against the near-
impenetrable black, misty
atmosphere.
Soon the sound of loosed laser-
light wafted across the battleground,
mixed with the thudding of feet, the
waiting of the threatened Has and
the abusive shouting as someone
was caught and 'taken out' by a
swift-moving foot soldier.
Many people were caught in
impossible impasse situations. Rik
Henderson, for instance, crouched
behind a wooden wall, taking wild
pot-shots at anything that moved,
trapping people nearby. Alternatively,
the problem of just knowing that
somebody is at the top of a ﬂight of
stairs waiting for an unwary player.
For thirty minutes, the two groups
waged violent, competitive war on
each other until
"I got completely smegged"
remarked your editor and mine Rik
Henderson, emerging from a
crushing defeat. "We wuz robbed"
cried the VC team. They wanted the
opportunity to grab opponents and
hold them down whilst shooting
them, with the option to garotte
the opposition with their gun's
wires - you trust these people
tho edit VC?
The result was a decisive 142
to 98 point victory for the "Rest
of the World". Ha! Victory was
ours!

been released on the commie

doing the rounds when it comes to
compilations. This is a shame
because the game, on the C64, is a
pile of doggy poop and no mistake.
Rumour has it that the ﬁnal
product was ported straight across
from the Speccy but I don't believe it
for a moment. For a start the Speccy
version was a darn sight better than
this (in fact I would add that it was
the best version of all). The graphics
are jerky (even more jerky than the
nerd section in your school canteen),
the sound is appalling (do dogs often
wheeze like that?) and the gameplay
is so mind numbingly crap that it
would be very hard to liken this
version to the arcade 'mother' is any
respect whatsoever. Add to this the
fact that the opposing cars seem to
'hone' in on you whilst your
peacefully keeping to the correct
side of the road and you have a

And Chase HO is nigh on as naff.

technological time And if you
requested a look inside
contributory to its games' success.
In fact it is this innovativeness
that caused the lads to be expelled
from the PC Show in a very famous
incident. In order to promote the
game 'Twister - Mother of Harlots'
(later changed to 'Twister - Mother
of Charlotte') Mark
System 3, possibly the
country's top C64 publishing
house, lies in the heart of
Pinner, hardly the cultural
paradise of the world. Rik
hikes his way to meet the
team behind the best, and
most well known, trilogy ever,
the Last Ninja saga...
I
one of the most proliﬁc companies
in software releases, indeed,
although the company has been in
existence for nigh-on eight years,
only 16 commie 64 games will have
been released by the end of this year,
a mere 2 a year on average. But you
look at the track record, in fact only a
couple of those games would fare
the System 3 big cabinet
of trophies you'd be
forgiven for thinking that
you're inside Liverpool's
show room instead.
There is hardly a
product in System 3's
range that has gone
without at least one
gold plated accolade
But even if the
products take years
in development it
doesn't guarantee
that they're going to
be the cats gooleys. that is not the be
all and end all of it. System 3 takes
great pride in the fact that its
products are innovative in every
respect. The packaging, the
marketing, and the PR stunts are all
hired a group
of scantily clad females to dance
in 'Pans People' style. Some of
the show's bigwigs though took
offence to the fact that the girls
wore little more than strips
of leather, and thus the stand
was closed down and System 3
was expelled from the rest of the
show.
But the effect that this
controversial event had on the
industry was that every distributor
and magazine were dying to get
their grubby mitts on a copy of the
game. And this only helped the
name of the company grow, so
that by the time of the next
release everybody was waiting
with more than eager anticipation.
And this release was also to
change not just the growing company
in Pinner, but the entire industry, for
this release was the ﬁrst of possibly
the most famous game series ever,
The Last Ninja
This was brought about mainly
due to the fact that beat-em-ups

a passing
interest in

(ﬁlms

deemed to release
lme that could capitalise
,uch a market. But System 3
ted something a tad different
the norm, and besides the
pany had earlier released
,
Last Ninja was developed much
same as a ﬁlm might be, with a
mplex plot, a storyboard and a
ﬁnite plan of locations. And also
opting an idea popular of the

a masterpiece.

Twiddy, a

that time) by
which other
pieces of
software are
still compared.
The game
was such a success,
and won so many awards,
that System 3 was later (after
the release of another
milestone in its genre,
International Karate +) to
update the theme, and
release the ﬁrst ever sequel
of an original game. And it
oven surpassed the original
in the praise that was
rained upon it. The Cales
also exceeded themselves
on the packaging front by
repackaging it, in order to
give the game a new lease
of shelf life, with a map, a
new booklet, a rubber
shuriken and a ninja mask
e all included in the limited
edition box.
But during this time there was
also a rift forming between System 3
and the company marketing all of its
product, Activision. And this was
stressed by the release of
Dominator, a game that the
Cates would rather
have just
scrapped
due to the
fact that it was
a stock shoot-
em-up, and not
in any way typical
of a System 3
game.
Fortunately
Tusker managed to
claw back some
waining credibility, and
Myth managed to secure
that System 3 was once
more one of the top C64
publishing houses in this
country. In fact Myth had
such an in depth plot, a movie
" synopsis has been drawn up and is
currently being touted around the
movie moguls. And the Activision
deal was to end with the release of
Vendetta, which essentially reworked
the Ninja formula, and added the
extra element of a driving game.
So the company ﬁnally went its
own way and with the release of
Flimbo's Quest (now in the C64GS
package as
one of
the
introductory
games), it showed that business was
as usual.
And as Adrian states, "System 3

A

has a license in itself, in the form of
the Ninja series", and we are once
again to be treated to doses of the
formula, although things have been
much updated. The company even
feels that its Last Ninja 2 is outdated,
so much so that we now see the
release of Ninja Remix, a reworked
version of the previous game. This is
essentially, though, a taster for Last
Ninja 3, by far the most impressive of
the trilogy, and a real contender (at
this early stage) as the best commie
64 game EVER.
So System 3 still grows
(especially with the announcement
that it'll be supporting the C64GS),
and the games are still way ahead of
their time, and if this continues for
EVERY SYSTEM
