Introduction
Y

ou’ve been thinking about starting your own business for a while now. 
You’ve heard about the woman whose Julie/Julia Project blog was 
turned into a book and a popular movie. You’ve heard about young entrepre­
neurs who’ve made billions creating popular websites such as Facebook. But 
you’ve been slow to jump on the bandwagon. You’re a busy person, after all. 
You have a full-time job, whether it’s running your home or working outside 
your home. Or perhaps you’ve been laid off or are going through some other 
life-changing event and are ready to take off in a new direction, but the eco­
nomic upheavals of recent years leave you understandably reluctant to make 
a big career change.
Well, I have news for you: Now is the perfect time to turn your dream into 
reality by starting your own online business. More individuals than ever 
before — regular folks just like you — are making money and enriching their 
lives by operating businesses online. The clock and your location are no 
longer limiting factors. Small business owners can now work any time of the 
night or day in their spare bedrooms, local libraries, or neighborhood coffee 
shops.
If you like the idea of being in business for yourself but don’t have a particu­
lar product or service in mind, relax and keep yourself open to inspiration. 
Many different kinds of commercial enterprises can hit it big on the Internet. 
Among the entrepreneurs I interviewed for this book are a woman who sells 
her own insect repellent, a husband and wife who sell items from their native 
Europe, a woman who provides office services for the medical community, a 
housewife who sells sweetener and coffee on eBay, a sculptor and painter, a 
young man who started selling electronics online at age 16, and several folks 
who create web pages for other businesses. With the help of this book, you 
can start a new endeavor and be in charge of your own cyberbusiness, too.
You Can Do It!
What’s that? You say you wouldn’t know a merchant account, a profit and 
loss statement, or a clickthrough advertising rate if it came up to you on the 
street and introduced itself? Don’t worry: The Internet (and this book) levels 
the playing field so that a novice has just as good a chance at succeeding as 
MBAs who love to throw around business terms at cocktail parties.

Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 7th Edition 
The Internet is a pervasive and everyday part of the business landscape 
these days. Whether you’ve been in business for 20 years or 20 minutes, the 
keys to success are the same:
	
✓	Having a good idea: If you have something to sell that people have an 
appetite for, and if your competition is slim, you have a strong chance of 
being successful.
	
✓	Working hard: When you’re your own boss, you can make yourself work 
harder than any of your former bosses ever could. If you put in the effort 
and persist through the inevitable ups and downs, you’ll be a winner.
	
✓	Believing in yourself: One of the most surprising and useful things I 
discovered from the online businesspeople I interviewed was that if you 
believe that you’ll succeed, you probably will. Believe in yourself and 
proceed as though you’ll be successful. Together with your good ideas 
and hard work, your confidence will pay off.
If you’re the cautious type who wants to test the waters before you launch 
your new business on the Internet, let this book lead you gently up the learn­
ing curve. After you’re online, you can master techniques to improve your 
presence. This book includes helpful hints for doing market research and 
reworking your website to achieve success.
Jump In, the Water’s Fine
When I first started revising this new edition in early 2013, I was not sur­
prised to find that many businesses had rebounded five years after the seri­
ous economic crash. I was surprised to find that so many new ways of doing 
business had either appeared or become commonplace (mobile shopping 
and Facebook stores, for example). It turns out that any time is a good time to 
start an online business as long as you have a good idea and a smart business 
plan.
New resources, many of which didn’t exist when I wrote the previous edition, 
present entrepreneurs with opportunities to market themselves and their 
products and services. Tablets make selling easier than ever, and smart­
phones make mobile shopping an everyday occurrence. Standards such 
as Pinterest, Fulfillment By Amazon, and Square Payments were either just 
emerging or hadn’t yet come to fruition only a few years ago. Well-known 
marketplaces such as eBay give businesspeople a solid foundation on which 
to start a new business. Other well-known web-based service providers 
such as Yahoo!, PayPal, and Amazon.com give you a way to reach millions 
of potential customers. Bloggers are an everyday part of the cyberspace

landscape, and some are making a regular source of income from their online 
diaries. Google and Yahoo! are making it easier than ever to gain advertising 
revenue.
As the web becomes more of a way of life and broadband Internet connec­
tions become widespread around the world, doing business online isn’t con­
sidered unusual anymore. Still, you may have reasonable concerns about the 
future of e-commerce and for the entrepreneurs this book seeks to help — 
individuals who are starting their first businesses on the web. Your fears will 
quickly evaporate when you read this book’s case studies of my friends and 
colleagues who conduct business online. They’re either thriving or at least 
keeping their heads above water, and they enthusiastically encourage others 
to jump right in.
Where This Book Is Coming From
Online business isn’t just for large corporations, or even just for small busi­
nesses that already have a storefront in the real world and simply want to 
supplement their marketability with a website.
The Internet is a perfect venue for individuals who are comfortable using 
computers, and who want to start their own business and believe that cyber­
space is the place to do it. You don’t need much money to get started. If you 
already have a computer as well as an Internet connection and can create 
your own web pages (something this book helps you with), making the move 
to your own business website may cost only $100 or less. After you’re online, 
the overhead is pretty reasonable, too: You may pay only $10 to $75 per 
month to a web hosting service to keep your site online — or pay nothing, if 
you sign up with one of the specialty marketplaces that give you a platform 
for creating web pages and selling products, and charge a fee only if you 
make a sale.
With each month that goes by, the number of Internet users increases expo­
nentially. The growth is greatest outside the United States. To be precise, in 
summer 2012, Internet World Stats released data indicating that the number 
of Internet users worldwide was nearing 2.5 billion — double the number 
of users five years before. Asia had by far the largest number of users, with 
more than 1 billion individuals online, a full 44 percent of the world’s total. 
Amazingly, that still means only 27.5 percent of the Asian population has 
Internet access at home, setting the stage for continued growth in that con­
tinent. We have long since reached that critical mass where most people are 
using the Internet regularly for everyday shopping and other financial activi­
ties. The Internet is already becoming a powerhouse for small businesses.

What This Book Assumes about You
This book assumes that you’ve never been in business before but that you’re 
interested in setting up your own commercial site on the Internet. I also 
assume that you’re familiar with the Internet, have been surfing for a while, 
and may even have put out some information of your own in a home page.
This book also assumes that you have or are ready to get the following:
	
✓	Some sort of computing device, either handheld or desktop, and a 
way to get online: Don’t worry; Chapters 3 and 4 explain exactly what 
hardware and software you need.
	
✓	Instructions on how to think like a businessperson: I spend a lot of 
time in this book encouraging you to set goals, devise strategies to meet 
those goals, and do the sort of planning that successful businesspeople 
need to do.
	
✓	Just enough technical know-how: You don’t have to do it all yourself. 
Plenty of entrepreneurs decide to partner with someone or hire an 
expert to perform design or technical work. This book can help you 
understand your options and gives you a basic vocabulary so that you 
can work productively with any consultants you may hire.

 Introduction
What’s Where in This Book
This book is divided into six parts. Each part contains chapters that discuss 
stages in the process of starting an online business: launching your business, 
and combining a website, social marketing, and multiple storefronts to reach 
customers from three different angles.
Part I: Launching Your Online Business
In Part I, I describe what you need to do and how you need to think so that 
you can start your online business. The first chapter summarizes what’s new 
in e-commerce, so you can get up to speed right away. Chapter 2 describes 
several Internet success stories, including a programmer who turned his 
career around and a mapmaker turned entrepreneur. In subsequent chapters 
I describe how other entrepreneurs started their online businesses. I also 
describe the software you need to create web pages and perform essential 
business tasks, along with any computer upgrades that help your business 
run more smoothly. You also discover how to choose a web host and find 
exciting new ways to make money online.
Part II: Creating a Business Website
Even if you only sell on eBay or make money by placing affiliate ads, at some 
point you need to create a website — a series of interconnected web pages 
that everyone in cyberspace can view with a web browser. A website is a 
home base where people can find you and see what you have to offer. This 
part explains how to create a compelling website that attracts paying custom­
ers around the world and keeps them coming back to make more purchases. 
This part also includes options for attracting and keeping customers, making 
your site organized and easy to navigate, sourcing inventory, and updating 
and improving your online business.
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing
Some of the most exciting options for starting a business online are building 
a name for yourself and attracting customers to your products and services 
through word-of-mouth advertising, social networking, and other advertis­
ing strategies. In this part, you find out all about those options and discover 
the ins and outs of advertising online. You improve your visibility by keep­
ing up with your customers through e-mail and newsletters, and optimizing 
your catalog listings and website for search engines such as Google and Bing. 
You also see how to spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, and your own 
blog, and find out how to reach customers in your local area. Many of these 

6
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 7th Edition 
sites enable budding businesspeople to conduct a cost-effective and highly 
targeted form of online advertising called search engine optimization (SEO), 
which I describe in detail in Chapter 11.
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website
You can generate sales revenue without setting up your own website from 
scratch. Rather than go it alone, you can sign up with one of the many well-
established business marketplaces on the web that enable individuals just 
like you to create storefronts or sell individual items. In this part, you find 
out about creating websites or storefronts on Amazon and eBay, among other 
venues. You also learn about the third part of triangulation: reaching custom­
ers through one or more specialty marketplaces. Finally, you learn how to 
manage a business with multiple channels through special software and tools 
provided by Google.
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal 
and Fiscally Responsible
This part delves into some essential activities for any online business. Find 
out about general security methods designed to make commerce more 
secure on the Internet. I also discuss copyrights, trademarks, and other legal 
concerns for anyone wanting to start a company in the increasingly competi­
tive atmosphere of the Internet. Finally, you get an overview of basic account­
ing practices for online businesses and suggestions for accounting tools that 
you can use to keep track of your e-commerce activities.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Filled with tips, cautions, suggestions, and examples, the Part of Tens pres­
ents many tidbits of information you can use to plan and create your own 
business presence on the Internet, including ten e-commerce marketplaces 
worth exploring.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I format important bits of information in special ways to make 
sure you notice them right away:

7
 Introduction
	
✓	In This Chapter lists: Chapters start with a list of the topics I cover in 
that chapter. This list is like a miniature table of contents.
	
✓	Numbered lists: When you see a numbered list, follow the steps in that 
order to accomplish a given task.
	
✓	Bulleted lists: Bulleted lists (like this one) indicate things you can do in 
any order, or they list related bits of information.
	
✓	Web addresses: When I describe activities or sites of interest on the 
World Wide Web, I include the address, or Uniform Resource Locator 
(URL), in a special typeface, like this: http://www.wiley.com. 
Because the newer versions of popular web browsers don’t require you 
to enter the entire URL, this book uses shortened addresses. For exam­
ple, if you want to connect to the Wiley Publishing site, simply enter the 
following in your browser’s Go To or Address box: www.wiley.com.
	
	Don’t be surprised if your browser can’t find an Internet address you 
type or if a web page shown in this book no longer looks the same. 
Although the sites were current when the book was written, web 
addresses (and sites themselves) can be pretty fickle. Try looking for a 
missing site by using an Internet search engine. Or try shortening the 
address by deleting everything after the .com (or .org or .edu).
Icons Used in This Book
Starting an Online Business For Dummies, 7th Edition, uses special graphical 
elements — icons — to get your attention. Here’s what they look like and 
what they mean:
	
This icon points out some technical details that may be of interest to you. A 
thorough understanding, however, isn’t a prerequisite to grasping the underly­
ing concept. Non-techies are welcome to skip items marked by this icon.
	
This icon calls your attention to interviews I conducted with online entrepre­
neurs who provided tips and instructions for running an online business.
	
This icon flags practical advice about particular software programs or issues 
of importance to businesses. Look to these tips for help with finding resources 
quickly, making sales, or improving the quality of your online business site. 
This icon also alerts you to software programs and other resources that I con­
sider to be especially good, particularly for the novice user.
	
This icon points out potential pitfalls that can develop into more-major prob­
lems if you’re not careful.

Beyond the Book
This edition of Starting an Online Business For Dummies isn’t just what you 
see within the book you’re holding. Here’s a glimpse at this book’s compan­
ion content, which you can reference online at any time:
	
✓	Cheat Sheet: Go to www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/starting
anonlinebusiness, and you’ll find lists, charts, and summaries that 
serve as an easy-to-use reference when you don’t have the book at hand. 
You’ll find a chart matching specific business goals with the three com­
ponents of online business triangulation (website, social marketing, and 
storefronts); a second chart that matches the many types of website/
storefront hosts you can choose with the types of merchandise you 
want to sell; a checklist to help you boost your search engine placement; 
and a sample calendar you can modify to help you fit all your e-commerce 
tasks into a weekly schedule.
	
✓	Extras: On several of the pages that open each of this book’s Parts, 
you’ll find links to web extras — articles that expand on some of the con­
cepts discussed in that part. The web extra for Part II summarizes some 
essential tasks you need to perform to get your new business off the 
ground. In the web extra for Part III, you get three social marketing tips. 
In Part IV’s web extra, you discover more about expanding your busi­
ness beyond your website. You’ll find the web extras at www.dummies.

We’re In It Together
Improving communication is the whole point of this book. My goal is to help 
you express yourself in the dynamic medium of the Internet and to remind 
you that you’re not alone. I’m a businessperson myself, so I hope you’ll let me 
know what you think about this book by contacting me directly if you have

N

ew technologies and ways of shopping and selling are always popping 
up in the world of online commerce. One of the biggest new develop­
ments is the proliferation of devices like the ones in your own pocket or on 
your work table. Buyers — the people you want to connect with online — are 
finding new ways to shop and make purchases. Consumers can shop wher­
ever they are in the world. They’re surfing with small screens, using mobile 
apps, and taking charge of the e-commerce experience more than ever 
before.
At the same time, those who seek to start or grow an online business have 
new opportunities to help them along. They can get help from the same 
engaged customers with whom they engage on social marketing sites like 
Facebook and Twitter. They can find the funding they need by turning to 
new resources like Kickstarter. And they can follow the example of the many 
ambitious small business owners who are triangulating their business pro­
cesses — using websites, social media, and storefronts to connect with cus­
tomers from many different angles.

12
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Keeping up with all the new trends in online commerce is getting harder 
because it’s a constantly moving target. This chapter gives you an overview 
of some of the many new and exciting ways to conduct e-commerce. If you’ve 
heard about e-commerce before and weren’t attracted by the thought of cre­
ating a website and sales catalog, take a look at these innovative options for 
generating revenue.
E-Commerce Is Goin’ Mobile
As I was working on this chapter, I covered eBay’s Analyst Day event, in 
which eBay describes the trends it is seeing in e-commerce and made projec­
tions about future growth. CEO John Donahoe focused his opening remarks 
on the rise of mobile commerce.
Consumers now shop with smartphones in hand in brick-and-mortar stores. 
They compare prices and research the products they see in front of them. 
They don’t always follow through and make purchases with their mobile 
devices. But more and more shoppers throughout the world are going 
through the purchase process on the small screen. But you can increase the 
chances that they will, as described in the sections that follow.
	
eBay reported $13 billion in sales volume in 2012; that represents 13.5 percent 
of its entire volume of $175 billion. The company projects that its mobile com­
merce figures will grow 20 percent annually through 2015. Find out more at 
www.ebayinc.com/investor_relations/analyst_day_2013.
Designing for the small screen
The first way to attract mobile shoppers is to make sure your website or 
online store loads quickly and is easy to navigate. For big companies that 
have their own IT and web design staff, that means adapting the site they’ve 
designed to appear on a big desktop monitor so that it works on a 5-inch or 
smaller smartphone screen.
If you don’t have a designer on staff, you can get your own mobile site by 
signing up with a hosting service that provides you one for free. You can 
also turn to a company like Mobify (www.mobify.com), which specializes in 
creating mobile sites for online sellers. Three versions of one home page are 
shown in the image on Mobify’s home page, shown in Figure 1-1.
	
See Chapter 19 for ten ways to reach mobile shoppers.

Selling mobile, selling local: Two examples
There are many ways to sell online, but some 
of the newest involve mobile technology and 
reaching local customers online. Here are just 
two examples of entrepreneurs who are taking 
advantage of these approaches.
Lisa Bettany, a professional photographer (not 
a programmer), spent a year and a half creating 
an app for the iPhone called Camera+. She was 
pretty much destitute while she was doing 
this. She hired a programmer to help make her 
idea a reality. Since it was released, she has 
generated $4 million by selling 4 million of her 
apps in iTunes and other locations. You can find 
more about Lisa at www.MostlyLisa.com. 
What if you aren’t technologically savvy, but 
you have a great deal of knowledge, even 
passion, for a particular subject? Dean Pettit 
was a worker for NASA in Florida when he 
was laid off. He loves the outdoors, especially 
the area called the Space Coast. He created 
a aggregation website called Space Coast 
Outdoors (www.spacecoastoutdoors.
net), which collects information about a single 
topic in one place so it’s easy to find. It’s the 
kind of aggregation of information that has 
worked since Yahoo! started back in the 1990s.
You’re probably wondering how this kind of 
site makes money when all you’re providing is 
information. You build as much traffic as you 
can, and when you get to a certain number of 
visitors, you can start to sell ads.
Dean Pettit isn’t getting rich from his site, at 
least not yet. But the extra spending money 
helps while he’s between day jobs, and he’s 
hoping to build enough monthly income so 
eventually he won’t need a day job.

14
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Facilitating purchases and searches
You need to list yourself where mobile shoppers hang out. Make sure you’re 
on the local directory Google Places for Business (www.google.com/
business/placesforbusiness) and places like the review site Yelp 
(www.yelp.com), for example. List your products on venues like eBay Local 
Shopping (www.ebay.com/local). People love to look up reviews on their 
mobile devices, so make sure you’re there.
Mobile commerce is also about making it easy for shoppers to tap the Buy 
button on their touch screens. Here again, the choice of service provider is 
critical. Some specifically focus on making shopping and purchasing as easy 
as possible for mobile buyers.
	
Find out more about organizing both desktop and mobile websites in Chapter 5.
Businesses Processes Are 
Becoming Social
Those who believe in political or human rights know the power a group of 
people can have. In the online business world, some forward-looking compa­
nies have enlisted the participation of the “crowd.”
I’m not talking about using social marketing sites like Facebook to build 
brand loyalty and boost sales. (That subject is discussed in Chapter 13, by 
the way.) Rather, these innovative companies are letting customers partici­
pate in the process of manufacturing and designing products.
Choosing merchandise 
with customers’ help
At the women’s vintage and retro clothing site ModCloth (www.modcloth.
com), enthusiastic buyers use their smartphones and an internal app devel­
oped by the company to provide real-time feedback on how much they like 
sweaters, other clothing, and accessories that have just been made. The site 
invites users to “be the buyer,” as shown in Figure 1-2.

15
 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
	
Figure 1-2: 
ModCloth 
makes 
buying deci-
sions based 
on user 
ratings.
	
ModCloth can gauge the sentiment of its customer base within minutes and 
use that information to do strategic purchasing. If the clothing vendor is in its 
facility while the feedback is being registered, ModCloth can tell the vendor 
immediately whether it wants an item, and whether it wants to purchase 50, 
100, or 500 of that item.
Instead of making such decisions by intuition or by the gut feeling of a few 
sample shoppers, ModCloth can back up such decisions with user data. The 
community has even suggested new dress designs and new colors for sweat­
ers, for example.
	
The coupon and deal company RetailMeNot (www.retailmenot.com) was 
developed in part on recommendations from community members who sug­
gested deals, coupons, and other ways to save money on shopping.
Bringing end-users into 
the development process
At Quirky (www.quirky.com), the user community participates in many 
critical aspects of creating new products for sale. Customers submit ideas for 
products; they vote on and rate one another’s products, as shown in Figure 1-3; 
they name items; they even photograph products. The company can get 
merchandise online that much quicker because of the use of crowdsourcing.

Figure 1-3:

Bringing the “crowd” into your operations is among the latest and most excit­
ing developments as I write this edition of Starting an Online Business For 
Dummies. It goes beyond selling merchandise. Author Hugh Howey (www.
hughhowey.com) brings his audience into the process of writing his highly 
popular series of novels. He expanded his bestselling Wool from a story to 
a novel because readers urged him for more. He wrote the novel as a serial, 
releasing a bit at a time, and responding to feedback as he went along. He 
encourages others to write “fan fiction” based on his work.
Howey himself participates in a huge reader community he has created on 
his website. On his home page (which doubles as his blog, as shown in 
Figure 1-4), he posts progress bars showing how far along he is with writing 
his books.

 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
Howey has created his own platform — the ultimate goal for authors and 
businesspeople alike, and a subject explored in Chapter 20.
Venture Capital Is Social, Too
You’ve probably already heard one of the success stories coming out of 
a crowd-funding website called Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com). 
According to Business Insider (www.businessinsider.com/kickstarter-
success-stories-2013-1), in 2012 about 18,000 projects were funded on 
this site by people who contributed $320 million. Here are some examples:
	
✓	Pebble, a watch that uses Bluetooth to connect to a smartphone, 
received $10.3 million (its developers originally sought $100,000).
	
✓	Singer Amanda Palmer raised more than $1.1 million to fund her new 
album, art book, and tour after breaking from her record label.
	
✓	Two MIT Media Lab researchers raised $2.9 million to create an “afford­
able, professional 3-D printer.”
As venture capitalist Josh Goldman of Northwest Venture Partners said in an 
interview on EcommerceBytes in 2012 (www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/
abn/y12/m08/i27/s01), venture capital is more readily available now than 
it was five or ten years ago for those with good ideas and a well-developed 
plans for an online businesses. Goldman suggested sites like AngelList 
(https://angel.co) for matching investors whose area of focus meshes 
with what you want to do.
Small, mom-and-pop businesses can secure venture capital just like high-tech 
startups. Capital Access Network (CAN) targets small- and medium-size busi­
nesses for funding. Most grants are for $500 to $1,000, although they can go 
up to $250,000.
	
Indiegogo (www.indiegogo.com) also provides funding to individuals and 
businesses in search of funds. Kabbage (www.kabbage.com) specializes in 
providing loans and cash advances to small online business owners. Typically, 
the financing costs between 2 and 7 percent of the loan amount, according 
to the company.
Triangulating for Business Success
One trend I’ve been following in recent years is the rise of online businesses 
that sell through three venues:

18
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
✓	A website as your “home base”
	
✓	A presence on social media sites, most notably Facebook and Twitter, to 
connect with potential customers and keep up with your fans, friends, 
and buyers
	
✓	One or more online storefronts on sites like eBay, Amazon, Bonanza, 
eCRATER, or Etsy
Together, these three components of an online business combine to drive 
traffic to one another and to drive customers to your website. The fact is, a 
single store or standalone website is not enough. I’ve been covering e-commerce 
since the 1990s, and when I started out, someone with a great idea or a ter­
rific product could make a killing with one website. It’s not quite as easy 
these days. There is so much competition, and so many people have become 
so sophisticated about marketing, that the most successful entrepreneurs are 
triangulating these three components.
Maintaining a presence in all these sites is a lot of work, to be sure, but the 
rewards include a better search engine placement and increased sales. The 
following sections explore this trend and how you can take advantage of it.
Creating a home page 
that’s a “home base”
There are more ways than ever before to pop up online, especially when 
you consider resources like Twitter, YouTube, and the photo-sharing site 
Pinterest. But the thing that ties all these together is still a website.
If there’s a trend pertaining to websites in 2013, it’s the merger of websites 
with blogs. For many people, their website is their blog. That’s the case 
with my own website (www.gregholden.com). It’s run on the blogging site 
WordPress, which enables anyone to not only create a blog, but also design 
web pages and post photos and other contents. Business sites that sell prod­
ucts are a natural fit with blogs, too.
Creating a blog to support your business is a powerful way of reaching poten­
tial customers and strengthening connections with current ones. The word-
of-mouth marketing that results from successful blog publishing is effective 
while also being cost-effective: Advertising costs are miniscule compared to a 
traditional marketing effort.
What’s the first step in creating a blog? I usually advocate thinking before 
clicking. Think about the kind of blog you want to create. An article titled 
“Create a Blog to Boost Your Business” in Entrepreneur magazine describes 
several different types of blogs created by Denali Flavors to promote its 

19
 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
Moose Tracks line of ice cream flavors. Each blog took a different approach 
to promoting the same product:
	
✓	Entertainment: The blog Moosetopia is (or was; it was discontinued but 
is still online) written by the Moose Tracks Moose, the product mascot.
	
✓	Useful advice: The blog Free Money Finance provides something that 
everyone needs — advice on how to handle their money. The connec­
tion to the product is a “sponsored by” Moose Tracks ice cream logo to 
the right of the blog, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
✓	Public relations: Another blog, Team Moose Tracks, concerns efforts of 
the company’s cycling team to raise money for an orphanage in Latvia. It 
reflects positively on the company and the brand.
	
✓	Behind the scenes: A fourth blog, Denali Flavors, takes a look at what 
goes on in the company.
The article (www.entrepreneur.com/article/80100-2) reports that 
site visits went up 25.7 percent after the blogs went online; the company 
spent less than $700 on all four blogs, too. You can take any or all of these 
approaches in your own blog, depending on the product you’re trying to sell 
and your available resources. If you’re selling a “fun” product, you might 
decide to take the entertainment approach; if you work for a big company, 
you might take the behind-the-scenes approach.
	
Figure 1-5: 
This is just 
one of sev-
eral blogs 
created by 
the people 
who make

Tracks ice 
cream.
	
After you have a general idea of the approach you want to take, it’s time to 
get started. The first step is to choose your blog host. You don’t necessarily 
have to pay to do this; most of the best-known blog hosts offer hosting for 
free. They include

20
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
✓	Blogger (www.blogger.com) doesn’t have as many features as other 
blog utilities, but it’s free.
	
✓	WordPress (www.wordpress.com) is software you download and 
install to create and manage your blog. WordPress offers free host­
ing for blogs and is very popular; find out more in the latest edition of 
WordPress For Dummies, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
	
✓	TypePad (www.typepad.com) has lots of features, but it costs any­
where from $8.95 to $29.95 per month. The Unlimited plan, at $14.95 per 
month, should be sufficient for most online business owners.
Take some time to look at other business blogs and examine how they use 
type and color. Often, for a purely personal blog, it doesn’t matter whether 
it’s carefully designed. But for a blog that has a business purpose, you need 
to make it look professional.
Next, determine who will do the blogging. You may not want to do it all your­
self. If you can gather two or three contributors, you increase the chances 
that you can post entries on a daily basis, which is important for blogs. That 
way, if someone needs time off, you’ll have backup contributors available.
When you configure your blog, no matter which host you choose, the main 
features tend to be more or less the same. Figure 1-6 shows the Clean Air 
Gardening Blog, one of the many blogs created by expert marketer Lars 
Hundley, whom I profile in the sidebar “Blogs plant seeds, gardening busi­
ness blooms,” later in this chapter. The blog includes some Google AdSense 
ads to drum up extra revenue; a link for visitors to post comments; catego­
ries that organize past blog posts; a chronological archive of posts; and links 
to other relevant sites, including Hundley’s main Clean Air Gardening website 
(www.cleanairgardening.com).
	
For detailed instructions on how to create a business blog, turn to Buzz 
Marketing with Blogs For Dummies, by Susannah Gardner.
Perhaps the most difficult aspect of blogging isn’t actually creating the blog, 
but maintaining it. Developing a schedule in which you publish regular 
blog posts is important. It’s also important to measure how many visits 
your blog and your business website get so that you can measure results. 
Be sure to do a benchmark test — a test done before a process or proce­
dure that gives you baseline data — so that you can judge results afterward. 
Adjust your site as needed to attract more visitors, but remember to stay on 
topic so that you don’t drive away the audience you already have.
A business website needs to have the elements described in Chapter 5; an 
overview follows.

tive, well

Domain name
You need a domain name: something short and catchy that you can regis­
ter with a domain name registrar, one of the companies that keeps track of 
such things, like GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com). Your name can suggest 
what you sell, but it doesn’t have to. It can be a word that doesn’t necessar­
ily mean anything, like Skype, the videoconferencing service, or Timbuk2 
(www.timbuk2.com), the shoulder-bag company that took off because of 
the Internet. One of the biggest sellers on eBay used to be called Inflatable 
Madness, for example. The name is so nutty that you tend to remember it.
Logo
When you’re surfing a succession of web pages that seem to flash by on your 
monitor like stores passing through a car window, you need a landmark or 
indicator that lets you know what’s there for you. On the street, you scan 
signs. On the Internet, you look at logos.
A logo gives visitors an indication, in a single glance, of what your business 
is all about. It’s an essential part of your online identity and something you 
can carry through to your Facebook page and other sites where you have a 
presence. Ultimately, they’ll help you to build a platform, a subject covered 
in Chapter 20. You’ll find out more about logos in Chapter 5.

Hosting service
In exchange for a monthly or yearly fee, a website host gives you space on a 
web server, a computer that is always connected to the Internet and is reli­
able and fast. You share the server with other businesses (although you can 
pay more and get your own server if you want a really fast connection). You 
upload (or move) your photos and web page files from your computer to the 
server, and you are given an address or URL so everyone can find them.
Beyond that, a host can do a lot more. It’s helpful to break hosting services 
into two general types: a general website host and an e-commerce host, 
sometimes called a shopping cart service.
Shopping cart
At the core of the store is a shopping cart: a utility that makes it easy for you 
to create individual product listings that include photos, descriptions, and a 
button labeled Buy Now or Add to Cart. A shopping cart also gives you:
	
✓	A secure server
	
✓	A payment method
	
✓	Search engine optimization (SEO), a way of improving your placement in 
search engine results, as well as your marketing
	
✓	Consultation on your store/business
A shopping cart generally costs more than a general website host. Volusion 
(www.volusion.com), for example, offers five different hosting packages 
ranging from $49 to $149 per month. But the consultation, customer support, 
and marketing assistance offered by shopping cart packages makes them well 
worth the expense, especially when you’re just starting out.
Design
You don’t always need to hire a designer, especially if you sell on Amazon.
com, where design hardly matters and you place only brief product listings. 
Some e-commerce hosting services provide templates that you can adapt to 
your own site. (A template is a predesigned web page that you can fill with 
your own words and images. You don’t have to do any design.) Since you’re 
just starting out and are on a shoestring, sign up with a host and use its tem­
plates to get your site started. Once you get some income flowing, you might 
want to hire someone to create a distinctive design and help you with more 
advanced store features.

23
 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
Promotions
Whether you’re selling products on a blog or promoting your services, your 
goal is to entice visitors to click your website, explore it, stay for as long as 
possible, and come back on a regular basis. You want your website or your 
store to have a “stickiness” factor. Promotions can go a long way toward 
making your site sticky. These include
	
✓	Coupons
	
✓	Sales
	
✓	Free shipping
	
✓	Deals for returning customers
Free shipping is a big deal on the web. Studies have shown that people are 
more likely to click the Add to Cart or Buy button if they don’t have to pay 
for shipping — even if the price is higher because you, the seller, have built 
the shipping cost into the price. This is controversial. On eBay, sellers get a 
higher seller rating if they offer free shipping. But with the higher price, you 
become less competitive compared to other sellers who might be offering 
similar items. You might consider doing an experiment and offering some 
items with free shipping as a promotion, and see what happens.
How do you create these kinds of promotions? That’s where the choice of 
shopping cart service becomes critical; it can help you with creating and dis­
tributing such deals.
Once you have a website in place, you can branch out to link it to other 
promotional sites, videos, or photo collections, just as entrepreneur Lars 
Hundley does in the nearby sidebar. Or you might open storefronts and 
social media sites as described in the sections that follow.
Connecting with customers 
via social marketing
When I wrote the first edition of this book back in 1998, you could advertise 
your online business in a few ways: through a website, through postings on 
online discussion boards, through placing banner ads, and by exchanging 
links to other sites. Now you can do viral marketing (word-of-mouth advertis­
ing) on social networking sites.

24
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Blogs plant seeds, gardening business blooms
Lars Hundley is an expert with blogs, photo-
sharing, and social networking sites to 
market his products. His Dallas, Texas–
based business, Clean Air Gardening (www.
cleanairgardening.com), posted sales 
of $1.2 million in 2012, down from $1.5 million in 
2006. A site related to the main one, the yo-yo 
site Yoyoplay.com, posted sales of $750,000 
and $500,000 in sales came from listings on 
Amazon.com. “Amazon and its shipping prices 
on oversized items like composters and rain 
barrels are killing us!” commented Hundley. 
But he continues to market multiple websites 
enthusiastically with the optimism of the 
successful entrepreneur.
Products occasionally receive the attention of 
traditional media. A few years ago, for example, 
Clear Air Gardening was mentioned in The New 
York Times as well as on Good Morning America.
Hundley uses a variety of blogs and online video 
sites to promote his Clean Air Gardening online 
business:
	✓	Practical Environmentalist (w w w .
practicalenvironmentalist.
com): This blog isn’t branded for Clean Air 
Gardening or directly linked to the company, 
but it is intended to attract the same kind of 
environmentally aware person who is its 
typical customer. This blog is more a free 
service than it is a hard-selling kind of blog.
	✓	Reel Mowers (www.reelmowers.org): 
This blog bills itself as the ultimate guide to 
reel push lawn mowers. 
	✓	Compost guide (www.compostguide.
com): This blog promotes several different 
companies. It’s designed to generate a lot of 
composting-related educational information 
as well as keyword-rich pages and product 
promotion pages that give Air Gardening 
a growing body of search engine–friendly 
composting content over time.
	✓	Flash-based video on Clean Air Gardening: 
Flash-based video helps sell products. 
Hundley films the videos with his Canon 
PowerShot S1 digital camera, which also 
shoots video. Then he edits them with his 
Mac mini and converts them to Flash so 
that people can watch them with their web 
browser directly on the page. One example 
is at www.cleanairgardening.
com/patdesaustum.html.
	✓	Videos on YouTube.com: Hundley uploads 
videos so that he doesn’t have to pay 
for the bandwidth. Then he embeds the 
YouTube video on his product page. That 
also allows people to find the products 
on the YouTube site and click through 
to Clean Air Gardening. “When we add a 
video to a web page, we can increase our 
conversion rate for that product by up to 
20 percent,” comments Hundley. Find the 
company’s videos at www.youtube.
com/cleanairgardening. 
	✓	Product and testimonial photos at Flickr: 
Hundley puts his customer testimonial 
photos on Flickr and links to them from his 
testimonials page on his website. People 
can access these photos directly on 
Flickr (www.flickr.com/photos/
cleanairgardening). They can 
then use a link to return to the Clean Air 
Gardening page.
“If you’re thinking about starting your own 
Internet business, just do it!”, says Hundley. 
“Start a small site and do it in your spare time 
to test the waters. I kept my day job for the first 
year when I started this business, until it started 
to take off and make money. Now, 11 years 
later, it is a multimillion-dollar-a-year company 
with 14 employees and a large, 14,000-square-
foot warehouse and office. You can do it too, if 
you try!”

 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
Social networking sites are the modern-day equivalent of the town square. 
When you go to a social networking site, you strike up a personal relationship 
with a merchant; after you do, you’re that much more likely to buy something 
from that person. Social networking sites give potential customers another 
place where they can find you and get to know you. The best-known sites are
	
✓	Twitter (www.twitter.com)
	
✓	Facebook (www.facebook.com)
	
✓	MySpace (www.myspace.com)
	
✓	Pinterest (www.pinterest.com)
If you want to reach a younger generation of consumers, places like Pinterest 
and Facebook are among the best ways to find them. If you sell services that 
depend on personal contact with a customer, such as a group of musicians 
that plays for weddings or a wedding planner, people sometimes hire you as 
much for your personality and personal approach as for your actual work. In 
these kinds of fields, social networking sites are even more important.
	
Another networking site, LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com), lets you build a net­
work of business contacts who can get in touch with one another and build a 
community.
Facebooking your business
Facebook wasn’t started with the idea of business in mind. It is primarily a 
site where you connect with friends, family, and others on a regular basis. 
You sign up for a Facebook account and create a page where you post infor­
mation about yourself and (optionally) a photo. You then decide whether 
that information is available to the public at large or only to people you invite 
to see it. That’s the nice thing about Facebook: You control who communi­
cates with you because you “invite” or “approve” them as needed. If you are 
approached by someone you don’t know, you simply decline to approve that 
person’s access.
For me, Facebook is a terrific way to keep in touch with friends I don’t 
see often enough and family members who live far away. Recently, I used 
Facebook to write a story that I share with my Facebook friends. I write an 
episode of the story on my blog and then announce it via Facebook. One of 
these announcements is shown in Figure 1-7.
As often happens, this popular online resource has become a place to do 
business for a few early adopters. With more than 1 billion registered users, 
60+ percent of whom log in every day, it’s a natural for businesspeople to 
advertise themselves and even offer items for sale.

The statistics about Facebook come from the site itself: newsroom.fb.com/
Key-Facts.
A marketplace for artists called ArtFire (www.artfire.com) allows its mem­
bers to display items from its sales catalogs on their Facebook pages. Not 
only that, but if you shop in one of these Facebook “kiosks,” you can make a 
purchase there without having to go to ArtFire or another site. The utility is 
available to ArtFire members as part of their $12.95 per month hosting fee. 
In Chapter 13, you can read about one enterprising seller who’s sold items 
through Facebook.
Tweeting for fun and profit
Twitter is a true Internet phenomenon. It distinguishes itself from other 
social networking sites by limiting users to posting comments that contain no 
more than 140 characters. Despite this restriction, many businesspeople as 
well as public figures have latched on to Twitter as a convenient and simple 
way to spread the word about anything. That includes senators posting 
“tweets” about upcoming votes in Congress, Sarah Palin talking about herself, 
and stars like Ashton Kutcher (Twitter name: @aplusk), who at this writing 
has 14 million people around the world “following” his Twitter posts. Every 
time he posts a tweet, 14 million people get the message.
With that kind of platform, anyone can promote him- or herself or a business 
online. Kutcher, to his credit, regularly promotes social change and peace. 
But my colleague Ina Steiner, who runs a website called EveryPlaceISell, uses 

27
 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
Twitter as a platform for sellers. Sellers regularly post tweets about sales and 
promotions. See Chapter 13 for more.
Blogging to build your business
In the late 1990s, web pages were where it was at as far as e-commerce goes. 
As of this writing, the blog is the tool of choice for many online entrepreneurs. 
On the surface, a blog doesn’t seem like something that can make you money. 
A blog is a web page, but one that is updated frequently with content to 
which readers can quickly respond with comments. Many blogs take the form 
of an online diary: a running commentary that the blogger adds to as often as 
possible — every few days, every day, or perhaps even several times a day.
Blogs do make money, however. When you have a dependable number of 
viewers, you can generate revenue from your blog by using these methods:
	
✓	Placing ads: You can use a service such as Blogads (www.blogads.
com) or Google’s AdSense (adsense.google.com).
	
✓	Placing affiliate ads: You sign up for well-known programs that steer 
potential buyers to Amazon.com or eBay.
	
✓	Building interest in your website: By talking about yourself, your 
knowledge, or your services, you encourage customers to commit to 
them.
	
See Chapter 13 for more about blogs and how they can help your business.
Sharing your work with Flickr
If you’re lucky, your products sell themselves. But for some products, photos 
are a necessity. If you have a big piece of furniture, such as a couch or a 
rare antique or a work of art, a description that consists solely of words 
just doesn’t cut it. Photos give you a real selling point. You can post photos 
on your own website, of course. But the cool and trendy place for them to 
appear is at the popular photo-sharing site Flickr (www.flickr.com).
Flickr is free and easy to use. I can’t think of a better business use for the 
site than the Clean Air Gardening customer photos, shown in Figure 1-8. Lars 
Hundley (whom I profile in the sidebar earlier in this chapter) invites his 
customers to submit photos of the products they’ve purchased, such as push 
reel lawn mowers and weathervanes.

Diversifying sales with 
multiple storefronts
An online storefront is a site you don’t own yourself. It’s one you set up with 
a marketplace that charges you a monthly fee for e-commerce hosting. The 
e-commerce hosts I mention in the previous sections let you set up your own 
website. The ones I mention in this section are marketplaces. Some market­
places, like eBay and Amazon, let you sell all kinds of merchandise. Others 
are set up for people who sell a particular kind of item. They attract people 
who are looking for just that kind of item:
	
✓	Etsy (www.etsy.com) is set up for handmade arts and crafts.
	
✓	Ruby Lane (www.rubylane.com) is for antiques and collectibles.
	
✓	AbeBooks (www.abebooks.com) is for used books; this is where all 
those booksellers you used to see around are going now.
	
✓	Planet Diecast (www.planetdiecast.com) is for, as you might expect, 
diecast toys.
	
✓	iOffer (www.ioffer.com) gives buyers the chance to make an offer for 
what you have to sell.
Some storefronts don’t focus on any particular type of sales items; they are 
general interest marketplaces. Some of the most popular are eCRATER and 
Bonanza. They are popular alternatives for people who are looking for an 
alternative to eBay in particular, who want lower fees and fewer regulations.

29
 Chapter 1: New Tools and Strategies for Your Online Business
After you go through the effort of creating your own website, why should you 
open another storefront on someone else’s site and pay another rental fee? 
It’s not something you have to do right away. You might want to get 
one store up and running and get some income flowing before you open a 
second one.
The big thing a storefront does is give you a ready-made source of potential 
customers. A site like eBay, with its many millions of visitors a month, is 
bound to bring attention to your sales catalog. In fact, most people, when 
they start an online business, start with a site like eBay, not their own 
website. A storefront in a marketplace can also:
	
✓	Get your business up and running quickly.
	
✓	Give you other shoppers you can talk to and consult (that is, a user 
community).
	
✓	Supplement a website.
	
✓	Give you more customers.
	
✓	Give your customers a trustworthy way to buy from you.
	
✓	Come with a shopping cart/shipping system/payment plan.
People who might be reluctant to buy from your website, or who might not 
find your website, might be more likely to find you in a big, well-known mar­
ketplace that attracts millions of customers each day. If you’re just starting 
out, it’s a great idea to set up a store with one of the big players. These sites 
might have lots of rules and they cut into your profits with their fees, but 
they bring you more customers, too. Once you have customers, you can keep 
communicating with them to purchase on your website, where you get to 
keep all the profits.

Chapter 14.
Partnering with a service provider
Many sellers who want to maximize their sales volume to the highest degree 
possible decide to sign up with high-powered professional business services 
to help them manage multiple online stores.
Moving from doing all the work yourself to signing up with a service provider 
is like the difference between cleaning your own house and hiring a cleaning 
service to do the work for you. You do have to pay for a cleaning service, but 
you’ll have less stress in the long run.

30

By signing up with a company, such as ChannelAdvisor (www.channel
advisor.com) or Infopia (www.infopia.com), you can not only create an 
online store, but also get help with publicizing it and conducting transactions.
	
You don’t have to be a beginner to align with one of these marketing com­
panies. One of the best online sellers I know, David Yaskulka of Blueberry 
Boutique (www.blueberryboutique.net), signed up with ChannelAdvisor, 
and he already knows a lot about marketing and selling online.

T

he concept of starting a business online has been around since the 1990s. 
These days, opening a storefront or a sales channel on the Internet is 
not the least bit unusual. As time goes on, you have more and more success 
stories to emulate and be inspired by. Also, new software and services are 
continually developed to make creating web pages and transacting business 
online easier than ever. But after you leap a few not-so-high technological 
hurdles, the basic steps for starting a successful online business haven’t 
really changed. Those steps are well within the reach of individuals like you 
and me who have no prior business experience.
Online businesses are affected by economic downturns just as offline opera­
tions are. But in good times or bad, you can still thrive. All you need are a 
good idea, a bit of startup money, some computer equipment, and a little 
help from your friends.
One of my goals in this book is to be one of those friends — someone who 
provides you with the right advice and support to get your business online 
and make it a success. In this chapter, I give you a step-by-step overview of 
the entire process of starting an online business.
Step 1: Identify a Need
“The best of anything hasn’t been done yet,” says John Moen, the successful 
founder of the Graphic Maps website (www.graphicmaps.com) I profile 
in this chapter. “The web isn’t over. Someday someone will invent a better 

32
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Walmart, and there will be a bigger and better store. As the technology 
changes, someone will create a business online that makes people say, ‘Holy 
cow, that’s cool.’”
In fact, in the course of writing about online business for ECommerceBytes 
(www.ecommercebytes.com), I’ve found out about all kinds of new online 
services, such as:
	
✓	RIVworks (www.rivworks.com) lets small businesses affordably add 
video clips to their websites. RIV stands for Rich Interactive Video.
	
✓	SteelHouse (www.steelhouse.com), a “behavioral advertising” 
company, gives online businesses the ability to display animated or 
video ads on their sites.
	
✓	FBAPower (www.fbapower.com) helps those who sell on Amazon.com 
boost their profit margin by finding products that sell well on the site 
and then letting Amazon ship them through its Fulfillment By Amazon 
service.
	
✓	FeeFighters (www.feefighters.com) helps businesspeople shop for 
the best discount rates from credit companies so they can accept credit 
card payments from shoppers.
	
✓	Mobify (www.mobify.com), helps merchants create mobile versions of 
their websites so they can pursue “m-commerce.”
In addition to these service providers, I’ve profiled small business websites 
that sell handmade primitive artwork, elaborate eggshell art, high-quality 
merchandise from Europe, and lots of other products.
	
Electronic commerce (e-commerce) and the web have been around for nearly 
15 years. But new products and ways to sell those products are identified all 
the time. Think of the things that didn’t exist when the first websites were 
created: blogs, Twitter, search ads, podcasts, RSS feeds, MP3s, YouTube, 
DVDs, and eBay. Consider my brother, Mike: For the past couple of years, 
he has operated an online business — lp2cdsolutions, Inc., which converts 
scratchy old records to clean and repackaged CDs. Business has remained 
steady because, like many entrepreneurs, Mike reached a simple conclusion: 
“If I want this product so much, I bet a lot of other people do, too.” He spent 
thousands of dollars on computer hardware and software, and he got really 
good at audio restoration. Now he’s making a modest but steady extra income 
and putting his technical talents to good use. Will he succeed because he has 
me to help him? I don’t think success is guaranteed. It depends on you — your 
energy, dedication, and enthusiasm.

33
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
Your first job, accordingly, is to get in touch with your market (the people 
who’ll be buying your stuff or using your services) and determine how you 
can best meet that market’s needs and demands. After all, you can’t expect 
web surfers to patronize your online business unless you identify services or 
items that they really need. For Ryan Hatfield, who sold general merchandise 
on eBay from 2002 to 2009, a desire to automatically lower his prices to beat 
the competition served as the impetus to create his own company selling his 
product, Price Spectre, online. For more on Ryan, see the “Programmer maps 
plan for success” sidebar, later in this chapter.
A hotbed of commerce
Statistically, the Internet continues to be a 
hotbed of commerce — and shopping online is 
becoming more accepted among consumers. 
Here’s what the experts are saying:
	✓	Forrester Research (www.forrester.
com) says U.S. online retail sales reached 
$155 billion in 2009 and are projected to 
grow to $248 billion by 2014. Business-to-
consumer (B2C) e-commerce still grows 
by double-digit rates each year and is 
projected to climb 10 percent per year 
through 2014. By contrast, the National 
Retail Federation forecasts that traditional 
retail sales will grow more slowly — a 34 
percent increase in 2013.
	✓	Statistics Canada (www.statcan.ca), 
the Canadian government’s central statistical 
agency, reports that e-commerce sales in 
Canada in 2010 amounted to $15.3 billion, 
and consumers placed 13.8 million orders 
online during the year. These sales figures 
represented a 6.8 percent increase from 2007.
	✓	The U.S. Department of Commerce (www.
census.gov/retail/mrts/www/
data/pdf/ec_current.pdf) reports 
that e-commerce sales in the United States 
reached $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 
2012. This was a 4.4 percent increase from 
the previous quarter and a continuation of the 
steady upward trend that e-commerce sales 
in the United States have posted since 2000.
	✓	eMarketer (www.emarketer.com/
Webinar/Retail-Ecommerce-
F o r e c a s t C h a l l e n g i n g -
E c o n o m y - D r i v e s - O n l i n e -
Shopping/4000055) reports that in 
the United Kingdom, e-commerce has 
been relatively immune to the economic 
slowdown, thanks to the many factors that 
make e-commerce attractive to shoppers 
eager to save time and money. These 
include fuel savings, convenience, and easy 
and quick ways to comparison-shop. Other 
countries show a booming online business 
environment: eMarketer predicts that Asia-
Pacific e-commerce sales will surpass those 
of the United States in 2013, growing more 
than 30 percent to over $433 billion.

Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Getting to know the marketplace
The Internet is a worldwide interconnected network of computers to which 
people can connect either from work or home, and through which people can 
communicate via e-mail, receive information from the web, and buy and sell 
items with credit cards or by other methods.
Many people decide to start an online business with little more than a casual 
knowledge of the Internet. But when you decide to get serious about going 
online with a commercial endeavor, it pays to get to know the environment in 
which you plan to be working.
One of your first steps is finding out what it means to do business online and 
determining the best ways for you to fit into the exploding field of e-com­
merce. For example, you need to realize that the Internet is a personal place; 
customers are active, not passive, in the way they absorb information; and 
the Internet was established within a culture of people sharing information 
freely and helping one another. For another, you need to know that although 
the marketplace continues to grow, most of the new growth is expected to 
come from experienced online shoppers rather than people making their first 
purchases online. That means you must address the needs of experienced 
shoppers who are becoming more demanding of web-based merchants.
	
Some of the best places to find out about the culture of the Internet are blogs, 
social networking sites such as Facebook, chat rooms, and sites such as 
Twitter where individuals gather and exchange brief messages online. Visiting 
discussion forums devoted to topics that interest you can be especially help­
ful, and you’re likely to end up participating. Also visit commerce websites 
such as eBay and Amazon.com for ideas and approaches you may want to use.
“Cee-ing” what’s out there
The more information you have about the “four Cs” of the online world, the 
more likely you are to succeed in doing business online:
	
✓	Competitors: Familiarize yourself with other online businesses that 
already do what you want to do. Don’t let their presence intimidate you. 
You’re going to find a different and better way to do what they already do.
	
✓	Customers: Investigate the various kinds of customers who shop online 
and who might visit your site.
	
✓	Culture: Explore the special language and style that people use when 
they communicate.
	
✓	Content: Although websites have become far more visually interesting 
over the years, what truly distinguishes them is their content. Useful 
information attracts repeat visitors, which leads to increased sales.

35
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
When you take a look around the Internet, notice the kinds of goods and ser­
vices that tend to sell in the increasingly crowded, occasionally disorganized, 
and sometimes complex online world. The products that sell best in cyber­
space include these four Cs:
	
✓	Cheap: Online items tend to sell at a discount — at least, that’s what 
shoppers expect.
	
✓	Customized: Anything that’s hard to find, personalized, or unique sells 
well online.
	
✓	Convenient: Shoppers look for items that are easier to buy online than 
at a “real” store, such as a rare book that you can order in minutes from 
Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) or an electronic greeting card that 
you can send online in seconds (www.greeting-cards.com).
	
✓	Compelling: Consumers go online to quickly read news stories from 
sources that are available by subscription, such as newspapers and 
magazines; content that is exciting and eye-catching or that exists online 
only, such as homemade videos on YouTube (www.youtube.com) or 
blogs (a term derived from web logs).
	
Visit one of the tried-and-true indexes to the Internet, such as Yahoo! (www.
yahoo.com), or the search services Google (www.google.com) or Bing 
(www.bing.com). Enter a word or phrase in the site’s home page search box 
that describes the kinds of goods or services you want to provide online. 
Press Enter, and you’ll find out how many existing businesses already do what 
you want to do. Better yet, determine what they don’t do and set a goal of 
meeting that specialized need yourself.
Figuring out how to do it better
After you see what’s already out there, you want to find ways to make your 
business stand out from the crowd. Direct your energies toward making 
your site unique and providing products or services that others don’t offer. 
Offerings that set your online business apart can be as tangible as half-price 
sales, contests, seasonal sales, or freebies. They can also involve making 
your business site higher in quality than others. Maybe you can just provide 
better or more personalized customer service than anyone else.
What if you can’t find other online businesses that do what you want to do? 
Lucky you! In e-commerce, being first often means getting a head start and 
being more successful than latecomers, even if they have more resources 
than you do. (Just ask Jeff Bezos and others who founded the online book­
store Amazon.com.) Don’t be afraid to try something new and outlandish. It 
just might work!

Programmer maps plan for success
Ryan Hatfield persisted through tough economic times to reinvent himself and achieve his vision 
for an online business.
Hatfield was laid off from his job as a software engineer at the start of the economic downturn of 
2008. Using his experience selling general merchandise on eBay, he set out to develop an app for 
eBay sellers called Quantity Manager. For the next year he struggled financially, living on unem­
ployment and trying to find a job while promoting his app.
Hatfield formed a company and won an award for one of his apps, but didn’t have the money to 
travel to a developers’ conference to pick it up in person. He continued to struggle during 2009, at 
one point moving in with his mother. During this period he drew up a series of goals:
1. Break even.
2. Avoid bankruptcy.
3. Keep apartment.
4. Earn a livable wage.
5. Afford the lifestyle I was accustomed to while employed.
6. Reach my old salary.
7. Be able to afford a condo in an upscale high-rise building and never have to work again.
His Quantity Manager app began to generate some income. “In April, one of my Quantity Manager 
subscribers mentioned an idea that eventually turned into Price Spectre,” Hatfield says. “The basic 
concept was an app that would watch a competitor’s listing instead of the seller’s listing. When a 
price was changed, it would change the price of the seller’s listing.”
He kept working on this new software for eBay and for eBay’s related marketplace, half.com, and 
began to offer it on its own website (www.pricespectre.com). He won another software 
award, and this time a family friend enabled him to fly to San Jose, California, to pick it up. This 
gave him the opportunity to network with other developers. He received new attention for his apps, 
and eBay began promoting them. In early 2012 Hatfield reached the sixth goal on his list — he was 
making as much as his old salary, three years and four months after being laid off.
Hatfield now runs PriceSpectre.com, where he sells and manages his app, enabling sellers 
to reprice their merchandise automatically so that their price is lower than the competition’s. His 
program is well received by online merchants.

 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
Step 2: Determine What 
You Have to Offer
Business is all about identifying customers’ needs and figuring out exactly 
what goods or services you’ll provide to meet those needs. It’s the same both 
online and off. (Often, you perform this step before or at the same time you 
scope out what the business needs are and figure out how you can position 
yourself to meet those needs, as I explain in “Step 1: Identify a Need.”)
To determine what you have to offer, make a list of all the items you have 
to put up for sale or all the services you plan to provide to your customers. 
Next, decide not only what goods or services you can provide online, but also 
where to obtain them. Will you create sale items yourself? Will you purchase 
them from another supplier? Jot down your ideas and keep them close at 
hand while you develop your business plan.
What’s the lesson for you? Don’t give up. Find your niche and do it well. Fill needs that aren’t being 
addressed. Get to know others in your field, and do everything you can to promote your product.

38
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
The Internet is a personal, highly interactive medium. Be as specific as possi­
ble with what you plan to do online. Don’t try to do everything; the medium 
favors businesses that do one thing well. The more specific your business, the 
more personal the level of service you can provide to your customers.
Step 3: Come Up with 
a Cyberbusiness Plan
The process of setting goals and objectives and then designing strategies for 
attaining them is essential when starting a new business. What you end up 
with is a business plan. A good business plan applies not only to the startup 
phase, but also to a business’s day-to-day operation. It can also be instrumen­
tal in helping a small business obtain a bank loan.
To set specific goals for your new business, ask yourself these questions:
	
✓	Why do I want to start a business?
	
✓	Why do I want to start it online?
	
✓	What would I want to buy online?
	
✓	What would make me buy it?
These questions may seem simple. But many businesspeople never take the 
time to answer them — to their detriment. And only you can answer these 
questions for yourself. Make sure that you have a clear idea of where you’re 
going so that you can commit to making your venture successful over the 
long haul. (See Chapter 3 for more on setting goals and envisioning your 
business.)
To carry your plan into your daily operations, consider these suggestions:
	
✓	Write a brief description of your company and what you hope to
 accomplish with it.
	
✓	Draw up a marketing strategy. (See Chapter 10 for tips.)
	
✓	Keep track of your finances. (See Chapter 18 for specifics.)
	
Consider using specialized software to help prepare your business plan. 
Programs such as Business Plan Pro by Palo Alto Software (www.paloalto.
com) lead you through the process by asking you a series of questions to 
identify what you want to do. The Standard version of the program retails for 
$99.95. You can find an online version for $19.95 per month.

39
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
	
If you set aside part of your home for business purposes, you may be eligible 
for tax deductions, depending on how much space you use and whether it is 
completely dedicated to your business. (You can’t work in a corner of the 
kitchen but then deduct the entire kitchen, for example.) You can depreciate 
your computers and other business equipment, too. On the other hand, your 
municipality may require you to obtain a license if you operate a business in a 
residential area; check with your local authorities to make sure that you’re on 
the up and up. You can find out more about tax and legal issues, including 
local licensing requirements, in Chapters 17 and 18.

information created by business consultant Jeffrey Edelheit about creating a 
business plan.
Step 4: Assemble Your Hardware 
and Software
One of the great advantages of opening a store on the Internet rather than 
on Main Street is money — or, rather, the lack of it. Rather than rent a space 
and set up furniture and fixtures, you can buy a domain name, sign up with a 
hosting service, create some web pages, and get started with an investment 
of only a few hundred dollars or less.
In addition to your virtual storefront, you have to find a real place to do your 
business. You don’t necessarily have to rent a warehouse or other large 
space. Many online entrepreneurs use a home office or a corner in a room set 
up with a computer, books, and other business-related equipment.
Finding a host for your website
Although doing business online means you don’t have to rent space in a mall 
or open a real, physical store, you do have to set up a virtual space for your 
online business. The most common way to do so is by creating a website and 
finding a company to host it. In cyberspace, your landlord is a web hosting 
service. A web host is a company that, for a fee, makes your site available 24 
hours a day by maintaining it on a special computer — a web server.
A web host can be as large and well known as America Online, which gives 
all its customers a place to create and publish their own web pages. 
Some web-based resources, such as Microsoft Office Live 365 (www.
microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise-home.aspx) and 

40
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Tripod (www.tripod.lycos.com), act as hosting services and provide easy-
to-use website creation tools as well. When my brother decided to create 
his website, he signed up with a company called Webmasters.com, which 
charges him $9.95 per month. Webmasters offers many features, including 
the form shown in Figure 2-1, which enables you to create a simple web page 
without typing any HTML.
In addition, the company that gives you access to the Internet — your 
Internet service provider (ISP) — may also publish your web pages. Make 
sure your host has a fast connection to the Internet and can handle the large 
numbers of simultaneous visits, or hits, that your website is sure to get 
eventually. You can find a detailed description of web hosting options in 
Chapter 4.
	
Figure 2-1: 
Take the 
time to 
choose an 
affordable 
web host 
that makes 
it easy for 
you to cre-
ate and 
maintain 
your site.
	
Assembling the equipment you need
Think of all the equipment you don’t need when you set up shop online. You 
don’t need shelving, a cash register, a parking lot, electricity, a fire protection 
system, a burglar alarm . . . the list goes on and on. You may need some of 
those for your home, but you don’t need to purchase them especially for 
your online business.
For doing business online, your most important piece of equipment is your 
computer, whether it’s a laptop, tablet, or desktop machine. Other hard­
ware, such as a scanner, digital camera, and printer, is essential, too. Make 

41
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
sure that your computer equipment is fast enough and has enough memory 
because you’ll spend a lot of time online: answering e-mail, checking orders, 
revising your website, and marketing your product. Expect to spend any­
where between $800 and $5,000 for equipment if you don’t have any to begin 
with.
	
Remember that online shoppers expect a higher level of customer service. 
You don’t want substandard equipment to slow down your responses and per­
formance. It pays to shop wisely and get the best setup you can afford up front 
so that you don’t have to purchase upgrades later on. (For more suggestions 
on buying business hardware and software, see Chapter 3.)
Keeping track of your inventory
It’s easy to overlook stocking inventory and 
setting up systems for processing orders when 
you’re just starting out. But as Lucky Boyd, an 
entrepreneur who started MyTexasMusic (www.
mytexasmusic.com) and other websites, 
pointed out to me, make sure that you have a 
“big vision” early in the process of creating your 
site. In his case, it meant having a site that could 
handle lots of visitors and make purchasing easy. 
In other cases, it might mean having sufficient 
inventory to meet demand. Having too many 
items for sale is preferable to not having enough. 
“We operated on a low budget in the beginning, 
and we didn’t have the inventory that people 
wanted,” the entrepreneur commented. “People 
online get impatient if they have to wait for things 
too long. Make sure you have the goods you 
advertise. Plan to be successful.” 
Jinele Boyd, co-founder of MyTexasMusic, 
adds that they treat every order with urgency 
and make an effort to ship the same day the 
order arrives — or no longer than 36 hours after 
receiving it. “We also hand-write a note inside 
every box,” she says. “We get e-mails and calls 
all the time from people telling us how amazed 
they were that a ‘real person’ handled their order 
and took the time to hand-address the boxes.”
Many online businesses keep track of their 
inventory (and thus fulfill orders quickly) by using 
a database that’s connected to their website. 
When someone orders a product from the 
website, that order is recorded automatically in 
the database, which then produces an order for 
replacement stock. Lucky and his staff originally 
used a version of Microsoft Excel with database 
functions to track inventory. They’ve since 
moved to a PHP/SQL system according to Boyd. 
“We still ship the same day, and we never have 
something for sale on the site that’s not in stock. 
Customers hate to add something to their cart 
only to find that it’s out of stock.”
In this kind of arrangement, the database serves 
as a so-called back end or back office to the 
web-based storefront. This is a sophisticated 
arrangement that’s not for beginners. However, 
if orders and inventory get to be too much for 
you to handle, consider hiring a web developer 
to set up such a system for you.
Other “back end” features such as packing and 
shipping are just as important. Boyd coped with 
increases in shipping costs by raising shipping 
costs to his customers by 14 cents on the first 
item and just 1 cent on all additional items — 
thus encouraging increased sales. He also 
found a lighter box that cut shipping charges by 
17 cents per order. “It really pays to research 
the little things,” he says. “They add up quickly.”

42
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Choosing business software
For the most part, the programs you need in order to operate an online 
business are the same as the software you use to surf the Internet. You do, 
however, need to have a wider variety of tools than you would use for simple 
information gathering.
Because you’ll be in the business of information providing now, as well as 
information gathering, you need programs such as the following:
	
✓	A web page editor: These programs, also called web page creation tools 
or web page authoring tools, make it easy for you to format text, add 
images, and design web pages without having to master HTML.
	
✓	Graphics software: If you decide to create your business website your­
self rather than find someone to do it for you, you need a program that 
can help you draw or edit images to include on your site.
	
✓	Storefront software: You can purchase software (or pay a monthly fee) 
that leads you through the process of creating a full-fledged online busi­
ness and getting your pages on the web.
	
✓	RSS feed software: RSS (Real Simple Syndication) is a way of formatting 
web content in the form of an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file so 
it can be read quickly and easily by people who subscribe to it. You can 
find instructions on how to create an RSS feed and a list of feed creation 
tools at www.rss-specifications.com/create-rss-feed.htm.
	
✓	Accounting programs: You can write your expenses and income on a 
sheet of paper. But it’s far more efficient to use software that acts as a 
spreadsheet, helps you with billing, and even calculates sales tax.
	
Some businesspeople (such as Judy Vorfeld, whom I profile in Chapter 5) 
prefer blog software rather than a full-blown web editor to create their web­
site’s content. I also use the blogging program WordPress to create content 
for my personal website (www.gregholden.com).
Step 5: Find People to Help You
Conducting an online business does involve relatively new technologies, but 
they aren’t impossible to figure out. In fact, the technology is becoming more 
accessible all the time. Many people who start online businesses find out 
how to create web pages and promote their companies by reading books, 
attending classes, or networking with friends and colleagues. Of course, just 
because you can do it all doesn’t mean that you have to. Often, you’re better 
off hiring help, either to advise you in areas where you aren’t as strong or 

43
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
simply to help you tackle the growing workload — and help your business 
grow at the same time.
Hiring technical experts
Spending some money upfront to hire professionals who can point you in 
the right direction can help you maintain an effective web presence for years 
to come. Many businesspeople who usually work alone (myself included) 
hire knowledgeable individuals to do design or programming work that they 
would find impossible to tackle otherwise. You’ll find many technical experts 
eager to help you, for a reasonable price, at the freelance marketplace Elance 
(www.elance.com).
	
Don’t be reluctant to hire professional help to get your business online. The 
web is full of development firms that perform several related functions: pro­
viding customers with web access, helping to create websites, and hosting 
sites on their servers. The expense for such services may be considerable at 
first. The programming involved in setting up databases, creating purchasing 
systems, and programming web pages can run over $10,000 for particularly 
extensive websites, but the investment can pay off in the long term. Choose 
a designer carefully and check out sites he or she has done before. Tell the 
designer your plan for the organization and content, and spell out clearly what 
you want each page to do. Another area where you may want to find help is in 
computer and network maintenance. You need someone who knows how to 
troubleshoot and keep your computer running. Find out whether you have a 
computer expert in your neighborhood who is available on short notice.
	
If you do find a business partner, make sure that the person’s abilities bal­
ance your own. If you’re great at sales and public relations, for example, find a 
writer or web page designer to partner with.
Gathering your team members
Many entrepreneurial businesses are family affairs. A successful eBay busi­
ness, Maxwell Street Market (www.maxwellstreetmarket.com), is run by 
a husband-and-wife team as well as family members and neighbors. The hus­
band does the buying, the wife prepares sales descriptions, and the others 
help with packing and shipping. John Moen found some retired teachers to 
help answer the geography questions that come into his WorldAtlas.com 
site. The convenience of the Internet means that these geography experts 
can log on to the site’s e-mail inbox from their respective homes and answer 
questions quickly.

44
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Early on, when you have plenty of time to do planning, you probably won’t 
feel a pressing need to hire others to help you. Many people don’t seek help 
until they have a deadline to meet or are in a financial crunch. Waiting to 
seek help is okay — as long as you realize that you will need help, sooner or 
later.
	
Of course, you don’t have to hire family and friends, but you must find people 
who are reliable and can make a long-term commitment to your project. Keep 
these things in mind:
	
✓	Pick someone who already exhibits experience with computers and the 
Internet.
	
✓	Always review a résumé, get at least three references, and ask for sam­
ples of the candidate’s work.
	
✓	Pick someone who responds promptly and courteously, and provides 
the talents you need.
	
✓	If your only contact is by phone and e-mail, references are even more 
important.
Step 6: Construct a Website
Although you can make a living buying and selling full time on eBay, a web­
site is still likely to be the focus of your online business. Fortunately, web­
sites are becoming easier to create. You don’t have to know a line of HTML to 
create an effective web page. Chapter 5 walks you through the specific tasks 
involved in organizing and designing web pages. Chapter 5 also gives you tips 
on making your web pages content-rich and interactive.
	
Make your business easy to find online. Pick a web address (also known as 
a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator) that’s easy to remember. You can pur­
chase a short domain-name alias, such as www.company.com, to replace a 
longer one like www.internetprovider.com/~username/companyname/
index.html. If the ideal dot-com (.com) name isn’t available, you can choose 
one of the newer domain suffixes such as .biz. See Chapter 4 for more infor­
mation on domain name aliases.
If the perfect domain name for your business is already taken, consider 
adding a short, easy-to-remember prefix or suffix to your existing company 
name. For example, if your company name is something common, such as 
Housing Services, try fairly recognizable names such as housing.com and 
housingservices.com. That way, the web address is still easy to recall and 
associate with your business. Or create a “cyber” name that’s related to your 
real name. The Art Institute of Chicago can’t use www.artinstitute.edu 
because it’s already taken by a group of Art Institutes to which it belongs. So 
the Art Institute of Chicago created the short abbreviation www.artic.edu — 
which I, for one, find easy to remember.

45
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
	
Spellings that differ from common English, such as niteline.com, are diffi­
cult for people to remember — and people who only hear the name spoken 
won’t know how to type it or search for it properly. Also avoid hyphens in 
your domain name, such as in WBX-TV-Bozo@somestation.com, because, 
again, their placement isn’t obvious.
Making your site content-rich
The textual component of a website is what attracts visitors and keeps them 
coming back. The more useful information and compelling content you pro­
vide, the more visits your site will receive. I’m talking about words, headings, 
or images that induce visitors to interact with your site in some way. You can 
make your content compelling in a number of ways:
	
✓	Provide a call to action, such as Click Here! or Buy Now!
	
✓	Explain how the reader benefits by clicking a link and exploring your 
site. (“Visit our News and Specials page to find out how to win 
500 frequent flyer miles.”)
	
✓	Briefly and concisely state your business and its mission.
	
✓	Scan or use a digital camera to capture images of your sale items (or of 
the services you provide) as I describe in Chapter 5 and post them on a 
web page called Products.
	
Don’t forget the personal touch when connecting with your customers’ needs. 
Online shoppers don’t get to meet their merchants in person, so anything you 
can tell about yourself helps to personalize the process and put your visitors 
at ease. For example, one of Lucky Boyd’s primary goals for his MyTexasMusic 
site (www.mytexasmusic.com) is to encourage people to become members 
so they’re more likely to visit on a regular basis. His photos of music fans (see 
Figure 2-2) personalize the site and remind visitors that they’re members of a 
community of music lovers. Let your cybervisitors know that they’re dealing 
with real people, not remote machines and computer programs.
	
Peeking in on other businesses’ websites to pick up ideas and see how they 
handle similar issues is a natural practice. In cyberspace, you can visit plenty 
of businesses that are comparable to yours from the comfort of your home 
office, and the trip takes only minutes.
Establishing a graphic identity
When you start your first business on the web, you have to convince custom­
ers that you’re competent and professional. One factor that helps build trust 
is a graphic identity. A site with an identity looks a certain way. For example, 
take a look at Figure 2-3 as well as Figure 2-4, later in this chapter. Both pages 

46
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
are from the Graphic Maps website (www.graphicmaps.com). Notice that 
each has the same white background, the same distinctive and simple logo, 
and both have similar heading styles. Using such elements consistently from 
page to page creates an identity that gives your business credibility and 
helps viewers find what they’re looking for.

Step 7: Set Up a System 
for Processing Sales
Many businesses unprepared for success go online. They don’t have systems 
in place for finalizing sales, shipping purchased goods in a timely manner, or 
tracking finances and inventory.
An excellent way to plan for success is to set up ways to track your business 
finances and create a secure purchasing environment for your online custom­
ers. That way, you can build on your success rather than be surprised by it.
Providing a means for secure transactions
Getting paid is the key to survival as well as success. However, the payment 
process for an online business isn’t always straightforward. Make your web­
site a safe place for customers to pay you. Provide different payment options 
and build a level of trust any way you can.
	
Some people are squeamish about submitting their credit card numbers 
online. And beginning businesspeople are understandably intimidated by the 
requirements of processing credit card transactions. In the early stages, you 
can simply create a form for customers to print out and mail to you along with 
a check. (The Graphic Maps site is successful without having an online credit 
card system; clients phone in their orders.)
When you can accept credit cards, make your customers feel at ease by 
explaining what measures you’re taking to ensure that their information is 
secure. Such measures include signing up for an account with a web host that 
provides a secure server, a computer that uses software to encrypt data and 
uses digital documents, or certificates, to ensure its identity. (See Chapters 6 
and 7 for more on Internet security and secure shopping systems.)
Becoming a credit card merchant
E-commerce brings to mind visions of online forms and credit card data 
that’s transmitted over the Internet. Do you have to provide such service to 
run a successful online business? Not necessarily. Being a credit card mer­
chant makes life easier for your customers, to be sure, but it also adds com­
plications and extra costs to your operation.

48
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
The traditional way to become a credit card merchant is to apply to a bank. 
Small and home-based businesses can have difficulty getting their applica­
tions approved. Alternatively, you can sign up with a company that provides 
electronic shopping cart services and credit card payments online to small 
businesses. See Chapter 7 for suggestions. You can also accept credit card 
payments through the popular electronic payment service PayPal. Your cus­
tomers have to have an account with PayPal and have their purchase price 
debited from their credit card accounts, but the service is popular enough 
that many of your online shoppers are probably members already.
If you do get the go-ahead from a bank to become a credit card merchant, 
you have to pay it a discount rate, which is a fee (typically 2 to 3 percent of 
each transaction). You sometimes have to pay a monthly premium charge of 
$10 to $25 as well. Besides that, you may need special software or hardware 
to accept credit card payments.
	
To maximize your sales by reaching users who either don’t have credit cards 
or don’t want to use them on the Internet, provide low-tech alternatives (such 
as toll-free phone numbers and fax numbers) so that your customers can pro­
vide you with information using more familiar technologies.
	
After much searching, Lucky Boyd signed with a company called Goemerchant 
(www.goemerchant.com), which provides him with the payment systems 
that many online shoppers recognize when they want to make a purchase. 
First, Goemerchant has a shopping cart — a set of pages that acts as an elec­
tronic holding area for items before they are purchased. Next, it has a secure 
way for people to make electronic purchases by providing online forms, where 
they can safely enter credit card and other personal information. The note 
stating that the payment area is protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption tells people that even if a criminal intercepts their credit card data, 
he can’t read it.
	
Safeguarding your customers’ personal information is important, but you also 
need to safeguard your business. Many online businesses get burned by bad 
guys who submit fraudulent credit card information. If you don’t verify the 
information and submit it to your financial institution for processing, you’re 
liable for the cost. Strongly consider signing up with a service that handles 
credit card verification for you in order to cut down on lost revenue.
Keeping your books straight
In the simplest sense, “keeping your books” means recording all financial 
activities that pertain to your business, including any expenses you incur, 
all the income you receive, as well as your equipment and tax deductions. 

49
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
The financial side of running a business also entails creating reports, such 
as profit and loss statements, that banks require if you apply for a loan. Such 
reports not only help meet financial institutions’ needs, but also provide you 
with essential information about how your business is doing at any time.
You can record all this information the old-fashioned way, by writing it down 
in ledgers and journals, or you can use accounting software. (See Chapter 
18 for information about easy-to-use accounting packages that are great for 
financial novices.) Because you’re making a commitment to use a computer 
on a regular basis by starting an online business, it’s only natural for you to 
use a computer to keep your books, too. Accounting software can help you 
keep track of expenses and provide information that may save you some 
headaches at tax time.
	
After you save your financial data on your hard drive, make backups so that 
you don’t lose information you need to do business. See Chapter 6 for ways to 
back up and protect your files.
Step 8: Provide Personal Service
Because the Internet runs on wires, cables, and computer chips, it may not 
seem like a place for the personal touch. But technology didn’t actually 
create the Internet and all of its content; people did. In fact, the Internet is a 
great place to provide your clients and customers with outstanding personal 
customer service.
In many cases, offering customer service on the Internet means you are avail­
able and respond quickly to all inquiries. You check your e-mail regularly, 
you make sure that you respond within a day, you cheerfully solve problems 
and hand out refunds if needed. By helping your customers, you help your­
self, too. You build loyalty as well as credibility among your clientele. For 
many small businesses, the key to competing effectively with larger busi­
nesses is by providing superior customer service. See Chapter 8 for more 
ideas on how you can do this.
Selling by sharing your expertise
Your knowledge and experience are among your most valuable commodities. 
So you may be surprised when I suggest that you give them away for free. 
Why? It’s a “try before you buy” concept. Helping people for free builds your 
credibility and makes them more likely to pay for your services down the 
road.

50
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
When your business is online, you can easily communicate what you know 
about your field and make your knowledge readily available. One way is to 
set up a web page that presents the basics about your company and your 
field of interest in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Another 
technique is to become a virtual publisher/editor and create your own news­
letter in which you write about what’s new with your company and topics 
related to your work. See Chapter 8 for more on communicating your exper­
tise through FAQs, newsletters, and advanced e-mail techniques.
	
My brother was skeptical when I recommended that he include a page of 
technical information explaining exactly what equipment he uses and describ­
ing the steps involved in audio restoration. He didn’t think anyone would be 
interested; he also didn’t want to give away his “trade secrets.” Au contraire, 
mon frère! People who surf the Internet gobble up all the technical details they 
can find. The more you wow them with the names and model numbers of your 
expensive equipment, not to mention the work you go through to restore their 
old records, the more they’ll trust you. And trust gets people to place an order 
with you.
Making your site a go-to resource
Many ontrepreneurs (online entrepreneurs) succeed by making their websites 
not only places for sales and promotion, but also indispensable resources full 
of useful hyperlinks and other information so customers want to visit again 
and again. For example, the Graphic Maps website mentioned earlier in this 
chapter acts as a resource for anyone who has a question about geography. 
To promote the site, John Moen gives away free maps for nonprofit orga­
nizations, operates a daily geography contest with a $100 prize to the first 
person with the correct answer (as shown in Figure 2-4), and answers e-mail 
promptly. “I feel strongly that the secret on the web is to provide a solution 
to a problem and, for the most part, to do it for free,” he suggests.
	
The MyTexasMusic site (www.mytexasmusic.com) uses the concept of 
membership to strengthen its connections with customers. The main purpose 
of the site is to make money by selling the works of Texas musicians as well as 
tickets to concerts. But to make money, you need to give people a reason to 
visit your site on a regular basis. When people are members rather than shop­
pers, they feel connected and privileged.
“Memberships work for us in two ways,” comments Boyd. “Every vendor who 
consigns to us is a member. Customers can also be members. Membership 
invokes the idea of ownership, and everyone likes to feel as though they are a 
part owner of the process.”

51
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
	
Figure 2-4: 
This site 
uses free 
art, a mail-
ing list, and 
daily prizes 
to drum up 
business.
	
The site encourages music lovers and musicians to become members: They 
provide information about who they are and where they live, and they create 
their own usernames and passwords so that they can access special con­
tent and perform special functions on the site, such as selling their own CDs 
or posting song clips. For an online business, the names and addresses of 
people who visit and who don’t necessarily make purchases is a gold mine of 
information. The business can use the contact information to send members 
special offers and news releases; the more frequently contact is maintained, 
the more likely those casual shoppers are to eventually turn into paying 
customers.
The concept of membership also builds a feeling of community among cus­
tomers. By turning the e-commerce site into a meeting place for members 
who love Texas musicians, those members make new friends and have a 
reason to visit the site on a regular basis. Community building is one way in 
which commerce on the web differs from traditional brick-and-mortar selling, 
and it’s something you should consider, too.
Another way to encourage customers to congregate at your site is to create 
a discussion area. In Chapter 8, I show you how to provide a discussion page 
right on your own website.

52
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Becoming a super e-mailer
E-mail is, in my humble opinion, the single most important marketing tool 
that you can use to boost your online business. Becoming an expert e-mail 
user increases your contacts and provides you with new sources of 
support, too.
The two best and easiest e-mail strategies are the following:
	
✓	Check your e-mail as often as possible.
	
✓	Respond to e-mail inquiries immediately.
Additionally, you can e-mail inquiries about co-marketing opportunities to 
other websites similar to your own. Ask other online business owners if they 
will provide links to your site in exchange for you providing links to theirs. 
And always include a signature file with your message that includes the name 
of your business and a link to your business site. See Chapter 8 for more 
information on using e-mail effectively to build and maintain relations with 
your online customers.
	
I encourage you to use e-mail primarily for one-to-one communication. The 
Internet excels at bringing individuals together. Mailing lists and newsletters 
can use e-mail effectively for marketing, too.
	
I’m not encouraging you to send out mass quantities of unsolicited commercial 
e-mail, a practice that turns off almost all consumers and that can get you 
in trouble with the law, too. Spam artists have been convicted, and the sen­
tences are getting more severe. In April 2005, a man was sentenced to nine 
years in prison for masking his identity while bombarding Internet users 
with millions of unsolicited e-mail messages (www.pcworld.com/news/
article/0,aid,118493,00.asp). In November 2009, four individuals were 
sentenced in a Detroit federal court for their roles in an international stock 
fraud scheme involving the illegal use of spam e-mails, which violated the 
CAN-SPAM Act.
In November 2009 Alan M. Ralsky, 64, and Scott Bradley, 48, both of West 
Bloomfield, Michigan, were sentenced to 51 months and 40 months in prison, 
respectively, for conspiring to commit wire fraud, mail fraud, violating the 
CAN-SPAM Act, and engaging in money laundering. Ralsky and Bradley 
were also each sentenced to five years of supervised release following their 
respective prison terms, and were each ordered to forfeit $250,000 that the 
United States seized from them in December 2007.

53
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
Step 9: Alert the Media 
and Everyone Else
To be successful, small businesses need to get the word out to the people 
who are likely to purchase what they have to offer. If this group turns out to 
be a narrow market, so much the better; the Internet is great for connecting 
to niche markets that share a common interest. (See Chapter 8 for more on 
locating your most likely customers on the Internet and figuring out how best 
to communicate with them.)
The Internet provides many unique and effective ways for small businesses 
to advertise, including search services, e-mail, newsgroups, and electronic 
mailing lists. It’s encouraging to note, though, that you don’t always have to 
depend on high-tech solutions to get publicity. “We still do not spend money 
on print advertising — and we have more business than we can handle from 
word of mouth,” says Jinele Boyd of MyTexasMusic.
Listing your site with Internet 
search services
How, exactly, do you get listed on search engines such as Yahoo! and Lycos? 
Frankly, it’s getting more difficult. Many of the big search services charge for 
listings (Yahoo!’s fees for commercial listings in its directory are particularly 
steep). But some let you contribute a listing for free, though there’s no guar­
antee if or when you’ll see your site included in their databases.
You can increase the chances that search services list your site by includ­
ing special keywords and site descriptions in the titles, body text, and HTML 
commands for your web pages. You place some of these keywords after 
a special HTML command (the <meta> tag), making them invisible to the 
casual viewer of your site. Turn to Chapter 11 for details.
	
Both John Moen and Lucky Boyd have created multiple websites for different 
purposes. One purpose is to reach different markets. Another is to improve 
rankings on search engines, such as Google, by linking one site to several 
other sites; the site is considered more popular, and its ranking rises. See 
Chapter 11 for more on this and other tips on getting listed by Internet search 
engines.

54
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Reaching the entire Internet
Your website may be the cornerstone of your business, but if nobody knows 
it’s out there, it can’t help you generate sales. Perhaps the most familiar form 
of online advertising is banner ads, those little electronic billboards that seem 
to show up on every popular web page.
But banner advertising can be expensive and may not be the best way for a 
small business to advertise online. In fact, the most effective marketing for 
some businesses hasn’t been traditional banner advertising or newspaper/
magazine placements. Rather, the e-marketers who run those businesses 
target electronic bulletin boards and mailing lists where people already dis­
cuss the products being sold. You can post notices on the bulletin boards 
where your potential customers congregate, notifying them that your ser­
vices are now available. (Make sure that the board in question permits such 
solicitation before you do so, or you’ll chase away the very customers you 
want.)
This sort of direct, one-to-one marketing may seem tedious, but it’s often the 
best way to develop a business on the Internet. Reach out to your potential 
customers and strike up an individual, personal relationship with each one.
Chapter 10 has everything you need to know about advertising with mailing 
lists, newsgroups, and even traditional banner ads.
Step 10: Review, Revise, and Improve
For any long-term endeavor, you need to establish standards by which you 
can judge its success or failure. You must decide for yourself what you con­
sider success to be. After a period of time, take stock of where your business 
is and then take steps to do even better.
Taking stock
After 12 months online, Lucky Boyd took stock. His site was online, but he 
wasn’t getting many page views. He redid the site, increased the number 
of giveaways, and traffic to his site increased. Now he makes music down­
loads available on his site; he also redid his web pages with the Hypertext 
Preprocessor (PHP) programming language. He has also expanded to include 
a business presence on the popular social networking sites MySpace, 
Facebook, and Twitter.

55
 Chapter 2: Opening Your Online Business
	
HTML is a markup language: It identifies parts of a web page that need to be 
formatted as headings, text, images, and so on. It can be used to include 
scripts, such as those written in the JavaScript language. But by creating his 
pages from scratch with PHP, Boyd can make his site more dynamic and 
easier to update. He can rotate random images, process forms, and compile 
statistics that track his visitors by using PHP scripts, for example. He can 
design web pages in a modular way so that they can be redesigned and 
revised more quickly than with HTML.
Your business may do so well that you can reinvest in it by buying new 
equipment or increasing your services. You may even be able to give some­
thing back to nonprofits and those in need. The young founders of The 
Chocolate Farm set up a scholarship fund designed to bring young people 
from other countries to the United States to help them find out about free 
enterprise. (See the upcoming case study for more.) Perhaps you’ll have 
enough money left over to reward yourself, too — as if being able to tell 
everyone “I own an online business” isn’t reward enough!
	
Money is only one form of success. Plenty of entrepreneurs are online for rea­
sons other than making money. That said, it is important from time to time to 
evaluate how well you’re doing financially. Accounting software, such as the 
programs I describe in Chapter 18, makes it easy to check your revenues on a 
daily or weekly basis. The key is to establish the goals you want to reach and 
develop measurements so that you know when and if you reach those goals.
Updating your data
Getting your business online now and then updating your site regularly is 
better than waiting to unveil the perfect website all at one time. In fact, seeing 
your site improve and grow is one of the best things about going online. Over 
time, you can create contests, strike up cooperative relationships with other 
businesses, and add more background information about your products and 
services.
	
Consider The Chocolate Farm, a business that was owned and operated for 
ten years by siblings Evan and Elise MacMillan of Denver, Colorado. The busi­
ness was started when Elise was just 10 years old and Evan was 13. They 
began by selling chocolates with a farm theme, such as chocolate cows; later, 
they focused on creating custom chocolates — sweets made to order for busi­
nesses, many of which bore the company’s logo. Evan and Elise eventually 
oversaw the work of 50 full- and part-time employees.
Today, Evan reports that he and his sister decided to wrap up their involve­
ment with The Chocolate Farm. It was sold to another chocolate company. 

56
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
“We considered the exit a success,” says Evan. He recalls how much the proj­
ect brought to their lives: an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show and cov­
erage in The Wall Street Journal. He adds: “And yes, it did help us with college 
expenses.” Elise is a student at Stanford University, studying computer music 
and art. Evan graduated in the spring of 2009 and began work on his fifth 
startup company (he co-founded and operated a couple of energy software 
companies while still a college student). “Though we are out of the business, 
we still love chocolate, and Elise and I make things together on weekends.”
Businesses on the web need to evaluate and revise their practices on a regu­
lar basis. Lucky Boyd studies reports of where visitors come from before 
they reach his site, and what pages they visit on the site, so that he can 
attract new customers. Online business is a process of trial and error. Some 
promotions work better than others. The point is that it needs to be an ongo­
ing process and a long-term commitment. Taking a chance and profiting from 
your mistakes is better than not trying in the first place.

S

tarting your own online business is like rehabbing an old house — 
something I’ve been doing for years. Both projects involve a series of 
recognizable phases:
	
✓	The idea phase: You tell people about your great idea. They hear the 
enthusiasm in your voice, nod their heads, and say something like, 
“Good luck.” They’ve seen you in this condition before and know how it 
usually turns out.
	
✓	The decision phase: Undaunted, you begin honing your plan. You read 
books (like this one), ask questions, and shop around until you find just 
the right tools and materials. Of course, when the project is staring you 
down in your own workshop, you may start to panic, asking yourself 
whether you’re really up for the task. Don’t worry: You are!
	
✓	The assembly phase: Still determined to proceed, you forge ahead. 
You plug in your tools and go to work. Drills spin, sparks fly, and metal 
moves.
	
✓	The test-drive phase: One fine day, out of the dust and fumes, your 
masterpiece emerges. You invite everyone over to enjoy the fruits of 
your labor. All those who were skeptical before are now full of admiration. 
You get enjoyment from your project for years to come.

58
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
If rehabbing a house doesn’t work for you, think about restoring an antique 
auto, planning an anniversary party, or devising a mountain-climbing excur­
sion in Tibet. The point is that starting an online business is a project like any 
other — one that you can understand and accomplish in stages. Right now, 
you’re at the first stage of launching your new cyberbusiness. Your creativity 
is working overtime. You have some rough sketches that only a mother could 
love.
This chapter helps you get from idea to reality. Your first step is to imagine 
how you want your business to look and feel. Then you can begin to develop 
and implement strategies for achieving your dream. You have a big advan­
tage over those who started new businesses a few years ago: You have plenty 
of models to show you what works and what doesn’t.
While you travel along the path from idea to reality, you must also consider 
properly equipping your online business — just like you would have to equip 
a traditional brick-and-mortar business. One of the many exciting aspects 
of launching a business online, however, is the absence of much overhead 
(that is, operating expenses). Many non-cyberspace businesses must take out 
loans to pay rent, remodel their storefronts, and purchase store fixtures. In 
contrast, the primary overhead for an online business is computer hardware 
and software. Although it’s great if you can afford top-of-the-line equipment, 
you’ll be happy to know that the latest bells and whistles aren’t absolutely 
necessary to get a business site online and maintain it effectively. But to 
streamline the technical aspects of connecting to the online world and creat­
ing a business presence, some investment may be a wise and profitable idea.
	
Don’t rush into signing a contract to get your online business hosted. I’ve 
encountered experienced businesspeople who prepaid for a year’s worth of 
web hosting with nothing else yet in place. Be sure you know your options 
and have a business strategy, no matter how simple, before you sign anything. 
Websites are important, but they’re not all there is to creating a presence and 
branding yourself, as you discover throughout this book.
Mapping Out Your Online Business
How do you get to square one? Start by imagining the kind of business that 
is your ultimate goal. This is the time to indulge in some brainstorming. 
Envisioning your business is a creative way of asking the all-important ques­
tions: Why do I want to go into business online? What are my goals? Table 3-1 
illustrates some possible goals and suggests how to achieve them. By envi­
sioning the final result you want to achieve, you can determine your online 
business goals.

best source of information on how to get there. Sometimes, spending just half 
an hour surfing the Internet can stimulate your own mental network. Find 
sites with qualities you want to emulate. Throughout this book, I suggest 
business sites you can visit to find good models to follow.
Don’t feel obligated to keep moving in the same direction all the time, either. 
One of the many advantages of starting an online business is the ability to 
change direction with relative ease.
	
Because you’re not unlike your target audience, your likes and dislikes have 
value. Keep a low-tech pencil and pad of paper handy each time you surf for 
ideas. Make a list as you go of what you find appealing and jot down notes on 
logos, designs, and text. That way, you’ll have raw data to draw upon when 
you begin to refine what you want to do.

Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Making your mark
The web and other parts of the online world have undergone a population 
explosion that shows no signs of slowing. According to the Internet Systems 
Consortium Domain Survey (www.isc.org/solutions/survey), in July 
2012, 908.5 million computers that hosted websites were connected to the 
Internet, compared with 625.2 million in 2009, 439.3 million in 2006, and 285 
million in 2004. Seventeen percent of those computers host web addresses 
that end with the commercial (.com) designation.
As an ontrepreneur (online entrepreneur), your goal is to stand out from the 
crowd — or to “position yourself in the marketplace,” as business consul­
tants like to say. Consider the following tried-and-true suggestions if you 
want your website to be a go-to place:
	
✓	Pursue something you know well. Experience adds value to the infor­
mation that you provide. In the online world, expertise sells.
	
✓	Make a statement. On your website, include a mission statement that 
clearly identifies what you do, the customers you hope to reach, and 
how you’re different from your competitors. On your blog, give your 
opinions. On discussion groups, share your knowledge.
	
✓	Give something away for free. Giveaways and promotions are sure­
fire ways to gain attention and develop a loyal customer base. In fact, 
entire websites are devoted to providing free stuff online, such as see 
FreeNapkin (www.freenapkin.com). Or read the Fox News article 
describing five sources of freebies (www.foxnews.com). You don’t have 
to give away an actual product; you could also offer words of wisdom 
based on your training and experience.
	
✓	Find your niche. Web space is a great place to pursue niche marketing. 
In fact, it often seems that the quirkier the item, the better it sells. Some 
of the most successful sellers I know deal in things like flavored coffee, 
toy train accessories, fountain pens, women’s purses, and the like. Don’t 
be afraid to target a narrow audience and direct all your sales efforts to 
a small group of devoted followers.
	
✓	Do something you love. The more you love your business, the more 
time and effort you’re apt to put into it and, therefore, the more likely 
it is to be successful. Such businesses take advantage of the Internet’s 
worldwide reach, which makes it easy for people with the same interests 
to gather at the same virtual location.
	
Scan through the list of Inc. magazine’s Top 5000 privately held companies 
(www.inc.com/inc5000), and you find many examples of businesses that 
follow all these strategies:

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
	
✓	The number 11 company for 2012, Nasty Gal (www.nastygal.com), 
was started by a lone entrepreneur selling vintage clothing, shoes, and 
accessories on eBay.
	
✓	The number 17 company for 2012, CampusBookRentals (www.campus
bookrentals.com), does what it says, renting textbooks to 50 million 
students across the country.
	
✓	The number 4 company for 2009, Perfect Fitness (https://perfect
online.com), has a niche selling fitness equipment online.
	
Gather ideas for innovative websites by scouring Google News for the latest 
business success stories. For example, when I did a search for the term “busi­
ness success story,” I found an article about Tim Brennan, who does “content 
marketing.”

an-ebook-why-itll-work-and-how-0321290
Tim marketed his business by writing and selling an e-book on chess tactics 
on Amazon.com. Do your own search, and write down ideas for your own 
sales and marketing efforts.
Evaluating commercial websites
How is your business the same as others? How is it different? Your customers 
will ask these questions, so you need to ask them also. Commercial websites — 
those whose Internet addresses end with .com or .biz — are the fastest-
growing segment of the Internet. This is the area you’re entering, too. The 
trick is to be comfortable with the size and level of complexity of a business 
that’s right for you. In general, your options are
	
✓	A big commercial website: The web means big business, and plenty of 
big companies create websites with the primary goal of supplementing 
a product or business that’s already well known and well established. 
Just a few examples are the Ragu website (www.ragu.com), the Pepsi 
World website (www.pepsiworld.com), and the Toyota website (www.
toyota.com). True, corporations with thousands of dollars to throw 
into web design created these commercial websites, but you can still 
look at them to get ideas for your own site.
	
✓	A midsize site: Many a small business of 10 to 12 employees makes good 
use of the web to provide customer service, disseminate information, 
and post a sales catalog. You may find some features that midsize com­
panies use, such as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page or a sales 
catalog, useful to you. Look at the Golfballs.com site (www.golfballs.
com) for good ideas.

✓	A site that’s just right: You don’t need business experience to guarantee 
success on the Web. You can also start out as a single person, couple, or 
family doing business. In fact, the rest of this book is devoted to helping 
you produce a fine, homegrown entrepreneurial business. This chapter 
gets you off to a good start by examining the different kinds of busi­
nesses you can launch online and some business goals you can set for 
yourself.
Taste-Testing Flavors of 
Online Businesses
If you’re easily overstimulated, you may feel you need blinders when you 
comb the Internet for ideas to give your online business a definite shape and 
form. Use the following brief descriptions of online businesses to create cat­
egories of interest and then zero in on the ones that are most useful to you.
Selling consumer products
Leading Internet research firm Forrester Research (www.internetretailer.
com) predicts that despite slowdowns in the economy, total e-commerce 
sales in the United States will continue to grow to $262 billion by the end of 
2013, an increase of 13.4 percent over 2012’s figures. The online marketplace 
is a great venue if you have products to sell (such as auto parts, antiques, 
jewelry, or food). The web has always attracted those looking for unique 
items or something customized just for them. Consider taking your wares 
online if any of the following applies to you:
	
✓	Your products are high in quality.
	
✓	You create your own products; for example, you design dishes, make 
fudge, or sell gift baskets of wine.
	
✓	You specialize in some aspects of your product that larger businesses 
can’t achieve. Perhaps you sell regional foods, such as Chicago deep-
dish pizza or live lobsters from Maine.
I have always admired the customization tools available on the site of 
Timbuk2 (www.timbuk2.com), which manufactures bicycle messenger 
bags and sells them directly to the public. Other sites don’t sell consumer 
goods directly, but they support consumer goods. For example, ice cream 
may not be good for my waistline, but I often go to the Ben and Jerry’s 

63
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
website (www.benjerry.com) just to drool. These guys are entrepreneurs 
just like you, and I like their website as well as their products. The website 
focuses on the unique flavors and the high quality of their ice cream, as well 
as their personalities and business standards. And on the day this book’s 
editor visited, it was a free cone day; they were doing a giveaway, another 
promotional strategy mentioned earlier.
So c’mon in, the water’s fine. The key is to find your niche, as many small-but-
successful businesses have done. Use your web space to declare your love for 
your products (and, by implication, why your customers will love them, too).
Offering your professional services
Either through a website or through listings in indexes and directories, offer­
ing your professional services online can expand your client base dramati­
cally. A web presence also gives existing clients a new way to contact you: 
through e-mail. Here are just a few examples of professionals who are offering 
their services online:
	
✓	Attorneys: Family-law attorney Andrea Lance is based in Boston. 
Through her website (http://lancelawmass.com), she can reach 
individuals around the Boston metropolitan area and beyond who need 
legal assistance.
	
✓	Psychotherapists: Julie Hendrickson uses a simple, nicely designed web­
site (www.seattlepsychotherapyservices.com) to pursue a profes­
sion you might not think you could do online: psychotherapy. Her site is 
upfront about her work and her fees, too. My friend Michael Vernon also 
advertises his counseling services through his The Mindfulness Clinic 
website (http://themindfulnessclinic.com).
	
✓	Physicians: Dr. Rob Lamberts, a physician in Augusta, Georgia, maintains 
a blog called “Musings of a Distractible Mind” (www.distractible.org) 
that gives opinions and tips. He is also known as “The House Call Doctor” 
on the Quick and Dirty Tips website (http://quickanddirtytips.com).
	
✓	Consultants: Experts who keep their knowledge up to date and are will­
ing to give advice to those with similar interests and needs are always in 
demand. Consultants in a specialized area often find a great demand for 
their services on the Internet. The Yahoo! Consulting page is crowded 
with fields in which online consultants are available:

We’re busy people who don’t always have the time to pore over the fine print. 
Short and snappy nuggets of information can draw customers to your site and 
make them feel as though they’re getting something for free. One way you can 
put forth this professional expertise is by starting your own online newsletter. 
You get to be editor, writer, and mailing-list manager. Plus you get to talk as 
much as you want, network with people who are interested enough in what 
you have to say to subscribe to your publication, and put your name and busi­
ness before lots of people. Judy Vorfeld (whom I profile in Chapter 5) puts out 
a regular newsletter called Communication Expressway that supplements her 
online business site (www.ossweb.com/ezine.html).
Selling your expertise
The original purpose of the Internet was to share knowledge via computers, 
and information is the commodity that has fueled cyberspace’s rapid growth. 
As the Internet and commercial online networks continue to expand, informa­
tion remains key.
Finding valuable information and gathering a particular kind of resource for 
one location online can be a business in itself. People love to get knowledge 
they trust from the comfort of their own homes. For example, students and 
parents are eager to pay someone to help them sort through the procedures 
involved and the data required to apply for college. (See the intriguing School 
Finder website, www.princetonreview.com/schoolsearch.aspx, run by 
The Princeton Review and Seventeen magazine, for example.)
Other online businesses provide gathering points or indexes to more specific 
areas. Here are just a few examples:
	
✓	Search engines: Some businesses succeed by connecting cybersurfers 
with companies, organizations, and individuals that specialize in a given 
area. Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) is the most obvious example. Originally 
started by two college students, Yahoo! has practically become an 
Internet legend by gathering information in one index so that people can 
easily find things online.
	
✓	Links pages: On her Sweepstakes Crazy website (www.sweepstakes
crazy.com), Janet Marchbanks-Aulenta gathers links to current con­
tests along with short descriptions of each one. Janet says her site 
receives as many as 22,000 visits per month and generates income 
through advertising and affiliate links to other contest websites. She 
says she loves running her own business despite the hard work involved 
with keeping it updated. “The key to succeeding at this type of site is to 
build up a regular base of users who return each day to find new con­
tests — the daily upkeep is very important,” she says.

65
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
	
✓	Personal recommendations: The personal touch sells. Just look at sites 
like Lifehacker (http://lifehacker.com) and About.com (www.
about.com). The latter is a guide to the online world that provides web 
surfers with a central location where they can locate virtually anything. 
It works because real people do the choosing and provide evaluations 
(albeit brief) of the sites they list. In Chapter 1, you find out about Dean 
Pettit, who created an online guide to Florida’s Space Coast.
Resource sites such as these can transform information into money in 
a number of ways. In some cases, individuals pay to become members. 
Sometimes, businesses pay to be listed on a site; other times, a site attracts 
so many regular visitors that other companies pay to post advertising on the 
site. Big successes — such as About.com — carry a healthy share of ads and 
strike lucrative partnerships with big companies as well.
Finding opportunities with technology 
or computer resources
What could be more natural than using the web to sell what you need to get 
and stay online? The online world itself, by the very fact that it exists, has 
spawned all kinds of business opportunities for entrepreneurs:
	
✓	Computer services: U.S. News and World Report listed computer services 
as one of the best small businesses to start, and mentioned Arlington 
Virginia Computer Repair (arlingtonvacomputerrepair.com) as an 
example. Owner Alex Chamandy fills a niche by dealing with customers 
face to face, and by locating his company in the basement of his resi­
dence, he saves on overhead and other costs. He is thus able to offer 
lower rates than repair services of the “big box” computer stores.
	
✓	Internet service providers: These businesses give you a high-speed con­
nection to the Internet. Many ISPs, such as Comcast or AT&T, are big 
companies with nationwide coverage. But smaller companies are suc­
ceeding as well — such as Starpoint Digital (www.mystarpoint.com), 
based in Schaumburg, Illinois, which offers free online web training for 
its customers.
	
✓	Software: Matt Wright is well known on the web for providing free com­
puter scripts that add important functionality to websites, such as pro­
cessing information that visitors submit via online forms. Matt’s Script 
Archive site (www.scriptarchive.com) includes an advertisement 
for a book on scripting that he coauthored, as well as a web postcard 
system for sale and an invitation to businesses to take out advertise­
ments on his site.

Being a starving artist 
without the starving
Being creative no longer means you have to live out of your flower-covered 
van, driving from art fairs to craft shows. If you’re simply looking for expo­
sure and feedback on your creations, you can put samples of your work 
online. Consider the following suggestions for virtual creative venues (and 
revenues):
	
✓	Host art galleries. Thanks to online galleries, artists whose sales were 
previously limited to one region can get inquiries from all over the 
world. Art-2k.com (www.art-2k.com) has been advertising artists’ web­
sites since 1999. The personal website created by artist Marques Vickers 
(www.marquesv.com), shown in Figure 3-1, has received worldwide 
attention.
	
✓	Publish your writing. Blogs (web logs, or online diaries) are all the rage 
these days. One of the most successful, such as The Dish by Andrew 
Sullivan (http://dish.andrewsullivan.com), just went indepen­
dent and is generating ad or subscription revenue. To find out how to 
create a blog, check out WordPress (http://wordpress.com).

✓	Get your art printed. Two young men named Jake and Jacob met 
through a design forum and dropped out of college to start an online 
T-shirt business. Today, their Threadless T-Shirts (www.threadless.
com) website rakes in millions.
	
✓	Sell your music. Singer-songwriter Michael McDermott sells his own 
CDs, videos, and posters through his online store (www.michael-
mcdermott.com).
	
You can, of course, also sell all that junk that’s been accumulating in your 
basement, as well as your relatives’ and family members’ junk, on eBay; see 
Chapter 14 for more information on this and Chapter 15 for other exciting 
niche marketplaces.
Easyware (Not Hardware) 
for Your Business
Becoming an information provider on the Internet places an additional 
burden on your computer and peripheral equipment. When you’re “in it for 
the money,” you may go online every day, perhaps for hours at a time, espe­
cially if you buy and sell on eBay. The better your computer setup, the more 
e-mail messages you can download, the more catalog items you can store, 
and so on.
That said, it’s easier than ever to find what you need either online or at your 
local big box store. Rather than going through detailed sections specifying 
the amount of RAM or bandwidth you need, I suggest you follow a couple of 
basic common-sense principles:
	
✓	Look on the Internet for what you need. You can find just about every­
thing you want to get you started.
	
✓	Be sure to try before you buy! Don’t pull out that credit card until you 
get the facts on what warranty and technical support your hardware or 
software vendor provides. Make sure that your vendor provides phone 
support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also ask how long the typical 
turnaround time is in case your equipment needs to be serviced.
	
✓	Buy the best equipment you can afford. Don’t scrimp when it comes to 
imaging, speed, and storage space.
When you do business, you need to take high-quality photos of yourself and 
your products. A cell phone camera probably won’t be up to the task. It pays 
to spend the money to get a good digital camera.

68
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
You’ll also be running a higher number of applications, often at the same 
time, when you’re designing web pages, editing images, and the like. Make 
sure your computing device has enough memory to do the job.
It doesn’t matter so much whether you use a tablet or a desktop computer 
to create and maintain your business. That choice depends on your working 
style and habits. Just make sure you can type and point easily and that you 
won’t run out of memory. And make sure you have all the ports you need. 
Your iPad might be slick and fast, but if you need to transfer lots of files to 
or from another device, you need to be able to do that easily. You might be 
accustomed to using a portable drive (like a thumb drive) to do this, but you 
won’t find a full-size USB port on the iPad to accommodate it. Consider look­
ing for another option, at least if you want to use USB devices.
	
If you purchase lots of new hardware and software, remember to update your 
insurance by sending your insurer a list of your new equipment. Also consider 
purchasing insurance specifically for your computer-related items from a com­
pany such as Safeware (www.safeware.com).
The right computer for 
your online business
You may already have an existing computer setup that’s adequate to get your 
business online. After all, personal computers and tablets are becoming more 
powerful and at the same time generally less expensive. Or you may be start­
ing from scratch and looking to purchase a new computer. In either case, it 
pays to know what all the technical terms and specifications mean. Here are 
some general terms you need to understand:
	
✓	Gigahertz (GHz) and megahertz (MHz): These units of measure indicate 
how quickly a computer’s processor can perform functions. The cen­
tral processing unit (CPU) of a computer is where the computing work 
gets done. In general, the higher the processor’s internal clock rate, the 
faster the computer.
	
✓	Random access memory (RAM): This is the memory that your computer 
uses to temporarily store information needed to operate programs. RAM 
is usually expressed in millions of bytes, or megabytes (MB). The more 
RAM you have, the more programs you can run simultaneously. See 
Table 3-2 for some guidelines.
	
✓	Synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM): Many ultra-fast computers use 
some form of SDRAM synchronized with a particular clock rate of a CPU 
so that a processor can perform more instructions in a given time.
	
✓	Double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM): This is a type of SDRAM that 
can dramatically improve the clock rate of a CPU.

69
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
	
✓	Auxiliary storage: This term refers to physical data-storage space on a 
hard drive, tape, CD-RW, DVD, or other device.
	
✓	Portable storage: SD, XD, CF, and other memory cards can store data in 
cell phones, cameras, and other portable devices. And don’t forget those 
little USB flash drives (also called thumb drives) that can help you back 
up your data in — well, a flash.
	
✓	Virtual memory: This is a type of memory on your hard drive that your 
computer can “borrow” to serve as extra RAM.
	
✓	Wireless network card: The laptop or desktop computer you purchase 
almost certainly has a wireless network card installed so that you can 
connect your wireless modem to another network using Wi-Fi. Chances 
are you don’t need to purchase a network card as an add-on.
	
The Internet is teeming with places where you can find good deals on hard­
ware. A great place to start is the CNET Shopper.com website (http://
shopper.cnet.com). Also visit the auction site uBid.com (www.ubid.com).
Make sure that you have enough memory to run the types of applications 
shown in Table 3-2. (Note that these are only estimates, based on the Windows 
versions of these products that were available at the time of this writing.)
Table 3-2	
Memory Requirements

editing software

Adobe Flash Professional
23GB
The RAM recommended for the sample applications in Table 3-2 adds up to 
more than 8–9GB. If you plan to work, be sure to get at least 10GB of RAM — 
more if you can swing it. Memory is cheap nowadays, so get all the RAM you 
can afford.
Storage space
RAM is only one type of memory your computer uses; the other kind, the 
memory in the hard drive, stores information, such as text files, audio files, 

70
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
programs, and the many essential files your computer’s operating system 
needs. Most new computers come with hard drives that store many gigabytes 
of data. Any hard drive with a few gigabytes of storage space should be 
adequate for your business needs if you don’t do a lot of graphics work. Most 
new computers come with hard drives that are 500GB or larger.
Whether you use a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone as your primary 
computing device, you need to consider auxiliary or add-on storage. Nearly 
all desktops and laptops let you plug in an auxiliary disk drive or a USB 
thumb drive. But not all tablets or phones are “expandable.” In particular, the 
iPhone and iPad don’t include slots for USB drives or mini-SD cards. That’s 
just one reason why I chose an Android phone and tablet. Both can hold a 
mini-SD that gives me 32GB of extra storage. If you have lots of photos or 
files you need or want to carry around with you, and you don’t want to be 
constrained by the storage space that comes with your computing device of 
choice, be sure to buy a device with a storage slot.
There’s a third type of storage you should consider that can make thumb 
drives and SD cards obsolete. It’s called cloud storage. The “cloud” is one or 
more computers on which you have been allocated storage space. Services 
like Apple’s iCloud make up for the fact that its devices don’t have ports or 
disk drives. Rather than storing (or backing up) to a drive you can hold in 
your hand, you transfer those files to your space on a cloud-based computer 
via the Internet. (See the ”Back-up software” section, later in this chapter.) 
My own tablet came with cloud storage provided by its manufacturer, Asus; 
an image of this service is shown in Figure 3-2.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
	
Use care when posting your sensitive business files in the cloud, including 
your customer data. You place considerable trust in the company you choose 
to store your information. Research the company thoroughly; look for online 
reviews and check newsgroup comments to make sure it hasn’t had security 
breaches.
	
Be sure to protect your equipment against electrical problems that can result 
in loss of data or substantial repair bills. At the very least, make sure your 
home office has grounded three-prong outlets and a surge suppressor (also 
called a surge protector). A common variety is a five- or six-outlet strip that 
has a protection device built in. Also consider an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS), which keeps devices from shutting off immediately in the event 
of blackouts. Eaton Corp. presents a questionnaire on its website that leads 
you through the process of selecting just the right UPS device for your device 
and your needs. Try it out at

SolutionOverview.asp
Image capture devices
When you’re ready to start creating a web page or putting products up for 
sale in an online store, think about obtaining a tool for capturing photo­
graphic images. (By capturing, I mean digitizing an image or, in other words, 
saving it in computerized, digital format.) Photos are often essential elements 
of business web pages: They attract a customer’s attention, they illustrate 
items for sale, and they can provide before-and-after samples of your work. 
If you’re an artist or a designer, having photographic representations of your 
work is vital.
	
Digital displays such as computer monitors and digital cameras display 
graphic information that consists of little units — pixels. Each pixel appears 
onscreen as a small dot — so small that it’s hard to see with the naked eye 
unless you magnify an image to look at details closely. Together, the patterns 
of pixels create different intensities of light in an image as well as ranges of 
color. A pixel can contain one or more bytes of binary information. The more 
pixels per inch (ppi), the higher a monitor’s potential resolution. The higher 
the resolution, the closer the image appears to a continuous-tone image such 
as a photo.
Including clear, sharp images on your website greatly increases your chances 
of selling your product or service. You have two choices for digitizing: a digi­
tal camera or a scanner. To decide which is best for you, read on.

72

Digital camera
Not so long ago, digital cameras cost thousands of dollars. These days, 
you’ve probably got a perfectly good one in your pocket, because it comes 
with your cell phone. Mine has an 8-megapixel camera, which is a high resolu­
tion. You can also find a very serviceable camera made by a reputable manu­
facturer, such as Nikon, Fuji, Canon, Olympus, or Kodak, for around $100 or 
less. The small investment in this particular tool can pay off for you big time. 
With the addition of a color printer, you can even print your own photos. 
Standalone digital cameras often have more controls than cell phone cam­
eras and are worth considering.
	
Don’t hesitate to fork over the extra dough to get a camera that gives you 
good resolution. Cutting corners doesn’t pay when you end up with images 
that look fuzzy, but you can find many low-cost devices with good features. 
For example, the Canon PowerShot A2300, which costs about $89, has a reso­
lution of 16 megapixels — fine enough to print on a color printer and enlarge 
to a size such as 5 x 7 inches — and a zoom feature. Megapixels are calculated 
by multiplying the number of pixels in an image — for example, 1,984 x 1,488 = 
2,952,192 pixels, or 2.9 megapixels. The higher the resolution, the fewer 
photos your camera can store at any one time because each image file 
requires more memory.
Having super-high-resolution images isn’t critical for web images because 
they display on computer monitors (which have limited resolution). Before 
you can display an image on a web browser, you have to compress it by put­
ting it in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format. (See Chapter 5 for more scintillating tech­
nical details on GIF, PNG, and JPEG.) Also, smaller and simpler images (as 
opposed to large, high-resolution graphics) generally appear more quickly on 
the viewer’s screen. If you make your customers wait too long (more than ten 
seconds or so) for an image to appear onscreen, they’re highly likely to go to 
someone else’s online store.
When shopping for a digital camera, look for the following features:
	
✓	The ability to download images to your computer via a FireWire or USB 
connection
	
✓	Bundled image-processing software
	
✓	The ability to download image files directly to a memory card that you 
can easily transport to a computer’s memory card reader
	
✓	A macro function that enables you to capture clear close-up images
	
✓	An included LCD screen that lets you see your images immediately
Digital photography is a fascinating and technical process, and you’ll do 
well to read more about it in other books, such as Digital Photography All-in-
One For Dummies, 4th Edition, by David Busch, or Digital Photography For 
Dummies, 6th Edition, by Julie Adair King and Serge Timacheff.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
Scanners
Scanning is the process of turning the colors and shapes contained in a pho­
tographic print or slide into digital information (that is, bytes of data) that 
a computer can understand. You place the image in a position where the 
scanner’s camera can pass over it, and the scanner turns the image into a 
computer document that consists of tiny bits of information — pixels. I find it 
easiest to use a flatbed scanner. You place the photo or other image on a flat 
glass bed, just like what you find on a photocopier. An optical device moves 
under the glass and scans the photo.
The best news about scanners is that they’ve been around for a while, which, 
in the world of computing, means that prices are going down while quality is 
on the rise. Many good scanners are built into printers, so you can buy both 
in one device. The bargain models sell for under $100, and I’ve even seen a 
couple of standalone photo scanners for as low as $59 new.
	
A type of scanner that has lots of benefits for small or home-based businesses 
is a multifunction device (also called an all-in-one device). You can find these 
units, along with conventional printers and scanners, everywhere: at com­
puter outlets, office-supply shops, big-box stores such as Target and Costco, 
and online through TigerDirect.com and many other vendors. I use a multi­
function device in my home office that sends and receives faxes, scans images, 
acts as a laser printer, and makes copies — plus it includes a telephone and 
answering machine. Now, if it could just make a good cup of espresso. . . .
Getting Online: Connection Options
After computer hardware, Internet connection fees are likely to be the big­
gest monthly expense you’ll encounter in your online business. In the United 
States (where, unfortunately, it’s rare that true fiber-optic connections go to 
your home or office), the options for most people are cable providers, DSL 
providers, and wireless networks like 4G LTE systems.
Cable modem
Cable modem connections offer an attractive way to get a high-speed connec­
tion to cyberspace. So go ahead and ask your local cable TV providers whether 
they provide this service. But other options, such as AT&T (www.att.com) 
and EarthLink (www.earthlink.net), provide high-speed Internet access 
through affiliations with cable TV providers in many parts of the country. In 
my neighborhood in Chicago, a company called RCN Chicago (www.rcn.com/
about-rcn) offers Internet access via cable modem for $39.99 to $59.99 plus a 
$5 fee for the cable modem device. AT&T however, offers several U-verse high-
speed Internet packages ranging from $4 to $66 per month.

74
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
There are many advantages to having a cable modem connection: It’s a direct 
connection, it frees up a phone line, and it’s super-fast. Cable modems have 
the capacity to deliver 4MB or 5MB of data per second. But some providers 
don’t tell you what kind of connection you’re getting: You might pay for the 
speed of the connection instead. Currently, AT&T provides a connection of up 
to 6.0 Mbps for $24.95 per month, which is a good deal.
Of course, the speed is less than this because you’re sharing access with 
other users. Plus you have to purchase or lease the cable modem, pay an 
installation fee, and purchase an Ethernet card (if your computer doesn’t 
already have one installed). A cable modem is far faster than a dial-up con­
nection, though.
	
You can compare cable modem and DSL providers cover your area by visiting 
the MyRatePlan website:
www.myrateplan.com/internet/cable_modem.php
DSL
If your telephone company offers its customers Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) 
connections, you may be able to get a connection that approaches the speed 
of cable. With DSL, you can use your existing, conventional phone lines 
rather than have to install a new line to your house. That’s because DSLs 
“borrow” the part of your phone line that your voice doesn’t use, the part 
that transmits signals of 3,000 Hz (hertz) or higher. DSLs can upload (send) 
data to another location on the Internet at up to 6.0 Mbps (megabits per 
second) and download (receive) data at up to 2.560 Mbps. (Yours may get 
half that speed, though, depending on your location.)
DSL comes in different varieties. Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) 
transmits information at different speeds, depending on whether you’re send­
ing or receiving data. Symmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) transmits 
information at the same speed in both directions. As DSL gets more popular, 
it becomes more widely available and the pricing drops. As of this writ­
ing, EarthLink DSL is available for just $14.95 per month (for the first three 
months) with free DSL modem and installation. Your local phone provider 
might offer DSL, too. AT&T has a DSL option for just $14.95 per month for the 
first three months plus 5 percent off a DSL modem.
Smartphone
One of the most convenient ways to get online, when I’m on the road, is 
through my smartphone, which has 4G LTE web access. Originally, I had 

75
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
unlimited data usage from my provider, Verizon. That service has since been 
discontinued, and I get 2GB of data per month. I’m on the phone all the time, 
checking my Gmail, my webmail, and even posting on my blog occasionally.
For an online businessperson, a cell phone is a necessity. A smartphone 
enables you to respond quickly to queries from customers who visit your 
website and ask questions about your products and services.
The big phone providers can give you wireless Internet access wherever you 
are. A portable wireless hotspot like Verizon’s MiFi costs $167 on Amazon.
com at this writing. If you purchase a new two-year service contract through 
Amazon Wireless (http://wireless.amazon.com), however, the device 
costs only one cent. It connects to Verizon’s 4G LTE network and acts as a 
wireless modem. You can connect to it with your smartphone, tablet, or any 
computing device that uses Wi-Fi.
Software Solutions for Online Business
One of the great things about starting an Internet business is that you get to 
use Internet software. The programs you use online are inexpensive (some­
times free), easy to use and install, and continually being updated.
Although you probably already have basic software to help you find infor­
mation and communicate with others in cyberspace, the following sections 
describe some programs that may come in handy when you create your 
online business.
	
Don’t forget to update your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance by sending 
your insurer a list of new software (and hardware) or even by purchasing 
insurance specifically for your computer-related items from a company such 
as Safeware. With homeowner’s or renter’s insurance, some accidents are not 
covered, and you don’t always get replacement coverage for items such as 
computers. Check with your insurance provider to be sure.
	
Anyone who uses firewall or antivirus software will tell you how essential 
these pieces of software are for home or business use. Find out more about 
such software in Chapter 6. See Chapter 18 for suggestions about accounting 
software — other important software you need.
Web page editor
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a set of instructions used to format 
text, images, and other web page elements so that web browsers can cor­
rectly display them. But you don’t have to master HTML to create your own 

76
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
web pages. Plenty of programs — web page editors — are available to help 
you format text, add images, make hyperlinks, and do all the fun assembly 
steps necessary to make your website a winner. Among the most popular are 
Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe GoLive, and Microsoft Expression Web.
Sometimes, programs that you use for one purpose can also help you create 
web documents: Software you use to create blogs, such as WordPress, can 
help you format other types of web content. Microsoft Word enables you to 
save text documents as HTML web pages, and Microsoft Office enables you 
to export files in web page format automatically.
Taking e-mail a step higher
You’re probably very familiar with sending and receiving e-mail messages. 
But when you start an online business, make sure that e-mail software has 
some advanced features:
	
✓	Autoresponders: Some programs automatically respond to e-mail 
requests with a form letter or document of your choice.
	
✓	Mailing lists: With a well-organized address book (a feature that comes 
with some e-mail programs), you can collect the e-mail addresses of 
visitors or subscribers and send them a regular update of your business 
activities or, better yet, an e-mail newsletter.
	
✓	Quoting: Almost all e-mail programs let you quote from a message to 
which you’re replying so that you can respond easily to questions.
	
✓	Attaching: Attaching a file to an e-mail message is a quick and conve­
nient way to transmit information from one person to another.
	
✓	Signature files: Make sure your e-mail software automatically includes 
a simple electronic signature at the end. Use this space to list your com­
pany name, title, and website URL.
Both Outlook (the e-mail component of Microsoft Internet Explorer) and 
Thunderbird (associated with the web browser Mozilla Firefox) include most 
or all these features. These functions are essential aspects of providing good 
customer service; I discuss them in detail in Chapter 8.
Image editors
You need a graphics-editing program either to create original artwork for 
your web pages or to crop and adjust your scanned images and digital photo­
graphs. If you’re adjusting or cropping photographic image files, the software 
you need almost always comes bundled with your scanner or digital camera, 
so you don’t need to buy separate software for that.

77
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Equipping Your New E-Business
If you’re creating original artwork, three programs I recommend are Adobe 
Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.
html), LView Pro by Leonardo Haddad Loureiro (www.lview.com), and 
PaintShop Pro by Corel (www.corel.com). You can download all these pro­
grams from the Web to use on a trial basis. After the trial period is over, you 
pay a small fee to the developer to register and keep the program. Photoshop 
Elements costs $99.95, LView Pro version 2006 costs $29.95, and PaintShop 
Pro X5 costs $59.95.
	
The ability to download and use free (and almost free) software from shareware 
archives and many other sites is one of the nicest things about the Internet. 
Keep the system working by remembering to pay the shareware fees to the nice 
folks who make their software available to individuals like you and me.
Internet phone software
Skype (pronounced skipe; rhymes with snipe) is the best known of a group 
of software programs that provide you with Internet phone service. Skype 
allows you to talk to other computer users over the Internet, provided that 
you have a microphone connected to your computer and a headset if your 
built-in speakers aren’t loud enough. Skype gives you a highly cost-effective 
alternative to long-distance or international phone calls. Skype works best if 
both parties have a high-speed Internet connection. Skype is convenient and 
a lot of fun. When one Skype member calls another, the connection is free. In 
addition, you can
	
✓	Type messages to one individual, either in a real-time “chat”-like session 
or by typing a message that the individual reads when he or she is back 
online.
	
✓	Put the Skype logo on your website to help market your business by let­
ting people know you’ll speak to them personally, for free.
Giving your customers the chance to “meet” you in person, at least virtually, 
helps build their trust. Find out more at www.skype.com.
Back-up software
Losing copies of your personal documents is one thing, but losing files 
related to your business can hit you hard in the wallet. That makes it even 
more important to make back-ups of your online business computer files. 
Iomega Prestige or eGo drives (http://go.iomega.com) come with soft­
ware that lets you automatically make backups of your files. If you don’t own 
one of these programs, I recommend you become familiar with the back-
up program included with Windows XP or look into Backup Exec 2012 by 
Symantec Corporation:

78
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
www.symantec.com/products/data-backup-software
Or just buy a USB flash drive that holds 4GB or more of information and use 
that to back up your files.
Instead of (or along with) purchasing a disk drive to back up your files, you 
can store your files in an online “cloud.” Cloud computing is all the rage 
these days. A cloud is a huge storage space on a server provided by an online 
provider. Perhaps the best-known example is Google. Google not only gives 
people access to many gigabytes’ worth of e-mail storage space through 
its Gmail service, but also gives Gmail users free access to a service called 
Google Docs (docs.google.com). Google Docs lets you work on Google’s 
servers, doing word processing and spreadsheet computing while storing 
your files online so that you can access them from anywhere you have an 
Internet connection. Some service providers provide space in the cloud 
(that is, on their servers) specifically for storage and backup. These include 
Microsoft’s SkyDrive (skydrive.live.com), which gives you 7GB of free 
storage space, and Box (www.box.com), which has a free option with up to 
50GB of space or 1000GB for $15 per month.

Selecting Your E-Commerce 
Host and Design Tools
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing the right type of e-commerce host
▶	Setting up a hosting service for your website
▶	Choosing software to create and edit your web pages
▶	Transferring your website files to your hosting service
N

early every business, online or off, needs a storefront where merchan­
dise can be displayed and customers can make purchases. The vast 
majority of online commercial concerns use their websites as the primary 
way to attract customers, convey their message, and make sales. Ambitious 
capitalists use online auction sites such as eBay (www.ebay.com) to make 
money, but the auctioneers who depend on eBay for regular income often 
have their own web pages, too — plus storefronts on other hosting sites, 
where they can gather all the profit without having to pay fees to the auction 
marketplace.
The success of an online business depends on two important factors: where 
it’s hosted and how it’s designed. These factors affect how easily you can 
create and update your web pages; what special features, such as multimedia 
or interactive forms, you can have on your site; and even how your site looks. 
Some hosting services provide web page creation tools that are easy to use 
but limit the level of sophistication you can apply to the page’s design. Other 
services leave the creation and design up to you. In this chapter, I provide 
an overview of your storefront hosting options as well as different design 
approaches that you can implement.
	
Plenty of web hosting services and software claim they can have your website 
up and running online “in a matter of minutes” by using a “seamless” process. 
The actual construction may indeed be quick and smooth — as long as you 
do all the work beforehand. This preparation work includes identifying your 
goals for going online, deciding what market you want to reach, deciding what 
products you want to sell, and writing descriptions and capturing images of 

80
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
those products. Before you jump over to Yahoo! Small Business or Microsoft 
Small Business Center and start assembling your site, be sure that you do all 
the groundwork that I discuss in Chapter 2, such as identifying your audience 
and setting up your hardware.
Getting the Most from 
Your Storefront Host
An Internet connection and a web browser are all you need if you’re primarily 
interested in surfing through cyberspace, consuming information, and shop­
ping for online goodies. But when you’re starting an online business, you’re 
no longer just a consumer; you’re becoming a provider of information and 
consumable goods. Along with a way to connect to the Internet, you need to 
find a hosting service to make your online business available to prospective 
customers.
A web hosting service is the online world’s equivalent of a landlord. Just as 
the owner of a building gives you office space or room for a storefront where 
you can hang your shingle, a hosting service provides you with space online 
where you can set up shop. A web hosting service may or may not advertise 
itself as such. On Zazzle (www.zazzle.com), for example, you can set up a 
storefront for free, customize it to your liking, and take advantage of a store-
builder utility. Essentially, you’re setting up your own website with Zazzle as 
the host.
Web hosts come in many flavors
Not all web hosting services are intended to help you create your own full-
fledged website. They come in different varieties, depending on the type of 
business you want to run and the amount of control you want to have over 
your presentation. Here’s a look at the most common hosting options.
A big e-commerce marketplace as host
You can operate an online storefront with your business name and a catalog 
full of browsable items if you sell regularly on eBay, Amazon.com, or another 
big marketplace that sells a wide variety of merchandise. On eBay, you can 
create an About Me page or an eBay store; on Amazon, you can open a web­
store (webstore.amazon.com). In either case, eBay or Amazon itself is your 
host, and you pay a monthly fee to host your store. See Chapter 14 for more 
information.

81
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
A small specialty marketplace as host
I’m a big fan of small marketplaces that specialize in one type of merchan­
dise. Because they’re smaller than the big venues, you generally pay less for 
hosting, and get more personal support. If you sell handmade crafts, Etsy 
(www.etsy.com) is an obvious choice. For artists, ArtFire (www.artfire.com) 
is a good option. Such storefronts are excellent choices for a business that 
already has a website and wants to expand (or as I say, combine multiple 
storefronts with social marketing) to improve marketing and reach more cus­
tomers. See Chapter 15 for more on opening specialty storefronts of this sort.
An e-commerce “shopping cart” service as host
Services like Volusion, Shopify, ZenCart, X-Cart, Ecwid, and other businesses 
that provide store owners with shopping carts and related services also pro­
vide storefronts, hosting, and support for a monthly fee. The term shopping 
cart is somewhat misleading, because these services give you much more 
than just a system for shopping, making selections, and checking out. You get 
a full-featured storefront with design templates and phone or e-mail support 
as well.
A hosting service dedicated to websites as host
If you don’t necessarily want to set up an e-commerce storefront (for exam­
ple, if you do consulting, design, or other professional services rather than 
individual items), many hosting services are happy to help you create a home 
page and associated web pages so people can find you online.
What’s the difference between a web host like HostGator (www.hostgator.
com) and a shopping cart host? Not much. HostGator hosts an e-commerce 
storefront and gives you a shopping cart. A storefront hosted with Shopify 
looks just the same as one hosted with HostGator. You might get better 
customer support and more e-commerce options with a shopping cart host 
because it specializes in hosting for online businesses. But all these hosts 
give you space on a web server; a URL so people can find you; and a way to 
post text, images, and other content online.
	
You don’t need a storefront if you sell by placing ads on Craigslist or if you 
add merchandise to Amazon.com’s marketplace listings, for example.
In all of these cases, a web host provides space on special computers — 
web servers — that are always connected to the Internet. Web servers are 
equipped with software that makes your web pages visible to people who 
connect to them by using a web browser. The process of using a web hosting 
service for your online business works roughly like this:
	
1.	Decide where you want your site to appear on the Internet.

82
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
	 Do you want it to be part of a virtual shopping mall that includes many 
other businesses? Or do you want a standalone site with its own web 
address that doesn’t appear to be affiliated with any other organization?
	
2.	Sign up with the host.
	
	 Sometimes you pay a fee. In some cases, no fee is required. In all cases, 
you’re assigned space on a server. Your website gets an address, or URL, 
that people can enter in their browsers to view your pages.
	
3.	Create your web pages.
	
	 Usually, you use a web page editor to do this step, although many hosts 
help by providing a “store builder” or other utility.
	
4.	Transfer your web page files (HTML documents, images, and so on) 
from your computer to the host’s web server.
	
	 You generally need special File Transfer Protocol (FTP) software to do 
the transferring. But many web hosts can help you through the process 
by providing their own user-friendly software. (The most popular web 
editors, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, let you do this, too.)
	
5.	Access your site with your web browser and check the contents to 
make sure that all images appear correctly and any hypertext links 
you created go to the intended destinations.
	
	 At this point, you’re open for business — visitors can view your web 
pages by entering your web address in their web browser’s Go To or 
Address box.
	
6.	Market and promote your site to attract potential clients or customers, 
as described in Chapter 10.
Choose your web host carefully, because the host affects which software 
you need to use to create your web pages and get them online. The challenge 
when you’re just starting out is to keep an eye on your overall business plan. 
Think about the site you want to serve as your “home base” and set that up 
first. Then you can expand to other venues, as described in Chapters 13 and 15.
	
You can host your own site if you have a direct connection to the Internet, 
such as through DSL or cable, and are competent with computers (or know 
someone who is). However, turning your computer into a web server is more 
complicated than signing up with a hosting service. Your Internet service pro­
vider (ISP) may not allow you to set up your own server anyway; check your 
user agreement first. You need to install server software and set up a domain 
name for your computer. You also have to purchase a static IP address for 
your machine. (An IP address is a number that identifies every computer that’s 
connected to the Internet; it consists of four sets of numerals separated by 
dots, such as 206.207.99.1. A static IP address is one that doesn’t change from 
session to session.)

83
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
If you’re just starting a simple home-based or part-time business, hosting 
your own website is probably more trouble than you care to handle, but 
you should be aware that it’s an option. If you’re interested in becoming a 
webmaster, check out MegaPath (www.megapath.com). This ISP encourages 
users to set up their own web servers and offers eight static IP addresses 
with a DSL line for $59.95 per month.
One of the best shortcuts to success is to find a good web servicing host or 
ISP and then use that company’s software tools and service reps when you 
need help building your website, processing forms, running scripts, and per­
forming similar tasks.
	
Before you sign up with a host, check out its customer service options. 
Specifically, find out when the service staff is available by telephone. Also ask 
whether telephone support costs extra.
A web host called pair Networks (www.pair.com) offers a typical selection 
of hosting options and has been praised by some technical writers I know. 
It also provides e-commerce services that go beyond basic hosting arrange­
ments: a secure server (a computer that can encrypt sensitive data such as 
credit card numbers that the customer sends to your site), a shopping card, 
credit card authorization, and a dedicated server. These services range from 
$10 to $50 per month.
	
Instead of getting locked into a long-term contract with a web host, go month 
to month or sign a one-year contract. Even if you’re initially happy with your 
host, you want a chance to back out if the company takes a turn for the worse 
or your needs change.
Domain-name registration
Some ISPs also function as domain-name registrars by enabling anyone to 
purchase the rights to use a domain name for one or more years. Having your 
own domain name lets you associate the name with your site rather than 
have to point the name at the server that holds your site.
	
By pointing your domain name at your server, you purchase the rights to a 
domain name from a registrar. You then need to associate the name with your 
website so that when people connect to your site, they won’t have to enter a 
long URL such as username.home.earthlink.com. Instead, they’ll enter 
www.mybusiness.com. To do this, you tell the registrar that your domain 
name should be assigned to the IP address of your server. Your ISP or web 
host tells you the IP address to give to the registrar.

84
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
New domains are available that can provide you an alternative in case your 
ideal name on the dot-com (.com) domain is unavailable. Even if you do get a 
dot-com name (.com is still the most recognizable and desirable domain-name 
extension), you may want to buy the same name with .biz, .info, or .tv at 
the end so that someone else doesn’t grab it.
Marketing utilities
Some people are great at promotion and marketing. Others excel at detail 
work. If you’re not among the lucky people who can do both kinds of busi­
ness tasks well, find a hosting service that helps you get noticed.
Some hosts, such as Microsoft Office Live 365 (www.microsoft.com/
en-us/office365/enterprise-home.aspx), give you access to a variety 
of marketing services if you sign with it as your host. Not all the services are 
free, of course.
Catalog creators
Some of the biggest web hosts (such as Yahoo! Small Business) give you soft­
ware that enables you to create an online sales catalog by using your web 
browser. You don’t have to purchase a web design program, figure out how 
to use it, and create your pages from scratch.
On the downside, a web-based catalog creation tool doesn’t give you ultimate 
control over how your pages look. You probably can’t pull off fancy layout 
effects with tables or layers. (See Chapter 5 for more on using tables and 
layers to design your site’s web pages.) On the plus side, however, you can 
use one of these tools to get your pages online quickly.
Database connectivity
If you plan to sell only a few items at a time, your e-commerce site can be a 
static site, which means that every time a customer makes a sale, you manu­
ally adjust your inventory. A static site also requires you to update descrip­
tions and revise shipping charges or other details by hand, one web page at 
a time. By contrast, a dynamic e-commerce site presents catalog sales items 
on the fly (dynamically) by connecting to a database whenever a customer 
requests a web page.

85
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
If you need to create a dynamic website, another factor in choosing a web 
host is whether it supports the web page and database software you want 
to use. For Doug Laughter of The Silver Connection, LLC (whom I mention 
later in this chapter), the choice of host was essential. He wanted to develop 
his site himself using technologies he was familiar with and regarded highly, 
such as Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. If you use a data­
base program, such as MySQL, you may want to sign up with a web host that 
allows you to run SQL Server on one of its servers.
Finding a Web Server to Call Home
Hi! I’m your friendly World Wide Web real estate agent. Call me Virtual Larry. 
You say you’re not sure exactly what kind of website is right for you, and you 
want to see all the options, from a tiny storefront in a strip mall to your own 
landscaped corporate park? Your wish is my command. Just hop into my 
2013-model Mozilla Firefox, buckle your seat belt, and I’ll show you around 
the many different business properties available in cyberspace.
Here’s a road map of our tour:
	
✓	Online web-host-and-design-kit combos: These include Microsoft Office 
365, Google Sites, and Yahoo! Small Business, among others.
	
✓	Electronic merchant software that is included with a web hosting 
package: One example is ShopSite (discussed later in this chapter).
	
✓	eBay and Amazon: These two big marketplaces let users create their 
own About Me web pages or their own stores.
	
✓	Auxiliary companies: These folks do something that doesn’t seem 
directly related to e-commerce, but they let you build a store online, 
such as FedEx eCommerce Builder or Chase Instant Storefront.
	
✓	An online marketplace: You can rent a space on these sites, where you 
can offer specialty items for sale, such as clothing, artwork, or antiques.
	
✓	Your current Internet service provider (ISP): Many ISPs are only too 
happy to host your e-commerce site — for a monthly fee in addition to 
your access fee.
	
✓	Companies devoted to hosting websites full time: These are businesses 
whose primary function is hosting e-commerce websites and providing 
their clients with associated software, such as web page building tools, 
shopping carts, and catalog builders.

86
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
The first four options combine web hosting with web page creation kits. 
Whether you buy these services or use them on the web for free, you simply 
follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Most of these hosting services enable 
you to create your web pages by filling in forms; you never have to see a line 
of HTML code if you don’t want to. Depending on which service you choose, 
you have varying degrees of control over how your site ultimately looks.
The first two options don’t give you a lot of control. You might have to pay 
fees for hosting or for sales. Online marketplaces give you lower fees, design 
templates, a shopping cart, and payment methods. But you might not get as 
many customers as you would on eBay or Amazon.
The last two options (ISPs and full-time web hosts) tend to be do-it-yourself 
projects. You sign up with the host, choose the software, and create your 
own site. However, the distinction between this category and the others is 
blurry. As competition between web hosts grows keener, more and more 
companies are providing ready-made solutions that streamline the process of 
website creation for their customers. For you, the end-user, this competition 
is a good thing: You have plenty of control over how your site comes into 
being and how it grows over time.
If you simply need a basic website and don’t want a lot of choices, go with 
one of the kits. Your site may look like everyone else’s and seem a little 
generic, but setup is easy, and you can concentrate on marketing and running 
your business.
Using a marketplace to 
build your webstore
Virtually all the free web hosting services mentioned in the “Website home­
steading for free” sidebar and in the “Finding a Web Server to Call Home” 
section, both earlier in this chapter, make things easy and affordable for 
would-be ontrepreneurs (online entrepreneurs). These sites act as both a 
web host and a web page creation tool. You connect to the site, sign up for 
service, and fill out a series of forms. Submitting the completed forms acti­
vates a script on the host site that automatically generates your web pages 
based on the data you entered. After you have a site, you can expand to have 
a storefront in a specialty marketplace. Or you can open a storefront in place 
of a full-fledged website. Such storefronts include
	
✓	CafePress (www.cafepress.com) allows you to easily create and sell 
music CDs, photos, or artwork online for free. The hard part is deciding 
what you want to sell, how best to describe your sales items, and how to 
promote your site.

87
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
Website homesteading for free
Free web hosting is still possible for small businesses. If you’re on a tight budget and looking for 
space on a web server for free, turn first to your ISP, which probably gives you server space to set 
up a website. You can also check out one of a handful of sites that provide customers with hosting 
space for no money down and no monthly payments. Instead, you pay in terms of advertising: You 
may have to include some ads or other things on your site, but if you don’t mind that, here are a 
few good deals you can enjoy:
	✓	Google Apps (www.google.com/enterprise/apps/index.html): If you have a 
domain name, you can use Google’s services. These include Google’s Gmail e-mail service 
and Google Sites for creating web pages. You can access Google Apps with Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, and other browsers. You get 10GB of web storage space, too.
	✓	Freeservers (www.freeservers.com): In exchange for banner ads and pop-up ads, which 
you’re required to display if you set up a website on one of its servers, this site gives you add-
ons (such as guest books and hit counters) and an online web page building tool for creating 
your site — not to mention 50MB of server space.
You can find free web hosting services on Yahoo! here:
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/
Communications_and_Networking/Internet_and_World_
Wide_Web/Network_Service_Providers/Hosting/Website_
Hosting/Free_Hosting
Be sure that the site you choose lets you set up for-profit business sites for free.
	
✓	Babylon Mall (www.babylonmall.com), which caters to vintage-cloth­
ing sellers, charges $15 per month and gives members software that 
helps them design their storefronts.
Most storefront options provide you with predesigned web pages, called tem­
plates, that you customize for your particular business. Some types of store­
front options provide you with shopping cart systems that enable customers 
to select items and tally the cost at checkout. Figure 4-1 shows one of the 
templates offered by PrestaShop, the storefront host used by Paula & Chlo 
handbags, which is profiled later in this chapter.
You choose a template and customize it with your own photos, store name 
and logo, and sales information. Figure 4-2 shows the Paula & Chlo home 
page, which shows a few similarities to the template shown in the preceding 
image.

Storefront options may also provide an electronic payment option, such as 
credit card purchases. Usually, you purchase a monthly package and follow a 
series of steps that mirror the primary aspects of an offline business:
	
✓	The storefront: This is represented by the web pages that you create. 
Most options include predesigned web pages that you can copy and cus­
tomize with your own content.
	
✓	The inventory: You can stock your virtual storefront shelves by present­
ing your wares in the form of an online catalog or product list.
	
✓	The delivery truck: Some storefront packages streamline the process 
of transferring your files from your computer to the server. Rather than 
use FTP software, you publish information simply by clicking a button in 
your web editor or web browser.
	
✓	The checkout counter: Most electronic storefront packages give you the 
option of accepting orders by phone, fax, or online with a credit card.
Besides providing you with the software you need to create web pages and 
get them online, electronic storefronts instruct you on how to market your 
site and present your goods and services in a positive way. In addition, some 
programs provide a back room for your business where you can record cus­
tomer information, orders, and fulfillment. See Chapter 15 for more on setting 
up shop in one of these specialty marketplaces.
ShopSite
ShopSite, by ShopSite, Inc., isn’t software that you purchase and install on 
your computer. Rather, you find a web hosting service, such as Verio (www.
verio.com), that runs ShopSite on its servers. You then set up an account 
with the host and use the ShopSite software over the Internet, using your 
web browser. With this kind of setup, which is a hosted application, you don’t 
have to worry about having enough memory or hard drive space to run the 
program yourself. You also don’t have to bother with updating or trouble­
shooting the software; that, too, is the hosting service’s responsibility.
To find a hosting service that runs ShopSite, go to the ShopSite website 
(www.shopsite.com) and scan a list of hosts. You pick a company and 
arrange for an account. Pricing varies, depending on the host and the version 
of the service that you want. ShopSite comes in three varieties:
	
✓	Starter: Lets you create a catalog of only 15 items for sale and 5 web 
pages. Fees start at $5 per month.
	
✓	Manager: Gives you an unlimited number of pages, plus templates, 
themes, a shopping cart, and real-time credit card processing. Fees start 
at $30 per month.

90
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
✓	Pro: Adds the ability to track inventory as products are purchased for 
about $60 per month.
The actual cost for hosting your site plus the additional cost for ShopSite 
ranges from $5 to $35 per month (Starter) to $60 to $120 per month (Pro).
A good host ensures e-commerce success
For Paula Slof, a good e-commerce host provides a business foundation that she can build on. 
Her hosting service, PrestaShop (www.prestashop.com), gives her the features and platform 
that she and her web developer can use to customize and develop her Paula & Chlo store (www.
paulaandchlo.com).
Developer Stephanie Fredrickson used PrestaShop’s templates to design the store and then cus­
tomized it by using her own code or by installing applications called modules that the hosting 
service makes available to its customers.
“With an online store, the e-commerce host is one of the most important components to running a 
successful business,” says Slof. “Your shopping cart is equivalent to your brick-and-mortar store, 
your landlord, and your employees. Literally, a good e-commerce host is the difference between 
success and failure.”
A successful online business needs a variety of components to work together, she says:
	 1.	 Your e-commerce host
	 2.	 Your programmer
	 3.	 Your products
	 4.	 The appearance and functionality of your site
	 5.	 The marketing behind your products and your site
	 6.	 Your level of customer service
“I don’t think it works without all of these factors in place,” says Slof. A host and a good program­
mer can help you achieve your goals by doing the following, she adds:
	✓	Find a host that sells your products for you. “You may have great products, but you’re online 
so your customers can’t physically touch them. They can’t try them on for size or style. They 
can’t feel how soft the leather is on a fabulous handbag you’re selling. How do you overcome 
that? By having great photos and descriptions, and by having a site that sells your product for 
you. It’s like your salesperson.”
	✓	Make sure your host drives traffic to your store. “Even if everything is in place and the site 
is perfect, without search engine optimization and good marketing, you’re goin’ nowhere! 
PrestaShop has built-in SEO, and different modules that we can use to generate SEO. That 
definitely helps drive traffic to our site.”

91
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
	✓	Make sure you can customize your site. “Make sure the host has an open platform that allows 
you to construct the type of store you’re dreaming of.”
	✓	Make sure your host has good customer service. “See if you can talk to a real person who 
can answer your questions. Some hosts don’t even have a phone number; all contact is via the 
Internet. Often all questions are answered through threads. When you have a ‘live’ site and you 
need help immediately, it can be a very bad situation.”
	✓	Investigate their payment gateways. “Verify that they provide you with the methods of payment 
you want to use.”
	✓	Know what it’s going to cost you to actually use their service. “Some hosts charge a fee to 
use their product and some are free. Even if you are using a free hosting service, there will be 
additional costs. Make sure you know what they are.”
Miva Merchant
Miva Merchant, a competitor of ShopSite, handles all the basics required 
for an e-commerce storefront, including website templates, a product cata­
log, electronic payments, inventory tracking, and shipping. It’s available on 
web hosts such as Hostasaurus.com. The package lets you go beyond 
the basics and set up an affiliate program or a mailing list. Find out more at 
mivacentral.com.
Easyhosting
You can also sign up with a host that includes e-commerce software among 
the services it gives you for a monthly fee. Easyhosting (easyhosting.
com) includes Easy StoreMaker shopping cart/catalog builder software with 
its Intermediate and Advanced hosting packages, which start at $49.99 per 
month.
Moving into an online mall
In addition to website kits, ISPs, and businesses that specialize in web host­
ing, online shopping malls provide another form of web hosting. You set up 
your site, either on your own or by using special web page authoring utilities 
that some malls provide. You pay a monthly fee and transfer your files to the 
mall’s website, and your store appears online. The basic steps are the same 
with an online mall as with any of the other hosting businesses that I mention 
in this chapter.
What’s the difference, then, between a shopping mall that does web hosting, 
an ISP that does hosting, and a web hosting service? Their names and the 

92
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
features they offer differ slightly, but they all do essentially the same thing. 
After you open your virtual business on the web (and as long as you get a 
custom URL that takes the form www.mybusiness.com), your customers 
can’t always tell whether you’re part of America Online, a mall, or a web host 
such as EarthLink.
What is an online shopping mall, anyway? It’s a collection of online busi­
nesses that are listed in a directory or index provided by a single organi­
zation. The directory may be a simple list of stores on a single web page. 
For larger malls with a thousand stores or more, the online businesses are 
arranged by category and found in a searchable index.
In theory, an online shopping mall helps small businesses by giving them 
additional exposure. A customer who shops at one of the mall’s stores might 
notice other businesses on the same site and visit those, too. Some malls 
function as web hosts that enable their customers to transfer web page files 
and present their stores online, using one of the mall’s web servers. Other 
malls let people list their business in the mall with a hyperlink, even if the 
store is actually hosted by another company.
Perhaps the only thing that really distinguishes online malls from other host­
ing services is presentation:
	
✓	Some malls, such as Access Market Square (amsquare.com), use the 
metaphor of a town’s market square to organize their businesses. Stores 
are presented as being on particular parts of the square, but the meta­
phor is just that; other than the fact that many different owners operate 
the storefronts, the site is no different from a big marketplace such as 
Amazon.com.
	
✓	Another online mall to look into is AOL Shopping (shopping.aol.
com), which gathers small and large businesses in one location. You 
add your products to the shopping area by sending a feed — a version 
of your product catalog that has been converted to the programming 
language XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Most hosts provide utili­
ties that convert your catalog to a feed so that you can list your prod­
ucts in such areas; make sure that your host does this, too. To find out 
how to add your products to AOL’s shopping area, send an e-mail to 
AddYourProducts@aol.com.
Consider joining an online mall if you find one that offers an attractive host­
ing package, particularly if it has web page forms that help you set up your 
site or create an online catalog quickly. But remember that to web shoppers, 
it doesn’t matter who your host is; what’s more important is that you develop 
compelling content for your site to attract customers and encourage sales.

93
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
	
Amazon.com doesn’t look like an online mall, but it has instituted some oppor­
tunities for entrepreneurs to sell items on its site. If you don’t want to create 
an entire storefront, you also have the option of selling items individually on 
the Amazon.com site. You pay fees to list items for sale and for completed 
sales as well. Find out more by clicking the Selling on Amazon link at the left 
side of the Amazon.com home page (www.amazon.com).
Turning to your ISP for web hosting
People sometimes talk about ISPs and web hosts as two separate types of 
Internet businesses, but that’s not necessarily the case. Providing users with 
access to the Internet and hosting websites are two different functions, to be 
sure, but the same organization may well perform them.
It’s natural to ask your ISP first about its web hosting policies for its custom­
ers. If you already go online with Comcast, trying out its web hosting facilities 
makes sense. If you have an Internet access account with the popular ISP 
EarthLink (www.earthlink.net), by all means consider EarthLink as a web 
host for your business site.
EarthLink has different web hosting options depending on the kind of 
account you have. Like most ISPs, however, EarthLink provides web space 
to its customers so that they can publish web pages that are primarily per­
sonal in nature. Yes, you can publish a business website, and EarthLink won’t 
complain or cancel your account. But EarthLink really prefers that business 
users spring for special business services that include oodles of web space; 
support for forms and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts (computer 
programs that receive the data that someone sends you, such as a customer 
service request or an order form, and present it in readable form, such as a 
text file, e-mail message, or an entry in a database); and a “vanity” URL of the 
www.company.com variety.
EarthLink offers three separate types of web hosting options: 
	
✓	Website Plus costs $9.97 for the first three months and $19.95 per 
month thereafter, and gives you 200GB of storage space.
	
✓	Business Website Plus costs $17.47 for the first three months and $34.95 
per month thereafter, and adds a mobile version of your website.
	
✓	eCommerce Website Plus costs $42.47 for the first three months and 
$84.95 per month thereafter, and adds a mobile site and business phone 
service.

94
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
What should you look for in an ISP web hosting account, and what constitutes 
a good deal? For one thing, price: A rate of $14.98 per month for 5GB or more 
of website space is a pretty good deal. Look for a host that doesn’t limit the 
number of web pages that you can create. Also, find one that gives you at least 
one e-mail address with your account and that lets you add addresses for a 
nominal fee. Finally, look for a host that gives you the ability to include web 
page forms on your site so that visitors can send you feedback.
What to expect from an ISP web hosting service
The process of setting up a website varies from ISP to ISP. Here are some general 
features that you should look for, based on my experience with my own ISP:
	
✓	Web page editor: You don’t necessarily need to choose a provider that 
gives you a free web page editor. You can easily download and install 
the editor of your choice, such as Expression Web or Dreamweaver, to 
create web pages. (I describe these programs later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Blog software: WordPress support should be included so you can create 
and update your blog if you want to.
	
✓	Password and username: When my web pages are ready to go online, 
I get to use the same username and password to access my website 
space that I use when I connect to the Internet. Although you don’t need 
to enter a password to view a website through a browser (well, at least 
at most sites), you do need a password to protect your site from being 
accessed through an FTP program. Otherwise, anyone can enter your 
website space and tamper with your files.
	
✓	FTP software: When I signed up for a hosting account, I received a 
CD-ROM containing a basic set of software programs, including a web 
browser and an FTP program. FTP is the simplest and easiest-to-use soft­
ware to transfer files from one location to another on the Internet. When 
I access my website space from my Mac, I use an FTP program — 
Fetch. From my PC, I have used a program called WS-FTP. CuteFTP 
(www.cuteftp.com) is another program that many website owners 
use; it costs $39.99 for Mac users and $59.99 for a Windows version. (I 
like the free FileZilla even better, however; find it at www.filezilla.
com.) Most FTP programs are available for free on the Internet or can be 
purchased for a nominal fee.
	
✓	URL: When you set up a website using your ISP, you’re assigned a 
directory on a web server. The convention for naming this directory is 
~username. The ~username designation goes at the end of your URL 
for your website’s home page. However, you can (and should) register a 
shorter URL with a domain-name registrar, such as Network Solutions. 
You can then “point” the domain name to your ISP’s server so that it can 
serve as an “alias” URL for your site.

95
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
After you have your software tools and a user directory on your ISP’s web 
server, it’s time to put your website together. Basically, when I want to create 
or revise content for my website, I open the page in my web page editor, 
make the changes, save the changes, and then transfer the files to my ISP’s 
directory with my FTP program. Finally, I review the changes in my browser.
What’s the ISP difference?
What’s the big difference between using a kit, such as Microsoft Office 365 or 
Yahoo! Small Business, to create your site and using your own inexpensive or 
free software to create a site from scratch and post it on your ISP’s server? 
It’s the difference between putting together a model airplane from a kit and 
designing the airplane yourself. If you use a kit, you save time and trouble; 
your plane ends up looking pretty much like everyone else’s, but you get the 
job done faster. If you design it yourself, you have absolute control. Your 
plane can look just the way you want. It takes longer to get to the end prod­
uct, but you can be sure that you get what you want.
On the other hand, three differences lie between an ISP-hosted site and a site 
that resides with a company that does only web hosting rather than provides 
Internet dial-up access and other services:
	
✓	A business that does only web hosting charges you for hosting services, 
whereas your ISP may not.
	
✓	A web hosting service lets you have your own domain name (www.
company.com), whereas an ISP or a service, such as Microsoft Office 365, 
may not. (Some ISPs require that you upgrade to a business hosting 
account to obtain the vanity address. See the “What’s in a name?” side­
bar later in this chapter for more about how web hosting services offer 
an advantage in the domain-name game.)
	
✓	A web hosting service often provides frills such as super-fast connec­
tions, one-button file transfers with your web browser, tons of site statis­
tics, and automatic backups of your web page files.
To find out more about using a real, full-time web hosting service, see the 
“Going for the works with a web hosting service” section, later in this chapter.
Where to find an ISP
What if you don’t already have an ISP, or you’re not happy with the one you 
have? On today’s Internet, you can’t swing a mouse without hitting an ISP. 
How do you find the one that’s right for you? In general, look for the provider 
that offers you the least expensive service with the fastest connection and 
the best options available for your website.

96
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
Bigger doesn’t necessarily mean cheaper or better; many regional or local 
ISPs provide good service at rates that are comparable to the giants such as 
Verio or EarthLink. When you’re shopping around for an ISP, be sure to ask 
the following questions:
	
✓	What types of connections do you offer?
	
✓	How many dial-up numbers do you have?
	
✓	What is your access range? (Do you provide only local coverage, or 
regional or international coverage as well?)
	
✓	What type of tech support do you offer? Do you accept phone calls or 
e-mail inquiries around the clock or only during certain hours? Are real 
human beings always available on call or are clients sent to a phone 
message system?
Some websites are well known for listing ISPs by state or by the services they 
offer. Here are a few starting points in your search for the ideal ISP:
	
✓	The List: This site lists about 8,000 ISPs. You can search the list by 
area code or by country code, or you can focus on the United States or 
Canada.
thelist.internet.com
	
✓	Yahoo’s List of Internet Access Providers: This is a good source for 
directories of national and international ISPs.
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_
Business/Communications_and_Networking/
Internet_and_World_Wide_Web/Network_Service_
Providers/Internet_Service_Providers__ISPs_/
Going for the works with 
a web hosting service
After you’ve had your site online for a while with a free web host, such as 
Freeservers.com, you may decide you need more room, more services 
(such as inventory tracking or electronic payments), and a faster connection 
that can handle many visitors at one time. In that case, you want to locate 
your online business with a full-time web hosting service.
As the preceding sections attest, many kinds of businesses now host web­
sites. But in this case, I’m defining web hosting service as a company whose 
primary mission is to provide space on web servers for individual, nonprofit, 
and commercial websites.

97
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
What to look for in a web host
Along with providing lots of space for your HTML, image, and other files 
(typically, you get anywhere from 100GB to 500GB of space), web hosting ser­
vices offer a variety of related services, including some or all of the following:
	
✓	E-mail addresses: You can likely get several e-mail addresses for your 
own or your family members’ personal use. Besides that, many web hosts 
give you special e-mail addresses called autoresponders. These are e-mail 
addresses, such as info@yourcompany.com, that you can set up to auto­
matically return a text message or a file to anyone looking for information.
	
✓	Domain names: Virtually all the hosting options that I mention in this 
chapter give customers the option of obtaining a short domain name, 
such as www.mycompany.com. But some web hosts simplify the process 
by providing domain-name registration in their flat monthly rates.
	
✓	Web page software: Some hosting services include web page author­
ing/editing software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver. Some web hosting 
services even offer web page forms that you can fill out online to create 
your own online shopping catalog. All you have to provide is a scanned 
image of the item you want to sell, along with a price and a description. 
You submit the information to the web host, which then adds the item 
to an online catalog that’s part of your site.
	
✓	Multimedia/CGI scripts: One big thing that sets web hosting services 
apart from other hosts is the ability to serve complex and memory-
intensive content, such as RealAudio sound files or RealVideo video 
clips. They also let you process web page forms that you include on 
your site by executing CGI scripts. See Chapter 6 for more about how to 
set up and use forms and other interactive website features.
What’s in a name?
Most hosts assign you a URL that leads to your 
directory (or folder) on the web server. For 
example, the typical personal account with an 
ISP includes space on a web server where you 
can store your web pages, and the address 
looks like this:
http://homepage.speakeasy.
net/~gholden
This is a common form of URL that many web 
hosts use. It means that your web pages 
reside in a directory called ~gholden on a 
computer named homepage. The computer, 
in turn, resides in your provider’s domain on the 
Internet: speakeasy.net.
However, for an extra fee, some web hosts allow 
you to choose a shorter domain name, provided 
the one you want to use isn’t already taken by 
another site. For example, if I paid extra for a 
full-fledged business site, my provider would 
have let me have a catchier, more memorable 
address, like this:
www.gregholden.com

98
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
✓	Shopping cart software: If you want to sell specific items online, look for 
a web host that can streamline the process for you. Most organizations 
provide web page forms that you can fill out to create sale items and 
offer them in an online shopping cart, for example.
	
✓	Automatic data backups: Some hosting services automatically back 
up your website data to protect you against data loss — an especially 
useful feature because disaster recovery is important. The automatic 
nature of the backups frees you from the worry and trouble of doing it 
manually.
	
✓	Site statistics: Virtually all web hosting services also provide you with 
site statistics that give you an idea (perhaps not a precisely accurate 
count, but a good estimate) of how many visitors you have received. 
Even better is access to software reports that analyze and graphically 
report where your visitors are from, how they found you, which pages 
on your site are the most frequently viewed, and so on.
	
✓	Blogging software: WordPress is the standard, and your host should 
make it available to you if you want to operate a business blog.
	
✓	Shopping and electronic commerce features: If you plan to give your 
customers the ability to order and purchase your goods or services 
online by credit card, be sure to look for a web host that provides you 
with secure commerce options. For a more detailed discussion of secure 
electronic commerce, see Chapter 6.
Having so many hosting options available is the proverbial blessing and 
curse. It’s good that you have so many possibilities and that the competition 
is so fierce because that can keep prices down. On the other hand, deciding 
which host is best for you can be difficult. In addition to asking about the pre­
ceding list of features, to help narrow the field, here are a few more questions 
to ask prospective web hosts about their services:
	
✓	Do you limit file transfers? Many services charge a monthly rate for a 
specific amount of electronic data that is transferred to and from your 
site. Each time a visitor views a page, that user is actually downloading 
a few kilobytes of data in order to view it. If your web pages contain, say, 
1MB of text and images and you get 1,000 visitors per month, your site 
accounts for 1GB of data transfer per month. If your host allocates you 
less than 1GB per month, it probably charges you extra for the amount 
you go over the limit.
	
✓	What kind of connection do you have? Your site’s web page content 
appears more quickly in web browser windows if your server has a 
super-fast T1 or T3 connection. Ask your ISP what kind of connection it 
has to the Internet. If you have a DSL line, speeds differ depending on 
the ISP: You might get a fast connection (1.5Mbps) or a more common, 
slower one (684Kbps). Make sure that you’re getting the fastest connec­
tion you can afford.

99
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
	
✓	Will you promote my site? Some hosting services (particularly online 
shopping malls) help publicize your site by listing you with Internet 
search indexes and search services so that visitors are more likely to 
find you.
Other obvious questions that you would ask of any contractor apply to web 
hosting services as well, such as “How long have you been in business?” and 
“Can you suggest customers who will give me a reference?”
	
The fact that I include a screen shot of a particular web hosting service’s site 
in this book doesn’t mean that I’m endorsing or recommending that particular 
organization. Shop around carefully and find the one that’s best for you. Check 
out the hosts with the best rates and most reliable service. Visit some other 
sites that they host, and e-mail the owners of those sites for their opinion of 
their hosting service.
Finding a host that makes your business dynamic
What kinds of technologies do you need from a 
web host to run an online business? For Doug 
Laughter of The Silver Connection, LLC, which 
sells sterling silver jewelry imported from around 
the world (www.silverconnection.
com), the right technologies help his online 
store run smoothly. For one thing, a control 
panel should be available to help you administer 
your site, he says.
Q. What kinds of questions should small 
business owners and managers ask when 
they’re shopping for a hosting service? What 
kinds of features should they be looking for 
initially?
A. I would first suggest considering how 
you want to develop your website. Today’s 
business site needs to be dynamic in nature, so 
the business needs to research and determine 
what web server application it will use. A web 
server application consists of the following:
	✓	Server-side technology: Active Server 
Pages (ASP, ASP.NET); ColdFusion; Java 
Server Pages; PHP; XML
	✓	Database solution: Microsoft SQL Server, 
MS Access, MySQL, Oracle
	✓	Server application: IIS, Apache, iPlanet, 
Sun Java System Web Server
	✓	Operating Platform: Windows, Unix
So the decision about how the e-commerce 
website will be developed and in what 
technology is a key decision to make from the 
onset. After this is decided, choose a web host 
that supports your environment of choice.
Q. After the development platform is determined, 
what features should you look for?
A. Look for essentials that are wholesale 
elements to develop, maintain, and enhance the 
web presence. These items are common with 
most hosting plans but always need attention 
paid to them. This cursory list includes web 
disk space, bandwidth limitations, FTP and 
mail accounts, site statistics, backup plans, 
merchant applications with payment gateways, 
and other customary plan offers. Finally, make 
sure there’s an application that can analyze 
traffic, such as Webtrends.

Competition is tough among hosting services, which means that prices are 
going down. But it also means that hosting services may seem to promise the 
moon to get your business. Be sure to read the fine print and talk to the host 
before you sign a contract, and always get statements about technical support 
and backups in writing.
What’s it gonna cost?
Because of the ongoing competition in the industry, prices for web hosting 
services vary widely. If you look in the classified sections in the back of maga­
zines that cover the web or the whole Internet, you’ll see ads for hosting ser­
vices costing from $9.95 to $24.95 per month. Chances are, these prices are 
for a basic level of service: web space, e-mail addresses, domain name, and 
software. This may be all you need.
The second level of service provides CGI script processing, the ability to 
serve audio and video files on your site, regular backups, extensive site sta­
tistics, and consultants who can help you design and configure your site. 
This more sophisticated range of features typically runs from $20 to $75 or 
more per month. At Verio, for example, you can conduct secure electronic 
commerce on your site as part of hosting packages that begin at $19.95 per 
month. Its e-commerce packages include the ShopSite software mentioned 
earlier in this chapter.
Fun with Tools: Choosing 
a Web Page Editor
A woodworker has a favorite hammer and saw. A cook has an array of uten­
sils and pots and pans. Likewise, a website creator has software programs 
that facilitate the presentation of words, colors, images, and multimedia in 
web browsers.
These days, many store owners don’t worry about web editors and HTML. 
They use their storefront’s design software or a program like WordPress 
(which allows you not only to create a blog but to manage and create a full-
featured site) to do their editing. But web page editors give you the ultimate 
amount of control, and even if you use WordPress, you might have to enter 
some HTML manually once in a while. The “dashboard” view of my own 
WordPress website is shown in Figure 4-3.
	
A little HTML is a good thing — but just a little. Knowing HTML comes in 
handy when you need to add elements that web page editors don’t handle. 
Some programs, for example, don’t provide you with easy buttons or menu 
options for adding <meta> tags, which enable you to add keywords or

If you really want to get into HTML or find out more about creating web pages, 
read HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Jeff 
Noble; or Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 9th Edition, by Bud Smith.
It pays to spend time choosing a web page editor that has the right qualities. 
What qualities should you look for in a web page tool and how do you know 
which tool is right for you? To help narrow the field, I’ve divided this class of 
software into different levels of sophistication. Pick the type of program that 
best fits your technical skill.
For the novice: Use your existing programs
A growing number of word processing, graphics, and business programs are 
adding HTML to their list of capabilities. You may already have one of these 
programs at your disposal. By using a program you’re already comfortable 
with, you can avoid having to install a web page editor.
Here are some programs that enable you to generate one type of content and 
then give you the option of outputting that content in HTML, which means 
that your words or figures can appear on a web page:
	
✓	Microsoft Word: The most recent versions of the venerable word pro­
cessing standby work pretty much seamlessly with web page content. 
Although most professional web designers would say it generates messy 
code, it does get the job done for beginners. You can open web pages 
from within Word and save Word files in web page format.

102
Part I: Launching Your Online Business 
	
✓	Adobe PageMaker/Quark Xpress: The most recent versions of these 
two popular page layout programs let you save the contents of a docu­
ment as HTML. Only the words and images are transferred to the web, 
however; any special typefaces become standard, generic web headings.
	
✓	Microsoft Office: The most recent versions of Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint give users the option of exporting content to web pages.
	
✓	WordPerfect and Presentations: These two component programs within 
Corel’s suite of tools let you save files as an HTML page or a PDF file that 
you can present on the web. If you chose to present one slide per web 
page, the program adds clickable arrows to each slide in your presenta­
tion so that viewers can skip from one slide to another.
Although these solutions are convenient, they probably won’t completely 
eliminate the need to use a web page editor. Odds are you’ll still need to 
make corrections and do special formatting after you convert your text to 
HTML.
For intermediate needs: User-friendly 
web editors
If you’re an experienced web surfer and eager to try a simple web editor, 
make it a program that lets you focus on your site’s HTML and textual con­
tent, provides you with plenty of functionality, and is still easy to use. Here 
are some user-friendly programs that are inexpensive (or, better yet, free) 
and allow you to create a functional website.
	
The following programs don’t include some of the bells and whistles you need 
to create complex, interactive forms, format a page by using frames, or access 
a database of information from one of your web pages. These goodies are 
served up by web page editors that have a higher level of functionality, which 
I describe in the upcoming section for advanced commerce sites.
BBEdit
If you work on a Mac and you’re primarily concerned with textual content, 
BBEdit is one of the best choices you can make for a web page tool. It lives 
up to its motto: “It doesn’t suck.” BBEdit is tailored to use the Mac’s highly 
visual interface, and version 9.2 runs on the Mac OS 10.4 or later. You can use 
drag-and-drop to add an image file to a web page in progress by dragging the 
image’s icon into the main BBEdit window, for example. Find out more about 
BBEdit at the Bare Bones Software, Inc., website (www.barebones.com/
products/bbedit/index.html).

103
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
	
Other good choices of web editors for the Mac are Taco HTML Edit by Taco 
Software (www.tacosw.com) and PageSpinner by Optima System (www.
optima-system.com).
Macromedia HomeSite
HomeSite was an affordable tool for website designers who feel at ease 
working with HTML code. However, HomeSite is no longer being released 
or supported by its owner, Adobe Systems. If you can find a copy, though, 
try it. HomeSite also provides you with step-by-step utilities — wizards — to 
quickly create pages, tables, frames, and JavaScript elements.
CoffeeCup HTML Editor
CoffeeCup HTML Editor, by CoffeeCup Software (www.coffeecup.com), is a 
popular Windows web page editor that contains a lot of features for a small 
price ($49). You can begin typing and formatting text by using the CoffeeCup 
HTML Editor menu options. You can add an image by clicking the Insert 
Image toolbar button, or use the Forms toolbar to create the text boxes and 
radio buttons that make up an interactive web page form. You can even add 
JavaScript effects and choose from a selection of clip art images that come 
with the software.
CoffeeCup HTML Editor doesn’t let you explore database connectivity, add web 
components, or other bonuses that come with a program like Dreamweaver. 
But it does have everything you need to create a basic web page.
Nvu
When I read reviews of web page software, I don’t often see Nvu included 
in the list. But to me, it’s an ideal program for an entrepreneur on a budget. 
Why? Let me spell it out for you: F-R-E-E.
Nvu is the successor to Mozilla Composer, a web page editing and authoring 
tool that came with the full version of the Mozilla browser suite. Although 
Mozilla no longer supports Composer, you can download Nvu for free at 
http://net2.com/nvu. The software was developed by using Composer’s 
original source code. With Nvu, you can create sophisticated layout ele­
ments, such as tables (which I discuss further in Chapter 5), with an easy-to-
use graphical interface. After you edit a page, you can preview it in Firefox 
with the click of a button. In my opinion, it’s worth going through a few extra 
steps to try this program.

104

For advanced commerce sites: 
Programs that do it all
If you plan to do a great deal of business online or add the title of web 
designer to your list of talents (as some of the entrepreneurs profiled in this 
book have done), it makes sense to spend some money upfront and use a 
web page tool that can do everything you want — today and for years to 
come.
The advanced programs that I describe here go beyond the simple designa­
tion of web page editors. They not only let you edit web pages but also help 
you add interactivity to your site, link dynamically updated databases to 
your site, and keep track of how your site is organized and updated. Some 
programs can even transfer your web documents to your web host with a 
single menu option. This way, you get to concentrate on the fun part of 
running an online business — meeting people, taking orders, processing 
payments, and the like.
Editors that’ll flip your whizzy-wig
Web browsers are multilingual; they understand exotic-sounding languages, such as FTP, HTTP, 
and GIF, among others. But English is one language browsers don’t speak. Browsers don’t under­
stand instructions, such as “Put that image there” or “Make that text italic.” HyperText Markup 
Language, or HTML, is a translator, if you will, between human languages and web languages.
If the thought of HTML strikes fear into your heart, relax. Thanks to modern web page creation 
tools, you don’t have to master HTML to create web pages. Although knowing a little HTML does 
come in handy, you can depend on these special user-friendly tools to do almost all your English-
to-HTML translations.
The secret of these web page creation tools is their WYSIWYG (pronounced whizzy-wig) display. 
WYSIWYG stands for “What You See Is What You Get.” A WYSIWYG editor lets you see onscreen 
how your page looks when it’s on the web, rather than force you to type (or even see) HTML com­
mands like this:
<H1> This is a Level 1 Heading </H1>
<IMG SRC = “lucy.gif”> <BR>
<P>This is an image of Lucy.</P>
A WYSIWYG editor, such as CoffeeCup HTML Editor (www.coffeecup.com), shows you how 
the page appears even as you assemble it. Besides that, it lets you format text and add images by 
means of familiar software shortcuts such as menus and buttons.

105
 Chapter 4: Selecting Your E-Commerce Host and Design Tools
Dreamweaver
What’s that, you say? You can never have enough bells and whistles? The 
cutting edge is where you love to walk? Then Dreamweaver, a web authoring 
tool by Adobe (www.adobe.com), is for you. Dreamweaver is a feature-rich, 
professional piece of software.
Dreamweaver’s strengths aren’t so much in the basic features, such as 
making selected text bold, italic, or a different size; rather, Dreamweaver 
excels in producing Dynamic HTML (which makes web pages more interac­
tive through scripts) and HTML style sheets. Dreamweaver has ample FTP 
(File Transfer Protocol) settings, and it gives you the option of seeing the 
HTML codes you’re working with in one window and the formatting of your 
web page in a second, WYSIWYG window. The latest version is a complex and 
powerful piece of software. A recent version of Dreamweaver MX is shown in 
Figure 4-4.
	
Figure 4-4:

Dreamweaver lets you create Active Server pages and connect to the 
ColdFusion database, and it contains lots of templates and wizards. 
Dreamweaver is available for both Windows and Mac; find out more at the 
Adobe website (www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver).

Microsoft Expression Web
Expression Web is a user-friendly yet powerful editor that has strong sup­
port for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a technology that allows you to format 
multiple web pages consistently by using standard commands that all web 
browsers can interpret. The program (www.microsoft.com/en-us/
download/details.aspx?id=36179) also lets you develop websites 
with ASP.NET and XML markup. Expression Web includes Dynamic Web 
Templates — sets of web pages that have master areas that appear on each 
web page. If you make a change to the master area, the change is carried out 
through the whole site.
	
A related program from Microsoft, Silverlight, works in tandem with 
Expression Web and lets you create sites using Extensible Application Markup 
Language (XAML). Find Silverlight at www.microsoft.com/silverlight.

N

o matter what you sell or where you sell it — on the web, in a brick-
and-mortar store, or even on Facebook — you need to have a home 
base on the web, a presence. Not so long ago, a “home base” on the web auto­
matically meant a website. A website is important, but you can sell online 
without one. That’s why I use the term presence instead of site.
It’s a subtle but significant difference. A presence can include a blog, ads on 
Craigslist, exposure for your app on iTunes, or storefronts on a variety of 
marketplaces.
Wherever you do business, the same basic principles work on the web just as 
well as they do in the brick-and-mortar world. Attracting customers is impor­
tant, but real success comes from establishing relationships with customers 
who come to trust you and rely on you for providing excellent products and 
services.

110
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
This chapter focuses on creating an organized website as part of an overall 
presence to attract not only first-time, but also return customers. In this 
chapter, you explore ways to achieve these goals, including making your site 
easy to navigate, creating compelling content, optimizing your images so 
they appear quickly, and building interactivity into your site so customers 
want to return on a regular basis.
	
You might think a single website is your ultimate goal. But if you want your 
online business to be a source of full-time income or if you hope to be in busi­
ness for years to come, a website is just the start. Like many ontrepreneurs, 
you might decide to have multiple presences in different marketplaces, as 
described in Chapters 14–16. The techniques described in this chapter apply 
to those storefronts, too.
Feng Shui-ing Your Website
Feng Shui is the art of arranging objects in an environment to achieve (among 
other things) success in your career, wealth, and happiness. If that’s true, try 
practicing some Feng Shui with your online business environment — that is, 
your website.
Although you may be tempted to jump right into the creation of a cool web­
site, take a moment to plan. Whether you’re setting off on a road trip across 
the nation or building a new addition on your house, you’ll progress more 
smoothly by first drawing a map of where you want to go. Dig down into your 
miscellaneous drawer until you find pencil and paper, and make a list of the 
elements you want to have on your site.
Look over the items on your list and break them into two or three main cat­
egories. These main categories will branch off your home page, which func­
tions as the grand entrance for your online business site. You can then draw 
a map of your site similar to the one shown in Figure 5-1.
Note: The page heading Background Information is a placeholder for detailed 
information about some aspect of your online business. For my brother 
Mike’s audio restoration business, I suggested he include a page of technical 
information listing the equipment he uses and describing the steps he takes 
to process audio. You can write about your experience with and your love for 
what you buy and sell, or anything else that personalizes your site and builds 
trust.

from which 
your site 
branches 
into more 
specific 
levels of 
information.
	
The preceding example results in a very simple website. But there’s nothing 
wrong with starting out simple. When my brother was creating his first 
website, he was intimidated by getting started, and this simple model worked 
well. Many other businesses start with a three-layered organization for their 
websites. This arrangement divides the site into two sections, one about the 
company and one about the products or services for sale, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.

Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Think of your home page as the lobby of a museum, where a friendly person 
at the information desk hands you a list of the special exhibits you can visit 
that day and shows you a map so you can figure out how you’re going to get 
from here to there. Remember to include the following items on your home 
page:
	
✓	The name of the store or business
	
✓	Your logo, if you have one
	
✓	Links to the main areas of your site or, if your site isn’t overly extensive, 
to every page
	
✓	Links to your presences online — your Facebook or Twitter page, or any 
storefronts you have
	
✓	Contact information, such as your e-mail address, phone/fax numbers, 
and (optionally) your business address so that people know where to 
find you in the Land Beyond Cyberspace
A mobile version of a website strips away most or all of the images and 
colors and simply presents the content. The presentation needs to be as 
straightforward as possible so that pages load quickly on a mobile device. 
Forget about animations or multiple columns. Isolate your most important 
links in a single one-column page that is easy to read on a smartphone. 
Figure 5-3 shows a possible arrangement.
	
Figure 5-3: 
A mobile 
site’s home 
page needs 
to be simple 
and load 
quickly.
	
Some sites are “smart” enough to present a limited amount of content 
depending on whether a touch-enabled device such as an iPad is being 
used. For example, go to http://touch2.groupon.com to see a version 
of Groupon’s mobile site that has fewer links than Groupon’s desktop home 
page (www.groupon.com) and only one column. Then go to http://m.
groupon.com to see an even simpler version with fewer images.

113
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
See Chapter 19 for ten ways to make your website ready for mobile devices.
Devising a structure for your website is only one way to organize it — the 
outer or top-down organizational method, you might say. Organization also 
comes from the inside — from the content you create. The words, images, 
and interactive features that help your site get organized are discussed in the 
following sections.
Creating Content That 
Attracts Customers
What sells on the web? Look no farther than the search engine you probably 
use on a regular basis: Google. Google proves that information sells online. 
Making information easy to find and organizing much of the web’s content 
in one place has helped make this one of the most successful businesses of 
recent years. When it comes to a business website, you need to present the 
right content in the right way to make prospective clients and customers want 
Making them fall in love at first site
First impressions are critical on the web, 
where shoppers can jump from site to site with 
a click of their mouse. A few extra seconds of 
downtime waiting for videos or mini-computer 
programs — Java applets — to download can 
cause your prospective buyer to lose patience 
and you to lose a sale. (Keeping your site simple 
is especially important for mobile device users.)
How do you make visitors to your welcome 
page feel like they’re being greeted with open 
arms? Here are some suggestions:
	✓	Remember, less is more. Don’t overload 
any one page with more than half a dozen 
images. Keep all images 50KB or less in 
size. You do this by saving images with 
a resolution of 72 dpi (dots per inch), as 
described in “A picture is worth a thousand 
words,” later in this chapter.
	✓	Find a fast host. Some web servers have 
super-fast connections to the Internet and 
others use slower lines. Test your site; if 
your pages take 10 or 20 seconds or more 
to appear, ask your host company why and 
find out whether it can move you to a faster 
machine. These days, cable connections of 
1MB to 2MB are easy to find and affordable 
as well.
	✓	Offer a bargain. Nothing attracts attention 
as much as a contest, a giveaway, or 
a special sales promotion. If you have 
something you can give away, either 
through a contest or a deep discount, do it.
	✓	Provide instant gratification. Make sure 
your most important information appears 
at or near the top of your page. Visitors to 
the web don’t like having to scroll through 
several screens’ worth of material to get to 
the information they want.

114
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
to explore your site the first time and then come back for more. What, you 
ask, is the “right” content? The “right” content
	
✓	Helps people absorb information fast
	
✓	Makes it easy for visitors to find out who you are and what you have to 
offer
	
✓	Is friendly and informal in tone, concise in length, and clear in its 
organization
	
✓	Helps develop the all-important one-to-one-relationship with customers 
and clients by inviting dialogue and interaction, both with you and with 
others who share the same interests
Begin by identifying your target audience. Envision the customers you want 
to attract and make your site appear to speak directly to them, person to 
person. Ask around and try to determine what people want from your web­
site. Speak informally and directly to them, by using you rather than we or us, 
and make sure your site has plenty of action points — links to click, forms 
to fill out, or product descriptions to view. And follow the general principles 
outlined in the sections that follow.
	
Consider doing what professional marketing consultants do and write detailed 
descriptions of the individuals you’re trying to reach. Make your customer 
profiles complete with fictitious names, ages, job descriptions, type of car 
they drive, and so on. The more detailed you get, the better you can tailor 
your content to those people.
Following the KISS principle: 
Keep it simple, sir (or sister)
Studies of how information on a web page is absorbed indicate that people 
don’t really read the contents from top to bottom (or left to right, or frame to 
frame) in a linear way. In fact, most web surfers don’t read in the traditional 
sense at all. Instead, they browse so quickly you’d think they have an itchy 
mouse finger. They “flip through pages” by clicking link after link. More and 
more Internet users are swiping their index fingers on tablets, smartphones, 
and even cars with Internet-ready computer systems. Because your prospec­
tive customers don’t necessarily have tons of computing power or hours’ 
worth of time to explore your site, the best rule is to keep it simple.
	
Blogs and Twitter posts are simple and easy to read. They are also ideally 
suited for harried customers. You can use both to market your products or 
services. See Chapter 13 for more on these social networking/marketing 
strategies.

115
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
People who are looking for things on the web are often in a state of hurried 
distraction. Think about a TV watcher browsing during a commercial or a 
parent stealing a few moments on the computer while the baby naps. Imagine 
this person surfing while standing on a platform waiting for a train. He isn’t 
in the mood to listen while you unfold your fondest hopes and dreams for 
success, starting with playing grocery-store cashier as a toddler. Attract him 
immediately by answering these questions:
	
✓	Who are you, anyway?
	
✓	All right, so what is your main message or mission?
	
✓	Well, then, what do you have here for me?
	
✓	Why should I choose your site to investigate rather than all the others 
that seem to be about the same?
When it comes to web pages, it pays to put the most important components 
first: who you are, what you do, how you stand out from any competing sites, 
and your contact information.
	
People who visit a website give that site less than a minute (in fact, I’ve heard 
only 20 seconds).
If you have a long list of items to sell, you probably can’t fit everything 
you have to offer right on the first page of your site. Even if you could, you 
wouldn’t want to: It’s better to prioritize the contents of your site so that 
the “breaking stories” or the best contents appear at the top, and the rest of 
what’s in your catalog is arranged in order of importance.
	
Think long and hard before you use features that may scare people away 
instead of wow them, such as a splash page that contains only a logo or short 
greeting and then reloads automatically and takes the visitor to the main body 
of a site. I also don’t recommend loading your home page with Flash anima­
tions or Java applets that take your prospective customers’ browsers precious 
seconds to load or that might not appear on an iPad, which doesn’t support 
Flash.
Striking the right tone with your text
Business writing on the web differs from the dry, linear report writing of the 
corporate world. So this is your chance to express the real you: Talk about 
your fashion sense or your collection of salt and pepper shakers. Your busi­
ness also has a personality, and the more striking you make its description 
on your web page, the better. Use the tone of your text to define what makes 
your business unique and what distinguishes it from your competition.

116
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
Satisfied customers are another source of endorsements. Ask your customers 
whether they’re willing to provide a quote about how you helped them. If you 
don’t yet have satisfied customers, ask one or two people to try your products 
or services for free, and then, if they’re happy with your wares, ask permission 
to use their comments on your site. Your goal is to get a pithy, positive quote 
that you can put on your home page or on a page specifically devoted to 
quotes from your clients.
Making your site easy to navigate
Imagine prospective customers arriving at your website with only a fraction 
of their attention engaged. Making the links easy to read and in obvious loca­
tions makes your site easier to navigate. Having a row of clickable buttons at 
the top of your home page, each pointing to an important area of your site, is 
always a good idea. Such navigational pointers give visitors an idea of what 
your site contains in a single glance and immediately encourage them to click 
a primary subsection of your site and explore further. By placing an interac­
tive table of contents up front, you direct surfers right to the material they’re 
looking for.
The links to the most important areas of a site can go at or near the top of the 
page on either the left or right side. The Dummies.com home page, as shown 
in Figure 5-4, has a few links just above the top banner, but also sports links 
down both the left and right sides.
	
Figure 5-4: 
Putting at 
least five 
or six links 
near the 
top of your 
home page 
is a good 
idea.
	

117
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
Navigation can help with marketing: If you want to be ranked highly by search 
engines (and who doesn’t?), you have another good reason to place your site’s 
main topics near the top of the page in a series of links. Some search services 
index the first 50 or so words on a web page. Therefore, if you can get lots of 
important keywords included in that index, the chances are better that your 
site will be ranked highly in a list of links returned by the service in response 
to a search. See Chapter 11 for more on embedding keywords.
On a tablet or other mobile device, you need to arrange the most impor­
tant links without flashy graphics. Look at the mobile version of the same 
Dummies.com home page in Figure 5-5. You don’t have to design a simplified 
mobile version of your home page from scratch (although you can do so 
at www.striking.ly). Just make sure the marketplace or hosting service 
you choose automatically creates a mobile version of your site for you, as 
described in Chapter 4.

Open the web page you want to edit and follow these steps to create links to 
local files on your website by using Dreamweaver, the powerful and popular 
website creation software by Adobe Systems, Inc. (www.adobe.com):
	
1.	Select the text or image on your web page that you want to serve as 
the jumping-off point for the link.
	
2.	Choose Insert➪Link or press Ctrl+L.
	
	 The Link Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
	
3.	In the box in the Link Location section, enter the name of the file you 
want to link to if you know the filename.

118
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
Figure 5-6: 
Enter the 
name of 
the file you 
want to  
link to.
	
	
	 If the page you want to link to is in the same directory as the page that 
contains the jumping-off point, enter only the name of the web page. If 
the page is in another directory, enter a path relative to the web page 
that contains the link. Or click the Choose File button, locate the file in 
the Open HTML File dialog box, and click the Open button.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 You return to the Composer window. If you made a textual link, the 
selected text is underlined and in a different color. If you made an image 
link, a box appears around the image.
Presenting the reader with links up front doesn’t just help your search engine 
rankings, but also indicates that your site is content-rich and worthy of 
exploration.
Building an online presence takes time
Judy Vorfeld, who goes by the nom de Net Webgrammar, knows all about finding different ways 
to attract regular clientele. And she knows how important it is to have good content in a business 
website. She started the online version of her business, Office Support Services (www.ossweb.
com), from her home in Arizona in early 1998. She now has a second business site (www.
editingandwritingservices.com) and a third (www.webgrammar.com), which serve 
as resources for students, educators, writers, and web developers.
I’ve been following Judy for several years now, and I noticed that she’s followed a popular business 
trend: She started her own blog. Her home page, which is also her blog page, displays photos of 
flowers, wildlife, and other scenes from her personal life. She knows that on the web, getting 
personal lets you strike up a relationship with potential clients and builds interest as well as trust. 
“It’s difficult to separate who I am from what I do, and almost everything I do in terms of work is 
based on some kind of presentation or communication,” she comments. “Thus, the photos.”
Q. What would you describe as the primary goal of your online business?
A. To help small businesses achieve excellent presentation and communication by copyediting 
their print documents, books, and websites.

Q. How many hours a week do you work on your business sites?
A. Three to six hours, which includes my syndicated writing tips, surveys, and newsletter, 
Communication Expressway (www.ossweb.com/ezine-archive-index.html).
Q. How do you promote your site?
A. I participate in newsgroups, write articles for Internet publications, add my URLs to good search 
engines and directories, moderate discussion lists and forums for others, offer free articles and tips 
on my sites, and network locally and on the web.
Q. Has your online business been profitable financially?
A. Yes, although slowly. I rarely raise my rates because my skills seem best suited to the small 
business community, and I want to offer fees these people can afford.
Q. Who creates your business’s web pages?
A. Basic design is done by a web designer, and I take over from there. I want the ability to make 
extensive and frequent changes in text and design. I do hire someone to format my e-zine pages, 
graphics, and programming.
Q. What advice would you give to someone starting an online business?
A. I have a bunch of suggestions to give, based on my own experience:
	✓	Network. Network with small business people who have complementary businesses and 
with those who have similar businesses. Also, network by joining professional associations 
participating in the activities. Volunteer time and expertise. Link to these organizations from 
your site.
	✓	Join newsgroups and forums. Study netiquette first. Lurk until you can adequately answer a 
question or make a comment. Also, keep on the lookout for someone with whom you can build a 
relationship, someone who might mentor you and be willing to occasionally scrutinize your site, 
news releases, and so on. This person must be brutally honest, and perhaps you can informally 
offer one of your own services in return.
	✓	Learn web development and the culture. Get a Twitter account (www.twitter.com). 
Subscribe to some blogs at Blogger (www.blogger.com). Learn the lingo. Even if you don’t 
do the actual design, you have to make decisions on all the offers you receive regarding how 
to make money via affiliate programs, link exchanges, hosts, web design software, and so on. 
Keeping active online and making those judgments yourself is vital unless you thoroughly trust 
your webmaster. Find online discussion lists that handle all areas of web development, and 
keep informed.
	✓	Include a web page that shows your business biography or profile. Mention any volunteer 
work you do, groups to which you belong, and anything else you do in and for the community. 
You need to paint as clear a picture as possible in just a few words. Avoid showcasing your 
talents and hobbies on a business site unless they’re directly related to your business.

Pointing the way with headings
Every web page needs to contain headings that direct the reader’s attention 
to the most important contents. This book provides a good example. The 
chapter title (I hope) piques your interest first. Then the section headings 
and subheadings direct you to more details on the topics you want to read 
about.
Most graphics designers label their heads with the letters of the alphabet: A, 
B, C, and so on. In a similar fashion, most web page–editing tools designate 
top-level headings with the style Heading 1. Beneath this, you place one or 
more Heading 2 headings. Beneath each of those, you may have Heading 3 
and, beneath those, Heading 4. (Headings 5 and 6 are too small to be useful, 
in my opinion.) The arrangement may look like this (I’ve indented the follow­
ing headings for clarity; you don’t have to indent them on your page):
Miss Cookie’s Delectable Cooking School (Heading 1)
   Kitchen Equipment You Can’t Live Without (Heading 2)
   The Story of a Calorie Counter Gone Wrong (Heading 2)
   Programs of Culinary Study (Heading 2)
      Registration (Heading 3)
      Course Schedule (Heading 3)
         New Course on Whipped Cream Just Added! (Heading 4)
(continued)
	✓	In everything you write, speak to your visitors. Use the word you as much as possible. Avoid 
the words I, we, and us. You, as a businessperson, are there to connect with your visitors. 
You can’t give them eye contact, but you can let them know that they matter, that they’re (in a 
sense) the reason for your being there.
	✓	Become known as a specialist in a given field. Be someone who can always answer a question 
or go out and find the answer. Your aim is to get as many potential clients or customers to your 
site as possible, not to get millions of visitors. Forget numbers and concentrate on creating a 
site that grabs the attention of your target market.
	✓	Get help. If you can’t express yourself well with words (and/or graphics), and know little about 
layout, formatting, and so on, hire someone to help you. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief if you 
get a capable, trustworthy editor or designer.
She concludes, “Don’t start such a business unless you are passionate about it and willing to give 
it some time and an initial investment. But when you do start, resources are everywhere — many 
of them free — to help people build their businesses successfully.”

121
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
You can energize virtually any heading by telling your audience something 
specific about your business. Instead of “Ida’s Antiques Mall,” for example, say 
something like “Ida’s Antiques Mall: The Perfect Destination for the Collector 
and the Crafter.” Instead of simply writing a heading like “Stan Thompson, Pet 
Grooming,” say something specific, such as “Stan Thompson: We Groom Your 
Pet at Our Place or Yours.”
Becoming an expert list maker
Lists are simple and effective ways to break up text and make your web con­
tent easier to digest. They’re easy to create and easy for your customer to 
view and absorb. Suppose that you import your own decorations and want to 
offer certain varieties at a discount during various seasons. Rather than bury 
the items you’re offering within an easily overlooked paragraph, why not 
divide your list into subgroups so that visitors find what they want without 
being distracted by holidays they don’t even celebrate?
Lists are easy to implement. If you’re using Microsoft Expression Web (a trial 
version is available at www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.
aspx?id=36179), open your web page and follow these steps:
	
1.	Type a heading for your list and then select the entire heading.
	
	 For example, you might type and then select the words This Month’s 
Specials.
	
2.	Choose a heading style from the Style drop-down list.
	
	 Your text is formatted as a heading.
	
3.	Click anywhere in Expression Web’s Design View (the main editing 
window) to deselect the heading you just formatted.
	
4.	Press Enter to move to a new line.
	
5.	Type the first item of your list, press Enter, and then type the second 
item on the next line.
	
6.	Repeat Step 5 until you enter all the items of your list.
	
7.	Select all the items of your list (but not the heading).
	
8.	Choose Format➪Bullets and Numbering.
	
	The List Properties dialog box appears.
	
9.	Choose one of the four bullet styles and click OK.
	
	 A bullet appears next to each list item, and the items appear closer 
together onscreen so that they look more like a list. That’s all there is to 
it! Figure 5-7 shows the result.

122
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
Figure 5-7: 
A bulleted 
list is an 
easy way 
to direct 
customers’ 
attention to 
special pro-
motions or 
sale items.
	
Most web editors let you vary the appearance of the bullet. For example, you 
can make the bullet a hollow circle rather than a solid black dot, or you can 
choose a rectangle rather than a circle.
Leading your readers on with links
I mean for you to interpret the preceding heading literally, not figuratively. In 
other words, I’m not suggesting that you make promises you can’t deliver on. 
Rather, I mean that you should do anything you can to lead your visitors to 
your site and then get them to stay long enough to explore individual pages. 
You can accomplish this goal with a single hyperlinked word that leads to 
another page on your site:
More . . .
I see this word all the time on web pages that present a lot of content. At the 
bottom of a list of their products and services, businesses place that word 
in bold type: More . . . I’m always interested in finding out what more they 
could possibly have to offer me.
Magazines use the same approach. On their covers you find phrases that 
refer you to the kinds of stories you find inside. You can do the same kind of 
thing on your web pages. For example, which of the following links is more 
likely to get a response?
Next

123
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
Whenever possible, tell your visitors what they can expect to encounter as a 
benefit when they click a link. Give them a tease — and then a big payoff for 
responding.
Enhancing your text with 
vwell-placed images
You can add two kinds of images to a web page: an inline image, which 
appears in the body of your page along with your text, or an external image, 
which is a separate file that visitors access by clicking a link. The link may 
take the form of highlighted text or a small version of the image — a thumb­
nail. You see lots of thumbnails when you do a search for images on Google 
Images (http://images.google.com).
	
The basic HTML tag that inserts an image in your document takes the 
following form:
<img src=”URL”>
This tag tells your browser to display an image (<img>) here. “URL” gives 
the location of the image file that serves as the source (src) for this image. 
Whenever possible, also include width and height attributes (as follows) 
because they help speed up graphics display for many browsers:
<img height=51 width=48 SRC=”target.gif”>
Your web page title: The ultimate heading
When you’re dreaming up clever headings for 
your web pages, don’t overlook the “heading” 
that appears in the narrow title bar at the very 
top of your visitor’s web browser window: the 
title of your web page.
The two HTML tags <title> and </title> 
contain the text that appears within the browser 
title bar. But you don’t have to mess with these 
nasty HTML codes: All web page–creation 
programs give you an easy way to enter or edit 
a title for a web page. Make the title as catchy 
and specific as possible, but make sure it’s no 
longer than 64 characters, including spaces. An 
effective title refers to your goods or services 
while grabbing the viewer’s attention. If your 
business is Myrna’s Cheesecakes, for example, 
you might make your title “Smile and Say 
Cheese! with Myrna’s Cakes” (40 characters, 
including spaces).

124
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Most web page editors add the width and height attributes automatically 
when you insert an image. Typically, here’s what happens:
	
1.	Click the location in the web page where you want the image to 
appear.
	
2.	Click an Image toolbar button or choose Insert➪Image to display an 
image selection dialog box.
	
3.	Enter the name of the image you want to add and click OK.
	
	 The image is added to your web page.
A well-placed image points the way to text that you want people to read 
immediately. Think about where your own eyes go when you first connect to 
a web page. Most likely, you first look at any images on the page; then you 
look at the headings; finally, you settle on text to read. If you can place an 
image next to a heading, you virtually ensure that viewers read the heading.
Making your site searchable
A search box is one of the best kinds of content you can put on your web­
site’s opening page. A search box is a simple text-entry field that lets a visitor 
enter a word or phrase. Clicking a button labeled Go or Search sends the 
search term or terms to the site, where a script checks an index of the site’s 
contents for any files that contain those terms. The script then lists docu­
ments that contain the search terms in the visitor’s browser window.
Search boxes are not only found, but are expected to be found, on virtually 
all commercial websites. You usually see them at the top of the home page, 
near the links to the major sections of the site. Dummies.com, shown in 
Figure 5-8, includes a search box on the left side of the page.
Search boxes let visitors instantly scan the site’s entire contents for a word 
or phrase. They put visitors in control right away and get them to interact 
with your site. They’re popular for some very good reasons.
	
Search boxes require someone with knowledge of computer programming 
to create or implement a program called a CGI script to do the searching. 
Someone also has to compile an index of the documents on the website so 
that the script can search the documents. An application such as ColdFusion 
works well, but it’s not a program for beginners.

125
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
Figure 5-8: 
Many surf-
ers prefer 
using a 
search box 
to clicking 
links.
	
But you can get around having to write CGI scripts to add search capabilities 
to your site. Choose one of these options:
	
✓	Let your web host do the work. Some hosting services do the index­
ing and creation of the search utility as part of their services. Nearly all 
shopping carts and e-commerce storefront hosting services do.
	
✓	Use a free site search service. The server that does the indexing of 
your web pages and holds the index doesn’t need to be the server that 
hosts your site. Some services make your site searchable for free. In 
exchange, you display advertisements or logos in the search results you 
return to your visitors.
	
✓	Pay for a search service. If you don’t want to display ads on your search 
results pages, pay a monthly fee to have a company index your pages 
and let users conduct searches. FreeFind (www.freefind.com) has 
some economy packages, a free version that forces you to view ads, and 
a professional version that costs $19 per month for a site of 3,000 pages 
or less and $39 per month for a site of 6,000 pages or less. SiteMiner 
(http://siteminer.mycomputer.com) charges $19.95 per month 
and lets you customize your search box and re-index your site whenever 
you add new content.

126
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Make a map of your website
Maps are especially important when navigating 
the information superhighway. When it comes 
to your e-commerce website, a map can make 
your site easier to navigate. A site map is a 
graphical representation of your website — a 
diagram that graphically depicts all the pages in 
the site and how they connect to one another. 
Some web page editing programs, such as the 
now-defunct Microsoft FrontPage, had a site 
map function built into them. When you create 
pages and link them to one another, a site map 
is created. The following figure shows the site 
map on the left side of the window and a list of 
files on the right.
You don’t have to invest in a fancy (and 
expensive) software program to create a site 
map. You can create one the old-fashioned 
way, with a pencil and paper. Or you can draw 
boxes and arrows using a computer graphics 
program. The point is that your site map can 
be a useful design tool for organizing the 
documents within your site.
If your sales are sluggish, make sure that 
your customers can actually find what they’re 
looking for. Take a typical product in your sales 
catalog and then visit your own site to see how 
many clicks someone would need to make to 
find it. Then see how many clicks that person 
would need to make to complete the purchase. 
Eliminating any unnecessary navigational 
layers (such as category opening pages) makes 
your site easier to use.

127
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
You say you’re up to making your site searchable, but you shudder at the 
prospect of either writing your own computer script or finding and editing 
someone else’s script to index your site’s contents and actually do the 
searching? Then head over to Atomz Site Search (www.atomz.com) and 
check out its site search hosted application. Other organizations that offer 
similar services include FreeFind (www.freefind.com), PicoSearch (www.
picosearch.com), and Webinator (www.thunderstone.com/texis/
site/pages/webinator.html).
Nip and Tuck: Establishing 
a Visual Identity
The prospect of designing a website may be intimidating if you haven’t tried 
it before. But it really boils down to a simple principle: effective visual commu­
nication that conveys a particular message. The first step in creating graphics 
is not to open a painting program and start drawing, but to plan your page’s 
message. Next, determine the audience you want to reach with that message 
and think about how your graphics can best communicate what you want to 
say. Some ways to do this are
	
✓	Gather ideas from websites that use graphics well. Award-winning sites 
and sites created by designers who are using graphics in new or unusual 
ways can help you. To find some award winners, check out The Webby 
Awards (www.webbyawards.com) and the WebAward Competition 
(www.webaward.org).
	
✓	Use graphics consistently from page to page. You can create an identity 
and convey a consistent message.
	
✓	Know your audience. Create graphics that meet visitors’ needs and 
expectations. If you’re selling fashions to teenagers, go for neon colors 
and out-there graphics. If you’re selling financial planning to senior citi­
zens, choose a distinguished and sophisticated typeface.
	
How do you become acquainted with your customers when it’s likely you’ll 
never actually meet them face to face? Find newsgroups and mailing lists in 
which potential visitors to your site discuss subjects related to what you plan 
to publish on the web. Read the posted messages to get a sense of the con­
cerns and vocabulary of your intended audience.

128
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Choosing wallpaper that won’t 
make you a wallflower
The technical term for the wallpaper behind the contents of a web page is 
its background. Most web browsers display the background of a page as light 
gray or white unless you specify something different. In this case, leaving well 
enough alone isn’t good enough. If you choose the wrong background color 
(one that makes your text hard to read and your images look like they’ve 
been smeared with mud), viewers are likely to get the impression that the 
page is poorly designed or the author of the page hasn’t put a great deal of 
thought into the project.
Most web page–creation programs offer a simple way to specify a color or 
an image file to serve as the background of a web page. For example, in the 
free editor Komodo Edit, you Ctrl-click the value next to the background-
color command in the style sheet for the page you’re working on (the sec­
tion between the <style> and </style> tags). When the Color dialog box 
opens, click the color you want and then click OK. The hexadecimal code for 
your chosen color is added to the style sheet.
Color your website effective
You can use background and other colors to elicit a particular mood or emo­
tion and convey your organization’s identity on the web. The right choice of 
color can create impressions ranging from elegant to funky.
The basic colors chosen by the United Parcel Service website (www.ups.
com) convey to customers that it is a staid and reliable company, and the U.S. 
Postal Service (www.usps.com) sticks to the patriotic choice of red, white, 
and blue. In contrast, the designers of the nearly 20-year-old HotHotHot hot 
sauce site (www.hothothot.com) combine fiery colors to convey a site that 
sizzles.
When selecting colors for your web pages, consider the demographics of 
your target audience. Do some research on what emotions or impressions 
are conveyed by different colors and which colors best match the mission or 
identity of your business. Refer to resources, such as the online essay “How 
to Get a Professional Look With Color” by Webdesigner Depot (www.web
designerdepot.com/2009/12/how-to-get-a-professional-look-
with-color), which examines how color choices make web surfers react 
differently.
	
The colors you use must have contrast so that they don’t blend into one 
another. For example, you don’t want to put purple type on a brown or blue 
background, or yellow type on a white background. Remember to use light 
type against a dark background and dark type against a light background. That 
way, all your page’s contents show up.

129
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
Tile images in the background
You can use an image rather than a solid color to serve as the background of 
a page. You specify an image in the style sheet code of your web page, and 
browsers automatically tile the image, reproducing it over and over to fill the 
current width and height of the browser window.
The fact is that few, if any, professional designers use background images 
any more. Background images worked only when they were subtle and didn’t 
interfere with the page contents. Often, they were distracting. The emphasis 
these days is on easily accessible and readable content. Focus on that and 
make sure the background complements rather than interferes with your 
page’s design. Choose an image with no obvious lines that create a distract­
ing pattern when tiled. The effect you’re trying to create should literally 
resemble wallpaper. Go to Google Images (http://images.google.com) 
and search for examples of background images that add something to a 
page’s design.
Using web typefaces like a pro
If you create a web page and don’t specify that the text be displayed in a par­
ticular font, the browser that displays the page uses its default font — which 
is usually Times New Roman or Helvetica (although individual users can cus­
tomize their browsers by picking a different default font).
If you want to specify a typeface, the simplest option is to pick a generic font 
that is built into virtually every computer’s operating system. This conven­
tion ensures that your web pages look more or less the same no matter what 
web browser or what type of computer displays them. A few choices avail­
able to you are Arial, Courier, Century Schoolbook, and Times New Roman.
However, you don’t have to limit yourself to the same-old/same-old. As a web 
page designer, you can exercise a degree of control over the appearance of 
your web page by specifying that the body type and headings be displayed in 
a particular nonstandard font. You have to own the font you want to use; you 
save it on your computer and identify the font and location in the cascading 
style sheets (CSS) for your website.
	
You can copy unusual fonts from dafont.com (www.dafont.com). Its creators 
sometimes ask for donations for their work. You can generate CSS commands 
for such typefaces with the aid of Font Squirrel’s Webfont Generator (www.
fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). You then copy and 
paste the CSS into the style sheet for your page so you can use the font for 
either headings or body text.

130
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Where do you specify type fonts, colors, and sizes for the text? Again, special 
HTML tags or CSS commands tell web browsers what fonts to display, but 
you don’t need to mess with these tags yourself if you’re using a web page 
creation tool. The specific steps you take depend on what web design tool 
you’re using. In Dreamweaver, you can specify a group of preferred typefaces 
rather than a single font in the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 5-9. 
If the viewer doesn’t have one font in the group, another font displays. Check 
the Help files with your own program to find out how to format text and what 
typeface options you have.
	
Figure 5-9: 
Most web 
page design 
tools let you 
specify a 
preferred 
font or fonts 
for your web 
page in a 
dialog box 
like this.
	
	
Not all typefaces are equal in the eye of the user. Serif typefaces, such as 
Times New Roman, are considered more readable (at least, for printed materi­
als) than sans-serif fonts, such as Helvetica. However, an article on the Web 
Marketing Today website (http://webmarketingtoday.com/articles/
html-email-fonts) found that by a whopping 2:1 margin, the sans serif font 
Arial is considered more readable on a web page than Times New Roman.
	
If you want to make sure that a heading or block of type appears in a specific 
typeface (especially a nonstandard one that isn’t displayed as body text by 
web browsers), scan it or create the heading in an image-editing program and 
insert it into the page as a graphic image. But make sure it doesn’t clash with 
the generic typefaces that appear on the rest of your page.

131
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
Using clip art is free and fun
Not everyone has the time or resources to scan photos or create original 
graphics. But that doesn’t mean you can’t add graphic interest to your web 
page. Many web page designers use clip-art bullets, diamonds, or other small 
images next to list items or major web page headings that they want to call 
special attention to. Clip art can also provide a background pattern for a web 
page or highlight sales headings, such as Free!, New!, or Special!.
When I first started in the print publications business, I bought catalogs 
of illustrations, literally clipped out the art, and pasted it down. It’s still 
called clip art, but now the process is different. In keeping with the spirit 
of exchange that has been a part of the Internet since its inception, some 
talented and generous artists have created icons, buttons, and other illustra­
tions in electronic form and offered them free for downloading.
Here are some suggestions for tried-and-true sources of clip art on the web:
	
✓	Clipart.com (www.clipart.com/en)
	
✓	Clip Art Universe (http://clipartuniverse.com)
	
✓	The Yahoo! page full of links to clip art resources (http://dir.yahoo.
com/computers_and_internet/graphics/clip_art)
	
If you use Microsoft Office, you have access to plenty of clip art images that 
come with the software. In Word, choose Insert➪Clip Art to open the Insert 
Clip Art dialog box. If these built-in images aren’t sufficient, you can con­
nect to the Microsoft Clip Gallery Live website by clicking the Clips Online 
toolbar button in the Insert Clip Art dialog box. Web page editors — such as 
CoffeeCup HTML Editor — come with their own clip art libraries, too.
	
Be sure to read the copyright fine print before you copy graphics. All artists 
own the copyright to their work. It’s up to them to determine how they want 
to give someone else the right to copy their work. Sometimes, the authors 
require you to pay a small fee if you want to copy their work, or they may 
restrict use of their work to nonprofit organizations.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Some customers know exactly what they want from the get-go and don’t need 
any help from you. But most customers love to shop around or could use 
some encouragement to move from one item or catalog page to another. This 
is where images can play an important role.

132
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Even if you use only some basic clip art, such as placing spheres or arrows 
next to sale items, your customer is likely to thank you by buying more. A 
much better approach, though, is to scan or take digital images of your sale 
items and provide compact, clear images of them on your site. Here’s a quick 
step-by-step guide to get you started:
	
1.	Choose the right image to capture.
	
	 The original quality of an image is just as important as how you scan or 
retouch it. Images that are murky or fuzzy in print are even worse when 
viewed on a computer screen.
	
2.	Preview the image.
	
	 Digital cameras let you preview images so that you can decide whether 
to keep or delete individual pictures before downloading to your com­
puter. If you’re working with a scanner, some scanning programs let 
you make a quick preview scan of an image so that you can get an idea 
of what it looks like before you do the actual scan. When you click the 
Preview button, the optical device in the scanner captures the image. A 
preview image appears onscreen, surrounded by a marquee box (a 
rectangle made up of dashes), as shown in Figure 5-10.
	
Figure 5-10: 
The mar-
quee box 
lets you 
crop a pre-
view image 
to make it 
smaller and 
reduce the 
file size.
	
	
3.	Crop the image.
	
	 Cropping means that you resize the box around the image to select the 
portion of the image that you want to keep and leave out the parts of the 
image that aren’t essential. Cropping an image is a good idea because 
it highlights the most important contents and reduces the file size. 
Reducing the file size of an image should always be one of your most 
important goals — the smaller the image, the quicker it appears in some­
one’s browser window.

133
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
	 Almost all scanning and graphics programs offer separate options for 
cropping an image and reducing the image size. By cropping the image, 
you eliminate parts of the image you don’t want, and this does reduce 
the image size. But it doesn’t reduce the size of the objects within the 
image. Resizing the overall image size is a separate step, which enables 
you to change the dimensions of the entire image without eliminating 
any contents.
	
4.	Select an input mode.
	
	 Tell the scanner or graphics program how you want it to save the visual 
data — as color, line art (used for black-and-white drawings), or grayscale 
(used for black-and-white photos).
	
5.	Set the resolution.
	
	 Digital images are made up of little bits (dots) of computerized informa­
tion called pixels. The more pixels per inch, the higher the level of detail. 
When you scan an image, you can tell the scanner to make the dots 
smaller (creating a smoother image) or larger (resulting in a more jagged 
image). This adjustment is called setting the resolution of the image. 
(When you take a digital photo, the resolution of the image depends on 
your camera’s settings.)
	
	 When you’re scanning for the web, your images appear primarily on 
computer screens. Because many computer monitors can display reso­
lutions only up to 72 dpi, 72 dpi — a relatively rough resolution — is 
an adequate resolution for a web image. Using this coarse resolution 
has the advantage of keeping the image’s file size small. Remember, 
the smaller the file size, the more quickly an image appears when your 
customers load your page in their web browsers. (Alternatively, many 
designers scan at a fine resolution such as 300 dpi and reduce the file 
size in a graphics program.)
	
6.	Adjust contrast and brightness.
	
	 Virtually all scanning programs and graphics editing programs provide 
brightness and contrast controls that you can adjust with your mouse to 
improve the image. If you’re happy with the image as is, leave the bright­
ness and contrast set where they are. (You can also leave the image as is 
and adjust brightness and contrast later in a separate graphics program, 
such as Paint Shop Pro X5, which you can try out by downloading it 
from the Corel website, www.corel.com/corel.) Or if you’re working 
on the iPhone, check out the Clarity app (http://campl.us/feature/
clarity), which dramatically improves so-so images. 
	
7.	Reduce the image size.
	
	 The old phrase “Good things come in small packages” is never more 
true than when you’re improving your digital image. If you’re scanning 
an image that is 8" x 10" and you’re sure that it needs to be about 4" x 5" 
when it appears on your web page, scan it at 50 percent of the original 

134
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
size. This step reduces the file size and makes the file easier to trans­
port, whether it’s from your camera to your computer or your computer 
to your hosting service. Even more important, it appears more quickly in 
someone’s web browser.
	
8.	Scan away!
	
	 Your scanner makes a beautiful whirring sound as it turns those 
colors into pixels. Because you’re scanning only at 72 dpi, the process 
shouldn’t take too long.
	
9.	Save the file.
	
	 Now you can save your image to disk. Most programs let you do this 
by choosing File➪Save. In the dialog box that appears, enter a name for 
your file and select a file format. (Because you’re working with images 
to be published on the web, remember to save either in GIF or JPEG 
format.)
	
Be sure to add the correct filename extension. Web browsers recognize only 
image files with extensions such as .gif, .jpg, or .jpeg. If you name your 
image product and save it in GIF format, call it product.gif. If you save it 
in JPEG format and you’re using a PC, call it product.jpg. On a Mac, call it 
product.jpeg.

Edition, by Mark L. Chambers.
Creating a logo
An effective logo establishes your online business’s graphic identity in no 
uncertain terms. A logo can be as simple as a rendering of the company name 
that imparts an official typeface or color. Whatever text it includes, a logo is 
a small, self-contained graphic object that conveys the group’s identity and 
purpose. Figure 5-11 shows an example of a logo.
	
A logo doesn’t have to be a fabulously complex drawing with drop shadows 
and gradations of color. A simple, type-only logo can be as good as gold. Pick a 
typeface, choose your graphic’s outline version, and fill the letters with color.

GIF, JPEG, and PNG
Website technology and HTML may have 
changed dramatically over the past several 
years, but for the most part, there are still only 
three types of images as far as web pages 
are concerned: GIF, JPEG, and PNG. All three 
formats use methods that compress computer 
image files so that the visual information 
contained within them can be transmitted easily 
over computer networks. PNG, a third format 
designed several years ago as a successor to 
GIF, is slowly becoming more popular and is far 
superior in terms of compression and image 
quality, especially when it comes to photos.
GIF (pronounced either jiff or giff) stands for 
Graphics Interchange Format. GIF is best 
suited to text, line art, or images with well-
defined edges. Special types of GIF allow 
images with transparent backgrounds to be 
interlaced (broken into layers that appear 
gradually over slow connections) and 
animated. JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) stands 
for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name 
of the group that originated the format. JPEG 
is preferred for large photos and continuous 
tones of grayscale or color that need greater 
compression.
If you have a choice, I suggest you try PNG 
(Portable Network Graphics). Its images are 
ideal for the web. The quality is so good that I’ve 
even blown up images, printed them on a color 
inkjet printer, and put them on the wall of my 
office. And PNG is supported by all the major 
browsers, so you’ll have no problem getting 
your visitors to enjoy them.

Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Inviting Comments from Customers
Quick, inexpensive, and personal: These are three of the most important advan­
tages that the web has over traditional printed catalogs. The first two are obvi­
ous pluses. You don’t have to wait for your online catalog to get printed and 
distributed. On the web, your contents are published and available to your cus­
tomers right away. Putting a catalog on the web eliminates (or, if publishing a 
catalog on the web allows you to reduce your print run, dramatically reduces) 
the cost of printing, which can result in big savings for you.
But the fact that online catalogs can be more personal than the printed vari­
ety is perhaps the biggest advantage of all. The personal touch comes from 
the web’s potential for interactivity. Getting your customers to click links 
makes them actively involved with your catalog.
Getting positive e-mail feedback
Playing hide-and-seek is fun when you’re amusing your baby niece, but it’s 
not a good way to build a solid base of customers. In fact, providing a way for 
your customers to interact with you so that they can reach you quickly may 
be the most important part of your website.
Add a simple mailto link like this:
Questions? Comments? Send e-mail to: info@mycompany.com
A mailto link gets its name from the HTML command that programmers 
use to create it. When visitors click the e-mail address, their e-mail pro­
gram opens a new e-mail message window with your e-mail address already 
entered. That way, they have only to enter a subject line, type the message, 
and click Send to send you their thoughts.
Most web page–creation programs make it easy to create a mailto link. For 
example, if you use Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
	
1.	Launch and open the web page to which you want to add your e-mail 
link.
	
2.	Position your mouse arrow and click the spot on the page where you 
want the address to appear.
	
	 The convention is to put your e-mail address at or near the bottom of a 
web page. A vertical blinking cursor appears at the location where you 
want to insert the address.
	
3.	Choose Insert➪Email Link.

137
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
	
	 The Insert Email Link dialog box appears.
	
4.	In the Text box, type the text that you want to appear on your web 
page.
	
	You don’t have to type your e-mail address; you can also type 
Webmaster, Customer Service, or your own name.
	
5.	In the E-Mail box, type your e-mail address.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 The Insert Email Link dialog box closes, and you return to the 
Dreamweaver Document window, where your e-mail link appears in blue 
and is underlined to signify that it is a clickable link.
Other editors work similarly but don’t give you a menu command called 
Email Link. In that case, you have to type the mailto link manually. In the 
WordPress editor, select the text you want to serve as the link and click the 
link toolbar icon. When the Insert/Edit Link dialog box opens, in the URL box, 
after http:// (which is pre-entered), you type mailto:name@emailaddress.
	
The drawback to publishing your e-mail address directly on your web page is 
that you’re certain to get unsolicited e-mail messages (commonly called spam) 
sent to that address. Hiding your e-mail address behind generic link text (such 
as Webmaster) may help reduce your chances of attracting spam.
Web page forms that aren’t offputting
You don’t have to do much web surfing before you become intimately 
acquainted with how web page forms work, at least from the standpoint of 
someone who has to fill them out to sign up for web hosting or to download 
software.
When it comes to creating your own website, however, you become con­
scious of how useful forms are as a means of gathering essential marketing 
information about your customers. They give your visitors a place to sound 
off, ask questions, and generally get involved with your online business.
Be clear and use common sense when creating your order form. Here are 
some general guidelines on how to organize your form and what you need to 
include:
	
✓	Make it easy on the customer. Whenever possible, add pull-down 
menus with pre-entered options to your form fields (text boxes that visi­
tors use to enter information). That way, users don’t have to wonder 
about things such as whether you want them to spell out a state or use 
the two-letter abbreviation.

138
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
✓	Validate the information. You can use a programming language — for 
example, JavaScript — to ensure that users enter information correctly, 
that all fields are completely filled out, and so on. You may have to hire 
someone to add the appropriate code to the order form, but the expense 
is worth it to save you from having to call customers to verify or correct 
information that they missed or submitted incorrectly.
	
✓	Provide a help number. Give people a number to call if they have ques­
tions or want to check on an order.
	
✓	Return an acknowledgment. Let customers know that you have 
received their order and will be shipping the merchandise immediately 
or contacting them if more information is needed.
As usual, good web page–authoring and –editing programs make it a snap to 
create the text boxes, check boxes, buttons, and other parts of a form that 
the user fills out. The other part of a form, the computer script that receives 
the data and processes it so that you can read and use the information, is not 
as simple. And programs like WordPress provide you with a host of add-on 
applications — plugins — that create both the text entry elements and the 
scripts for you.
	
Not so long ago, you had to write or edit a scary CGI script to set up forms 
processing on your website. Now you can use WordPress plugins, or if you 
use another application, check out a service like Response-O-Matic (www.
response-o-matic.com) or FormMail.To (www.formmail.to/formmail.
to). These lead you through the process of setting up a form and providing 
you with the CGI script that receives the data and forwards it to you.
Blogs that promote discussion
Most blogs give readers the chance to respond to individual comments the 
author has made. On my own blog, for instance, which was created with 
WordPress, I make comments, and readers can immediately respond. This 
is a standard feature to give readers the opportunity to comment on what 
you’ve written.
On blogs that attract a wide following, like Talking Points Memo (www.talking
pointsmemo.com), comments by multiple authors generate long discussions 
by a community of devoted readers. (Find out more about blogs in Chapter 1.)
The comments that appear at the end of an article or blog post have replaced 
what web designers used to call a guestbook — a place where visitors signed 
in so they could feel that they’re part of a thriving community. If you use 

139
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
WordPress to create and manage a blog or website, you can easily give visi­
tors the ability to comment on an article. If you have created a blog, each 
post is automatically “commentable.” That’s one of the many nice things 
about WordPress. You just have to make sure commenting is turned on.
Log in to WordPress and click Settings under the heading Admin Options 
in the narrow column on the left side of the editing window. Then click 
Discussion, as shown in Figure 5-12, and select the Allow check box so people 
can post comments on new articles.
	
Figure 5-12: 
WordPress 
easily lets 
you manage 
comments 
for an entire 
site.
	
To enable comments on an individual page, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click Pages in the Admin settings in the narrow column on the left 
side of the editing window.
	
	 The list of pages in your WordPress site appears.
	
2.	Click the page you want, and if necessary, click Quick Edit.
	
	 The Quick Edit window for your page opens.
	
3.	Scroll down to the Discussion section and select the Allow check box.
After you allow comments, be sure to log in to your site regularly to moder­
ate them. You’ll probably have to delete spam comments left by bots (pro­
grams that perform automated functions such as “scraping” web pages for 
contents) that post them automatically and respond to legitimate comments 
that actual human beings have left.

140
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Chit-chat that counts
After visitors start coming to your site, the next step is to retain those visi­
tors. A good way to do this is by building a sense of community by posting a 
bulletin board–type discussion area.
A discussion area takes the form of back-and-forth messages on topics of 
mutual interest. Each person can read previously posted messages and either 
respond or start a new topic of discussion. The comments areas discussed 
in the preceding section are the most popular ways of promoting this sort of 
interaction. For a more elaborate example of a discussion area that’s tied to 
an online business, visit the EcommerceBytes (www.ecommercebytes.com) 
discussion areas, one of which is shown in Figure 5-13. EcommerceBytes is 
a highly regarded site that provides information about the online auction 
industry. Its discussion boards give readers a place to bring up questions and 
issues in a forum that’s independent from those provided by auction sites 
like eBay.
	
Figure 5-13: 
A discus-
sion area 
stimulates 
interest and 
interac-
tion among 
like-minded 
customers.
	
The talk doesn’t have to be about your particular niche in your business 
field. In fact, the discussion is livelier if your visitors can discuss concerns 
about your area of business in general, whether it’s flower arranging, boat 
sales, tax preparation, clock repair, computers, or whatever.

141
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
How do you start a discussion area? The basic first step is to install a special 
computer script on the computer that hosts your website. (Again, discussing 
this prospect with your web hosting service beforehand is essential.) When 
visitors come to your site, their web browsers access the script, enabling 
them to enter comments and read other messages.
Here are some specific ways to prepare a discussion area for your site:
	
✓	Copy a bulletin board or discussion-group script from either of these 
sites:
 
• eXtropia.com (www.extropia.com/applications.html)
 
• Matt’s Script Archive (www.scriptarchive.com)
	
✓	Start your own forum on a service such as vBulletin (www.vbulletin.
com), which is used by the aforementioned EcommerceBytes.
Moving from Website to Web Presence
After you have established a visual identity through colors, images, and a 
logo, you can “brand” yourself by “popping up” in as many web venues as 
possible. Make no mistake about it: Tending to your image and building a 
name for yourself takes time and effort. It might take one, two, or more hours 
every day. And once you start blogging and building an audience, you need 
to keep at it every few days, if not every day. Otherwise, those fickle web visi­
tors you worked so hard to cultivate will flit away to someone else’s website 
or blog or Facebook page.
How do you “pop up” in places where people will find you? You’ll find sugges­
tions throughout this book. Here are a few ideas:
	
✓	Start up a blog and use it to comment on your area of interest. (See 
Chapters 1 and 13.)
	
✓	Twitter as much as possible; short “tweets” can advertise new products 
or sales you have running. (Again, see Chapter 13.)
	
✓	Get on Facebook and start cultivating a circle of friends. Use Facebook 
to point them to your website — and your blog, your tweets, and so on. 
(You guessed it — see Chapter 13.)
	
✓	Open a storefront on eBay or on a free site like eCRATER (www.
ecrater.com). (See Chapters 5 and 14 for more.)

142
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
The art of having a web presence is using all these sites to point to one 
another, so no matter where you are, shoppers are directed to your products 
or services, or at least prompted to find out more about you.
Extreme Web Pages: Advanced Layouts
People with some experience creating websites typically use tables for 
layout. They might be right up the alley of an adventurous type who wants to 
start an online business.
Setting the tables for your customers
Tables are to designers what statistics are to sports fans. They provide 
another means to present information in a graphically interesting way. Tables 
were originally intended to present “tabular” data in columns and rows, 
much like a spreadsheet. But by using advanced HTML techniques, you can 
make tables a much more integrated and subtle part of your web page.
Because you can easily create a basic table using web page editors, such as 
Dreamweaver, GoLive, and Expression Web, starting with one of these tools 
makes sense. Some adjustments with HTML are probably unavoidable, how­
ever, especially if you want to use tables to create blank columns on a web 
page (as I explain later in this section). Here is a quick rundown of the main 
HTML tags used for tables:
	
✓	<table> </table> encloses the entire table. The border attribute 
sets the width of the line around the cells.
	
✓	<tr> </tr> encloses a table row, a horizontal set of cells.
	
✓	<td> </td> defines the contents of an individual cell. The height and 
width attributes control the size of each cell. For example, the following 
code tells a browser that the table cell is 120 pixels wide:
<td width=120> Contents of cell </td>
	
Cells in a table can contain images as well as text. Also, individual cells can have 
different colors from the cells around them. You can add a background color to 
a table cell by adding the bgcolor attribute to the <td> table cell tag.

143
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
The clever designer can use tables in a hidden way to arrange an entire page, 
or a large portion of a page, by doing two things:
	
✓	Set the table border to 0. Doing so makes the table outline invisible, so 
the viewer sees only the contents of each cell, not the lines bordering 
the cell.
	
✓	Fill some table cells with blank space. They act as empty columns that 
add more white space to a page.
A quick HTML primer
Thanks to web page–creation tools, you don’t 
have to master HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML) to create your own web pages although 
some knowledge of HTML is helpful when it 
comes to editing pages and understanding how 
they’re put together.
HTML is a markup language, not a computer 
programming language. You use it in much the 
same way that old-fashioned editors marked 
up copy before they gave it to typesetters. A 
markup language allows you to identify major 
sections of a document, such as body text, 
headings, and title. A software program (in the 
case of HTML, a web browser) is programmed 
to recognize the markup language and to dis­
play the formatting elements that you have 
marked.
Markup tags are the basic building blocks of 
HTML as well as eXtensible Markup Language 
(XML). Tags enable you to structure the appear­
ance of your document so that, when it is trans­
ferred from one computer to another, it looks 
the way you described it. HTML tags appear 
within caret-shaped brackets. Most HTML 
commands require a start tag at the beginning 
of the section and an end tag (which usually 
begins with a backslash) at the end.
For example, if you place the HTML tags <b> 
and </b> around the phrase “This text will be 
bold,” the words appear in bold type on any 
browser that displays them, whether it’s run­
ning on a Windows-based PC, a Unix worksta­
tion, a Mac, a palm device that’s web-enabled, 
or any other computer.
Many HTML commands are accompanied by 
attributes, which provide a browser with more 
specific instructions on what action the tag is to 
perform. In the following line of HTML, src is 
an attribute that works with the <img> tag to 
identify a file to display:
<img src=“house.jpg”>
Each attribute is separated from an HTML com­
mand by a single blank space. The equal sign 
(=) is an operator that introduces the value on 
which the attribute and command functions. 
Usually, the value is a filename or a directory 
path leading to a specific file that is to be dis­
played on a web page. The straight (as opposed 
to curly) quotation marks around the value are 
essential for the HTML command to work.

144
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
An example of the first approach, that of making the table borders invisible, 
appears in Figure 5-14: my friend Scott Wills’s website, where he advertises 
his graphic design services. The page appears to be divided into three col­
umns, but the “columns” are cells in a table with borders that aren’t visible.
	
Figure 5-14: 
This page is 
divided into 
table cells, 
which give 
the designer 
a high level 
of control 
over the 
layout.
	
Breaking the grid with layers
Tables and another set of virtually obsolete layout tools called frames bring 
organization and interactivity to web pages, but they confine your content to 
rows and columns. If you feel confined by the old up-down, left-right routine, 
explore layers for arranging your web page content.
Layers, like table cells and frames, act as containers for text and images on 
a web page. Layers are unique because they can be moved around freely 
on the page — they can overlap one another and “bleed” right to the page 
margin.
	
Layers carry some big downsides: You can’t create them with just any web 
editor. I recommend Microsoft Expression Web because it lets you create 
layers using cascading style sheets (CSS) commands so they display accu­
rately by almost all browsers. See the product’s website (www.microsoft.
com/products/expression/en/web_designer/default.mspx) to find 
out more about current availability and pricing.

145
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Business Presence and Attracting Customers
With either Dreamweaver or Expression Web, you can draw a layer directly 
on the web page you’re creating. You add text or images to the layer, and 
then resize or relocate it on the page by clicking and dragging it freely. The 
result is an innovative page design that doesn’t conform to the usual grid.
Achieving consistency with 
Cascading Style Sheets
Cascading style sheets (CSS) are the tools of choice among designers who 
want to observe standards that have been established on the Internet and 
who want to make sure their web pages appear the same from browser to 
browser and from one computer to another. If you have a choice on how to 
lay out a page, and you want to precisely position items while creating 
layouts that are easily updatable, I urge you to look into CSS.
CSS is a subject for a book all by itself, so I’m not going to get into any great 
detail here. Suffice it to say that if you want to create full-featured, cutting-
edge layouts, you need to use CSS. The major web design programs — 
Dreamweaver, GoLive, and Expression Web — all support CSS designs. 
When in doubt, hire a pro
Part of the fun of running your own business is 
doing things yourself. Most of the ontrepreneurs 
I interviewed in the course of writing this book 
do their own web page design work. They 
discovered how to create websites by reading 
books or taking classes on the subject. But in 
many cases, the initial cost of hiring someone to 
help design your online business can be a good 
investment. After you pay someone to help you 
develop a look, you can probably implement it 
in the future more easily yourself. For example:
	✓	If you need business cards, stationery, 
brochures, or other printed material in 
addition to a website, hiring someone to 
develop a consistent look for everything at 
the beginning is worth the money.
	✓	You can pay a designer to get you started 
with a logo, color selections, and page 
layouts. Then you can save money by 
adding text yourself.
	✓	If, like me, you’re artistically impaired, 
consider the benefits of having your logo or 
other artwork drawn by a real artist.
Most professional designers charge $40 to 
$60 per hour for their work. You can expect a 
designer to spend five or six hours creating a 
logo or template, but if your company uses that 
initial design for the foreseeable future, you’re 
not really paying that much per year.

146
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Rather than learn CSS from scratch, choose one of these applications and let 
it do the work for you.
Standards like CSS and XML are important because they enable you to reach 
the widest set of viewers possible. A style sheet is a document that contains 
the formatting for a web page. By separating the formatting from the content, 
you quickly apply the same formatting to multiple web pages. You can also 
update the design of an entire website easily: Rather than change a heading 
from Arial to Verdana 20 separate times on 20 web pages, for example, you 
change it once, and all the pages that have the style sheet attached to them 
have their headings updated all at once.

alk into any Walmart or other megastore, and you’re likely to feel 
overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place. Not to worry: Walmart 
makes life (and spending money) easier for its shoppers by having an employee 
greet you at the door, and by carefully arranging merchandise in aisles where 
you’ll find it easily. Online businesses work much the same; in fact, shoppers 
want to move even more quickly and easily through an online store than a 
brick-and-mortar one. Your job is to make your sales items easy to find and 
purchase, and to make customers feel secure so that you’re paid promptly 
and reliably. You also need to protect yourself financially and guard your 
business data. In this chapter, I discuss some technologies and strategies 
that can keep your data secure and make your customers feel at ease, too.
Fostering a good atmosphere for e-commerce is also a matter of presenting 
your merchandise clearly and making it easy for customers to choose and 
purchase them. Making changes to your website is relatively easy. You can 
remake your store’s front door (your home page) in a matter of minutes. 
You can revamp your sales catalog in less than an hour. Making regular 
improvements and updates to your online store doesn’t just mean changing 
the colors or the layout, which is the part of your operation that customers 
notice, on your website. It also means improving back-office functions that 
customers don’t see, such as inventory management, invoices, labels, packing, 
and shipping. When you test, check, and revise your website based on its 
current performance, you can boost your revenue and increase sales as well 
as make your website more usable.

Here’s a short list of what you need to do to be a successful e-commerce 
businessperson: Set up the right atmosphere for making purchases, provide 
options for payment, and keep sensitive information private. Oh, and don’t 
forget your main goal is to get goods to the customer safely and on time. In this 
chapter, I describe ways in which you can implement these essential online 
business strategies to ensure a positive shopping experience for your customers.
Giving Online Shoppers What They Need
You’ve heard it before, but I can’t emphasize enough the importance of 
understanding the needs of online shoppers and doing your best to meet them. 
That’s the best way to end up with a healthy balance in your bank account.
Showing what you’ve got
Customers may end up buying an item in a brick-and-mortar store, but chances 
are that they saw it online first. Shoppers now routinely assume that legitimate 
stores have a website and an online sales catalog that is likely to include even 
more items, accompanied by detailed descriptions, than a shopper would 
find by going to the store in person.
“It’s not enough to just say we have this or that product line for sale. Until we 
actually add an individual item to our online store, with pictures and prices, 
we won’t sell it,” says Ernie Preston, who helped create an 84,000-item online 
catalog for a brick-and-mortar tool company that I profiled a few years ago for 
a previous edition of this book. “As soon as you put it in your online catalog, 
you’ll get a call about it. Shopping on the web is the convenience factor that 
people want.”
Suppose you don’t have an 84,000-item catalog. Instead, you have only 20–30 
items and you’re just starting out. What can you do to build trust and encourage 
shoppers? Observe three basic rules:
	
✓	Make your sales catalog organized so items are easy to find.
	
✓	Talk about yourself and your background.
	
✓	Provide lots of details and good photos.
Here’s an example. Nanette Thorell sells egg art (eggshells she has turned 
into jewelry and other products) on her website, Enchanted Hen Productions 
(www.enchantedhen.com). She follows the example of “triangulation” that 
I describe in this book’s introduction by selling on eBay, Etsy, and ArtFire,

 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
as well as marketing herself with a blog, a newsletter, and on Facebook and 
Twitter. As you can see from her home page (see Figure 6-1), her links are 
simple and clearly organized.
Earning trust to gain a sale
Although e-commerce is more and more common, many customers who 
are relatively new still need to have their fears addressed. They want to be 
sure that providing their names, phone numbers, and credit card informa­
tion won’t lead to identity theft. And shoppers who are old pros at shopping 
online want to avoid being flooded with unwanted e-mails. In regard to the 
sale at hand, many fear that they will pay for merchandise but not receive it.
State your policies clearly and often, providing assurance that you don’t give 
out personal data without consent. If you plan to accept credit card orders, 
get an account with a web host that provides a secure server, which is soft­
ware that encrypts data exchanged with a browser. And be sure to include 
comments from satisfied customers. If you run an eBay Store or a store on 
another marketplace such as Bonanza (www.bonanza.com), your feedback 
rating provides assurance.

If you’re a member in good standing with the Better Business Bureau (www.
bbb.org), you may be eligible to apply for the BBB Business Seal for the 
Web (www.bbb.org/us/bbb-online-business) to build credibility and 
confidence among your clients. Businesses that participate in the BBBOnline 
program show their commitment to their customers by displaying a 
BBBOnline Reliability Seal or Privacy Seal on their websites.
One of the best ways to build trust in you and your products is to tell visi­
tors about yourself and your background and experience. Figure 6-2 shows 
Nanette Thorell’s About Me page.

Pointing the way with links and graphics
Because most customers are comparison shopping, it’s wise to put the cost, 
measurements, and other important features right next to each item to 
promote speed and convenience.

 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
	
Microsoft Office gives you access to clip art images that help highlight sales 
items. Figure 6-3 shows an example of how you can edit an HTML web page file 
with Word by inserting an image from the Clip Art task pane. (You can find 
more clip art images at the Microsoft Office Clip Art and Media Center, 
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/images.)
You can also direct shoppers through your site by providing plenty of links 
from one section to another. Even when they’re exploring one section, you 
should provide links back to the home page or to other areas of your site. 
In the case of Enchanted Hen Productions (refer to Figure 6-1), if you click 
Jewelry, you go to a category page with two links: Earrings and Necklaces. 
Click Earrings, and you see the section opening page shown in Figure 6-4. 
Even as shoppers are exploring the earrings section of the catalog, clicking 
a link guides them back to the necklaces section if they wish.

Giving the essentials
One of the big advantages of operating a business online is space. Not only 
do you have plenty of room in which to provide full descriptions of your sale 
items, but you also have no reason to skimp on the details you provide about 
your business and services. Here are some suggestions on how to provide 
information that your customer may want:
	
✓	If you sell clothing, include a page with size and measurement charts.
	
✓	If you sell food, provide weights, ingredients, and nutritional information.
	
✓	If you sell programming, web design, or traditional graphic design, 
provide samples of your work, links to web pages you’ve created, and 
testimonials from satisfied clients.
	
✓	If you’re a musician, publish a link to a short sound file of your work.
Don’t be reluctant to tell people ways that your products and services are 
better than others. Visit the Lands’ End online catalog (www.landsend.com) 
for good examples of how this well-established marketer describes the 
quality of its wares.

153
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
The more details you provide about items, the longer someone will stay on 
your site, and the more likely they’ll click Add to Cart or Buy. In your descrip­
tion, try to engage shoppers’ imaginations. In Figure 6-5, Nanette Thorell 
provides a list with specifications, a clear photo, an easy-to-find price, and 
this phrase: “. . . they [the earrings] will turn and sway as you move your 
head.” The shopper imagines the earrings on her head, which encourages her 
impulse to purchase.

Managing Goods and Services
Shoppers on the web are continually in search of The New: the next new 
product, the latest price reduction or rebate, the latest comment in a blog, or 
today’s headlines. As a provider of content, whether it’s in the form of words, 
images, or products for sale, your job is to manage that content to keep it 
fresh and available. You also need to replenish stock when it’s purchased, 
handle returns, and deal with shipping options, as I describe in the sections 
that follow.

154
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Handling returns
Your returns policy depends on the venue where you make your sales. If you 
sell primarily on eBay or another marketplace, you should accept returns, if 
only because many of the most experienced and successful sellers do. That 
doesn’t mean you need to accept every single item that is returned. Most 
businesses place restrictions on when they’ll receive a return and send a 
refund. The items must be returned within 14 days, for example; the pack­
ages must be unopened; the merchandise must not be damaged.
Adding shipping rates
These days, when shoppers think about shipping rates, they think about a 
four-letter word: F-R-E-E. Amazon.com, with its free shipping options, has made 
sellers expect it as a choice. As a result, sellers on marketplaces like eBay are 
told to offer free shipping if possible (see www.internetretailer.com/
mobile/2011/03/31/ebay-bets-free-shipping). Even if sellers build a 
$10 shipping cost into a $50 item so the buyer pays $60 with “free shipping,” 
customers are still more likely to buy under such circumstances — or so the 
conventional wisdom says.
Otherwise, as part of creating a usable e-commerce catalog, you need to pro­
vide customers with shipping costs for your merchandise. Shipping rates can 
be difficult to calculate. They depend on your geographic location as well as 
the location where you’re planning to ship. If you’re a small-scale operation 
and you process each transaction manually, you may want to ship everything 
a standard way (UPS Ground, FedEx Home Delivery, or the U.S. Postal Service 
Parcel Post). Then you can keep a copy of your shipper’s charges and calculate 
each package’s shipping cost individually.
You can also save time by using the quick shipping calculator provided by 
iShip (https://iship.com). Just go to the site’s home page, enter the 
origin and destination zip codes, and click Go. You get a set of shipping 
rates from DHL, UPS, and the U.S. Postal Service so you can pick the most 
cost-effective option. If you want help with shipping, you can set up your 
site with the help of a transaction hosting service, such as ChannelAdvisor 
(www.channeladvisor.com). This company has an agreement with the 
U.S. Postal Service so that it automatically calculates shipping charges and 
includes those charges in the invoices it sends to your customers.
	
If you sell the same type of item all the time, such as a particular type of cloth­
ing, you can provide flat-rate shipping using a method such as the U.S. Postal 
Service’s Priority Mail option. You can even add a few dollars to the purchase 
price to cover the standard shipping charge to most locations in the United 
States and offer free shipping to your domestic customers.

155
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
Maintaining inventory
Shoppers on the web want things to happen instantly. If they discover that 
you’re out of stock of an item they want, they’re likely to switch to another 
online business instead of waiting for you to restock that item. With that in 
mind, obey the basic principle of planning to be successful: Instead of order­
ing the bare minimum of this or that item, make sure you have enough to 
spare. Too much inventory initially is better than running out at some point.
If you have one store with 50–100 items in stock, managing inventory is 
straightforward. If you manage 13 separate storefronts as well as a brick-and-
mortar store, you’d better call in some outside help to keep on top of it all.
Mimi and Peter Kriele operate the website Touch of Europe (www.touchof
europe.net) as an Amazon web store, as well as 12 other specialized sites. 
The Krieles use Miva Merchant to manage their main website. The inventory 
for all the other stores is taken from Amazon.com and managed using that 
marketplace’s tools for merchants. These are just two approaches. See 
Chapter 16 for more on different ways to manage multiple storefronts.
Rely on software or management services to help you keep track of what you 
have. If you feel at ease working with databases, record your initial inven­
tory in an Access or SQL database. A database forces you to record each sale 
manually so you know how many items are left. You could connect your sales 
catalog to your database using a program such as ColdFusion from Adobe 
(www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion). Such a program can update the 
database on the www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html 
when sales are made. But you may need to hire someone with web program­
ming experience to set up the system for you and make sure it actually works.
If you sign up with an online store solution, like Yahoo! Small Business or a 
sales management provider like Marketplace Advisor Selling Services from 
ChannelAdvisor (www.channeladvisor.com), inventory is tracked auto­
matically for you. Whether you do the work yourself or hire an outside service, 
you have to be able to answer basic questions such as these:
	
✓	When should you reorder? Establish reorder points — points at which 
you automatically reorder supplies (when you get down to two or three 
items left, for example).
	
✓	How many items do you have in stock right now? Make sure that you 
have enough merchandise on hand not only for everyday demand but 
also in case a product gets hot or the holiday season brings about a 
dramatic increase in orders.

156
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
An e-commerce hosting service can also help you with questions that go 
beyond the basics, such as the purchasing history of customers. Knowing 
what customers have purchased in the past gives you the ability to suggest 
up-sells — additional items customers might want. But in the early stages, 
making sure you have a cushion of additional inventory for the time when 
your site becomes a big success is your primary responsibility.
Keeping Your Website in Top Shape
The job of your hosting service or ISP, of course, is to monitor traffic and 
make sure your website is up and running. But unless you keep an eye on 
your site and its availability to your customers, you may not be aware of 
technical problems that can scare potential business away. If your site is 
offline periodically or your server crashes or works slowly, it doesn’t just 
waste your customers’ time — it can cut into your sales directly.
	
If your site doesn’t work well, a potential customer can find another site 
whose pages load more quickly just a few mouse clicks away. Outages can 
be costly, too. The business and technology website Business Insider (www.
businessinsider.com) reported that an outage that hit the popular online 
payment service PayPal in summer 2009 cost businesses between $7 and 
$32 million. The site was offline for about 4.5 hours. In September 2010, the 
Virgin Blue airline check-in and online reservations and boarding system went 
down. The company estimated that the 11-day outage cost it $20 million in 
profits, which its reservations management company, Navitaire, subsequently 
paid in compensation (http://m.theaustralian.com.au/business/
navitaire-booking-glitch-earns-virgin-20m-in-compo/story-
e6frg8zx-1226033624246).
Using software to keep score
Although they take some effort to install, programs are available for between 
$30 – $200 that continually keep an eye on your website and notify you of any 
problems. Site24x7 (www.site24x7.com) monitors your website’s availabil­
ity from more than 40 locations around the world. You can try the service for 
a free 15-day trial period. Three pricing plans are available.
	
Some companies offer such monitoring as a service. You use the company’s 
software, which resides on its computers, not yours. For example, @Watch 
(www.atwatch.com) provides an online service that checks your site’s 
images and links periodically to see if everything is working correctly. The 
company offers several levels of service. The @Watch Advanced version costs 
$12.99 per month and checks your site once every 30 minutes. For $33.99 per 
month, the program will check your site every 5 minutes.

157
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
Coping when your service 
goes out to lunch
Ideally, your web host provides a page on its website that keeps track of its net­
work status and records any recent problems. One site monitoring notification 
(from a program you install yourself or one that you “rent” as a service from an 
Application Service Provider [ASP] — see the next section, “Outsourcing your 
business needs”) probably isn’t cause for concern. However, when you receive 
a series of notifications, call your web-hosting service and tell technical support 
exactly what the problems are/were.
If the problem with your site is a slow response to requests from web browsers 
rather than a complete outage, the problem may be that your server is slow 
because you’re sharing it with other websites. Consider moving from shared 
hosting to a different option. In co-location, you purchase the server on which 
your files reside, but the machine is located at your web host’s facility rather 
than at your own location. Your site is the only one on your machine. You 
also get the reliability of the host’s technical support and high-speed Internet 
connection.
If you really need bandwidth, consider a dedicated server. In this case, you rent 
space on a machine that is dedicated to serving your site. This arrangement 
is far more expensive than sharing a web server, and you should choose it 
only if the number of visits to your site at any one time becomes too great 
for a shared server to handle. You’ll know a shared server is becoming over­
taxed if your site is slow to load.
Outsourcing your business needs
One of the most effective ways to save time and money doing business online 
is to let someone else install and maintain the computer software that you 
use. Outsourcing refers to the practice of having an outside company provide 
services for your business, such as web hosting, form creation, or financial 
record keeping, rather than installing software and running it on your own 
computer.
One of the companies that provides web-based services on an outsourced 
basis is an Application Service Provider (ASP). An ASP makes business or other 
applications available on the web. For example, when you fill out a form and 
create a web page on CafePress.com (which I describe in Chapter 15), you’re 
using CafePress.com as an ASP. Rather than create your web page on your 
own computer, you use an application on the CafePress.com site and store 
your web page information there.

158
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
How ASPs can help your company
You have to pay a monthly fee to use an ASP’s services. You may also incur 
installation fees, and you may have to sign a one- or two-year contract. In 
return, ASPs provide benefits to your company that include the following:
	
✓	Shopping cart/store creation: In addition to a website, open an e-commerce 
store with shopping cart services like ZenCart, 3D Cart, X-Cart, or one of 
many other providers.
	
✓	“Shark tank” feedback: Concept Feedback (www.conceptfeedback.
com) provides experts who evaluate your website’s design and usability 
and suggest improvements.
	
✓	Online form creation: FormSite.com (www.formsite.com) is a leader 
in creating a variety of forms that can help online shoppers provide 
essential functions, such as subscribing to newsletters or other publica­
tions, asking for information about your goods and services, or providing 
you with shipping or billing information. The sample pizza order form 
shown in Figure 6-6 is an example of the type of form that this particular 
ASP can help you create.

✓	Product presentation: Arqspin (http://arqspin.com) lets you create 
360-degree “spinning” product photography so customers can see your 
merchandise from all angles.
	
✓	Reduced credit card fees: All merchants pay fees to credit card processors 
to receive customers’ credit card payments. FeeFighters (https://
feefighters.com) helps businesses shop for credit card merchant 
accounts to save money.
Although ASPs can help you in many ways, they require research, interviewing, 
contract review, and an ongoing commitment on your part. I illustrate the 
potential pluses and minuses of outsourcing in Table 6-1.
Table 6-1	
Outsourcing Benefits and Risks
Pros
Cons
Better customer service: By outsourcing 
scheduling or other functions, businesses 
give customers increased options for 
interacting with them online. Customers 
don’t have to call or e-mail the company; 
in the case of online scheduling, cus­
tomers can schedule or cancel appoint­
ments by accessing the company’s 
online calendar.
A required contract: ASPs usually 
allow customers to try out their ser­
vices for a while but then offer long-
term contracts. The terms of these 
contracts can range from one to three 
years. Don’t get yourself locked in to a 
long-term arrangement that prevents 
you from trying out cheaper or better 
alternatives down the road.
Greater website functionality: ASPs 
enable your site to provide better ser­
vice to your customers and allow you 
to get more work done.
ASPs face stiff competition: Make sure 
the companies you sign agreements 
with will be around for a while by talk­
ing to current customers and reviewing 
resumes of senior staff and key employ­
ees. Scan the web for any press releases 
or articles that serve as warning signs 
about the ASP’s financial health.
Expanded scope: You don’t have to 
become proficient in subjects that aren’t 
part of your core business or expertise.
Security risks: The moment you hand 
over your business data to another 
online firm or give outside companies 
access to your internal network, you 
risk theft of data or virus infections 
from hackers. Make sure the ASPs you 
work with use encryption and other 
Internet security measures.

160
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
In many cases, ASPs can provide a software solution and customize it to your 
needs. Outsourcing not only improves your company’s bottom line, but also 
helps you convey your message to potential customers that you might never 
reach otherwise.
Doing your homework before you sign up
After you try out the software or other service that you want to lease, you 
usually need to sign a contract. Read the fine print. Contracts can last for 12 
to 50 months; make sure you don’t get locked in to one that’s longer than you 
need. You have a better chance of getting the service you want if you do the 
following:
	
✓	Understand pricing schemes. Some ASPs charge on a “per-employee” 
basis while others charge “per-seat” fees based on each registered user. 
Still others charge “per CPU,” which means you’re charged for each 
machine that runs the hosted application.
	
✓	Pin down start-up fees. Virtually all ASPs charge a start-up fee, or a 
service implementation fee, when you sign the contract. Make sure the 
fee covers installation and any customization that you’ll need.
	
✓	Don’t accept just any SLA. It’s essential to obtain a service level agreement 
(SLA), which is a document that spells out what services you expect 
an ASP (or other vendor) to provide. Don’t hesitate to add, delete, or 
change sections to meet your needs.
	
✓	Avoid “gotcha” fees. Pricing arrangements are hardly standard with 
regard to ASPs. Some of the big hidden costs involve personalizing or 
customizing the service to adapt to legacy systems. You should ask these 
questions in order to avoid unpleasant surprises: Is there an additional 
cost for customizing or personalizing the application? Does it cost extra 
to back up my company’s data and recover it if one of my computers 
goes down? Is help desk support included in my monthly fee, or will you 
charge me every time I call with a question or problem?
	
✓	Make sure your information is secure. Some huge security risks are 
associated with transmitting your information across the wide-open spaces 
of the Internet. Make sure your ASP takes adequate security measures 
to protect your data by asking informed questions, such as: Is my data 
protected by SSL encryption? Do you run a virtual private network? How 
often do you back up your customers’ data?
If the answer to any of these questions seems inadequate, move on to the 
next ASP.

Keeping Your Business Safe
Working at home or in a small office carries its own set of safety concerns 
for small business owners. Chances are you don’t have an IT professional at 
hand to make sure your files and your network are safe from intrusion. Some 
safe computing practices, such as using password protection, making regular 
back-ups, and installing antivirus software, can go a long way toward keeping 
your data secure, even if you never have to get into more technical subjects 
such as public key encryption.
Separating the personal 
and the professional
Many entrepreneurs who run businesses from their homes face a simple 
logistical problem: Their work takes over their home. Boxes, computers, 
phones, and other gadgets create disruptions that can drive everyone crazy. 
Here are some simple steps that can help you set more clearly defined 
boundaries between work and domestic life.
When the computer is a group sport
A lot to can be said for having at least two separate computers — one for per­
sonal use and one for business use. The idea is that you set up your system 
so that you have to log on to your business computer with a username and 
password.
If you have only one computer, passwords can still provide a measure of pro­
tection. Windows gives you the ability to set up different user profiles, each 
associated with its own password. User profiles and passwords don’t neces­
sarily protect your business files, but they convey to your family members 
that they should use their own software, stick to their own directories, and 
not try to explore your company data.
	
Folder Guard, a program by WinAbility Software3 Corp. (www.winability.
com/folderguard), enables you to hide or password-protect files or folders 
on your computer. The software works with Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP or 
later. You can choose the Personal version, which is intended for home users, 
or the Business version, which is designed for business customers. A 30-day 
trial version is available for download from the WinAbility website; if you 
want to keep the Personal version of Folder Guard, you have to pay $39.95 (or 
$79.95 for the Business version).

162
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
One phone may not be enough
Having a phone line dedicated to your business not only makes your business 
seem more serious, but also separates your business calls from your personal 
calls. If you need a separate line for your online business, consider Google 
Voice (www.google.com/voice). This service gives you voicemail and a 
phone number that you can route to another phone if needed.
Heading off disasters
An old joke about the telegram from a mother reads, “Worry. Details to follow.” 
When you’re lying awake at night, you can be anxious about all sorts of grim 
disasters affecting your business: flood, fire, theft, computer virus, you name 
it. Prevention is always better than a cure, so this section covers steps you 
can take to prevent problems. But should a problem arise, there are also 
ways to recover more easily.
Insurance . . . the least you can do
I can think of ways to spend money that are a whole lot more fun than paying 
insurance premiums. Yet there I am every month, writing checks to protect 
myself in case something goes wrong with my house, car, body, and so on. And 
yes, there’s another item to add to the list: protecting my business investment 
by obtaining insurance that specifically covers me against hardware damage, 
theft, and loss of data. You can go a step further and obtain a policy that 
covers the cost of data entry or equipment rental that would be necessary to 
recover your business information. Here are some specific strategies:
	
✓	Make a list of all your hardware and software and how much each item 
cost, and store a copy of it in a secure place, such as a fireproof safe or 
safe-deposit box.
	
✓	Take photos of your computer setup in case you need to make an insur­
ance claim, and put them in the same safe place.
	
✓	Save your electronic files on CD or DVD and put the disc in a safe storage 
location, such as a safe-deposit box.
Investigate the many options available to you for insuring your computer 
hardware and software. Your current homeowner’s or renter’s insurance may 
offer coverage, but make sure the dollar amount is sufficient for replacement. 
You may also want to look into the computer hardware and software cover­
age provided by Safeware, The Insurance Agency, Inc. (www.safeware.com).
Think ahead to the unthinkable
The Gartner Group estimates that two out of five businesses that experience 
a major disaster go out of business within five years. I would guess that the 

163
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
three that are able to get back up and running quickly already had recovery 
plans in place. Even if your company is small, be prepared for trouble such as 
floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes. A recovery effort might include the follow­
ing strategies:
	
✓	Back-up power systems: What will you do if the power goes out, and you 
can’t access the web? You can buy a back-up power system for less than 
$50 at office supply stores or from Amazon.com.
	
✓	Data storage: This is probably the most practical and essential disaster 
recovery step for small or home-based businesses. Back up your files 
to the “cloud” using services like Carbonite (www.carbonite.com). 
An article in the IT magazine Computerworld compared five of the best-
known systems (www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223805/
5_online_backup_services_keep_your_data_safewww.computer
world.com/s/article/9223805/5_online_backup_services_
keep_your_data_safe).
	
✓	Telecommunications: Having an alternate method of communication 
available in case your phone system goes down ensures that you’re 
always in touch. The obvious choice is a cell phone. Also set up a voice 
mailbox so that customers and vendors can leave messages for you even 
if you can’t answer the phone.
Creating a plan is a waste of time if you don’t regularly set aside time to 
keep it up to date. Back up your data on a regular basis, purchase additional 
equipment if you need it, and make arrangements to use other computers 
and offices if you need to — in other words, implement your plan. You owe 
it not only to yourself, but also to your customers to be prepared in case of 
disaster.
Antivirus protection without a needle
As an online businessperson, you download files, receive disks from customers 
and vendors, and exchange e-mail with all sorts of people you’ve never met 
before. Surf safely by installing antivirus programs, such as
	
✓	Norton Internet Security by Symantec Corp. (www.symantec.com/
global/products): This application, which includes an antivirus pro­
gram as well as a firewall and lists for $79.99, automates many security 
functions and is especially good for beginners. A standalone version, 
Norton AntiVirus, is available for $49.99, but I highly recommend the 
more full-featured package, which includes a firewall that blocks many 
other dangerous types of intrusions, such as Trojan horses.
	
✓	AVG AntiVirus by AVG Technologies (www.avg.com): Many users who 
find Norton Internet Security too intrusive (it leaves lots of files on your 
computer and consumes a great deal of memory) turn to this product, 
which lists for $39.99.

164

✓	Avira Free Antivirus (www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus): 
This is a popular free program.
	
✓	VirusScan by McAfee (www.mcafee.com): This is the leading competitor 
of Norton AntiVirus, which comes bundled with Norton Internet Security. 
VirusScan is included in McAfee Internet Security, which includes a 
firewall and costs $67.99.
	
I love gadgets, and few things get me more excited than handheld devices, 
laptops, and other portable computing devices. Yet those are the items that 
I seem to have the most trouble keeping track of, literally and figuratively. At 
the very least, you should make the device’s storage area accessible with a 
password. You can also install protection software designed especially for 
mobile devices, such as VirusScan Mobile by McAfee (www.mcafee.com/us/
products/mobile-security/index.aspx).
	
Viruses change all the time, and new ones appear regularly. The antivirus 
program you install one day may not be able to handle the viruses that appear 
just a few weeks or months later. You may want to pick an antivirus program 
that doesn’t charge excessive amounts for regular updates (such as every year). 
Also check the ICSA’s Product Testing Reports (go to www.icsalabs.com).
A visible sign that you’re trustworthy
Like the office assistant whose work is visible only when he or she is not 
doing a good job, you may be squeaky clean but nobody will know unless 
there’s a problem . . . or unless you display a “seal of approval” from a repu­
table online organization. The two best-known seals (which are actually 
images you add to your web pages to show visitors you’re reputable) are 
TRUSTe and BBBOnline.
The nonprofit organization TRUSTe was created to boost the degree of 
trust that web surfers have in the Internet. It does this through a third-party 
oversight “seal” program. If you demonstrate to TRUSTe that you’re making 
efforts to keep your visitors’ personal data secure and if you pledge not to 
share your customers’ data and to publish a privacy statement on your site, 
TRUSTe issues you a seal of approval that you can place on your site’s home 
page. The TRUSTe seal is intended to function as the online equivalent of the 
Good Housekeeping seal of approval on a product.
By itself, the seal doesn’t keep hackers from breaking into your site and 
stealing your data. That’s still up to you. Having the seal just makes visitors 
feel better about using your services. The TRUSTe site provides you with a 
wizard that leads you through the process of generating a privacy statement 
for your site. The statement tells visitors how you protect their information.

BBBOnline, the web-based arm of the Better Business Bureau, has a similar 
program for commercial websites. The BBBOnline Reliability Seal Program 
has several eligibility requirements, including a physical location in the 
United States or Canada, a business record for at least a year, a satisfactory 
complaint-handling record, membership in the Better Business Bureau, and 
a commitment to resolve disputes and respond promptly to consumer com­
plaints. Find out more at www.bbb.org.
Low- and high-tech locks
If you play the word game with a web surfer or 
website and say “Security,” you’re likely to get 
a response such as “Encryption.” But security 
doesn’t need to start with software. The fact 
is, all the firewalls and passwords in the world 
won’t help you if someone breaks into your 
home office and trashes or makes off with the 
computer that contains all your files.
Besides insuring your computer equipment 
and taking photos in case you need to replace 
it, you can invest in locks for your home office 
and your machines. They might not keep some­
one from breaking into your house, but they’ll at 
least make it more difficult for intruders to carry 
off your hardware.
Here are some suggestions for how to protect 
your hardware and the business data your com­
puters contain:
	✓	Lock your office. Everyone has locks on 
the outer doors of their house, but go a step 
further and install a deadbolt lock on your 
office door.
	✓	Lock your computers. Innovative Security 
Products (www.wesecure.com) offers 
several varieties of computer locking sys­
tems. It also sells ultraviolet pens that you 
can use to mark your equipment with your 
name and the serial number of your com­
puter in case the police recover it.
	✓	Get a security app. Software to recover a 
lost or stolen computer used to come in just 
a few varieties. Now, with the proliferation 
of easily lost smartphones and tablets, a 
new generation of apps is available. Install 
them before your device goes AWOL, and 
when the device is lost or stolen, the app 
will respond in different ways. Find My 
iPhone for iOS works with iPads as well 
as phones. If one iOS device goes missing, 
install Find My iPhone on another one and 
log in with your Apple ID to remotely erase 
the device, lock it, play a warning sound, or 
locate it. Lost for Android devices will per­
form similar functions. Absolute Computrace 
(www.absolute.com) will do the same 
with Computrace Plus (offered by Absolute 
Software Corp.), which costs home office 
users $49.95 for one year of monitoring.
	✓	Make back-ups. Be sure to regularly back 
up your information on Zip drives, USB 
drives, CDs, or similar storage devices. Also 
consider signing up with a web-based stor­
age service where files can be transferred 
from your computer. That way, if your com­
puters and your extra storage disks are lost, 
you have an online back-up in a secure 
location. Look into Norton Online Backup 
(www.symantec.com), which gives you 
25GB of storage space for $24.99.

Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Installing firewalls and other safeguards
You probably know how important a firewall is in a personal sense. Firewalls 
filter out unwanted intrusions, such as executable programs that hackers 
seek to plant on your file system, so they can use your computer for their 
own purposes. When you’re starting an online business, the objectives of a 
firewall become different: You’re protecting not just your own information, 
but also that of your customers. You’re quite possibly relying on the firewall 
to protect your source of income as well as the data on your computers.
	
A firewall is an application or hardware device that monitors the data flowing 
into or out of a computer network and filters that data based on criteria the 
owner sets up. Like a security guard at the entrance to an apartment building, 
a firewall scans the packets of digital information that traverse the Internet, 
making sure the data is headed for the right destination and that it doesn’t 
match known characteristics of viruses or attacks. Authorized traffic is allowed 
into your network. Attack attempts or viruses are either deleted automatically 
or cause an alert message to appear to which you must respond with a decision 
to block or allow the incoming or outgoing packets.
Keeping out Trojan horses and other unwanted visitors
A Trojan horse is a program that enters your computer surreptitiously and 
then attempts to do something without your knowledge. Some folks say 
that such programs enter your system through a “back door” because you 
don’t immediately know that they’ve entered your system. Trojan horses 
may come in the form of an e-mail attachment with the filename extension 
.exe (which stands for executable). For example, I once received an e-mail 
that purported to be from Microsoft Corp. and claimed to contain a security 
update. The attachment looked innocent enough, but had I saved the attach­
ment to my computer, it would have used my computer as a staging area for 
distributing itself to many other e-mail addresses.
I didn’t run into trouble, however. My firewall program recognized the attach­
ment and alerted me to the danger. I highly recommend that anyone who, like 
me, has a cable modem, DSL, or other direct connection to the Internet install 
one right away. You can try out the shareware program ZoneAlarm by Zone 
Labs, Inc. (www.zonealarm.com), that provides you with basic firewall protec­
tion, though more full-featured programs like Norton Internet Security (http://
us.norton.com/internet-security) are probably more effective.
Cleaning out spyware
Watch out for software that “spies” on your web surfing and other activities 
and then reports these activities to advertisers, potentially invading your pri­
vacy. Ad-Aware isn’t a firewall, exactly, but it’s a useful program that detects 

167
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
and erases any advertising programs you may have downloaded from the 
Internet without knowing it. Such advertising programs might be running on 
your computer, consuming your processing resources and slowing down oper­
ations. Some spyware programs track your activities when you surf the web; 
others simply report that they have been installed. Many users regard these 
spyware programs as invasions of privacy because they install themselves and 
do their reporting without your asking for it or even knowing they’re active.
When I ran Ad-Aware the first time, it detected a whopping 57 programs I 
didn’t know about that were running on my computer and that had installed 
themselves when I connected to various websites or downloaded software. 
As you can see in Figure 6-7, when I ran Ad-Aware while I was working on this 
chapter, sure enough, it found four suspicious software components running.
	
Figure 6-7: 
Ad-Aware

software 
that, many 
users 
believe, can

privacy.
	
I highly recommend Ad-Aware; you can download a version at www.lava
soft.com and try it for free. You can pay for their Personal or Pro Security 
versions as well. One of this book’s editors personally recommends a free anti-
spyware tool called SpyBot Search & Destroy (www.safer-networking.org).
Positioning the firewall
These days, most home networks are configured so that the computers on 
the network can share information as well as the same Internet connection. 
Whether you run a home-based business or a business in a discrete location, 
you almost certainly have a network of multiple computers. A network is far 
more vulnerable than a single computer connected to the Internet: A network 
has more entry points than a single computer, and more reliance is placed on 
each of the operators of those computers to observe good safety practices. 
And if one computer on the network is attacked, others can be attacked as well.

168
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
You probably are acquainted with software firewalls, such as Norton Personal 
Firewall or Zone Alarm. Software firewalls protect one computer at a time. 
In a typical business scenario, however, multiple computers share a single 
Internet connection through a router that functions as a gateway. Many net­
work administrators prefer a hardware firewall — a device that functions as 
a filter for traffic both entering and leaving it. A hardware firewall may also 
function as a router, but it can also be separate from the router. The device 
is positioned at the perimeter of the network where it can protect all the 
company’s computers at once. One example of this type of hardware is the 
WatchGuard Firebox X20e, which costs $572, by WatchGuard (www.watch
guard.com).
	
Companies that want to provide a website the public can visit as well as secure 
e-mail and other communications services create a secure sub-network of one 
or more specially hardened (in other words, secured because all unnecessary 
services have been removed from them) computers. This kind of network is a 
demilitarized zone (DMZ).
Keeping your firewall up to date
Firewalls work by means of attack signatures (or definitions), which are sets 
of data that identify a connection attempt as a potential attack. Some attacks 
are easy to stop: They’ve been attempted for years, and the amateur hackers 
who attempt intrusions don’t give much thought to them. The more dangerous 
attacks are new ones. These have signatures that emerged after you installed 
your firewall.
You quickly get a dose of reality and find just how serious the problem is by 
visiting one of the websites that keeps track of the latest attacks, such as the 
Distributed Intrusion Detection System or DShield (www.dshield.org). On 
the day I visited, DShield reported that the “survival time” for an unpatched 
computer (a computer that has security software that isn’t equipped with 
the latest updates called patches) after connecting to the Internet was only 
16 minutes. Therefore, such a computer only has 16 minutes before someone 
tries to attack it. If that doesn’t scare you into updating your security software, 
I don’t know what will.
Providing security with public keys
The conversations I overhear while I drive my preteen daughters and their 
friends to events leave no doubt in my mind that different segments of soci­
ety use code words that only their peers can understand. Even computers 
use encoding and decoding to protect information exchanged on the Internet. 
The schemes used online are far more complex and subtle than the slang 
used by kids, however. This section describes the security method most 
widely used on the Internet, and the one you’re likely to use yourself: Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.

169
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
The keys to public-key/private-key encryption
Terms like SSL and encryption might make you want to reach for the remote. 
But don’t be too quick to switch channels. SSL is making it safer to do busi­
ness online and boosting the trust of potential customers. And anything that 
makes shoppers more likely to spend money online is something you need to 
know about.
The term encryption is the process of encoding data, especially sensitive 
data, such as credit card numbers. Information is encrypted by means of 
complex mathematical formulas — algorithms. Such a formula may transform 
a simple-looking bit of information into a huge block of seemingly incompre­
hensible numbers, letters, and characters. Only someone who has the right 
formula, called a key (which is a complex mass of encoded data), can decode 
the gobbledygook.
Here’s a very simple example. Suppose that my credit card number is 12345, 
and I encode it by using an encryption formula into something like the following: 
1aFgHx203gX4gLu5cy.
The algorithm that generated this encrypted information may say something 
like “Take the first number, multiply it by some numeral, and then add some 
letters to it. Then take the second number, divide it by x, and add y charac­
ters to the result,” and so on. (In reality, the formulas are far more complex 
than this, which is why you usually have to pay a license fee to use them. But 
this is the general idea.) Someone who has the same formula can run it in 
reverse, so to speak, to decrypt the encoded number and obtain the original 
number, 12345.
In practice, the encoded numbers that are generated by encryption routines 
and transmitted on the Internet are very large. They vary in size depending 
on the relative strength (or uncrackability) of the security method used. Some 
methods generate keys that consist of 128 bits of data; a data bit is a single 
unit of digital information. These formulas are 128-bit keys.
Encryption is the cornerstone of security on the Internet. The most widely 
used security schemes, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, 
the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol, and Pretty Good Privacy 
(PGP), all use some form of encryption.
	
With some security methods, the party that sends the data and the party that 
receives it both use the same key (this method is symmetrical encryption). This 
approach isn’t considered as secure as an asymmetrical encryption method, 
such as public-key encryption, however. In public-key encryption, the originat­
ing party obtains a license to use a security method. (In the upcoming section, 
“Obtaining a certificate from Verisign,” I show you just how to do this your­
self.) As part of the license, you use the encryption algorithm to generate your 
own private key. You never share this key with anyone. However, you use the 
private key to create a separate public key. This public key goes out to visitors 
who connect to a secure area of your website. When they have your public 

170
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
key, users can encode sensitive information and send it back to you. Only you 
can decode the data — by using your secret, private key.
Getting a certificate without going to school
When you write a check at a retail store, the cashier is likely to make sure you’re 
preregistered as an approved member and also asks to see your driver’s 
license. But on the Internet, how do you know people are who they say they 
are when all you have to go on is a URL or an e-mail address? The solution in 
the online world is to obtain a personal certificate that you can send to web­
site visitors or append to your e-mail messages.
How certificates work
A certificate, which is also sometimes dubbed a Digital ID, is an electronic 
document issued by a certification authority (CA). The certificate contains 
the owner’s personal information as well as a public key that can be exchanged 
with others online. The public key is generated by the owner’s private key, 
which the owner obtains during the process of applying for the certificate.
In issuing the certificate, the CA takes responsibility for saying that the owner 
of the document is the same as the person actually identified on the certificate. 
Although the public key helps establish the owner’s identity, certificates do 
require you to put a level of trust in the agency that issues it.
A certificate helps both you and your customers. A certificate assures your 
customers that you’re the person you say you are, plus it protects your 
e-mail communications by enabling you to encrypt them.
Obtaining a certificate from VeriSign
Considering how important a role certificates play in online security, obtaining 
one is remarkably easy. You do so by applying and paying a licensing fee to 
a CA. One of the most popular CAs is VeriSign, Inc., now part of Symantec, 
which lets you apply for a certificate called a Class 1 Digital ID.
A Class 1 Digital ID is only useful for securing personal communications. As an 
e-commerce website owner, you may want a business-class certificate called a 
128-bit SSL Global Server ID (www.verisign.com/products-services/
index.html). This form of Digital ID works only if your e-commerce site is 
hosted on a server that runs secure server software — software that encrypts 
transactions — such as Apache Stronghold. Check with your web host to see 
whether a secure server is available for your website.
A VeriSign personal certificate, which you can use to authenticate yourself 
in e-mail, news, and other interactions on the Internet, costs $22.95 per year, 
and you can try out a free certificate for 60 days. Follow these steps to obtain 
your Digital ID:

171
 Chapter 6: Making Shopping Easy on Your E-Commerce Site
	
1.	Go to the VeriSign, Inc. Digital IDs for Secure E-Mail page at www.
symantec.com/verisign/digital-id.
	
2.	Click Buy Online.
	
	The Step 1: Certificate Data page appears.
	
3.	Type your e-mail address and choose a validity period (25 days or one 
year); then click Next.
	
	 If you pick the one-year option, you will be prompted to enter your billing 
information. Otherwise, the Confirmation page appears.
	
4.	Read the terms and conditions, click Yes to accept the terms, and then 
click Submit.
	
	 The Completion page appears with instructions on how to pick up your 
Digital ID.
	
5.	Check the e-mail address you entered in Step 3.
	
	 You’ll receive two e-mails. Click the link in the first one to go to the 
Verisign self-service page. Log in to the page with the password that was 
sent in the second e-mail.
	
6.	The Digital ID for Secure Email login page appears after you click the 
link in the first e-mail you received. Type the password you received 
and click Log in.
	
	 A page appears reviewing your request status for generating a key pair.
	
7.	Review the key information and then click Generate Key and Install.
	
	 Allow a few minutes for the key to generate. When your key is generated, 
you see the message Successfully generated the private key and 
installed the certificate to your key store at the top of the 
window.
	
8.	Click the Install Certificate button.
	
9.	When a dialog box appears saying the certificate has been installed, 
click OK.
	
10.	To view your certificate, in Microsoft Internet Explorer, choose 
Tools➪Internet Options, click Content, and then click Certificates.
	
	 The Certificate dialog box appears.
	
11.	Double-click the name of the certificate listed in the Personal tab.
	
	 The certificate appears. Figure 6-8 shows my certificate for Internet 
Explorer. (Copying this ID, or anyone else’s, is pointless because this is 
only your public key; the public key is always submitted with your private 
key, which is secret.)

Figure 6-8: 
A personal

assures 
individuals 
or websites 
of your 
identity.
	
After you have your Digital ID, what do you do with it? For one thing, you 
can use it to verify your identity to sites that accept certificate submissions. 
Some sites that require members to log in use secure servers that give you 
the option of submitting your certificate rather than entering the usual user­
name and password to identify yourself. You can also attach your Digital ID 
to your e-mail messages to prove that your message is indeed coming from 
you. See your e-mail program’s Help files for more specific instructions.
	
You can’t encrypt or digitally sign messages on any computer other than the 
one to which your certificates are issued. If you’re using a different computer 
from the one you used when you obtained your certificates, you must contact 
your certificate issuer and obtain a new certificate for the computer you’re 
currently using. Or, if your browser allows transfers, you can export your cer­
tificate to the new computer.
	
As far as e-mail security goes, rather than going through the cumbersome 
process of encrypting individual e-mail messages, the two best tips I can give 
you are very simple. First, use a secure password. A secure password con­
tains at least seven or eight characters and is a mix of capital and lowercase 
letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Second, if you use Gmail, enable 
two-factor authentication. You can Google the subject or read Google’s help 
instructions at http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.

S

tarting a new business and getting it online is exciting, but believe me, 
the real excitement occurs when you get paid for what you do. Nothing 
boosts your confidence and tells you that your hard work is paying off like 
receiving the proverbial check in the mail or having funds transferred to your 
business account.
The immediacy and interactivity of selling and promoting yourself online 
applies to receiving payments, too. You can get paid with just a few mouse 
clicks and some important data entered on your customer’s keyboard. But 
completing an electronic commerce (e-commerce for short) transaction 
doesn’t work the same way as in a traditional retail store. Online, customers 
can’t personally hand you cash or a check. You, the seller, can’t verify the 
user’s identity by looking at a signature or photo ID.
In e-commerce, both buyers and sellers have the same concerns they’ve 
always had. Customers need a reliable way to pay you securely without wor­
rying that their credit card information might be stolen. The seller needs to 
know that the customer isn’t using a stolen credit card. Luckily, online pay­
ments are safer than ever, and more options exist than ever before.
To get paid promptly and reliably online, you have to go through some extra 
steps to make the customer feel secure — not to mention protecting yourself, 
too. Successful e-commerce is about setting up the right atmosphere for 
making purchases, providing options for payment, and keeping sensitive 
information private. It’s also about making sure the goods get to the customer 
safely and on time. In this chapter, I describe how you can implement these 
essential online business strategies.

174
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Sealing the Deal: The Options
As anyone who sells online knows, the point at which payment is transferred 
is one of the most eagerly awaited stages of the transaction. It’s also one of 
the stages apt to produce the most anxiety. Customers and merchants who 
are used to dealing with one another face to face and personally handing 
over identification and credit cards suddenly feel lost. On the web, they can’t 
see the person they’re dealing with.
For customers, the good news is that paying for something purchased over 
the Internet is getting to be a matter-of-fact thing. Security has improved 
dramatically. For merchants like you, there are some basic concerns: You 
want to make sure that checks don’t bounce and purchases aren’t made with 
stolen credit cards.
In giving your customers the ability to make payments online, your goal is to 
accomplish the following:
	
✓	Give the customer options. Online shoppers like to feel that they have 
some degree of control. Give them a choice of payment alternatives: 
Phone, check, and credit cards are the main ones. Some also like a 
choice of online payment services; they want to see that you accept 
Google Checkout as well as PayPal, for example.
	
✓	Keep payments secure. Pay an extra fee to your web host, if necessary, to 
have your customers submit their credit card numbers or other personal 
information to a secure server — a server that uses Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) encryption to render personal data unreadable if stolen.
	
✓	Make payments convenient. Shoppers on the web are in a hurry. Give 
them the web page forms and the phone numbers they need so that they 
can complete a purchase in a matter of seconds.
Though the goals are the same, the options are different if you sell on eBay or 
on another website that functions as an e-commerce marketplace. If you sell 
on eBay, either through an auction or an eBay Store, you can take advantage 
of eBay’s fraud protection measures: a feedback system that rewards hon­
esty and penalizes dishonesty, fraud insurance, an investigations staff, and 
the threat of suspension. Of course, you might still run into buyers who try to 
cheat you. But the safeguards mean it’s feasible to accept cash and personal 
checks or money orders from buyers. If you don’t receive the cash, you don’t 
ship the merchandise. If you receive checks, you can wait until they clear 
before you ship.
On the web, you don’t have a feedback system or an investigations squad 
to ferret out dishonest buyers. You can accept checks or money orders, but 
credit cards are the safest and quickest option, and accordingly, they’re what 
buyers expect. It’s up to you to verify the buyer’s identity as best you can to 
minimize fraud.

175
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
Enabling Credit Card Purchases
Having the ability to accept and process credit card transactions makes it 
especially easy for your customers to follow the impulse to buy something 
from you. You stand to generate a lot more sales than you would otherwise.
But although credit cards are easy for shoppers to use, they make your life as 
an online merchant more complicated. You have two options:
	
✓	Let your customers pay with a credit card through an online payment 
service. This requires them to sign up with the same online payment 
service. But they gain protection from the payment service’s security 
methods.
	
✓	Sign up with your own merchant account. This lets you shop around 
and choose the service with the lowest fees or the best service. But you 
have to jump through some hoops to get such an account.
I don’t want to discourage you from becoming credit card–ready by any means, 
but you need to be aware of the steps (and the expenses) involved, many of 
which may not occur to you when you’re just starting out. For example, you 
may not be aware of one or more of the following:
	
✓	Merchant accounts: You have to apply and be approved for a special 
bank account called a merchant account for a bank to process the credit 
card orders that you receive. If you work through traditional banks, 
approval can take weeks. However, a number of online merchant 
account businesses are providing hot competition, which includes 
streamlining the application process.
	
✓	Fees: Fees can be high, but they vary widely, and it pays to shop around. 
Some banks charge a merchant application fee ($300–$800). On the 
other hand, some online companies, such as 1st American Card Service 
(www.1stamericancardservice.com), charge no application fee. But 
other fees do apply (see the next bullet point).
	
✓	Discount rates: All banks and merchant account companies (and even 
payment companies such as PayPal) charge a usage fee, deceptively 
called a discount rate. Typically, this fee ranges from 1 to 4 percent of 
each transaction. Plus, you may have to pay a monthly premium charge 
in the range of $30–$70 to the bank. Although 1st American Card Service 
saves you money with a free application, it charges Internet businesses 
a 2.19 percent fee that it calls a discount rate, plus 25 cents for each 
transaction, an $8 monthly statement fee, and a minimum charge of $15 
per month.
	
✓	American Express and Discover: If you want to accept payments from 
American Express and Discover cardholders, you must make arrange­
ments through the companies themselves. You can apply online to be 
an American Express card merchant by going to the American Express 

176
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Merchant Homepage (https://merchant.americanexpress.com/
accept-card/accepting-american-express-cards?inav=
merch_ga_acceptcards) and click Apply Now (or something similar) 
link. At the Discover Card Network merchant site (www.discover
network.com/merchants) click the Start Accepting link and find your 
existing “acquirer” or bank that you use for other credit cards, so you 
can expand your account with that bank to accept Discover.
	
✓	Software and hardware: Unless you depend on a payment service such 
as PayPal, you need software or hardware to process transactions and 
transmit the data to the banking system. If you plan to accept credit card 
numbers online only and don’t need a device to handle actual “card swipes” 
from in-person customers, you can use your computer modem to transmit 
the data. 1st American Card Service lets you use software dubbed Virtual 
WebLink for processing transactions with your browser, but you have 
to purchase the software for $39.95 and pay the usual discount rate and 
fees. This particular package includes a Virtual WebTerminal that lets you 
enter information manually and send it to the credit card network. Other 
systems require you to get a hardware terminal or phone line, which you 
can either purchase for $200 or more or lease for anywhere from $17 to 
$26 per month, depending on the length of the lease.

As we move farther into the web’s second decade, the payment landscape 
hasn’t changed dramatically. But things have shifted a bit. The changes 
actually give buyers and sellers more options:
	
✓	More and more people are paying bills online. This change has been 
taking place over several years and consumers are increasingly at ease 
with the process.
	
✓	PayPal is not the only game in town. This payment service is owned by 
eBay, but it can be used by anyone who wants to send or receive money 
online. PayPal is used by millions of auction sellers every month, but 
e-commerce store owners can use it, too.
	
✓	Google is gaining. Google Payments charges fees that are no lower than 
PayPal. Yet, shoppers and sellers alike flock to it. It provides an alterna­
tive to PayPal, which isn’t popular with many buyers and sellers.
	
✓	In-person payments are a square deal. Lots of sellers also sell at flea 
markets and art fairs. They can now accept face-to-face credit card pay­
ments thanks to a device that connects to a smartphone and processes 
the payment by connecting to a credit card service. The best-known of 

177
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
these services is called Square Register (https://squareup.com/). 
But other, similar options are springing up, such as LevelUp, Bank of 
America Mobile Pay on Demand, and PayPal Here.
	
✓	Overseas consumers are using new and innovative payment systems. 
At some point, if you accept payments from overseas, you might be 
asked to accept Western Union money transfers or other payment 
schemes. It’s the wave of the future as e-commerce becomes globalized.
The steps in the upcoming section, in which I explain how to create your own 
merchant account, are useful if you run a brick-and-mortar business that is 
tied to your online store. But if you don’t want to go through the trouble, you 
might consider a payment service such as PayPal or Google Payments.
	
Watch for credit card fraud — criminals using stolen numbers to make pur­
chases. You, the merchant, are liable for most of the fictitious transactions. 
Cardholders are responsible for only $50 of fraudulent purchases. To combat 
this crime, before completing any transaction, verify that the shipping address 
supplied by the purchaser is the same (or at least in the same vicinity) as the 
billing address. If you’re in doubt, you can phone the purchaser for verifica­
tion — it’s a courtesy to the customer as well as a means of protection for you. 
(See the upcoming section “Verifying credit card data.”) You can do this check 
yourself or pay a service to do it for you.
Setting up a merchant account
The good news is that getting merchant status is becoming easier for e-commerce 
enterprises because banks have accepted the notion that businesses don’t 
have to have a physical storefront to be successful. Getting a merchant account 
approved, however, still takes a long time, and some hefty fees are involved as 
well. Banks look more favorably on companies that have been in business for 
several years and have a proven track record.
Traditional banks are reliable and experienced, and most are likely to be 
around for a while. The new web-based companies that specialize in giving 
online businesses merchant account status welcome new businesses and 
give you wider options and cost savings, but they’re new; their services may 
not be as reliable and their future is less certain.
You can find a long list of institutions that provide merchant accounts for 
online businesses at one of the Yahoo! index pages:
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/
Financial_Services/Transaction_Clearing/Credit_
Card_Merchant_Services

178
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
The list is so long that knowing which company to choose is difficult. I rec­
ommend visiting Wells Fargo Bank (www.wellsfargo.com). which has been 
operating online for several years and is well established. The Wells Fargo 
website provides a good overview of what’s required to obtain a merchant 
account.
MyTexasMusic.com, the family-run business I profile in Chapter 2, uses a 
web-based merchant account company called GoEmerchant.com (www.
goemerchant.com) to set up and process its credit card transactions. (The 
site also accepts PayPal payments.) This company offers a shopping cart and 
credit card and debit card processing to businesses that accept payments 
online. MyTexasMusic.com chose to use GoEmerchant after an extensive search 
because it found that the company would help provide reliable processing, 
while also protecting the business from customers who purchased items 
fraudulently.
One advantage of using one of the payment options set up by PayPal Payments 
(www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant) is that the system (which 
originated with the well-known companies CyberCash and VeriSign) was well 
known and well regarded before PayPal acquired it. I describe the widely used 
electronic payment company in the section “Choosing an Online Payment 
System,” later in this chapter.
In general, your chances of obtaining merchant status are enhanced if you 
apply to a bank that welcomes Internet businesses, and if you can provide 
good business records proving that you’re a viable business that makes money.
	
Be sure to ask about the discount rate that the bank charges for Internet-based 
transactions before you apply. Compare the rate for online transactions to the 
rate for conventional “card-swipe” purchases. Most banks and credit card 
processing companies charge 1 to 2 extra percentage points for online sales.
	
Do you use an accounting program, such as QuickBooks or MYOB 
Accounting? The manufacturers of these programs enable their users to 
become credit card merchants through their websites.
Finding a secure server
A secure server uses some form of encryption, such as SSL (which I describe 
in Chapter 6), to protect data that you receive over the Internet. Customers 
know that they’ve entered a secure area when the security key or lock icon at 
the bottom of the browser window looks locked.
If you plan to receive credit card payments, you definitely want to find a web 
hosting service that can protect the area of your online business that serves 
as the online store. In literal terms, you need secure server software protecting 

179
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
the directory on your site that receives customer-sent forms. Some hosts 
charge a higher monthly fee for using a secure server; with others, the secure 
server is part of a basic business website account. Ask your host (or hosts 
you’re considering) whether any extra charges apply.
Verifying credit card data
Unfortunately, the world is full of bad people who try to use credit card numbers 
that don’t belong to them. The anonymity of the web and the ability to shop 
anywhere in the world, combined with the ability to place orders immediately, 
can facilitate fraudulent orders, just as it can benefit legitimate orders.
Protecting yourself against credit card fraud is essential. Always check the 
billing address against the shipping address. If the two addresses are thou­
sands of miles apart, contact the purchaser by phone to verify that the trans­
action is legit. Even if it is, the purchaser will appreciate your taking the time 
to verify the transaction.
	
You can use software to help check addresses. Here are three programs that 
perform this service:
	
✓	ClearCommerce (www.fisglobal.com/EMEA/UK/product-merchant
acquiring-clearcommerce): This company sells both an automated 
payment system and payment authentication software that work with 
credit cards and banks.
	
✓	PCCharge, VeriFone Payment Processing Software (www.verifone.
com/products/software/pc-payment-software/pccharge): This 
software enables individuals who use the VeriFone payment service to 
accept payments online as well. 
	
✓	Payment Software for Windows (www.firstdata.com/en_us/
products/merchants/support/payment-software-3.html): 
Formerly known as ICVERIFY, this software verifies the address of the 
person making an online purchase as a defense against fraud.
Processing the orders
When someone submits credit card information to you, you need to transfer 
the information to the banking system. Whether you make this transfer your­
self or hire another company to do it for you is up to you.
Do-it-yourself processing
To submit credit card information to your bank, you need point of sale (POS) 
hardware or software. The hardware, which you either purchase or lease 

180
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
from your bank, is a terminal — a gray box of the sort you see at many local 
retailers. The software is a program that contacts the bank through a modem.
The terminal or software is programmed to authorize the sale and transmit 
the data to the bank. The bank then credits your business or personal check­
ing account. The bank also deducts the discount rate from your account 
weekly, monthly, or with each transaction.
If you have a small-scale website — perhaps with only one item for sale — 
you can use an online payment gateway, which enables you to add a Pay 
button to a catalog page that securely processes a customer’s payment 
information. When you receive the information, you can manually submit it 
for payment by using a program such as First Data Global Gateway Connect 
(Virtual Terminal). The transaction is then processed on one of First Data’s 
secure servers. Both you and your customer receive e-mail notifications that 
the transaction is complete. You can find out more on the First Data website 
at www.aboutcsi.com/secure-transaction-processing.html.
Automatic processing
You can hire a company to automatically process credit card orders for you. 
These companies compare the shipping and billing addresses to help make 
sure that the purchaser is the person who actually owns the card and not 
someone trying to use a stolen credit card number. If everything checks out, 
the company transmits the data directly to the bank.
You can look into the different options provided by VeriFone, Inc. (www.
verifone.com), or AssureBuy (www.otginc.com) for such services.
	
Automatic credit card processing works so fast that your customer’s credit 
card can be charged immediately, whether or not you have an item in stock. 
If a customer receives a bill and is still waiting for an item that is on back 
order, he or she can get very unhappy. For this reason, some business owners 
choose not to use this type of service.
Choosing an Online Payment System
Some organizations have devised ways to make e-commerce secure and con­
venient for shoppers and merchants alike. These alternatives fall into one of 
three general categories:
	
✓	Organizations that help you complete credit card purchases (for example, 
VeriSign Payment Services).
	
✓	Escrow services that hold your money for you in an account until ship­
ment is received and then pay you, providing security for both you and 
your customers.

181
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
	
✓	Organizations that provide alternatives to transmitting sensitive infor­
mation from one computer to another. A number of attempts to create 
“virtual money” have failed. However, companies such as PayPal let 
customers make payments by directly debiting their checking accounts.
To use one of these systems, you or your web host sets up special software 
on the computer that actually stores your website files. This computer is 
where the transactions take place. The following sections provide general 
instructions on how to get started with setting up each of the most popular 
electronic payment systems.
	
To work smoothly, some electronic payment systems require you to set up 
programming languages such as Perl, C/C++, or Visual Basic on your site. You 
also have to work with techy documents called configuration files. This is defi­
nitely an area in which paying a consultant to get your business set up saves 
time and headaches. It also gets your new transaction feature online more 
efficiently than if you tackle it yourself. PayPal, for example, provides support 
in setting up systems for its merchants; you can find an affiliate to help you 
or call the company directly. Visit the PayPal Payments page (www.paypal.
com/webapps/mpp/merchant) for links and phone numbers.
Shopping cart software
When you go to the supermarket or another store, you pick goodies off the 
shelves and put them in a shopping cart. When you go to the cash register to 
pay for what you’ve selected, you empty the cart and present your goods to 
the cashier.
Shopping cart software performs the same functions on an e-commerce site. 
Such software sets up a system that allows online shoppers to select items 
displayed for sale. The selections are held in a virtual shopping cart that 
“remembers” what the shopper has selected before checking out.
Shopping cart programs are pretty technical for nonprogrammers to set up, 
but if you’re ambitious and want to try it, you can download and install a free 
program — Perlshop (www.waveridersystems.com/perlshop4/). Signing 
up with a web host that provides you with shopping cart software as part of 
its services, however, is far easier than tackling this task yourself.
	
A shopping cart is often described as an essential part of many e-commerce 
websites, and web hosts usually boast about including a cart along with their 
other businesses services. You don’t have to use a shopping cart on your 
site, though. Some shoppers are put off by them; they’re just as likely to aban­
don a purchase than follow through by submitting payment. Plenty of other 
e-businesses allow users to phone or fax in an order or fill out an online form 
instead.

182
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
PayPal payments
A good deal of this chapter is devoted to PayPal and its solutions for online 
buyers and sellers. PayPal is becoming a bigger player in the field of e-com­
merce. When it purchased the security company Verisign’s payment services, 
it became even bigger. That’s not necessarily a bad thing: The more users 
you have who take advantage of the same services, the more routine pay­
ments become, and the more customers trust the whole payment process.
PayPal’s Payments page (www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant) 
includes services such as Payflow, which lets your company accept pay­
ments online, and Website Payments, which facilitates payment with either 
credit cards or a PayPal account. Options include
	
✓	E-mail Payments: Your customers pay through e-mail communications; 
you don’t even need to have a website.
Reach for your wallet!
One of the terms commonly thrown around in 
the jargon of e-commerce is wallet. A wallet is 
software that, like a real wallet, stores avail­
able cash and other records. You reach into the 
cyberwallet and withdraw virtual cash rather 
than submit a credit card number.
The idea is that a cybershopper who uses 
wallet software, such as Windows Live ID 
(www.passport.com), can pay for items 
online in a matter of seconds, without having 
to transfer credit card data. What’s more, 
some wallets can even “remember” previous 
purchases and suggest future purchases. It’s 
taken years for the wallet concept to take hold 
in the United States, but one option is begin­
ning to gain traction: Google Wallet (www.
google.com/wallet). This app for Android 
phones allows consumers to pay at a growing 
number of retail outlets, including Best Buy, 
McDonald’s, and CVS. If you’re a merchant 
and you want to receive Google Wallet pay­
ments, read about it at www.google.com/
wallet/business/. You have to apply and 
then be approved to receive the API (application 
programming interface) needed to set up pay­
ments on your site.
Credit cards are quick and convenient, and 
they’ve proven to be secure enough for most 
consumers. Consumers who are committed to 
using Microsoft’s services can use Windows 
Live ID, which offers a “single sign-in” to reg­
ister or make purchases on sites that support 
this technology. It also enables consumers 
to create a wallet that stores their billing and 
shipping information. (Credit card numbers are 
stored in an offline database when users sign 
up for a Windows Live ID.) Customers can then 
make purchases at participating sites with the 
proverbial single mouse click. For your online 
business website to support Windows Live ID, 
you need to download and install the Windows 
Live ID Software Development Kit (SDK) on the 
server that runs your website. You may need 
some help in deploying this platform. Links to 
the SDK are included on the Windows Live 
ID SDK page (msdn.microsoft.com/
en-us/library/bb404787.aspx).

 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
	
✓	Website Payments Standard: Your customers choose an item to buy 
and are sent to PayPal’s site, where they can pay with a credit card or 
their PayPal account, if they have one.
	
✓	Website Payments Pro: Your customers choose an item to buy from a 
shopping cart you have on your site. They pay with a credit card on the 
site (PayPal processes the payment in the background) or to PayPal if 
they prefer to use their PayPal account.
Trying one of the following Payflow Payment Gateway options is free for 30 
days to see how it works with your own business, but both options require 
that you have a merchant account. (If you don’t have one, VeriSign suggests 
several financial institutions to which you can apply.) The Payflow services 
do carry some charges and require you to do some work, however:
	
✓	Payflow Link: The smallest and simplest of the VeriSign payment options, 
this service is intended for small businesses that process 500 transactions 
or fewer each month. You add a payment link to your online business 
site and you don’t have to do programming or other site development to 
get the payment system to work. You pay a $179 setup fee and a $19.95 
monthly fee.
	
✓	Payflow Pro: With this service, you can process up to 1,000 transactions 
per month, and any additional transactions cost 10 cents each. To use 
this option, you begin by installing the Payflow software on the server 
that runs your website. The customer then makes a purchase on your 
site, and the Payflow software sends the information to VeriSign, which 
processes the transaction. Payflow Pro carries a $249 setup fee and 
costs $59.95 per month.
You can sign up for a trial of Payflow Link or Payflow Pro on the Payflow 
Payment Gateway page (www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/payflow-
payment-gateway).
PayPal’s personal payment services
PayPal was one of the first online businesses to hit on the clever idea of 
giving business owners a way to accept credit and debit card payments from 
customers without having to apply for a merchant account, download software, 
apply for online payment processing, or some combination of these steps.
PayPal’s person-to-person payment services are ideal for transactions on 
eBay and other sites. In this sense, PayPal is essentially an escrow service: 
It functions as a sort of financial middleman, debiting buyers’ accounts 
and crediting the accounts of sellers — and, along the way, exacting a fee 
for its services, which it charges to the merchant receiving the payment. 
The accounts involved can be credit card accounts, checking accounts, or 
accounts held at PayPal into which members directly deposit funds. In other 

184
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
words, the person making the payment sets up an account with PayPal by 
identifying which account (credit card or checking, for example) a payment 
is to be taken from. The merchant also has a PayPal account and has identi­
fied which checking or credit card account is to receive payments. PayPal 
handles the virtual “card swipe” and verification of customer information.
PayPal is best known as a way to pay for items purchased on eBay. eBay, in 
fact, owns PayPal. But the service is regularly used to process payments both 
on and off the auction site. If you want to sell items (including through your 
website), you sign up for a PayPal Business or Premier account. You get a 
PayPal button that you add to your auction listing or sales web page. (If you 
sell on eBay, this button is provided automatically.) The customer clicks the 
button to transfer the payment from his or her PayPal account to yours, and 
you’re charged a transaction fee.
Setting up a PayPal account is free. Here’s how you can set up a PayPal 
Business account:
	
1.	 Go to the PayPal home page (www.paypal.com) and click the Sign Up 
Now button.
	
	 The PayPal Account Sign Up page appears.
	
2.	Choose your country of residence and your language, and click the 
Get Started button beneath PayPal for Business.
	
	 The Choose a PayPal Payments Solution page appears.
	
3.	For this example, click the Get Started button beneath Standard.
	
	 The Sign Up for PayPal Payments Standard page appears.
	
4.	Click Create New Account, verify your country and language prefer­
ence, and click Create New Account.
	
	 The Business Account Sign Up page appears.
	
5.	Follow the instructions on the two registration form pages and set up 
your account with PayPal.
	
	 After you fill out the registration forms, you receive an e-mail message 
with a link that takes you to the PayPal website to confirm your e-mail 
address.
	
6.	Click the link contained in the e-mail message.
	
	 You go to the Enter Password page.
	
7.	Enter your password (the one you created during the registration 
process) in the Password box and then click the login button.
	
	 You go to the My Business Setup page.
	
8.	Click the Merchant Services tab at the top of the My Account page.

you’re selling, including
 
• Enter a brief description of your sales item in the Item Name box.
 
• Enter an item number in the Item ID box.
 
• Enter the price in the Price box.
 
• Choose a button that shoppers can click to make the purchase. 
(You can choose either the PayPal logo button or a button that 
you’ve already created.)
	
11.	When you’re done, click the Create Button button.
	
	 You go to the You Are Viewing Your Button Code page, as shown in 
Figure 7-1.

12.	Copy the code in the Website box and paste it onto the web page that 
holds your sales item.
	
	 That’s all there is to it. When you receive a payment through eBay, 
you receive an e-mail notification. An example of an e-mail I received is 
shown in Figure 7-2. When someone sends you money directly through 
PayPal, you see that, too. You can then verify the payment by logging in 
to your account on the PayPal website.

You should realize that accepting money on PayPal is not free. Buyers don’t 
pay to use PayPal, but sellers do. I have a Premier account, and every time I 
receive money from an eBay transaction, PayPal takes its fees off the top. For 
a purchase of about $23, PayPal takes about $1 in fees, for example. On the 
plus side, PayPal does make a debit card available that you can use to make 
your own consumer purchases with the money in your account.
	
The nice thing about using PayPal is that the system enables you to accept 
payments through your website without having to obtain a merchant account. 
The thing to remember is that both you and your customers place a high level 
of trust in PayPal to handle your money. If fraud is a problem, PayPal investi­
gates it — or is supposed to, anyway. Some former PayPal users detest PayPal 
because of what they describe as a lack of responsiveness, and they describe 
their unhappiness in great detail on sites such as www.paypalsucks.com. Be 
aware of such complaints to have the full picture about PayPal and anticipate 
problems before they arise.
Google Checkout
Google seems to have a finger in just about every pie when it comes to 
e-commerce. Payments are no exception. Google Checkout (checkout.
google.com) is a convenient and safe way to pay online. The process of 
signing up for Google Checkout is relatively easy because you probably 
already have a Google password to check your Gmail or perform other ser­
vices with Google. If you don’t, just go to the Google Checkout home page 
and click Sign Up Now to obtain one.

187
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
Google Checkout was originally seen as a quick payment system for Google 
itself. If you saw something on a Google search results page and wanted 
to buy it, you could do so immediately through Google Checkout. But the 
service also functions as a full-fledged payment system much like PayPal: 
You sign up for Google Checkout and add “buy” buttons to your sale pages. 
Buyers can then click these buttons and pay you through Google Checkout. 
The service registers buyers and their credit card accounts, as well as sell­
ers and their account information. Google Checkout receives payments and 
passes them on to sellers, and for its efforts, it subtracts a discount rate.
	
Currently, the rate stands at 2.9 percent plus a 30-cent fee for a purchase 
under $3,000. Rates are lower for purchases of higher amounts. This is 
virtually the same as PayPal’s rate, at this writing.
One big difference between Google Checkout and PayPal is in the method of 
payment. Google Checkout accepts only credit card payments. PayPal, on the 
other hand, also allows withdrawals from bank accounts as well as “eChecks” 
(payments taken from a buyer’s checking account and deposited in the seller’s 
account after a suitable time for the “check” to clear).
Another difference between Google Checkout and PayPal is customer service. 
You can reach a PayPal service person on the phone, but you can’t reach 
Google Checkout this way.
An article on CNET (news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10348805-265.
html) reported on problems with recurring payments not being processed 
by Google Checkout for weeks at a time. Trying to reach a human being at 
Google to discuss the problems seems nearly impossible for the average 
merchant. (Writers like me can sometimes get a response from a PR person.)
On the plus side, Google Checkout is integrated with Google’s popular 
AdWords system. If you have an active AdWords account, your discount 
rate is lowered.
	
An article on the EcommerceBytes website (www.auctionbytes.com/cab/
abn/y09/m11/i05/s01) indicates that there may be another advantage to 
accepting Google Checkout on your website. If you receive payments and then 
get positive rankings from your customers, you’ll get better search placement 
for your site on Google.
Micropayments
Micropayments are very small units of currency that are exchanged by merchants 
and customers. The amounts involved may range from one-tenth of one cent 
(that’s $.001) to a few dollars. Such small payments enable sites to provide 
content for sale on a per-click basis. For users to read articles, listen to music 

188
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
files, or view video clips online, some sites require micropayments in a special 
form of electronic cash that goes by names such as scrip or eCash.
Micropayments seemed like a good idea in theory, but they’ve never caught on 
with most consumers. On the other hand, they’ve never totally disappeared, 
either. The business that proved conclusively that consumers are willing to 
pay small amounts of money to purchase creative content online is none other 
than the computer manufacturer Apple, which revolutionized e-commerce 
with its iPod music player and iTunes Store. Every day, users pay $1.29 to 
download a song and add it to their iPod selections. But they make such 
payments with their credit cards, using real dollars and cents.
In other words, iTunes payments aren’t true micropayments. But it’s just about 
the only system I know that deals in small payments for items purchased 
or downloaded online that’s really successful. While I was updating this 
book some news came out about a promising micropayment system called 
Tinypass (www.tinypass.com). It’s used by Andrew Sullivan, one of the 
most successful bloggers around, to move his blog The Dish to a “paywall” 
system. Regular readers are asked to subscribe for $19.99 per year to read the 
blog without ads and without restrictions. Visitors are allowed to read a certain 
amount each month for free; after that, they must subscribe. In just a month, 
The Dish had collected more than $480,000 in subscriptions, so this is a case 
where micropayments are working. If you blog or plan to sell content, look 
into Tinypass.
Other payment options
A number of new online payment options let people pay for merchandise 
without having to submit credit card numbers or mail checks. Here are some 
additional options to consider:
	
✓	Dwolla (www.dwolla.com): This relatively new and increasingly popu­
lar payment services is great for small-scale sales— for transactions 
under $10, there are no fees. For a sale of more than $10, the fee is 25 cents. 
	
✓	Amazon Payments (payments.amazon.com): Amazon enables users who 
sell online to accept payments from customers on their websites. Fees 
start at 2.9 percent plus a 30-cent transaction fee for payments over $10.
	
✓	InspirePay (www.inspirepay.com): Sometimes, shopping cart–based 
online payments aren’t appropriate. Buyers who purchase a group of 
items from you at wholesale, for example, might prefer an invoice. If that’s 
the case, and if your business also has a payment service in place (such 
as a merchant account, PayPal, Google Checkout, or Dwolla), consider 
InspirePay. Users create an InspirePay page, then request payment by 
sending the buyer a link. For a sale of $60, the link would take the form 

189
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
https://inspirepay.com/pay/mark/$60.00. In this case, when the 
recipient clicks on the link, InspirePay pays the sender $60.
	
✓	ClearTran (www.bnymellon.com/cleartran/): This service enables 
shoppers to make purchases by sending online checks to merchants. 
The shopper notifies the seller about the purchase and then contacts 
a special secure website to authorize a debit from his or her checking 
account. The secure site then transmits the electronic check to the mer­
chant, who can either print the check on paper or save the check in a 
special format that can be transmitted to banks for immediate deposit.
Which one of these options is right for you? That depends on what you want 
to sell online. If you’re providing articles, reports, music, or other content 
that you want people to pay a nominal fee to access, consider a micropay­
ment system (see the preceding section). If your customers tend to be 
sophisticated, technically savvy individuals who are likely to embrace online 
checks or billing systems, consider ClearTran. The important things are to 
provide customers with several options for submitting payment and to make 
the process as easy as possible.
Fulfilling Your Online Orders
Being on the Internet can help when it comes to the final step in the e-com­
merce dance: order fulfillment. Fulfillment refers to what happens after a sale 
is made. Typical fulfillment tasks include the following:
	
✓	Packing up the merchandise
	
✓	Shipping the merchandise
	
✓	Solving delivery problems or answering questions about orders that 
haven’t reached their destinations
	
✓	Sending out bills
	
✓	Following up to see whether the customer is satisfied
Order fulfillment may seem like the least exciting part of running a business, 
online or otherwise. But from your customers’ point of view, it’s the most 
important business activity of all. The following sections suggest how you 
can use your presence online to help reduce any anxiety your customers may 
feel about receiving what they ordered.
	
The back-end (or, to use the Microsoft term, BackOffice) part of your online 
business is where order fulfillment comes in. If you have a database in which 
you record customer orders, link it to your website so that your customers 
can track orders. Dreamweaver or ColdFusion can help you set up a database. 
(Dreamweaver contains built-in commands that let you link to a ColdFusion 

190
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
database.) Alternatively, if you don’t want to go through the effort of setting 
up the database yourself, you depend on your marketplace’s back-end capa­
bilities, which may be more limited.
Providing links to shipping services
One advantage of being online is that you can help customers track packages 
after shipment. The FedEx online order-tracking feature, shown in Figure 7-3, 
gets thousands of requests each day and is widely known as one of the most 
successful marketing tools on the web. If you use FedEx, provide your cus­
tomers with a link to its online tracking page.
	
Figure 7-3: 
Provide 
links to 
online track-
ing services 
so that your 
customers 
can check 
delivery 
status.
	
The other big shipping services have also created their own online tracking 
systems. You can link to these sites, too:
	
✓	United Parcel Service (www.ups.com).
	
✓	U.S. Postal Service Express Mail (www.usps.gov).
	
✓	DHL (www.dhl-usa.com). Be aware that DHL no longer accepts deliveries 
from the United States to a domestic U.S. address but will ship to/from 
other countries.
Presenting shipping options clearly
In order fulfillment, as in receiving payment, it pays to present your clients 
with as many options as possible and to explain the options in detail. 

191
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
Because you’re online, you can provide your customers with as much ship­
ping information as they can stand. Web surfers are knowledge hounds — 
they can never get enough data, whether it’s related to shipping or other 
parts of your business.
When it comes to shipping, be sure to describe the options, the cost of each, 
and how long each takes. Here are some more specific suggestions:
	
✓	Compare shipping costs. Use an online service, such as InterShipper 
(www.intershipper.com), that allows you to submit the origin, desti­
nation, weight, and dimensions of a package that you want to ship via a 
web page form and then returns the cheapest shipping alternatives.
	
✓	Make sure you can track a package. Pick a service that lets you track 
your package’s shipping status.
	
✓	Be able to confirm receipt. If you use the U.S. Postal Service, ship the 
package “return receipt requested” because tracking isn’t available — 
unless you use Priority Mail or Express Mail. You can confirm delivery 
with Priority Mail (domestic) and Parcel Post.
	
Many online stores present shipping alternatives in the form of a table or bul­
leted list of options — or, at the very least, a set of options that resembles a 
bulleted list. (Tables, as you probably know, are web page design elements 
that let you arrange content in rows and columns, making them easier to read; 
refer to Chapter 5 for more on adding tables to your site.) You don’t have to 
look very far to find an example; just visit the Dummies.com website (www.
dummies.com) and order a book from its online store. When you’re ready 
to pay for your items and provide a shipping address, you see the shipping 
options, which are lined up just like a bulleted list, as shown in Figure 7-4.

Tables help

costs, keep 
track of

Joining the International Trade Brigade
International trade may seem like something that only multinational corpora­
tions practice. But the so-called little guys like you and me can be international 
traders, too. In fact, the term simply refers to a transaction between two or 
more individuals or companies in different countries. If you’re a designer 
living in the United States and you create some stationery artwork and web 
pages for someone in Germany, you’re involved in international trade.
Keeping up with international trade issues
If you really want to be effective in marketing yourself overseas and become 
an international player in world trade, you need to follow the tried-and-true 
business strategies: networking, education, and research. Join groups that 
promote international trade, become familiar with trade laws and restrictions, 
and generally get a feel for the best marketing practices around the world.
Here are some suggestions for places you can start:
	
✓	The Market Access Unit page of the Irish government’s Department 
of Enterprise, Trade, and Employment website (www.entemp.ie/
trade/marketaccess): This page contains links to the European 
Union’s Commercial Policy as well as requirements governing Export 
Licensing and Import Licensing.
	
✓	Small Business Exporters Association (www.sbea.org): This group of 
small and midsize business exporters is devoted to networking, assis­
tance, and advocacy.
	
✓	globalEDGE (globaledge.msu.edu/reference-desk): This site is 
published by Michigan State University and includes hundreds of inter­
national trade links.
	
✓	Newsletter Access (www.newsletteraccess.com/subject/inter
trade.html): This website has information on how to subscribe to more 
than 9,000 different newsletters that discuss international trade issues.
Researching specific trade laws
Rather than wait for overseas business to come to you, take a proactive 
approach. First, do some research into the appropriate trade laws that 
apply to countries you might do business with. The Internet has an amazing 
amount of information pertaining to trade practices for individual countries.

193
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
You can seek out international business by using one or more message 
boards designed specifically for small business owners who want to partici­
pate in international trade. These message boards let users post trade leads, 
which are messages that announce international business opportunities.
For example, at the TradersCity Import and Export Trade Leads board (www.
traderscity.com/board), you may find a message from a Finnish com­
pany selling surplus paint, a U.S. company that needs office equipment, or a 
British company offering X-ray equipment for export. Advertisements on this 
site typically include the URL for the business’s website. The site does not 
charge a fee to post notices.
	
If you’re in the business of creating computer software or hardware, you need 
to be aware of restrictions that the U.S. government imposes on the export of 
some computer-related products. In fact, you may incur a fine of more than 
$100,000 from the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. State Department for 
exporting just about anything high-tech to a Denied Person, Specially Designated 
National, or Restricted Country. The list of these people and countries changes 
frequently. Look for links to the current ones at www.treas.gov/offices/
enforcement/ofac/sdn/.
	
The Buy & Sell Exchange site of the Federation of International Trade 
Associations (www.worldbid.com) lets you post your own trade leads or 
search for other leads by keyword. You can find the Trade Leads page of 
the extensive globalEDGE site (http://globaledge.msu.edu/global-
resources/trade-leads) which includes links to sites that post trade 
leads in countries such as Egypt, India, and Taiwan.
Exploring free trade zones
A free trade zone (FTZ) is an officially designated business or industrial area in 
a country where foreign and domestic goods are considered to be “outside” 
the territory covered by customs. You don’t have to pay customs duty, taxes, 
or tariffs on merchandise brought into, handled, or stored in an FTZ. You can 
find FTZs in many countries as well as in many U.S. states.
The purpose of FTZs is to reduce customs costs and make it easier for busi­
nesses to send goods into foreign countries. You can store your items in 
FTZs for a while, exhibit them, and, if necessary, change them to comply with 
the import requirements of the country in question, until you want to import 
them into that country.

194
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Shipping Overseas Goods
It never hurts to state the obvious, so here goes: Don’t depend on ground 
mail (appropriately nicknamed snail mail) to communicate with overseas 
customers. Use e-mail and fax to get your message across — and, if you have 
to ship information or goods, use airmail express delivery. Surface mail can 
take weeks or even months to reach some regions of some countries — if it 
gets there at all.
Your customer may ask you to provide an estimate of your export costs by 
using a special set of abbreviations called incoterms. Incoterms (short for 
international commercial trade terms) are standardized acronyms originally 
established in 1936 by the International Chamber of Commerce. They estab­
lish an international language for describing business transactions to prevent 
misunderstandings between buyers and sellers from different countries. 
Incoterms thus provide a universal vocabulary that is recognized by all 
international financial institutions.
Incoterms are most likely to apply to you if you’re shipping a large number of 
items to an overseas factory rather than, for example, a single painting to an 
individual’s home. But just in case you hit the big time, you should be aware 
of common incoterms, such as
	
✓	EXW (Ex Works): This term means that the seller fulfills his or her obli­
gation by making the goods available to the buyer at the seller’s own 
premises (or works). The seller doesn’t have to load the goods onto the 
buyer’s vehicle unless otherwise agreed.
	
✓	FOB (Free on Board): This term refers to the cost of shipping overseas 
by ship — not something you’re likely to do in this high-tech day and age. 
But if you sell a vintage automobile to a collector in France, who knows?
	
✓	CFR (Cost and Freight): This term refers to the costs and freight charges 
necessary to transport items to a specific overseas port. CFR describes 
only costs related to items that are shipped by sea and inland waterways 
and that go to an actual port. Another incoterm, CPT (Carriage Paid To), 
can refer to any type of transport, not just shipping, and refers to the cost 
for the transport (or carriage) of the goods to their destination.
	
You can find a detailed examination of incoterms at the International Chamber 
of Commerce website (www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/
trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/).
If the item you’re planning to ship overseas by mail is valued at more than 
$2,500, the United States requires you to fill out and use the Automated 
Export System (AES) and submit it to a U.S. customs agent. The AES collects 

195
 Chapter 7: Accepting Payments
Electronic Export Information (EEI). To use the AES, you need to obtain either 
filer certification or, if you create computer programs, software certification. 
You have to file for certification and take a short test. Links to detailed instruc­
tions on how to use the AES are available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website 
(www.census.gov/foreign-trade/aes/documentlibrary/index.html). 
You can file your electronic export data with the AES through the U.S. Customs 
Service’s website (www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/automated/aes/).
Some nations require a certificate of origin or a signed statement that attests 
to the origin of the exported item. You can usually obtain such certificates 
through a local chamber of commerce.
Some purchasers or countries may also ask for a certificate of inspection 
stating the specifications met by the goods shipped. Inspections are per­
formed by independent testing organizations.
	
Wherever you ship your items, be sure to insure them for the full amount they 
are worth — and tell your customers about any additional insurance charges 
upfront. Choose an insurance company that can respond quickly to claims 
made from your own country and from your customer’s country.
Getting Paid in International Trade
Having an effective billing policy in place is especially important when your 
customers live thousands of miles away. The safest strategy is to request 
payment in U.S. dollars and ask for cash in advance. This approach prevents 
any collection problems and gets you your money right away.
What happens if you want to receive payment in U.S. dollars from someone 
overseas but the purchaser is reluctant to send cash? You have a couple of 
options:
	
✓	You can ask the purchaser to send you a personal check — or, better 
yet, a cashier’s check — but it’s up to the buyer to convert the local 
currency to U.S. dollars.
	
✓	You can suggest that the buyer obtain an International Money Order 
from a U.S. bank that has a branch in his or her area, and specify that 
the money order be payable in U.S. dollars.
Suggest that your customers use an online currency conversion utility, such 
as the Bloomberg Online Currency Calculator (www.bloomberg.com/
markets/currencies/currency-converter) to do the calculation.

196
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
You can also use an online escrow service — such as Escrow.com (www.
escrow.com) or Skrill (formerly Moneybookers.com; www.moneybookers.
com) — to hold funds in escrow until you and your customer strike a deal. An 
escrow service holds the customer’s funds in a trust account so that the seller 
can ship an item knowing that he or she will be paid. The escrow service 
transfers the funds from buyer to seller after the buyer has inspected the 
goods and approved them.
	
Escrow services usually accept credit card payments from overseas purchas­
ers; this is one way to accept credit card payments even if you don’t have 
a merchant account yourself. The credit card company handles conversion 
from the local currency into U.S. dollars.
If you’re doing a lot of business overseas, consider getting export insurance 
to protect yourself against loss from damage or delay in transit. Policies are 
available from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (www.exim.gov) 
or from other private firms that offer export insurance.

I

 once spoke to an antiques dealer who has been selling in a brick-and-
mortar store for more than 30 years and several years online. “When 
someone asks me a question, I am very polite in my answer,” said Eva Kertesz. 
“Good correspondence with customers is very important. I don’t use any 
special gimmick.”
Besides having a good idea and lots of chutzpah, the best sellers invariably 
provide the best customer service. They include extras such as cards and 
gifts in packages, they make an effort to ship merchandise the same day it’s 
purchased, they have a clear return policy and stick to it, and they answer 
questions promptly. All of these things help create a positive feedback cycle: 
You provide good service and get good response from customers, you build 
more trust, you inspire more people to buy from you, and on and on. When I 
made an effort to include some “extras” with my packages and to ship quickly 
and carefully, I received my own glowing comments of appreciation, which 
proved highly satisfying.
Customer service is one area in which small, entrepreneurial businesses can 
outshine brick-and-mortar stores and even larger online competitors. Whether 
you’re competing in the areas of e-trading, e-music, or e-tail sales of any sort 
doesn’t matter. Tools such as e-mail, RSS feeds, and interactive forms, coupled 
with the fact that an online commerce site can provide information 24/7, give 
you a powerful advantage when it comes to retaining customers and building 
loyalty. Make no mistake: Giving personal attention to customers who call you 
on the phone or demand instant shipment is hard work. But it pays off in the 
long run.

198
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Being responsive and available is only part of the picture, however. This 
chapter presents ways to succeed with the other essential components: pro­
viding information, communicating effectively, and enabling your clientele to 
talk back to you online.
Keeping Your Customers in the Loop
Satisfaction is all about expectations. If you give your customers what they’re 
expecting or even a little bit more, they’ll be happy. But how do you go about 
setting their level of expectation in the first place? Communication is the key. 
The more information you can provide upfront, the fewer phone queries or 
complaints you’ll receive later. Printed pamphlets and brochures have tradi­
tionally described products and services at length. Online is now the way to 
go, though.
Say you’re talking about a 1,000-word description of your new company and 
your products, services, or both. If that text were formatted to fit on a 4-x-9-inch 
foldout brochure, the contents would cover several panels and take at least a 
few hundred dollars to print.
On the other hand, if those same 1,000 words were arranged on a few web pages 
and put online, they’d probably be no more than 5KB–10KB in size. The same 
applies if you distribute your content to subscribers in an e-mail newsletter. 
In either case, you pay only a little to publish the information.
Online publishing also has the advantage of easier updating. When you add 
new products or services, or even when you want a different approach, it 
takes only a little time and effort to change the contents or the look.
Providing FAQs
FAQs (frequently asked questions) can be found on nearly every organization’s 
website. They have worked for many online businesspeople, and they can 
work for you.
Even the format of FAQ pages is similar from site to site, and this predictability 
is an asset. FAQ pages are generally presented in Q-and-A format, with topics 
appearing in the form of questions that have literally been asked by other 
customers or that have been made up to resemble real questions. Each ques­
tion has a brief answer that provides essential information about the business.
Just because I’m continually touting communication doesn’t mean I want 
you to bore your potential customers with endless words that don’t apply to 

199
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
their interests. To keep your FAQ page from getting too long, I recommend 
that you list all the questions at the top of the page. This way, by clicking a 
hyperlinked item in the list, readers jump to the spot on the page where you 
present the question that relates to them and its answer in detail.
	
Just having a FAQ page isn’t enough. Make sure that yours is easy to use and 
comprehensive. Take a look at one of the most famous of the genre, the vener­
able World Wide Web FAQ by Thomas Boutell www.boutell.com/newfaq 
for ideas.
	
Sure, you could compose a FAQ page off the top of your head, but sometimes 
getting a different perspective helps. Invite visitors, customers, friends, and 
family to come up with questions about your business. You may want to 
include questions on some of the following topics:
	
✓	Contact information: If I need to reach you in a hurry by mail, fax, or 
phone, how do I do that? Are you available only during certain hours?
	
✓	Instructions: What if I need more detailed instructions on how to use 
your products or services? Where can I find them?
	
✓	Service: What do I do if the merchandise breaks or doesn’t work for 
some reason? Do you have a return policy?
	
✓	Sales tax: Is sales tax added to the cost I see onscreen?
	
✓	Returns or exchanges: If I’m not satisfied, can I get my money back or 
exchange an item? Is there a time limit on this policy?
	
✓	Shipping: What are my shipping options?
	
Nothing makes you look worse than an out-of-date FAQ page. Keep your page 
up to date as your business grows. Make sure the questions match the sales 
items and services that you actually provide.
Writing an online newsletter
You may define yourself as an online businessperson, not a newsletter editor. 
But sharing information with customers and potential customers through an 
e-mail newsletter is a great way to build credibility for yourself and your 
business.
For added customer service (not to mention a touch of self-promotion), con­
sider producing a regular publication that you send out to a mailing list. Your 
mailing list would begin with customers and prospective customers who visit 
your website and indicate that they want to subscribe.

200
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
An e-mail newsletter doesn’t happen by magic, but it can provide your business 
with long-term benefits that include
	
✓	Customer tracking: You can add subscribers’ e-mail addresses to a mail­
ing list that you can use for other marketing purposes, such as promot­
ing special sales items for return customers.
	
✓	Low bandwidth: An e-mail newsletter doesn’t require much memory. 
Such newsletters are great for businesspeople who get their e-mail on 
the road via laptops, Palm devices, or appliances that are designed spe­
cifically for sending and receiving e-mail.
	
✓	Timeliness: You can include breaking news in your electronic newsletter 
much faster than you can put it in print.
The fun part is to name your newsletter and assemble the content you want 
to include. Then follow these steps to get your publication up and running:
	
1.	Create your newsletter by typing the contents in plain-text (ASCII) 
format.
	
	 Optionally, you can also provide an HTML-formatted version. You can 
then include headings and graphics, which show up in e-mail programs 
that support HTML e-mail messages.
	
	 If you use a plain-text newsletter, format it by using capital letters; rules 
that consist of a row of equal signs, hyphens, or asterisks; or blank 
spaces to align elements.
	
2.	Save your file with the proper filename extension: .txt for the text 
version and .htm or .html if you send an HTML version.
	
3.	Attach the file to an e-mail message by using your e-mail program’s 
method of sending attachments — or paste it into the body of the 
message if your recipients don’t receive attachments.
	
4.	Address your e-mail to the recipients.
	
	 If you have lots of subscribers (many newsletters have hundreds or 
thousands), save their addresses in a mailing list. Use your e-mail 
program’s address book function to do this.
	
5.	Send your newsletter.
	
If you have a large number of subscribers, I recommend sending your publi­
cation late at night, when there is generally less traffic on the Internet. I also 
recommend sending it in several stages — that is, to only so many subscribers 
simultaneously — rather than all at one time. Those are two good ways to 
help your words reach their destination quickly and reliably.
Managing a mailing list can be time consuming. You have to keep track of 
people who want to subscribe or unsubscribe, as well as those who ask for 

201
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
more information. You can save time and trouble by installing a management 
system such as Lyris ListManager (www.lyris.com) to do the day-to-day list 
management for you.
The popular e-mail communication service Constant Contact makes it easy 
to format a publication or message to send to a group. You can insert images 
from a library you create, and add colors and change type styles as well. The 
body of a message I’m working on and a menu of text tools with which to edit 
it is shown in Figure 8-1. The program also makes it easy for recipients to 
unsubscribe if they wish.
	
Figure 8-1:

Contact lets

Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) enables you to save a publica­
tion with the images, special typefaces, and other layout features intact. You 
can save your file as a PDF document and mail it. Recipients need the widely 
available program Adobe Reader to open it. You can create PDF files with the 
CutePDF (www.cutepdf.com) application.
Mixing bricks and clicks
If you operate a brick-and-mortar business as well as a web-based business, 
you have additional opportunities to get feedback from your shoppers. Take 
advantage of the fact that you meet customers personally and ask them for 
opinions and suggestions that can help you operate a more effective website.
When your customers make a purchase, include a message on the receipt 
asking them to go to your website where they can enter to win a cash prize 

202
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
if they fill out a questionnaire about your website within 24 hours. Consider 
asking questions like the following:
	
✓	Have you visited this store’s website? Are you familiar with it?
	
✓	Would you visit the website more often if you knew there was merchan­
dise or content there that you couldn’t find in our physical location?
	
✓	Can you suggest some types of merchandise, or special sales, you’d like 
to see on the website?
It’s also a good idea to include your website’s URL on the printed literature 
in your store. The feedback system works both ways, of course: You can 
ask online customers for suggestions on how to run your brick-and-mortar 
store better and what types of merchandise they’d like to see on your real, as 
opposed to your “virtual,” shelves.
Creating an RSS feed
E-mail newsletters and hyperlinks are becoming passé. These days, blogs and 
RSS feeds are the preferred options for getting the word out. The phrase “send 
an RSS feed of your website or eBay listings” might sound really high-tech and 
complex. But it’s Really Simple — Really Simple Syndication, or RSS, that is.
RSS converts the contents of a web page to an eXtensible Markup Language 
(XML) file so that it can be read in a flash by anyone with an RSS reader soft­
ware program. People subscribe to your RSS feed, and they receive it each 
time your site’s contents are updated.
RSS is a marketing tool that is widely used in the world of blogs. Just as a 
blog publisher can, you can capture an RSS feed of your sales and offer it 
(you might say, feed it) to customers who want to subscribe to it. If you sell 
through an eBay Store (an option I describe in Chapter 14), it’s easy to get 
started. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Subscribe to a feeder program, such as FeedBurner (www.feed
burner.com), or one of the readers I describe in Chapter 1.
	
2.	Go to your MyeBay page at www.ebay.com and sign in with your User 
ID and password if needed.
	
	 The MyeBay page appears.
	
3.	Hover your mouse pointer over the Account tab and then select 
Marketing Tools from the drop-down list.
	
4.	In the Store Marketing links on the left side of the page, click the RSS 
Feeds link.
	
5.	In the RSS Feeds for eBay Buyers area, select the Activate Your Fixed 
Price Listings via RSS option.

203
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
	
6.	Click Apply.
	
	eBay creates the file within 12 hours and posts it to a web address (URL) 
based on your Store’s URL. Enter the URL in your web browser to see 
if the content is available. For example, if your Store’s name is “Flashy 
Shoes,” the file is posted to http://esssl.ebay.com/GetListings/
flashyshoes.
Once your RSS feed is available, tell your customers they can access it. If you 
don’t sell through eBay, turning your catalog listings into an RSS feed isn’t 
quite as simple. You need to come up with a standard description for your 
listings: a listing title, description, and hyperlink. You then format each item 
like this:
<item>
<title>Model 101 Widget</title>
<description>Check out the 101, the latest and greatest widget offering ever!</
description>
<link>http://www.mywidgetcatalog.com/widget101.html</link>
</item>
You go to a site, such as Feed Validator (http://feedvalidator.org), to 
make sure that your formatting is correct. Then subscribe to one of the RSS 
readers mentioned at http://searchenginewatch.com/article/
2065637/RSS-Your-Gateway-To-News-Blog-Content or in Chapter 1 of 
this book. Copy your feed to the reader and distribute it. Find more info about 
creating feeds at http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2065614/

Helping Customers Reach You
I have an unlisted home phone number. But being anonymous is not the way 
to go when you’re running an online business. (I use a different number for 
business calls, by the way.) Of course, you don’t have to promise to be avail­
able 24/7 to your customers. But they need to believe that they can get atten­
tion no matter what time of the day or night. When you’re online, contact 
information can take several forms. Be sure to include
	
✓	Your snail-mail address
	
✓	Your e-mail address(es)
	
✓	Your phone and fax numbers as well as a toll-free number (if you have one)
	
My brother recently obtained a toll-free (800) number for his audio restoration 
business (www.lp2cdsolutions.com). He obtained the number for $30 and 
then had the number assigned to a landline (not a cell phone line). A service 
called uReach (www.ureach.com) can forward a toll-free number to your cell 

204
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
phone. And businesses such as TollFreeNumber.org (www.tollfreenumber.
org) give you an 800 number that rings on your cell phone. Of course, you 
also pay for the calls. Ask your local phone company for more information. 
Google Voice (www.google.com/voice) offers voice service, although a 
nonprofit group I am affiliated with has had trouble getting it to work. Maybe 
you’ll have better luck.
Most web hosting services (such as the types of hosts I describe in Chapter 4) 
give you more than one e-mail inbox as part of your account. So it may be 
helpful to set up more than one e-mail address: one for people to communicate 
with you personally and the other where people go for general information. You 
can also set up e-mail addresses that respond to messages by automatically 
sending a text file. (See the “Setting up autoresponders” section, later in this 
chapter.)
Even though you probably won’t meet many of your customers in person, you 
need to provide them with a human connection. Keep your site as personal 
and friendly as possible. A contact page is a good place to provide some brief 
biographical information about the people visitors can contact, namely you 
and any employees or partners in your company.
	
Putting your contact information on a separate web page makes your patrons 
have to wait a few seconds to access it. If your contact data is simple and your 
website consists of only a few pages, by all means put it right on your home 
page.
Going upscale with your e-mail
These days nearly everyone I know, including my father, has an e-mail account. 
But when you’re an online businessperson, you need to know more about 
the features of e-mail than just how to ask about the weather or exchange a 
recipe. The more you discover about the finer technical points of e-mail, the 
better you can meet the needs of your clients. The following sections suggest 
ways to go beyond simply sending and receiving e-mail messages so that you 
can use e-mail for business publishing and marketing.
Don’t forget e-mail basics when it comes to customer service. Tim Nguyen, a 
former eBay seller who became sales manager at Trumpia (www.trumpia.com), 
told me he learned how to be professional with his e-mails — to respond in a 
timely manner. “Timing is everything, because you’re not dealing with 
customers face-to-face.”
Setting up autoresponders
An autoresponder, also called a mailbot, is software that you can set up to 
send automatic replies to requests for information about a product or ser­
vice, or to respond to people subscribing to an e-mail publication or service.

205
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
You can provide automatic responses either through your own e-mail program 
or your web host’s e-mail service. If you use a web host to provide automatic 
responses, you can usually purchase an extra e-mail address that can be 
configured to return a text file (such as a form letter) to the sender.
Look for a web host that provides you with one or more autoresponders 
along with your account. Typically, your host assigns you an e-mail address 
that takes the form info@mycompany.com. In this case, someone at your 
hosting service configures the account so that when a visitor to your site 
sends a message to info@yourcompany.com, a file of your choice, such as 
a simple text document that contains background information about you and 
your services, automatically goes out to the sender as a reply. You can do 
this in Gmail by following these steps:
	
1.	Click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Gmail window.
	
2.	Click Settings from the drop-down list that appears.
	
	The Settings options appear in the main area of the Gmail window.
	
3.	In the General Settings area (the options that appear beneath the 
Settings heading), scroll down to Vacation Responder and select the 
Vacation Responder On option.
	
4.	Type a subject and message for your automatic response in the Subject 
and Message fields, as shown in Figure 8-2.
	
5.	(Optional) Select the Only Send a Response to People in My Contacts 
check box if you don’t want everyone who e-mails you to know that 
you’re away from your mail.
	
Figure 8-2: 
Many web 
hosts and 
ISPs enable 
users to 
create their 
own auto-
response 
messages.
	

206
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
6.	Click Save Changes when you’re done.
	
	 With the vacation responder turned on, you see a banner across the top 
of any Gmail page, displaying the subject of your vacation response. To 
stop Gmail from automatically sending the response, click End Now in 
the banner.
	
If the service that hosts your website doesn’t provide free autoresponders, 
look into SendFree, an online service that provides you with autoresponder 
service for free but requires you to display ads along with your automatic 
response. (An ad-free version is available for $19.97 per month.) Read about it 
at www.sendfree.com.
Noting by quoting
Responding to a series of questions is easy when you use quoting — a feature 
that lets you copy portions of the message to which you’re replying. Quoting, 
which is available in almost all e-mail programs, is particularly useful for 
responding to a mailing list or newsgroup message because it indicates the 
specific topic being discussed.
How do you tell the difference between the quoted material and the body of 
the new e-mail message? The common convention is to put a greater-than (>) 
character in the left margin, next to each line of quoted material.
When you tell your e-mail software to quote the original message before you 
type your reply, it generally quotes the entire message. To save space, you 
can snip (delete) the part that isn’t relevant. However, if you do so, it’s polite 
to type the word <snip> to show that you’ve cut something out.
Attaching files
A quick and convenient way to transmit information is to attach a file to an 
e-mail message. In fact, attaching files is one of the most useful things you 
can do with e-mail. Attaching — sending a document or file along with an 
e-mail message — allows you to include material from any file to which you 
have access. Attached files appear as separate documents that recipients can 
download to their computers.
Many e-mail clients allow users to attach files with the simple click of a 
button or other command. Compressing a lengthy series of attachments by 
using software, such as StuffIt or WinZip, conserves bandwidth. Using com­
pression is also a necessity if you want to send more than one attached file 
to someone whose e-mail account (such as an AOL account) doesn’t accept 
multiple attachments.
Creating a signature file that sells
One of the easiest and most useful tools for marketing on the Internet is a sig­
nature file, or sig file. A signature file is a text blurb that your system appends 

207
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
automatically to the bottom of your e-mail messages and newsgroup postings. 
You want your signature file to tell the readers of your message something 
about you and your business. You can include information such as your com­
pany name and how to contact you.
Creating a signature file takes only a little more time than putting your John 
Hancock on the dotted line. First, to create the signature file itself, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Open a text-editing program.
	
	 This example uses Notepad, which comes built in with Windows. If 
you’re a Mac user, you can use SimpleText. With either program, a new 
blank document opens onscreen.
	
2.	Press and hold down the hyphen (–) key or the equal sign (=) key to 
create a dividing line that separates your signature from the body of 
your message.
	
	 Depending on which symbol you use, a series of hyphens or equal signs 
forms a broken line. Don’t make this line too long, or it runs onto another 
line, which doesn’t look good; 30 to 40 characters is a safe measure.
	
3.	Type the information about yourself that you want to appear in the 
signature, pressing Enter after each line.
	
	 Include such information as your name, job title, company name, e-mail 
address, and website URL, if you have one. A three- or four-line signature 
is the typical length.
	
	 If you’re feeling ambitious, you can press the spacebar to arrange your 
text in two columns. My agent (who’s an online entrepreneur) does this 
with his own signature file, as shown in Figure 8-3.
	
Figure 8-3: 
A signature 
file often 
uses divider 
lines and a 
two-column 
format to 
occupy 
less space 
onscreen.
	

208
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
	
	 Always include the URL to your business website in your signature file, 
and be sure to include it on its own line. Why? Most e-mail programs rec­
ognize the URL as a web page by its prefix (http://). When your reader 
opens your message, the e-mail program displays the URL as a clickable 
hyperlink that, when clicked, opens your web page in a web browser 
window.
	
4.	Choose File➪Save.
	
	 A dialog box appears, in which you can name the file and save it to a 
folder on your hard drive.
	
5.	Type a name for your file that ends in the filename extension .txt.
	
	 This extension identifies your file as a plain-text document.
	
6.	Click Save.
	
	 Your text file is saved on your computer’s hard drive.
If you created a plain-text version of your electronic signature, the next step 
is to identify that file to the computer programs that you use to send and 
receive e-mail and newsgroup messages. Doing so enables the programs to 
make the signature file appear automatically at the bottom of your messages. 
The procedure for attaching a signature file varies from program to program; 
the following steps show you how to do it using Microsoft Outlook Express 6:
	
1.	Start Outlook Express and choose Tools➪Options.
	
	 The Options dialog box opens.
	
2.	Click the Signatures tab.
	
3.	Click New.
	
	 The options are highlighted in the Signatures and Edit Signature sections 
of the Signatures tab.
	
4.	Click File at the bottom of the tab and then click Browse.
	
	 The Open dialog box appears. This is a standard Windows navigation 
dialog box that lets you select folders and files on your computer.
	
5.	Locate the signature file that you created in the preceding set of steps 
by selecting a drive or folder from the Look In drop-down list.
	
6.	When you locate the file, click the filename and then click Open.
	
	 The Signature File dialog box closes, and you return to the Options dialog 
box. The path leading to the selected file is listed in the box next to File.
	
7.	Select the Add Signatures to All Outgoing Messages check box and 
then click OK.
	
	 The Options dialog box closes, and you return to Outlook Express. Your 
signature file is added automatically to your messages.

209
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
To test your new signature file, choose File➪New➪Mail Message from the 
Outlook Express menu bar. A new message composition window opens. Your 
signature file appears in the body of the message composition window. You 
can compose a message by clicking before the signature and typing.
	
Signature files, autoresponders, and other techy gimmicks are fine, but the 
key to making them work is checking your e-mail and phone messages every 
single day. That includes weekends! If you can’t do the job yourself, assign 
an employee to do it. That’s the single most important customer service tip I 
can give you: Check your messages as frequently as possible, and respond to 
inquiries as quickly as you can.
Creating forms that aren’t formidable
In the old days, people who heard “Here’s a form to fill out” usually started 
to groan. Who likes to stare at a form to apply for a job or for financial aid, 
or, even worse, to figure out how much you owe in taxes? But as an online 
businessperson, forms can be your best friends because they give customers 
a means to provide you with feedback as well as essential marketing informa­
tion. With forms, you can find out where customers live, how old they are, 
and so on. Customers can also use forms to sound off and ask questions.
Forms can be really handy from the perspective of the customer as well. The 
speed of the Internet enables them to dash off information right away. They 
can then pretty much immediately receive a response from you that’s tai­
lored to their needs and interests.
The two components of web page forms
Forms consist of two parts, only one of which is visible on a web page:
	
✓	The visible part of the form includes the text-entry fields, buttons, and 
check boxes that an author creates with HTML commands.
	
✓	The invisible part of the form is a computer script that resides on the 
server that receives the page.
The script, which is typically written in a language such as Perl, AppleScript, 
or C++, processes the form data a reader submits to a server and presents 
that data in a format the owner or operator of the website can read and use.
Getting the data
Exactly what happens when customers connect to a page on your site that 
contains a form? First, they fill out the text-entry fields and other areas you 
have set up, and select the option (sometimes called radio) buttons. When 
they finish, they click a button, often marked Submit, to transmit (or post) the 
data from the remote computer to your website.

210
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
A computer script called a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program 
receives the data submitted to your site and processes it so that you can 
read it. The CGI may cause the data to be e-mailed to you, or it may present 
the data in a text file in an easy-to-read format.
Optionally, you can also create a CGI program that prompts your server to 
send users to a web page acknowledging that you received the information 
and thanking them for their feedback. This is a nice touch that your custom­
ers are sure to appreciate.
	
Writing the scripts that process form data is definitely the province of web­
masters or computer programmers and is far beyond the scope of this book. 
But you don’t have to hire someone to write the scripts: You can use a web 
page program (such as Microsoft Expression Web or Adobe Dreamweaver) 
that not only helps you create a form, but also provides you with scripts that 
process the data for you.
	
Some clever businesspeople have created really useful web content by provid­
ing a way for nonprogrammers, such as you and me, to create forms online. 
Appropriately enough, you connect to the server’s website and fill out a form 
provided by the service to create your form. The form has a built-in CGI that 
processes the data and e-mails it to you.
Using Expression Web to create a form
You can use Microsoft Expression Web to create the data-entry parts of 
forms, such as text boxes and check boxes. You can then link your form to 
a behind-the-scenes script that processes form data, such as the popular 
FormMail program provided free online by Matt Wright in Matt’s Script 
Archive (www.scriptarchive.com/formmail.html). Creating your own 
form gives you more control over how it looks and a greater degree of inde­
pendence than if you use a ready-made forms service.
	
You don’t have to look far to find FormMail. It’s popular enough that many 
web hosts provide it on their web servers. I found it already up and running 
on mine. All I had to do was “point” the form to the script to process the data 
and send it to myself in an e-mail message.
The first step in setting up a web page form is determining what information 
you want to receive from someone who fills out the form. Your web page cre­
ation tool then gives you options to ask for the information you want. Start 
Expression Web and open the Toolbox by selecting Toolbox from the Task 
Panes menu. When the Toolbox opens, click the plus sign (+) next to Form 
Controls. Drag the form object into the page at the spot where you want the 
form to appear. The Toolbox also gives you a selection of the most commonly 
used options, including

211
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
	
✓	Text Box: Creates a single-line box in which someone can type text
	
✓	Text Area: Creates a scrolling text box
	
✓	File Upload: Lets the user send you a text file
	
✓	Check Box: Creates a check box
	
✓	Input (Radio): Creates an option (radio) button
	
✓	Drop-Down Box: Lets you create a drop-down list
	
✓	Picture: Lets you add a graphic image to a form
Figure 8-4 shows the most common form fields as they appear in a web page 
form that you’re creating.
When you add the form control to a page you’re designing, Expression Web 
inserts a dashed, marquee-style box in your document to signify that you’re 
working on web page form fields rather than normal web page text.
	
You can download Microsoft Expression Web at www.microsoft.com/
en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24739.

Adding the personal touch that means so much
Sarah-Lou Morris started her business out of an apartment in London, England, in 1997. She devel­
oped an herbal insect repellent — Alfresco — while working in a botanical and herbal research 
center. Since then, sales have grown quickly, often doubling each year. One key to Morris’s quick 
success is her personal approach to serving her customers, who include movie stars on location 
and other prominent entertainers such as Sir Paul McCartney.
Morris describes her website and operation (www.alfrescoshop.com), shown in the accom­
panying figure, as “an extremely lively business . . . an ever-growing, 24/7-demanding teenager 
that could easily drain my resources if I didn’t keep a very tight shop.” Over the years, she stuck to 
basic business practices and focused on cultivating the customer base she had already developed 
through selling her product by word of mouth. (The trendy term for this type of publicity is viral 
marketing; see Chapter 10 for more on this topic.) She started a fan club for Alfresco, and she has 
personally visited some of her best customers. Today, she is expanding her marketing to include 
social networks and is creating a new product line to reach younger customers.
Q. How have you been able to keep a steady flow of business amid the ups and downs of the world 
economy?
A. We have built a bigger and bigger customer base by constantly giving good service to custom­
ers. We send out special editions for frequent buyers, have a fan club, and encourage customers to 
make recommendations. We listen to our customers — why wouldn’t we? Our site could be more 
automated, making it easier for us to run, but we’d lose the personal touch. It’s still rewarding, and 

213
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
I think profitable in the long term, to take a phone call or e-mail from some VIP in Rome or a badly 
bitten Chinese customer wanting quickly to buy what a friend just bought. The effort is still geared 
toward turning the products into a worldwide addiction-by-Internet.
I’m launching a new kids’ product, Alfrescokids, that will bring in a new customer age range includ­
ing young mums and dads, and young families. I decided to turn the concept of “insect repellent” 
on its head and make the theme for the site “attracting and preserving bugs” as they are part of our 
food chain. I have gathered good insect-related content and am hoping both children and adults 
will always think of our site as fun and contemporary.
Q. What are the one or two of the most important things people should keep in mind if they’re start­
ing an online business these days?
A. It isn’t necessary to spend fortunes setting it up. Find a host that has been in business a number 
of years. (There are experts now.) A clean database that really works for you is vital because your 
customers are the most precious things a business can have. Keep in touch with them. Treat them 
with care and respect.
Q. What new approaches are you using to reach your customers?
A. Attracting the interest of search engines is a priority. We have spent enormous time researching 
our competition as well as the keywords people search for. And we are making sure we are sincere 
in our ethics. It’s important to write intelligently about your products and services in a truthful and 
interesting way. Search engine robots wander about sites sifting the “worthwhile” from the “not 
so.” If you don’t spend time working on getting across clearly and precisely what is being sold, 
Google Robots will put you at the bottom of the pile.
I realize that including blogs, Twitter posts, newsletters, et al. is going to mean our staff will be extra 
busy. I have a website that attracts worldwide attention and I am very pleased to put on a good 
show. Most important is our customers’ recommendations and word of mouth. Our Fan Club now 
enables lots of banter and travel tips, with offers and goodies from all kinds of areas.
Q. What’s the single best improvement you’ve made to your site to attract more customers or retain 
the ones you’ve had?
A. Putting on a special code that only special customers or fan club members can access for discounts 
and so on. For example, Royal Bank of Scotland employees have a special code dedicated to them.
Q. Is this a good time to start an online business?
A. It’s a great time to start an e-commerce biz for a number of reasons, not the least being that 
the technical support is now well and truly in place. Let’s just say more people know what they’re 
doing than in earlier years. Secondly, most new customers aren’t as concerned about credit card 
security, as there really has been hardly any fraud.
Q. What advice would you give to someone thinking of starting a new business on the Web?
A. Your customer is king, queen, prince, and princess. Whatever you would like yourself is what you 
should aim to offer. “Do as you would like to be done by” should be your motto. Expose yourself any 
which way and as often as is acceptable to as many well-targeted customers as possible. Most of 
all, keep a positive attitude. Sir Paul McCartney once said to me when I felt depressed and almost 
ready to give up, “Always have faith.” I’m glad I listened to him!

214
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Making Customers Feel They Belong
In the old days, people went to the market often, sometimes daily. The shop­
keeper often set aside items for a customer’s consideration based on individ­
ual tastes and needs. More likely than not, the business transaction followed 
a discussion of families, politics, and neighborhood gossip.
Good customer service can make your customers feel like members of a com­
munity who frequent a mom-and-pop store on the corner of their block — the 
community of satisfied individuals who regularly use your goods and ser­
vices. In the following sections, I describe some ways to make your custom­
ers feel like members of a group who return to your site on a regular basis to 
interact with a community of individuals with similar interests.
Putting the “person” into personal service
How often does an employee personally greet you when you walk through 
the door of a store? On the web as well as in real life, people like a prompt 
and personal response. Your challenge is to provide live customer support 
on your website.
Some websites do provide live support so that people can e-mail a question 
to someone in real time (or close to real time) by using Internet technologies, 
such as chat and message boards. The online auction giant eBay has a New 
to eBay message board, for example, where beginners can post questions for 
eBay support staff, who post answers in response.
Chat, in which individuals type messages to one another over the Internet in 
real time, provides an even more immediate type of customer support. One 
way to add chat to your site is to start a Yahoo! Group, which I describe in 
the “Starting a Yahoo! Group” section, later in this chapter.
LivePerson (www.liveperson.com) provides a simpler alternative that 
allows small businesses to provide chat-based support. LivePerson is soft­
ware that enables you to see who is connected to your site at any time and 
instantly lets you chat with them, just as if you’re greeting them at the front 
door of a brick-and-mortar store.
LivePerson works like this: You install the LivePerson Pro software on your 
own computer (not the server that runs your site). With LivePerson, you or 
your assistants can lead the customer through the process of making a pur­
chase. For instance, you might show customers what individual sale items 
look like by sending them an image file to view with their web browsers. You 
can try LivePerson Pro for free for 30 days and then pay $99.99 per month 
thereafter.

215
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
Overcoming business barriers
You’re probably familiar with terms such as global village and international 
marketplace. But how do you extend your reach into the huge overseas mar­
kets? It’s important to describe your products clearly and objectively, with 
words as well as images and diagrams, where necessary. You can effectively 
overcome language and cultural barriers in other ways, some of which are 
common sense while others are less obvious.
Shoppers in many developing nations still prefer to shop with their five senses. 
So that foreign customers never have a question on how to proceed, it’s 
essential to provide them with explicit descriptions of the shopping process. 
Make information on ordering, payment, execution, and support available at 
every step.
Customer support in Asia is, in many ways, a different creature from in the 
West. Although personalization still remains critical, language and translation 
give an e-commerce site a different feel. A Western site that might work well 
by looking clean and well organized might have to be replaced with the more 
chaotic blitz of characters and options that’s often found more compelling 
by Eastern markets. In Asia, websites tend to place more emphasis on color 
and interactivity. Many e-commerce destinations choose to dump all possible 
options on the front page instead of presenting them in an orderly, sequential 
flow.
Enhancing your site with a discussion area
Can we talk? Even my pet birds like to communicate by words as well as 
squawks. A small business can turn its individual customers into a cohe­
sive group by starting its own discussion group on the Internet. Discussion 
groups work particularly well if you’re promoting a specific type of product 
or if you and your customers are involved in a controversial area of interest.
The three kinds of discussion groups are
	
✓	A local group: Some universities create discussion areas exclusively 
for their students. Other large companies set aside groups that are 
restricted to their employees. Outsiders can’t gain access because the 
groups aren’t on the Internet but rather are on a local server within the 
organization.
	
✓	A Usenet newsgroup: Individuals are allowed to create an Internet-wide 
discussion group in the alt or biz categories of Usenet without having 
to go through the time-consuming application and approval process 
needed to create other newsgroups. Although Usenet was originally one 
of the most popular parts of the Internet, my sense is that web-based 

216
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
groups such as Google Groups (https://groups.google.com) are 
more frequently used these days.
	
✓	A web-based discussion group: You can start a Yahoo! Group, which I 
describe in the upcoming section named (surprise!) “Starting a Yahoo! 
Group.”
Of these three alternatives, the first isn’t appropriate for your business purposes. 
So what follows focuses on the last two types of groups.
	
In addition to newsgroups, many large corporations host interactive chats 
moderated by experts on subjects related to their areas of business. Small 
businesses can also hold chats, most easily by setting up a chat room on a site 
that hosts chat-based discussions. However, the most common way to build 
goodwill and establish new connections with customers and interested parties 
is an interactive web-based diary — a blog (short for web log). Find out more 
about blogs in Chapter 1.
Starting an alt discussion group
Usenet is a system of communication on the Internet that enables individual 
computer users to participate in group discussions about topics of mutual 
interest. Internet newsgroups have what’s referred to as a hierarchical struc­
ture. Most groups belong to one of seven main categories: comp, misc, news, 
rec, sci, soc, or talk. The category name appears at the beginning of the 
group’s name, such as rec.food.drink.coffee. In this section, I discuss 
the alt category, which is just about as popular as the seven other categories 
and enables individuals to establish their own newsgroups.
In my opinion, the biz discussion groups aren’t taken seriously because 
they’re widely populated by unscrupulous people promoting get-rich-quick 
schemes and egomaniacs who love the sound of their own voices. The alt 
groups, although they can certainly address some wild and crazy topics, 
often address serious topics and are at least as well known as the seven main 
categories mentioned above. Plus the process of setting up an alt group is 
well documented.
The prefix alt didn’t originally stand for alternative, although it has come 
to mean that. The term was an abbreviation for Anarchists, Lunatics, and 
Terrorists, which wasn’t so politically incorrect back when newsgroups were 
young. Now alt is a catch-all category in which anyone can start a group, if 
others show interest in the creator’s proposal.
The first step to creating your own alt discussion group is to point your web 
browser to Google Groups (https://groups.google.com) and access the 
alt.config.newgroups group. This area contains general instructions on 
starting your own Usenet newsgroup. Also look in news.answers for the 
How to Start a New Usenet Newsgroup message.

217
 Chapter 8: Communicating with Customers and Building Loyalty
To find out how to start a group in the alt category, go to Google (www.
google.com) click Groups, and search for the How to Start an Alt 
Newsgroup message. Follow the instructions to set up your own discussion 
group. Basically, the process involves the following steps:
	
1.	Write a brief proposal describing the purpose of the group you want 
to create and include an e-mail address where people can respond 
with comments.
	
	 The proposal also contains the name of your group in the correct form 
(alt.groupname.moreinfo.moreinfo). Try to keep the group name 
short and professional if it’s for business purposes.
	
2.	Submit the proposal to the newsgroup alt.config.
	
3.	Gather feedback to your proposal through e-mail.
	
4.	Send a special message, or a control message, to the news server that 
gives you access to Usenet.
	
	 The exact form of the message varies from server to server, so consult 
with your ISP on how to compose the message correctly.
	
5.	Wait a while (a few days or weeks) as news administrators (the 
people who operate news servers at ISPs around the world) decide 
whether to adopt your request and add your group to their list of 
newsgroups.
	
Before you try to start your own group, look through the seven categories 
(comp, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, and talk) to make sure someone else isn’t 
already covering your topic.
Starting a Yahoo! Group
When the Internet was still fresh and new, Usenet was almost the only game 
in town. These days, the web is pretty much (along with e-mail) the most 
popular way to communicate and share information. That’s why starting a 
discussion group on the web makes perfect sense. A web-based discussion 
group is somewhat less intimidating than others because it doesn’t require a 
participant to use newsgroup software.
Yahoo! Groups are absolutely free to set up. (To find out how, just go to the 
FAQ page, help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&page=product&
y=PROD_GR; click Create and Manage Groups; and click the How to Start a New 
Yahoo! Group link.) They enable users not only to exchange messages, but also 
to communicate in real time by using chat. And as the list operator, you can 
send e-mail newsletters and other messages to your participants.
	
Simply operating an online store isn’t enough. You need to present yourself 
as an authority in a particular area of interest. The discussion group needs 
to concern itself primarily with that topic and give participants a chance to 
exchange views and tips on the topic. If people have questions about your 

218
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
store, they can always e-mail you directly — they don’t need a discussion 
group to do that.
Moving to customer service 2.0
Once you’ve covered the basics, you can make your online business really 
responsive to your clientele by adopting some approaches that might be 
described as “Customer Service 2.0.” There’s nothing dramatically new here. 
You’re taking the basics and being proactive about them by monitoring your 
reputation, looking for any negative comments, and responding to issues 
immediately.
An article in Computerworld (www.computerworld.com/s/article/
9090398/Customer_Service_2.0_Clients_become_brand_managers) 
describes how big businesses are doing 2.0. Comcast, for example, was able 
to respond to a single post on a microblog about a service outage within 15 
minutes because it has people dedicated to looking for such comments and 
complaints online.
One aspect of “new” customer service is actively looking for potential problems 
and heading them off before they become big issues. It might mean creating 
a comment area or discussion feature as mentioned in the preceding section 
so customers can complain directly to you, and having someone dedicated to 
monitoring for such comments and arranging for responses. Comcast created 
a Comcast Cares program that watches for comments on Twitter about its 
service.
An art and decorating site called The Artful Home, based in Madison, Wisconsin, 
responds to customer comments gathered by Networked Insights (www.
networkedinsights.com), which gathers customer data from social net­
working sites and other locations to analyze how a brand is being received.
Suppose you’re just a one- or two-person operation and you don’t have the 
resources to hire a company to monitor what people are saying about you on 
Twitter or other sites. Just Google your own business name periodically to 
see what’s being said, or search Twitter or other sites.
	
A field called “reputation management” helps businesses keep track of what’s 
being said about them online. You can get an overview of the topic at www.

I

 occasionally get questions from budding entrepreneurs just like you who 
are wondering how to get started selling online. The question that comes up 
most often is simple: “What should I sell online?” A variation on this question 
that I hear almost as frequently goes like this: “What’s the single best thing I 
can possibly sell online?” (Translation: “What can I sell on the web that will 
make me the most money?”)
Everyone who asks this question wants a simple answer, and so do you. But 
no single item sells better than anything else on the web. Rather, people are 
hunting for thousands of things while they stare at their laptops and desktop 
computers. Your challenge is to find a connection between one of those things 
and you: You need to find something that’s desirable that (1) you can find easily 
and inexpensively, (2) you’re interested in, and (3) is easy to photograph, pack, 
and ship.
The list of desirable items changes all the time as new products catch the 
fancy of consumers. As I write this, the “hot” items are those with an i in 
front of their names (iPhone 5, iPad, iPad mini) and the Samsung Galaxy line 
of products. No matter what the hot item is, you want to find something that 
consumers want and that you can sell for a profit. Sites such as Alibaba (www.
alibaba.com) make sourcing in China more feasible to small businesses and 

220
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
individual sellers, too. This chapter describes your options for finding such 
merchandise in a steady supply and presenting it in a way that will cause web 
surfers to click your Buy button.
Knowing What Sells Well Online
My first job was as a clerk in my neighborhood pharmacy. Much of my time 
was spent on the look of the store and the merchandise in it, whether that 
involved cleaning, arranging items on shelves, creating signs, or rearrang­
ing window presentations. All traditional brick-and-mortar store owners 
take care to show off their merchandise in a way that attracts attention. You 
should do the same, even though you’re dealing in clicks rather than bricks. 
This isn’t a complicated subject. The section that follows examines one basic 
aspect of a good online sales presentation: choosing desirable merchandise. 
See Chapter 6 for the other: presenting it in its best light.
These are the kind of sales approaches that apply, whether you’re selling on 
a website, putting an ad on Craigslist, or setting up a storefront in a market­
place such as ArtFire (www.artfire.com) or Etsy (www.etsy.com) — or all 
of these.
It’s hard to predict what kinds of items can attract good profits. But if you 
can think of a hot product that’s in short supply, you can realize such profits 
yourself. On a much smaller scale, I’m amazed to find merchandise that sold 
on eBay for far more than I paid for it. Here are a few examples:
	
✓	I found a pair of women’s ballet-style slippers by designer Taryn Rose 
secondhand for $2 and sold them for $132. (I don’t have an image of 
these slippers, but Figure 9-1 shows a pair of sandals by the same 
designer that I bought for $4 and sold for $51.)
	
✓	I sold a Cedar electronic device, a “de-clicker” for cleaning up audio files, 
for my brother for $1,500.
	
✓	My mother bought a set of antique wooden-shafted Spalding golf clubs 
for $10, and I sold them for more than $100.
Does a common thread run through these tales? Two threads, actually. You 
need to look for merchandise that’s desirable, that’s in new or near-new con­
dition, and that is either difficult to find or sells for a high amount to begin 
with. The Cedar device normally sells for several thousand dollars; the ballet 
slippers sell at retail for $335; the golf clubs are hard to find because they’re 
antique. Online shoppers, in fact, typically flock to two kinds of merchandise:
	
✓	Things that are rare and unusual
	
✓	Things that are very expensive when sold at retail

221
 Chapter 9: Sourcing Worldwide for Your Business
	
Figure 9-1: 
Shoppers 
online crave 
either a 
bargain or a 
rare find.
	
They’re looking on the web either to find something they’d have trouble locat­
ing anywhere else or to find something at a much lower price than they’d pay 
anywhere else. Some enterprising sellers can deal in a variety of rare and desir­
able items. However, the majority of successful online entrepreneurs build 
their business by settling on a reliable source of desirable merchandise that 
they can buy in quantity from a wholesale supplier. They realize much slimmer 
profit margins than they might get from rare antiques. But they can sell a more-
or-less predictable quantity of items each month, and what they don’t get in 
profits, they make up for in the quantity and reliability of sales.
Finding Products Yourself
One of the many nice things about running an online business is the extent 
to which you can perform important functions no matter what your level of 
experience. However, this is both a blessing and a curse. Finding merchan­
dise to sell is something you have to do on your own, for the most part — yet 
it’s a subject that takes experienced retailers years to figure out. It can be 
a matter of trial and error, and it can be time-consuming and difficult. But if 
you succeed with the central objective — finding a steady and reliable source 
for merchandise you can resell online at a profit — you’ve taken a huge step 
toward making your online business a success. I describe the most common 
options for do-it-yourself sourcing in the following sections.

222
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
Cleaning out your closets
Time and again, I interview successful online merchants (especially those 
who make a living selling on eBay) who began by selling what they found at 
hand. This kind of online commerce, in fact, is most practical when you’re 
trying to sell on eBay: You start by cleaning your closets, attic, garage, and 
other storage areas. It’s a sort of online garage sale: You get started and whet 
your appetite for future sales. Rummaging through your closets only takes 
you so far, though.
	
eBay isn’t the only online marketplace for closet cleaners. If you find textbooks, 
CDs, DVDs, or other common household items, you can add them to Amazon.
com’s marketplace. Your items appear alongside the same items offered for 
sale by “Earth’s Biggest Bookstore.” Selling in the marketplace is easier and 
quicker than on eBay; you don’t even have to take photos. Find out more 
about Amazon.com and other specialty book marketplaces like Alibris in 
Chapter 15.
As a general rule, I tell budding sellers not to take a scattershot approach to 
sourcing and to avoid selling anything and everything. But in the beginning, 
when your primary goal is to clean out your house and make a few extra dol­
lars, this approach has an advantage. When you’re selling lots of different 
things, you might just discover one thing that interests you that you can sell 
in greater quantity. I know one eBay seller (a male, by the way) who sold a 
purse he found in his closet. It fetched a huge profit. He realized that certain 
brands of designer purses are eagerly sought on eBay. He has since gone on 
to become a leading seller of women’s purses, items he’s never actually used.
Outsourcing your sourcing
Your closets are cleaned out; your attic is bare; you don’t have a valuable 
antique to your name. How can you find merchandise to sell on the web when 
you don’t have anything of your own to start with? You sell other peoples’ 
merchandise, that’s how. In other words, you become a consignment seller — 
someone who puts items up for sale on behalf of the owner, who has given 
(or consigned) them to you to sell. This phenomenon is eBay-centric. In fact, 
finding eBay sellers who sell on behalf of friends, relatives, or total strangers 
is pretty common. I’ve never encountered a businessperson who sells on 
consignment through a website. The following sections, then, apply to eBay 
sellers, though they might be relevant to website or brick-and-mortar store 
owners as well.
	
Somewhere in the world, a consignment seller probably sells through a con­
ventional e-commerce website rather than an auction venue. But there are 
well-known consignment sellers who operate their own websites. The top 
dog among eBay trading assistants for many years, Adam Hersh, had his own 

223
 Chapter 9: Sourcing Worldwide for Your Business
website (www.adamhershauctions.com), which included a link to his eBay 
Store. (See the sidebar for more about Hersh.) As a consignment seller, you 
need to market and present yourself as effectively as people who are selling 
their own merchandise directly to customers.
Becoming a trading assistant
I’m using the term trading assistant loosely to refer to anyone who sells mer­
chandise on eBay on behalf of the owners of the merchandise. The owner 
gets most of the profits; the seller earns a fee and does the work of pho­
tographing, listing, packing, and shipping the goods. Lots of eBay sellers 
occasionally peddle objects given to them by friends and family. eBay uses 
the term trading assistant (TA) to designate someone approved by eBay to 
conduct consignment sales and who is listed in eBay’s Trading Assistant 
Directory (pages.ebay.com/tahub/index.html). In other words, you can 
become either an informal trading assistant or a formally designated one.
To become an informal trading assistant, you only have to find people who 
want to sell on eBay but who are unwilling to go through the work involved 
in conducting actual transactions. Chances are they’ll find you and you won’t 
have to do much asking around. When word gets out that you’re selling on 
eBay, you may well find that people come to you with boxes full of memen­
toes. You can also find clients by posting notices in your neighborhood 
stores or on your local version of Craigslist (www.craigslist.org), the 
popular classified-ad service.
The advantage of taking on consignment sales is the ability to boost your 
feedback and your monthly gross sales figures in a relatively short amount 
of time. On eBay, a user’s feedback rating is very important. Feedback is a 
numeric measurement of the comments left for you by people with whom 
you’ve done business. Someone who is satisfied with your performance as 
a buyer or seller can leave a positive feedback comment, which counts for 
1 point. A negative comment counts for –1 point, and a neutral comment 
counts as 0 (zero). eBay sellers generally find that their sales go up if their 
feedback rating reaches into the hundreds, if they have good Detailed Seller 
Ratings (DSRs), which are given anonymously by buyers, and if they can 
achieve a Top Rated Seller or PowerSeller designation.
A PowerSeller has at least $3,000 in annual sales to U.S. buyers and 100 annual 
transactions; DSRs of at least 4.60; a 98 percent positive feedback rating over 
the past year; and a good standing record as a seller. Top-Rated Sellers must 
have a positive feedback rating of at least 100 percent, at least 100 transac­
tions and $1,000 in sales with U.S. buyers in the past year, and send package 
tracking to their buyers. 
By turning around a substantial number of transactions for other people in a 
short amount of time and shipping quickly, you can build both your feedback 
rating and your potential as a Top-Rated Seller or PowerSeller. You can make 
some extra money, to boot. (The merchandise is sold under your User ID, 

224
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
and buyers don’t need to know that their objects belonged to someone other 
than you.) Find out more about the criteria at http://pages.ebay.com/
sellerinformation/sellingresources/powerseller_requirements.
html. Top-Rated Seller requirements are listed at http://pages.ebay.
com/help/sell/top-rated.html#what.
Just how much money can you make? That depends on your time and energy. 
Whether you’re a formally designated TA or an informal consignment seller, 
you get to set your own payment terms. It’s wise to look around eBay’s 
Trading Assistant Directory to see what others are charging. The terms vary 
widely. Some TAs buy their customers’ items outright and put them up for 
sale; others charge a flat fee of $10 per sale; most charge a fee for shipping 
and handling and a percentage of the sale price (perhaps 40–50 percent).
Young trading assistant: No inventory, no worries
What do you do when you’re too young to have 
a storehouse of antiques and collectibles you 
can sell on eBay? You invite the owners of those 
valuable items to come to you, and you offer to 
sell them on eBay on their behalf. That’s what 
Adam Hersh decided to do when he was a com­
munications major at Northeastern University. 
“At the time, I had no idea what I was going 
to do with my life. Then I started taking night 
classes so I could be certified in e-commerce.” 
(He was still in college and didn’t have venture 
capital funding or funds from previous occupa­
tions.) “I said to myself, I can either buy or resell 
slowly or find another way to get inventory. I 
started as a trading assistant because it was 
a free way to have thousands of sales items at 
the same time.”
In 2001, Hersh became an eBay trading assis­
tant before there was a formal entity by that 
name. (eBay now has a program through which 
it certifies such sellers, as described earlier in 
this chapter.) Although he was a pioneer in the 
field, Hersh already had a history of entrepre­
neurship. At age 12, he formed a corporation 
buying and selling baseball cards. He later did 
nightclub and concert promotions.
As a trading assistant, Hersh handled auction 
sales for some big-name entities, including 
MTV, Viacom, and the government of South 
Korea. He ran a charity auction for the New 
York Public Library. “When I met with the South 
Korean government, they were satisfied with 
my presentation, but they flat-out told me, ‘I 
can’t believe how young you are.’”
Hersh acknowledged that being a trading assis­
tant can be more difficult and complex than 
selling for himself. “It is difficult, but it works 
well if you learn how to perfect it,” he says. “If 
you perfect something that is difficult, you can 
be at the top.”
At this writing, Hersh is around 33 years old. His 
company was acquired at age 28, and acquired 
for a second time at age 33 by Gotham City 
Online. He is still an officer of the Professional 
eBay Sellers Association (PeSA) and is one of 
the few people to have made 1 million transac­
tions on eBay.

225
 Chapter 9: Sourcing Worldwide for Your Business
To find out more about the program, go to the Trading Assistants Program 
page (pages.ebay.com/tahub/index.html). To join the program, you 
need to have a feedback score of more than 100, have at least 98 percent 
positive feedback comments, have sold at least 10 items in the past three 
months, and maintain 10 sales per three-month period. After you’re a TA, you 
can create a profile about yourself and your area of interest, which is then 
included in a searchable database of such sellers.
Running a drop-off store
A few enterprising eBay sellers have taken consignment selling to a new 
level and opened brick-and-mortar outlets called Registered eBay Drop Off 
Locations (REDOLs). This is a big step that you should attempt only if you’re 
an experienced PowerSeller and have a steady sales stream to cover the 
slowdowns and complications you’ll inevitably encounter from opening a real 
physical store. On the other hand, with a physical location, you have lots of 
storage, a loading dock, and a location where wholesalers can ship to you. 
Depending on the location you choose, customers find you in the form of foot 
traffic. Choosing a good location (at an intersection, on a main street, or in 
a strip mall with plenty of parking) is only one consideration. Here are some 
others:
	
✓	You need lots of storage space to handle the increased sales volume 
you’ll experience.
	
✓	You need to know how to say no to people whose merchandise just won’t 
attract bids (or high-enough bids; you might want to set a minimum of $50 
per sale).
	
✓	You need a computer network for your employees and possibly for 
customers who need to see the same search results you’re conducting.
Some drop-off store owners used to get a jump start by signing up for a fran­
chise with one of the big chains, such as iSOLD It, although today many of 
those franchise chains no longer exist. But drop-off stores are risky whether 
you open your own from scratch or join a franchise. I once interviewed a 
drop-off store owner in northwest Illinois who grew tired of the complaints, 
nonpaying bidders, and expenses associated with running a brick-and-mortar 
store. He bought a signmaking machine from a customer and decided to try 
his hand at that. The last I heard, he was enjoying making signs even more 
than he had liked selling on eBay.
Garage sales and flea markets
Garage sales and flea markets are the traditional ways to start selling, on 
eBay or Amazon.com, at least. You scrounge through your neighborhood 

226
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
garage sales, estate sales, house sales, rummage sales, and flea markets. You 
pick up some goodies at a bargain and put them up for sale. I know some 
PowerSellers who still get their merchandise this way. I’m thinking of a hus­
band-and-wife team who sell on eBay under the User ID mrmodern. At this 
writing, their feedback rating is more than 9,900.
They don’t waste their time with small-scale garage sales. Rather, they pick 
out big estate sales with care, and they show up before the sun rises so that 
they can be among the first in line. (Some sellers also pay students to wait 
in line for them until just before the sale opens.) Then they practically run 
through the sale, grabbing items that seem valuable in a frenzy, trying to beat 
the competition. This is a perfectly viable way to run an eBay business — for 
some people, though not for me. If you’re an incurable bargain hunter and you 
love the thrill of the hunt — and you have lots of time to spend — start looking 
in your local paper or online at sites like Craigslist for sales in your area.
	
A smartphone app called Garage Sale Rover helps you locate garage and 
estate sales in your area, no matter what the time of year. It’s available for iOS 
and Android; search for it in iTunes and Google Play.
Secondhand stores
Everyone has a thrift store, dollar store, or other secondhand shop in the 
immediate vicinity. These can be good sources of merchandise, provided 
that you can go there during the day when new stock is put out and competi­
tion is low. You have to be prepared to spend lots of time driving or walking 
from one venue to another, and you have to enjoy the hunt. Personally, I love 
the search and the thrill of discovering something that’s like a hidden trea­
sure. But I realize that for most sellers, finding a reliable wholesale supplier is 
a more practical option that carries lower stress with it as well.
Working with Wholesale Suppliers
Secondhand stores (such as those mentioned in the preceding section) are, 
in fact, wholesale suppliers. Getting to know the proprietors of your second­
hand stores is a good idea; you can strike up relationships and let the owners 
know what you’re looking for. If you’re lucky, you might find they put aside 
items you want because they value your repeat business. These aren’t the 
only kinds of wholesalers around, however. I give you some tips for finding 
and working with other sorts of suppliers in the following sections.

227
 Chapter 9: Sourcing Worldwide for Your Business
Finding wholesalers
If good wholesale suppliers were easy to find, everyone would use them. But 
finding good suppliers takes time and effort. One problem is that wholesalers 
don’t advertise themselves in the places you’re used to looking. Another is 
that they tend to want to deal with traditional, brick-and-mortar businesses. 
Some wholesalers look down on eBay or e-commerce sellers. They still don’t 
understand that the web is a legitimate marketplace.
What can you do to overcome these challenges? Other sellers have done the 
following:
	
✓	Rented a booth in an antiques mall and used that as a business address 
so that wholesalers could ship merchandise there
	
✓	Listed themselves in the phone book for added credibility
	
✓	Had a tax ID and a business license ready in case these items are 
requested
To find wholesalers, look around. The web is the logical place to start. The 
Chinese wholesale marketplace Alibaba (www.alibaba.com) is an increas­
ingly popular venue for sellers seeking merchandise. Another possibility is on 
eBay through the sales category Wholesale Lots. Another excellent resource is 
Worldwide Brands (www.worldwidebrands.com), which maintains a database 
of wholesale suppliers organized by the type of merchandise they provide.
But ask around, too. Often, you find wholesalers by word of mouth. Sometimes, 
you find products you like and that you’re reasonably sure you can sell online. 
Going directly to the manufacturers is worth a try, but chances are the manu­
facturer won’t sell directly to you. I tried this once. I frequently sell a desirable 
line of high-end shoes for men that’s manufactured in Wisconsin. When I called 
the company and talked to a sales rep, I was politely rebuffed. Producers are 
used to selling to wholesalers and not directly to eBay sellers. By selling to you 
at wholesale, they undercut their wholesalers as well as the retailers who sell 
their products to the public. You’re much better off approaching the wholesalers.
Lots of online businesses advertise themselves as wholesale sellers. Many 
say they drop-ship their merchandise — in other words, they ship what’s 
purchased directly from their wholesale facility so they never actually have 
to handle the merchandise and may never see it.
Sound too good to be true? In many cases it is, and you should always exercise 
a healthy dose of caution when you’re looking for wholesale suppliers. The 
eBay sellers I’ve talked to who have faithful, reliable wholesalers guard the 
identities of those suppliers jealously. They usually find such suppliers only 
by word of mouth: Rather than answer an ad or visit a website, they ask 
someone who knows someone who . . . you get the idea.

228
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
If you aren’t in the business of selling goods or services that you manufacture 
yourself, find a steady stream of merchandise that you can sell online. Your 
goal is to find a wholesaler who can supply you with good-quality items at 
rock-bottom prices. You can then mark up the prices and make a profit while 
keeping the prices low enough to make them attractive. Generally, the best 
wholesale items are small objects that can be packed and shipped inexpen­
sively. On eBay, things like figurines, ornaments, stationery, and other small 
gift items are commonly sold by PowerSellers along with the occasional 
antiques and collectibles. Here are a few rules for finding items to resell:
	
✓	Try them out yourself. Purchase a few items yourself to start with or 
ask the wholesaler for samples. (Resist any attempts by the wholesaler 
to sell you, say, 10,000 items at a supposedly dirt-cheap price right off 
the bat.) Take a few of the items for a test drive. It’s easier to convince 
others to buy what you like yourself.
	
✓	Try to sell many small, low-priced items rather than a few large ones. 
Rather than computers or printers, consider selling computer memory 
chips or printer ink cartridges, for example.
	
✓	Ask for references. Talk to businesspeople who have already worked 
with the supplier. Ask how reliable the supplier is and whether the 
prices are prone to fluctuate.
Giving your business a tax ID
Proper documentation is essential to ensure 
that wholesalers and other suppliers take your 
fledgling business seriously. One of the most 
important pieces of documentation you can 
provide them is a tax ID. Another is a business 
license. In either case, you need to apply to the 
proper authorities to obtain the designation. 
You may need to obtain a business license from 
your city, county, or state agency.
A tax ID tells a tax agency that you collect 
sales tax. That tax agency might be your state 
tax department or the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). To get a tax ID (or Employer Identification 
Number, or EIN), fill out a form designated for 
that purpose. To get one from the IRS, go to 
www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-
Businesses-&-Self-Employed/
Employer-ID-Numbers-(EINs)-. To 
get one from the state, contact your state’s tax 
department.
You then need to turn over the sales tax you 
collect to your state. When the state sends you 
the forms needed for this purpose, your tax ID 
number (this might also be called your Business 
Tax ID or your Employer Identification Number, 
or EIN) is somewhere on the form. This is the 
number you can supply to wholesalers.
You can find a page full of links to 
state departments of revenue, where 
you can apply for a state tax ID, at

StatesDepartmentsofRevenue.aspx.

229
 Chapter 9: Sourcing Worldwide for Your Business
When looking for merchandise to sell, try to build on your own hobbies and 
interests. If you collect model cars, try to develop a sideline selling parts, 
paints, and components online. You’ll find the process more enjoyable when 
you deal in products you love and know well.
Approaching wholesalers
When you approach wholesalers, it helps to have a business address and a 
phone number dedicated to your business. Little things, such as an answering 
service or an assistant to answer your phone, can make a good impression on 
suppliers who aren’t yet on board with the idea of individual entrepreneurs 
working at home and imagine them padding around their computer-laden 
offices in their bathrobe and slippers.
When you first talk to a wholesaler, don’t immediately mention that you’re 
creating your first website or that you’re starting to sell on eBay and are 
hoping to build your feedback rating. Tell the sales rep your business name, 
your tax ID, and your address and then tell him or her what you’re interested 
in doing. If the words e-commerce and eBay never come up in the conversation, 
so much the better. If they do, don’t apologize for wanting to sell online: Be 
confident and straightforward. If the wholesaler is skeptical and doesn’t want 
to sell to you, just move on to the next supply candidate.
Your first purchase from a wholesaler should be a small trial run. Tell the 
wholesaler you want to buy a small quantity of what he or she offers to see 
what sells best. When you make a real purchase from a wholesaler, you’ll 
have to buy a much larger quantity. You might have to take out a home-
equity loan or otherwise borrow to cover the initial cost, if you don’t have 
funds to begin with.
Turning to the Far East: Alibaba, 
brokers, and more
China is known worldwide as a supplier of cheap consumer goods, and online 
sellers big and small are turning to China as an option for finding merchandise 
to resell at a profit. As you might expect, there are some potential pitfalls to 
keep in mind when you turn your attention to the Far East and some special 
considerations that don’t come into play when you are dealing with a whole­
saler in the United States or in your own home country.
First, keep in mind that a number of trade laws apply. You have to fill out 
forms to meet your import and export requirements. You have to pay duty 
and customs fees as well.

But you need to keep some subtler issues in mind as well. For starters, you 
are hardly the first person to think about approaching the Chinese to buy 
wholesale. Many big-time sellers, including some of the biggest PowerSellers 
on eBay, have already been there. According to one of them, John Jacobs, a 
longtime seller on eBay and now CEO of ArtFire (www.artfire.com), China 
tends to give preferential treatment to bigger sellers. “Typically, when you 
buy from China, you find that the profit margins are higher the more you 
buy,” he says. In other words, the more you buy, the lower the price you’re 
charged.
How do you compete with the big sellers? You have several options:
	
✓	Make a personal appearance. If you can go to China and meet factory 
owners yourself, the personal connection will help. That’s what one 
eBay PowerSeller, Alan Warshauer, found out. He went to China and 
established connections that enabled him to sell charms on eBay.
	
✓	Find a broker. A broker functions as a middleman — someone who 
connects you with factories. Jacobs recommends this option. “Some 
brokers in China deal with as many as 200 different factories,” he says. 
“They can offer you a wider selection than you would find on your own.”
	
✓	Go to trade shows. You might meet Chinese manufacturers or brokers 
there. See the following section, “Working the Trade Shows,” for more 
details.
	
✓	Search for a broker or supplier on Alibaba. I explain this site (www.
alibaba.com) further right after this list.
	
✓	Look on eBay. According to Jacobs, eBay is increasingly becoming a 
place where goods from China are sold at low prices — in some cases, 
low enough that you can resell the merchandise elsewhere.
Alibaba is a business-to-business marketplace: It brings together Chinese 
wholesale suppliers and overseas merchants. Go to the home page (www.
alibaba.com), and you see listings for products that include health and 
beauty supplies, industrial materials, luggage, office supplies, printing and 
publishing, footwear and accessories, sports and entertainment items, cell 
phones, jewelry, and toys. The Chinese sellers make these products avail­
able to anyone who wants to meet their terms. You might be able to buy 
cell phone chargers, as long as you meet the minimum order quantity of 100 
pieces. You don’t always see the price on the site; you might have to contact 
the seller for that.
Alibaba is a convenient doorway into Chinese suppliers. Founded by former 
English teacher Jack Ma in 1999, it has grown to be the second-largest

Internet company in China. Alibaba is also moving into the U.S. market. As of 
this writing, it is planning to set up a marketplace to directly compete with 
Amazon.com and Walmart.
What are some potential pitfalls in working with suppliers on Alibaba? 
Testing the merchandise yourself isn’t possible. Getting one or two sample 
items isn’t always feasible, either — unless you use the company’s new 
AliExpress site (www.aliexpress.com), which is designed for small whole­
saler orders.
Stories circulate about suppliers who aren’t always trustworthy. Research 
sellers as much as you can, and try to deal with only those designated as 
Gold Suppliers. These are Alibaba sellers who have applied for this designa­
tion and who have been verified by a third-party security service provider. 
Find out more at alibaba.com.
Working the Trade Shows
A trade show is a mass gathering where buyers and sellers meet in the hope 
of making business connections. For many entrepreneurs, trade shows are a 
mysterious thing — it seems that they’re only for those “in the trade” and not 
amateurs like you. You need to get over this attitude and realize that you are 
in the trade. In fact, you’re on the cutting edge. By selling online, you have 
something to offer that wholesale suppliers are eager to know about. I highly 
recommend that after you settle on the kind of merchandise you want to sell, 
you find trade shows in that area so that you can go on the hunt for whole­
sale suppliers.
	
Don’t travel all the way to a trade show without registering first and making 
sure that you’re qualified to attend. Saying that you have a website or an eBay 
Store might not be enough. You might have to provide a tax ID number, a busi­
ness phone number, or a business address to convince those in charge that 
you’re a legitimate businessperson.
Trade shows aren’t always easy to find. Very few are likely to advertise in the 
local media. Looking online is a better bet. Try the following possibilities:
	
✓	The website TSNN.com (www.tsnn.com), which calls itself “The 
Ultimate Trade Show Directory” and gathers information about upcom­
ing trade shows
	
✓	Your local convention bureau, which probably has a list of upcoming 
events
	
✓	Trade journals in your chosen field

232
Part II: Creating a Business Website 
When you get to an event such as the L.A. Shoe Show, Coffee Fest Chicago, or 
the Jersey Shore Home Show, you may be overwhelmed with the sheer size 
of the venue and the large number of people involved, especially if you’ve 
traveled a long way to attend. Make sure you go with someone so you can 
take a team approach and divide the searching. It’s also a good idea for one 
person to “work the floor” while the other is stationed at a computer, either 
in a hotel room or at home. The person at the show can describe brand 
names and models, and the computer operator can look them up online to 
gauge the level of demand for such items.

E

very month — sometimes every week, it seems — the Internet spawns 
a new superstar. As I write this, the stars of the moment are featured in 
the “Two Girls and a Puppy” Facebook page. After losing their dog to cancer 
and asking their reluctant father for a new one, he challenged them to get a 
million Likes on a Facebook page. They posted a cute photo that had a simple 
message, a call to action, and provoked emotion. Within just seven hours, 
they managed to achieve their goal. (The puppy followed soon after.)
An article on Entrepreneur.com called “What Makes Your Video Shareable — 
and Viral” identified some traits common to things that get a lot of attention on 
the Internet: They generate emotion; they involve something that is startling 
and attention getting. The article suggested that to get attention, you need to 
“1. Be true, 2. Don’t waste our time, 3. Be unforgettable, and 4. Ultimately, it’s 
all about humanity.”
Marketers and businesspeople who try to attract attention online hope to 
create a gesture or slogan that becomes a meme — something easily imitated 
after being distributed on a web page or in a video.
Meme or not, the web can be a cost-effective way for a small business owner 
such as yourself to get a potential customer’s attention. Targeted, personalized 
public-relations efforts work online because cyberspace is a personal place 
where intimate communication is possible. Blanketed advertising strategies 
of the sort you see in other media (most notably display ads, commercials, 
or billboards) are expensive and don’t always work for online businesses. 

236
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Why? They lack the personal edge you get with e-commerce. The web is a 
one-to-one communications medium. In this chapter, I describe cost-effective, 
do-it-yourself advertising techniques for the online entrepreneur who has a 
fledgling business on a tight budget.
Coming Up with a Marketing Strategy
Half the battle with running a successful online business is developing a 
plan for what you want to do. The next step is to get noticed. For many busi­
nesses, the plan frequently involves getting people to talk about you — to 
promote “viral marketing” in which consumers sing your praises. The follow­
ing sections describe two strategies for making your company name more 
visible to online customers and promoting word-of-mouth publicity.
Choosing a brand that speaks for you
In business-speak, branding has nothing to do with cattle roundups and every­
thing to do with jacking up your profits. Branding is the process of raising 
awareness of a company’s name and logo through advertising, public relations, 
or other means (for example, getting people to say, “Did you hear about . . .?” 
and then mentioning you, your products, your website, and so on).
Despite recent economic crises, the web is a great place for developing a 
business brand. A study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (www.iab.
net) reported that advertising revenue (the amount that businesses spend to 
advertise online) reached $9.26 billion for the third quarter of that year — a 
substantial increase of 18 percent over the same period in the previous year. 
The report states that the figures are a “testament to the value marketers get 
from using digital media.
Online advertising works because you don’t have to get potential shoppers 
to dress up, drive across town, and find a parking spot. Web users sit only 
a foot or two from the screen (or only inches away, if they’re using a hand­
held device), which means your web page can easily get a user’s undivided 
attention — if your content is compelling enough, that is. Don’t be shy about 
providing links to click, thumbnail images to view, and the like. (Just be sure 
to place these items where they work best; see Chapter 11 for more about 
that.) Previous studies have found that web advertising that doesn’t seem 
like advertising — that is, it’s interactive and entertaining — is supported and 
liked by consumers. These studies also showed that brands advertised on 
the web were seen as forward thinking.
But don’t rely on your web page alone to spread your name. Use the whole 
Internet — including e-mail, online communities, contests, and promotions. 

237
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
These days you have plenty of options to get the word out about your online 
business, such as the following:
	
✓	Blogs: These are online diaries that you can create to encourage connec­
tions with your customers and other interested individuals; you can use 
them to build visibility and generate advertising revenue.
	
✓	Social networking: More and more businesses are using popular places 
such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest to promote themselves and 
their products.
	
✓	Banner ads: This type of ad is similar to the traditional print ads you 
place in a newspaper. See the “Waving a banner ad” section, later in this 
chapter, for more information.
	
✓	Classifieds: You can advertise your goods on a classified ad site such as 
Craigslist (www.craigslist.org).
	
✓	Interstitials: These pop-up ads appear in a separate window while a web 
page is loading.
	
	Pop-ups are fairly common on the web, but many users strongly dislike 
them and set their browsers to disallow them. Such ads also slow down 
the browsing/shopping process, which dampens the enthusiasm of 
impulse buyers. Before you use them, consider both the upside and 
downside, as described in the “Pop-up (and under, and over) ads” section, 
later in this chapter.
	
✓	Keyword searches: You can learn how search services work so that you 
can make your site appear more prominently in search results.
	
✓	Newsletters: You can generate goodwill and drive business to your 
website by distributing an e-mail newsletter.
	
✓	Partnerships: Find businesses whose goods and services complement 
yours and create links on each other’s websites.
	
A website can also promote a brand that has already become well known through 
traditional sales and marketing strategies. The click-and-mortar version of 
Walmart (www.walmart.com) works in conjunction with the giant retailer’s many 
brick-and-mortar stores. The website provides a selection of styles and sizes 
that’s generally wider than what customers can find in stores. The National 
Retail Federation’s Stores magazine (www.stores.org) ranked Wal-Mart 
number 1 among all retail stores, with almost $454 million in revenue in 2012.
You may not have thousands of dollars to spend on banner ads, but they 
aren’t the most effective forms of online advertising anymore, anyway. It’s 
just as effective to start with some simple, cost-effective techniques like this 
one: Make sure your signature files, domain name, and e-mail address all 
refer to your company name as closely as possible. It may take a while for 
your business to develop name awareness among consumers, but these 
techniques give you a perfect way to start.

238
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Being selective about your audience
Traditional broadcast advertising, such as commercials or radio spots, works 
kind of like standing on top of a tall building and screaming, “Hey, everyone, 
come to my store!” Such ads deliver short bits of information to huge numbers 
of people — everyone in the coverage areas who happens to be tuned in at a 
particular time. The Internet has its own form of broadcasting — getting your 
company mentioned or advertised on one of the sites that draws millions of 
visitors each day.
But where the Internet really excels is in one-to-one communication of the kind 
that TV and radio can’t touch. I suggest you try your own personalized forms 
of online advertising before you attempt to blanket cyberspace with banner 
ads. Often you can reach small, targeted groups of people — or even one 
prospect at a time — through free, do-it-yourself marketing strategies. These 
strategies include using the right keywords, sending newsletters, and taking 
part in mailing lists and newsgroups, all of which I discuss in the next section.
Painting a new business scenario
Marques Vickers has appeared in this book through several editions when he was primarily an 
artist based in California. His life has changed dramatically, and though he says he doesn’t spend 
as much time online as he used to, he’s an example of someone who has been able to change his 
life and circumstances profoundly, in part through the web. “I can clearly say that Internet access 
enabled me to pursue my present course even if it meant shifting directions,” he declares.
Through his self-named website (www.marquesv.com), he still markets his own painting, sculp­
ture, and photography, as well as his books on marketing and buying fine art online. In 2009, he 
became an auction consultant, using eBay to market both paintings and collectible items; his new 
site is at www.artsinamerica.com. He first went online in November 1999, and his art-related sites 
have received anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 visits per month.
Q. What have you done to market your work in a difficult economy?
A. Time is the lone commodity we often have control of, so I am focusing my selling activities 
on areas that are truly productive, and I pay greater attention to the response from advertising. 
Essentially, time management is my greatest form of cost control.
Q. What are the costs of running all your websites and doing the associated marketing?
A. Out-of-pocket expense is approximately $29 monthly for a website hosting and Internet access 
package. New domain name registrations and renewals probably add another $250 because I own 
more than 20 domain names.
Q. What would you describe as the primary goals of your online business?
A. My initial objective was to develop a personalized, round-the-clock global presence in order to 
recruit sales outlets, sell directly to the public, and create a reference point for people to access 

239
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
and view my work. I also have an intuitive sense that an online website presence will be a market­
ing necessity for any future visual artist and a lifelong exposure outlet. Having an online presence 
builds my credibility as a fine artist and positions me to take advantage of the evolution of the 
fine-arts industry, too.
Q. Has your online business been profitable financially?
A. Absolutely — but make no mistake, achieving sales volume and revenue is a trial-and-error 
process and involves a significant time commitment. I’m still perfecting the business model, and it 
may require years to achieve the optimum marketing plan.
Q. How do you promote your site?
A. With the Internet, you are layering a collective web of multiple promotional sources. 
Experimentation is essential because recognition is not always immediate but may ultimately 
be forthcoming because postings in cyberspace are often stumbled across from unforeseen 
resources. I try multiple marketing outlets including paid ad positioning services, such as Overture 
and Google, bartered advertising space, and reciprocally traded links. Some have had moderate 
success, some unforeseen and remarkable exposure. Unlike traditional advertising media that 
have immediate response times, the Internet may lag in its response. It is a long-term commitment 
and one that cannot be developed by short-term tactics or media blitzes.
Q. Do you create your web pages yourself or do you work with someone to do that?
A. I’m too particular about the quality of content to subcontract the work out. Besides, I know 
what I want to say, how I want to say it, and am capable of fashioning the design concepts I want 
to integrate. The rectangular limitations of HTML design make color a very important component, 
and the very minimal attention span of most web viewers means that you’d better get to the point 
quickly and concisely. The more personalized, timely, and focused your content, the more reason 
an individual has to return to your website and ultimately understand your unique vision of what 
you’re trying to create. A website is an unedited forum for telling your version of a story and a 
means for cultivating a direct support base.
Q. How are you using the web these days? 
A. A few years ago, I uprooted from Northern California with my wife, and we moved to the Languedoc 
region of southern France. I decided to focus my activities on areas more interesting to me and 
pursue a completely different direction. Much of the process is detailed in a column I write called 
“An American in the French Languedoc” (www.the-languedoc-page.com/articles/
languedoc-articles01g.htm). I am still doing my artwork, but my primary “work” is buying 
and renovating houses (www.uniqueseek.com). I’ve taken a decided step back from the pace of 
Northern California. I still use the Internet for promoting the houses I renovate, however.
Q. What advice would you give to someone starting an online business?
A. Don’t hesitate one minute longer than necessary. Read substantially and from a diverse selec­
tion of sources on the subject. Subscribe to e-zines on related subject matter and query the web­
masters of sites that impress you with their content. Go to informational seminars; ask questions. 
Distribute your message to multiple outlets, but focus your time and energy on what works best. 
Don’t be afraid to experiment. Established sales outlets are usually best. The Internet is here to 
stay, and we have just scratched the surface in terms of potential.

240
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Publicizing Your Online Business Free
In the following sections, I describe some ways you can publicize your online 
business yourself — for free. Prepare, however, to devote several hours a 
week to corresponding by e-mail and applying to have your business listed 
in search services, Internet indexes, or websites that have a customer base 
similar to yours.
	
The best way to generate first-time and return visits to your business site is to 
make yourself useful as well as ornamental. The longer people are inclined to 
stay on your website, the more likely they are to acquire your goods or services. 
(See Chapter 5 for some specific suggestions on generating compelling, useful 
content.)
A newsletter for next to nothing
It used to be said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but these days 
nothing beats a well-used mouse. No longer do you have to spend time and 
money to print a newsletter on actual paper and distribute it around the 
neighborhood. Now that you’re online, you can say what you want — as often 
as you want — with your own publication. Online newsletters also help meet 
your clients’ customer service needs, as I discuss in Chapter 8.
	
Many of the suggestions in this section apply to an even easier way of getting 
the word out: creating a blog. With a blog, you don’t have to worry about design, 
distribution, and organization issues, either; you just have to focus on putting 
out content that your readers actually find useful and that encourages them to 
return on a regular basis.
Publish or perish
The work of producing an online newsletter is offset by the benefits you get 
in return. You may obtain hundreds — even thousands — of subscribers who 
find out about you and your online business.
To run your publishing venture smoothly, however, consider these areas:
	
✓	Topics: If you run out of topics to write about, look to others for inspira­
tion. Identify magazines in your field of business so that you can quote 
articles. Get on the mailing list for any press releases you can use.
	
✓	Staff: You don’t have to do it all. Delegate the editing function to some­
one else, or line up colleagues to function as contributors.

241
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
	
✓	Design: You have two choices: Send a plain-text version that doesn’t 
look pretty but that everyone can read easily, or send a formatted HTML 
version that looks like a web page but is readable only by people who 
can receive formatted e-mail. Keep in mind, though, that many users are 
on corporate e-mail systems that either discourage or prohibit HTML-
formatted e-mail. Others don’t like HTML e-mail because it takes longer 
to download the graphics files.
	
✓	Audience: Identify your readers and make sure that your content is 
useful to them. (This last item certainly applies to business blogs: Save 
the personal news about your trip to Ibiza or your new puppy for a per­
sonal blog; focus on your area of expertise and present news and tips for 
readers who are interested in them.)
	
Newsletters work only if they appear on a regular basis and they consistently 
maintain a high level of quality. Whether yours comes out every week, every 
month, or just once a year, your subscribers expect you to re-create your pub­
lication with every new issue. Keep your newsletter simple and make sure you 
have the resources to follow through.
Extra! Read all about it!
After you do your planning, the actual steps involved in creating your news­
letter are pretty straightforward. Because you’re just starting out, I suggest 
you concentrate on producing only a plain-text version of your newsletter. 
Later on, you can think about doing an HTML version as well.
People like receiving inside tips and suggestions in plain text; they’re happy 
that they don’t have to wait for graphics files to download. On the other 
hand, a simple layout with colors and small photos can work well. Figure 10-1 
shows an example: The Chicago publishing house that published my book 
Literary Chicago uses a two-column arrangement for its user-friendly newslet­
ter. It’s a standard layout provided by the e-mail marketing service Constant 
Contact (www.constantcontact.com).
	
Before you do anything, check with your ISP to make sure that you’re per­
mitted to have a mailing-list publication. Even if your newsletter consists of 
a simple announcement that you send only once in a while (in contrast to a 
discussion list, which operates pretty much constantly), you’ll be sending a lot 
more e-mail messages through your ISP’s machines than you otherwise would.
	
Keep the size of your newsletters small; about 30KB is the biggest e-mail file 
you can comfortably send. If you absolutely must have a larger newsletter, 
break it into two or three separate e-mail messages. Reducing the file size 
of your newsletter keeps your readers from getting irritated about how long 
your message takes to download or open. And keeping your customers happy 
should be one of your highest business priorities.

242
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
Figure 10-1: 
An e-mail 
newsletter 
typically 
begins with 
a heading, 
a horizontal 
divider, and 
a table of 
contents.
	
When you’re all set with the prep work, follow these general steps for an 
overview of how to create and distribute your publication:
	
1.	Open a plain-text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or SimpleText 
(Mac).
	
2.	Start typing.
	
	 Just because your newsletter is in plain text doesn’t mean that you can’t 
spice it up. Consider the following low-tech suggestions for emphasizing 
text or separating one section from another:
 
• All caps: Using ALL CAPITAL LETTERS is always useful for distin­
guishing the name of the newsletter or heads from subheads.
 
• Rules: You can create horizontal rules by typing a row of equal 
signs, hyphens, or asterisks to separate sections.
 
• Blank spaces: Used carefully, that lowly spacebar on your keyboard 
can help you center plain text or divide it into columns.
	
	 Be sure to proofread the whole newsletter before sending it. Better yet, 
ask an objective viewer to read the text for you. Ask him or her to make 
suggestions on content, organization, and format, as well as to look for 
typos.

243
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
	
3.	Save your file.
	
4.	Open your e-mail program’s address book, select the mailing list of 
recipients, and compose a new message to them.
	
5.	Attach your newsletter to the message or paste it into the body of the 
message, and click Send.
If you’re sending many e-mail messages simultaneously, be sure to do your 
mailing at a time when Internet traffic isn’t heavy. Many popular newsletters, 
such as eWeek News, go out on weekends, for example. Other e-commerce 
providers, such as 1ShoppingCart.com (www.1shoppingcart.com).
	
Don’t flood your Internet service provider’s mail server with hundreds or 
thousands of messages at one time; you may crash the server. Break the list 
into smaller batches and send them at different times.
	
Be sure to mention your newsletter on your web page and provide an e-mail 
address where people can subscribe to it. In the beginning, you can ask 
people to send subscription requests to you. If your list swells to hundreds of 
members, consider automated mailing-list software or a mailing-list service to 
manage your list.
Participating in mailing 
lists and newsgroups
Many areas of the Internet can provide you with direct access to potential 
customers and let you interact with them. Two of the best places to market 
yourself directly to individuals are mailing lists and newsgroups. Both are 
highly targeted and offer unprecedented opportunities for niche marketing. 
Using them takes a little creativity and time on your part, but the returns can 
be significant.
Get started by developing a profile of your potential customer. Then join and 
participate in lists and newsgroups that may provide customers for your online 
business. For example, if you sell memorabilia of movie stars to fans online, you 
may want to join some newsgroups started by the fans themselves.
	
Where can you find these discussion forums? Topica (lists.topica.com) 
maintains a mailing-list directory that you can search by name or topic; it 
includes thousands of mailing lists. (Topica also helps you create your own 
e-mail newsletter, by the way.) Refdesk.com (www.refdesk.com) maintains 
links to websites, organized by category, that help you locate and participate 
in newsgroups, mailing lists, and web forums.

244
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
A few newsgroups (in particular, the ones with biz at the beginning of their 
names) focus on small business issues and sales:
	
✓	misc.entrepreneurs
	
✓	biz.marketplace.discussion
	
✓	biz.marketplace.international.discussion
	
✓	biz.marketplace.services.discussion
	
✓	alt.business.home
	
✓	alt.business.consulting
	
✓	aol.commerce.general
The easiest way to access newsgroups is to use Google’s web-based directory 
(groups.google.com). Each browser or newsgroup program has its own steps 
for enabling you to access discussion groups in an extensive network called 
Usenet. Use your browser’s online help system to find out how you can 
access newsgroups.
Mailing lists
A mailing list is a group of individuals who receive communications by e-mail. 
Two kinds of mailing lists are common online:
Managing your mailing list
When you decide to host and run your own 
mailing list, you assume the responsibility of 
processing requests to subscribe and unsub­
scribe from the list. This venture can eat into 
the time you need to spend on other business 
activities. When mailing lists get to be too much 
to handle yourself, you have a couple of options 
to make life easier:
	✓	Purchase special mailing-list software. 
This type of program automatically adds 
or subtracts individuals from a mailing list 
in response to special e-mail messages 
that they send to you. You can usually 
manage the mailing list from your home 
computer. If you’re a Windows user, check 
out SendBlaster (www.sendblaster.
com). Mac users can try Direct Mail 
(www.directmailmac.com).
	✓	Hire a company to run your mailing list for 
you. Even though mailing-list software can 
help reduce the work involved in maintain­
ing a list, you still have to install and use 
the software. So if you’re really strapped for 
time, hiring a company to take care of your 
mailing list may be the way to go. Check 
out Constant Contact (www.constant
contact.com/index.jsp) or Lyris 
ListHosting (www.lyris.com/us-en/
products) for pricing information.

245
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
	
✓	Discussion lists: These are lists of people interested in a particular topic. 
People subscribe to the list and have messages on the topic delivered 
by e-mail. Each message sent to the list goes to everyone in the group. 
Each person can reply either to the original sender or to everyone in the 
group. The resulting series of messages on a topic is called a thread.
	
✓	Announcement lists: These lists provide only one-way communication. 
Recipients get a single message from the list administrator, such as an 
attached e-mail newsletter.
Discussion lists are often more specific in topic than newsgroups. These lists 
vary from very small lists to lists that include thousands of people. An exam­
ple of a discussion list is ROOTS-L, which is a mailing list for individuals who 
are researching family history. People on this list exchange inquiries about 
ancestors that they’re seeking and announce family tree information they’ve 
posted online.
By making contributions to a mailing list, you establish a presence, so when 
members are looking to purchase the kind of goods or services you offer, 
they’re likely to come to you rather than to a stranger. By participating in 
the lists that are right for you, you also find out invaluable information about 
your customers’ needs and desires. Use this information to fine-tune your 
business so that it better meets those needs and desires.
	
Marketing through lists and newsgroups requires a low-key approach. 
Participating by answering questions or contributing your opinion to ongoing 
discussion topics is far more effective than blatant self-promotion.
	
Always read the welcome message and list guidelines that you receive upon 
joining a mailing list. Figure out the rules before you post. Lurk in the back­
ground for a few weeks to get a feel for the topics and participants before you 
contribute. Let your four-to-six-line signature file establish your identity with­
out selling your wares directly. Also, don’t forget to spell-check and proofread 
your messages before you send them.
Discussion groups
Discussion groups provide a different form of online group participation. On 
the Internet, you can find discussion groups in Usenet. America Online and 
CompuServe also have their own systems of discussion groups that are sepa­
rate from Usenet. One of the easiest ways to access newsgroups, however, is 
with your web browser. Just point it to Google Groups (groups.google.com). 
Many large corporations and other organizations maintain their own internal 
discussion groups as well. In any case, you can also access discussion groups 
with your web browser’s newsgroup or e-mail software. Microsoft Outlook 
Express can connect to newsgroup postings, for example.

Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
You can promote yourself and your business in discussion groups in the 
same way that you use mailing lists: by participating in the group, providing 
helpful advice and comments, and answering questions. Don’t forget that 
newsgroups are great for fun and recreation, too; they’re a good way to solve 
problems, get support, and make new friends. For more information on 
newsgroups, see Chapter 3.
A contest in which everyone’s a winner
In Chapter 13, I describe how Jason Bolt, the young owner of Society43, uses 
contests and other Facebook promotions to attract attention to his online 
sunglasses business. Remember that everyone loves to receive something for 
free. Holding a contest can attract visitors to your website, where they can 
find out about the rest of your offerings — the ones you offer for sale, that is.
	
You don’t have to give away cars or trips around the world to get attention. 
Contests and giveaways are great ways to attract click-happy online shoppers. 
The floral site 1-800-Flowers.com, which has more than 670,000 “Likes” on 
Facebook, frequently holds contests there. So does Society43. Founder Jason 
Bolt knows it’s a great way to build loyalty and keep shoppers returning to his 
website or Facebook page, especially since his fans love competition anyway.
“Product giveaways coupled with a competition are always our most popular 
promotions on Facebook,” he comments. “Our fans are very passionate about 
sports and inherently competitive. Our most successful promotion to date 
involved a chance to win a pair of Limited Edition Oregon Chrome 43s. It was 
viewed by over 10,000 fans and shared 582 times.”
Cybersurfers regularly take advantage of freebies online by downloading 
shareware or freeware programs. They get free advice from newsgroups, and 
they find free companionship from chat rooms and online forums. Having 
already paid for network access and computer equipment, they actually 
expect to get something for free.
Your customers will keep coming back if you devise as many promotions, 
giveaways, or sales as possible. You can also get people to interact through 
online forums or other tools, as I describe in Chapter 5.
	
A 16-year-old cartoonist named Gabe Martin put his cartoons on his website, 
called The Borderline. Virtually nothing happened. But when his dad put up 
some money for a contest, young Gabe started getting hundreds of visits and 
inquiries. He went on to create 11 mirror sites (sites that provide duplicated 
information) around the world, develop a base of devoted fans, contribute to 
newspapers such as The San Diego Union-Tribune, and sell his own cartoon 
book. (You can read a brief bio at www.care2.com/ecards/bio/1022.)

 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
Waving a banner ad
I’m not as big a fan of traditional banner ads as I am of the other strategies 
that I discuss in this chapter — especially where small entrepreneurial busi­
nesses are concerned. But banner ads have hardly gone away. You see them 
on the free versions of mobile apps, and on popular sites such as YouTube 
(www.youtube.com). This venue reportedly attracts 790 million unique visi­
tors per month, so it’s a nearly irresistible place for advertisers. In general, 
though, banner ads are being used online less frequently than targeted ads — 
that is, ads that appear when specified keyword searches are conducted on 
sites such as Google (www.google.com) and Ask.com (www.ask.com).
Banner ads are like the traditional print ads you might take out in local news­
papers. In limited cases, banner ads are free, as long as you or a designer can 
create one. Otherwise, you have to pay to place them on someone else’s web 
page, the same way you pay to take out an ad in a newspaper or magazine.
Even these days, however, many commercial operations do use banner ads 
successfully on the web. Banner ads can be effective promotional tools under 
certain circumstances:
	
✓	If you pay enough money to keep them visible in cyberspace for a long 
period of time
	
✓	If you pay the high rates charged by the most successful websites, 
which can steer you the most traffic
Banner ads differ from other web-specific publicity tactics in one important 
respect: They publicize in a one-to-many rather than a one-to-one fashion. 
Banner ads broadcast the name of an organization indiscriminately, without 
requiring the viewer to click a link or in some respect choose to find out 
about the site.
Anteing up
You have to pay the piper to play the banner ad game. In general, websites 
have two methods of charging for banner ads:
	
✓	CPM, or cost per thousand: This is a way of charging for advertising 
based on the number of people who visit the web page on which your ad 
appears. The more visits the website gets, the higher the ad rates that 
site can charge. In this type of advertising, you have to pay depending 
on the number of times your ad is viewed, regardless of whether anyone 
clicks it to actually visit your site.
	
✓	CTR, or clickthrough rate: A clickthrough occurs when someone clicks 
a banner ad that links to your (the advertiser’s) website. (Virtually all 
banner ads are linked this way.) In this case, you are billed after the ad 
has run for a while and the clicks have been tallied.

248
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Say that 100,000 people visit the site on which your banner runs. If the site 
charges a flat $20 CPM rate, your banner ad costs $2,000 (100 × $20). If the 
same site charges a $1 per clickthrough rate, and 2 percent of the 100,000 
visitors click through to your site (the approximate average for the industry), 
you pay the same: $2,000 (2,000 × $1).
Obviously, the more popular the site on which you advertise, the more your 
ad costs. Back in 1999, when Yahoo! was still publishing its advertising rates 
online, it charged a CPM rate of $20 to $50 for each 1,000 visits to the Yahoo! 
page on which the banner ad appeared. If the page on which your banner 
runs received 500,000 visits, such ads could cost $10,000 to $25,000. Not all 
advertising sites are so expensive, of course.
These days, many advertisers are following Google’s lead and charging for 
ads with a cost per click (CPC) model, or some form of CPC. CPC is similar to 
CTR in that you, the advertiser, pay when someone clicks a link or graphic 
image that takes that person to your website. But the big difference is that in 
Google’s CPC model, you determine how much you pay for each click; in tra­
ditional CTR, the advertisers set the rates. In this system, the advertiser pays 
only when someone actually clicks an ad. In the case of Google’s AdWords 
program (adwords.google.com), the amount paid per click is one that the 
advertiser decides by placing a bid on keywords used to display the ad. See 
Chapter 11 for more information on AdWords.
	
CPM rates are difficult to calculate because of the number of repeat visitors a 
site typically receives. For example, a web page designer may visit the same site 
a hundred times in a day when testing scripts and creating content. If the site 
that hosts your ad charges a rate based on CPM, make sure the site weeds 
out such repeat visits. You’re better off advertising on sites that charge on 
not only a CPM but also a clickthrough basis — or, better yet, only on a click­
through basis. The combination of CPM and CTR is harder for the hosting site 
to calculate but ultimately fairer for you, the advertiser.
Positioning banner ads can be a substantial investment, so be sure that your 
ad appears on a page whose visitors are likely to be interested in your com­
pany. If your company sells automotive parts, for example, get on one of the 
Yahoo! automotive index pages.
Designing your ad
The standard “medium rectangle” and “large rectangle” banner ads are tra­
ditional. Some standard square configurations or small, button-like shapes 
are common, too. These days, ads appear on the side of a page (often on the 
right, as on Facebook) and they are relatively small. The measurements for 

249
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
ads usually appear in pixels. An inch contains roughly 72 pixels, so a 110-x-80-
pixel ad (the size seen on Facebook) is less than 2 inches wide and about 1 
inch high.
The rectangular ads appear most often at the top of a web page, so they load 
first while other page contents have yet to appear; smaller ads may appear 
anywhere on a page. (Ensuring that your ad appears at the top of a web page 
is always a good idea.)
Many banner ads combine photographic images, type, and color in a graphi­
cally sophisticated way. However, simple ads can be effective as well. You 
can create your ad yourself if you have some experience with a graphics 
program such as PaintShop Pro. (You can download a trial copy of PaintShop 
Pro at www.corel.com.)
	
Need some help creating your own banner ad? If you have only a simple, 
text-only ad in mind and you don’t have a lot of money to spend on design, 
try a create-your-own-banner-ad service or software program. I’ve had mixed 
results with the online banner-ad services such as The Banner Generator, pro­
vided for free by Prescient Code Solutions (www.coder.com/creations/
banner). See Figure 10-2 for an ad that I created in just a couple of minutes 
by using a shareware program called Banner Maker Pro (www.bannermaker
pro.com).

Using Guerrilla Marketing Strategies
I didn’t make up the term guerilla marketing. As you may already know, the 
term appears in the titles of a series of popular books by Jay Conrad Levinson 
and Michael McLaughlin. It appears to be a buzzword that encompasses many 
(actually sensible) marketing techniques — from providing good customer 
service to knowing what your competition is doing. It also means going beyond 
the passive placement of ads on web pages or other venues and taking a pro­
active, aggressive approach to getting your business name and brand in the 
marketplace. With competition growing all the time among online businesses, 
it pays to know all the options when dealing with online advertising — including 
the ones I describe in this section.
Pop-up (and under, and over) ads
You’ve probably experienced it: the moment you connect to a website, a 
window pops up on your computer with an ad. Other sites typically urge you 
Profiting from someone else’s banner ads
Banner ads may be out of favor, but they’re not dead by any means. When used economically and 
targeted to the right audience, banner ads can help you achieve one of your goals: attracting visi­
tors to your website. Attract enough visitors, and banner ads can help you achieve another, even 
more important goal: making money.
If you attract thousands or (if you’re lucky) even millions of visitors to your site each month, you 
become an attractive commodity to advertisers looking to gain eye space for their own banner 
advertisements. By having another business pay you to display their ads, you can generate extra 
revenue with very little effort.
Of course, the effort involved in soliciting advertisers, placing ads, keeping track of how many 
visitors to your site actually click ads, and getting paid is considerable — but you don’t have to 
manage ads yourself.
For John Moen, owner of a pair of map-related websites (including Graphic Maps), the move from 
marketing his own website to becoming an advertiser came when his WorldAtlas.com (www.
worldatlas.com) site began to attract 3 million hits per month. He turned to advertising giant 
DoubleClick by Google (www.doubleclick.com) to serve the ads and handle the maintenance.
“We place DoubleClick’s banner code on our pages, and DoubleClick pays us monthly for page 
impressions, direct clicks, page hits, and the like,” says John. “DoubleClick also provides a daily 
report on site traffic. With [its] reports, I can tell which page gets the most hits and at what time of 
day. Banner advertising now pays very well.”

251
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
to sign up for news alerts or subscribe to a newsletter. Anything you can do to 
induce your visitors to identify themselves and provide contact information, 
from an e-mail address to a street address, is to your advantage.
Many web surfers consider pop-up ads a bane, and some utilities — like the 
Google add-on browser toolbar and firewalls like Norton Internet Security, as 
well as browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox — can block them from 
appearing in the first place. But they can still get through to some individuals 
who don’t have software configured to block them. And if your website 
becomes popular enough, a company will approach you about placing its ad 
on your page, either as a banner ad that is part of the page or as a window 
that does one of several things:
	
✓	Pops up: This type of ad window is probably the most common. It 
appears when a page is viewed and pops up atop the page you want 
to view. These ads work best when their content is related to the page 
you’ve opened: Subscribe to our newsletter, buy our book, attend our 
seminar, or other supplementary information.
	
✓	Pops under: When you open web pages on many sites that display ads, 
a new window opens. But this window, which contains an ad unrelated 
to the web page, opens underneath the primary window. Its content is 
visible only when the user specifically tries to close it, or closes or 
minimizes the other window(s) sitting on top of it.
	
✓	Pops on top: These ads, also called interstitials, totally replace the content 
you want to view. You are forced to look at them for a period of time and 
close them before you can view the page you want to see. I see these ads 
used on online magazines. When you click an article, a totally new window 
appears, with animated content, and big enough that it completely covers 
the article you want to read. You have to close the ad window to keep 
reading. You can read more about interstitials at whatis.techtarget.
com/definition/interstitial-in-between.
John Moen told me that he has received criticism for pop-up and other ads 
on his clip-art site. But there’s a trade-off here: The ad revenue makes it 
possible for him to keep creating the art and offering it for free. In the end, 
whether consumers realize it or not, they benefit from the ads because they 
get free art. All they have to do is click the close box to delete the window 
that pops up.
Adding life to your ads
Ads that appear on billboards, the sides of buildings, the sides of buses, the 
lights on top of cabs, and the pages of newspapers and magazines have one 
thing in common: They basically sit there and don’t do anything. They can 
have lights pointed at them, and magazine ads for perfumes can be scented — 
but that’s about it.

252
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
On the web, ads can be interactive in several different ways. The aim is to 
gain more attention from the hurried web surfer who is, after all, looking for 
something else on the current web page. You see several examples of interac­
tive ads on the SteelHouse website (www.steelhouse.com). This company 
creates interactive ads for businesses. For example, go to the home page of 
SteelHouse client Mackenzie Limited (www.mackenzieltd.com) and you’ll 
see a series of products for sale slide across the top of the page. These might 
include “interaction points” as well as YouTube videos, carousels, count-
down timers, and social media icons.
	
Creating ads that appear to move around is easy, although you shouldn’t 
expect them to look as elegant as those created by a professional designer. 
You need software that’s used to create animated GIF images, such as GIF 
Construction Set Professional, a Windows-only program available for $24.99 
(www.mindworkshop.com/gifcon.html), or the Mac application GIF.gIf.
giF, available for $28 (www.peda.com/ggg). When you create the initial ad 
image and save it in GIF format, you create a series of variations and string 
them together to create the animation. The animation software leads you 
through the process.
Minding Your Ps and Qs 
(Puns and Quips)
What attracts shoppers to your business and encourages them to place 
orders from thousands of miles away? It’s what you have to sell and how you 
present it. But how can customers understand what you’re selling if they 
speak a different language? You must make your site accessible to all your 
potential customers.
Speaking their language
Put yourself in your customer’s place. Suppose that you’re from Spain. You 
speak a little English, but Spanish is your native tongue, and other Romance 
languages, such as French or Italian, are definitely easier for you to under­
stand than English. You’re surfing around an Internet shopping mall and you 
come across sentences such as
Hey, ratchet-jaws. Shoot me some e-mail with your handle, and steer 
clear of Smokeys with ears.
Whatever. All you home boys will be down with my superfly jive.
Like, this cable modem is totally awesome to the max.

253
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
Get the picture? Your use of slang and local dialect may have customers from 
your own hometown or region in stitches, but it can leave many more people 
scratching their heads and clicking to the next site. The first rule in making 
your site accessible to a worldwide audience is to keep your language simple 
so that people from all walks of life — and various places on the planet — can 
understand you.
Using the right salutations
First impressions mean a lot. The way you address someone can mean the 
difference between getting off on the right foot and stumbling over your 
shoelaces. The following useful tidbits are from the International Addresses 
and Salutations web page (www.bspage.com/address.html), which, in 
turn, borrowed them from Merriam-Webster’s Guide to International Business 
Communications:
	
✓	In Austria, address a man as Herr and a woman as Frau; don’t use 
Fräulein for business correspondence.
	
✓	In southern Belgium, use Monsieur or Madame to address someone, but 
the language spoken in northern Belgium is Flemish, so be sure to use 
De heer (Mr.) when addressing a man, or Mevrouw, abbreviated Mevr. 
(Mrs.) when addressing a woman.
	
✓	In India, use Shri (Mr.) or Shrimati (Mrs.). Don’t use a given name unless 
you’re a relative or close friend.
	
✓	In Japan, given names aren’t used in business. Use the family name 
followed by the job title. Or add -san to the family name (for example, 
Fujita-san) or the even-more-respectful -sama (Fujita-sama).
Adding multilingual content to your website is a nice touch, particularly if 
you deal on a regular basis with customers or clients from a particular area. 
Regional differences abound, so it’s prudent to find someone familiar with 
the area you’re trying to target and ask that person to read your text before 
you put it up on the web. Let a friend — not the absence of orders for your 
goods — tell you that you’ve committed a cultural faux pas. That way, you 
can fix it before you put it out there.
Making your site multilingual
One of the best ways to expand your business to other countries is to provide 
alternative translations of your content. You can either hire someone to pre­
pare the text in one or more selected languages or use a computer program 

254
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
to do the work for you. Then provide links to the web pages that contain the 
translated text right on your site’s home page, like this:
Read this page in:
French
Spanish
German
One translation utility that’s particularly easy to use — and free — is available 
from Microsoft’s search service Bing. Just follow these steps to get your own 
instant translation:
	
1.	Connect to the Internet, launch your web browser, and go to www.
bing.com/translator.
	
	 The Bing Translator page appears.
	
2.	If you have specific text you want to translate, type the text in the left 
box or copy and paste it from a word processing program; if you want 
the service to translate an entire web page, type or copy and paste the 
URL in the same text box.
	
	Be sure to include the first part of the URL (for example, www.mysite.
com rather than just mysite.com).
	
	 Obviously, the shorter and simpler the text, the better your results.
	
3.	Choose the translation path (that is, from what language you want to 
translate) by clicking the Translate from or Translate to drop-down list.
	
	 At this writing, the service offers translation to or from 39 languages, 
including Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, 
Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
	
4.	Click the Translate button.
	
	 Almost as fast as you can say “Welcome to the new Tower of Babel,” a 
new web page appears onscreen with the foreign-language version of your 
text. (If you selected a web page to translate, it appears in the new lan­
guage. The title of the page, however, remains in the original language.)
	
A computer can never be as good as a human being when it comes to language 
translation. I once tried to translate my own web page into French, showed it 
to a friend who is a native speaker, and watched her laugh at the results. If you 
try a computer translation, attempt only the simplest of sentences. And get 
someone who really understands the language to proofread the results.
	
Instead of creating a foreign-language version of your web page, you can pro­
vide a link to the Yahoo! translation page on your own page. That way, your 
visitors can translate your text for themselves.
You can download the software behind the translation service, Systran 
Translator, from the SYSTRAN Software, Inc., website (www.systransoft.com). 

255
 Chapter 10: Advertising and Publicity: The Basics
The program costs anywhere from $69 to $749 depending on the number of 
languages you need. It is available for Windows only and requires at least 
a 1.2 Ghz processor, at least 1 to 2GB of RAM, and at least 500MB of hard 
drive space and 90MB of space per language pair during installation. If you 
need translation to or from Japanese, Chinese, or Korean (or from Russian to 
English), look into SYSTRAN Premium Translator, which starts at $899. This 
program has the same software requirements as the less expensive Personal 
package, as well as a driver for displaying Asian fonts, which is essential if 
you’re translating into Asian languages.
	
You don’t have to translate your entire website. Just providing an alternative 
version of your home page may be sufficient. The important thing is to give 
visitors an overview of your business and a brief description of your products 
and services in a language they can understand. Always include a mailto link 
(see Chapter 5) so that people can send mail to you. However, if you aren’t 
prepared to receive a response in Kanji or Swahili, request that your guests 
send their message in a language you can read.
	
Although you probably don’t have sufficient resources to pay for a slew of 
translation services, having someone translate your home page so that you 
can provide an alternative version may be worthwhile — especially if you sell 
products that are likely to be desirable to a particular market where a differ­
ent language is the order of the day. Consider hiring a competent graduate 
student to do some translation for you. Plenty of translation services are avail­
able online. Yahoo! has an index of translation services at
dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Translation_Services/
Website_Translation
Using the right terms
Sometimes communicating effectively with someone from another country is 
a matter of knowing the terms used to describe important items in that lan­
guage. The names of the documents you use to draw up an agreement or pay 
a bill are often very different in other countries than they are in your own. 
For example, if you’re an American merchant and someone from Europe asks 
you to provide a pro forma invoice, you may not know what the person wants. 
You’re used to hearing the document in question called a quote.
When you and your European buyer have come to terms, a commercial 
invoice is an official form you may need to use for billing purposes. Many of 
these forms have to do with large-scale export/import trade, and you may 
never have to use them. But if you do undertake trade with people overseas, 
be aware that they may require you to use their own forms, not yours, to seal 
the deal. To avoid confusion later on, ask your overseas clients about any 
special requirements that pertain to business documents before you proceed 
too far with the transaction.

Marketing through global networking
Jeffrey Edelheit knows the potential for making connections around the world by taking advantage 
of the networking value of the World Wide Web. Edelheit, a business planning and development 
consultant based in Sebastopol, California, supports fledgling entrepreneurs’ dreams of getting 
their businesses off the ground. You can find some of his advice for small business owners on the 
Bplans.com website, which is associated with the Business Plan Pro software product (http://
help.bplans.com/ask-bplans). He also helps established businesspeople extend their 
reach by looking at ways of gaining greater market exposure — including going online. In addition, 
he works closely with management and staff to develop the internal systems necessary to build a 
strong operational base for the company.
Edelheit provides the following guidance:
	✓	Be deliberate in the creation of your website. “I’ve worked with clients who are able to attract 
overseas customers and express themselves through creating their own websites,” he says. A 
well-thought-out website can create a relationship between you and your customers; in other 
words, the stronger the relationship, the greater the opportunity for sales.
	✓	Know your market. “The most important suggestion I can make,” Edelheit says, “is to know 
the overseas market that you want to reach and be aware of the issues associated with doing 
business there. I recommend getting contact information for an international trade group from 
the country’s consulate.”
	✓	Research shipping costs and regulations. Shipping costs and restrictions are among the most 
common problems new businesspeople encounter when dealing with foreign customers, he 
says. “Check with the U.S. Customs Service and find out what the duty charges are before you 
ship overseas. Once, in the ’80s, a company I was working with shipped an IBM computer to 
Sweden, but because there were still restrictions on exporting high-tech equipment, I nearly 
got arrested by U.S. Customs for not having received the required special clearance.”
	✓	Avoid being ethnocentric. “Also be aware of how consumers in other cultures regard your 
products,” he suggests. Make sure that nothing about your products would be considered 
offensive or bad luck to someone from another part of the world.
	✓	Be visible. Edelheit emphasizes that after you figure out the inside tricks to the search engines 
and cooperative links, you have an unlimited potential to reach people. He believes that one of 
the keys to a successful website is providing information that your targeted market would find 
useful — and then providing product offerings as an attractive supplement.
You’ll find tips for preparing a plan for a web-based business contributed by Edelheit and the

f you can get your business mentioned in just the right place, customers 
can find you more easily. Consider my local electronics repair shop. The 
store has been in business for more than three decades but never seemed 
to be busy. When I asked, however, the owner told me he was overwhelmed 
with hundreds of back orders and couldn’t get to my job for several weeks. 
His store had just been featured on a local public television show, and now 
people were driving long distances to bring him retro audio equipment to fix.
On the web, too, being found is the key to success. And search engines are the 
most important places to get yourself before the public. The key requirements 
for any business are to match its products or services with potential custom­
ers, to ensure that the company shows up in lots of search results, and to have 
the site near the top of the first page. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a set 
of practices designed to improve your site’s placement in search results and 
is a cost-effective form of advertising that any website owner can tackle. SEO 
gives you a measure of control over the quality of your placement in search 
results, and this chapter describes strategies for improving it.
SEO has a bigger business impact than pay-per-click advertising or social 
media, according to the 2012 State of Digital Marketing Report conducted 
by webmarketing (http://go.webmarketing123.com/2012-State-
of-Digital-Marketing-Report.html). For companies doing business-
to-business (B2B) commerce, SEO generated the most leads, and for those 
doing business-to consumer (B2C) sales, it was most effective in promoting 
brand awareness.

Understanding How Search 
Engines Find You
Have you ever wondered why some companies manage to find their way to 
the top page of search engine results — and occasionally pop up several times 
on the same page — while others get buried deep within pages and pages 
of website listings? Ideally, search engines would rank e-commerce sites by 
how well designed they are and how responsive their owners are. But with 
so many millions of websites crowding the Internet, the job of processing 
searches and indexing website URLs and contents has to be automated. The 
process is computerized, so you can perform some magic with the way your 
web pages are written that can help you improve your placement in a set of 
search results.
Your site doesn’t necessarily need to appear right at the top of the first 
search results page. But keep in mind that consumers on the web are in a 
rush, and if you can get your site on the first page of search results — if not 
at the top of that page — you get more attention. The important thing is to 
ensure that your site appears before that of your competition. To begin, you 
need to think like a searcher, which is probably easy because you do plenty 
of web-based searches yourself. How do you find the websites you want? Two 
things are of paramount importance: keywords and links.
Keywords are key
A keyword describes a subject that you enter in a search box to find informa­
tion on a website or on the wider Internet. Suppose you’re trying to find a 
source for an herbal sweetener called Stevia that low-carb dieters like. You’d 
naturally enter the term Stevia in the search box on your search service of 
choice, click a button — Search, Search Now, Go, or something similar — and 
then wait a few seconds for search results to gather.
When you send a keyword to a search service, you set a number of possible 
actions in motion. One thing that happens is that the keyword is processed 
by a script on a web server operated by the search service. The script makes 
a request (which in computerspeak is a query) to a database file. The data­
base contains contents culled from millions (even billions, depending on the 
service) of web pages.
The database contents are gathered from two sources. In some cases, search 
services employ human editors who record selected contents of web pages 
and write descriptions for those pages. But web pages are so changeable that 
most of the work is actually done by computer programs that automatically 
scour the web. These programs don’t record every word on every web page. 
Some take words from the headings; others index the first 50 or 100 words on 

259
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
a website. Accordingly, when I searched for Stevia on Google, the sites listed 
at the top of the first page of search results had two attributes:
	
✓	Some sites had the word Stevia in the URL, such as www.stevia.net or 
www.stevia.com.
	
✓	Other sites had the word Stevia mentioned several times at the top of 
the home page.
Observers agree that including the most relevant keywords in the titles and 
headings of the web page is essential. In addition, pages that are updated 
with fresh content on a regular basis and are thus re-indexed frequently get 
good search placement.
	
Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com) does daily surveys of the keyword 
queries made to various search engines. It creates lists of the most popular 
search terms it finds. Those terms don’t likely apply to your e-commerce site, 
of course. But if you want to maximize the number of visits to your site or just 
to make your site more prominent in a list of search results, you should know 
what’s trendy and write your text accordingly.
Adding your site’s most important keyword to the URL is one solution to 
better search placement. But you can’t always do this. When it comes to key­
words, your job is to load your website with as many words as you can find 
that are relevant to what you sell. You can do this by:
	
✓	Burying keywords in the <meta> tag in the HTML for your home page 
so they won’t be visible to your visitors but do appear to the spider pro­
grams that index web pages (see the “Adding keywords to your HTML” 
section, later in this chapter).
	
✓	Adding keywords to the headings and initial body text on your pages. 
Check out the “Adding keywords to key pages” section, later in this 
chapter.
Adding keywords that are similar to your primary keywords helps with 
Microsoft’s relatively new search engine Bing (www.bing.com). Bing catego­
rizes its search results into a set of primary results and websites that are simi­
lar to the primary results. The latter results are presented in a column labeled 
Related Searches on the left side of a results page. By broadening the keywords 
you use on your pages, you increase your chances of turning up on Bing’s 
Related Searches area on more people’s search results. Find out more in 
Microsoft’s white paper “Bing: New Features Relevant to Webmasters” (http://
www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22140).
	
A keyword doesn’t have to be a single word. You can use a phrase containing 
two or more words. Think beyond single words to consider phrases people 
might enter when they’re trying to find products or services you’re offering.

260

Avoid piling a bunch of synonyms on the same page in an effort to boost page 
rank for your chosen keywords. For example, if your keywords are Boston chop 
house, don’t place “Boston steaks, Boston chops, Boston chophouse, Boston 
chop house” all in the same sentence or paragraph. According to the blog of 
Google employee Matt Cutts (www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-synonyms), 
Google’s algorithms are smart enough to identify this and nullify its effect.
Links help searchers connect to you
Keywords aren’t the only things that point search services to websites. Services 
like Google keep track of the number of links that point to a site. The more 
links, the higher that site’s ranking in a set of Google search listings. It’s 
especially good if the URLs that form the links use your keywords. Suppose 
your ideal keywords are Greg’s Shoe Store. The ideal URL choices would be 
www.gregsshoestore.com, www.gregsshoestore.biz, and so on. You 
could create the following HTML link to your e-commerce website on a per­
sonal web page, an eBay About Me page, or a Web Store on Amazon.com (see 
Chapter 14):
<a href=”http://www.gregsshoestore.com”> Visit Greg’s Shoe Store </a>
Such a link is doubly useful: A search service such as Google would find your 
desired keywords (“Greg’s Shoe Store”) in the visible, clickable link on your 
web page as well as in the HTML for the link.
Don’t forget the human touch
Search engines don’t work solely by means of computer programs that auto­
matically scour web pages and by paid advertisements. Computer programs 
are perceived as the primary source, but the human factor still plays a role. 
Yahoo!, one of the oldest search engines around, originally compiled its 
directory of websites by means of live employees. These days, its directory 
(dir.yahoo.com) isn’t as easy to find on Yahoo! as it once was. But editors 
still index sites and assign them to a New Additions category, which includes 
sites that are especially cool in someone’s opinion.
There’s almost no way to make sure that a human editor indexes your web­
site. The only thing you can do is to make your site as unique and content-
rich as possible. That helps your business not only show up in directories 
and search results, but also drum up more paying customers for you.
	
Having your site added to the Yahoo! Directory greatly increases your 
e-commerce site’s visibility. But Yahoo! charges a $299 fee for businesses 
that want to be included. Focus on free directories, like Bing and Google, and 
try to improve your visibility that way before you put down the big bucks.

261
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Taking the initiative: Paying for ads
You can’t get much better placement than right at the top of the first page 
of a set of search results or in a column on the right side. It’s even better if 
your site’s name and URL are highlighted in color. The only way to get such 
preferred treatment is to pay for it. And that’s just what a growing number 
of online businesses are doing — paying search engines to list their sites in a 
prominent location. See the “Paying for search listings can pay off” sidebar, 
later in this chapter, for more information.
Knowing who supplies the search results
Another important thing to remember about search engines is that they often 
gather results from other search services. You may be surprised to find that 
if you do a search of the web on America Online (AOL), your search results 
are primarily gathered from Google. That’s because AOL has a contract with 
Google to supply such results. Not only that, many search services are owned 
by parent search services. Just what are the most popular search services, 
and where do they get their results? A rundown appears in Table 11-1. The 
services are presented in rank order, beginning in the first row with Google, 
which is number 1. Rankings of the top five were reported by comScore 
Media Metrix in November 2006.

The important thing to note is that many of the most popular search engines 
receive their listings not from their own database of websites but from 
other search services. If you pay for a listing with Google, your ad is likely to 
appear not only on Google, but also on HotBot, Lycos, Teoma, AOL Search, 
and other places. By getting your site in the Yahoo! database, you’ll appear in 
Yahoo! search results as well as MSN Search.
	
These are by no means the only search services around. Other search engines 
focus on websites and Internet resources in specific countries. You can find 
more of them by going to Search Engine Watch (searchenginewatch.com) 
and clicking the Search Engine Listings link.
Going Gaga over Google
When it comes to search engines, Google is at the top of the heap. In fact, 
comScore Networks reports that approximately 67 percent of all search refer­
rals are done by Google. The closest competitor, Yahoo!, has about 12 per­
cent of the search market business.
Google is a runaway success thanks to its effectiveness. You’re simply more 
likely to find something on Google, more quickly, than you are on its competi­
tors. Any search engine placement strategy has to address Google first and 
foremost. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore Google’s competitors. Not 
long before this book was published, Microsoft came out with its own Internet 
search engine, Windows Live Search, which isn’t as nearly as popular or as 
reliable as Google, though Microsoft would probably love to give Google 
some real competition. 

263
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Googling yourself
To evaluate the quality of your search results placement on Google, start 
by taking stock of where you currently stand. That’s easily done: Just go to 
Google’s home page (www.google.com) and do a search for your own name 
or your business’s name (a pastime that’s also been called ego surfing). See 
where your website turns up in the results and also make note of which other 
sites mention yours.
Next, click Advanced Search or go directly to www.google.com/advanced_
search?hl=en. Under the heading Page-Specific Search, enter the URL for 
your e-commerce site in the Links text box and then click Search. The results 
that appear in a few seconds consist of websites that link to yours. The list 
suggests the kinds of sites you should approach to solicit links. It also sug­
gests the kinds of informational websites you might create to steer business 
to your website. (See the “Maximizing links” section, later in this chapter, for 
an example.)
Playing Google’s game to reach #1
Not long ago, some bloggers got together and decided to play a game called 
Google bombing. The game is simple: It consists of making links to a particu­
lar website in an attempt to get that site listed on Google. The more links the 
site has pointing to it, the higher that site appears in a set of search results. 
Of course, the links that are made all have to be connected with a particular 
keyword or phrase.
The Google game applies to your e-commerce website, too. Suppose you sell 
yo-yos, and your website URL is www.yoyoplay.com. (This is actually one of 
the sites run by Lars Hundley, the entrepreneur I profile in the “Paying for 
search listings can pay off” sidebar, later in this chapter.) The object is to get 
as many other websites as possible to link to this URL. The terms that a visitor 
clicks to get to this URL can be anything: yo-yos, play yo-yos, and so on. The 
more links you can make, the better your search results.
Getting started with Google AdWords
When most people think about search engine marketing, they immediately 
think about a single program: Google AdWords. AdWords revolutionized 
advertising on the web and, not incidentally, has made a fortune for Google 
as a company. What makes AdWords special is its do-it-yourself aspect, which 
puts a huge amount of control in the hands of individual businesspeople. You 
decide what programs to advertise; you specify how much you want to pay 
every time someone clicks one of your ads; you write the ads; you fine-tune 

264
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
your advertising programs to bid higher on those that are getting results and 
end the ones that aren’t getting much attention.
	
This section presents an introduction on how to get started with AdWords. It 
isn’t meant to be the last word on the subject. Entire books have been written 
about AdWords. Consult Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, 2nd Edition, 
by Peter Kent, or Building Your Business with Google For Dummies by Brad Hill.
Getting the big picture
AdWords is a service provided by Google that allows individuals and compa­
nies to take out ads that appear at the top or along the right-hand side of a 
page of Google search results. Do a search on Google right now, and you’ll 
see what I mean: They’re the ads enclosed in small boxes that contain links to 
websites. Perhaps you have clicked those ads yourself, perhaps not. The fact 
is that those ads are clicked hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of 
times every day. Every time someone clicks an ad, the person who placed the 
ad is charged a small fee by Google. (That’s why they’re called cost-per-click, 
or CPC, ads.)
If the “clicker” goes on to make a purchase on the website that is being adver­
tised, or if he or she fills out a form or takes out a new membership, the person 
who took out the AdWords ad (for the purposes of this discussion, I’ll call this 
person the affiliate) earns money in two possible ways. If your website is being 
advertised, you make money from the purchase. If you advertise someone else’s 
site and that site pays affiliates, you earn a referral fee. The exact fee varies 
from site to site. On eBay, a purchase can earn the affiliate a sizeable fee of 40 
percent or more. A new registration can earn the affiliate as much as $22. If 
that click cost 10 cents, that’s a huge profit — even if it takes a hundred clicks 
before someone takes one of the actions that earn the affiliate a referral fee.
One thing that makes AdWords effective is that the ads are targeted; they 
appear only on search results that are similar to the product or service being 
advertised. The connection between the advertiser and search results is 
made by keywords that the affiliate associates with the ad. If the affiliate is 
advertising a site that sells dog and cat supplies and specifies keywords like 
“dog food,” “cat collar,” “flea spray,” and the like, the ad appears when a web 
surfer searches for those terms. Another advantage is that you write the ad, 
and you specify how much you’ll pay for each click: You’re in control.
	
You might think that specifying common keywords is a good thing because 
it causes your advertised site to appear in its AdWords ad more often: More 
people likely search for “dog” or “cat” than “dog food” or “dog hip dysplasia,” 
for example. But your goal is to target your search and find just those shop­
pers who are hunting for what the advertiser wants. If 100,000 people view 
your ad with the keyword “dog” and only 2 clicks are made, the ad is ineffec­
tive. If 100 people view the ad for “dog flea collars” but 30 clicks are made and 
they lead to 10 purchases, you have a far more effective ad.

265
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Signing up for the service
Taking out an account with AdWords is the easy part. Before you start, you 
should decide what you want to advertise. For this example, I assume you’re 
advertising your own website. You can also advertise for someone else, as 
long as you’re willing to pay for the “clicks.”
You also need to obtain a Google account with a username and password. To 
do this, go to Google’s home page, click the Sign In link, and click the Create 
an Account Now link.
After you sign in, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to the Google Advertising Programs page.
	
	 Click Advertising Programs at the bottom of the home page, or go 
directly to www.google.com/ads.
	
2.	 Click Get Started beneath the Advertise on Google header to go to 
your page on the AdWords site.
	
3.	 Follow the steps shown on the screens that follow to finish creating 
your Google account.
After you set up an account on AdWords, you can move to the next step: 
advertising your products.
Writing AdWords ads
After you create an AdWords account, as described in the previous steps, the 
Welcome to AdWords window automatically appears, open to the Campaigns 
tab. When the Google AdWords page appears, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the green button labeled New Campaign. 
	
	A drop-down menu appears with options for where you want the ad to 
appear: Google’s search network or its display network.
	
2.	Choose Search & Display Networks for the widest coverage.
	
	 The Search & Display Networks - Standard page appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-1.
	
3.	In the Campaign name box, enter the name of the business you are 
advertising.
	
4.	Under Networks, make sure the networks where you want your ad to 
appear are checked.
	
5.	Under Devices, all types of computer devices that could display your 
ad (mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers) are chosen by 
default. If you don’t want your ad to be seen by mobile devices, for 
instance, click Switch to Legacy Campaign Settings, twice.

Figure 11-1: 
Name your

paign and

even if you 
are creating 
only one ad.
	
	
6.	Under Locations, click the button next to the countries where you 
want your ad to appear. 
	
7.	Under Bidding and Budget, specify how much you want to pay when­
ever someone clicks your ad.
	
	 It’s wise to set this amount low to begin with so you aren’t surprised 
by high charges. To be conservative, you might choose 10 cents per 
click and a limit of $10 per day, for instance. Or click the button next to 
AdWords will set my bids… to let AdWords set a per-click price for you.
	
8.	Under Ad Extensions, check the box next to any additional informa­
tion, such as your location or a phone number, that you want to add 
to your ad.
	
9.	When you’re done, click Save and Continue.
	
10.	In the Ad Group Name box, enter a name that describes your ad.
	
	 This name is only for your convenience and can be something as simple 
as Website Ad.
	
11.	Under the Create an Ad heading shown in Figure 11-2, type an atten­
tion-grabbing, click-inducing, action-producing ad for this product.
	
	 You have only 35 characters for each of the four lines to do so; you’ll see 
in a moment just how short a space that is.
	
12.	Type a heading (up to 35 characters including spaces) in the Headline 
box.

267
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
	
Figure 11-2:

13.	Write Description lines 1 and 2 (each up to 35 characters) in the boxes 
provided.
	
14.	In the box next to Display URL, type the URL that will appear in the 
body of the ad.
	
15.	In the Destination URL box, retype the same URL.
	
	 If you are advertising as an affiliate for a website like Amazon.com, this 
box will contain a complex link you need to obtain from Amazon.com. 
Here’s an example of an ad I wrote:
LP to CD Conversion
Restore scratchy old LPs, tapes
Price includes restoration, design
www.lp2cdsolutions.com
	
16.	When you’re done, scroll down to the Keywords section of the page, 
as shown in Figure 11-3.
	
17.	Choose keywords to accompany your ad.
	
	 You can use Google’s suggestions, which are presented on the 
Choose Keywords page. Or you can consult an online service such as 
Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com) for suggested keywords.
	
18.	When you’re done, click Save Ad Group.
	
	 You go to a page where you can review your ad and adjust your keywords, 
if needed.

keywords.
	
Eventually, you launch your campaign, which goes online in a matter of min­
utes if it meets Google’s review standards. After your ad is online, you can 
create variations and see which ones get the best results. It can be quite an 
entertaining game to see which of your ads gets lots of page views and which 
attracts clicks. Figure 11-4 shows a group of ads I prepared as an affiliate for 
Amazon.com.

 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Leaving a Trail of Crumbs
To improve your site’s search placement, make it easy for searchers to find 
you. Leave a trail of digital crumbs, add keywords to the HTML for your web 
pages, and make sure that your site is included in the most popular services 
databases.
Most web surfers don’t enter single words in search boxes. They tend to 
enter phrases. Combinations of keywords are especially effective. If you sell 
tools, don’t just enter tools as a keyword. Enter keywords such as tool box, 
power tool, tool caddy, pneumatic tool, and electric tool.
Adding keywords to your HTML
What keywords should you add to your site? Take an old-fashioned pencil 
and paper and write all the words you can think of that are related to your 
site, your products, your services, or you — whatever you want to promote, 
in other words. You might also consult a printed thesaurus or use one sup­
plied online at Dictionary.com (www.dictionary.com). Look up one term 
associated with your goods or services, and you’re likely to find a number of 
similar terms.
Where to put the <meta> tag
Every web page is enclosed by two specific tags: <html> and </html>. 
These tags define the page as being an HTML document. The <html> tag 
goes at the beginning of the document, and </html> goes at the end.
Between the <html> and </html> tags reside two main subdivisions of a 
web page:
	
✓	The header section: This section, enclosed by the <head> and </head> 
tags, is where the <meta> tags go.
	
✓	The body section: This section, enclosed by the <body> and </body> 
tags, is where the contents of the web page — the part you actually see 
onscreen — go.
You don’t have to include <meta> tags on every page on your site; in fact, 
your home page is the only page where doing so makes sense.
How to create a <meta> tag
The following steps show how to add your own <meta> tags from scratch to 
the source code of a web page by using Adobe Dreamweaver. These steps 
presume that you’ve already installed Internet Explorer and Dreamweaver, 
created your website’s home page, and saved it on your computer with a 

270
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
name like index.htm or index.html. To add <meta> tags to your site’s 
home page, start Dreamweaver and follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Code button in the toolbar near the top of the screen.
	
	 The code for your web page displays.
	
2.	Scroll to the top of your page’s source code, between the <head> and 
</head> tags, and enter your keywords and description.
	
	 Use the following format:
<meta name=”description” content=”Your short Web site description goes 
here.”>
<meta name=”keywords” content=”keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, and so on”>
	
	 The output is shown in Figure 11-5.
	
3.	Click the Design button to return to the design view of your web page.
	
	 Your additions aren’t visible on the web page because they’re intended 
for search engines, not visitors to your site.
	
4.	You can now make more changes to your page, or you can save your 
web page and then close Dreamweaver.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Insert your 
<meta> tags 
in the HEAD 
section of 
your HTML 
document.
	

271
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Most web page editors make this user friendly for you: You can type 
your information in specially designated boxes. Figure 11-6 shows 
Expression Web’s commands; open the page you want to edit by choosing 
File➪Properties, and type the words in the Keywords box. You can also type 
your official description in the Description box.
	
Figure 11-6: 
Some web 
page editors

to add key-
words and 
descriptions 
for search 
services to 
find.
	
You can also spy on your competitors’ websites to see if they added any 
keywords to their web pages by following these steps:
	
1.	Go to your competitor’s home page and choose View➪Source if you 
use Internet Explorer or right-click and choose View Page Source if 
you use Mozilla Firefox.
	
	 A new window opens, with the page source supplied.
	
2.	Scroll through the code, looking for the <meta> tags if they’re present.
	
	 (Press Ctrl+F, enter META, and click the Find button if you can’t find 
them on your own.)
	
	 If the page’s author used <meta> tags to enter keywords, you see them 
onscreen. They probably appear toward the top of the code.
	
3.	Note the keywords supplied and see if you can apply any to your 
website.
	
Keywords, like web page addresses, are frequently misspelled. Make sure that 
you type several variations on keywords that might be subject to typos — for 
example, Mississippi, Misissippi, Mississipi. Don’t worry about getting capital­
ization just right, however; most searchers simply enter all lowercase characters 
and don’t bother with capital letters at all.

272
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
The <meta> tag is also important for the Description command, which 
enables you to create a description of your website that search engines can 
index and use in search results. Some search services also scan the descrip­
tion for keywords, so make sure you create a description at the same time 
you type your keywords in the <meta> tags.
	
Don’t place too much importance on picking the ultimate, perfect keywords 
for use with your <meta> tags. They’re not all that effective anymore — not 
with search placement on Google, for example. Keeping your content updated 
and promoting links to other websites are just as effective.
. . . and don’t forget about Bing
The bulk of this chapter discusses SEO techniques that work with most search 
sites, especially Google. Google, after all, is still the “big dog” among search 
engines. But several reviews of Bing are very positive from the last few years, 
and when you’re leaving a trail of crumbs for your prospective customers to 
find you, you should keep Microsoft’s search service in mind, too.
A comparison of how Google and Bing handle SEO published on the blog 
SEOWizz.net finds that both take titles, keywords, links, and other factors 
into account when ranking websites in a set of search results. But two fac­
tors are considered more important by Bing: the age of your Internet domain 
(the .net or .com part of your URL) and the number of sites that link to 
you and that have your keywords in their title. (Google, in contrast, gives 
higher rank to sites that have your keywords in the body of their web pages.) 
So try to hold on to your domain, and cultivate links from sites that have 
titles with your favorite keywords in them. Find out more at www.seowizz.

Registering your site with Google
Google has a program — Googlebot — that automatically indexes web pages 
all over the Internet. However, you don’t have to wait for Googlebot to find 
your site: You can fill out a simple form that adds your URL to the sites 
indexed by this program. Go to www.google.com/addurl.html, enter 
your URL and a few comments about your site, and click the Add URL button. 
That’s all there is to it. Expect to wait a few weeks for your site to appear 
among Google’s search results if it doesn’t already appear there.
Getting listed on Yahoo!
If you want to get the most bang for your advertising buck, get your site listed 
on the most popular locations in cyberspace. For several years now, the many 

273
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
sites owned by Yahoo! have ranked in the top two or three most popular sites 
on the Internet in the Media Metrix Top 50 list of Web Properties published 
by comScore Media Metrix. Actually, Yahoo! was number two on the list in 
January 2013 (www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/2/
comScore_Media_Metrix_Ranks_Top_50_U.S._Web_Properties_for_
January_2013). Although many people think of Yahoo! primarily as a search 
engine, it’s also a categorical index to websites. Getting listed on Yahoo! means 
being included on one of its index pages. An index page is a list of websites 
grouped together by category, much like the traditional Yellow Pages.
Aside from its steadily increasing size and popularity, one thing that sets 
Yahoo! apart is the way it evaluates sites for inclusion on its index pages. For 
the most part, real human beings do the Yahoo! indexing; they read your site 
description and your suggested location, and then determine what category 
to list your site under. Usually, Yahoo! lists sites in only one or two catego­
ries, but if Yahoo! editors feel that a site deserves its own special category, 
they create one for it.
The Yahoo! editors don’t even attempt to process all the thousands of site 
applications they receive each week. Reports continue to circulate on the 
web as to how long it takes to get listed on Yahoo! and how difficult it is to 
get listed at all. The process can take weeks, months, or even years. Danny 
Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, estimates that only about a quarter 
of all sites that apply get listed. That’s why Yahoo! has instituted an Express 
listing system — your business site is reviewed in exchange for a nonrefund­
able annual fee of $299 — although there’s still no guarantee you’ll get listed. 
Find out more at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/helpcentral.
	
Search Engine Watch (searchenginewatch.com) is a great place to go for 
tips on how search engines and indexes work and how to get listed on them.
Paying for Yahoo! Search Marketing
What can you do to get listed on Yahoo!? You can always sign up for Yahoo!’s 
paid search option (also called sponsored search), Yahoo! Search Marketing 
(http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/searchmarketing/en_SG/
index). Paid search won’t get you listed in the Yahoo! Directory, but it does 
ensure with some measure of certainty that you’ll at least appear in search 
results on the site.
What sets Yahoo! Search Marketing apart is that an editorial team reviews 
your keywords and ads, much like the website listings at Yahoo!. Google 
AdWords listings are also reviewed thoroughly, but the results come back in 
a matter of seconds and appear to be automated. Yahoo! Search Marketing 
originally used Google’s search technology but developed its search market­
ing system based on companies, like Inktomi and Overture, that it began 
purchasing after 2002. Yahoo! is a notable search engine because its search 
results mix organic results and paid listings, and the paid ads appear at the 
top, along the right, and at the bottom of a results page.

Listing in the Yahoo! index
If you want to appear in the Yahoo! Directory, I have a three-step suggestion:
	
1.	Make your site interesting, quirky, or somehow attention-grabbing.
	
	 You never know; you may just stand out from the sea of new websites 
and gain the attention of one of the Yahoo! editors.
	
2.	Go ahead and try applying to the main Yahoo! index.
	
	 You can at least say you tried!
	
a.	Go to www.yahoo.com, find the category page that you think 
should list your site, and click the Submit Your Site link at the 
bottom of the page.
	
	The Yahoo! Submit Your Site page appears.
	
b.	Click the Yahoo! Standard link.
	
c.	Verify that the Yahoo! category shown is the one in which you 
want to be included and then click Continue.
	
d.	On the form that appears, provide your URL and a description for 
your site.
	
	Make your description as interesting as possible while remaining 
within the content limit. (If you submit a description that’s too 
long, Yahoo! asks you to revise it.)
	
3.	Try a local Yahoo! index.
	
	 Major areas around the country as well as in other parts of the world, 
have their own Yahoo! indexes. Go to http://local.yahoo.com to 
browse by city. Find the local index closest to you and apply it, as I 
describe in the preceding step. You have a much better chance of get­
ting listed locally than on the main Yahoo! site.
	
Improve your listing on Yahoo! by shelling out anywhere from $25–$300 or more 
per year to become a sponsored website. Your site is listed in the Sponsored 
Sites box at the top of a Yahoo! category. The exact cost depends on the popu­
larity of the category. There is life beyond Yahoo!, too. Several web-based 
services are trying to compete by providing their own way of organizing and 
evaluating websites. Try submitting a listing to Best of the Web (http://botw.
org) or contact one of the guides employed by About.com (www.about.com).
Getting listed with other search services
Search services can steer lots of business to a commercial website, based on 
how often the site appears in the list of web pages that the user sees and how 
high the site appears on the list. Your goal is to maximize your site’s chances 
of being found by the search service. But Google is hard to crack, and Yahoo! 

275
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
charges for commercial sites that want to be listed. What about other search 
services?
Not so long ago, search services allowed you to list your site for free. After 
that, services adopted policies that guaranteed listings in their index only 
if you paid a subscription fee. These days, the preeminence of Google and 
Yahoo! has changed the playing field. Some services have consolidated; 
others “borrow” the search technology used by the competition. And only a 
few search services provide you with a Submit Your Site or an Add a URL link 
that enables you to include your site in their index.
	
Microsoft’s Bing lets you submit your site by entering its URL at www.bing.
com/toolbox/submit-site-url.
One of the few sites that allows individuals to submit personal or commercial 
websites for addition in its index is the Open Directory Project (www.dmoz.
org/add.html). The advantage is that other well-known search services 
(AOL Search, Google, Netscape Search, and Yahoo! Search) use Open 
Directory data to update and augment their own databases. After you get 
your site in the Open Directory, anywhere from a few days to a few weeks 
later, you’ll likely see it appear in other directories as well.
Follow these steps to submit your site to the Open Directory:
	
1.	Connect to the Internet, start your web browser, and go to the Open 
Directory home page at www.dmoz.org.
	
	 The ODP – Open Directory Project home page appears.
	
2.	Enter the name of the site you want to add in the box at the top of the 
page and click Search.
	
	 A set of search results appears.
	
3.	Check to see whether your site is already included in the directory.
	
	If it isn’t, scan the search results for the category “tree” that appears at 
the end of each listing, and find the category that fits your own site. A 
category tree looks like this:
Regional: North America: United States: Business and Economy: Shopping: 
Sporting Goods
	
4.	Click the category tree.
	
	 The Category page on the Open Directory appears.
	
5.	Click the Suggest URL link near the top of the Category page.
	
	 The Submission form appears.
	
	 Not all categories in the Open Directory include Suggest URL links. If you 
don’t see one, that particular category doesn’t allow submissions. But 
others will: Click a more specific subcategory to suggest your site.

276
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
6.	Type the URL and a brief but specific description for your site and 
then click Submit.
	
	 Your page is submitted to one of the Open Directory staff members 
who reviews it to decide whether the site is suitable for inclusion in the 
directory. It may take several weeks for your site to be added.
Paying for search listings can pay off
Listing with search sites is growing more complex 
all the time. Many sites are owned by other sites. 
On top of that, you can list your products on shop­
ping aggregation sites. You can make the consoli­
dation of search sites work to your advantage by 
choosing a few services carefully: You can then 
find your business listed with many other sites.
Lars Hundley, who in 1998 started his first online 
store, Clean Air Gardening, has received lots 
of publicity thanks to energetic marketing and 
good use of search engine resources. He’s also 
had great success with a site that’s not often 
regarded as a search engine: YouTube. “I use 
Yahoo! Search Marketing and Google AdWords. 
I also sometimes use shopping aggregation 
sites, like Yahoo! Shopping, Shopzilla, and 
Shopping.com.” Sales were down in 2009, so he 
is closely watching AdWords spending to make 
sure “we are generating a profit and not paying 
too much for each sale we generate.” He 
hosts Clean Air Gardening (www.cleanair
gardening.com) and other e-commerce 
sites with Yahoo! Small Business, a storefront 
solution I describe in Chapter 15. Other informa­
tional sites are hosted on his own web server.

277
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Hundley uses many of the search engine 
placement tools that I mention in this chapter. 
He says, “I also use tools, like Wordtracker to 
make sure that I use important keywords in all 
my product descriptions. I always try to name 
and describe things in the words that people 
are searching for, and I think that really pays 
off over time.”
Hundley points out that YouTube is the fifth-
most-popular website around, according to 
Hitwise (www.experian.com/hitwise/
online-trends.html). “YouTube has been 
a phenomenal success for us and has been our 
most successful new marketing technique in 
the last two or three years,” he comments. “We 
shoot short videos for all of our major products, 
demonstrating the product in action. We use a 
$600 Canon HD camcorder, and edit them on 
a Mac using iMovie or Final Cut Pro. Then we 
upload the movie to YouTube. We embed the 
YouTube video directly on our product page. So 
when someone is reading about the product, 
they can just click Play on the video and watch 
it.” An example is shown below.
Hundley uses his journalism experience to write 
and distribute his own press releases and pitch 
articles to magazines, such as U.S. News and 
World Report, The Wall Street Journal, and 
This Old House. He also has an e-mail market­
ing campaign: “With Clean Air Gardening, I use 
Constant Contact to manage an e-mail news­
letter that I send out every two weeks. I have 
approximately 25,000 subscribers. I use the 
newsletter to give gardening tips and promote 
my products at the same time — the tips are 
informational, but they also show how you can 
use Clean Air Gardening products for more suc­
cessful gardening.”
Hundley gives the following advice to budding 
entrepreneurs: “If you’re thinking about start­
ing your own Internet business, just do it! Start 
a small site and do it in your spare time to test 
the waters. I kept my day job for the first year 
when I started this business, until it started to 
take off and make money. Now, 11 years later, 
it is a multimillion-dollar-a-year company with 
14 employees and a large 14,000-square-foot 
warehouse and office. You can do it too, if you 
try!” It’s hard to argue with success: Hundley 
reports that Clean Air Gardening was named 
one of the 5,000 fastest-growing companies by 
Inc. magazine in 2008 and 2009.

278
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
Businesses on the web can get obsessed with how high their sites appear on 
the list of search results pages. If a web surfer enters the exact name of a site 
in the HotBot or WebCrawler search text box, for example, some people just 
can’t understand why that site doesn’t come back at the top — or even on the 
first page — of the list of returned sites. Of the millions of sites listed in a search 
service’s database, the chances are good that at least one has the same name 
as yours (or something close to it), or that a page contains a combination of the 
same words that make up your organization’s name. Don’t be overly concerned 
with hitting the top of the search-hit charts. Concentrate on creating a top-
notch website and making sales.
Adding keywords to key pages
Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to add keywords to the HTML for your 
web pages. Visitors don’t normally see those keywords, unless they view 
the source code for your web page. Other keywords can be added to parts 
of your web page that are visible — parts of the page that programs called 
crawlers or spiders scan and index:
	
✓	The title: Be sure to create a title for your page. The title appears in the 
title bar at the top of the browser window. Many search engines index 
the contents of the title because it appears not only at the top of the 
browser window, but at the top of the HTML, too.
	
✓	The headings: Your web page’s headings should be specific about what 
you sell and what you do.
	
✓	The first line of text: Some search services index every word on every 
page, but others limit the amount of text they index. So the first lines 
might be indexed, but others aren’t. Get your message across quickly; 
pack your first sentences with nouns that list what you have for sale.
The best way to ensure that your site gets indexed is to pack it with useful 
content. I’m talking about textual content: Search programs can’t view 
photos, animations, or sounds. Make sure your pages contain a significant 
amount of text as well as these other types of content.
	
Websites that specialize in SEO talk about keyword density: the number of 
keywords on your page, multiplied by the number of times each one is used. 
Keyword density is a way to gain a good search engine ranking. In other words, 
if you sell shoes and you use ten different terms once, you won’t get as good 
a ranking as you would when using six or seven words twice or a handful of 
well-chosen keywords several times each.

279
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Making your pages easy to index
Sometimes, the key to making things work is simply not putting roadblocks 
in the way of success. The way you format web pages can prevent search 
services from recording your text and the keywords you want your customers 
to enter. Avoid these obvious hindrances:
	
✓	Your text begins too far down the page. If you load the top of your 
page with images that can’t be indexed, your text is indexed that much 
slower, and your rankings suffer.
	
✓	Your pages are loaded with Java applets, animations, and other 
objects that can’t be indexed. Content that slows down the automatic 
indexing programs reduces your rankings, too.
	
✓	Your pages don’t actually include the ideal keyword phrase you want 
your searchers to use. If you have a business converting LP records to 
CDs, you want the phrase LP to CD or convert LPs to CDs somewhere on 
your home page and on other pages as well.
	
Every image on your web page can and should be assigned a textual label (also 
known as ALT text because the alt element in HTML enables it to be used). The 
label tells visitors what the image depicts in case it can’t be displayed in the 
browser window. (ALT text is actually required by the W3 Consortium to make 
sites more accessible;  see www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT for more infor­
mation.) As a trick to produce more keyword density, you can assign keywords 
or keyword phrases to these names instead.
Maximizing links
Along with keywords, search engines use hyperlinks to index a site and 
include it in a database. By controlling two types of links, you can provide 
search services with more information about the contents of your site:
	
✓	The hyperlinks contained in your web pages
	
✓	The links that point to your site from other locations around the web
The “Links help searchers connect to you” section, earlier in this chapter, 
mentions the links in your own web pages. One of the most effective tricks 
for increasing the number of links that point to your online store is to create 
several different websites, each pointing to that store. That’s just what Lars 
Hundley did with his main e-commerce site, Clean Air Gardening (www.clean
airgardening.com). “Creating my own network of gardening sites that 
provide quality information helps me rise to the top of the search engines in 

280
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
many categories,” he says. “People find the content sites sometimes and click 
through to Clean Air Gardening to buy related products.”
It’s true: Do an Advanced Search on Google for sites that link to www.clean
airgardening.com. First, some sites, like the following, are just a sampling 
that link to Clean Air Gardening and that aren’t run by Hundley:
	
✓	National Gardening Association (www.garden.org)
	
✓	Garden Tool Buyer’s Resource (www.gardentoolguide.com)
	
✓	Master Composter (www.mastercomposter.com)
	
✓	Organic Gardening (www.organicgardening.com)
You might also find these sites farther down in the search results that are run 
by Hundley:
	
✓	Gardening Guide (www.gardenplantcare.com)
	
✓	Organic Pest Control (www.organicgardenpests.com)
	
✓	Reel Mower Guide (www.reelmowerguide.com)
	
✓	Organic Garden Tips (www.organicgardentips.com)
	
✓	CompostGuide.com (www.compostguide.com)
	
✓	Rain Barrel Guide (www.rainbarrelguide.com)
Hundley solicits links for the sites he doesn’t run himself. “I also exchange 
links with other high-ranking related sites, both to improve my rankings and 
to provide quality links for my visitors. If you stick with quality links, you 
can never go wrong.” For more about Hundley and how he uses the Overture 
search network to help users find him on the web, see the “Paying for search 
listings can pay off” sidebar, earlier in this chapter.
Monitoring Traffic: The Science 
of Web Analytics
How do you increase the number of times search engines find your site? 
One way is to analyze the traffic that comes to your site, a practice often 
called web analytics. When it comes to search engine placement, the type of 
research you need to perform is log file analysis, which can tell you exactly 
what keywords were used already to find your site. You can then combine 
those words into new keyword phrases, ideally helping even more people 
find your site. You can get software that does the analysis for you or you can 
do it yourself. I briefly describe each way in this section.

281
 Chapter 11: Search Engine Optimization
Software to improve SEO
Some software options are specifically designed to help improve SEO. Such 
programs can help you by counting the number of keywords on a web page. 
Others analyze the links that point at the page and helps you determine the 
best keywords, where to locate them, and what specific text can make the 
links rank higher in Google’s search results. Another common feature is the 
ability to monitor competing web pages to see what they do for SEO that 
you don’t. You’ll find a good selection of programs under the heading SEO 
Software on the Mike’s Marketing Tools website (www.mikes-marketing-
tools.com/directory/seo-software.html).
	
Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics) is one of the most useful 
tools you can have for studying who comes to your site and how they get 
there. Not only that, but it’s free. Find out more in Chapter 14.
Do-it-yourself options
The other, more labor-intensive way to analyze what drives visitors to your 
website is through analysis of log files. A log file is an electronic document 
that a web server compiles as a record of every visit made to a web page, 
image, or other object on a site. Most web hosting services let you look at 
the log file for your website. The log file gives you a rough idea of where your 
visitors are from and which resources on your website are visited the most. 
By focusing on particular types of log file data, you can evaluate how visitors 
find your site and which search services are doing the best job of directing 
visitors to you.
If you look at log file information in its raw text form, you’re probably mysti­
fied by page after page of numbers and techie gibberish. Log files typically 
record information, such as the IP address and the domain name of the com­
puter that accesses a web page. They don’t tell you the name and address 
of the person using the machine at the time. They give you an idea of where 
the computer is located geographically, based on the suffix at the end of a 
domain name (such as .de for Germany or .fr for France). You probably 
need to use a log file analyzer, Webtrends (www.webtrends.com), which 
presents the data in a format that is easy to interpret.
When you’re viewing log files, one important thing to track is referrer reporting, 
which gives you the site the visitor was viewing just before coming to yours. 
This tells you what sites are directing visitors to yours. Note the search engines 
that appear most frequently; these are the ones you need to work on when it 
comes to improving your placement in sets of search results.

L

ocal is where most people still shop. Rather than reaching for their 
computing device, they walk or drive down the street or around the 
corner and go into a store near where they live.
If you have a local presence through a brick-and-mortar store, a mall space, 
or a market stall, you need to reach customers who take the time and effort 
to walk or drive to you and make a purchase. But as you’ve learned elsewhere 
in this book, more and more consumers are shopping using mobile devices. 
They’re searching online rather than picking up the phone book or the ad 
supplement of the newspaper.
As a local businessperson, you need to reach your customers where they are. 
These days that’s not always done by catching someone’s eye as he or she 
is walking down the street. This chapter, which is primarily targeted at small 
businesses that have a brick-and-mortar presence, explores some of the 
exciting new options for enticing online shoppers to walk through the door 
and explore your real, live physical store.
Listing Yourself in All the Right Places
I don’t know about you, but when the Yellow Pages is left on my doorstep 
(without my having asked for it), it goes straight into the recycling bin. I 
haven’t looked at one in years. When I need to find a store (a real, local store 
with a street address), I whip out my smartphone and Google it. When the 

284
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
store shows up on Google, I can map it and then head out the door. When my 
wife and I need to choose a restaurant, we turn to Yelp and read the reviews 
(they also have maps and hours).
For you, the businessperson sitting behind the counter, this means you need to 
get on the right places where people like me can find you. Savvy store managers 
whose clients tend to be young and use smartphones put themselves in more 
than one location. In an article I wrote for EcommerceBytes on how to reach 
local buyers, I talked to Mike LoCarto, a web developer with Natural Body, 
Inc. (www.naturalbodyinc.com), which operates several brick-and-mortar 
stores in the New York City area. Mike makes sure his site is listed in all the 
places where fitness-conscious consumers look for vitamins and supplements 
online. Natural Body’s Google+ page is shown in Figure 12-1. He also lists the 
site on several of the directories described later in this chapter.
The first group of places you need to know about is online directories where 
people are likely to search for and find you. You don’t have to look far to find 
those places — just keep reading!

Inviting Yelpers
You’ve probably used Yelp (www.yelp.com) as a consumer. It’s a site that 
posts reviews and details about businesses located in metropolitan areas 
in the United States and other countries. You look for restaurants and other 

285
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
businesses by entering locations or keywords (for example, “downtown Thai 
restaurant”) and read consumer reviews.
As a businessperson, you’ve got to make sure your store or physical location 
is listed on Yelp and that your listing contains accurate, basic information 
about you, starting with your address, hours, and contact information.
I’ve read both positive and negative comments about Yelp. Many comments 
are concerned with whether the reviews are genuine. In an effort to ensure 
that the reviews are posted by real consumers and not business owners or 
their friends or family, Yelp screens the reviews and rejects any that seem 
suspicious. When I set up a Yelp listing for my acupuncturist friend Allan 
Guilpain, several of his real-life customers, including me, had a tough time 
submitting reviews; several were “bounced” from the site for no clear reason.
If Yelp reviews are subjective and not always reliable, why should you go 
through the effort (and there is some effort involved) of getting listed on it? 
For one thing, Yelp attracts 100 million users around the world. For another, 
nearly half of its visitors are mobile users, according to Venture Beat (venture.
com/2012/11/01/yelp-mobile-searches). Besides that, Yelp has become 
the most recognizable name in its field; it’s so well known that many people 
automatically think of it when they are looking for a local business.
	
Yelp reviews can be unreliable; the company responded in fall 2012 to fraudu­
lent reviews by “naming and shaming” the companies that paid for them. An 
article in Ad Age (adage.com/article/digital/fake-reviews-rise-
yelp-crack-fraudsters/237486) estimated that as few as 20 percent of 
reviews submitted to the site actually get posted because of Yelp’s stringent 
review policies.
	
Yelp makes money, in part, through advertising. Businesses can pay a fee to 
Yelp to show up higher in search results. Even if you have the most popular 
baseball card store in your area, you might not come out on top unless you 
pay for search placement in the manner of Google AdWords. You decide how 
much you want to pay every time someone clicks one of your ads.
To create a Yelp listing, you follow a process that you’ll hear about a lot in this 
chapter. First, you find your business by doing a search on the site. Then you 
click a link labeled Claim This Site and fill out information about the business. 
The data you enter has to be reviewed and approved by Yelp, however. When 
you update your site by editing a form such as the one shown in Figure 12-2, 
you are also required to have the changes approved by Yelp before they go 
online.

286
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
Figure 12-2: 
To ensure 
accuracy, 
Yelp 
approves 
all changes 
and 
reviews.
	
Once you have a listing on Yelp, you help customers to find you. You can give 
them an incentive to return to your Yelp listing (a process known as checking 
in) by offering gifts and deals. The notion of checking in and offering incen­
tives takes on a whole new sense of importance when it comes to the next 
venue you need to exploit: Foursquare (which is discussed later in this chap­
ter, in the “Marketing Yourself with Check-Ins and Offers” section).
	
Location-based services compete with one another for the most detailed listings, 
reviews, and tips of businesses in the geographical areas they cover. If your 
store has a street address, you probably already have a location on the service 
(often called a page) on those services. To do this kind of marketing, your job 
is to claim as many pages as possible.
Claiming your page on Google 
Places for Business
If you’ve ever Googled yourself, you know you already exist on Google. If you 
have a brick-and-mortar location, that’s already on Google too. (It’s likely 
the folks who take photos for Google Earth have even photographed your 
facility, too.)
Try it now. Do a search for your business so you can claim it as your own:
	
1.	Go to Google Maps (maps.google.com).
	
2.	Type your business name in the search box and press Enter.
	
	 You may need to enter your street address and city to distinguish your 
business from others with similar names.

Any businesses you have submitted and claimed can now be marketed by 
you on Google. You can create Google AdWords ads so they get better place­
ment in search results, for example.

Yahoo! You’re on Yahoo! Local
Yahoo! is one of the oldest indexes to the Internet, and it has always been 
a wonderful place to find businesses in your local area or across the sea. A 
Yahoo! Local listing gives you a chance to publish your business details and 
descriptions in the Yahoo! Directory. Listings can take one of two forms:
	
✓	Basic Listings: These are free and include your hours of operation, 
products sold, website URL, and other details.
	
✓	Enhanced Listings: These are paid listings (they cost $9.95 per month) 
that can include photos, a longer description, performance reports, and 
more.
To list your business on Yahoo! Local, go to the Local Listings Sign-up page 
(listings.local.yahoo.com/overview.php) and click the Sign Up 
button. Sign in with your Yahoo! ID and password (you’ll need one to initiate 
the process) and follow the steps shown on subsequent screens.
Yahoo! Local is another place to get your business listed — and more impor­
tantly, found — on the Internet. Yahoo! is not as prominent as it once was, and 

289
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
not as widely used as Google, but if you want to maximize your coverage you 
should take the time to add your business there, at least with a Basic Listing.
	
Do a search for your business, or your type of business, in your local area on 
Google, Yahoo! Local, and Bing Local to compare their levels of coverage and 
to get an idea of who your competitors are.
In order for a business to be on Yahoo! Local, it must be located in the United 
States and the website must be in English. Check the Yahoo! Help pages 
(help.yahoo.com) for more requirements.
Reaching locals with Bing’s help
In recent surveys of search engine use, Google remained the clear leader, but 
Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, was a clear second on the list, so it’s worth 
considering if you want online shoppers to find you. Bing currently has two 
ways for local businesses to be found: a Bing Local directory that resembles 
Yahoo!’s, and Bing Places for Business, which enables owners or managers to 
claim their businesses, like Google Places for Business.
At this writing, Bing Places for Business was labeled as being in “beta” or trial 
period. But all its features were working, and one of them was the ability to 
promote a business online by offering deals, including a loyalty program.
Getting listed on the Bing Local directory is free. Go to www.bing.com/
local/us, click Add or Change Your Business Listing, and then follow the 
steps described in the “Offering ‘punch-card’ check-ins with Bing” section, 
later in this chapter.
Reaching your neighbors on Patch
Patch is a network of local news and information sites across the United 
States. If you live in a rural or suburban area, you might be covered by a local 
version of Patch; go to www.patch.com, and look through the list of states 
covered to see if your area or a nearby town is included.
If Patch does cover your area, it makes sense to make sure your business 
appears in the Patch Places directory. Patch Places isn’t a website, but an 
app you can download for the iPhone and Android platforms.
	
You can download the Patch Places app from www.patch.com/mobile, from 
Google Play, or from iTunes.

290
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
To get started, search for your business on the app. Once you find it, click 
the Claim Your Listing link. Enter your business information in the form that 
appears. Submit the information to Patch and wait for Patch to contact you 
to verify that you are the business owner or manager. Once you are verified, 
you gain a Manage Your Listing button at the top of your listing page. Click 
this button to edit and update your business information.
If your business is not already listed on Patch Places, e-mail Patch at directory
support@patch.com and ask to be added.
Marketing Yourself with 
Check-Ins and Offers
You’ve probably received one of those “punch cards” that give you a free 
coffee after you’ve made ten coffee purchases at the local cafe. It feels good 
to get that free coffee, doesn’t it? If you’re a member at Costco, you might 
receive a check once a year for cash back from purchases. It keeps you going 
to Costco, doesn’t it, even though you still have to pay a yearly membership 
fee to get those rewards?
Customer loyalty is the ultimate goal for any business, whether online or 
off. A number of innovative web-based services bring loyalty and rewards 
programs within the reach of small brick-and-mortar businesses. They take 
such programs to a new level by adding the sophistication of GPS and smart­
phones. The system works like this.
You’re walking down the street and, if you have configured your phone to do 
so, it notifies you that you’re near the Fabulous Cupcakes bakery. You have 
checked in to Fabulous Cupcakes and are, in fact, considered a “mayor” of 
the site on Foursquare (which is described in the next section). You check in 
on your phone, and you can stop in for a free cupcake because of your past 
loyalty. The business has even provided you with a parking space because 
of your status as a “star” customer. Passersby see the parking sign and get 
to know that you’re doing location-based marketing. This scenario can easily 
build you a steady stream of long-term walk-in customers. This section 
describes some venues that can help you market to a local clientele.
Tracking nearby shoppers with Foursquare
Consumers who routinely use mobile devices for searching and shopping will 
check in with you routinely if you give them an incentive to do so. The incen­
tive takes the form of an offer that can benefit everyone; the more frequently 
you visit, the more benefits you get. Foursquare (www.foursquare.com), 

291
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
the most popular of the venues that do location-based marketing, is a perfect 
marketing venue for businesses whose clientele use smartphones on a regular 
basis.
Foursquare works like this:
	
1.	 People “check in” by telling Foursquare where they are. They might say 
they’re at a particular coffee shop, hotel, museum, or restaurant.
	
2.	 Foursquare, in turn, tells those you have identified as your friends on 
the platform where you are, and recommends other places those friends 
might visit or things they can do nearby.
	
3.	 You and your friends can meet up if you’re near one another.
	
4.	 Most important, from the standpoint of the brick-and-mortar business 
owner, you and your friends learn about what your favorite locations are 
and new places you might like to discover.
To get started with Foursquare, set up an account on its business page 
(business.foursquare.com). Click Learn More and then click Claim Your 
Business. Follow the steps on the Claim your business page.
Once you have an account on Foursquare, you can look around your current 
location to see other businesses that are taking advantage of the service and 
making offers. In my area, the historic Music Box Theatre is offering a free 
small popcorn to those who check in four times in one month, as shown in 
Figure 12-5.

292
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
To get in the game and start developing your own loyalty programs, search 
on Foursquare for your business. If your business is already listed on 
Foursquare, click the link that allows you to claim it. If it’s not, you need to 
add it. How do you add your business? I found this to be quite nonintuitive. I 
finally figured out how to do it on the Foursquare Android app:
	
1.	Click Check In.
	
	 A list of businesses in your current area where you can check in appears.
	
2.	Click the Search icon (the magnifying glass) and search for your 
business.
	
	 If your business doesn’t appear, go to Step 3.
	
3.	Scroll to the bottom of the search results and click Not Listed? Add 
This Place to Check In Here.
	
	 The Add New Place screen appears, shown in Figure 12-6.
	
4.	Type in the basic details: the category and address.
	
5.	Click Add New Place.
Once you have added your business, do a search for it. When it turns up in 
the search results, click its hyperlinked name. A page with details appears. 
At the bottom of the right column, after “Do you manage this location?”, click 
Claim Here. On the next page, enter information about yourself and provide 
your phone number. You’ll receive a phone call from Foursquare and infor­
mation on how to verify your position with the business.

293
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
After you have claimed your business, you can start offering promotions 
to those who check in to your business. To check in, they have to visit 
your facility in person and show you that they have checked in using the 
Foursquare app on their smartphone. But because they’ve walked through 
the door, the odds that they’ll make a purchase go up dramatically. But at the 
very least, you should gain more attention as notifications about the check-
ins spread through Foursquare — a form of free advertising.
	
This section only provides an introduction to Foursquare. For more detailed 
information on how this service can help your business, read Location-Based 
Marketing For Dummies, by Aaron Strout and Mike Schneider.
Don’t worry if your store doesn’t show up right away on Foursquare (or on 
other services mentioned in this chapter, for that matter). In many cases, the 
sites where visitors “check in” most frequently show up first in search results.
Checking in with customers 
at Facebook Places
Facebook is another big player in location-based marketing; if you have a 
Facebook presence for your business, it follows naturally that you should 
create a Facebook Place as well. Once you have claimed your location as a 
Place, you can do the kind of marketing described later in this chapter, in 
“Connecting with Locals with Interactive Content.”
The process is similar to that for Google Places for Business: First you find 
your business’s Facebook page, if it already exists, or create a new Facebook 
page for it if necessary. To create a new Facebook page for your business, 
go to www.facebook.com/pages/create/ and click the Local business or 
place option. 
As you learn in Chapter 13, the Local business or place option is one of six 
different types of Facebook pages. After you create a page for your business 
in this form, you can claim it. Once you claim it, you can act as its administra­
tor and track visits and comments or delete inappropriate posts. To claim your 
page, find it on Facebook and then click the icon that looks like a gear and that 
has a down arrow next to it. (It appears next to the Messages button.) Choose 
Is This Your Business? from the drop-down menu that appears. Follow the 
instructions on subsequent screens to claim your business. 
One of the advantages of having a “Local business or place” page is that visitors 
can check in. But to enable check ins, you’ve got to specify a location. It’s a 
good idea to add other general information, as well, so prospective customers 

294
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
can find out more about you. To add your location and information, first 
find your business page on Facebook. Either open the Facebook Home app 
on your tablet or mobile device, or go to the mobile version of Facebook at 
touch.facebook.com. Once there, do a search for your page. During the 
process, you’ll add some basic information about your business — its name, 
the address, and a description (the description is optional, but a good idea). 
Once you have claimed your business page, not only can others check in, 
but you can add or edit your business information at any time. Perhaps more 
importantly, you prevent your competitors or others from claiming the page 
and taking control of it, which occasionally happens. 
Other location-based marketing services that serve niche audiences might 
be perfect depending on what you want to sell. These include Gowalla 
(www.gowalla.com), which encourages explorations and storytelling, and 
SCVNGR (www.scvngr.com), which lets businesses set up virtual scavenger 
hunts.
Offering “punch-card” 
check-ins with Bing
As mentioned in the preceding section, Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, is 
getting in the location-based marketing game by giving businesses a chance 
to list themselves in the Bing Local business directory and by offering 
promotions.
Bing Places for Business is free and works just like Google Places for Business. 
One difference with Bing is that it offers customer support via live chat 
between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Pacific time Monday through Saturday. You can 
“talk” to a representative about claiming your listing or offering promotions.
	
Once you’re listed on Bing Local, you can market your business with Microsoft 
adCenter (https://secure.bingads.microsoft.com), which is the 
rough equivalent of Google AdWords.
To get started, go to www.bingplaces.com/ and click Get Started. When 
the Find Your Listing page appears, search for your business. If it does not 
appear, click Add New Listing. You’ll need to sign in with your Hotmail or 
Microsoft account, or create a new one if you don’t already have one. After 
you sign in, you go to a page that functions as a dashboard and lists any busi­
nesses you have added to Bing, as shown in Figure 12-7.

295
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
	
Figure 12-7: 
This dash-
board-style 
screen let 
you create 
and claim 
your busi-
ness listing, 
and offer 
deals.
	
	
Adding your business is easy. Go to the dashboard page and make sure the 
My Businesses icon is selected. Then click the plus sign (+) next to the search 
box in the left column. Fill out the form with your business information and 
click Search. If your business is found, you’re already in the Bing directory. If 
not, fill in the details in the dashboard and verify you are the owner to claim 
the business.
First, click your business name on the left side of the screen. A set of options 
appears: Details, More, Profile, Mobile, Photos, Preview, Verification, and 
Create. Click each of these options and fill in your business details to create a 
full Bing listing. In the Verification section, you verify that you are the owner 
of the business.
Once you have claimed your business, you can offer deals. Click the business 
you want to promote, and click the Deals icon in the dashboard. As you can see 
in Figure 12-8, you can offer either group deals or basic deals for a business. 
Group deals are Groupon-like promotions that take effect only if a certain 
number of consumers signs on to them. Basic deals can be promoted with a 
loyalty program. A mobile app is available that allows people to click a virtual 
“punch card” whenever they check in to your business. This enables you to 
offer promotions that take effect only when a certain level of loyalty has been 
reached: when someone has checked in five times, for example.

Connecting with Locals with 
Interactive Content
No matter where you list your business and claim your online page describ­
ing that business, you need to take advantage of the new exposure. Although 
you can certainly take the passive approach to marketing and wait for cus­
tomers to find you organically by searching for you, you can entice them to 
visit (or encourage them to visit regularly) by making them some attractive 
offers.
Come up with a long-range plan for what you want to offer those who check 
in with you, not just once, but on a regular basis. You don’t necessarily have 
to give price discounts; the point is to make your visitors feel valued. Some 
suggestions for offers that you can make on an ongoing basis follow.
Keep your customers coming back
You don’t have to give something on a first check-in. A single visit doesn’t 
necessarily give you income. Offers are more effective if they induce people 
to check in several times before they get something.

297
 Chapter 12: Location, Location, Location Marketing
A theater might give a two-for-one ticket deal on someone’s third or fifth visit, 
for example. If the Foursquare mayor checks in, he or she can be given free 
admission. These “down the road” promotions encourage people to visit you 
frequently.
	
If a customer or shopper does check in and your service gives you the ability 
to send a comment or greeting, by all means do so. That personal touch estab­
lishes a one-to-one connection between your business and the individual.
Make your offers well known
Part of location-based marketing boils down to good old-fashioned advertising. 
When you start connecting with your visitors through their mobile devices, 
make your offers known through signs in your store and on your website, 
Facebook page, and Twitter feed.
Make your offers tiered
In the preceding example, different levels of benefits were offered for different 
levels of visitors. Those who visit most often should naturally get the best 
deals. This sets up a spirit of competition among your regular customers, 
who might try to compete to see who can qualify for the best deals.

W

hen I was working on this new edition, social networking remained 
a hot topic in e-commerce. No longer a novelty, sites like Facebook 
and Twitter are now a part of the daily lives of millions of people around the 
world. Facebook has gone public and is on the rebound after its stock initially 
plummeted. Pinterest is helping businesses improve visibility not by spreading 
the word but by spreading images. The idea that businesses can and should 
promote themselves through social media is a given.
But let’s back up a moment. What exactly is “social networking”? If it’s social 
rather than commercial, how can it help you and your online business? 
E-commerce, like more traditional kinds of business, is built on concepts 
such as trust, brands, and reputation. The better you can brand yourself and 
prove that you are either an authority in your field or someone who sells 
desirable merchandise, the more successful you’ll be. By soliciting customers 
on social networking sites, you go out and actively find them rather than wait 
for them to find your storefront.
Social networking is simply the practice of connecting with people online at 
venues that have been specially created for that purpose. When the venues 
become especially popular, they become practical places to build a brand 
and spread the word about yourself and your business. You can even post 
items for sale through a social networking site or, at the very least, advertise 
them online. This chapter describes business uses for social networking sites 
like Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter, and your own social networking venue: 
an online blog.

Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Developing a Business 
Presence on Facebook
Back in the early days of the Internet, the way to find customers was to 
create a website and then list your site on directories with names like Site of 
the Day. Then you sat back and hoped you would be noticed through your 
merchandise or your company name. As any established businessperson will 
tell you, the “sit back and wait” approach just won’t fly these days. You’ve 
got to go out and find customers where they hang out — and increasingly, 
that’s on social networking sites like Facebook.
As you may notice, I’m not writing about other social networking sites such 
as Friendster and MySpace. That’s partly because I don’t use those sites and 
partly because Facebook has some features that make it especially attractive. 
The best is its “opt in” nature. You get content from a person or an organiza­
tion only if you decide to “friend” that person or indicate that you “like” an 
organization or a brand. You can set up seven different kinds of “pages” on 
Facebook:
	
✓	A personal profile: This is where you connect with family, friends, old 
school chums, and anyone who mutually agrees to be your Facebook 
“friend.”
	
✓	A page for a local business or place: If you have a brick-and-mortar 
store in addition to an online business, choose this option.
	
✓	A page for a company, organization or institution: This is the best option 
for an online-only business, which doesn’t have a physical presence.
	
✓	A page promoting a brand or product: Businesses that want to connect 
with customers regularly choose this option. 
	
✓	A page for an artist, band, or public figure: Fans can connect, and per­
formers or politicians can get the word out about what they’re up to. 
	
✓	A page for entertainment: This might be a book, a television show, a 
sporting event, a movie, and so on.
	
✓	A cause or community page: This can be a page about a cause, an orga­
nization, or a business. Individuals connect to such a page by clicking a 
link to show they “like” it. The organization can then communicate with 
those who “like” it by sending out announcements.
Because this is a book about online business, I’ll assume you’re interested 
in the third option. Starting a company or organization page is easy, as long 
as you have a Facebook account. First, go to the Facebook home page (www.
facebook.com). If you don’t have an account, fill out the form on the right 
side of the home page under the heading Sign Up. After you sign up, you 
create a business page by going to www.facebook.com/pages and clicking 
Create Page.

301
 Chapter 13: Social Marketing: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Blogs
Do some prep work before creating your page. Decide on
	
✓	The name of your page.
	
✓	The purpose of your page.
	
✓	What thumbnail image you’ll post along with your page. (If you have a 
business logo, this is the perfect place for it. If you are selling your pro­
fessional services, include a thumbnail image of yourself.)
	
✓	A short (two- to three-paragraph) description of yourself, your business, 
or your place ready to post.
When you’re ready, click Company, Organization or Institution. Fill out the 
form shown in Figure 13-1 and click Get Started.
	
Figure 13-1: 
Make 
the name 
of your 
Facebook 
page 
easy to 
remember.
	
	
You can also create a “local business or place” page on Facebook, of course. 
This might be a good option if you sell a particular product or service and you 
have a physical location. Check the categories in both the local business and 
company page options for a category that matches what you do.
Attracting “likers” to your Facebook page
As a businessperson, your job is to encourage Facebook members to “like” 
you. But first, they’ve got to find you on Facebook. You should definitely 
include a link to your Page on your website and as part of the signature file at 
the bottom of your e-mail messages.
	
See Chapter 8 for more on creating and using a signature file, a cost-effective 
form of marketing.

302
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
There are other ways to attract fans to your Page. One is shown in Figure 
13-2. The venerable business 1-800-FLOWERS offers a discount: If you click 
the Fan Offer! link, a code appears that gives you a discount when you order 
flowers from the company.
Anything that keeps visitors on your site and gives them an incentive to 
return makes it more likely they’ll purchase something.

Getting personal with fans and customers
Society43 is a company that’s very much in touch 
with its fan base. Founder Jason Bolt is careful 
to use the word “fans” as well as “customers” 
to describe those he seeks to reach through a 
website www.society43.com and a variety 
of social media presences such as a Facebook 
page (www.facebook.com/society43), 
a Twitter feed (https://twitter.com/
Society43), and Pinterest pinboards (www.
pinterest.com/society43).
By treating them as fans, Bolt and his employ­
ees can engage with them through social media 
events that don’t necessarily involve direct 
selling. The point is to interact, build enthusi­
asm, and spread the word in an exciting and 
entertaining way. On Society43’s Facebook 
page, you get plenty of ideas for how to do this. 
There are contests, quizzes, and photos from 
campus parties at which students were wear­
ing the company’s colorful and school-branded 
sunglasses.
The promotions are in touch with what’s happen­
ing right now, just like the Facebook news feed 
itself. As I was working on this chapter, it was 
Final Four weekend, so Society43 was offering 
free shipping on items purchased that weekend.
Earlier in the NCAA tournament, pairs of sun­
glasses were given away to those who choose 
the winners in various games. Another contest 

303
 Chapter 13: Social Marketing: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Blogs
offered a free bike and a pair of sunglasses to 
50 people who picked the eventual champion. 
Does giving away so many products help the 
company? You bet, says Bolt, who founded 
Society43 while he was a college student. He 
was still only 29 when I spoke to him recently 
for a story on EcommerceBytes (www.
ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/
y212/m10/abu0321/s04).
“Being a company made up of young (average 
age of 25) ambitious team members definitely 
helps us to connect to our younger custom­
ers,” said Bolt. “Our customers are looking for 
trendy exciting products that meet their fashion 
and fan needs at the same time.” He mentioned 
these tips for social marketing newbies:
	✓	Keep it fresh: Society43 team members 
make sure content on their website is 
always relevant and up to date, which 
draws repeat customers and improves rank 
on search results.
	✓	Use keywords: The website, Facebook 
posts, and other content contain keywords 
that also improve SEO (see Chapter 11 for 
more on SEO).
	✓	Know your customers: Society43 knows 
its customers are primarily sports-mad, 
cash-poor college students, which partly 
explains all the giveaways.
Having employees on staff who are the same 
age as the customer base also helps, Bolt adds. 
“R&D boils down to: If we wouldn’t wear it, we 
won’t make it,” he says.
Getting your customers excited
When you look at the 1-800-FLOWERS site, you immediately see another, 
perhaps even bigger benefit: You get to interact with individual customers 
and get feedback on how they deal with your site. On the Wall for the site, 
some leave comments about company postings, as they would about any 
information on Facebook; others simply indicate that they “like” a promotion 

304
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
or announcement. (On Facebook, “liking” is essentially a way of giving the 
thumbs-up gesture without actually saying anything.) Some of the comments 
are complaints, but the fact that they are on Facebook gives the staff person 
who is assigned to manage the fan page a chance to respond personally and 
perform some positive customer-relations work.
Other feedback on the page is enthusiastic: comments from people who are 
happy with the flowers they ordered and who are true “likers” of the company. 
Such interaction not only builds loyalty and lets customers feel empowered, 
but also gives 1-800-FLOWERS personal comments about packages that are 
well received and deals that generate interest. You would have to conduct 
expensive and time-consuming focus groups to get the same sort of feedback.
The Info tab, which is available on Facebook business pages, allows you to 
put out basic information about your company and make a link to your web­
site. The Shop tab, which is not typically available on Facebook pages, lets 
customers shop for and purchase floral arrangements. Such a utility requires 
a programmer to create a Facebook storefront using the Facebook applica­
tion programming interface. Unless you have a programmer on hand, you 
can’t create such a sales tab yourself — that is, unless you sign up for an 
account with the marketplace ArtFire or another shopping cart that provides 
you with a Facebook storefront.
Creating a Facebook “kiosk”
An innovative marketplace called ArtFire (www.artfire.com, profiled in 
Chapter 15) has developed a Facebook sales system for members who sign 
up and pay their monthly subscription fee.
	
The Facebook kiosk is available to all ArtFire members. At this writing, an 
account costs $12.95 per month.
After you create a storefront with ArtFire and list works of art or other items 
for sale in a catalog, you set up a page for your store on Facebook. Then you 
install the kiosk, which “grabs” your store logo and a selection of merchandise 
for sale and groups them in a format that those who “like” you will find easy 
to browse. You can also make purchases directly from the kiosk without ever 
having to log out of Facebook and go to another site.
Kharisma Ryantori, who sells handmade jewelry through an ArtFire store 
called Popnicute, has a page for her business on Facebook, shown in Figure 
13-3. Click the down arrow next to ArtFireKiosk near the top of this page 
and you can access a selection of her items for sale. (You could still shop 
although she was on vacation when I visited.)
Click one of the items shown for sale in the kiosk to view a close-up image of the 
item. You can select it by clicking the Add To Cart button shown in Figure 13-4. 
You then click the Checkout Now button to complete the purchase.

Sharing Your Images with Pinterest
You’re used to sharing short messages with Twitter and Facebook; it’s not 
a great leap to start sharing images as well. That’s the purpose of Pinterest: 
It allows you to post content that your customers and fans can then repost 
around the Internet. Suppose you have a brand-new rhinestone dog leash 
that your pet supply business has just developed. After announcing it on 
Facebook, Twitter, your blog, and your website, “pin” it to your pinboard on 
Pinterest. Those of your customers who are already on Pinterest will see it 
and share it with their pet-loving friends. The result: viral marketing for free, 
with a positive personal endorsement included as a built-in extra.
Pinterest, a newcomer in the social marketing field, has grown by leaps and 
bounds since it was launched in 2010. That’s probably because the Web is 
such a visual medium, not to mention the adage that a picture is worth a 
thousand words. Take a look at what Society43 (featured in the sidebar ear­
lier in this chapter) does on Pinterest. In Figure 13-5, you can see that it has 
pinned 104 images, and that 55 individuals are “following” them on Pinterest. 
Best of all, from Society43’s standpoint, three people have repinned its 
images and told their friends about them.

 Chapter 13: Social Marketing: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Blogs
To take advantage of Pinterest, make sure you do the following: 
	
✓	Sign up for a business account with Pinterest (business.pinterest.
com); it’s free.
	
✓	Get a “Pin” button that you can add to your website next to your 
Facebook “Like” icon and Twitter “tweet” icon.
	
✓	Check out any businesses on Pinterest that are similar to yours for ideas 
about the sorts of images they pin.
One business I’ve profiled, Liberty Jane Clothing, has even found a way to sell 
products on Pinterest. Visit its site at pinterest.com/libertyjaneco/
express-checkout or read about it at www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/
abu/y212/m11/abu0323/s03.
Building a Fan Base with Twitter
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is one of those social networking sites that you 
hear about and then scratch your head, saying, “What’s the purpose of that?” 
At first glance, you might not think a site that lets you post 140-character 
messages would have a business purpose. But look around at businesses 
that are using Twitter, and you realize that yes, Twitter can play a huge role 
in keeping up with customers, building brand visibility, and promoting your 
own identity or that of your organization.
Although lots of individuals use Twitter for fun, celebrities like Ashton 
Kutcher use it to make a point about a cause or issue. Big corporations such 
as the following use Twitter for a variety of business-related purposes:
	
✓	Ford Motor Company: Through its FordService Twitter feed (twitter.
com/FordService), Ford fields complaints, spam, and occasional 
useful feedback from customers.
	
✓	Popeyes Chicken: The company (twitter.com/popeyeschicken) 
jokes with customers about its food selections, announces sales, and 
occasionally responds with offers to personally address customer concerns 
with comments like this:
Sorry about your experience. Direct Mail me your e-mail & phone number and 
our Manager of Guest Relations will give you a call.
	
✓	Starbucks: The coffee giant has a Twitter site called MyStarbucksIdea 
(twitter.com/mystarbucksidea) where the company listens to 
customer suggestions and implements many of them. At this writing, 
one Twitter posting (known as a tweet) boasted that 50 suggestions 
originally voiced via Twitter had been implemented.
	
✓	H & R Block: The tax preparation service (twitter.com/HRBlock) 
responds to customer questions, either by e-mail or phone.

308
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
Of course, one social networking forum can be used to point to another one. 
The Kodak CB feed (twitter.com/kodakCB) is used to publicize new posts 
on the Kodak Corporate Blog. The blog, in turn (1000words.kodak.com), has 
links to the Kodak website, the Kodak Facebook page, the Kodak YouTube 
feed . . . get the idea?
For businesses small and large, Twitter plays a role in the overall online 
marketing effort. To build prominence on search engine results and word-
of-mouth publicity, you need to set up a web of connections from one site 
to another. By chatting with your customers, even if it seems as though you 
are giving your knowledge away and answering questions that don’t lead to 
immediate sales, you are building loyalty and good relations. Those benefits 
to others lead to sales for you.
Setting up a Twitter presence
It’s easy to start posting on Twitter. As on Facebook, the challenge is to come 
up with a plan for promoting your business with Twitter postings (tweets). 
Before you sign up, answer a few simple questions:
	
✓	What are your business goals for being on Twitter? Who will read your 
tweets?
	
✓	Do you have a cause or issue you want people to pay attention to?
	
✓	What action do you want people to take after reading a tweet? Do you 
want them to visit your website, read your blog, or shop in your sales 
catalog?
	
✓	How will people find you easily? What’s a one- or two-word name that 
you can assign to your Twitter page?
	
✓	Who will post tweets? Should this be a team effort, to keep postings 
flowing to Twitter on a regular basis?
	
✓	Do you have special sales or promotions you can offer?
That last part is especially important if you sell items from a catalog. Twitter 
denizens are used to getting special details or notices of items on sale from 
sites like DellOutlet (www.twitter.com/delloutlet). According to Business 
Insider (www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-twitter-sells-
3-million-of-computers-for-dell-2009-6), the Dell Twitter site 
generated $3 million worth of computer sales over a two-year period.
Signing up and posting
After you have a Twitter communications plan in place, you can sign up for 
the service and set up your Twitter feed. Go to www.twitter.com; enter a 
name, e-mail address, and password; and then click the Sign Up for Twitter 
button.

309
 Chapter 13: Social Marketing: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Blogs
After filling out a simple form to create an account comes the real work: 
remembering to post, and updating your posts regularly. Being limited to 140 
characters per tweet is a relief to many. But because tweets are so short, the 
convention is to keep them coming at least once a day or even several times 
a day.
	
Twitter is perfect if you have a smartphone with a keyboard and you like 
to type text messages. You can post on Twitter directly from your phone 
(m.twitter.com), as long as you do some setup beforehand. You can find 
a help forum called Twitter via SMS FAQs at https://support.twitter.
com/articles/14014-twitter-via-sms-faqs.
Using Your Blog for Profit . . . and Fun
You are probably familiar with blogs as online diaries whose owners record 
thoughts and observations and share them with anyone who cares to read 
them. There are millions of blogs in the world; in fact, at the time it closed up 
shop in 2012, the site BlogPulse reported that there are more than 180 million 
blogs in the world.
According to a story from Technorati (technorati.com/social-media/
article/state-of-the-blogosphere-2009-introduction), 28 percent 
of all people who responded to a questionnaire described themselves as “pro­
fessional bloggers.” Fully 17 percent reported that blogging is their primary 
source of income. Many blogs are just casual chatter. A few, though, make 
money for their creators. You, too, can use a blog to spread the word about 
you, your company, and what you sell, and make a few extra bucks as well.
Choosing a host with the most for your posts
One of the many nice things about blogging is that you don’t have to invent the 
wheel. Some sites set you up with a graphic look and a mechanism for posting, 
editing your posts, and receiving comments. Two are especially popular:
	
✓	WordPress (www.wordpress.com)
	
✓	Blogger (www.blogger.com)
Of these two, WordPress is far more popular because it offers more features 
than Blogger. For its part, Blogger (which is owned by Google) has been 
around a while and is free. WordPress is also free, but it offers a Premium 
version that adds features such as a custom domain, extra storage, and the 
ability to add a feature called VideoPress to your postings. You can also buy 
premium themes to give your site a professional-looking design; such themes 
typically cost $30 to $100.

310
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
If you are more technically minded and like to control your website and your 
blog, consider Movable Type (www.movabletype.org). Instead of hosting 
your blog on someone else’s site, you post this blogging software on a server 
that you either own or on which you rent space. Movable Type is free for indi­
viduals but costs $395 for a five-user license.
Adding ads to your blog
The most obvious and common way to make money from a blog is to sell ads 
on it. This becomes practical, however, only if you are already attracting a 
substantial number of visitors to your blog. Advertisers aren’t going to pay to 
place ads on a blog that has only 300 visitors a month. One that has 3,000 vis­
itors per month has a chance of gaining some ad revenue. The most common 
ad sources include the following:
	
✓	AdSense: This service from Google allows you to choose advertisers 
whose products and services are related to your own content.
	
✓	BlogAds: This service does the “matchmaking,” pairing up bloggers with 
advertisers and taking a fee for its work.
	
✓	Affiliate ads: As an affiliate, you advertise someone else’s products. 
You sign up for a program such as the popular affiliate program run by 
Amazon.com. Suppose you review a book on your blog and include a 
link to the book’s description in the Amazon.com marketplace. If some­
one clicks your ad to Amazon and then buys the book, you get paid an 
affiliate fee.
A blog is essentially a website in its own right — one to which you add the 
primary content on a regular basis. Although many blogs generate income, 
they also provide financial benefits because they save money for their 
owners. You can set one up for no money at all, as long as you have it hosted 
for free and are willing to take photos and write content yourself.
	
An October 2009 article in Technorati (technorati.com/social-media/
article/day-4-blogging-for-profit) reported that in a survey of 
active bloggers, the average income was $75,000 for those who had 100,000 or 
more unique visitors per month.
Asking for donations
You can simply ask people to donate to your blog. Sound crazy? It works. Add 
a PayPal button to your site. Visitors can then click the button and add money 
directly into your PayPal account. Follow these steps to add such a button:
	
1.	Go to the Buttons for Donations page on the PayPal website (www.
paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=donate-intro-outside).

311
 Chapter 13: Social Marketing: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Blogs
	
2.	Click the Create Your Button Now link.
	
	 The Create a PayPal Payment Button page appears with a form to fill out.
	
3.	Fill out the form, describing your business and the purpose of the 
donations. Be sure to log in so that your payments can be directed 
to your PayPal account. Then click the Create Button button at the 
bottom of the form.
	
	 A page appears, with code that describes your button.
	
4.	Copy the code and paste it into the body of the web page where you 
want the button to appear.
That’s all you need to do. If you don’t sell merchandise, donations can be a 
good way of keeping your effort going.
	
PayPal donation buttons aren’t for your for-profit online business. They are 
intended primarily for fundraising or for nonprofits. 
Achieving other business benefits
Blogs give customers and potential clients a place to gather so that they can 
find out more about you and your company. The more time they spend with 
you, the greater your chances of making a sale to them. A blog also gives 
you a forum for developing a credible reputation. Besides that, blogs are fun. 
They can take on a life of their own, especially when people start posting 
comments and you engage in dialog with them.
Marketing yourself
Many blogs exist to give the creator a place to demonstrate his or her knowl­
edge and expertise in a chosen field. Even if your blog isn’t specifically about 
you, consider including some biographical information so your visitors can 
find out something about your background, your knowledge of your field, and 
your trustworthiness. You might include the following:
	
✓	The basics about your qualifications: why you started your blog and 
why you went into business online
	
✓	Any certifications, honors, or titles related to your business
	
✓	Something about your business philosophy: your goals and objectives, 
and why you enjoy what you do
For many professionals, a blog is a place to promote and manage an image. As 
I wrote this, the famous golfer Tiger Woods was involved in legal controversy. 
He used his website (web.tigerwoods.com) to issue statements. The site 
includes a blog where he periodically posts about his tours and activities.

312
Part III: Social Networking and Marketing 
	
You don’t have to include a photo with your blog if you want to maintain your 
privacy. A photo would make your blog seem more friendly and personal, 
however. Don’t include your personal phone number or e-mail address unless 
you want to be especially open to your customers. Many CEOs do include 
e-mail addresses on their blogs and websites so that they can give personal 
attention to customer inquiries.
Selling your products instead of yourself
You don’t have to get personal with your blog. Some of the most successful 
are roundups of software, gadgets, or other consumer goods. Some business­
people advertise their products right within their blog.
Lars Hundley advertises through his Clean Air Gardening blog (http://
site.cleanairgardening.com/info). You don’t find much on the blog 
about Lars or his staff. Rather, you get product suggestions, gift ideas, and 
links to more detailed descriptions, as shown in Figure 13-6.
	
Lars Hundley has been very generous with sharing his business processes. 
You can find out more about how he sells online in Chapters 1 and 11.

W

hen it comes to making money online, the conventional notion is to 
think about creating a website or opening a storefront where you 
list many items for sale. You don’t have to take such a structured approach, 
however. It’s a lot of work to create a home page, set up a shopping cart, and 
establish a way to collect payments all by yourself. By listing individual items 
for sale on a well-established and well-known e-commerce venue, you can 
rack up sales without spending the big bucks on marketing and infrastruc­
ture. You can take advantage of the marketing tools the site gives you and the 
traffic the e-commerce venue already generates.
Amazon.com and eBay are among sites with the highest traffic in the market­
place. More and more often, when consumers are looking to purchase rare 
or unusual items or simply to save money, they automatically turn to these 
popular marketplaces. For sellers of all sorts, they are viable places to find 
customers and boost revenue. And both give merchants the ability to have 
their own storefronts hosted on their facilities.
With both Amazon and eBay, you don’t necessarily have to create a website, 
develop your own shopping cart, or become a credit card merchant: The 
marketplace you choose handles those essential tasks for you. And you can 
sell outside of your store on both sites. On Amazon, you can add your items 
to those already in the marketplace, and on eBay, you can list items without 
having an eBay Store. Or if you already have a website that functions as an 

316
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
e-commerce store, expanding to these well-trafficked venues can help you 
build your brand and develop a multisite platform. Or you can focus solely on 
running a business in these marketplaces. You can achieve these goals with 
hard work and commitment, combined with the important business strate­
gies I describe in this chapter.
	
Running a business on Amazon, eBay, or another site doesn’t necessarily mean 
you depend on that site as the sole source of your income. It might mean that 
you sell on that site part time for some supplementary income each month. This 
chapter assumes that you want to sell regularly on Amazon, eBay, or another 
marketplace and build a system for successful sales that can provide you with 
extra money, bill-paying money, or “fun money.”
Becoming an Amazon.com Seller
Over the years, Amazon.com has become known as “Earth’s Biggest Bookseller” 
by selling books on the site all by itself. Having conquered the world of online 
bookselling, Amazon.com is attempting to give individual entrepreneurs dif­
ferent options for generating revenue. You’ll find links leading to many of the 
options for selling with Amazon.com if you go to the home page and click 
the Selling on Amazon link below the various department headings.
Amazon.com gives entrepreneurs a variety of ways to sell through its existing 
marketplace. If you have an item to sell, you can list it on Amazon.com. You 
also get to place your ad alongside the listing for the same item that’s being 
sold brand-new on the site. You can also make money by advertising someone 
else’s product.
Becoming an Amazon.com Associate
You’re probably already familiar with the idea of an affiliate program. The 
Amazon.com Associates program works as you would expect: When you 
become an Amazon.com Associate, you place a link to Amazon.com on your 
website. When someone makes a purchase after following the link from 
your site, you earn a referral fee.
Selling as an affiliate
If you’ve written or created books, CDs, or other materials that are sold on 
Amazon.com, you can create links to those items on your website and refer 
your visitors to the bookseller’s site so that you can potentially earn the 
referral fee. I have a few books that are sold on Amazon.com, and I include 

317
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
images of several of these books on my website (www.gregholden.com). I 
already had several of the ingredients for generating referral income: a web­
site, books to sell, and a need for extra revenue. All that remained was to sign 
up with the Amazon.com Associates program and create specially formatted 
links that I associate with each of the book images on my home page.
To get started with the program, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to the Amazon.com home page and, near the bottom of the page, 
click See All link under the Make Money with Us heading.
	
2.	On the Make Money with Amazon page, scroll down and click the 
Learn More link under the Amazon Associates heading.
	
3.	 On the Amazon Associates page, click the Join Now for FREE! button 
on the right side.
	
4.	 Fill out the forms provided to become a member.
	
	 You have to tell Amazon.com all about your website and its content. 
When you’re done, click Finish.
	
5.	Choose the type of content you want Amazon to add to your site. 
The first section is for the Associates program. Click Get Started Now 
under this section.
	
	You have to set up a payment program by telling Amazon whether you 
want to receive a check or direct deposit into your bank account. I 
chose the direct deposit method, so I entered my bank account number 
and bank routing number.
	
6.	Click Get Started Now and then click Continue on subsequent pages to 
read about setting up links to Amazon.com products on your website.
	
	 You have to set up the Associates links according to Amazon.com’s 
specifications so that it can track when the links are clicked and deter­
mine whether purchases are subsequently made.
	
7.	From the Associates Central welcome page, click either the Search for 
a Product or Browse for a Product tab, enter keywords or ASIN/ISBN 
numbers for the products you want to promote, and then click Go.
	
	A list of products appears.
	
	 A keyword is a word or phrase that describes the item you have for sale 
and that prospective buyers are likely to enter in their searches.
	
8.	Click the Get Link button next to the item you want to advertise.
	
	 The Customize and Get HTML page appears, displaying one version of 
an ad for the product. The results of my search are shown in Figure 14-1. 

318
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
You can click one of the tabs above the product ad describing other 
types of ads you can display:
 
• Text Only: This is a text link to a specific book, movie, or CD you 
want to promote. If a graphic ad takes up too much space on your 
web pages, include a simple text link that points people to specific 
items on Amazon.com.
 
• Image Only: This is a graphic image you display on your site that 
displays a book or other product without text to save space.
 
• Add to Widget: Widgets are small-scale applications that auto­
mate the process whereby readers choose books, music, and 
other products from the Amazon.com catalog. You can include an 
Amazon.com search engine on your page, for example. You can 
also include your favorite books or music, among other things.
	
	 You can promote your friends’ books and CDs, books or CDs that relate 
to your goods and services, or other books and CDs you admire. By 
spreading the word about such materials, you can earn a few cents or 
perhaps a few dollars. Because I have some specific books to promote, I 
chose the first option, Product Links.

Becoming a search marketer
Most people who earn affiliate sales fees by advertising Amazon.com prod­
ucts do so by posting links on their websites or blogs. A growing number of 
enterprising individuals are advertising by placing ads on search and content 
sites such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. They’re taking products sold on one 
popular website and advertising on another well-traveled site.
The process works like this: You locate a product on Amazon.com that you 
want to sell. You become an Amazon Associate and create a link to the prod­
uct on the Amazon.com website (see the previous section, “Selling as an 
affiliate”). Rather than post the link to the product on your own website, you 
create one of those paid search ads that appear off to one side or at the top 
of a page full of search results. You write an ad that attracts people’s atten­
tion. Some people click the link included with the ad and go to the product 
page on the Amazon.com website. If someone makes a purchase as a result of 
clicking your ad, you earn a referral fee.

320
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
After you’ve signed up with Amazon.com, chosen a product to sell, and gen­
erated a link to it, sign up with Google’s AdWords program (www.google.
com/adwords). Start a campaign and write a short, three-line ad for the 
product. You identify keywords you want to associate with the ad and bid a 
certain amount on each one (10 cents per click is a reasonable amount). See 
the AdWords Help files for more instructions.
Search marketing through Google or other sites is an example of pay-per-click 
advertising: You’re charged for placing an ad only when someone clicks it. 
You choose keywords that cause your ad to appear in a set of search results. 
You place a bid on the keyword; the bid indicates how much you’re willing to 
pay if someone clicks your ad. The higher you bid, the better placement you 
have in ads (but the more you pay, too).
Here’s an example: Suppose you want to place an affiliate ad for an iPod 
Nano. This is a popular item, so you can expect to have a lot of competi­
tion from other search marketers who want to promote the same product. 
Suppose you have five other marketers who bid on the keywords “iPod 
nano.” How can you stand out from the crowd? One option is to be as spe­
cific as possible: If the other marketers bid on the keywords “iPod nano” 
and you bid on “16GB iPod nano,” you distinguish yourself — and attract a 
more targeted audience. You’ll get fewer clicks overall, but the chances are 
better that the people who see your ad will click it and purchase the iPod 
nano you’re promoting. You bid 10 cents per click on these keywords. If one 
of your ads causes the ad to appear 1,000 times in one month and 100 people 
click the ad, you pay $10 for that keyword for that month. If none of those 
clicks leads to a purchase, you don’t earn any money, either.
	
Along with signing up for an account with Amazon.com and with Google, you 
also need to sign up with an affiliate network — an organization that tracks 
how many clicks your ads have generated and issues commissions to you. 
Affiliate networks, such as Commission Junction, consolidate payments from 
many different advertisers and pay you in a single check. They’re most useful 
when you have multiple payouts from different advertisers.
Creating an aStore page
If you enjoy making referrals in a particular area and find that some of the 
shoppers you’ve referred are subsequently making purchases on Amazon.
com, you might want to present the items you recommend in an aStore. An 
aStore is an online store with a twist. An aStore isn’t a site where you put 
your own merchandise up for sale; rather, you present your own selection of 
items from Amazon.com’s merchandise on a web page. A sample store that’s 
been set up to benefit a school is shown in Figure 14-3.

321
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
	
Figure 14-3: 
You can 
turn a book 
cover into 
a clickable 
link that can 
earn you a 
referral fee.
	
The aStore interface helps you set up your page full of links and product images; 
you can then publish the page as part of your own website. The theory is 
that by having a “dedicated shopping area” on your site, you’ll keep visitors 
there longer (although if they want to investigate a link, they’ll leave your site 
and go to Amazon’s). Find out more about aStores at affiliate-program.

You probably won’t make a fortune from Amazon.com’s referral fees. You earn 
on average 45 percent of the value of the items sold, depending on the number 
of items you sell. If you refer someone who purchases a book for $15, for 
instance, you earn about $0.75 for that purchase.
Joining the marketplace
Suppose you have a pile of recently published books or DVDs around (books 
or DVDs that are being sold on Amazon.com) and you need to sell them. You 
can sell those items yourself by adding them to Amazon.com’s marketplace. 
Click the Sell on Amazon link at the bottom of any Amazon.com page, and 
you go to the Amazon Services part of the site, where you can find out how 
to add your inventory. It then shows up in individual product listings next to 
the price of the featured product in a small link such as “Used from $9.99” or 
“New from $19.99.” And someone can buy it on a page like the one shown in 
Figure 14-4.

Individual 
sellers can 
offer their 
items for 
sale on a 
page like 
this.
	
In this example, the featured product (the one that shows up in Amazon 
search results and has photos and product details) is known as the one with 
the “Buy Box.” The products offered by other sellers are the same ones but 
they may or not be in new condition. For many sellers, adding to the Amazon 
marketplace in this way is easy to do and an excellent venue for those who 
sell mass-market items as opposed to one-of-a-kind handmade goods or other 
niche items.
Suppose you purchase a book and you’re so happy with it that you just feel 
compelled to sell it so that others can share the wisdom contained within. 
Here’s how you sell it:
	
1.	Go to the Amazon.com home page (www.amazon.com) and click the 
Sell on Amazon link (under the Make Money with Us heading in the 
middle of the screen, near the bottom of the home page).
	
	 The Sell On Amazon.com page appears.
	
2.	Click one of the two Start Selling buttons, depending on whether you 
want to be an individual or professional seller. 
	
	 If you haven’t yet signed in to your Amazon.com account, you will be 
prompted to do so and then asked to create a seller account.
	
	 Individuals sell fewer than 40 items a month for $0.99 per sale plus other 
selling fees; professionals sell more than 40 items per month for $39.99 
per month plus other selling fees.

323
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
	
3.	Choose the category you’re interested in (in this example, the books 
category) and enter the name or ISBN (the number on the back cover, 
just above the “zebra stripe” code) of the specific item you want to 
see; then click the Start Selling button.
	
	 The sales page for the item (in this case, the book) appears.
	
4.	Click the Sell Yours Here button on the right side of that page.
	
	 The Sell Your Item - Select Condition page appears.
	
5.	Choose an option from the Condition drop-down list to describe the 
condition of your item; add some text that describes the condition, if 
you want, and then click Continue.
	
	 The Sell an Item - Enter Price page appears. This page includes the 
important information about Amazon.com’s fees: You’re charged $0.99 
plus a 6–25 percent fee for each item you sell.
	
6.	Enter your price in the Price box and then click Continue.
	
	 Make sure that your price is at or below Amazon.com’s own price.
	
	 The Sign In page appears.
	
7.	Enter your Amazon.com e-mail address and password. (You can use 
the same password you use to make purchases or sell as an Associate.) 
Then click Continue.
	
	 The Registration page appears.
	
8.	Choose a credit card from the list (or enter a new card name and 
number) to identify you and then click Continue.
	
	 Another Registration page appears.
	
9.	Enter your nickname and a daytime phone number and then click 
Continue.
	
	 Optionally, you can enter checking account information so that Amazon.
com can deposit purchase money into your account. You can skip this 
step for now.
	
	 A Confirmation page appears.
	
10.	Click Submit Your Listing.
	
	 The Your Listing Is Complete page appears. In addition, Amazon.com 
sends an e-mail message confirming that your item is now up for sale.
If your item doesn’t sell within 60 days, Amazon.com closes your listing, and 
you pay nothing. You receive an e-mail with details for relisting the item if 
you want.

Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
When you list in the marketplace, Amazon collects the sales price and shipping 
costs from the buyer, deducts a “referral fee” of 6–25 percent of the sales 
price, a variable closing fee, and a per-item fee of $0.99, and then passes 
along the net proceeds along with a specified shipping credit based on the 
item you sold. The $0.99 per-item fee is waived for Pro Merchant Subscribers. 
You can become a Pro Merchant once you sell in volume on Amazon and it 
becomes worthwhile. You pay $39.99 per month, but you get access to soft­
ware that helps you list in bulk, and you can compete for the Buy Box, which 
is described later in this chapter.
Taking out a Professional Subscription
If you have lots of items to sell, consider taking out a Professional 
Subscription. You have to pay a $39.99 monthly fee to be part of this Amazon.
com program, but there are some big advantages:
	
✓	You don’t have to pay the $0.99 fee.
	
✓	Your listings aren’t closed after 60 days.
A Professional Subscription also allows you to use the powerful inventory 
reports to view orders, sold listings, and current open listings. You also get 
access to a bulk-listing tool so that you can create lots of descriptions simul­
taneously. You have to sell at least a few items each month to make back 
your subscription fee, but if you’re a bookseller by trade and have a lot of 
inventory to unload, this is a good alternative.
	
You can find out more about the Professional merchant program at services.
amazon.com/content/sell-on-amazon.htm.
Pricing your merchandise
Amazon isn’t the most profitable venue, especially because of the “rush to 
the lowest price” trend on the marketplace, which can minimize your margin. 
Amazon’s fees also cut into your margin. To make sales and generate profits, 
you have to ensure that
	
✓	You’re selling items that people tend to buy on Amazon.
	
✓	Your prices are either lower than those of your competitors or at least 
close to the lowest.

325
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
Because sellers are constantly adding items to the Amazon marketplace, 
it’s important to check your prices against those of your competitors. If ten 
people list the same item and yours is the highest price, you can’t expect to 
make a sale. You can automate this process using a repricing tool — software 
that compares your price to others and makes sure yours is lowest. The tool 
I’m familiar with is Price Spectre (www.pricespectre.com). It works with 
both Amazon and eBay. You can configure it so that your price does not fall 
below a specified level, or that it stays a certain amount below others’ prices.
	
Some Amazon sales categories are closed to individual sellers; that is, you 
can’t add merchandise to those categories as described in preceding sections. 
Before you invest in a lot of inventory, confirm that you can sell those items 
in the category of your choice. Follow the steps described in the “Joining the 
marketplace” section, earlier in the chapter, and make sure you don’t see a 
warning message when you get to Step 3 indicating you can’t sell items in your 
chosen category. Verify that you can sell at least one item of the type you 
want to offer before you go through the effort of listing multiple items for sale.
Running a Webstore
On top of everything else it does, Amazon.com is becoming a web hosting 
service. Its Webstores program (webstore.amazon.com) gives you the abil­
ity to run your own branded store through the site. The difference between 
a conventional hosting service and a Webstore is that the latter makes use 
of Amazon.com’s e-commerce technology, including its fraud security, shop­
ping cart, and payment systems. One of the best advantages is that Webstore 
owners can use the Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) system in which they send 
their merchandise to Amazon and let it do the shipping and handling as 
needed. See the following section, “Shipping with Fulfillment By Amazon,” for 
more information on this intriguing fulfillment option.
Lots of successful businesses use the Webstores platform, from well-known 
retailers like Marks & Spencer (which runs an outlet site at outlet.marks
andspencer.com as a Webstore, as a supplement to its primary website at 
www.marksandspencer.com) to lesser-known businesses like TexCynGoods 
(www.texcyngoods.com), which is run by Texas entrepreneur Cynthia 
Lozana. Another seller I have interviewed, Mimi Kriele, has about a dozen 
stores on Amazon.com Webstores. Her main business is called A Touch of 
Europe (https://touchofeurope.net). Such sites are transparent “white 
label” operations; there is no indication that they are hosted by Amazon. 
Customers also have the option of having Service Provided by Amazon 
indicated at the bottom of their website pages. This notice appears at the 
bottom of the Marks & Spencer outlet store’s home page, shown in Figure 14-5.

326
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
	
Figure 14-5: 
Merchants 
can “white 
label” their 
stores or 
display the 
Amazon 
brand 
shown on 
this site’s 
page.
	
Webstore customers pay $24.99 per month plus a 2 percent commission for a 
website only; merchants who sell on Amazon.com, in the Amazon marketplace, 
pay $14.99 per month, a 1 percent commission, and Selling on Amazon fees.
Webstore owners can also drive traffic to their sites by paying for integration 
with Amazon’s ad platform, Amazon Product Ads (http://services.amazon.
com/content/product-ads-on-amazon.htm). This platform enables 
businesses to advertise their products to Amazon’s millions of customers.
	
Some companies set up shop on the Webstores platform temporarily to run a 
“daily deal” promotion. If you want to offer a special clearance or other sales 
event, you might consider doing the same. Jerlique, an Australian body cream 
merchant, once held a 24–48-hour promotion through a Webstore. After the 
event the site was taken down.
Shipping with Fulfillment By Amazon
One of Amazon’s most attractive features for entrepreneurs is its ability to 
handle an online business’s packing and shipping needs. Its Fulfillment By 
Amazon (FBA) program works like this:
	
1.	 You pack up your merchandise and send it to Amazon.
	
2.	 You pay a small storage fee so Amazon can store your stuff.
	
3.	 You list the items up for sale.
	
4.	 When the item sells, Amazon “picks and packs” it.
	
5.	 You pay a pick and pack fee.
	
6.	 You pay a per-pound shipping fee.

327
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
This program is especially attractive to beginning sellers, who don’t usually 
have the staff available to help them with fulfillment. With FBA, you can focus 
your energy on sourcing, selling, and customer service. You have the oppor­
tunity to build up your sales volume far higher than you could if you were 
Discovering the hidden benefits of FBA
Some of FBA’s benefits are obvious. You clean out your storage area and, in exchange for stor­
age and fulfillment fees, let Amazon do the packing and shipping for you. But intrepid sellers have 
uncovered hidden ways to leverage FBA to make money. For example, some are doing arbitrage: 
buying items at retail stores and reselling them for a profit online. They let Amazon.com do the 
packing and shipping for them through FBA.
Then there’s Chris Green. He not only sells a large volume of products using FBA, but he has created 
products and a web-based business based on it. He blogs and instructs sellers about how to use the 
service through his website FBAPower (www.scanpower.com/fbapower). As shown in the fol­
lowing figure, this site offers hardware that sellers like you can use to scan bar codes, gather sales data, 
and suggest pricing for products you may want to sell on Amazon and ship using FBA.
With FBA, Green can place an order at 5 p.m. and it can go out the same day, he says. Another 
advantage is the increased profit margin because of reduced shipping. For example, a non-FBA 
seller sells an item for $10 plus $3.99 shipping. An FBA seller can offer the same item for $13.99. 
Not only that, but the FBA item shows up ahead of the non-FBA item in Amazon’s search results 
because Free Super Saver Shipping or similar discounted shipping status is used as a “tie-breaker.” 
You show up first, you are more likely to get the purchase, and you get more profit — even after 
you subtract Amazon’s storage and fulfillment fees.
“It’s a way to compete,” says Green. “I definitely get more profit per item for doing less work. It’s 
like a double win. It’s a margins game. I may not get all the sales, but I get two or three times the 
margin as other sellers.”

328
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
doing all the sourcing, listing, selling, and shipping on your own. Even if your 
profit margin isn’t big, you make up for it in volume.
	
To ship with FBA, your items must have an ISBN code or UPC bar code and be 
in good condition.
FBA is a form of drop-shipping: the practice of selling merchandise that you 
don’t actually have on hand in your home, office, or store. You usually have 
to choose a drop-shipper with care; there is a risk of fraud, and you place a 
lot of trust in your shipper. But you can trust Amazon because it’s so big and 
well known. The only risk is that your items won’t sell or that you won’t make 
more than a few cents in profit. But if you have, say, a lot of recent textbooks 
or DVDs to sell, FBA can be a very attractive option.
When you join FBA, your items become eligible for Amazon Prime reduced 
shipping costs on orders over $25 or free 2-Day Air shipping for Amazon 
Prime members. Because your fees are so low, you can raise your prices and 
still remain competitive compared to sellers who have to build, say, a $3 
shipping fee into their price (that’s a $3 shipping fee that a seller might pay 
to Amazon for an item that doesn’t go through FBA).
Playing Amazon’s game to win
To sum up, by following good business practices and taking advantage of a 
few special approaches, you can make a profit on Amazon:
	
✓	Keep your prices competitive. Use e-commerce management software 
to make sure your product is priced competitively compared to other 
Amazon.com sellers. Always know how your price ranks among other 
retailers selling the same product.
	
✓	Make sure you have enough supply to meet demand. You don’t want to 
sell out of a product before your Amazon inventory updates.
	
✓	Respond to customers quickly. Amazon expects you to provide top-
quality customer service. Respond to questions or comments quickly, 
and resolve problems so you don’t get negative feedback.
	
✓	Gather strong reviews. Positive ratings and good comments mean a lot 
on any marketplace, but with so much competition, they’re especially 
important on Amazon. They’ll prompt Amazon to push buyers to you 
over your competition.
There’s one more thing. If you sell on a regular basis on Amazon, it’s to your 
advantage to do everything you can to get the Buy Box for as many items as 
you can.
You’ve seen the Buy Box before; it’s the product listing you see first when you 
search for something. An example is shown in Figure 14-6.

329
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
	
Figure 14-6: 
The seller 
with the Buy 
Box is most 
likely to get 
the sale.
	
In this example, Amazon.com itself has the Buy Box — the blue highlighted 
box on the right side of the page. Others are selling the same item for a lower 
price, but the links leading to them are pretty unobtrusive. Amazon has the 
advantage.
Learning from Amazon’s business strategy
Some of the things that Amazon.com does 
aren’t direct sales opportunities for fledgling 
businesses like yours. They are, however, good 
examples of new ways to make money on the 
web — options that don’t always involve cata­
logs, tangible items such as books, or retail or 
wholesale prices.
In 2006, for example, Amazon founder Jeff 
Bezos spoke on new initiatives the company 
was taking to promote its computing power. 
One service, Compute Cloud, has really taken 
off and has been replicated widely by Google 
and many other service providers. A “cloud” or 
online storage and work area lets businesses 
tap into the computing power of Amazon.com’s 
own servers: They can use the servers for 
storage space and to perform computations. 
A company that makes virtual reality software 
“borrowed” Amazon.com’s computers to 
enable its customers to quickly download its 
new software version, for example.
It’s all about making your business a resource 
that people turn to on a regular basis rather than 
a source of a single product or service. This 
wouldn’t work if you’re a childcare provider or 
a dentist — someone whose business requires 
personal contact. But if you help someone com­
plete a dissertation, write essays to apply for 
college, provide legal advice, sell your home, or 
manage a condo association, the web can help 
you. More and more commerce on the web is 
taking the form of services that help businesses 
operate more efficiently. If Amazon.com and 
Google are putting their energy into web-based 
services, you should think about doing so, too.

330
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
Because multiple sellers are probably offering the same items you are, if you 
can earn the Buy Box from Amazon, you’ll have a big advantage. There’s no 
hard and fast formula for winning the box, but following Amazon’s best prac­
tices go a long way, as well as keeping your pricing competitive and making 
sure your products are always available.

Understanding eBay Auctions
In any contest, you have to know the ground rules. Anyone who has held 
a garage sale knows the ground rules for making a person-to-person sale. 
But eBay, the other big marketplace you can use, is different, and not just 
because auctions are the primary format. eBay gives its members many dif­
ferent ways to sell, and each sales format has its own set of rules and proce­
dures. It pays to know something about the different sales so that you can 
choose the right format for the item you have.
This section assumes that you have some basic knowledge of eBay and that 
you have at least shopped for a few items and possibly won some auctions. 
When it comes to putting items up for sale, as opposed to simply buying 
items, eBay gets more complicated. You have the following sales options:
	
✓	Standard auctions: This is the most basic eBay auction: You put an item 
up for sale and specify a starting bid (usually, a low amount — from 
$1–$9.99). You don’t have a reserve price, and the highest bidder at the 
end of the sale wins (if there is a highest bidder). Standard auctions and 
other auctions on eBay can last one, three, five, seven, or ten days. The 
ending time is precise: If you list something at 10:09 a.m. on a Sunday 
and you choose a seven-day format, the sale ends at 10:09 a.m. the 
following Sunday.
	
✓	Reserve auctions: A reserve price is a minimum price you specify for a 
successful purchase. Any bids placed on the item being offered must 
meet or exceed the reserve price; otherwise, the sale ends without the 
seller’s being obligated to sell the item. You know if a reserve price is 
present by the message Reserve Not Yet Met next to the current 
high bid. When a bid is received that exceeds the reserve, this mes­
sage changes to Reserve Met. The reserve price is concealed until the 
reserve is met.

331
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
	
	Reserve prices aren’t used as often on eBay as in the past; instead, you 
can set a starting bid that represents the minimum you want to receive.
	
✓	Fixed-price Buy It Now (BIN) sales: A BIN price is a fixed price that the 
seller specifies. Fixed prices are used in all eBay Stores: The seller speci­
fies that you can purchase the item for, say, $10.99; you click the Buy It 
Now button, agree to pay $10.99 plus shipping, and you instantly win 
the item.
	
✓	Mixed auction/fixed-price sales: BIN prices can be offered in conjunction 
with standard or reserve auctions. In other words, even though bidders 
are placing bids on the item, if someone agrees to pay the fixed price, 
the item is immediately sold and the sale ends. If a BIN price is offered in 
conjunction with a standard auction, the BIN price is available until the 
first bid is placed; then the BIN price disappears. If a BIN price is offered 
in conjunction with a reserve auction, the BIN price is available until the 
reserve price is met. After the reserve price is met, the BIN price disap­
pears and the item is sold to the highest bidder.
Those are the basic types of sales. You can also sell automobiles on eBay 
Motors. By knowing how eBay sales work and following the rules compe­
tently, you gradually develop a good reputation on the auction site.
	
How you sell is important, but the question of exactly what you should sell 
is one you should resolve well before you start your eBay business. Most 
people begin by cleaning out their closets and other storage areas, but that 
inventory doesn’t last more than a few weeks. Start by selling something you 
love, something you don’t mind spending hours shopping for, photographing, 
describing, and eventually packing up and shipping. Sell something that has a 
niche market of enthusiastic collectors or other customers. Do some research 
on eBay to make sure that a thousand people aren’t already peddling the same 
things you hope to make available.
Building a Good Reputation
To run a business on eBay, you need a steady flow of repeat customers. 
Customer loyalty comes primarily from the trust that is produced by devel­
oping a good reputation. eBay’s feedback system is the best indicator of how 
trustworthy and responsive a seller is, because past performance is a good 
indication of the kind of service a customer can expect in the future. Along 
with deciding what you want to sell and whether you want to sell on eBay on 
a part- or full-time basis, you need to develop a good reputation.

332
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
Getting good feedback
eBay’s success is largely due to the network of trust it has established among 
its millions of members. The feedback system, through which members leave 
positive, negative, or neutral comments for the people with whom they con­
ducted (or tried to conduct) transactions, is the foundation for that trust. 
Learning from the pros: My own story
As part of the research for a book I was writ­
ing, I attended a convention in Atlanta of the 
Professional eBay Sellers Alliance (PeSA). 
PeSA members are among the elite of the eBay 
merchant association. Just to get into the group, 
you must meet two of three criteria: gross eBay 
sales income of $25,000 per month, eBay fees of 
$1,500 per month, or 500 positive feedback com­
ments in the past 30 days. Today, PeSA is open to 
any eBay seller who has achieved PowerSeller 
status. (I give you all the PowerSeller details in 
the “Striving for PowerSeller status” section, 
later in this chapter.)
These are hard-working, enterprising, and suc­
cessful individuals. But when I spoke to them 
and got to know them, I realized that they weren’t 
very different from me: Other than a strong busi­
ness sense and drive, most of them were normal 
folks with families who hadn’t been selling pro­
fessionally until they discovered eBay.
I left the convention inspired not only to write 
my book but also to start selling on my own. 
I have always collected antiques and other 
items, and I like “scrounging” for used items 
that are valuable. I am lucky enough to have a 
network of good resale shops in my area. I had 
already found some shoes at my local store that 
I knew cost $350 new. They weren’t new but 
were in good condition and cost only a few dol­
lars. I bought some shoes for myself and gave 
others to friends or relatives.
Now, I’ve started buying shoes to resell on eBay. 
At first, it felt strange to be shopping for “busi­
ness” purposes at the store where I had previ­
ously shopped only for enjoyment and for my 
own benefit. It took me a few weeks to get over 
this, but it was easy to do so when I had made a 
few sales — of my own merchandise and some 
antiques sold on behalf of my mother — and 
realized that I was a legitimate businessperson.
Before too long, I easily achieved my initial 
goal of making $300 to $400 per month in sales. 
I decided to put into practice the most impor­
tant lesson I gained from the PowerSellers I’d 
met: To make more money on eBay, you need to 
increase your volume. This sounds deceptively 
simple. But the tendency is to start slowly — 
perhaps putting ten items up for sale in a week. 
Putting up ten items for sale three, five, or even 
seven days a week is much more work. But the 
extra time and labor does pay off: The more you 
can put up for sale, the more you actually sell.
I became a PowerSeller in only about three 
months. I got a special icon next to my User 
ID. As a PowerSeller, I attracted more bids and 
more sales. After a year, I had raised my feed­
back rating to nearly 400. I found out a great deal 
about eBay and had some extra spending money 
besides. I got a debit card through eBay’s pay­
ment service PayPal (www.paypal.com) and 
used the money I collected from my eBay sales 
to pay daily expenses and bills.

333
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
The system rewards users who accumulate significant numbers of positive 
feedback comments and penalizes those who have low or negative feedback 
numbers. By taking advantage of the feedback system, you can realize the 
highest possible profit on your online sales and help get your online business 
off the ground.
In recent years, eBay has refined its feedback system. Buyers have the 
chance to leave “detailed feedback” for sellers. One way of rating a seller on 
eBay is the Detailed Seller Rating (DSR). This new system makes it even more 
important to provide good service. Buyers can leave DSRs in four areas:
	
✓	How accurate was the item description?
	
✓	How satisfied were you with the seller’s communication?
	
✓	How quickly did the seller ship the item?
	
✓	How reasonable were the shipping and handling charges?
Another seller rating system is the Top-Rated Seller designation, which 
depends on how rapidly you ship the item and what level of customer service 
you provide.
	
You can find out more about DSRs at http://pages.ebay.com/help/
feedback/detailed-seller-ratings.html.
There probably aren’t any scientific studies of how feedback numbers affect 
sales, but I’ve heard anecdotally from sellers that their sales figures increase 
when their feedback levels hit a certain number. The number varies, but it 
appears to be in the hundreds — perhaps 300 or so. The inference is that 
prospective buyers place more trust in sellers who have higher feedback 
numbers because they have more experience and are presumably more trust­
worthy. Those who have a PowerSeller icon are even more trustworthy (see 
the “Striving for PowerSeller status” section, later in this chapter).
	
eBay members take feedback seriously. You’ll see this after you start selling. 
If you don’t leave feedback for your buyers after the transaction has ended, 
they’ll start reminding you to do so. You’re in control of the feedback you 
leave; don’t feel coerced to leave comments unless you want to. Otherwise, 
the feedback system won’t be of value. To read someone’s feedback, click the 
number in parentheses next to his or her User ID.
Developing a schedule
On eBay, timeliness can boost your reputation above all else. If you respond 
to e-mail inquiries within a few hours, or at most a day or two, and if you 
can ship merchandise quickly, you’re virtually guaranteed to have satisfied 
customers who leave you positive feedback (that is, as long as the product they 
receive is in the condition you promised). You’re more likely to be designated 

334
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
a Top-Rated Seller, too. The way to achieve a timely response is to observe a 
work schedule.
It’s tedious and time consuming to take and retake photos, edit those photos, 
get sales descriptions online, and do the packing and shipping that’s required 
at the end of a sale. The only way to come up with a sufficient number of 
sales every week is to come up with a system. A big part of coming up with a 
system is developing a weekly schedule that spells out when you need to do 
all your eBay activities. Table 14-1 shows a possible schedule.

You’ll notice that something is conspicuously missing from this proposed 
schedule: a day of rest. You can certainly work in such a day on Sunday (or 
whatever day you prefer). If you sell on eBay part time, you can probably 
take much of the weekend off. But most full-time sellers (and full-time self-
employed people in general) will tell you that it’s difficult to find a day off, 
especially when it’s so important to respond to customer e-mails within a 
day or two of their receipt. You don’t have to do everything all by yourself, 
however. You can hire full- or part-time help, which can free up time for family 
responsibilities.
	
Sunday nights are traditionally considered the best times to end eBay auction 
sales (or sales on iOffer or other sites) because that’s when most potential 
buyers are available. But if you have an item for sale that someone really 
wants, any night of the week attracts buyers. You can try starting a five-day 
sale on a Tuesday night so that it ends on the following Sunday night; that 
way, you won’t have to work on Sunday.
Creating an About Me page
One of the best ways to build your reputation on eBay is to create a web page 
called About Me that eBay makes available to each member free of charge. 

335
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
Your About Me page should describe who you are, why you collect or sell 
what you do, and why you’re a reputable seller. You can also talk about an 
eBay Store, if you have one, and provide links to your current auction sales. 
Creating an About Me page takes only a few minutes (not much longer than 
filling out the Sell Your Item form to get a sale online, in fact). If you want to 
include a photo, take a digital image and edit it in an image-editing program, 
such as PaintShop Pro or Photoshop, just as you would any other image. A 
photo isn’t absolutely necessary, though.
Laura Milnor Iverson, the eBay seller I profile in Chapter 15, has a simple 
About Me page, shown in Figure 14-7.
When you’ve decided what you want to say on your page, you need to save a 
digital photo if you want to include one. You then need to upload your photo 
to the web server where you usually store your photos. Note the URL that 
identifies the location of the photo (for example, www.myphotohost.com/
mydirectory/photoname.jpg).

Another way to ensure a good reputation as a seller is to actively participate 
in eBay’s discussion boards. Pay special attention to boards that pertain to 
the type of merchandise you buy and sell. Responding to questions from new 
users and offering advice based on your experience boosts your standing 
within the user community.
Creating Sales Descriptions That Sell
How do you actually go about selling on eBay or another auction-based site, 
or a fixed-price marketplace? The aim is similar to other forms of e-commerce: 
You select some merchandise, take photos, type descriptions, and put the 
descriptions online in a catalog. But there are some critical differences. You 
don’t have to specify a fixed price on eBay; you can set a starting bid and see 
how much the market will bear. All sales descriptions are not created equal, 
however. Many sellers argue that clear, sharp photos are the most important 
part of a description, and that if you show the item in its best light, it practi­
cally sells itself. I believe a good heading and descriptions that include critical 
keywords are just as important as good photos. Learn the art of creating 
descriptions by inspecting other people’s sales listings; the essentials are 
described in the sections that follow.
Focusing on the details
The primary way of getting your sales online is eBay’s Sell Your Item form. 
You can access it by clicking Sell on the eBay navigation bar, which appears 
at the top of just about any page on the eBay website. The Sell Your Item 
form is easy to use, so I don’t step you through every nuance and option. In 
this section, however, I do point out a few features you might overlook that 
can help you get more attention for your sales.
	
The Sell Your Item form is by no means the only way to get eBay sales online. 
Many full- or part-time businesspeople use special software to upload multiple 
images simultaneously or schedule multiple sales so that they all start and 
end at the same time. The auction services Vendio (www.vendio.com) and 

338
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
inkFrog (https://www.inkfrog.com) offer eBay auction-listing tools. In 
addition, eBay offers two programs you might find helpful:
	
✓	Turbo Lister (http://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/
sellingresources/turbolister.html) is a free program that pro­
vides sellers with design templates they can use to add graphic inter­
est to their sales descriptions. This is the program I use. It takes a lot 
of memory and is sometimes slow to run but, as shown in Figure 14-9, 
Turbo Lister enables you to format auctions quickly and reuse standard 
elements such as your shipping or return policies.
	
✓	Selling Manager (pages.ebay.com/selling_manager/index.html) 
is a monthly subscription service that uses sales and management soft­
ware. It gives you convenient lists that let you track what you have up 
for sale, which sales have ended, which items have been purchased, and 
what tasks you have yet to do — for example, sending e-mails to winning 
bidders or relisting items that didn’t sell the first time.
	
Figure 14-9:

descriptions 
with the Sell 
Your Item 
form or with 
software 
like Turbo 
Lister.
	
Choosing a second category
One of the first things you do in the Sell Your Item form is choose a sales 
category in which to list your item. I highly recommend using the search box 
at the top of the Select Category page. When you enter a keyword and click 
Find, a detailed list of sales categories appears. The best thing about the list 
is that it’s ranked in order of categories most likely to sell items matching 
your desired keywords. Choose the categories near the top of the list.

339
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
I also recommend paying an extra dollar or so (when you choose a second 
category, your listing fee is doubled) and listing the item in a second category — 
especially if the second category has a percentage ranking that’s almost as 
high as the first.
Focusing on your auction heading
The heading of an eBay sales description is the six or seven words that 
appear in a set of search results or in a set of listings in a category. These 
are the words a potential customer initially sees when he or she is decid­
ing whether to investigate a sale and possibly bid on it. Keep your heading 
short and specific. Include dates, colors, or model numbers if applicable. Try 
to pick one word or short phrase that might attract a buyer, such as “rare,” 
“hard-to-find,” “mint,” or “new.”
	
Be sure to work keywords into your auction title — brand names or phrases 
that shoppers might search for on eBay. Your sale is more likely to turn up 
in search results with desirable brand names such as Gucci or Versace. Be 
as specific as you can; include sizes, colors, and original retail prices in your 
headings, too.
Choosing a good ending time for your sale
With eBay, the starting time isn’t what counts; it’s the ending time that makes 
a difference. The more attention you can get at the end of a sale, the more 
likely you are to make a profit. Most sales get attention on weekends, when 
the majority of shoppers aren’t working. In my experience, the optimal time 
is to have the sale end some time on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday evening 
(though Wednesday evenings are also good — I’m not sure why).
Of course, bidders can come from all over the world, and what’s Sunday 
afternoon in California is Monday morning in Australia. But don’t worry too 
much about such distinctions. Pick an ending time that’s convenient for eBay 
shoppers in your own country — not in the middle of a workday, but on the 
weekend.
	
In eBay’s early days, if you wanted a sale to end at a particular time (say, 7 on 
a Sunday evening, when lots of bidders are available), you had to physically 
be present to create the description at a certain time. For example, if you 
wanted a sale to last seven days, you had to list it at precisely 7 p.m. the pre­
ceding Sunday. Now you don’t have to be physically present exactly a week, 
five days, three days, or one day before you want your sale to end. Instead, 
you can specify an ending time when you fill out the Sell Your Item form or 
with Turbo Lister, although you’ll have to pay an extra listing fee of 10 cents 
for each sale you schedule.

340
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
Adding keywords
You don’t have to make your auction description overly lengthy. The length 
isn’t what counts; it’s the number of keywords you include. If your descrip­
tion contains a keyword that someone enters, your sale might show up in 
search results. And just appearing in the search results is half the battle: If a 
buyer can find your item, he or she can follow through with the purchase.
	
The more keywords you can add to your description, the more frequently 
searchers find the sale. It’s to your advantage, then, to think of all the terms 
that someone would use when looking for your item and add as many of those 
keywords to the heading as well as to the body of the description as you can. If 
you’re selling an electric drill, for example, use keywords — such as “cordless,” 
“electric,” “3/8-inch,” “Black & Decker,” or anything else a likely buyer might 
enter.
Upgrading your listings
Near the end of the Sell Your Item form, a series of items gives you the option 
to specify whether you want to upgrade your listings. Upgrade, in this case, is 
adding graphic highlights that help your listing stand out from those around 
it, either in search results or on category pages. You can choose from the 
options shown in Table 14-2.

Note: Although it’s free to register for an account on eBay and free to fill out 
the Sell Your Item form, eBay sometimes charges an Insertion Fee when you 
actually put an item up for sale. The Insertion Fee is based on the starting 
price of the auction. The fee is not charged for the first 50 auctions, and then 
you’re charged only $0.25 for a starting bid of $9.99 or less, which explains 
why most starting bids are less than $10. A Final Value Fee is also charged at 
the end of the auction, and it depends on the sale price and category of item 
that sold. On a sale of $100, the Final Value Fee is 9 percent or $9; at $5,000, it 
is $250 because the maximum Final Value Fee is $250. For a detailed explana­
tion of the formula used to calculate fees, go to http://pages.ebay.com/
help/sell/fees.html.

341
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
Including clear images
No matter how well written your auction’s headings and description are, all 
your work can quickly be undone by digital images that are dark or blurry or 
that load too slowly because they’re too large in either physical (length and 
width) or file size. The same principles you use when capturing digital images 
for your e-commerce website apply to eBay images: Make sure you have clear, 
even lighting (consider taking your photos outdoors); use your camera’s auto-
focus setting; crop your images so they focus on the merchandise being sold; 
and keep the file size small by adjusting the resolution with your digital 
camera or your image-editing software.
Some aspects of posting images along with auction descriptions are unique 
to eBay:
	
✓	Image hosting: If you run a business on eBay and have dozens or even 
hundreds of sales items online at any one time, you can potentially have 
hundreds of image files to upload and store on a server. If you use eBay 
Picture Services as your photo host, your images are hosted free for 90 
days, except in eBay Motors, where you get four free images with each 
subsequent one costing $0.15. There is a 12-photo limit for each listing. 
If you need more flexibility, consider an economical photo-hosting 
service such as PixHost (www.pixhost.com) or Photobucket (www.
photobucket.com).
	
✓	Close-ups: If what you’re selling has important details, such as brand 
names, dates, or maker’s marks, you need to have a camera that has 
macro capability — that is, the ability to get clear close-ups. Virtually 
all digital cameras have a macro setting, but it can be tricky to hold the 
camera still enough to get a clear image (you may need to mount the 
camera on a tripod). If you use a conventional film camera, invest in a 
macro lens.
	
✓	Multiple images: You never hear an eBay shopper complaining that you 
included too many images with your auction listings. As long as you have 
the time and patience as well as an affordable image host, you can include 
five, six, or more views of your item. (For big objects such as automobiles 
and other vehicles, multiple images are especially important.)
Be sure to crop and adjust the brightness and contrast of your images after 
you take them, using a program such as PaintShop Pro by Corel (www.corel.
com) or Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com).
	
If you want to find out more about creating sales descriptions (and practically 
every aspect of buying or selling on eBay, for that matter) take a look at my 
book eBay PowerUser’s Bible (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

Being flexible with payment options
In the past, payments have been the most nerve-racking part of a transaction 
on eBay. These days, eBay provides more safeguards for its customers. That 
doesn’t mean you won’t run into the occasional bidder who doesn’t respond 
after winning your auction, or whose check bounces. But as a seller, you have 
plenty of protection: If someone doesn’t respond, you can relist your item; if 
someone’s check bounces, you don’t lose your sales item because you hold 
on to it while the check clears.
You can enable your customers to pay with a credit card, either by using your 
merchant credit card account if you have one (see Chapter 7) or eBay’s own 
PayPal payment service (www.paypal.com). PayPal is by far the most popu­
lar option; you’re charged a nominal fee (2.2–2.9 percent of the amount plus a 
30-cent fee) when a buyer transfers money electronically to your account.
	
Don’t accept other forms of payment from buyers. Occasionally, a buyer 
insists on sending you cash in an envelope; you should in turn insist that the 
buyer join PayPal or use a credit card instead. C.O.D. (Collect on Delivery) 
is expensive and cumbersome; it makes the delivery service responsible for 
collecting your money, and if the buyer isn’t home when the delivery people 
arrive, you might have to wait a long time to get paid. Western Union wire 
transfers are notorious for being used by scam artists — although I have used 
Western Union money order payments with no problem.
Providing Good Customer Service
When you sell on eBay on a regular basis, you need to develop a good reputa­
tion. One way to achieve that goal is to provide a high level of customer ser­
vice to your buyers. The best way to do that is to be responsive to all e-mail. 
This means checking your e-mail at least once a day and spending lots of 
time typing messages. If you take days to get back to someone who asks you 
about the color or condition of an item you have for sale, it might just be too 
late for that person to bid. A slow response to a high bidder or buyer after 
the sale can make the buyer nervous and result in neutral feedback — not a 
complaint about fraud or dishonesty, but a note about poor service. On eBay, 
such feedback is considered as bad as a negative comment.
Setting terms of sale
One aspect of good customer service is getting back to people quickly and 
communicating clearly and with courtesy. When you receive inquiries, 
always thank prospective customers for approaching you and considering 
the sale; even if they don’t end up placing bids, you’ll have spread goodwill.

343
 Chapter 14: Selling on Amazon.com and eBay
Another way to be good to your customers is to be clear about how you plan 
to ship your merchandise and how much it will cost. When you fill out the 
Sell Your Item form (which I discuss in the “Focusing on the details” section, 
earlier in this chapter), you can specify either an actual shipping cost (a cost 
based on weight and the buyer’s residence) or a flat shipping fee (a shipping 
fee you charge for all your items).
The moment you specify a shipping charge in the Sell Your Item form, you set 
eBay’s automated Checkout system in motion. The Checkout system enables 
buyers to calculate their own shipping charges. The advantage to you, the 
seller, is that you don’t have to send your buyers a message stating how 
much they need to pay you.
Packing and shipping safely
One of the aspects of selling on eBay that is often overlooked (not by buyers) 
is the practice of packing and shipping. Sellers need to keep in mind that, 
after sending out payment for something, buyers often wait on pins and nee­
dles, eagerly hoping to receive their items while dreading an unresponsive 
seller who refuses to ship their purchases. There’s also the danger that the 
item you send will be damaged in transit.
Be sure to use sturdy boxes when you ship and take care to adequately cushion 
your merchandise within those boxes. I’ve received boxes from sellers who 
stuffed the insides with bubble wrap and newspaper, and I was happy for the 
trouble. If you’re shipping something particularly fragile, consider double-
boxing it: Put it in a box, place the box in a larger one, and put cushioning 
material between the two. Your customers will be pleased to receive the 
merchandise undamaged, and you’ll get good feedback as a result.
	
Place a thank-you note, business card, or even a small gift inside the box with 
your shipment. It spreads good feelings and reminds buyers how to get in 
touch with you in the future.
Moving from Auctioneer to 
eBay Businessperson
Most eBay sellers don’t start out saying, “I’m going to be a PowerSeller, and 
I’m going to sell full time on eBay for a living!” Rather, they typically start out 
on a whim. They find an object lying in a box, in the attic, or on a shelf, and 
they wonder: Will anyone pay money for this?

344
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
That’s what happened to Kimberly King, a housewife living in Longmont, 
Colorado. In March 2000, she was cleaning the house when she found an old 
purse. She says, “I thought, ‘Gee, should I sell this?’ I didn’t have enough stuff 
to hold a garage sale. I’d heard about eBay, so I thought I would see what it 
was like to sell something. I found out just how easy it was to set up an ID and 
to register. I ended up getting $20 for the purse, which was much more than I 
would have at a garage sale. I was hooked.”
After she felt comfortable selling on eBay, things fell into place: “You start 
thinking, ‘Let’s see, that thing sold, what else do we have that we can sell?’ 
When I really saw that I could do this on a regular basis, I thought, ‘I can do 
this all the time; I can have some fun money.’”
Opening an eBay Store
An eBay Store is a website within eBay’s own voluminous web empire. It’s a 
place where sellers can post items for sale at fixed prices. The great advantage 
of having a store is that it enables a seller to keep merchandise available for 
purchase for 30, 60, 90, or even an unlimited number of days at a time. It gives 
customers another way to buy from you, and it can significantly increase your 
sales in other venues or of items you sell at auction on eBay, too.
Starting an eBay Store is a big undertaking and therefore something you 
should do only when you have a proven system for selling items on eBay at 
auction. You should also have a ready source of inventory with which you 
can stock your store. The problem with stores is that they cost $15.95 and 
up per month, depending on the package you choose, and you have to sell 
that much just to break even every month. For sellers who have a small profit 
margin, it can be a struggle to make back that monthly payment, especially in 
the slow post-holiday months.
When you know what you want to sell and have good-quality inventory to 
offer (not just castoffs that went unsold at auction), go to the eBay Stores 
home page (stores.ebay.com) and click the Open a Store link. You need 
to decide on a name for your store and organize your merchandise into sales 
categories. You also need to attend to and update your store to make it a suc­
cess. But having a store can be a key step toward making an eBay business 
work, and if you’re serious about making eBay a regular source of income, I 
encourage you to give the store option a try.

Striving for PowerSeller status
PowerSellers are among the elite on eBay. Those members who have the 
coveted icon next to their names can feel justifiably proud of their accomplish­
ments. They have met the stringent requirements for PowerSellers, which 
emphasize consistent sales, a high and regular number of completed sales, and 
excellent customer service. Moving from occasional seller to PowerSeller is a 
substantial change — and quite a thrill, I assure you. Requirements include
	
✓	At least 100 unique transactions and a minimum of $3,000 in gross sales 
in the past 12 months
	
✓	Positive feedback results of 98 percent in the past three months
	
✓	Minimum average Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs) of 4.60 or higher for 
all four DSR categories: item is as described, communication, shipping 
time, and shipping and handling charges
	
✓	A good standing record — achieved by complying with eBay Listing 
Policies
	
✓	A current account — achieved by contacting bidders within three busi­
ness days and upholding the eBay Community Values
In return for the hard work required to meet these standards, PowerSellers 
get a number of benefits, including discounts on eBay final value fees, mer­
chandise with a special logo on it, customer support via telephone, and a 
special discussion board just for PowerSellers. The biggest benefit is that 
the number of bids and purchases goes up because buyers have more confi­
dence in you.
	
The PowerSeller program isn’t something you apply for. eBay reviews your 
sales statistics and invites you to join the program when you meet the require­
ments. You can find out more about the requirements and benefits of the 
PowerSeller program at http://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/

In This Chapter
▶	Selling big items on Craigslist the smart way
▶	Choosing options for auctioning your creative work
▶	Finding marketplaces that let you buy and sell affordably
▶	Locating places where you can buy or sell for free
▶	Merchandising your creative work with CafePress
A

 single website isn’t enough anymore. The newest entrepreneurs 
focus on branding themselves and gain as much exposure as possible 
through cost-effective marketing methods including multiple marketplaces. 
Omni-channel commerce is the buzzword you hear about. 
By signing up with a niche marketplace, you can set up a storefront, com­
municate with customers, accept payments, and socialize with other sellers 
who deal in the same kinds of merchandise you do. You might have to pay a 
modest hosting fee — or you might not, because many of the sites are totally 
free to their members. This chapter collects a variety of small, innovative, full-
featured marketplaces that are attractive alternatives to the big e-commerce 
hosts. Consider opening storefronts in one or more venues to increase your 
visibility and, with luck, put some extra cash in your pocket.
Even if you have a commercial site, you might still want to sell specialty 
items on venues that are set up to handle them — such as Craigslist for big 
items that are difficult to ship, Amazon.com for used books, and CafePress 
or other sites for artwork. In fact, the more places you “pop up” as a web 
merchant, the better. Your stores can sell different products and link to one 
another, which boosts your business overall. This chapter examines some of 
the best-known alternatives for making money with hosting services.
	
The marketplaces profiled here are only a selection of many. You can find 
more listed on AuctionBytes beneath the article about eBay alternatives at 
www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/cab/abu/y209/m01/abu0230/s03 An 
article on SmartMoney entitled “eBay’s Allure Is Going, Going, Gone” describes 
how eBay began losing its popularity as many sellers started exploring alter­
natives (www.smartmoney.com/spend/family-money/ebay-allure-

Researching the Right Sales Venues
Once you start looking beyond your own website, eBay, or Amazon, you’ve 
got lots of options. The challenge is to pick the best venue for your needs. 
You don’t want to open eight or ten storefronts just because you can, only 
to find that you aren’t getting many new customers. Make sure you choose a 
host that fills the criteria listed in the sections that follow.
Sellers reach customers on multiple sales venues
When I wrote previous editions of this book, eBay was the marketplace of choice for enterprising 
entrepreneurs wanting to sell antiques, consumer goods, handicrafts, and just about any other kind 
of merchandise. As of this writing, the atmosphere is different. I have profiled a number of sites that 
either compete directly with eBay or provide a niche alternative to the auction giant. Experienced 
sellers no longer focus solely on eBay. Rather, eBay is just one of a number of venues for them. For 
some sellers who are fed up with eBay’s listing and final value fees, eBay doesn’t play any role at 
all; they sell through their own websites and other marketplaces.
Laura Milnor Iverson has been selling her original artwork online since 2002 through her Zen Breeze 
Art Gallery website (www.zenbreeze.com). She also sells on eBay (User ID: iversongallery) 
where she is currently a Top-Rated Seller. Another successful venue is her store on CafePress 
(http://shop.cafepress.com/zenbreeze.com). You can also find Laura on the fol­
lowing sites:
	✓	Bonanza (www.bonanza.com/booths/ZenBreeze)
	✓	eCRATER (http://zenbreeze.ecrater.com/)
	✓	Etsy (www.etsy.com/shop/laurali)
“I have a bunch of basic (free) stores, linked together by using a search tag — my website name: 
zenbreeze,” she says. She sells her art online full time. 
Laura has been online long enough that much of her business comes from referrals made by satis­
fied customers who perform “viral marketing.” In other cases, when she sells a painting or print, 
she sends an e-mail with a link to her sales items on CafePress. This free marketing brings her 
more business.
Sometimes, she even gets commissions. “I often get requests from buyers to get a painting on some 
item or another.” She marks up her artwork modestly, making a profit of only about 15 percent.
“In this economy, I find that you have to spend more time online listing on a variety of venues,” she 
comments. “There’s no single one that’s going to generate enough income.”

How much does it cost?
If you’re a lone entrepreneur or the owner or a small business, this is prob­
ably your first question. You already pay fees for Internet access, inventory, a 
shopping cart, and other business services. You can’t afford high fees. In that 
case you might opt for a free marketplace such as eCRATER (www.ecrater.
com), Storenvy (www.storenvy.com), or Wensy (www.wensy.com).
Also pay attention to the fees charged for putting items up for sale. If you 
plan to have hundreds or even thousands of pieces of merchandise to sell, 
such fees can eat into your profits, especially if the items don’t sell.
How many customers does it attract?
Lack of customers is the most common complaint voiced with regard to small 
niche marketplaces. The fact is, you can’t depend totally on a marketplace to 
do your marketing for you. No matter where you are, you need to make your 
site visible on Google and other search engines and do SEO (see Chapter 11).
That said, it’s still worth reading each marketplace’s FAQs and discussion 
forums to see what strategies the marketplace follows to boost its visibility 
and market its customers’ storefronts, and to get an idea how successful it is.
	
If you sell specialty items of a particular type, consider a marketplace that 
isn’t necessarily free but that can bring you customers who are looking spe­
cifically for what you have to sell. Sites like Etsy and ArtFire aren’t free, but 
they’re great for artists. If you sell books, consider sites like Alibris (www.
alibris.com) and ABEBooks (www.abebooks.com).
Scanning EcommerceBytes’ Seller Survey
When you’re researching e-commerce marketplaces, be sure to take advan­
tage of ratings and comments provided by sellers who have experience with 
them. Each year, the website EcommerceBytes surveys its readers, who 
are primarily small online businesses and lone entrepreneurs. The Sellers’ 
Choice survey ranks marketplaces both big and small. The 2013 survey is at 
www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y213/m02/abu0328/s02, and its 
opening page is shown in Figure 15-1.

their 
market-
places.
	
If you drill in to each marketplace, you get a page full of quotes from sellers 
that can be quite revealing. You find out, for example, that eCRATER has no 
fees but one seller finds that it needs more exposure and more customers (a 
common complaint voiced about many, if not most, marketplaces). “Sales are 
slow, but when you make them it is usually 100 percent profit!” one says. You 
learn that Webstore.com (www.webstore.com) is “geared for the U.S. only” 
while eBid (www.ebid.net) is better for UK sellers because it’s based in the 
United Kingdom. The fact that such comments are anonymous makes them 
that much more believable. The 2013 seller survey lists these venues as the 
top ten:
	
1.	Etsy. It’s the preeminent site for handmade arts and crafts.
	
2.	Ruby Lane. This long-standing antiques site gets high marks for cus­
tomer service and communication.
	
3.	Amazon. It’s easy to use and brings you lots of potential customers.
	
4.	Bonanza. It got the highest marks of all sites for being easy to use.
	
5.	eBay. This site is easy to use with lots of traffic, but customer service 
gets low marks.
	
6.	eBid. It gets higher marks than eBay for customer service, but lower 
marks for profitability.
	
7.	Addoway. This site is built with social networking in mind and traffic is 
said to be growing.
	
8.	Webstore.com. One seller calls it the best of the no-fee sites.

351
 Chapter 15: Moving to Specialty Marketplaces
	
9.	ArtFire. This site no longer has a free stores option, but it charges a flat 
monthly fee regardless of how many items you sell.
	
10.	eCRATER. It has strong store hosting features, but needs more traffic, 
sellers say.
The number of free options means that you can open more than one store 
and give each outlet its own graphic identity and product line, as other ener­
getic sellers have done.
Branching Out to Other Marketplaces
For many online sellers, an eBay or Amazon.com storefront or a standalone 
website is only a starting point. Sellers also set up storefronts on similar but 
much smaller marketplaces. Having multiple venues lets you reach a wider 
customer base, and your sites can link to one another, which improves their 
placement on Google.
Selling the smart way: Craigslist
Craigslist, the classified ad service started in the mid-1990s by Craig 
Newmark, has become an institution on the web and beyond. It’s so popu­
lar that it’s cutting into the business of traditional print newspapers, which 
depend in part on their own classified ad postings for revenue. It’s also popu­
lar enough that it’s become a target for scam artists who try to trick sellers 
out of their money.
For entrepreneurs, Craigslist is a good way to sell merchandise locally. 
Sometimes, you just have big-ticket items that don’t work well on eBay or 
another site because the cost of shipping is prohibitive. Craigslist is perfect 
for furniture, major appliances, motor vehicles, and other items that need to 
be picked up by the buyer. I recently sold a trailer for my father, and most of 
the experience went smoothly. It’s important, though, to be aware of some of 
the quirks and unique features of selling on Craigslist so that you don’t end 
up with a bad experience.
	
eBay also has an extensive marketplace designated especially for motor vehi­
cles and related items such as parts. eBay Motors (www.ebay.com/motors) 
includes extensive protections for both buyers and sellers. That makes it a 
good alternative to Craigslist if you are looking to sell a car.

352
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
To illustrate the Craigslist sales system, I run through the process of listing 
items online, using two examples from my own experience. My father asked 
me to sell a trailer and a motorized chair lift. Some parts of the sales went 
well and some parts were alarming.
Gather details
On Craigslist, just as on eBay and other auction sites, the more details you 
have about an item, the better. Details sell: Sizes, colors, and serial numbers 
are all good to gather beforehand. Don’t be surprised if you are asked about 
them. I did field some amazingly detailed questions. Get out a tape measure 
and measure your item. Get the exact model number and serial number. In 
your description, be sure to play up any desirable features.
Take photos
Take good, clear JPEG images of your item. If the item is especially large 
(such as a motor vehicle), be sure to photograph it from all sides. (Buyers 
want to make sure that you aren’t concealing scratches or dings on a side 
you aren’t showing.) Save the images in a graphics program, if necessary, so 
that each image is 72 dots per inch (dpi) in resolution. The ideal file size for 
an image is 50–100KB.
List the item
Find the version of Craigslist that is closest to you geographically by search­
ing the list on the site’s home page www.craigslist.org. Go to the local 
site and search for objects that are similar to yours. See where they are sold 
and list your item in the same category. To list the trailer, I went to the North 
Chicagoland page, marked All for Sale (chicago.craigslist.org/nch/
sss) and clicked the Post link in the upper-right corner. When a page full of 
more specific categories appeared, I clicked General for Sale. A list of items 
for sale appeared. Next, I clicked North Chicagoland and got a shorter list of 
items for sale located on the north side of Chicago and the surrounding sub­
urbs, which is where the items were located. I typed the description shown in 
Figure 15-2.
As you can see, I added the sentence “Cash or PayPal only” at the end of the 
description. I did this for a reason. Craigslist, in its guidelines for sellers, 
warns against scams involving fraudulent buyers buying items with forged 
cashier’s checks. When the checks bounce, the seller has lost the merchan­
dise and is out the value of the check as well.
	
Be wary of buyers who offer to have a shipper pick up the item and who say 
they’ll pay with a cashier’s check. Buyers should pick up in person and either 
pay cash or via PayPal. Be especially wary of buyers who offer to pay more 
than you advertise and then ask you to reimburse the shipper for the differ­
ence. This is an age-old scam designed to take even more from you than the 
merchandise — you’ll lose the money, too.

After you have written the description, click Add/Edit Images. Choose up to 
four images to include with the listing. (You can post no more than four.) 
Click Continue and preview your listing, as shown in Figure 15-3. Read care­
fully for any mistakes. If you need to make revisions, click Edit. If everything 
looks OK, click Continue.

354
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
After you click Continue, accept the terms of use, and read the e-mail that 
Craigslist sends to you. Click the link supplied in the e-mail, which takes you 
back to Craigslist to approve your listing. After you click the Publish button, 
your listing goes online. Be aware that the sale is online for only seven days. 
After that, it is removed, and you have to list it again. Keep the description 
and photos handy should you need to relist.
When you receive e-mail responses, be selective. Respond only to those e-mails 
from people who seem eager to pick up your item themselves and who will 
pay you either by cash or PayPal. I received plenty of responses from people 
who would not pick up in person but insisted on sending a “shipper.” One 
e-mail read as follows (I am leaving misspellings intact):
Thanks for your prompt reply.Well,i must say you ve got a nice item and 
as a matter of fact, In a transaction like this, i will appreciate it if we can 
put trust first so that the transaction can go smoothly.I would have love to 
come by with cash and pick it up but at the moment am a kinda of too busy 
to come over,so i think i can send you a cashier check via Fedex Or UPS 
overnight and my shipping company could come pick it up once payment 
is cleared.The Check will be excess and all what you will need to do is to 
just send the remaining balance to my Shipper for pick up after deduct­
ing your money,if you are ok with this pls do get back to me with your full 
name,address and phone number so i can proceed with the payment and 
pls do keep this item for me and inform other interested party that its been 
sold..ok
Needless to say, I told the buyer that I was insisting on cash or PayPal and that 
the item must be picked up in person. I never heard back from him. Craigslist 
can be a great place to sell, but remember that you’re in charge. Don’t be 
rushed by people who claim to be in a big hurry and who don’t want to meet 
your terms. There will be others after them who will be more compliant.
Making your own product line: Etsy.com
If the merchandise you sell includes items you have designed or crafted 
yourself, consider selling them on Etsy.com. Rob Kalin, who was then a 
27-year-old painter, carpenter, and photographer, started Etsy in 2005. It has 
since grown into a hugely successful marketplace for crafts and artwork of 
all kinds. In June 2008, the site announced its millionth registered user. Etsy 
reports that $895.1 million worth of items were sold on Etsy in 2012. The site 
currently has more than 22 million members and 850,000 sellers.
Etsy has been featured on Martha Stewart’s TV show, and AuctionBytes 
editor Ina Steiner found that on a visit to the company’s Brooklyn, New York, 

355
 Chapter 15: Moving to Specialty Marketplaces
headquarters, the offices are decorated with many of the crafts sold on the 
site. (You can read her report at www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/
y209/m04/abu0236/s02.) Selling on Etsy makes for a personal experience 
that brings to mind the “old days” of the web when buyers and sellers got to 
know one another personally and sent out personal notes and freebies with 
items they sold.
Etsy, like other marketplaces, requires you to sign up for membership and 
gives sellers a user-friendly way to create an online storefront and list items 
for sale. As part of your storefront, you can describe what you make and talk 
about artists or craftspeople who have influenced you. You pay nothing for a 
storefront, but you are charged 20 cents per item and 3.5 percent of the final 
sales price of each item you sell (this does not include shipping). The 3.5 per­
cent is much lower than eBay’s final value fees, which start at 9 percent for 
auction items that sell for up to $50.
	
The Internet offers plenty of alternatives to Etsy in the field of selling arts, 
crafts, jewelry, and other handmade products. Etsy is just the best-known 
marketplace of its type. Also consider Zazzle (www.zazzle.com) and ArtFire 
(www.artfire.com); I describe ArtFire later in this chapter.
Going beyond listing fees: 
OnlineAuction.com
Like many online marketplaces, OnlineAuction.com (www.onlineauction.
com) was founded when an antiques and collectibles dealer who started out 
selling on eBay became disenchanted with the site. Founder Chris Fain sold 
both on eBay and in brick-and-mortar businesses near Grants Pass, Oregon. 
When I interviewed Fain in 2008, the site had 50,000 users.
One big difference between OnlineAuction.com and other sites, including 
eBay, is the fee structure. At OnlineAuction.com, sellers don’t pay listing fees 
or final value fees. They can sell as many items as they want, and in place 
of per-item fees, they pay annual or monthly memberships. New sellers can 
open a basic storefront called My OLA House for $8 per month. (The service 
is free to founding members.) Sellers can also list and sell as many items as 
they want for $10 per month.
Avoiding hosting fees: eCRATER
Dimitar Slavov got the idea for eCRATER when he ordered a book from 
Amazon.com. He found the Amazon site difficult to navigate. Because he is 

356
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
a programmer, he decided to create his own online marketplace, one that 
would be marked by simplicity. eCRATER (www.ecrater.com) charges no 
fees for buying or selling items. You are charged only if you want to have 
your store featured on the site and given premium placement.
Also, sellers are allowed to host their own websites on the site. Through a 
process called URL masking, you use your own web address, not eCRATER’s, 
which makes it seem as though you operate a completely independent site 
rather than one that is part of eCRATER Sellers also get access to an admin­
istrative tool that allows them to manage their online stores. All products are 
advertised on Google, and Google Checkout, as well as PayPal, are accepted 
forms of online payment.
	
See Chapter 7 for more on Google Checkout, PayPal, and other payment 
options.
Reversing the sales process: iOffer
If you are looking for a truly different buying and selling experience, check 
out iOffer (www.ioffer.com). This site turns two basic principles of online 
auctions on their heads. First, there’s the idea that the seller either sets a 
starting price, a reserve price, or a fixed price for the sale. Instead, iOffer 
puts buyers in charge by giving them a system through which they make an 
offer and then bargain with the seller until a price is agreed on.
Second, there’s the notion that auction sales end at a fixed time. On eBay, 
this encourages buyers to wait until the last minute, or even the last second 
or two, to place a bid. On iOffer, there is no fixed ending time. It’s free to set 
up a store, and sellers are charged fees only when they sell an item. Fees tend 
to be lower than on eBay; for items that sell for $10 to $24.99, the fee is $1.25, 
for example.
Evaluating your items: 
WorthPoint/GoAntiques
Knowledge sells. That maxim applies on the web, where shoppers are used to 
digging around for specifications and all the information they can find about 
items they seek. WorthPoint (www.worthpoint.com), which also owns the 
venerable online auction site GoAntiques, makes knowledge a big asset for 
anyone who wants to sell online.

357
 Chapter 15: Moving to Specialty Marketplaces
Don’t know what that antique lamp with the clock in the middle of the woman’s 
stomach is worth? You can look up similar items on WorthPoint’s database 
and get a good idea. Or you can ask an expert, called a “Worthologist,” who 
is there to answer questions and provide advice just for registered sellers. 
You have to be a member to gain access to this wealth of information. 
Memberships start at $14.99 per month, which gives you full access to the 
“Worthopedia” database.
Chatting it up: Bonanza
If you want to forget about the suspense of auction sales and simply offer 
merchandise at a fixed price, just as in a garage sale, take a look at Bonanza 
(www.bonanza.com). Lots of entrepreneurs have already taken a look. 
Bonanza (formerly known as Bonanzle) was only launched in June 2008, but by 
August 2009, it had 100,000 registered users. In March 2013, EcommerceBytes 
reported that the site was expecting its one millionth user (www.ecommerce
bytes.com/cab/abn/y13/m03/i08/s03). The most popular areas on the 
site are collectibles, shoes, books, records, and jewelry.
At a garage sale, buyers are apt to haggle and chat with sellers, and the same 
applies at Bonanza. If you like some social networking along with your selling, 
this is the place for you. Sellers offer their merchandise in a sales “booth,” 
which is the equivalent of a store on other sites. The site charges merchants 
a flat 3.5 percent fee for each item sold. Each booth has a chat window incor­
porated into it. The seller can use it to say “Hi” or engage buyers in conversa­
tion. Bonanza also has discussion boards, just as other sites do. But the fact 
that chat goes on in the midst of sales descriptions sets Bonanza apart.
The interaction extends to management as well. Customers can add to a 
“wish list” of features they want to see on the site. Founder Bill Harding 
reviews the list and often responds personally to requests.
Hosting your store for free: Highwire
Highwire Commerce (www.highwire.com), formerly BuyItSellIt.com, is 
more than an auction or fixed-price sales marketplace. It’s a free e-commerce 
hosting service. It costs nothing to create a storefront that allows you to sell 
on eBay, Facebook, and Bonanza. For $19.95 per month, you can have your 
own webstore and add your own domain name. (Otherwise, your storefront’s 
domain name takes the form www.mystorefrontname.mybisi.com.)

358
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
Highwire’s $19.95 option lets you sell up to $1,500 of merchandise per month; 
any higher, and you are automatically upgraded to the $39.95 per month 
hosting option. The emphasis here is on features that make a full-featured 
e-commerce site run, including bulk uploading of multiple items, the ability 
to offer sales coupons, a customer account manager, and a customizable 
checkout process.
Finding the features you need: ArtFire
If you sell handmade jewelry, art, or other handcrafts, ArtFire (www.artfire.
com) is an option worth considering. Many of the site’s features used to be 
available for free; some ArtFire sellers were angered when free hosting and 
sales were discontinued. On the other hand, ArtFire is still in business.
After a 14-day trial period, you are charged $12.95 per month for member­
ship. (There are no listing or final value fees.) For this, you get access to a 
long list of features including the ability to create discount sales, the option 
to establish a Facebook store called a kiosk, and coupon codes you can issue 
to shoppers. You can list an unlimited number of items, too. A seller named 
Dotoly’s store, based in Hong Kong, has a sale page and advertises other fea­
tures such as coupons and a newsletter, as shown in Figure 15-4.

 Chapter 15: Moving to Specialty Marketplaces
Joining Robin Hood: Webstore.com
Julio Pereda, who founded Webstore.com (www.webstore.com), likes to 
think of his site as being the Robin Hood of online marketplaces. Webstore 
focuses on the “Daily Deal,” the practice of listing one item per day and 
making it available at a deep discount for a limited amount of time. It’s an 
approach that has worked well on sites like Woot.com and on home shopping 
networks on television.
For sellers and buyers alike, the big advantage of Webstore.com is that no 
fees are charged, period. It’s absolutely free to buy and sell. The site makes 
money from display ads posted on the side of many pages. Even though it’s 
free, Webstore.com offers some nice features: Sellers can design their stores 
using customizable templates, and buyers can shop for items in their local 
area if they want to pick up something in person.
Taking a personal approach: Wensy.com
Remember the days when every neighborhood had a corner store? You knew 
the people who ran the store, and they greeted you by name when you came 
in. For the most part, those days are gone. But in the online world, you occa­
sionally find a site that is run by a true “lone entrepreneur,” a do-it-yourselfer 
who doesn’t have help and doesn’t have to report to anyone else.
That’s the story with Wensy.com (www.wensy.com), a site created and 
managed by Darren Bock, a man who has a day job as director of a hospital 
intensive care unit. In his spare time, after taking care of heart patients, he 
relaxes by responding to messages and managing his site. Although he man­
ages a staff of 71 during his day job, his website staff is just one: himself. (He 
occasionally pays programmers to make technical changes.) The 12,000-plus 
registered users don’t pay a penny in fees to either list items or sell them. 
Bock does include some ads on the site and gets donations from some users. 
But he’s in it for the personal contact with his user community. He checks 
e-mails every 12 hours and responds personally to all of them. “It’s a lot of 
fun,” he told me.
	
On top of everything else it does, Amazon.com is trying to be a web hosting 
service as well. The Webstores program gives you the ability to run your own 
branded store through the site. The difference between a conventional hosting 
service and a webstore is that the latter uses Amazon.com’s own e-commerce 
technology. Find out more in Chapter 14.

Selling your creative work: CafePress
If you’re a creative artist and you just want to sell a few examples of your 
work to family and friends, CafePress might be just what you need. If you 
already have an account with PayPal and regularly use its payment services 
for sales on eBay, it makes sense to open a PayPal store. If you use Microsoft 
products, such as Expression Web, to create your web pages, Microsoft Small 
Business Center is a good option for creating an online sales catalog and 
storefront. It’s all a matter of deciding what you need.
Creative people aren’t always the best at marketing and selling their own 
work. Millions of amateur artists out there are probably hoping to become 
professionals. They have great ideas for cartoons, logos, and drawings, but 
the prospect of getting them printed and sold in stores is a big obstacle.
It’s easy enough to start your own CafePress store. (Figure 15-5 shows an 
example of a CafePress store.) Follow these steps:

Make sure your logo or other image meets the height and other requirements 
for a CafePress.com store. Images must be 200 pixels in height (1 inch equals 
approximately 72 pixels). Find out more by clicking the Need More Image Help? 
link, which appears on the product design pages as you’re creating your store.
Visit your new site by entering your web address, which takes the form 
www.cafepress.com/storename (where storename is the name you 
choose in Step 6).
CafePress.com sets a base price for each object. For example, a set of six 
greeting cards has a base price of $10.99. If you charge $14.99 for the cards, 
CafePress.com collects the base price, but you get the $4.00 profit. You don’t 
have to do the printing or shipping; CafePress.com handles all of that for you.

Connecting All Your Outlets
You can advertise your sites on EveryPlaceISell, a site run by my colleagues 
Ina and David Steiner (see Chapter 20 for details). This site lets sellers collect 
links to all their storefronts on one convenient page. For example, Figure 15-9

T

he preceding two chapters focus on some of the most popular market­
places for establishing one or more online storefronts. Having more than 
one venue to attract sellers helps you do cross-marketing and boosts your 
visibility; it’s the strategy more and more small businesses are using to com­
pete online with the big players. But the more storefronts you have, the more 
difficult it is to manage them at all. Suppose you have a single item listed for 
sale in two of your stores. If someone clicks the Buy button on an item in one 
of your stores and you can’t ship it because someone else just purchased the 
same item from another store, your reputation takes a big hit. Repeat such 
problems and all your hard work can be undone.
This chapter focuses on good practices and useful tools for keeping track of 
inventory, sales, and payments among multiple stores to keep your online 
business running smoothly. As you might expect, service providers are eager 
to help entrepreneurs just like you with management interfaces that can 
provide you with a complete “back office” so you can focus on selling and 
marketing. But there are also some basic approaches to search visibility, 
analysis, and business applications that you can check out on your own for 
little or no cost. You find out more about them in the second half of this 
chapter.

Choosing Channel Management Software
A special kind of service provider is designed specifically for businesses that 
maintain multiple sales channels — online, brick-and-mortar, flea markets, arts-
and-crafts shows — to help maintain their stores’ very different inventories.
For example, Brad Owens sells T-shirts and other merchandise at his Rock 
Shop Music and Comics store in the Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia. When 
a shirt is sold from that location, it needs to be removed from the inventory 
of Owens’s online store (www.rockshopmusicandcomics.com) or from his 
inventory on eBay, Amazon, or BigCommerce. Owens’s store and website are 
shown in Figure 16-1.

 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
Owens, who has been selling online for several years, doesn’t have the same 
selection of merchandise in his stores. He needed an automated solution for 
adjusting inventory.
“We had to have a solution that not only would work with Amazon, eBay, and 
our BigCommerce store, but could also manage inventory for our size varia­
tions among the three,” he says. “Instead of manually going into each channel 
and adjusting our inventory when an item is sold, it does that automatically. 
We can also manage orders within one interface. It’s also very easy to add 
items to a different channel.”
Owens is talking about ChannelGrabber (www.channelgrabber.com), a 
UK-based service provider that specializes in managing multiple sales chan­
nels for businesses. ChannelGrabber’s interface presents a business with all 
of its stores and products in a single spreadsheet-type grid (see Figure 16-2): 
Stores are arranged in columns, products in rows. A seller who manages mul­
tiple online stores can keep track of it all by looking at a single screen.

You pay a monthly fee to have such services handle your business. That’s 
on top of your Internet access fees, your store hosting fees, and other fees. 
ChannelGrabber, for example, costs 60 British pounds per month for its least 
expensive Standard package, which lets businesses sell up to 5,000 products 
per month. Here are some other channel management offerings you might 
consider:

368
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
	
✓	ChannelAdvisor (www.channeladvisor.com) has been helping busi­
nesses manage their inventory for years. The price you pay this service 
provider depends on the features you want, so e-mail them for a quote.
	
✓	Volusion (www.volusion.com) is a store provider and a shopping cart 
and payment service provider as well as a resource for managing more 
than one store. You get a website, mobile store, and Facebook store, 
plus a 10 percent discount on any additional stores you open. Plans 
range from $15 to $195 per month.
	
✓	Monsoon Pro (www.monsooncommerce.com/e-commerce-products/
monsoon-pro), part of Monsoon Commerce, lets businesses list products 
in multiple storefronts and track inventory. Fees vary depending on the 
number of products being sold, but they start at around $500 per month.
	
✓	Stone Edge (www.stoneedge.com) isn’t a channel management service 
per se, but a specialty back-end software provider, also part of Monsoon 
Commerce. Stone Edge enables businesses with multiple presences 
manage their fulfillment needs. Pricing is different than with other ser­
vices; you purchase a license for multiple workstations. Plans start at 
$4,000 per year for up to five workstations.
Each of these services represents an investment, to be sure. But if your busi­
ness is your livelihood and you aren’t able to maintain a large staff or IT 
department, a management package might make sense.
	
Make sure you get a return on investment (ROI) before investing in a channel 
management solution. When I asked ChannelGrabber CEO Daniel Williams at 
what point services like his make sense for small businesses, he said: “Don’t 
take on an expense unless you intend to receive a return on investment. Multi-
channel solutions like ChannelGrabber allow for you to realize ROI very early 
on by saving you time on simple but necessary tasks. ChannelGrabber should 
be used as an aid to the businesses wanting to automate as much as possible 
but also sell effectively without risking their feedback.”
Spreading the Word with Google
Mimi Kriele, who is featured in the preceding sidebar, emphasized the role of 
SEO in growing the visibility of her website and sales to her online business. 
When you look at Search Engine Optimization (SEO), the practice of optimizing 
your content to get the best placement in search results, you need to look 
first at Google.

 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
Sellers with multiple stores reach more customers
When I wrote previous editions of this book, 
eBay was the marketplace of choice for enter­
prising entrepreneurs. These days, Amazon.
com is the big player. You can read more about 
Amazon.com’s advantages as a store host and 
a shipping service in Chapter 14. Here, I focus 
on how one seller uses Amazon and Stone Edge 
to run a dozen online stores.
Mimi and Peter Kriele operate those Amazon-
based stores as well as their own website 
(https://.touchofeurope.net) from 
their home in Marietta, Georgia. Mimi says she 
could never keep track of it all without the help 
of her online management services.
“We don’t need to do anything special with 
managing our stores,” says Mimi. “We use the 
same management interface as an Amazon 
Seller Central account. All the orders come in 
to the same place. The interface tells us which 
web store the order is coming from. Because 
we have a broad inventory and we carry so 
many types of products, we decided to divide 
them into ‘microsites.’ One offers only choco­
late, for example. But the orders are pulled out 
of the same Amazon inventory.” The Krieles’ 
primary website is shown below.
A Touch of Europe offers products the Krieles 
grew up with and that were missing when 
they moved to the United States. “We know 
European products, and it turned out we weren’t 
the only ones missing things,” Mimi says.
Stone Edge is worth the expense, Mimi adds. 
“They have an amazing program. They inte­
grate the store and Amazon.com. They handle 
inventory, order management, order confirma­
tions for Amazon, and a lot of our shipping. I don’t 
know how we would be able to grow otherwise.”
She advises sellers to focus on developing 
their own websites and work on search engine 
optimization — and diversify their service pro­
viders. “As far as I am concerned, don’t put all 
your eggs in one basket,” she says.

370
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
Google started as a search engine — a website that organizes the contents of 
the entire Internet and makes information easy to find. It turns out that the 
same approaches that apply to organizing content and presenting search 
results apply to merchants as well as their goods and services. Google now 
makes millions by giving online businesspeople the ability to pay for ads 
that steer consumers to their websites. The site has branched out to supply 
a variety of new services, including free e-mail, web hosting, and business 
applications.
You owe it to yourself to pay attention to what Google has to offer and take 
advantage of its services. The sections that follow summarize the basics of 
using Google for marketing and publicity, two of the most important ways in 
which Google can help small businesses.
	
The practice of SEO is such an important and cost-effective marketing strategy 
for small businesses that Chapter 11 examines it in depth.
Getting yourself listed in 
the Google Directory
The Holy Grail for many online businesspeople is a ranking right at the top 
of Google’s search results — or at least on the first page of search results. I 
write a good deal about my brother’s website in this book not just because I 
want to give him free publicity, but also because he’s done some smart things 
to market his site and protect himself in a field in which he could get into 
legal trouble: copying and restoring records and other recordings.
When you do a search for “transfer LP to CD” on Google (at least at the time 
I wrote this chapter) and scan the search results, you find my brother’s web­
site (www.lp2cdsolutions.com) listed third on the first page of ten search 
results. (His site ranked number eight when I checked a couple years ago; he 
has been improving his search placement steadily.) He has done a lot of work 
to get to this point. He has submitted his site to Google and other search 
engines, updates his site frequently, asks other sites to exchange links with 
him, and more.
Following all of those steps is a good idea, but at the very least make sure 
you submit your site for inclusion in the Google Directory, exchange links 
with other websites, and maintain high-quality content on your pages.
Submitting your site for inclusion
Perhaps the simplest and most practical approach all businesses can take is 
to add the business’s URL to Google. I mention how to do this — by accessing 

371
 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
Google’s form for submitting a web page URL to the Directory (www.google.
com/addurl) — in Chapter 11. But I don’t mention one thing you should do 
when you fill out this form: Create your own description of your website. The 
description you type appears in Google’s search results. For example, with 
the www.lp2cdsolutions.com site, the Google search result description 
looks like this:
Transfer your LP collection (also 78, 45, 8-track, reel-to-reel . . . 
Audio restoration and transfer to CD of recordings (LP, 33, 78, 45, 
8-tracks, reel, cassette)” Drastically improve the sound of the 
original recording to . . .
The ellipses (. . .) are shown because the descriptions are too long to fit in 
the search results. Nevertheless, what does appear gets the message across. 
By taking the time to submit your own description instead of waiting for 
Google’s automated content-scouring programs called spiders to index your 
site, you can control exactly what appears in the search results and in the 
Directory as well. (A longer description you type appears in Google’s web 
directory.)
	
The Google Directory is a Yahoo!-style index to the contents of the Internet, 
arranged by category. Most people access the Google database of websites by 
using its well-known search page, which is also the site’s home page. To find 
the Directory, you have to burrow into the site: Go to the home page, click 
More, click Even More, and when the More Google Products page appears, 
click Directory under the Search heading.
Exchanging links with other websites
Google’s engine is smart enough that it doesn’t necessarily give a good 
ranking to websites that have added keywords and descriptions to their 
web pages. The search engine favors sites that are popular and frequently 
updated. A sign of popularity, from the search index program’s point of view, 
is the number of links made to a page. Another is the quality of the links— 
the more links you have to pages that are rich in content that is frequently 
updated, the more valuable your page must be, and the higher the ranking 
Google gives it.
One of the best ways to get better visibility in search results is to get other 
sites to link to you. How do you do it? You might automatically think of 
programs or technological shortcuts that can create links for you on other 
people’s websites. There are such tools, but the best way is to roll up your 
sleeves and create links the old-fashioned, time-consuming, human way: Look 
for sites that have products and services that complement yours, approach 
the owners of those sites, and ask to exchange links (“I’ll publicize your site if 
you publicize mine”). You find some examples of such links in Chapter 11.

372
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
	
Link exchanges are networks of online businesspeople who are specifically 
looking to increase their links to other sites. But Google discourages the use of 
such exchanges. At the very least, check out the sites you link to and make 
sure they are full of interesting content, not just “placeholder” pages or pages 
full of links.
Optimizing your site for 
better search results
For just about all online businesses, it’s important to get a good ranking in 
Google search results. Google’s exact formula for determining search result 
rankings is a well-kept secret. But again, you can take some simple and practi­
cal approaches to better your chances of getting placed near the top of the 
first page. Chapter 11 describes such strategies in more detail; I cover two 
other tips in the following sections.
Keeping it fresh
When you submit your site for inclusion in the Google Directory, you read 
the following instructional note: “Google updates its index on a regular basis, 
so updated or outdated link submissions are not necessary. Dead links will 
‘fade out’ of our index on our next crawl when we update our entire index.”
In other words, Google continually re-indexes the Web and ignores sites that 
are considered dead. A dead site is one that hasn’t been updated for a long 
time and that doesn’t receive many (or any) visits. To avoid becoming one of 
these cobweb sites, update some of your content on a regular basis.
You don’t have to update your whole site. If you have a blog online, you only 
have to make an entry every week (or better yet, every day) to keep your site 
fresh. Otherwise, make a commitment to change something — anything — on 
your site every week or so. This can be something as insignificant as the “last 
updated” date at the bottom of your web page or as significant as the page 
title. Just add a bit of information as often as you can; this practice not only 
improves your search results but also keeps your visitors coming back to 
you on a regular basis.
	
Some sites (for example, Google Guide, at www.googleguide.com) claim that 
popular web pages are re-indexed as often as they’re updated. I don’t know 
whether this is true. A post on Webmasterworld (www.webmasterworld.
com/forum10003/1015.htm) estimates that the index is updated several 
times a month, but Google employee Matt Cutts has been quoted as saying 
that the index is “incrementally updated every day (or faster).” On his blog, he 
reports that his own site has had more than 430 pages indexed in a day (www.
mattcutts.com/blog/more-webmaster-console-goodness). All of this 
means that you have another incentive to update your site as often as you can.

373
 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
Building in keywords
When Google’s automated indexing programs scour web pages, they ignore 
common words such as the, at, is, a, and how. What do they pay attention to? 
Keywords — nouns and verbs individuals might enter into Google’s search 
box when they’re looking for your site.
To determine what keywords your customers are likely to enter into the 
Google search box when they’re looking for you or your services, use a ser­
vice such as Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com), which suggests likely 
terms for you based on the name and content of your website.
Keywords do make a difference — especially if you place them in strategic 
locations such as the title of your page, the headings, and the first 50 or so 
words of text on a page. Sprinkle your web page text with key terms and 
How does your site rank? 
A peek behind the scenes
Google keeps its algorithm for ranking pages 
secret. But it’s generally known that Google 
assigns a web page a score called a PageRank. 
A patent request filed with the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office in 2010 indicates that 
PageRank might depend, in part, on how a user 
navigates based on a link. But PageRank is 
based on lots of different and complex factors. 
Although it dates back to December 2003 and 
the formulas for calculating PageRank have 
certainly evolved, an earlier patent application 
gives you plenty of clues for how the Google 
PageRank system operates. More recent com­
ments on Google employee Matt Cutts’ blog (for 
example, www.mattcutts.com/blog/
pagerank-sculpting) indicate that fresh­
ness of content, good organization, good use of 
keywords, and the speed with which pages load 
all play a role in calculating PageRank. Here are 
some tidbits from the 2003 patent application, 
which are still applicable today:
	✓	The history of the web page is important. 
This includes the date the page was first 
discovered by a search engine.
	✓	The frequency with which the content of 
the web page changes is also important. 
This includes an average time between 
the changes, a number of changes in a 
time period, and a comparison of a rate of 
change in a current time period with a rate 
of change in a previous time period.
	✓	The number of new pages associated with 
the document matters as well.
	✓	The amount of content that changes in 
proportion to the amount of content in the 
entire document matters, too.
	✓	How frequently the document is associated 
with search queries is taken into account.
These are just a few of the 63 separate claims 
listed in the patent request. You can read a 
detailed and more recent interpretation of 
PageRank at www.webworkshop.net/
pagerank.html. The claims all boil down to 
making your page worthwhile, keeping it up to 
date, and promoting as many links as you can 
to other websites and from those sites to yours.

374
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
don’t worry about repeating them from page to page. The more frequently 
they appear, the better your chances of ending up number one.
	
Having Google’s spider programs crawling through your web pages isn’t 
always a good idea. Some webmasters don’t like to give all their content (such 
as newspaper or magazine articles) away for free. However, you can block 
indexing programs such as Google’s from including your pages in their index. 
Include a simple text file named robots.txt and identify the automated 
program you want to block or the pages on your site that you don’t want 
indexed. Then post this text file on your website. Google provides instructions 
for people who want to block indexing programs at support.google.com/
webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=156449.
Adding Google Apps to Your Business
Website hosting and business applications are particularly important to 
small organizations that don’t have in-house information technology (IT) 
staff. Google has created a set of similar services, called Google Apps (www.
google.com/apps).
After December 6, 2012, the Standard (or free) version of Google Apps, 
which is recommended for personal use, was discontinued. If you signed up 
for Google Apps Standard before that date, you can continue to use it now. 
Otherwise, you need to sign up for Google Apps for Business, which cost $5 
per user per month or $50 per user per year. For that price, you get 25GB of 
storage space for Gmail and 5GB of space for files. If you need more space, 
you can buy more. For an additional $4 per month, you get 20GB of additional 
space, for example. With either version, you pay a $12 per year fee to regis­
ter a .com domain name. If you’re frustrated with login problems and slow 
performance of similar applications such as Microsoft’s Office 365 service, 
Google Apps might be just the ticket.
	
For more information on Google Apps for Business pricing and features, see 
the Google Apps for Business page (www.google.com/enterprise/apps/
business/pricing.html).
Becoming master of a domain
Like Yahoo! Small Business and other hosting services, Google gives small 
businesses the ability to register a domain name. Google offer services in a 
wide variety of names, including the .com, .org, .biz, and .info domains. 
This is a somewhat wider range of options than other services offer.

375
 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
	
It’s often a good idea to “lock down” the same domain name in many different 
domains; for example, I paid an extra fee to GoDaddy to register not only 
gregholden.com but also gregholden.net and gregholden.org so that 
others couldn’t purchase them.
You don’t have to obtain a brand-new domain to take advantage of Google 
Apps. If you already own a domain, you can associate Google Apps with it. 
Whether you already have a domain or want to get one through Google, and 
whether you have the Standard or Business edition, the initial steps are the 
same. The following steps illustrate how to get started with Business edition:
	
1.	Go to the Google Apps for Business Welcome page at www.google.
com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html and click the Get Started 
Now button.
	
	The first signup page appears.
	
2.	Enter your personal information and click Next.
	
	A domain name signup page appears.
	
3.	Enter the domain you want to use with Google Apps or purchase a 
new one.
	
	If you don’t already own a domain name, click the I would like to 
Buy a new Domain now link on the right half of the page, select the 
domain (such as .com) from the drop-down list, and then click Check 
Availability. When you have a domain, your browser displays a page 
stating that your domain is available, and you can register a .com name 
with Google for one year for $12. Other domains have different prices.
	
4.	Click Next.
	
5.	Enter information about your organization and click Continue.
	
6.	Create a username and password to create your Google Apps account, 
and type the characters seen in the box to prove you’re not an auto­
mated indexing program called a “robot.”
	
7.	Review the terms of service, and then click the Accept and signup 
button.
	
	 A page appears, asking you to verify your account.
Verifying ownership
After you obtain a domain and sign up for the service, you need to verify that 
you own the site. After you complete verification, one option you have is to 
identify your domain name registrar (the company from which you purchased 

376
Part IV: Expanding Beyond Your Website 
your domain name). You choose the registrar from a list and sign in to it with 
your username and password for that company (not Google Apps, but your 
registrar). Then follow the steps provided; they vary depending on your 
registrar.
One other option is to change the CNAME record for your domain registration. 
If you have an existing website, you already know how to upload a file to it, 
so you should choose that option. If you don’t have a website (for example, 
if you registered your domain name but haven’t created any pages for it), 
choose the CNAME option. The following steps assume that you already have 
a business website and want to upload a file:
	
1.	Create a web page HTML file and name the file googlehosted
service.html. 
	
	 You have to insert a string of characters, which Google gives you.
	
2.	Upload the file to your website. 
	
	 Make sure the file is in the same directory as your home page.
	
3.	Click the I’ve Completed the Steps Above button.
	
	 Google Apps offers you the chance to launch its Setup guide. If you click 
Skip this Guide, the Dashboard page, shown in Figure 16-3, appears.
	
When you first sign up for Google Apps, you go to your Dashboard page. You 
use this page to access all the apps for which you signed up. Simply signing up 
for a service isn’t enough to start working on it. You need to activate it from 
the Dashboard.

377
 Chapter 16: Managing and Growing Your Online Business
The details on creating a web page and uploading it to the server that hosts 
your site vary, depending on the type of software you use to create web pages. 
Creating a web page is as simple as opening a text editor (such as Notepad), 
adding the <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> tags that define a web 
page, and saving the document with the .htm or .html file extension. If you 
use a program such as Dreamweaver to create your web pages, the process is 
even easier. You can upload the file using a file transfer program, such as WS 
FTP or CuteFTP, or a web editor that has FTP capabilities. See Chapter 5 for 
details on working with web editors.
The Dashboard page allows you to add new services (Google Apps, in other 
words) to your domain. You also use the Dashboard page to create new 
user accounts for your colleagues (see the following section, “Creating user 
accounts).”
After verifying ownership and accessing your Dashboard, you’ll want to 
create a Start page for your Google Apps domain. The Start page is where 
you and your small business co-workers can check your Gmail inboxes, see 
shared calendars, and view links that you provide for them. Your Start page 
takes the form http://partnerpage.google.com/domain. For example, 
if your domain were gregholden.com, your Start page would be http://
partnerpage.google.com/gregholden.com.
Creating user accounts
Google Apps isn’t really intended for a lone user working in isolation. If 
you’re a one-person shop, you can obtain a Gmail account for yourself and 
create your web pages through the web page creation service or application 
of your choice. Google Apps excels (to use a Microsoft pun) in giving a group 
of users an easy and free way to share information. To allow others into your 
Google Apps–powered domain, create user accounts. You have room for 50 
separate accounts in your domain in the Standard Edition of Google Apps, so 
there’s plenty of room to grow.
To add user accounts, follow these steps:
	
1.	From your Google Apps Dashboard page, click the Create a New User 
link.
	
2.	On the next page (shown in Figure 16-4), enter the username of the 
new user.
	
	 The username takes the form of username@domainname. You’re 
assigned a temporary password; when the user logs in with this 
password, he or she can create a new one.

Figure 16-4:

that need to

3.	Click Create New User to create the account.
	
4.	When you’re done, click the Create Another User button and repeat 
Steps 2 and 3 to create accounts for everyone in your workgroup.
	
	 Be sure to write down the temporary password for each account you 
create and send it to the account holder.
	
	 Click the User Accounts link to view the list of all the accounts in your 
domain and to track when users logged in most recently.
	
5.	Send an announcement to all users in your workgroup, telling them 
that the Google Apps service has been added to your domain.
	
	 On the Dashboard page, click the Create Email List link and assign the 
mailing list with its own e-mail address, such as mailings@mydomain.
com. Then add users in your domain to a domain mailing list. When you 
want to communicate with everyone simultaneously, you or other users 
can simply send a single message to the mailing list’s e-mail list, and all 
the members on the list receive that message.
	
Even if you’re the administrator for your domain and plan to use the adminis­
trator account, create an account for your personal use so that you can keep 
e-mail and other information separate.

s the field of e-commerce becomes more competitive and enterprising 
businesspeople find new ways to produce content online, e-litigation, 
e-patents, e-trademarks, and other means of legal protection multiply cor­
respondingly. The courts are increasingly called upon to resolve smaller 
e-squabbles and, literally, lay down the e-law.
Many of the recent legal cases in the news concern the proliferation of con­
tent on popular file-sharing sites and other web resources. For example, in 
2006, the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law sued the 
classified ad service Craigslist for violating the Federal Fair Housing Act 
because of real estate postings that contained discriminating messages, 
such as “No Minorities.” In 2009, the Cook County Sheriff in Illinois went after 
Craigslist, alleging that the site abets prostitution through ads in the “erotic 
services” area of its website. Craigslist prevailed on both lawsuits by having 
each dismissed by the courts under a safe harbor provision of federal law.
Obviously, there is some built-in protection for sites like Craigslist that publish 
user-generated content (UGC). (YouTube and eBay are two other prominent 
UGC websites, of course.) But it is clear that those who publish their own 
information online can be liable if they break the law. A Florida woman was 
awarded $11.3 million in a defamation lawsuit filed against a Louisiana woman 
who posted messages on the Internet calling her a “crook,” a “con artist,” 
and a “fraud.” The case was seen as a warning to bloggers and other website 
owners. The point: Be sure that what you publish doesn’t break the law.
In previous years, big e-commerce players, such as Microsoft and Google, 
were involved in patent and trademark disputes. In 2007, a company called

Savvysoft ended a dispute with Microsoft when it changed the name of its 
TurboExcel product to Calc4Web. Microsoft had charged that intellectual 
property rights associated with its trademark Excel (a spreadsheet program) 
had been violated. In the summer of 2004, Microsoft decided to settle a 
lawsuit it filed in the U.S. courts by paying $20 million to stop a company — 
Lindows.com — from infringing on its trademarked name Windows.
The message for you as a new business owner is ignorance isn’t an excuse. 
This area may well make you nervous because you lack experience in busi­
ness law and you don’t have a lot of money to hire lawyers and accountants. 
You don’t want to be discovering for the first time about copyright law or the 
concept of intellectual property when you’re in the midst of a dispute. In this 
chapter, I give you a snapshot of legal issues you can’t afford to ignore. With 
luck, this information can help you head off trouble before it occurs.
Note: David M. Adler of the Chicago law firm David M. Adler, Esq. & Associates, 
PC (www.ecommerceattorney.com), reviewed the original draft of this chapter 
for accuracy. Adler and his firm specialize in legal issues facing businesses that 
want to conduct e-commerce. Adler advises: “This chapter is a good starting 
point. But it cannot begin to explain all the issues in all their complexity, and 
[it] should be regarded as just the beginning of a discussion with a competent 
lawyer who will look in detail at your individual facts and situation.”
Understanding Trade Names 
and Trademarks
A trade name is the name by which a business is known in the marketplace. A 
trade name can also be a trademark, even though it hasn’t been registered as 
such. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines a trademark as 
“a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of words, phrases, sym­
bols, or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of 
one party from those of others.” Big corporations protect their trade names 
and trademarks jealously, and sometimes court battles erupt over who can 
legally use a name.
	
Although you may never get in a trademark battle and you may never regis­
ter a trademark, be careful which trade name you pick and how you use it. 
Choose a trade name that’s easy to remember so that people can associate 
it with your company and return to you often when they’re looking for the 
products or services. Also, as part of taking your new business seriously and 
planning for success, you may want to protect your right to use your name by 
registering it as a trademark. You may do this at the federal level through the 
USPTO or register it in your state or the states in which you conduct business.

383
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
You can use as a trademark any visual element that accompanies a particu­
lar tangible product or line of goods and serves to identify and distinguish it 
from products sold by other sources. In other words, a trademark isn’t neces­
sarily just your business’s trade name. In fact, you can use as a trademark let­
ters, words, names, phrases, slogans, numbers, colors, symbols, designs, or 
shapes. Take a look at the cover of this book. Look closely and see how many 
™ or ® symbols you see. The same trademarked items are shown on the For 
Dummies website, which is shown in Figure 17-1.
	
Figure 17-1: 
You don’t 
have to 
use special 
symbols to 
designate 
logos or 
phrases 
on your 
website, 
but you may 
want to.
	
	
You can use the ™ symbol with anything you deem to be your trademark and 
that would be protected by common law rights. However, you must only use 
trademarks that have passed the requirements imposed by the federal govern­
ment and become registered through the USPTO. Your trademark may carry 
the ® symbol and in addition to any common law rights, would be protected 
by the rights gained through USPTO registration.
	
For most small businesses, the problem with trademarks isn’t so much protect­
ing your own; rather, it is avoiding infringing the trademark rights of others. As 
a prudent businessperson, you should exercise due diligence to research the 
name you want to use to make sure that you don’t run into trouble.

Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
Determining whether a trademark 
is up for grabs
To avoid getting sued for trademark infringement and possibly suffering through 
its consequences (the cost of litigation, having to change your trade name or 
trademark, or paying damages), conduct a trademark search before you settle 
on a trade name. You want to find out if there are any potential conflicts 
between your trade name and someone else’s. Ideally, you conduct the search 
before you actually use your trade name or register for an official trademark.
“If you don’t have a registered trademark, your trade name becomes very dif­
ficult to protect,” comments David Adler, the attorney quoted in the introduc­
tion to this chapter. “It’s a good idea to do a basic search on the Internet. But 
keep in mind that just because you don’t find a name on the Internet doesn’t 
mean it doesn’t exist. Follow that up with a trademark search. You don’t want 
to spend all the money required to develop a brand name only to find that it 
isn’t yours.”
There are three ways you can do a trademark search:
	
✓	Search the old-fashioned, manual way by visiting one of the Patent 
and Trademark Depository Libraries. They’re listed online at www.
uspto.gov/products/library/ptdl/locations/index.jsp. 
Although time-consuming, this approach doesn’t cost anything.
	
✓	Pay a professional search firm to do the research for you. Look for 
professional search firms in the Yellow Pages under Trademark 
Consultants or Information Brokers. (You can also try SuperPages.com 
at www.superpages.com/yellowpages/C-Trademark+Consultants+
&+Searches.) You can expect to pay $25–$50 per trademark searched. 
More complete searches that cover registered and unregistered marks 
that are similar to the one you want to use can cost several hundred 
dollars.
	
✓	Conduct a search online. You can use the web to help you conduct 
a trademark search. The best place to go is TESS, the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office’s federal trademark database. It’s convenient and free. 
Just go to www.uspto.gov and click Search for Trademarks.
	
Cyberspace goes beyond national boundaries. A trademark search in your 
own country may not be enough. Most industrialized countries, including the 
United States, have signed international treaties that enable trademark owners 
in one country to enforce their rights against infringement by individuals in 
another country. Conducting an international trademark search is difficult to 
do yourself, so you may want to pay someone to do the searching for you.

385
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
	
The consequences of failing to conduct a reasonably thorough trademark 
search can be severe. In part, the consequences depend on how widely you 
distribute the protected item. For example, on the Internet, one may deter­
mine that you have distributed it worldwide. If you attempt to use a trademark 
that’s been federally registered by someone else, you could go to court and be 
prevented from using the trademark again. You may even be liable for dam­
ages and attorney’s fees. So it’s best to be careful.
Protecting your trade name
The legal standard is that you get the rights to your trade name when you 
begin using it. You get the right to exclude others from using it when you reg­
ister. But when you apply to register a trademark, you record the date of its 
first use. Effectively, then, the day you start using a name is when you actu­
ally obtain the rights to use it for trade.
In addition to a federal trademark law, each state has its own set of laws 
establishing when and how trademarks can be protected. You can obtain 
trademark rights in the states in which the mark is actually used, but attor­
ney Adler says a federally registered trademark can trump such rights. It’s 
important to also file an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office, but only if your trademark will be used beyond your state’s borders. 
You are eligible to apply for national registration of your trademark only if 
you plan to use your trademark in interstate commerce.
After researching your trade name against existing trademarks, you can file 
an application with the Patent and Trademark Office online by following 
these steps:
	
1.	Go to the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) home 
page (www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/index.jsp), as shown in 
Figure 17-2.
	
	 This page includes links to forms and instructions on how to fill out your 
application online.
	
2.	Click the Initial Application Form link, which is on the page under the 
Forms heading.
	
	 A page with a list of application forms appears.
	
3.	Click the Trademark/Servicemark Application, Principal Register link.
	
	The Selection of Application Type page appears.
	
4.	Choose the type of form that applies to you and click Continue.
	
	 The Trademark/Servicemark Application Form Wizard page appears.

	 A form entitled Correspondence Information appears.
	
8.	Review the correspondence information, make any corrections 
needed, and click Continue.
	
	 The Signature Information page appears.
	
9.	Type your signature, date, and position, and click the Validate button 
at the bottom of the form.
	
	 If you filled out all the fields correctly, a Validation screen appears. If 
not, you return to the original form page so that you can correct it.
	
10.	Print the special declaration to support the adoption of the electronic 
signature and retain it for your records; then click the Submit button.
	
	 You receive a confirmation screen if your transmission is successful. 
Later, you receive an e-mail acknowledgment of your submission.
Generally, each state has its own trademark laws, which apply only to trade­
marks that are used within a single state. Products that are sold in more than 
one state (such as those sold on the Internet) can be protected under the 
federal Lanham Act, which provides for protection of registered trademarks. 
To comply with the Lanham Act, register your trademark, as I describe in the 
preceding steps.

387
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
Trademark registration can take 18–24 months. It’s not uncommon to have an 
application returned. Often, an applicant receives a correspondence called 
an Office Action that either rejects part of the application or raises a question 
about it. If you receive such a letter, don’t panic. You need to go to a lawyer 
who specializes in or is familiar with trademark law and who can help you 
respond to the correspondence. In the meantime, you can still operate your 
business with your trade name. You can also fill out and submit a form that 
communicates your intent to use a trademark, which enables you to use a 
trademark before it’s registered.
	
Trademarks listed in the USPTO register can last indefinitely provided you 
follow all of the maintenance requirements. You don’t have to use the ™ or ® 
symbol when you publish your trademark, but doing so not only impresses 
upon people how seriously you take your business and its identity, but affords 
you certain remedies should someone else infringe your trademark.
Making sure your domain 
name stays yours
The practice of choosing a domain name for an online business is related to 
the concept of trade names and trademarks. By now, with cybersquatters 
and other businesspeople snapping up domain names since 1994 or so, it’s 
unlikely that your ideal name is available in the popular .com domain. Here 
are two common problems:
	
✓	Someone else has already taken the domain name related to the name of 
your existing business.
	
✓	The domain name you choose is close to one that already exists or 
to another company with a similar name. (Remember the Microsoft 
Windows/Lindows.com dispute that I mention early in this chapter.)
If a domain name is already taken, you have some options. You can contact 
the owner of the domain name and offer to buy it. Alternatively, you can 
choose a domain name with another suffix. If a dot-com name isn’t available, 
try the old standby alternatives, .org (which, in theory at least, is for non­
profit organizations) and .net (which is for network providers).
You can also choose one of the newer Top-Level Domains (TLDs), a second 
set of domain name suffixes that were made available a few years ago, which 
include .biz for businesses, .info for general use, and .name for personal 
names. You can find out more about the more recent TLDs at the InterNIC 
website (www.internic.net/faqs/new-tlds.html).

388
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
	
You can always get around the fact that your perfect domain name isn’t avail­
able by changing the name slightly. For example, rather than treesurgeon.
com, you might choose tree-surgeon.com or treesurgery.com. But be 
careful lest you violate someone else’s trademark and get into a dispute with 
the holder of the other domain name. A court may order you to stop using the 
name and pay damages to the other domain name’s owner.
On the other hand, if you’ve been doing business for a while and have a 
trademark you feel has superior rights, you may find that someone else 
owns the domain name. You can assert your rights and raise a dispute 
yourself. To resolve the dispute, you could go to a group such as the WIPO 
Arbitration and Mediation Center (arbiter.wipo.int/center/index.
html) or ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
(www.icann.org). But first, find out more about what constitutes trade­
mark infringement and how to enforce a trademark. Go to Nolo.com’s Legal 
Encyclopedia (www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia); scroll down and 
click the Intellectual Property Law: Patent, Copyright & Trademark section; 
click the Trademark Law link; click After You Register Your Trademark; 
and then click Enforcing Your Trademark Rights rather than Practicing Safe 
Copyright.
What’s the difference between a trademark and a copyright? Trademarks are 
covered by trademark law and are distinctive words, symbols, slogans, or 
other things that serve to identify products or services in the marketplace. 
Copyright refers to the creator’s ownership of creative works, such as writ­
ing, art, software, video, or cinema (but not names, titles, or short phrases). 
Copyright also provides the owner with redress in case someone copies the 
work without the owner’s permission. Copyright is a legal device that enables 
the creator of a work to control how the work is used.
Although copyright protects the way ideas, systems, and processes are 
embodied in the book, record, photo, or whatever, it doesn’t protect the 
idea, system, or process itself. In other words, if Abraham Lincoln were writ­
ing the Gettysburg Address today, his exact words could be copyrighted, but 
the general ideas he expressed couldn’t be.
	
Even if nobody ever called you a nerd, as a businessperson who produces 
goods and services of economic value, you may be the owner of intellectual 
property. Intellectual property is a broad descriptor and not only can refer to 
works of authorship, but also includes trademarks, inventions, trade secrets, 
and other proprietary information. Because intellectual property can be 
owned, bought, and sold just like other types of property, it’s important that 
you know something about the laws governing intellectual property. Having 
this information maximizes the value of your products and keeps you from 
throwing away potentially valuable assets or finding yourself at the wrong end 
of an expensive lawsuit.

389
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
Counting on copyright
These days, the controversy regarding copyright on the web centers on the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which covers all forms of digital 
content on the Internet. Among other things, the DMCA calls for Internet 
radio stations to pay high royalty fees to record labels for music they play. 
The DMCA contains at least one provision that has implications for all online 
businesses: Internet service providers (ISPs) are expected to remove material 
from any customer websites that appears to constitute copyright infringe­
ment. So it pays to know something about copyright.
Everything you see on the Internet is copyrighted, whether or not a copyright 
notice actually appears. Copyright exists from the moment a work is fixed in 
a tangible medium, including a web page. For example, plenty of art is avail­
able for the taking on the web, but look before you grab. Unless an image 
on the web is specified as being copyright free, you violate copyright law if 
you take it. HTML tags themselves aren’t copyrighted, but the content of the 
HTML-formatted page is. General techniques for designing web pages aren’t 
copyrighted, but certain elements (such as logos, which are essentially trade­
marks) are.
	
It’s okay to use a work for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, 
scholarship, or research. That comes under the fair use limitation. (See the 
next sidebar, “Fair use . . . and how not to abuse it,” for more information.) 
However, I still contend that it’s best to get permission or cite your source in 
these cases, just to be safe.
Fair use . . . and how not to abuse it
Copyright law doesn’t cover everything. One of 
the major limitations is the doctrine of fair use, 
which is described in Section 107 of the U.S. 
Copyright Act. The law states that fair use of a 
work is use that doesn’t infringe copyright “for 
purposes such as criticism, comment, news 
reporting, teaching (including multiple copies 
for classroom use), scholarship, or research.” 
You can’t copy text from online magazines or 
newsletters and call it fair use because the text 
was originally news reporting.
Fair use has some big gray areas that can be 
traps for people who provide information on 
the Internet. Don’t fall into one of these traps. 
Shooting off a quick e-mail asking someone for 
permission to reproduce his or her work isn’t dif­
ficult. Chances are that person will be flattered 
and let you make a copy as long as you give 
him or her credit on your site. Fair use depends 
entirely on the unique circumstances of each 
case, and this is an area in which, if you have any 
questions, you should consult with an attorney.

390
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
Making copyright work for you
A copyright — which protects original works of authorship — costs nothing, 
applies automatically, and lasts more than 50 years. When you affix a copy­
right notice to your newsletter or website, you make your readers think twice 
about unauthorized copying and put them on notice that you take copyright 
seriously. You can go a step farther and register your work with the U.S. 
Copyright Office.
Creating a good copyright notice
Even though any work you do is protected automatically by copyright, 
having some sort of notice expresses your copyright authority in a more 
official way. Copyright notices identify the author of a given work (such as 
writing or software) and then spell out the terms by which that author grants 
others the right (or the license) to copy that work to their computer and read 
it (or use it). The usual copyright notice is pretty simple and takes this form:
Copyright 2013 [Your Name]. All rights reserved.
You don’t have to use the © symbol, but it does make your notice look more 
official. In order to create a copyright symbol that appears on a web page, 
you have to enter a special series of characters in the HTML source code for 
your page. For example, web browsers translate the characters &copy; as 
the copyright symbol, which is displayed as © in the web browser window. 
Most web page creation tools provide menu options for inserting special 
symbols such as this one.
Copyright notices can also be more informal, and a personal message can 
have extra impact. ESA/Hubble, which operates the Hubble space telescope, 
has a web page devoted to how others can reproduce its incredible images of 
the universe (www.spacetelescope.org/copyright).
	
Creative Commons has extensive information about how to make your work 
available to others either on a “fair use” basis or for commercial use. See 
wiki.creativecommons.org/Main_Page for more information.
Protecting your products with digital watermarks
In traditional offset printing, a watermark is a faint image embedded in sta­
tionery or other paper. The watermark usually bears the name of the paper 
manufacturer, but it can also identify an organization for which the stationery 
was made.
Watermarking has its equivalent in the online world. Graphic artists sometimes 
use digital watermarking to protect images they create. This process involves 
adding copyright or other information about the image’s owner to the digital 
image file. This information may or may not be visible. (Some images have 
copyright information added; it’s not visible in the body of the web page but in 

391
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
the image file itself.) Other images have a watermark pasted right into the vis­
ible area, which makes it difficult for others to copy and reuse them. Digimarc 
(www.digimarc.com), which functions as a plug-in application with the popu­
lar graphics tools Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com) and PaintShop Pro 
(www.corel.com), is one of the most widely used watermarking tools.
Doing the paperwork on your copyright
You have copyright over the materials you publish on the web, but there’s 
a difference between having a copyright and having a registered copyright. 
Registering your copyright is something I recommend for small businesses 
because it’s inexpensive, easy to do, and affords you an extra degree of pro­
tection. Having registered your copyright gives your case more weight in 
the event of a copyright dispute. It enables you to claim statutory damages 
of $150,000 if you can prove that an infringement occurred. You don’t need 
to register, but doing so shows a court how serious you are about obtaining 
protection for your work.
Registering copyright is a breeze compared to the process of registering a 
trademark. To register your work, you can download a short application 
form from the U.S. Copyright Office website at www.copyright.gov/forms. 
This form is in Adobe Acrobat PDF format, so you need Acrobat Reader to 
view it. (Adobe Acrobat Reader is a free application that you can download 
at www.adobe.com.) You can then send the form by snail mail, along with 
a check for $65 and a printed copy of the work you’re protecting, to Library 
of Congress, Copyright Office, 101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, DC 
20559-6000. (You can also file online for $35.)
Licensing and Other Restrictions
Another set of legal concerns that you must be aware of when you start an 
online business involves any license fees or restrictions that are levied by 
local agencies. Some fees are specific to businesses that have incorporated, 
which brings up the question of whether you should consider incorporation 
for your own small business. (I discuss the legal concerns and pros and cons 
of incorporation in the “Deciding on a Legal Form for Your Business” section, 
later in this chapter.)
Heeding local regulations
Before you get too far along with your online business, make sure that you’ve 
met any local licensing requirements that apply. For example, in my county in 
the state of Illinois, I had to pay a $10 fee to register my sole proprietorship. 
In return, I received a nice certificate that made everything feel official.

392
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
Other localities may have more stringent requirements, however. Check with 
your city, county, and state licensing and/or zoning offices. Trade associations 
for your profession often have a wealth of information about local regulations 
as well. Also, check with your local chamber of commerce. If you fail to apply 
for a permit or license, you may find yourself paying substantial fines.
The kinds of local regulations to which a small business may be susceptible 
include the following:
	
✓	Zoning: Your city or town government may have zoning ordinances that 
prevent you from conducting business in an area that is zoned for resi­
dential use, or it may charge you a fee to operate a business out of your 
home. This policy varies by community; even if your web host resides in 
another state, your local government may still consider your home the 
location of your business. Check with your local zoning department.
	
✓	Doing Business As: If your business name is different from your own 
name, you may have to file a Doing Business As (DBA) certificate and 
publish a notice of the filing in the local newspaper. Check with your city 
or county clerk’s office for more information.
	
✓	Taxes: Some states and cities levy taxes on small businesses, and some 
even levy property tax on business assets, such as office furniture and 
computer equipment.
Knowing what restrictions 
may affect your trade
If you’re planning to sell your goods and services overseas, be aware of any 
trade restrictions that may apply to your business. In particular, you need to 
be careful if any of the following applies:
	
✓	You trade in foodstuffs or agricultural products.
	
✓	You sell software that uses some form of encryption.
	
✓	Your clients live in countries with which your home country has 
imposed trade restrictions.
Avoiding Conflicts with Your Customers
There are several ways you can get into legal trouble with the very people 
you rely on for your business success:

393
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
	
✓	You fail to deliver something that a customer purchased. The cus­
tomer can seek a refund from the marketplace through which you sell 
(eBay, for example). Organizations such as eBay have dispute resolution 
processes available to resolve customer disputes. If you are found liable, 
you must issue a refund or you’ll be blocked from using the marketplace 
again.
	
✓	You deliver late, or the merchandise isn’t what you described. The 
customer can complain to the marketplace and leave bad feedback for 
you, which can damage your reputation.
	
✓	You send out “spam,” or unsolicited e-mail. In severe cases, the govern­
ment can go after you and arrest you. This has happened with spammers 
found guilty of sending out millions of unwanted e-mail messages (see 
www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18955115 for an example).
	
✓	You fail to safeguard your customers’ personal information. Hackers 
can rifle through unsecured computers and steal credit card numbers. 
Depending on the type of business you run, a number of government 
agencies can come after you for allowing identify theft to happen. As 
an example, you can see the list of financial consumer alerts from the 
State of Washington’s Department of Financial Institutions at www.dfi.
wa.gov/consumers/alerts.htm.
Offending your customers can have consequences for your business that go 
beyond legal trouble. People who aren’t happy with you can leave comments 
on message boards that hurt your reputation. In some cases, disgruntled 
consumers sometimes go to the effort of creating web pages such as I Hate 
Starbucks (www.ihatestarbucks.com) to voice their anger at a merchant.
Deciding on a Legal Form 
for Your Business
Picking a legal form for your online business enables you to describe it to city 
and county agencies as well as to the financial institutions you deal with. A 
legal type of business is one that is recognized by taxing and licensing agencies. 
You have a number of options to choose among, and the choice can affect 
the amount of taxes you pay and your liability in case of loss. The following 
sections describe your alternatives.

legal and financial aspects of starting and operating a small business in Small 
Business For Dummies, 4th Edition.

Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
Sole proprietorship
In a sole proprietorship, you’re the only boss. You make all the decisions and 
get all the benefits. You take all the risk, too. This is the simplest and least 
expensive type of business because you can run it yourself. You don’t need 
an accountant or lawyer to help you form the business, and you don’t have to 
answer to partners or stockholders, either. To declare a sole proprietorship, 
you may have to file an application with your county clerk.
Partnership
In a partnership, you share the risk and profit with at least one other person. 
Ideally, your partners bring skills to the endeavor that complement your own. 
One obvious advantage to a partnership is that you can discuss decisions 
and problems with your partners. All partners are held personally liable for 
losses. The rate of taxes each partner pays is based on his or her percentage 
of income from the partnership.
	
If you decide to strike up a partnership with someone, drawing up a partner­
ship agreement is a good idea. Although you aren’t legally required to do so, 
such an agreement clearly spells out the duration of the partnership and the 
responsibilities of each person involved. Without such an agreement, the divi­
sion of liabilities and assets is considered to be equal, regardless of how much 
more effort one person has put into the business than the other.
Advantages of a statutory business entity
A statutory business entity is a business whose form is created by statute, such 
as a corporation or a limited liability company (LLC). If sole proprietorships 
and partnerships are so simple to start and operate, why would you con­
sider incorporating? After all, you almost certainly need a lawyer to help you 
incorporate. Plus, you have to comply with the regulations made by federal 
and state agencies that oversee corporations. Besides that, you may undergo 
a type of double taxation: If your corporation earns profits, those profits are 
taxed at the corporate rate, and any shareholders have to pay income tax at 
the personal rate.
Despite these downsides, you may consider incorporation for the following 
reasons:
	
✓	If you have employees, you can deduct any health and disability insur­
ance premiums you pay for them. (As a sole proprietor, you can deduct 
your own health insurance premiums.)
	
✓	You can raise capital by offering stock for sale.

395
 Chapter 17: Keeping It All Legal
	
✓	It’s easier to transfer ownership from one shareholder to another.
	
✓	The company’s principals are shielded from liability in case of lawsuits.
If you offer services that may be susceptible to costly lawsuits, incorporation 
or forming an LLC may be the way to go. If you choose a corporation, you then 
have two options: a subchapter S corporation or a C corporation. Although it 
depends on many factors, the LLC is a good choice for many small businesses. 
Because there can be only one shareholder/owner— you— it may give you 
more flexibility in the structure and formalities the LLC may be required to 
keep over incorporation.
Subchapter S corporations
One benefit of forming a subchapter S corporation is liability protection. 
This form of incorporation enables startup businesses that encounter losses 
early on to offset those losses against their personal income. Subchapter S is 
intended for businesses with fewer than 75 shareholders. The income gained 
by an S corporation is subject only to personal tax, not to corporate tax.
You might designate that you’re the president, your cousin Nick is the secretary, 
and other relatives serve as your shareholders and officers. Many corporations 
that are run by one or two people have only one shareholder(s) meeting a 
year, which may be simply a document signed by all of the shareholders stat­
ing that the meeting took place and reporting on what happened. While an 
experienced attorney can make this procedure painless (of course, it comes 
with attorney fees), it can be accomplished by the business principals as well.
Sounds great, doesn’t it? Before you start looking for a lawyer to get you 
started, consider the following:
	
✓	Incorporation typically costs several hundred dollars.
	
✓	Depending on your state, corporations may have to pay an annual fee or 
tax.
	
✓	Attorneys’ fees can be expensive.
	
✓	It can take weeks or months for your filing for S corporation status to be 
received and approved. (You need to meet your state’s requirements for 
setting up a corporation and then file IRS tax Form 2553 to elect S corpo­
ration status.)
All these facts can be daunting for a lone entrepreneur who’s just starting out 
and has only a few customers. But my brother Mike, who owns an audio res­
toration business called lp2cdsolutions (www.lp2cdsolutions.com), did 
create an S corporation, so his liability is limited: In case of a lawsuit, assum­
ing that no illegal conduct occurs on the part of the owner, the corporation is 
sued, not him personally. I recommend that you wait until you have enough 
income to hire an attorney and pay incorporation fees before you seriously 
consider incorporating, even as an S corporation.

396
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
C corporations
Any small business that incorporates is considered a C corporation unless it 
files to be considered an S corporation. Given the double taxation I mention 
earlier, you need to be sure you intend to be a C corporation (for various rea­
sons) or make the appropriate filings with the IRS, which is a time-sensitive 
matter. Being a C corporation is probably not right for your small entrepre­
neurial business, but if you neglect to follow the appropriate procedure, you 
may become one whether you meant to or not.
Most C corporations tend to be large and have lots of shareholders. To incor­
porate, all stockholders and shareholders must agree on the name of the 
corporation, the people who will manage it, and many other issues. Because 
of the double taxation in connection with C corporations, contact a tax pro­
fessional if you have questions about this business entity or are thinking of 
creating one.
Limited liability companies
The limited liability company (LLC) has been around for some time now but 
compared with the corporation, it is a relatively new type of entity structure 
that combines aspects of both partnerships and corporations. The govern­
ment fees required to create an LLC vary depending on your state and that 
doesn’t include an attorney’s fees should you choose to hire one to form 
your LLC. You may also (like the corporate form) have to pay a yearly fee to 
maintain your LLC. And you may need to have yearly meetings at which you 
report on the state of the corporation. However, LLCs have some attractive 
options that make them good candidates for small businesses:
	
✓	Members have limited liability for debts and obligations of the LLC.
	
✓	LLCs are not double taxed.
	
✓	The individual investors, or members, share income and losses.
When an LLC is comprised of more than one owner, the responsibilities of 
the LLC members are spelled out in an operating agreement, an often-complex 
document that should be prepared by a knowledgeable attorney. If the LLC 
is comprised of a single member, such responsibilities are embodied in an 
operating declaration.

Incorporate?” that details more costs related to incorporation. Check it out at

n tough economic times, it’s more important than ever to keep track of 
expenses, record financial information, and perform other fiscal functions. 
It’s even more important to know some basic accounting procedures, espe­
cially those that relate to an online business.
Without having at least some minimal records of your day-to-day operations, 
you won’t have any way — other than the proverbial “gut feeling” — of know­
ing whether your business is truly successful. Besides that, banks and taxing 
authorities don’t put much stock in gut feelings. When you have to ask for 
a loan or pay taxes, you’ll regret not having records close at hand. Even if 
you sell on eBay, you can’t rely on the auction site to keep all your business 
records for you, and PayPal doesn’t record payments by check or money 
order. And accurate record keeping is essential when revenues dwindle and 
expenses must be reduced.
In this chapter, I introduce you to some simple, straightforward ways to 
handle your online business’s financial information. Read on to discover the 
most important accounting practices and software that can help you tackle 
the essential fiscal tasks you need to undertake to keep your new business 
viable.

398
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
ABCs: Accounting Basics for Commerce
The most important accounting practices for your online business are the 
following:
	
✓	Deciding what type of business you are: Will you be a sole proprietorship, 
partnership, or corporation? (See Chapter 17 for more about determining 
the legal status of your business.)
	
✓	Establishing good record-keeping practices: Record expenses and 
income in ways that can help you at tax time.
	
✓	Obtaining financing when you need it: Although getting started in an 
online business doesn’t cost a lot, you may want to expand someday, 
and good accounting can help you do it.
There’s nothing sexy about accounting (unless, of course, you’re married to 
an accountant; in that case, you have a financial expert at hand and can skip 
this chapter!). Then again, unexpected cash shortages or other problems that 
can result from bad record keeping are no fun, either.
Good accounting is the key to managing your business. How else can you 
know how you’re doing? Yet many new businesspeople are intimidated by 
the numbers game. Use the tool at hand — your computer — to help you 
overcome your fear: Start keeping those books!
Choosing an accounting method
Accepting that you have to keep track of your business’s accounting is only 
half the battle; next, you need to decide how to do it. How and when you 
record your business transactions make a difference not only to your accoun­
tant but also to agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Even 
if you hire someone to keep the books for you, it’s good to know what your 
options are.
	
You don’t have to take my word for all this. Consult the Internal Revenue 
Service Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business (www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/p334.pdf). Review Section 2, Accounting Periods and Methods, 
which explains how to do everything right when tax time comes. Also check 
out the Accounting System section of the CCH Business Owner’s Toolkit site 
(www.toolkit.cch.com/text/P06_1300.asp).
Using cash-basis versus accrual-basis accounting
Don’t be intimidated by these terms: They’re simply two methods of totaling 
income and expenses. Exactly where and how you do the recording is up to 
you. You can take a piece of paper, divide it into two columns labeled Income 

399
 Chapter 18: Online Business Accounting Tools
and Expenses, and do it that way. (I describe some higher-tech tools later in 
this chapter.) Here are two standard ways of reporting income and expenses:
	
✓	Cash-basis accounting: You report income when you actually receive 
it and write off expenses when you pay them. This is the easy way to 
report income and expenses, and probably the way most new small 
businesses do it.
	
✓	Accrual-basis accounting: This method is more complicated than the 
cash-basis method, but if your online business maintains an inventory, 
you must use the accrual method. You report income when you actually 
receive the payment; you write down expenses when services are ren­
dered (even though you may not have made the cash payment yet). For 
example, if a payment is due on December 1, but you send the check on 
December 8, you record the bill as being paid on December 1, when the 
payment was originally due.
Accrual-basis accounting creates a more accurate picture of a business’s 
financial situation. If a business has cash-flow problems and is extending pay­
ments on some of its bills, cash-basis accounting provides an unduly rosy 
financial picture, whereas the accrual-basis method is more accurate.
Choosing an accounting period
The other choice you need to make when deciding how to keep your books is 
the accounting period you intend to use. Here again, you have two choices:
	
✓	Calendar year: The calendar year ends December 31. This is the period 
you’re probably most familiar with and the one most small or home-
based businesses choose because it’s the easiest to work with.
	
✓	Fiscal year: In this case, the business picks a date other than December 
31 to function as the end of its fiscal year. Many large organizations pick 
a date that coincides with the end of their business cycle. Some pick 
March 31 as the end, others June 30, and still others September 30.
	
If you use the fiscal-year method of accounting, you must file your tax return 
three and a half months after the end of the fiscal year. If the fiscal year ends 
on June 30, for example, you must file by October 15.
Knowing what records to keep
When you run your own business, it pays to be meticulous about recording 
everything that pertains to your commercial activities. The more you under­
stand what you have to record, the more accurate your records will be — 
and the more deductions you can take, too. Go to an office supply store and 
get a bookkeeping record book that’s set up with columns for income and 
expenses.

400
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
	
I know what you’re thinking: printed record books? Who uses those anymore? 
As an alternative, search your app store. Apple’s JustAddMoney Expense 
Tracker helps you set up accounts and record expenses. For Android users, 
Easy Money - Expense Manager is available in Google Play.
Tracking income
You need to keep track of your company’s income (or, as it’s sometimes called, 
your gross receipts) carefully. Not all the income your business receives is tax­
able. What you receive as a result of sales (your revenue) is taxable, but loans 
that you receive aren’t. Be sure to separate the two and pay tax only on the 
sales income. But keep good records: If you can’t accurately report the source 
of income that you didn’t pay taxes on, the IRS labels it unreported income, and 
you have to pay taxes and possibly fines and penalties on it.
Just how should you record your revenue? For each item you sell, write down 
a brief, informal statement on a slip of paper or even on the back of a can­
celed check. Be sure to include the following information:
	
✓	Amount received
	
✓	Type of payment (credit card, electronic cash, or check)
	
✓	Date of the transaction
	
✓	Name and description of the item purchased, including model number 
or other applicable information
	
✓	Name of client or customer
	
✓	Goods or services you provided in exchange for the payment
	
Collect all your check stubs and revenue statements in a folder labeled Income 
so that you can find them easily at tax time.
Assessing your assets
Assets are resources that your business owns, such as your office and computer 
equipment. Equity is your remaining assets after you pay your creditors.
Any equipment you have that contributes to your business activities con­
stitutes your assets. Equipment that has a life span of more than a year is 
expected to help you generate income over its useful life; therefore, you must 
spread out (or expense) the original cost of the equipment over its life span. 
Expensing the cost of an asset over the period of its useful life is depreciation. 
To depreciate an item, estimate how many years you’re going to use it and 
then divide the original cost by the number of years. The result is the amount 
that you report in any given year. For example, if you purchase a computer 
that costs $3,000 and you expect to use it in your business for five years, you 
expense $600 of the cost each year.

401
 Chapter 18: Online Business Accounting Tools
Keep records of your assets that include the following information:
	
✓	Name, model number, and description
	
✓	Purchase date
	
✓	Purchase price, including fees
	
✓	Date the item went into service
	
✓	Amount of time the item is put to personal (as opposed to business) use
File these records in a safe location along with your other tax-related 
information.
Recording payments
Even a lone entrepreneur doesn’t work in a vacuum. An online business 
owner needs to pay a web host, an ISP, and possibly web page designers as 
well as other consultants. If you take on partners or employees, things get 
more complicated. But in general, you need to record all payments such as 
these in detail as well.
Your accountant is likely to ask how you pay the people who work for you. You 
have two options: You can treat them either as full- or part-time employees or 
as independent contractors. The IRS uses a stringent series of guidelines to 
determine who is a contractor and who is a full-time employee. Refer to IRS 
Publication 15A (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf), which discusses 
the employee/independent contractor subject in detail.
	
Hiring independent contractors rather than salaried workers is far simpler for 
you: You don’t have to pay benefits to independent contractors, and you don’t 
have to withhold federal and state taxes. Just be sure to get invoices from any 
independent contractor who works for you. If you have full-time employees 
whom you pay an hourly wage, consult an accountant to help you set up the 
salary payments.
Listing expenses
When you break down business expenses on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from 
Business) of your federal tax return, you need to keep track of two kinds of 
expenses:
	
✓	The first type of expenses (simply dubbed Expenses in Part II of 
Schedule C) includes travel, business meals, advertisements, postage, 
and other costs that you incur in order to produce revenue.
	
✓	The second kind of expenses (grouped under Other Expenses in Part V 
of Schedule C) includes instances when you’re just exchanging one asset 
(cash) for another (a printer or modem, for example).

402
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
The difference between Expenses and Other Expenses lies in how close the 
relationship is between the expense and revenue produced. In the case of 
Part II Expenses, your expenditure is directly related; you wouldn’t take out 
an advertisement or take a business trip if you didn’t expect it to produce 
revenue. In the second case, the act of spending money doesn’t directly 
result in more revenue for you. You would purchase a modem, for example, 
to help you communicate and get information online, not just to boost your 
bottom line. You do hope, though, that the equipment being purchased does 
eventually help you produce revenue.
Get a big folder and use it to hold any receipts, contracts, canceled checks, 
credit card statements, or invoices that represent expenses. It’s also a great 
idea to maintain a record of expenses that includes the following information:
	
✓	Date the expense occurred
	
✓	Name of the person or company that received payment from you
	
✓	Type of expense incurred (equipment, utilities, supplies, and so on)
	
It’s often difficult to recall what some receipts were for a year or even a month 
after the fact. Be sure to jot down a quick note on all canceled checks and 
copies of receipts to remind you what the expense involved.
Understanding the Ps and Qs of P&Ls
You’re likely to hear the term profit and loss statement (also called a P&L) 
thrown around when discussing your online business with financial people. A 
P&L is a report that measures the operation of a business over a given period 
of time, such as a week, a month, or a year. The person who prepares the P&L 
(either you or your accountant) adds up your business revenues and subtracts 
the operating expenses. What’s left are either the profits or the losses.
Most of the accounting programs I discuss in the following sections include 
some way of presenting profit and loss statements and enable you to custom­
ize the statements to fit your needs.
Accounting Software for Your Business
After rummaging through piles of receipts and records stuffed into a big 
manila envelope, my tax preparer gently but firmly urged me to start using 
some accounting software so that the records could be retrieved more easily 
next time. Ever since, I’ve been happy that I took his advice. I urge you to do 
the same. These days, you have lots of options for software that can help you 
record and organize your financial information. The programs break into four 
general categories:

403
 Chapter 18: Online Business Accounting Tools
	
✓	Simple, small-scale programs such as Owl Simple Business Accounting
	
✓	Bigger, full-featured programs such as Quicken, QuickBooks, and MYOB
	
✓	Online versions of the bigger, full-featured programs
	
✓	Apps that perform basic accounting tasks on mobile devices
The online versions are ones that you use on the web; you don’t have to 
install any software on your computer. On the other hand, you do have to 
store your financial information on another website (not yours) when you 
use an online program. But all these options have one thing in common: They 
give you a user-friendly way to store your information and perform calcula­
tions on it. I present some examples in the rest of this section.
Easy-to-use, full-featured software: 
OWL Simple Business Accounting
The well-known, commercial accounting packages, such as Quicken, QuickBooks, 
and MYOB, let you prepare statements and reports and even tie into a tax 
preparation system. Stick with these programs if you like setting up systems, 
such as databases, on your computer. Otherwise, go for a simpler method 
and hire an accountant to help you.
Whatever program you choose, make sure you can keep accurate books and 
set up privacy as well as backup schemes that prevent your kids from access­
ing and possibly even deleting your business records.
If your business is a relatively simple sole proprietorship, you can record 
expenses and income by hand and add them up at tax time. Then carry them 
through to Schedule C or IRS Form 1040. Alternatively, you can record your 
entries and turn them over to a tax advisor who prepares a profit and loss 
statement and tells you the balance due on your tax payment.
If you’re looking to save a few dollars and want an extra-simple accounting 
program that you can set up right now, a good option is Owl Simple Business 
Accounting 4 (www.owlsoftware.com/sba.htm), available for Windows 95 
through Windows 8. Mac users can try FinanceToGo by Bert Torfs (www.

select a reporting period within the current calendar year.
Accounting from anywhere: 
There’s an app for that
For recording expenses while on a business trip or when visiting a supplier 
or store, you’ll likely need a mobile solution. In those cases, seek out and 
download a mobile app for your smartphone or tablet. You can use a mobile 
app with these devices to record data while you’re on the road and then view 
and analyze the full financial picture when you connect to a website with 
your desktop or laptop computer.
You can download an iPad/iPhone version of the QuickBooks program 
(described in the preceding section) from the App Store. The Finance41 
mobile app syncs your data with the website application Finance41.com 
(https://finance41.com). Because I’m an Android user, I tried a free 
app called T2 Expense - Money Manager. The interface is exceptionally clear. 
After you type your name and your currency into the welcome screen, the 
screen shown in Figure 18-6 appears. Choose Income or Expense from the top 
drop-down menu, describe the expense, add a dollar amount and other infor­
mation, and then click Save.

The Taxman Cometh: Concerns 
for Small Business
After you make it through the startup phase of your business, it’s time to 
be concerned with taxes. Here, too, a little preparation can save you lots of 
headaches down the road. But as a hard-working entrepreneur, your biggest 
obstacle is time.
In an American Express survey, 26 percent reported that they wait until the 
last minute to start preparing their taxes, and 13.9 percent said that they usu­
ally ask for an extension. Yet advance planning is truly important for taxes. 
In fact, Internal Revenue Code Section 6001 mandates that businesses must 
keep records appropriate to their trade or business. The IRS has the right to 
view these records if it wants to audit your business’s (or your personal) tax 
return. If your records don’t satisfy the IRS, the penalties can be serious.
Should you charge sales tax?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions I receive from readers: 
Should I charge sales tax for what I sell online? The short answer is, it 

410
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
depends on whether your state collects sales tax at all. No single regulation 
applies to all states equally.
If your state doesn’t collect sales tax (at this writing, five states — Montana, 
Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon — do not), you don’t need to, 
either. However, if your state requires it, yes, you need to collect sales tax 
from customers who live in the same state where your company has a “physi­
cal presence.” In recent years, the pattern has been that a state’s tax laws 
apply only within its own borders. If you’re located in Ohio, for example, your 
business is subject to Ohio sales tax regulations, but only for transactions 
that are completed in Ohio.
	
The nature of what constitutes a “physical presence” varies. Some states 
define it as an office or warehouse. If you take orders only by phone or online, 
you don’t have to collect sales tax. But again, check the regulations for your 
state. Also, most states require that their merchants charge sales tax on ship­
ping and handling charges as well as the purchase price.
But things are changing. For example, if you are located outside of California 
and you sell to someone in that state, yes, you do need to collect sales tax from 
that California resident. In June 2011 a state law went into effect that required 
out-of state businesses to collect sales tax from California residents who make 
online purchases from them. Here are some other recent developments:
	
✓	In Washington, online businesses have to collect sales tax, and consumers 
need to pay sales tax on out-of-state purchases.
	
✓	New York requires its residents to calculate how much they should pay 
in sales tax on Internet purchases.
Because tax laws change frequently, check with your state’s department of 
revenue to make sure.
	
NOLO.com maintains a page that keeps up with the latest Internet sales tax 
changes across the country. You can look up each state’s laws by starting at 
www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/50-state-guide-internet-
sales-tax-laws.html. President George W. Bush signed the Internet Tax 
Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 into law on October 31, 2007. It extends 
the prohibitions against new taxes on Internet access and e-commerce until 
November 1, 2014. But as of this writing, several states have proposed state 
tax on Internet sales, so keep an eye on the news for further developments.
	
The Internet Tax Freedom Act does not mean that Internet sales are free from 
sales tax. It means only that states can’t impose any new sales tax requirements 
on Internet merchants over and above what other merchants already have to 
collect in sales tax. To deal with this supposed loophole, most states charge a 
“use” tax in addition to a sales tax: If a resident of the state makes a purchase 
from another state, the transaction is still subject to use tax. But one state 
can’t compel a merchant in another state to collect its use tax;  only merchants 
located within the state’s own borders must do so.

 Chapter 18: Online Business Accounting Tools
Sales tax varies from state to state, city to city, and county to county. Some 
states tax only sales of tangible personal property; others tax services as 
well. Not only that, but some counties and municipalities levy local taxes on 
sales. In my state, Illinois, I have to report my sales tax income from my eBay 
sales and pay it on a monthly basis, even if it amounts to only a few dollars a 
month. Make sure that any buyers in your state are charged the correct sales 
tax and that you keep records of how much you charged. Check with your 
local comptroller or department of revenue to find out what your require­
ments are.
Federal and state taxes
Although operating a business does complicate your tax return, it’s some­
thing you can handle if your business is a simple one-person operation, if 
you’re willing to spend the time and keep the proper business records.
If you have a sole proprietorship, you need to file IRS form Schedule C along 
with your regular form 1040 tax return. If your sole proprietorship has net 
income, you’re also required to file Schedule SE to determine any Social 
Security and FICA taxes that are due.
State taxes vary depending on where you live. You most likely need to 
file sales tax and income tax. If you have employees, you also need to pay 
employee withholding tax. Contact a local accountant to find out what you 
have to file, or contact the state tax department yourself. Most state tax 
offices provide guidebooks to help you understand state tax requirements.
	
When you start making money for yourself independently, rather than 
depending on a regular paycheck from an employer, you have to start doing 
something you’ve probably never done before: estimating the tax you’ll have 
to pay based on the income from your business. You’re then required to pay 
this tax on a quarterly basis, both to the IRS and to your state taxing agency. 
Estimating and paying quarterly taxes is an important part of meeting your tax 
obligations as a self-employed person.
	
A page full of links to state tax agencies is available at www.tannedfeet.
com/state_tax_agencies.htm.
Deducing your business deductions
One of the benefits of starting a new business, even if the business isn’t 
profitable in the beginning, is the opportunity to take business deductions 
and reduce your tax payments. Always keep receipts from any purchases or 
expenses associated with your business activities. Make sure you’re taking all 
the deductions you’re eligible for. I mention some of these deductions in the 
following sections.

412
Part V: Keeping Your Business Legal and Fiscally Responsible 
Your home office
If you work at home (and I’m assuming that as an entrepreneur, you probably 
do), set aside some space for a home office. This isn’t just a territorial thing. 
It can result in some nifty business deductions, too.
Taking a home office deduction used to be difficult because a 1993 Supreme 
Court decision stated that unless you met with clients, customers, or patients 
on a regular basis in your home office, you couldn’t claim the home-office 
deduction. However, the 1997 tax law eliminates the client requirement and 
requires only that the office be used “regularly and exclusively” for business.
	
What you deduct depends on the amount of space in your home that’s used 
for your business. If your office consumes 96 square feet of a house with 960 
square feet of living/working space, you can deduct 10 percent of your utili­
ties, for example. However, if you have a separate phone line or cell phone 
that’s solely for business use, you can deduct 100 percent of that expense.
Your computer equipment
Computer equipment is probably the biggest expense related to your online 
business. But taking tax deductions can help offset the cost substantially. 
The key is showing the IRS (by reporting your income from your online 
business on your tax return) that you used your PC and related items, such 
as modems or printers, for business purposes. You track what you spend 
on computer equipment in the Other Expenses section, which is Part V of 
Schedule C in your federal tax return.
	
In case you’re ever audited, be sure to keep some sort of record detailing all 
the ways you use your computer equipment for business purposes.
Other common business deductions
Many of the business-related expenses you can deduct are listed on IRS form 
Schedule C. The following is a brief list of some of the deductions you can 
look for:
	
✓	Advertising fees
	
✓	Internet access charges
	
✓	Computer supplies
	
✓	Shipping and delivery
	
✓	Office supplies

Ten Ways to Reach 
Mobile Shoppers
A

s I write this, I just covered eBay’s annual Analyst Day meeting. Its CEO 
spent a good portion of his opening remarks discussing not auctions, 
not eBay stores, but the rise of mobile commerce. If eBay realizes that a key to 
increasing its business in the coming years is the number of individuals around 
the world who use tablets and smartphones to go online, you should, too.
In this Part of Tens chapter, you get ten suggestions for making your online 
store just as effective with mobile shoppers as with those who are sitting at 
a desktop. Think about some of these things when choosing a host or design­
ing a store; you can implement other suggestions any time to expand your 
customer base.
Make Your Online Store Mobile-Friendly
You’ve probably seen websites that look exactly the same as their big-screen 
counterparts. Chances are they appear slowly and are difficult to read. You’ve 
probably also seen sites that look totally different on a mobile device than 
they do on a desktop computer. Those are simplified, with rows of easy-to-
find and easy-to-click links, few graphics, and a rudimentary layout. These 
appear quickly and it’s easy to tap what you need.
The question is, how do you get one of those sites or storefronts that is 
tailored to appear easily and simply on the small screen? You can hire a 
programmer (an option also mentioned in the “Create an App” section, later 
in this chapter) or you can choose a shopping cart program or e-commerce 
host that does the conversion for you automatically.
A growing number of e-commerce hosts create a mobile-friendly version for 
you for no extra cost. They include Jimdo (www.jimdo.com), Magento (www.
magento.com), Shopify (www.shopify.com), and Pinnacle Cart (www.
pinnaclecart.com), to name a few. If it’s important to you to have a mobile 
site as well as a conventional one, make sure the e-commerce host you 
choose does this for you as part of your hosting package.

416
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
A service called Mobify (www.mobify.com) converts your website to a 
format that can easily be viewed and navigated on a mobile device. You can 
also use an online utility called Onbile (www.grovo.com/onbile) to create 
your own mobile site.
Keep Your Presentation Ultra-Simple
Your conventional website or storefront might have a Flash animation as an 
introduction; it might feature video clips and content arranged in multiple 
columns. That’s all well and good, but you need to keep all these flashy ele­
ments off your mobile site.
Shoppers just want to find what they’re looking for quickly and be able to pay 
for it with a few mouse clicks. If they have to wait too long for a page to load 
because it’s too complicated, they’ll simply give up and go elsewhere. With 
that harsh fact in mind, it’s wise to adhere to the following rules of mobile 
simplicity:
	
✓	Invite shoppers to explore. Less is more when it comes to shopping. 
Your initial screen should include just the most important links to your 
catalog or website. This allows visitors to decide quickly where to click.
	
✓	Make purchases simple. In Chapter 6 you learn about organizing a web­
site to keep shopping simple. On a mobile site, it’s essential to be able 
to add an item to a shopping cart and then make a purchase with a 
minimum of mouse clicks.
Smartphones and mobile devices are all about convenience, so your mobile 
commerce site should echo what mobile users already want and expect from 
an online shopping experience.
Enable Mobile Device Payments
If, like many online businesspeople, you also operate a brick-and-mortar 
store or sell at flea markets or art fairs, it pays to sign up with a mobile pay­
ment service so people can pay you wherever you are. The best-known such 
service is called Square Payments (www.square.com).
Other companies have created payment systems that work with mobile devices. 
Check out PayPal Here (www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-
reader) and Intuit GoPayment (http://payments.intuit.com/mobile_
credit_card_processing). All these services work by means of a device 
called a dongle that plugs into a smartphone and enables it to connect to a 
payment network.

417
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Reach Mobile Shoppers
Create an App
The ultimate way to give your store a functional presence on a smartphone 
or tablet is to create an app for it. An app performs lots of essential business 
functions:
	
✓	It’s embedded into the device. Once a user downloads and installs an 
app, it’s there in the device. It is assigned a shortcut, and the user can 
place that shortcut right on his or her home screen for the ultimate in 
convenience.
	
✓	It promotes your products. If you have Groupon’s popular app, you know 
that the daily deal site uses the app as a promotional tool; you see today’s 
special deals the moment you open it up.
	
✓	It makes your site easy to use. The app can be configured to store user 
information so it doesn’t have to be entered at checkout; a purchase 
might take just one or two clicks.
If creating an app is beyond the reach of your small business, you can hire a 
programmer to create an app just for you, with the features you want. That, 
at least, is the ultimate goal. But hiring such a programmer might be beyond 
the reach of those businesses on a shoestring budget. Still, you might con­
sider a simple app; it makes your business look legitimate and cutting-edge, 
and gives you added credibility.
	
Sites like Intellectsoft (www.intellectsoft.co.uk/iphone_applications_
development.html) give you an estimate on how much your own app 
might cost.
Offer a Coupon Deal They Can’t Refuse
Coupons are highly effective promotional tools that attract devoted (and on 
occasion, deal-obsessed) shoppers. The latest trend is to have coupons deliv­
ered to consumers’ smartphones; they don’t necessarily have to appear in 
print at all.
With a little effort, you can create coupons that you post on your website or 
in your store so that customers can download them to their phones. The free 
service Keypons (www.keypons.net) makes it easy for you to assign a name 
to your offer, enter the specifics in a form (whether the coupon is for 10 
percent off, for example) and enter instructions on how the shopper should 
redeem it (“Text ‘save cleaning’ to 42424,” for example). One advantage of 
using a coupon creation service is that you can track the effectiveness of 
the promotion. You get reports on how many people saw your coupon, how 
many used it, how many passed it on to their friends, and so on.

418
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Consider a Mobile-Only 
Shopping Cart Provider
Some shopping cart/e-commerce hosting services give their customers a 
mobile version of their online storefronts. That version is probably good 
enough for most small business owners. But if most of your customers use 
mobile devices, or if you are just starting out and want to focus exclusively 
on mobile commerce, create your store especially for the “small screen” with 
a mobile shopping cart.
Service providers like 2ergo (www.2ergo.com) and asknet (www.asknet.
com) work from the ground up with mobile sites, so they are familiar with 
what platforms to work with, what size constraints they have to meet, and so 
on, as well as features like mobile coupons, which are described in the pre­
ceding section.
Go Beyond “Mobile” to Include “Social”
Social marketing is a natural activity on mobile devices. Your e-commerce 
presentation can feed into this by making it easy for mobile shoppers to con­
nect with their friends and online acquaintances and spread the word about 
your products and services. Here are some suggestions:
	
✓	Take advantage of mobile reviews. Give your visitors a chance to post 
reviews of your store or your products; mobile web surfers love reviews 
and seek them out.
	
✓	Help shoppers “pin” your products. Provide a button that enables 
visitors to quickly “pin” items they like to the social marketing site 
Pinterest.
	
✓	Help reviews share their views. Provide one-touch buttons so those 
who leave reviews for you can share those reviews with their friends on 
Facebook and Twitter.
Your mobile site should be a place that encourages shoppers to return; 
enabling interaction with the site gets them involved and gives them a reason 
to check back on a regular basis.

419
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Reach Mobile Shoppers
Keep Your Mobile Site Cross-Platform
It’s always important to make sure your web content appears the way you 
want no matter what computer platform or browser your visitor uses. It’s 
even more important when the content appears on a tablet or smartphone.
Be sure to test your site to make sure the appearance is accurate on the 
most popular (iPhone, Android) platforms and on browsers such as Chrome, 
Safari, and Android’s built-in browser.
Focus on Shoppers Who 
Are Likely Buyers
A study by Apsalar (apsalar.com/blog/2012/09/apsalar-more-
mobile-apps-lead-to-engagement-deficit-disorder) indicates that 
mobile shoppers are not necessarily engaged buyers. The sheer number of 
apps they have installed and the number of things demanding their attention 
on their smartphones mean they tend not to follow through with transactions 
on their mobile devices.
But there’s good news. You already have a set of engaged customers — 
shoppers who have already purchased from you, who “Like” you on Facebook, 
who have chosen to subscribe to your newsletter if you have one. These are 
customers you can drive to your mobile site. Offer them special promotions 
and rewards, and encourage them to tell their friends on Facebook and Twitter.
Contact Customers in Your 
Area with a Geofence
This advanced tip combines the location-based marketing described in 
Chapter 12 with mobile devices. A geofence is a location that you specify 
using a service such as Thumbvista (www.thumbvista.com). Logically, this 
would be the location of your brick-and-mortar store if you have one. It could 
also be an art fair or another event in which you are participating.
When someone nears or passes by the geofence, the service sends a text 
message to the mobile devices of individuals who have already opted in to 
receive such messages. The text message might say “50 percent off pottery 
today only!” For customers who have already made purchases from you and 
who have opted in as part of one of your e-mail campaigns, this can be a wel­
come alert that might well result in a purchase.

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Develop a Platform
N

ot so long ago, starting an online business primarily meant creating 
a website or selling on a marketplace such as eBay. The landscape 
has shifted as I write the seventh edition of this book. Yes, websites are still 
important. But the notion of what constitutes a “website” has expanded to 
include a blog, a storefront on eBay, or a site hosted by any of a number of 
intriguing niche marketplaces.
The ultimate result of this combination of online sales and marketing efforts 
is a platform. The term should be familiar to anyone involved in publishing. In 
the world of book writing and marketing, an author platform is all-important. 
This is a base of readers who are already familiar with and like your work 
or your services and to whom you can market future books. An author who 
gives seminars and who has thousands of followers on Facebook and Twitter 
has a platform of devoted fans eager to hear about new books or seminars.
The same principle can apply to e-commerce. Your ultimate goal is to 
develop a seller platform. You want to have repeat customers, subscribers 
to your newsletter, readers of your blog, and followers on social media. You 
become the “go-to” person when it comes to widgets, or what’s-its, or what­
ever you sell or create. It’s a matter of branding yourself, and it’s something 
that’s easier than ever to do online. You find ten options for developing a 
brand and a platform in this chapter.
Following Wilco’s Example
It’s always helpful to find an example to follow when it comes to sales or 
marketing. You might know a seller in your field who seems to do everything 
right and who has developed a recognizable brand. If you need a suggestion, 
consider the well-known rock band Wilco, based in my own hometown of 
Chicago.
Wilco (www.wilcoworld.net) made headlines in 2002 when its record pub­
lisher rejected its album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The record company gave the 
band all the rights to the album; they started streaming it online to their fans. 
It turned out to be the band’s most successful album to date, selling 670,000 
copies. In addition to having an online store, Wilco has more than 500,000 

422
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
“Likes” on Facebook and 92,000 followers on Twitter. Followers on Facebook 
can listen to concerts online; they let people listen to their music online 
before they sell it on CD in their online store. It’s all about driving fans to 
their various locations online and building a community to sustain long-term 
sales. The community page on their website (http://wilcoworld.net/
community) points visitors to many online forums where they can connect 
with like-minded fans.
Creating a Logo
A logo is like a storefront sign. It gives people, in one glance, a visual repre­
sentation of what your business is and what you sell. Is it really necessary 
to have a logo? No. Does it hurt your business if you don’t have one? I would 
argue yes. The web became popular in the 1990s because it was visual; sud­
denly you could see images and colors, not just text links. A logo can go a 
long way toward making a business seem “for real” in the minds of your 
customers, and your own mind, too.
A good logo is professional-looking. It represents who you are, what service 
you provide, or what you sell. But it can be simple, almost homemade-looking, 
like the logo for the Enchanted Hen website (www.enchantedhen.com).
Even if you have no artistic ability, you can still make a logo yourself that 
consists of only type. There are some really good precedents for this. The 
logo shown in Figure 20-1 is an example; so are Google’s and eBay’s logos.
	
Although simpler is better when it comes to logos, if you are creating a busi­
ness or a brand that you want to promote for years to come, it’s really worth 
your effort to spend some money on a professional designer. You can find one 
on the online employment site Elance (www.elance.com).
See Chapter 5 for more on creating a logo and how it can help your business.
Listing on EveryPlaceISell
A business with multiple storefronts and points of entry benefits by having 
a single location where all those venues are brought together under a single 
virtual “roof.” A website called EveryPlaceISell (www.everyplaceisell.
com) provides such a home base for free.
A typical EveryPlaceISell listing not only lists the various storefronts oper­
ated by a single individual or company, but also includes background infor­
mation about the owner, something that customers might not be able to find 
elsewhere. There’s no reason not to list on this site; you gain another place 
to reach customers and another page to link to (which should improve SEO).

423
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Develop a Platform
	
You can put a link to your EveryPlaceISell page everywhere you appear online, 
including Facebook and Twitter. It might be especially effective to include this 
link as part of your e-mail signature file as well.
Being a Social Marketing Maven
Social marketing can serve many purposes that go beyond keeping up with 
friends and family and sharing news stories that you find interesting. It can 
meet some of your business goals as well. Keeping up with your customers 
and sharing stories about your company or your field of business is the same 
kind of activity but with a different emphasis.
E-commerce, like more traditional kinds of business, is built on concepts like 
trust, brands, and reputation. The better you can brand yourself and prove 
that you are either an authority in your field or someone who has desirable 
merchandise, the more successful you’ll be. Social networking is simply the 
practice of connecting with people online to build loyalty, establish a one-to-
one relationship with your customers, build a sense of community, and let 
people know about your products and business.
	
You can go beyond sharing to offer freebies, conduct contests, and even post 
items for sale through a social networking site or, at the very least, advertise 
them online. See Chapter 13 for more.
Developing an E-Mail Campaign
I’m involved in an e-mail marketing campaign as I write this chapter. My non­
profit spiritual community is promoting a visit by our teacher, who is coming 
to our center in Chicago. We’re conducting a planned series of mailings using 
the e-mail service Constant Contact (www.constantcontact.com).
That’s the first thing you should consider when you think about progressing 
from occasional e-mail sender to organized e-mail campaign conductor: Pay a 
modest monthly fee for an e-mail service provider (ESP). An ESP doesn’t just 
help you keep track of mailing lists. It streamlines the process whereby individ­
uals can subscribe or unsubscribe from those lists, which is required by law.
ESPs also help you with designing and revising e-mails so you don’t have to 
create them from scratch each time. You can save an e-mail as a draft before 
it goes out; you can resend e-mails with a single click; you can copy e-mails 
and revise them with new content as needed. But among the best features 
is the report function: You can keep track of how many people opened your 
e-mail and how many clicked links in the message, for example.

424
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Posting on Your Blog
Over the years, I’ve seen one business principle play out over and over again: 
The more generous you are with your knowledge, the more business you’ll 
get. For many people, a blog provides a way to share your knowledge, experi­
ence, and interests, as well as news about your products or services.
A business blog has a special purpose. It shares news and the views of a busi­
nessperson who’s knowledgeable about a particular area of commerce and 
who wants to connect with people who are interested in the same subject. 
Setting up a blog isn’t difficult thanks to tools like WordPress; putting sub­
stantive posts on it regularly is the challenge.
A blog is another way of building your platform. By inviting comments from 
readers and responding to them, you give your customers another reason 
to visit you. And people who are impressed with your knowledge may well 
check out your store.
	
One of the biggest benefits of having a blog and updating it regularly is that 
you improve your search engine placement. Google, for example, likes pages 
that are updated frequently; it ranks those pages higher in search results, as I 
discuss in Chapter 11. To find out more about blogs, see Chapter 13.
Giving Something Back 
to Your Supporters
There’s a business I’m familiar with, a small Chicago company that sells 
organic and heirloom food products, called The Scrumptious Pantry (www.
scrumptiouspantry.com). When they were just getting started, the owners 
went on the revolutionary fundraising site Kickstarter, where anyone can 
raise money from sympathetic individuals for a personal project or a cause, 
trying to raise $12,000, and they reached their goal and then some.
Look up this business on Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com/projects/
61608863/tasty-packaged-food-from-small-sustainable-farms), 
and in the right column you see all the things The Scrumptious Pantry is 
doing to keep up with its donors and give something back, including provid­
ing donors with a recipe a day for a year. This, of course, is a great way to 
market and expand one’s customer base and build a brand.
On their website, the owners invite visitors to join an heirloom club, and 
they provide recipes as well. They’re putting it all together with a newsletter, 
an online store, a blog, Facebook and Twitter links, and all the tools to help 
them assemble a platform of dedicated supporters and customers.

425
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Develop a Platform
Popping Up on Other People’s Websites
One of the most effective ways to build a name for yourself (and, by extension, 
a platform) is to spread your name around the web as widely as possible. 
Luckily, the proliferation of blogs and discussion areas means it’s easy to do so.
Look for sites that sell items that complement the things you sell. Ask if you 
can trade advertisements or links: I’ll place a link (or ad) to your site on mine, 
if you do the same for my site. Because the other site isn’t a direct competitor, 
the owner should be receptive.
Look for blogs that discuss topics or areas of business that relate to what you 
do, or that focus on your own area of expertise. Ask if you can write a guest 
blog post. If the response is yes, write a useful post that (ideally) provokes 
discussion.
Be available to people like me, who write about online business. If someone 
asks you for an interview, jump at the chance. Having your name and the URL 
of your website in an article on a well-traveled venue is like business gold. It 
can be available in Google search results for months, even years; a half-hour 
of answering questions can lead customers to your site for a far longer period 
of time.
Publishing Your Own Newsletter
Your main goal as an online businessperson should be to make sales. But 
at the same time, you need to gather names and e-mail addresses, and one 
of the best ways to do this is by creating a newsletter. A newsletter doesn’t 
have to contain a series of detailed stories and photos. It can be a set of 
announcements, too. Here are some ideas of what a newsletter might contain:
	
✓	Announcements of special sales and promotions: “Check out our spring 
cleaning sale this weekend,” for instance, or “Half Off All Fishing Tackle 
This Saturday!”
	
✓	New products: When you introduce new merchandise, feature it with 
photos, a short article, and suggestions of how the reader might use it 
or benefit from it.
	
✓	Instructions on how to use your products: If you sell shelving or organi­
zational products, for example, create a special report showing how to 
use your products to organize a home or garage.
	
✓	Keepsakes: Offer a recipe book, for example.
	
✓	A bonus: If someone subscribes, offer a 33 percent discount on his or 
her next purchase, for example.

426
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Once you sell to someone, put his or her name on a mailing list. It’s easy to 
do so. Record the information in a word processing or spreadsheet file. The 
spreadsheet option is especially good because the contents can be easily 
exported to a mailing list service. 
Send that person a newsletter or e-mail that tells about your new products or 
that simply describes what you’re up to.
	
Before you start gathering your customers’ contact information, check with 
your marketplace to make sure you know their policy on e-mail marketing. 
Some venues (notably, Amazon.com) prohibit the use of customer e-mail 
addresses for marketing.
Keeping Your Content 
Fresh and Up to Date
Do you have a favorite blog, comic strip, or newspaper columnist website 
that you like to visit each day? I certainly do. With luck, your customers will 
want to visit your site, eBay Store, or other sales venue every day as well. Of 
course, that won’t be the case unless you come up with new material on a 
regular basis.
I know what you’re thinking: You have so many things to do that you can’t 
possibly revisit your website every day and change headings or put new sales 
online. You have to get the kids off to school, pack up some merchandise, run 
to the post office, clean up the house — the list goes on and on. You can’t be 
in two places at the same time. Two people can be, though. Consider hiring a 
student or friend to help run your site and suggest new content for you.

About the Author
Greg Holden started the small business Stylus Media, which is a group of 
editorial, design, and computer professionals who produce both print and 
electronic publications. Greg has been a freelance writer since 1996, and is 
also a novelist. A former PowerSeller on eBay, he is now embarking on a new 
hobby — beekeeping. (Visit Greg’s blog, www.gregholden.com, for more 
about his activities and for links to his fiction.)
The first edition of Starting an Online Business For Dummies was the ninth of 
Greg’s more than 45 computer books, and he authored eBay PowerUser’s Bible 
for Wiley Publishing. Over the years, he has been a regular contributor to CNET 
(www.cnet.com) and to EcommerceBytes (www.ecommercebytes.com). 
Greg balances his technical expertise and his entrepreneurial experience with 
his love of literature. He received a Master of Arts degree in English from the 
University of Illinois at Chicago, and he writes general-interest books, short 
stories, and poetry.
Greg translated his experiences raising two daughters into the book Karma 
Kids: Answering Everyday Parenting Questions with Buddhist Wisdom. He lives 
with his wife and their Corgi in a Victorian rowhouse in Chicago. He is a 
longtime member of Jewel Heart, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation and study 
group based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Dedication
To my father, who taught me all about being innovative, working 
independently, and working hard.

Chlo; Mike Holden of lp2cdsolutions; Nanette Thorell of Enchanted Hen

I would also like to acknowledge my wife, Peggy, who has supported 
and encouraged me in all areas of life. And thanks to Ina Steiner at 
EcommerceBytes for allowing me to write interesting articles about online 
businesses of all sorts.
For editing and technical assignments, I was lucky to be in the capable hands 
of the folks at Wiley Publishing: my project editor, Brian Walls; my copy 
editor, Lynn Northrup; and my technical editor, Joel Elad.
Thanks also to Neil Salkind of Studio B, and to Kyle Looper of Wiley 
Publishing, for helping me to add this book to the list of those I’ve authored 
and, in the process, broadening my expertise as a writer.
Last but certainly not least, the future is in the hands of the generation of my 
two daughters, Zosia and Lucy, who allow me to learn from the curiosity and 
joy with which they approach life.
