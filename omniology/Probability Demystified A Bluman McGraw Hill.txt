PREFACE
‘‘The probable is what usually happens.’’ — Aristotle
Probability can be called the mathematics of chance. The theory of probabil-
ity is unusual in the sense that we cannot predict with certainty the individual
outcome of a chance process such as ﬂipping a coin or rolling a die (singular
for dice), but we can assign a number that corresponds to the probability of
getting a particular outcome. For example, the probability of getting a head
when a coin is tossed is 1/2 and the probability of getting a two when a single
fair die is rolled is 1/6.
We can also predict with a certain amount of accuracy that when a coin is
tossed a large number of times, the ratio of the number of heads to the total
number of times the coin is tossed will be close to 1/2.
Probability theory is, of course, used in gambling. Actually, mathemati-
cians began studying probability as a means to answer questions about
gambling games. Besides gambling, probability theory is used in many other
areas such as insurance, investing, weather forecasting, genetics, and medicine,
and in everyday life.
What is this book about?
First let me tell you what this book is not about:
.
This book is not a rigorous theoretical deductive mathematical
approach to the concepts of probability.
.
This book is not a book on how to gamble.
And most important

.
This book is not a book on how to win at gambling!
This book presents the basic concepts of probability in a simple,
straightforward, easy-to-understand way. It does require, however, a
knowledge of arithmetic (fractions, decimals, and percents) and a knowledge
of basic algebra (formulas, exponents, order of operations, etc.). If you need
a review of these concepts, you can consult another of my books in this
series entitled Pre-Algebra Demystiﬁed.
This book can be used to gain a knowledge of the basic concepts of
probability theory, either as a self-study guide or as a supplementary
textbook for those who are taking a course in probability or a course in
statistics that has a section on probability.
The basic concepts of probability are explained in the ﬁrst two chapters.
Then the addition and multiplication rules are explained. Following
that, the concepts of odds and expectation are explained. The counting
rules are explained in Chapter 6, and they are needed for the binomial and
other probability distributions found in Chapters 7 and 8. The relationship
between probability and the normal distribution is presented in Chapter 9.
Finally, a recent development, the Monte Carlo method of simulation, is
explained in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 explains how probability can be used in
game theory and Chapter 12 explains how probability is used in actuarial
science. Special material on Bayes’ Theorem is presented in the Appendix
because this concept is somewhat more diﬃcult than the other concepts
presented in this book.
In addition to addressing the concepts of probability, each chapter ends
with what is called a ‘‘Probability Sidelight.’’ These sections cover some of
the historical aspects of the development of probability theory or some
commentary on how probability theory is used in gambling and everyday life.
I have spent my entire career teaching mathematics at a level that most
students can understand and appreciate. I have written this book with the
same objective in mind. Mathematical precision, in some cases, has been
sacriﬁced in the interest of presenting probability theory in a simpliﬁed way.
Good luck!

CHAPTER
1
Basic Concepts
Introduction
Probability can be deﬁned as the mathematics of chance. Most people are
familiar with some aspects of probability by observing or playing gambling
games such as lotteries, slot machines, black jack, or roulette. However,
probability theory is used in many other areas such as business, insurance,
weather forecasting, and in everyday life.
In this chapter, you will learn about the basic concepts of probability using
various devices such as coins, cards, and dice. These devices are not used as
examples in order to make you an astute gambler, but they are used because
they will help you understand the concepts of probability.

Probability Experiments
Chance processes, such as ﬂipping a coin, rolling a die (singular for dice), or
drawing a card at random from a well-shuﬄed deck are called probability
experiments. A probability experiment is a chance process that leads to well-
deﬁned outcomes or results. For example, tossing a coin can be considered
a probability experiment since there are two well-deﬁned outcomes—heads
and tails.
An outcome of a probability experiment is the result of a single trial of
a probability experiment. A trial means ﬂipping a coin once, or drawing a
single card from a deck. A trial could also mean rolling two dice at once,
tossing three coins at once, or drawing ﬁve cards from a deck at once.
A single trial of a probability experiment means to perform the experiment
one time.
The set of all outcomes of a probability experiment is called a sample
space. Some sample spaces for various probability experiments are shown
here.
Experiment
Sample Space
Toss one coin
H, T*
Roll a die
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Toss two coins
HH, HT, TH, TT
*H = heads; T = tails.
Notice that when two coins are tossed, there are four outcomes, not three.
Consider tossing a nickel and a dime at the same time. Both coins could fall
heads up. Both coins could fall tails up. The nickel could fall heads up and
the dime could fall tails up, or the nickel could fall tails up and the dime
could fall heads up. The situation is the same even if the coins are
indistinguishable.
It should be mentioned that each outcome of a probability experiment
occurs at random. This means you cannot predict with certainty which
outcome will occur when the experiment is conducted. Also, each outcome
of the experiment is equally likely unless otherwise stated. That means that
each outcome has the same probability of occurring.
When ﬁnding probabilities, it is often necessary to consider several
outcomes of the experiment. For example, when a single die is rolled, you
may want to consider obtaining an even number; that is, a two, four, or six.
This is called an event. An event then usually consists of one or more
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
2

outcomes of the sample space. (Note: It is sometimes necessary to consider
an event which has no outcomes. This will be explained later.)
An event with one outcome is called a simple event. For example, a die is
rolled and the event of getting a four is a simple event since there is only one
way to get a four. When an event consists of two or more outcomes, it is
called a compound event. For example, if a die is rolled and the event is getting
an odd number, the event is a compound event since there are three ways to
get an odd number, namely, 1, 3, or 5.
Simple and compound events should not be confused with the number of
times the experiment is repeated. For example, if two coins are tossed, the
event of getting two heads is a simple event since there is only one way to get
two heads, whereas the event of getting a head and a tail in either order is
a compound event since it consists of two outcomes, namely head, tail and
tail, head.
EXAMPLE: A single die is rolled. List the outcomes in each event:
a.
Getting an odd number
b.
Getting a number greater than four
c.
Getting less than one
SOLUTION:
a.
The event contains the outcomes 1, 3, and 5.
b.
The event contains the outcomes 5 and 6.
c.
When you roll a die, you cannot get a number less than one; hence,
the event contains no outcomes.
Classical Probability
Sample spaces are used in classical probability to determine the numerical
probability that an event will occur. The formula for determining the
probability of an event E is
PðEÞ ¼ number of outcomes contained in the event E
total number of outcomes in the sample space
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
3

EXAMPLE: Two coins are tossed; ﬁnd the probability that both coins land
heads up.
SOLUTION:
The sample space for tossing two coins is HH, HT, TH, and TT. Since there
are 4 events in the sample space, and only one way to get two heads (HH),
the answer is
PðHHÞ ¼ 1
4
EXAMPLE: A die is tossed; ﬁnd the probability of each event:
a.
Getting a two
b.
Getting an even number
c.
Getting a number less than 5
SOLUTION:
The sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so there are six outcomes in the sample
space.
a.
P(2) ¼ 1
6, since there is only one way to obtain a 2.
b.
P(even number) ¼ 3
6 ¼ 1
2, since there are three ways to get an odd
number, 1, 3, or 5.
c.
P(number less than 5Þ ¼ 4
6 ¼ 2
3, since there are four numbers in the
sample space less than 5.
EXAMPLE: A dish contains 8 red jellybeans, 5 yellow jellybeans, 3 black
jellybeans, and 4 pink jellybeans. If a jellybean is selected at random, ﬁnd the
probability that it is
a.
A red jellybean
b.
A black or pink jellybean
c.
Not yellow
d.
An orange jellybean
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
4

SOLUTION:
There are 8 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 20 outcomes in the sample space.
a.
PðredÞ ¼ 8
20 ¼ 2
5
b.
Pðblack or pinkÞ ¼ 3 þ 4
20
¼ 7
20
c.
P(not yellow) = P(red or black or pink) ¼ 8 þ 3 þ 4
20
¼ 15
20 ¼ 3
4
d.
P(orange)= 0
20 ¼ 0, since there are no orange jellybeans.
Probabilities can be expressed as reduced fractions, decimals, or percents.
For example, if a coin is tossed, the probability of getting heads up is 1
2 or
0.5 or 50%. (Note: Some mathematicians feel that probabilities should
be expressed only as fractions or decimals. However, probabilities are often
given as percents in everyday life. For example, one often hears, ‘‘There is a
50% chance that it will rain tomorrow.’’)
Probability problems use a certain language. For example, suppose a die
is tossed. An event that is speciﬁed as ‘‘getting at least a 3’’ means getting a
3, 4, 5, or 6. An event that is speciﬁed as ‘‘getting at most a 3’’ means getting
a 1, 2, or 3.
Probability Rules
There are certain rules that apply to classical probability theory. They are
presented next.
Rule 1: The probability of any event will always be a number from zero to one.
This can be denoted mathematically as 0  P(E)  1. What this means is that
all answers to probability problems will be numbers ranging from zero to
one. Probabilities cannot be negative nor can they be greater than one.
Also, when the probability of an event is close to zero, the occurrence of
the event is relatively unlikely. For example, if the chances that you will win a
certain lottery are 0.00l or one in one thousand, you probably won’t win,
unless of course, you are very ‘‘lucky.’’ When the probability of an event is
0.5 or 1
2, there is a 50–50 chance that the event will happen—the same
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
5

probability of the two outcomes when ﬂipping a coin. When the probability
of an event is close to one, the event is almost sure to occur. For example,
if the chance of it snowing tomorrow is 90%, more than likely, you’ll see
some snow. See Figure 1-1.
Rule 2: When an event cannot occur, the probability will be zero.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled; ﬁnd the probability of getting a 7.
SOLUTION:
Since the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and there is no way to get a 7,
P(7) ¼ 0. The event in this case has no outcomes when the sample space is
considered.
Rule 3: When an event is certain to occur, the probability is 1.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled; ﬁnd the probability of getting a number less
than 7.
SOLUTION:
Since all outcomes in the sample space are less than 7, the probability is 6
6 ¼1.
Rule 4: The sum of the probabilities of all of the outcomes in the sample space
is 1.
Referring to the sample space for tossing two coins (HH, HT, TH, TT), each
outcome has a probability of 1
4 and the sum of the probabilities of all of the
outcomes is
1
4 þ 1
4 þ 1
4 þ 1
4 ¼ 4
4 ¼ 1:
Fig. 1-1.
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
6

Rule 5: The probability that an event will not occur is equal to 1 minus the
probability that the event will occur.
For example, when a die is rolled, the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Now consider the event E of getting a number less than 3. This event
consists of the outcomes 1 and 2. The probability of event E is
PðEÞ ¼ 2
6 ¼ 1
3. The outcomes in which E will not occur are 3, 4, 5, and 6, so
the probability that event E will not occur is 4
6 ¼ 2
3. The answer can also
be found by substracting from 1, the probability that event E will occur.
That is, 1  1
3 ¼ 2
3.
If an event E consists of certain outcomes, then event E (E bar) is called the
complement of event E and consists of the outcomes in the sample space
which are not outcomes of event E. In the previous situation, the outcomes in
E are 1 and 2. Therefore, the outcomes in E are 3, 4, 5, and 6. Now rule ﬁve
can be stated mathematically as
PðEÞ ¼ 1  PðEÞ:
EXAMPLE: If the chance of rain is 0.60 (60%), ﬁnd the probability that it
won’t rain.
SOLUTION:
Since P(E) = 0.60 and PðEÞ ¼ 1  PðEÞ, the probability that it won’t rain is
1  0.60 = 0.40 or 40%. Hence the probability that it won’t rain is 40%.

Empirical Probability
Probabilities can be computed for situations that do not use sample spaces.
In such cases, frequency distributions are used and the probability is called
empirical probability. For example, suppose a class of students consists of
4 freshmen, 8 sophomores, 6 juniors, and 7 seniors. The information can be
summarized in a frequency distribution as follows:
Rank
Frequency
Freshmen
4
Sophomores
8
Juniors
6
Seniors
7
TOTAL
25
From a frequency distribution, probabilities can be computed using the
following formula.
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
11

PðEÞ ¼
frequency of E
sum of the frequencies
Empirical probability is sometimes called relative frequency probability.
EXAMPLE: Using the frequency distribution shown previously, ﬁnd the
probability of selecting a junior student at random.
SOLUTION:
Since there are 6 juniors and a total of 25 students, P( junior) ¼ 6
25.
Another aspect of empirical probability is that if a large number of
subjects (called a sample) is selected from a particular group (called a
population), and the probability of a speciﬁc attribute is computed, then when
another subject is selected, we can say that the probability that this subject
has the same attribute is the same as the original probability computed for
the group. For example, a Gallup Poll of 1004 adults surveyed found that
17% of the subjects stated that they considered Abraham Lincoln to be the
greatest President of the United States. Now if a subject is selected, the
probability that he or she will say that Abraham Lincoln was the greatest
president is also 17%.
Several things should be explained here. First of all, the 1004 people
constituted a sample selected from a larger group called the population.
Second, the exact probability for the population can never be known unless
every single member of the group is surveyed. This does not happen in these
kinds of surveys since the population is usually very large. Hence, the 17% is
only an estimate of the probability. However, if the sample is representative
of the population, the estimate will usually be fairly close to the exact
probability. Statisticians have a way of computing the accuracy (called the
margin of error) for these situations. For the present, we shall just
concentrate on the probability.
Also, by a representative sample, we mean the subjects of the sample have
similar characteristics as those in the population. There are statistical
methods to help the statisticians obtain a representative sample. These
methods are called sampling methods and can be found in many statistics
books.

SOLUTION:
The probability is 7%.
EXAMPLE: In a sample of 642 people over 25 years of age, 160 had a
bachelor’s degree. If a person over 25 years of age is selected, ﬁnd the
probability that the person has a bachelor’s degree.
SOLUTION:
In this case,
Pðbachelor’s degreeÞ ¼ 160
642 ¼ 0:249 or about 25%:
EXAMPLE: In the sample study of 642 people, it was found that 514 people
have a high school diploma. If a person is selected at random, ﬁnd the
probability that the person does not have a high school diploma.
SOLUTION:
The probability that a person has a high school diploma is
P(high school diploma) ¼ 514
642 ¼ 0:80 or 80%:
Hence, the probability that a person does not have a high school diploma is
P ðno high school diplomaÞ ¼ 1  Pðhigh school diplomaÞ
¼ 1  0:80 ¼ 0:20 or 20%:
Alternate Solution:
If 514 people have a high school diploma, then 642  514 ¼ 128 do not have a
high school diploma. Hence
Pðno high school diplomaÞ ¼ 128
642 ¼ 0:199 or 20% rounded:
Consider another aspect of probability. Suppose a baseball player has a
batting average of 0.250. What is the probability that he will get a hit the next
time he gets to bat? Although we cannot be sure of the exact probability, we
can use 0.250 as an estimate. Since 0:250 ¼ 1
4, we can say that there is a one
in four chance that he will get a hit the next time he bats.

Law of Large Numbers
We know from classical probability that if a coin is tossed one time, we
cannot predict the outcome, but the probability of getting a head is 1
2 and
the probability of getting a tail is 1
2 if everything is fair. But what happens if
we toss the coin 100 times? Will we get 50 heads? Common sense tells us that
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
15

most of the time, we will not get exactly 50 heads, but we should get close to
50 heads. What will happen if we toss a coin 1000 times? Will we get
exactly 500 heads? Probably not. However, as the number of tosses increases,
the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of tosses will get
closer to 1
2. This phenomenon is known as the law of large numbers. This
law holds for any type of gambling game such as rolling dice, playing
roulette, etc.
Subjective Probability
A third type of probability is called subjective probability. Subjective
probability is based upon an educated guess, estimate, opinion, or inexact
information. For example, a sports writer may say that there is a 30%
probability that the Pittsburgh Steelers will be in the Super Bowl next year.
Here the sports writer is basing his opinion on subjective information such
as the relative strength of the Steelers, their opponents, their coach, etc.
Subjective probabilities are used in everyday life; however, they are beyond
the scope of this book.
Summary
Probability
is
the
mathematics
of
chance.
There
are
three
types
of probability: classical probability, empirical probability, and subjective
probability. Classical probability uses sample spaces. A sample space is the
set of outcomes of a probability experiment. The range of probability is from
0 to 1. If an event cannot occur, its probability is 0. If an event is certain to
occur, its probability is 1. Classical probability is deﬁned as the number of
ways (outcomes) the event can occur divided by the total number of
outcomes in the sample space.
Empirical probability uses frequency distributions, and it is deﬁned as the
frequency of an event divided by the total number of frequencies.
Subjective probability is made by a person’s knowledge of the situation
and is basically an educated guess as to the chances of an event occurring.

Probability Sidelight
BRIEF HISTORY OF PROBABILITY
The concepts of probability are as old as humans. Paintings in tombs
excavated in Egypt showed that people played games based on chance as
early as 1800 B.C.E. One game was called ‘‘Hounds and Jackals’’ and is
similar to the present-day game of ‘‘Snakes and Ladders.’’
Ancient Greeks and Romans made crude dice from various items such
as animal bones, stones, and ivory. When some of these items were tested
recently, they were found to be quite accurate. These crude dice were also
used in fortune telling and divination.
Emperor Claudius (10 BCE–54 CE) is said to have written a book entitled
How To Win at Dice. He liked playing dice so much that he had a special dice
board in his carriage.
No formal study of probability was done until the 16th century when
Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576) wrote a book on probability entitled The
Book on Chance and Games. Cardano was a philosopher, astrologer,
physician, mathematician, and gambler. In his book, he also included
techniques on how to cheat and how to catch others who are cheating. He is
believed to be the ﬁrst mathematician to formulate a deﬁnition of classical
probability.
During the mid-1600s, a professional gambler named Chevalier de Mere
made a considerable amount of money on a gambling game. He would bet
unsuspecting patrons that in four rolls of a die, he could obtain at least one 6.
He was so successful at winning that word got around, and people refused to
play. He decided to invent a new game in order to keep winning. He
would bet patrons that if he rolled two dice 24 times, he would get at least
one double 6. However, to his dismay, he began to lose more often than he
would win and lost money.
CHAPTER 1
Basic Concepts
20

Unable to ﬁgure out why he was losing, he asked a renowned
mathematician, Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) to study the game. Pascal was a
child prodigy when it came to mathematics. At the age of 14, he participated
in weekly meetings of the mathematicians of the French Academy. At the age
of 16, he invented a mechanical adding machine.
Becauseofthediceproblem,Pascalbecameinterestedinstudyingprobability
and began a correspondence with a French government oﬃcial and fellow
mathematician, Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Together the two were able to
solve de Mere’s dilemma and formulate the beginnings of probability theory.
In 1657, a Dutch mathematician named Christian Huygens wrote a treatise
on the Pascal–Fermat correspondence and introduced the idea of mathemat-
ical expectation. (See Chapter 5.)
Abraham de Moivre (1667–1754) wrote a book on probability entitled
Doctrine of Chances in 1718. He published a second edition in 1738.
Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) wrote a book and a series of
supplements on probability from 1812 to 1825. His purpose was to acquaint
readers with the theory of probability and its applications, using everyday
language. He also stated that the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow
is 1,826,214
1,826,215.
Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781–1840) developed the concept of the Poisson
distribution. (See Chapter 8.)
Also during the 1800s a mathematician named Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777–1855) developed the concepts of the normal distribution. Earlier work
on the normal distribution was also done by de Moivre and Laplace,
unknown to Gauss. (See Chapter 9.)
In 1895, the Fey Manufacturing Company of San Francisco invented the
ﬁrst automatic slot machine. These machines consisted of three wheels that
were spun when a handle on the side of the machine was pulled. Each wheel
contained 20 symbols; however, the number of each type of symbols was not
the same on each wheel. For example, the ﬁrst wheel may have 6 oranges,
while the second wheel has 3 oranges, and the third wheel has only one.
When a person gets two oranges, the person may think that he has almost
won by getting 2 out of 3 equitable symbols, while the real probability of
winning is much smaller.
In the late 1940s, two mathematicians, Jon von Neumann and Stanislaw
Ulam used a computer to simulate probability experiments. This method is
called the Monte Carlo method. (See Chapter 10.)
Today probability theory is used in insurance, gambling, war gaming, the
stock market, weather forecasting, and many other areas.

CHAPTER
Sample Spaces
Introduction
In order to compute classical probabilities, you need to ﬁnd the sample
space for a probability experiment. In the previous chapter, sample spaces
were found by using common sense. In this chapter two speciﬁc devices
will be used to ﬁnd sample spaces for probability experiments. They are tree
diagrams and tables.
Tree Diagrams
A tree diagram consists of branches corresponding to the outcomes of two or
more probability experiments that are done in sequence.
In order to construct a tree diagram, use branches corresponding to the
outcomes of the ﬁrst experiment. These branches will emanate from a single
22

point. Then from each branch of the ﬁrst experiment draw branches that
represent the outcomes of the second experiment. You can continue the
process for further experiments of the sequence if necessary.
EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed and a die is rolled. Draw a tree diagram and
ﬁnd the sample space.
SOLUTION:
1. Since there are two outcomes (heads and tails for the coin), draw two
branches from a single point and label one H for head and the other
one T for tail.
2. From each one of these outcomes, draw and label six branches repre-
senting the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the die.
3. Trace through each branch to ﬁnd the outcomes of the experiment.
See Figure 2-1.
Hence there are twelve outcomes. They are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T1,
T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6.
Once the sample space has been found, probabilities for events can be
computed.
Fig. 2-1.
CHAPTER 2
Sample Spaces
23

EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed and a die is rolled. Find the probability of
getting
a. A head on the coin and a 3 on the die.
b. A head on the coin.
c. A 4 on the die.
SOLUTION:
a. Since there are 12 outcomes in the sample space and only one way to
get a head on the coin and a three on the die,
PðH3Þ ¼ 1
12
b. Since there are six ways to get a head on the coin, namely H1, H2, H3,
H4, H5, and H6,
Pðhead on the coin) ¼ 6
12 ¼ 1
2
c. Since there are two ways to get a 4 on the die, namely H4 and T4,
Pð4 on the die) ¼ 2
12 ¼ 1
6
EXAMPLE: Three coins are tossed. Draw a tree diagram and ﬁnd the sample
space.
SOLUTION:
Each coin can land either heads up (H) or tails up (T); therefore, the tree
diagram will consist of three parts and each part will have two branches.
See Figure 2-2.
Fig. 2-2.
CHAPTER 2
Sample Spaces
24

Hence the sample space is HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH,
TTT.
Once the sample space is found, probabilities can be computed.
EXAMPLE: Three coins are tossed. Find the probability of getting
a. Two heads and a tail in any order.
b. Three heads.
c. No heads.
d. At least two tails.
e. At most two tails.
SOLUTION:
a. There are eight outcomes in the sample space, and there are three ways
to get two heads and a tail in any order. They are HHT, HTH,
and THH; hence,
P(2 heads and a tail) ¼ 3
8
b. Three heads can occur in only one way; hence
PðHHHÞ ¼ 1
8
c. The event of getting no heads can occur in only one way—namely
TTT; hence,
PðTTTÞ ¼ 1
8
d. The event of at least two tails means two tails and one head or three
tails. There are four outcomes in this event—namely TTH, THT,
HTT, and TTT; hence,
P(at least two tails) ¼ 4
8 ¼ 1
2
e. The event of getting at most two tails means zero tails, one tail,
or two tails. There are seven outcomes in this event—HHH, THH,
HTH, HHT, TTH, THT, and HTT; hence,
P(at most two tails) ¼ 7
8
When selecting more than one object from a group of objects, it is
important to know whether or not the object selected is replaced before
drawing the second object. Consider the next two examples.
CHAPTER 2
Sample Spaces
25

EXAMPLE: A box contains a red ball (R), a blue ball (B), and a yellow ball
(Y). Two balls are selected at random in succession. Draw a tree diagram and
ﬁnd the sample space if the ﬁrst ball is replaced before the second ball is
selected.
SOLUTION:
There are three ways to select the ﬁrst ball. They are a red ball, a blue ball, or
a yellow ball. Since the ﬁrst ball is replaced before the second one is selected,
there are three ways to select the second ball. They are a red ball, a blue ball,
or a yellow ball. The tree diagram is shown in Figure 2-3.
The sample space consists of nine outcomes. They are RR, RB, RY, BR,
BB, BY, YR, YB, YY. Each outcome has a probability of 1
9:
Now what happens if the ﬁrst ball is not replaced before the second ball
is selected?
EXAMPLE: A box contains a red ball (R), a blue ball (B), and a yellow ball
(Y). Two balls are selected at random in succession. Draw a tree diagram and
ﬁnd the sample space if the ﬁrst ball is not replaced before the second ball is
selected.
SOLUTION:
There are three outcomes for the ﬁrst ball. They are a red ball, a blue ball, or
a yellow ball. Since the ﬁrst ball is not replaced before the second ball is
drawn, there are only two outcomes for the second ball, and these outcomes
depend on the color of the ﬁrst ball selected. If the ﬁrst ball selected is blue,
then the second ball can be either red or yellow, etc. The tree diagram is
shown in Figure 2-4.

Tables
Another way to ﬁnd a sample space is to use a table.
EXAMPLE: Find the sample space for selecting a card from a standard deck
of 52 cards.
SOLUTION:
There are four suits—hearts and diamonds, which are red, and spades and
clubs, which are black. Each suit consists of 13 cards—ace through king.
Hence, the sample space can be shown using a table. See Figure 2-10.
Face cards are kings, queens, and jacks.
Once the sample space is found, probabilities for events can be computed.
Fig. 2-9.
Fig. 2-10.
CHAPTER 2

EXAMPLE: A single card is drawn at random from a standard deck of
cards. Find the probability that it is
a. The 4 of diamonds.
b. A queen.
c. A 5 or a heart.
SOLUTION:
a. The sample space consists of 52 outcomes and only one outcome is
the four of diamonds; hence,
Pð4^Þ ¼ 1
52
b. Since there are four queens (one of each suit),
PðQÞ ¼ 4
52 ¼ 1
13
c. In this case, there are 13 hearts and 4 ﬁves; however, the 5˘ has been
counted twice, so the number of ways to get a 5 or a heart is
13 þ 4  1 ¼ 16. Hence,
Pð5 or ˘Þ ¼ 16
52 ¼ 4
13 :
A table can be used for the sample space when two dice are rolled. Since
the ﬁrst die can land in 6 ways and the second die can land in 6 ways, there
are 6  6 or 36 outcomes in the sample space. It does not matter whether the
two dice are of the same color or diﬀerent color. The sample space is shown
in Figure 2-11.
Fig. 2-11.
CHAPTER 2
Sample Spaces
31

Notice that the sample space consists of ordered pairs of numbers. The
outcome (4, 2) means that a 4 was obtained on the ﬁrst die and a 2 was
obtained on the second die. The sum of the spots on the faces in this case is
4 þ 2 ¼ 6. Probability problems involving rolling two dice can be solved using
the sample space shown in Figure 2-11.
EXAMPLE: When two dice are rolled, ﬁnd the probability of getting a sum
of nine.
SOLUTION:
There are four ways of rolling a nine. They are (6, 3), (5, 4), (4, 5), and (3, 6).
The sample space consists of 36 outcomes. Hence,
Pð9Þ ¼ 4
36 ¼ 1
9
EXAMPLE: When two dice are rolled, ﬁnd the probability of getting
doubles.
SOLUTION:
There are six ways to get doubles. They are (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5),
and (6, 6); hence
PðdoublesÞ ¼ 6
36 ¼ 1
6
EXAMPLE: When two dice are rolled, ﬁnd the probability of getting a sum
less than ﬁve.
SOLUTION:
A sum less than ﬁve means a sum of four, three, or two. There are three ways
of getting a sum of four. They are (3, 1), (2, 2), and (1, 3). There are two ways
of getting a sum of three. They are (2, 1), and (1, 2). There is one way of
getting a sum of two. It is (1, 1). The total number of ways of getting a sum
less than ﬁve is 3 þ 2 þ 1 ¼ 6. Hence,
P(sum less than 6) ¼ 6
36 ¼ 1
6
CHAPTER 2

EXAMPLE: When two dice are rolled, ﬁnd the probability that one of the
numbers is a 6.

There are 11 outcomes that contain a 6. They are (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6),
(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), and (6, 1). Hence,
P(one of the numbers is a six) ¼ 11

Summary
Two devices can be used to represent sample spaces. They are tree diagrams
and tables.
A tree diagram can be used to determine the outcome of a probability
experiment. A tree diagram consists of branches corresponding to the
outcomes of two or more probability experiments that are done in sequence.
Sample spaces can also be represented by using tables. For example, the
outcomes when selecting a card from an ordinary deck can be represented by
a table. When two dice are rolled, the 36 outcomes can be represented by
using a table. Once a sample space is found, probabilities can be computed
for speciﬁc events.

HISTORY OF DICE AND CARDS
Dice are one of the earliest known gambling devices used by humans. They
have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs and in the prehistoric caves of
people in Europe and America. The ﬁrst dice were made from animal
bones—namely the astragalus or the heel bone of a hoofed animal. These
bones are very smooth and easily carved. The astragalus had only four sides
as opposed to modern cubical dice that have six sides. The astragalus was
used for fortune telling, gambling, and board games.
By 3000 B.C.E. the Egyptians had devised many board games. Ancient
tomb paintings show pharaohs playing board games, and a game similar to
today’s ‘‘Snakes and Ladders’’ was found in an Egyptian tomb dating to
1800 B.C.E. Eventually crude cubic dice evolved from the astragalus. The
dice were ﬁrst made from bones, then clay, wood, and ﬁnally polished stones.
Dots were used instead of numbers since writing numbers was very
complicated at that time.
It was thought that the outcomes of rolled dice were controlled by the gods
that the people worshipped. As one story goes, the Romans incorrectly
reasoned that there were three ways to get a sum of seven when two dice are
rolled. They are 6 and 1, 5 and 2, and 4 and 3. They also reasoned incorrectly
that there were three ways to get a sum of six: 5 and 1, 4 and 2, and 3 and 3.
CHAPTER 2
Sample Spaces
41

They knew from gambling with dice that a sum of seven appeared more than
a sum of six. They believed that the reason was that the gods favored
the number seven over the number six, since seven at the time was considered
a ‘‘lucky number.’’ Furthermore, they even ‘‘loaded’’ dice so that the faces
showing one and six occurred more often than other faces would, if the dice
were fair.
It is interesting to note that on today’s dice, the numbers on the opposite
faces sum to seven. That is, 4 is opposite 3, 2 is opposite 5, and 6 is opposite 1.
This was not always true. Early dice showed 1 opposite 2, 3 opposite 4, and 5
opposite 6. The changeover to modern conﬁguration is believed to have
occurred in Egypt.
Many of the crude dice have been tested and found to be quite accurate.
Actually mathematicians began to study the outcomes of dice only around
the 16th century. The great astronomer Galileo Galilei is usually given the
credit for ﬁguring out that when three dice are rolled, there are 216 total
outcomes, and that a sum of 10 and 11 is more probable than a sum of 9
and 12. This fact was known intuitively by gamblers long before this time.
Today, dice are used in many types of gambling games and many types of
board games. Where would we be today without the game of Monopoly?
It is thought that playing cards evolved from long wooden sticks that had
various markings and were used by early fortunetellers and gamblers in the
Far East. When the Chinese invented paper over 2000 years ago, people
marked long thin strips of paper and used them instead of wooden sticks.
Paper ‘‘cards’’ ﬁrst appeared in Europe around 1300 and were widely used
in most of the European countries. Some decks contained 17 cards; others
had 22 cards. The early cards were hand-painted and quite expensive to
produce. Later stencils were used to cut costs.
The markings on the cards changed quite often. Besides the four suits
commonly used today, early decks of cards had 5 or 6 suits and used other
symbols such as coins, ﬂowers, and leaves.
The ﬁrst cards to be manufactured in the United States were made by
Jazaniah Ford in the late 1700s. His company lasted over 50 years. The ﬁrst
book on gambling published in the United States was an edition of Hoyle’s
Games, which was printed in 1796.

The Addition Rules
Introduction
In this chapter, the theory of probability is extended by using what are called
the addition rules. Here one is interested in ﬁnding the probability of one
event or another event occurring. In these situations, one must consider
whether or not both events have common outcomes. For example, if you are
asked to ﬁnd the probability that you will get three oranges or three cherries
on a slot machine, you know that these two events cannot occur at the same
time if the machine has only three windows. In another situation you may be
asked to ﬁnd the probability of getting an odd number or a number less than
500 on a daily three-digit lottery drawing. Here the events have common
outcomes. For example, the number 451 is an odd number and a number less
than 500. The two addition rules will enable you to solve these kinds of
problems as well as many other probability problems.

Mutually Exclusive Events
Many problems in probability involve ﬁnding the probability of two or more
events. For example, when a card is selected at random from a deck, what is
the probability that the card is a king or a queen? In this case, there are two
situations to consider. They are:
1. The card selected is a king
2. The card selected is a queen
Now consider another example. When a card is selected from a deck, ﬁnd
the probability that the card is a king or a diamond.
In this case, there are three situations to consider:
1. The card is a king
2. The card is a diamond
3. The card is a king and a diamond. That is, the card is the king of
diamonds.
The diﬀerence is that in the ﬁrst example, a card cannot be both a king and
a queen at the same time, whereas in the second example, it is possible for the
card selected to be a king and a diamond at the same time. In the ﬁrst
example, we say the two events are mutually exclusive. In the second example,
we say the two events are not mutually exclusive. Two events then are
mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. In other words, the
events have no common outcomes.
EXAMPLE: Which of these events are mutually exclusive?
a. Selecting a card at random from a deck and getting an ace or a club
b. Rolling a die and getting an odd number or a number less than 4
c. Rolling two dice and getting a sum of 7 or 11
d. Selecting a student at random who is full-time or part-time
e. Selecting a student who is a female or a junior
SOLUTION:
a. No. The ace of clubs is an outcome of both events.
b. No. One and three are common outcomes.
c. Yes
d. Yes
e. No. A female student who is a junior is a common outcome.
CHAPTER 3
The Addition Rules

Addition Rule I
The probability of two or more events occurring can be determined by using
the addition rules. The ﬁrst rule is used when the events are mutually
exclusive.
Addition Rule I: When two events are mutually exclusive,
PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ
EXAMPLE: When a die is rolled, ﬁnd the probability of getting a 2 or a 3.
SOLUTION:
As shown in Chapter 1, the problem can be solved by looking at the sample
space, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Since there are 2 favorable outcomes from
6 outcomes, P(2 or 3) ¼ 2
6 ¼ 1
3. Since the events are mutually exclusive,
addition rule 1 also can be used:
Pð2 or 3Þ ¼ Pð2Þ þ Pð3Þ ¼ 1
6 þ 1
6 ¼ 2
6 ¼ 1
3
EXAMPLE: In a committee meeting, there were 5 freshmen, 6 sophomores,
3 juniors, and 2 seniors. If a student is selected at random to be the
chairperson, ﬁnd the probability that the chairperson is a sophomore or a
junior.
SOLUTION:
There are 6 sophomores and 3 juniors and a total of 16 students.
P(sophomore or junior) ¼ PðsophomoreÞ þ Pð juniorÞ ¼ 6
16 þ 3
16 ¼ 9
16
EXAMPLE: A card is selected at random from a deck. Find the probability
that the card is an ace or a king.
SOLUTION:
P(ace or king) ¼ PðaceÞ þ PðkingÞ ¼ 4
52 þ 4
52 ¼ 8
52 ¼ 2

The word or is the key word, and it means one event occurs or the other
event occurs.

Addition Rule II
When two events are not mutually exclusive, you need to add the probabilities
of each of the two events and subtract the probability of the outcomes that
are common to both events. In this case, addition rule II can be used.
Addition Rule II: If A and B are two events that are not mutually exclusive,
then PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ  PðA and BÞ, where A and B means the num-
ber of outcomes that event A and event B have in common.
CHAPTER 3
The Addition Rules
47

EXAMPLE: A card is selected at random from a deck of 52 cards. Find the
probability that it is a 6 or a diamond.
SOLUTION:
Let A ¼ the event of getting a 6; then PðAÞ ¼ 4
52 since there are four 6s.
Let B ¼ the event of getting a diamond; then PðBÞ ¼ 13
52 since there are
13 diamonds. Since there is one card that is both a 6 and a diamond (i.e., the
6 of diamonds), PðA and BÞ ¼ 1
52. Hence,
PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ  PðA and BÞ ¼ 4
52 þ 13
52  1
52 ¼ 16
52 ¼ 4
13
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled. Find the probability of getting an even number
or a number less than 4.
SOLUTION:
Let A ¼ an even number; then PðAÞ ¼ 3
6 since there are 3 even numbers—2, 4,
and 6. Let B ¼ a number less than 4; then PðBÞ ¼ 3
6 since there are 3 numbers
less than 4—1, 2, and 3. Let (A and B) ¼ even numbers less than 4 and
PðA and BÞ ¼ 1
6 since there is one even number less than 4—namely 2. Hence,
PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ  PðA and BÞ ¼ 3
6 þ 3
6  1
6 ¼ 5
6
The results of both these examples can be veriﬁed by using sample spaces
and classical probability.
EXAMPLE: Two dice are rolled; ﬁnd the probability of getting doubles or a
sum of 8.
SOLUTION:
Let A ¼ getting doubles; then PðAÞ ¼ 6
36 since there are 6 ways to get doubles
and let B ¼ getting a sum of 8. Then PðBÞ ¼ 5
36 since there are 5 ways to get a
sum of 8—(6, 2), (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5), and (2, 6). Let (A and B) ¼ the number of
ways to get a double and a sum of 8. There is only one way for this event to
occur—(4, 4); then PðA and BÞ ¼ 1
36. Hence,
PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ  PðA and BÞ ¼ 6
36 þ 5
36  1
36 ¼ 10
36 ¼ 5

CHAPTER 3
The Addition Rules

EXAMPLE: At a political rally, there are 8 Democrats and 10 Republicans.
Six of the Democrats are females and 5 of the Republicans are females. If a
person is selected at random, ﬁnd the probability that the person is a female
or a Democrat.
SOLUTION:
There are 18 people at the rally. Let PðfemaleÞ ¼ 6 þ 5
18 ¼ 11
18 since there are
11 females, and PðDemocratÞ ¼ 8
18 since there are 8 Democrats. Pðfemale and
DemocratÞ ¼ 6
18 since 6 of the Democrats are females. Hence,
Pðfemale or DemocratÞ ¼ PðfemaleÞ þ PðDemocratÞ
 Pðfemale and DemocratÞ
¼ 11
18 þ 8
18  6
18 ¼ 13
18
EXAMPLE: The probability that a student owns a computer is 0.92, and
the probability that a student owns an automobile is 0.53. If the probability
that a student owns both a computer and an automobile is 0.49, ﬁnd
the probability that the student owns a computer or an automobile.
SOLUTION:
Since P(computer) ¼ 0.92, P(automobile) ¼ 0.53, and P(computer and auto-
mobile) ¼ 0.49, P(computer or automobile) ¼ 0.92 þ 0.53  0.49 ¼ 0.96.
The key word for addition is ‘‘or,’’ and it means that one event or the other
occurs. If the events are not mutually exclusive, the probability of the
outcomes that the two events have in common must be subtracted from the
sum of the probabilities of the two events. For the mathematical purist, only
one addition rule is necessary, and that is
PðA or BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ  PðA and BÞ
The reason is that when the events are mutually exclusive, P(A and B)
is equal to zero because mutually exclusive events have no outcomes in
common.

Summary
Many times in probability, it is necessary to ﬁnd the probability of two or
more events occurring. In these cases, the addition rules are used. When the
events are mutually exclusive, addition rule I is used, and when the events are
not mutually exclusive, addition rule II is used. If the events are mutually
exclusive, they have no outcomes in common. When the two events are not
mutually exclusive, they have some common outcomes. The key word in
these problems is ‘‘or,’’ and it means to add.

Probability Sidelight
WIN A MILLION OR BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING?
Do you think you are more likely to win a large lottery and become a
millionaire or are you more likely to be struck by lightning?
Consider each probability. In a recent article, researchers estimated that
the chance of winning a million or more dollars in a lottery is about one in
2 million. In a recent Pennsylvania State Lottery, the chances of winning
a million dollars were 1 in 9.6 million. The chances of winning a $10 million
prize in Publisher’s Clearinghouse Sweepstakes were 1 in 2 million. Now the
chances of being struck by lightning are about 1 in 600,000. Thus, a person is
at least three times more likely to be struck by lightning than win a million
dollars!
But wait a minute! Statisticians are critical of these types of comparisons,
since winning the lottery is a random occurrence. But being struck by
lightning depends on several factors. For example, if a person lives in a
region where there are a lot of thunderstorms, his or her chances of being
struck increase. Also, where a person is during a thunder storm inﬂuences his
or her chances of being struck by lightning. If the person is in a safe place
such as inside a building or in an automobile, the probability of being struck
is relatively small compared to a person standing out in a ﬁeld or on a golf
course during a thunderstorm.
So be wary of such comparisons. As the old saying goes, you cannot
compare apples and oranges.

The Multiplication
Rules
Introduction
The previous chapter showed how the addition rules could be used to solve
problems in probability. This chapter will show you how to use the
multiplication rules to solve many problems in probability. In addition, the
concept of independent and dependent events will be introduced.

Independent and Dependent Events
The multiplication rules can be used to ﬁnd the probability of two or more
events that occur in sequence. For example, we can ﬁnd the probability of
selecting three jacks from a deck of cards on three sequential draws. Before
explaining the rules, it is necessary to diﬀerentiate between independent and
dependent events.
Two events, A and B, are said to be independent if the fact that event A
occurs does not aﬀect the probability that event B occurs. For example, if a
coin is tossed and then a die is rolled, the outcome of the coin in no way
aﬀects or changes the probability of the outcome of the die. Another
example would be selecting a card from a deck, replacing it, and
then selecting a second card from a deck. The outcome of the ﬁrst card, as
long as it is replaced, has no eﬀect on the probability of the outcome of the
second card.
On the other hand, when the occurrence of the ﬁrst event in some way
changes the probability of the occurrence of the second event, the two events
are said to be dependent. For example, suppose a card is selected from a deck
and not replaced, and a second card is selected. In this case, the probability of
selecting any speciﬁc card on the ﬁrst draw is 1
52, but since this card is not
replaced, the probability of selecting any other speciﬁc card on the second
draw is 1
51, since there are only 51 cards left.
Another example would be parking in a no parking zone and getting a
parking ticket. Again, if you are legally parked, the chances of getting a
parking ticket are pretty close to zero (as long as the meter does not run out).
However, if you are illegally parked, your chances of getting a parking ticket
dramatically increase.
PRACTICE
Determine whether the two events are independent or dependent.
1. Tossing a coin and selecting a card from a deck
2. Driving on ice and having an accident
3. Drawing a ball from an urn, not replacing it, and then drawing a
second ball
4. Having a high I.Q. and having a large hat size
5. Tossing one coin and then tossing a second coin
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
57

ANSWERS
1. Independent. Tossing a coin has no eﬀect on drawing a card.
2. Dependent. In most cases, driving on ice will increase the probability
of having an accident.
3. Dependent. Since the ﬁrst ball is not replaced before the second ball is
selected, it will change the probability of a speciﬁc second ball being
selected.
4. Independent. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no studies have
been done showing any relationship between hat size and I.Q.
5. Independent. The outcome of the ﬁrst coin does not inﬂuence the
outcome of the second coin.
Multiplication Rule I
Before explaining the ﬁrst multiplication rule, consider the example of tossing
two coins. The sample space is HH, HT, TH, TT. From classical probability
theory, it can be determined that the probability of getting two heads is 1
4,
since there is only one way to get two heads and there are four outcomes in
the sample space. However, there is another way to determine the probability
of getting two heads. In this case, the probability of getting a head on the ﬁrst
toss is 1
2, and the probability of getting a head on the second toss is also 1
2.
So the probability of getting two heads can be determined by multiplying
1
2  1
2 ¼ 1
4 This example illustrates the ﬁrst multiplication rule.
Multiplication Rule I: For two independent events A and B, PðA and BÞ ¼
PðAÞ  PðBÞ.
In other words, when two independent events occur in sequence, the prob-
ability that both events will occur can be found by multiplying the probabil-
ities of each individual event.
The word and is the key word and means that both events occur in
sequence and to multiply.
EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed and a die is rolled. Find the probability of
getting a tail on the coin and a 5 on the die.
SOLUTION:
Since PðtailÞ ¼ 1
2 and Pð5Þ ¼ 1
6 ; Pðtail and 5Þ ¼ PðtailÞ  Pð5Þ ¼ 1
2  1
6 ¼ 1
12.
Note that the events are independent.
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
58

The previous example can also be solved using classical probability. Recall
that the sample space for tossing a coin and rolling a die is
H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6
Notice that there are 12 outcomes in the sample space and only one
outcome is a tail and a 5; hence, P(tail and 5) ¼ 1
12.
EXAMPLE: An urn contains 2 red balls, 3 green balls, and 5 blue balls.
A ball is selected at random and its color is noted. Then it is replaced and
another ball is selected and its color is noted. Find the probability of each of
these:
a. Selecting 2 blue balls
b. Selecting a blue ball and then a red ball
c. Selecting a green ball and then a blue ball
SOLUTION:
Since the ﬁrst ball is being replaced before the second ball is selected, the
events are independent.
a. There are 5 blue balls and a total of 10 balls; therefore, the probability
of selecting two blue balls with replacement is
P(blue and blue) ¼ PðblueÞ  PðblueÞ
¼ 5
10  5
10
¼ 25
100 ¼ 1
4
b. There are 5 blue balls and 2 red balls, so the probability of selecting a
blue ball and then a red ball with replacement is
Pðblue and redÞ ¼ PðblueÞ  PðredÞ
¼ 5
10  2
10
¼ 10
100 ¼ 1
10
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
59

c. There are 3 green balls and 5 blue balls, so the probability of selecting
a green ball and then a blue ball with replacement is
Pðgreen and blueÞ ¼ PðgreenÞ  PðblueÞ
¼ 3
10  5
10
¼ 15
100 ¼ 3
20
The multiplication rule can be extended to 3 or more events that
occur in sequence, as shown in the next example.
EXAMPLE: A die is tossed 3 times. Find the probability of getting three 6s.
SOLUTION:
When a die is tossed, the probability of getting a six is 1
6; hence, the probabil-
ity of getting three 6s is
Pð6 and 6 and 6Þ ¼ Pð6Þ  Pð6Þ  Pð6Þ
¼ 1
6  1
6  1
6
¼ 1
216
Another situation occurs in probability when subjects are selected from a
large population. Even though the subjects are not replaced, the probability
changes only slightly, so the change can be ignored. Consider the next
example.
EXAMPLE: It is known that 66% of the students at a large college favor
building a new ﬁtness center. If two students are selected at random, ﬁnd the
probability that all of them favor the building of a new ﬁtness center.
SOLUTION:
Since the student population at the college is large, selecting a student
does not change the 66% probability that the next student selected will
favor the building of a new ﬁtness center; hence, the probability of selecting
two students who both favor the building of a new ﬁtness center is
(0.66)(0.66) ¼ 0.4356 or 43.56%.

3. If two people are selected at random, ﬁnd the probability that both

2. The probability of selecting 3 adults who are left-handed is
(0.12)(0.12)(0.12) ¼ 0.001728.
3. Each person has approximately 1 chance in 12 of being born in
August; hence, the probability that both are born in August is

4; hence, the P(odd and
club) ¼ PðoddÞ  PðclubÞ ¼ 1
2  1
4 ¼ 1
8.
Multiplication Rule II
When two sequential events are dependent, a slight variation of the
multiplication rule is used to ﬁnd the probability of both events occurring.
For example, when a card is selected from an ordinary deck of 52 cards the
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
61

probability of getting a speciﬁc card is
1
52, but the probability of getting a
speciﬁc card on the second draw is 1
51 since 51 cards remain.
EXAMPLE: Two cards are selected from a deck and the ﬁrst card is not
replaced. Find the probability of getting two kings.
SOLUTION:
The probability of getting a king on the ﬁrst draw is 4
52 and the probability
of getting a king on the second draw is
3
51, since there are 3 kings left and
51 cards left. Hence the probability of getting 2 kings when the ﬁrst card is
not replaced is 4
52  3
51 ¼
12
2652 ¼
1
221.
When the two events A and B are dependent, the probability that the
second event B occurs after the ﬁrst event A has already occurred is written as
P(B | A). This does not mean that B is divided by A; rather, it means and is
read as ‘‘the probability that event B occurs given that event A has already
occurred.’’ P(B | A) also means the conditional probability that event B occurs
given event A has occurred. The second multiplication rule follows.
Multiplication Rule II: When two events are dependent, the probability of
both events occurring is PðA and BÞ ¼ PðAÞ  PðB j AÞ
EXAMPLE: A box contains 24 toasters, 3 of which are defective. If
two toasters are selected and tested, ﬁnd the probability that both are
defective.
SOLUTION:
Since there are 3 defective toasters out of 24, the probability that the ﬁrst
toaster is defective is
3
24 ¼ 1
8. Since the second toaster is selected from the
remaining 23 and there are two defective toasters left, the probability that
it is defective is 2
23. Hence, the probability that both toasters are defective is
PðD1 and D2Þ ¼ PðD1Þ  PðD2jD1Þ ¼
31
248 4  21
23 ¼ 1
92
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
62

EXAMPLE: Two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of
52 cards. Find the probability that both are queens.
SOLUTION:
PðQ and QÞ ¼ PðQÞ  PðQjQÞ
¼ 4
52  3
51
¼ 1
221
This multiplication rule can be extended to include three or more events, as
shown in the next example.
EXAMPLE: A box contains 3 orange balls, 3 yellow balls, and 2 white balls.
Three balls are selected without replacement. Find the probability of
selecting 2 yellow balls and a white ball.
SOLUTION:
Pðyellow and yellow and whiteÞ ¼ 3
8  2
7  2
6
¼ 31
84  21
7  21
61
¼ 1
28
Remember that the key word for the multiplication rule is and. It means to
multiply.
When two events are dependent, the probability that the second event
occurs must be adjusted for the occurrence of the ﬁrst event. For the
mathematical purist, only one multiplication rule is necessary for two events,
and that is
PðA and BÞ ¼ PðAÞ  PðB j AÞ:
The reason is that when the events are independent PðBjAÞ ¼ PðBÞ since
the occurrence of the ﬁrst event A has no eﬀect on the occurrence of the
second event B.

Conditional Probability
Previously, conditional probability was used to ﬁnd the probability of
sequential events occurring when they were dependent. Recall that P(B|A)
means the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already
occurred. Another situation where conditional probability can be used is
when additional information about an event is known. Sometimes it might be
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
64

known that some outcomes in the sample space have occurred or that some
outcomes cannot occur. When conditions are imposed or known on events,
there is a possibility that the probability of the certain event occurring may
change. For example, suppose you want to determine the probability that a
house will be destroyed by a hurricane. If you used all houses in the United
States as the sample space, the probability would be very small. However, if
you used only the houses in the states that border the Atlantic Ocean as the
sample space, the probability would be much higher. Consider the following
examples.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled; ﬁnd the probability of getting a 4 if it is known
that an even number occurred when the die was rolled.
SOLUTION:
If it is known that an even number has occurred, the sample space is reduced
to 2, 4, or 6. Hence the probability of getting a 4 is 1
3 since there is one chance
in three of getting a 4 if it is known that the result was an even number.
EXAMPLE: Two dice are rolled. Find the probability of getting a sum of 3 if
it is known that the sum of the spots on the dice was less than six.
SOLUTION:
There are 2 ways to get a sum of 3. They are (1, 2) and (2, 1), and there are
10 ways to get a sum less than six. They are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2),
(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 1); hence, P(sum of 3|sum less than 6) ¼
2
10 ¼ 1
5.
The two previous examples of conditional probability were solved using
classical probability and reduced sample spaces; however, they can be solved
by using the following formula for conditional probability.
The conditional probability of two events A and B is
PðAjBÞ ¼ PðA and BÞ
PðBÞ
:
P(A and B) means the probability of the outcomes that events A and B
have in common. The two previous examples will now be solved using the
formula for conditional probability.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled; ﬁnd the probability of getting a 4, if it is known
that an even number occurred when the die was rolled.
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
65

SOLUTION:
P(A and B) is the probability of getting a 4 and an even number at the same
time. Notice that there is only one way to get a 4 and an even number—the
outcome 4. Hence P(A and B) ¼ 1

it is known that the sum of the spots on the dice was less than 6.

P(A and B) means the probability of getting a sum of 3 and a sum less than 6.
Hence P(A and B) ¼ 2

Summary
When two events occur in sequence, the probability that both events occur
can be found by using one of the multiplication rules. When two events
are independent, the probability that the ﬁrst event occurs does not aﬀect
or change the probability of the second event occurring. If the events are
independent, multiplication rule I is used. When the two events are
dependent, the probability of the second event occurring is changed after
the ﬁrst event occurs. If the events are dependent, multiplication rule II is
used. The key word for using the multiplication rule is ‘‘and.’’ Conditional
probability is used when additional information is known about the
probability of an event.

Probability Sidelight
THE LAW OF AVERAGES
Suppose I asked you that if you tossed a coin 9 times and got 9 heads, what
would you bet that you would get on the tenth toss, heads or tails? Most
people would bet on a tail. When asked why they would select a tail, they
would probably respond that a tail was ‘‘due’’ according to the ‘‘law of
averages.’’ In reality, however, the probability of getting a head on the
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
74

tenth toss is 1
2, and the probability of getting a tail on the tenth toss is 1
2, so
it doesn’t really matter since the probabilities are the same. A coin is an
inanimate object. It does not have a memory. It doesn’t know that in the
long run, the number of heads and the number of tails should balance out.
So does that make the law of averages wrong? No. You see, there’s a big
diﬀerence between asking the question, ‘‘What is the probability of getting
10 heads if I toss a coin ten times?’’ and ‘‘If I get 9 heads in a row, what is
the probability of getting a head on the tenth toss?’’ The answer to the ﬁrst
question is
1
210 ¼
1
1024, that is about 1 chance in 1000, and the answer to the
second question is 1
2.
This reasoning can be applied to many situations. For example, suppose
that a prize is oﬀered for tossing a coin and getting 10 heads in a row. If you
played the game, you would have only one chance in 1024 of winning, but if
1024 people played the game, there is a pretty good chance that somebody
would win the prize. If 2028 people played the game, there would be a good
chance that two people might win. So what does this mean? It means that the
probability of winning big in a lottery or on a slot machine is very small, but
since there are many, many people playing, somebody will probably win;
however, your chances of winning big are very small.
A similar situation occurs when couples have children. Suppose a husband
and wife have four boys and would like to have a girl. It is incorrect to reason
that the chance of having a family of 5 boys is 1
32, so it is more likely that the
next child will be a girl. However, after each child is born, the probability that
the next child is a girl (or a boy for that matter) is about 1
2. The law of
averages is not appropriate here.
My wife’s aunt had seven girls before the ﬁrst boy was born. Also, in the
Life Science Library’s book entitled Mathematics, there is a photograph of
the Landon family of Harrison, Tennessee, that shows Mr. and Mrs. Emery
Landon and their 13 boys!
Another area where people incorrectly apply the law of averages is in
attempting to apply a betting system to gambling games. One such system is
doubling your bet when you lose. Consider a game where a coin is tossed. If it
lands heads, you win what you bet. If it lands tails, you lose. Now if you bet
one dollar on the ﬁrst toss and get a head, you win one dollar. If you get tails,
you lose one dollar and bet two dollars on the next toss. If you win, you are
one dollar ahead because you lost one dollar on the ﬁrst bet but won two
dollars on the second bet. If you get a tail on the second toss, you bet four
dollars on the third toss. If you win, you start over with a one dollar bet, but
if you lose, you bet eight dollars on the next toss. With this system, you win
every time you get a head. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
CHAPTER 4
The Multiplication Rules
75

This strategy won’t work because if you play long enough, you will
eventually run out of money since if you get a series of tails, you must
increase your bet substantially each time. So if you lose ﬁve times in a row,
you have lost $1 þ $2 þ $4 þ $8 þ $16 or $31, and your next bet has to be $32.
So you are betting $63 to win $1. Runs do occur and when they do, hope that
they are in your favor.
Now let’s look at some unusual so-called ‘‘runs.’’
In 1950, a person won 28 straight times playing the game of craps (dice) at
the Desert Inn in Las Vegas. He lost on the twenty-ninth roll. He did not win
big though because after each win he stuﬀed some bills in his pocket. The
event took about one hour and twenty minutes.
In 1959 in a casino in Puerto Rico at a roulette game, the number 10
occurred six times in succession. There are 38 numbers on a roulette wheel.
At a casino in New York in 1943 the color red occurred in a roulette game
32 times in a row, and at a casino in Monte Carlo an even number occurred
in a roulette game 28 times in a row.
These incidents have been reported in two books, one entitled Scarne’s
Complete Guide to Gambling and the other entitled Lady Luck by Warren
Weaver.
So what can be concluded? First, rare events (events with a small
probability of occurring) can and do occur. Second, the more people who
play a game, the more likely someone will win. Finally, the law of averages
applies when there is a large number of independent outcomes in which the
probability of each outcome occurring does not change.

CHAPTER
5
Odds and Expectation
Introduction
In this chapter you will learn about two concepts that are often used in
conjunction with probability. They are odds and expectation. Odds are used
most often in gambling games at casinos and racetracks, and in sports betting
and lotteries. Odds make it easier than probabilities to determine payoﬀs.
Mathematical expectation can be thought of more or less as an average over
the long run. In other words, if you would perform a probability experiment
many times, the expectation would be an average of the outcomes. Also,
expectation can be used to determine the average payoﬀper game in a gamb-
ling game.

Odds
Odds are used by casinos, racetracks, and other gambling establishments to
determine payoﬀs when bets are made. For example, at a race, the odds that
a horse wins the race may be 4 to 1. In this case, if you bet $1 and the horse
wins, you get $4. If you bet $2 and the horse wins, you get $8, and so on.
Odds are computed from probabilities. For example, suppose you roll a
die and if you roll a three, you win. If you roll any other number, you lose.
Furthermore, if you bet one dollar and win, what would the payoﬀbe if you
win? In this case, there are six outcomes, and you have one chance (outcome)
of winning, so the probability that you win is 1
6. That means on average you
win once in every six rolls. So if you lose on the ﬁrst ﬁve rolls and win on the
sixth, you have lost $5 and therefore, you should get $5 if you win on the
sixth roll. So if you bet $1 and win $5, the odds are 1 to 5. Of course, there is
no guarantee that you will win on the sixth roll. You may win on the ﬁrst roll
or any roll, but on average for every six rolls, you will win one time over the
long run.
In gambling games, the odds are expressed backwards. For example,
if there is one chance in six that you will win, the odds are 1 to 5, but in
general, the odds would be given as 5 to 1. In gambling, the house (the people
running the game) will oﬀer lower odds, say 4 to 1, in order to make a proﬁt.
In this case, then, the player wins on average one time in every 6 rolls and
spends on average $5, but when the player wins, he gets only $4. So the house
wins on average $1 for every six rolls of the player.
Odds can be expressed as a fraction, 1
5, or as a ratio, 1 : 5. If the odds of
winning the game are 1 : 5, then the odds of losing are 5 : 1. The odds of
winning the game can also be called the odds ‘‘in favor’’ of the event
occurring. The odds of losing can also be called ‘‘the odds against’’ the event
occurring.
The formulas for odds are
odds in favor ¼
PðEÞ
1  PðEÞ
odds against ¼
PðEÞ
1  PðEÞ
where P(E) is the probability that the event E occurs and PðEÞ is the
probability that the event does not occur.

If the odds in favor of an event occurring are A : B, then the odds against
the event occurring are B : A. For example, if the odds are 1 : 15 that an event
will occur, then the odds against the event occurring are 15 : 1.
Odds can also be expressed as
odds in favor ¼
number of outcomes in favor of the event
number of outcomes not in favor of the event
For example, if two coins are tossed, the odds in favor of getting two heads
were computed previously as 1 : 3. Notice that there is only one way to get
two heads (HH) and three ways of not getting two heads (HT, TH, TT);
hence the odds are 1 : 3.
CHAPTER 5

When the probability of an event occurring is 1
2, then the odds are 1 : 1.
In the realm of gambling, we say the odds are ‘‘even’’ and the chance of the
event is ‘‘ﬁfty–ﬁfty.’’ The game is said to be fair. Odds can be other numbers,
such as 2 : 5, 7 : 4, etc.

Previously it was shown that given the probability of an event, the odds in
favor of the event occurring or the odds against the event occurring can be
found. The opposite is also true. If you know the odds in favor of an event
occurring or the odds against an event occurring, you can ﬁnd the probability
of the event occurring. If the odds in favor of an event occurring are A : B,
then the probability that the event will occur is PðE Þ ¼

Expectation
When a person plays a slot machine, sometimes the person wins and other
times—most often—the person loses. The question is, ‘‘How much will the
person win or lose in the long run?’’ In other words, what is the person’s
expected gain or loss? Although an individual’s exact gain or exact loss
cannot be computed, the overall gain or loss of all people playing the slot
machine can be computed using the concept of mathematical expectation.
Expectation or expected value is a long run average. The expected value is
also called the mean, and it is used in games of chance, insurance, and in
other areas such as decision theory. The outcomes must be numerical in
nature. The expected value of the outcome of a probability experiment can be
found by multiplying each outcome by its corresponding probability and
adding the results.
Formally deﬁned, the expected value for the outcomes of a probability
experiment is EðXÞ ¼ X1  PðX1Þ þ X2  PðX2Þ þ    þ Xn  PðXnÞ where the X
corresponds to an outcome and the P(X) to the corresponding probability of
the outcome.
EXAMPLE: Find the expected value of the number of spots when a die is
rolled.
SOLUTION:
There are 6 outcomes when a die is rolled. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and
each outcome has a probability of 1
6 of occurring, so the expected value
of the numbered spots is EðXÞ ¼ 1  1
6 þ 2  1
6 þ 3  1
6 þ 4  1
6 þ 5  1
6 þ 6  1
6 ¼
21
6 ¼ 3 1
2 or 3:5:
The expected value is 3.5.
Now what does this mean? When a die is rolled, it is not possible to get 3.5
spots, but if a die is rolled say 100 times and the average of the spots is
computed, that average should be close to 3.5 if the die is fair. In other words,
3.5 is the theoretical or long run average. For example, if you rolled a die
and were given $1 for each spot on each roll, sometimes you would win $1,
CHAPTER 5
Odds and Expectation
83

$2, $3, $4, $5, or $6; however, on average, you would win $3.50 on each roll.
So
if
you
rolled
the
die
100
times,
you
would
win
on
average
$3.50  100 ¼ $350. Now if you had to pay to play this game, you should
pay $3.50 for each roll. That would make the game fair. If you paid more to
play the game, say $4.00 each time you rolled the die, you would lose on
average $0.50 on each roll. If you paid $3.00 to play the game, you would win
an average $0.50 per roll.
EXAMPLE: When two coins are tossed, ﬁnd the expected value for the
number of heads obtained.
SOLUTION:
Consider the sample space when two coins are tossed.
HH
HT
TH
TT
j

=
j
two heads
one head
zero heads
The probability of getting two heads is 1
4. The probability of getting one
head is 1
4 þ 1
4 ¼ 1
2. The probability of getting no heads is 1
4. The expected value
for the number of heads is EðXÞ ¼ 2  1
4 þ 1  1
2 þ 0  1
4 ¼ 1:
Hence the average number of heads obtained on each toss of 2 coins is 1.
In order to ﬁnd the expected value for a gambling game, multiply the amount
you win by the probability of winning that amount, and then multiply the
amount you lose by the probability of losing that amount, then add the results.
Winning amounts are positive and losses are negative.
EXAMPLE: One thousand raﬄe tickets are sold for a prize of an
entertainment center valued at $750. Find the expected value of the game
if a person buys one ticket.

The problem can be set up as follows:

Probability, P(X)

CHAPTER 5
Odds and Expectation
84

Since the person who buys a ticket does not get his or her $1 back, the net
gain if he or she wins is $750  $1 ¼ $749. The probability of winning is one
chance in 1000 since 1000 tickets are sold. The net loss is $1 denoted as
negative and the chances of not winning are 1000  1
1000
or
999
1000 : Now EðXÞ ¼
$749 
1
1000 þ ð$1Þ 999
1000 ¼ $0:25:
Here again it is necessary to realize that one cannot lose $0.25 but what
this means is that the house makes $0.25 on every ticket sold. If a person
purchased one ticket for raﬄes like this one over a long period of time, the
person would lose on average $0.25 each time since he or she would win on
average one time in 1000.
There is an alternative method that can be used to solve problems when
tickets are sold or when people pay to play a game. In this case, multiply the
prize value by the probability of winning and subtract the cost of the ticket or
the cost of playing the game. Using the information in the previous example,
the solution looks like this:
EðXÞ ¼ $750 
1
1000  $1 ¼ $0:75  $1 ¼ $0:25:
When the expected value is zero, the game is said to be fair. That is, there is a
ﬁfty–ﬁfty chance of winning. When the expected value of a game is negative, it
is in favor of the house (i.e., the person or organization running the game).
When the expected value of a game is positive, it is in favor of the player. The
last situation rarely ever happens unless the con man is not knowledgeable of
probability theory.
EXAMPLE: One thousand tickets are sold for $2 each and there are four
prizes. They are $500, $250, $100, and $50. Find the expected value if a

Expectation can be used to determine the average amount of money the
house can make on each play of a gambling game. Consider the game called
Chuck-a-luck. A player pays $1 and chooses a number from 1 to 6.
Then three dice are tossed (usually in a cage). If the player’s number comes
up once, the player gets $2. If it comes up twice, the player gets $3, and if it
comes up on all three dice, the player wins $4. Con men like to say that the
probability of any number coming up is 1
6 on each die; therefore, each number
has a probability of 3
6 or 1
2 of occurring, and if it occurs more than once, the
player wins more money. Hence, the game is in favor of the player. This is
not true. The next example shows how to compute the expected value for the
game of Chuck-a-luck.
EXAMPLE: Find the expected value for the game Chuck-a-luck.
SOLUTION:
There are 6  6  6 ¼ 216 outcomes in the sample space for three dice. The
probability of winning on each die is 1

die, (iii) lose on the ﬁrst die, and win on the second and third dice. Therefore,
the probability of winning on two out of three dice is 3 

Summary
Odds are used to determine the payoﬀs in gambling games such as lotteries,
horse races, and sports betting. Odds are computed from probabilities; how-
ever, probabilities can be computed from odds if the true odds are known.
Mathematical expectation can be thought of more or less as a long run
average. If the game is played many times, the average of the outcomes or the
payouts can be computed using mathematical expectation.

Probability Sidelight
PROBABILITY AND GENETICS
An Austrian botanist, Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), studied genetics and used
probability theory to verify his results. Mendel lived in a monastery all of his
adult life and based his research on the observation of plants. He published
his results in an obscure journal and the results remained unknown until the
beginning of the 20th century. At that time, his research was used by a
mathematician, G. H. Hardy, to study human genetics.
Genetics is somewhat more complicated than what is presented here. How-
ever, what is important here is to explain how probability is used in genetics.
One of Mendel’s studies was on the color of the seeds of pea plants. There
were two colors, yellow and green. Mendel theorized that each egg cell and
each pollen cell contained two color genes that split on fertilization. The
oﬀspring then contained one gene cell from each donor. There were three
possibilities: pure yellow seeds, pure green seeds, and hybrid-yellow seeds.
The pure yellow seeds contain two yellow genes. The pure green seeds
contained two green genes. The hybrid-yellow seeds contain one yellow gene
and one green gene. This seed was yellow since the yellow gene is dominant
over the green gene. The green gene is said to be recessive.
Next consider the possibilities. If there are two pure yellow plants, then the
results of fertilization will be YY as shown.
Y
Y

Hence, PðYYÞ ¼ 1:
The results of two pure green plants will be gg.

Hence, P(gg) ¼ 1.

This format can be used for other traits such as gender, eye color, etc.

chromosomes, and the male contains X and Y chromosomes. Hence the
results of fertilization are

Hence, PðfemaleÞ ¼ PðXXÞ ¼ 1

CHAPTER
The Counting Rules
Introduction
Since probability problems require knowing the total number of ways one or
more events can occur, it is necessary to have a way to compute the number
of outcomes in the sample spaces for a probability experiment. This is
especially true when the number of outcomes is large. For example, when
ﬁnding the probability of a speciﬁc poker hand, it is necessary to know the
number of diﬀerent possible ways ﬁve cards can be dealt from a 52-card deck.
(This computation will be shown later in this chapter.)
In order to do the computation, we use the fundamental counting rule, the
permutation rules, and the combination rule. The rules then can be used to
compute the probability for events such as winning lotteries, getting a speciﬁc
hand in poker, etc.

The Fundamental Counting Rule
The ﬁrst rule is called the Fundamental Counting Rule.
For a sequence of n events in which the ﬁrst event can occur in k1 ways
and the second event can occur in k2 ways and the third event can occur in
k3 ways, and so on, the total number of ways the sequence can occur is
k1  k2  k3 . . . kn:
EXAMPLE: In order to paint a room, a person has a choice of four colors:
white, light blue, yellow, and light green; two types of paint: oil or latex; and
three types of texture: ﬂat, semi-glass, or satin. How many diﬀerent selections
can be made?
SOLUTION:
There are four colors, two types of paint, and three textures, so the total
number of ways a paint can be selected is 4  2  3 ¼ 24 ways.
EXAMPLE: There are four blood types A, B, AB, and O. Blood can be Rhþ
or Rh. Finally, a donor can be male or female. How many diﬀerent
classiﬁcations can be made?
SOLUTION:
4  2  2 ¼ 16
When determining the number of diﬀerent ways a sequence of events can
occur, it is necessary to know whether or not repetitions are permitted. The
next two examples show the diﬀerence between the two situations.
EXAMPLE: The employees of a company are given a 4-digit identiﬁcation
number. How many diﬀerent numbers are available if repetitions are
permitted?
SOLUTION:
There are 10 digits (zero through nine), so each of the four digits can be
selected in ten diﬀerent ways since repetitions are permitted. Hence the
total number of identiﬁcation numbers is 10  10  10  10 ¼ 104 ¼ 10,000.
CHAPTER 6
The Counting Rules
95

EXAMPLE: The employees of a company are given 4-digit identiﬁcation
numbers; however, repetitions are not allowed. How many diﬀerent numbers
are available?
SOLUTION:
In this case, there are 10 ways to select the ﬁrst digit, 9 ways to select the
second digit, 8 ways to select the third digit, and 7 ways to select the fourth
digit, so the total number of ways is 10  9  8  7 ¼ 5040.
PRACTICE
1. A person can select eight diﬀerent colors for an automobile body,
ﬁve diﬀerent colors for the interior, and white or black sidewall tires.
How many diﬀerent color combinations are there for the automobile?
2. A person can select one of ﬁve diﬀerent colors for brick borders, one
type of six diﬀerent ground coverings, and one of three diﬀerent types
of shrubbery. How many diﬀerent types of landscape designs are
there?
3. How many diﬀerent types of identiﬁcation cards consisting of 4 letters
can be made from the ﬁrst ﬁve letters of the alphabet if repetitions are
allowed?
4. How many diﬀerent types of identiﬁcation cards consisting of 4 letters
can be made from the ﬁrst 5 letters of the alphabet if repetitions are
not allowed?
5. A license plate consists of 2 letters and 3 digits. How many diﬀerent
plates can be made if repetitions are permitted? How many can be
made if repetitions are not permitted?
ANSWERS
1. 8  5  2 ¼ 80 color combinations
2. 5  6  3 ¼ 90 types
3. 5  5  5  5 ¼ 54 ¼ 625 cards

Repetitions not permitted 26  25  10  9  8 ¼ 468,000

Factorials
In mathematics there is a notation called factorial notation, which uses the
exclamation point. Some examples of factorial notation are
6! ¼ 6  5  4  3  2  1 ¼ 720
3! ¼ 3  2  1 ¼ 6
5! ¼ 5  4  3  2  1 ¼ 120
1! ¼ 1
Notice that factorial notation means to start with the number and ﬁnd its
product with all of the whole numbers less than the number and stopping at
one. Formally deﬁned,
n! ¼ n  ðn  1Þ  ðn  2Þ . . . 3  2  1
Factorial notation can be stopped at any time. For example,
6! ¼ 6  5! ¼ 6  5  4!
10! ¼ 10  9! ¼ 10  9  8!
In order to use the formulas in the rest of the chapter, it is necessary to
know how to multiply and divide factorials. In order to multiply factorials,
it is necessary to multiply them out and then multiply the products. For
example,
3!  4! ¼ 3  2  1  4  3  2  1 ¼ 144
Notice 3!  4! 6¼ 12! Since 12! ¼ 479,001,600
EXAMPLE: Find the product of 5!  4!
SOLUTION:
5!  4! ¼ 5  4  3  2  1  4  3  2  1 ¼ 2880
Division of factorials is somewhat tricky. You can always multiply them
out and then divide the top number by the bottom number. For example,
8!
6! ¼ 8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

or
you can cancel out, as shown:

You cannot divide factorials directly:

The Permutation Rules
The second way to determine the number of outcomes of an event is to use
the permutation rules. An arrangement of n distinct objects in a speciﬁc order
is called a permutation. For example, if an art dealer had 3 paintings, say A,
B, and C, to arrange in a row on a wall, there would be 6 distinct ways to
display the paintings. They are
ABC
BAC
CAB
ACB
BCA
CBA
The total number of diﬀerent ways can be found using the fundamental
counting rule. There are 3 ways to select the ﬁrst object, 2 ways to select the
second object, and 1 way to select the third object. Hence, there are
3  2  1 ¼ 6 diﬀerent ways to arrange three objects in a row on a shelf.
Another way to solve this kind of problem is to use permutations. The
number of permutations of n objects using all the objects is n!.
CHAPTER 6
The Counting Rules
99

EXAMPLE: In how many diﬀerent ways can 6 people be arranged in a row
for a photograph?
SOLUTION:
This is a permutation of 6 objects. Hence 6! ¼ 6  5  4  3  2  1 ¼ 720 ways.
In the previous example, all the objects were used; however, in many
situations only some of the objects are used. In this case, the permutation rule
can be used.
The arrangement of n objects in a speciﬁc order using r objects at a time is
called a permutation of n objects taking r objects at a time. It is written as nPr
and the formula is
nPr¼
n!
ðn  rÞ!
EXAMPLE: In how many diﬀerent ways can 3 people be arranged in a row
for a photograph if they are selected from a group of 5 people?
SOLUTION:
Since 3 people are being selected from 5 people and arranged in a speciﬁc
order, n ¼ 5, r ¼ 3. Hence, there are
5P3 ¼

EXAMPLE: In how many diﬀerent ways can a chairperson and secretary be

SOLUTION:
In this case, n ¼ 9 and r ¼ 2. Hence, there are 9P2 ways of selecting two people
to ﬁll the two positions.

CHAPTER 6

3! ¼ 7  6  5  4  3!

In the preceding examples, all the objects were diﬀerent, but when some of
the objects are identical, the second permutation rule can be used.
The number of permutations of n objects when r1 objects are identical,
r2 objects are identical, etc. is
n!
r1!r2! . . . rp!
where r1 þ r2 þ . . . þ rp ¼ n

Combinations
Sometimes when selecting objects, the order in which the objects are selected
is not important. For example, when ﬁve cards are dealt in a poker game, the
order in which you receive the cards is not important. When 5 balls are
selected in a lottery, the order in which they are selected is not important.
These situations diﬀer from permutations in which order is important and are
called combinations. A combination is a selection of objects without regard to
the order in which they are selected.

A wide variety of probability problems can be solved using the counting rules
and the probability rule.

Summary
In order to determine the number of outcomes of events, the fundamental
counting rule, the permutation rules, and the combination rule can be used.
The diﬀerence between a permutation and a combination is that for a
permutation, the order or arrangement of the objects is important. For
example, order is important in phone numbers, identiﬁcation tags, social
security numbers, license plates, etc. Order is not important when selecting
objects from a group. Many probability problems can be solved by using the
counting rules to determine the number of outcomes of the events that are
used in the problems.

Probability Sidelight
THE CLASSICAL BIRTHDAY PROBLEM
What do you think the chances are that in a classroom of 23 students, two
students would have the same birthday (day and month)? Most people would
think the probability is very low since there are 365 days in a year; however,
the probability is slightly greater than 50%! Furthermore, as the number of
students increases, the probability increases very rapidly. For example, if
there are 30 students in the room, there is a 70% chance that two students
will have the same birthday, and when there are 50 students in the room, the
probability jumps to 97%!
The problem can be solved by using permutations and the probability
rules. It must be assumed that all birthdays are equally likely. This is not
necessarily true, but it has little eﬀect on the solution. The way to solve the
problem is to ﬁnd the probability that no two people have the same birthday
and subtract it from one. Recall PðEÞ ¼ 1  PðEÞ.
For example, suppose that there were only three people in the room.
Then the probability that each would have a diﬀerent birthday would be

The reasoning here is that the ﬁrst person could be born on any day of the
year. Now if the second person would have a diﬀerent birthday, there are
CHAPTER 6

364 days left, so the probability that the second person was born on a
diﬀerent day is 364
365. The reasoning is the same for the next person. Now since
the probability is 0.992 that the three people have diﬀerent birthdays, the
probability that any two have the same birthday is 1  0.992 ¼ 0.008 or 0.8%.
In general, in a room with k people, the probability that at least two people
will have the same birthday is 1  365Pk

In a room with 23 students, then, the probability that at least two students
will have the same birthday is 1  365P23

It is interesting to note that two presidents, James K. Polk and Warren G.
Harding, were both born on November 2. Also, John Adams and Thomas
Jeﬀerson both died on July 4. What is even more unusual is that they both
died on the same day of the same year, July 4, 1826. Another President,
James Monroe, also died on July 4, but the year was 1831.

The Binomial

Introduction
Many probability problems involve assigning probabilities to the outcomes
of a probability experiment. These probabilities and the corresponding
outcomes make up a probability distribution. There are many diﬀerent
probability distributions. One special probability distribution is called the
binomial distribution. The binomial distribution has many uses such as in
gambling, in inspecting parts, and in other areas.

Discrete Probability Distributions
In mathematics, a variable can assume diﬀerent values. For example, if one
records the temperature outside every hour for a 24-hour period, temperature
is considered a variable since it assumes diﬀerent values. Variables whose
values are due to chance are called random variables. When a die is rolled, the
value of the spots on the face up occurs by chance; hence, the number of
spots on the face up on the die is considered to be a random variable. The
outcomes of a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability of each outcome
occurring is 1
6. The outcomes and their corresponding probabilities can be
written in a table, as shown, and make up what is called a probability
distribution.

A probability distribution consists of the values of a random variable and
their corresponding probabilities.
There are two kinds of probability distributions. They are discrete and
continuous. A discrete variable has a countable number of values (countable
means values of zero, one, two, three, etc.). For example, when four coins are
tossed, the outcomes for the number of heads obtained are zero, one, two,
three, and four. When a single die is rolled, the outcomes are one, two, three,
four, ﬁve, and six. These are examples of discrete variables.
A continuous variable has an inﬁnite number of values between any two
values. Continuous variables are measured. For example, temperature is a
continuous variable since the variable can assume any value between 108 and
208 or any other two temperatures or values for that matter. Height and
weight are continuous variables. Of course, we are limited by our measuring
devices and values of continuous variables are usually ‘‘rounded oﬀ.’’
EXAMPLE: Construct a discrete probability distribution for the number of
heads when three coins are tossed.
SOLUTION:
Recall that the sample space for tossing three coins is
TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, HHT, HTH, THH, and HHH.
CHAPTER 7
The Binomial Distribution

The outcomes can be arranged according to the number of heads, as
shown.
0 heads
TTT
1 head
TTH, THT, HTT
2 heads
THH, HTH, HHT
3 heads
HHH
Finally, the outcomes and corresponding probabilities can be written in a
table, as shown.

The sum of the probabilities of a probability distribution must be 1.
A discrete probability distribution can also be shown graphically by
labeling the x axis with the values of the outcomes and letting the values on
the y axis represent the probabilities for the outcomes. The graph for the
discrete probability distribution of the number of heads occurring when three
coins are tossed is shown in Figure 7-1.
There are many kinds of discrete probability distributions; however, the
distribution of the number of heads when three coins are tossed is a special
kind of distribution called a binomial distribution.
Fig. 7-1.
CHAPTER 7
The Binomial Distribution
116

A binomial distribution is obtained from a probability experiment called a
binomial experiment. The experiment must satisfy these conditions:
1. Each trial can have only two outcomes or outcomes that can be
reduced to two outcomes. The outcomes are usually considered as a
success or a failure.
2. There is a ﬁxed number of trials.
3. The outcomes of each trial are independent of each other.
4. The probability of a success must remain the same for each trial.
EXAMPLE: Explain why the probability experiment of tossing three coins is
a binomial experiment.
SOLUTION:
In order to be a binomial experiment, the probability experiment must satisfy
the four conditions explained previously.
1. There are only two outcomes for each trial, head and tail. Depending
on the situation, either heads or tails can be deﬁned as a success and
the other as a failure.
2. There is a ﬁxed number of trials. In this case, there are three trials
since three coins are tossed or one coin is tossed three times.
3. The outcomes are independent since tossing one coin does not
eﬀect the outcome of the other two tosses.
4. The probability of a success (say heads) is 1
2 and it does not change.
Hence the experiment meets the conditions of a binomial experiment.
Now consider rolling a die. Since there are six outcomes, it cannot be
considered a binomial experiment. However, it can be made into a binomial
experiment by considering the outcome of getting ﬁve spots (for example) a
success and every other outcome a failure.
In order to determine the probability of a success for a single trial of a
probability experiment, the following formula can be used.
nCx  ð pÞx  ð1  pÞnx
where n ¼ the total number of trials
x ¼ the number of successes (1, 2, 3, . . . , n)
p ¼ the probability of a success
The formula has three parts: nCx determines the number of ways a success
can occur. ( p)x is the probability of getting x successes, and (1  p)nx is the
probability of getting n  x failures.
CHAPTER 7
The Binomial Distribution
117

EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed 3 times. Find the probability of getting two
heads and a tail in any given order.
SOLUTION:
Since the coin is tossed 3 times, n ¼ 3. The probability of getting a head (suc-
cess) is 1
2, so p ¼ 1
2 and the probability of getting a tail (failure) is 1  1
2 ¼ 1
2;
x ¼ 2 since the problem asks for 2 heads. (n  x) ¼ 3  2 ¼ 1.

Notice that there were 3C2 or 3 ways to get two heads and a tail. The
answer 3

that was shown in the ﬁrst example in this chapter.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled 3 times; ﬁnd the probability of getting exactly
one ﬁve.
SOLUTION:
Since we are rolling a die 3 times, n ¼ 3. The probability of getting a 5 is 1

The probability of not getting a 5 is 1  1

In order to construct a probability distribution, the following formula

The next example shows how to use the formula.
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled 3 times. Construct a probability distribution for
the number of ﬁves that will occur.
SOLUTION:
In this case, the die is tossed 3 times, so n ¼ 3. The probability of getting a 5

The Mean and Standard Deviation for a
Binomial Distribution
Suppose you roll a die many times and record the number of threes you
obtain. Is it possible to predict ahead of time the average number of threes
you will obtain? The answer is ‘‘Yes.’’ It is called expected value or the mean
of a binomial distribution. This mean can be found by using the formula
mean () ¼ np where n is the number of times the experiment is repeated and
p is the probability of a success. The symbol for the mean is the Greek letter
 (mu).
EXAMPLE: A die is tossed 180 times and the number of threes obtained is
recorded. Find the mean or expected number of threes.
CHAPTER 7
The Binomial Distribution
121

SOLUTION:
n ¼ 180 and p ¼ 1
6 since there is one chance in 6 to get a three on each roll.
 ¼ n  p ¼ 180  1
6
¼ 30
Hence, one would expect on average 30 threes.
EXAMPLE: Twelve cards are selected from a deck and each card is replaced
before the next one is drawn. Find the average number of diamonds.
SOLUTION:
In this case, n ¼ 12 and p ¼ 13
52 or 1
4 since there are 13 diamonds and a total of
52 cards. The mean is
 ¼ n  p
¼ 12  1
4
¼ 3
Hence, on average, we would expect 3 diamonds in the 12 draws.
Statisticians are not only interested in the average of the outcomes of a
probability experiment but also in how the results of a probability experiment
vary from trial to trial. Suppose we roll a die 180 times and record the
number of threes obtained. We know that we would expect to get about 30
threes. Now what if the experiment was repeated again and again? In this
case, the number of threes obtained each time would not always be 30 but
would vary about the mean of 30. For example, we might get 28 threes one
time and 34 threes the next time, etc. How can this variability be explained?
Statisticians use a measure called the standard deviation. When the standard
deviation of a variable is large, the individual values of the variable are
spread out from the mean of the distribution. When the standard deviation of
a variable is small, the individual values of the variable are close to the mean.
The formula for the standard deviation for a binomial distribution is
standard deviation  ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
npð1  pÞ
p
. The symbol for the standard deviation is
the Greek letter  (sigma).

number of threes.

The standard deviation is 5.
Now what does this tell us?
Roughly speaking, most of the values fall within two standard deviations
of the mean.
  2 < most values <  þ 2
In the die example, we can expect most values will fall between
30  2  5 < most values < 30 þ 2  5
30  10 < most values < 30 þ 10
20 < most values < 40
In this case, if we did the experiment many times we would expect between
20 and 40 threes most of the time. This is an approximate ‘‘range of values.’’
Suppose we rolled a die 180 times and we got only 5 threes, what can be
said? It can be said that this is an unusually small number of threes. It can
happen by chance, but not very often. We might want to consider some
other possibilities. Perhaps the die is loaded or perhaps the die has been
manipulated by the person rolling it!
EXAMPLE: An archer hits the bull’s eye 80% of the time. If he shoots 100
arrows, ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of the number of bull’s eyes.
If he travels to many tournaments, ﬁnd the approximate range of values.

Note: The concept of the standard deviation is much more complex than
what is presented here. Additional information on the standard deviation will
be presented in Chapter 9. More information on the standard deviation can
also be found in all statistics textbooks.

PASCAL’S TRIANGLE
Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) was a French mathematician and philosopher. He
made many contributions to mathematics in areas of number theory, geometry,
and probability. He is credited along with Fermat for the beginnings of the
formal study of probability. He is given credit for developing a triangular array
of numbers known as Pascal’s triangle, shown here.

Each number in the triangle is the sum of the number above and to the
right of it and the number above and to the left of it.
For example, the
number 10 in the ﬁfth row is found by adding the 4 and 6 in the fourth row.
The number 15 in the sixth row is found by adding the 5 and 10 in the
previous row.
The numbers in each row represent the number of diﬀerent outcomes when
coins are tossed. For example, the numbers in row 3 are 1, 3, 3, and 1. When
3 coins are tossed, the outcomes are
THH
HTT
HTH
THT
HHH
HHT
TTH
TTT
Notice that there is only one way to get 3 heads. There are 3 diﬀerent ways
to get 2 heads and a tail. There are 3 diﬀerent ways to get two tails and a head
and there is one way to get 3 tails. The same results apply to the genders of
the children in a family with three children.
Another property of the triangle is that it represents the answer to the
number of combination of n items taking r items at a time as shown.

The numbers in the triangle have applications in other areas of
mathematics such as algebra and graph theory.
It is interesting to note that Pascal included his triangle in a book he wrote
in 1653. It wasn’t printed until 1665. It is not known if Pascal developed
the triangle on his own or heard about it from someone else; however, a
similar version of the triangle was found in a Chinese manuscript written by
Chi Shi-Kie in 1303!

Introduction
The last chapter explained the concepts of the binomial distribution. There
are many other types of commonly used discrete distributions. A few are the
multinomial distribution, the hypergeometric distribution, the Poisson
distribution, and the geometric distribution. This chapter brieﬂy explains
the basic concepts of these distributions.

The Multinomial Distribution
Recall that for a probability experiment to be binomial, two outcomes are
necessary. But if each trial of a probability experiment has more than two
outcomes, a distribution that can be used to describe the experiment is called
a multinomial distribution. In addition, there must be a ﬁxed number of
independent trials, and the probability for each success must remain the same
for each trial.
A short version of the multinomial formula for three outcomes is given
next. If X consists of events E1, E2, and E3, which have corresponding
probabilities of p1, p2, and p3 of occurring, where x1 is the number of times E1
will occur, x2 is the number of times E2 will occur, and x3 is the number of
times E3 will occur, then the probability of X is
n!
x1!x2!x3!  px1
1  px2
2  px3
3 where x1 þ x2 þ x3 ¼ n and p1 þ p2 þ p3 ¼ 1:
EXAMPLE: In a large city, 60% of the workers drive to work, 30% take the
bus, and 10% take the train. If 5 workers are selected at random, ﬁnd the
probability that 2 will drive, 2 will take the bus, and 1 will take the train.
SOLUTION:
n ¼ 5, x1 ¼ 2, x2 ¼ 2, x3 ¼ 1 and p1 ¼ 0.6, p2 ¼ 0.3, and p3 ¼ 0.1
Hence, the probability that 2 workers will drive, 2 will take the bus, and
one will take the train is

The Hypergeometric Distribution
When a probability experiment has two outcomes and the items are selected
without replacement, the hypergeometric distribution can be used to compute
the probabilities. When there are two groups of items such that there are
a items in the ﬁrst group and b items in the second group, so that the total
number of items is a þ b, the probability of selecting x items from the ﬁrst
group and n  x items from the second group is
aCx  bCnx
aþbCn
where n is the total number of items selected without replacement.
EXAMPLE: A committee of 4 people is selected at random without replace-
ment from a group of 6 men and 4 women. Find the probability that the
committee consists of 2 men and 2 women.
SOLUTION:
Since there are 6 men and 2 women, a ¼ 6, b ¼ 4 and n ¼ 6 þ 4 or 10. Since the
committee consists of 2 men and 2 women, x ¼ 2, and n  x ¼ 4  2 ¼ 2.

The Geometric Distribution
Suppose you ﬂip a coin several times. What is the probability that the ﬁrst
head appears on the third toss? In order to answer this question and other
similar probability questions, the geometric distribution can be used. The
formula for the probability that the ﬁrst success occurs on the nth trial is
ð1  pÞn1p
where p is the probability of a success and n is the trial number of the ﬁrst
success.
EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed. Find the probability that the ﬁrst head occurs
on the third toss.
SOLUTION:
The outcome is TTH; hence, n ¼ 3 and p ¼ 1
2, so the probability of getting two
tails and then a head is 1

The geometric distribution can be used to answer the question, ‘‘How long
on average will I have to wait for a success?’’
Suppose a person rolls a die until a ﬁve is obtained. The ﬁve could occur
on the ﬁrst roll (if one is lucky), on the second roll, on the third roll, etc. Now
the question is, ‘‘On average, how many rolls would it take to get the ﬁrst
ﬁve?’’ The answer is that if the probability of a success is p, then the average
or expected number of independent trials it would take to get a success is 1
p.
In the dice situation, it would take on average 1 ‚ 1
6 or 6 trials to get a ﬁve.
This is not so hard to believe since a ﬁve would occur on average one time in
every six rolls because the probability of getting a ﬁve is 1
6.
EXAMPLE: A coin is tossed until a head is obtained. On average, how many
trials would it take?
SOLUTION:
Since the probability of getting a head is 1
2, it would take 1 ‚ p trials.
1  1
2 ¼ 1  2
1 ¼ 2
On average it would take two trials.
Now suppose we ask, ‘‘On average, how many trials would it take to get
two ﬁves?’’ In this case, one ﬁve would occur on average once in the next six
trials, so the second ﬁve would occur on average once in the next six trials.
In general we would expect k successes on average in k/p trials.
EXAMPLE: If cards are selected from a deck and replaced, how many trials
would it take on average to get two clubs?
CHAPTER 8
Other Probability Distributions
137

SOLUTION:
Since there are 13 clubs in a deck of 52 cards, PðclubÞ ¼ 13
52 ¼ 1
4. The expected
number of trials for selecting two clubs would be
2
1
4 or 2  1
4 ¼ 2  4 ¼ 8
trials.
This type of problem uses what is called the negative binomial distribution,
which is a generalization of the geometric distribution.
Another interesting question one might ask is, ‘‘On average how many
rolls of a die would it take to get all the faces, one through six, on a die?’’ In
this case, the ﬁrst roll would give one of the necessary numbers, so the
probability of getting a number needed on the ﬁrst roll would be one. On the
second roll, the probability of getting a number needed would be 5
6 since there
are 5 remaining needed numbers. The average number of rolls would be
ð 1
5=6Þ or 6
5. Since two numbers have been obtained, the probability of getting
the next number would be 4
6. The average number of rolls would be ð 1
4=6Þ or 6
4.
This would continue until all numbers are obtained. So the average number
of rolls it would take to get all the numbers, one through six, would be
1 þ 6
5 þ 6
4 þ 6
3 þ 6
2 þ 6
1 ¼ 14:7. Hence on average it would take about 14.7 rolls
to get all the numbers one through six.
EXAMPLE: A children’s cereal manufacturer packages one toy space craft in
each box. If there are 4 diﬀerent toys, and they are equally distributed, ﬁnd
the average number of boxes a child would have to purchase to get all four.
SOLUTION:
The probabilities are 1, 3
4 , 2
4 , and 1
4. The average number of boxes for each
are 1
1 ,
1
ð3=4Þ ,
1
ð2=4Þ , and
1
ð1=4Þ so the total is 1 þ 4
3 þ 4

1 ¼ 8 1

mean a child on average would need to purchase 9 boxes of cereal since he
or she could not buy 1

The Poisson Distribution
Another commonly used discrete distribution is the Poisson distribution
(named after Simeon D. Poisson, 1781–1840). This distribution is used when
the variable occurs over a period of time, volume, area, etc. For example,
it can be used to describe the arrivals of airplanes at an airport, the number of
phone calls per hour for a 911 operator, the density of a certain species
of plants over a geographic region, or the number of white blood cells on a
ﬁxed area.
The probability of x successes is
ex
x!
where e is a mathematical constant 2.7183 and  is the mean or expected
value of the variable.
CHAPTER 8
Other Probability Distributions
139

Note: The computations require a scientiﬁc calculator. Also, tables for
values used in the Poisson distribution are available in some statistics
textbooks.
EXAMPLE: If there are 150 typographical errors randomly distributed in a
600-page manuscript, ﬁnd the probability that any given page has exactly two
errors.
SOLUTION:
Find the mean numbers of errors:  ¼ 150
600 ¼ 1
4 or 0.25. In other words, there is
an average of 0.25 errors per page. In this case, x ¼ 2, so the probability of
selecting a page with exactly two errors is
ex
x!
¼ ð2:7183Þ0:25  ð0:25Þ2

¼ 0:024
Hence the probability of two errors is about 2.4%.
EXAMPLE: A hotline with a toll-free number receives an average of 4 calls
per hour. For any given hour, ﬁnd the probability that it will receive exactly
6 calls.
SOLUTION:
The mean  ¼ 4 and x ¼ 6. The probability is
ex
x!
¼ ð2:7183Þ4  ð4Þ6

¼ 0:104
Hence there is about a 10.4% chance that the hotline will receive 6 calls.
EXAMPLE: A videotape has an average of two defects for every 1000 feet.
Find the probability that in a length of 2000 feet, there are 5 defects.
SOLUTION:
If there are 2 defects per 1000 feet, then the mean number of defects for 2000
feet would be 2  2 ¼ 4. In this case, x ¼ 5. The probability then is

Summary
There are many types of discrete probability distributions besides the
binomial distribution. The most common ones are the multinomial distri-
bution, the hypergeometric distribution, the geometric distribution, and the
Poisson distribution.
The multinomial distribution is an extension of the binomial distribution
and is used when there are three or more independent outcomes for a
probability experiment.
The hypergeometric distribution is used when sampling is done without
replacement. The geometric distribution is used to determine the probability
of an outcome occurring on a speciﬁc trial. It can also be used to ﬁnd the
probability of the ﬁrst occurrence of an outcome.
The Poisson distribution is used when the variable occurs over a period of
time, over a period of area or volume, etc.
In addition there are other discrete probability distributions used in
mathematics; however, these are beyond the scope of this book.

Probability Sidelight
SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT LOTTERIES
Today we are bombarded with lotteries. Almost everyone has the fantasy of
winning mega millions for a buck. Each month the prizes seem to be getting
larger and larger. Each type of lottery gives the odds and the amount of the
winnings. For some lotteries, the amount you win is based on the number of
people who play. However, the more people who play, the more chance there
will be of multiple winners.
The odds and the expected value of a lottery game can be computed using
combinations and the probability rules. For example, a lottery game in
Pennsylvania is called ‘‘Match 6 Lotto.’’ For this game, a player selects
CHAPTER 8
Other Probability Distributions
145

6 numbers from the numbers 1 to 49. If the player matches all six numbers,
the player wins a minimum of $500,000. (Note: There are other ways of
winning and if there is no winner, the prize money is held over until the next
drawing and increased a certain amount by the number of new players.)
For now, just winning the $500,000 will be considered. In order to ﬁgure the
odds, it is necessary to ﬁgure the number of winning combinations. In this
case, we are selecting without regard to order 6 numbers from 49 numbers.
Hence there are 49C6 or 13,983,816 ways to select a ticket. However, the odds
given in the lottery brochure are 1 : 4,661,272. The reason is because if you
select 6 numbers, you can have the computer select two more sets of six
numbers, giving you three chances to win. So dividing 13,983.86 by 3, you
get 4,661,272, and the odds are 1 : 4,661,272.
Now let’s make some sense of this. There are 60 seconds in a minute,
60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. So there are 60  60  24 ¼
86,400 seconds in a day. If you divide 4,661,272 by 86,400, you get app-
roximately 54 days. So selecting a winner would be like selecting a given
random second in a time period of 54 days!
What about a guaranteed method to win the lottery? It does exist. If you
purchased all possible number combinations, then you would be assured of
winning, wouldn’t you? But is it possible?
A group of investors from Melbourne, Australia, decided to try. At the
time, they decided to attempt to win a $27 million prize given by the Virginia
State Lottery. The lottery consisted of selecting 6 numbers out of a
possible 44. This means that they would have to purchase 44C6 or 7,059,052
diﬀerent tickets. At $1 a ticket, they would need to raise $7,059,052.
However, the proﬁt would be somewhere near $20 million if they won. Next
there is always a possibility of having to split the winnings with other
winners, thus reducing the proﬁt. Finally, they need to buy the 7 or so million
tickets within the 72 hour time frame. This group sent out teams, and they
were able to purchase about 5 million tickets. They did win the money
without having to split the proﬁt! Some objections were raised by the other
players (i.e., losers), but the group was eventually paid oﬀ.
By the way, it does not matter which numbers you play on the lottery since
the drawing is random and every combination has the same probability of
occurring. Some people suggest that unusual combinations such as 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 6 are better, since there is less of a chance of having to split your
winnings if you do indeed win.
So what does this all mean? I heard a mathematician sum it all up by
saying that you have the same chance of winning a big jackpot on a state
lottery, whether or not you purchase a ticket.

The Normal
Distribution
Introduction
A branch of mathematics that uses probability is called statistics. Statistics is
the branch of mathematics that uses observations and measurements called
data to analyze, summarize, make inferences, and draw conclusions based on
the data gathered. This chapter will explain some basic concepts of statistics
such as measures of average and measures of variation. Finally, the
relationship between probability and normal distribution will be explained
in the last two sections.
147

Measures of Average
There are three statistical measures that are commonly used for average.
They are the mean, median, and mode. The mean is found by adding the data
values and dividing by the number of values.
EXAMPLE: Find the mean of 18, 24, 16, 15, and 12.
SOLUTION:
Add the values: 18 þ 24 þ 16 þ 15 þ 12 ¼ 85
Divide by the number of values, 5: 85  5 ¼ 17
Hence the mean is 17.
EXAMPLE: The ages of 6 executives are 48, 56, 42, 52, 53 and 52. Find the
mean.
SOLUTION:
Add: 48 þ 56 þ 42 þ 52 þ 53 þ 52 ¼ 303
Divide by 6: 303  6 ¼ 50.5
Hence the mean age is 50.5.
The median is the middle data value if there is an odd number of data
values or the number halfway between the two data values at the center, if
there is an even number of data values, when the data values are arranged in
order.
EXAMPLE: Find the median of 18, 24, 16, 15, and 12.
SOLUTION:
Arrange the data in order: 12, 15, 16, 18, 24
Find the middle value: 12, 15, 16, 18, 24
The median is 16.
EXAMPLE: Find the median of the number of minutes 10 people had to wait
in a checkout line at a local supermarket: 3, 0, 8, 2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 1, and 0.
SOLUTION:
Arrange the data in order: 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
The middle falls between 2 and 3; hence, the median is (2 þ 3)  2 ¼ 2.5.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
148

The third measure of average is called the mode. The mode is the data value
that occurs most frequently.
EXAMPLE: Find the mode for 22, 27, 30, 42, 16, 30, and 18.
SOLUTION:
Since 30 occurs twice and more frequently than any other value, the mode
is 30.
EXAMPLE: Find the mode for 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, and 10.
SOLUTION:
In this example, 3 and 6 occur most often; hence, 3 and 6 are used as the
mode. In this case, we say that the distribution is bimodal.
EXAMPLE: Find the mode for 18, 24, 16, 15, and 12.
SOLUTION:
Since no value occurs more than any other value, there is no mode.
A distribution can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode.
Also, the mean, median, and mode for a set of values most often diﬀer
somewhat.

Measures of Variability
In addition to measures of average, statisticians are interested in measures of
variation. One measure of variability is called the range. The range is the
diﬀerence between the largest data value and the smallest data value.
EXAMPLE: Find the range for 27, 32, 18, 16, 19, and 40.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
150

SOLUTION:
Since the largest data value is 40 and the smallest data value is 16, the range is
40  16 ¼ 24.
Another measure that is also used as a measure of variability for individual
data values is called the standard deviation. This measure was also used in
Chapter 7.
The steps for computing the standard deviation for individual data
values are
Step 1:
Find the mean.
Step 2:
Subtract the mean from each value and square the diﬀerences.
Step 3:
Find the sum of the squares.
Step 4:
Divide the sum by the number of data values minus one.
Step 5:
Take the square root of the answer.
EXAMPLE: Find the standard deviation for 32, 18, 15, 24, and 11.

Step 3:
Find the sum of the squares:
144 þ 4 þ 25 þ 16 þ 81 ¼ 270
Step 4:
Divide 270 by 5  1 or 4: 270  4 ¼ 67.5
Step 5:

CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution
Recall from Chapter 7 that a continuous random variable can assume all
values between any two given values. For example, the heights of adult
males is a continuous random variable since a person’s height can be
any number. We are, however, limited by our measuring instruments.
The variable temperature is a continuous variable since temperature can
assume any numerical value between any two given numbers. Many
continuous variables can be represented by formulas and graphs or curves.
These curves represent probability distributions. In order to ﬁnd probabilities
for values of a variable, the area under the curve between two given values
is used.
One of the most often used continuous probability distributions is
called the normal probability distribution. Many variables are approxi-
mately normally distributed and can be represented by the normal distribu-
tion. It is important to realize that the normal distribution is a perfect
theoretical mathematical curve but no real-life variable is perfectly normally
distributed.
The real-life normally distributed variables can be described by the
theoretical normal distribution. This is not so unusual when you think about
it. Consider the wheel. It can be represented by the mathematically perfect
circle, but no real-life wheel is perfectly round. The mathematics of the circle,
then, is used to describe the wheel.
The normal distribution has the following properties:
1. It is bell-shaped.
2. The mean, median, and mode are at the center of the distribution.
3. It is symmetric about the mean. (This means that it is a reﬂection of
itself if a mean was placed at the center.)
4. It is continuous; i.e., there are no gaps.
5. It never touches the x axis.
6. The total area under the curve is 1 or 100%.
7. About 0.68 or 68% of the area under the curve falls within one
standard deviation on either side of the mean. (Recall that  is the
symbol for the mean and  is the symbol for the standard deviation.)
About 0.95 or 95% of the area under the curve falls within two
standard deviations of the mean.
About 1.00 or 100% of the area falls within three standard deviations
of the mean. (Note: It is somewhat less than 100%, but for simplicity,
100% will be used here.) See Figure 9-1.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
156

EXAMPLE: The mean commuting time between a person’s home and oﬃce
is 24 minutes. The standard deviation is 2 minutes. Assume the variable is
normally distributed. Find the probability that it takes a person between
24 and 28 minutes to get to work.
SOLUTION:
Draw the normal distribution and place the mean, 24, at the center. Then
place the mean plus one standard deviation (26) to the right, the mean plus
two standard deviations (28) to the right, the mean plus three standard
deviations (30) to the right, the mean minus one standard deviation (22) to
the left, the mean minus two standard deviations (20) to the left, and the
mean minus three standard deviations (18) to the left, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Using the areas shown in Figure 9-1, the area under the curve between 24
and 28 minutes is 0.341 þ 0.136 ¼ 0.477 or 47.7%. Hence the probability that
the commuter will take between 24 and 28 minutes is about 48%.

CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
157

EXAMPLE: According to a study by A.C. Neilson, children between 2 and 5
years of age watch an average of 25 hours of television per week. Assume the
variable is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation
of 2. If a child is selected at random, ﬁnd the probability that the child
watched more than 27 hours of television per week.
SOLUTION:
Draw the normal distribution curve and place 25 at the center; then place
27, 29, and 31 to the right corresponding to one, two, and three standard
deviations above the mean, and 23, 21, and 19 to the left corresponding to
one, two, and three standard deviations below the mean. Now place the
areas (percents) on the graph. See Figure 9-3.
Since we are ﬁnding the probabilities for the number of hours greater than
27, add the areas of 0.136 þ 0.023 ¼ 0.159 or 15.9%. Hence, the probability is
about 16%.
EXAMPLE: The scores on a national achievement exam are normally
distributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. If a student
who took the exam is randomly selected, ﬁnd the probability that the student
scored below 600.
SOLUTION:
Draw the normal distribution curve and place 500 at the center. Place
600, 700, and 800 to the right and 400, 300, and 200 to the left, corresponding
to one, two, and three standard deviations above and below the mean respec-
tively. Fill in the corresponding areas. See Figure 9-4.
Fig. 9-3.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
158

Since we are interested in the probability of a student scoring less than
600, add 0.341 þ 0.341 þ 0.136 þ 0.023 ¼ 0.841 ¼ 84.1%. Hence, the prob-
ability of a randomly selected student scoring below 600 is 84%.
PRACTICE
1. To qualify to attend a ﬁre academy, an applicant must take a written
exam. If the mean of all test scores is 80 and the standard deviation is
5, ﬁnd the probability that a randomly selected applicant scores
between 75 and 95. Assume the test scores are normally distributed.
2. The average time it takes an emergency service to respond to calls
in a certain municipality is 13 minutes. If the standard deviation is
3 minutes, ﬁnd the probability that for a randomly selected call, the
service takes less than 10 minutes. Assume the times are normally
distributed.
3. If the measure of systolic blood pressure is normally distributed with
a mean of 120 and a standard deviation of 10, ﬁnd the probability
that a randomly selected person will have a systolic blood pressure
below 140. Assume systolic blood pressure is normally distributed.
4. If an automobile gets an average of 25 miles per gallon on a trip and
the standard deviation is 2 miles per gallon, ﬁnd the probability that
on a randomly selected trip, the automobile will get between 21 and
29 miles per gallon. Assume the variable is normally distributed.
5. If adult Americans spent on average $60 per year for books and the
standard deviation of the variable is $5, ﬁnd the probability that a
randomly selected adult spent between $50 and $65 last year on
books. Assume the variable is normally distributed.

The Standard Normal Distribution
The normal distribution can be used as a model to solve many problems
about variables that are approximately normally distributed. Since each
variable has its own mean and standard deviation, statisticians use what is
called the standard normal distribution to solve the problems.
The standard normal distribution has all the properties of a normal dis-
tribution, but the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one. See
Figure 9-10.
Fig. 9-9.
Fig. 9-8.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
161

A
value
for
any
variable
that
is
approximately
normally
distributed can be transformed into a standard normal value by using the
following formula:
z ¼
value  mean
standard deviation
The standard normal values are called z values or z scores.
EXAMPLE: Find the corresponding z value for a value of 18 if the mean
of a variable is 12 and the standard deviation is 4.
SOLUTION:
z ¼
value  mean
standard deviation ¼ 18  12
4
¼ 6
4 ¼ 1:5
Hence the z value of 1.5 corresponds to a value of 18 for an approximately
normal distribution which has a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 4.
z values are negative for values of variables that are below the mean.
EXAMPLE: Find the corresponding z value for a value of 9 if the mean of a
variable is 12 and the standard deviation is 4.
SOLUTION:
z ¼
value  mean
standard deviation ¼ 9  12
4
¼  3
4 ¼ 0:75
Hence in this case a value of 9 is equivalent to a z value of 0.75.
In addition to ﬁnding probabilities for values that are between zero, one,
two, and three standard deviations of the mean, probabilities for other values
Fig. 9-10.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
162

can be found by converting them to z values and using the standard normal
distribution.
Areas between any two given z values under the standard normal
distribution curve can be found by using calculus instead; however, tables
for speciﬁc z values can be found in any statistics textbook. An abbreviated
table of areas is shown in Table 9-1.

CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution

This table gives the approximate cumulative areas for z values between
3 and þ3. The next three examples will show how to ﬁnd the area (and
corresponding probability in decimal form).
EXAMPLE: Find the area under the standard normal distribution curve to
the left of z ¼ 1.3.
SOLUTION:
The area is shown in Figure 9-11.
In order to ﬁnd the area under the standard normal distribution curve to
the left of any given z value, just look it up directly in Table 9-1. The area is
0.903 or 90.3%.
EXAMPLE: Find the area under the standard normal distribution curve
between z ¼ 1.6 and z ¼ 0.8.
SOLUTION:
The area is shown in Figure 9-12.
Fig. 9-11.
Fig. 9-12.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
164

To ﬁnd the area under the standard normal distribution curve between any
given two z values, look up the areas in Table 9-1 and subtract the smaller
area from the larger. In this case the area corresponding to z ¼ 1.6 is 0.055,
and the area corresponding to z ¼ 0.8 is 0.788, so the area between z ¼ 1.6
and z ¼ 0.8 is 0.788  0.055 ¼ 0.733 ¼ 73.3%. In other words, 73.3% of the
area under the standard normal distribution curve is between z ¼ 1.6 and
z ¼ 0.8.
EXAMPLE: Find the area under the standard normal distribution curve to
the right of z ¼ 0.5.
SOLUTION:
The area is shown in Figure 9-13.
To ﬁnd the area under the standard normal distribution curve to the right
of any given z value, look up the area in the table and subtract that from
1. The area corresponding to z ¼ 0.5 is 0.309. Hence 1  0.309 ¼ 0.691.
The area to the right of z ¼ 0.5 is 0.691. In other words, 69.1% of
the area under the standard normal distribution curve lies to the right of
z ¼ 0.5.
Using Table 9-1 and the formula for transforming values for variables that
are approximately normally distributed, you can ﬁnd the probabilities of
various events.
EXAMPLE: The scores on a national achievement exam are normally dis-
tributed with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. If a
student is selected at random, ﬁnd the probability that the student scored
below 680.

SOLUTION:
Find the z value for 680:
z ¼
value  mean
standard deviation ¼ 680  500
100
¼ 180
100 ¼ 1:8
Draw a ﬁgure and shade the area. See Figure 9-14.
Look up 1.8 in Table 9-1 and ﬁnd the area. It is 0.964. Hence the
probability that a randomly selected student scores below 680 is 0.964 or
96.4%.
EXAMPLE: The average life of a certain brand of automobile tires is 24,000
miles under normal driving conditions. The standard deviation is 2000 miles,
and the variable is approximately normally distributed. For a randomly
selected tire, ﬁnd the probability that it will last between 21,800 miles and
25,400 miles.
SOLUTION:
Find the two z values using the formula z ¼
value mean
standard deviation.
The z value for 21,800 miles is
z ¼ 21800  24000
2000
¼ 2200
2000 ¼ 1:1
The corresponding area from Table 9-1 for 1.1 is 0.136.
The z value for 25,400 miles is
z ¼ 25400  24000
2000
¼ 0:7
The corresponding area from Table 9-1 for 0.7 is 0.758.

CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
166

Draw and label the normal distribution curve. Shade in the area. See
Figure 9-15.
Subtract the smaller area from the larger area, 0.758  0.136 ¼ 0.622.
Hence the probability that a randomly selected tire will last between 21,800
and 25,400 miles is 0.622 or 62.2%.
EXAMPLE: The average time it takes college freshmen to complete a
reasoning skills test is 24 minutes. The standard deviation is 5 minutes. If a
randomly selected freshman takes the exam, ﬁnd the probability that he or
she takes more than 32 minutes to complete the test. Assume the variable
is normally distributed.
SOLUTION:
Find the z value for 32 minutes:
z ¼
value  mean
standard deviation ¼ 32  24

¼ 8
5 ¼ 1:6
Draw the standard normal distribution and label it as shown. Shade the
appropriate area. See Figure 9-16.

The area for z ¼ 1.6 from Table 9-1 is 0.945. Subtract the area from 1.
1.00  0.945 ¼ 0.055. Hence the probability that it will take a randomly
selected student longer than 32 minutes to complete the test is 0.055 or 5.5%.
PRACTICE
1. In order to qualify for a position, an applicant must score 86 or above
on a skills test. If the test scores are normally distributed with a mean

2. If a brisk walk at 4 miles per hour burns an average of 300 calories
per hour, ﬁnd the probability that a person will burn between 260 and
290 calories if the person walks briskly for one hour. Assume the
standard deviation is 20 and the variable is approximately normally
distributed.
3. The average count for snow per year that a city receives is 40 inches.
The standard deviation is 10 inches. Find the probability that next
year the city will get less than 53 inches. Assume the variable is
normally distributed.
4. If the average systolic blood pressure is 120 and the standard devia-
tion is 10, ﬁnd the probability that a randomly selected person will
have a blood pressure less than 108. Assume the variable is normally
distributed.
5. A survey found that on average adults watch 2.5 hours of television
per day. The standard deviation is 0.5 hours. Find the probability
that a randomly selected adult will watch between 2.2 and 2.8 hours
per day. Assume the variable is normally distributed.
ANSWERS
1. z ¼ 86  80

¼ 6
4 ¼ 1:5
The required area is shown in Figure 9-17.
The area for z ¼ 1.5 is 0.933. Since we are looking for the area
greater than z ¼ 1.5, subtract the table value from 1: 1  0.933 ¼
0.067. Hence the probability is 0.067 or 6.7%.

The required area is shown in Figure 9-18.
The area for 0.5 is 0.309. The area for 2 is 0.023. Since we are
looking for the area between z ¼ 0.5 and z ¼ 2, subtract the areas.
Hence the probability that a person burns between 260 and 290

The area for z ¼ 1.3 is 0.903. Since we are looking for an area less

The area for z ¼ 1.2 is 0.115. Since we are looking for the area less

The area for z ¼ 0.6 is 0.726. The area for z ¼ 0.6 is 0.274. Since
we are looking for the area between 0.6 and 0.6, subtract the areas:
0.726  0.274 ¼ 0.452 or 45.2%. Hence the probability that an adult
will watch between 2.2 and 2.8 hours of television per day is 0.452
or 45.2%.
Summary
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that uses probability. Statistics uses data
to analyze, summarize, make inferences, and draw conclusions from data.
There are three commonly used measures of average. They are the mean,
median, and mode. The mean is the sum of the data values divided by the
number of data values. The median is the midpoint of the data values when
they are arranged in numerical order. The mode is the data value that occurs
most often.
There are two commonly used measures of variability. They are the range
and standard deviation. The range is the diﬀerence between the smallest data
value and the largest data value. The standard deviation is the square root of
the average of the squares of the diﬀerences of each value from the mean.
Many variables are approximately normally distributed and the standard
normal distribution can be used to ﬁnd probabilities for various situations
involving values of these variables.
The standard normal distribution is a continuous, bell-shaped curve such
that the mean, median, and mode are at its center. It is also symmetrical
about the mean. The mean is equal to zero and the standard deviation is
equal to one. About 68% of the area under the standard normal distribution
lies within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% within two
standard deviations, and about 100% within three standard deviations of the
mean.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
The applications of the normal distribution are many and varied. It is used
in astronomy, biology, business, education, medicine, engineering, psychol-
ogy, and many other areas. The development of the concepts of the normal
distribution is quite interesting.
It is believed that the ﬁrst mathematician to discover some of the concepts
associated with the normal distribution was the English mathematician,
Abraham de Moivre (1667–1754). He was born in France, but moved to
England because of the French government’s restrictions on religion and civil
liberties. He supported himself by becoming a private tutor in mathematics.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
174

He studied the probability of tossing coins, rolling dice, and other forms of
gambling. In 1716, he wrote a book on gambling entitled The Doctrine of
Chances. In addition to his tutoring, wealthy patrons came to him to ﬁnd out
what the payoﬀamount should be for various gambling games. He made
many contributions to mathematics. In probability, he tossed a large number
of coins many times and recorded the number of heads that resulted on each
trial. He found that approximately 68% of the results fell within a predictable
distance (now called the standard deviation) on either side of the mean and
that 95% of the results fell within two predictable distances on either side of
the mean. In addition, he noticed that the shape of the distribution was bell-
shaped, and he derived the equation for the normal curve in 1733, but his
work in this area of mathematics went relatively unnoticed for a long period
of time.
In 1781, a French mathematician, Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) was
studying the gender of infants attempting to prove that the number of males
born was slightly more than the number of females born. (This fact has been
veriﬁed today.) Laplace noticed that the distribution of male births was also
bell-shaped and that the outcomes followed a particular pattern. Laplace also
developed a formula for the normal distribution, and it is thought that he was
unaware of de Moivre’s earlier work.
About 30 years later in 1809, a German mathematician, Carl Friedrich
Gauss (1777–1855) deduced that the errors in the measurements of the
planets due to imperfections in the lenses in telescopes and the human eye
were approximately bell-shaped. The theory was called Gauss’ Law of Error.
Gauss developed a complex measure of variation for the data and also an
equation for the normal distribution curve. The curve is sometimes called the
Gaussian distribution in his honor. In addition to mathematics, Gauss also
made many contributions to astronomy.
During the 1800s at least seven diﬀerent measures of variation were used
to describe distributions. It wasn’t until 1893 that the statistician Karl
Pearson coined the term ‘‘standard deviation.’’
Around 1830, researchers began to notice that the normal distribution
could be used to describe other phenomena. For example, in 1846 Adolphe
Quetelet (1796–1874) began to measure the chest sizes of Scottish soldiers.
He was trying to develop the concept of the ‘‘average man,’’ and found that
the normal distribution curve was applicable to these measurements.
Incidentally, Quetelet also developed the concept of body mass index,
which is still used today.
A German experimental psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus (1855–1913)
found that the normal distribution was applicable to measures of intelligence
and memorization in humans.
CHAPTER 9
The Normal Distribution
175

Sir Francis Galton in 1889 invented a device that he called a ‘‘Quincunx.’’
This device dropped beads through a series of pegs into slots whose heights
resulted in a bell-shaped graph. It wasn’t until 1924 that Karl Pearson
found that de Moivre had discovered the formula for the normal distribution
curve long before Laplace or Gauss.

Simulation
Introduction
Instead of studying actual situations that sometimes might be too costly, too
dangerous, or too time consuming, researchers create similar situations using
random devices so that they are less expensive, less dangerous or less time
consuming. For example, pilots use ﬂight simulators to practice on before
they actually ﬂy a real plane. Many video games use the computer to simulate
real life sports situations such as baseball, football, or hockey.
Simulation techniques date back to ancient times when the game of chess
was invented to simulate warfare. Modern techniques date to the mid-1940s
when two physicists, John von Neuman and Stanislaw Ulam developed si-
mulation techniques to study the behavior of neutrons in the design of atomic
reactors.
Mathematical simulation techniques use random number devices along
with probability to create conditions similar to those found in real life.

Random devices are items such as dice, coins, and computers or calculators.
These devices generate what are called random numbers. For example, when a
fair die is rolled, it generates the numbers one through six randomly. This
means that the outcomes occur by chance and each outcome has the same
probability of occurring.
Computers have played an important role in simulation since they can
generate random numbers, perform experiments, and tally the results much
faster than humans can. In this chapter, the concepts of simulation will be
explained by using dice or coins.
The Monte Carlo Method
The Monte Carlo Method of simulation uses random numbers. The steps are
Step 1:
List all possible outcomes of the experiment.
Step 2:
Determine the probability of each outcome.
Step 3:
Set up a correspondence between the outcomes of the experiment
and random numbers.
Step 4:
Generate the random numbers (i.e., roll the dice, toss the coin,
etc.)
Step 5:
Repeat the experiment and tally the outcomes.
Step 6:
Compute any statistics and state the conclusions.
If an experiment involves two outcomes and each has a probability of 1
2,
a coin can be tossed. A head would represent one outcome and a tail the
other outcome. If a die is rolled, an even number could represent one
outcome and an odd number could represent the other outcome. If an
experiment involves ﬁve outcomes, each with a probability of 1
5, a die can be
rolled. The numbers one through ﬁve would represent the outcomes. If a six
is rolled, it is ignored.
For experiments with more than six outcomes, other devices can be used.
For example, there are dice for games that have 5 sides, 8 sides, 10 sides,
etc. (Again, the best device to use is a random number generator such as a
computer or calculator or even a table of random numbers.)
EXAMPLE: Simulate the genders of a family with four children.
SOLUTION:
Four coins can be tossed. A head represents a male and a tail represents
a female. For example, the outcome HTHH represents 3 boys and one girl.
CHAPTER 10
Simulation
178

Perform the experiment 10 times to represent the genders of the children of 10
families. (Note: The probability of a male or a female birth is not exactly 1
2;
however, it is close enough for this situation.) The results are shown next.

In this case, there was one family with no boys and one family with four

More complicated problems can be simulated as shown next.
EXAMPLE: Suppose a prize is given under a bottle cap of a soda; however,
only one in ﬁve bottle caps has the prize. Find the average number of bottles
that would have to be purchased to win the prize. Use 20 trials.
CHAPTER 10
Simulation
179

SOLUTION:
A die can be rolled until a certain arbitrary number, say 3, appears. Since the
probability of getting a winner is 1
5, the number of rolls will be tallied. The
experiment can be done 20 times. (In general, the more times the experiment
is performed, the better the approximation will be.) In this case, if a six is
rolled, it is not counted. The results are shown next.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability problem based on a game played
on the television show ‘‘Let’s Make A Deal,’’ hosted by Monty Hall.
Here’s how it works. You are a contestant on a game show, and you are to
select one of three doors. A valuable prize is behind one door, and no prizes
are behind the other two doors. After you choose a door, the game show host
opens one of the two doors that you did not select. The game show host
knows which door contains the prize and always opens a door with no prize
behind it. Then the host asks you if you would like to keep the door you
originally selected or switch to the other unopened door. The question is ‘‘Do
you have a better chance of winning the valuable prize if you switch or does it
make no diﬀerence?’’
At ﬁrst glance, it looks as if it does not matter whether or not you
switch since there are two doors and only one has the prize behind it. So
the probability of winning is
1
2 whether or not you switch. This type
of reasoning is incorrect since it is actually better if you switch doors!
Here’s why.
Assume you select door A. If the prize is behind door C, the host opens
door B, so if you switch, you win. If the prize is behind door B, the host
opens door C, so if you switch, you win. If the prize is behind door A and no
matter what door the host opens, if you switch, you lose. So by always
switching, you have a 2
3 chance of winning and a 1
3 chance of losing. If you
don’t switch, you will have only a 1
3 chance of winning no matter what. You
can apply the same reasoning if you select door B or door C. If you always
switch, the probability of winning is 2
3. If you don’t switch, the probability of
winning is 1
3.
You can simulate the game by using three cards, say an ace and two kings.
Consider the ace the prize. Turn your back and have a friend arrange the
cards face down on a table. Then select a card. Have your friend turn over
one of the other cards, not the ace, of course. Then switch cards and see
whether or not you win. Keep track of the results for 10, 20, or 30 plays.
Repeat the game but this time, don’t switch, and keep track of how many
times you win. Compare the results!

1. A basketball player makes 2
3 of his foul shots. If he has two shots, ﬁnd
the probability that he will make at least one basket.
2. In a certain prize give away, you must spell the word ‘‘BIG’’ to win.
Sixty percent of the tickets have a B, 20% of the tickets have an I,
and 20% of the tickets have a G. If a person buys 5 tickets, ﬁnd the
probability that the person will win a prize.

while Paul has a 50% accuracy rate. The ﬁrst person who hits the
target wins. If Paul always shoots ﬁrst, ﬁnd the probability that
he wins.
4. A person has 5 neckties and randomly selects one tie each work day.
In a given work week of 5 days, ﬁnd the probability that the person
will wear the same tie two or more days a week.
5. Toss three dice. Find the probability of getting exactly two numbers
that are the same (doubles).
ANSWERS
1. You will roll 2 dice. A success is getting a 1, 2, 3, or 4, and a miss
is getting a 5 or 6. Perform the experiment 50 times, tally the
successes, and divide by 50 to get the probability.
2. You can roll a dice 5 times or 5 dice at one time. Count 1, 2, or 3 as
a B, count 4 as an I, and count 5 as a G. If you get a six, roll the
die over. Perform 50 experiments. Tally the wins (i.e., every time you
spell BIG); then divide by 50 to get the probability.
3. Roll a die. For the ﬁrst shooter, use 1, 2, and 3 as a hit and 4, 5, and 6
as a miss. For the second shooter, use 1, 2, 3, and 4 as a hit and 5 as
a miss. Ignore any sixes.
4. Use the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on a die to represent the ties.
Ignore any sixes. Roll the die ﬁve times for each week and count
any time you get the same number twice as selecting the same tie
twice.
5. Roll three dice and count the doubles.

Summary
Random numbers can be used to simulate many real life situations. The basic
method of simulation is the Monte Carlo method. The purpose of simulation
is to duplicate situations that are too dangerous, too costly, or too time
consuming to study in real life. Most simulation techniques are done on
a computer. Computers enable the person to generate random numbers, tally
the results, and perform any necessary computation.

PROBABILITY IN OUR DAILY LIVES
People engage in all sorts of gambles, not just betting money at a casino
or purchasing a lottery ticket. People also bet their lives by engaging in
unhealthy activities such as smoking, drinking, using drugs, and exceeding
the speed limit when driving. A lot of people don’t seem to care about the
risks involved in these activities, or they don’t understand the concepts of
probability.
Statisticians (called actuaries) who work for insurance companies can
calculate the probabilities of dying from certain causes. For example, based
on the population of the United States, the risks of dying from various causes
are shown here.
Motor vehicle accident
1 in 7000
Shot with a gun
1 in 10,000
Crossing a street
1 in 60,000
Struck by lightning
1 in 3,000,000
Shark attack
1 in 300,000,000
The risks of dying from various diseases are shown here.
Heart attack
1 in 400
Cancer
1 in 600
Stroke
1 in 2000
As you can see, the probability of dying from a disease is much higher than
the probability of dying from an accident.
CHAPTER 10
Simulation
185

Another thing that people tend to do is fear situations or events that
have a relatively small chance of happening and overlook situations or events
that have a higher chance of happening. For example, James Walsh in his
book entitled How Risk Aﬀects Your Everyday Life states that if a person
is 20% overweight, the loss of life expectancy is 900 days (about 3 years)
whereas the loss of life expectancy from exposure to radiation emitted by
nuclear power plants is 0.02 days. So you can see it is much more unhealthy
being 20% overweight than it is living close to a nuclear power plant. One
of the reasons for this phenomenon is that the media tends to sensationalize
certain news events such as ﬂoods, hurricanes, and tornadoes and down-
plays other less newsworthy events such as smoking, drinking, and being
overweight.
In summary, then, when you make a decision or plan a course of action
based on probability, get the facts from a reliable source, weigh the
consequences of each choice of action, and then make your decision. Be sure
to consider as many alternatives as you can.

Game Theory
Introduction
Probability is used in what is called game theory. Game theory was developed
by John von Neumann and is a mathematical analysis of games. In many
cases, game theory uses probability. In a broad sense, game theory can be
applied to sports such as football and baseball, video games, board games,
gambling games, investment situations, and even warfare.
Two-Person Games
A simpliﬁed deﬁnition of a game is that it is a contest between two players
that consists of rules on how to play and how to determine the winner.
A game also consists of a payoﬀ. A payoﬀis a reward for winning the game.
In many cases it is money, but it could be points or even just the satisfaction
of winning.
Most games consist of strategies. A strategy is a rule that determines a
player’s move or moves in order to win the game or maximize the player’s

payoﬀ. When a game consists of the loser paying the winner, it is called a zero
sum game. This means that the sum of the payoﬀs is zero. For example, if a
person loses a game and that person pays the winner $5, the loser’s payoﬀ
is $5 and the winner’s payoﬀis þ$5. Hence the sum of the payoﬀis
$5 þ $5 ¼ $0.
Consider a simple game in which there are only two players and each
player can make only a ﬁnite number of moves. Both players make a move
simultaneously and the outcome or payoﬀis determined by the pair of
moves. An example of such a game is called, ‘‘rock-paper-scissors.’’ Here
each player places one hand behind his or her back, and at a given signal,
brings his or her hand out with either a ﬁst, symbolizing ‘‘rock,’’ two ﬁngers
out, symbolizing ‘‘scissors,’’ or all ﬁve ﬁngers out symbolizing ‘‘paper.’’ In
this game, scissors cut paper, so scissors win. A rock breaks scissors, so the
rock wins, and paper covers rock, so paper wins. Rock–rock, scissors–
scissors, and paper–paper are ties and neither person wins. Now suppose
there are two players, say Player A and Player B, and they decide to play for
$1. The game can be symbolized by a rectangular array of numbers called
a payoﬀtable, where the rows represent Player A’s moves and the columns
represent Player B’s moves. If Player A wins, he gets $1 from Player B. If
Player B wins, Player A pays him $1, represented by $1. The payoﬀtable
for the game is
Player B’s Moves:

Rock

This game can also be represented by a tree diagram, as shown in
Figure 11-1.
Now consider a second game. Each player has two cards. One card is
black on one side, and the other card is white on one side. The backs of all
four cards are the same, so when a card is placed face down on a table,
the color on the opposite side cannot be seen until it is turned over. Both
players select a card and place it on the table face down; then they turn the
cards over. If the result is two black cards, Player A wins $5. If the result
is two white cards, Player A wins $1. If the results are one black card and

Game Theory
188

one white card, Player B wins $2.00. A payoﬀtable for the game would
look like this:
Player B’s Card:
Player A’s Card:
Black
White
Black

$2

The tree diagram for the game is shown in Figure 11-2.
Player A thinks, ‘‘What about a strategy? I will play my black card and
hope Player B plays her black card, and I will win $5. But maybe Player B
knows this and she will play her white card, and I will lose $2. So, I better

Fig. 11-2.
CHAPTER 11
Game Theory
189

play my white card and hope Player B plays her white card, and I will win $1.
But she might realize this and play her black card! What should I do?’’
In this case, Player A decides that he should play his black card some of
the time and his white card some of the time. But how often should he play
his black card?
This is where probability theory can be used to solve Player A’s dilemma.
Let p ¼ the probability of playing a black card on each turn; then 1  p ¼ the
probability of playing a white card on each turn. If Player B plays her black
card, Player A’s expected proﬁt is $5  p  $2(1  p). If Player B plays her white
card, Player A’s expected proﬁt is $2p þ $1(1  p), as shown in the table.

$2(1  p)
$1(1  p)
$5p  $2(1  p)
$2p þ $1(1  p)
Now in order to plan a strategy so that Player B cannot outthink Player A,
the two expressions should be equal. Hence,
5p  2ð1  pÞ ¼ 2p þ 1ð1  pÞ
Using algebra, we can solve for p:
5p  2ð1  pÞ ¼ 2p þ 1ð1  pÞ
5p  2 þ 2p ¼ 2p þ 1  p
7p  2 ¼ 3p þ 1
7p þ 3p  2 ¼ 3p þ 3p þ 1

10p ¼ 3
10p
10 ¼ 3

p ¼ 3

CHAPTER 11

Hence, Player A should play his black card 3
10 of the time and his white
card 7
10 of the time. His expected gain, no matter what Player B does, when
p ¼ 3

On average, Player A will win $0.10 per game no matter what Player B does.
Now Player B decides she better ﬁgure her expected loss no matter what
Player A does. Using similar reasoning, the table will look like this when the
probability that Player B plays her black card is s, and her white card with
probability 1  s.
Player B’s Card:

$2(s) þ $1(1  s)
Solving for s when both expressions are equal, we get:
5s  2ð1  sÞ ¼ 2ðsÞ þ 1ð1  sÞ
5s  2 þ 2s ¼ 2s þ 1  s
7s  2 ¼ 3s þ 1
7s þ 3s  2 ¼ 3s þ 3s þ 1

10s ¼ 3
10s
10 ¼ 3

s ¼ 3

CHAPTER 11

So Player B should play her black card 3

of the time. Player B’s payout when s ¼ 3

Hence the maximum amount that Player B will lose on average is $0.10
per game no matter what Player A does.
When both players use their strategy, the results can be shown by
combining the two tree diagrams and calculating Player A’s expected gain
as shown in Figure 11-3.
Hence, Player A’s expected gain is

is 0, then the game is said to be fair.

CHAPTER 11
Game Theory
192

The optimal strategy for Player A is to play the black card 3
10 of the time
and the white card 7
10 of the time. The optimal strategy for Player B is the
same in this case.
The optimal strategy for Player A is deﬁned as a strategy that can
guarantee him an average payoﬀof V(the value of the game) no matter what
strategy Player B uses. The optimal strategy for Player B is deﬁned as a
strategy that prevents Player A from obtaining an average payoﬀgreater
than V(the value of the game) no matter what strategy Player A uses.
Note: When a player selects one strategy some of the time and another
strategy at other times, it is called a mixed strategy, as opposed to using the
same strategy all of the time. When the same strategy is used all of the time,
it is called a pure strategy.
EXAMPLE: Two generals, A and B, decide to play a game. General A can
attack General B’s city either by land or by sea. General B can defend either
by land or sea. They agree on the following payoﬀ.

Find the optimal strategy for each player and the value of the game.
SOLUTION:
Let p ¼ probability of attacking by land and 1  p ¼ the probability of attack-
ing by sea.
CHAPTER 11
Game Theory
193

General A’s expected payoﬀif he attacks and General B defends by land is
$25p þ $90(1  p) and if General B defends by sea is $75p  $50(1  p).
Equating the two and solving for p, we get
25p þ 90ð1  pÞ ¼ 75p  50ð1  pÞ
25p þ 90  90p ¼ 75p  50 þ 50p
115p þ 90 ¼ 125p  50
115p  125p þ 90 ¼ 125p  125p  50

240p ¼ 140
240p
240 ¼ 140

Hence General A should attack by land 7

Now let us ﬁgure out General B’s strategy.

probability of 1  s. Hence,

25s þ 75ð1  sÞ ¼ 90s  50ð1  sÞ
25s þ 75  75s ¼ 90s  50 þ 50s

Hence, General B should defend by land with a probability of 25

sea with a probability of 23

in Figure 11-4.
A payoﬀtable can also consist of probabilities. This type of problem is
shown in the next example.
Fig. 11-4.

EXAMPLE: Player A and Player B decided to play one-on-one basketball.
Player A can take either a long shot or a lay-up shot. Player B can defend
against either one. The payoﬀtable shows the probabilities of a successful

value of the game.

SOLUTION:
Let p be the probability of shooting a long shot and 1  p the probability of
shooting a lay-up shot. Then the probability of making a shot against a long
shot defense is 0.1p þ 0.7(1  p) and against a lay-up defense is 0.4p þ
0.2(1  p). Equating and solving for p we get
0:1p þ 0:7ð1  pÞ ¼ 0:4p þ 0:2ð1  pÞ

Summary
Game theory uses mathematics to analyze games. These games can range
from simple board games to warfare. A game can be considered a contest
between two players and consists of rules on how to play the game and how
to determine the winner. In this chapter, only two-player, zero sum games
were explained. A payoﬀtable is used to determine how much a person wins
or loses. Payoﬀtables can also consist of probabilities.
A strategy is a rule that determines a player’s move or moves in order to
win the game or maximize the player’s payoﬀ. An optimal strategy is the
strategy that a player uses that will guarantee him or her an average payoﬀof
a certain amount no matter what the other player does. An optimal strategy
for a player could also be one that will prevent the other player from
obtaining an average payoﬀgreater that a certain amount. This amount is
called the value of the game. If the value of the game is zero, then the game
is fair.

COMPUTERS AND GAME THEORY
Computers have been used to analyze games, most notably the game of
chess. Experts have written programs enabling computers to play humans.
Matches between chess champion Garry Kasparov and the computer named
Deep Blue, as well as his matches against the newer computer X3D Fritz,
have received universal notoriety.
Computers cannot think, but they can make billions of calculations per
second. What the computer does when it is its turn to make a chess move is to
generate a tree of moves. Each player has about 20 choices of a move per
turn. Based on these choices, the computer calculates the possible moves of
its human opponent; then it moves based on the human’s possible moves.
With each move, the computer evaluates the position of the chess pieces on
the board at that time. Each chess piece is assigned a value based on its
importance. For example, a pawn is worth one point, a knight is worth three
points, a rook is worth ﬁve points, and a queen is worth nine points. The
computer then works backwards, assuming its human opponent will make
his best move. This process is repeated after each human move. It is not pos-
sible for the computer to make trees for an entire game since it has been
estimated that there are 101050 possible chess moves. By looking ahead several
moves, the computer can play a fairly decent game. Some programs can
beat almost all human opponents. (Chess champions excluded, of course!)
CHAPTER 11
Game Theory
208

As the power of the computer increases, the more trees the computer will
be able to evaluate within a speciﬁc time period. Also, computers have
been able to be programmed to remember previous games, thus helping in its
analysis of the trees. Many people think that in the future, a computer will be
built that will be able to defeat all human players.

CHAPTER
Actuarial Science
Introduction
An actuary is a person who uses mathematics to analyze risks in order to
determine insurance rates, investment strategies, and other situations involving
future payouts. Most actuaries work for insurance companies; however,
some work for the United States government in the Social Security and
Medicare programs and others as consultants to business and ﬁnancial
institutions. The main function of an actuary is to determine premiums for
life and health insurance policies and retirement accounts, as well as pre-
miums for ﬂood insurance, mine subsidence, etc. Actuarial science involves
several areas of mathematics, including calculus. However, much of actuarial
science is based on probability.

Mortality Tables
Insurance companies collect data on various risk situations, such as life
expectancy, automobile accidents, hurricane damages, etc. The information
can be summarized in table form. One such table is called a mortality table or
a period life table. You can ﬁnd one at the end of this chapter. The mortality
table used here is from the Social Security Administration and shows the ages
for males and females, the probability of dying at a speciﬁc age, the number
of males and females surviving during a speciﬁc year of their lives, and life
expectancies for a given age. The following examples show how to use the
mortality table.
EXAMPLE: Find the probability of a female dying during her 30th year.
SOLUTION:
Based on the mortality table, there are 98,428 females out of 100,000 alive at
the beginning of year 30 and 98,366 females living at the beginning of year 31,
so to ﬁnd the number of females who have died during year 30, subtract
98,428  98,366 ¼ 62. Therefore, 62 out of 98,428 people have died. Next
ﬁnd the probability.
P(dying at age 30Þ ¼
number who died during the year
number who were alive at the beginning of year 30
¼
62
98,428  0:00063
(Notice that under the column labeled ‘‘Death probability,’’ the ﬁgure
given for 30-year-old females is 0.000624. The discrepancy is probably due to
the fact that computations for this column were based on sample sizes larger
than 100,000 or perhaps it was due to rounding.)
EXAMPLE: On average, how long can one expect a female who is 30 years
old to live?
SOLUTION:
Looking at the table for 30-year-old females, the last column shows a life
expectancy of 50.43 years. This means that at age 30, a female can expect
to live on average another 50.43 years or to age (30 þ 50.43) ¼ 80.43 years.
Interpreting this means that the average of the life expectancies of females
age 30 is 50.43 years. Remember this is an average, not a guarantee.
CHAPTER 12
Actuarial Science
211

EXAMPLE: Find the death rate for 30-year-old males.
SOLUTION:
From the table for a 30-year-old man, there are 97,129 out of 100,000
living, and for age 31, there are 96,999 males living; hence, 97,12996,999,
or 130 males died during their 30th year of life. Now the death rate is
130 males out of a total of 97,129 or
P(dying at 30) ¼
number who died during the year
number living at the beginning of year 30
¼
130
97,129  0:00133
Notice that the table gives a value of 0.001396 under the column ‘‘Death
probability.’’ The reason for this discrepancy is probably due to the fact that
samples larger than 100,000 males were used in the calculation, or perhaps
it is due to rounding.
EXAMPLE: What is the probability that a male age 25 will die before age 60?
SOLUTION:
The number of males living at age 25 is 97,760 out of 100,000, and the num-
ber of males living at age 60 is 84,682. So to ﬁnd the number of males who
died, subtract the two numbers: 97,760  84,682 ¼ 13,078. That is, 13,078
males died between age 25 and age 60. Next, ﬁnd the probability.
P ¼
number who died
number living at the beginning of year 25
¼ 13,078
97,760  0:134
In other words, there is about a 13% chance that a male age 25 will die
before age 60.
EXAMPLE: What is the probability that a female who is 40 will live to the
age of 60?
SOLUTION:
At age 40 there are 97,512 females out of 100,000 alive. At age 70, there are
79,880 females alive. Hence,
CHAPTER 12
Actuarial Science
212

P(live to 70Þ ¼ number living at 70
number living at 40
¼ 79,880
97,512 ¼ 0:819
In other words, the probability of a 40-year-old female living to age 70 is
0.819, or about 82%.
EXAMPLE: How many males age 21 will die before age 65?
SOLUTION:
At age 21, there are 98,307 males out of 100,000 alive. At age 65, there are
78,410 males alive. Therefore, 98,307  78,410 ¼ 19,897 males have died
between the ages of 21 and 65. This is out of 98,307 who made it to age 21.

1. Find the probability that a male will die at age 48.
2. On average, how many more years can a female who is age 56 expect
to live?
3. Find the death rate for a 63-year-old female.
4. What is the probability that a male age 43 will live to age 65?
5. What is the probability that a 25-year-old female will live to age 60?
6. Find the probability that a male will live to 21 years of age.
7. How many years longer can a female age 20 expect to live than a male
age 20?
8. About how many 2-year-old males will die before they reach 10 years
old?
9. What is the probability that a female age 16 will live to age 50?
10. Find the probability that a male will live to age 65.
ANSWERS
1. From the table, we see the probability that a male age 48 will die is
0.004859.
Alternate Solution: There are 92,790 males out of 100,000 males
age
48,
and
there
are
92,339
males
alive
at
age
49.
So,
92,790  92,339 ¼ 451 males died at age 48.
CHAPTER 12

2. From the table, a 56-year-old female can expect to live another 26.30
years.
3. From the table, the death rate for a 63-year-old female is 0.010598.
Alternate Solution: At age 63, there are 88,518 out of 100,000 females
alive, and there are 87,580 females alive at age 64. Hence,
88,518  87,580 ¼ 938 females died at age 63; then
Pðdying at age 63Þ ¼ number who died at age 63
number alive at age 63
¼
938
88,518 ¼ 0:010597:
4. At age 43, there are 94,629 males out of 100,000 alive. At age 65, there
are 78,410 males alive, so
Pðliving to 65Þ ¼ number alive at 65
number alive at 43 ¼ 78,410
94,629 ¼ 0:8286 or 82:86%
5. At 25, there are 98,689 females out of 100,000 alive. At age 60, there
are 90,867 females alive; hence,
Pðliving to age 60Þ ¼ number alive at 60
number alive at 25 ¼ 90,867
98,689  0:921 or 92:1%
6. At age 21, there are 98,307 out of 100,000 males alive; hence,
P(a male will live to age 21Þ ¼ number alive at 21
total born
¼ 98,307
100,000 ¼ 0:98307
7. At age 20, a female can expect to live 60.16 more years. At age 20, a
male can expect to live 55.04 more years. Hence, 60.16  55.04 ¼ 5.12.
A female can expect to live 5.12 years longer than a male if both are
age 20.
8. At age 2, there are 99,187 males out of 100,000 alive. At age 10, there
are 99,013 males alive; hence, 99,187  99,013 ¼ 174 males age 2 who
will die before age 10. This is out of 99,187 males alive at age 2.
9. There are 99,084 females out of 100,000 alive at age 16. There are
95,464 females alive at age 50. Hence,
CHAPTER 12
Actuarial Science
214

P(living to age 50Þ ¼ number alive at 50
number alive at 16 ¼ 95,464
99,084 ¼ 0:963 ¼ 96:3%
10. There are 78,410 males out of 100,000 alive at age 65; hence,
Pðliving to age 65) ¼ number alive at 65
100,000
¼ 78,410
100,000 ¼ 0:7841 ¼ 78:41%
Life Insurance Policies
There are many diﬀerent types of life insurance policies. A straight life
insurance policy requires that you make payments for your entire life.
Then when you die, your beneﬁciary is paid the face value of the policy.
A beneﬁciary is a person designated to receive the money from an insurance
policy.
Another type of policy is a term policy. Here the insured pays a certain
premium for twenty years. If the person dies during the 20-year period, his or
her beneﬁciary receives the value of the policy. If the person lives beyond the
twenty-year period, he or she receives nothing. This kind of insurance has low
premiums, especially for younger people since the probability of them dying
is relative small.
Another type of life insurance policy is called an endowment policy. In this
case, if a person purchases a 20-year endowment policy and lives past 20
years, the insurance company will pay the face value of the policy to the
insured. Naturally, the premiums for this kind of policy are much higher than
those for a term policy.
The tables show the approximate premiums for a $100,000 20-year term
policy. These are based on very healthy individuals. Insurance companies
adjust the premiums for people with health problems.

EXAMPLE: If a 21-year-old healthy female takes a 20-year term life
insurance policy for $100,000, how much would she pay in premiums if she
lived at least 20 years?
SOLUTION:
Her premium would be $96 per year, so she would pay $96  20 years ¼ $1920.
EXAMPLE: If a healthy 30-year-old male takes a 20-year term life insurance
policy for $25,000, how much would he pay if he lives for at least 20 years?
SOLUTION:
The premium for a healthy 30-year-old male for a 20-year term policy of
$100,000 is $147. So for a $25,000 policy, the premium can be found by
making a ratio equal to
face value of insurance policy
$100,000
and multiplying it by the premium:
$25,000
$100,000  $147 ¼ $36:75: Then multiply by 20 years:
$36:75  20 ¼ $735:
EXAMPLE: If the life insurance company insures 100 healthy females age
40 for 20-year, $100,000 term life insurance policies, ﬁnd the approximate
amount the company will have to pay out.
SOLUTION:
First use the mortality table to ﬁnd the probability that a female aged 40
will die before she reaches age 60. At age 40, there are 97,512 females out
of 100,000 living. At age 60, there are 90,867 living. So, in twenty years,
97,512  90,867 ¼ 6645 have died during the 20-year period. Hence, the prob-
ability of dying is
P(dying) ¼ number who have died
number living at age 40 ¼ 6645
97,512 ¼ 0:068
CHAPTER 12
Actuarial Science
216

Hence about 6.8 or 7% (rounded) of the females have died during the
20-year period. If the company has insured 100 females, then about
7%  100 ¼ 7 will die in the 20-year period. The company will have to pay
out 7  $100,000 ¼ $700,000 in the 20-year period.
Notice that knowing this information, the insurance company can estimate
its costs (overhead) and calculate premiums to determine its proﬁt.
Another statistic that insurance companies use is called the median future
lifetime of a group of individuals at a given age. The median future lifetime
for people living at a certain age is the number of years that approximately
one-half of those individuals will still be alive.
EXAMPLE: Find the median future lifetime for a male who is 30 years old.
SOLUTION:
Using the mortality table, ﬁnd the number of males living at age 30. It is
97,129 out of 100,000. Then divide this number by 2 to get 97,129 … 2 ¼
48,564.5. Next, using the closest value, ﬁnd the age of the males that
corresponds to 48,564.5. That is 48,514. The age is 78. In other words, at
age 78, about one-half of the males are still living. Subtract 78  30 ¼ 48.
The median future lifetime of a 30-year-old male is 48 years.
PRACTICE
1. If a healthy 40-year-old male takes a 20-year, $100,000 term life
insurance policy, how much would he pay in premiums if he lived
to age 60?
2. If a healthy female age 21 takes a 20-year, $40,000 term life insurance
policy, about how much would she pay in premiums if she lived to age
41?
3. If a life insurance company insures 100 healthy females age 35 for
$50,000, 20-year term policies, how much would they expect to
pay out?
4. Find the median future lifetime of a female who is age 35.
5. Find the median future lifetime of a male who is age 50.

3. At age 35, there are 98,067 females out of 100,000 alive. At age 55,
there are 93,672 females alive. Therefore, 98,067  93,672 ¼ 4395
females will die.
P(dying in 20 yearsÞ ¼ number who will die

5. At age 50, there are 91,865 males out of 100,000 alive; 91,865 … 2 ¼
45,932.5. At age 79, there are 45,459 males alive. Hence, the median
future lifetime of a male age 50 is 79  50 ¼ 29 years.
Summary
This chapter introduces some of the concepts used in actuarial science. An
actuary is a person who uses mathematics in order to determine insurance
rates, investment strategies, retirement accounts and other situations
involving future payouts.
Actuaries use mortality tables to determine the probabilities of people
living to certain ages. A mortality table shows the number of people out
of 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 living at certain ages. It can also show the
probability of dying at any given age. Barring unforeseen catastrophic events
such as wars, plagues, and such, the number of people dying at a speciﬁc age
is relatively constant for certain groups of people.
In addition to life insurance, mortality tables are used in other areas. Some
of these include Social Security and retirement accounts.

EARLY HISTORY OF MORTALITY TABLES
Surveys and censuses have been around for a long time. Early rulers wanted
to keep track of the economic wealth and manpower of their subjects. One
of the earliest enumeration records appears in the Bible in the Book of
Numbers. Egyptian and Roman rulers were noted for their surveys and
censuses.
In the late 1500s and early 1600s, parish clerks of the Church of England in
London began keeping records of the births, deaths, marriages, and baptisms
of their parishioners. Many of these were published weekly and summarized
yearly. They were called the Bills of Mortality. Some even included possible

causes of death as well as could be determined at that time. At best, they were
‘‘hit and miss’’ accounts. If a clerk did not publish the information one week,
the ﬁgures were included in the next week’s summary. Also during this time,
people began keeping records of deaths due to the various plagues.
Around 1662, an English merchant, John Graunt (1620–1674), began
reviewing the Bills of Mortality and combining them into tables. He used
records from the years 1604 to 1661 and produced tables that he published in
a book entitled National and Political Observations. He noticed that with the
exception of plagues or wars, the number of people that died at a certain age
was fairly consistent. He then produced a crude mortality table from this
information. After reviewing the data, he drew several conclusions. Some
were accurate and some were not.
He stated that the number of male births was slightly greater than the
number of female births. He also noticed that, in general, women lived longer
than men. He stated that physicians treated about twice as many female
patients as male patients, and that they were better able to cure the female
patients. From this fact, he concluded that either men were more prone to die
from their vices or that men didn’t go to the doctor as often as women when
they were ill!
For his work in this area, he was given a fellowship in the Royal Society
of London. He was the ﬁrst merchant to receive this honor. Until this time,
all members were doctors, noblemen, and lawyers.
Two brothers from Holland, Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695)
noticed his work. They expanded on Gaunt’s work and constructed their own
mortality table. This was the ﬁrst table that used probability theory and
included the probabilities of a person dying at a certain age in his or her life
and also the probability of surviving to a certain age.
Later, insurance companies began producing and using mortality tables to
determine life expectancies and rates for life insurance.

Bayes’ Theorem
A somewhat more diﬃcult topic in probability is called Bayes’ theorem.
Given two dependent events, A and B, the earlier formulas allowed you to
ﬁnd P(A and B) or P(B|A). Related to these formulas is a principle developed
by an English Presbyterian minister, Thomas Bayes (1702–1761). It is called
Bayes’ theorem.
Knowing the outcome of a particular situation, Bayes’ theorem enables
you to ﬁnd the probability that the outcome occurred as a result of a
particular previous event. For example, suppose you have two boxes
containing red balls and blue balls. Now if it is known that you selected a
blue ball, you can ﬁnd the probability that it came from box 1 or box 2.
A simpliﬁed version of Bayes’ theorem is given next.
249
Copyright © 2005 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.

For two mutually exclusive events, A and B, where event B follows event A,
PðAjBÞ ¼
PðAÞ  PðBjAÞ
PðAÞ  PðBjAÞ þ PðAÞ  PðBjAÞ
EXAMPLE: Box 1 contains two red balls and one blue ball. Box 2 contains
one red ball and three blue balls. A coin is tossed; if it is heads, Box 1 is
chosen, and a ball is selected at random. If the ball is red, ﬁnd the probability
it came from Box 1.
SOLUTION:
Let A ¼ selecting Box 1 and A ¼ selecting Box 2. Since the selection of a box
is based on a coin toss, the probability of selecting Box 1 is 1
2 and the proba-
bility of selecting Box 2 is 1
2; hence, P(A) ¼ 1
2 and P(A) ¼ 1
2. Let B ¼ selecting a
red ball and B ¼ selecting a blue ball. From Box 1, the probability of selecting
a red ball is 2
3, and the probability of selecting a blue ball is 1
3 since there are
two red balls and one blue ball. Hence P(B|A) ¼ 2
3 and PðBjAÞ ¼ 1
3. Since there
is one red ball in Box 2, PðBjAÞ is 1
4, and since there are 3 blue balls in Box 2,
PðBjAÞ ¼ 3
4. The probabilities are shown in Figure A-1.
Hence

EXAMPLE: Two video products distributors supply video tape boxes to
a video production company. Company A sold 100 boxes of which 5 were
defective. Company B sold 300 boxes of which 21 were defective. If a box
was defective, ﬁnd the probability that it came from Company B.
SOLUTION:
Let P(A) ¼ probability that a box selected at random is from company A.
Then, PðAÞ ¼ 100
400 ¼ 1
4 ¼ 0:25; PðBÞ ¼ PðAÞ ¼ 300
400 ¼ 3
4 ¼ 0:75. Since there are 5
defective boxes from Company A, PðDjAÞ ¼
5
100 ¼ 0:05 and there are 21
defective boxes from Company B or A, so PðDjAÞ ¼ 21
300 ¼ 0:07. The prob-
abilities are shown in Figure A-2.

PRACTICE
1. Box I contains 6 green marbles and 4 yellow marbles. Box II contains
5 yellow marbles and 5 green marbles. A box is selected at random
and a marble is selected from the box. If the marble is green, ﬁnd the
probability it came from Box I.
2. An auto parts store purchases rebuilt alternators from two suppliers.
From Supplier A, 150 alternators are purchased and 2% are defective.
From Supplier B, 250 alternators are purchased and 3% are defective.
Fig. A-2.
APPENDIX

Given that an alternator is defective, ﬁnd the probability that it came
from Supplier B.
3. Two manufacturers supply paper cups to a catering service. Manu-
facturer A supplied 100 packages and 5 were damaged. Manufacturer B
supplied 50 packages and 3 were damaged. If a package is damaged,
ﬁnd the probability that it came from Manufacturer A.
4. Box 1 contains 10 balls; 7 are marked ‘‘win’’ and 3 are marked ‘‘lose.’’
Box 2 contains 10 balls; 3 are marked ‘‘win’’ and 7 are marked ‘‘lose.’’
You roll a die. If you get a 1 or 2, you select Box 1 and draw a ball.
If you roll 3, 4, 5, or 6, you select Box 2 and draw a ball. Find the
probability that Box 2 was selected if you have selected a ‘‘win.’’
5. Using the information in Exercise 4, ﬁnd the probability that Box 1
was selected if a ‘‘lose’’ was drawn.
