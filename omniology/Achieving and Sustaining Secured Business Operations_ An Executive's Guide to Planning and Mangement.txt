Introduction
“Every security services or technology provider tells me all the things I must 
have. They don’t tell me what makes sense for my mission to have,” said the 
program manager of one of the missions at the U.S. Navy. This comment 
highlights the pain and the challenges that we have seen with planning and 
managing of security across organizations. The growing pains, bottom-up 
approach, lack of business ownership and accountability, and technology-
driven security industry - motivated us to develop the management model 
and write this book. A great deal of research, frameworks, and supporting 
documentation are available on the topic of cybersecurity from government 
and semi-government entities, academic institutions, and professional 
organizations across the globe. Not surprisingly, most literature is grounded 
on governance, risk management, compliance, and operational controls. 
So, when we began to write, we started by asking, how do we address the 
concern of the program manager at the U.S. Navy and others who want the 
right security posture with the right cost, risk, and value.
For more than 15 years, we have been developing and using capability 
models to bridge the gap between business and IT, assess the current and 
defined desired state, understand dependencies, prioritize and develop 
road maps, and monitor progress. We have applied these models for 
digital transformation, cloud readiness, service management, business 
process improvements, and many other business and IT initiatives. For 
most of our careers, we have also been part of many client engagements, 
delivering infrastructure and security assessments, architecture strategies, 
business cases, governance, and solution designs. Based on experience 
across business and IT, strategy and operations, and capabilities and 
technologies, it was obvious we needed a capability framework.

xiv
Although there exists a large body of knowledge about security 
practices, we couldn’t find a model that does the following:
•	
speaks the language of the business,
•	
focuses on enabling business outcomes,
•	
supports a variety of organizations and business 
models,
•	
is actionable.
Thus, we embarked on a mission of organizing, formalizing, and 
extending our learnings into a business-centric capability framework for 
achieving and sustaining secured business operations. For quite some time, 
we had been using/refining the model in our business engagements; it was 
publicly launched at the Financial Cyber Security conference at Stevens 
Institute of Technology in 2016. Soon after, this book was conceived.
Throughout the framework design and development of the book, we 
have kept our focus on the following guiding principles:
	 1.	 People are driven by their needs. The body of 
knowledge must be comprehensive, yet contextual 
and useful for people in business and IT.
	 2.	 People can only evaluate what they observe, and 
plan what they know. The characteristics and 
practices at each capability maturity level must be 
observable.
	 3.	 Achieving the highest maturity level may not be the 
best value for an organization. The maturity model 
must be designed as a road map to value.
	 4.	 Some things must change to create value. 
Organizations must be able to operationalize the 
model with a purpose-built management platform 
for assessment, planning, and ongoing monitoring.
Introduction
Introduction

xv
	 5.	 Start anywhere, go everywhere. Security is a broad 
and complex capability with dependencies to many 
other capabilities. Organizations may use the model 
top down, bottom up, or middle out.
These principles have helped us deliver a practical framework and 
structure this book for business and IT management, architects, service 
owners, and providers.
The body of knowledge is presented in seven chapters in the book. 
Logically, the chapters follow a classic strategy to execution methodology 
of why, what, and how. If you are a businessperson, you may start with 
the first three chapters, followed by Chapters 6 and 7. Then, turn your 
attention to the remaining Chapters 4 and 5, which focus on operational 
and management capabilities and practices for secured business 
operations.
The first chapter provides an assessment of the current state of the 
security industry and prevailing practices. It concludes that current 
practices are insufficient in achieving and sustaining secured business 
operations. The breadth and depth of security practices are of no value 
if they don’t enable business to do what business wants to do safely and 
securely.
The second chapter articulates the vision and opportunity for an 
organization to leverage security as a competitive advantage. It introduces 
next practices for business-driven security capability management, 
starting with a business engagement model for identifying the required 
risk-resilience level for the organization. Security is not a one-size-fits-all 
capability. To avoid overinvesting or underinvesting in security capabilities 
it is important for organizations to know the extent of business interactions 
and the associated risks. As you read the chapter, you might be able 
to determine the engagement model and risk-resilience level of your 
organization.
Introduction
Introduction

xvi
The next three chapters, Chapters 3-5, take you inside the body of the 
framework for achieving and sustaining secured business operations.
The third chapter is about the business perspective on secured 
business operations. The secured business model, described in this 
chapter, introduces five performance domains (5 Ps) - Prevent, Protect, 
Profile, Policy, and People. These 5 Ps allow business leaders to 
understand, communicate, and manage the security needs based on 
the business drivers and risk resilience required for the level of business 
engagement. A clear understanding of the business risk and required 
business capabilities provides a prescriptive guidance to business and 
IT operations, ensures end-to-end alignment, and drives business 
accountability for achieving and sustaining secured business operations.
In the fourth chapter, we get into the guts of what it will take to secure 
business operations at the desired level of risk resilience. It explains 
the secured operating model of the framework, addressing twenty-one 
operational capabilities organized into six capability domains. The six 
capability domains are - Business Management, Operations Management, 
Risk Management, Compliance Controls, Master Data Management, and 
Infrastructure Management. The secured operating model provides the 
management bridge between business needs as defined by the secured 
business model and various operational practices and technical solutions 
required, implemented, and suggested by many security, risk, and 
compliance frameworks. For people in the trenches who are responsible 
for day-to-day security operations, an assessment using the secured 
operating model can help them understand how well the operational 
capabilities are aligned with business needs, address the gaps, and show 
value of their efforts. On the other hand, the management can evaluate the 
current state, identify the gap, prioritize what must be done, and monitor 
progress against the plan.
In the fifth chapter, we describe the secured management model for 
creating the discipline and culture of ensuring secured business operations 
by design. Planning and implementing security is everyone’s job.  
Introduction
Introduction

xvii
Any change created by any project must have appropriate security 
measures. Therefore, we have included a methodology to help 
organizations operationalize the security mindset in every business/IT 
project or initiative. The management model defines inputs, outputs, and 
key activities across the life cycle of assessing, planning, improving, and 
managing capabilities and solutions. The management practices in this 
model are critical for sustaining secured business operations.
The sixth chapter describes key performance indicators (KPIs) 
and methods for measuring effectiveness of security capabilities and 
efforts. Most organizations have activity-based measures for compliance 
reporting. Constantly, business leaders ask - are we doing the right thing? 
Are we producing the desired outcomes? How do we know? Measuring 
and ensuring effectiveness requires going beyond the activity-based KPIs. 
It requires understanding how value flows from solutions to outcomes. 
The chapter introduces techniques for creating a value flow map and 
measuring value contribution along the way, knowing that security 
effectiveness is key to overcoming planning by fear. It drives accountability 
and effective decision making at all levels in the organization. Alignment 
and measurement are core to the framework, and therefore, they are 
described in Chapter 6.
The seventh chapter is a takeaway chapter. It includes key learnings 
from the previous six chapters. The chapter also includes a few use cases, 
how other organizations have used various aspects of the framework. Last, 
it includes a set of recommendations on adopting the framework and 
overcoming barriers and constraints in your organization.
Feedback and Follow-Up
We know we are not there yet, and we realize, there is always a next 
maturity level to strive for, next practice to develop. As we make further 
strides, we would like to collaborate with you in continuing this journey. 
We are very keen to hear - what do you like about the framework and the

CHAPTER 1
Current Practices
The world is well connected and discoverable for both good 
and bad people. Throwing money at the problem may only 
compound the problem.
Information Security, a Growth Industry?
There is hardly a day when information security is not occupying one 
of the top slots in the newswire. Each time there is a piece of bad news 
or a security outbreak, organizations are quick to announce initiatives 
related to information security, cybersecurity, hacking, malware, data 
loss prevention (DLP), personal data, identity, and access management. 
Numerous organizations have been increasingly spending millions of 
dollars on such initiatives and still not getting any relief from cybercrimes 
and data breaches. Cybersecurity has become a high-growth industry 
with a predicted 9.8% yearly compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
between 2015–2020.1 The global spending on IT security was at $75.5B in 
2015, expected to be $101B by 2018, and will likely reach $170B by 2020. 
A significant proportion of this spending is allocated to fraud and data 
breach detection with emphasis on Security Analytics, Threat Intelligence, 
Mobile Security, and Cloud Security.

The irony is that Cybersecurity has become an industry, a growth 
industry. As it produces goods (software, hardware) and related services 
within an economy, from technical benchmarks, it does meet the 
definition of an industry. Since the Industrial Revolution, industries have 
been created to improve the standard of living and to foster the growth 
of a country or a global region. The security industry is growing as it has 
become a mandatory expense to work and live in the connected and 
interdependent world. The Information and Internet have many positive 
outcomes, connecting people, processes, and organizations around the 
world; creating millions of jobs; and adding trillions of dollars in the global 
economies. Chief among the recent innovations include the Internet 
of Things, Digitization, Social Media, Mobile, and Big Data; these are 
collectively transforming the organizational culture and lifestyle of the 
people. Personal identities to all owned assets at every level have either 
already been converted to digital forms, or are in the process of being 
converted to a digital form. The business processes are being digitized for 
better transparency and agility. As an individual or as an organization, a 
connected and transparent world is a blessing and a curse. How does a 
growing investment in information security help you effectively manage the 
potential vulnerabilities while being innovative in products and processes, 
connected and collaborative with customers and partners, and open to 
work from anywhere? Can you afford to continue to spend more money?
State of the Business
As per the world economic forum, cybersecurity is costing businesses 
$400B–$500B in damages per year. Much more damage is not reported 
due to lack of appropriate understanding and quantification of impact, 
compliance, or reporting regulations.
Understandably, board of directors or management officials do not 
want to see the name of their organization in the news about a security 
breach. What has surprised us is how these very people act in managing 
Chapter 1  Current Practices

security protocols and how they react when things go wrong. Whenever a 
high-profile incident takes place, the board of directors seeks information 
from the management, particularly the CIO or head of IT, about potential 
exposure. In most cases, they simply don’t want to be surprised and need 
assurance that IT is taking all the necessary precautions to avoid unwanted 
publicity. During regular board meetings, security becomes just another 
line item limited to status updates regarding security initiatives and 
measures that IT has taken since the previous review.
We know that senior leadership and line managers have many agendas 
on their plates that preoccupy their time and attention – competing in the 
marketplace, monitoring business results, and driving improvements in their 
area of control. Business is frequently quite clear and direct in what business 
wants IT to do in terms of new capabilities or improvement in systems. When 
it comes to security, they tend to take a reactionary approach by leaving 
it up to the CIO and the IT team to figure out the strategy and technology 
solutions for managing threats, fraud, and breach detection. Even in case of 
compliance, for example, PCI or Sox, business tends to focus on them from 
a technical point of view, thus expecting IT to take care of the compliance 
requirements. The funding for security projects is generally sourced and 
approved generously due to fears of cybercrime or compliance exposure.
State of the Security Practices
The IT group is responsible for managing technology solutions used by the 
business. As many of the applications are purchased rather than developed 
in-house, the security focus has been on the infrastructure, for example, 
controlling devices, limiting access, monitoring traffic, detecting fraud and 
policy violations.
As information security management is delegated to the IT 
department, the security industry has been primarily focused on 
developing frameworks and solutions for managing information security 
by managing infrastructure security.

The wide range of security standards, guidelines, and controls are available 
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department 
of Energy and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), and Center for Internet Security 
(CIS) Organization. The following table provides a high-level summary of the 
purpose and intent of these frameworks and practices. Table 1-1 provides 
a quick summary of these frameworks. Check out online the web site 
securedbusinessops.com for additional details on these frameworks.
Table1-1.  List of Security Frameworks
Cybersecurity Framework (NIST)
To identify, protect, and detect security vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, and 
to respond and recover from security incidents. The critical infrastructure includes 
systems in organization’s property or in the cloud.
Cyber Security Maturity Model (C2M2, Department of Energy and Homeland 
Security)

ISO 27001 and 27002 (International Organization for Standardization)
The ISO 2700x series of standards, guidelines, and associated certifications are 
very extensive in nature and are the greatest source of details for IT to develop 
Information Security Management Systems. They emphasize implementation of 
controls for managing information risk.
Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Twenty security controls for addressing cyber risks. These controls address the 
areas that could pose cyber threats. These controls are being referenced by many 
other frameworks such as NIST and HIPAA, and used by organizations investigating 
Internet security threats and data breaches.

There are many other public, nonprofit, and commercial organizations 
that have developed methodologies and tools to prevent unauthorized 
access, detect vulnerabilities and incidents, and restore the service in 
case of a disruption. Most of them view security as a technical problem 
requiring a technical solution.
Anything Wrong with the Current State?
Nothing is wrong with technology solutions and practices, which are 
designed to address security challenges. Truly! The solutions and practices 
exist because there is a market for such products and services. What may 
be wrong is our mindset, our attitude, or our approach to planning and 
managing security. We find them quite like many transformative paradigms 
and revolutionized IT decisions in the past decades, such as Quality in 
1980s, Automation in 1990s, Internet in 2000s, and Digital in 2010s.
Considering Quality, Automation, Internet and Digital have direct 
connection with customers and products, so one would think that 
business management would take a keener interest and ownership in 
driving, shaping, and exploiting them for business advantage. Eventually, 
Business did but it didn’t start that way. Initially, Quality was viewed as 
a manufacturing problem, thus it was left to the manufacturing plants 
to figure out what they could do to improve quality. Management 
considered quality as a cost of being in the business and a necessity for 
being competitive. Even after spending millions of dollars in designing 
and implementing quality processes, and auditing quality, many 
companies failed to create a quality culture and a sustainable quality 
advantage. Successful organizations transformed the business model 
and business strategy based on quality as a competitive differentiation. 
These organizations have realized the challenges for organizations to 
continuously produce or deliver quality products and services while 
simultaneously reducing the cost. Accordingly, they started managing 
Chapter 1  Current Practices

6
quality as a differentiating organizational capability, posturing quality as a 
value driver, not as a cost to the business.
Technology has triggered many business innovations. For example, 
the Internet has provided global access and reduced barrier to entry 
and Digital technologies have enabled real-time access. It may seem 
obvious for business management to delegate planning and delivery 
of technology-based innovation to the technology group. At the same 
time, it is also obvious that most organizations are not being able to 
fully realize the potential of technology innovations. The reason is quite 
simple – technology alone does not create the desired change in the 
organization, and surely does not provide a sustainable advantage. The 
business management who understood and integrated technology-­enabled 
innovation into business planning and governance enjoyed the trajectory of 
continued growth and highly satisfied customers, partners, and employees. 
If you have not already, you may want to find out – how many technologies 
have your organization purchased that have never been deployed? 
What percentage of employees has changed their workplace behaviors 
in response to a new technology solution? Are you surprised with your 
findings? What is the root cause of whatever you found?
What’s wrong with the current security frameworks and practices 
is exactly what has been ailing many of the past practices in addressing 
organizational challenges and transformation initiatives. Could you have 
improved and sustained sales growth just by implementing a customer 
relationship management (CRM) system without having the appropriate 
skills, staffing, culture, and processes? Could you have sustained customer 
loyalty just by implementing big data and social connections without 
having the customer-centric product design, development, and support? 
Can you avoid cost and realize the business value of IT just by outsourcing 
or going to the cloud? Can you be safe and secure just by building 
technological walls and barriers? Ask yourself and people around you, how 
current practices and management attitude are making us innovative and 
responsive while being safe and secure?
Chapter 1  Current Practices

Transforming Fear Into Confidence 
and Advantage
Rather than asking what IT is doing to protect the business, the business 
should be asking what are they doing to run business operations 
uninterrupted, safe, and secure. Rather than viewing monies spent on 
information security as a necessary expense, organizations should be 
considering information security as a strategic differentiation. Information 
security is a business-critical issue. The fear of potential failure can’t be 
left up to the technology savvy people of the company to address with 
the notion that technology created this problem and only technology can 
solve it. The fear needs to be transformed into confidence that creates 
business value by embracing the challenge. The question is not, is 
security a business or technology problem? It is business critical to gain 
customer confidence, workforce confidence, grow the business, increase 
competitiveness, gain market share, improve productivity, and socially 
contribute to improve the living standards of the society. Security is not 
a technology problem; rather, it is impacting all the business drivers 
directly. Security should be tamed with confidence to improve business 
operations overall with the proactive approaches and not reactionary with 
fear. Ultimately, securing business operations will generate sustainable 
business value.
To get different results, we need to do things differently. We need 
new practices where we look at and manage security business down, not 
just technology up. Individual and technology accountabilities are not 
sufficient. It requires cross-functional decisions and collaboration for end-­
to-­end securing of business operations.
The next chapter introduces the framework and a set of next 
practices for transforming the management approach and managing the 
organizational capabilities for achieving and sustaining secured business 
operations.

Business-Centric 
Security and Risk 
Management
Manage security as an organizational capability, not as a 
­liability. For sustained competitive advantage, an organization  
must consider security their friend, not a foe.
Business State
Regardless of the industry and size of the organization, there is 
a fundamental shift within every business and operating model. 
Organizations are dependent on each other, requiring a much tighter, 
integrated, and timely flow of information. The type of information and 
with whom they share information will only expand with time. In the 
online world, everything is a service and is fast becoming a self-service. 
Organizations can no longer function in isolation.

10
The organizations will continue to push the envelope on how 
technology can help them become more productive, reduce the cost of 
doing business, provide new and better products and services to their 
customers and partners, make better and faster decisions, and introduce 
new business and operating models.
To manage business, leaders are always looking for ways to innovate 
and drive their competitiveness in the marketplace. They are always asking 
the IT function to simplify and enhance their capabilities to communicate, 
collaborate, connect, and consolidate information and transactions across 
people and processes inside and outside the organization. Organizations 
like to collect a lot more information about their customers so that they 
can become more responsive to customers’ needs, and thereby, better 
respond to their needs and promote relevant products and services. 
Organizations want their customers to self-help themselves through their 
mobile devices or whatever method they choose. They want to seamlessly 
integrate or interact with machines, devices, and systems belonging to 
other people or organizations for a real-time flow of information and 
actions.
In every organization we have worked with, consistently, it has been 
found that business management spends lot of time, energy, and money 
in thinking and managing the capabilities they need to run and grow the 
business. We have also found that business-initiated projects mostly, if not 
entirely, are about new business capabilities. The capabilities generally 
require new roles or new tools of trade. As most of the functionality or 
capabilities are grounded on digital technologies, unlike wet floors or 
operating machinery, most organizations don’t think their people will 
get hurt. As a result, the safety and security of information is not often 
considered in advance or during process or solution engineering. Over 
the years, the organizations have learned that a rework does not always 
produce the same quality, controls, and satisfaction even after spending 
a great amount of time and money. The same is true for information 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

11
and transactional security in any business process. To overcome the 
unnecessary spending and associated risks, any business capability 
planning must include delivery of a secured business capability.
Security as a Competitive Differentiation
A recent report,1 published by AIG that is based on a study conducted in 
the United Kingdom shows the following results:
•	
45% of companies surveyed have already experienced a 
cyber security breach.
•	
62% believe it likely that their company will suffer an 
attack within the next 12 months.
•	
56% of European data breaches were caused by internal 
company employees or by other areas internal to the 
company.
•	
52% of companies said they either rarely or never 
discussed information security in board meetings.
•	
36% still designate maintenance of cyber security as an 
IT department function.
In the previous chapter, we questioned the need for a growing 
cybersecurity industry. Even with the large sum of money spent on 
information security infrastructure, organizations continue to fear and 
experience security breaches because of the low level of maturity in their 
security management capabilities. It means, if planned and managed right, 
security can be a major competitive differentiation in the age of digital 
business where everything is a service.

security-board-level-issue
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

12
If you look back, you can clearly see how business management 
attitude has changed over the last few decades around product and 
service quality. At the start of global competition, it all began with the 
need to survive in the marketplace and considered cost of quality as 
a cost of doing business. Just like the information security industry 
today, there was a growing industry around total quality management 
with plenty of methodologies. Many organizations embarked on major 
transformational, quality initiatives and promoted themselves as quality-
first organizations. In spite of these quality initiatives, some organizations 
could not survive while others were able to create a sustainable 
competitive advantage with quality as a core differentiating ingredient.2 
This time cybersecurity is no different than quality. Just like quality, 
security is not one person’s or one group’s responsibility. It is everyone’s 
responsibility. It takes people, process, information, technology, and 
culture to do it right and, more importantly, sustain it. If done right and 
managed right, secured business operations will also be a key contributor 
to ongoing business advantage. The organizations recognize that product 
quality is not a difficult subject for business leaders to understand, 
and therefore they have been willing to commit and proactively drive 
desired outcomes. For business leaders to see security as a business 
differentiation rather than a business nuisance, they need to describe and 
organize it in a business context. Not in terms of their negative impact on 
the business but in terms of business outcomes. Not as a shiny object but 
as an integral part of the culture.

Secured Business Operations, 
an Organizational Capability
Let’s start with a term that is business-centric and clearly articulates the 
business objective – Secured Business Operations. Cybersecurity may be 
a mean; the secured business operation is the destination or outcome that 
will ultimately produce the desired results.
Secured Business Operations is an organizational capability, providing 
an ongoing ability for protecting information and assets, preventing 
unauthorized access, ensuring trust and peace of mind, and safeguarding 
a firm’s brand while continuing innovation and delivering differentiating 
experience and services for its customers, partners, and employees.
Every product or service provided by an organization can be viewed 
like a coin with two sides. One side represents its value for the consuming 
organization or an individual; and the other side represents the warranty 
from the issuer, that is, it can be trusted for using whenever or wherever. 
Any business operation, whether internally within the organization 
or externally with other people or organizations, must have the right 
functional capabilities, that is, fit for purpose to produce the desired 
outcomes. At the same time, the business operation should also be secured 
and reliable enough, that is, fit for use for people to trust and participate 
in the operation. It doesn’t matter how good the functional capabilities 
are if no one is willing to adopt and use them. For sustainable business 
advantage, every business operation needs to be fit for purpose and fit for 
use – in other words, it must be a secured business operation.
Now, how secure do the “secured” business operations need to be?
Whenever you talk with technology, process, compliance, or a 
framework subject-matter expert about securing business, the typical 
response is in terms of a list of “ideal” practices. Frequently, these experts 
quote these practices as best practices, not best for you but what has  
been best for someone else. Many of them also take the mindset of being 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

14
­risk-­averse, that is, anything short of the extreme or what is considered the 
best, has a risk that must be eliminated.
Except in case of life and death or some moral, ethical issues, most 
of the business decisions are based on return on investment. Any lack of 
appropriate investment does introduce potential business or financial 
risk. It should not be about eliminating future potential risk today, it must 
be about understanding and willingness to accept the potential cost of 
follow-up actions needed in response to the situation when potential risk 
is materialized. In the end, good business decisions are based on cost and 
value of doing something, and not on cost and risk of not doing something. 
There is no right or wrong answer on what that something is. To 
adequately answer the question, “how secured your business operations 
need to be?,” you must first identify the appropriate level of risk resilience 
for your organization. So, rather than getting caught up in the details and 
frankly in the noise of all the technical opinions, the next framework and 
practices need to be business-centric by design and must leverage the laws 
of gravity.
“Where will the apple fall” – can be determined quite easily when 
we are looking from the top of the tree compared to looking up from the 
ground and not sure which apple are we focusing on.
A safety and security risk is introduced whenever there is a handshake 
or distribution of information between two parties. The parties can be 
individuals, processes, systems, or devices regardless of their location 
and affiliation with the organization. If the information remains in the 
sole custody of the source and there are no windows or holes in the 
walls around the source for someone to peak in, there will not be a 
cybersecurity industry and we won’t be writing this book. As we studied 
many organizations across industries, we found that the security risk 
resilience level of the organization can be reasonably evaluated and 
projected based on the types of interaction with its own employees; 
between its own functions; and with external people, processes, and 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

15
organizations. Consider the business engagement model to understand 
these interactions.
A business engagement model helps you identify the “right” security 
posture or risk resilience level for the business, and guide the execution 
trajectory for achieving and sustaining secured business operations, thus 
avoiding overengineering and ensuring alignment at every level and across 
the organization.
The model consists of four distinct engagement levels, describing 
the reach and range of engagement. See Table 2-1 for a summary of the 
engagement models. The engagement levels are progressive, that is, as the 
organization grows, it typically extends its ecosystem and capabilities, thus 
increasing the reach and range of interactions.
The business engagement model provides for every planner and 
decision maker in a business context. It also ensures that downstream 
security measures and actions support required and desired business

activities. With this understanding and alignment, risk and necessary 
actions needed to manage the risk can be characterized.
At each engagement level, the organization needs to have business 
capabilities and a competency level in recognizing, analysing, and 
managing various types of security risks an organization may face. Even 
if the two organizations are operating at the same engagement level, say 
connected business, their risk resilience capabilities and competencies 
may vary. Table 2-2 outlines the summary and structure of a security risk 
resilience capability map. The subsequent chapters will leverage this map 
for in-depth assessment and planning of various business and operational 
capabilities.

It is obvious in this capability map, initially business leaders and 
organizations in general are focused on what must be absolutely addressed 
and managed, that is, risk related to legal compliance. The scope of risk 
management increases as the business engagement model expands 
beyond the internal processes. In terms of organizational competencies, 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

17
initially most of the risk-related practices, including discovery and 
mitigation, are reactive. Competent organizations become proactive 
with defined processes, and even more effective and risk resilient with 
the ability to sense things before they happen. It is not expected, and not 
even recommended, that every organization must seek to be level 5 in 
all capabilities. The emphasis must be on value generation, including 
being risk resilient, for the business engagement level. Use Figure 2-1 to 
determine the right place on the capability map based on the assessment 
of your engagement model.
With the introduction of the business engagement model and risk 
resilience capability map, an organization can determine how secure their 
business operations need to be.
This is a first step in achieving and sustaining secured business 
operations as an organizational capability. In the next section and 
subsequent chapters, additional components of this framework are 
explained, and the remaining steps are outlined for making it happen in 
any organization.

Achieving and Sustaining Secured Business 
Operations
We understand businesses are different, and there are many different 
solutions to a problem, yet we also see how people leverage their 
experiences across functions, organizations, industries, and even cultures. 
The framework and approach for achieving and sustaining secured 
business operations is industry, language, and technology agnostic. At the 
same time, it allows an organization to quickly focus on what is important 
and relevant to them and personalize for specific needs and solutions.
As it was stated earlier in this chapter, the secured business operation 
is an organizational capability, and it needs to be articulated, assessed, and 
planned in such a way that everyone in the organization can understand, 
support, and benefit from it based on their individual perspective. 
Therefore, the capability framework for secured business operations 
includes two capability models – (1) Management and (2) Operational 
perspectives. As depicted in Figure 2-2, these two models drive and 
influence each other.
Figure 2-2.  Capability Models
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

19
Almost all solution frameworks and methodologies emphasize 
alignment with business objectives, but generally lack specificity in 
helping people in finding the alignment. The biggest barrier in any 
alignment and decision making is that people can only plan based on what 
they know. So, how do people learn more and sooner?
It is very hard to achieve, let alone sustain, if we don’t begin with the 
end in mind. The secured business model is the first capability model 
from a business perspective, breaking down the barriers to alignment and 
learning.
For secured business operations, what should business leaders be 
asking, planning, and managing? In the secured business model, five 
performances (5 Ps) domains are defined for business management to 
identify the risk posture of their business operations. Figure 2-3 outlines 5 
Ps with the business intent they address.
Figure 2-3.  5 Ps of Secured Business Model
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

20
Each of the 5 Ps has multiple capability dimensions. Each dimension 
is characterized across 5 maturity levels. For example, Prevent Domain 
includes what kind of unauthorized access and what kind of information 
leakage you want to prevent as a business. The maturity levels, 
progressively, define the types of unauthorized access or leakage you can 
be preventing. The higher the maturity, the broader the reach and range 
of prevention. Based on your business engagement model, you should be 
able to identify where you need to be across these 5 Ps, evaluate where you 
are, and what you could be doing to close the gap.
The secured business model acts as a planning and execution guide as 
well as an accountability and value management tool for the organization, a 
critical requirement of an effective alignment and oversight. See Chapter 3 
for the detailed, inside view of the secured business model.
With the knowledge of “what” is needed across 5 Ps, the organization 
can now proceed to assess and plan the operational practices needed to 
support the 5 Ps. The operational practices are encapsulated in the secured 
operating model. See Figure 2-4 for various operational domains included 
in the model.
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

21
The secured operating model provides a 360° view of various cross-­
functional, operational capabilities needed for achieving and sustaining 
secured business operations. The six capability domains shown in 
Figure 2-4 include 21 critical capabilities every organization should be 
regularly evaluating and improving in alignment with the secured business 
model. Just like 5 Ps in secured business model, 21 critical capabilities 
in secured operating model are also characterized along the 5 maturity 
levels. For example, Business Management includes change management, 
governance, and KPI measurement as three critical capabilities. As noted 
in the previous chapter, most of the existing operational and technical 
practices and frameworks are operational and technical in content. 
They form the underpinning, supporting practices for the capabilities in 
the secured operating model. Therefore, the secured operating model 
acts as a unifying capability model by accounting and incorporating 
current practices and solutions. The organizations can assess the current 
capabilities built on current industry practices and solutions, and leverage 
Figure 2-4.  Secured Operating Model
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

22
other frameworks and expert knowledge in the context of a secured 
operating model.
We can’t clap with one hand, at least not loud enough and not for 
long. At a low level of maturity, everyone can make some improvements 
on their own. To get to a higher ground and sustain, we depend on others 
as much as they depend on us. Achieving and sustaining higher maturity 
in secured business operations, organizations need to understand and 
address interdependencies as much as they need to improve individual 
capabilities. Therefore, in addition to capability maturity models and 
underlying enabling practices, the framework also includes inbound 
and outbound dependencies between various capabilities across the 
organization. This body of knowledge can help the organization on two 
fronts –
	 1.	 Achieving desired maturity and outcomes by 
recognizing and addressing gaps in the dependent 
capabilities.
	 2.	 Driving change and communicating value by 
enabling upstream capabilities to improve their 
maturity.
See Figure 2-5 as an example of how a dependency map can help 
understand and manage risk and value.
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

23
A body of knowledge is critical, but, on its own, is neither sufficient 
nor does it guarantee successful adoption and implementation. We have 
seen technologies failing to deliver expected results, and training courses 
failing to change behavior. To close the gap between information and 
transformation, there is a need of an execution discipline by leveraging 
the body of knowledge for desired outcomes. Therefore, in the overall 
framework for secured business operations, a secured management model 
is included. Figure 2-6 provides the high-level model that is explored in 
detail in Chapter 5.

The secured management model is an outcome-oriented approach to 
sustain secured business operations in a scalable way holistically from a 
people, process, information, and technology perspective. It incorporates 
cumulative learning from many process management practices, such 
as lean six-sigma, value management, and program management. The 
model emphasizes measurement and includes a list of potential KPIs that 
organizations can use at each level of maturity in order to monitor progress 
and impact.
So far, we have introduced many components of the framework for 
achieving and sustaining secured business operations. The framework 
details follow in subsequent chapters. Let’s quickly summarize how one 
can use the framework for managing cyber and security risks, as well as 
create competitive advantage with secured business operations as an 
organizational capability.

can clearly articulate their risk posture, provide 
necessary guidance, and monitor organization 
performance against desired outcomes.
	 3.	 Use the secured operating model to assess, develop, 
and maintain the required practices involving 
people, process, information, and technology for 
secured business operations, guided by the risk 
posture defined using a secured business model.
	 4.	 Use the secured management model to implement 
the discipline necessary to adjust and sustain 
secured business operations aligned with the 
business engagement model.
Figure 2-7 outlines the purpose of each model in the framework for 
secured business operations.
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

26
Now, let’s review two use cases - how the framework was used by 
different organizations. In the current business environment, you may find 
your organization somewhere in between the two studied organizations. 
During the initial assessment and follow-through planning in these 
organizations and otherwise, we noticed the following:
•	
Increased business involvement and accountability. 
Cybersecurity is no longer an IT-centric topic.
•	
Change in business and IT posture toward risk 
management. They started moving from being risk-­
averse toward risk-managed in their decision making 
and planning.
•	
Knowledge of “unknowns” that helped in planning. 
Because of unknowns, there was a lot of fear that was 
leading to overengineering and overspending.
Figure 2-7.  Secured Business Operations
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

27
•	
By-design mindset. Everyone begins to think about 
their role and responsibility in achieving and sustaining 
secured business operations.
Manufacturing Organization (B2B 
Engagement Model)
An industrial product manufacturing and distribution organization 
primarily works with other business organizations, rather than the end-­
user consumers. It has multiple manufacturing and warehouse locations. 
It has strategic and operationally integrated partnerships with a set of 
customers and suppliers.
Based on its interaction and flow of information with customers and 
partners, it was determined that the business engagement model was to 
be Business to Business (B2B). Over time, it may evolve into a connected 
business as it expands collaboration and integration beyond supply chain, 
order processing, shipping, and support. As a conservative and cautious 
organization, the business and IT management have been very methodical 
in leveraging new technologies, particularly for communicating and 
sharing information outside the company. In spite of careful planning 
and safety-first culture, the management felt pressure on both fronts – 
increasing security-related cost and fear, and pressure from customers and 
partners for more and more electronic processing and timely information. 
Business leadership along with the CIO decided to take an outside-in or 
business-centric view of their security practices, and find a happy medium 
between required innovation in their business processes and resistance to 
change due to security risk.
A small project team consisting of business, IT, and external 
consultants worked for about six weeks in assessing the current practices 
and developing the recommendations. The team leveraged the secured 
business capability maturity model to survey many business senior- and 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

28
middle-level managers to capture their thoughts on the security posture. 
As expected, there was a sufficient variability in responses due to different 
perceptions or varying maturity across business processes. As shown in 
Figure 2-8, the average maturity of many of their 5P capabilities was close 
to level 2. Referring back to Figure 2-1, for a B2B organization seeking to 
become better connected with its customers and partners, being level 2 is 
not a bad place to be. Definitely, there were areas they needed to improve 
to reduce the unnecessary risk exposure.
Once the management understood the current risk posture, the project 
team proceeded to assess current practices. It invited business and IT 
process owners and stakeholders to participate in a survey. As processes are 
integrated with customers and partners, the team decided to invite select 
customers and partners to understand their point of view. A heat map of 
current capabilities based on a secured operating model was produced, 
highlighting the level of competency in various areas. Figure 2-­9 shows that 
most of the operational capabilities were between maturity levels 2 and 3. 
Dependency management and life cycle management capabilities were 
operating even at lower maturity levels than 2.
Figure 2-8.  Assessment - Secured Business Model
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

29
Although many aspects of the assessment were obvious, there were a 
couple of interesting observations.
	 1.	 A few current practices were overinvested based 
on the business engagement model and risk 
posture identified from the secure business 
model. Continued investment or improvement in 
these areas was contributing to the cost but not 
necessarily the value.
	 2.	 Some areas were overlooked or significantly 
underinvested, that is, below desired maturity level, 
negatively impacting overall posture and return on 
other capabilities.
Figure 2-9.  Assessment - Secured Operating Model
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

30
With understanding of the business engagement model, and 
assessment of the risk posture and current operational capabilities, 
the board and executive leadership made necessary changes to the 
governance, funding, metrics, execution, and reporting activities.
Health Care Organization (Digital Business)
Health care is one industry where time is of an essence and right 
information to the right people is paramount. Care and convenience 
is putting pressure on security and risk measures. Health care is 
transforming greatly with the focus on digitizing health care information 
and providing health care services virtually to patients. The privacy and 
security regulations, HIPAA, PHI, PCI, PII, and EDPA are all putting a lot of 
controls to provide health care services in a safe manner and by keeping 
the consumer, patient, in mind. With advancement in technologies, 
medical devices and the desire to share information with various parties 
in real time for timely and quality care while reducing the cost of care, it 
is quite evident that the business engagement model for most health care 
organizations can be categorized as digital business.
To provide secured patient care services and securely manage patient 
health information, health care providers, insurance organizations, and 
pharmaceuticals are required to work in tight integration while abiding 
to all regulatory requirements. Achieving and sustaining end-to-end 
secured business operations is more challenging in heavily siloed and 
disjointed systems environment. As digitization plays the significant role, 
the approach was taken to look into the full spectrum of the five Ps of 
the secured business model as an internationally recognized health care 
provider. The board and the senior leadership understood the profiles 
of risks, associated vulnerabilities, and exceptions; and the business 
importance of preventing breaches and protecting assets was realized. 
The understanding led to improving policies by creating a supporting 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

31
executive-level governance committee for making decisions and 
developing appropriate policies. The core team of 50 plus subject-matter 
experts and consultants was formed to focus on developing the strategy 
and operationalization of secured business operations by changing the 
mindset of people. To achieve the business goals of guest-friendly patient 
care, extending reach to global health care providers and pharmaceuticals 
in a trustworthy, reliable, and safe manner, a multimillion and multiyear 
enterprise-level strategic initiative was spawned.
Using the secured operating model, the following strategic business-­
critical initiatives were initiated for planning and overall enterprise 
architecture purposes:
Business Management – The cross-functional governance committee, 
including health care providing hospitals, finance, legal, and operations, 
was established with the focus on providing the secured health care 
services.
Operations Management – Multiple initiatives were in focus for 
securing the operations from payment cards processing, health care and 
supporting services management, patient identity and health information, 
IT operations, and network operations perspective.
Risk Management – The risk profiles were established to understand, 
prioritize, manage, and execute projects to eliminate associated 
vulnerabilities and exceptions for the overall management of the relevant 
risks.
Compliance Controls – To meet the regulatory requirements, 
enterprise-level architecture was established for aligning business 
and technology architecture and meeting the compliance controls 
requirements in a sustainable manner.
Infrastructure Management – The vulnerabilities associated with 
networks, data center servers, storage, and middleware posed the 
fundamental risks for achieving the desired level of security associated 
with cybercrime and securing the business operations.
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

32
Master Data Management – The data associated with managed assets, 
patients, health care provider workforce, other providers, research, and 
insurance companies were not centrally managed and had vulnerabilities 
posing security risks.
To start with, the board decided to give importance to strengthen the 
foundation elements and the focus was given to manage the associated 
infrastructure risks. The strategic program was spawned with well-defined 
key performance indicators and associated measurements to successful 
manage such a business-critical initiative using the execution discipline 
defined by the secured management model.
The administrators recognized that this is a journey and they are now 
engaged on a continuum basis to ensure new capabilities developed based 
on the risks associated with the change or advancements in interactions 
with people and systems in the ecosystem.
Achieving and Sustaining Secured Business 
Operations in Your Organization
A change and persistent transformation starts with awareness. As you can 
see through the above case studies, many people in these organizations 
were taking care of the security, doing more than necessary in some cases 
while being unaware of many other things. How do you know your weak 
links? How do you know that you are doing the right things, not just for 
today but for tomorrow as well? If you begin with the end in mind, every 
step you take will help you achieve and sustain progress.
Therefore, awareness among your board and senior management for 
a secured business operation is critical for creating a competitive edge for 
your business growth; and just like other critical capabilities, they must 
take active interest in building and maintaining this capability. Use the 
body of knowledge in this book and state of your organization for creating 
the required management mindset. You may conduct an initial, quick 
Chapter 2  Next Practices: Business-Centric Security and Risk Management

33
assessment using the business engagement model and 5 Ps in the secured 
business model to create awareness and support.
As we stated earlier, secured business operations are an organizational 
capability. It means you would need representation and engagement of 
various functions and roles across the organization. Conduct a survey 
using the business engagement model, secured business model, and 
secured operating model with a broader group of people with follow-­
up interviews with select people. These models and assessments will 
drive learning, common language, and shared objectives across the 
organization.
Based on the gaps between the current and desired risk posture, 
develop a plan for addressing the 5 Ps. Start by assessing, building, 
and maintaining the profile of various vulnerabilities in your business 
operations. Ensure that you have business-driven policies and holistic 
governance in place to prevent breaches and protect enterprise-level 
business operations internally and externally with employees, customers, 
partners, and suppliers. The behavior and attitude of the people define the 
culture of the enterprise. Generally, people are often the weakest links in 
sustaining secured business operations.
Strengthen your culture and ensure people who are part of your 
workforce, including internally and externally, are well educated on an 
ongoing basis regarding the security measures.
The subsequent chapters provide detailed explanation of the 
framework and the models introduced in this chapter. They also include 
underlying practices, dependencies, and metrics to help you further in 
developing plans and operationalizing the framework for achieving and 
sustaining secured business operations in your organization.

CHAPTER 3
Secured Business 
Model
Business and trust are two sides of the same coin. You can’t 
have one without the other. So, let’s manage them as one.
Achieving and Sustaining Secured Business 
Operations Starts with Business
No organization wants to take unnecessary risk. No business leader wants 
to do anything intentionally that would negatively harm the organization 
or themselves. Every business leader is accountable for something specific 
that eventually contributes to desired business outcomes. Business leaders 
set the framework and direction for the team to do the right things and 
believe they are doing the right things. If this is the case, we ask, why 
are business leaders concerned about security? Why don’t business 
managers like the security solutions proposed by Information Technology 
(IT) teams? Why do organizations continue to be surprised by security 
incidents? The answer seems to be obvious – misplaced accountability1

Business Review, January 11, 2016, https://hbr.org/2016/01/

36
for securing business operations. Business thinks IT is accountable for 
security, but IT alone cannot set the clear expectations, develop the clear 
capability, set the key performance indicators for the business outcome, 
and take appropriate risks.
In the previous chapter, we introduced a top-down approach with the 
secured business model for remediating the issues around accountability, 
direction, and alignment across the organization. In this chapter, we 
provide the details of this model to elaborate what it is and how it can be 
used by the business leaders for planning, prioritizing, communicating, 
and monitoring the state of capabilities required for secured business 
operations.
The secured business model provides a bridge between the business 
objectives and underlying business practices and technology solutions for 
secured business operations. The model helps business leaders articulate 
their goals and objectives into a set of clear and directional statements 
about what must be prevented or protected, ensure alignment, establish 
the appropriate freedom within the framework, set expectations, and 
monitor progress and outcomes. This model helps operational and line 
managers in scoping, driving cross-functional alignment, managing a 
portfolio, and measuring and communicating the value of their initiatives. 
The next chapter provides the detailed insight into the secured operating 
model in support of the secured business model.
Secured Business Model and Five Ps
The heart of every effective business management is a business model, 
defining the purpose, value proposition, and core – differentiating 
capabilities. For secured business operations, the Secured Business 
Model provides an information security capability map from a business 
perspective. It is used to determine the organization’s current risk posture, 
and the required capabilities for the required secured business posture. 
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

37
In addition, the model provides the guidance for closing the gaps and acts 
as a vehicle for monitoring the execution. The capabilities are organized 
in five performance domains. Each performance domain includes a set of 
capability building blocks. Each capability building block is characterized 
across five maturity or performance levels. Figure 3-1 outlines the five Ps 
with their top-level capability building blocks.

Figure 3-1.  Secured Business Model with 5 Ps Details
One cannot clap with one hand. Business leaders must focus on all 
these five performance domains collectively to ensure that they have the 
right capabilities and are providing a clear direction to everyone in the 
organization for conducting business operations with the required security 
risk resilience.
PREVENT performance domain represents what an organization is 
preventing or should be preventing from happening. Any occurrence of 
unauthorized access, leakage, failure, denial of service, or errors and fraud 
will have a detrimental impact on the organization’s ability to conduct and 
maintain business operations.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

38
Table 3-1 lists the key capabilities in the prevent domain. Based on the 
current and desired business engagement with customers, partners, and 
employees, business management can identify what must be prevented.
Table 3-1.  Prevent Domain
Prevent Capability Building Blocks
Unauthorized 
Access
Today, most organizational assets are digitized. Limiting the right 
access to the right people at the right time is the most crucial to 
prevent cyber-attacks.
Prevent unauthorized access and identify undesired access granted. 
The extent of prevention depends upon the extent of business 
engagement and process/system exposure. Business must take 
ownership in establishing the appropriate access controls.
Information 
Leakage
Prevent unintended and unplanned leakage of information and 
intellectual property (IP) of the organization.
Business must define the type of information and IP that must be 
prevented from any leakage, for example, information related to 
employees, customers, partners, products, services, and associated 
transactions.
Unplanned 
Failures
Unplanned disruption in the functioning of a core organization 
and information assets could pose risk to business continuity and 
security of business operations.
Prevent unplanned and unnecessary failures in ongoing operations 
for mitigating associated business continuity risks. Business must 
make sure all aspects of secured business operations are considered 
holistically for preventing unplanned failures.
Errors and 
Fraud
Prevent human errors and potential fraud by internal or external 
people or organizations. Technology cannot prevent all errors. 
Business has the knowledge of processes and the context. Business 
must define what errors and fraud must be prevented.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

39
The PROTECT performance domain represents what is or must be 
guarded from any lasting damage to integrity and trust within and outside 
the organization.
Table 3-2 lists the key capabilities in the protect domain. Not all 
information requires the same kind or level of protection. Business must 
define what information is critical to the organization and then plan and 
manage its protection from any undue harm.
Table 3-2.  Protect Domain
Protect Capability Building Blocks
Credentials 
and Sensitive 
Information
Protect and preserve credentials and any information deemed 
sensitive by the organization from any harm.
Business must take ownership in defining the credentials and 
sensitive information and appropriate controls for guarding 
such information.
Integrity
Protect information from any tempering during transmission of 
the information, or while being kept in any kind of storage. It 
is required for the information to be trusted by the recipient or 
consumer.
Business must define appropriate rules to maintain the integrity 
of information produced or acquired.
Confidentiality
Protect privacy of information and transaction while 
communicating or sharing information between people, 
processes, and devices regardless of their location or means of 
communication.
Business only can define the privacy level required and must 
create the capability to define these levels and associate an 
appropriate level to every information asset.

Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

POLICY performance domain addresses the polity or governance with 
appropriate organizational policies, decision rights, and processes for safe 
and secure business operations.
Table 3-3 lists the key capabilities in the policy domain.
Table 3-2.  (continued)
Protect Capability Building Blocks
Process Continuity Protect people, processes, interactions, and transactions from 
disruptions of any kind, for example, denial of service, could 
pose risk and lead into security breaches.
The continuity in business terms is about a smooth and 
uninterrupted flow of information. Business must identify what 
must be protected for business continuity and ensure the 
appropriate measures are in place.
Table 3-3.  POLICY Domain
Policy Capability Building Blocks
Rules and 
Controls
A control is an actionable pre-decided policy statement for offering 
secured business operations for a business situation or for an 
external regulatory requirement. This control requires one or more 
rules to put it into action.
A rule is a binding statement that is set for managing some business 
situation. A rule can be leveraged by one or more controls.
Establish guiding principles, governing rules, and controls for 
ensuring appropriate design and implementation of security-related 
procedures. It is important that business takes accountability to 
define these rules and controls for securing business operations.
(continued )
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

41
Table 3-3.  (continued)
Policy Capability Building Blocks
Decision 
Making
A decision for planning and managing security risk may require 
support of business leaders across business functions.
Business must define decisions rights, processes, and measures for 
ensuring appropriate behavior across the organization in a structured 
manner.
Life Cycle 
Management
Every asset has a useful life beyond which its value deteriorates.
To sustain secured business operations through business innovations 
or changes in the business environment, business management must 
review, replace, and retire past decisions, controls, rules, processes, and 
structures to keep them aligned with the changing business dynamics.
Business must take responsibility to define life cycle management of 
rules and controls for managing, at all times, desired security risk levels.
Change 
Management
Business leaders are periodically making strategic and tactical decisions, 
requiring either changes in the existing capabilities, or, development 
of new capabilities. Introduction of a new or enhanced capability can 
impact the security aspect of the business operations, or it may be 
required to ensure new business operations are optimal and secured.
To ensure value is created, security risks are mitigated, operations 
remain secured, and the business management must take the 
ownership and accountability seriously to see that the change 
happens as expected in the organization.
Job Roles
People are an integral part of every business process. In additional to 
functional skills for the job, people need to have appropriate security-
related skills for secured business operations.
It is not sufficient for Human Resources to define and manage 
job roles. Business managers know their business processes and 
understand potential exposure. They must consider the security 
aspect of the process in defining roles and organizing skills.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

42
The PEOPLE performance domain represents the people-centric 
management responsibilities and activities for ensuring ongoing secured 
business operations. Every business activity and outcome requires a 
combination of people, process, information, and technology. As much as 
the human element could add intelligence, flexibility, and compassion to 
any business process, it also introduces a security risk. The people domain 
defines intangible and tangible management actions for appropriate 
culture, workforce transitions, and awareness and readiness for managing 
the security risk.
Table 3-4 lists the key capabilities in the people domain.
Table 3-4.  PEOPLE Domain
People Capability Building Blocks
Culture
Beliefs, behavior, attitude, and adoption of security mindset 
and risk posture of people in the organization. Culture defines 
what people in the organization will do when they encounter a 
situation.
Unless machines are making all the decisions, it is important that 
leadership is promoting and driving the appropriate culture for 
secured business operations under all circumstances.
Awareness
Most of the security incidents in an organization happen due 
to lack of awareness and readiness. In many cases, people 
represent the first or the last mile in business interactions. 
People can only make decisions and take actions based on what 
they know.
Individual responsibility starts with business leaders making 
sure that people are aware of the security implications and are 
prepared to take appropriate actions.
(continued )
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

43
People Capability Building Blocks
Transitions
It is given that people will change their roles and new people 
will take over the tasks. The transition should not only address 
the access controls but also the individual knowledge related to 
security in the context of the tasks being transitioned.
Business must define the type and extent of access controls and 
security knowledge needed for a job, and ensure that access and 
knowledge transfer is managed across transitions.
Management and 
Operations
Having capability for setting the direction, driving change 
and accountability, ensuring integration across strategic and 
execution processes, managing development, and adoption of 
security practices across the organization.
Just like business management is anticipating, planning and 
driving innovative business capabilities, business should be 
evaluating and planning security capabilities, policies, and 
practices for sustaining secured business operations through the 
change in business.
Table 3-4.  (continued)
The PROFILE performance domain defines what the organization 
must know to plan and maintain secured business operations. It includes 
knowledge of vulnerabilities, exceptions, risks, and dependencies in the 
organizations across people, process, information, and technologies. 
Without this knowledge, organizations may not be as proactive in 
anticipating and addressing potential incidents. In many ways, this 
domain supports all other performance domains.
Table 3-5 lists the key capabilities in the profile domain.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

44
Table 3-5.  PROFILE Domain
Profile Capability Building Blocks
Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited in reducing 
an organization’s risk resilience. A vulnerability can be anywhere 
across people, business process, and technologies. Organization 
must profile current and potential internal and external 
vulnerabilities.
Risks
Security risks have potential to impact an organization brand 
along with potential to impact the profitability and/or revenue 
growth. Managing such risks is critical for sustaining secured 
business operations.
Business leaders must take responsibility for profiling of security 
risks and mitigation plans from a business perspective.
Exceptions
Security exceptions need to be monitored and managed. Over 
time, an exception may become a vulnerability or a risk.
Business must ensure they have capability to identify exceptions 
and manage exceptions over time to achieve desired risk 
resilience.
Dependencies
Every business outcome requires cross-functional, in many cases 
cross-­organizational, collaboration. The management needs to 
understand interdependencies to effectively manage the security 
risk in any business operation.
Organization must profile internal and external dependencies 
across people, process, technologies, and information assets.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

45
Secured Business Model Capability Maturity 
Levels as a Value Road Map
Every organization, regardless of the industry, must ensure that the security 
risk resilience is in alignment with the business engagement model and 
organization’s goals. In the previous chapter (see Figures 2-1 and 2-3), 
we explained the business engagement model, how an organization can 
determine the engagement type and corresponding security risk resilience 
level. Each risk resilience level requires a set of organizational capabilities 
and practices. So, the obvious question is what are those capabilities for a 
risk resilience level? In the previous section, we identified five performance 
domains (5 Ps) of the secured business model. Each of these performance 
domains can be further described in the form of a capability maturity 
model, where a maturity level can be viewed as capability requirements to 
achieve a level of risk resilience.
Figure 3-2 summarizes the capability maturity model for each of the 5 
Ps in the secured business model. The detailed, up-to-date maturity model 
of all capabilities in the 5 Ps can be accessed from securedbusinessops.com.
Figure 3-2.  Secured Business Model Summary Capability Map
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

46
Each maturity level identifies what capabilities an organization must 
have across the 5 Ps. This model is not about how an organization will 
accomplish these capabilities. We will be discussing that in the next 
chapter.
The capability maturity model is a progressive and cumulative 
model, that is, capabilities at one level builds upon the capabilities at 
previous levels. It also means that an organization must have capabilities 
from previous levels to be considered for the next level of maturity. For 
example, at a lower level of maturity, an organization may only consider 
preventing unauthorized access to a physical location or systems storing 
critical business information. As the organization expands interaction 
with customers and partners, the organization must prevent unauthorized 
access to business transactions and documents, achieving the next level 
of maturity. Depending upon the nature of collaboration and use of digital 
assets, organizations may need to enhance its capabilities in preventing 
unauthorized access to distributed content, further driving the level of 
maturity and risk resilience.
Because of the progressive nature of the capability maturity model, 
it can easily be used as a value or capability improvement road map. 
As described in Figure 2-3 in the previous chapter, an organization 
that is already a connected business or seeking to be one, the target 
risk resilience level should be at least level 4 – Competing. It means, 
business management should be prioritizing and planning capabilities, 
and monitoring progress toward level 4. The capability gap between the 
current and desired state defines the improvement road map.
It is expected that an organization may not be at a particular level across 
all 5 Ps. It is possible that an organization might have focused on a few select 
capabilities or overinvested in some capabilities to address specific situations 
or in response to market news. Just like it is hard to stay comfortable and stable 
while sitting on a stool with legs of varied sizes, organizations can’t ensure 
and sustain secured business operations if the organization does not make 
progress toward the required maturity level across all 5 Ps.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

47
In a large organization with multiple business segments or 
organizational units, it is quite possible that various segments may be at 
different maturity levels. It is not important that all of them be at the same 
level of maturity, but it is critical that each segment is at the right level for 
the required risk resilience in business activities performed by the people, 
processes, and systems in that segment. Using the secured business model, 
each segment can evaluate its current state and identify the desired state, 
and use the gap for developing the improvement road map.
Secured Business Model Is a Bridge 
Between Business Engagement 
and Operating Model
In Chapter 2, Figure 2-9 described the connected layers of the Secured 
Business Operations. The Secured Business Model is the critical layer 
between business engagement and the secured operating model. Business 
leaders and managers own the responsibility and accountability in 
defining the state of business engagement and required capabilities across 
5 Ps in the secured business model. The following Figure 3-3 shows the 
correlation between various business engagement models and 5 Ps of 
secured business model.
Chapter 3  Secured Business Model

48
Once the required capabilities in the secured business model are 
defined, the organization is ready to evaluate and plan capabilities in the 
secured operating model. The next chapter provides details of the secured 
operating model.

CHAPTER 4
Secured Operating 
Model
The operating rhythm without the predictable behavior in 
sensing and responding to the events that we didn’t anticipate 
is a fire drill.
Realizing Secured Business Operations
The objectives, the requirements, the plans – help us create a desire for 
change and define a direction, but they are not sufficient to ensure we 
get to our intended destination. In Chapter 2, we discussed the business 
engagement model for defining the level of risk resilience required to 
support secured business interactions with customers, partners, and 
employees inside and outside the organizational boundary. In Chapter 3, 
we discussed the secured business model with five performance domains 
(5Ps), providing a set of capabilities and their desired levels of maturity for 
a given risk resilience posture. Both the business engagement and secured 
business models are designed to guide business management in defining 
and justifying the outcomes, that is, what and why the organization must 
achieve for safe and secure business operations.

50
In this chapter, we focus on how organizations can achieve and sustain 
secured business operations. The secured operating model provides 
an actionable body of knowledge in understanding, identifying, and 
implementing necessary operational capabilities for realizing the desired 
outcomes defined in the secured business model. Why the secured 
operating model when we have many operational frameworks such as 
NIST 800-171, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001/27002, and many others? There is 
no doubt these frameworks provide a depth of knowledge that no single 
person or organization can develop and organize. These frameworks 
focus on security policies, procedures, and controls, providing a highly 
prescriptive content for auditors, implementers, and practitioners. It 
is left up to the organization to figure out the extent of relevancy and 
develop a road map for implementing policies, procedures, and controls. 
Organizations tend to underplan or overengineer the implementation 
due to lack of structured understanding, alignment, prioritization, 
and business case for policies, procedures, and controls in the context 
of organizational and business capabilities. Just like when digging a 
hole, it is difficult to be wide and deep at the same time, most of these 
technical frameworks provide an excellent depth in cybersecurity and 
risk management but tend to ignore other capabilities needed to drive 
overall organizational maturity and effectiveness even in their area of 
focus. The secured operating model provides the bridge between what 
the organization wants to secure in the form of a secured business model 
and the specific best practices and implementation described in these 
frameworks. Figure 4-1 articulates the dependencies and relationship 
between various layers of the body of knowledge in achieving and 
sustaining secured business operations.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

51
The secured operating model includes a set of core capabilities along 
with their maturity levels. The model also includes underlying practices 
derived from various best practices and security frameworks. The model 
allows organizations to focus on the capabilities. It is the capabilities 
that enable organizations to sense, respond, and operate in a predicable 
manner even in previously unknown situations. Every time there is a 
security breach, it doesn’t do any good if the organization scrambles 
and comes up with an excuse of not seeing it before. With the secured 
operating model, the organizations can build and maintain the required 
capabilities to achieve and sustain secured business operations.
Components of Secured Operating Model
The secured operating model consists of twenty-one operational 
capabilities organized into the following six capability domains.
	 1.	 Business Management
	 2.	 Operations Management
Figure 4-1.  Secured Operating Model and Industry Frameworks
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

52
	 3.	 Risk Management
	 4.	 Compliance Controls
	 5.	 Master Data Management
	 6.	 Infrastructure Management
An organization may have a few or all the twenty-one capabilities 
listed in Figure 4-3. Even if an organization has these capabilities, they 
may not be at the desired level of maturity needed for secured business 
operations. Overinvesting in some and underinvesting in others don’t 
make organizations safe and secure. All capabilities need to be focused 
and sufficiently advanced to achieve and sustain the desired outcomes. 
Figure 4-2 provides a top-level capability map at various levels of maturity. 
This map can be used to understand where we are and where we need to 
be in operating practices, aligned with the required capabilities in the 5 Ps 
defined in the secured business model.1
Figure 4-2.  Secured Operating Model Summary Capability Map
1See Chapter 3 for the Secured Business Model.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

53
Although described as a capability maturity model, the capability map 
in Figure 4-2 is in fact a road map for planning operational practices. At 
any time, an organization may be at different maturity levels across the 
six capability domains. Over time, an organization cannot be too far out 
of step with maturity in each domain. For example, organization can’t 
be very high in risk management and remain very basic in master data 
management. Sustaining secured business operations is not just about 
preventing something from happening; it is also about responding and 
recovering when something does happen. Organizations need different 
capabilities for proactive prevention and predictive responses to the 
situations. Moreover, improvement in one capability may enable another 
capability or reduce the demand on another capability. For example, 
improvement in master data management may help the organization 
with improved change management and governance while reducing the 
time and efforts required for implementing and monitoring compliance 
controls. Therefore, it is critical for the organizations to evaluate, 
understand, and plan all twenty-one capabilities under these six capability 
domains for appropriate maturity in core operational practices.
Figure 4-3 outlines the critical operational capabilities in each of the 
six capability domains.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

54
The following pages provide a summary of twenty-one capability 
building blocks across six capability domains. 
Business Management
Business management represents a set of capabilities for the organization 
to plan, manage, and measure effectiveness of operational practices 
required for secured business operations. It is a business prerogative and 
issue to decide the extent the organization needs to be secured and ensure 
it is secured. The organizations must have relevant business management 
capabilities and practices. Business management, in general, may include 
many practices. For planning and managing the portfolio of people, 
process, information, and technology for secured business operations,  
Figure 4-3.  Operational Capabilities in Secured Operating Model
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

55
the following three operational capabilities are the most critical to develop 
and mature.
	 1.	 Change Management
	 2.	 Governance
	 3.	 KPI Measurements
These capabilities are not new or unique for business management. 
Many times, these practices do not sufficiently consider or incorporate 
security-related requirements and practices or account for the impact 
of security. These practices are leveraged to develop a desired maturity 
required for achieving secured business operations. Table 4-1 provides a 
brief description of the three capabilities.
Table 4-1.  Business Management
Business Management Capability Building Blocks
Change Management
Provide relevant awareness and training to all the 
workforce about the capabilities/services, keeping them 
informed and prepared in identifying and addressing 
new vulnerabilities that require human behavior in 
addition to systematic controls.
Governance
Establish a collaborative business and IT governance 
structure, associated processes, and committee to 
govern development, maintenance, and transitioning 
incremental/new capabilities to conduct business 
operations in a secured manner.
KPI Measurements
Define, measure, and monitor key performance 
indicators and metrics for security effectiveness and 
desired outcomes.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

56
The next section includes key practices for improving change 
management, governance, and KPI measurement in the organization.
Operations Management
Managing day-to-day operations is one of the core business activities in 
any organization. In the context of secured business operations, ongoing 
operational practices need to include activities related to maintaining 
secured operations. Therefore, Operations Management capability domain 
includes and primarily focuses on the following:
	 1.	 Process Management
	 2.	 Access Control Management
	 3.	 Audit and Monitoring
These operational capabilities are not new to the organization, which 
is good news. We just need to make sure these capabilities are enhanced 
so that business process design and execution are security aware and 
incorporates additional practices and measures for ensuring end-to-end 
secured business processes. Table 4-2 provides a brief description of these 
capabilities in a security context.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

57
These operational capabilities are quite interdependent and support 
each other. For organizational efficiency and effectiveness, all these 
capabilities should be advanced with appropriate design and automation. 
Figure 4-4 represents the relationship among these operational practices.
Table 4-2.  Operations Management
Operations Management Capability Building Blocks
Process 
Management
A process is a set of interrelated activities that interact to achieve 
a result, for example, secured supply change management, 
secured channel partner communication and management, 
secured banking, and secured collaboration. A governance 
committee is responsible for ensuring appropriate processes 
are created, automated, and managed to meet the required and 
relevant security objectives.
Access Control 
Management
To ensure business operations are being conducted in a secured 
manner, it is necessary that all the managed resources have 
appropriate access all the time. This capability ensures that the 
appropriate access is granted and managed all the time.
Audit and 
Monitoring
This capability is required to find out at any time who is 
accessing what managed resources, and if there are any 
malicious activates going on in the enterprise environment. Based 
on this knowledge, appropriate risks can be created in the risk 
register to manage such risks appropriately.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

58
The access control management is supported by process management 
and audit and monitoring.
Risk Management
There are known security risks to the business operations due to the 
known vulnerabilities and their threat level. The risk management must 
include proper criteria for the assessment, prioritization, and treatment 
of risks. In the previous chapter, we discussed the security profile as one 
of the 5 Ps, covering vulnerabilities, dependencies, exceptions, and risks. 
Any vulnerability or threat is a business risk, even if it is manifested in 
one of the IT systems or processes. In the secured operating model, risk 
management is about understanding, anticipating, and managing both 
business and IT risks. Ultimately, business leaders are accountable and 
Figure 4-4.  Operations Management Operational Practices
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

59
must decide the acceptable level of risk. Risk management capability 
includes the following:
	 1.	 Threat Management
	 2.	 Vulnerability Management
	 3.	 Exception Management
The threats, vulnerabilities, and exceptions are different, closely related 
terms. They are associated for managing assets. Figure 4-5 represents the 
relationship among managed asset, risk, threat, and vulnerability.
Figure 4-5.  Relationships Among Managed Asset, Risk, Threat, and 
Vulnerability
Managed Asset: Anything that generates value for the business is 
a managed asset. It could be people, physical items, and information. 
People are workforce users, including employees, customers, and partners. 
Physical items could be office properties, products, and services with 
tangible or intangible value. Information could be business data, software 
code, and other intangible items. Businesses try to protect a managed asset.
Threat: Anything that can exploit a weakness to damage or destroy a 
managed asset and against which a protection is required.
Vulnerability: A weakness that can be exploited by threats to gain 
unauthorized access to a managed asset.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

60
Risk: A tangible or intangible damage potentially caused due to a 
threat in your environment that exploits a vulnerability.
With these definitions, Table 4-3 defines each of the operating 
capabilities in the Risk Management domain.
Compliance Controls
Due to an interdependent ecosystem, and mobile and digital business 
information, every organization small or big needs to address 
confidentiality, privacy, and integrity of information. Many government 
and non-government entities have defined the range of controls for 
organizations to consider for conforming to compliance requirements or to 
address procedural or system risks. We have looked at hundreds of controls 
Table 4-3.  Risk Management
Risk Management Capability Building Blocks
Threat 
Management
Monitor and manage internal and external threats to business 
processes, information, systems, and assets anywhere.
Vulnerability 
Management
There can be many types of vulnerabilities that can pose various 
levels of threats to manage operations in a secured manner. 
These vulnerabilities could be in the Data area, Business 
Applications, Segregation of Duties, Lack of Policies and/or 
Rules, Network, Compute, Storage, Data Center, and in meeting 
ISO 27002, SOX, COBIT, PCI, and other types of compliance. 
Vulnerability Management helps in evaluating the level of threat 
and in mitigating threats by managing such vulnerabilities.
Exception 
Management
To manage exceptions that are covered by vulnerability 
management. Depending upon the type of exception, a special 
one-off solution may need to be devised, and that is why the 
focus should be on avoiding exceptions as much as possible.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

61
across various frameworks. In the secured operating model, we addressed 
the subject of compliance as a set of organizational and operational 
capabilities, supported by many of the security controls defined in industry 
frameworks. Table 4-4 lists these capabilities with their brief descriptions.
Compliance Controls as a capability provides the necessary business 
context, and a mechanism to prioritize and road map required controls for 
implementation and ongoing monitoring.
Master Data Management
Master data management is not a new topic. This is important for the 
secured operating model for two reasons.
	 1.	 The information security data domains such as 
Identity, Asset, Role, Policy, Dependency, and 
Glossary are not often considered as “master” data 
domains, even though they have organization-wide 
implications.
Table 4-4.  Compliance Controls
Compliance Controls Capability Building Blocks
Data Security
Data security means protecting data, such as a database, 
from destructive forces and from the unwanted actions of 
unauthorized users.
Segregation of 
Duties
It is the concept of having more than one person required to 
complete a task. In business, the separation by sharing of more 
than one individual in one single task is an internal control 
intended to prevent fraud and error.
Legal and Industry 
Compliance
Ensure conformance to generally accepted compliance 
requirements.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

62
	 2.	 The data associated with these data domains are 
equally critical for business operations as other 
business data domains, such as Customer, Product, 
Supplier, and Partner. The management of security 
and business data is critical for executing business 
transactions predictably, safely, and securely.
Before discussing the master data management capabilities, we must 
understand the master data management principles. The principles are 
Data Definition, Data Integrity, Data Security, Data Services, and Data 
Architecture. These principles are important and required for managing data 
domains, identities, assets, roles, policies, dependency, and data glossary.
Data Definition
It includes defining a data domain, its ownership, identifying associated 
data elements, and defining each associated data element. On the business 
side, the definition covers the meaning, ownership, and purpose. On the 
technical side, it covers the data design and its implementation details. It is 
important to take a business perspective, as data is owned by the business 
and business is accountable for defining it. The meaning of a data domain 
clarifies the business intent, ownership defines who in the business 
owns it, and its purpose clarifies its business usage. The associated data 
elements are identified in support of business intent and usage. The 
meaning of each associated data element must ensure its alignment with 
the business intent of its data domain. Each associated data element must 
have a unique business purpose. The purpose of each associated data 
element supports the business usage of its data domain. The illustrative 
examples are provided in the subsequent pages in the definition and the 
purpose of master data management capabilities.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

63
Data Integrity
The best way to understand this master data management principle is 
to first review and understand the dictionary meaning of Integrity. The 
origin of word integrity is from the Latin word integer, which means 
whole or complete. In mathematics, an integer is a whole number that 
has no fractions. The key characteristics of a dictionary meaning of the 
word integrity includes being honest and consistent with strong moral 
principles. Extending this definition into the dictionary definition of data 
integrity means the data is an exact copy of some original version, and 
it is absent from any unintended changes or errors in its static state or 
when it is transmitted or copied. In business terms, data integrity can be 
interpreted as the information represented by the data is validated, does 
not leave any ambiguity, and is authentic.
Data Security
Data security was covered under compliance controls from the regulatory 
requirements perspective. This master data management principle 
enables building foundations for achieving data security controls above 
and beyond compliance controls in business transactions. Business 
transactions rely upon master data, such as customer, product, identity, 
roles, and others. A typical business operation spans multiple business 
transactions. For secured business operations, it is imperative that data in 
a business transaction is secured. This is where data security principles 
go beyond achieving compliance controls. The data security principles 
include data uniqueness, data integrity, data access controls, data 
encryption, data decryption, and data storage. The business context, such 
as Sales Order, Accounts Payable, Customer Relationship Management, 
Market Intelligence, and others defines the usage and the characteristics 
of data security principles. The business context also helps in defining the 
requirements and cost considerations for data encryption and decryption.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

64
Data Services
Master data is foundational for all business transactions data. For 
maintaining data integrity and data security, it is critical that access and 
maintenance of master data do not become bottlenecks. Data services, 
strategically defined, alleviate this situation. Direct access of master data 
impacts performance for processing business transactions. That is why 
data services principles take the center place in master data management.
Data Architecture
In the information age, data is like a bloodstream for running the business. 
The human body is healthy and alive when uncontaminated blood is 
flowing smoothly through all its veins and arteries in the entire body. 
The human body has a two-circuit circulatory system. One is pulmonary 
(for the lungs) circulation and another one is systemic (for the rest of the 
body) circulation. The blood is oxygenated through the lungs and this 
oxygenated blood flows using the framework of veins and arteries through 
the rest of the body. Using this analogy, entire business data is managed 
between master data and enterprise data. Master data management 
conceptually establishes data integrity and security that is extended 
and further maintained through enterprise data management. Data 
architecture is the framework that is required for managing the master 
data and circulating securely the enterprise data for secured business 
operations. The framework for master data management consists of data 
design incorporating data definitions, data capabilities for maintaining 
data integrity, data security, and data services for enabling business 
operations data flows.
Table 4-5 lists the master data management capabilities.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

65
Table 4-5.  Master Data Management
Master Data Management Capability Building Blocks
Identity 
Management
Identities include digital representation of the entire workforce 
and other managed resources associated with the business. 
The workforce includes, employees, contractors, and partner 
and customer resources who are involved in the business. The 
digital representation includes the storing and management of the 
associated identities and attributes. This capability ensures that 
digital representation of the identities is securely protected and 
poses no risks in leaking the associated details.
Asset 
Management
Manage physical and nonphysical assets owned by the 
organization.
Role 
Management
For secured business operations, appropriate access is required 
for every consumer, and that is managed automatically by 
assigning appropriate roles to the consumer. The consumer may 
be a workforce resource, a process, a system or a device. The role 
management capability is required to assign an appropriate role to 
a consumer at the start of the relationship and then update the role 
to account for transitions and changes in relationships.
Policy 
Management
To develop, deploy, and maintain life cycle of policies, with the help 
of a governance committee, to conduct business operations in a 
secured manner.
Dependency 
Management
Secure end-to-end business operations by ensuring all the cross-
functional and organization dependencies are understood, well 
documented, and they all follow the same governance policies/
rules to achieve the goal of secured business operations.
Glossary and 
Life Cycle
Define all relevant terms so that their purpose and 
meaning are consistently understood and used across the 
business organizations and the ecosystem.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

66
The above capabilities are further explored with enabling practices in 
the next section.
Infrastructure Management
Securing business operations depends upon the infrastructure used 
for performing business activities. The security of infrastructure is 
the key focus area by every organization. As infrastructure is typically 
maintained by IT, this area does not generally get business management 
attention unless there is an incident impacting the business. To secure the 
infrastructure, many practices are considered and deployed, such as single 
or multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, firewalls, secured local area, 
wide area and wireless networks, and applications security. The Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI), Figure 4-6 model is an effective way to 
understand, at the conceptual level, the Infrastructure elements and their 
security needs.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

67
To better manage infrastructure security, we have organized 
infrastructure capabilities in three building blocks. Table 4-6 lists these 
capabilities with their brief descriptions.
Figure 4-6.  Open Systems Interconnection Model2

Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

68
There is a large published body of knowledge and vast cybersecurity 
industry focus on implementing security capabilities at the Infrastructure 
level. We assume that organizations have access to the information and 
have implemented many of the suggested practices. Our intent is to add 
business context and help business management to understand the need 
and extent of investment and management oversight required for secured 
business operations. The capability maturity map and correlation with 
enabling practices provides management the mechanism to assess and 
plan the right capabilities supporting the business objectives.
Practices for Secured Operating Model
In the previous section, we described the twenty-one operational 
capabilities organized into six capability domains. In this section, we 
explore specific and critical implementation practices supporting these 
capabilities.
Table 4-6.  Infrastructure Management
Infrastructure Management Capability Building Blocks
Network Management
Managing all the LAN, WAN, and WLAN infrastructure 
in a secured manner to prevent penetration into the 
Information boundary walls of an organization.
Data Center 
Management

damage of all Infrastructure components maintained in the 
data center.
Application 
Management
Managing all business supporting applications in a 
secured manner with appropriate access controls.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

69
Business Management: Change Management
Businesses are periodically making strategic and tactical decisions for 
innovating, improving profitability, improving top-line growth, improving 
bottom-line growth, improving brand value, expanding into new markets, 
meeting compliance requirements, and on and on. Any such decision 
requires either changing the existing capabilities or developing new 
capabilities. A new project is spawned to develop a new or enhanced 
capability. In today’s cybercrime environment, every project must have a 
security track so that the capabilities and developed solutions are secured. 
Most organizations follow internationally recognized standard practices 
for project management. Yes, over 18% of the projects fail. What does it 
mean? A failed project didn’t deliver on expectations, either a capability 
was not developed or delivered, or it was not successfully transitioned into 
operations. In many cases, the security implications and requirements 
were not considered early enough in the development and transition 
processes. Change management is an operational practice to ensure all 
factors, including security, are considered and managed for a successful 
delivery.
Without change management, it is not possible to determine 
requirements from an operational perspective for a new capability or 
enhancement to an existing capability. Without change management, it 
is not possible to gauge impact on existing operations or to understand 
the readiness and training requirements for business users. In addition, 
without change management, it is not possible to determine new 
vulnerabilities affecting the desired security posture.
Change management is a critical operational practice for business 
management. Writing about change management is not a focus of 
this book. Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under 
Any Conditions, by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber, is one of the 
recommended books for learning about change management. In the 
secured business model, we talked about change management policies 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

70
under the policy domain of the model. Change management as an 
operational capability and practice is required for supporting change 
management policies and secured business operations.
Business Management: Governance
Organizations generally have established corporate governance and IT 
governance practices for overall business management. Until recently, 
security was not the focus area of corporate governance. IT governance is 
primarily focused on technology standards and selection. The technology 
selection is typically based on industry ratings and reviews, and not based 
on the best fit for meeting the business requirements. This is generally 
the case with security solutions as security needs are not defined by 
business, and they are a risk-averse posture for the Chief Information 
Security Officer or IT management. The result is a continuous increase in 
spending on IT security while the business continues to incur financial 
damages from security incidents. Global spending is expected to be $101B 
in 2018 and $170B by 2020. As per world economy forum, businesses have 
security-related damages in the range of $400B–$500B with much more 
damage not being reported.
The accountability needs to be shared among business and IT 
management and the Chief Information Security Officer, mainly for 
defining the security requirements and supporting policies, rules, and 
controls. The responsibility for appropriate solution deployment and 
tools selection may remain with the Chief Information Security Officer, 
but the overall strategy and governance must be directed by the business 
leadership. The end-to-end secured business operations require cross-­
functional decision making and collaboration. An appropriate governance 
practice involving cross-functional business and IT executives, managers 
and subject-matter experts is required for ensuring timely decision making 
and sponsoring initiatives for achieving and sustaining secured business 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

71
operations. Figure 4-7 provides an example of a governance committee 
structure for establishing an operational practice of governing security 
matters.
The above governance committee structure has three layers. 
Steering Committee
The steering committee provides the leadership for security and other 
business portfolios. They manage any escalations from the operating 
committee. This committee sponsors security initiatives. This committee is 
generally presided by the Chief Operating Officer or an equivalent role.
Operating Committee
This operating committee is exclusively for security. This is formed with 
the help of middle-management leaders from all functional organizations. 
This team needs to be empowered to make security-related decisions 
based on the guidelines provided by the steering committee. This team 
should have authority to fund various related initiatives in the form of 
Figure 4-7.  Governance Committee Structure
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

72
projects. For some reason, due to a complex situation and/or due to 
costs involved, if this team is not able to make a decision, such an issue 
needs to be escalated to the steering committee for the decision making 
and for getting funding approvals. This committee is presided over by 
a chairperson who is selected with the motion issued by this team and 
the votes taken by this committee. As this is an ongoing committee, a 
chairperson should be on rotation and preside over this committee for a 
predefined duration of a year or so.
Analysts and Managers
This team of analysts and managers are subject-matter experts from 
different functional organizations. It consists of some static members and 
some who join this team on a demand basis. A lead manager presides over 
this team on a rotation basis and is selected the same way a chairperson 
is selected for the operating committee. Any issue (vulnerability, risk, 
dependency, or exception) that needs action due to lack of established 
rules and controls is assigned to this team. Based on the issue at 
hand, managers assign analysts and designate a project manager who 
manages the analysis and decides the on-demand resource(s) required 
for the project. The managers from this team help arrange on-demand 
resource(s). Based on the due diligent analysis, the project manager 
collects the facts to present the team findings and recommendations for 
enhancements and implementations of the existing rules and controls or 
for additional rules and controls.
Business Management: KPI Measurements
Key performance indicators are in common use to manage business 
growth. Targets are set, and through key performance indicators, growth is 
measured. The focus here is on secured business operations. The security 
of business operations directly contributes to business growth. There is a 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

73
direct relationship between achieving and maintaining a desired level of 
security and key performance indicators for achieving business growth. 
Some of the common KPIs for business growth measurements are reducing 
operational expenses, improving profitability, and improving sales.
The security of business operations is critical for achieving such KPIs 
for business growth. For illustrative purposes, the key element contributing 
to the operating expenses is cost of goods sold. This cost depends upon 
fixed and variable costs. The opportunity here is to control variable costs. 
The contributing factor is optimizing the operational processes and 
improving productivity. In the digital age, the critical element impacting 
productivity is not having the right access at the right time. Having the 
right access at the right time is the key factor of maintaining secured 
business operations. This way the related key performance indicator for 
secured business operations is granting the right access at the right time. 
The next illustration is for improving sales. Sales depends upon the sales 
force and the tools available to them for promoting sales, such as for a deal 
negotiation, for customer relationship management, for checking sales 
reports, and other such tools. Again, having the right access to the right 
customers and the right reports at the right time are critical for improving 
the productivity of the sales force that is critical for growing sales. Then, it 
is simple math: improved profitability is based on the improved sales and 
reduced operating expenses. Again, granting the right access at the right 
time is a key performance indicator for secured business operations. This 
is not the only key performance indicator for secured business operations. 
The right access available is critical, however, ensuring that this access 
cannot be hacked, the tool to which this access granted is protected, and 
that the information maintained must be prevented from any leakage. 
The key performance indicators for protecting the sales user credentials 
from hacking, protecting the tool from hacking, and preventing leakage of 
business information are all important for securing business operations.
The next critical element about KPI is its measurements. The business 
management is successful only if KPIs can be measured. The right targets 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

74
should be set for the key performance indicators, right measurements should 
be defined for the key performance indicators, and right reporting should be 
defined to measure status and progress of these indicators. The experience 
is that businesses are not focusing on defining such key performance 
indicators and in measuring the progress for achieving and sustaining 
secured business operations. That is why operational practice is required 
for KPI Measurements that contributes to the overall success of the business 
management.
Operations Management: Process Management
As for performing any business activity, a process is required and business 
process management is a standard operational practice. There are many 
approaches used, such as Lean Sigma, Six Sigma, Business Process 
Optimization, and others. To manage secured business operations, the 
same approaches can be used. Following the lean sigma, five phases – 
Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC), the process can 
be defined and controls can be established.
The security problem in a business operation could be from many 
reasons, such as access to managed asset(s) used for managing the 
business operations is not controlled, the information generated for 
business operations can be leaked, the integrity of information is at 
risk, the user credentials used to access the information are at risk to be 
compromised, the firewall in place is not suitable for the federated access 
for end-to-end business operation execution, and on and on. Using 
DMAIC, each of these problems or a problem can be defined, the problem 
potential damage can be quantified, the problem can be analyzed in detail, 
the solution can be put in place to improve the current situation; and 
through controls, the solution can be maintained.
For controlling the solution, a process management approach is 
required. The main thing to emphasize here is that the problem cannot 
be fully identified just by the Information Security Office or IT, rather, 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

75
business stake is required to not only fully identify the problem, but to 
quantify it, analyze it, develop a solution to mitigate the problem, and to 
properly control it.
Operations Management: Access Control 
Management
Managing access control is a key achievement for securing business 
operations. The life-cycle approach is required. The first-time access, 
ongoing access, and retiring the access, all three phases of life-cycle 
management, are equally important for maintaining the end-to-end 
security of business operations. Each business operation end to end 
performs a number of steps, where each step may require different 
managed assets, or more than one managed asset is used for executing 
end-to-end business operations.
Appropriate access needs to be granted to these managed assets for 
different users. Similarly, each managed asset may be accessing other 
managed assets for giving business-required capabilities. Each managed 
asset may be accessed by multiple users and/or each managed asset may 
be accessed by more than one other managed assets to provide business-­
required capability. For illustrative purposes, consider a voice service. 
It is a managed asset. It will require audio, instrument to access audio, 
means to communicate using voice, audio provisioning from the service 
provider, billing to a business user department, and few more related 
managed assets to provide voice capability for a business operation. From 
a security perspective, it is important that voice is not hacked as it is used 
for business conversations. All the managed assets described above need 
restricted access control and protection of voice communications. In brief, 
a simple capability, such as voice, requires a many-to-many relationship 
among managed assets as depicted in Figure 4-8.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

This is a simple illustration to convey the point that access control 
management involved the following:
•	
Workforce users (could be internal only or both, 
internal and external) managed assets, represented as 
digital ids
•	
Business Application-based managed assets, 
represented as digital ids
•	
Infrastructure-based managed assets, represented as 
digital ids
•	
Relationship among users and non-user-based 
managed assets
•	
Many-to-many-based access control among the 
managed assets
•	
Business Processes steps for the business operation
•	
IT Processes for the business operation
The complexity is added as businesses have many, several thousand 
to millions of workforce users internally and externally, and several 
thousand business applications and infrastructure-based managed assets. 
In addition, currently business transformations for growth and increasing 
profitability businesses are embracing services transformation, cloud-­
based business and infrastructure services.
Figure 4-8.  Many-to-Many Relationship Among Managed Assets for 
Managing Access Control Management
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

77
The hope is that the above complexities provide the perspective 
to understand why access control management is critical for securing 
business operations. Keep in mind the entire life cycle of access 
management, involving first-time access, access during hire-to-retire of 
a workforce user and non-human managed assets, termination of access 
control, and the need to be strictly controlled to minimize vulnerabilities 
associated with securing business operations. To securely manage access 
control, different operational practices are required from Figure 4-3 under 
Business Management, Operations Management, Risk Management, 
Compliance Controls, Master Data Management, and Infrastructure 
Management. In addition, capabilities from the secured business model 
and all five “P” domains covered in Chapter 3 are required to be used.
The intent here is not to leave access control management as a 
complex thing to manage; rather, the intent is to justify the criticality of 
it for securing business operations and provide approaches discussed 
in other operational practices to manage the life cycle of access control, 
systematically.
Operations Management: Audit and Monitoring
Audit and monitoring is not only a compliance requirement, but also, 
it is a critical operational practice for maintaining controls established. 
As stated in Chapter 1, for cybersecurity a significant proportion of the 
spending in billion dollars is allocated for fraud and data breach detection 
with emphasis on Security Analytics, Threat Intelligence, Mobile Security, 
and Cloud Security. The main purpose of security analytics and threat 
intelligence is to develop audit and monitoring capabilities for finding 
potential fraud and data breaches before significant damage is done and 
to be able to take proactive actions based on the set thresholds. It is like 
identifying unknown risks for risk management. The focus on mobile 
and cloud security is mainly due to the fact that growth for businesses 
is becoming more and more dependent upon business solutions being 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

78
developed, using cloud-based business services on mobile platforms. 
These solutions add more vulnerabilities to security if the access controls 
are not properly managed.
We talked about KPI Measurements as a business management 
operating practice. One of the key elements in KPI Measurements 
operating practice is the capability to measure for key performance 
indicators. Audit and Monitoring provides the means to collect relevant 
data. The good and commonly used KPI is for managing and controlling 
unwanted access controls by each workforce user. This is a compliance 
requirement as well. Companies have deployed a solution based on audit 
and monitoring to identify a user not accessing a particular tool or service, 
say for 90 days, and invokes user access after 90 days of the account 
remaining dormant. This meets compliance requirements, though it adds 
vulnerability for leaving the access to an account for so long. This is one 
of the use cases where security analytics and threat intelligence can help 
determine on a near real-time basis the unwanted access by setting up the 
right controls and minimizing the associated vulnerabilities by creating 
near real time to real-time audit and monitoring capabilities. By having an 
operational practice, it can be a part of your operations DNA to become 
vigilant by enabling smart audit and monitoring capabilities.
Risk Management: Threat Management
It has become clear that protection from threats is required. That means 
for securing business operations, threat management operational 
practice must add value. This value can be added by creating visibility of 
known threats, creating visibility of the managed assets having threats, 
understanding of potential risks associated with the known threats, and 
in prioritizing the known threats. To protect assets, certainly you need to 
mitigate these threats. In addition to that you should conduct root-cause 
analysis for mitigating the probability of recurrence of similar threats. 
This should be in the DNA of your business operational practices. Threat 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

79
management should not be practiced just when there is a security breach; 
rather this should be an ongoing operational practice. The overall value 
of that is the equivalent of increasing the immune system of your body by 
doing regular exercises.
Risk Management: Vulnerability Management
Vulnerability exposes the operational weakness that poses security risk. 
It means there is a direct value of strengthening operations by managing 
vulnerabilities. Healthy operations are like a healthy body. Like a healthy 
body that allows one to be more productive and creative, healthy 
operations allow organizations to be more profitable and innovative. 
Establishing operational practice for managing vulnerabilities means 
having the capability of registering vulnerabilities, understanding 
associated threats, understanding associated potential risks, and the 
capability to reduce or eliminate existing types of vulnerabilities. Having 
operational practice for vulnerability management means having ongoing 
associated capabilities to gain sustainable value.
Risk Management: Exception Management
In the context of security, threats, and vulnerabilities, exceptions are 
business situations that do not fit under threats or vulnerabilities, but pose 
risks with the potential of producing damages equivalent to the potential 
damages that can be produced due to threats and vulnerabilities. Due to 
such potential risks, exception management is equally important, if not 
more, to vulnerability and threat management.
The value anticipated of exception management is generally more 
than the value anticipated of vulnerability and threat management. This 
is due to the fact that by design, exceptions are difficult to register and 
understand. The risks associated with an exception are extremely difficult 
to comprehend. Exceptions are not regular and generally misunderstood. 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

80
Thus, having an operational practice to acknowledge, register, understand, 
and manage exceptions could be more valuable for securing business 
operations.
Compliance Controls: Data Security
In the United States, there are industry-specific data security regulations, 
like HIPAA for the health care industry. This is not like in Europe, where 
Global Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are enforced for the entire 
European Union to all twenty-eight European countries that are part of the 
EU and to all businesses, regardless of the industries they belong to. The 
GDPR are applicable outside the EU to any country having EU citizens. The 
purpose of this book is not to go into the details of individual data security 
compliance regulations. The point to emphasize here is that to ensure 
business operations comply with data security regulations, businesses 
need accountability. Businesses need to have operational practices and 
not leave it for IT to manage these regulations because these are data-­
related security requirements. Under the Master Data Management 
section, there will be more details covered that will assist in managing data 
security.
Compliance Controls: Segregation of Duties
It is called as separation of duties as well. The straightforward way to 
understand this is by using an illustrative example – a buyer cannot make 
payment for the items purchased. In the past, this was controlled merely 
by giving accounts payable authority to a different person. In today’s digital 
world, that is certainly a fundamental necessary requirement; however, it 
is not sufficient. It needs to be ensured that the buyer does not have access 
to an accounts payable automated utility managed asset. If this access 
control is not managed securely, not only does this vulnerability possess 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

81
risk to business operations, but it is also noncompliant as per segregation 
of the duties compliance requirement.
This compliance control is managed by business architecture by 
setting the right organization structures and creating appropriate roles. 
However, the automated tools in use require appropriate segregation 
of duty utilities and access control management to successfully meet 
the compliance control requirements. Based on our experience, 
businesses spend the bare minimum to meet compliance needs, but the 
vulnerabilities created due to not being able to achieve desired access 
controls pose threats to manage secured business operations. Again, 
who can manage these access controls? What is required for ensuring 
appropriate automated utilities are produced so that these access controls 
can be managed? Business needs to lead this in collaboration with IT.
Master Data Management: Identity Management
We discussed managed asset under the access control management and 
risk management sections of the secured operating model. These managed 
assets could be a workforce user (employee, consultant, contractor, 
supplier, customer, partner), IT infrastructure, process, business products, 
and service offerings. In short, a managed asset could be a human or non-­
human. The total number of these assets could be in several thousands, to 
millions, depending upon your organization size. As these are managed 
assets, these need to be tracked for securely conducting the business 
operations. Each asset is granted an identity in digital terms. Each asset has 
a life cycle as long as it is associated with the organization and contributes 
for generating value. Each identity is used in one form or another in the 
other business transaction. It acts as master data for executing a business 
transaction. At the same time, this is loosely managed by most companies 
without realizing the implications in securing business operations. To 
manage identities, master data management treatment is required so that 
there is a proper data definition for each managed asset type, data integrity 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

82
and security is maintained for each asset, and appropriate data services 
are provided for accessing identity data for business transactions.
Master Data Management: Asset Management
By now, it must have become clear that managed assets are critical to run 
the business. As discussed earlier, the identity management capability 
manages identity details of these assets for security purposes. As these 
are business assets, formal asset management is required. Business has 
distinct functions to manage different classes of assets, for example, HR for 
employees, contractors and consultants, Customer Service for customers 
who have relationships with the organization, Manufacturing for product 
development, Purchasing for vendors, etc. Each of these functions must 
follow an asset management methodology to manage the life cycle of these 
assets; the relationship among the assets; the value they generate; the time 
line of disposition of these assets; and, of course, the risk to quality and 
integrity.
Master Data Management: Role Management
To maximize return on assets, each managed asset has one or more roles 
to play in the organization. Based on the given role, an asset is granted 
access to other managed assets. To keep it simple, let us keep our focus 
on workforce users- the roles assigned to manage value, competency, 
and capacity. To maintain a level of separation, ease of management, and 
avoid unnecessary complexity, the access to various assets is granted to 
roles rather than directly to users. Roles are master data assigned to each 
workforce user, maybe one or more than one, for managing access control 
of managed assets. Figure 4-9 provides how the roles play a master data 
role for access control management.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

83
For access control management, roles are assigned to a workforce user 
identity based on policies defined by governance. To manage roles, same 
master data management principles, Data Definition, Data Integrity, Data 
Security, Data Services and Data Architecture are required.
Master Data Management: Policy Management
As depicted in Figure 4-9, access control management depends upon 
policies. These policies are defined and maintained by the governance 
committee. The policies are defined in collaboration with cross-functional 
business and IT management who are part of this governance committee. 
These policies are documented in plain English language for general 
understanding, yet actionable through access control management 
systems and procedures. Roles can refer the policy data to enforce 
access controls for securing business operations. As the policy data is 
referenced, it needs the same treatment as master data with principles 
of data definition, data integrity, data security, data services, and data 
architecture.
Figure 4-9.  Access Control Management
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

86
effective, and secured manner. It is critical to highlight security needs for 
inter/intra dependencies that can be linked to associated risks and/or 
vulnerabilities.
Master Data Management: Glossary 
Management
To interoperate and communicate, every organization needs a language, 
acronyms, and definitions of terms. Most organizations do have them but 
they are not used consistently across organization. They may have different 
meanings to different people. It is an issue when organization wants to 
have end-to-end secured operations across various functions, systems, 
processes, and people. Most organizations do not maintain the glossary of 
security terms. The key words in the previous statement are “organization” 
and “maintain.” The IT department may have a version of terms, but 
generally they are not published or publicized organization-wide. Other 
departments or groups do not attempt to contribute, as they consider 
security an IT responsibility. Where IT department creates a glossary of 
security terms, there may not be an ongoing effort to maintain it. Why is 
it important to maintain the glossary? The simple answer is to increase 
awareness of security, particularly cybersecurity, among the organization’s 
workforce. Without this awareness, it is difficult to keep people informed 
on security trends and to sustain secured business operations. To start 
with, use the lists of security terms maintained by the National Initiative for 
Cybersecurity Careers and Studies or by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology. Although the functional groups, such as marketing, 
engineering, and distribution, may have their own glossary of terms, the 
security terms are applicable to everyone inside the organization and any 
external entity with whom there are interdependencies. The glossary must 
be treated and managed as master data.
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

87
Master Data Management: Life-Cycle 
Management
Every data has a shelf life, and therefore, every data requires life-cycle 
management. Security data domains, such as identity, asset, role, policy, 
dependency, and glossary, are no different. As the operating environment 
or other things change in the organization, an adjustment is needed in 
security data to reflect the change. Timely and proper adjustments in the 
definition and attributes ensure ongoing data integrity, data security, 
data services, and data architecture for secured business operations. For 
example, a change in the job of a user due to promotions, department 
change, or for any other reasons may trigger an adjustment in user 
identity, role, assets, and access controls. If the user profile is not adjusted 
properly and timely, it could create an unwanted exposure, resulting in 
potential security threats. When an asset is replaced for any reason, such 
as end-of-life or new capability requirements, its association with all 
identities need to remain intact with the replaced asset, so that business 
operations have minimal to no impact and relevant users can execute their 
relevant processes securely and with same or better efficiencies. When a 
role is updated with new or different responsibilities, it may need a change 
in the things the role can access and perform. In such a life-changing 
event of the role, there might be a need for identities associated with the 
original role to continue to perform their operations and do not get any 
extra access, thus keeping current operations secured. The existing policies 
may not be sufficient in addressing change in the business conditions, 
business model or services, requiring a revision and updates to all other 
assets impacted by the policy. Managing dependencies, particularly 
interdependencies, can be complicated. For example, let’s say your 
business partner gets access to submit their orders with no export holds, 
as long as they maintain the embargo with the same countries as your 
organization. If the partner decides to lift the embargo from one of the 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

88
countries without getting approval from your organization, submits the 
order that passes export hold conditions, and the products get shipped 
to that country, this may pose security threats along with compliance 
violations for your organization. Ideally, the ability to submit the order to 
such a country must be adjusted with the life-changing event. Similarly, 
for the glossary term, if its meaning is expanded or reduced, or a new 
glossary term is added, it is imperative to timely publicize it so that people 
are aware and ready in dealing with new cyber threats. To protect business 
operations, it is very important to keep the workforce informed. It is quite 
clear that life-cycle management is mandatory for sustaining secured 
business operations. Master data management is critical for defining and 
managing the life cycle of each of the security data domains.
Infrastructure Management: Network 
Management
Network has become an operating system for an organization. It is 
like veins and arteries in the body for blood to flow across the body. 
Information is like blood. As the oxygenated blood is important for 
the functioning of the body, secured information is important for 
the functioning of the organization. The geographically dispersed 
organizations are connected using wide area, local area, wireless, virtual 
private network, and Internet configurations to seamlessly share and 
access information, and conduct business operations. To prevent leakage 
of information and protect business operations from hacking, secured 
network tunnels and firewalls are put in place by network management. To 
allow only authorized workforce users to access the organization network, 
only users recognized by Human Resources (HR) are granted access to 
the organization network. Nowadays, almost every Human Resources 
department has a step in the hire-to-retire process to grant timely network 
access at the time of hiring and revoke network access immediately at 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

89
the time of termination. The timely network access is critical as access to 
all other managed assets is based on the network access user id. Some 
organizations have a fairly comprehensive and efficient on-boarding 
process that may include provisioning of laptop/desktop with network; 
and access to office services, such as email, calendar, phone, and job-­
related applications and systems. This is possible only after Human 
Resources has successfully completed a new hire background check 
and has given the go-ahead to the Network Management team for 
establishing user credentials. The user id from these credentials is used 
for granting access to other core IT and application systems. The technical 
management of networks is beyond the scope of this book.
Infrastructure Management: Data Center 
Management
Most of the enterprise information in terms of data and documents, and 
enterprise services in the form of applications, are hosted in the data 
center. The data center computational and storage resources may be 
physically located on the organization’s premise, at the location of an 
outsourced service provider, or in the cloud as Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Therefore, we are focused on access 
security rather than physical security. Due to availability of high-speed 
connectivity at low costs, organizations have consolidated data centers. A 
few data centers and cloud have made it easier for organizations to secure 
infrastructure. Companies are using Cloud Access Security Brokerage 
(CASB) solutions, leveraging servers, storage, routers and switches with 
built-in security solutions. In spite of using security-aware equipment, 
the governance continues to be a critical element in ensuring definition 
and enforcement of security policies. The policies defined for securing the 
access to data center equipment should not be defined in silo and must 
be extensible to hosted applications and users. The extensibility helps in 
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

90
reducing points of vulnerabilities, starting with the network-level ids, in the 
chain of granting and managing access control for hardware, software, and 
users. Even if the application, such as Excel or email, is running on a user’s 
device, the information whether in files or databases may be stored on the 
geographical dispersed data centers and situated in a strategic data center 
location that is provisioned to a business user. Therefore, a securing data 
center is even more critical in this digital age. The security must not stop at 
the equipment level and must transcend at a user level for all the relevant 
managed assets.
Infrastructure Management: Application 
Management
Applications have been the foundation for enabling business process 
automation. Organizations prefer buying off-the-shelf applications than 
building them. Whether buying or building, the applications tend to serve 
individual business functions, and are hosted on a dedicated infrastructure 
for the functional organization. Therefore, in this configuration, the  
security requirements are mostly contained and managed within  
the application. With the digital transformation, organizations are  
adopting cloud-based services rather than deploying and maintaining 
applications in-house. These services tend to interact with other services 
in the cloud. While there are significant financial and performance 
benefits of using cloud services, there is an increased level of cyber threats. 
The service or application management must address the changing nature 
of the infrastructure, access, and integration. Just like line-of-business 
application services, cloud-based application management services 
provide an opportunity to simplify security policies and enforcement 
methodologies.

Using Secured Operating Model
Each of the twenty-one capabilities in the secured operating model is 
described as a capability maturity map with five maturity levels. The 
complete capability maps are available online at securedbusinessops.
com website. Organizations can use these maps to assess the current state 
of these capabilities. Based on the desired state of the secured business 
model, organizations can determine the required state of secure operating 
model capabilities. Figure 4-11 illustrates a maturity heat map of a secured 
operating model.
Figure 4-11.  Capability Maturity Heat Map
Chapter 4  Secured Operating Model

92
Without the business context, it is not fair to say anything low in 
maturity is not good, and anything in high is excellent. It is possible that 
organizations might be overinvesting in some areas, underinvesting in 
others, or just about right based on the business engagement model and 
business needs defined by the secured business model.
In the next chapter the details will be provided for how to achieve and 
sustain the desired maturity levels. These maturity levels enable you to 
maintain the secured operating platform that is necessary for achieving 
business vision and strategic goals. The structured execution is required 
once it has determined the desired maturity levels using the template 
described above.

Model
The sustainability is achieved by having a by-design culture of 
continuous improvement.
Sustaining Secured Business Operations
In previous chapters1 we laid out the framework to capture the body of 
knowledge for (a) determining the required risk resilience level for the 
business using the business engagement model; (b) identifying and 
developing a road map of secured business capabilities with the secured 
business model; and (c) assessing, planning, and enabling people, process, 
information, and technology capabilities with the secured operating model.
In this chapter, the emphasis is on those processes that can be used for 
achieving and sustaining secured business operations by understanding 
the top-down requirements of the secured business and operating model.

engagement model.
Figure 2-5 – secured business model with 5 Ps and associated 20 capabilities.
Tables 3-2 to 3-6 – appropriate capability maturity models.
Figure 4-3 – secured operating model with 6 process domains and 21 capabilities.

94
You can use the body of knowledge in these models to evaluate the 
current state with goals and objectives, identify the gaps in the existing 
capabilities, plan the improvements required for achieving the future 
state, and monitor the progress, as frequently as needed. For achieving 
and sustaining secured business operations, a security culture is required. 
This culture ensures that everyone, by design, considers appropriate 
information security during planning, design, and delivery of any change 
in business operations or in underlying solutions.
To create a right culture; to have a disciplined approach; to reduce 
the cost of development, maintenance, and governance; and to create a 
rhythm of security-conscious change – there is a need of a management 
model. This chapter focuses on the methodologies and approaches for 
operationalizing the models and body of knowledge in the framework for 
ongoing assessment and improvement of information security capabilities 
across the organization.
Most organizations have established capabilities of portfolio 
management, change management, value management, solution 
development, and project management. The management model builds 
upon these general-purpose organizational capabilities for managing 
information security. The way quality assurance has become a standard 
goal in every product/service offering by every organization, around the 
globe, security assurance for securing business operations would become a 
de facto standard in every company’s operations. The management model 
can help organizations create the mindset and culture of security by design.
The secured management model is a business-centric, value-­
oriented process model, addressing the complete life cycle of the security 
capabilities from envisioning to operations to ongoing improvements for 
sustainability. Beyond achieving mandatory compliance requirements, 
security assurance is considered a costly affair without realizing its direct 
and in some scenarios indirect benefits to grow sales, profitability, brand 
value among other things, such as improving the quality of operations. To 
operationalize any process for cost efficiency and broad adoption, it needs 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

95
a set of practices, a body of knowledge, and an information management 
solution. The management model incorporates all three design elements 
for an effective and efficient process.
Components of Secured Management Model
The secured management model is organized into four process domains 
for holistically achieving and sustaining secure business operations.
	 1.	 Assess
	 2.	 Plan
	 3.	 Improve
	 4.	 Manage
Each process domain includes a set of management practices. 
Figure 5-1 shows these four process domains in a high-level process flow 
with their respective underpinning practices.

96
ASSESS
This process domain can be used for a small context, like for deploying a 
cloud-based application or for a big context, like overall cloud-based digital 
transformation. It is used for understanding the change in the business 
engagement model, evaluating the information security risk based on the 
changes in the engagement model, understanding the desired goals and 
objectives, identifying the gaps in the existing capabilities, and deciding for 
the required capabilities for closing the gaps.
PLAN
This process domain includes practices for architecting capabilities, 
designing solutions, defining key performance indicators with supporting 
measurements for required capabilities, and creating a change 
management plan for the broader adoption of capabilities. The plan 
may include improvement or change in organizational structure, people 
skills and readiness, business processes, IT processes, and technologies 
for properly architecting the capabilities and designing the solutions. 
The outcome of the plan process provides a well-defined road map for 
implementing the changes needed for the capabilities identified in the 
assess process.
IMPROVE
This process domain is about action and making things happen. It includes 
the practices for implementing the solutions for changes planned for the 
required capabilities, transitioning the solutions into secured business 
operations, and ensuring the key performance indicators are measurable.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

97
MANAGE
This process domain includes practices for managing ongoing operations 
and governance of the capabilities and solutions. Through ongoing 
monitoring and oversight, new opportunities are identified and start the 
new cycle of assess, plan, improve, and manage.
There is no doubt that a repeatable process requires a range of 
best practices. Organizations may have many of these practices. These 
practices tend to use their own tools, templates, and body of knowledge 
in a disjointed manner resulting in creating discontinuous and inefficient 
outcomes. For processes to be sustainable, efficient, and effective, and 
practices to be adoptable, organizations need a unifying platform for 
a continuous planning and improvement process. The platform must 
provide quick and timely access to the information, and must enable 
the continuity of information, decisions, and activities across the full life 
cycle of continuous assessment, planning, and monitoring. With the goal 
of achieving and sustaining secured business operations, the authors 
not only developed the framework shared in this book, they have also 
developed a platform to operationalize the framework.
The platform, called CAMP, includes four pillars of capability-driven, 
business-centric, and outcome-oriented assessment, planning, and 
ongoing management.
	 1.	 Capability Management: addressing business 
and security capability modeling, assessment and 
planning.
	 2.	 Architecture Management: addressing enterprise 
architecture, including business and technology 
architecture components, standards, dependencies, 
life cycles, solution patterns, etc., for each capability 
or business/IT service in the organization.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

98
	 3.	 Maturity Value Management: addressing strategic 
planning, road maps, operational and business 
performance metrics, maturity, and risk assessment.
	 4.	 Portfolio Management: addressing organization, 
management, assessment, and planning of various 
business and IT portfolios such as services, 
technologies, assets, projects, people, and relevant 
details.
We live in an environment of constricting budgets with increased 
focus on value and time to delivery. To continuously deliver high value 
with ever-shrinking resources, it requires an innovative yet predictable 
approach to perform various activities related to portfolio building, 
analysis, planning, and monitoring. CAMP accomplishes this goal without 
compromising quality and outcomes by effectively combining people, 
process, information, and technology. Figure 5-2 articulates the overall 
approached embedded in the CAMP platform.

Body of knowledge represents a collective wisdom, experiences, 
practices, and facts from operations, industry, academia, and subject-­matter 
experts, covering all aspects of enterprise portfolio. As the saying goes, why 
reinvent the wheel. The body of knowledge includes the models for secured 
business operations, along with many other sources of information, such 
as ISO, NIST, ITIL, APQC, Innovation Value Institute, and other relevant 
sources. The body of knowledge helps to discover “un-­knowns” quickly and 
accelerate their assessment and planning. This can dramatically increase 
the mutual understanding of the business and IT capabilities.
Value Management Platform is a technology-based service for 
planning and managing enterprise capabilities and portfolio. It hosts and 
leverages body of knowledge to plan, transform, monitor, and manage 
any portfolio initiative from intent to operations. The information in the 
platform is accessible to various people in the organization to learn and to 
make their own informed decisions, at any time.
Accelerators represent the art and science of security capability and 
portfolio management. One can think of accelerators as a collection of 
engagements, activities or use cases, such as Business and IT Portfolio 
Assessment, Portfolio Rationalization, Security readiness, Capability 
Assessment and Planning, Cloud Readiness, Technology Risk Assessment, 
and Planning, etc. Each accelerator includes a defined body of knowledge 
configured in the value management platform, methods, and templates.
With body of knowledge, value management platform, and 
accelerators, organizations can do the following:
	 1.	 Develop and maintain the knowledge base
	 2.	 Iterate over Assess-Plan-Improve-Manage cycle
	 3.	 Empower and enable knowledge transfer
In the next section, we provide additional details on the key 
management practices in each process domain for achieving and 
sustaining secured business operations.

Key Management Practices
The secured management model includes 15 key management practices 
across the four process domains. While the process domains outline the 
end-to-end life cycle of continuous improvement, the practices within 
each domain outline the steps and activities involved to achieve top-­
down and bottom-up alignment with the business engagement model, 
secured business model, and secured operating model. Every process 
or practice is actionable in a plug-n-play mode with a set of inputs, 
actions on the inputs, and produce outcomes. In addition, to facilitate 
and support an end-to-end continuous improvement methodology, the 
secured management model provides the flexibility with components for 
planning and managing security capabilities as part of the overall business 
and IT portfolio or within the context of a project. As we describe these 
management practices, we will highlight the key activities and outcomes 
from the perspective of managing the portfolio and a project.
Assess Process Domain Practices
Any journey, short or long, starts with knowing where you are and where 
you want to be. Under the Assess process domain, the emphasis is on 
assessing the risk posture practice along with the standard practices of 
understanding goals and objectives and the current state of security. 
Figure 5-3 provides the high-level viewpoint of the Assess process domain 
with inputs used by its practices to produce relevant outcomes.

The inputs to the Assess process domain are the drivers for change, 
organizational scope, and related portfolio information. In case of portfolio 
planning, the scope can be all aspects of the organization, whereas in 
case of a specific project, the drivers and scope are determined by the 
project. The drivers and scope are not necessarily specific to security 
capabilities or requirements. The drivers and scope provide the context for 
understanding risk and identifying required security capabilities.
To evaluate the organizational portfolio and capabilities, organizations 
need a body of knowledge with a capability maturity model and an 
assessment framework. In the previous chapters, we have described 
the business engagement model, secured business model, and secured 
operating model. These models are used to evaluate various aspects of 
the organizational scope and organization portfolio of plans, capabilities, 
processes, people, and technology solutions. These models provide 
the content, structure, and knowledge for assessing the current state 
and defining the desired state of the organizational capabilities and 
competency.
The assessment process is more than finding the gap in the 
capabilities. The supporting financial business case is required as part 
of the assessment to justify how by achieving the goals and objectives 
in a secured manner will produce value and returns on investments. In 
addition, a value management platform, discussed earlier in this chapter, 
is used to leverage the body of knowledge and to quickly and consistently 
assess the organization.
Below is the detailed explanation of each of the three Assess practices.
Assess: Risk Posture
In Chapter 2, we introduced the Business Engagement Model. This model 
helps organizations identify the extent of access and interaction with 
people, processes, and systems outside the physical boundary of the 
organization. Knowing the level of engagement is critical for identifying 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

102
the acceptable and unacceptable risk exposure, and, in turn, the required 
information security capabilities. Most businesses have a risk officer at 
an enterprise level with the focus on business risks. Security risks are 
generally not under the portfolio of a risk officer. IT departments have 
information security officer who focuses more with a bottom-up approach 
and technology perspective to determine and resolve security risks. The 
security risks pose business risks. The business risk officer, reporting 
under the business and information security risk officer, reporting under 
IT, poses risks that can be mitigated by designing the appropriate business 
organization architecture.
At the start of every initiative, the team should ask the question: In 
what ways will internal and external people and processes access and 
interact with systems and information to perform the activities and create 
the desired outcomes? The risk posture can be assessed by adopting the 
5W1H methodology – Why, What, Where, When, Who, and How – for 
gathering information for documenting in the risk register for resolving 
risks.
Below are the sample details that can be maintained in this register:
•	
Risk – Name of the risk, for example, customer data 
theft
•	
Description – Passing unencrypted data in online 
transactions
•	
Source – Could be a vulnerability, inter/intra 
dependency, or an exception, for example, customer 
data vulnerability
•	
Business Impact – High, can impact brand
•	
Business Scenario – Call center issues escalated to 
customer service managers for resolution
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

103
•	
Location – South East Asia
•	
Identified By – Who identified this vulnerability
•	
Identified Date – The date this vulnerability was 
identified
•	
Resolution – Accept the risk and encrypt the customer 
data as soon as it is captured
•	
Approved By – Who approved the resolution
•	
Approval Date – The date resolution approved
The risk register should guide the rest of the assessment, planning, and 
improvement process.
Assess: As-Is Environment
Understand the controls in place for securing business operations. These 
controls cover all of the compliance in place, policies, and processes in 
place for managing secured authentication, provisioning, access controls, 
and authorization management for all types of business operations. 
Understand the documentation available for these controls. Understand 
the governance in place for managing the life cycle of such controls. 
Determine the mix of decision makers’ cross-functionally represented in 
the governance committee. Determine the capabilities in place to manage 
the as-is environment.
All the items described above can be stored as a body of knowledge 
in CAMP platform. The as-is environment is dynamic and changes on an 
ongoing basis. CAMP can be leveraged for keeping the as-is environment 
current by maintaining it on an ongoing basis. This would enable iterations 
for Assess-Plan-Improve-Manage and not make this a one-time effort.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

104
Assess: Goals and Objectives
The secured business operations’ goals and objectives are defined in the 
business engagement model, secured business model, and operating 
model. Here, in the management model, the goals and objectives of the 
drivers for change, input into the Assess process domain, are understood. 
These goals and objectives are assessed and the security aspects required 
are aligned with secured business operations goals and objectives. This 
alignment is done based on understanding the success factors defined by 
the business and the existing key performance indicators in use.
Based on the understanding of goals and objectives, risk posture, and 
the as-is environment details, the future-state environment is visualized. 
Conduct the detailed analysis to determine the gaps in the existing 
capabilities and as-is environment to achieve the visualized future state. 
Determine the gaps in the key performance indicators for achieving the 
success factors.
Once the outcome of the Assess process domain, which includes the 
business case, prioritized gaps, and the future-state success factors with 
KPIs, is produced and finalized, the Plan for achieving and sustaining 
secured business operations is produced. This plan includes evaluation 
of the existing portfolio and prioritization of gaps to determine the new 
projects; programs are required to mitigate these gaps and a road map is 
developed to sequence these projects and programs.
Plan Process Domain Practices
The Plan process is mainly to develop a design-level plan for the 
capabilities and changes identified during the assessment process. The 
assessment outcomes are planned to optimize the improvement efforts. 
Figure 5-4 provides the high-level view of the inputs, practices, and outputs 
during the planning phase of the end-to-end continuous improvement 
process.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

105
As success without a plan is not possible, planning security is not a 
new topic for companies. The question is what is being planned and by 
whom.
The mandate mostly comes from the office of the Chief Information 
Security Officer, who reports to the CIO. Are those mandates aligning with 
business objectives? Are there measurements in place ensuring business 
success from growth, profitability, and/or a productivity gains perspective? 
Are such plans ensuring security of business operations? How and who 
from business resources are involved in making such plans? Are these 
plans documented and audited? Business is changing constantly, so who 
is responsible for the life-cycle management of these plans? The point 
we are making here is that for achieving and maintaining the security of 
business operations, top-down business alignment is a must, and tight 
collaboration between IT and cross-functional business functions is 
required. If the overall mission of the company is to achieve and sustain 
secured business operations, the planning must include all aspects of the 
business and technology involved.
The following practices are key for creating a detailed plan for 
achieving the stated goals and objectives for secured business operations.

Plan: Architect Capabilities
Most organizations jump to the technology solution as soon as a problem 
or a requirement is identified and approved. Most of us have seen the 
statistics suggesting over 70% of the projects fail to deliver on the promise. 
The real issue is in creating the sustainable value by the capabilities 
enabled by these projects. To generate sustainable value from the new 
capabilities, before defining the technology solution, focus on architecting 
the capabilities.
Capabilities describe what business wants to do safely and securely 
whereas solutions describe how capabilities are enabled at any given time. 
One can’t really identify, let alone design, the right solution without first 
developing the capability architecture. The architecture scope depends 
upon the organizational scope and dependencies identified in the 
assessment phase.
Follow the enterprise architecture approach to architect the 
enhancements required in the existing capabilities and/or to develop 
the new capabilities by aligning business architecture with technology 
architecture. The CAMP platform central repository can be leveraged to 
maintain these capabilities and associated architect details. This allows 
you to enable maintaining capabilities architecture details enhancements 
iteratively that allow tracking the maturity level of capabilities and measure 
the results for the desired success factors.
Architecting capabilities includes the following outcomes:
•	
Enterprise architecture details for enhancements to 
existing capabilities and for new capabilities.
•	
Identification of business and IT services required to 
offer these capabilities.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

107
•	
Identification of projects and programs to develop 
these capabilities and services.
•	
Developing high-level plan details in the form of a road 
map developed for identified projects and programs, 
based on the architecture interdependencies and the 
priority of gaps.
Let us understand the details of these outcomes. As there is the 
misnomer about the enterprise architecture, the outcome produced is 
not just a technology solution; it covers business architecture, conceptual 
technical architecture – ensuring alignment between them. The business 
architecture includes business skill sets required, organization structure 
changes required, if any, and high-level business requirements to 
eliminate the gaps through enhanced or new identified capabilities. The 
architecture maps the business requirements to capabilities, and the 
conceptual technical architecture provides the functionalities required 
to meet the business requirements for eliminating the gaps. The business 
and IT services identification is the expected outcome, but is not generally 
produced; however, we recommend doing so. The business and IT focus is 
increasing more toward becoming lean in managing their operations, and 
shared services is the answer for that, both from the demand and supply 
perspective: the demand in the form of business services and the supply 
in the form of IT services. The identified project, programs, and plan costs 
are estimated at a high level to ensure the costs estimated to generate 
the business case during the Assess process still hold true. Otherwise, a 
corrective appropriate action should be taken to architect the capabilities 
within the estimated costs. Using these outcomes, ensure design details 
are developed for achieving business success that can be measured based 
on the key performance indicators.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

108
Plan: Design Solutions
We all recognize that technology is only part of the solution, yet most 
solution development methodologies are centered on technologies. 
A good risk management or security solution may be better served 
by improvement in processes rather than implementation of a new 
technology solution. The outcomes from architecture capabilities practice 
are used to develop the following:
•	
Logical architecture details for the enhancements to 
the existing capabilities and for new capabilities.
•	
Shared IT services design by consolidating business 
services requirements.
•	
Validation of the identified projects and programs with 
scope details for capabilities and services.
•	
Actionable refined plan details for validated projects 
and programs.
The business logical architecture covers identification of processes 
required for mitigating the gaps, resources required in the form of 
numbers and in what business organizations with associated costs detail. 
The technical logical architecture covers identification of functionalities 
required to meet business process needs, the number of technical 
resources required, and in what IT organizations with associated costs 
detail. The shared IT services design covers the identification of existing 
IT services and additional services required and mapped to IT services 
required to meet business services requirements. Based on the scope 
identification for different projects and programs, the final project and 
programs are identified with associated scope details. These projects and 
programs could be for business, IT, or combined for execution together by 
business and IT team members. The cost details are calculated for each 
project and program. Based on all these scope details, cost details, and 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

109
design details, the feasible actionable plan is developed for the execution 
and improving the existing environment for achieving the future-state 
environment.
This is all part of designing the solutions required for achieving and 
sustaining the security of business operations. We suggest that designing 
solutions produce a solution architecture that should be organized into the 
following dimensions:
•	
Services architecture, providing the outward-facing 
view of the solution in the form of business and 
technology services and their building blocks.
•	
Information architecture, addressing the data 
ownership, classification, sharing, integration, and life-­
cycle management.
•	
Security architecture, incorporating appropriate 
controls, procedures, and measures for secured 
business operations.
•	
Technology architecture, analyzing the technology 
options, and developing the implementation pattern 
for the selected option.
•	
Operations architecture, addressing the ongoing 
operational characteristics, for example, monitoring, 
business continuity, performance, and support.
The logical next step is to ensure relative key performance indicators 
(KPIs)  are defined for the success factors identified in the business case.
Plan: Define KPIs
Key Performance Indicators are required to measure the effectiveness of 
the secured business operations in contributions for achieving success 
factors identified in the business case. What do you mean by effectiveness?
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

Figure 5-5 identifies business operations components.
Business operations are comprised of business processes, business 
applications, or services to execute business processes, technical 
components or services enabling business applications or services, and 
supporting technical infrastructure. People with relevant business and 
technical skills execute these business operations, and generate business 
information and business value.
The goal is to secure these business operations and be able to measure 
the effectiveness. Why do we need to make business operations secure?  
We need to protect these from the following:
•	
virus, malware, spyware, and other such intrusion 
elements;
•	
phishing emails;
•	
unwanted access control;
•	
violations in the noncompliance of segregation of duties;
•	
industry specific noncompliance;
•	
delays in granting the right access at the right time.

The above reasons all look important, but the effectiveness will be 
determined based on whether securing the business operations enables 
achieving the business goals and objectives or not. The business-related key 
performance indicators are defined during the business planning. The ones 
that are defined under this secured management model are to measure 
the effectiveness of improvements made in securing business operations. 
They have a narrow focus on the drivers for change and identified areas 
for improvement. Still, these KPIs need to be in alignment with the already 
defined business KPIs. With the detailed understanding and design of 
capabilities and solutions, the end-to-end value flow map2 can be created. 
The value flow map ensures alignment of KPIs and capabilities.
Organizations may have the capability to measure and monitor lagging 
indicators, that is, the KPIs that are impacted only after a process has 
executed, for example, revenue, inventory, cash flow, etc. Organizations 
find it difficult to measure and monitor leading indicators, that is, the KPIs 
which provide us insight into the future and enable us to course correct 
the process for desired outcome. Instrument these leading KPIs into the 
solution so that they are collected and predictively monitored. We have 
dedicated Chapter 6 on Security Effectiveness, and there we will further 
explanation about the associated key performance indicators.
Plan: Change Management
The execution plan is not for just creating new capabilities or enhancing 
existing capabilities for achieving and maintaining the desired security 
resilience for your company, but also for ensuring proper adoption and 
transition into operations of new and enhanced capabilities.
The change management as a capability has been discussed in  
Chapter 4 under the secured operating model. A capability for change 
management means that the organization has relevant skills in helping 
2Sample value flow maps are available from The Value Council (vsrcouncil.org).
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

112
project/program teams create and execute change management plans. 
From the project management office, a template and resources for creating 
and executing the change management plan can be offered. Still, this 
template would need to be tailored to a specific project/program needs 
perspective.
The main thing to remember is that in the scope of a change 
management plan, there should be a focus on the following two areas:
	 1.	 Increasing the adoption of new/enhanced 
capabilities,
	 2.	 Smooth transition of new/enhanced capabilities 
into secured business operations.
The change management plan needs to be part of the project plan and 
it should not be stand alone. The new or enhanced capabilities or services 
are developed and deployed as part of a project. Their adoption and 
transition into operations must be the responsibility of a project manager 
who is accountable for the project.
To summarize, under Plan process domain collectively, the following 
outcomes are generated with the help of its four management practices 
to architect capabilities, design solutions, define KPIs, and create change 
management plan:
•	
Future-state architecture and design,
•	
Identified project and program including change 
management plan details,
•	
Finalized road map with actionable plan.
Every project makes decisions. The decisions may involve choosing a 
technology or an architecture approach, changing the priorities and scope 
of capabilities planned, or assuming things that may have impact on the 
organization beyond the project. These decisions must be aligned with the 
overall enterprise governance principles, standards, and policies.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

113
Define and design the capabilities and solutions aligned with the 
organizational governance framework. Justify exceptions.
These planning practices produce the desired capability and solution 
architecture, a project plan with cost estimates and change management, 
and an updated road map incorporating new learnings, decisions, and 
dependencies. These outcomes are executed with the help of the Improve 
process domain that we will be explaining next.
Improve Process Domain Practices
The Improve process domain is about implementing what has been 
planned for improving the current state to the next state of capabilities. 
Figure 5-6 provides the high-level view of the inputs, practices, and outputs 
during the improvement or implementation phase of the end-to-end 
continuous improvement process.

We assume most organizations have project management and solution 
delivery disciplines. So, let’s focus on practices that can help produce 
better outcomes from these disciplines, particularly in the context of 
securing information in business operations. We would like the following 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

114
key principles added and enforced in development and deployment 
methods, regardless of organizational scope and nature of the solution:
•	
Secured by design, that is, ensuring every choice is 
reviewed and selected and is a best fit for achieving 
the stated goals and objectives, and does not introduce 
unacceptable barriers to innovate for the organization.
•	
Connected by design, that is, no solution can stay 
in isolation; therefore, even if there are no explicit 
requirements for interoperability and integration, 
the solution should not create a constraint and 
unnecessary complexity for enabling collaborative 
processes.
•	
Value by design, that is, any trade-offs during the 
solution development should be mindful of value 
promised and expected.
•	
Operations ready by design, for example, whatever 
is deployed, whether process or technology, is 
supportable, scalable, maintainable, recoverable, 
upgradable, and measurable.
The following practices are key for developing and deploying 
capabilities and solutions with the above design principles for achieving 
the stated goals and objectives for secured business operations.
Improve: Build and Validate Solutions
Whether developing a process or a technology solution, we always have 
choices how we build and deploy. Add objective, measurable criteria 
for evaluating options and selecting the best fit, balancing current and 
anticipated needs with by-design principles, organizational constraints, 
and governance. Having strong project management organizations that 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

115
can create, manage, and execute a portfolio of program and projects for 
building and validating the solutions designed and architected using 
Plan management practices. Once the solutions are built and validated, 
these need to be offered in a way a business can consume these easily. For 
consumption, the next important step is to transition these new/enhanced 
capabilities and services into operations.
Improve: Transition into Operations
In addition to the functional capabilities, there may be a need to manage 
information produced or consumed by new capabilities for secured 
operations. The last mile is as important as the first mile. Anticipate what 
needs to be implemented to manage ongoing operations of the capabilities 
and solutions and implement them as part of the deployment. The goal is 
to improve the security of business operations. That is possible only if the 
new/enhanced security capabilities and services can be transitioned into 
operations. The project plan should cover plans for how to transition these 
solutions into operations. This may require adding additional resources 
having required skill sets to operate. The next step is that the business has 
visibility of the new/enhanced capabilities and services and can leverage 
them for securing the business operations. The change management plan 
is important for making it happen.
Improve: Execute Change Plan
Value is created or realized from new capabilities when individuals change 
their behavior. Even if the solution automates or eliminates activities, 
people may continue to perform them. Adopting a change is difficult, as 
it requires coming out from the comfort zone. Adoption is critical for the 
success of the project and in achieving the desired outcomes. Execute 
the change plan developed during the planning phase. This may require 
appropriate training to increase the awareness and readiness, establishing 
a community of practice, and monitoring use and experience.
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

116
Improve: Ensure KPIs Are Measurable
The key performance indicators are effective when they can be measured. 
The business process and supporting data need to be available for the 
measurements. During the Plan phase, when the key performance indicators 
are defined, the plan must include identified measurements along with the 
requirements for measuring. The solution must include the required process 
elements and automation ensuring these measurements can be enabled. 
Chapter 6 will cover more details with the relevant examples.
Based on the improvements made, the future-state environment is 
transitioned into operations by producing the following outputs:
•	
Desired capabilities and services,
•	
Organization readiness,
•	
Operational and KPI monitoring.
The new and enhanced capabilities and services are for creating 
the future-state envisioned based on the architecting capabilities 
management practice in Plan process domain. The purpose of the future-­
state environment is to make organization ready for enhancing security 
capabilities and services offered to secure all business operations. In 
addition, the operational and KPI monitoring enable the sustainability of 
the security of the business operations.
Manage Process Domain Practices
The cycle does not end when the solution is transitioned into operations. 
From the business perspective, it has just begun. During the manage 
process, the organization starts realizing the return on the investment. 
Once the capability is achieved, like a secured business operation, there 
is a need to sustain it. Sustainability requires ongoing monitoring and 
nurturing of the solutions and capabilities in place, detecting areas of 
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

117
improvements for continuing relevance, and sensing change in business 
for the next round of opportunities and value.
Figure 5-7 provides the high-level view of the inputs, practices, and 
outputs during the management process of the end-to-end continuous 
improvement process.
Most organizations have been investing in service operations for quite 
some time with varying degrees of maturity in service monitoring, life-­
cycle management, and portfolio management. At the same time, many 
organizations lack effective business process management and value 
management, resulting in lower than expected benefit realization, high 
cost of risk management, and increased complexity to maintain secured 
business operations. Rather than refocusing on what organizations might 
have, we share and emphasize key practices that organizations need to 
sustain secured business operations and realize value. The following steps 
or practices are key for managing and sustaining capabilities and solutions 
for expected risk resilience and business value.
Manage: Operate Solutions
To secure business operations, the capabilities or services available need 
to be managed both by business and IT. Remember, business needs to 
define the operational requirements for security policies, procedures, and 
business services. Based on these, IT will offer systems’ corresponding

operational policies, procedures, and IT services. The operational practices 
need to cover end-to-end life-cycle management of related capabilities 
and services.
When a new capability or service is put in use, there are business 
expectations to generate value from it and that value is expected to 
increase with time.
Figure 5-8 shows the value curve during the life cycle of any capability/
service. As the value starts decreasing, there is a need to enhance the 
capability/service functionality to optimize the value curve. The other 
three management practices under manage, “Measure KPIs,” “Identify 
Improvements,” and “Develop Action Plan” are leveraged to measure 
generated value and enhancements required and made for optimizing the 
value curve of any operational capability and/or service.
Manage: Measure KPIs
The key performance indicators are defined in the Plan phase and ensured 
these are measurable under the Improve phase. These KPIs measurements 
provide the value generated. It is important to regularly measure these 
KPIs. Without measurements, it is not possible to ensure whether the 
LIFE-CYCLE
VALUE
Figure 5-8.  Life-Cycle Management Value Curve
Chapter 5  Secured Management Model

119
operational solutions are valuable or not anymore. As in the Figure 5-8 
life-cycle management value curve shows, after reaching the peak value, 
there is degradation in the generated value by the same solutions. That 
does not mean that a capability or service has gone bad; rather that means 
the business conditions have changed and the same capability or service is 
not as effective in the current business conditions. That leads to the need 
to identify improvements in the existing solutions.
Without measurements, it is not possible to know or predict the 
effectiveness of the processes and solutions implemented; their ongoing 
value to the organization; or when is the right time to retire, replace, or 
refresh the solutions and decide whether the operational solutions are 
valuable or not anymore. With measurement data, machine learning, and 
predictive algorithms, organizations can develop predictive models and 
improve both strategic and operational planning of security and other 
capabilities.
Manage: Identify Improvements
The business goals are always to generate maximum value from the 
solutions used to manage the business operations. These solutions are 
offered in the form of capabilities and/or services. During the life cycle of 
any capability or service, when the KPIs reflect the target measurements 
are not achievable, this means that improvement opportunities need to be 
identified.
Figure 5-9 shows a pictorial view point of when to focus on 
improvements for reestablishing target value generation from each 
capability and/or service. The improvement opportunities can be 
identified even from the beginning of deploying a capability or a service in 
production operations. However, the real need to apply improvements is 
only after the target value expected to be generated is not achievable. The 
other reason is for continual improvements to improve value generation. 
The other source for considering improvements in existing capabilities

and/or services is when a new driver for a change is identified by business. 
The identification of improvements is critical, but we all understand that 
without deploying these improvements, it is a futile exercise. The next 
logical step is to conduct strategic planning to develop an action plan for 
deploying these identified improvements.
Manage: Develop Action Plan
The implementation of identified improvements is a critical step to 
improve value generation. The implementation is a costly affair. There are 
always many capabilities and/or services that would need deployment 
of identified improvements in the portfolio of security capabilities and/
or services. The budgets are always limited. This gives you the need 
to prioritize the list of capabilities and/or services as part of strategic 
planning to develop the action plan. This prioritization is not only required 
to be done purely based on financial reason. The main criteria to prioritize 
must always be business damage for not implementing the identified 
improvements and missing the targeted business value expected.

121
Once the priority is finalized for each capability or a service in 
this list, the action plan needs to be developed for implementing the 
improvements. The Improve: Build and Validate solution management 
practice is leveraged to execute the developed action plan.
Based on the outputs generated by Manage process domain, the 
existing capabilities maturity level may need adjustments to address the 
new vulnerabilities identified in the new drivers for change and to identify 
improvement areas.
The opportunities for improvements are strategically prioritized in 
the action plan for further assessment and analysis. The opportunities 
are evaluated and prioritized for all things business cares about, such as 
cost, risk, time to deliver, business growth, cash flow, competitiveness, and 
customer equity.
The strategic action plan is developed for the prioritized list of 
capabilities.
Conclusion
A project, program and portfolio differ only in organizational scope. The 
management practices discussed in the secured management model 
are relevant and applicable to all kinds of projects. For secured business 
operations, there may be security-specific capability requirements. In 
many cases, organizations may just need to include security-related 
assessment and planning in all projects to achieve and sustain secured 
business operations.
In the last three chapters, we have explained the framework and 
components of the secured business operations. The business engagement 
model, secured business model, secured operating model, and secured 
management model, collectively, provide the body of knowledge for 
achieving and sustaining secured business operations. Any framework in 
isolation can lead to overengineering in some areas and underinvesting

122
in others. Particularly in case of security and compliance, fear alone is 
not good justification. In addition, we have reviewed how this overall 
framework complements industry frameworks, like NIST 800-171,  
NIST 800-53, ISO 27001/27002, and many others for achieving and 
sustaining business operations.
In the next chapter, we explore the model for measuring security 
effectiveness.

CHAPTER 6
Security Effectiveness
Measuring effectiveness is fundamental for driving adoption 
and progress toward goals. Customer-centricity is a prerequi-
site for defining effectiveness.
Current State of Measures
Considering that Information Security is, at best, a governance topic in 
the boardroom and the accountability is assigned to the IT department, 
the metrics for measuring security effectiveness, if any, are IT-centric and 
operational in nature in most organizations. Many of these metrics can be 
categorized into the following:
	 1.	 Process-based measures, for example, how many or 
what percentage of assets are regularly patched with 
the latest software updates, how many intrusion or 
service denial attempts are detected per month.
IT has processes for managing and monitoring 
infrastructure security. The related metrics measure  
communicate the organizational coverage and 
performance of these processes.

124
	 2.	 Fear and Compliance measures, that is, the number 
of audit findings, penalties, fear or risk thermometer.
Organizations, where compliance is a prerequisite 
to be in the business, have control metrics for 
monitoring and ensuring compliance. These metrics 
tend to be a count of required practices, procedures, 
and policies. Typically, these metrics are used in 
knowing the existence of the compliance controls, 
rather than measuring the effectiveness of these 
controls.
Security capabilities and investments are primarily 
justified based on fear. External news and events 
create a fear of potential financial and nonfinancial 
damage, causing management to respond. Similarly, 
many other people, particularly in technology 
groups, consider every vulnerability a risk that 
must be avoided or eliminated. Certain fear or 
vulnerabilities are addressed depending upon how 
loud they are and who is impacted. Fear and risk 
can be great motivators for analysis and actions, but 
they are not sufficient to monitor and measure the 
effectiveness of security practices.
The above measurement practices are a reflection of how security 
capabilities are planned and managed, and who in the organization are 
responsible or are concerned about them. In Chapter 1 and 2, we argued 
that current practices are not sufficient for achieving and sustaining 
secured business operations. How do we know what is working? How do 
we know what must be done? How do we know how effective the remedy 
or solution is? These questions require additional measures to understand, 
estimate, and monitor the effectiveness of any security improvements in 
the organization.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

125
Effectiveness Defined
To make sure we are measuring the right thing, we first need to define what 
do we mean by the term – effectiveness. When is something effective?
We consider an innovation in medicine to be effective when it 
eradicates the disease it was targeting. We view our sales strategy or 
actions to be successful and effective when we acquire new customers 
without losing money in the process. We accept and adopt a solution that 
makes us more productive without any friction or extra effort.
Can we say that over $100 billion spent on IT security is effective when 
cyber attacks continue to cost businesses over $400 billion a year? Do we 
consider a security control effective if it does not allow employees to work 
remotely? Is a solution acceptable and effective when it is too expensive to 
afford?
Based on the analysis of patterns of effective and noneffective actions, 
we propose the following definition:
Something is effective when it allows achieving an objective or 
an outcome at an acceptable cost.
An objective or outcome is associated with an operational or strategic 
goal of anyone in the organization. It can be financial, risk, performance, 
skill, process improvement, product innovation, or anything else of value. 
We also live in the world of constraints. We may be able to achieve an 
objective, but it may come at a very high cost. Effectiveness is like a two-­
sided coin. For a solution or intervention to be effective, it must enable 
the desired outcome at a cost the organization can afford. We recognize 
that people are driven by their own needs. In an organization, individual 
needs must be aligned with or within the context of the organizational 
objectives.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

126
What Is An Organization Trying to Achieve?
Every organization or business, regardless of industry, profit/nonprofit, or 
public/private sector is on the mission to achieve the following:
•	
Continuously innovate the business or organization.
•	
Run the business efficiently and predictably.
•	
Drive the business equity in its brand and culture.
•	
Keep the business viable and relevant to its 
constituents.
Figure 6-1 summarizes the typical objectives and drivers of an 
organization.
No organization can stand still and survive on the past successes. 
Organizations need to continuously innovate products, services, and 
processes for growth, new business models, digital transformation, or 
driving customer-centricity. At the same time, organizations cannot ignore 
what keeps the organization working every day. Everyday activities need 
to be operationally predictable, efficient, productive, and governance 
compliant. In addition of being innovative and operationally excellent, 
organizations are also interested in continuously building its equity.  
Figure 6-1.  Organizational Objectives
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

127
Equity provides the sustaining power and organizational ability to 
transform. Anything that improves profitability, builds the brand, creates 
the desired culture, drives customer’s confidence, and avoids unnecessary 
risk will support the equity objectives. Figure 6-1 list high-level, broad 
organizational objectives. As we walk down the organizational structure, 
these objectives should become the outcomes of various decisions and 
activities performed at each level of the organization.
Anything and everything anyone is doing in an organization, must be 
aligned and in support of one of these objectives. One side of the effectiveness 
coin represents producing the desired outcomes as stated or implied by the 
above objectives. The other side of the effectiveness coin is about the cost of 
realizing the outcome. So, anything and everything anyone is doing to produce 
the desired outcome must be at a cost that the organization can afford.
What Is An Acceptable Cost 
for the Organization?
To know whether a cost of a capability, operation, or solution is acceptable 
or not, we need to first define what do we consider a cost. Figure 6-2 
outlines the key cost elements addressing direct and indirect costs of 
acquiring, maintaining, and using a capability.
Figure 6-2.  Capability Costs
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

128
The cost of performance includes the cost of implementing, 
maintaining, and ensuring availability of the capability, process or 
solution, and underlying dependencies. This is the cost of performing the 
capability.
The cost of time includes people’s time in delivering, responding, 
dealing with any interruption or disruption, and managing the capability. 
Some organizations may consider this cost as a soft cost or indirect cost.
The opportunity cost represents the missed opportunities in using the 
investments for some other purpose. With a finite amount of available time 
and money, to gain something, something else must be sacrificed. To fully 
comprehend the total cost of a capability, it must include the impact on the 
organization from missed opportunities due to the resources consumed by 
the capability in question.
What Is Effective?
Just like buyers see value differently, the measure and magnitude of 
effectiveness can be different for various stakeholders. Business managers, 
business users, IT management, customers, and suppliers may expect 
different outcomes and may accept different costs. Therefore, the 
effectiveness must be understood and communicated in the context of 
a stakeholder. Individual objectives of various stakeholders, although 
aligned with organizational objectives as in Figure 6-1, are specific to 
their scope of work. The stakeholders will consider a capability, process, 
or solution to be effective only if it supports their objectives at the cost 
they can afford. As much as individual stakeholders are driven by their 
needs, the person or team responsible for delivering new capabilities 
must account for the needs of all key stakeholders for overall effectiveness 
from the organizational perspective. Later in the chapter, we introduce 
a value flow map for connecting objectives, KPIs, and capabilities 
across stakeholders for understanding, communicating, and ensuring 
effectiveness.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

129
Why Are Security Efforts Perceived as Not 
Effective or Too Expensive?
It would be wrong to suggest that security measures are not effective. Most 
of the security measures are put in place to avoid the incidents. When 
security practices detect and remove spams and malware before reaching 
their destination, thwart unauthorized attempts to access sensitive 
information, or ensure all devices are up to date in protecting from viruses, 
they are achieving the desired objectives of avoiding downtime, leakage of 
proprietary information, and a public relations headache. Like a product 
warranty, consumers or users don’t think of the product quality as the 
product continues to work. The day there is an issue with the product, they 
question the quality of the product. Similarly, when most of the security 
efforts are about avoidance, stakeholders may not think of the value of 
efforts. They question the cost of these efforts when something harmful 
gets through the door. A flu vaccine does not guarantee that person will not 
have the flu, but it does reduce the odds, and in most cases, succeeds in 
avoiding the flu. Preventive and recovery security efforts may be working 
but may not be visible to people to realize their effectiveness.
At the same time, there are certain practices that may be creating 
the perception that security efforts are not effective or too expensive, for 
example:
•	
Overengineering the process or solution.
Engineering minds tend to drive for perfection. 
Security is one area where it is very hard to reach 
perfection. Even if possible, achieving 100% 
prevention may be too expensive. At some point, 
engineering prevention may cost more than 
recovery efforts.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

130
•	
Risk mitigation is the only objective.
No doubt, fear and risk are the primary drivers for 
safety and security. Security efforts are perceived 
less effective when they take a risk-averse posture 
rather than being risk aware. We tell people to take 
measured risk to achieve bigger rewards. Security 
is no different. Some risks should be acceptable as 
they are manageable.
•	
Trusting prevention and underinvesting in recovery 
capabilities.
Of course, prevention is a better cure, but at what 
cost? In most cases, IT is driven by technology 
solutions, hence the bias toward implementing 
preventive solutions. Depending on the total cost 
of the solution, and the frequency and likelihood 
of the incidents, it may be prudent to implement 
appropriate processes and controls for enabling 
quick detection and recovery.
•	
Measuring and communicating activities, not 
necessarily the outcomes.
In many cases, security-related metrics are 
focused on operational activities, such as incident 
detection, mean time to fix, patch latency, and 
people awareness and training on security policies. 
These metrics are good for the people performing 
or responsible for the underlying activities; 
however, they are not enough for the people who 
are positively impacted by these activities. If people 
are left to their own interpretation and justification, 
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

131
most likely they will miss the significance of the 
metrics to their own activities. Therefore, it is 
important to relate how improvements in one’s 
activities help improve stakeholders’ activities and 
their outcomes. Use the value flow map, discussed 
later in this chapter.
Perceived value and effectiveness of security efforts is like an 
interpretation of a half-filled glass. Whether you look at the glass half full 
or half empty, business/IT leaders and security professionals need to 
do a better job in ensuring security efforts are measured and managed 
for effectiveness in terms of enabling organizational objectives at an 
acceptable cost.
Principles of Security Effectiveness
Defining, measuring, and communicating security effectiveness is not 
an art and is not subjective. It simply requires a disciplined approach to 
identify who the customers are, what do they care about, and how security 
capabilities can help them achieve what they want at the cost they can 
afford. To make it practical and repeatable, we have defined three by-­
design principles for security effectiveness, leveraging the framework we 
have described in previous chapters.
The three by-design principles are the following:
	 1.	 Start with what and why, not how.
We all like to solve problems. It is easy to focus and 
get caught up in the design of the solution. Before 
we start thinking about how we are going to solve 
the problem, we should have a clear understanding 
who the stakeholders are, what metric they are 
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

132
managing or would like to see improve, and what 
capabilities will enable them. This helps formulate 
the overall picture with dependencies and value for 
appropriate and effective solution selection.
Value flow mapping is a visualization technique 
for building the road map from solution to 
stakeholder’s value. See the next section for details.
	 2.	 Do the right things with a customer and business 
mindset.
Many times, the solution or process designs are not 
effective because of the assumptions and ignorance. 
We assume stakeholders do not want to take risk. 
We ignore other non-security drivers. Recognizing 
everyone in the organization has internal or external 
customers and works toward an organizational 
mission, to be effective, everyone must put 
themselves in their customer’s shoes and take a 
holistic view of the customers.
How do we know and plan what we don’t know? We 
have discussed the Secured Business Operations 
(SBO) framework in previous chapters. Use 
the framework to understand, align, and plan 
security capabilities based on organizational and 
stakeholders’ objectives.
	 3.	 Don’t just measure what did or didn’t happen. 
Measure the change in capabilities and outcomes.
Knowing what happened or didn’t happen is important 
for any root-cause analysis or immediate impact  
of an action. It is critical that we measure change.  
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

133
New value is created only when there is a change 
in actions. Measure change in your actions, your 
customers’ actions; and to be extremely effective, 
change in customers of your customers. Measuring 
across a three-degree of separation provides the 
insight into the extent and quality of alignment and 
effectiveness.
In addition, capability maturity levels are excellent 
indicators of competency and competitiveness. Use 
the maturity models included in the framework 
discussed in this book.
These principles are interrelated and interdependent. The body of 
knowledge in the Secured Business Operations framework can help build 
the initial value flow map. The value flow map is used to define the desired 
state and success factors, and guide the priorities and design options. The 
following sections in this chapter provide further insight and guidance in 
driving and ensuring effectiveness of security efforts.
Becoming Effective with Value Flow Map
To be effective in clapping, that is, to be loud and clap longer, we need 
both hands. In an organization to be effective in producing the desired 
outcomes, it requires many hands. Resources, activities, and information 
must be competent, connected, and coordinated for creating outcomes. 
When an outcome leads to the next outcome, and so on, we have an 
effective organizational value flow map.
The value flow map was originally introduced by Jack Keen of The 
Value Council in the book, Making Technology Investments Profitable. 
Since then, we have worked with Jack in refining the value flow map, and 
applying it to capability-oriented planning.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

134
There are three distinct components in the value flow map, addressing 
why, what and how.
	 1.	 Detect and influence the upstream outcomes. 
These outcomes are generally stated in the form of 
financial or operational measures. These measures 
represent the destinations.
	 2.	 Articulate both upstream enabling and their own 
capabilities. These capabilities represent what is 
needed, that is, the competency in producing the 
desired outcomes.
	 3.	 Identify underpinning solutions or practices 
required to improve individual or organizational 
capabilities. These solutions and practices represent 
how the organization will build the competency, 
that is, the ingredients for getting there.
To be predictive in ensuring effectiveness and proactive in 
communicating value, the value flow map for any organizational, functional, 
or solution scope must include all three components. Figure 6-­3 provides an 
example of a value flow map for security-related capabilities.
Figure 6-3.  Value Flow Map
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

135
On one hand, depending upon the point of view, the value flow map 
can be traveled in either direction. On the other hand, building the map is 
not always linear. As it is about learning, alignment, and ensuring flow, it 
takes a number of iterations to build the map.
At the top or far left of the map are strategic and financial measures. 
These are the outcomes that the organization and management 
leadership are seeking. To reach strategic or financial outcomes, many 
times improvements in operational measures are required. Therefore, 
we identify enabling operational measures on the map. The other half of 
the map defines what and how we could achieve the desired outcomes. 
The capabilities are the organizational, business, or functional activities 
required to achieve and maintain operational, financial, or strategic 
measures. Innovative solutions or practices such as new technologies, 
new methods, new skills, and new thinking help organizations improve, 
automate, eliminate, or transform day-to-day activities. In isolation, every 
solution may be right and worthy of investment. In terms of being relevant 
and effective, there must be a clear line of sight between measures and 
solutions. In the value flow map, it is accomplished through capabilities. 
Once the various organizational measures, enabling capabilities, and 
solution options are plotted on the map, they are connected to create and 
communicate the road map to value. Figure 6-4 highlights a road map to 
value using a value flow map.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

136
A clear path to value from solution to capabilities to measures, or the 
other way around, allows everyone in the organization to make the right 
decisions and avoid chasing shiny objects.
When developing a value flow map, people generally ask, what 
should be the granularity of measures, capabilities, and solution 
characteristics? Our typical response is to go wide and deep until 
you have what you need to know to make an informed decision. The 
higher the unknowns and complexity, the greater the effort required in 
developing the value flow map.
If you have customers, internal or external, you can use a value flow 
map for your services to clearly understand what your customers want to 
accomplish and how your services can help them. If you are dependent 
on others, you can use a value flow map to define the requirements and 
to ensure your suppliers are providing the solution you need. You are 
effective when value is flowing across the map.

137
Doing Right with Business Mindset
The great warranty does not compensate for a bad utility. For a product 
to be useful, it must be fit for its purpose. For it to be effective, it must be 
useful and available when needed. In the security domain, because of 
fear, most professionals are risk averse, that is, tend to have the mindset of 
risk avoidance. No doubt, the risks that can be avoided must be avoided. 
At the same time, at best, we can only avoid the risks we know. From 
the business or customer point of view, it is about having a product that 
meets their needs with an appropriate operational warranty. The warranty 
means that the product works as expected most of the time, and in case 
something does go wrong, there are procedures in place to recover quickly 
and safely. It will be a waste of money to buy flood insurance in a non-­
flood zone. A B2B manufacturing organization has a different risk profile 
than a consumer or financial institution. It won’t make sense to implement 
the same policies and solutions in both types of organizations. So, to be 
effective, security planning needs to be contextual.
There are two ways to become business aware in security capability 
planning. The conventional way is by asking people in the business. It 
relies on the assumption that people know what they need and why. In 
most cases, what they know and plan is based on the past and present 
issues. People can only plan what they know. Therefore, the conventional 
approach tends to lead to break-fix or incremental improvements. In the 
age of crowd sourcing and predictive modeling, there is another approach 
that uses knowledge models to determine where an organization needs 
to be, what will it take to get there, and then consult with stakeholders to 
align, prioritize, and plan. The knowledge-based approach allows us to not 
assume, but anticipate business needs. With that understanding, we can 
be effective both in the short and long term in designing and delivering 
capabilities. In other words, we are managing risk, not avoiding risk.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

138
In previous chapters, we introduced the framework for secured 
business operations. It starts with the business engagement model. 
Rather than taking the extreme view by avoiding every possible security 
risk, business and security professionals can identify the right security 
risk posture and required resilience level by understanding the extent of 
interaction the organization has with people and processes inside and 
outside the organization. Regardless of the scope of the initiative,  
project, or solution, any security planning and governance can only 
be productive and effective when the business engagement model is 
known. See Chapter 2 and Figure 2-3 to understand the level of business 
engagement and corresponding risk resilience required. Use the business 
engagement model to determine what kind of business you are today 
and what you want it to be. The engagement model drives the maturity in 
underlying business and operational capabilities.
The framework includes a well-organized body of knowledge in the 
form of capability maturity models, enabling practices, dependencies, 
and KPIs for assessing and planning business and operational-level 
capabilities. See Chapters 3 and 4 for details on the secured business 
model addressing business capabilities and the secured operations 
model addressing operational capabilities. Leverage these models to 
quickly learn, anticipate, and assess what business might need and what 
capabilities are already in place. Share the model and assessment with 
stakeholders for further alignment, prioritization, and planning.
People are risk averse because of fear of the unknowns. The models 
help convert unknowns into knowns, thereby enabling people to become 
risk aware. Addressing business needs while managing security risk is the 
answer to be effective.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

139
Measuring Change and Outcomes
Change is a leading indicator of value. If you are a solution provider in 
the value flow map, the change enabled by the solution is the change in 
capabilities. Therefore, if you want to assess how your efforts or solutions 
are or might be creating value, monitor the change in business activities 
caused by adopting the solution. If you are performing a business activity, 
up-stream change will be the change in business outcomes. So, to know 
how effective the business activities or capabilities are, measure and 
monitor the expected outcomes.
The value flow map provides the continuum from solution to 
capabilities to outcomes. The value contribution or effectiveness can be 
measured and articulated by tracing the flow map.
Key Measures for Security Effectiveness
Ultimately, the security practices are effective when they produce the 
expected outcomes for the stakeholders. Therefore, the ultimate measures 
for effectiveness are the outward measures, that is, the performance 
measures of the stakeholders. Typically, the outward measures have two or 
more degrees of separation from where security practices are performed. 
It is not always easy or it may take some time to see the impact on these 
outward measures. Therefore, we must have inward measures or leading 
indicators, measuring the extent and performance of the security practices 
and their impact on the immediate customers or users of these practices. 
The following Table 6-1 provides guidance on potential measures.
Chapter 6  Security Effectiveness

140
The above table is not an exhaustive list of measures. The framework 
for secured business operations includes relevant KPIs for specific 
capabilities in the secured business model and secured operating model. 
The value flow map, discussed earlier in this chapter, is an effective way for 
identifying and measuring relevant measures for the organization.

Measure to Manage
In previous chapters we shared the framework and body of knowledge 
for planning, designing, and managing secured business operations. 
In this chapter, we discussed how organizations, particularly security 
professionals, can articulate and measure the effectiveness of capabilities 
and practices, thus avoiding overengineering or barriers to business 
innovation. The framework with a clear set of measures enables 
organization to achieve and sustain secured business operations 
while continuously transforming the organization to meet customer 
expectations. In the next and final chapter, we share use cases and 
approaches for making it real for your organization.

CHAPTER 7
Making It Real
The journey of a thousand miles starts with one step at time. 
To keep going, keep taking the next step, however small it  
may be.
—Chinese philosopher Laozi
What Have We Learned?
Seamless connectivity, personalized products and services, real-time 
collaboration and transactions, automation, predictive insight and 
actions, use of public or shared infrastructure – these are some of the 
transformations many organizations are exploiting or exploring to be 
competitive, productive, and responsive. No doubt, these transformations 
are making organizations open and easy to do business with. These 
transformations are also making organizations more vulnerable and 
exposed to information thefts and cybercrime threats. If the security 
efforts in your organizations are not producing the desired results or 
increasingly becoming cost prohibitive, something must change the way 
the organization plans and manages security capabilities. In previous 
chapters, we have discussed the potential changes required and shared the 
framework for holistic and proactive management for secured business 
operations. In this chapter, we are summarizing the key takeaways and 
share a few use cases.

144
	 1.	 Security is a business issue, not only a technology 
issue. Therefore, business management can’t 
afford to delegate planning and risk management 
to technology teams.
Whenever there is a security breach or incident, it 
becomes a business issue and priority. So, why does 
business management take a passive approach for 
planning and managing information security? Just 
like quality and safety, information security can’t 
be achieved just with better technology. It is an 
organizational capability and therefore it must be 
planned and managed along with other business 
capabilities.
	 2.	 Fear and compliance are not the way to address, 
plan, and fund security capabilities.
It is understandable that compliance may be 
a prerequisite for the business. Compliance 
requirements are there for reasons. Addressing 
the underlying reasons should be the driver for 
planning security capabilities. Organization will 
not only achieve compliance but also create an 
empowered, security-aware culture. Addressing the 
compliance requirements without focusing on the 
underlying reasons will only ensure a forced and 
compliant mindset.
The planning based on fear of the unknown

holistic view of the required capabilities, and 
solution options reduce the degree of unknowns 
and the magnitude of the fear. Use the capability 
models and value flow maps to translate unknowns 
into knowns and fund the right capabilities and 
solutions.
	 3.	 Security is a competitive advantage, not just a cost 
of doing business.
Something is a competitive advantage if it is 
difficult for the competition to imitate. Something 
is required for competitive parity when others 
have or can acquire that capability. Industry is 
spending lots of money with an average return 
on investment at best. Most business leaders are 
concerned about the security capabilities and cost. 
It means it has not been easy for organizations to 
achieve and sustain secured business operations 
with the level of investments they made. The 
organizations, which have been able to advance 
maturity in organizational capabilities, such as 
quality, seamless ecosystem, service orientation, 
digital, and others, have created and sustained 
competitive differentiation. Security is one of the 
illusive organizational capabilities, which everyone 
wants, but only a few have been able to realize in 
alignment with their level of business operating 
model. Current practices in security planning and 
management continue to promote security as cost 
of doing business. We believe the framework for 
secured business operations, discussed in previous 
Chapter 7  Making It Real

146
chapters, provides organizations the knowledge 
and tools necessary for embedding security in 
their operations and offerings for a sustainable 
competitive advantage.
	 4.	 In many cases, processes are more effective than 
technologies in preventing and recovering from 
incidents.
One cannot achieve a high quality or safety just by 
acquiring better tools, machinery, or instructions. 
In many cases, it also requires improvement in 
processes and skills. In fact, we have learned that 
many times, the processes are more effective, less 
costly, and disruptive than using technologies to 
solve a business problem. Security is no different. 
Organizations can’t afford to manage security risk 
with one tool, that is, technologies. Organizations 
may reduce the number of incidents with the 
use of technologies, but when an incident does 
happen, it is the processes and people skills that 
allow organizations to avoid customer distrust 
and negative publicity. Therefore, any capability 
planning must take a holistic view of people, 
process, information, and technologies, to 
determine the appropriate and effective approach 
to address risk. The capability assessment using 
the secured business model and secured operating 
model exposes the gap and opportunity in 
leveraging people and processes for improving 
security posture.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

147
	 5.	 Avoid over-or underinvesting by aligning 
investments to business engagement level.
Security is not a “one size fits all” solution. 
Information risk is proportional to type and 
level of access and interactions outside the 
organization’s direct control, that is, the extent of 
business engagement with customers, partners, 
and employees. The organization that is open 
for business by providing remote access to its 
employees and sharing information in real time 
with customers and partners is going to be more 
vulnerable than the organization that does not 
provide remote access. The scope and investment 
in security capabilities must be consistent with the 
risk level carried by the organization based on its 
business engagement model. If an organization 
doesn’t know its engagement level, most likely, it is 
either overinvesting or underinvesting in security 
capabilities. The business engagement model1 
articulates four distinct types of engagements 
or interactions, starting with a self-contained 
organization with no outside access and collaboration 
to a digital organization. See Table 2-1 for details. It is 
a very quick exercise. Don’t postpone it.
1Business Engagement Model is explained in Chapter 2.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

148
	 6.	 Assess and manage capabilities for achieving and 
sustaining secured business operations.
Security is not something you implement and 
forget. With continuous change in business, people, 
information, technologies, customer expectations, 
or relationships, organizations cannot just deploy a 
solution, implement a process, or establish a policy 
and expect to mitigate the risks forever. Did you 
ever notice that military leaders always talk about 
capabilities to accomplish the mission? They don’t 
start the conversation with processes, ammunition, 
fighter jets, etc. They are focused on acquiring and 
maintaining the capability to fight any mission now 
and in the future. They understand the dependencies 
and make sure they have what is needed to sustain 
the capability. We propose the same mindset 
and approach for achieving and sustaining the 
mission of secured business operations. We also 
recognize that people can only plan what they 
know. Therefore, we created a body of knowledge 
and capability management framework for secured 
business operations. In Chapter 3, we described the 
secured business model for business to understand 
and identify the capabilities and maturity in those 
capabilities they need across 5 Ps – Prevent, Protect, 
People, Policy, and Profile. In Chapter 4, we focused 
on the underlying operational capabilities organized 
as the secured operating model. Together, the 
secured business model and secured operating 
model provides organizations to embrace the 
capability mindset and start assessing and planning 
secured business operations.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

149
	 7.	 Embed security in every role, process and project 
planning, by design.
Just like customer-centricity, quality or cost-
efficiency, security must be planned and planted in 
every other planning and design activities. Without 
the security-­conscious culture, risk management 
is too expensive and porous to be effective and 
sustainable. Organizations can start by asking a few 
simple questions during planning, approval, and 
oversight activities in making sure the teams are 
considering security implications of whatever they 
are doing or proposing. For example, if the role, 
process, or project changes the way or the extent of 
interactions with other people and processes, we 
need to ask how we are preventing and protecting 
unauthorized access to sensitive information. To 
create a security mindset, we introduced a secured 
management model in Chapter 5. The model 
provides the structure and steps for incorporating 
security assurance through the assess-plan-
improve-­manage phases of any initiative or change 
execution. In every planning and design effort, 
people have choices. Organizations can avoid 
rework and avoidable risk by ensuring that people 
are making the right choices with security in mind.
	 8.	 Measure effectiveness, not just operational or 
process metrics.
Activity-based measurements are primarily good at 
measuring process efficiency and operations, such as 
time and effort involved, number of people trained, 
or number of viruses detected. These measures are 
Chapter 7  Making It Real

150
required but not sufficient to comprehend overall 
effectiveness and value of the security-related 
activities and solutions. The security efforts should not 
be just about prevention and protection; they should 
also enable business innovation and transformation. 
To clearly articulate, measure and communicate 
the effectiveness of security capabilities; it requires 
identifying and measuring up-stream activities and 
outcomes. On the flip side, the same measures can 
also help in identifying and prioritizing the required 
security capabilities. Organizations may want to use 
value flow maps, described in Chapter 6, for linking 
security solutions with outcomes to measure and 
ensure their effectiveness.
What Has Been Done?
The framework for secured business operations is the result of many years 
of direct work with various organizations across industries and sectors, 
and the observations on success and challenges with many existing 
practices. Looking back, we can summarize our journey in three steps.
	 1.	 Building the various aspects of the framework as we 
were delivering the engagements.
	 2.	 Formalizing the body of knowledge with a value 
management platform, and applying the framework 
as designed.
	 3.	 Sharing the framework.
Although there have been variations in the starting point and road 
map for driving security capabilities and culture, broadly speaking, the use 
cases can be categorized into three areas.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

151
•	
Using the body of knowledge in the framework, 
for example, the business engagement model and 
capability maturity models to enhance existing 
methods and templates for better outcomes.
•	
Performing portfolio assessment and planning in 
support of organization initiatives, such as merger and 
acquisitions, digital transformation, leveraging the 
cloud services, and strategic or budget planning.
•	
Driving and ensuring appropriate risk posture and 
security governance in business and IT projects.
The following four use cases show how organizations started 
addressing the challenges and opportunities at the time. All these 
organizations understood and expected the broader change in the way 
they think, plan. and manage security capabilities. They also realized that 
it will take multiple years as they work on initiatives and opportunities over 
time across the organization.
	 1.	 A technology manufacturing global Fortune 500 
company, improving the security posture of its 
products, services, and operations.
	 2.	 One of the top health-care services providers in the 
United States, expanding its operations globally.
	 3.	 A national service provider with an extensive 
partner network, going through a merger with 
another service provider.
	 4.	 A hospital network with distributed facilities, 
evaluating and planning information and 
infrastructure services for improving cost, care, and 
communication.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

152
Technology Manufacturing Company Open 
for Business
The company has been using an Internet commerce platform with its 
customers, partners, and suppliers. The company was growing through 
mergers and acquisitions. As the commerce platform was becoming 
central to the business strategy and operations, the organization was 
challenged with scalability, adaptability, and information security.
In spite of the commerce platform being critical to the business, like 
most technology-based issues, the problem and therefore solution was 
originally left up to the technology teams to address. The bottom-up 
approach led to plumbing gaps and adding infrastructure resources. No 
one was satisfied with the outcomes. The organization decided to take a 
top-down approach, establishing it as a business-driven initiative with 
cross-functional leadership sponsorship and support.
Using the business engagement model, it was quickly determined 
and agreed by the leadership team that the organization wants to be a 
connected business (level 4) with the eventual goal to be a digital business 
(level 5). The current practices and solution were operating at level 3, that 
is, designed for business-to-business operations. Knowing the engagement 
level, management started asking the question of what do we need to get 
there. It was no longer a technology issue. The functional, operational, and 
risk resilience capabilities must support the organization to be a connected 
business.
Recognizing that organization needed to be at level 4 in the capability 
model, at a minimum, the key stakeholders across business functions 
such as manufacturing, sales and marketing, customer service, legal, HR, 
finance, and IT were surveyed for determining organizational priorities, 
focusing on the five Ps: Prevent, Protect, Policy, Profile, and People aspects 
of the secured business model. A risk register and 3-year road map were 
developed, initially focusing on the capabilities needed for the internal 
workforce.
Chapter 7  Making It Real

153
Identity and access management (IAM) was one of the first rounds of 
operational capabilities to be further analyzed and developed. Using the 
IAM capability maturity model from the secured operating model, the 
current and target states were defined, and the underlying dependencies 
and practices were identified. A project plan was developed, addressing 
required capabilities and dependencies.
As the program progressed through the phases, additional capabilities 
such as policy management, role management, and resource management 
were addressed.
Overall, it took over three years in addressing people, process, policies, 
platforms, and performance capabilities for secured, scalable, and flexible 
business operations. The top-down planning and iterative execution 
ensured alignment and value delivery.
Since then, the organization has added security as a track in every 
project and as part of governance, ensuring every delivered product and 
service is designed for secured business operations.
Leading Health-Care Provider Expanding 
Globally
A U.S.-based leading health-care provider wanted to extend its reach by 
collaborating with other providers and research organizations around 
the world. It also wanted to make sure patient privacy is preserved 
and regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and PCI are met while it 
communicates and connects with other organizations.
The organization conducted a holistic assessment of business and 
technical capabilities needed to support the collaborative yet secured 
environment. The top-down, process capability assessment focused on 
business needs, business operations, and security risks. The bottom-up, 
technical capability assessment evaluated the current state of various 
Chapter 7  Making It Real

154
management, operational, and infrastructure practices and technology 
solutions. The assessment included identification of the following:
•	
Outdated network infrastructure elements, unsuitable 
to manage cybersecurity threats.
•	
Web-based applications with insufficient security 
architecture.
•	
Policies and procedures for end-to-end access control 
and life-cycle management.
The organization used components of the secured business operations 
framework to assess, and more importantly, to establish a target state and 
developed a multiyear road map.
A Service Provider Merging with Another Service 
Provider
A membership-based consumer service provider has been expanding its 
member base through value-add information services and acquisition 
of other service providers. In the past, like most M&A, the portfolio 
rationalization and consolidation activities were primarily focused 
on application and infrastructure technologies. Information security 
capabilities were not considered during the portfolio rationalization, 
resulting in many surprises and unnecessary remediation costs.
The organization decided to improve its due diligence and portfolio 
rationalization process by including security assessment of the business 
and IT processes, and technology portfolio. It used the maturity model 
of twenty-one capabilities in the secured operating model to assess the 
organizational and operational capabilities of the acquired organization. 
Using the 5 Ps of the secured business model, it developed criteria for 
Chapter 7  Making It Real

155
assessing the security posture of each application under consideration 
for rationalization. The enhanced approach has helped the organization 
with better understanding of respective strengths and weaknesses of 
their security capabilities. The organization is able to make informed 
decisions to prioritize and plan based on cost, risk and value to avoid 
budget surprises.
A Hospital Network Optimizing Cost 
and Maximizing Care
The hospital network embarked on the digital transformation with 
electronic medical records, communication, and collaboration with 
patients and doctors, and shared services across the network. The 
organization was also concerned about increasing the cost and health of 
the infrastructure supporting the network.
The Chief Technology Officer (CTO), a business leader reporting 
to the CEO, initiated overall assessment of core enterprise services, 
including communication and collaboration, process and data integration, 
information security, directory, and networking services. To be objective 
and comprehensive, and at the same time efficient, the team leveraged 
available capability models such as the secured operating model, 
infrastructure optimization and service management, and developed a 
few maturity models where they were not readily available. The consumer 
and provider of services across the organization were interviewed using 
the models. Based on the gap identified and feedback, a road map with 
the business case was developed. As the organization moved forward with 
the plan, progress was monitored and reported against the maturity model 
and expected outcomes.

What Can You Do?
By now, we are confident that you do realize something must change the 
way the organization plans and manages information security capabilities, 
and the framework for secured business operations can be the recipe to 
make that change happen.
A successful adoption and value realization requires overcoming 
internal barriers and working around the constraints. So, what you can do 
is think proactively about it and address your own organization barriers 
and constraints. In Table 7-1, we have identified barriers we have observed 
and potential actions one can take.

Approach for Adopting and Operationalizing 
the Framework
We don’t suggest introducing a framework for the sake of a framework. It 
must address the need of the organization. You may need to adopt and 
integrate parts of the framework. You must also plan on operationalizing 
Chapter 7  Making It Real

158
the framework beyond the initial awareness and capability assessment. 
To help organizations adopt and operationalize the framework quickly, 
you can use CAMP,2 a cloud-based software as a service with ability to 
assess, plan, and manage capabilities and generate value using the secured 
business operations framework.
Some people are motivated to adopt the framework when they see 
what it can do. We invite you to contact us. We have preconfigured an 
online platform with a complete body of knowledge to quickly assess the 
organizational capabilities. The assessment may provide an interesting 
insight to jumpstart the journey toward achieving and sustaining secured 
business operations.
