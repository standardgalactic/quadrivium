Introduction
Introduction
This is the ﬁrst book containing examples from the Theory of Complex Functions. All the following
books will have this book as their background.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

The complex numbers
Example 1.1 Split a complex fraction into its real and imaginary part.
Let a + ib ̸= 0 and c + id be two complex numbers, where a, b, c, d ∈R. Since in general,
z · z = (x + iy)(x −iy) = x2 + y2 = |z|2,
we get by a multiplication with the complex conjugated of the denominator in both the numerator
and the denominator that
c + id
a + ib = c + id
a + ib · a −ib
a −ib = ac + bd
a2 + b2 + i · ad −bc
a2 + b2 ,
and we immediately split into the real and the imaginary part.
In particular,
1
z = 1
z · z
z =
z
|z|2 =
x
x2 + y2 −i ·
y
x2 + y2
for z ̸= 0.

Example 1.2 Write the following complex numbers in the form x + iy:
(a)
(1 + i)2,
(b)
3 + 4i
1 −2i,
(c)
1 + i
1 −i.
a. By a small computation,
(1 + i)2 = 12 + i2 + 2 · 1 · i = 1 −1 + 2i = 2i.
b. The standard method, i.e. a multiplication by the complex conjugated of the denominator in
both the numerator and the denominator gives
3 + 4i
1 −2i = 3 + 4i
1 −2i · 1 + 2i
1 + 2i = 1
5 {3 −8 + i(4 + 6)} = 1
5 {−5 + 10i} = −1 + 2i.
Alternatively,
3 + 4i = −{1 −4 −2 · 2i} = −(1 −2i)2 = (1 −2i)(−1 + 2i),
which gives by insertion
3 + 4i
1 −2i = (1 −2i)(1 + 2i)
1 −2i
= −1 + 2i.
c. The standard method:
1 + i
1 −i = 1 + i
1 −i · 1 + i
1 + i = 1
2 (1 + i)2 = 2i
2 = i.
Alternatively, apply polar coordinates, because
1 + i =
√
2 exp

i π

and
1 −i =

i26 −3i7 + i6 
1 −i3
−(−i)18 = i2 −3i3 + i2(1 + i) −i2
= −1 + 3i −(1 + i) + 1 = −1 + 2i.
b. The standard method gives

(d)

a. Trivial,
(2 + 3i) + (5 −2i) = 7 + i.
b. Standard multiplication,

Example 1.6 Prove that

(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8)
 = 1
4.
We show three methods, of which the ﬁrst one is recommended.
1) The direct method. The simplest method is to take the absolute value separately of each factor:

(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8)
 =
|3 −4i| · |2 + i|
2|1 −2i| · 2|3 + 4i| = 1

32 + 42 ·
√
22 + 12
√
12 + 22 ·
√
32 + 42 = 1
4.
2) Alternatively, though less convenient we ﬁrst compute the product,
(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8i)
=
6 + 4 + i(3 −8)
12 + 32 + i(−24 + 16) = 10 −5i
44 −8i = 10 −5i
44 −8i · 44 + 8i
44 + 8i
=
440 + 40 + i(−220 + 80)
1936 + 64
= 480 −140i
2000
= 24 −7i
100
,
hence

(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8i)
 =

24 −7i
100
 =

100
=
√576 + 49

100 = 1
4.
3) Alternatively we also have the following variant of 2.,
(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8i) =
6 + 4 + i(3 −8)
12 + 32 + i(−24 + 16) = 10 −5i
44 −8i,
and then we proceed in the following way,

(3 −4i)(2 + i)
(2 −4i)(6 + 8i)
 = |10 −5i|
|44 −8i| =
5|2 −i|

Example 1.7 Compute P(1 + i), where
P(z) = z5 + 2i z3 −z.
Here we suggest two solutions, of which the former is the most obvious, which that latter which is
recommended is much easier.
1) The obvious solution. Using the binomial formula we get
P(1 + i)
=
(1 + i)5 + 2i(1 + i)3 −(1 + i)
=

1 + 5i + 10i2 + 10i3 + 5i4 + i5
+2i

1 + 3i + 3i2 + i3
−1−i
=
1 −10 + 5 + i(5 −10 + 1) + 2i(1 −3 + i{3 −1}) −1 −i
=
−4 −4i −4i −4 −1 −i = −9 −9i.
2) Alternatively the computations become much easier, if we note that
(1 + i)2 = 2i.
Then
P(1 + i) = (1 + i)

(2i)2 + 2i · 2i −1

= (−4 −4 −1)(1 + i) = −9 −9i.

Example 1.8 We write as usual z = x + iy.
Split the following expressions into their real and
imaginary part:
(a)
z3,
(b)
z · z,
(c)
z
z ,
z ̸= 0,
(d)
z −i
1 −z i,
z ̸= i.
a. By computing
z3 = (x + iy)3 = x3 + 3x2 · iy + 3x · (iy)2 + (iy)3 = x3 −3xy2 + i

3x2y −y3
.
it follows immediately that
Re

z3
= x3 −3xy2
og
Im

x3
= 3x2y −y3.
b. It follows from
z · z = |z|2 = x2 + y2,
that
Re {z · z} = x2 + y2
og
Im {z · z} = 0.
c. By a standard computation we ﬁrst get
z
z = x −iy
x + iy = (x −iy)2
x2 + y2 = x2 −y2
x2 + y2 −
2xy
x2 + y2 · i.
Then it immediately follows that
Re
	z
z

= x2 −y2
x2 + y2
og
Im
	z
z

= −
2xy
x2 + y2 .
d. We get by the standard procedure (multiplication of the numerator and the denominator by the
conjugated of the denominator)
z −i
1 −z i
=
x + iy −i
1 −(x −iy)i = x + i(y −1)
(−y + 1) −ix · (−y + 1) + ix
(−y + 1) + ix
=
x(−y + 1) −x(y −1) + i{−(y −1)2 + x2}
x2 + (y −1)2
,
hence
Re

2x(y −1)

Example 1.9 Express the following by means of x and y:

z −1
 ,
z ̸= 1,
(d)


a. A direct computation gives
|z −1|2 = |(x −1) + iy|2 = (x−1)2 + y2


.
b. Again by direct computation,
|z|4 =

|z|22 =

x2 + y22


c. And once more direct computation (for z ̸= 1),

z + 1
z −1
 =

x + 1 + iy
x −1 + iy
 =

(x −1)2 + y2
⎛
⎝=

x2 + y2 −2x + 1
x2 + y2 −2x + 1
⎞
⎠.
d. It follows from
z + i
1 −iz = i(z + i)
i(1 −iz) = i(z + i)
z + i
= i
for z ̸= −i,
that

z + i
1 −iz
 = |i| = 1.
Alternatively, put z = x + iy. Then we get for z ̸= −i,

z + i
1 −iz
 =

x + i(y + 1)
1 −i(x + iy)
 =

x + i(y + 1)
(1 + y) −ix
 =

x2 + (y + 1)2

(1 + y)2 + x2 = 1,
where the latter computation may be performed in diﬀerent ways.
Example 1.10 Let z ∈C \ {0}. Prove that Re
	1
z

> 0, if and only if Re{z} > 0.
We shall give two methods of solution:
1) Analytically: We get for z ̸= 0,
1
z =
z
z · z = x −iy
x2 + y2 =
x
x2 + y2 −i
y
x2 + y2 ,
hence
Re

=

x2 + y2 > 0,
if and only if
x = Re{z} > 0.

2) Polar coordinates (and geometrically). If we put z = r , eiθ, then 1
z = 1
r e−iθ, hence
Re{z} = r cos θ
and
Re
	1
z

r cos(−θ) = 1
r cos θ,
and it follows that Re{z} and Re
	1
z

have the same sign for z ̸= 0.
Example 1.11 Let x −iy
x + iy = a + ib, where x, y, a, b ∈R, x2 + y2 ̸= 0. Vis, at a2 + b2 = 1.
We have two main variants:
1) The simplest variant is the following,
a2 + b2 = |a + ib|2 = |x −iy|2
|x + iy|2 = x2 + y2
x2 + y2 = 1,
z ̸= 0.
2) Alternatively, we get for z ̸= 0 that

x4 + y4 + 2x2y2
= x4 + y4 + 2x2y2
x4 + y4 + 2x2y2 = 1.
Example 1.12 Let a and b be complex numbers, for which b a+a ̸= 0 for every z ∈C, where |z| = 1.
Prove that, if |z| = 1, then

az + b
b z + a
 = 1.
The condition
b z + a ̸= 0
for every z ∈C, for which |z| = 1,
only means that |b| ̸= |a|.
If |z| = 1, then
|z|2 = z · z = 1,
hence
z = 1
z
and
|z| = 1,

Example 1.13 Find the maximum of
z2 + 1
 on the unit disc
{z ∈C | |z| ≤1}.
We shall give two solution of which the former is in line with the Theory of Complex Functions. In
the latter method we shall only apply real methods, which in general cannot be recommended here.
1) The simple solution. Since
z2 + 1
 ≤|z|2 + 1 ≤2
for |z| ≤1,
the maximum must be ≤2.
On the other hand we obtain the value 2 at the points z = ±1 in the closed unit disc, and we
conclude that the maximum is indeed 2.
2) Alternatively, apply the known real methods. Put
ϕ(z)
=
z2 + 1
2 =
x2 −y2 + 1 + 2ixy
2 =

x2 −y2 + 1
2 + 4x2y2
=
x4 + y4 + 1 −2x2y2 + 2x2 −2y2 + 4x2y2
=
x4 + y4 + 2x2y2 + 2x2 −2y2 + 1.
Then we ﬁnd the maximum of
z2 + 1
 by ﬁrst ﬁnding the maximum of ϕ(z) =
z2 + 1
2.
The possible stationary points are the solutions of the following system of two equations,
∂ϕ
∂x
=
4x3 + 4xy2 + 4x = 4x

x2 + y2 + 1

= 0,
∂ϕ
∂y
=
4y3 + 4x2y −4y = 4y

x2 + y2 −1

= 0.
It follows from the former equation that x = 0, so by insertion into the latter equation we get the
possibilities y = 0 and y2 −1 = 0, thus y = −1, 0, 1.
Hence the stationary points are
(x, y) = (0, −1) ∼−i,
(x, y) = (0, 0) ∼0,
(x, y) = (0, 1) ∼i,
corresponding to
ϕ(−i) = 0,
ϕ(0) = 1,
ϕ(i) = 0.
We shall still go through the values on the boundary, thus we put x2 + y2 = 1. First we reduce
ϕ(z)
=
x4 + y4 + 2x2y2 + 2x2 −2y2 + 1
=

x2 + y22 + 2

x2 + y2
+ 1 −4y2
=
1 + 2 + 1 −4y2 = 4

1 −y2
,
for y ∈[−1, 1].
Clearly, the maximum on the boundary is obtained for y = 0, corresponding to z = x = ±1. Then
ϕ(±1) = 4(1 −0) = 4,
and we conclude that the maximum of
z2 + 1
 on the closed unit disc is
√
4 = 2.

Example 1.14 It is well-known that the function f(z) = z describes a reﬂection with respect to the
x-axis. Find a corresponding function g(z), which describes a reﬂection with respect to the y-axis.
Since
g(z) = g(x + iy) = −x + iy = −(x −iy) = −z,
the map is given by
g(z) = −z.
Example 1.15 Prove that |1 −z| = |1 −z|, and give a geometric interpretation of the result.
If we put z = x + iy, then
|1 −z| = |1 −x −iy| =

(1 −x)2 + y2,
and
|1 −z| = |1 −x + iy| =

(1 −x)2 + y2,
hence |1 −z| = |1 −z|.

Since |1 −z| = |z −1|, we can also write the equation in the form
|z −1| = |z −1|.
The interpretation of this equation is that the distances from 1 to z and to z, resp. are the same.

(d) The point set described by α ≤Arg z ≤β is the angular domain between the half lines t = α
and t = β. It is not closed, because the point (0, 0) does not belong to the set, neither is is open
because the open half lines belong to the set.
Example 1.19 Assume that c ∈R and α ∈C \ {0}. Prove that
α z + α z + c = 0
is the equation of a straight line in the (x, y)-plane.
It follows from 2 Re w = w + w
w = α z = (a + ib)(x + iy),
that
0 = α z + α z + c = 2 Re{(a + ib)(x + iy)} = 2a x −2b y + c.
Since α = a + ib ̸= 0, this is the equation of a straight line.
Alternative it follows by a direct computation that
0
=
α z + α z + c = (a + ib)(x + iy) + (a −ib)(x −iy) + c
=
ax −by + i(bx + ay) + ax −by −i(bx + ay) + c = 2ax −2by + c.

and a rearrangement that
|z + α| = |z −(−α)| =

|α|2 −c.
Then we conclude from the geometrical interpretation that the point set is a circle of centrum −α
(reﬂection of α with respect to the y-axis) and radius

|α|2 −c.
However, if |α|2 = c, then we only get the point z = −α.
Alternatively we put z = x + iy and α = a + ib, where the assumption is that a2 + b2 ≥c. Then
0
=
z z + α z + α z + c = |z|2 + 2 Re(α z) + c = x2 + y2 + 2ax −2by + c



hence
(x + a)2 + (y −b)2 = a2 + b2 −c.

We shall ﬁnd the set of the z, for which
u = a −z
a + z = −z + a
z + a
is real (since otherwise the order relation does not make sense).
We get by solving the equation,
a u + u z = a −z.
When we put a = α + iβ, Re a = α > 0, then
z = a −a u
u + 1 = α + iβ −(α −iβ)u
u + 1
= α · 1 −u
1 + u + iβ.
If u = 1, then z = iβ.
If u > 1, then x = α · 1 −u
1 + u < 0, hence
−α < x < 0
and
y = β.
If u < 1, u ̸= −1, then we obtain the remaining parts of the line y = β, thus in a complex description,
x + iβ, where either
x < −α,
corresponding to
−∞< u < −1,
or
0 < x,
corresponding to
−1 < u < 1.
The three point sets all lie on the line y = β.

The left hand side is ≥0, so this inequality is equivalent to
(|x| + |y|)2 ≤2x2 + 2y2,

2x2 + 2y2 −(|x| + |y|)2 = 2x2 + 2y2 −x2 −y2 −2|x| · |y| = x2 + y2 −2|x| · |y| = (|x| −|y|)2 ≥0.

Example 2.2 Find the values of z ∈C for which
ei z = ei z.
If we put z = x + iy, then
ei z = ei x−y = e−ye−i x
and
ei z = ei(x−i y) = ey ei x.
Hence if ei z = ei z, then y = 0 and e−i x = ei x, so
e2i x = 1 = e2i pπ,
and we get x = pπ, i.e.
z = pπ,
p ∈Z.
On the other hand, if z = pπ, p ∈Z, then
ei z = ei pπ = (−1)p
and
ei z = ei pπ = (−1)p,
and the equation is fulﬁlled. Hence the complete solution is
z = pπ,
p ∈Z.

Two complex numbers are identical, if and only if they have the same absolute value (i.e. same module)
and (assuming that the modulus is ̸= 0) if their arguments agree modulo 2π.
If we put z = x + iy and w = u + iv into the exponential function, then
ez = ex · ei y
and
ew = eu · ei v.
The module is ex = eu ̸= 0, hence x = u, and concerning the arguments we get y ≡v (mod 2π), hence
y = v + 2k π for some k ∈Z. Finally,
z = x + iy = u + i(v + 2π k) = u + iv + 2π k i = w + 2π k i
for some k ∈Z.
Example 2.6 Find the real and the imaginary part of (1 + i)20.
It follows from (1 + i)2 = 2 i that
(1 + i)20 = {(1 + i)}10 = {2 i}10 = 210 i10 = 210 i2 = −1024,
thus
Re

(1 + i)20

and
Im

= 0.
Alternatively we use polar coordinates. Since
1 + i =

we get by using polar coordinates that

hence by splitting into the real and the imaginary part,
cos 3θ = cos3 θ −3 cos θ sin2 θ = 4 cos3 θ −3 cos θ,

Example 2.10 Apply Moivre’s formula to prove that
cos 8θ + 28 cos 4θ + 35 = 64

cos8 θ + sin8 θ

.
First method. Whenever one shall apply Moivre’s formula, one must usually do a lot of computa-
tions.
First we rewrite the left hand side to a homogenous trigonometric polynomial of degree 8, by using
1 = cos2 θ + sin2 θ.
We ﬁnd by the binomial formula that
cos 8θ
=
Re ei 8θ = Re

ei θ8 = Re (cos θ + i sin θ)8
=
cos8 θ −28 cos6 θ sin2 θ + 70 cos4 θ sin4 θ −28 cos2 θ sin6 θ + sin8 θ,
cos 4θ

cos2 θ + sin2 θ


cos4 θ −6 cos2 θ sin2 θ + sin4 θ

·

cos4 θ + 2 cos2 θ sin2 + sin4 θ

=
cos8 θ −4 cos6 θ sin2 θ −10 cos4 θ sin4 θ −4 cos2 θ sin6 θ + sin8 θ,
and
1 =

cos2 θ + sin2 θ
4 = cos8 θ + 4 cos6 θ sin2 θ + 6 cos4 θ sin4 θ + 4 cos2 θ sin6 θ + sin8 θ.
Summing up,
cos 8θ = cos8 θ −28 cos6 θ sin2 θ + 70 cos4 θ sin4 θ −28 cos2 θ sin6 θ + sin8 θ,
28 cos 4θ = 28 cos8 θ −112 cos6 θ sin2 θ −280 cos4 θ sin4 θ −112 cos2 sin6 θ + 28 sin8 θ,
35 = 35 cos8 θ + 140 cos6 θ sin2 θ + 210 cos4 θ + 140 cos2 θ sin6 θ + 35 sin8 .
Finally, by an addition,
cos 8θ + 28 cos 4θ + 35 = (1 + 28 + 35)

cos8 θ + sin8 θ

= 64

cos8 θ + sin8 θ

.
Second method. It is here much easier to use Euler’s formulæ and then compute from the right
towards the left,
64 cos8 θ

ei θ + e−i θ8

e8i θ −8 e6iθ + 28 e4i θ −56 e2i θ + 70 −56 e−2i θ + 28 e−4i θ −8 e−6i θ + e−8i θ
.
Finally, by an addition,
64

cos8 θ + sin8 θ

= 1
2

e8i θ + 28 e4i θ + 70 + 28 e−4i θ + e−8i θ
= cos 8θ + 28 cos 4θ + 35.

Third method. One can also apply the well-known trigonometric relations,
cos2 t = 1 + cos 2t
2
and
sin2 t = 1 −cos 2t

with diﬀerent values (θ, 2θ and 4θ) of t. When we compute from the right towards the left, we get

Fourth method. The same as in the third method, with the only exception that we now compute
from the left towards the right. It is seen that one must here use far more skill:

Example 3.2 Given a, b ∈R. Find x, y ∈R expressed by a and b, such that
(x + iy)2 = a + ib.
When we compute the left hand side, we get
(x + iy)2 = x2 −y2 + 2ixy,
so by a splitting into the real and the imaginary part we obtain the two equations
x2 −y2 = a
og
2xy = b.
This implies that
a2 + b2 =

x2 −y22 + 4x2y2 =

x2 + y22 ,
hence
x2 + y2 =

a2 + b2 ≥0.
When this is compared with x2 −y2 = a, we get
x2 = a +
√
a2 + b2
2
(≥0),
y2 = −a +

a2 + b2

thus
(2) x = ±

a +

y = ±

−a +

.
Hence a solution is necessarily of the form (2). We see, however, that (2) usually gives four possibilities,
and they cannot all be solutions, because we know that there are only two solutions. Hence we must
check all our possible solutions.
The equation x2 −y2 = a is of course always satisﬁed, so we turn towards 2xy = b.
If b = 0, then either x = 0 or y = 0, according to (2), and the equation 2xy = b = 0 is of course
fulﬁlled. (In this case (2) produces actually only two solutions).
If b ̸= 0, then a check shows that the solution is

Example 3.9 Solve the equation zn = z for every n ∈N.
Also, solve the equation, when n ∈Z.
If n = 1, then the equation becomes z = z. The set of complex numbers which are equal to their
complex conjugated, is equal to the set of real number, hence the solution is R.
If n ≥2, then z = 0 is trivially a solution.
Then assume that z ̸= 0. Put z = r ei θ, r > 0, which gives
rneinθ = r e−iθ,
r > 0,
thus
rn−1ei(n+1)θ = 1.
We conclude that r = 1 and θ = 2pπ

If n = 0, then the equation is reduced to z = 1, and it follows that the solution is z = 1.
Finally, let n < 0. If we write n = −m, m ∈N, then z−m = z. In particular, 0 is never a solution.
If m = 1, then z−1 = z is rewritten as
1 = z · z = |z|2,
and the set of solutions is the unit circle.
When m > 1, we use polar coordinates z = r eiθ, so
1 = z zm = rm+1 · e−iθ · eimθ = rm+1ei(m−1)θ,
hence r = 1 and θ =

8x3y −8xy3 −9x2y + 3y3
,
can be written as a polynomial in the complex variable z.
Then ﬁnd the roots.
Concerning polynomials, a good strategy is to identify the degrees of the pair (x, y), which occur. We
see that we have the degrees 4 and 3, and since
z4 = (x + iy)4 = x4 + 4ix3y −6x2y2 −4ixy3 + y4 = x4 −6x2y2 + y4 + i

Example 3.11 (Enestr¨om’s theorem). Given the real numbers p0, p1, . . . , pn, for which
p0 > p1 > p2 > · · · > pn > 0.
Prove that the polynomial
P(z) = p0 + p1z + p2z2 + · · · + pnzn
does not have a zero in the open unit disc |z| < 1.
Hint: Consider (1 −z)P(z).

According to we assumption we have pj−1 −pj > 0, so when |z| < 1 we get the estimate
|(1 −z)P(z)| > p0 −(p0 −p1) −(p1 −p2) −· · · −(pn−1 −pn) −pn = 0,
and we conclude that (1 −z)P(z) ̸= 0 for |z| < 1, so in particular that P(z) does not have any zero
in the open unit disc.

Here we of course must assume that z ̸= 0 and z ̸= −z0.
When we multiply by the common
denominator z0z (z + z0), we get
z0z = (z + z0) z0 + z (z + z0) = z0z + z2

It will be proved below that this is never true in R. Furthermore, it is proved that there are complex
solutions, but they do not match with the wrong “rule of calculation”. ♦

so the roots are
z1 = −1 + i
and
z2 = −5 −2i.
A check shows that the sum of the roots is
(−1 + i) + (−5 −2i) = −6 −i = −(6 + i),
i.e. the coeﬃcient of z of the opposite sign, and the product of the roots is
(−1 + i)(−5 −2i) = 5 + 2 −5i + 2i = 7 −3i,
i.e. equal to the constant term of the polynomial. We see that the check is OK. ♦
Remark 4.2 If one does not see immediately that 7 = 42 −32, then we may try to solve the equation
(a + ib)2 = 7 + 24i. This gives us the equations
a2 −b2 = 7
og
2ab = 24,
hence

a2 + b22 =

a2 −b22 + (2ab)2 = 72 + 242 = 49 + 576 = 625 = 252,
and thus
a2 + b2 = 25,
so when we combine it with a2 −b2 = 7 we obtain a2 = 16 and b2 = 9.
Example 4.3 Solve the equation
1


z + 1


= a
for a ∈C.
Prove that the equation has precisely one solution in the open unit disc |z| < 1, if and only if a does
not belong to the real interval [−1, 1].
Here we must assume that z ̸= 0. Then by a multiplication by 2z and a rearrangement we get
(4) z2 −2a z + 1 = 0,
the solutions of which are
z = a ±

a2 −1.
Denote the roots by z1 and z2. The structure of (4) shows that the product of the roots is 1, hence
z1 · z2 = 1. If therefore e.g. |z1| ≥1, then we necessarily must |z2| ≤1, and vice versa. This shows
that we have precisely one solution in the open unit disc |z| < 1, if and only if the other solution lies
in the open complementary set |z| > 1of the closed unit disc.

The condition that this is not the case is equivalent to |z1| = |z2| = 1. Let z be a shorthand for any
of these solutions. Then z = eiθ, if |z| = 1, and it follows by insertion that
a = 1


eiθ + e−iθ
= cos θ.
This shows that a goes through the interval [−1, 1] twice, when θ goes through the parameter interval
[0, 2π] once.
Therefore, if a /∈[−1, 1], then there is precisely one solution in the open unit disc |z| < 1.
Finally, if a ∈[−1, 1], then it follows from
z = a ±

a2 −1 = a ± i

1 −a2,
1 −a2 ≥0,
that
|z|2 = a2 + 1 −a2 = 1,

Example 4.4 Prove that 1 ± i are the roots of the polynomial

hence the roots are z = ±i and z = 1 ± i.
Second method. When 1 ± i are roots, then
(z −{1 + i})(z −{1 −i}) = ({z −1} −i)({z −1} + i) = (z −1)2 + 1 = z2 −2z + 2
must be a divisor in the polynomial. Again we ﬁnd that
z4 −2z3 + 3z2 −2z + 2 =

z2 + 1

z2 −2z + 2

so the roots are z = ±i and 1 ± i.

and we get immediately the roots z = ±2i and z = 1 ± i.
Second method. The polynomial has only real coeﬃcients, so the roots are either real, or pairwise
complex conjugated. Thus, since 1 −i is a root, also 1 + i must be a root, hence
(z −{1 −i})(z −{1 + i}) = ({z −1} + i)({z −1} −i) = z2 −2z + 2
must be a. By a polynomial division we get
z4 −2z3 + 6z2 −8z + 8 =

and it follows as before that the roots are z = ±2i and z = 1 ± i.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Remark 4.4 It is worth mentioning that a division by
z −{1 −i} = z −1 + i
will give some very unpleasant calculations and that such a division only reduces the problem to a
messy equation of third degree. Therefore, one should always exploit the the roots are either real or
pairwise conjugated, if the polynomial has real coeﬃcients. ♦
Example 4.6 Solve the equation

z4 −16
 
z3 + 1

= 0.
It is seen by inspection that the four roots of z4 −16 are 2, 2i, −2, −2i, and that the three roots of
z3 + 1 are −1, 1
2 + i
√
3
2 , 1
2 −i

Remark 4.5 The example is of course trivial, when it is solved in this way. However, it is a warning
against starting by multiplying the two factors, in which case one shall get the equation of seventh
degree:
z7 + z4 −16z3 −16 = 0.
This is not very smart, even if it in this case is possible to guess the rational roots z = −2, −1 and 2.
Then we get by the usual reduction that
z7 + z4 −16z3 −16 = (z + 2)(z + 1)(z −2)

z4 −z3 + 5z2 −4z + 4

= 0,
and the problem has now been “reduced” to ﬁnding the roots of the equation
z4 −z3 + 5z2 −4z + 4,
which does not look very promising.
The lesson here is that one in almost every case should keep a given factorization and not multiply
the factors. ♦

(c) The equation is a disguised equation of second degree in z4, so

and it follows that the eight roots are
1, 1, i, i, −1, −1, −i, −i,
because the binomial equation z4 −1 = 0 has the four roots 1, i, −1, −i.
(d) It follows by inspection that
z3 + z2 + z + 1)z2(z + 1) + (z + 1) = (z + 1)

and we conclude that the roots are −1, i and −i.
Alternatively it is seen that z3+z2+z+1 are the ﬁrst four terms of a quotient series. Therefore,
if z ̸= 1, then
z3 + z2 + z1 = z4 −1
z −1 ,
z ̸= 1.
The numerator z4−1 has the four roots 1, i, −1, −i, and when z = 1, it follows that z3+z2+z+1 =
4 ̸= 0. Therefore, we conclude that the three roots are i, −1, −i.

Example 4.8 Prove that all the roots of the equation

Then prove that this is in general the case of the roots of the equation
(z + 1)n + zn = 0,
for every n ∈N.
We shall immediately prove the general result. Clearly, z = 0 is not a solution of the equation. When
we divide by zn, the equation becomes

By putting w = z + 1

we get the binomial equation wn = −1, and in particular |w| = 1.
We then check what the unit circle |w| = 1 is mapped into by the inverse transformation
z =

z2 −2(1 + i)z −2
2 = −8i.
This equation can also be written
w2 = −8i,
where
w = z2 −2(1 + i)z −2.
Let us ﬁrst solve the binomial equation:
w = ±2(1 −i).
By insertion we get two equations of second degree, which are solved in the usual way:
1) If w = 2(1 −i), then after a reduction
z2 −2(1 + i)z −2i = 0,
hence
z = 1 + i ±

2i + 2i = 1 + i ±

z2 −2(1 + i) + 2i −4 = 0,
hence
z = 1 + i ±

2i −2i + 4 = 1 + i ± 2.

Rational and multiple roots in polynomials
Example 5.1 Find all the roots of the polynomial
p(z) = z3 −(1 + 2i)z2 −(1 −2i)z + 1,
given that it has a multiple root.
Since
p′(z) = 3z2 −(2 + 4i)z −(1 −2i),
it follows by the usual algorithm of division that
p(z) =
	1
3 z −1 + 2i
9

p′(z) + 4
9 iz + 4
9 =
	
13 z −1 + 2i
9

p′(z) + 4
9 i (z −i).
The multiple root is a root in both p(z) and in p′(z), so it follows that it must be z = i.
Since now z = i is a root of at least second order, (z −i)2 = z2 −2iz −1 must be a divisor in p(z).
We obtain by division that
p(z) = z3 −(1 + 2i)z2 −(1 −2i)z + 1 = (z −1)(z −i)2,
and the three roots are 1, i and i.

We conclude that the roots are

Alternatively, the equation has only integers as coeﬃcients, hence the possible rational roots must
be among

thus only 16 possibilities. By using a pocket calculator we get

P(1) = −18,
P(−6) = 5148,
P(−1) = −12,
P(3) = 0,

It follows from this table that 3, −2, 1
2 and −1
2 are indeed roots. Since a polynomial of fourth degree
has precisely 4 roots (counted by multiplicity), we have found all the roots.
Example 5.3 Find the possible multiple roots of the polynomial
4z5+(8+16i)z4+(−27+32i)z3−(29+44i)z2+(44+12i)z−12,
and then ﬁnd all roots.
This is a diﬃcult example, because the polynomial is of ﬁfth degree, and because the coeﬃcients are
complex. A pocket calculator will here be quite helpful, though I did not use one while I was working
on this example).
It follows after a diﬀerentiation that the task is to ﬁnd all the common divisors of
(5)

4z5+(8+16i)z4+(−27+ 32i)z3+(−29−44i)z2+(44+12i)z−12,

The former polynomial of (5) is multiplied by med 5, and the latter with z. This gives

hence by a subtraction,
(8+16i)z4+(−54+64i)z3+(−87−132i)z2+(176+48i)z−60,
and we have obtained a polynomial of fourth degree which also must have the multiple root as a root.
The coeﬃcients of the highest order term is 8 + 16i = 8(1 + 2i), so we multiply the latter polynomial
by 1 −2i. Then
40z4+(74+172)z3+(−351+42i)z2+(272−304i)z−60+120i,
which also must have the possible multiple roots as roots.
If we subtract twice times the latter polynomial of (5), from this polynomial, we obtain the following
reduce polynomial, which also has the wanted roots as some of its roots,
(10+44i)z3+(−189−150i)z2+(388−128i)z+(−148+96i).
Since 10 + 44i = 2(5 + 22i), we obtain a “nicer” expression which we multiply this polynomial by
5 −22i, hence
1018z3+(−4245+3408i)z2+(−876−9176i)z+(1372+3736i).
We have now reduced our system to

1018z3+(−4245+3408)z2+(−876−9176i)z+(1372+3736i).
If we multiply the former polynomial of (6) by 509 and the latter by 10z, then we get the following
rather messy system,
⎧

⎩
10 180z4+(16 288+32 576i)z3+(−41 229+48 864i)z2 +(−29 522−44 792i)z+(22 396+6 108i),
10 180z4+(−42 450+34 080i)z3+(−8 760−91 760i)z2 +(13 720+37360i)z,
hence by a subtraction,
(58 738−1 504i)z3+(−32 469+140 624i)z2 +(−43 242−82 152i)z+(22 396+6 108i).
This expression is then multiplied by 1018,
(59 795 284−1 531 072i)z3+(−33 053 442+143 153 232i)z2
+(−44 020 356−83 630 736i)z+(22 799 128+6 217 944i),
which should be linked with the latter expression of (6) when it is multiplied by 58 738 −1 504i, thus
(59 795 284−1 531 072i)z3+(−244 217 178+206 563 584i)z2
+(−65 255 192 −537 662 384i)z + (86 207 480 + 217 381 680i).
Then by a subtraction,

A division by 4 reduces this polynomial to
52 790 934−15 852 088i)z2+(5 308 709+113 507 912i)z +(−15 852 088i−52 790 934i).

Then we see that 49 is also a divisor, so we can reduce to

Then we multiply by 1 077 366 + 323 512i, in order to get

2z2+(−1+4i)z−2i = 0,
where we use the original polynomial as our ﬁrst one, because it looks ‘simplest’, concerning the
coeﬃcients. Notice that any of the polynomials derived above could be used instead.
Then again we perform a division by polynomials, but this time we (fortunately) obtain
4z5+(8+16i)z4+(−27+32i)z3+(−29−44i)z2+(44+12i)z−12

According to the theory, the roots of 2z2 + {−1 + 4i}z −2i must be double roots of the original
polynomial. Hence, we can perform another division by a polynomial, which gives us
4z5+(8+16i)z4+(−27+32i)z3+(−29−44i)z2+(44+12i)z−12 =

Therefore, we shall only ﬁnd the roots of

Remark 5.2 The computations above may be performed in various ways, some of them will not give
as awkward numbers as the method above. The purpose here has only been to demonstrate what may
happen if one slavic follows the standard method without using one’s brain. ♦
Remark 5.3 It is also worth mentioning that there exists an alternative method of solution. In
the actual case it will also lead to huge computations, but one advantage is that all its coeﬃcients will
remain real. The idea is that if one splits int the real and the imaginary part,

we conclude that the possible real roots necessarily must be real roots of both the real part and the

divisors of
	 4z3 + 8z2 −11z + 3,

The former polynomial is multiplied by 3 and the latter by z. This gives the equivalent system
	
12z3 + 24z2 −33z + 9,
12z3 + 16z2 −11z,
hence by a subtraction, 8z2 −22z + 9, and the task has been reduced to ﬁnding a common divisor of

First we write this system as

Example 5.4 Find all the possible multiple roots of the polynomial
z5+(9+i)z4+(27+10i)z3+(23+37i)z2+(−24+60i)z−36+36i,
and ﬁnd all its roots.
After we have been taught a lesson in Example 5.3 we ﬁrst try to ﬁnd the possible real roots. These
must be the common roots of the polynomials
⎧
⎨
⎩
z5 + 9z4 + 27z3 + 23z2 −24z −36
=
PRe(z)
z4 + 10z3 + 37z2 + 60z + 36
=
PIm(z).
When we multiply by z, we get
z5 + 10z4 + 37z3 + 60z2 + 36z = z · PIm(z),
and we conclude that
PRe(z) = z5 + 9z4 + 27z3 + 23z2 −24z −36 = (z −1)PIm(z),
thus
P(z) = PRe(z) + i PIm(z) = (z −1 + i)

z4 + 10z3 + 37z2 + 60z + 36

.
This proves that 1 −i is a root, and the task has been reduced to ﬁnding the multiple roots of
z4 + 10z3 + 37z2 + 60z + 36,
i.e. we shall ﬁnd the common divisors of
(8)
⎧
⎨
⎩
z4 + 10z3 + 37z2 + 60z + 36,
4z3 + 30z2 + 74z + 60.
When the former polynomial of (8) is multiplied by 4 and the latter by z, we obtain the following
equivalent system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
4z4 + 40z3 + 148z2 + 240z + 144,
4z4 + 30z3 + 74z2 + 60z,
thus we get by a subtraction the polynomial
10z3 + 74z2 + 180z + 144.
We have now reduced (8) to the simpler and equivalent system
(9)
⎧
⎨
⎩
10z3 + 74z2 + 180z + 144,
2z3 + 15z2 + 37z + 30,
where the latter expression of (9) stems from the latter expression of (8) after a division by 2.
When the latter expression of (9) is multiplied by 5, then
10z3 + 75z2 + 185z + 150.

From this we subtract the former expression of (9) in order to get
z2 + 5z + 6 = (z + 2)(z + 3).
Then put z = −2 and z = −3, into P(z) = (z −1 + i)PIm(z), i.e. we check the solution,
P(−2) = P(−3) = 0,
because
PIm(−2)
=
24 −10 · 23 + 37 · 22 −60 · 2 + 36 = 16 −80 + 148 −120 + 36 = 0,
PIm(−3)
=
34 −10 · 33 + 37 · 32 −60 · 3 + 36 = 9(9 −30 + 37 −20 + 4) = 0.
According to the theory, both −2 and −3 are multiple roots (of multiplicity 2), thus
P(z) = (z −1 + i)(z + 2)2(z + 3)2,
and the roots are
1 −i,
−2,
−2,
−3,
−3.
Alternatively we demonstrate in the following what happens, if we instead apply the standard
method. It follows after a diﬀerentiation that we shall ﬁnd the common divisors of
⎧
⎨
⎩
z5+(9+i)z4+(27+10i)z3+(23+37i)z2+(−24+60i)z−36+36i,
5z4+(36+4)z3+(81+30i)z2+(46+74i)z+(−24+60i).
Multiply the former polynomial by 5 and the latter by z. Then
⎧
⎨
⎩
5z5+(45+5i)z4+(135+50i)z3+(115+185i)z3+(−120+300i)z−180+180i,
5z5+(36+4i)z4+(81+30i)z3+(46+74i)z2+(−24+60i)z,
hence by a subtraction
(9+i)z4+(54+20i)z3+(69+111i)z2+(−96+240i)z−180+180i.
When we multiply by 9 −i we obtain the polynomial
82z4+(506+126i)z3+(732+930i)z2+(−624+2256i)z+(−1440+1800i),
and it follows after a division by 2 that we shall ﬁnd the common divisors of
⎧
⎨
⎩
41z4+(253+3i)z3+(366+465i)z2+(−312+1128i)z+(−720+900i),
5z4+(36+4i)z3+(81+30i)z2+(46+74i)z+(−24+60i).
Multiply the former polynomial by 5 and the latter by 41. Then we obtain the equivalent system
⎧
⎨
⎩
205z4+(1265 + 315i)z3+(1830+2325i)z2+(−1560+5640i)z+(−3600+4500i),
205z4+(1476+164i)z3+(3321+1230i)z2+(1886+3034i)z+(−984+2460i).

By a subtraction,

The former polynomial is multiplied by 211 −151i, and the latter by 5z. then

(4 868 368 + 1 101 348i)z + (3 750 240 + 790 128i).
Then by another subtraction,
(74 700−340400i)z2+(373 500−1 702 000i)z+(448 200−2 042 400i).
Here we can remove the common factor 100, so
(747 −3404i)z2 + (3735 −17020i)z + (4482 −20424i).
Now,
3735 −17020i
=
5(747 −3404i),
4482 −20424i
=
6(747 −3404i),
so when we divide the polynomial by 747 −3404i, we get
z2 + 5z + 6.
Then by another division,
z5+(9+i)z4+(27+10i)z3+(23+37i)z2+(−24+60i)z−36+36i
=

z2 + 5z + 6
 
z3 + (4 + i)z2 + (1 + 5i)z + (−6 + 6i)

.
Since this division was successful, the roots of z2 + 5z + 6 must be double roots, so z2 + 5z + 6 must
again be a divisor. Then
z3+(4+i)z2+(1+5i)z+(−6+6i) =

Symbolic currents and voltages
Example 6.1 Let ι1 = I1 sin (ωt + ϕ1) and ι2 = I2 sin (ωt + ϕ2) be two sine currents. Find
ι = ι1 + ι2 = I sin(ωt + ϕ),
ﬁrst by using the trigonometric addition formulæ, and then by using complex currents.
The addition formulæ. We get by a direct computation that
ι
=
ι1 + ι2 = I1 sin (ωt + ϕ1) + I2 sin (ωt + ϕ2)
=
I1 sin ωt · cos ϕ1 + I2 sin ωt · cos ϕ2 + I1 cos ωt · sin ϕ1 + I2 cos ωt · ϕ2
=
{I1 cos ϕ1 + I2 cos ϕ2} sin ωt {I1 sin ϕ1 + I2 sin ϕ2} cos ωt,
and
ι = I sin(ωt + ϕ) = I cos ϕ · sin ωt + I sin ϕ · cos ωt,
t ∈R.
When we identify the two expressions we obtain the equations
(10)
⎧
⎨
⎩
I cos ϕ = I1 cos ϕ1 + I2 cos ϕ2,
I sin ϕ = I1 sin ϕ1 + I2 sin ϕ2,
hence

so

and ϕ is described by the equations
cos ϕ = I1

sin ϕ = I1
I sin ϕ1 + I2

The complex current. If we instead use the complex current, we get
˜I = I eiϕ = I1eiϕ1 + I2eiϕ2 = I1 cos ϕ1 + I2 cos ϕ2 + i {I1 sin ϕ1 + I2 sin ϕ2} ,
and we conclude again (10).
The remaining part of the example is then treated as in the ﬁrst variant.

Geometrical point sets
Example 7.1 Find the plan point sets which are deﬁned by the conditions
(a) |z −a| + |z −b| = k,
(b)|z −a| + |z −b| ≤k,
where a, b ∈C and k ∈R+, and where k > |a −b|.
(a) 1) The geometric condition is:
• Find all point z, for which the sum of the distances from z to a and from z to b is a constant
k.
This is the deﬁnition of an ellipse with the focal points a and b. If, however, a = b, then we
get a circle instead of centrum a and radius k
2.
2) Analytically this is proved in the following way:
Put
z = x + iy,
a = a1 + ia2
and
b = b1 + ib2.
Then the equation becomes
#
(x −a1)2 + (y −a2)2 = k −
#
(x −b1)2 + (y −b2)2
(≥0).

By another squaring we get qualitatively the equation of an ellipse,

where x1 and y1 are linear expressions in x and y, and where x1 and y1 are linearly independent.

(a) Geometrically, {z ∈C | |z −2| = |z −2i|} is the set of all points z, which have the same distance
from 2 and 2i, thus a bisector.
By considering a ﬁgure we see that this bisector is
{z ∈C | z = t(1 + i), t ∈R}.
Alternatively the condition |z −2| = |z −2i| is equivalent to
|z −2|2 = (x −2)2 + y2 = |z −2i|2 = x2 + (y −2)2,
thus
x2 −4x + 4 + y2 = x2 + y2 −4y + 4,

Analytically it follows by a squaring that |z −4| > |z| is equivalent to the inequality
(x −4)2 + y2 > x2 + y2,
and we obtain by a reduction x < 2.
(c) The domain is the intersection of the open set |z| > 2 and the angular space −π < Arg z < π

i.e. the interior of the union of the ﬁrst and third and fourth quadrant.
Thus the complementary set is the union of the closed second quadrant and the closed disc of
centrum (0, 0) and of radius 2.

(b) The equation
Arg z −z1
z −z2
= k
is most easy to solve geometrically when we consider the corresponding circle, which goes through
the three points z, z1 and z2.
We se that ∠zz2C = ∠z2zC = x, because △z2Cz has two radii as sides. For the same reason,
∠z1zC = ∠zz1C = y and ∠Cz2z1 = ∠z1zC = ϕ. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always π,
hence it follows from △z1zz2 that
2(x + y + ϕ) = π,
and analogously of △Cz1z2 that
2ϕ + 2k = π,
hence
∠z1zz2 = x + y = k,
no matter where z is lying on the circle above the the line z1z2.
Remark 7.2 By means of the concept of conformal mapping, which will be treated in a later
book in this series, it is easy to prove that when z1 and z2 are kept ﬁxed, then the two families of
circles considered above are orthogonal. ♦
Remark 7.3 For given c and k it follows that
z −z1
z −z2
= c · eik = α.
If α ̸= 1, then
z = z2α −z1
α −1 ,
and z is uniquely determined.
Therefore, we may consider (c, k) as curvilinear coordinates in C \ {z1, z2}. ♦

where we do not compute the denominator |z −z2|2, because we shall only use that
|z −z2|2 > 0.
When we split into the real and the imaginary part, we get

|z−z2|2 {(y2−y1) x−(x2−x1) y+x2y1−x1y2} .
A check shows that v = 0 describes the line through z1 and z2 with exception of these two points.
On the other hand, we get for v = 0 that
Arg
z−z1
z−z2

= Arg(u+iv) = Arg u =
⎧
⎨
⎩
0
for u > 0,
π
for u < 0,
and it follows almost immediately from the expression of u above (due to the squared terms) that
u > 0, if and only if (x, y) lies on one of the line segments outside [z1, z2] (assuming that v = 0),
and hence u < 0 for (x, y) ∈[z1, z2], where [z1, z2] denotes the line segment in the plane between
z1 and z2.
In this way we ﬁx the curves for k = 0 and for k = π.
In our next case we have v > 0, thus (x, y) lies in one of the half planes determined by the line ℓ
through z1 and z2. We shall tacitly assume this in the following and not repeat ourselves.
It follows from v > 0 that
Arg
z −z1
z −z2

= Arg(u + iv) = Arccot
u
v

∈]0, π[,
because Arccot typically is more fundamental in the Theory of Complex Functions than Arctan.
The curves of this half plane therefore correspond to the equation
Arg
z −z1
z −z2


u
v

= k ∈]0, π[,
or equivalently
(11) u(x, y)
v(x, y) = cot k = c ∈R.
When we multiply by v(x, y) and insert the expressions of u(x, y) and v(x, y) we get by cancelling
|z −z2|2,
x2 −(x1 + x2) x + x1x2 + y2 −(y1 + y2) y + y1y2
= c {(y2 −y1) x −(x2 −x1) y + x2y1 −x1y2} ,
which is qualitatively the equation of a circle. If we put (x, y) = (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) into (11), it
follows that both sides become 0, so the system of curves is the restriction of all circles through

(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to the half plane determined by v > 0, i.e. determined by the line ℓthrough
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
If instead v < 0, then we get the other half plane, and

= k + π, i.e. to (11), because cot has period
π. We again derive (11), and we ﬁnd the same system of curves, only restricted to the other half
plane.

Example 7.6 Find the domain in the z-plane, which is characterized by the condition
z2 + a z + b
 < R2,
where a, b ∈C and R ∈R+. Indicate the values of R ∈R+, for which this domain is connected, and
for which is it disconnected.
Let α and β be the roots of the polynomial, i.e.
z2 + a z + b = (z −α)(z −β).
If α = β

, then we get an open disc of radius R and centrum −a
2. In this case, b = a2
4 , and
the domain is of course connected for every R ∈R+.
If α ̸= β, then
z2 + a z + b
 = |z −α| · |z −β| < R2,
thus the product of the distances from z to α, and from z to β, is smaller than R2. (The boundary
curves are also called Cassini’s rings).
The midpoint of the line segment between α and β is given by α + β
2
= −a
2. The set is disconnected,
if this point does not belong to the point set, and it is connected, if −a
2 belongs to the point set. If
we put z = −a

z2 + a z + b
 =

a2
4 −a · a

Since

this can also be expressed by
z2 + a z + b

The condition of connectedness is therefore,

thus
|α −β| < 2R.
The set is disconnected, if
0 < R ≤
b −a2
4
,
thus
0 < 2R ≤|α −β|.
