Preface
When I wrote the ﬁrst edition of Aluminum Recycling, I did so because I could ﬁnd 
nothing like it. Seven years later, this has changed. Two excellent books, dozens of 
conferences and workshops, numerous reviews, and a Wikipedia entry have made it 
clear that this is a topic whose time has come!
However, much of what I have seen makes it clear that there is still a need for a 
clear perspective of the recycling industry and the place that recycling has in the 
production and use of aluminum by our society. Recycling is too often viewed in 
near-religious terms and not seen as a business that needs to earn a proﬁt. The vague 
demand by ofﬁcialdom to recycle more often does not coincide with the technical or 
economic ability to make it happen. As a result, there is still a need for an explana­
tion of how recycling occurs and why things happen as they do. Much of this second 
edition is about the strategy and logic behind the choice of recycling technology as 
well as the different toys available to the industry.
Several changes have affected the aluminum recycling industry since the ﬁrst edi­
tion of this book. Among them are the following:
•	 The impact of Chinese demand for aluminum on global trade in scrap 
and the recycling industry in the rest of the world. As scrap has gravitated 
toward China, recyclers have closed their doors elsewhere; this has led to 
trade restrictions and outright export bans in some cases. Chapter 11 looks 
more closely at international scrap ﬂows and politics.
•	 The search for a reliable way to hedge aluminum scrap purchases. This 
has led, in part, to the LME North American Special Aluminum Alloy 
Contract, which has been an issue ever since. Chapter 4 has been largely 
rewritten to include material on scrap purchasing and use.
•	 The increasing use of aluminum in the transportation industry, particu­
larly cars and light trucks. This will change the nature of scrap supply and 
focus efforts on ways to sort and make optimal use of automotive scrap. 
Chapters 5 and 6 feature more thorough coverage of end-of-life vehicle 
(ELV) processing.
•	 The increasing reliance on old scrap as a source of recycled aluminum. 
Producing quality metal from less reliable input is a challenge the industry 
is increasingly facing. Several chapters in this edition reﬂect this concern.
Several of the Sherpas who helped guide me through the ﬁrst edition of 
Aluminum Recycling were willing to help with the second edition. In particular, 
I would like to thank Ray Peterson of Aleris International, Adam Gesing of Gesing 
Consultants, and Don Stewart (formerly of Alcoa) for answering numerous ques­
tions and correcting even more numerous errors. Others who suffered to make this 
book better include Subodh Das of Phinix LLC, David DeYoung of Alcoa, John 
Hryn of Argonne National Laboratory, Varužan Kevorkijan of Impol, John Newby

1 Introduction
The industrial-scale production and use of aluminum metal is less than 150 years 
old. Yet in that time, the industry has grown until it is second only to the iron and 
steel industry among metal producers. The growth in aluminum usage was particu­
larly rapid in the years following World War II, and every sector of the industry can 
point to products that were never produced from aluminum a generation ago but are 
now primarily manufactured from an aluminum alloy. Beverage cans, sports equip­
ment, electrical buswork, window frames—all are now produced from aluminum, 
along with thousands of other products.
Books on the production of aluminum metal have previously focused on its recov­
ery from naturally occurring raw materials. The principal natural ore for aluminum 
is bauxite, a mineral consisting primarily of hydrated aluminum oxides. Aluminum 
is recovered from bauxite by a selective leaching sequence known as the Bayer pro­
cess (Damgaard et al., 2009; OECD, 2010), which dissolves most of the aluminum 
while leaving impurities behind. The aluminum is recovered from the leach solution 
by precipitating it as aluminum hydroxide. The hydroxide is then dried and calcined 
to generate puriﬁed alumina. The calcined alumina is in turn fed to electrolytic cells 
containing a molten salt electrolyte based on cryolite (Na3AlF6). The alumina dis­
solves in the cryolite and is electrolyzed to generate molten aluminum metal and 
carbon dioxide gas. This process has been the sole approach for producing primary 
aluminum metal since the late 1800s and will likely continue in this role for decades 
to come.
However, in the last 50 years, an increasingly large fraction of the world’s alumi­
num supply has come from a different ore source. This ore is the aluminum scrap 
recovered from industrial waste and discarded postconsumer items. The treatment 
of this scrap to produce new aluminum metal and alloys is known as recycling, and 
metal produced this way is frequently termed secondary. Figure 1.1 shows the frac­
tion of world aluminum production from primary and secondary sources (OECD, 
2010); about one-third of the aluminum produced in the world is now obtained from 
secondary sources, and in some countries the percentage is much higher. As a result, 
the extraction of aluminum by recycling is now a topic worth describing.
The processes used for recycling aluminum scrap are very much different from 
those used to produce primary metal but in many ways follow the same general 
sequence. This sequence begins with mining the ore, followed by mineral processing 
and thermal pretreatment, and then a melting step. The metal is then reﬁned, cast 
into ingots or billets or rolled into sheets, and sent to customers. Aluminum recyclers 
also face similar challenges to the producers of primary aluminum: the need to pro­
duce a consistent alloy with the required chemistry, minimize energy usage, reduce 
the amount of waste generated, and manufacture the highest-quality product at the 
lowest possible cost from raw materials of uncertain chemistry and condition.

Aluminum Recycling
This book will lead readers through the sequence used for recycling scrap alu­
minum. It will start with a description of the minerals (aluminum alloys) that are 
contained in the ore body and describe the various locations where aluminum scrap 
is found. It will then describe the practices used to separate scrap aluminum from the 
other materials with which it is mixed and the means for purifying it of coatings and 
other impurities. Subsequent chapters will describe the furnaces used for remelting 
the recovered scrap and the reﬁning techniques used for improving its purity and 
quality. A ﬁnal chapter will consider the unique environmental and safety challenges 
that recycling operations face and how these challenges are addressed.
BRIEF HISTORY OF ALUMINUM RECYCLING
As will be seen, the successful recycling of aluminum depends on several factors:
•	 A plentiful and recurring supply of the metal, concentrated sufﬁciently in 
one area to justify the cost of collecting it
•	 An infrastructure for collecting the scrap metal, removing impurities, and 
delivering it to a recycling facility
•	 A method for recycling the metal that is economically competitive with the 
production of the metal from natural ores
•	 A market for the recycled metal, should its composition or quality differ 
from that of primary metal
The large-scale production of aluminum metal did not begin until the 1890s, with 
the advent of the Hall–Heroult electrolytic process for recovery of aluminum metal

Introduction
from a molten salt bath. Because of this, the beginnings of aluminum recycling did 
not occur until the early 1900s (Aluminum Association, 1998; Hollowell, 1939).
Figure 1.2 shows the fraction of aluminum consumption in the United States (the 
source of the most complete statistics) obtained from recycled material from 1913 
through 2011 (Buckingham et al., 2012). The changing percentages show the impact 
of several factors on the incentive to process scrap instead of producing primary 
metal:
•	 Sudden increases in demand: The importance of scrap as an aluminum sup­
ply jumped during both World Wars (Anderson, 1931; Morrison, 2005; Smith, 
1946), as demand for aluminum increased faster than new primary smelters 
could be built. As primary smelting capacity caught up with demand, the frac­
tion of aluminum supply obtained from secondary sources declined. Figure 1.3 
shows the ratio of old (postconsumer) to new (prompt industrial) scrap used in 
the United States over time (Buckingham et al., 2012). The ratio is higher in 
the 1940s than the 1950s, due to war-time scrap drives.
•	 The cost of producing primary aluminum: Scrap became a less important 
source of aluminum metal in the United States during the late 1930s and 1950s. 
The reason was the construction of dams in the Columbia and Tennessee River 
valleys, which generated large amounts of low-cost hydroelectric power. This 
in turn encouraged the construction of new primary smelting capacity, which 
reduced the demand for scrap (Gitlitz, 2003). In recent years, increases in the 
cost of power have led to the closing of primary smelters in the United States 
and Europe (Home, 2009; Walker, 2012), making secondary aluminum produc­
tion more signiﬁcant. Figure 1.4 shows the amount of scrap used by different 
consumers in the United States over time (Chen and Graedel, 2012). Secondary 
smelters, which convert scrap into alloys suitable for casting, are a steady cus­
tomer. Integrated producers, which are primary smelters and fabricators that

produce wrought alloy from primary metal or remelted low-alloy scrap, were 
not signiﬁcant users of scrap until the 1950s. This is because in the 1950s and 
1960s, the availability of cheap primary aluminum made scrap acquisition 
uneconomic. As primary metal production costs rose in the 1970s and 1980s, 
scrap began to look more attractive to integrated producers, and the fraction of

Introduction
used scrap recycled in the primary industry rose as well. Integrated produc­
ers currently use more scrap than primary metal (Choate and Green, 2007). 
Figure 1.5 illustrates aluminum production in China (Chen and Shi, 2012) and 
the share from secondary sources. The increasing percentage of secondary 
aluminum production through 2000 is the result of increasing availability of 
scrap as aluminum products reached the end of their useful life. The relative 
decline after 2000 reﬂects a dramatic increase in primary metal production, as 
the development of domestic bauxite reserves lowered the cost of production.
•	 The influence of government: Starting in the late 1960s, governments at all 
levels became increasingly concerned about the amount of waste discarded 
by industrial societies. The response was a series of laws and regulatory ini­
tiatives designed to minimize waste disposal and encourage recycling. The 
increase in the old/new scrap ratio from the 1970s seen in Figure 1.3 resulted 
largely from efforts to collect and recycle aluminum used beverage contain­
ers (UBCs). These efforts were spurred by the aluminum industry, which was 
attempting to avoid restrictions and mandatory deposits on the cans.
•	 Improved quality: In the early years of the industry, the secondary alumi­
num produced by recycling facilities was considered of inferior quality to 
primary metal (Anderson, 1931; Smith, 1946). This was due in part to poor 
chemistry control, which resulted in uncertain composition (Mahfoud and 
Emadi, 2010). It was also due to poor removal of dross and slags, which 
led to metal with too many inclusions (Dart, 2008). As tighter composition 
control was enforced and improved reﬁning technology eliminated more 
impurities and inclusions, this stigma began to disappear.

Aluminum Recycling
Aluminum recycling was at ﬁrst conducted directly, with purchased scrap being 
consumed by foundries without prior treatment (Aluminum Association, 1998). 
However, as scrap began to travel over greater distances and the reliability of its 
composition improved, it became desirable to produce a scrap product of greater 
consistency. As a result, secondary smelters began to appear after 1910 (Hollowell, 
1939). These smelters produce a secondary ingot from mixed loads of scrap, with a 
composition matching one of several standardized grades. Table 1.1 lists the com­
positions of secondary alloys speciﬁed in the United Kingdom in 1946 (Smith, 
1946). The alloys correspond to the primary alloys popular at the time and were 
used mostly in foundries. The alloys currently produced by secondary smelters will 
be described in Chapter 4.
ADVANTAGES (AND CHALLENGES) OF RECYCLING
There are several advantages to society when aluminum is produced by recycling 
rather than by primary production from bauxite ores:
Energy savings: Figure 1.6, derived from data quoted by Green (2007), shows 
the typical energy requirement in 1998 to produce one metric ton of primary and 
secondary aluminum. The high energy use (186,262 MJ/mt) for primary production 
is largely due to the molten salt electrolysis of alumina. Fossil fuel is required to pro­
duce the carbon electrodes and remelt the ingots produced by electrolysis, and large 
inputs of electrical energy are required to overcome the resistance of the electrolyte 
and break down the dissolved alumina in the bath. Fossil fuel use in the Bayer pro­
cess (feedstock) is also a signiﬁcant fraction of the total.
Direct energy usage in the production of secondary (recycled) aluminum is much 
smaller (11,690 MJ/mt). The largest energy user is the melting step, which is usu­
ally performed using fossil fuel. The direct energy use is reduced by 93% from that 
required to produce primary aluminum.

Aluminum Recycling
Reduced waste disposal: Primary aluminum production generates solid waste at 
every step in the process. The most signiﬁcant of these are mine wastes, the red mud 
residue created during alumina puriﬁcation, and spent pot liner from the electrolytic 
cells (Luo and Soria, 2008; OECD, 2010). While aluminum recycling generates solid 
wastes as well (primarily the dross and salt slag created during remelting), the vol­
umes are much smaller. Ding et al. (2012) claim that the mass of solid waste gener­
ated per ton of recycled aluminum (423 kg) is 85% lower than that for primary metal 
(3066 kg). Lave et al. (1999) estimate that recycling aluminum reduces hazardous 
waste generation by over 100 kg/ton of metal produced.
Reduced emissions: Primary aluminum production generates both hazardous 
(ﬂuorides, sulfur dioxide) and nonhazardous (carbon dioxide) emissions. While alu­
minum recycling presents its own air quality challenges, the numbers are again 
much reduced. Table 1.2 compares emissions from primary aluminum with that 
of secondary (Ding et al., 2012). The amount of CO2 emitted per ton of metal is 
reduced 95% by recycling, and CO generation is reduced by more than 99%; ﬂu­
oride and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions are almost entirely 
eliminated. Figure 1.7 compares several environmental indicators for the two types 
of aluminum production; the advantage of recycling is obvious.
Reduced capital cost: Primary aluminum production requires a mining opera­
tion, a Bayer process plant to produce puriﬁed alumina, and an electrolytic pot line 
to extract aluminum metal from the alumina. The capital equipment used for recy­
cling is less complex and thus less expensive. Estimates suggest that producing alu­
minum by recycling rather than by primary methods reduces capital costs per ton by 
90% (Choate and Green, 2007).
Challenges to the industry include the following:
Ensuring adequate supply: Scrap is a difﬁcult sort of ore body to utilize, since 
it tends to be spread out over the landscape rather than concentrated in a single

Introduction
location. As a result, its collection can be a problem. This is particularly true for old 
scrap, as will be seen in Chapter 3. The cost of collecting and processing old scrap 
can make this type of recycling uneconomic.
Emission control: While gaseous emissions from scrap aluminum remelting are 
much lower than for primary production, secondary aluminum smelters and remelt­
ers are more likely to be located in urban areas (Anderson, 1931), making them 
subject to tighter emissions standards (Martchek, 1997). Furthermore, the poten­
tial emissions from secondary producers are much different than those of primary 
producers. The processing of greasy and oily scrap, along with scrap coated with 
organic resins or lacquers, generates off-gases with organic compounds that must 
be eliminated.
Treatment and disposal of byproducts: Aluminum recycling generates solid waste 
products not produced in primary smelting. The most signiﬁcant of these is salt cake, 
the residue of smelting under a salt ﬂux (Aluminum Association, 1998). Another is 
the shredder fluff produced when junk automobiles are shredded to separate the 
recyclable metals they contain from each other. Recyclers are working on new ways 
to treat these solid wastes and to eliminate them if possible.

2 Ore Body
In traditional extractive metallurgy, the raw material used to produce a metal is an 
ore mined from the earth. The ore contains minerals, chemical compounds that 
include the desired metallic element. It also contains other chemical compounds that 
do not include the metallic element; these are known as gangue minerals. The ore 
mineral contains impurity elements in addition to the metallic element. These must 
be chemically separated from the metal during the extraction process.
In aluminum recycling, the ore body consists of scrap metal found on the ground, 
rather than in it. However, the similarities are greater than what might appear at ﬁrst. 
Aluminum scrap comes with gangue minerals of its own, in the form of attached 
items and coatings. It also includes impurity elements that can have a signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence on the recycling process. As a result, a description of the ore body for alu­
minum recycling will explain why some processes and strategies have been adopted.
This chapter will introduce the families of aluminum alloys and the products 
made from them. It is not meant to be an extensive discussion. Other sources pro­
vide a much more complete description of aluminum metallurgy and products, and 
the reader is encouraged to consult these for more information. The purpose of this 
chapter is to describe the raw material that the recycler obtains and how it impacts 
the available process options.
WROUGHT ALUMINUM ALLOY SYSTEM 
(ALTENPOHL, 1998; KAUFMAN, 2000)
As the name suggests, wrought aluminum alloys are those that are turned into con­
sumer products by a solid-state process—extrusion, forging, or rolling. There are over 
200 such alloys. Nearly all consist of at least 90% aluminum, and most over 95%. 
Wrought aluminum alloys are divided into eight classes based on the choice of alloying 
element, according to a system developed in the United States in the 1950s. Table 2.1 
lists the composition of several common aluminum alloys from the different classes.
1xxx alloys are the purest aluminum alloys, containing 99% or more aluminum. 
The high aluminum content ensures high electrical conductivity and corrosion resis­
tance but results in lower strength than other alloys. 1xxx alloys are used in electrical 
applications, as well as for packaging foil and for chemical equipment. Because the 
minimum required aluminum percentage is so high, it is difﬁcult to use scrap for 
producing these alloys. As a result, only primary aluminum and carefully selected 
1xxx alloy scrap are used. However, 1xxx scrap can be readily used for producing 
alloys from any other series.
2xxx alloys contain 1.0%–6.0% copper, depending on the alloy. Other alloy­
ing elements in 2xxx alloys include iron, magnesium, manganese, and/or silicon. 
These are among the highest-strength aluminum alloys and are also noted for

their toughness. They are widely used in aircraft and for fasteners as well. 2xxx 
alloys are not very corrosion resistant and so are typically painted or clad before 
being put in service. Many aluminum alloys outside the 2xxx series are limited to 
0.30% copper or less (Bijlhouwer, 2009), and so 2xxx scrap cannot be used to pro­
duce wrought alloys from most other classes (Froelich et al., 2007).
The number of 3xxx series alloys is limited, but their use is widespread. These 
alloys feature up to 1.5% manganese and usually contain 0.7%–0.8% iron. They can 
be strain hardened and have excellent corrosion resistance. These alloys are best 
known for their use in the bodies of aluminum beverage cans (Das et al., 2010). They 
are also widely used in cooking utensils, automobile radiators, rooﬁng and siding, 
and heat exchangers. Restrictions on the use of 3xxx scrap center around the manga­
nese and iron content, which are often unwelcome in other aluminum alloys.
The number of 4xxx alloys is also limited, and these alloys are not as widely 
used as other classes. 4xxx alloys contain up to 13% silicon, which improves their 
wear resistance. Their primary use is in forgings such as aircraft pistons. They are 
also used for welding other aluminum alloys. The high silicon content makes them 
largely unusable for recycling into anything but casting alloys or 4xxx wrought 
alloys (Froelich et al., 2007).
5xxx alloys feature up to 5.5% magnesium. They are especially noted for their 
corrosion resistance and toughness and are easily welded. As a result, the use of 5xxx 
alloys is widespread. They are used in items as large as bridges and storage tanks and 
as small as the lids of beverage cans (Das et al., 2010). They are also increasingly 
popular in automotive structural applications, notably body panels. Magnesium is the 
only alloying element that can be easily reﬁned from molten aluminum. As a result, 
5xxx alloys are more recyclable for wrought-alloy production than most other alloys. 
However, the cost of magnesium recommends that these alloys be recycled back into 
5xxx compositions if possible.
The 6xxx alloys also feature up to 1.5% magnesium, along with silicon levels 
up to 1.8%. The presence of these two elements makes them heat treatable, and 
the low overall alloy content gives them extrudability. Their best-known uses are in 
architecture, but they are also used in automotive applications, in welded structural 
applications, and as high-strength conductor wires. As with 4xxx alloys, the primary 
limitation on their recyclability is the silicon content.
7xxx series alloys are the most heavily alloyed of the wrought aluminum alloys. 
They feature 1.5%–10% zinc, depending on the alloy. 7xxx alloys also have up to 3% 
magnesium, and some feature up to 2.6% copper. Heat-treated 7xxx alloys have the 
highest strengths of the common wrought aluminum alloys and impressive tough­
ness levels. As with the 2xxx alloys, their lower corrosion resistance usually results 
in them being painted or coated when put in service. Historically, their greatest use 
has been in the aircraft industry, but they have also found use in transport applica­
tions. Their zinc and copper content make 7xxx alloys difﬁcult to recycle into any­
thing except 7xxx alloy or some casting alloys (Froelich et al., 2007).
8xxx alloys feature alloying elements not used in the other series. Boron, iron, lithium, 
nickel, tin, and vanadium are some of the elements used in 8xxx alloys. Because this is a 
catch-all category, 8xxx alloys cannot be characterized in terms of property or use. One 
notable trend in aluminum alloy development reﬂected in this series is the increasing

number of lithium-containing aluminum alloys. These alloys have an especially high 
modulus of elasticity and are increasingly used in aircraft construction to save weight 
without sacriﬁcing stiffness. Lithium is also added to some 2xxx alloys. The recycling of 
lithium-containing alloys is a particular challenge, since the value of the lithium contained 
in these parts recommends closed-loop recycling into the same alloy if at all possible.
As previously suggested, the difﬁculty in recycling wrought aluminum alloys is 
the problem of tolerance, the ability of an alloy to absorb elements not normally 
present in its composition (Kevorkijan, 2010). To provide an example, the wrought 
aluminum fraction of an automobile will be considered as a potential charge to a 
recycling furnace. A simpliﬁed breakdown for the wrought aluminum might consist 
of the following (Zapp et al., 2002):
•	 35% alloy 6060 (0.45% Si, 0.2% Fe, 0.5% Mg)
•	 11% alloy 6082 (1.0% Si, 0.3% Fe, 0.7% Mn, 0.9% Mg)
•	 10% alloy 3003 (0.5% Si, 0.5% Fe, 1.3% Mn)
•	 9% alloy 5182 (0.1% Si, 0.2% Fe, 0.4% Mn, 4.5% Mg)
•	 14% alloy 5754 (0.3% Si, 0.2% Fe, 0.4% Mn, 3.2% Mg)
•	 15% alloy 6016 (1.25% Si, 0.3% Fe, 0.5% Mg)
•	 6% alloy 7020 (0.2% Si, 0.3% Fe, 0.3% Mn, 1.2% Mg, 4.5% Zn)
Melted down, this mixture would produce an alloy analyzing 0.57% Si, 0.26% Fe, 
0.32% Mn, 1.27% Mg, and 0.27% Zn. The zinc content is higher than the allowed 
maximum for many common alloys outside the 7xxx series. However, the silicon 
content is higher than allowed in 7xxx compositions. As a result, the wrought scrap 
cannot be used to produce new wrought alloy unless one or more of the impuri­
ties are diluted by the addition of primary metal. If cast scrap is included in the 
mix, the problem becomes even worse. Table 2.2, adapted from the work of Froelich 
et al. (2007), shows the compositional compatibility of different classes of cast and 
wrought aluminum alloy. The number of − markers indicating incompatibility illus­
trates the tolerance problem. The development of recycle-friendly alloys with impu­
rity limits that can tolerate higher scrap inputs from other systems has become a 
research priority within the aluminum industry (Das, 2007; Gaustad et al., 2010).
CAST ALUMINUM ALLOY SYSTEM (ALTENPOHL, 
1998; KAUFMAN, 2000)
There are now over 200 cast aluminum alloys in addition to the wrought compositions. 
Cast alloys tend to have higher alloy content than wrought alloys. This makes them dif­
ﬁcult to recycle into anything other than cast alloy, since the removal of most alloying ele­
ments from molten aluminum is impractical. As is the case for wrought alloys, cast alloys 
are divided into classes based on the alloying elements used, using a system devised in the 
1950s. The numbering of these alloys is meant to correspond roughly to similar classes of 
wrought alloys. Table 2.3 lists the compositions of the most commonly used cast alloys.
1xx.x cast alloys are quite rare in service but have aluminum contents of 99% 
or higher, similar to 1xxx wrought alloys. Generally, they are produced only as 
ingot, for remelting and alloying to a different composition. Their use as consumer

Aluminum Recycling
products is limited to applications requiring high electrical conductivity, such as 
pressure-cast integral conductor bars.
2xx.x alloys all contain 3.5%–10.7% copper, just as 2xxx wrought alloys feature 
copper as the primary alloying agent. 2xx.x alloys can also have signiﬁcant levels of 
iron, magnesium, nickel, or silicon. These alloys have the highest high-temperature 
strength and hardness of the cast alloys and require heat treatment to prevent stress 
corrosion cracking. As with the 2xxx wrought alloys, coating or painting is usually 
required by the lower corrosion resistance of these alloys.
The 3xx.x alloys are the most widely used of all cast aluminum alloys. They have 
silicon levels ranging from 4.5% to over 20% and copper levels ranging from 0.5% 
to 5.0%. Some 3xx.x alloys also include magnesium (0.2%–1.5%) and a few have 
nickel (0.5%–3.0%). The high silicon content increases ﬂuidity, reduces cracking, 
and minimizes shrinkage porosity in castings. The copper and magnesium provide 
solid solution hardening. The nickel reduces the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (as 
does higher silicon content), which is useful in pistons and cylinders.
4xx.x alloys also feature 3.3%–13% silicon but much smaller levels of other elements. 
Copper, iron, or nickel are sometimes added. Their ductility and impact resistance make 
them useful in applications such as food-handling equipment and marine ﬁttings.
As is the case with 5xxx wrought alloys, the speciﬁcations for 5xx.x cast alloys 
include 3.5%–10.5% magnesium. Smaller levels of iron, silicon, and zinc are some­
times used. Along with 2xx.x, 7xx.x, and 8xx.x alloys, 5xx.x alloys are not as cast­
able as high-silicon compositions, requiring some care in mold design.
The 7xx.x cast alloy speciﬁcations require 2.7%–8.0% zinc, similar to their 7xxx 
wrought counterparts. Magnesium (0.5%–2.0%) is present in many of these alloys, 
and chromium (0.2%–0.6%) is sometimes added as well. They have better corrosion 
resistance than other cast alloys and develop high strength through natural aging, 
eliminating the need for heat treatment.
Finally, the 8xx.x series of cast alloys employ 5.5%–7.0% tin and 0.7%–4.0% cop­
per, which provide strength and lubricity. These alloys are used for bearing applica­
tions, such as connecting rods and crankcase bearings. 8xx.x alloys are much less 
used than alloys from other series.
As with the wrought alloys, the difﬁculty in recycling cast alloys is one of tolerance. 
Most alloys outside the 7xx.x series have a strict upper limit on the allowable level of 
zinc, while some 3xx.x alloys have low maximum allowable levels of iron. An excep­
tion to this is alloy 380.0, which has reasonably high levels of all the major alloying 
elements. As a result, 380.0 (7.5%–9.5% Si, 1.5% Fe, 3.0%–4.0% Cu, 0.5% Mn, 0.5% 
Ni, <0.1% Mg, <0.15% Sn) is often the main product of secondary smelters trying to 
make use of all the available cast scrap. This alloy can then be diluted by customers 
with 1xxx or 1xx.x scrap, or with primary metal, to produce more desirable alloys.
For example, if 100 kg of 380.0 scrap (8.5% Si, 2.0% Fe, 3.5% Cu, 0.5% Mn, 
0.5% Ni, 0.1% Sn, 3.0% Zn) is diluted with 200 kg of primary metal (0.05% Si, 
0.06% Fe), the result will be 300 kg of metal analyzing 2.87% Si, 0.71% Fe, 1.17% 
Cu, 0.17% Mn, 0.17% Ni, 0.03% Sn, and 1.00% Zn. By adding additional amounts 
of some elements, the melter can create casting alloy 332.0 (9.5% Si, 1.2% Fe, 3.0% 
Cu, 0.5 Mn, 1.0% Mg, 0.5% Ni, 1.0% Zn, 0.25% Ti), a popular alloy for automo­
tive castings. The required level of dilution with primary aluminum is substantial.

However, this tactic allows the recycling of all the cast aluminum scrap, without the 
need to separate one alloy from another.
PRODUCT MIX (ALTENPOHL, 1998)
The market for aluminum products is generally separated into seven segments—
building and construction, transportation, consumer durables, electrical, machinery 
and equipment, packaging, and other. Figure 2.1 illustrates the fraction of aluminum 
products falling into these applications in several countries. As can be seen, the prod­
uct mix varies substantially from one country to another, which ultimately affects the 
nature of the scrap supply.
The properties of aluminum that make it most valuable in the building and con­
struction sector are its low density, its high corrosion resistance, and the design ﬂex­
ibility resulting from the ease with which aluminum can be extruded. Examples of 
applications beneﬁting from these advantages include the following:
•	 Mobile military bridges
•	 Window frames
•	 Highway guard rails
•	 Loading ramps
•	 Greenhouses
•	 Building cladding and facades
•	 Flag poles
•	 Mobile and bridge cranes
•	 Ladders
•	 Automatic doors
•	 Road sign supports
•	 Cable support towers

Aluminum Recycling
Most of the alloys used in this sector are wrought alloys, particularly from the 
5xxx and 6xxx series (Jones, 2002). The more commonly used alloys are 3103, 3105, 
5005, 5083, 5085, 5754, 6005, 6060, 6061, 6063, and 6082. Much of the use of alumi­
num in this sector is relatively new, and the lifetime of the products in which alumi­
num is used is fairly lengthy—20 years is common, and some items may be in service 
as long as 50 years (McMillan et al., 2010; Menzie et al., 2010). As a result, the share 
of old scrap derived from building and construction debris has increased from almost 
zero in 1999 to 8% of the world supply (IAI, 2009) and will increase further.
Gangue materials and potential contaminants in aluminum scrap recovered from 
building and construction debris include:
•	 Ceramic materials, including brick, concrete, and glass
•	 Organic coatings, such as polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (Jones, 2002)
•	 Dirt and paint
•	 Polymers, including plastic and rubber
•	 Steel pieces, including those attached to the aluminum
As Figure 2.1 points out, the fraction of aluminum used for electrical engineer­
ing applications in developing countries is much higher than in developed coun­
tries (Menzie et al., 2010). This is the result of continuing construction of the 
energy grid in developing countries, which uses large amounts of aluminum cable. 
However, aluminum use in wire and cable is growing in developed countries as well 
(Aluminum Association, 2012), due to substitution encouraged by the high price of 
copper (Kooiman, 2011). Alloys 1350 and 6201 have been traditionally used for wire 
and rod and alloy 6101 for bus bars and other large conductors; however, 8000-series 
alloys such as 8017 and 8176 have superior creep resistance, which makes them 
more suitable as building wire (Southwire, 2012). Their use complicates recycling 
efforts, since 6xxx and 8xxx scrap cannot be used to produce new 1xxx alloy. A small 
amount of 1xx.x cast alloy is also used. For smaller size cable and wire, builders 
continue to favor copper over aluminum. Because of this and the long service life of 
these products, wire and cable will be a small fraction of the aluminum scrap supply 
in the future.
Potential gangue impurities in aluminum scrap recovered from electrical prod­
ucts include the following:
•	 Steel supports from steel-reinforced cable
•	 Copper wire mixed with aluminum wire
•	 Plastics used to coat wire and cable
The use of aluminum in packaging can be divided into two subcategories: rigid 
containers (cans) and foil products. Aluminum beverage cans were introduced in 
the United States in 1959 and over the next two decades came to dominate the mar­
ket for small soft drink and beer containers, driving the competing steel can out of 
this market. While some competition from plastic and glass remains, the average 
American now uses 350 aluminum cans per year. Several factors have contributed to 
this, including the recyclability of the can. Aluminum is the only packaging mate­
rial that has signiﬁcant value as a recyclable material. This generates an incentive to 
recover the cans, resulting in a higher recycling rate than for plastic or glass.

Ore Body
In Europe and Japan, the popularity of aluminum cans has not spread as quickly 
as in North America. Per capita use of aluminum cans in Europe and South America 
is about one-seventh of that in the United States (Woehlke, 2011). In Japan, the alu­
minum can has become predominant over the steel can for soft drink and beer con­
tainers but still faces signiﬁcant competition from glass bottles and paper cartons 
(Inada, 2010; JAA, 2010). Aluminum is also used in food cans and aerosol contain­
ers but is not as popular in these applications (Golden, 2009).
The typical aluminum beverage can is produced from two alloys (Woehlke, 2011). 
The can body (83% of the total weight) is produced from alloy 3004. The lid and tab 
(17% of the total weight) is made of alloy 5182. This mixture presents a challenge in 
recycling the can, since the alloy produced by simply remelting the can has too much 
magnesium to be used as 3004 and too much manganese to be used as 5182. As a 
result, UBCs must be diluted after melting with primary metal or low-alloy scrap in 
order to produce more cans. The aluminum industry has made efforts to develop a 
single alloy that can be used for both the body and lid (Nishiyama, 2002); this would 
allow for truly direct recycling.
Aluminum strip and foil is also used to produce a variety of pouches, food trays, 
and single-serve beverage containers (Golden, 2009). These containers are often pro­
duced from rolled 1xxx alloys or 8011 (Gesing, 2001) and so ought to be easily 
recycled. However, packages of this sort are composite structures, with large quanti­
ties of paper and plastic, which must be separated from the thin aluminum foil before 
the metal can be remelted. Because of this, the cost of recycling per unit weight of 
metal recovered is high. This reduces the incentive to recover foil- and strip-based 
packaging from the waste stream and results in much lower recycling rates for this 
type of aluminum.
Contaminants in aluminum recovered from packaging applications include, 
among others, the following (Evermore Recycling, 2012):
•	 Paper and plastic, especially from pouches and composite boxes
•	 Steel cans, in recovered UBCs
•	 Rocks, dirt, sand, and glass
•	 Organic coatings and paint on can surfaces
•	 Batteries
•	 Excessive moisture
A variety of cast and wrought aluminum alloys are used to produce consumer 
durables. Examples include the following:
•	 3003 (cookware)
•	 3004 (lamp bases)
•	 5005 (utensils, appliances)
•	 5052, 6463 (appliances)
•	 5056 (insect screens)
•	 5457, 5657 (appliance trim)
•	 6005 (TV antennas)
•	 6061 (furniture, canoes)
•	 6063 (furniture)

24
Aluminum Recycling
•	 360.0 (cookware, instrument cases, cover plates)
•	 380.0 (lawnmowers, dental equipment)
•	 B443.0 (wafﬂe irons)
•	 513.0 (ornamental)
However, the majority of aluminum use as consumer durables is for so-called 
white goods (Cooper, 2010). These include refrigerators, freezers, ranges, dishwash­
ers, and clothes washers and dryers. The percentage of aluminum in white goods is 
small (CAMA, 2005), but the number produced each year makes them a substantial 
aluminum market nonetheless.
Generalizing about this category is not possible, given the diversity. However, 
scrap from this class of items is more likely to come with attached contaminants than 
other types of aluminum scrap and thus requires more processing. This kind of scrap 
is also less likely to be deliberately collected than others, meaning that its collection 
rate is usually lower.
The use of aluminum in transport applications has long affected recycling pat­
terns. In fact, the ﬁrst major surge in recycling rates resulted from the scrapping of 
aluminum parts from surplus aircraft following World War I (Morrison, 2005). More 
recently, the transport sector has become the largest user of aluminum, meaning that 
used vehicles are an increasingly substantial fraction of the available scrap supply 
(McMillan et al., 2010). As a result, the patterns of aluminum alloy use in transporta­
tion are especially signiﬁcant.
Aluminum continues to be the primary material for aircraft construction, despite 
inroads made by composites. 2xxx alloys have long been heavily used in aircraft 
construction, in particular 2024, 2124, 2224, and 2324. Some 7xxx alloys (7055, 
7075, 7150) are also used. In recent years, lithium-containing alloys (2090, 2091, 
8090) have become part of the mix. Aluminum is also extensively used in passenger 
ships, particularly 5xxx and 6xxx alloys (JAA, 2010). However, as Figure 2.2 shows

(Cooper, 2010), these sectors are a very small fraction of aluminum transport use. 
Aluminum use in trains is more signiﬁcant, particularly for freight cars but increas­
ingly for passenger cars as well (Skillingberg and Green, 2007). Wrought alloys are 
used, particularly from the 5xxx and 6xxx series.
However, most of the aluminum used in transport applications goes into auto­
mobiles, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks, and motorcycles (Cooper, 
2010). This use began after World War II and has increased steadily since. The 
average use of aluminum was 148 kg per vehicle in the United States in 2009 and is 
projected to reach 200 or even 250 kg per vehicle by 2025 (Gopalkrishnan, 2012). 
Automotive and other vehicles have a much longer life span than cans, so the 
effect of this increased usage on the scrap supply will not be noticed immediately. 
Nevertheless, it is projected that over 30% of all aluminum scrap will come from 
transport uses by 2040.
As the amount of aluminum has increased, the mix of alloys has changed. Nearly 
all of the early aluminum usage in automobiles was in the form of cast alloys, and 
cast alloys still comprise the vast majority of automotive aluminum (Cui and Roven, 
2010; EAA, 2012). 3xxx alloys are widely used in powertrain components, particu­
larly alloys 319, 356, 380, 383, and 384 (Gesing, 2005). Because of this, 56% of 
all cast-alloy aluminum production worldwide is used in automotive applications 
(Gopalkrishnan, 2012) and 75% in transport applications overall (Golden, 2009). 
However, the advantages of aluminum use in cars and trucks, particularly for weight 
reduction, create incentive for the use of wrought aluminum as well as cast alloys. 
Numerous applications use wrought alloys (Zapp et al., 2002), including bumpers 
(6061, 7003, 7108); seat frames (6061, 6063); hang-on parts like fenders, hoods, and 
deck lids (2022, 5182, 6016, 6111); radiators and condensers (1100, 3003, 4147); 
and structural parts like control arms and subframes (5754, 6016, 6061, 6082). The 
development of 6000-series alloys for panels is a particular focus of the industry 
(Sakurai, 2008). Almost 20% of extruded and rolled aluminum in Europe is now used 
for transport applications (Golden, 2009).
Common contaminants in transport-sector aluminum scrap include the following:
•	 Ferrous scrap, both attached (rivets) and separate pieces
•	 Magnesium and zinc die castings in automotive scrap
•	 Plastic and fabric in shredded automotive scrap
The inﬂuence of automotive aluminum use on recycling patterns is signiﬁcant, 
since most recycled aluminum is used in this sector. The current predominance of 
cast alloys makes this easier, since cast alloys have a higher tolerance for impurities 
and can absorb a wider variety of scrap. This is particularly true of alloys 319.0 and 
380.0 (Tessieri and Ng, 1995), making their employment in automotive applications 
even more attractive. However, the increasing use of wrought alloys may change this 
picture (Rombach, 2002), since the lower alloying-element content of wrought alloys 
makes them much less tolerant of mixed scrap loads. Because of this, the need exists 
for a means of separating aluminum scrap by alloy or alloy group. This has resulted 
in a series of technical advances in scrap processing with signiﬁcant potential. These 
will be discussed in Chapter 5.

3 Scrap Collection
MATERIALS LIFE CYCLE (HENSTOCK, 1996)
Figure 3.1 illustrates the life cycle in which raw materials are processed to generate 
consumer products and then disposed of after the life of those products ends. In the 
case of aluminum, the raw materials are the bauxite ore from which the metal is 
generated, the petroleum coke used to produce anodes and cathodes, and the other 
chemicals used in the Bayer process and the electrolytic cells. Primary production 
is the process by which aluminum is extracted from the bauxite, electrowon from a 
molten salt electrolyte, reﬁned and cast into ingot or billet, and shipped to customers. 
The engineering materials generated by this process include pure aluminum and the 
alloys described in Chapter 2. Manufacturing is the process by which the ingot or 
billet is transformed into consumer products; as mentioned in Chapter 2, most alu­
minum placed in service is classiﬁed either as cast or wrought product. The types of 
products made from aluminum, and their usage patterns, have signiﬁcant impacts on 
recycling technology and will be discussed in greater detail.
The scrap streams in Figure 3.1 are numbered according to their classiﬁcation. 
Stream (1) is better known as in-house, home, or run-around scrap. In-house scrap 
consists of pure aluminum metal or alloy with a known composition, without any 
coatings or attachments. Ingot and billet croppings are the most common sources 
of in-house scrap, along with edge trimmings from sheet and plate. Because it is 
unadulterated, in-house scrap can be directly recycled simply by putting it back into 
the melting furnace. As a result, it is usually not included in recycling statistics. It 
is generated in both primary and secondary production plants. In addition, directly 
recycled manufacturing scrap (stream 2a) can be considered in-house scrap as well. 
Examples include casting gates and runners, skeletons from stamping operations, 
and croppings from extrusions. In-house scrap can usually be recycled directly back 
into the same alloy composition in which it was produced in the ﬁrst place. This is a 
good example of closed-loop recycling.
Streams (2), (2ʹ), and (in some cases) (2a) are known as new, prompt industrial, 
or internal arising scrap. Every manufacturing operation generates at least some 
new scrap, and some generate considerable amounts. Primary production, second­
ary production, and some manufacturing facilities also generate dross, which can 
be considered a form of new scrap as well. Table 3.1 lists the average percent of 
the input aluminum turned into scrap by manufacturing operations in different 
industrial sectors (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004). The values range from as little 
as 10% in foil production to 60% in airplane production. If the metal or alloy has 
not been adulterated, it can sometimes be recycled directly within the generating 
facility (stream 2a). Otherwise, it must be processed to a purity and form suitable 
for recycling and returned to a metal production facility. Open-loop recycling of 
this sort is the role of the secondary materials industries in Figure 3.1. The upgraded 

30
Aluminum Recycling
scrap produced by the secondary materials industries is purchased by both primary 
(stream 2) and secondary (stream 2ʹ) production facilities. In recent years, primary 
producers in industrialized countries have become more active in scrap purchasing.
Finally, streams (3), (3ʹ), and (3a) are collectively known as old, obsolete, post­
consumer, or external arising scrap. As the name suggests, old scrap consists of 
consumer products that have been discarded or taken out of service. The amount of 
old scrap available depends on several variables:
•	 Urbanization: In order for old scrap to be economically collected, it must be 
present in large enough amounts to justify the effort. As a result, the pres­
ence of abandoned cars, appliances, cans and bottles, etc., is much more 
apparent in rural areas.
•	 Ease of recycling: Large bulky items such as castings or extrusions are 
much more easily recycled than thin, heavily adulterated items such as alu­
minum foil and wiring. As a result, the former is more likely to be recycled. 
Table 3.2 shows the product life and recycling rate in the United States 
for aluminum products in various sectors (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004).

Scrap Collection
The higher recycling rates are associated with transportation products, for 
which a well-developed recycling infrastructure exists.
•	 Concentration: Aluminum cans require more processing to recycle, but the 
percentage of aluminum in them is above 90%. The extrusions and alumi­
num conduit in building debris are easier to remelt, but the concentration 
of aluminum in the debris is about 0.01%. As a result, the recycling rate for 
aluminum cans is much higher than for aluminum from construction debris.
•	 Legislation: European Union regulations require the recycling of construc­
tion debris. As a result, the recycling rate for aluminum from buildings in 
Europe is 80% or higher (EAA, 2004), rather than the 15% US rate cited in 
Table 3.2 (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004). Providing a subsidy or other eco­
nomic incentive also increases recycling rates, as demonstrated in Taiwan 
and the Netherlands (Lee, 1997; van Schaik et al., 2001).
•	 Industrial involvement: When industry deliberately acquires obsolete items 
of its own manufacture, the recycle rate goes up. Power and telecommu­
nications ﬁrms have long collected scrap cable as they laid replacements. 
Can producers have constructed several facilities speciﬁcally for recycling 
UBCs (Woehlke, 2011) and now deliberately seek supplies of discarded cans 
(Miller, 2012). Other types of industries (car dealers, computer makers) are 
now required to take back their obsolete products (Muchová and Eder, 2010; 
Seebacher et al., 2006). (This is another reason why ­transportation sector 
recycle rates are high.) Lack of industry involvement in recovering obsolete 
items (e.g., white goods, the consumer durables in Table 3.2) results in a 
lower recycling rate.

Aluminum Recycling
Obsolete aluminum products that are not recycled are landﬁlled, lost, or dissipated. A 
dissipative use of aluminum is one that destroys its value as a potentially recyclable mate­
rial. The best example is the use of aluminum as a deoxidant in molten steel. Low-grade 
aluminum scrap added to the steel reacts with dissolved oxygen, resulting in deoxidized 
steel and aluminum oxide dissolved in the slag. The value of the steel is increased, but the 
value of the aluminum is destroyed. Other dissipative uses include the use of aluminum 
as an alloying agent in bronzes and zinc die-casting alloys and the use of aluminum as 
a reducing agent in the metallothermic production of refractory metals and ferroalloys. 
The fraction of aluminum used in dissipative purposes is a very small one, however.
SCRAP COLLECTION PRACTICE
NEW SCRAP
The traditional approach to collecting new scrap involves three parties—the dealer, 
the broker, and the processor (Aluminum Association, 1998).

Scrap Collection
The scrap dealer is the primary acquirer of metal scrap from industrial sources 
(Minter, 2010). This involves entering into a contract to purchase the scrap, physi­
cally taking it to a central collection facility (better known as a salvage yard, scrap 
yard, or junkyard), and then reselling it to a broker or processor. The contract can 
be arranged either by direct negotiation with the generator or it can be the result of 
competitive bidding. Several means of transport can be used, but the relatively small 
amounts of scrap generated by most sources means that trucking is the most com­
mon method.
The broker purchases scrap from several traders (Gianotti, 2012; Minter, 2007, 
2008b, 2010) and sells it in large lots to processors (Logue, 2009). By purchasing 
from several traders, the broker can act as a supermarket, offering customers differ­
ent grades of scrap at different prices. This allows the broker to sell to each processor 
the type of scrap that best suits the particular processor’s operation.
The processor converts scrap to a form that can be sold to a smelting or remelting 
facility (Minter, 2008a, 2011). Tasks that a processor may perform include
•	 Sorting the scrap to separate one metal from another or to separate different 
grades of crap from each other
•	 Shearing and/or shredding the scrap to liberate the aluminum from attach­
ments and reducing it to a size convenient for transportation and further 
processing
•	 Cleaning the scrap to remove dirt and other extraneous material
•	 Baling or briquetting the scrap to make subsequent transport easier
•	 Simple melting (e.g., sweat melting) to separate aluminum in the scrap from 
attached iron and converting the scrap to ingot for shipping
In practice, these three roles are often not distinct from one another. Dealers fre­
quently perform some processing and often sell their scrap directly to processors or 
smelters, bypassing the broker. Processors often negotiate directly with large scrap 
generators for scrap, eliminating the need for a dealer or a broker. This process of 
vertical integration has accelerated in the past 20 years.
A second change in new scrap collection and disposition involves the relation­
ship between generator and processor. Increasingly, large generators of scrap 
deal directly with processors (Douglas, 2012; Gianotti, 2012), signing long-term 
contracts to supply all their scrap to the processors. The processors then sort 
and remelt the scrap, returning the secondary metal to the original generator. 
This eliminates the trader and broker and in some cases the scrap yard as well. 
In several cases, the scrap processors have set up operations adjacent to or on 
the generator’s property, resulting in a dedicated recycling facility. This reduces 
costs and also improves the potential for closed-loop recycling, since the alloy 
content of the scrap sent to the dedicated recycling facility is known and can be 
easily segregated.
A third major change in scrap dealing and processing concerns the structure of 
the industry (Seabrook, 2008). Scrap dealers often began as small ­family-owned 
businesses, acquiring most of their scrap from the immediate region. However, bet­
ter communications (in particular the Internet) have made it possible in recent years 

34
Aluminum Recycling
for dealers and processors to seek out scrap supplies from a much broader region 
(Gianotti, 2012), resulting in increased competition and decreased proﬁt margins 
for smaller operations. In addition, small operations face increasing regulatory and 
environmental costs. Scrap yards located in urban areas are often targeted for clo­
sure under zoning laws (Gordon, 2012; Meyer, 2005), and the noise and dust that 
scrap processing generates are increasingly unacceptable. As a result, consolidation 
in the scrap trading and processing industry has been an ongoing trend. The family-
owned scrap businesses have been sold to or merged with large public corporations 
that operate on a national or even global scale. Such large corporations can effec­
tively ﬁll the roles of trader, broker, and processor by themselves.
OLD SCRAP
As mentioned earlier, the sources of old scrap can be divided into the main use sec­
tors of aluminum—transportation, buildings, packaging, wire and cable, and other.
Transportation: The collection of automotive scrap varies in different parts of the 
world. In general, end-of-life vehicles are obtained by one of four agents (Kumar and 
Sutherland, 2008; Woodyard, 1999):
•	 Automobile dealers, who obtain the old vehicles when customers trade 
them in for newer ones
•	 Repair shops, who receive the remains of vehicles that have been irrepara­
bly damaged by accident
•	 Highway authorities, who recover cars that have been abandoned by the 
roadside
•	 Salvage yard operators, who occasionally purchase vehicles directly from 
their owners (Paul, 2007)
The relative importance of these four in collecting depends on location, the 
perceived value of the car as scrap, and the regulatory environment. In rural envi­
ronments, salvage yards are not as convenient to car owners, and the distance of 
the salvage yards from markets for the car or its parts make it less valuable. As 
a result, abandonment of obsolete vehicles is a more attractive option to owners 
(Gesing, 2005), and highway departments play a larger role in collection. In urban 
environments, salvage yards are more accessible, and the parts of the car are more 
valuable. This results in fewer abandonments and more recovery of obsolete vehi­
cles by dealers and salvage yards.
The composition of automobiles has also impacted the pattern of obsolete auto­
mobile collection. As the amount of aluminum and magnesium in cars has increased 
(see Chapter 2), their value to the recycling industry has increased as well. (The 
inclusion of catalytic converters with small but valuable amounts of platinum-group 
metals has also encouraged collection.) This makes it more likely that obsolete auto­
mobiles will be returned for recycling through proper channels, rather than simply 
being abandoned. Approximately 95% of all passenger vehicles sold in the United 
States are now recovered for recycling (Kumar and Sutherland, 2008). The percent­
ages recovered in Europe and Japan are similar.

35
Scrap Collection
Once collected, most obsolete vehicles are ultimately sold or given to salvage 
yards. About 6,000 of these exist in the United States and 16,000 in Europe, usually 
run as small family operations (EAA, 2002; Kumar and Sutherland, 2008; Nakajima 
and Vanderburg, 2005). The salvage yards perform the ﬁrst steps in the recycling 
process. These include removing hazardous or environmentally difﬁcult materials 
from the car, including ﬂuids, glass, air bags, and mercury switches (Gesing, 2005; 
Paul, 2007). This is followed by dismantling those parts of the car that need to be 
recycled separately; these typically include the battery, copper radiators, catalytic 
converter, tires and wheels, and the gasoline tanks. About 15% of the aluminum in 
the vehicle is recovered during the dismantling phase. Salvage yards also remove 
parts that can be reused as replacement parts for other vehicles being repaired. These 
can include engines, transmissions, doors, bumpers, headlamps, fenders, and several 
other parts. This type of dismantling is done automatically in urban salvage yards 
and on a more haphazard basis in rural yards. Some salvage yards have begun to 
move upstream and have installed their own shredders (see Chapter 5), creating a 
more vertically integrated operation (Taylor, 2012).
As Table 3.2 shows (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004), recycling rates for buses 
and trucks are similar to those for personal vehicles. The lower rate for aerospace is 
misleading, since obsolete aircraft are more likely to be used as sources of parts than 
other vehicles, and as a result are not listed as recycled.
PACKAGInG
By far the most common source of old aluminum scrap is packaging, in particular 
the UBC. As Chapter 2 points out, the beverage can has risen to prominence only 
since the mid-1960s. As a result, for some time, concerted efforts to recover the 
cans were not considered important. Descriptions of aluminum recycling technol­
ogy from the 1960s and early 1970s treat UBCs as a minor source of metal and an 
undesirable one at that (Fine et al., 1973). However, this changed in the early 1970s, 
due to several reasons:
•	 Governments, noticing the increasing prevalence of aluminum cans in 
roadside litter, began enacting legislation banning or restricting the use 
of aluminum beverage containers. A common legislative initiative was 
to require payment of a deposit on each beverage container purchased 
and refundable when the empty container was returned (Gitlitz, 2003; 
Woehlke, 2011). As a response, the aluminum industry began develop­
ing infrastructure and technology speciﬁcally for collecting and recycling 
UBCs (Broughton, 1994).
•	 The energy crisis of the early 1970s had a signiﬁcant impact on the cost of 
producing primary aluminum. The greatly reduced energy requirement for 
recycling metal made this alternative look increasingly attractive.
•	 Since an increasing percentage of the aluminum industry’s output consisted 
of beverage cans, an increasing percentage of the available scrap consisted 
of this material too. If the industry was to obtain sufﬁcient supplies of scrap, 
recycling UBCs was necessary. As a result, the US aluminum industry has 

36
Aluminum Recycling
in recent years come to favor deposit legislation (Gardner, 2008). About 
40% of the UBC supply in the United States currently comes from cans 
returned for the deposit (Leahy, 2010).
As a result, several pathways have been developed for the collection of UBCs. The 
higher rate of aluminum can usage in North America has meant greater develop­
ment of collection infrastructure there. However, many of the same approaches 
are used elsewhere in the world as well. Collection methods include:
•	 Part-time and subsistence collectors, who gather aluminum cans from 
trash bins and other disposal areas (Miller, 2012).
•	 Buy-back centers sponsored by aluminum producers or recycling facilities 
(Green, 2006).
•	 Municipal recycling facilities (MRFs), which sort through garbage to 
recover UBCs and other recyclables (Schaffer, 2009a).
•	 Curbside separation and collection, which feeds a separated stream of 
recyclables into the MRF (Jenkins et al., 2003). Curbside serves nearly half 
of the US population.
Individual collectors have a variety of economic and social backgrounds and various 
motivations (Miller, 2012). Most collect cans for the income (Khullar, 2009; Minter, 
2010), some for the exercise, and some out of a sense of obligation toward the envi­
ronment. Part-time collecting is seasonal (Harler, 1999), with far more cans being 
collected during the warmer months.
Buy-back centers differ considerably in their degree of sophistication and size. 
The simplest are ﬁrst-tier facilities, which purchase cans and perform some rudimen­
tary sorting (Aluminum Association, 1998). Figure 3.2 illustrates a typical reverse 
vending machine, which returns a small amount of cash for cans fed into it. Machines 
like this are typically employed in states or countries where mandatory deposits are 
required. Because of this, they can often accept several types of UBC in addition to 
aluminum and can perform sorting and ﬂattening as well as collecting operations. 
Where mandatory deposits are not required, a ﬁrst-tier facility may consist of noth­
ing more than a drop-off trailer. Cans are left at the trailer and periodically retrieved 
by the site owner or manager.
When the number of cans being returned is sufﬁcient to justify it, a second-tier facil­
ity will be constructed to process cans collected from ﬁrst-tier facilities (Broughton, 
1994; Leahy, 2010). Second-tier facilities have a magnetic sorter to remove steel cans 
and other ferrous scrap from the aluminum cans. They also have a baler or ﬂattener to 
increase their bulk density and make the cans easier to ship. If the can collection oper­
ation is large enough, third-tier centers may be built (Aluminum Association, 1998). 
These are primarily processing rather than collection centers and perform shredding 
and cleaning of the collected cans in addition to magnetic separation.
Municipalities often encourage or require households and businesses to presort 
their trash before disposal. A common approach is the provision of a blue bag, 
into which recyclables are placed. Presorting can occur at three levels. The ﬁrst 
is ­multiple-stream recycling, in which recyclables are separated into several bins. 

37
Scrap Collection
The list of accepted recyclables varies, but always includes metal scrap. Cardboard, 
glass, paper, and plastics may also have their own separate blue bag. A more com­
mon scheme is dual-stream recycling, which provides one blue bag for containers 
(including aluminum cans) and a second for other recyclables. The third type of 
presort is single-stream recycling, in which all recyclables are placed into a single 
blue bag. The contents are then either sorted at curbside or at an MRF. Figure 3.3

Aluminum Recycling
illustrates a truck speciﬁcally designed for curbside sorting. The type of collection 
system used is determined by the need to increase participation; the trend is toward 
adoption of the single-stream system (Schaffer, 2009b). However, UBCs collected 
by single-stream recycling have higher impurity levels, requiring more downstream 
processing (Leahy, 2010). About 20% of the UBC supply in the United States is 
obtained through curbside programs.
Alternatively, the municipality may choose to collect its garbage in one container 
and then separate out the recyclables at an MRF. The reasons for recovering recy­
clables are twofold (Lave et al., 1999; Malloy, 1998):
•	 Recovering recyclables reduces the amount of garbage to be landﬁlled, reduc­
ing land usage and cost of acquiring and operating landﬁlls. In regions where 
available land is scarce (e.g., Japan), this is particularly important (Itou, 1995).
•	 The recovered recyclables have value. Many MRFs were constructed on 
the assumption that the proceeds from selling these recyclables (along with 
the savings from reduced landﬁll usage) would more than pay the cost of 
operating the MRF, becoming a net money earner for the operator. The alu­
minum cans in the garbage are particularly important in this regard, since 
they represent more than 20% of the total value of the recyclables, despite 
being less than 2% of the garbage (Aluminum Association, 1998; Das and 
Hughes, 2006).
In practice, MRFs have not always been as successful as originally envisioned (Reid, 
2002). Low prices for recyclables, and lower-than-anticipated landﬁlling costs, have 
made many MRFs in North America unproﬁtable, and some have been closed or 
curtailed. Elsewhere, conditions have been more favorable.
As a result of these collection efforts, UBC recycling rates have risen steadily 
wherever concerted collection efforts have been made. Figure 3.4 shows the current

percentages in various areas of the world. Collection rates are currently highest in 
Brazil and Japan, at well over 80%. The European rate masks considerable differ­
ences between countries. In northern Europe, mandatory deposit legislation has 
pushed recycling rates to levels above 70% (Gitlitz, 2003; Green, 2006; Woehlke, 
2011).
A note of concern can be found in the UBC recycling statistics for the United 
States shown in Figure 3.4. From a high of 67% in the early 1990s, the percentage 
of cans produced by the US aluminum industry that were processed for recycling 
fell to just over 50% in 2002 (Woehlke, 2011). Reasons for this include (Gitlitz, 
2003):
•	 The low price of aluminum. This is reﬂected in a lower price for aluminum 
scrap, which means reduced incentive for collectors to recover cans.
•	 Reduced levels of public interest—recycling has in some ways become 
yesterday’s news.
•	 The reduced cost of alternatives—with landﬁlling costs less than antici­
pated, and MRF operating costs greater than forecast, some municipalities 
no longer operate MRFs. The result is reduced UBC collection.
•	 The reduced mass of the can, which weighs one-third less than in 1970. 
This means that 33 cans are now required for a pound of metal instead of 
the 21 needed 30 years ago. This further reduces the incentive for collect­
ing the cans.
Some of these factors will have a long-term impact on can collection rates. As a 
result, increasing these rates may require legislative initiatives, such as the mandatory 
deposit legislation described earlier.
Aluminum foil is also used in food and beverage packaging, especially asep­
tic juice boxes. These boxes are popular packages for single-serving products. 
However, separating the thin layer of aluminum foil from the layers of paper and 
plastic comprising the package is a complex and expensive operation (Steeman, 
2013), difﬁcult to justify given the negligible amount of metal recovered. As a 
result, the recycle rate for this material is only 2% in the United States, somewhat 
higher elsewhere.
WIRE AnD CABLE
The fraction of recycled aluminum obtained from scrap wire and cable is likely no 
more than 5% (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004). Reasons for this include the relatively 
small amount of aluminum used in this application and the low recovery rate (see 
Table 3.2). Most aluminum-containing wires are collected from industrial sources: 
wire manufacturers, telephone companies, power and utility companies, and scrap 
dealers sorting building debris (Muchová and Eder, 2010).
The growing amount of electronic scrap generated by economically advanced 
societies points to another potential source of recycled aluminum. Printed circuit 

40
Aluminum Recycling
boards (PCB) consist of up to 7% metallic aluminum (Cui and Forssberg, 2006), 
and the overall aluminum content of waste electronic equipment is estimated at 4.7% 
(Muchová and Eder, 2010). Processes have been developed for recovering an alu­
minum concentrate as one of the products of circuit-board recycling. However, the 
relative value of the aluminum in a PCB is minimal compared with that of several 
other materials in the PCB, and as a result, actual aluminum recovery is small. The 
aluminum recovered from electronic materials is a very small fraction of the total 
old scrap collection (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004).
BUILDInG AnD ConsTRUCTIon
Practices for recovery of aluminum from demolished or renovated buildings vary 
considerably between continents. In North America, recovery rates are low, per­
haps about 15% (Bruggink and Martchek, 2004; Nisbet et al., 2003). The reason 
may be the nature of aluminum use in buildings, where it is used in assemblies 
that are difﬁcult to dismantle. Without a regulatory imperative, construction 
and demolition (C&D) debris is more often landﬁlled than processed in North 
America.
The situation is different in Europe, where aluminum recovery rates from C&D 
debris are well over 90% (Das et al., 2010; EAA, 2004). Nonresidential buildings 
average 2% aluminum, residential buildings less than 1%; however, this could 
increase over time as the use of aluminum in residential constructions grows. 
Contrary to North American experience, much of the aluminum used in construc­
tion in Europe seems to be hang-on parts such as siding and window frames, easily 
removed before demolition. A regulatory regime that encourages/requires materi­
als recovery from demolition and renovation projects also contributes to the high 
recovery rate.

4 Aluminum Recycling 
Economics
Although public support for recycling as a means of achieving social goals is wide­
spread, in the end recycling is not a religious activity. It is not carried out by people 
who are trying to save the planet. Recycling is carried out by people and organiza­
tions who are trying to earn a proﬁt. They face competition from other recyclers and 
from producers of primary material and do not control the price of their product. 
Their success depends on their ability to purchase raw materials at the lowest pos­
sible price and process them at the lowest possible cost. As a result, the economics 
of recycling is an important part of the secondary aluminum story and one that is 
critical to understanding the choices of processing strategy described in the next 
few chapters. The discussion will include both the cost of what recyclers use and the 
value of what they produce.
SCRAP GRADES
Figure 4.1 lists the grades and speciﬁcations of aluminum-containing scrap com­
piled by the US Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI, 2012). Different 
scrap grades have different values; a comparison of some of these grades will 
explain why.
The ﬁrst two grades in Figure 4.1, Tablet and Tabloid, are largely identical. 
However, Tabloid is new scrap, free of ink and paint. Tablet is old scrap and thus has 
ink and possibly paint on it. As a result, Tabloid will have greater value than Tablet. 
Several other types of scrap have separate grades for new and old material; the new 
material is always worth more.
Taboo is a common grade of aluminum scrap (Figure 4.2). Its speciﬁcation 
demands little or no alloyed copper. This increases the possibility of using it to pro­
duce wrought alloys when it is remelted. The tolerance problem was discussed in 
Chapter 2; the low-copper speciﬁcation is a result of this. Taboo also has limita­
tions on smaller-sized materials and the amount of oil and grease it can contain. 
Smaller scrap pieces are more likely to oxidize when put in a melting furnace, lower­
ing overall yields and generating more dross. Excessive grease will generate smoke 
and soot during the melting process, damaging the workplace environment. A plant 
that only purchases oil-free scrap can avoid having to purchase a decoating furnace 
(see Chapter 5). Limitations of these types are common through the descriptions in 
Figure 4.1.
There are six types of UBC scrap—Take, Talc, Talcred, Taldack, Taldon, and 
Taldork. Take is new scrap (Figure 4.3); the others are old. Talc and Talcred are loose 
scrap; the others have been densiﬁed by briquetting, bundling, or baling. Densiﬁed

material is easier to handle and is worth more. Talc does not specify magnetically sepa­
rated materials; the other old UBC grades do. Scrap grades often specify required pro­
cessing techniques, which produce improved purity and handling characteristics. Two 
of the newer scrap grades are EM-1 and EM-2, which specify the use of eddy current 
separation (see Chapter 5). Many scrap grades also specify a single product, such as 
UBCs, auto or truck wheels (Troma), pistons (Tarry), or automotive radiators (Tally).

Aluminum Recycling Economics
Two of the scrap grades in Figure 4.1 contain a mix of aluminum and other metals. 
These are Zeppelin and Zorba, which are products from the recycling of automobiles 
(see Chapter 6). Zorba is the nonferrous metallic fraction remaining when automo­
biles are shredded, passed under a magnetic separator to recover most of the iron and 
steel, and further processed to remove most of the nonmetallic material. Its composi­
tion varies, depending on the age and type of automobiles being shredded and the 
upgrading steps that it has gone through. Zeppelin is what remains of Zorba after it 
has been through a heavy media separator (see Chapter 5) to remove heavier metals 
such as copper, stainless steel, and zinc. It still contains some magnesium in addition 
to aluminum. When Zeppelin is further processed to remove magnesium, the result 
is Twitch. Much of the aluminum scrap traded worldwide is sold as these grades, 
particularly Twitch and Zorba.
Table 4.1 compares the ISRI scrap grade deﬁnitions with some of the deﬁni­
tions created by the German Verband Deutscher Metallhändler (VDM, 2011). 
The differences between the two sets of deﬁnitions are worth noting. The VDM 
grades include no speciﬁcations for UBC scrap, compared with six ISRI types. 
As mentioned previously, aluminum can usage is much greater in North America, 
resulting in much more scrap to process. On the other hand, VDM describes two 
grades of rolled scrap that have no direct ISRI equivalent. Rolled scrap includes 
plate, sheet, and foil (including UBCs). Because the North American scrap market 
is larger, ISRI can break this into several speciﬁc grades. Also included in Table 4.1 
for comparison are commercially traded scrap grades deﬁned by the industry pub­
lication Platts Metals Week (2012). These are the types of scrap common enough to 
have publicly listed prices.

Aluminum Recycling Economics
SCRAP PRICES
Several factors play a role in determining the value of different scrap grades. 
Some of these are characteristics of the scrap itself, and some are external factors. 
Characteristics of the scrap that impact the price include the following:
•	 Alloy purity: Scrap that consists entirely of one alloy is more valuable than 
a mixture of alloys. It can be remelted directly to produce that alloy, rather 
than requiring blending with other alloys or dilution with primary metal.
•	 Contaminants: These include oil, grease, dirt, plastic, paper, and other met­
als. These must be removed prior to remelting, which adds to the processing 
cost. New scrap grades are worth more than old scrap in part because they 
have lower levels of contaminants.
•	 Size: Big pieces of scrap produce better yield when melted than ﬁnely 
divided scrap such as turnings and wire chops. As a result, they are worth 
more. Baled or briquetted pieces of small scrap are worth more than loose 
pieces, for the same reason.
•	 Coatings and attachments: These have to be removed, which increases the 
cost of processing. As a result, bare scrap is usually worth more.
External factors include the following:
•	 The price of primary aluminum: When primary prices go up, scrap prices 
go up as well, and when prices go down, scrap becomes cheaper as well. 
However, the difference between primary and scrap prices is not constant. 
It can be impacted by government policy (see Chapter 11), the cost of alloy­
ing elements, the amount of primary produced in a given geographical 
area, and short-term supply constraints (Xiarchos, 2005). When primary 
aluminum is plentiful, the gap between primary and scrap prices grows; 
when primary aluminum plants shut down (as many have in Europe), scrap 
becomes more valuable (Blomberg and Söderholm, 2009). Primary alumi­
num is always a competitor of recycled metal, and if the gap between the 
price of primary and that of scrap becomes too small, it becomes impos­
sible to recycle metal at a proﬁt. Margins in Europe shrank to nearly zero 
in 2009, as the global recession created a large surplus of primary metal, 
driving down prices (Stulgis, 2012).
•	 The location of the scrap: Scrap that is located a long way from a remelting or 
reﬁning plant is more expensive to transport and thus less valuable. Table 4.2 
shows the price of a single grade of scrap (segregated low-copper clips, usu­
ally alloy 5052; ISRI grade Taboo) at various locations in North America on 
a given day (AMM, 2012). The highest values are on the West Coast, where 
buyers for Asian recyclers are most active. The lowest values are in eastern 
Canada, which has several nearby primary smelters. If located in another 
country, export taxes may also reduce the value of the scrap (Foster, 2005).
•	 The location of markets for recycled aluminum: The customers for recycled 
aluminum can be a long way from the place where it is produced. Most 

54
Aluminum Recycling
secondary aluminum producers locate their plants near their customers; 
those that cannot will receive less for their product, which means that they 
pay less for raw material.
•	 The cost of alloying elements: Aluminum alloys generally contain one or more 
of ﬁve common alloying elements: copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, 
and zinc. If the cost of any of these elements surges, scrap containing that ele­
ment can become a desirable alternative to pure copper, magnesium, etc., as a 
means of manufacturing that alloy. The costs of copper and silicon can make 
the price of scrap containing these elements higher than that of primary metal 
(Blomberg and Hellner, 2000; Gaustad et al., 2007; Rombach, 2006).
•	 Government policy (see Chapter 11): Taxes and restrictions on imports or 
exports of aluminum affect scrap prices, depending on the type of government 
action (Foster, 2005). One government policy that has had a particular impact 
has been moves to reduce the carbon footprint of manufacturing industries, 
that is, the amount of CO2 released to the environment during the production 
process. Because the production of recycled aluminum has such a smaller car­
bon footprint than that of primary metal (see Chapter 1), manufacturers wish­
ing to lower their own carbon impact can do so by using recycled metal (Das, 
2012; Novelis, 2012). This increases the demand for scrap and raises its price.
Table 4.3, obtained from Gesing et al. (2010), compares the relative value of prices 
for different grades of scrap with that of primary metal in spring 2010. The most 
valuable scrap grade is alloy 6061 truck wheels, which consist of a single alloy, 
have no coating, and so can be directly remelted to the same alloy. The second most

valuable grade is new alloy 6061 scrap, which has the advantage of being new, but 
may not have the consistent shape and size of old wheels. The lowest-valued scrap 
is mixed-alloy, high-grade turnings (Figure 4.4), which cannot be directly remelted, 
contain oil or lubricant, have a high surface/volume ratio, and may have more cop­
per than most aluminum alloys can tolerate. The sorting technologies described in 
the next chapter will not be useful for upgrading this material, either. As a result, its 
usefulness is limited. In general, the lowest-valued scrap grades tend to be old rather 
than new, mixed rather than single alloy, and coated or oily rather than bare. The 
exception is the 1-1-3 secondary ingot, produced by sweat melting (see Chapter 5). 
Its value is lowered by the iron content, which is incompatible with many aluminum 
alloy speciﬁcations (see Chapter 2).
Figure 4.5 shows another characteristic of aluminum scrap prices, volatility 
(Brath, 2012). The graph compares recent prices of scrap grades Taint and Tabor 
(bottom curve), secondary aluminum ingot (middle curve, described later in this 
chapter), and primary metal (top curve). These prices are graphed relative to the 
price of primary metal at the beginning of 2009. The up-and-down behavior of 
Taint/Tabor is a characteristic of all types of scrap and a challenge for recyclers 
trying to manage and if possible reduce costs (NADCA, 2008). The reason for the 
volatility is that the supply of scrap is not strongly affected by price. The amount of

Aluminum Recycling Economics
new scrap is determined by the activities of aluminum processors, not scrap con­
sumers (Blomberg and Hellner, 2000), and actions that would increase the supply 
of old scrap are often the result of government action, not economic. Blomberg and 
Söderholm (2009) estimate that the own-price elasticity of secondary aluminum sup­
ply is 0.21, meaning that a 10% increase in price is likely to increase the supply by 
only 2.1%. As a result, increases in demand for scrap cause a signiﬁcant increase in 
price. Another consequence of the low own-price elasticity is that increasing the sup­
ply of aluminum scrap is less likely to be accomplished by providing price incentives 
than by improving recycling technology (Xiarchos, 2005).
Prices for aluminum scrap are published by numerous sources. Many provide 
spot prices, which are the prices paid for scrap for immediate (2-day) delivery. The 
AMM (American Metal Market) prices shown in Table 4.2 are an example of these 
(AMM, 2012); numerous web-based services have also appeared in the past several 
years (Logue, 2012a). The prices quoted by these sources are a combination of auc­
tion results, conversations with scrap brokers and buyers, and surveys of partici­
pants. Spot prices for scrap show the greatest volatility. Still other listings are based 
on an average of previous spot prices; the industry publication Platts Metals Week 
(now Platts Metals Daily; see Table 4.1) uses the average for a prior month for a given 
scrap grade to set the value for the next month (NADCA, 2008).
The London Metals Exchange (LME) does not publish scrap prices, but it does report 
the price of alloy A380.1, a casting alloy produced from scrap. The formula used by the 
LME uses the average price of this alloy from two months before to set the price for the 
current month (NADCA, 2008). This matters because contracts for the purchase and 
sale of scrap often use the LME price for A380.1 as a reference (Anton, 2006).
SCRAP PURCHASING
A recycler can essentially purchase scrap one of two ways:
	
1.	On the spot market, either through auction or through a broker (see Chapter 3)
	
2.	By contract with a scrap generator or broker, using a price or price formula 
determined by negotiation
A recycler who obtains scrap via the ﬁrst method is engaging in commodity risk, 
the risk that aluminum prices will fall during the remelting or reﬁning process. This 
reduces or eliminates the proﬁt margin obtained by recycling the metal. However, 
an increase in aluminum alloy prices will increase the margin, making the operation 
more proﬁtable. A second risk of spot market purchases (and perhaps more serious) 
is that of quantity; some scrap grades may not be widely available, especially at cer­
tain times of the year. As a result, most recyclers avoid this approach.
Recyclers who buy scrap by contract reduce their quantity risk. However, they can 
still assume a commodity risk, if the negotiated purchase is a function of a spot price 
(for aluminum scrap or aluminum). A particular concern is that of buying scrap at 
a price based on one index and selling castings or billet at a price based on another 
(NADCA, 2008). Recyclers often deal with this concern by hedging their scrap pur­
chases. Hedging describes several techniques used to lock scrap prices into place, 

58
Aluminum Recycling
minimizing the risk of sudden changes in price that could result in losses to the recycler. 
It is not without risks of its own (Logue, 2012b). There are several hedging ­techniques 
available; the most signiﬁcant for aluminum recyclers will be discussed here.
Physical hedging is the practice of buying large quantities of scrap at a low price 
and storing it on site (Logue, 2012b). If the recycled product generated from the scrap 
can be sold the same day, the proﬁts can be locked in. If not, the recycler is gambling 
that the price of secondary aluminum will be high enough when the metal is sold to 
generate a proﬁt. Physical hedging requires sufﬁcient understanding of the market to 
know when a scrap price is low enough to justify buying. It also requires substantial 
storage space for the purchased scrap, which is costly and ties capital up in inventory. 
As a result, its use is limited to larger recyclers.
If a recycler does not have the storage space for large quantities of scrap or the 
desired quantities of a particular grade of scrap are not available at one time, deriva­
tives hedging can be used to reduce risk. Derivatives hedging is done by purchasing 
scrap through a futures contract, a commitment by the recycler to purchase a speci­
ﬁed quantity of scrap at a set time in the future (LME, 2012; NADCA, 2008). The 
price of the scrap is either a set value (fixed price contracting) or more likely a func­
tion of the market price of a more stable commodity (formula pricing). Although a 
futures contract guarantees physical delivery of the contracted amount of the scrap 
at the speciﬁed time, in practice this rarely happens. The recycler usually ﬁnds a 
cheaper source of the desired scrap instead. When this happens, the futures contract 
is sold at the original metal price. This limits the proﬁts made by the recycler from 
the less expensive scrap, but the guaranteed price also minimizes losses should the 
purchase of more expensive scrap be required instead.
Finding a basis for calculating the purchase price of aluminum scrap in a futures con­
tract has been a challenge. As previously mentioned, the price of primary metal does not 
always correspond to the price of scrap (Anton, 2006), and published scrap prices are 
too volatile to be used for this purpose. The prices of secondary alloys (alloys produced 
from scrap) should be more relevant for this purpose. However, a single secondary alloy 
can have several compositions, as will be seen later in this chapter, and so prices pub­
lished for that alloy in different sources may not be for the same material. As a result, 
the type of contract available for derivatives hedging differs from continent to continent.
In the early 1990s, the LME attempted to solve this problem by introducing futures 
contracts based on the price of alloy A380.1 (Kiser, 2002). Aluminum alloy contracts 
were offered for Europe, North America, and Japan. The contracts for Europe were 
initially successful, but the A380.1 used in North America is different from that used 
in Europe (Carey, 2013), and the price is different as well. As a result, American 
secondary aluminum producers and consumers (in particular automakers) sought 
a better hedging tool. This resulted in the introduction by the LME of the North 
American Special Aluminum Alloy Contract (NASAAC) in 2002 (Anton, 2006; 
Stundza, 2002). NASAAC applied only to a North American composition of A380.1, 
to be supplied from US warehouses. This made it compatible with US accounting 
rules and thus a more usable tool.
The LME contracts have been controversial in both Europe and North America. 
Scrap dealers in particular have been opposed to it (Carey, 2013), noting that the dif­
ference between the price of LME A380.1 and that from other sources (in particular 

59
Aluminum Recycling Economics
Platts) is increasingly large and volatile (McBeth, 2012). Futures contracts imply the 
ability to obtain metal from LME-approved warehouses at the speciﬁed time, but 
waiting periods of several months have become increasingly common (Burns, 2012). 
As a result, secondary aluminum customers have been forced to make adjustments 
to NASAAC prices, and producers of secondary aluminum have begun to look for 
other hedging mechanisms instead (McBeth and Baltic, 2012).
COST OF PROCESSING
The cost of processing scrap is difﬁcult to state precisely, because there is no typical 
processing ﬂowsheet. Some recyclers start with low-cost old scrap and produce sec­
ondary alloys for casting applications; others start with good-quality new scrap and 
remelt directly to the same alloy. Analysis of a unit operation as simple as remelting 
scrap depends on the fuel value (if any) of coatings on the scrap, the melt loss that 
occurs during the process, and the ﬁnal temperature (casting alloys have a lower 
melting point than wrought alloys). However, some analyses have been produced.
For most producers of recycled aluminum, the cost of scrap represents about 80%–
85% of total costs (Kozhanov et al., 2010; Luo, 2009). As a result, the most effective 
means of reducing costs is minimizing the cost of scrap. Hedging is one possibility; 
ﬁnding ways to replace new scrap with old is another. The development of technology 
to more effectively sort old scrap (see next chapter) and to remove alloying elements 
from molten aluminum (see Chapter 12) is important to the industry for this reason.
Figure 4.6 illustrates the breakdown by Gluns and Schemberg (2005) of process­
ing costs for a secondary aluminum smelter burning natural gas in air. The largest 
components are the cost of disposing process wastes and labor costs; as a result, 
reducing these has the highest priority. Process wastes include salt slag and dross, 
and ways to reduce the amount of each to be disposed of are described in Chapter 13. 
Unfortunately, the generation of these wastes increases when lower-grade scrap is 
melted, which puts this cost-reduction effort at cross-purposes with that of reducing

scrap costs. The reduction of labor costs requires the use of greater automation in 
furnace operations, described in Chapter 9. This too is more difﬁcult to accomplish 
when lower-grade scrap is used. Minimizing the use of salt would reduce ﬂux as well 
as disposal costs. The recent surge in natural gas production has reduced fuel costs; 
better furnace design (see Chapters 7 and 8) will reduce it further.
RECYCLING PRODUCTS AND THEIR PRICE
There are two primary types of aluminum recycling facility. The ﬁrst is a remelter. 
Remelters engage in direct recycling, producing a speciﬁc alloy from scrap primarily 
consisting of that alloy. As discussed in Chapter 11, some recycling facilities are now 
located adjacent to manufacturing facilities and effectively engage in toll processing 
of their scrap. In such cases, the price of the alloy being produced is unimportant; 
the recycler is essentially charging a fee for processing the material and returning it 
in usable form to the original source of the scrap (AlFed, 2011). In other places, the 
supply of scrap consisting of one alloy is sufﬁcient in some markets to justify seg­
regating it and remelting it separately. The scrap grades listed in Figure 4.1 include 
several that consist of just one alloy. If the cost of remelting and casting is less than 
the price difference between that grade of scrap and the market value of that alloy, 
the recycler can make a proﬁt.
Secondary smelters, sometimes known as refiners, operate differently. They pro­
duce alloys for sale to the aluminum industry at large, from a variety of scrap sources 
that can change depending on the price and availability of a given type of scrap. The 
standards that their products meet are common to all customers, and prices are pub­
licly listed. A description of these products will describe what inﬂuences their prices 
and why they are more commonly produced than other possible alloys.
Table 4.4 lists the chemical composition of seven compositions of popular alu­
minum casting alloy “380.” This alloy features high copper and silicon levels and 
optionally up to 3.0% zinc. The ﬁrst distinction among the seven types is the product 
type. Alloys with “0.0” at the end (380.0, A380.0, and B380.0) are alloys that have 
been die cast; castings are often sold by the pound or kilogram, with a markup for 
processing costs. The “0.0” alloys have the highest permissible levels for impuri­
ties such as iron, nickel, and tin. The “0.1” and “0.2” alloys are ingots cast by the 
smelter; sows also fall under this category. Typically, “0.1” alloys are those primar­
ily produced from scrap by secondary smelters, and “0.2” alloys are produced using 
primary metal. Because primary metal has fewer impurities, the acceptable limits 
for iron, nickel, and tin are lower in “0.2” alloys. The impurity limits in A380.2 are 
especially noteworthy; they include speciﬁc limits of 0.05% on nonlisted individual 
impurity elements, as well as an overall limit of 0.15%. As the number of alloying 
elements used in the aluminum industry grows, keeping unusual impurities out of 
scrap becomes an increasing challenge (Carey, 2013). A380.2 and B380.2 also have 
higher silicon levels than their “0.1” counterparts; lower allowable levels of iron and 
nickel ensure that this much silicon can be added without the risk of forming an 
intermetallic precipitate. The difference between A380.1 and the other alloys is the 
higher level of zinc (die casters producing 380.0 from 380.2 ingot have to add the 
zinc themselves). The higher level of zinc gives secondary smelters greater choice

of scrap grades that they can use in their mix, making A380.1 more recycle friendly 
than B380.1 (Das et al., 2008). Table 4.4 also includes the composition of the special 
North American grades of A380.1 speciﬁed for NASAAC by LME. Similar compo­
sition families exist for other common grades of secondary alloy as well, each with 
its own price.
Recycled aluminum can be delivered to customers as molten metal (see Chapter 8) 
or as a solid product. The three most common solid forms are ingot, sow, and T-bar 
(Grandﬁeld, 2009). Ingots range in size up to 23 kg (50 lb), sows are typically 500–
1000 kg (Figure 4.7), and T-bars tend to be less than 25 kg. Customers tend to prefer 
ingot, in part for safety reasons (Carey, 2013); sows and T-bars can trap water dur­
ing solidiﬁcation, creating an explosion hazard during remelting (see Chapter 14). 
Grandﬁeld (2009) discusses this in greater detail.
Table 4.5, also derived from Gesing et al. (2010), lists the price of several 
common secondary alloys as a percentage of the price of primary aluminum in 
spring 2010. Most of the prices are higher than that of primary metal, largely due 
to the high percentage of expensive alloying agents such as copper and silicon. 
Comparing the price of 356.1 (produced from scrap) and 356.2 (produced from 
primary) shows the value to customers of the lower impurity content in “0.2” type 
alloys. Also included are the prices of two wrought alloys produced by remelters, 
6061 and 6063. Alloy 6061 has higher alloy content; 6063 has tighter impurity 
restrictions. The price ­difference between “A380.1” and “LME 380” is one of the 
reasons why the NASAAC is poorly regarded by some recyclers (Carey, 2013; 
McBeth, 2012).
Figure 4.8, from the presentation by Borner (2012), illustrates the spread during 
2010–2011 between the US price of A380.1 reported by Platts and the market price 
of auto shreds (i.e., ISRI grade Twitch). Two curves are presented. The top curve 
shows the spread between the two listed prices, and the bottom shows the spread 
when the effect of melt loss during smelting is taken into account. The decline at the

end of 2011 reﬂects a decline in the price of primary aluminum. Subtracting the cost 
of processing from this spread determines the proﬁtability of the smelter. Figure 4.9 
shows the result when the NASAAC price is used instead. The spread declined to 
nearly zero at the end of 2011, before subtracting the processing cost. The volatility in 
these curves explains why a hedging device is needed; the spread shown in Figure 4.9

5 Beneficiation Technology
After mining, the next step in traditional metal extraction is minerals processing, 
in which the valuable minerals are liberated from the gangue material in the ore. 
Following this, the minerals are sorted into a separate stream, using differences 
between their physical properties and those of the gangue. In some cases, chemical 
or thermal processes may be used to remove impurities from the concentrated min­
erals. As a ﬁnal step, the concentrated minerals may be agglomerated to make them 
easier to ship and easier to handle in subsequent smelting processes.
In Chapter 3, the mining (collecting) of scrap aluminum was described. Over 
the next two chapters, the equivalent mineral processing (beneficiation or upgrad­
ing) of this ore will be introduced. In this chapter, the techniques and equipment 
used to separate scrap aluminum from contaminants will be introduced. This will 
be followed by a description in Chapter 6 of how this technology is put into practice. 
As with the processing of traditional minerals, the beneﬁciation of scrap can be 
divided into four types of unit process. These include comminution, sorting, thermal 
­processing, and agglomeration.
COMMINUTION (NIJKERK AND DALMIJN, 1998)
Aluminum scrap comes in a wide variety of size and conditions. Pieces can be as small 
as the aluminum wires used in electronic equipment or as large as a jet airliner. Scrap 
is sometimes liberated, free of any attached pieces of other materials. However, it is 
often found bolted, welded, or otherwise attached to other parts. To be remelted, the 
scrap will have to be separated from these other materials. The dismantling of auto­
mobiles and other large assemblies described in Chapter 3 accomplishes this to some 
degree. However, in many cases, the value of the scrap recovered by dismantling is 
insufﬁcient to justify the expense of this labor-intensive process.
Many sorting processes require scrap pieces of a given size to be effective. 
In addition, furnaces have maximum sizes of scrap that can be successfully fed. 
Consistent particle size is also essential to the proper functioning of some sorting 
devices. Some scrap already has the proper size for automated sorting, but most of 
it does not. Comminution is the process by which oversize material is reduced to the 
proper size for further processing. The comminution of naturally occurring miner­
als is usually done by crushing it into smaller rocks. However, metal scrap cannot 
be turned into smaller separate pieces in this fashion. Instead, it must be torn apart. 
Numerous devices have been invented for tearing apart metal scrap. Here, they will 
be separated into three categories—shears, impact shredders, and rotary shredders.
Most of the shears in operation are either alligator or guillotine shears. Figure 5.1 
shows a typical alligator shear (Fowler, 2003), so named because the hinged cut­
ting motion is similar to that of an alligator. Only the top portion of the jaw moves

during operation. The cutting blade is made of hardened tool steel and can be 
resharpened when it gets dull. Sizes and power ratings vary, according to the size and 
type of material to be cut. Most alligator shears use electric power, although gasoline 
and diesel engines are available.
Alligator shears have been available since the early 1900s. Major changes in the 
basic design include the following:
•	 The use of hydraulic rather than mechanical ﬂywheel drives. Hydraulic 
drives allow the machine to be stopped immediately to prevent damage to 
the machine or injury to the operator, a feature not available in ﬂywheel-
driven shears.
•	 The addition of a hold-down clamp to keep scrap pieces still while being 
cut.
•	 The addition of guards around the machine to prevent injury to the opera­
tors. Alligator shears were notorious safety hazards before the introduction 
of these guards, which are now mandatory in most countries.
One of the advantages of the alligator shear is its versatility (A-Ward, 2005). This is 
particularly important in the processing of aluminum scrap, which takes a variety of 
forms. Figure 5.2 shows a crane-mounted shear used for recovering scrap that cannot 
be brought to a processing plant. Crane-mounted shears remove aluminum and other 
scrap metals from aircrafts, ships, rail cars, and other large objects. Another special 
type of alligator shear is the nibbling or metal cleaning shear used for detaching 
small metal attachments such as bolts or collars. Metal-cleaning shears are espe­
cially popular for separating steel parts from cable scrap (American Recycler, 2003).

Beneficiation Technology
Figure 5.3 shows a guillotine shear, which operates the same way as the well-
known device used for executing persons (Pretz and Julius, 2011). Scrap is placed 
underneath a cutting blade, which drops down onto the piece with the help of verti­
cal guide rails. Since scrap is more difﬁcult to chop than human heads, hydraulic 
power is used to accelerate the blade rather than relying on gravity alone. Guillotine 
shears are more productive than alligator shears and can be built with higher power 
ratings. As a result, they have replaced alligator shears in many applications, par­
ticularly for cutting steel scrap. However, they are less important in the processing 
of scrap aluminum. A recent innovation is a swing beam shear (Marshall, 2012), 
which pivots the blade about a ﬁxed point. This allows it to cut thinner material than 
a guillotine shear.

Describing all the types of shredder would ﬁll a book by itself. The discussion 
provided here summarizes the more important types. For a more complete descrip­
tion, the reader is encouraged to see other sources, in particular Nijkerk and Dalmijn 
(1998).
Figure 5.4 shows a cutaway view of an older model of hammer mill, the most 
popular type of impact shredder. These were ﬁrst used for shredding automobiles in 
the late 1950s (Manouchehri, 2007) and have since become the predominant means 
for processing auto hulks. They are also used for processing white goods such as 
refrigerators and ovens and have been adapted to process smaller items as well. The 
model shown here is used for shredding auto hulks but is similar in function to those 
used for other purposes.
The description of a hammer mill starts with the rotor assembly (Manouchehri, 
2007). The rotor is several feet long and has a series of spider assemblies attached to 
it. The assemblies have wear-resistant steel caps; attached to each cap is a hammer 
made of ductile iron or manganese steel. The hammers weigh 50–300 kg depending

Beneficiation Technology
on the capacity of the hammer mill and are allowed to swing freely as the rotor turns. 
The rotor turns at 500–600 rpm, requiring up to 7000 hp. Faster rotation speed uses 
more energy but reduces the time required to reduce input scrap to a given size. As a 
result, for a set product size, the speciﬁc energy consumption of shredding decreases 
with increasing rotor speed. Horizontal rotor arrangements such as that shown here 
are preferred for large-scale shredding of metallic scrap over vertical hammer mills. 
While AC motors are the predominant choice for larger hammer mills, DC motors 
have become more popular for small- and medium-size units.
Figure 5.5 shows a second view of a hammer mill, in cross section. Scrap fed to 
a hammer mill is ﬁrst passed through a ﬂattener or compressor (part 2 in the ﬁgure). 
This device (1) increases the density of the feed, which improves the operation of 
the shredder (Manouchehri, 2007), and (2) controls the rate at which the scrap is 
fed to the machine, ensuring steady-state operation. When the scrap enters the main 
chamber, a breaker bar absorbs the shock. The swinging hammers then engage the 
scrap, pounding it repeatedly against the anvil or cutter bar (part 3). (Remember the 
mass of the hammers and the rotor speed.) This action tears the scrap apart, turning 
it into ﬁst-size chunks that go through the holes in the manganese steel grate (part 4).
Although shredders are extremely powerful machines, occasionally a scrap piece 
will come through that is too thick or massive to be shredded. The reject door (part 9 
in Figure 5.5) allows these pieces to be removed from the shredder before they can 
damage the machine. Other oversize pieces simply go around and are eventually 
caught against a bafﬂe plate (part 7). These have a similar function as the anvil and 
give the hammers another chance to ﬁnish the job. Manouchehri (2007) suggests that 
most of the size reduction in hammer mills actually occurs at this location. A second 
grate is provided at the top (part 5) to allow shredded material and ﬂuff a second 
chance to leave the shredding chamber. This reduces the load of returned material 
and improves shredder capacity.

All shredders generate dust and ﬁne particles during operation. These would be 
an environmental and workplace hygiene hazard if released. Furthermore, shredder 
operation generates heat. If the dust contains organic vapors from vaporizing grease 
or oil in the scrap, this can result in a signiﬁcant explosion hazard. As a result, all 
dry shredders have a dust collection system (part 10 in Figure 5.5), operating under 
negative pressure to draw the dust off (Gesing, 2006).
One option for eliminating the dust from shredding operations is to spray water into 
the shredder (Gesing, 2006; Manouchehri, 2007). Moist shredding adds the water as a 
mist and minimizes the amount added; wet shredding ﬂoods the shredder and generates a 
slurry containing the shredded material. This eliminates the need for dust collection and 
minimizes the risk of explosion. However, there are disadvantages to moist or wet shred­
ding as well. The ﬁrst is that it introduces the need for a water-treatment system to recycle 
the runoff; any soluble material in the feed (e.g., road salt) is a potential water pollution 
problem. A second is the need to recover what would have been the dust somewhere else. 
The potential for the dust to contaminate the metal streams recovered from the shredder is 
a product quality concern. The loss of metal ﬁnes in the runoff can also become an issue. 
The heat generated by shredding turns added water into steam, which makes monitoring 
difﬁcult; some moist or wet shredders use an infrared camera to deal with this (Fowler, 
2007a). As a result, moist shredding has become more popular than wet shredding. The 
amount of water needed can be reduced by adding foam (Midwest, 2012).
Figure 5.6 shows the cross section of an impact crusher, also used to shred large 
and heavy scrap. The impact crusher is similar to a hammer mill but uses hammers 
ﬁxed to the spider assembly rather than being allowed to swing freely. A series of 
breaking surfaces replaces the single anvil in the hammer mill. The impact crusher 
is used more frequently to crush minerals than metallic scrap. For scrap process­
ing, it is occasionally used to “recrush” metal than has been processed in a hammer

mill (Lindemann, 2009). This reduces the required degree of reduction in the ham­
mer mill and increases productivity.
Hammer mills were designed to shred large pieces of ferrous scrap, such as those 
in automobiles. As a result, they use tremendous amounts of energy, generate large 
quantities of ﬁnes from more easily shredded materials, and are very noisy. For 
shredding lighter and weaker materials, more cost-effective machines are available. 
Figure 5.7 shows a double-rotor rotary shredder (also known as a rotary shear). 
These shredders are more widely used for processing paper and plastic (Fowler, 
2011) but process light metal scrap as well, particularly foil and UBCs. They are 
also the primary device used for wire chopping to recover metal from cable scrap 
(Sullivan, 1985). As with hammer mills, many designs are available.
The rotors in a rotary shredder turn in opposite directions. Each has several knife 
blades attached, such as those in Figure 5.8. Each knife blade includes one or more

hooks. The hooks grab pieces of scrap and pull them down into the space between 
the rotors, where the knives slice them into smaller shreds. The shreds fall either 
directly onto a conveyor that takes them away or onto a screen that makes the return 
of oversized pieces to the shredder possible. The size of the shreds is determined 
by the shredder design; increasing the number of rotors decreases the size, as does 
reducing the rotor diameter. Rotary shredders use electric or hydraulic drive and can 
be powered directly or indirectly. Electric-drive machines generate less heat and are 
more efﬁcient (Fowler, 2011); hydraulic-drive shredders are more portable and may 
be less affected by high-load conditions or unshreddable material.
Rotary shredders substitute high torque and low speed (5–50 rpm) for the low 
torque and high speed of hammer mills. As a result, the power use of double-rotor 
shredders such as that shown in Figure 5.7 is similar to that of hammer mills. 
However, the lower speed produces a more uniform product, reduces the generation 
of dust and ﬁnes, and makes shredding much less noisy. The shreds generated by 
these devices tend to be less wadded up than those coming from a hammer mill; this 
makes decoating and paint removal more effective. Rotary shredders also generate 
less dust and vapor, reducing the risk of explosion (Graveman, 2009). One approach 
to reducing the high power cost is the use of a single-rotor shredder, in which the 
metal is held against a stationary plate while being shredded. However, the need 
for higher capacities has encouraged the use of two- and even four-rotor shredders 
(Fowler, 2011). This is particularly the case if the rotary shredder is being used to 
process white goods (see Chapter 3). Table 5.1, taken from the assessment by Evans 
and Guest (2000), compares the use of different shredding devices for UBCs.

SORTING (NIJKERK AND DALMIJN, 1998)
Hand sorting: As the name suggests, this is the process of going through a feed 
stream and removing desirable items by hand, putting them into separate bins for 
later processing. It was the ﬁrst method ever used for sorting garbage or scrap and 
continues to be popular.
The most widespread use of hand sorting is the initial processing of house­
hold waste. The collection of aluminum scrap from this source was described in 
Chapter 3. The blue bag used to separate recyclables from other garbage is a form of 
hand sorting. Many cities with MRFs perform their own hand sorting once garbage 
reaches the main processing facility (Kessler Consulting, Inc., 2009). The material 
removed from the garbage varies among facilities but almost always includes metal 
scrap, in particular copper, brass, and aluminum.
Another common location for hand sorting is the product streams from shred­
ders (Gesing, 2006; Mutz et al., 2003; Wens et al., 2010). The magnetic fraction can 
contain items such as motors and other items with attached contaminants. Removing 
these items helps reduce impurity levels in the ferrous scrap. The nonmagnetic frac­
tion is also frequently hand sorted, even if other sorting devices are used. This helps 
remove items of similar density but different composition. An example of this is the 
pieces of copper wire in aluminum scrap. The plastic or rubber coating of these wires 
gives them a density similar to that of aluminum, and the conductivity of the cop­
per makes it responsive to eddy current separation. Hand sorting to remove the wire 
accomplishes a separation not readily achievable by machine. Separating aluminum 
from copper wire in cable scrap is also typically a hand sorting process (Taylor, 2010).
Hand sorting is obviously labor intensive, in addition to being unpleasant and pos­
sibly unhealthy work. However, in parts of the world where labor costs are low, it is 
still a preferred method for scrap sorting. In fact, much of the nonferrous scrap gen­
erated by automotive shredding in North America and Europe is sent to Asia (Gesing 
et al., 2010; Minter, 2006), where hand sorting is less expensive than the automatic 
processes used in more developed nations. It is still a preferred method for garbage 
sorting as well (Khullar, 2009; Minter, 2010; Wilson et al., 2009).
Hand sorters use several visual recognition tools to distinguish desirable items in 
a feed stream (Gesing et al., 2006; Mutz et al., 2003). Color is the most important, 
allowing separation of metallic items from nonmetallic and allowing the removal of 
copper, brass, and lead from other metals. Skilled hand sorters can distinguish cast 
from wrought aluminum and aluminum from magnesium. Shape is also important 
in the sorting of garbage, since tableware is usually made of stainless steel, cans are 
made of aluminum or steel, plastic milk cartons are produced from high-density 
polyethylene, etc. A signiﬁcant challenge in aluminum recycling is the recovery of 
aluminum from composite aseptic packaging such as juice boxes. The juice boxes 
consist mostly of paper and plastic and will not be separated from other garbage by 
methods that depend on density difference or metallic properties. Visual recognition 
and removal can create a supply of this type of packaging large enough for a separate 
treatment process.
Hand sorting has limitations. Metal parts that are painted or plated with another 
metal can be misidentiﬁed. Some parts are produced using a choice of alloys, so 

76
Aluminum Recycling
shape recognition may not be sufﬁcient to segregate by type of metal. Finally, if 
labor costs are too high (Minter, 2011; Wens et al., 2010), the value of recovered 
materials may not justify the cost of sorting (particularly in MRF operations). As a 
result, efforts are being made to develop sorting tools that can replace hand sorting 
(Gesing et al., 2010). These will be described later.
Air classification: Metal scrap often contains high levels of low-density impuri­
ties. Municipal waste consists mostly of waste paper and plastic; the shredder ﬂuff 
from auto shredding contains small amounts of metal and large amounts of organic 
material from the carpets, dashboard, etc. A more recent source of scrap metal is 
electronic scrap (Toto, 2012), in particular the circuit boards. These consist mostly 
of plastic, which must be separated from the metal.
When the fraction of low-density material in the raw material is much higher than 
that of the metal to be recovered, air classiﬁcation devices become useful. These 
devices use an upward ﬂow of air to lift the paper and plastic away from the metal, 
separating the two. A large number of air classiﬁers have been developed; the reader 
is encouraged to see Nijkerk and Dalmijn (1998) for a complete listing. Two of the 
more important will be described here.
Figure 5.9 illustrates a zigzag or Z-box vertical air classiﬁer, widely used for pro­
cessing municipal solid waste. Air blown in through the bottom pushes low-density 
material (the Light Fraction) up and out, while allowing higher-density metal scrap 
(the Heavy Fraction) to fall to the bottom. The zigzag design improves efﬁciency

by agitating the contents. This keeps paper and metal pieces from sticking together 
or blocking each other’s path. Zigzag classiﬁers have also been applied for metal 
recovery from auto shredder ﬂuff (Phillips, 1996).
Figure 5.10 depicts an air table, widely used for metal recovery from shredded 
wire and cable (Phillips, 1996; Sullivan, 1985). This material has a small particle 
size and thus needs to be processed more gently than the large pieces fed to vertical 
air classiﬁers. Unseparated material fed in the box at the top left is gently shaken 
as it moves along the sloping table toward the discharge at the far end. At the same 
time, air blown through small holes in the table lifts the lighter plastic and rubber in 
the feed, moving it toward the near side of the table. Metal scrap is less affected by 
the air and continues toward the far end. Collecting separate fractions from opposite 
sides of the discharge end produces two concentrates. A third middlings fraction, 
with too much plastic and metal to use as either fraction, is recycled to the feed box 
for another try. Shredded electronic scrap is also separated using air tables (Cui, 
2005), as are ﬁnes from auto shredding operations (Eriez, 2012).
Magnetic separation: This is one of the simplest steps in the upgrading of alu­
minum scrap. Its purpose is to remove the iron and steel and nickel-based alloys 
if any are present. A variety of separators are available for performing this task 
(Manouchehri, 2007); the most common are drum magnets and overhead belt (sus­
pension) magnets (Figure 5.11). A drum magnet features a stationary magnet around 
which a drum rotates. Nonmagnetic material falls off the drum and is collected on 
a conveyor running below; magnetic material sticks to the drum and continues to 
do so until the drum rotates past the ﬁeld generated by the magnet. Then it too falls 
off and is removed by a separate conveyor. In a belt magnet, the drum is replaced 
by a conveyor belt running over the stationary magnet (Steinert, 2003b). Magnetic 
particles are pulled off a conveyor running below this assembly by the magnetic ﬁeld 
and stick to the upper belt. When this belt moves away from the magnetic ﬁeld, the 
magnetic particles drop off and are collected on a separate conveyor. Nonmagnetic 
particles are unaffected by the magnet and remain on their original conveyor belt.

Aluminum Recycling
Because the belts are subject to wear, drum magnets are favored when the relative 
amount of ferrous material to remove is heavy (Steinert, 2003a).
Figure 5.12 shows a typical strategy for magnetic separation of auto shred (Milton, 
2010; Ness, 1984). In this case, the magnetic fraction from a drum separator drops 
onto a conveyor belt that carries it under a second drum separator (Otaki, 2009). 
The purpose of this is to clean the magnetic material of any paper or other nonmag­
netic material that might have inadvertently stuck to it when it was pulled onto the 
ﬁrst drum. In plants trying to remove the ferrous impurity from the nonferrous frac­
tion (such as UBC recyclers), it is the nonferrous fraction instead that is passed under

unacceptable, so aluminum scrap may wind up being passed under magnetic separa­
tors both during upgrading and before charging to a furnace for remelting.
Eddy current sorting: Figure 5.13 illustrates a conductive particle (such as a piece 
of scrap) entering the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a permanent magnet. The mag­
netic ﬁeld causes an electric current to ﬂow in the conductive particle (Milton, 2010). 
This current is known as an eddy current. The magnitude of the current is deter­
mined by the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, the electrical conductivity of the par­
ticle, and by the size and shape of the particle. The eddy current in turn generates 
a secondary magnetic ﬁeld around the particle, aligned with the primary magnetic 
ﬁeld generated by the permanent magnet.
When this particle passes into the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a magnet of reverse 
polarity, the secondary magnetic ﬁeld is now opposed to the primary magnetic ﬁeld. 
This creates a repulsive Lorentz force that acts to ﬂip the particle and realign it with 
the new primary magnetic ﬁeld (Meier-Staude et al., 2002). As the particle ﬂips, it 
deﬂects from its original direction. The degree to which it deﬂects is determined 
by several factors, but the most signiﬁcant is the material itself. Table 5.2 lists sev­
eral materials according to their value of σ/ρ, where σ is the electrical conductivity 
and ρ is the density. Aluminum and magnesium have high conductivity and low 
density. This means that they can be easily deﬂected from a given path by passing 
them through a series of magnets of alternating polarity. Copper is also very con­
ductive, but its density is much higher. As a result, a piece of copper scrap is less 
affected by alternating ﬁelds. Stainless steel is less affected still. This is important, 
since stainless steel is not easily distinguished from aluminum by hand sorters and 
is also not removed by magnetic separators. Finally, plastic and paper are noncon­
ductors and so are unaffected by magnetic ﬁelds. Changing magnet polarities will 
have no effect on them at all.
Figure 5.14 illustrates the standard approach for eddy current separation 
(ECS). Feed is placed on a conveyor, which passes over a rotating drum contain­
ing permanent magnets arranged in alternating polarity. As the particles on the

conveyor belt pass over the magnets, the changing polarity causes them to deﬂect 
from their original path. The deﬂection causes conductive particles to ﬂy off the 
end of the conveyor; the higher the value of σ/ρ, the farther the particle goes. 
Nonconducting particles, or those with a low value of σ/ρ, simply fall off the end 
of the conveyor. Ferrous particles stick to the magnet as before, but as the con­
veyor moves them away from the drum, these particles fall off, eliminating the 
need to clean them off the belt.

In addition to the material, other factors inﬂuence how far particles ﬂy off the end 
of a conveyor-type ECS (Ruan and Xu, 2012):
•	 Field strength of the magnets. Larger magnets improve the separation efﬁ­
ciency of an eddy current unit but add to the cost.
•	 The rotation speed of the drum (increases the force) and the speed at which 
the material is fed to the drum (decreases).
•	 The radius of the drum. Other variables being equal, a larger drum reduces 
throwing force.
•	 Mass of the particles. Larger particles generate larger eddy currents, which 
generate larger secondary magnetic ﬁelds, which results in larger Lorentz 
forces. As a result, heavier pieces of aluminum will ﬂy farther than smaller 
ones. ECS works best when handling uniform-sized feed.
•	 Particle shape. The more nonspherical the particle, the more eddy current 
is generated. As a result, a piece of plate will ﬂy farther than a ball bearing 
of equivalent mass.
•	 Particle bulk density. Hollow pieces have a larger equivalent size than 
bulkier particles. As a result, using an ECS to separate UBCs will require 
weaker magnets than needed for separating aluminum castings.
The conveyor-type separator shown in Figure 5.15 is generally known as a ­concentric 
ECS (Milton, 2010). It is the most widely used type of ECS, but it has one signiﬁ­
cant disadvantage. Ferrous pieces that happen to drop to the inside of the belt will 
stick to the drum as it rotates. Squeezed between the belt and drum, these pieces 
will eventually penetrate the drum and wedge between the drum and the rotating 
magnets, causing considerable damage. Figure 5.15 compares the concentric design 
with the more recent eccentric ECS (Steinert, 2012). In units of this type, the rotating 
magnets are mounted nonconcentrically to the conveyor pulley. This leaves a gap at 
the bottom between the pulley head and the support drum for the magnets. Ferrous

pieces landing on the inside of the belt are pulled away by the conveyor, improving 
the likelihood that they will eventually fall off before causing any damage. Whether 
concentric or eccentric ECS is more effective is a matter of debate.
Figure 5.15 also illustrates an alternative way of arranging the magnets in an 
ECS. Most units use the arrangement shown at the bottom left, in which magnets 
of reverse polarity are alternated. However, a more recent design (bottom right) by 
Huron Valley Steel Corp. (HVSC) rotates the polarity by 90° in each adjacent mag­
net, rather than 180°. This produces a stronger magnetic ﬁeld at the surface and a 
sinusoidal ﬁeld pattern that improves the performance of the separator.
The biggest limitation of ECS has been particle size. For the most part, scrap 
pieces smaller than 10 mm cannot be sorted using conventional devices. This makes 
their use difﬁcult in treating shredded electronic scrap. Previous options for sorting 
of ﬁnes included hand sorting and air tables, but the small amount of metal recovered 
made these processes difﬁcult to justify (Manouchehri, 2007). As a result, ﬁnes have 
often wound up being landﬁlled along with nonmetallics in the scrap. Advances 
in ECS over the past 10 years include techniques for better recovery of ﬁnes. High 
rotation frequencies help achieve this result, and eccentric rotor placement may help 
(Fischer, 2007; Steinert, 2012).
Heavy-media separation (HMS). Table 5.3 lists the densities of aluminum and 
common contaminants in aluminum scrap. A simple way of separating these materi­
als from the aluminum is to put the mixed scrap in a ﬂuid with a density between 
that of aluminum and the contaminant. Materials with a density less than that of the 
ﬂuid will ﬂoat, while those denser than the ﬂuid will sink. HMS uses designer fluids 
to allow such separations. There are three types of ﬂuid.
The ﬁrst type is water (speciﬁc gravity = 1.0). All metals and some plastics 
have densities higher than 1.0, but wood, paper, shredder ﬂuff, and most plas­
tics are lighter than water and will ﬂoat. Municipal recovery facilities often use 
water-based separation devices to separate a metal-rich fraction from other gar­
bage. Figure 5.16 shows a rising current separator or water classifier, in which 
water pumped up through a column ﬂoats a low-density fraction, which overﬂows

at the top (Phillips, 1996), and recovers a high-density fraction from the bottom. 
Water-only HMS is rare for scrap with a high metal content.
The addition of a dissolved salt can create ﬂuids with speciﬁc gravities higher 
than 1.0 (Phillips, 1996). Calcium chloride, calcium nitrate, and potassium carbon­
ate are frequently used for this purpose. The resulting solution has a speciﬁc gravity 
higher than that of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the plastic most commonly used to 
coat wires. As a result, dissolved-salt solutions are most commonly used in wire-
chopping operations. Dissolved-salt solutions with a speciﬁc gravity higher than that 
of magnesium are difﬁcult to prepare. Because of this, these solutions are limited to 
separating nonmetallics from metals in the feed material.
The most common type of ﬂuid is suspended-solid slurry (Manouchehri, 2007), 
in which small particles of a dense solid are suspended in water. The solid is usu­
ally either ferrosilicon (84% Fe, 16% Si) or magnetite (Fe3O4). These materials are 
ferromagnetic, which allows them to be easily removed from the solution. They are 
also inexpensive, corrosion resistant, and nonhazardous to the environment if lost 
or disposed of. By adding different levels of ferrosilicon or magnetite, the speciﬁc

gravity of the suspension can be varied to values greater than 3.0. This allows the 
industrial use of two heavy-media suspensions. The ﬁrst, with a speciﬁc gravity of 
about 2.0, separates aluminum and heavier materials from the magnesium, plastic, 
and other light materials in the feed stream. The second, with a speciﬁc gravity 
higher than 2.4, recovers aluminum in the ﬂoats while other metals remain in the 
sink fraction.
Figure 5.17 shows a typical drum separator used for HMS (Manouchehri, 
2007). HMS is widely used for recovering aluminum from mixed scrap, but it has 
disadvantages:
•	 Sludge and dirt in the feed can affect the speciﬁc gravity of the suspension, 
making it difﬁcult to control.
•	 Composite materials with intermediate speciﬁc gravities may report to the 
wrong fraction. An example is plastic-coated copper wire, which has an 
overall speciﬁc gravity low enough to be confused with aluminum. Hollow 
particles also have an incorrect apparent density and wind up in the wrong 
product stream.
•	 Smaller particles settle poorly in heavy media, so HMS is generally limited 
to pieces larger than 16 mm.
•	 As a wet process, HMS requires drying the products following separation. 
It also requires washing the media off the product and recovering it, an 
additional capital expense.
•	 The loss of suspension media with the product (typically 4–5 kg/tonne of pro­
cessed material) may be a source of contamination. This is a particular prob­
lem if minimizing the iron content in aluminum scrap is important. Media 
lost in the product also has to be replaced, which increases operating costs.
Because of this, efforts have been made to develop a dry heavy-media system to 
replace the suspensions (Phillips, 1996; SGM Magnetics, 2009). The dry system 
(Figure 5.18) uses a ﬂuidized bed of sand kept in motion by electric vibrators. By 
varying the type of sand used, the speciﬁc gravity of the bed can be varied between 
2.3 and 4.6. Scrap fed to the ﬂuidized bed sinks or ﬂoats according to its speciﬁc 
gravity. Dry HMS is not useful for separating aluminum from lighter materials

but can be used to separate it from heavier metals. Whether this approach is cost-­
effective is still uncertain. HMS is currently losing favor to sensor-based sorting 
methods, except for wet shredding ﬂowsheets (Gesing and Harbeck, 2009).
SENSOR-BASED SORTING
The sorting techniques described in the previous section are all familiar elements 
of ﬂowsheets for recovering aluminum and other metals from comminuted scrap. 
However, as the previous discussion has pointed out, all have limitations. These limi­
tations have become more apparent with the need for improved results from sorting. 
Gesing et al. (2010) list eight types of separation desired from a sorting scheme:
•	 Separating ferrous material from nonferrous and nonmetallic materials: 
This is the simplest separation to accomplish, but the recent need to pro­
duce a purer ferrous scrap stream has made it more difﬁcult. Magnets will 
not recover many grades of stainless steel, and these are a signiﬁcant poten­
tial contaminant in scrap aluminum.
•	 Separating nonferrous metal from nonmetallic materials: The adoption of 
ECS has made this easier, but separation of non-liberated metal pieces from 
those without attachments is a challenge.
•	 Separation of metallic from nonmetallic fines: New ECS units have made 
this more feasible, but ﬁnding economically viable ways of doing this is 
still difﬁcult. Even hand sorting of ﬁnes is difﬁcult to economically justify.
•	 Removing contaminants from scrap aluminum: The biggest concern is 
stainless steel, but plastic from e-waste and small copper wires also ﬁnd 
their way into aluminum scrap.
•	 Separating light from dense nonferrous metal: Several techniques (ECS, 
HMS, hand sorting) accomplish this, but each has limitations that recom­
mend replacement.
•	 Separating aluminum from magnesium: These two light metals respond 
the same way to several sorting techniques, and the growing levels of mag­
nesium in automotive and electronic scrap make it increasingly difﬁcult to 
ignore. Dissolved-salt HMS is effective for separating the two, but most 
scrap processors would prefer to avoid it. Hand sorting is somewhat effec­
tive, but the need to produce cleaner wrought aluminum scrap compatible

with production of low-Mg alloy types is encouragement for the develop­
ment of something better.
•	 Separating liberated aluminum from aluminum scrap pieces with attach­
ments and coatings: It makes sense to decoat only that scrap with substan­
tial amounts of organic material in it. Sweat melting should be limited to 
scrap actually attached to pieces of iron.
•	 Separating aluminum alloy families from each other: The problem of alu­
minum alloy tolerance was described in Chapter 2. The use of old scrap to 
produce wrought alloy would be more feasible if aluminum scrap could be 
sorted by alloy series: 2000-series scrap in one pile, 4000-series scrap in 
another, and so on. As the popularity of wrought aluminum continues to 
grow relative to that of cast aluminum (see Chapter 3), this type of separa­
tion is becoming increasingly desirable.
Over the past 15 years, several sensor-based technologies have been developed that 
promise to be more effective at performing these types of separation than the pre­
vious generation of methods. Figure 5.19 illustrates the ﬁrst of these, induction or 
eddy current coil sensors (Milton, 2010; Steinert, 2003c). The sensor, placed under­
neath a conveyor belt carrying nonmagnetic shredded scrap (Figure 5.20), features 
an oscillator that emits a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld generates 
an eddy current in conductive material passing over it. The eddy current in turn 
causes a loss of energy in the oscillator, which is detected by the sensor. Detection 
causes the activation of a circuit that leads to ejection of the conductive piece from 
the conveyor using either an air jet or mechanical ﬁngers. The primary purpose of 
induction sorters is to recover metal from the nonmetallic stream created by ECS. 
However, these sensors can also detect the difference between paramagnetic stain­
less steel and diamagnetic metals such as aluminum and magnesium (Gesing, 2006). 
The separation of stainless steel from nonferrous scrap is difﬁcult to accomplish, and 
this is a valuable attribute. If the particles on the conveyor belt are of similar size, 
high-sensitivity induction sorting can also be used to separate pieces of wire from 
nonmetallic material such as shredder ﬂuff.
Hand sorters have long used differences in the color of scrap pieces to sepa­
rate copper and brass from other metals. High-resolution charge-coupled device 
technology is now used to perform this function automatically, again linked to air-
jet or mechanical devices for ejecting particles from a conveyor into the right pile

(Ridall, 2009). While color separation cannot separate aluminum from other white 
metals such as magnesium, it can potentially be used to separate painted from bare 
scrap (Gesing, 2006). This reduces the amount of unnecessarily decoated material 
and thus the cost.
The use of x-ray technology to identify scrap pieces has become a signiﬁcant 
element in sorting ﬂowsheets over the past decade. X-ray transmission (XRT) 
through scrap pieces is blocked in proportion to the thickness of the piece and 
the atomic number of the metal and can be used to distinguish aluminum from 
heavier metals such as copper and stainless steel without being affected by irregu­
lar shapes the way that HMS can (Gesing, 2006; Steinert, 2007). As a result, XRT 
is replacing HMS in some sorting processes (Fischer, 2007). Dual-energy XRT 
(DEXRT) eliminates the effect of particle thickness and makes possible the sepa­
ration of aluminum from magnesium, another difﬁcult challenge. It might also 
be possible to use XRT to separate wrought aluminum scrap from cast, given the 
high concentration in the latter of heavier alloying elements copper, manganese, 
silicon, and zinc.
A second effect on x-ray absorption by substances is the emission of ﬂuo­
rescence (XRF) in response. The intensity of the ﬂuorescence is a function of 
wavelength, characteristic of the chemical element; each element has a signa­
ture that can be detected (Donovan, 2011). The higher the concentration of a 
particular element in a material, the greater the level of that element’s signature 
that will be measured. As a result, alloys have an overall XRF signature as well, 
and comparing the response from XRF of scrap pieces against these signatures 
can be used as an identiﬁcation tool. This has been used for some time for ﬁeld

identiﬁcation of scrap metal class (stainless steel, titanium, etc.) but more recently 
has been applied for identiﬁcation of speciﬁc alloys (Gaustad et al., 2012; Gesing, 
2007). Online systems have been developed and are being integrated into scrap 
sorting ﬂowsheets (Fischer, 2007). Limitations to XRF as a scrap sorting tool 
include relatively slow speed, equipment cost, and a relative inability to identify 
­low-atomic-number elements such as aluminum and magnesium. The heavy ele­
ments in paint and other coatings can also interfere with XRF analysis. As a result, 
XRF is not commonly used to identify aluminum alloys in scrap, although it may 
be useful for separating alloy series.
A second spectrographic analysis approach for alloy identiﬁcation may have better 
potential for aluminum alloy sorting. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) 
involves illuminating a spot on a piece of scrap with a focused laser beam (Gaustad 
et al., 2012; Gesing, 2006, 2007). This causes the scrap surface to ﬂuoresce. Optical 
emission spectroscopy (OES) of the ﬂuorescence photons is used to produce a quantita­
tive analysis of the alloy composition, which is then compared with alloy speciﬁcations. 
Once identiﬁed by alloy, the scrap piece can then be diverted to the proper scrap bin, 
separating it from scrap of differing compositions. As with XRF, surfaces need to be 
free of paint, in order to avoid analyzing the paint instead of the alloy. They also need 
to be decoated, since some coatings (such as zinc phosphate) contain alloying elements. 
Calibration of the detector is also vital to getting accurate results. LIBS has the advan­
tage of being able to detect and analyze light elements such as aluminum, magnesium, 
and silicon, making it more applicable for aluminum scrap identiﬁcation and sorting. 
Figure 5.21 illustrates the results of LIBS analysis of six common aluminum alloys 
(Gesing et al., 2010). The ability to distinguish between types of alloy is apparent.
Commercial LIBS analyzers for aluminum scrap processing are designed for 
­single-shot analysis of cleaned surfaces (Gesing et al., 2010). Particles are presented 
to the laser one at a time, at an average rate of 40/s. LIBS processing is performed on 
shredded scrap with 1–15 cm particle size, moving at 3 m/s. This allows processing 
of up to seven tonnes of material per hour. The ﬁrst industrial facility of this type was

recently commissioned by Huron Valley Steel Corp. in 2004 in the United States and 
has been in operation since.
Table 5.4, derived from the summary by Gesing et al. (2010), illustrates the pro­
cessing options for the different types of sorting of aluminum scrap. It is likely that 
sensor-based technologies will play a more prominent role in the future, and hand 
sorting and HMS will continue to decline in signiﬁcance.
THERMAL PROCESSING
Decoating: Aluminum and its alloys often come coated with an organic material of 
some sort. A variety of lacquers and polymers are used to coat extruded material, 
most notably can stock and foil. 2xxx and 7xxx alloys are often painted, and turnings 
and borings from machining operations bring with them substantial levels of grease 
and oil. Table 5.5 lists the coatings of different aluminum products (Evans and Guest, 
2000) and the weight fraction of the product consisting of organic material.
Typical practice until the 1980s was to charge coated or oily material directly into 
the melting furnace along with the rest of the scrap. This had several harmful effects 
(McAvoy et al., 1990):
•	 The organic material would burn upon being charged to the furnace. The 
resulting smoke and soot was a workplace health hazard and difﬁcult to 
remove from the plant off-gas.
•	 The burning coating heated the metal underneath, causing it to oxidize as 
well (Rossel et al., 1997). Figure 5.22 shows the melt loss from various 
types of coated and uncoated scrap charged directly to a furnace (McAvoy 
et al., 1990). It can be seen that painted or lacquered scrap oxidizes more 
than bare scrap regardless of alloy. Melting under a salt ﬂux helps some, but 
melt losses from laminated material are still over 5%.

•	 In addition to soot and smoke, other troubling emissions from the burning 
coating included dioxins and furans. Dioxins and furans were more likely 
to form as the temperature rose and are considered especially dangerous in 
even minute quantities (Sweetman et al., 2004).
Because of this, coated or oily scrap became unwanted material in some secondary 
smelters and foundries. UBCs were especially unpopular (van Linden, 1994), since 
they were difﬁcult to submerge in the melt and even more likely to be a high melt-
loss material. However, the growing popularity of aluminum beverage cans, and 
the development of specialized facilities to recycle them, encouraged research into 
­ﬁnding better ways of removing oil and lacquer from scrap surfaces.
A decoating process has several goals:
•	 Complete removal of the organic material from the scrap surface
•	 Minimized oxidation of the scrap surface
•	 Low emissions of harmful by-products, such as volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), dioxins/furans, and nitrous oxides (NOx )
•	 Use of the fuel value of the organic material to make the process autother­
mal, capable of supplying its own energy needs
•	 Minimal capital and operating cost

Figure 5.23 (Kvithyld et al., 2002) illustrates the results of thermogravimetric anal­
ysis (TGA) of lacquered aluminum scrap as it is heated in a low-reactivity environ­
ment (Ar + 1% O2). The bottom curve shows the weight decrease of the sample 
as the lacquer is decomposed to form gaseous species; the top curve shows three 
peaks representing the thermal effects of chemical reactions. The ﬁrst of these 
peaks is thought to represent the breaking of the polymer chains from which the 
coating is formed. The second peak is the formation of VOCs. Mass spectrometric 
analysis of the off-gas from inert-atmosphere decoating of scrap reveals a large 
number of organic compounds; the most signiﬁcant are benzene, toluene, phe­
nol, styrene, benzaldehyde, dioctylphthalate, and bisphenol-A (Evans and Guest, 
2000). The formation of VOCs leaves behind a residue on the surface known as 
char. The third peak of the top curve in Figure 5.23 represents the oxidation of this 
char. When scrap is decoated in an oxygen-free environment, this third peak does 
not appear.
The rate at which these reactions happen varies with temperature and atmosphere. 
Table 5.6, adopted from the results of Kvithyld et al. (2002), predicts the lifetime of 
coatings at different temperatures under Ar and Ar + 1% O2 atmospheres. Higher 
temperatures have an obvious impact, particularly on the second step of the process. 
However, decoating at higher temperatures increases energy use, making it more 
difﬁcult to operate the process autothermally. It also increases surface oxidation of 
the metal during the process of burning off the char. This results in higher melt

loss. As a result, current decoating strategy relies on prolonged exposure at a lower 
temperature (480°C–520°C), which minimizes metal oxidation. However, this can 
also result in incomplete decoating, leaving behind unoxidized char (Stevens and 
Tremblay, 1997).
For scrap with low organic content, decoating in the preheating cham­
ber of a twin-chamber melting furnace is effective and eliminates the need 
for a ­separate unit (Evans and Guest, 2000). This will be further described

Beneficiation Technology
in Chapter 8. However, high-organic scrap requires more time than a preheat­
ing chamber can afford. To effectively decoat this material, a separate furnace 
is needed. Figure 5.24 depicts the predominant type of decoating furnace, a 
rotary kiln. The kiln utilizes the second of the basic strategies for heating scrap, 
mixing the incoming scrap with hot process gas. This gas consists of VOCs 
from the delacquering process, burned with excess air to produce a gas generally 
containing 6%–8% O2. (Oxygen levels above 10% encourage excess oxidation; 
levels under 4% make it difﬁcult to oxidize the char.) The kiln is equipped with 
internal ﬂights that help throw the scrap through the gas, improving heat transfer 
and helping the scrap heat faster.
Three types of rotary kiln are used. In the ﬁrst, process gas is added at the same 
location as the incoming scrap and ﬂows cocurrent with the charge (Evans and 
Guest, 2000). The large temperature difference between the two incoming streams 
ensures higher heat-transfer rates and quicker heating of the scrap. This in turn 
reduces the amount of char generated. However, much of the oxygen in the pro­
cess gas reacts with the VOCs during heating, so less is available to react with 
the char. In a counter-current rotary kiln, the process gas and scrap are added at 
opposite ends and ﬂow opposite to each other. This allows more heat to be removed 
from the gas, improving thermal efﬁciency. It also means more oxygen is avail­
able in the gas to react with the char. However, the smaller temperature differences 
between gas and scrap mean that heat-transfer rates are lower, and the scrap heats 
at a slower rate. As a result, there is more char to be oxidized than cocurrent rotary 
kilns generate. The IDEX furnace attempts to achieve the advantages of both types 
by introducing the gas through a central coaxial tube in a cocurrent direction. The 
temperature difference between the gas and scrap is sufﬁcient to encourage heat 
transfer by radiation. When the gas exits the tube at the discharge end of the kiln, it 
retains sufﬁcient oxygen content to burn off the char. It then ﬂows back through the 
scrap, transferring more heat to the charge and improving thermal efﬁciency. The 
extra complexity increases capital costs, however.
Some scrap is still decoated using a packed-bed reactor or belt decoater.

lower temperature for an extended period. Scrap is packed in a bed on a moving 
wire-mesh belt (McAvoy et al., 1990). As it moves through the furnace, hot process 
gas is blown or drawn through the bed. As with the rotary kiln, the gas consists of 
combusted VOCs generated by the decoating scrap, burned with excess air to gener­
ate a gas with 6%–8% O2. The scrap is heated to lower temperatures than the rotary 
kiln (480°C–520°C) and stays in the furnace for a longer time (5 min).
Proper operation of a belt decoater is tricky (McAvoy et al., 1990), because sev­
eral variables must be controlled properly to get optimal results. These include the 
gas ﬂow rate through the bed, the inlet gas temperature, belt speed, bed thickness, 
and particle size of the shredded scrap. Typical practice is for a bed thickness of 
75 mm and inlet gas temperatures of 500°C–600°C. The use of a traveling bed guar­
antees equal residence time for all the feed particles and contact with the gas for all 
the scrap. The thin bed depth reduces temperature gradients, encouraging consistent 
results.
Also available (but rarely used) is the fluidized bed decoater, developed by Alcan 
in the early 1990s (McAvoy et al., 1990). Figure 5.26 is a schematic of this type of 
furnace, which like the belt decoater uses longer exposures at lower temperatures for 
decoating. The key to this technology is the bed of inert particles that is ﬂuidized 
by heated process gas fed through the bottom of the unit. The hot particles transfer 
heat to the solid pieces of scrap more efﬁciently than the hot gas alone, resulting in 
shorter required residence times than needed in a belt decoater. The operating tem­
perature and rotation speed of the rotating decoater drum through which the scrap is 
fed allows decoating of a variety of feed types.
In operation, scrap is fed through the airlocks at the left and enters the drum, 
which has been perforated to allow ﬂuidizing medium in and out. The ﬂuidizing 
gas fed through the bottom is a mixture of compressed air and natural gas. The 
combustion of the natural gas and the VOCs generated by the decomposing coating 
generates heat to operate the process. In the ﬁrst portion of the drum, the gas mix­
ture is kept oxygen-poor to encourage volatilization of the coating without excessive 
oxidation of the scrap. As the scrap moves through the drum, the mixture becomes

progressively oxygen-rich, to encourage burning off the char. The rotation of the 
drum keeps the scrap from settling to the bottom. As the decoated scrap leaves the 
furnace, it goes through a desanding zone and then a hot media screen designed to 
recover the ﬂuidizing medium. This reduces both losses of the medium and impuri­
ties in the decoated scrap.
A common element to all three types of decoater is the need to combust the VOCs 
in the off-gas. This provides process heat and ensures an environmentally acceptable 
discharge from the facility. In the ﬂuidized bed decoater, VOCs are burnt off in a 
thermal decoating zone located inside the unit. In rotary kilns and belt decoaters, 
a separate afterburner is provided (Evans and Guest, 2000). Temperature control 
of the combustion is important. If the temperature is too low, the VOCs will not 
be completely oxidized; if the temperature level is too high, unacceptable levels of 
NOx and dioxins/furans may result. In practice, afterburners often operate at around 
800°C–850°C.
Pyrolysis of composite packaging: As mentioned in Chapters 2 and 3, some 
of the aluminum used in packaging is used in foil form, rather than the extruded 
can stock most commonly encountered. Aluminum foil is used in a variety of 
packages, most often laminated or attached to paper or plastic. The percentage of 
aluminum in these packages is low, and the thin aluminum foil is easily oxidized, 
so recycling this material with minimal melt loss is particularly difﬁcult (Bateman 
et al., 1999).
When packaging of this sort is recovered, current recycling practice is to decom­
pose the package at a paper mill through a depulping process (Steeman, 2013). The 
solid residue from this process is a mixture of polyethylene and aluminum, which 
is often incinerated or disposed of. However, a pyrolysis process has recently been 
developed that recovers the aluminum and decomposes the plastic to a hydrocarbon

mixture for combustion (European Commission, 2011). The process operates at 
450°C in an oxygen-free environment. Recovery of the aluminum from composite 
packaging is rare at this time.
Paint removal: Decoating and pyrolysis is effective at separating scrap 
­aluminum from organic coatings and contaminants. However, much alu­
minum scrap is painted, and paint removal is more difﬁcult. The organic 
component of paint can be volatilized, but paint often contains inorganic 
compounds (in particular TiO2) that do not respond to thermal processing 
(Bateman et al., 1999). The inorganic compounds remain with the scrap and wind 
up in the dross when the scrap is remelted. This increases melt loss and increases 
the amount of dross that must be handled. Furthermore, some of the TiO2 may be 
reduced by the molten aluminum:
	
3TiO2 + 4Al (l) = 3Ti (dissolved in metal) + 2Al2O3 (dross)	
(5.1)
To some degree, paint can be removed during the decoating process by abrasion, 
such as the tumbling action during rotary kiln operation (Bateman et al., 1999). 
The abrasion caused by the ﬂuidizing medium during ﬂuidized-bed decoating is 
even more effective. Research has shown that a formic acid–halogenated acetic acid 
solution causes the paint to swell and loosen itself from the can, making it easier to 
remove (Fujisawa et al., 2000). However, the practicality of this approach is doubtful, 
except for large quantities of heavily painted scrap.
Partial melting: In a previous section, the value of separating aluminum scrap 
on the basis of alloy content was discussed. One of the early attempts to par­
tially accomplish this goal used differences between the solidus temperatures of 
­various alloys. The solidus is the temperature where melting of the alloy begins 
to occur. Depending on the appropriate phase diagram, alloys with high amounts 
of added elements (such as casting alloys) can have a lower solidus than lightly 
alloyed wrought compositions (Maurice et al., 2000). This can be used to upgrade 
mixed-alloy scrap. As mentioned in Chapter 2, aluminum beverage cans are typi­
cally made of two wrought alloys: a low-alloy body (3004) and high-magnesium 
5182 for the top and tab. The solidus temperature of 3004 is 629°C, while that 
of 5182 is 581°C, some 48°C lower. Using this, Alcoa designed a rotary delacquer­
ing kiln for UBCs to operate at an intermediate temperature (Bowman, 1985). 
The tumbling action of the kiln is sufﬁcient to decompose the lids into small 
ﬂakes, while the can bodies remain unaffected. Screening the product separates 
two alloys. This allows closed-loop remelting of the can bodies to produce 3004 
and similar closed-loop melting of the 5182 ﬂakes to produce separate lid stock. 
However, the use of partial melting to separate mixed-alloy UBC scrap ultimately 
proved uneconomic.
Sweat melting: While most aluminum scrap can be liberated from other metals 
to which it is attached by shredding, there are exceptions. Some aluminum parts 
are so intricately attached to iron parts that they will not be separated by ordinary 
shredding. Examples include transmissions, cylinder heads, and manifolds. These 
items are known as high-irony scrap (ISRI grade Tarry C; see Figure 4.1) because of 
the extremely high levels of iron (50% or more at times). Scrap of this type has too 

97
Beneficiation Technology
much aluminum to be classiﬁed as ferrous scrap but too much iron to be remelted by 
secondary smelters.
Figure 5.26 shows a traditional solution to this problem (EnviroAir Inc., 2005; 
Nijkerk and Dalmijn, 1998), a sweat furnace. Sweat furnaces can be either the 
rotary type shown here or a less sophisticated stationary dry-hearth design. In 
either case, the principle is simple. High-irony scrap fed to the furnace is heated 
to a temperature just above the melting point of aluminum (660°C). At this tem­
perature, the aluminum slowly melts away (hence the term, sweating), leaving the 
higher-melting point iron behind. The liquid aluminum drains from the bottom of 
the furnace and is cast in the form of sows or pigs. (The product is often known 
as sweated pig; see ISRI grade Throb in Figure 4.1.) The furnaces can be oper­
ated with a variety of fuels and are also used for melting zinc away from solid 
aluminum in scrap radiators at lower temperatures. (This recovers aluminum as 
well as zinc.) Rotary furnaces do a better job of separating the melted aluminum 
from the iron pieces and so tend to produce a sweated pig with lower iron content 
(Figure 5.27).
Sweated pig is commonly sold in one of two grades, 1-1-1 or 1-1-3 
(Rochester, 2009). The numbers refer to the maximum allowable percentages 
of magnesium, iron, and zinc in the product. There are no limits on the percent­
ages of other alloying elements. The aluminum scrap melted in sweat furnaces is 
normally cast alloy, so typical copper contents might be 2.5%–3.0%, the normal 
silicon range is 6.0%–9.0%, and manganese might range from 0.2% to 2.0%. 
Sweated pig is usually sold to secondary smelters, where it is remelted and mixed 
with other scrap.

Balers: The aluminum scrap recovered using the technology previously described 
consists of loose pieces, with a very low bulk density. This makes it difﬁcult to han­
dle and ship and makes it more likely that it will pick up moisture during shipment. 
As a result, some method of densiﬁcation is desirable before shipping. Figure 5.28 
illustrates the operation of a baler, which compresses scrap using hydraulic rams. 
The baler shown here is a three-stroke unit (Zöllner, 2003). This process starts by 
compressing from the side perpendicular to the door; it then compresses from the top 
down and ﬁnally in the direction of the door. As the ﬁnal compression is completed, 
the door opens and the ﬁnished bale is pushed out. Because baling deforms the metal 
during compression, metal bales are more cohesive than those made from plastic or 
paper and usually do not require tying with wire.
The baler shown in Figure 5.28 is a two-ram baler, which is more commonly used 
for processing metal scrap than single-ram units (Fowler, 2007b). Improvements in 
recent years include better wear resistance, improved control systems that minimize 
the need for an operator, and ﬂooded suction pumps and sturdier ﬁltration systems 
for better hydraulics.
While consolidation of some sort is essential prior to shipping scrap, bales are not 
always popular with scrap consumers. The bales are often too big to charge directly 
to a furnace, and bales often contain surprises—moisture, contaminants, grease, 
and oil. Because of this, bales are often shredded and reprocessed by the consumer 
upon arrival.
Briquetting: One of the more difﬁcult types of new scrap to recycle is turn­
ings and borings generated by machining operations (Pietsch, 1993). This type of 
scrap has a very large surface area/volume ratio, making it more prone to oxida­
tion during melting. Furthermore, turnings and borings are frequently covered 
with grease or oil (as much as 20%–30% by weight), which is highly undesir­
able in remelting. In response, turnings and borings are often briquetted. This 
too is a process of compaction under pressure (30 MPa is typical), using much 
higher pressure and producing much smaller compacts. Briquetting reduces the 
effective surface area/volume ratio of the turnings, helping to reduce melt loss. 
It also squeezes up to 95% of the grease and oil out of the feed (Novelli, 2006), 
which makes subsequent processing easier (and recovers the ﬂuids for reuse). If 
the scrap chips or turnings are to be shipped, briquetting can reduce its volume 
by up to 90%.
Figure 5.29 illustrates the two types of briquetting technology used (Pietsch, 
1993). The traditional punch-and-die machine produces cylindrical briquettes or 
pucks with diameters of 12–15 cm and a height of roughly 10 cm. A newer approach 
involves feeding the material to a hydraulic roller press, which operates continu­
ously and produces a strip of compacted material with a density near theoretical. 
Roller presses are more productive than punch-and-die briquetting machines, par­
ticularly for handling aluminum swarf; capacities range up to 2500 kg/h. However, 
punch-and-die machines are more cost-effective for small operations and handle 
more elastic turnings and borings better. The practice of shredding turnings prior to 
briquetting helps improve the results.

6 Beneficiation Practice
The previous chapter introduced the technology used to beneﬁciate aluminum scrap. 
The processor of scrap material has several options to choose from for turning col­
lected material into a product that can be sold to customers. The choice of options 
depends on the cost of different processing technologies, the added value that the 
scrap will have when improved to a particular grade, the demand for particular 
grades of scrap, and the impact of government regulations. This chapter will exam­
ine the ﬂowsheets by which different sources of scrap aluminum are processed and 
the rationale behind the choice of particular technologies. This will be done using 
the same categories of ore described in Chapter 3—new scrap, UBCs, automotive 
and transportation scrap, electrical and electronic scrap, and municipal solid waste 
(MSW).
NEW SCRAP
The variety of types of new scrap and the variety of ways in which it is collected and 
distributed make it impossible to generalize about how it is processed. However, com­
pared with old scrap, new scrap has several advantages that make it easier to upgrade:
•	 New scrap is a known: The purchaser of new scrap knows how much mate­
rial is being purchased and which alloys it consists of. The impurities in the 
scrap—iron, plastic, other metals—are also known. This makes it easier to 
design processing schemes.
•	 New scrap is usually cleaner: Because it has never been put in service, new 
scrap has less dirt and moisture on it and is usually in better condition. This 
makes it easier to generate a clean product for sale to remelting facilities.
•	 New scrap does not require disassembly: New scrap is usually obtained as 
pieces of alloy and is less likely to include attachments, paint, and other mate­
rials that will require physical separation. This reduces processing costs.
New scrap comes in many conditions and purities, and most of the beneﬁciation tech­
niques described in the previous chapter are applied to one or more of the grades. 
However, some are more commonly used than others. These include the following:
•	 Hand sorting: Because a load of mixed new scrap often includes a limited 
number of alloys, hand sorting often makes it possible to produce single-
alloy scrap products. Even if this is not possible, hand sorting can help 
meet speciﬁcations for other scrap grades, by removing impurities. Often, a 
dealer’s experience and knowledge of his suppliers is useful in hand sorting, 
because the appearance of a piece of new scrap—the shape of a punching, 
the type of scrapped casting or part—will be sufﬁcient to identify the alloy.

106
Aluminum Recycling
•	 Screening: This is used both to remove undersize pieces of aluminum and 
to separate out dirt and other extraneous matter.
•	 Shredding: This is done primarily to reduce large pieces of scrap (such as 
stamping skeletons or cable) to a size suitable for charging to a furnace. 
However, it is often done to turnings as well, because smaller turnings are 
easier to briquette (Nijkerk and Dalmijn, 1998).
•	 Briquetting: Used primarily for turnings and borings. This is usually per­
formed before degreasing. It helps to squeeze out some of the oil and grease, 
in addition to turning small particles into an equivalent larger piece of scrap 
(Nijkerk and Dalmijn, 1998).
•	 Thermal decoating: If the amount of grease and oil in a scrap load is less 
than 1%, the scrap can be charged directly to a remelting furnace without con­
cern over excessive smoke or melt loss. However, higher levels will require 
degreasing, using one of the thermal decoating technologies described in the 
previous chapter. Degreasing is usually required for borings and turnings.
MSW
Of all the sorting technologies introduced in the previous chapter, hand sorting 
remains the most common method of recovering aluminum and other recyclables 
from MSW. Hand sorting is performed at one or more of several locations:
•	 By the waste generator: The different blue bag systems used by municipali­
ties were described in Chapter 3. Using dual- or multiple-stream recycling 
results in a UBC product with improved quality, that is, less moisture and 
fewer impurities. However, it is claimed that single-stream recycling results 
in improved participation, and there is a higher overall collection rate. The 
recent trend has been toward single stream (Kessler Consulting, 2009b; 
Morawski, 2010; Schaffer, 2009).
•	 By the primary collector: Figure 3.3 shows a truck speciﬁcally designed for 
collecting curbside recyclables. The truck contains separate ­compartments 
for each type of recyclable. As the driver retrieves blue bags, he sorts the con­
tents into the separate compartments. This type of vehicle is required for use 
with dual-stream recycling. For single-stream recycling, it has become appar­
ent that sorting at an MRF is a preferred option (Kessler Consulting, 2009b).
•	 At centralized MRFs: Most MRFs still use some sort of hand sorting of 
incoming refuse to eliminate large and bulky items that would interfere 
with subsequent processing; this includes items such as cardboard boxes, 
plastic bags, and occasionally aluminum siding. However, the use of hand 
sorting to recover smaller items such as UBCs is increasingly less common 
(Kranert et al., 2004). MRFs are becoming increasingly automated, as will 
be described later.
•	 At the dump: The role of dumpsite scavengers in recycling was described 
in Chapter 3. Scavenging is an effective means of recovering metal from 
refuse, but is increasingly unacceptable from a societal perspective and is 
generally replaced as a region develops (Wilson et al., 2009).

107
Beneficiation Practice
The ﬂowsheet used by MRFs for processing municipal refuse depends on the type 
of input, the cost of equipment and land, and the price for recyclables. Screening is 
commonly used to (1) separate oversize materials such as paper and cardboard from 
the rest of the garbage or (2) separate undersize materials such as glass shards and 
bottle caps from the bulk of the material (Kessler Consulting, 2009b; Kranert et al., 
2004). Trommels are the most common type of screen. Most MRFs also feature 
magnetic separation in their process. Magnetic separators recover a ferrous prod­
uct that can be sold to steel recyclers, and they purify the nonferrous fraction of 
iron that would otherwise be a contaminant. The use of eddy current separators 
is increasingly a standard method for generating an aluminum fraction with fewer 
impurities; models of ECS have been introduced that are effective enough to recover 
aseptic packaging as well as UBCs (see Chapter 3). Several other sensor-based sort­
ing devices may also be useful for recovering aluminum from trash, including opti­
cal and induction sorting.
The importance of product purity in the aluminum recovered by MRF facilities is 
highlighted in Table 6.1. This is a set of speciﬁcations for grades of ­MRF-recovered 
aluminum, listing the maximum of various impurity elements allowed in each 
grade. (The speciﬁcations, produced by the American ASTM [1999], have since 
been abandoned.) Grades 5 and 6 are suitable for reuse in the production of

Aluminum Recycling
casting alloys; grades 1–4 are potentially useful for ­producing various types of 
wrought alloy. The high limits for magnesium content reﬂect the predominance of 
UBCs in the aluminum recovered by MRFs. The iron, chromium, and nickel limits 
reﬂect the challenge of removing stainless steel from aluminum. In addition to the 
chemical elements listed in Table 6.1, aluminum recovered by MRFs should have no 
more than 1 wt.-% ﬁnes for Class A product or 3% for lower-value Class B. A maxi­
mum of 2% loose combustible material is speciﬁed, as is a maximum of 0.5% mois­
ture. More recent speciﬁcations by the American recycler Evermore Recycling (2012) 
also specify limits on ﬁnes and moisture content. MRFs have a difﬁcult time meet­
ing these standards, so it is not uncommon for bales of recovered UBCs to be sent 
for further upgrading before they can be accepted by a smelting facility (Schaffer, 
2009). Income from the sale of UBCs is a substantial fraction of the income received 
by MRFs (Kessler Consulting, 2009a), so efforts are being made to improve sorting 
operations to avoid this extra step (Taylor, 2006).
UBCS AND OTHER PACKAGING
UBCs are among the few types of old aluminum scrap recycled primarily into 
wrought alloy rather than cast. As a result, the quality requirements for UBC scrap 
are tighter than for other grades. This means that more upgrading is performed on 
this than on other scrap types.
Scrap UBCs come primarily from two sources: cans recovered by blue bag 
recycling programs, MRFs, and scavengers from municipal garbage, and cans spe­
ciﬁcally collected by buy-back centers and similar operations. In either case, the 
collector will usually perform some upgrading of the collected cans before sell­
ing them to the remelting facility (Broughton, 1994; Harler, 1998; Steverson, 1995). 
Beneﬁciation of the cans by the collector often includes (1) ﬂattening the collected 
cans, (2) magnetic separation of iron and steel, and (3) baling or logging prior to 
shipping. A signiﬁcant concern during ﬂattening and baling is the presence of alumi­
num aerosol cans, which contain ﬂuids under pressure. These cans are not common, 
but the contents sometimes include ﬂammable liquids and are potential explosion 
hazards (Smith et al., 2001). The level of hazard that aerosol cans pose is a matter 
of debate. Another problem in UBC scrap can be the presence of used hypodermic 
needles (Goodrich, 2001). The steel in these needles is nonmagnetic stainless, and 
so they are difﬁcult to remove.
The scrap grade speciﬁcations in Figure 4.1 include several for UBCs (ISRI, 
2012). Taldon (Figure 6.1) is the most important of these, since most UBCs are baled 
prior to shipping. The speciﬁcation excludes any material other than UBCs. Other 
container materials such as plastic and steel are speciﬁcally unwelcome. Plastic clogs 
up the grates in shredders, and the burning of plastic in decoating furnaces causes 
loss of temperature control and damage to the furnace (Novelis, 2006).
One of the more surprising impurities that UBC processors deal with is lead 
(McNealy, 2008; Novelis, 2006). This appears to come mostly from the dirt 
attached to the cans as well as from deliberate contamination (Taylor, 2001b). 
Since even small levels of lead can injure the properties of 3xxx series alloys, 
processors and remelters go to considerable lengths to eliminate the dirt. Even so, 

109
Beneficiation Practice
remelted UBCs often contain 50–100 parts per million lead, and this is an ongoing 
concern.
Once the baled UBCs are received by a remelt facility, a series of additional 
upgrading processes are performed (Evans and Guest, 2000; Taylor, 2001b). The 
ﬁrst is shredding of the bales, using a low-speed shredder of hammer mill. This 
(1) reduces the cans to a uniform particle size, (2) exposes the lacquered inside 
surface of the cans, making them easier to decoat, (3) allows trapped moisture or 
liquids to be drained away, and (4) releases trapped contaminants in the cans, allow­
ing them to be removed. The shredded cans are then screened and conveyed under 
another magnetic separator.
Once the impurities are removed, the ﬁnal step before remelting is decoating. The 
environmental and hygienic advantages of decoating were described in the previous 
chapter. Decoating is also useful because it preheats the scrap (Evans and Guest, 
2000; Thornton et al., 2007). This reduces the time needed to melt the UBCs in the 
melting furnace. Because of this, more metal can be melted per hour in a furnace. 
In addition, utilizing the fuel value of the VOCs reduces total required energy costs. 
The presence of plastic and rubber in the UBCs makes temperature control difﬁcult, 
so rotary decoating furnaces (which are less sensitive to temperature variations) are 
more commonly used.
Separate processing of foil and low-aluminum packaging is rare in North 
America, since separation of this material is rarely required or encouraged (Shoch 
and Gendell, 2011). In Europe, recycling foil packaging is often required. The 
depulping process described in the previous chapter is used (Kmeco and Fedorishin, 
2010); as pointed out, this produces a polyethylene/aluminum composite residue 
that is difﬁcult to separate. While pyrolysis is possible (see previous chapter), the 
cost is difﬁcult to justify. Life-cycle analysis performed by Varžinskas et al. (2012) 
has shown that turning this composite into roof shingles may be the best option.

Aluminum Recycling
AUTOMOTIVE SCRAP
Figure 6.2 shows a traditional ﬂowsheet for the recovery of aluminum from scrapped 
automobiles (Cui and Roven, 2010). This process has changed considerably over the 
years, in part due to the increasing importance of recovering the aluminum in the 
hulk. The development of new sorting technology described in the previous chapter 
will likely change this ﬂowsheet more in the future.
As mentioned in Chapter 3, the ﬁrst step in recycling an automobile is the dis­
mantling process. This can be divided into three parts (Bebelaar and Dalmijn, 2007; 
Paul, 2007). The ﬁrst is pretreatment, which is the removal of those items that are 
mandated either by law or shredder operators. These include all ﬂuids, the batteries, 
tires, airbags, and mercury switches. Airbag and mercury switch removal is man­
dated by shredder operators, for safety and environmental reasons (Fischer, 2007a).
The second part of dismantling is removal of parts that can be reused or recondi­
tioned. A long list of parts are candidates for reuse (Nakajima and Vanderburg, 2005; 
Paul, 2007), depending on the model of the vehicle; as described in Chapter 3, used 
cars (especially newer models) are often made available for parts recovery for some 
time before being further processed (Taylor, 2012). The third step of dismantling 
is the removal of parts whose value as recyclable material justiﬁes the expense of 
speciﬁcally recovering them. The best example of this is catalytic converters, which 
contain platinum-group metals worth recovering. Aluminum parts that have enough 
potential value to be deliberately removed from a vehicle before shredding include

wheels, compressors, alternators, water pumps, transmissions, and possibly engine 
blocks and heads. Dismantling is increasingly important as a recycling process, and 
designing cars that can be easily dismantled (without coming apart more easily on 
their own) is a priority of automakers (Fischer, 2007a). European automakers have in 
fact formed partnerships with automotive dismantlers to improve parts recovery and 
reuse (Nakajima and Vanderburg, 2005). Even so, the parts recovered from a typical 
dismantled auto contain only about 20% of the aluminum used in the vehicle.
Most dismantling is still done by hand, but there is increasing interest in assem­
bly dismantling (Manouchehri, 2007; West–Japan Auto Recycle Co., Ltd., 2004). 
Figure 6.3 shows a Japanese auto dismantling ﬂowsheet in which parts of the body 
are separated from the engine and drive train before shredding. Demanufacturing 
operations of this sort are encouraged by regulations in Europe and Japan that 
require the recovery or recycling of up to 95% the content of scrapped automobiles 
by 2015 (Gesing, 2005; Kanari et al., 2003). White goods (refrigerators, air condi­
tioners, washers/dryers) are also partially dismantled prior to shredding (Karpel, 
2006).
Once the desired dismantling has been done, the remaining auto hulk is shred­
ded (Gesing, 2006). Nearly all automobiles are shredded using the horizontal ham­
mer mill described in the previous chapter. Figure 11.9 is a map of the over 200 
shredding facilities in the United States as of 2011; as might be suspected, the loca­
tion of shredders is largely determined by population density. A similar number of 
shredders are located in Europe. The trend in the United States has turned toward 
smaller shredders (Fowler, 2012), which allow operators to match capacity to the 
size of the local market. Another trend is toward the use of moist rather than dry 
shredding (Manouchehri, 2007); wet shredding appears to be less popular. In addi­
tion to dismantled auto hulks, shredders are also fed whole older cars, white goods, 
metal recovered from construction and demolition activities, and other transporta­
tion scrap. Maintaining a consistent mix of these inputs is important to ensuring 
smooth shredder operation.
Figure 6.4, from the 2010 presentation by Gesing et al. (2010), describes the pro­
cessing of dry shredding product. The drum magnet that recovers ferrous material 
is likely a two-drum arrangement, as shown in the previous chapter. If moist instead 
of dry shredding is used, the cyclone and baghouse receive material only from the 
Z-box air classiﬁer and the product screens. The return of oversize material from 
the screens to the shredder is important because downstream devices such as eddy 
current and heavy media separators operate best with uniform size feed. The sec­
ond magnetic separation helps eliminate ferrous material from the feed to the ECS. 
This prevents damage to the separator and produces a purer NMMC heavy-metal 
stream. The three nonmetallic streams are collectively known as automotive shred­
der residue (ASR) or shredder fluff. The product moving from the screens to the ECS 
is known as nonmagnetic shredder fraction (NMSF) and is equivalent to the Zorba 
scrap grade described in Figure 4.1. It contains most of the nonferrous metals in the 
auto hulk, along with rubber, glass, and some unrecovered plastic. The analysis of 
NMSF varies depending on what was input to the shredder, but ranges from 50% to 
over 90% aluminum. This value will increase as aluminum usage in automobiles 
continues to grow. About 81% of the aluminum input to the shredder winds up in the

NMSF and another 18% in the shredder ﬂuff (Manouchehri, 2007). (The remainder 
is lost in the ferrous product.)
Although Figure 6.4 shows the use of ECS for sorting NMSF, there are several 
process options. One that continues to be popular is the use of hand sorting. Hand 
sorting is a particularly effective technology for dealing with the oversize material 
from the shredder, since it eliminates the cost of reshredding (Manouchehri, 2007). 
As a result, an active market exists for oversize NMSF and Zorba, although increas­
ing labor costs are beginning to have an impact.
If NMSF is kept for further downstream processing, the next step is one of two 
options. Figure 6.5 shows the older of the two, which starts with HMS (Cui and 
Roven, 2010; Gesing et al., 2010; Seebacher et al., 2006). In practice, the feed to 
HMS is often washed ﬁrst in a rising-current water separator such as that described 
in the previous chapter (Manouchehri, 2007); this removes much of the plastic and 
remaining shredder ﬂuff from the NMSF, improving the efﬁciency of the HMS 
units. The ﬁgure shows two-stage HMS, with ﬂuids maintained at speciﬁc gravi­
ties of 2.0 and 3.5. The ﬂoated material from the ﬁrst stage is sometimes known 
by the ISRI speciﬁcation Zeppelin (ISRI, 2012) and contains most of the nonmag­
netic material in the feed, along with magnesium and some of the aluminum (hollow 
and thin-gauge pieces have a lower apparent density). Figure 6.6 shows the ﬂoated 
material from the second stage, which contains the rest of the aluminum as well as

minor amounts of insulated wire and denser nonmetallic material (stones, glass). It 
is marketed using the ISRI speciﬁcation Twitch (see Figure 4.1). The heavy fraction 
from the second HMS stage contains higher-density metals such as copper, zinc, and 
stainless steel and is known by the ISRI speciﬁcation Zebra.
The Twitch recovered from the second HMS can be further upgraded by process­
ing in an eddy current separator (Gesing et al., 2010; Manouchehri, 2007). This 
separates the aluminum from the wire and nonmetallics. The Zeppelin recovered 
from the ﬁrst separator can also be upgraded using ECS, but will have to be further 
processed to separate the aluminum from the magnesium, using either hand picking 
or a sensor-based technique (Seebacher et al., 2006).
The disadvantages of using HMS as the ﬁrst step in sorting NMSF include incom­
plete separation of aluminum from magnesium and the difﬁculty of separating alu­
minum from insulated wire. As the use of electronics in automobiles grows, this 
becomes a more signiﬁcant problem. As a result, the ﬂowsheet in Figure 6.4 shows the 
use of ECS as the ﬁrst sorting step instead (Gesing et al., 2010). ECS generates three 
products: a nonmetallic stream containing the heaviest metals (lead, stainless steel), 
along with most of the rubber and plastic; NMMC containing high-density metals 
(copper, zinc) and pieces of aluminum attached to other metals; and a light-metal 
stream containing magnesium and the rest of the aluminum. The light-metal stream 
resembles the Zeppelin product from HMS and will require further upgrading. ECS 
does a better job than HMS at separating the aluminum in NMSF from the wire and 
eliminates the other concerns of using HMS (see Chapter 5).
Figure 6.7 shows what may be the future of automotive recycling (Fischer, 2007b). 
The system relies on ECS as the ﬁrst sorting tool for handling NMSF as before 
(Gesing et al., 2010), but now includes a second separator speciﬁcally for processing 
ﬁnes. The ECS units produce only two streams: a nonferrous stream containing the 
metallic content and a nonmetallic ﬂuff. Aluminum is recovered from the nonferrous 
stream using the x-ray transmission system described in the previous chapter, most 
likely a DEXRT to eliminate size and shape effects. The ﬂowsheet also relies on 
x-ray ﬂuorescence to process heavier nonferrous metals and to produce a copper-free 
ferrous scrap product. Future NMSF processing may also utilize induction sorting 
to recover stainless steel, color sorting to separate out shredded circuit boards, and 
LIBS to separate aluminum and magnesium and to sort pieces of aluminum alloy 
by series.
The aluminum content of shredder ﬂuff is only 1.5%–2%, and the percentage 
of other metals is even smaller (Srogi, 2007). As a result, shredder ﬂuff has tradi­
tionally been landﬁlled or burned for its fuel value. However, this is increasingly 
unacceptable from an environmental standpoint. Regulations such as the European 
Union recycling targets discussed in Chapter 3 have made it increasingly necessary 
to process shredder ﬂuff (Kanari et al., 2003). The increasing value of the metal in 
shredder ﬂuff (particularly the copper) has also spurred efforts to process this stream 
for metal recovery. ECS units designed for treating ﬁnes can be used to recover metal 
from shredder ﬂuff; induction sorters are also effective (Fischer, 2007b; Gesing, 
2006). As previously mentioned, 18% of the aluminum input to the shredding pro­
cess winds up in the ﬂuff (Manouchehri, 2007), so an efﬁcient process for metals 
recovery from this stream could be cost effective.

Aluminum Recycling
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SCRAP (SULLIVAN, 1985)
Upgrading schemes for wire and cable scrap vary according to the type of scrap 
being processed. As a result, there is no typical ﬂowsheet for the process. However, 
several unit operations are common to most cable scrap processing sequences.
The ﬁrst step in cable processing is often hand sorting, which separates cable 
scrap by metal (aluminum or copper) and by size (Muchová and Eder, 2010). This 
is typically followed by a shearing step, meant to reduce the cable to 25–50 cm 
lengths. Portable alligator or guillotine shears are commonly used for this. Some 
operations now use high-speed shredders instead and prechop to lengths as small 
as 2 cm (Taylor, 2001a). Large pieces are also removed by hand prior to chopping 
(Fowler, 2008).
Figure 6.8 shows the construction of a typical underground cable (Nijkerk and 
Dalmijn, 1998). Recycling this cable is more difﬁcult than recycling the typical 
­plastic-coated above-ground cable. In addition to the materials shown here, underground 
cables can also have lead sheathing, mastic, oil, grease, and tar-impregnated paper.

Beneficiation Practice
Because of this, wire-chopping scrap underground cable can present a serious safety 
and environmental hazard (Fowler, 2008). To mitigate this hazard, sheared under­
ground cable is often stripped to separate the coating layers. The stripping opens up 
the various layers, and the metal content is pulled out by hand. The process is slow and 
justiﬁable only for large-diameter cables.
For other cables, chopping (also known as granulation) follows shearing (Muchová 
and Eder, 2010). Chopping is a specialized form of low-speed shredding, intended 
to separate the metal in the cable from the plastic or rubber coating. The smaller 
the size of chop produced by this step, the greater the liberation of the metal from 
the insulation. However, chopping to a smaller size increases costs and reduces the 
productivity of the granulator. Some operations have a two-stage chopping sequence 
to minimize this bottleneck (Fowler, 2008). Final chop size is usually less than 1 cm.
The next step is often magnetic separation, to remove any steel pieces from the 
chop. Larger pieces of steel are usually removed by hand shearing prior to chopping, 
but small pieces may remain and must be removed. This is followed by separation 
of the metal from the insulation, using the difference between the speciﬁc gravity of 
the two. This is most commonly done using air tables, but air knives are also used, 
as are water-based rising current separators (Fowler, 2008). If the cable has not been 
sorted before chopping, a second classiﬁcation step is needed to separate copper 
from aluminum. Properly chopped and sorted aluminum wire is marketed as ISRI 
grade Tall (ISRI, 2012).

Aluminum Recycling
The recovery of aluminum from electronic scrap is different than from other types. 
The reason is that the average aluminum content of discarded electronic equipment 
is small, about 4%–5% (Muchová and Eder, 2010). The value of other materials in 
the scrap, in particular copper and precious metals, is greater than that of the alumi­
num. As a result, recovery of the aluminum is not a high-­priority concern. However, 
the recycling of scrap computers and associated equipment is increasingly mandated 
by law (Herat and Pariatamby, 2012). The development of recycling schemes that 
minimize the amount of waste to dispose of means that recovery of aluminum is 
important, in spite of its low value.
Electronic equipment has such a wide variety of compositions and construc­
tions that a single generic recycling ﬂowsheet cannot be constructed. However, 
Figure 6.9 illustrates a ﬂowsheet including several common unit processes (Kumar 
et al., 2010). The ﬁrst step is dismantling, usually performed by hand. Dismantling

improves recovery of casings and structural parts, while minimizing contamina­
tion; since many of these parts are aluminum, it has particular importance here. It 
also increases the possibility for closed-loop recycling. However, dismantling is also 
labor intensive, and the parts that it recovers cannot be resold as in auto recycling. As 
electronic devices get smaller, the amount of metal to be recovered from dismantling 
declines as well (Stoklosa, 2011). As a result, electronics recyclers sometimes limit 
dismantling to recovery of materials that need to be recycled separately (batteries) or 
contain potentially hazardous components (lead, mercury).
Both hammer mills and knife shredders are used for comminution of electronic scrap. 
If disassembly is not performed, a hammer mill will be needed to reduce the metal content 
in the scrap. In some cases, a two-stage shredding system is used (Kang and Schoenung, 
2005). The goal is to minimize the generation of ﬁnes while at the same time liberating 
the plastic in the e-waste from the metal content. Air classiﬁcation separates the metal 
from the plastic, and ECS further puriﬁes the metal stream. HMS completes the process 
of separating a light-metal stream from the heavier metals (in particular copper). ISRI 
scrap grade EM-2 describes electronic scrap that has been processed to produce a pre­
dominantly aluminum nonferrous product (ISRI, 2012). Optical sorting may also play a 
role in the downstream sorting of shredded e-waste (Milton, 2010).

7 Melting Furnace 
Fundamentals
Most of the scrap aluminum recycled today is remelted in a furnace ﬁred with fossil 
fuels, most commonly natural gas. Furnaces of this type have been used since the 
recycling of aluminum began, and while the optimal design has changed, the funda­
mentals behind the melting of aluminum have not. Appreciation of these fundamen­
tals is important to understanding the reasons for the numerous furnace designs and 
equipment innovations that have taken place over the past 20 years.
HEAT-TRANSFER KINETICS
Figure 7.1 presents a simple view of a typical reverberatory (reverb) furnace for 
melting solid aluminum. The furnace is typically ﬁred with natural gas, causing 
heat to be transferred from the burner to the mixture of solid and/or molten alumi­
num in the hearth (furnace bottom) below. While much of the heat is transferred 
directly from the ﬂame to the metal, some is transferred to the metal by indirect 
transfer from the ﬂame to the refractory walls. The heat reverberates (bounces) 
off the walls and impinges on the aluminum in the hearth. Heat may bounce back 
and forth between the metal and the walls several times before it is absorbed 
by the metal, since aluminum reﬂects heat better than most metals. As a result, 
reverb furnaces feature shallow baths, maximizing the surface area per ton of 
contained metal.
Heat is transferred from the ﬂame to the metal by one of two means: radiation 
and convection, the direct contact of hot gas on the surface of the bath itself. Heat 
transfer by radiation is governed by the following expression (Jenkins, 2000):

where
qs	 is the rate of heat transfer, in watts per square meter of bath surface
A	 is the amount of the metal surface exposed per square meter of bath surface 
(one if the metal is molten, less if not)
σ	 is Planck’s constant (5.67·10−8 W/m2 K4)
ε	 is the emissivity of the aluminum in the hearth
Tg	 and Ts are the temperatures of the ﬂame and the solid aluminum, respectively
ε is extremely low for polished aluminum (~0.05); as the metal heats up and 
acquires a thicker oxide surface, ε increases to about 0.25 and higher for alloys 

124
Aluminum Recycling
(Chandler and Shull, 2009). A is increased by a thicker layer of solid scrap in the 
hearth and decreased by greater porosity (open space) in the scrap layer and by 
larger pieces of scrap in the charge. Equation 7.1 calculates only direct radiation 
heat-transfer rates, and not radiative heat transfer by reverberation. Equation 7.1 is 
also accurate only for surfaces directly facing the radiation source. For the surface 
not directly facing the radiation source, a view factor is used to calculate a reduced 
value of qs.
Figure 7.2, from the work of Furu et al. (2010), illustrates how higher values of 
ε can reduce the time required to heat solid aluminum. Another strategy for increas­
ing radiation heat transfer is increasing the freeboard above the melt (Lucas, 2012); 
increasing the thickness of the gas blanket in the furnace in turn increases reverbera­
tion off the walls and roof.
Because qs is a function of Tg
4, raising the ﬂame temperature is especially 
important in increasing heat-transfer rates by radiation. However, this has its 
drawbacks. Because surfaces directly facing the radiation source receive the 
most radiation, the metal nearest the ﬂame heats much more rapidly than metal 
farther away from the ﬂame. This causes overheating, which leads to excessive 
oxidation of the overheated metal. As a result, melt loss and dross formation are 
increased (Yap, 1995).

The rate of heat transfer by convection is also calculated by a simple expression:

(7.2)
where
qs	 is again the rate of heat transfer per unit area of bath surface
Tg	 and Ts are the temperatures of the gas above the surface and of the solid (or 
liquid) metals, respectively
h	 is a convection heat transfer coefﬁcient, determined by the composition, pres­
sure, temperature, and ﬂow characteristics of the gas; typical values for melt­
ing conditions are 10–30 W/m2-°C (Jenkins, 2000)
Higher pressures increase h, as does directing gas ﬂow at the metal rather than paral­
lel to it (Lucas, 2012). Convection heat transfer depends less on ﬂame temperature 
than radiation but is still promoted by higher temperatures. Because no single point 
source is involved, it is less likely to cause overheating than radiation. However, it 
is also less effective at heat transfer; most transfer in industrial furnaces occurs by 
radiation (Buchholz and Rødseth, 2011; Furu et al., 2012). In addition, the surface 
turbulence caused by the gas can break through dross layers, exposing fresh metal 
and increasing melt loss (Yap, 1995).
Figure 7.3, from the results of Furu et al. (2010), illustrates heat ﬂux rates by 
convection and radiation during natural gas heating of a solid aluminum surface. 
As time proceeds and the metal surface gets hotter, both rates decline; the decline 
of convection heat ﬂux is linear, as predicted by Equation 7.2. The decline of radia­
tion heat ﬂux is more complex, partially because of the changing value of ε as the

surface heats up. The relative importance of radiation as a heat-transfer mechanism 
increases with metal temperature (Lucas, 2012), suggesting that optimal burner 
operating conditions should change during the melting process.
Once heat is transferred to the surface of the metal, it is transferred away from the 
surface to the bulk of the aluminum. In molten metal, this is done partly by convec­
tion; in solid and molten metal, conduction plays a large role as well. The expression 
governing heat transfer by conduction per unit area of melt surface is

where
k is the thermal conductivity of the metal
L the depth of the melt (or thickness of the solid piece)
Tsur the temperature at the surface

The thermal conductivity of solid aluminum is twice that of liquid (Lucas, 2012), but 
this is reduced in scrap loads by the gaps between the charged pieces. (Aluminum 
alloys are less conductive than pure aluminum as well.) Aluminum has a high ther­
mal conductivity but that of dross is lower, and heat transfer through the dross layer 
can be a limiting factor in melting rates (Alchalabi et al., 2002; Lucas, 2012).
Because heat is constantly being transferred to the metal surface in a melting fur­
nace, the surface temperature will always be higher than that of the bulk. If conduc­
tion is the primary heat-transfer mechanism, the stratification in the molten metal 
that results can be severe (Alchalabi et al., 2002; Matsuzaki et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,

2010), with temperature differences between the top and bottom of the melt of 100°C 
or higher. As a result, increasing the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient h is impor­
tant. Since the temperature and composition of the metal are ﬁxed, stirring is the 
most effective method of increasing h. Figure 7.4 shows the impact of stirring on 
temperature stratiﬁcation in an aluminum melt; stirring also helps reduce composi­
tion stratiﬁcation, which can occur when higher-density alloying elements settle to 
the bottom of the melt. Several stirring devices are described in the next chapter with 
this in mind.
COMBUSTION
Most reverb furnaces burn natural gas to provide energy for melting. Natural gas 
consists mostly of methane (CH4), with some ethane (C2H6). Several other hydrocar­
bons and other gases are present in smaller concentrations; the composition varies 
from place to place. The overall combustion of natural gas reacts the hydrocarbons 
with oxygen to generate carbon dioxide and water vapor:
	
CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O (g)	
(7.4)
The energy produced by this reaction heats the product gases to a characteristic 
ﬂame temperature. The radiation from this ﬂame and the heat transfer from the prod­
uct gases to the metal by convection heat up and melt the scrap charge in the furnace.
Several characteristics of the ﬂame are adjustable. The most important is the 
ﬂame temperature. Normal air contains roughly 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. 
Nitrogen does not participate in the combustion reaction, but it does absorb much 
of the heat that combustion generates. As a result, with more gas to absorb the same

amount of energy, ﬂame temperatures are relatively low (<2000°C). When pure 
oxygen is mixed with air to create enriched air, the amount of nitrogen brought 
into the furnace decreases. With less nitrogen to adsorb heat, the ﬂame temperature 
can increase by several hundred degrees (Buchholz and Rødseth, 2011). In addition, 
eliminating the nitrogen increases the concentration of CO2 and H2O in the off-gas; 
this increases the emissivity of the gas, improving radiative heat transfer still further. 
The ﬂame temperature can also be increased by preheating the incoming air (Lucas, 
2012; Zhou et al., 2010).
High ﬂame temperatures have the advantage of increasing heat-transfer rates and 
improving furnace productivity (Buchholz and Rødseth, 2011). However, there are 
also disadvantages. The hot spot problem caused by excessive radiation heating is 
a problem at higher ﬂame temperatures (Yap, 1995). The higher temperature of the 
refractory furnace lining resulting from higher ﬂame temperatures also shortens its 
life. A bigger problem is unwelcome side reactions that are more likely to occur 
at ﬂame temperatures above 2000°C. The most troublesome are reactions between 
nitrogen and unreacted oxygen to form nitrogen oxides (Li et al., 2006):
	
N2 + O2 = 2NO	
(7.5)
	
N2 + 2O2 = 2NO2	
(7.6)
NO and NO2 are the main constituents of NOx, a signiﬁcant pollution concern. 
Reactions 7.5 and 7.6 become more feasible as the ﬂame temperature increases. 
However, lower partial pressures of N2 in the exhaust gas caused by the use of oxy­
gen-rich air act to reduce NOx generation. As the gas temperature decreases, NO 
and NO2 will decompose to N2 and O2 if given enough time. Staged combustion of 
natural gas helps to avoid hot spots and NOx formation (Nieckele et al., 2011).
If the amount of oxygen mixed with the fuel in the burner is not sufﬁcient to 
immediately burn the fuel, reaction 7.4 will happen by stages. The ﬁrst stage is 
pyrolysis of the fuel to generate hydrogen and small particles of soot (Wechsler and 
Gitman, 1990):
	
CH4 = C + 2H2	
(7.7)
The soot and hydrogen then react with more oxygen to produce carbon monoxide 
and water vapor:

(7.8)
The carbon monoxide then reacts with more O2 to combust completely to CO2. This 
reaction sequence is signiﬁcant because the soot increases the luminosity of the 
ﬂame (Solovjov and Webb, 2005), that is, its ability to radiate. Sootier ﬂames tend 
to be more spread out and radiate from a larger area. On the other hand, the slower 
reaction sequence tends to generate a lower ﬂame temperature.

129
Melting Furnace Fundamentals
One of the most signiﬁcant changes in the analysis of melting practice for alu­
minum scrap in the past 10 years is the use of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) 
to predict the impact of changes in process variables. Figure 7.5, from the work of 
Nieckele et al. (2011), demonstrates the value of CFD (Buchholz and Rødseth, 2011; 
Furu et al., 2010, 2012; Zhou et al., 2010). The two views show the wall temperature 
of a furnace being ﬁred from the left with natural gas (Figure 7.5a) and a generic 
liquid fuel oil (Figure 7.5b). The higher wall temperatures near the outlet produced 
by ﬁring with liquid fuel will shorten refractory life and result in uneven heating of 
aluminum in the furnace. CFD predicts a variety of things: the rate at which scrap 
placed in the furnace heats up, the temperature of the atmosphere in the furnace, 
heat loss through the furnace walls, the effect of changing furnace conﬁgurations 
and burner locations, the impact of using enriched air, and numerous other process 
variables (Matsuzaki et al., 2011; Murza et al., 2007). This promises to reduce devel­
opment costs and allow rapid response to changing conditions (scrap and fuel prices, 
new burner designs).
CHEMISTRY OF FLUXING
All aluminum scrap fed to a furnace has a very thin skin of aluminum oxide on the 
surface, caused by the spontaneous oxidation of aluminum in air (Foseco, 2002):

The skin grows very slowly at normal temperatures and so is usually not apparent 
on the surface. When the scrap is heated in a furnace, the higher temperatures cause 
the skin to grow more rapidly, especially if the scrap is heated in air or an oxidizing 
environment. The addition of magnesium to the alloy causes the oxidation reaction

Aluminum Recycling
to occur even faster and results in the production of spinel (MgAl2O4) as well as 
alumina (Eckert et al., 2005).
When the aluminum melts, the Al2O3 ﬂoats to the surface, forming a second 
phase known as dross. Because of the surface tension of the oxide skin, metallic 
aluminum is also trapped in the dross. The metal content of the dross can be any­
where from 40% to 80%, depending on melting conditions. While dross treatment 
processes recover most of this metal, at least some winds up being disposed of. As 
a result, reducing metal loss rates to the dross is an important consideration in scrap 
remelting (see Chapter 13).
One of the options available to remelters trying to reduce metal losses is to use 
a drossing flux designed to break the oxide skin and release the entrapped metal. 
Peterson (1990) lists the following requirements for such a ﬂux:
•	 Should cover the molten metal and limit further oxidation
•	 Should dissolve or suspend dirt, oxides, and other nonmetallic substances
•	 Should promote coalescence of the metal droplets in the dross by stripping 
away the Al2O3 layer
•	 Should have a melting point lower than that of aluminum (660°C)
•	 Should have a density less than that of molten aluminum (2.3 g/cm3)
•	 Should not react with or contaminate molten aluminum
•	 Should not attack furnace refractories
•	 Should be relatively nontoxic
•	 Should have a low vapor pressure
•	 Should not be overly hygroscopic (avoid adsorbing water)
•	 Should be inexpensive and/or easily recycled
•	 Should have a low viscosity
•	 Should separate cleanly from the metal
These requirements quickly reduce the list of available materials to a short list 
of chloride and ﬂuoride salts. Over time, a standard cover flux composition of 
50 wt.-% NaCl, 50% KCl (43.9 mol-% NaCl) has become commonplace (Bolivar 
and Friedrich, 2009; Peterson, 1990). Figure 7.6 shows the NaCl–KCl phase dia­
gram; a 50 wt.-% mixture has a liquidus temperature just above the eutectic tem­
perature of 657°C. (An equimolar ﬂux analyzing 56% KCl, 44% NaCl is also used.) 
However, while this ﬂux is effective at covering the metal, it is less effective at caus­
ing coalescence. Furnace operators have learned that adding small levels of ﬂuoride 
salt to the base cover ﬂux promotes coalescence and generates a dross with much 
less metal in it. The most popular ﬂuoride addition is cryolite (Na3AlF6), which is 
produced either synthetically or from used primary electrolysis cell bath (Bathco, 
2012; Foseco, 2002). Sodium aluminum tetraﬂuoride (SATF, NaAlF4) promotes 
coalescence even faster.
The reason why ﬂuoride additions are effective remains a matter of some dispute. 
Initially, it was held that added ﬂuoride increased the solubility of oxides in the 
drossing ﬂux (Foseco, 2002), including Al2O3, and that the oxide skins simply dis­
solved. Most recent evidence, illustrated in Figure 7.7, suggests a different scenario 
(Besson et al., 2011; Friesen et al., 1997; Zholnin and Novichkov, 2005). In this view, 

131
Melting Furnace Fundamentals
the changing shape of the aluminum in a droplet as it melts causes the oxide skin to 
crack. Molten ﬂux penetrating the cracks makes contact with the molten droplet. It 
has been shown that ﬂuoride additions (particularly Na3AlF6, NaF, and KF) greatly 
reduce the surface tension of molten ﬂux on molten aluminum (Ho and Sahai, 1990), 
which causes the ﬂux to spread out along the droplet surface. As this happens, the 
remnants of the oxide skin separate from the metal, freeing it to combine with other 
droplets as they come into contact. The exact mechanism may depend on the com­
position of alloy being melted.
A second way of encouraging coalescence is to heat the dross layer. A speciﬁc 
category of exothermic drossing ﬂuxes has been developed that contains an oxidiz­
ing agent such as KNO3, Na2CO3, and K2SO4, among others (Foseco, 2002). These

react with the liquid aluminum in the dross layer, producing Al2O3 and heating the 
dross. Whether they work as advertised is controversial.
Several other considerations affect the composition of cover and drossing ﬂuxes. 
It has been shown that adding some ﬂuorides to ﬂux tends to encourage reaction 
between sodium in the ﬂux and the molten aluminum (Zholnin et al., 2005). This 
raises the sodium content of the metal, possibly to levels greater than allowed (see 
Chapter 12). Using AlF3 as the ﬂuoride source prevents this, but this is expensive. 
Another consequence of adding ﬂuorides is the potential formation of undesirable 
ﬂuoride dust emissions at higher temperatures (Foseco, 2002). In addition to work­
place hygiene concerns, these emissions pose a risk to electric melting furnaces. 
A third consideration in recent years has been a dramatic increase in the price of 
KCl, which is used in fertilizers (Bolivar and Friedrich, 2009). Prices rose 250% 
between 2005 and 2008; they have since declined, but the vulnerability of the 
recycling industry to future price shocks has encouraged the development of low-
potassium ﬂuxes like the 70NaCl:30KCl mixture common in Europe.
Even with the best ﬂuxing practice, some oxidation of the metal surface is bound 
to occur during the melting process. The dross limits heat transfer and thus slows 
melt rates. It also creates a risk of dross inclusions winding up in the molten metal 
and hurting product quality. As a result, preventing dross formation is an important 
characteristic of the melting process. Several dross prevention techniques will be 
described later in the book; one controversial technique is the addition of 0.0005–
0.002 wt.-% (5–20 wppm) of beryllium (Eckert et al., 2005). The BeO layer that 
results from this is particularly effective at passivating the molten metal underneath. 
This is especially useful for Mg-containing alloys such as the 2000, 5000, and 7000 
series. However, beryllium is a carcinogen and a workplace hygiene challenge, and 
its use is being voluntarily phased out by some producers. Its use is speciﬁcally 
avoided in the production of aluminum alloys for use in food packaging.
REFRACTORY INTERACTIONS
Although the demands on refractories in aluminum melting and holding furnaces are 
not as severe as those in other molten-metal processes, there are still some requirements:
•	 Lack of reactivity with the molten aluminum
•	 Low solubility in molten ﬂux
•	 Lack of reactivity with the Al2O3 in the dross
•	 Low thermal conductivity
•	 Hydration resistance (important, since the atmosphere above the melt has a 
high water-vapor content from the combustion of the fuel)
•	 Oxidation resistance
•	 Stability at temperatures up to 1200°C (or higher if oxygen-enriched air is 
used in the burners)
•	 Good mechanical strength (important given the repeated loading of the fur­
nace with solid scrap)
Of course, the most signiﬁcant requirement is low cost.

133
Melting Furnace Fundamentals
The combination of these requirements eliminates most of the available refrac­
tory compositions. Of the remaining choices, those which have by far become 
the most popular for melting and holding furnaces are refractories based on the 
alumina–silica system. Figure 7.8 illustrates the system, which features the ter­
nary compound mullite (Al6Si2O13) in addition to pure corundum (Al2O3) and silica 
(SiO2). The refractories used in contact with molten metal and dross in aluminum 
melting and holding furnaces have a high alumina content (60%–85% Al2O3) and 
typically consist mostly of a mixture of corundum and mullite. However, there are 
variations in composition (CaO is often added to these refractories) and miner­
alogy (aluminosilicate refractories often contain signiﬁcant levels of free silica). 
Recent developments in refractory composition and selection will be described in 
the next chapter.
The biggest concern in refractory use in molten aluminum is corrosion, especially 
at the melt line or bellyband. Corrosion results from the reaction between the molten 
aluminum and the refractory to generate corundum and elemental silicon (Guo et al., 
2004; Yurkov and Pikhutin, 2009):

corundum (Koshy et al., 2008), which prevents further access of the metal to the 
refractory underneath and stops the reaction. The surface layer is less adherent when 
the molten alloy contains higher levels of zinc or magnesium, and refractory cor­
rosion is a greater concern in these conditions (Drouzy and Richard, 1974). Higher 
silica concentration in the refractory increases the reaction rate and thus the degree 
of corrosion.
At the bellyband, conditions are different, due to higher temperatures and the 
presence of oxygen in the adjacent furnace environment. As molten metal penetrates 
into the pores of the refractory, the oxygen reacts directly with the aluminum to form 
corundum (Allaire and Guermazi, 2000). The higher temperatures at the bellyband 
cause the reaction to occur even more quickly, and the porosity of the refractory 
allows the metal to migrate upward through the brick, forming corundum at loca­
tions above the melt line. The result is a corundum deposit large enough to reduce 
furnace capacity and adherent enough to take some of the original refractory with 
it when mechanically removed during cleaning (Raju, 2003). Wall-cleaning fluxes 
contain compounds such as sodium ﬂuosilicate (Na2SiF6) and cryolite that react with 
the corundum and soften the deposit so that it can be scraped clean (Foseco, 2002).
A common practice in refractory development has been the addition of nonwet­
ting agents to retard the interaction of the metal with the refractory (Koshy et al., 
2008). Barite (BaSO4), ﬂuorspar (CaF2), wollastonite (CaSiO3), and aluminum 
ﬂuoride (AlF3) have all been used; boron-containing compounds also show prom­
ise (Adabiﬁroozjaei et al., 2012). The additives work by reacting with the refrac­
tory and the molten aluminum to generate multiple oxide phases such as anorthite 
(CaAl2Si2O8), hexacelsian (BaAl2Si2O8), and aluminum borate (Al18B4O33), which 
reduce metal penetration into the refractory (Yurkov and Pikhutin, 2009); the 
reduced refractory loss justiﬁes the cost of the additives. Wollastonite appears to be 
particularly helpful at reducing bellyband corrosion (Allaire and Guermazi, 2000).

8 Melting Furnace Parts 
and Accessories
As the next chapter will show, there are numerous designs of gas-ﬁred melting fur­
naces for scrap aluminum. However, these furnaces have many parts in common. 
Advances in the design of these parts affect all types of furnace. These advances 
include the creation of accessories—equipment that is attached to the main body of 
the furnace, either for occasional or semicontinuous use. The purpose of these parts 
and accessories is to meet a common goal—melting aluminum scrap in the shortest 
possible time, with the highest possible efﬁciency and the lowest possible melt loss.
CHARGING AND PREHEATING
The traditional means of charging scrap to a reverb uses a front-end loader and an 
open furnace door (Magarotto, 2009; Williams, 2008). The method is simple, robust, 
and uncomplicated. However, it also exposes the furnace refractories to cold air (and 
thermal shock), causes damage to both the doors and the furnace as the front-end 
loader makes contact with it, and is a safety risk to the operator of the vehicle. The 
ﬁrst step to improving this is replacing the front-end loader with a remote charging 
machine that removes the operator from the cab. Figure 8.1 shows such a vehicle, 
typically rail mounted (Emes, 2001). Several types are available; the choice of model 
depends on the type of scrap being charged. The machine can also be designed to 
extend all the way into the furnace so that scrap is dumped into the back as well as 
the front of the furnace cavity.
The next step forward is a vibratory feeder that acts as a buffer between the batch 
charging device and the furnace (Gillespie + Powers, Inc., 2003). These feeders 
are not inexpensive, but steady-state feeding and minimized thermal shock reduce 
refractory costs. Steady-state feeding also makes it possible to reduce the size of the 
doors, which reduces heat loss and improves workplace hygiene. The feed rate can 
potentially be controlled by the temperature of the melt (Grayson, 2011; Houghton 
et al., 2008), which minimizes temperature excursions and provides a slight improve­
ment in productivity. Vibratory feeders are most often used for feeding small scrap 
such as auto shred or UBC.
Chapter 14 details the safety concerns associated with melting aluminum scrap, 
in particular explosions caused by wet or oily scrap. Some melting furnaces (see 
Chapter 9) make it possible to preheat scrap before melting, driving off the volatiles. 
For other melting furnaces (in particular wet-hearth and rotary furnaces), preheating 
scrap in a separate oven is a desirable option (Migchielsen and de Groot, 2006). These 
ovens are generally a simple arrangement, ﬁred with natural gas (waste heat from 
the melting furnace can be used as a supplement). Depending on the type of scrap, 

138

preheating temperatures as high as 500°C are used. If the scrap has a small level of oil 
or coatings, these preheating ovens can take the place of a decoating furnace.
BURNERS
The developers of improved burners try to meet several goals, some of which are at 
odds with each other:
•	 Improving thermal efﬁciency, which is lower than 30% for many furnaces
•	 Decreasing fuel costs
•	 Increasing the rate of heat transfer to the charge, which increases furnace 
productivity
•	 Decreasing melt loss
•	 Increasing refractory life, particularly at or above the melt line
•	 Decreasing emissions of pollutants, particularly NOx, without generating 
excessive soot
Many new designs have been proposed. Some of the more important trends in burner 
design and operation are described in the following:
Use of oxygen: The difﬁculties caused by the 79% nitrogen in air were described 
in the previous chapter. The biggest of these difﬁculties is the heat lost in the nitrogen 
when it goes up the stack, which represents wasted energy and money (Kobayashi 
and Tsiava, 2003). High nitrogen content in the furnace atmosphere also increases 
the size of the ductwork needed to contain it and reduces ﬂame temperatures, which

Melting Furnace Parts and Accessories
can be undesirable in some furnaces. As a result, some furnace operators now enrich 
their combustion air by adding oxygen. Figure 8.2 illustrates the impact of oxygen 
enrichment on ﬂame temperature (D’Ettorre et al., 2007). As the previous chap­
ter pointed out, hotter ﬂames transfer heat more quickly to the metal underneath, 
improving productivity. The reduced nitrogen throughput of oxygen-enriched com­
bustion means less heat lost in the nitrogen and thus higher efﬁciency; fuel savings of 
30% or more can be achieved. Figure 8.3 illustrates another consequence of oxygen 
enrichment, higher ﬂame velocity (Abernathy et al., 1996). As the previous chapter 
pointed out, heat transfer by convection is increased by higher gas turbulence. This

is especially useful when heating solid aluminum. Figure 8.4 shows how much faster 
a 600 mm aluminum cube melts in hot gas ﬂowing at a faster rate.
Potesser et al. (2008) describe four methods of using oxygen in burners for alu­
minum melting furnaces. The most common is oxyfuel burners that use pure O2 and 
eliminate the use of air entirely. These nearly eliminate the presence of nitrogen 
in the system, minimizing off-gas volume and maximizing efﬁciency. However, the 
ﬂame temperatures produced by these burners are too high, which increases dross 
formation and reduces refractory life (D’Ettorre et al., 2007). To solve this, some 
of the off-gas is recycled and mixed with the oxygen and natural gas. This low­
ers the ﬂame temperature and spreads out the ﬂame, providing heat transfer over a 
wider area. In recent years, this has given rise to flameless combustion (Gripenberg 
et al., 2007, 2012), in which the ﬂame is so diffuse as to be largely invisible. The 
lack of N2 in the off-gas increases the concentration of CO2 and H2O; these have 
higher emissivities than diatomic gases such as O2 and N2, and this increases the heat 
transfer by radiation. The lower temperature resulting from the wider distribution 
of the ﬂame minimizes NOx formation, and the higher fuel efﬁciency reduces CO2 
emissions, as seen in Figure 8.5 (Niehoff, 2009). Recycling off-gas also addresses 
another problem of using pure oxygen: the lower furnace pressure that results from 
the reduced amount of combustion product. This lower pressure can cause furnaces 
to leak, admitting nitrogen to the system and leading to NOx generation (Jepson and 
van Kampen, 2005).
However, using pure oxygen costs money, while air is free. As a result, some 
burner designs have focused on ways to achieve the beneﬁts of oxygen enrichment 
while using less of it. Burners that mix pure oxygen with air at varying levels of 
enrichment can achieve most of the beneﬁts of oxyfuel burners while spending much 
less money on oxygen (D’Ettorre et al., 2007; Jepson and van Kampen, 2005; White, 
2006). The input of nitrogen from the air means that off-gas volumes are larger, but 
the capital requirements for recirculation of ﬂue gas are eliminated. NOx emissions 
can be kept low if the O2 content of the air is kept below 50% (Potesser et al., 2008).

To some degree, oxygen enrichment competes with regeneration (see below) as 
a device for reducing fuel requirements (White, 2006). Installation of oxyfuel or 
oxygen-enriched burners has a lower capital cost (Potesser et al., 2008), but the cost 
of oxygen makes this technology difﬁcult to justify. As natural-gas prices decline, 
the economic return on oxyfuel burners or oxygen enrichment for aluminum melting 
furnaces declines as well.
Regeneration: Regeneration is a technique for heat recovery from the combus­
tion off-gases, introduced to the secondary aluminum industry in the 1980s. Figure 
8.6 illustrates the principle behind regenerative burners (Anon., 2009; Costa and 
Whipple, 2003). In this case, burners are mounted at opposite ends of the furnace. 
Each burner features a regeneration bed, comprised of a nonreactive ceramic (usually 
alumina balls, 2–3 cm diameter). When the burner at the left is in operation, exhaust 
gas is drawn through the regeneration bed at the right. The bed absorbs heat from 
the exhaust gas, heating up in the process. Every minute or so, the burner at the left 
is shut down and the one at the right ﬁred up. When this happens, combustion air is 
drawn through the heated regeneration bed. The air is preheated by the bed, which 
loses a small amount of its energy in the process. At the same time, the regenera­
tion bed at the left is opened to receive exhaust gas and is slightly heated up in turn. 
Another minute later, the left burner becomes operational again, and the process is 
repeated.
By preheating the air, regeneration increases ﬂame temperatures, improving fur­
nace productivity. Furthermore, the recovery of heat from the off-gas means that less 
heat is lost from the furnace; this decreases fuel costs by 40%–45% (Anon., 2009; 
Costa and Whipple, 2003). Because the impact of regeneration is similar to that of

oxygen enrichment, the two techniques are rarely used at the same time. Regeneration 
also presents the same potential disadvantages as oxygen enrichment—higher melt 
loss, greater refractory wear, and high NOx generation (Schalles, 1998). Similar to 
oxygen enrichment, recirculation of ﬂue gases helps mitigate these concerns. An 
additional problem in furnaces that use ﬂux is the tendency of the ﬂux to form dust 
or vapor, which condenses in the regenerator. As a result, periodically the regenera­
tors must be shut down for cleaning. This involves removing the ceramic media, dis­
carding the contaminated material, and screening the rest to remove particulates and 
condensed dust. Furnaces using ﬂux use larger alumina balls because of this.
Flame manipulation: Furnace operators have learned that different types of ﬂame 
are desired at different points during the melting process. For example, during the 
early stages of melting, the low emissivity of metallic aluminum makes heat transfer 
by radiation difﬁcult. A ﬂame that transfers more energy by convection is desirable. 
After the metal is molten, the dross layer on top absorbs more radiation; in addition, 
the disturbance of the dross layer by turbulent exhaust gas increases melt loss. As a 
result, a ﬂame with better radiation characteristics is preferred (Migchielsen and de 
Groot, 2005). In addition, a ﬂame that radiates from an area rather than a single point 
will reduce the overheating of both metal and refractory.
In response to this, burner manufacturers have developed designs that manipulate 
ﬂames in several ways (Abernathy et al., 1996; Costa and Whipple, 2003; Dentella 
and Zucca, 2011; Migchielsen and de Groot, 2005). A popular manipulation is the 
flat flame, in which the ﬂame is spread out over some width, rather than an axisym­
metrical cone. The staged introduction of air or fuel helps spread out the ﬂame over 
an area, rather than a single location (Schalles, 1998). The staged introduction of air 
also encourages incomplete initial combustion of the fuel. This results in pyrolysis, 
as described in the previous chapter. The soot created by the pyrolysis makes the 
ﬂame more luminous, encouraging heat transfer by radiation. Increasing the fuel and 
air velocity helps generate a long ﬂame, which reduces overheating.

In addition to manipulating the size and shape of the ﬂame, it is now increasingly 
possible to manipulate the direction of the ﬂame (D’Ettorre et al., 2007; Migchielsen 
et al., 2010; Migchielsen and de Groot, 2005). This is useful in melting scrap, since 
the location of the piles of metal in a furnace can change from load to load. As the 
pile melts, changing the direction of the ﬂame as well as the length becomes useful 
in reducing dross generation as well as producing even heating (Lucas, 2012). CFD 
analysis discussed in the previous chapter has become a useful tool for determining 
the optimal location for burners as well as how ﬁring characteristics should change 
with time. Online analysis of the off-gas temperature and pressure is also commonly 
used to automatically control burner input and ﬁring rate (Costa and Whipple, 2003; 
Hamers, 2007; Houghton et al., 2008). In some cases, the off-gas oxygen content is 
also analyzed for burner control (Migchielsen and de Groot, 2005).
RECUPERATORS
Recuperators perform a similar function to regenerators, in that they recover heat from 
the furnace exhaust gas and use it to preheat the combustion air. The main differences 
between the two are that (1) recuperators are a separate piece of equipment, rather 
than the integral part of the burner shown in Figure 8.6, and (2) recuperators operate 
on a steady-state basis, instead of the semicontinuous operation of regenerators.
Figure 8.7 illustrates a typical convection-type recuperator (Lucas, 2012). As the 
name suggests, the primary method of heat transfer in these devices is by convec­
tion from the hot exhaust to the surface of the metal tubes through which cold com­
bustion air is input. Further, convection heat transfer from the inside surface of the 
tubes heats the combustion air. High-temperature Ni–Cr–Fe–Co alloys are used for 
tubes, largely to resist the corrosive nature of the off-gas (Gorog et al., 2007; Haynes 
International, 2008). However, the use of salt ﬂuxes in melting furnaces creates prob­
lems in recuperators (Jepson and van Kampen, 2005), since halide vapors given off 
by the molten salt corrode even these alloys at high temperatures. As a result, the 
combustion air cannot be preheated above 350°C–400°C. This minimizes the pos­
sible fuel savings to about 20%. Recuperators have other disadvantages compared 
with regenerators. Their size per amount of heat recovered is large, and materials 
failure is a common problem. In addition, dust and condensing salt vapor frequently 
clog the tubes, requiring shutdowns. As a result, they are rarely used in new fur­
nace installations, although they have some value in small batch melting furnaces 
(Nabertherm, 2012).
REFRACTORIES
The challenges to refractory performance in aluminum melting and holding furnaces 
were described in the previous chapter. Responses vary from operator to operator, 
but some trends are apparent:
•	 A shift away from bricks toward monolithic linings (Cölle and Schiffbauer, 
2012; Houghton et al., 2008; Whiteley, 2011). These are cheaper to install 
and have no joints to penetrate. However, monolithic linings do not have 

144
Aluminum Recycling
the same mechanical strength as bricks and so are more easily damaged 
when the charge is dumped into the furnace. Figure 8.8, the internal struc­
ture of a generic stationary melting furnace (Wynn et al., 2011b), shows the 
areas of refractory use. The hearth and ramp are the most frequent cause of 
shutdowns, due to mechanical damage, abrasion, and thermal shock dur­
ing loading of cold scrap. As a result, bricks are still used in large furnaces 
subjected to heavy loading (Decker, 2011), such as round furnaces (see 
next chapter). In areas above the melt line, alkali attack from ﬂux dust and 
vapor is a cause for concern (Wynn et al., 2011a). The development of low-
cement castables and gunning mix has been especially signiﬁcant (Carden 
and Brewster, 2008). Over the past 10 years, the use of precast sections (big 
blocks) has become more popular (Jones and Taberham, 2008; Pyrotek, 
2005). These cost more and require longer lead times than castable linings, 
but precasting allows for more consistent curing, reduces downtime, and 
increases the range of available refractory compositions.
•	 The use of nonwetting agents in linings to limit metal penetration (Cölle and 
Schiffbauer, 2012). Barium sulfate is the most common of these; ­calcium 
ﬂuoride is often used as well (Hemrick et al., 2008). The effectiveness of

these agents tends to decrease at melt temperatures above 1100°C (Bonadia 
et al., 2006). Silicon carbide is also a useful antiwetting addition, but 
increases the thermal conductivity of the refractory.
•	 Higher quality refractory. Eliminating silica fume is especially important 
for reducing corundum formation (Hemrick et al., 2008). However, this is 
difﬁcult, since the silica is needed to ensure ﬂowability in castable mixes. 
Efforts to replace the silica with kyanite are continuing.
•	 Composite refractory walls such as that in Figure 8.9 (Morrow, 2003), 
with a corrosion-resistant refractory at the hot face and a low-density 
insulating material underneath to reduce heat losses. It is important to 
make sure that the high-temperature refractory is thick enough that the 
freeze plane below which penetrating metal solidiﬁes remains within it 
(Migchielsen et al., 2010). Insulating brick is less resistant to molten metal

and should not be exposed to it. Furthermore, if molten metal penetrates 
beyond the thickness of the facing refractory, the lining can heave up 
from the wall or bottom as the metal freezes between the facing refrac­
tory and insulating material. In areas not exposed to molten metal such 
as the doors, roof, and upper walls, this is less of a concern, and the lin­
ing can be chosen with insulating qualities more in mind (White, 2006; 
Whiteley, 2011).
STIRRING
The term stirring encompasses a wide range of technologies, often designed for 
speciﬁc furnace architectures. Stirring is meant to accomplish one or more of 
several goals (Bright et al., 2007a; Campbell, 2010; Guest et al., 2012; Henderson 
et al., 1996):
•	 Elimination of thermal gradients: Because heat is transferred to the charge 
in a melting furnace entirely from the top, the temperature of the melt at the 
top can be up to 100°C higher than that at the bottom. Thermal gradients 
lead to excessive dross formation and melt loss (the metal is too hot at the 
top), variable chemistry, and problems with casting when metal of varying 
temperatures is tapped. Stirring evens out the metal temperature, improv­
ing product quality and reducing melt loss. It also reduces the temperature 
at the metal surface, which in turn lowers refractory temperatures above the 
melt and reduces refractory wear.
•	 Submergence of light scrap: Light scrap such as UBCs or foil tends to 
ﬂoat on top of molten metal when charged. Leaving it there leads to exces­
sive melt loss, so submerging it under the melt as quickly as possible is 
important.
•	 Elimination of inclusions: While good quality control in cast shops now 
requires ﬁltration, the larger inclusions in molten aluminum can be elimi­
nated beforehand either by ﬂotation on bubbles of introduced argon or by 
attachment to the furnace walls. Stirring makes this easier to accomplish.
•	 Higher melt rate: Stirring increases the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient h, 
improving heat transfer from the top of the melt to the metal or scrap below. 
This increases melt rates by 20% or more compared to unstirred furnaces.
The numerous devices used for stirring molten metal can be separated into four basic 
types of device: bubble injection, mechanical pumps, electromagnetic pumps, and 
electromagnetic stirrers.
Bubble injection is accomplished in one of two ways: through a porous plug in 
the furnace bottom (Migchielsen et al., 2010) or through a lance or ﬂuxing wand 
inserted through the top. The bubbles are argon or an argon–chlorine mixture and 
are injected primarily for degassing or ﬂuxing rather for stirring. Recently intro­
duced rotary ﬂux injectors are more effective for stirring but again are primarily 
meant for other purposes (see Chapter 12).

Melting Furnace Parts and Accessories
Most of the mechanical pumps in use for molten aluminum service are cen­
trifugal (see Figure 8.10) rather than positive displacement, due to the higher 
discharge volumes and velocities of centrifugal designs. These pumps cost less 
per unit capacity than other stirring devices and cost less to operate as well 
(Henderson et al., 1996); maintenance costs are higher, but development work 
has focused on improving their reliability (Bright et al., 2007b; Chandler, 2006). 
Mechanical pumps are often portable and can be used on more than one furnace. 
The newest pumps can circulate 20,000 kg/min of molten aluminum, with less 
turbulence than previous lower-capacity designs. Centrifugal pumps are usually 
used only on open-well furnaces, however; closed-system furnaces require a dif­
ferent type of stirrer. They also have difﬁculty in furnaces where metal drains 
away from the pump as the furnace is emptied and so are less desirable for round 
and dry-hearth furnaces. Nevertheless, their low cost and simplicity of operation 
make them a competitive option.
Figure 8.11 illustrates the operating principle behind the electromagnetic pump, 
introduced to the aluminum industry about 15 years ago (EMP Technologies, 2005; 
Henderson et al., 1996; Peel, 2003). The equipment consists of a well, lined with 
the same high-alumina refractories used for the furnace itself, and the pump itself, 
wrapped around a silicon carbide inlet tube. The pump consists of a coil wrapped 
around the tube, through which mains-frequency alternating current ﬂows; the 
forces exerted on the metal in the tube are the same as those described for the eddy

current separator in Chapter 6. In this case, exerting this type of force on molten 
metal causes it to ﬂow through the tube. (The same principle is behind the operation 
of induction furnaces, described in Chapter 10.) Electromagnetic pumps are more 
expensive to install but are more effective than mechanical pumps in stationary melt­
ers, reduce operating costs, and are much easier to maintain (EMP Technologies, 
2007; Pyrotek, 2005). As a result, they are the primary choice for new installations.
Electromagnetic stirrers use a similar principle to the induction furnaces used 
for melting (see Chapter 10). Mounted externally to the furnace, they consist of an 
iron core adjacent to a set of water-cooled stirrer coils (Peel, 2003). AC electric cur­
rent passed through the stirrer coils generates a magnetic ﬁeld, which in turn gener­
ates a secondary electric current in the molten metal in the furnace. As the current 
oscillates, the changing magnetic ﬁeld in the metal generates eddy currents, which 
stir the metal. As with induction furnaces, low frequencies generate better depth of 
penetration of the magnetic ﬁeld, allowing use of refractories of normal thickness. 
Electromagnetic stirrers can be mounted either under the furnace, as shown in Figure 
8.12, or to the side. Side-mounted stirrers are the typical choice for retroﬁtted fur­
naces. To allow the magnetic ﬁeld to penetrate into the furnace, the carbon steel 
shell of the furnace is replaced by a window of nonmagnetic austenitic stainless steel 
where the stirrer is located (Stål and Hanley, 2009). A bath height of at least 0.33 m 
is recommended.
Electromagnetic stirrers are more effective than any other stirring device, which 
maximizes the gains in productivity and product quality that can be achieved. As 
a result, their use has spread rapidly over the past decade, as shown in Figure 8.13

(Peel and Herbert, 2010). Recent innovations include the use of solid copper induc­
tors, rather than hollow copper coil; this eliminates the need for water cooling. The 
use of side-mounted stirrers as an alternative for pumps in vortex and sidewell fur­
naces has also been demonstrated (Guest et al., 2012). These operate at lower fre­
quencies (5–10 Hz), producing better magnetic ﬁeld depth and producing better 
results with less power use. Questions about worker-safety impacts of the electro­
magnetic ﬁeld generated by the stirrer are a concern, as is the relatively high cost 
of these devices. However, their advantages promise to make them an increasingly 
common part of the melting-furnace landscape.
ROAD CRUCIBLES
As Chapter 11 points out, it is common for aluminum recycling operations to be 
located near their customers. Because of this, some recyclers have begun the practice 
of shipping aluminum to their customers in molten form, using specially designed

road crucibles such as that shown in Figure 8.14 (Peterson and Blagg, 2000). These 
crucibles hold 8–10 tons of molten metal and are transported up to 300 km. Keeping 
the metal molten saves the customer the cost and time of remelting it, which more 
than makes up for the additional cost of transporting it in molten form (Bonadia 
et al., 2006).
The crucible is drained either by pouring from the top, tapping through a plug 
in the bottom, or using a siphon (Peterson and Blagg, 2000). The choice depends 
largely on the customer’s available equipment. As the distances over which molten 
metal is shipped increase, means of heating the metal to keep warm increasingly 
go along for the ride. Both electric and gas-ﬁred portable heating units are avail­
able; the gas-ﬁred units seem to be more economical (Prillhofer and Knaack, 2012). 
When crucibles arrive at their destination, temperature stratiﬁcation has often set 
in; bottom-mounted electromagnetic stirrers can be used for these vessels as well as 
stationary furnaces (Stål and Hanley, 2009).
ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT
Reverberatory furnaces can emit a variety of interesting substances when melt­
ing aluminum scrap. The most signiﬁcant of these are chloride gases and vapors. 
Scrap that has not been decoated often contains chlorinated polymer coatings, 
such as PVC. Furthermore, the salt used for ﬂuxing is a KCl–NaCl mixture and 
gives off vapors of its own when molten. Improperly combusted fuel is a potential 
source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and may react with chloride vapors 
to generate chlorinated organic vapor compounds such as furans or dioxins (see 
Chapter 14). Along with this, scrap charging often generates dust that must be 
dealt with.

Figure 8.15 shows a typical baghouse used to ﬁlter the cooled off-gas (Bundy 
Environmental Technology, 2008; CECO Environmental, 2010; Merz, 2004). The 
bags are large fabric ﬁlters, capable of removing micron-size dust particles from fur­
nace exhaust gas. Polyesters are typically used for the fabric in aluminum remelting 
plants, due to their resistance to the HCl in the exhaust gas. However, their relatively 
low limiting operation temperature requires that gases be diluted with air to cool 
them below this temperature before being ﬁltered. The bags are often coated with 
lime, to help recover chlorides in the off-gas. Nomex or other aramid ﬁbers are used 
as the fabric for higher-temperature gases; these cost more than polyester, but the 
lower volume of off-gas that requires ﬁltering when diluted air is not used reduces 
the required bag size and thus the cost.

9 Fossil-Fuel Furnaces
The reverberatory furnace used to melt aluminum scrap has numerous designs and 
sizes, and new designs appear on a regular basis. However, new furnaces are expen­
sive, and so many older designs are still widely used. The goal of furnace design is 
consistent, however: to generate the highest melting capacity per unit volume, while 
maximizing thermal efﬁciency to reduce fuel costs. Other considerations include the 
ability of the furnace to handle ﬁnely divided scrap without excessive melt loss, the 
ability to process coated scrap if prior decoating is unavailable, minimizing mainte­
nance costs, and ease of charging and tapping.
There are a number of ways to classify furnace designs. This chapter will sepa­
rate them into single-chamber and multiple-chamber types. Additional sections at 
the back will describe two specialized types of gas-ﬁred furnace: the rotary and 
crucible furnace. For more complete description of furnace designs, the reader is 
encouraged to read the review by Schmitz (2006).
SINGLE-CHAMBER DESIGNS 
(KEARNEY, 1988; SCHAEFER FURNACES, 2008)
The wet-hearth furnace described in the previous edition of this book has become 
largely obsolete, for reasons described by Newman (2010). As a result, the most com­
mon type of single-chamber furnace is the dry-hearth furnace shown in Figure 9.1. 
This furnace features a sloping hearth on the right onto which solid scrap is placed 
for initial heating. As the metal melts, it drains down the hearth into the bath on the 
left, leaving other metallic materials behind (Boeckenhauer and Kaczmarczyk, 2008; 
Kennedy, 2001). The scrap also dries during the heating process, reducing the pos­
sibility of explosions and also reducing the potential for melt loss from the interaction 
between the metal and water vapor. When the molten metal reaches the desired tem­
perature, it is either pumped out or tapped from a hole in the side. Burners are mounted 
in the opposite end of the furnace from the charge door; mounting the ﬂue near the 
charge door gives hot combustion gases more chance to transfer energy to the melt as 
they head toward the ﬂue. Burners can be roof or side mounted; for larger-capacity fur­
naces, regenerative burners or the use of preheated air is advantageous (Valder, 2011). 
Without the use of stirring or other melting aids, melt rates of 200 kg/h-m2 are typical.
Metal removal from dry-hearth and other furnaces is accomplished one of three 
ways. The use of a hydraulic pump is the oldest (Brooks, 1970) and is used mostly 
for furnaces that are not integrated into a melting/holding/casting line. However, 
the pumps require maintenance and periodic replacement, and safety is a concern. 
Electromagnetic pumps were described in the previous chapter as a means of stirring 
the melt; these can also be used to transfer molten metal from the furnace and are 
increasingly used for that purpose (EMP Technologies, 2007; Starczewski, 2012). 

158
Aluminum Recycling
These pumps require a certain level of molten metal in the furnace to operate and so 
cannot be used to completely drain the vessel.
A more common tapping approach for reverbs requires a hole drilled through the 
furnace side and ﬁlled with a quick-setting mortar plug or tap cone. When the molten 
metal is ready to tap, the plug is removed and replaced by a tap that allows metal to 
drain into a launder or transfer ladle. When the furnace is mostly empty, a new plug 
or cone is mortared into place. Tapping can be slow, especially toward the end of the 
tap when molten metal levels in the furnace are low. Furthermore, the plug material 
can be a source of inclusions in the metal.
The newest tapping approach involves tilting the entire furnace up, causing metal 
to drain through a pouring spout located at the front. Tilting has a signiﬁcant power 
requirement, and costs more than tapping arrangements. As a result, it is rarely used 
for large melting furnaces. At the same time, it offers greater control of drainage rate 
than tapping and reduced inclusion content in the metal. Because of this, furnaces 
that tip are increasingly chosen for new installations, especially for rotary and hold­
ing furnaces (Barry et al., 2009; Emes, 2001).
An early improvement in furnace design was the development of designs with wide 
charging doors, allowing much larger loads to be placed in the furnace than before. 
However, charging furnaces this way is slow. The next step was the design of a round 
melting furnace (Boeckenhauer and Kaczmarczyk, 2008; Moos and Thanoukos, 
2009), which features side burners and a removable top. Removing the entire top (see 
Figure 9.2) allows the furnace to be charged with fewer bucket loads of scrap. This 
can reduce charging times by up to 80%, which keeps the furnace refractories from

getting cold. The reduced number of charging steps also improves safety by reducing 
worker exposure to the furnace environment. Round furnaces are easier to seal than 
other furnace types and typically have higher melting rates per unit area.
Dry-hearth furnaces solve many of the problems associated with wet-hearth melt­
ing (Newman, 2010). A particular advantage is the reduction in melt loss caused by 
the use of different types of ﬂame over the solid scrap and the metal bath. Convective 
ﬂames are used in the dry-hearth area to maximize heat transfer to the solid scrap; 
ﬂat luminous ﬂames work better to heat the molten metal. As a result, dry-hearth 
furnaces are the most popular approach for melting large or bulky scrap.
However, dry-hearth furnaces also have limitations. Refractories in the elevated 
portion of the hearth are more prone to breakage by the solid scrap being dumped 
on them without a cushion. The lack of intimate contact between combustion gases 
and the charge means that thermal efﬁciencies are still low (30%–35%). Scrap size is 
still a limitation as well, since smaller scrap piled on the hearth is less likely to stay 
there. Melt loss can be higher than 10%, particularly for thin scrap (Grayson, 2012).
The next step in the progression is the stack melter shown in Figure 9.3. Here 
scrap is input directly into the exhaust stack, forcing the exhaust gas to go through 
the scrap as it leaves the furnace. As the heated scrap descends to the sloping hearth, 
additional burners melt it, causing it to ﬂow into the molten bath. This in turn allows 
more scrap to descend to the hearth, creating a semicontinuous melting operation.
Stack melting has several advantages over traditional single-chamber melting 
(Kendzora, 2000; Kennedy, 2001). The most signiﬁcant is improved efﬁciency. With 
most of the heat removed from the exhaust gas (exit temperatures are reduced to 500°C 
or less), energy savings of 30%–50% or more are common (White, 2011). The preheating

of the scrap by the exhaust gas also reduces melting time on the hearth, improving fur­
nace productivity. The elimination of the open charging well reduces melt loss by 80% 
or more and minimizes emissions. Stack melting is not suitable for very large scrap, but 
a stack can be combined with a dry hearth to accommodate a range of charge materials. 
These advantages often justify the additional investment required for a stack melter.
Although a considerable improvement over simpler single-chamber furnaces, stack 
melting has a few disadvantages of its own. The foremost is controllability; scrap 
descends as quickly as it melts, which makes slowing down the melting rate difﬁcult. 
The pressure of the scrap on the stack limits the depth to which it can be stacked, and 
this in turn limits the length of time that it can be preheated. Uneven heating is also a 
concern if the charged scrap has a range of sizes. The solution introduced in the early 
1970s was the tower melter. The tower through which exhaust gas ﬂows consists of 
several chambers separated by cast iron bars. Scrap is introduced into the top cham­
ber while melting is completed in the furnace hearth below. When metal is tapped 
from the furnace, the bars on each chamber are sequentially released, and the scrap 
falls into the next chamber. Very large scrap can be charged directly onto the dry 
hearth in the main furnace chamber as needed. The design allows a greater amount 
of scrap to be held in the column, improving heat recovery and ultimately furnace 
efﬁciency (values of 60%–77% are claimed). The lack of direct contact between the 
ﬂame and the scrap also helps reduce melt loss. Figure 9.4 shows the latest version of 
the Ecomelt furnace (Niedermair, 2009, 2011), in which furnace off-gas fed through 
the tower decoats high-organic scrap. The gas coming out of the tower is then burned 
to provide supplemental heat to the system. The Ecomelt includes a separate melting 
chamber similar to the sidewell furnace, along with electromagnetic pumps to circu­
late metal (see previous chapter). This allows processing of high-organic scrap and 
other materials that would normally be shunned by remelters.

Fossil-Fuel Furnaces
However, tower melters have higher capital costs than other furnaces, and the 
number of moving parts is a potential maintenance headache. The footprint of stack 
and tower melters is also substantial, and this makes it difﬁcult to ﬁt them into exist­
ing shop ﬂoors. As a result, the use of tower melting furnaces is uncommon and 
largely limited to smaller melting operations.
MULTIPLE-CHAMBER FURNACES
Figure 9.5 illustrates the sidewell melting furnace, which has been used for several 
decades for the melting of light scrap (Feese and Lesin, 2009). The sidewell furnace 
was designed to eliminate direct interaction between combustion gases and solid scrap, 
which increased melt loss and dross generation. Instead, only the molten metal in the 
clean chamber on the left is heated, using high-luminosity ﬂames (see previous chapter).

The superheated molten metal ﬂows underneath a bafﬂe and contacts solid scrap charged 
to the sidewell, heating and ultimately melting it. When the charge is melted, the molten 
metal is then reheated to pouring temperature, tapped, and the process is repeated.
Sidewell furnaces are an effective way to melt light scrap such as UBCs with 
minimal melt loss. However, improvements have been desired ever since their intro­
duction. Because no preheating of scrap is provided, fuel efﬁciencies are poor. The 
use of tactics such as regeneration or air enrichment to improve efﬁciency has been 
a common response (Stewart, 2002). A bigger problem has been the slow kinetics 
of melting (Migchielsen and Gräb, 2007), limited by the rate at which metal can 
ﬂow under the bafﬂe to contact the scrap in the well. The metal pumping devices 
described in the previous chapter were designed largely to improve metal ﬂow rates 
around the bafﬂe and increase melting rates (Henderson et al., 2001). Both mechani­
cal and electromagnetic pumps are widely used.
Even though the sidewell furnace prevents direct exposure of the scrap to combus­
tion ﬂames, the ﬁnely divided material oxidizes sufﬁciently during heating to gener­
ate a signiﬁcant amount of dross. Until the 1990s, the only response to this was to use 
salt as a ﬂux (Foseco, 2002), which minimized metal loss to the dross but generated 
an environmentally undesirable waste product. As a result, a means was sought to 
submerge the pieces of scrap in the molten metal in the sidewell while they melted, 
which would minimize oxidization of the scrap and eliminate the need for ﬂuxing. 
Figure 9.6 illustrates a vortex system (Iribarren, 2008; Pyrotek, 2005; Starczewski, 
2012). Furnaces using this approach have an additional chamber into which molten 
metal is pumped at high velocity. The design of the chamber causes the molten metal 
to form a vortex, in which small pieces of scrap (chips, UBC shreds, wire chops) are 
FIGURE 9.6  LOTUSS (Low Turbulence Scrap Submergence) system. (From Metaullics 
Systems, http://www.metaullics.com/lotuss.html. With permission.)

fed. Output from the vortex goes to the sidewell, where it ﬁnishes melting before 
moving back to the main chamber. Devices of this type have been available for over 
30 years and have been adopted worldwide. Recent improvements have allowed this 
approach to be used in larger furnaces and have increased melt capacity.
The problem of melting small scrap becomes greater if coating material and other 
organics are still present when the material is charged. For scrap of a consistent type 
(such as UBCs), a preliminary decoating step (see Chapter 5) is justiﬁed, but mixed 
scrap loads are often charged directly to the melting furnace without prior decoat­
ing. This leads to higher melt losses, as carbon and oxygen in the coatings react 
with the aluminum to generate alumina and aluminum carbide. The gases given off 
by decomposing coatings are also an environmental concern. Figure 9.7 presents a 
solution to this: the twin-chamber furnace developed in Germany (Migchielsen and

Gräb, 2007; Valder, 2011). The furnace features a scrap chamber, which is effectively 
an enlarged sidewell, and a heating chamber where molten metal is superheated. 
An electromagnetic pump circulates metal between the two chambers; regenerating 
burners improve thermal efﬁciency. The most signiﬁcant advance in the furnace is 
a recirculating ﬂue gas circuit, in which gases given off by decomposing coatings 
are burned to recover additional energy and minimize emissions. Temperatures at 
the top of the scrap chamber are controlled at 500°C to maximize pyrolysis rates. 
The nonoxidizing atmosphere in the furnace helps minimize melt loss, and this in 
turn allows operation without salt. If the quality of the scrap supply is inconsistent 
enough, these furnaces are a good choice for environmentally viable melting. Scrap 
with up to 6% contamination can be successfully processed. For a steady supply of 
coated scrap, separate decoaters are a more competitive choice.
SMALL-VOLUME MELTERS
The furnaces described in the previous sections are used primarily for large volume 
applications (>1000 kg/h melt rate). For smaller-volume melting operations, mini­
mizing capital outlay becomes increasingly important, even at the expense of energy 
efﬁciency. Smaller-volume melters must also be easily operated on an on–off basis, 
rather than the steady-state operations used by larger melting operations. This means 
that a furnace with a smaller thermal mass is desirable, as is one that can be com­
pletely emptied and started up cold. Electric furnaces (see Chapter 10) are often used 
for applications of this type, but gas-ﬁred furnaces are also used where electricity 
is too expensive. The small size of these furnaces means that liquid fuels (fuel oil, 
diesel, LPG) are sometimes used instead of natural gas.
Fossil-fuel crucible furnaces are available in stationary or tilting models 
(Nabertherm, 2012); stationary furnaces can have either removable or ﬁxed (bale-
out) crucibles. Melting rates are usually <0.5 ton/h, and fuel efﬁciencies less than 
20%. A small dry-hearth melter has also been developed, useful for melting wet or 
oily scrap (Thermtronix, 2009).
ROTARY FURNACES
For highly oxidized scrap or dross, the use of ﬂux during melting is a requirement. 
Separating the resulting salt slag from the metal is difﬁcult without sufﬁcient agita­
tion. To deal with this problem, the tilting rotary furnace (TRF) shown in Figure 
9.8 was developed. The rotary furnace is a sloping tube, tilted back for charging and 
ﬁring and tilted forward for slag and molten metal discharge. Firing occurs at the 
bottom (Maiwald, 2009; Zhou et al., 2006), using natural gas or occasionally fuel 
oil. As the hot exhaust gas travels upward through the furnace, it passes through 
the charge, improving efﬁciency and reducing melting times. The gas also heats 
the refractory walls of the furnace; this allows heating of the charge by conduction 
from the walls as the furnace rotates (Jepson and van Kampen, 2005), as well as by 
radiation and convection. When the contents have reached the desired temperature, 
the furnace is tilted and the metal and salt slag are separately poured off. Rotation of 
the furnace is slow during the early stages of the melting process to prevent damage 

165
Fossil-Fuel Furnaces
to the refractories from large pieces of scrap or dross; as a molten pool begins to 
form, the speed is increased to roughly 7–8 m/s at the inner surface. Melting times 
vary with furnace size and loading but are usually shorter than in a comparable wet-
hearth furnace.
Rotary furnaces are faster and more efﬁcient than ordinary reverberatory furnaces 
(Paitoni and Benedini, 2004). Because they are emptied completely after each tap, 
they are more suitable than stationary furnaces for aluminum producers who change 
alloys frequently (Boeckenhauer and Kaczmarczyk, 2008). However, they are also 
more expensive to install per unit capacity and more difﬁcult to maintain; labor costs 
are also higher. The need for salt also presents challenges, because salt mixtures with 
a lower melting point than that of the metal feature high levels of expensive KCl. As a 
result, TRFs are generally best suited for melting dross and other oxidized scrap (see 
Chapter 13) and for smaller-size scrap like UBCs (Hall, 2008). However, the smallest 
material, such as clean punchings and turnings, are now better suited to a vortexing 
furnace, where they can be melted in a salt-free environment.
HOLDING AND DOSING FURNACES
In smaller melting facilities, molten metal tapped from a melting furnace is usually 
transferred to a ladle prior to casting. Larger facilities often employ a holding fur­
nace (Whipple, 2005), where the temperature and composition of the metal can be 
adjusted. This allows the melting furnace to be used mostly for its intended purpose, 
increasing productivity. The use of a holding furnace also makes it possible to operate

the melting furnace under conditions that most favor heating of solid scrap (reducing 
conditions, convective heat transfer), improving the efﬁciency and melting rate.
Many different holding furnaces are available, and both gas-ﬁred and electric fur­
naces are widely used (Butler, 2006; Nabertherm, 2012; Schaefer, 2008). Figure 9.9 
illustrates a well-known concept in gas-ﬁred holding furnaces: a radiant-tube fur­
nace (Flamme et al., 2011; Wunning, 2002). In this furnace, products of combus­
tion are passed through ceramic tubes mounted in the furnace; as the tubes heat 
up, they radiate energy to the molten metal below. The use of a tube separates the 
combustion gases from the metal, limiting oxidation and disturbance and reducing 
melt loss. Electrical resistance elements mounted in the roof have the same effect. 
Reverberatory furnaces operating under luminous ﬂame conditions are less expen­
sive and are also common.

10 Electric Furnace Melting
As illustrated in previous chapters, most aluminum scrap is melted in furnaces 
heated by the combustion of a fossil fuel—natural gas, oil, or perhaps coal. However, 
the use of fossil fuels as an energy source has disadvantages (Butler, 2006):
•	 Poor fuel efﬁciency
•	 Required ventilation to handle the combustion products
•	 Dross generation from the interaction of combustion products with the mol­
ten metal
•	 Melt contamination from the interaction of combustion products with the 
molten metal
•	 High surface temperature in the metal, which encourages hydrogen 
absorption
•	 Refractory degradation in the roof and sidewalls
•	 Metal contamination from entrained dross circulated by metal pumps and 
electromagnetic stirring
Electricity has been used as an alternate energy source for melting aluminum scrap 
for some time. The ﬁrst electric furnace for melting scrap was installed in the United 
States in 1918 (Anderson, 1987) and appeared in Europe soon afterward. These fur­
naces have been in use ever since and have evolved over time. The most important 
innovation was the introduction of induction furnaces for melting in the 1930s. These 
have largely displaced the resistance and arc furnaces originally used.
Electric furnaces have important advantages over fossil-fuel furnaces for 
melting aluminum scrap. The most important of these is cleaner metal. Because 
there are no combustion products in an electric furnace environment, dross gen­
eration is much less in an electric furnace (Lessiter, 1997), as is gas pickup. As 
a result, melt losses are lower (Groteke, 1997; Hentschel and Feldmann, 1982; 
Kreysa, 1991; MacIntosh, 1983), and metal purity is improved. The stirring 
motion of an induction furnace minimizes temperature gradients within the melt 
(Heine and Gorss, 1991), improving consistency. Electric furnaces are generally 
more efﬁcient than gas- or oil-ﬁred furnaces (Fishman, 2002; Schifo and Radia, 
2004), especially in smaller sizes. The lack of fuel combustion means that there 
is little or no off-gas, which greatly reduces environmental concerns. In addition, 
electric furnaces are less noisy.
However, there are also disadvantages. The stirring motion that improves 
homogeneity can also prevent dross from separating, increasing the risk of inclu­
sions (Whiteley, 2011). While electric furnaces are more efﬁcient, electricity is 
often a more expensive form of energy than fossil fuels, erasing the cost advantage 
(Fishman, 2002; Nealon, 2011); recent declines in the price of natural gas have made 

170
Aluminum Recycling
electricity an even less desirable option. Electric furnaces tend to have higher capital 
costs than fossil-fuel furnaces of equivalent capacity (Hellsing and Tallbäck, 1982; 
MacIntosh, 1983). Most importantly, electric furnaces have difﬁculty matching the 
melting capacity of large-scale reverberatory furnaces (Butler, 2006; Groteke, 1997).
As a result, electric furnaces are most often found in small-volume operations 
such as foundries. Less than 5% of the total aluminum melted in the United States 
is melted in electric furnaces (Schifo and Radia, 2004). However, changing environ­
mental restrictions and the need to produce cleaner metal in a melting furnace may 
encourage greater use of electric furnaces in the future.
The electric furnaces used in aluminum melting can be classiﬁed in several ways. 
The most important is the type of electrical heat generation, which is by induction 
or resistance. Induction furnaces can be further divided into channel and coreless 
units. A second means of classiﬁcation is the function of the furnace. Some electric 
furnaces operate as melting units, others as holding furnaces, and some as both. 
The choice of frequency is another means of classifying electric furnaces, as is the 
means by which molten metal is removed (in a separate crucible, by hand-dipping, 
or by being tapped to a ladle). In this chapter, electric furnaces will be sorted ﬁrst 
into induction and resistance furnaces and then by the other classiﬁcation methods.
INDUCTION FURNACES
In Chapter 5, the concept of an eddy current was introduced as a technology for 
separating aluminum from other nonmagnetic metals in a scrap stream. An eddy 
current is the electric current induced in a conductor by the magnetic ﬁeld associ­
ated with an adjacent magnet or electric current. In an eddy current separator, pow­
erful permanent magnets are typically used to generate this ﬁeld. Passing a piece of 
scrap over a series of magnets with alternating polarities generates Lorentz forces, 
which repeatedly ﬂip the piece of scrap and cause it to veer from its original path.
If the scrap piece (or any other conductor) remains in the magnetic ﬁeld generated 
by alternating current for a period of time, its resistance to the reversing eddy current 
generated by the ﬁeld will cause it to heat up. This is called induction heating and is 
used for several metallurgical applications. The industrial use of induction heating for 
melting purposes dates from the 1930s (Robiette, 1972), and today is used for most 
nonferrous metals, as well as irons and steels. Two general approaches have been taken 
in the design of induction-based melting furnaces. In the ﬁrst, solid metal is directly 
heated and melted by eddy currents in a coreless furnace. In the second, molten metal 
is heated to a high temperature in the bottom of a channel induction furnace; the super­
heated molten metal then melts added scrap or ingot charged to the top of the furnace.

Figure 10.1 shows the construction of a typical coreless induction furnace (Bala, 
2005; Perkul, 2008). The induction coil surrounding the outside of the lining 
containing the metal charge consists of water-cooled copper tubing, embedded in

a ceramic grout to reduce corrosion and provide additional support. In furnaces 
with removable crucibles, the coil will reach nearly to the top of the furnace. 
In tiltable furnaces like that shown here, room is left for a pouring spout. The 
magnetic ﬁeld generated by the coil is equally strong on both sides; to prevent 
the stray ﬂux from heating the outer furnace shell, a series of vertical laminations 
of transformer iron known collectively as the yoke is located outside the coil. 
In addition to tiltable furnaces like this, coreless induction furnaces are avail­
able that can be tapped from the bottom, along with removable crucible furnaces 
(Lessiter, 1997).
The biggest decision in specifying a coreless induction furnace is the choice 
of operating frequency. Until the 1970s, there was no such choice; virtually all 
coreless units operated at mains frequency, 50–60 Hz. This had several conse­
quences. The ﬁrst stems from the impact of furnace frequency on the penetration 
depth of the magnetic ﬁeld. Robiette (1972) describes penetration depth using 
the expression

where
p is the penetration depth in cm
ρ is the resistance of the conductor affected by the ﬁeld (i.e., the furnace charge)
μ is the magnetic permeability of the conductor
f is the frequency
For a given material, p is proportional to 1/f 0.5. The high penetration of mains 
­frequency means that a large-diameter furnace is required to eliminate bucking 
or canceling of the ﬁeld (Hipple, 1982). However, practical considerations lim­
ited the coil diameter to a maximum of 3.65 m outer diameter (Heine and Gorss, 
1991; Knödler, 1986). As a result, mains frequency induction furnaces often have 
lower efﬁciencies, especially during melting when the resistance of the charge 
is greater (and p is higher as a result). Furthermore, Knödler suggests that the 
minimum size of aluminum scrap (or ingot) that can be efﬁciently melted in a 
coreless furnace is 3.5p. This means that the use of mains-frequency induction 
furnaces for melting is best reserved to ingot and large-diameter scrap such as 
casting runners and gating.
A second consequence of mains-frequency furnace operation is the impact of 
frequency on stirring action in the melt. Shuichi (1988) calculates stirring action 
with the expression
	
F
P
fDH
= a
	
(10.2)
where
α is a constant determined by the metal being melted
P is the power input to the furnace
D is the inside crucible diameter
H is the coil height
Lower frequencies mean increased stirring. This stirring theoretically makes it 
easier to melt thin-gauge scrap (Perkul, 2008), by rapidly drawing the scrap under 
the melt surface. However, stirring is also more likely to hurt metal quality, by 
increasing melt contact with the atmosphere and increasing hydrogen absorption. 
The increased stirring also raises the height of the meniscus or the dome of mol­
ten metal that forms above the melt. A meniscus that gets too high can result in 
metal spillage. Preventing this requires (a) turning down the power (and reduc­
ing furnace melt capacity) or (b) increasing the distance by which the crucible 
wall extends above the coil, which creates thermal gradients within the melt. As 
a result, the use of mains-frequency coreless induction furnaces for melting scrap 
is not widespread. When used for this purpose, they are generally operated with a 
hot heel of molten metal (Smith and Hayes, 1992), to which scrap is added. This 
reduces the resistance of the charge and allows the stirring action to transfer heat 
to the solid scrap more effectively.
In the 1970s, the development of solid-state frequency converters (thyris­
torized or oscillating circuit) made possible medium-frequency (150–600 Hz) 

173
Electric Furnace Melting
furnace operation (Knödler, 1986). Medium-frequency operation reduces the pen­
etration depth generated by the coil, compared with mains-frequency operation. 
Higher frequency operation also decreases the stirring and thus the meniscus 
height. This in turn increases the power density that can be used for a furnace of 
a given size (Goyal, 1985), as Figure 10.2 illustrates. This power increase means 
reduced melting times for a given charge, and the reduction in furnace size made 
possible by the medium-frequency operation reduces capital costs and improves 
efﬁciency (Hipple, 1982). The reduced stirring and shorter melting times translate 
into lower melt losses than mains-frequency melting, and the reduced penetration 
depth means that smaller pieces of scrap can be melted (Kreysa, 1991). Another 
advantage of medium-frequency melting is that a cold charge can be melted more 
easily, while mains-frequency furnaces generally use a molten heel (Heine and 
Gorss, 1991).
The optimal frequency of coreless induction furnace to be used for melting 
scrap depends on the capacity, the size of material to be melted, and equip­
ment and electricity costs. Figure 10.3 shows an approach suggested by Hipple 
(1982); the greater the capacity (and the larger the furnace), the lower the fre­
quency. A second approach can be obtained from the work of Rowan (1987), 
who published a frequency selection chart, based on experience with a variety of 
foundries. The published chart recommends an optimum frequency for a given 
furnace capacity, with a margin of uncertainty called the green zone. The pub­
lished chart is primarily for ferrous melting furnaces but can be adapted for 
frequency recommendation for aluminum melting as well. From Rowan’s results, 
the following expression can be obtained:

where
y is the optimal frequency
x is the capacity of the furnace in kg
For a furnace with a capacity of 3000 lb (1361 kg), the recommended frequency from 
the expression would be 324 Hz, at the low end of what Figure 10.3 suggests. A fur­
nace with a capacity of 8000 lb (3629 kg) would have a recommended frequency of 
111 Hz, well below that suggested by Hipple (1982).
Figure 10.4 shows a common power supply schematic for medium-frequency fur­
naces (Perkul, 2008). The equipment shown here is a parallel inverter, in which 
the capacitor bank is connected in parallel with the induction coil; series inverters 
are also used. The lack of tap changes and capacitor contactors means that supply 
line surges do not occur, which pleases power companies; it also means reduced 
maintenance costs. For furnaces with power ratings above 1250 kW, a step-down 
transformer is normally used; smaller furnaces are more likely to use a 480 V dis­
tribution line backed by a disconnecting device. Power supply functions are increas­
ingly automated, using programmable controllers and software packages that can 
specify appropriate sequences for different types of furnace operation (cold start vs. 
hot start, different types of metal input, batch vs. tap-to-tap, etc.).
Coreless induction furnaces are operated in one of two basic methods (Perkul, 
2008). The ﬁrst is a batch operation, in which the furnace is completely emptied

after every heat. The second is a tap-and-charge operation, in which the fur­
nace is operated semicontinuously, with about 50% of its contents removed after 
each heat. The more consistent temperature of a tap-and-charge operation ensures 
longer refractory life; however, batch operation has a higher electrical efﬁciency 
(Kreysa, 1991). While tap-to-tap times are longer in batch melting, the frequency 
of tapping is reduced, ultimately maximizing furnace utilization. In addition, the 
ability to operate medium-frequency coreless furnaces with a completely solid 
charge means that some oily or wet scrap can be used in batch operation, as long 
as no liquid heel is left after tapping. (The oil and water are vaporized during 
heatup.) This practice remains undesirable, however, and it is recommended that 
the fraction of wet scrap in a charge be limited to one-ﬁfth or less of the total 
(Groteke, 1997).

Charging frequency depends on the type of operation (batch or tap-and-charge) 
and the furnace size and frequency. The lower melt capacity of mains-frequency 
coreless furnaces means that they need to be charged less often; the appetite of 
medium-frequency furnaces is such that a continuous charging device may be appro­
priate (Groteke, 1997; Kreysa, 1991; Perkul, 2008). The size of solid pieces charged 
to a coreless unit should be less than two-thirds of the furnace diameter to prevent 
bridging.
A peculiar concern in the operation of coreless furnaces is the disposition of 
dross. Ordinarily, dross from aluminum melting furnaces rises to the top, where it is 
skimmed off. However, the stirring in coreless units draws dross down instead into 
the melt (Smith and Hayes, 1992). As the metal circulates, the dross agglomerates on 
the furnace walls (Goyal, 1985). This poses several concerns. The ﬁrst is refractory 
penetration (Shuichi, 1988). The dross contains small amount of entrapped metal, 
which will become superheated when trapped near the crucible wall (where the mag­
netic ﬁeld from the coil is strongest). The superheated metal penetrates refractories 
easily, shortening lining life (Whiteley, 2011). A second problem is the increase of 
lining thickness resulting from dross adsorption. This reduces power input to the 
melt. A third possible concern is dross being eroded from these side deposits by cir­
culating metal and ultimately winding up in the metal. Special mechanical scrapers 
have been designed to periodically remove the deposited dross without disturbing 
the molten metal surface (Perkul, 2008).
CHAnnEL FURnACEs
Figure 10.5 illustrates the basic construction of a channel induction furnace (Perkul, 
2008). As before, a water-cooled copper-tubing coil is used to generate a magnetic 
ﬁeld, which heats the metal in the channel surrounding the coil. However, there are 
several differences. The most signiﬁcant is that the channel is placed outside the 
coil, whereas the metal in a coreless induction furnace is placed inside the coil. To 
redirect the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the coil to act entirely on the metal in the 
channel, an iron core is placed inside the coil. This serves the same function as the 
iron yoke placed outside the coil in a coreless unit.
A bigger difference between the channel and coreless induction furnaces is that 
the amount of metal in the channel surrounding the coil is much smaller than the 
amount of metal being acted on by the ﬁeld in a coreless unit. As a result, channel 
furnaces heat metal by an indirect method. Metal ﬂowing through the channel is 
superheated by the ﬁeld and moved along by the same forces that cause bath cir­
culation in coreless units. As the superheated metal exits the channel into the main 
body of the furnace, it transfers heat to the rest of the melt. (This can be seen as an 
electric-furnace analog to sidewell melting furnaces heated by fossil-fuel combus­
tion.) Scrap or ingot fed to the furnace is melted by this indirect approach, rather than 
going through the channel.
Nearly all channel furnaces operate on mains frequency. Because of this, 
the power density is limited, making the direct melting of scrap impossible. 
This in turn means that a heel of molten metal must be maintained in the fur­
nace (Perkul, 2008). This reduces furnace flexibility and makes alloy changes 

177
Electric Furnace Melting
difficult. As a result, channel furnaces are used more often as holding fur­
naces rather than as melting units and typically for larger operations. However, 
for these applications, channel furnaces have advantages. Their efficiency is 
typically 70%–75%, compared with the 50%–55% efficiencies of coreless fur­
naces (Knödler, 1986). A second advantage is the reduced agitation in channel 
furnaces. This minimizes dross formation compared with coreless units and 
reduces gas pickup. However, the reduced turbulence also makes it more dif­
ficult to charge low-bulk scrap, such as cans, shredded material, and trimmings 
(Kreysa, 1991). These materials must be baled or otherwise densified before 
charging to reduce melt loss.
Until the early 1980s, a second limitation on channel furnace capacity was the 
induction coil itself, which was air cooled (Hellsing and Tällback, 1982; Knödler, 
1986). This limited inductors to power ratings of 250 kW and less. Even so, induc­
tor failure is a frequent problem with these furnaces (Whiteley, 2011). The devel­
opment of water-cooled inductors allowed power ratings to increase to 1000 kW 
or higher. Using multiple induction loops on a given furnace also increases fur­
nace capability. However, this comes at a price; channel furnaces are more expen­
sive per unit melting capacity than coreless units (and much more expensive than 
fossil-fuel furnaces).
The biggest operating concern in the use of channel furnaces is the rapid metal 
ﬂow through the channel, which can lead to two opposing difﬁculties. The ﬁrst is 
rapid wear of the refractory lining of the channel (Hellsing and Tallbäck, 1982;

Hentschel and Feldmann, 1982; MacIntosh, 1983), which causes the need for replace­
ment at a more frequent rate than coreless units. The second is the deposition of dross 
on the refractory surface, similar to the deposition of dross on the crucible walls of 
coreless furnaces. This dross can build up over time and clog the channel (Whiteley, 
2011), forcing the furnace to be taken out of service while the clog is removed. 
Solutions to the clogging problem include increasing the metal ﬂow rate through the 
channel, which reduces dross deposition, and injecting an inert gas (argon or nitro­
gen) into the channel (Prillhofer, 2011). Both of these tactics increase the refractory 
wear rate, however. The problem is less severe in larger furnaces, which have wider 
channels and are less prone to clogging as a result.
RESISTANCE FURNACES
Electric resistance furnaces feature a wire element looped throughout the sides of the 
furnace. When current is passed through the wire, its resistance generates heat, rais­
ing its temperature. Eventually, the element temperature rises to the point where it 
glows. The glowing element radiates heat to the surroundings, including the crucible 
placed inside the furnace. This heats the metal inside or keeps it warm if already 
molten. Changing the current to the element changes the power generated, allowing 
temperature control.
The element in most resistance furnaces is made of the nickel–chromium alloy 
nichrome. The chromium in this alloy forms an impervious oxide layer when the 
element is used. The oxide layer prevents further oxidation and allows the element 
to be used for an extended period of time before replacement is required. The ele­
ment is often installed as an open-coil element supported on high-purity ceramic 
tubes; elements can also be obtained semi-embedded in refractory panels (Atkins, 
1992), which are simply swapped out when the element fails. Open-coil elements 
are preferred for aluminum melting, due to the higher power loading (and increased 
melt rate) possible with this type; however, improved semi-embedded elements are 
available that may eliminate this advantage.
Resistance furnaces generally belong to one of two categories: small-crucible 
bale-out furnaces and radiant-heat electric reverberatory holding furnaces and 
tundishes (Atkins, 1989; Butler, 2006; Morganite Crucible Ltd., 2006; Nabertherm, 
2012; Schaefer, 2008). The capacity of the bale-out furnaces can be as high at 
1500 kg but is usually much smaller. They can be operated with a molten heel but 
are usually charged cold. Efﬁciencies are high (80%), but the low power input means 
that melting capacity is poor compared to other furnaces. Because no stirring is 
provided by these furnaces, only bulky scrap can be used (along with primary ingot) 
in furnaces of this type. The lack of stirring also increases temperature gradients in 
the metal, which increases melt loss compared with induction furnaces (Puga et al., 
2009). Crucibles are usually made from silicon carbide, which is preferred over clay–
graphite because of its higher thermal conductivity.
Electric reverberatory furnaces (see Figure 10.6) are used as holding furnaces 
(Atkins, 1989; Butler, 2006; Morganite Crucible Ltd., 2006; Schaefer, 2008). They typi­
cally feature silicon carbide elements embedded into the furnace roof and can hold up to 

179
Electric Furnace Melting
6000 kg of molten metal, although they are usually much smaller. The high reﬂectivity 
of molten aluminum means that a large bath surface is required for effective heating, 
and this in turn increases the potential for dross formation and hydrogen pickup during 
holding. As a result, use of these furnaces is limited.
Attempts have been made to overcome the disadvantages of resistance-heated 
furnaces. One of the more promising is a hybrid furnace that uses fossil-fuel heating 
for charge heating and melting and resistance heating for heating and holding the 
molten metal (Kanthal, 2009). This improves melting capacity, while preserving the 
electric heating advantages of cleaner metal and reduced gas pickup. A second is 
the direct heat concept (Chubu Electric Power Co., 2011; Free Library, 2012), which 
uses an induction coil to heat a silicon carbide crucible. The high resistivity of the 
crucible causes it to heat rapidly, heating the metal inside. Because the induction ﬁeld 
is applied to the crucible rather than the metal, the stirring action of other coreless 
induction furnaces is avoided, reducing drossing and gas pickup.
Figure 10.7 shows a third alternative, developed over the past decade by an 
American consortium (Eckert, 2004). The ﬁgure shows a high-ﬂux resistance heater 
mounted inside a ceramic tube. The resistance heater features a newly developed 
resistive material that has a higher melting point and better ﬂexibility than previous 
options and a glass amalgam to provide better heat transfer. This heater is immersed 
into molten aluminum, where it transfers heat by conduction and convection rather 
than by radiation. Figure 10.8 shows a melting furnace arrangement that takes 
advantage of this technology. The furnace is the electric equivalent of a sidewell 
reverberatory furnace, with molten aluminum superheated by an array of immersion 
heaters being used to melt solid feed input to the charge well on the left (Osborne, 
2010). However, the use of electric furnaces for large-scale melting of scrap is likely 
to remain the less preferred option for some time to come.

11 Recycling Industry
Some of the information in this chapter will be out of date before you read it. The 
recycling industry is constantly changing, and the number of facilities processing 
aluminum scrap or dross grows or shrinks with time in different locations due to 
several factors. As a result, some recyclers counted in this chapter are now defunct, 
and new ones have begun operations since this was written.
Secondary aluminum is a commodity material, and the driving forces that inﬂu­
ence other commodity processors also inﬂuence the aluminum recycling industry. 
Most of these forces are rationalizing the industry, resulting in fewer but larger pro­
cessing facilities. The changing nature of the scrap supply also affects which recy­
cling facilities will thrive, as does the shifting geography of demand for aluminum.
WHO RECYCLES ALUMINUM?
As mentioned in Chapter 1, much of the aluminum scrap recycled is actually con­
sumed by primary aluminum smelters rather than by scrap processors (Scharf–
Bergmann, 2008). Primary smelters use scrap because of the following reasons:
•	 It is a cheap source of aluminum. In countries with high power costs 
and distant bauxite resources, the cost of purchasing and remelting scrap 
may be less than that of producing aluminum from ore (Koscielski, 2010; 
Wilkinson, 2003). As a result, a primary smelter can lower its costs by 
remelting as much scrap as possible. (Of course, the entry of primary smelt­
ers into the market can drive scrap prices up, reducing this advantage.) In 
countries with lower power costs or nearby bauxite resources, this factor 
becomes less important.
•	 It is a cheap source of alloying elements. As Chapter 2 pointed out, most 
aluminum alloys contain one or more of ﬁve alloying elements: copper, 
magnesium, manganese, silicon, and zinc. As the prices of these metals 
increase (silicon has been particularly expensive at times), the alloy content 
of scrap is increasingly valuable (Gaustad et al., 2007).
•	 It reduces power usage and emissions associated with primary smelting. 
Primary aluminum smelters consume substantial amounts of electrical 
energy and are often the biggest electricity consumers in a region. As other 
consumers in the region increase the demand for power, reducing power use 
in smelters is a net contribution to the available supply. In addition, many 
industrial societies have committed themselves to reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions to the atmosphere. As Chapter 1 pointed out, the CO2 emitted 
during the recycling of aluminum is 90% less than that created during pri­
mary production (Damgaard et al., 2009; Das, 2006).

184
Aluminum Recycling
However, because primary smelters produce primarily wrought alloys and are not 
equipped to do substantial amounts of demagging, they are selective about the scrap 
they buy. New scrap with a known composition is vital; uncoated material is also 
needed, since primary smelters have different environmental equipment than sec­
ondary smelters and may not be able to adequately handle the organic vapors gen­
erated by decomposing coatings. As a result, primary smelters in developed areas 
with large scrap markets are more likely to use scrap than smelters in less-developed 
regions.
Some primary smelters in North America and Europe have also begun to pro­
duce casting alloys such as A356.0 (Grunspan, 2004; Rombach, 2002). The low iron 
content of primary aluminum makes it easier for these smelters to produce low-iron 
casting alloys, and the presence of nearby customers such as auto producers provides 
a further economic advantage. The production of cast rather than wrought alloys also 
means greater consumption of scrap, since these compositions can absorb more in 
the charge.
The second category of recycling operation is the remelter. Like primary smelt­
ers, remelters also produce mostly wrought alloys (Kevorkijan, 2003; Kirchner, 
2002), meaning that careful selection of scrap grades and chemistries is essential. 
Again, remelters use mostly new scrap, with some added primary metal to dilute 
impurity content to the needed level (Das, 2006). Remelting operations fall into 
three categories:
	
1.	Integrated operations generate a consumer product, often extrusions, rather 
than merely producing billets. Scrap generated during extruding is recycled 
along with purchased scrap.
	
2.	Nonintegrated operations produce alloy billet for sale to other processors 
(Fielding, 2006).
	
3.	Toll operators accept scrap from a single source and melt it down for return 
to the originator without ever actually owning the material. This type of 
operation has become more popular in recent years, as large manufacturers 
arrange with secondary aluminum producers to operate dedicated recycling 
facilities designed to process only the manufacturer’s scrap (Carey, 2013; 
Petersen and McDonnell, 2008). About 10% of US secondary aluminum 
production comes from toll processors (Borner, 2012).
Initially, remelters were distinguished from secondary smelters by a lack of reﬁning 
capability. However, the demand for higher product quality now means that many 
remelters now reﬁne and ﬁlter their molten metal, regardless of its initial source.
A special type of remelter is the UBC recycler, which uses a feedstock consisting 
primarily of recovered beverage cans (Thornton et al., 2007). These ﬁrst began to 
appear in the 1980s, when the number of discarded cans became sufﬁcient to justify 
a specialized facility. UBC recyclers are similar to remelters in that they produce 
a wrought alloy, typically 3004. However, because their feedstock is a mixture of 
can bodies (3004) and lids (5175 and others), additions of primary aluminum and 
alloying elements are needed to produce the correct alloy composition. In addition, 
reﬁning and ﬁltration are required to produce a quality product. UBC recyclers are 

185
Recycling Industry
found mostly in Europe and North America, due to higher per capita use of cans 
there.
Secondary smelters, known as refiners in Europe, are the most common type of 
aluminum recycling facility. Secondary smelters produce casting alloys (Kirchner, 
2002), in particular one of the 380 variants (see Chapter 4), and as a result use types of 
obsolete or low-grade scrap that other recycling facilities cannot use. As the demand 
for better-quality scrap from other recyclers increases its price, secondary smelters 
increasingly rely on old scrap to meet their needs (Buchanan, 2002). However, the 
use of old scrap makes quality control more challenging, and so reﬁning and ﬁltra­
tion are increasingly necessary. The use of old scrap also makes operating in an 
environmentally acceptable manner more difﬁcult, since old scrap has more painted 
and coated material and is also more likely to contain plastics and salts.
INFLUENCES ON THE ALUMINUM RECYCLING INDUSTRY
IMPACT of GoVERnMEnT
Government decisions have a signiﬁcant impact on where aluminum recycling facili­
ties are located and how they do business. A few examples are listed as follows:
•	 The control of metal ﬂow across a country’s border is a common means 
of manipulating scrap-based industries (Alipchenko, 2009; Anon., 2007; 
De Oliveira, 2012; Kirchner, 2007b). The most common means of doing 
this is to restrict scrap exports, either with an export tax (Belarus, Brazil, 
China, Georgia, India, Russia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Zambia) or an outright 
ban (Azerbaijan, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, 
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Venezuela, Zimbabwe). This keeps scrap from 
leaving the country, making it available for local recyclers to use. The move 
to impose export controls has gained momentum in recent years, fueled by 
the aggressive purchasing of scrap by Asian recyclers. Export controls have 
other consequences as well. They lower the value of scrap, reducing the 
incentive to collect it, and they discourage the rationalization of the indus­
try to larger and more efﬁcient smelting or remelting facilities. Import taxes 
on reﬁned aluminum also support local producers and have been in place 
for some time in the European Union (Pawlek, 2006).
•	 In 2000, the European Union enacted directive 2000/53/EC, better known 
as the End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV) directive (Kitagawa, 2011). This direc­
tive requires automotive manufacturers to take ELV vehicles back when 
their working life is ﬁnished and to ensure appropriate disposal (Gesing, 
2005). The directive requires recovery or reuse of 85% (eventually 95%) of 
the material in the vehicle, with emphasis on reuse rather than reprocessing 
of materials. Similar requirements have been put in place in Japan. Since 
automakers will bear the cost of processing or disposal, recovery costs are 
important, and this encourages the development of closed-loop recycling, 
using a few favored scrap processors. This further reduces the number of 
small recycling operations in western Europe. Another possible response 

186
Aluminum Recycling
by automakers is to sell ELVs to countries outside the European Union, 
ultimately encouraging recycling of their aluminum content elsewhere.
•	 On July 22, 2011, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed 
a rule that would legally redeﬁne metal scrap as a solid waste material and 
equate recycling of scrap metal with that of hazardous waste (Spoden, 2013). 
Recyclers in both the United States and Europe have been struggling for 
years to convince government agencies that scrap is not waste and should 
not be regulated as such (Taylor, 2011b). The difference to metal recyclers 
can be signiﬁcant. The deﬁnition of metal scrap as a raw material rather 
than waste in Europe exempts it from export prohibitions under the Basel 
convention (Muchová and Eder, 2010). On the other hand, the imposition of 
new regulatory requirements is likely to reduce development of new recy­
cling programs. Because the economic advantage of using recycled metal 
over primary is small, measures that increase the cost of recycling often 
make it unviable, ultimately favoring the use of primary metal instead.
Other government mandates that impact the aluminum recycling industry include 
initiatives to increase recovery of UBCs, discussed in Chapter 3; required recy­
cling of computers and other electronic devices; and initiatives to increase materials 
recovery from construction and demolition debris. These tend to support recycling 
facilities in industrialized countries, where these material streams are generated.
•	 In 2013, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) created by the European 
Union will apply to the secondary aluminum industry as well as the pri­
mary industry (Luo, 2009). The ETS imposes charges on companies for 
the amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) their processes release, beyond 
a set free allocation. This free allocation will decrease with time and is 
scheduled to disappear entirely by 2027. Producers whose GHG emissions 
are less than that allowed can sell their unused allotment to those who have 
excess emissions, a system known as cap-and-trade; a market price exists 
for these emissions, and the incomes to be earned from selling them encour­
ages even low GHG producers to continue to ﬁnd ways to lower emission 
further. Similar schemes are under consideration by Australia, Canada, and 
the United States (Anton, 2010).
In general, ETS beneﬁts the aluminum recycling industry. Secondary aluminum 
production produces roughly 90% less GHG than primary production (Damgaard 
et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010), which allows primary producers to lower their overall 
impact and enhances the value of recycled metal. However, application of ETS to 
the secondary aluminum industry also has costs, especially for facilities that are 
less energy efﬁcient (Luo, 2009). The application of GHG costs to typical secondary 
smelters could raise the total conversion cost by 5%–6%; in an environment such 
as Europe where recyclers are already under stress, the results could be continued 
reduction of the industry and movement of recycled aluminum production to coun­
tries where such additional costs are not incurred (Gesing, 2005). This would in turn 
result in increased import of aluminum to the EU from elsewhere and greater global 

187
Recycling Industry
GHG emissions in the process. EU efforts to improve the sustainability of manufac­
turing industries create a similar risk of unintended consequences (Glimm, 2009).
IMPACT of DEMAnD
Secondary aluminum smelters exist primarily to serve the needs of the transporta­
tion industry, in particular auto producers; 70%–80% of their production is sold to 
this sector (De Oliveira, 2012). As a result, secondary smelters tend to be located 
near foundries serving the auto industry, and when the auto industry moves, the sec­
ondary smelting industry moves with it (Koscielski, 2010). This is especially appar­
ent in eastern Europe and Mexico (Buchanan, 2002; Wilkinson, 2001). Figure 11.1 
shows the location of major (>10,000 tpy) aluminum recycling facilities in India 
(squares) and that of auto production facilities (open circles). Nearly all of the sec­
ondary smelters are located near their primary customer, an automotive producer 
(Jhunjhunwala, 2009).
For remelters, the development of closed-loop recycling arrangements with scrap 
generators has meant more stability. This has meant less movement of this industry 
than for secondary smelters. UBC recyclers in particular have remained primarily 
in North America, since that is where both the scrap cans and the can producers 
are located. However, broader changes in metal demand affect this branch of the 
industry as well. The rapid and sustained growth of the Chinese economy in recent 
years has increased demand for all metals, and this has contributed to the sustained 
FIGURE 11.1  Location of major aluminum recycling facilities (ﬁlled squares) and automo­
tive manufacturers (open circles) in India.

188

increase in scrap ﬂow to China (Gesing, 2005; Kirchner, 2007a,b). Figure 11.2 shows 
the global movement of aluminum scrap in 2011; the importance of demand from 
China is the predominant feature of global trade.
IMPACT of CosT
For aluminum recyclers, the cost of operation can be separated into two categories: 
the cost of obtaining scrap and the cost of processing it. As might be suspected, 
recyclers tend to be located in areas where these costs are less.
Some of the factors affecting the price of scrap have already been mentioned (see 
Chapter 4), including export or import fees and competition for scrap from primary 
smelters. Scrap prices are also affected by the price of primary aluminum and by the 
quality. (New scrap sells for more than old scrap, and sorted scrap sells for more than 
mixed scrap.) Sudden increases in scrap availability without an increase in nearby 
smelting or remelting capacity lower prices, encouraging recycling operations to set 
up shop. The increase in smelting capacity in eastern Europe has been accredited to 
this. As demand for scrap increases, the price eventually increases too, erasing this 
cost advantage.
The cost of operation is affected by the costs of energy, capital equipment, labor, 
and waste disposal. Since most secondary aluminum remelters and smelters ﬁre 
their furnaces with natural gas, increases in natural gas price are important. Areas 
with lower energy prices become attractive, even if other costs are higher there. As 
pointed out in Chapter 6, lower labor costs in China made hand sorting more proﬁt­
able than automated sorting in Europe and North America (Gesing, 2005; Schwalbe, 
2011), although this is now changing; this is another reason why scrap supplies have 
been moving to China (Pawlek, 2006). Waste disposal costs are also higher in west­
ern Europe and North America, particularly for salt slags (Schwalbe, 1998), and this 
too encourages the industry to move elsewhere.

Recycling Industry
IMPACT of TECHnoLoGY
The story of aluminum recycling has been largely the story of facilities attempting 
to manufacture a quality product suitable to customers. The most important techno­
logical development has been the installation of reﬁning and ﬁltration equipment, 
which has made the quality of secondary aluminum close to that of primary. Another 
important technological development has been the construction of crucibles in which 
smelting and remelting facilities can send molten metal directly to customers (Hodge, 
2009; Kuom and Urbach, 2007), without the need to cast it into ingots or billets. 
Shipping molten metal eliminates the expense of casting it and saves the customer 
money by eliminating the energy cost otherwise required to remelt it. However, a 
recycler shipping molten metal needs to be physically close to his customer, and this 
has provided further encouragement to recyclers to relocate as needed. Closed-loop 
recyclers are particularly subject to this restriction.
The most noticeable impact of improved technology can be seen in Table 11.1 
(Scharf–Bergmann, 2007). Small garage secondary smelters used to be quite com­
mon in Europe, collecting scrap over a small area and producing recycled secondary 
ingot (RSI) for sale to foundries. However, these small operations cannot afford to 
install the reﬁning and environmental equipment increasingly needed to produce a 
quality product and meet government regulations. As a result, these operations have 
been falling by the wayside (Kirchner, 2006; Lokshin and Makarov, 2007; Scharf–
Bergmann, 2008), while the number of large smelting facilities has been increasing.
RECYCLING AROUND THE WORLD
Figure 11.3 shows the location of major scrap aluminum consumers (>10,000 tons/
year) on the African continent, from the listing by Pawlek (2012). Consumers include 
reﬁners, secondary smelters, and primary smelters using scrap, as well as foundries 
that consume large quantities of scrap directly. As can be seen, the industry is largely 
nonexistent in Africa, the result of a lack of supply of scrap, the lack of manufactur­
ers to consume it, and a primary aluminum industry that can more than meet the 
continent’s needs. There are two exceptions. The ﬁrst is South Africa, where a small

collection of secondary smelters is struggling against higher scrap prices and loss of 
industrial capacity (Odendaal, 2010). The other is Egypt, where scrap is consumed 
mostly by foundries and some small secondary smelters (SEAM, 2005).
Figure 11.4 shows the major scrap consumers of South America. Most of the 
continent’s capacity is concentrated in two countries, Argentina and Brazil. As is the 
case with Africa, South America is a net scrap exporter (De Oliveira, 2012), mostly 
to Asia. Most of the scrap consumed consists of UBCs, which Brazil does a better 
job of collecting than most other countries (Minter, 2010; Scharf–Bergmann, 2008).

191
Recycling Industry
The UBC is not recycled directly but used by secondary smelters to produce casting 
alloy for the growing automotive industry.
The recycling industry of the Middle East and south Asia is highlighted in 
Figure 11.5. The industry is concentrated in three areas: India, Turkey, and the Gulf 
States. The structure of the Indian industry has been previously discussed; about 
70% of recycled metal in India is cast alloy in the automotive sector (Gopalkrishnan, 
2012). Labor costs are low in India and barriers to entry are few, so the industry 
features many small producers and is a scrap importer (Minter, 2006). Gulf area 
recyclers also import most of their scrap from the surrounding region (Minter, 2007; 
Scharf–Bergmann, 2007). Most of the scrap purchased in the Gulf is used by pri­
mary producers, both for mixing and for the separate production of cast alloys.
Figure 11.6 shows the recycling industry of Southeast Asia. As Hayashi (2012) 
points out, much of the growth in secondary aluminum production in the region is 
directly related to the growth of the auto industry. In particular, this has encouraged 
the growth of the industry in Malaysia (Minter, 2011a), which is now a net importer 
of aluminum scrap (Michida, 2011). Countries with smaller recycling industries 
struggle to keep scrap from being sold overseas, particularly to China (Minter, 
2008a).
Figure 11.7 shows the locations of aluminum recyclers in east Asia. Expensive 
electrical power and the lack of domestic bauxite mean that almost all of Japan’s 
domestic aluminum production consists of recycled metal. Hayashi (2012) states that 
about 20% of the scrap processed in Japan is imported, especially from Russia. The 
rest is obtained domestically. As is the case elsewhere, secondary aluminum produc­
tion in Japan is tied to the auto industry, and as Japanese automakers increasingly 
locate their manufacturing facilities outside Japan, the aluminum recycling industry

moves with them. Lower-grade scrap is often sent to China (Michida, 2011; Yoshida 
et al., 2005).
The South Korean recycled aluminum industry is closely tied to the Hyundai–Kia 
automotive group (Hayashi, 2012). Much of the recycled metal is shipped as molten 
casting alloy. Novelis recently began operations at a UBC direct recycling facility at 
Yeongju, the largest such facility in Asia (Watanabe, 2012).
As is the case with many other industries, the secondary aluminum industry in 
China has expanded dramatically since 2001 (Hayashi, 2012). An increasing frac­
tion of the scrap used comes from domestic sources (Minter, 2008b), but the Chinese

need for raw material has led them to become the most signiﬁcant purchaser of scrap 
in several markets around the world, leading to the loss of aluminum recycling in 
several countries (Kirchner, 2007a,b; Scharf–Bergmann, 2007). The advantage of 
cheap Chinese labor for sorting and melting operations has been well noted; how­
ever, labor costs have risen signiﬁcantly in the industry since 2010 (Minter, 2011b), 
and the need to meet previously ignored environmental standards evens the playing 
ﬁeld still further. As a result, the Chinese secondary aluminum industry is begin­
ning to move down a familiar path—closing smaller and dirtier operations, moving 
to more automated sorting technology, and improving product quality (Lili, 2008).
Figure 11.8 shows the location of major aluminum recyclers in Europe (Pawlek, 
2012). The concentration of remelters and secondary smelters across the continent 
reﬂects the greater scrap supply from industrialized societies, as well as the decline 
of primary smelting as a source of aluminum (Conserva, 2011). Most secondary pro­
duction comes from France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The European 
secondary industry has suffered in recent years from loss of scrap to Asia, denial of 
scrap from eastern Europe by export restrictions, and high energy and labor costs. 
The presence of the auto industry is still important in determining the location of the 
industry (Kirchner, 2006); Lepenˇ (2011) has shown how most of the recycling capac­
ity of eastern Europe is located within 200 km of eastern Czechia, the location of 
several automotive assembly plants. As previously mentioned, an increasing amount 
of scrap in Europe is consumed by primary producers, who can lower costs and meet 
environmental goals by doing so (Scharf–Bergmann, 2007).
Figure 11.9 shows the location of shredding facilities in North America (Taylor, 
2011a). Their location corresponds to population density, which is proportional to 
the supply of shreddable goods. The shredding business is highly competitive, and 
it is thought that excess capacity may be shutting down over the next few years 
(Taylor, 2010). Figure 11.10 shows North American scrap consumers (Pawlek, 2012).

Aluminum Recycling
The geographic concentration is somewhat different from that of the shredders, as it 
tends to follow the location of customers, particularly the auto industry (Garen et al., 
2009). The closure of primary smelters in the United States has encouraged growth 
of the industry (Koscielski, 2010); 56% of US aluminum production in 2008 was 
secondary. The United States exports large amounts of scrap to Asia, in particular 
China; it also imports scrap from Canada and Mexico (Kirchner, 2007a), in particu­
lar UBC scrap.

12 Metal Refining and 
Purification
As Chapter 4 pointed out, aluminum alloys produced by remelting scrap are less 
valuable than alloys with the same composition produced from primary metal. The 
reason for this is concern over the purity of the recycled metal alloy, which is often 
inferior to that of primary. The development of reﬁning technology for molten alu­
minum is designed to eliminate this deﬁciency, which will allow recycled metal to 
compete with the primary in more applications. Much of the technology used for 
reﬁning molten aluminum has been introduced only in the last 30 years, and what 
was once a minor footnote in an aluminum production ﬂowsheet is now a major 
consideration.
The choice of reﬁning strategy and technology used by scrap remelters depends 
on several factors—the type of scrap being remelted, the type of furnace used, the 
type of product being generated, and, most importantly, the needs of customers. 
As a result, there is no universal reﬁning technology. A complicating factor is the 
blending of scrap with primary metal in melting furnaces, which also combines the 
reﬁning concerns of the two types of metal. Because of this, much of the technology 
used for reﬁning remelted aluminum scrap is also used to purify molten primary 
metal. Since the basic principles are the same, a discussion of reﬁning technology 
for secondary aluminum is essentially a discussion of molten aluminum reﬁning in 
general.
The following discussion is a brief introduction to the theory and equipment used 
for molten aluminum reﬁning. Enough in-depth information exists on this technol­
ogy alone to write an entire book about it. Those wishing to learn more about alumi­
num reﬁning are encouraged to consult the references at the end of this chapter, in 
particular the review by Zhang et al. (2011).
COMMON IMPURITIES IN MOLTEN ALUMINUM
Table 12.1 lists the most common impurities in molten aluminum (Waite, 2002) and 
compares their concentration in primary and secondary metal. The impurities can be 
divided into three classes—hydrogen, reactive metals (including magnesium), and 
inclusions.
Hydrogen: As previously discussed, dissolved hydrogen in molten aluminum is 
obtained from a reaction between water vapor and the molten aluminum (Foseco, 
2011; Fruehan and Anyalebechi, 2008):
	
3H2O + 2Al = Al2O3 + 6H	
(12.1)

200
Aluminum Recycling
The magnesium in remelted alloy scrap also reacts with water vapor:
	
H2O + Mg = MgO + 2H	
(12.2)
Both reactions are highly favored thermodynamically and limited only by the forma­
tion of an oxide skin on the melt surface, which prevents contact between the water 
vapor and the molten metal. Factors that encourage these reactions and increase the 
dissolved hydrogen content of the metal include the following:
•	 A higher vapor pressure of water vapor in the atmosphere (i.e., higher 
humidity), which drives the reactions to the right (Foseco, 2011)
•	 Metal turbulence, which destroys the oxide skin and allows the reactions 
to continue
•	 Wet or damp charge materials, which make water vapor directly available 
to the melt
In addition to natural humidity, water vapor in the products of combustion (POC) 
from fossil-fuel ﬁred furnaces is a source of hydrogen (Enright, 2007; Foseco, 2011). 
As a result, extended exposure to POC in transfer ladles can raise dissolved hydro­
gen content still further. Some alloying elements (Cu, Fe, Si, Zn) raise the activity 
coefﬁcient of dissolved hydrogen in molten aluminum, decreasing its solubility 
(Fruehan and Anyalebechi, 2008); others (Li, Mg, Zr) lower the activity coefﬁcient 
and raise the solubility. Sigworth et al. (2008) have shown that 2000-series alloys 
(see Chapter 2) have a hydrogen solubility up to 30% lower than that of pure alumi­
num, and 5000 series can dissolve hydrogen at levels 50% or higher than the pure 
metal. As Table 12.1 shows, the hydrogen content of remelted scrap is usually higher 
than that of primary metal. This is caused mostly by water in the scrap and by the 
use of fossil fuels for remelting it (Pyrotek, 2006).

Metal Refining and Purification
The unit for hydrogen analysis in molten aluminum is unusual. Hydrogen ­contents 
are often expressed as standard cm3 of H2 gas contained per 100 gm of molten 
aluminum (Fruehan and Anyalebechi, 2008). The reason is that hydrogen is virtu­
ally insoluble in solid aluminum. Because of this, any hydrogen dissolved in the mol­
ten metal will exsolve during solidiﬁcation, resulting in porosity in the cast product 
(Enright, 2007). Since 100 g of solid aluminum has a theoretical volume of 37.04 cm3, 
a dissolved hydrogen content of 0.5 cm3/100 g would result in a porosity level of 
1.33% in the solid product, unacceptable for many applications. Customer speciﬁca­
tions often call for H levels in purchased aluminum of 0.18 cm3/100 g (0.16 wppm) or 
less for wrought-alloy applications (Enright, 2007; Fielding, 1996), and this speciﬁ­
cation continues to decrease as rolled sections get thinner and less tolerant of poros­
ity. Allowable hydrogen levels for casting alloys are higher (0.4 cm3/100 g) but still 
lower than the level initially present in most molten scrap. Dissolved hydrogen levels 
in scrap melts can often exceed 0.5 cm3/100 g (0.45 wppm).
The development of new analytical technology has changed the way aluminum 
producers and manufacturers analyze the hydrogen content of their metal. The goal 
has been to develop an instrument that can be used online, can provide results in real 
time, is inexpensive to use, can survive in a plant environment, and can provide reli­
able results. The analytical options resulting from this development (Apelian, 2009; 
Hills et al., 2009; Neff, 2004):
•	 The reduced pressure test (also known as the Straube–Pfeiffer test), which 
relies on Archimedes principle and assumes that all of the hydrogen in solu­
tion in the molten aluminum will come out as it solidiﬁes. The reduced 
pressure test involves solidifying a small sample taken from the melt in a 
closed chamber under a set pressure (Enright, 2007; Velasco and Montalvo, 
2012). Measuring the density of the solid determines its porosity; knowing 
the volume occupied by the pores and the pressure determines the amount 
of hydrogen released by the solidifying metal; knowing the mass of the alu­
minum allows calculation of the hydrogen concentration. However, in prac­
tice the reduced pressure test does not provide an accurate measurement of 
dissolved hydrogen content. Several factors determine the amount of poros­
ity that forms in a solidifying sample, and at best the results are more useful 
for comparative purposes. In addition, the method does not provide real-
time results. The reduced pressure test is popular in many foundries due to 
its simplicity and quick turnaround but may wind up being phased out as 
more accurate techniques become affordable.
•	 Direct determination methods measure the amount of H2 generated by a 
molten sample. The best example of this is the Leco device. This device 
melts a solid sample taken from the furnace in a stream of helium. Hydrogen 
is transferred to the gas stream and passed over heated copper oxide, which 
reacts with the hydrogen to generate copper metal and water. Measuring 
the amount of water in the gas determines the amount of hydrogen in the 
sample. This produces a direct measurement of hydrogen content, rather 
than pH2, and so does not require alloy- and temperature-dependent cor­
rections. However, it does not operate online and does not produce quick

Aluminum Recycling
turnaround. In addition, the use of a solidiﬁed sample from the furnace 
raises the possibility that the hydrogen content of the sample and that of the 
melt are not the same.
•	 Analytical methods determine the partial pressure of H2 exsolved from a 
sample into a vacuum or carrier gas. The best-known example of this is the 
Alscan device (Badowski and Droste, 2009; Enright, 2007; Exebio et al., 
2008; Gansemer et al., 2007). This is an online measurement tool, in which 
a probe is inserted into the melt containing a ceramic foam. Dissolved 
hydrogen diffuses into the foam and is removed by nitrogen carrier gas. 
The hydrogen content of the equilibrated gas (and thus the partial pressure 
of hydrogen) is determined by measuring its thermal conductivity and com­
paring with a calibration chart. The process requires 10–15 min to com­
plete, which limits its usefulness for process control (Hills et al., 2009). The 
accuracy of direct determination measurement is complicated by the need 
to know the relationship between pH2 and dissolved hydrogen content as a 
function of alloy content and metal temperature.
•	 Electrochemical analysis is the newest category of hydrogen analysis 
method and has become more widely used since the previous edition of 
this book (Badowski and Droste, 2009; Hills et al., 2009; Pascual, 2009). 
The best-known example of this type of measurement is the Alspek device 
(Moores, 2008). This uses a solid electrolyte (indium-doped calcium zir­
conate) which conducts protons (H+ ions) generated by the dissolved hydro­
gen in the molten metal; the higher the hydrogen content, the greater the 
ionic current generated in the electrolyte. An internal reference (a mixture 
of hydrogen-containing β-Zr and δ-ZrH2) eliminates the need for an exter­
nal hydrogen reference. This device can be used online, generates quick 
results, and is increasingly reliable. Its use will likely become more promi­
nent over the next few years.
Reactive metals: Although this group of impurities in theory includes all the alkali 
and alkaline earth metals, in practice four elements matter most—sodium, calcium, 
lithium, and magnesium (Pyrotek, 2006). The sodium content of primary metal 
results from interaction between the aluminum generated in molten salt electrolytic 
cells and the sodium in the cryolite bath. Since this bath is not used to remelt scrap, 
secondary metal has little or no sodium. Some calcium is found in remelted scrap, 
however. The most signiﬁcant source of calcium in scrap is the calcium-containing 
salts used for deicing roads and bridges, which can wind up attached to aluminum 
car and truck parts. Because primary metal is often added to molten scrap, the pres­
ence of sodium is often a concern as well. Lithium in primary metal is a decreasing 
concern, as the number of potlines using Li2CO3 continues to decrease. However, 
increasing use of lithium-containing alloys by the aircraft industry (see Chapter 2) 
means the eventual return of these alloys as scrap. Allowable lithium concentrations 
in automotive casting alloys are <3 ppm (Carey, 2013), so lithium removal is becom­
ing more important. Sodium is deliberately added to a few aluminum alloys, but 
allowable sodium concentration in most others is 5 ppm or less (Dewan et al., 2011; 
Enright, 2007).

203
Metal Refining and Purification
The amount of magnesium in molten scrap depends on the alloys being remelted 
and can range to 5% or higher. Whether this magnesium is treated as an impurity to 
be removed depends on the alloy being created; because magnesium is more expen­
sive than aluminum, alloy practice that produces alloys with higher magnesium con­
tent than that of the melt is encouraged. However, in some cases, this is not feasible, 
and demagging is a part of the reﬁning process.
As is the case with hydrogen, analysis of the reactive-metal content of molten 
aluminum is increasingly conducted on the shop ﬂoor, and quick turnaround time 
is important. The most popular technique is optical emission spectrometry (OES), 
which can also measure the concentration of other trace metals (Logan, 2012). OES 
measures relative concentrations of trace elements, so a good reference material is 
a must (Hamouche, 2004). The automation of the analytical process has been a sig­
niﬁcant improvement.
Inclusions: Inclusions are mostly solid particles suspended in molten aluminum. 
The number and size of these particles depends on a variety of things, in particular 
the initial quality of the scrap being melted and the impurities contained in that 
scrap. Inclusions are nonmetallic particles, usually less than 100 μm in size. They 
consist mostly of oxides, although several other types of compounds are represented. 
There are two basic classes of inclusion: exogenous and indigenous.
Exogenous inclusions are particles already existing as a separate phase before 
melting (Eckert, 1992). Small pieces of furnace refractory that break off into the melt 
are the best-known examples (Weaver, 1997); bits of oxide or dirt attached to scrap 
are another. Exogenous inclusions consist almost entirely of oxide and are much 
larger than most indigenous inclusions. Because of this, their presence in aluminum 
is more harmful than that of indigenous inclusions; however, their larger size makes 
them easier to remove.
Indigenous or in situ inclusions are formed by chemical reactions taking place in 
the melt (Eckert, 1992; de la Sabloniere and Samuel, 1996). An example is the reac­
tion of dissolved oxygen with the molten aluminum to generate alumina:
	
2Al + 3O = Al2O3	
(12.3)
The thermodynamic stability of alumina increases as the temperature decreases, 
and the solubility of oxygen in molten aluminum decreases with temperature as 
well, so reaction (12.3) automatically occurs in aluminum as it cools. In magnesium-
containing alloys, magnesia and spinel are also created (Enright, 2007; Fielding, 
1996):
	
Mg + O = MgO	
(12.4)
	
Mg + 2Al + 4O = MgAl2O4	
(12.5)
If nitrogen is used during degassing, AlN can form; if MgCl2 is used as a ﬂux, chlo­
ride inclusions can form as well. A particular problem is TiB2, formed when boron is 
alloyed with the metal for grain reﬁning (Pyrotek, 2006). These inclusions are much 
smaller than exogenous inclusions and much harder to remove.

204
Aluminum Recycling
The inclusions in remelted aluminum scrap are different than those in primary 
metal, as Table 12.1 shows. Scrap inherently has more dirt and oxide in it than pri­
mary metal (Pyrotek, 2006), and the oxide skins generated during melting increase 
the inclusion count even more (Altenpohl, 1998). As a result, inclusion removal is 
much more important in secondary aluminum production. Remelting of bulky scrap 
generates metal with fewer inclusions than remelted UBC or light scrap; the price 
of bulky scrap is higher as a result (see Chapter 4). Remelting of high-magnesium 
alloys generates a higher inclusion count, due to the greater tendency of magnesium 
to react during melting.
Figure 12.1 describes in greater detail the signiﬁcance of different types of inclu­
sions in molten aluminum (Altenpohl, 1998). The hatched area is an unofﬁcial qual­
ity limit for the concentration of inclusions of different sizes in cast aluminum. (The 
limits are lower in wrought aluminum.) The y-axes are inclusion concentration per 
unit area of as-cast microstructure; the x-axis is the average diameter of the inclu­
sion. Curve C is for inclusions generated during casting, that is, oxide skins and slag 
inclusions; exogenous inclusions would also fall along this curve. Curve B is for 
indigenous inclusions generated during melting and melt treatment. In general, oxide 
inclusions tend to be larger than those composed of carbide or boride particles and 
the ones most in need of removal for quality standards.
The unit of inclusion analysis (mm2/kg) in Table 12.1 is unusual. The reason for 
this is the choice of analytical method. Before the 1980s, inclusions were counted by 
analyzing the microstructure of cast metal and by hand. However, the small num­
ber of inclusions made this a difﬁcult and time-consuming process. In the 1980s, 
the introduction of PoDFA and LAIS made inclusion analysis easier (Enright, 2007; 
Neff, 2004; Poynton et al., 2009). PoDFA (Porus disk ﬁltration apparatus) and LAIS 
(Liquid aluminum inclusion sampler) use the vacuum ﬁltration of a known amount of

Metal Refining and Purification
molten metal through a porous ﬁlter to collect the inclusions, which are then counted 
and measured. The total area of inclusion per kilogram of metal ﬁltered is the vari­
able measured and used in Table 12.1. These tests are inexpensive to conduct, but 
time consuming and expensive to analyze. As a result, their effectiveness as process 
management tools is limited.
A more useful tool is the Preﬁl Footprinter (Enright, 2007; Poynton et al., 2009), 
which also uses the forced passage of metal through a ﬁlter. In addition to collecting 
inclusions, Preﬁl measures the amount of metal passing through the ﬁlter as a func­
tion of time. A plot of metal ﬂow rate against time indicates the relative number and 
size of inclusions. The shape of the initial portion of the curve is determined by the 
number of larger inclusions (Prillhofer et al., 2008); the number of smaller inclusions 
is apparent from the shape of the curve in the latter stages. Although Preﬁl does not 
give precise information about the number and size of inclusions, it is a useful tool 
for obtaining real-time results on the effect of process changes on the quality of mol­
ten aluminum at various stages in the melting and casting process.
A more recent development has revolutionized inclusion measurement in molten 
aluminum. LiMCA (Liquid metal cleanliness analyzer) is based on a Coulter counter, 
which detects inclusions by their impact on the electrical conductivity of aluminum 
ﬂowing through a small tube (Engh, 1992; Poynton et al., 2009). Each inclusion is 
registered separately, allowing them to be counted per unit mass of metal. Within 
limits, LiMCA can also determine the size of inclusions and provide real-time analy­
sis. Challenges include distinguishing between inclusions and gas bubbles and using 
LiMCA to detect and count inclusions smaller than 20 μm (Badowski and Instone, 
2012). Considerable research has been performed on the development of ultrasonic 
sensors (Kurban et al., 2005), which would sample a larger liquid metal volume than 
LiMCA and provide quicker results; however, the high temperature of molten alu­
minum has made it difﬁcult to develop a reliable instrument (Poynton et al., 2010).
The fourth class of impurities: Although not listed in Table 12.1, there is a fourth 
class of impurities that remelters would like to remove if possible. These are the 
alloying elements present in aluminum scrap—copper, iron, manganese, silicon, and 
zinc (Pyrotek, 2006). Percentages of these elements vary, depending on the scrap 
charge and the amount of primary metal added. However, concentrations of these 
elements that are too high limit the number of alloys that can be produced from a 
melt, as discussed in Chapter 2.
The development of technology for segregating scrap by alloy type was discussed 
in Chapter 5; however, the commercial use of this technology is in its infancy. In the 
meantime, the only current response to high concentrations of alloying elements is 
either the production of an alloy with even higher concentration of these elements, 
such as 364.1 or 380.1, or dilution of the alloying elements to a lower level with added 
primary metal.
Several efforts have been made in recent years to develop an approach for remov­
ing dissolved iron from molten aluminum (Zhang and Damoah, 2011). Gao et al. 
(2009) and Chen et al. (2012) demonstrated an electroslag reﬁning process using 
sodium borate. The reaction between the borate and dissolved iron generates solid 
iron boride and sodium dissolved in the melt. A more common approach is to add 
manganese and silicon; this causes the precipitation of the intermetallic phase

Al15(Fe,Mn)3Si2, which can be removed by ﬁltration (Lee et al., 2010; de Moraes 
et al., 2006). While these techniques show promise for iron removal, they introduce 
new impurities that themselves have to be removed, and the added expense makes 
producing aluminum alloy from primary metal economically preferable. More 
improvement will be needed before these techniques become commercially viable.
FUNDAMENTALS OF IMPURITY REMOVAL
Hydrogen: The only successful technique for removing hydrogen from molten alu­
minum is to transfer it to a gas phase by the following reaction:
	
2H = H2 (g)	
(12.6)
The equilibrium constant for this reaction can be rearranged to a form of Sievert’s law:
	
[H] = S (pH2)1/2	
(12.7)
where
[H] is the dissolved hydrogen concentration in cm3/100 g of aluminum
pH2 is the partial pressure of hydrogen in atm
S is the equilibrium constant for Equation 12.6 at a given temperature
Sigworth et al. (2008) suggest that the most accurate expression of S in pure alumi­
num as a function of temperature is

(12.8)
where T is expressed in K. At 700°C (973 K), S = 0.911, and molten pure aluminum 
with a dissolved hydrogen concentration of 0.4 cm3/100 g (0.36 wppm) will gener­
ate pH2 equal to 0.156 atm. As long as the actual partial pressure of hydrogen is less 
than that, degassing will proceed; when the equilibrium level is reached, the overall 
reaction will stop. Producing a hydrogen level of 0.2 cm3/100 g (0.18 wppm) requires 
a partial pressure of H2 less than 0.048 atm.
The rate at which reaction (12.6) proceeds is a function of driving force (the dif­
ference between the equilibrium pH2 and the actual pH2 in the vapor phase), the tem­
perature, and the relative surface area of interface between melt and vapor phase per 
unit volume of melt. Removal rates can be increased by
•	 Reducing the partial pressure of H2 in the gas, either by using a vacuum or 
bubbling gas into the melt
•	 Raising the temperature (although this increases energy costs and raises H 
solubility)
•	 Generating higher relative surface area by adding lots of very tiny bubbles 
to the melt (Engh, 1992; Sigworth et al., 2008)

207
Metal Refining and Purification
It was thought that the use of chlorine in degassing atmospheres might further 
enhance hydrogen removal (Peterson et al., 1995) through the following reaction:
	
2H + Cl2 = HCl (g)	
(12.9)
However, HCl is thermodynamically less stable than AlCl3, so the likelihood of 
chlorine being effective for hydrogen removal is doubtful. Several experiments 
have reached the conclusion that chlorine use in degassing, while useful for alkali 
removal, is no more effective at hydrogen removal than any other gas and might be 
detrimental (Chesonis and DeYoung, 2008; Williams et al., 2000).

calcium, lithium, and sodium. This is why a molten sodium–aluminum ﬂuoride salt 
bath is used for the electrowinning of primary aluminum and why lithium salts can 
be added to that bath. It also forms the basis for the removal of impurity calcium, 
lithium, and sodium from molten aluminum scrap. Chlorine gas is added and reacts 
with the impurities to form sodium or calcium chloride, which ﬂoats to the salt slag 
on top:
	
Ca + Cl2 = CaCl2 (slag)	
(12.11)
	
Na + ½Cl2 = NaCl (slag)	
(12.12)
Chlorine also reacts preferentially with magnesium and is the key to demagging of 
molten aluminum scrap as well:
	
Mg + Cl2 = MgCl2 (slag)	
(12.13)
However, the use of chlorine gas also presents environmental concerns, since it also 
reacts with the aluminum to generate aluminum chloride vapor:
	
2Al + 3Cl2 = 2AlCl3 (g)	
(12.14)
This reaction occurs when the concentration of other impurities is low and so occurs 
in low-magnesium molten scrap or primary metal. The aluminum chloride reacts 
with water vapor above the melt to generate hydrochloric acid vapor (Eckert, 1992):
	
2AlCl3 (g) + 3H2O (g) = Al2O3 (s) + 6HCl (g)	
(12.15)
In addition, unreacted chlorine also winds up in the atmosphere above the melt. The 
workplace hygiene and environmental concerns resulting from this are an incentive 
to replace chlorine gas as a reﬁning agent (Chesonis and DeYoung, 2008; Leboeuf 
et al., 2007; Ohno, 2010; Velasco and Nino, 2011).
Fluorine gas is not used for reﬁning, but solid ﬂuxes containing aluminum ﬂuo­
ride have been developed that can react with the impurities (Zholnin et al., 2005):
	
2AlF3 + 3Ca = 2Al + 3CaF2 (slag)	
(12.16)
	
AlF3 + 3Na = Al + 3NaF (slag)	
(12.17)
	
2AlF3 + 3Mg = 2Al + 3MgF2 (slag)	
(12.18)
Because of this, AlF3 ﬂuxes cannot be used to remove calcium and sodium from 
magnesium-containing alloys—the AlF3 would remove the magnesium as well. In 
addition, AlF3 is expensive for secondary smelters, and the use of ﬂuorides presents 
potential workplace hygiene concerns. As a result, ﬂuxes containing MgCl2 have 
been developed (Chesonis and DeYoung, 2008; Courtenay, 2008; Leboeuf et al., 
2007):

209
Metal Refining and Purification
	
MgCl2 + 2Na = Mg + 2NaCl (slag)	
(12.19)
	
MgCl2 + Ca = Mg + CaCl2 (slag)	
(12.20)
These ﬂuxes are premelted with KCl (to prevent hydration of the MgCl2) at one of 
several compositions corresponding to eutectics in the KCl–MgCl2 system. The price 
of KCl is volatile, so Courtenay (2011) has demonstrated that satisfactory sodium 
removal can be achieved with an MgCl2–KCl–NaCl eutectic ﬂux that reduces the 
cost. Adding 1–3 wt.-% ﬂuorspar (CaF2) improves reaction efﬁciency.
Many of the same methods for improving degassing kinetics also improve 
the kinetics of reactive-metal removal. The effectiveness of chlorine injection is 
improved by decreasing the bubble size (increasing relative surface area), stirring 
the melt (to eliminate transport to the bubble surface as a limiting factor), and to 
a limited extent increasing the concentration of chlorine in the gas. The effective 
use of ﬂux for calcium and sodium removal requires small particle size and some 
agitation as well (Chesonis and DeYoung, 2008; Courtenay, 2008; Leboeuf et al., 
2007). The concentration of MgCl2 in the ﬂux does not seem to affect removal 
efﬁciency.
Inclusions: There are three ways by which inclusions can be removed from alumi­
num. The ﬁrst is sedimentation, the natural settling of inclusions to the bottom of a 
melting or holding furnace (Altenpohl, 1998; Engh, 1992; Mirgaux et al., 2008). The 
rate at which small particles settle in a ﬂuid is governed by a version of Stokes’ law:
	
u
ga
r = 2
9
2
Dr
rn
	
(12.21)
where
ur is the settling rate of the inclusion, in m/s
∆ρ is the difference between the density of the inclusion and the ﬂuid (in this case, 
molten aluminum)
g is the gravitational constant (9.81 m/s2)
a is the inclusion diameter, in m
ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of molten aluminum, respectively
For a 100 μm (10−4 m) alumina inclusion in molten aluminum, Engh (1992) has 
calculated a typical settling rate of 1.36 · 10−3 m/s (8.16 cm/min). The settling rate 
for inclusions smaller than 100 μm is even slower; a 10 μm inclusion would settle 
at a rate of 0.082 cm/min. Casting furnace operators allow some time for settling 
to occur, which reduces the number of large inclusions in the melt (Enright, 2007; 
Instone et al., 2008; Prillhofer et al., 2009). However, for most inclusions, settling is 
not a predominant means of removal (Mirgaux et al., 2008).
A more effective means of inclusion removal is flotation (Altenpohl, 1998; 
Enright, 2007), which is caused by the attachment of inclusions to bubbles rising 
to the melt (such as those used for degassing and reactive-metal removal). Complex 
models have been developed for estimating the rate at which inclusions are removed 

210
Aluminum Recycling
by ﬂotation in both continuous and batch reactors (Engh, 1992). The removal rate is 
a function of the following:
•	 Inclusion size: smaller inclusions are more likely to be ﬂoated out (Mirgaux 
et al., 2009).
•	 The gas ﬂow rate per unit volume of furnace: more gas equals more bubbles 
for inclusions to attach to.
•	 The furnace height: the greater the distance bubbles have to rise, the more 
likely they are to run into inclusions.
•	 A collision efficiency, equal to the square of the ratio of the inclusion diam­
eter to the bubble diameter.
•	 The bubble size: smaller bubbles provide more relative surface area.
•	 The gas inside the bubble: inclusions attach more readily to bubbles con­
taining some chlorine (Enright, 2007; Williams et al., 2000).
The use of Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) to study the impact of process vari­
ables on ﬂotation and sedimentation rates during degassing is a major advance in 
process development (Mirgaux et al., 2008, 2009).
It has been suggested that ﬂotation alone is sufﬁcient to remove enough inclusions 
to meet quality speciﬁcations for some applications. However, in most cases, addi­
tional puriﬁcation is required, especially for smaller inclusions.
The most signiﬁcant tool for removal of smaller inclusions is filtration, which 
has been used for several decades. There are two main types of industrial ﬁltration 
(Altenpohl, 1998; Engh, 1992; Enright, 2007): cake and depth. A cake ﬁlter relies on 
pore openings smaller than the solid inclusions to stop inclusions at the surface, eventu­
ally piling them up into a cake of increasing thickness. Cake ﬁlters are highly effective, 
but the metallostatic pressure required to force metal through the cake makes their use 
impracticable and too expensive. As a result, cake ﬁlters are rarely used for ﬁltering 
molten aluminum, except in very small-volume foundry applications (Pyrotek, 2006).
Figure 12.3 illustrates depth ﬁltration (Aubrey and Smith, 1999; Engh, 1992). 
Depth ﬁltration relies on the attachment of solid particles to the inside walls of the 
ﬁlter, rather than blocking them at the surface. This prevents a cake from forming 
at the ﬁlter surface, minimizing the pressure-drop problem of cake ﬁlters. However, 
this happens only if the solid particles are much smaller than the pores of the ﬁlter. 
As a result, depth ﬁltration depends upon prior removal of the largest inclusions, usu­
ally by ﬂotation. A dual-ﬁlter arrangement is often used, in which a large-pore ﬁlter 
is backed by a smaller-pore ﬁlter.
Depth ﬁltration is designed primarily to remove inclusions of 5–20 μm diameter. 
The efﬁciency of these ﬁlters depends primarily on the following (Engh, 1992):
•	 Inclusion size (larger inclusions are easier to capture)
•	 Relative ﬁlter surface area per unit volume of melt
•	 Tortuosity (the fraction of ﬁlter surface facing the direction of metal ﬂow)
•	 Filter height
•	 Metal ﬂow velocity (lower is preferred, in part because higher ﬂow rates 
cause reentrainment of deposited particles)

211
Metal Refining and Purification
The difﬁculty with maximizing ﬁltration efﬁciency is designing a more effective 
ﬁlter without also increasing the required metallostatic head beyond an acceptable 
limit. Several solutions have been devised and will be described later in this chapter.
A signiﬁcant research effort has been made over the past decade to apply elec­
tromagnetic ﬁelds for the removal of inclusions from molten aluminum. These ﬁelds 
exert a force on inclusions in the melt, deﬁned by (Taniguchi et al., 2005)

The exerted force is greatest for nonconductive inclusions such as alumina. Several 
investigators have demonstrated the ability of electromagnetic ﬁltration to remove 
even small inclusions from molten alumina (Damoah and Zhang, 2012; Yoon et al., 
2007); making this technology compatible with existing melting and holding fur­
naces is a more signiﬁcant challenge. A recent approach that may be more practical 
is the application of electromagnetic ﬁelds to a depth ﬁlter to improve ﬁltration effec­
tiveness (Fritzsch et al., 2013).

REFINING STRATEGY
Figure 12.4, from the work of Waite (2002), illustrates a general ﬂowsheet for molten 
aluminum processing. While not every recycling facility uses all ﬁve of the steps 
shown here (in some facilities, the melting furnace and the casting furnace are the 
same), the reﬁning functions described earlier are carried out in one or more of the 
vessels shown here. The ﬁgure points out that the reﬁning sequence for primary 
metal from electrolytic cells is similar to that for secondary metal from remelting 
furnaces. As previously mentioned, the reﬁning principles and technology are simi­
lar as well.
The development of reﬁning technology over the past 25 years has focused on 
achieving several goals:
•	 Reducing alkali metal content, to 3 ppm or less
•	 Reducing inclusion levels (particularly 5–20 μm) to part-per-trillion levels
•	 Reducing hydrogen levels to 0.20 cm3/100 g or less
•	 Decreasing processing times
•	 Encouraging continuous instead of batch processing
•	 Decreasing or eliminating the use of chlorine gas
Melting furnace: The primary reﬁning step performed in melting furnaces is demag­
ging (Velasco and Nino, 2011). This requires the use of chlorine gas, as the demag­
ging ﬂuxes described previously are different in composition from the melting ﬂuxes 
used for absorbing oxide impurities. Previous chlorine-based demagging techniques 
were inefﬁcient and generated excessive levels of fugitive chlorine gas and chlo­
ride fumes. Gas injection pumps are more efﬁcient and are now used extensively 
for demagging (Pyrotek, 2006). They may also be useful for inclusion ﬂotation and 
alkali removal, although not to the levels required for product quality purposes. The 
ﬂuoride-based ﬂuxes used for dross removal during melting also help with magne­
sium and other alkali removal, as per reactions (12.16 through 12.18).
Crucible pretreatment: The use of crucible pretreatment is not universal, since 
improvements in other reﬁning technologies appear to have made it less necessary. 
However, it may still have advantages, especially for alkali removal. Haugen et al.

(2011) have demonstrated that alkali removal in the crucible can reduce dross for­
mation in the casting furnace by 25%–40%. One advantage of crucible treatment is 
that it allows the use of solid ﬂuxes as a replacement for chlorine gas. These ﬂuxes 
contain MgCl2 to carry out reactions (12.19) and (12.20); the MgCl2 is contained 
in a premelted mixture with KCl and NaCl, as described previously (Riverin et al., 
2006). Some crucible treatment processes use AlF3 instead. The development of a 
rotary ﬂux injector (Figure 12.5) has improved the efﬁciency of solid ﬂux injection 
over the previous lancing technique.
Casting furnace: In many facilities, the melting and casting furnaces are the 
same, and so the discussion of reﬁning practice in melting furnaces from Chapter 9 
applies here. If there is no crucible treatment facility, the casting furnace is where 
alkali removal and primary degassing take place. As Haugen et al. (2011) point out, 
this presents a problem. Reverberatory melting and casting furnaces are designed 
with heat transfer in mind and do not function well as chemical reactors. In addition, 
the time required to complete reﬁning in the furnace lowers productivity.
Reﬁning in casting furnaces was traditionally performed using stationary lances 
injecting a mixture of nitrogen and chlorine gas. The large bubble size and poor mix­
ing of these lances led to low effectiveness, wasted chlorine, and workplace hazards 
caused by the unreacted chlorine (Waite, 2002). As a result, the development of bet­
ter mixing technology is important in casting-furnace reﬁning. Rotary gas injectors 
(RGIs) were introduced in the 1970s and have largely replaced the lances (Chesonis 
et al., 2009). These devices feature a spinning rotor with an impeller at the end that 
breaks up gas bubbles as they are injected into the melt. Since their introduction, the 
development of improved impeller designs has become a small industry in itself (Mi 
et al., 2008); CFD simulation plays a major role in the process. Porous plugs have 
also been used as a gas delivery device (Gamweger and Schweiger, 2007); the ﬁner 
bubble size that these devices deliver shortens degassing time but eliminates the pos­
sibility of simultaneous ﬂuxing.

Figures 12.6 through 12.8, from the results of Hopkins et al. (1995), show the 
results achievable in a casting furnace using a rotary gas injection pump. Figure 12.6 
shows the hydrogen content of molten aluminum (~2.5% Mg) under different reﬁn­
ing conditions. As previously mentioned, the use of chlorine in the purge gas makes 
no difference in the reduction of hydrogen content. Figure 12.7 shows the inclusion 
content of the melt as a function of time; here, the impact of adding 5% Cl2 to the 
gas is obvious. Figure 12.8 shows the reduction of alkali content achievable when

using an Ar–5% Cl2 mixture. As a result of reactions (12.19) and (12.20), most of the 
calcium and sodium are removed without removing the magnesium as well. As the 
ﬁgures show, casting-furnace reﬁning is effective, especially at alkali and inclusion 
removal, but very slow and inefﬁcient. In addition, metal that has been degassed in 
the casting furnace regains its hydrogen content quickly while waiting to be cast 
(Enright, 2007). Because of this, the trend over the past generation has been to mini­
mize degassing in the casting furnace and replace it with in-line degassing and ﬁltra­
tion (Fielding, 1996; Leboeuf et al., 2007). In-line processes are designed speciﬁcally 
for hydrogen and inclusion removal. Their increased efﬁciency and kinetics justify 
the capital and operating costs of the additional processing (Williams et al., 2000).
In-line degassing: Figure 12.9 shows a cross section of the Spinning nozzle inert 
ﬂotation (SNIF) process, one of several in-line degassing devices introduced in the 
early 1980s. The device features a spinning (300–400 rpm) rotor inserted in the mol­
ten aluminum, through which a gas mixture (often Ar–5% Cl2) is fed. The spinning 
rotor breaks up the gas into very ﬁne bubbles, which increase the relative amount 
of surface area between the metal and the gas. This improves degassing kinetics 
and efﬁciency. The smaller bubbles also encourage removal of smaller inclusions. 
In-line devices like this are designed to operate continuously, with molten aluminum 
constantly being fed at the top and removed through a plug in the bottom. The vessel 
size is determined by the metal ﬂow-through rate and the time required to lower the 
hydrogen level to a desired value.
Since their introduction, a number of improvements have been made to in-line 
degassing units like this (Waite, 2002). The use of multiple stages generates lower 
hydrogen levels than a single unit of comparable size. The degassers are now sealed 
to prevent contact with air (Le Roy and Menet, 2007) and ﬂushed with argon to

reduce dross generation. Faster rotor speed (900 rpm in new Hycast units) results 
in even smaller bubble size and better kinetics (Steen et al., 2010). The most recent 
Alpur and Hycast devices include equipment for heating the metal, which is impor­
tant if molten metal is to be held in the unit between casts. Improved drainage has 
also been a priority, making it easier to change alloys with less wasted metal.
The newest trend in in-line degassing eliminates the degassing vessel altogether. 
Figure 12.10 illustrates the operating principle behind the Alcan Compact Degasser 
(ACD), which substitutes the casting trough for the degassing vessel (Lavoie et al., 
1996; Maltais et al., 2008). Bafﬂes located in the trough create the equivalent of a

multistage degassing vessel, with a rotary gas injector (RGI) for each compartment. 
Degassing and inclusion removal efﬁciencies in this device are similar to that of a 
degassing vessel; however, the use of the trough reduces the space requirement con­
siderably. In addition, use of a trough degasser eliminates metal retention between 
casts (Fielding, 1996). This is important in plants casting several alloys, since metal 
retained in a degassing vessel between casts must usually be drained and remelted. 
The most recent version of the ACD is also sealed, which reduces dross formation.
As previously mentioned, chlorine gas has traditionally been used to remove alka­
line impurities (Ca, Li, Na) from the melt. It also improves ﬂotation of inclusions. 
However, workplace hygiene concerns and the regulatory environment have pro­
vided increasing incentive for casthouses to adopt chlorine-free processing methods 
(Chesonis et al., 2009). This is done using equipment that injects MgCl2-containing 
ﬂuxes in place of the Cl2, using Ar as the carrier. The rotary ﬂux injector (RFI) 
replaces the RGI (Ohno, 2010); the Hycast™ Ram replaces the Hycast I-60 (Haugen 
et al., 2011); the Salt-ACD replaces the ACD (Robichaud et al., 2011). Performance 
in alkali removal and degassing is at least as good as that with chlorine gas injection; 
inclusion removal may be even better (Maltais et al., 2008). It is expected that the use 
of chlorine gas will disappear over time.
Filtration: Filtration of molten secondary aluminum has been practiced for 
several decades but has in recent years become increasingly important as product 
quality standards have tightened (Waite, 2002). As previously mentioned, almost 
all ﬁltration technology in molten aluminum uses the depth principle. However, 
numerous ﬁlter materials and ﬁltration devices exist within that category (Weaver, 
1997). The choice of ﬁltration technology depends on a number of factors, including 
the following:
•	 Type of product: Castings have a higher tolerance for inclusions than 
wrought product and may not require the same degree of ﬁltration.
•	 Plant production rate: Melting facilities with higher capacity can justify 
investing in more expensive types of ﬁltration equipment.
•	 Number of alloys produced: A facility that frequently changes alloy will 
avoid ﬁlters that retain a large volume of metal between casts.
•	 Available floor space: Some ﬁltration equipment has a much larger foot­
print than others.
•	 Type of inclusion: Most of the inclusions present in remelted scrap con­
sist of oxides, which interact better with some ﬁlter materials than others. 
However, the use of MgCl2-based ﬂuxes for alkali removal creates concern 
over the presence of small MgCl2 inclusions in the metal (DeYoung, 1999). 
Removing these requires different ﬁlter materials.
Weaver (1997) divides the ﬁlters used for molten aluminum into two groups: those 
meant for a single use and those that can be used for several times before replace­
ment. Multiple-use ﬁlters have a higher capital cost and a larger footprint. They 
also have higher capacities and lower operating costs, since they are replaced less 
often. As a result, they are more common in large-volume shops casting a limited 
number of alloys. Figure 12.11 illustrates the granular type of deep-bed filter (DBF),

which has been in use since the 1940s (Clement, 1995; DeYoung, 1999; Fielding, 
1996). Metal is fed through the bottom of the ﬁlter to reduce turbulence and ﬂows 
upward through a composite structure consisting of alumina balls (13–19 mm dia.) 
and gravel (3–6 mesh). A typical ﬂow rate through the ﬁlter is 0.1–0.4 cm/s; the low 
velocity improves ﬁltration efﬁciency. The supporting grid at the bottom distributes 
the metal evenly and reduces channeling. Heaters are used to maintain metal tem­
perature in the ﬁlter. Top-ﬂow DBFs are also available (Le Roy et al., 2007). DBFs 
are more effective than other types of ﬁlter but require ﬂushing to avoid off-spec 
metal during alloy changes.
Figure 12.12 shows a more recent type of multiple-use ﬁlter (Pyrotek, 2008), the 
rigid-media tube filter (RMTF), also known as a bonded-particle filter. The car­
tridge in the ﬁgure is a bundle of tubes made up of bonded ceramic particles (usually 
silicon carbide) with variable-size pores. Metal fed into the ﬁlter ﬂows through the 
pores into the inside of the tubes and from there to the outlet. The RMTF is the most 
efﬁcient ﬁlter available, but breakage of the tubes is a concern (DeYoung, 1999), and 
as a result its use in this form is not widespread.
Introduced in the 1970s, the single-use foam ﬁlter has become the most widely 
used in the industry (Pyrotek, 2008). Figure 12.13 shows several shapes of ceramic 
foam ﬁlter (CFF), which is produced by impregnating porous polyurethane foam 
with a ceramic slurry, allowing the slurry to dry, and ﬁring the foam (Chesonis 
et al., 2002; Parker et al., 1999). When the organic foam decomposes and vaporizes, 
the sintered ceramic structure left behind forms a framework capable of ﬁltering

molten metal. CFFs can be produced with a range of pore sizes and cost less than 
other ﬁlters (DeYoung, 1999). However, they are less efﬁcient than other ﬁlter 
materials (Fielding, 1996), limiting their usefulness. Figure 12.14 shows a com­
mon arrangement, a staged CFF (Aubrey and Smith, 1999; Chesonis et al., 2002). 
In this arrangement, a coarse ﬁlter occupies the top slot in the ﬁlter frame, and a 
ﬁner-pore ﬁlter the lower position. This improves capacity and improves capture 
efﬁciency for smaller inclusions.
Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve CFFs. The choice 
of ceramic material has been a topic of particular concern. CFFs are typically pro­
duced from slurries of phosphate-bonded alumina or silicon carbide (Foseco, 1998).

Aluminum Recycling
The more common alumina ﬁlters are brittle and tend to break in service, introduc­
ing large inclusions to the melt. In addition, the phosphate used for bonding can react 
over time with the molten aluminum, resulting in undesirable levels of phosphorus 
dissolved in the metal. Spent ﬁlters can react with atmospheric moisture, generating 
hazardous phosphine gas (Aubrey et al., 2010). Silicon carbide ﬁlters can also break 
in service and occasionally contribute silicon to low-Si alloys. Recent innovations 
include the following:
•	 Using a mixture of metallic aluminum powder and alumina in the slurry, 
which produces a ﬁner-grained structure when ﬁred (Luyten et al., 2006)
•	 Incorporating SiC and MgO in the slurry, which improves compressive 
strength and thermal shock resistance (Cao et al., 2007)
•	 Replacing the alumina with graphite (Foseco, 1998) or boron glass–bonded 
mullite (Aubrey et al., 2010)
•	 Coating the ﬁlter interior with molten ﬂux (Ni et al., 2006), which seems to 
improve capture of inclusions
The bonded-particle ﬁlter material described earlier can be manufactured in dis­
posable elements as well as tube cartridges. The elements are reusable, resulting in 
cost savings over single-use ceramic foam, and their higher efﬁciencies make them 
useful for applications requiring better removal of ﬁner inclusions (Keegan et al., 
1996). Other innovations include the development of multistage ﬁlters designed to 
remove liquid MgCl2 as well as solid inclusions and the production of ﬁlter materials 
for improved removal of nonoxide inclusions.
Figure 12.15, adapted from Enright (2007), demonstrates how degassing and CFF 
can reduce the concentration of inclusions in molten aluminum. The inclusions left 
after ﬁltration consist mostly of small carbides and MgO, and the oxide ﬁlm content

continuing challenge in molten aluminum puriﬁcation.

13 Dross Processing
The furnaces used for melting recycled aluminum generate three products. The 
ﬁrst is the molten aluminum, which is cast or transferred to customers. The second 
is the off-gas, which will be discussed in the next chapter. The third is a semi­
solid skim removed from the melt surface. This skim, better known as dross, is a 
mixture of molten aluminum metal and various oxide and chloride compounds. 
Its composition depends on the choice of melting practice and the amount and 
composition of ﬂuxes used. Regardless of composition, the processing of dross 
has always been important. Dross processing can (a) recover the valuable metal 
and salt content of the dross and (b) minimize the amount of waste material to 
be disposed of after treatment. This chapter will describe the choices available in 
dross treatment technology and the factors determining whether one technology is 
favored over another.
TYPES OF DROSS
In general, drosses fall into two categories: nonsalt dross and salt dross (Peterson, 
2011).
Nonsalt dross (better known as white or gray dross), the more common of the two 
types, is produced by melting facilities that melt without using ﬂux. These include 
all electric furnaces, reverberatory furnaces melting bulky scrap or ingot, and the 
holding furnaces used for primary aluminum. It can be generated in four ways (van 
Linden, 1997):
	
1.	During molten metal transfer, when the oxide skin on the metal surface 
ruptures, exposing new surface and generating more oxide (Prakash et al., 
2011).
	
2.	During melting and holding, when the oxide skin forms on the melt surface. 
Furnaces that directly expose metal to burner ﬂames tend to produce a lot 
of dross in this fashion. High-melt-loss types of scrap often have surface 
oxide present before melting starts and as a result generate more dross at 
this stage of the recycling process; thin-walled scrap is also more likely to 
generate dross during melting.
	
3.	During molten metal processing and reﬁning, when stirring and surface 
disruption create fresh surface for oxidation.
	
4.	As a result of metal spills or skulls. These are not drosses themselves but are 
often added to the dross recovered from the melt surface for remelting.
The amount of dross generated varies according to the type of scrap being 
melted; the International Aluminium Institute estimates that it ranges from 1% to 
5% of the charge for secondary smelters and 1% for primary smelters (Smith, 2008). 

228
Aluminum Recycling
Worldwide production of dross is estimated at 760,000 ton/year, about half from 
primary smelters and half from secondary.
The ﬁrst key to dross treatment is reducing the amount generated in the ﬁrst place. 
This can best be accomplished by minimizing the amount of surface disruption that 
takes place during melting. The use of level transfer rather than cascading during 
metal transfer is helpful, because it limits secondary ﬂows in the holding furnace or 
ladle after metal is poured from a crucible (Prakash et al., 2011). A more effective 
tactic is the submergence of scrap during melting to prevent surface disruption; the 
vortex technology described in Chapter 8 is an example. Keeping ﬂame tempera­
tures down during melting in stationary furnaces (i.e., reverbs) reduces oxidation, as 
does reducing temperature stratiﬁcation. Better charging practice to minimize direct 
metal contact with burner ﬂames also helps.
Figure 13.1 shows the light grey color of nonsalt dross (Urbach, 2011). It consists 
almost entirely of Al2O3 and aluminum metal trapped by the surface tension of the 
oxide skin. (Because of the amount of molten aluminum they contain, these drosses 
are sometimes called wet.) The metal content can vary from 15% to 80%, depending 
on the amount of melt loss and the sampling technique. Small amounts of aluminum 
carbide (Al4C3) and aluminum nitride (AlN) are also frequently present (Peterson, 
2011), caused by reactions that occur mostly after the dross has been removed from 
the furnace. Dross from primary smelting furnaces may also contain small levels 
of cryolite (Na3AlF6). This is the result of electrolytic cell bath accidentally being 
removed from the cells along with the molten aluminum. In scrap melting opera­
tions, if the alloy being remelted contains magnesium, the dross will also contain 
some periclase (MgO) and spinel (MgAl2O4). Magnesium is preferentially oxidized 
to aluminum during remelting and so is present in higher fractions in the dross than 
in the original alloy. About 1%–5% of the charged aluminum winds up in the dross 
(Peel et al., 2011).

229
Dross Processing
Figure 13.2 shows salt dross (also known as black dross), the skim produced by 
furnaces remelting scrap with the use of ﬂux (Peterson, 2011). This usually occurs 
during the remelting of smaller-sized or high-magnesium scrap and is most likely to 
be produced in sidewell reverberatory furnaces. Fluxing practice in reverbs has been 
previously described. Its purpose is to reduce metal losses by breaking up the oxide 
skin, thereby releasing the metal trapped inside. As a result, black dross usually con­
tains less than 20% aluminum metal and 30%–50% aluminum oxide; the rest is the 
ﬂuxing salt (mostly sodium chloride and potassium chloride). About 300–700 kg of 
black dross is generated per tonne of aluminum generated in a secondary smelting 
furnace (Romberg, 2007).
A third solid waste produced by some aluminum melting furnace is a material 
called salt cake. This will be described later.
PROCESSING OPTIONS FOR DROSS
HoT PRoCEssInG
Figure 13.3 presents a hierarchy of options for processing and treatment of dross. 
The ﬁrst option is whether to allow the skimmed dross to cool and solidify or to pro­
cess it immediately after skimming, while the entrapped aluminum is still molten. 
Hot processing has two advantages:
	
1.	It allows the operation to retain the heat energy present in the dross when it 
was ﬁrst skimmed. If the dross is allowed to solidify, additional energy will 
be required to reheat it for further processing.
	
2.	It offers greater potential recovery of the metal in the dross, since repro­
cessing occurs before the metal has a chance to oxidize.

Technologies, Inc., Kendallville, IN.)

230
Aluminum Recycling
However, there are also disadvantages:
	
1.	Equipment used for processing semimolten dross at 750°C–800°C is expen­
sive to build and maintain.
	
2.	Hot dross processing must be synchronized with production schedules in 
the melting furnaces.
	
3.	Hot dross is subject to thermiting. Thermiting is the oxidation of the metal 
in the dross to form aluminum oxide or nitride (Peterson, 2011):
2Al + 1.5O2 = Al2O3
(13.1)
Al + 0.5N2 = AlN
(13.2)
As the name suggests, thermiting is an exothermic (heat-generating) process. 
Uncontrolled, it can heat the dross to temperatures that can damage equipment. 
Furthermore, thermiting turns much of the metal in the dross into relatively worth­
less oxide. As a result, hot dross processing requires special techniques to minimize 
or eliminate thermiting.
Many traditional hot dross treatment processes involve heating the dross in a rotary 
salt furnace (RSF). As a result, the simplest way to retain the energy in hot dross is to 
simply charge it directly to the RSF without solidifying it ﬁrst (Peel et al., 2011). The 
difﬁculty in doing this is synchronizing the skimming of the dross from the melting

Dross Processing
furnace and the operating cycle of the dross processing furnace. This can be solved 
either by treating the two as a single process under the control of one operator or by 
using special holders as a buffer, supplying an argon gas blanket to prevent thermiting 
(Spoel and Zebedee, 1996). Even so, coordinating activities between the multiple melt­
ing furnaces in a typical casthouse and a RSF often recommend a different practice.
A second approach to hot dross treatment involves agitating the dross to break 
the oxide skin surrounding the molten metal, allowing the metal to coalesce and 
ultimately be recovered. The metal reclaim machine, used extensively in east Asia, 
does this with an agitating impeller, recovering about 40% of the metal in the dross 
(Herbert, 2007; Okazaki et al., 1999). However, stirring tends to promote thermiting 
and turns the remaining dross into a ﬁne dusty material from which further metal 
recovery is difﬁcult. The more recent Drosrite process does this in a rotary furnace 
rotating at three revolutions per minute (Drouet et al., 2000). Drosrite uses an argon 
purge to solve the thermiting process. The AROS dross cooling unit also performs a 
similar function, as will be described later.
Two other hot dross processing technologies use pressure to squeeze the mol­
ten aluminum loose from the oxide skin. The ﬁrst is the dross press. Figure 13.4 
illustrates the basic principle behind dross pressing. Dross poured into the space 
between the press head and steel shell is squeezed by a hydraulic ram (Peel et al., 
2011). Molten metal pours through the metallic drain in the center and into a sow 
mold. At the same time, the remaining dross is solidiﬁed. The solidiﬁed shell, a 
mixture of metal and oxide/salt, is removed for further processing. The amount 
of metal recovered is a function of press head design and the metal content of

the dross, but 60%–70% metal recovery is typical (Herbert, 2007). Optimal head 
design is an evolving concept, with extensive testing of new designs in recent years 
(Peel et al., 2011; Perry, 2000). Air cooling of the head is now standard, which 
improves dross cooling rates and further decreases metal losses by minimizing 
thermiting. The reduced thermiting in turn reduces aluminum carbide and nitride 
formation in the dross. Because of this, dross presses are currently the most popular 
choice for new dross cooling equipment. A less-expensive variation of this is the 
cooling head, which is simply set on top of the molten dross after it has been placed 
on a skim pan. The weight of the cooling head pushes 40%–60% of the metal in 
the dross through the holes in the skim pan. This simpler device is preferable for 
smaller operations.
The other use of pressure to squeeze molten aluminum loose from hot dross is 
centrifuging. In the Ecocent process (Ünlü and Drouet, 2002), hot dross is put in 
a converter and heated to 750°C (cold dross can also be charged) and stirred to 
homogenize it. The heated dross is then poured into a centrifuge (Figure 13.5), which 
forces the liquid metal through a screen against the side of the centrifuge. The cen­
trifuge can generate either a ring of solidiﬁed metal for recharging to a furnace or 
molten metal that can be tapped from the bottom of the unit. Recovery of up to 
90% of the input metal is claimed. Because the dross press and centrifuge are batch 
processes, they can be used any time a fresh supply of dross is skimmed from the 
furnace, eliminating the coordination problem associated with RSFs.
DRoss CooLInG OPTIons
If the dross is not processed hot, it must be cooled. Dross cooling converts the mate­
rial to a solid form suitable for storage or shipment and prevents the loss of metal

Dross Processing
content by thermiting. Several technologies have been developed for dross cooling. 
Selecting the best means judging the alternatives against these criteria:
•	 Minimizes thermiting and loss of metal value
•	 Minimizes capital and operating costs
•	 Minimizes environmental impact
•	 Minimizes hazards to operating personnel
•	 Is logistically compatible with plant operations
The oldest approach to dross cooling is to simply spread the material on the ﬂoor 
and let it cool naturally (Herbert, 2007; Summer, 2009). While this has the low­
est capital and operating cost of any option, it also results in the loss of about 70% 
of the metal value through thermiting. It also generates large quantities of oxide 
fume, which is hazardous both to plant personnel and to local air quality. In addition, 
the burning aluminum is a safety hazard to plant personnel. Some shops have tried 
spreading the dross on steel plates to encourage heat transfer and accelerate cool­
ing. Pouring the dross into a water-cooled vibrating chute has also been tried, which 
offers some improvement. However, none of these open-air approaches eliminates 
the problems of ﬂoor spreading. As a result, they are gradually being abandoned.
Some use has been made of specially designed skimming boxes in which the 
dross is left to cool in a solid block. Thermiting can be limited by adding a salt 
blanket to cover the material and limit access to air (Figure 13.6). This process 
is slow and levies a ﬁnancial penalty in the form of (a) the cost of providing the 
salt blanket or (b) metal losses from thermiting. An improved approach replaces 
the salt blanket with a cover that seals the dross container and prevents air access 
(Figure 13.7; Urbach, 2010). Improving the concept still further, the inert gas dross 
cooler (Figure 13.8) developed by Alcan provides an argon cover to exclude air 
(Herbert, 2007; Taylor and Gagnon, 1995), improving metal recovery over simple 
skimming boxes by 20%. However, dross cooled this way solidiﬁes into a massive

block, requiring crushing to recover the metal. Dust generation is eliminated but 
subsequent processing costs are higher.
Introduced in the late 1970s, the rotary dross cooler was widely adopted in the 
1980s for cooling and solidifying both salt and nonsalt drosses (Herbert, 2007; 
McMahon, 1990). Figure 13.9 illustrates the layout of a typical rotary dross cooler. 
The centerpiece of the device is a rotating drum fabricated from structural steel 
plate, with welded internal ﬂights to help raise the dross as the drum rotates. Water 
is sprayed onto the outside of the top of the drum, ﬂowing around the outside and 
collecting in a pool at the bottom. As it does, it extracts heat from the dross inside.

235
Dross Processing
Some of the water vaporizes and leaves through the vapor hood at the top. 
Replacement water is added through a nozzle at the side. Although thermiting is 
reduced by the more rapid cooling in this unit, some does occur, and in addition the 
tumbling action crumbles the dross, generating more dust. As a result, dust collec­
tion hoods are located at both ends of the unit. Even so, the safety hazard presented 
by the dust and the presence of molten aluminum in the vicinity of a pool of water 
has decreased the popularity of rotary dross cooling in recent years.
Dross added to the cooler spends 5–15 min in the unit, during which its tempera­
ture is reduced below 50°C. The tumbling action reduces its size, making it easier 
to subsequently crush and screen. A trommel screen at the discharge end removes 
oversize material (+50 mm is typical). The oversize has a much higher metal content 
than the undersize, so it can be directly returned to the melting furnaces or further 
processed to remove more of the nonmetallic content. Overall aluminum recovery is 
50%–60% (Herbert, 2007). Screen undersize is sent on for RSF melting or further 
solid processing.
The use of rotary dross cooling can improve metal recoveries by up to 50% over 
ﬂoor spreading, but the lack of an inert environment means that thermiting is still 
a concern, limiting overall recoveries to 40%–45% of the contained metal. Two 
approaches have been taken to solve the problem. Figure 13.10 illustrates the AROS 
dross cooler, introduced in the early 1980s (Roberts, 1990). The unit is sealed to 
minimize air intrusion and thus reduce thermiting. The water spray is replaced by a 
jacket placed around the central cooling drum. Cooled dross is discharged into the 
outside grinding drum, which turns with the cooling drum. Large lumps of metal 
in the discharge act as the grinding balls in this drum, knocking pieces of oxide 
and salt loose from the larger metal particles. A screen built into the grinding drum 
separates a coarse fraction (>8 mm), analyzing more than 90% metal. This material

can be directly remelted. Undersize from this screen is fed through a second screen 
built into the unit shell; the oversize from this fine screen (>0.2 mm) also analyzes 
75%–80% metal. This product is sent for further upgrading. The undersize from the 
second screen, along with dust collected in the baghouse, is combined into a dust 
fraction. The metal content of the dust is less than 25% and can either be further 
processed for salt recovery or landﬁlled.
The second solution is to provide an inert environment (argon or nitrogen) to the 
rotary gas cooler. This improved metal recoveries by 15% over rotary dross cooling 
in air. Whether this improvement justiﬁes the cost of the argon is uncertain.

indicate metal recovered by drainage from the processing unit; darker regions indi­
cate aluminum recovery from subsequent rotary furnace processing. As might be 
expected, more expensive methods tend to produce the best results; whether the 
value of the additional metal recovered justiﬁes the higher equipment cost depends 
upon a variety of factors.
CoMMInUTIon
With the exception of AROS units, dross coolers generate a product with a wide size 
range, from dust to chunks of several centimeters. As previously mentioned, the larg­
est chunks have high enough metal content to remelt, while smaller pieces require 
upgrading to separate the metal from the oxide/salt content. Again, the dross pro­
cessor has an option. Crushing the cooled dross will better liberate the metal from 
the attached oxides and salt, generating a product that is easier to directly remelt. 
However, both the capital and operating costs of crushing can be high, and the dust 
generated during crushing is an environmental concern. As a result, cooled nonsalt 
dross with over 50% metallic aluminum content is often fed directly to RSFs, while 
salt and lower-grade nonsalt drosses are crushed and upgraded to produce a concen­
trate with sufﬁcient aluminum content.
Dross comminution is a multistage process, beginning with reduction of the 
largest chunks (>20 cm). This is typically performed using a shaft impactor or 
jaw crusher (Roth, 2011; Smith, 2008). The product is screened, and the oversize 
(>2.5 cm) material is returned to the melting furnace. The undersize from the screen 
is subsequently milled. Hammer mills have typically been used for this purpose, 
but cage mills may be more effective at crushing the nonmetallic particles without 
destroying the metal particles as well (Roth and Beevis, 1995). The mill product is 
again screened (300–500 μm); undersize is disposed of or processed to recover the 
salt, while oversize is used in RSFs to recover the metal.
Figure 13.12 shows the rotary tumbler (Roth, 2011). Originally developed in the 
1970s for metal recovery from spent foundry sand, this device (currently in its third 
iteration) combines primary and secondary crushing, screening out large metal 
chunks as it processes dross.

MELTInG OPTIons: RoTARY SALT FURnACE
Developed in the mid-1960s, the RSF is the primary method for recovering alu­
minum from dross. It is primarily used to treat high-grade nonsalt drosses and the 
concentrates produced by milling and screening salt and low-grade nonsalt drosses. 
There are several varieties of RSF, but the operating principle is similar.
Figure 13.13 illustrates a typical RSF. The furnace operates on a batch basis, 
with a total charge of 5–10 tons per batch (Gripenberg et al., 1995). The charge is a 
mixture of dross and/or dross concentrate, along with ﬂuxing salt. The ﬂuxing salt 
composition is a eutectic mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride, similar 
to that used in ﬂuxed melting operations. As before, a ﬂux with a few percent of an 
added ﬂuoride salt (typically cryolite) helps to break the oxide skin around the mol­
ten aluminum as the contents are heated (Shell et al., 1995; also see Chapter 7). This 
allows the molten aluminum to coalesce, increasing recovery. The added salt also 
protects the metal underneath from oxidation by forming a molten blanket on top. 
The amount of salt added varies with the composition of the added dross, ranging 
from 50 to 500 kg of added salt per tonne of charged dross. In older RSFs, the goal 
is for the mass of salt to equal the mass of nonmetallic oxides in the dross. In newer 
furnaces, a lower ratio (0.2:1–0.4:1) is used. In either case, a higher-grade charge will 
use less salt than a low-grade charge.
In its typical conﬁguration, energy is provided to the RSF by an air/fuel burner 
input through the side. Heat transfer from the ﬂame to the charge is hindered by 
the molten salt layer on top, which has poor thermal conductivity. This problem is 
solved in the RSF by rotating the furnace. The refractories above the bath are heated 
by the ﬂame. As the furnace rotates, the heated refractories move below the bath line

and transfer heat to the charge. RSFs can be ﬁred with natural gas (more common) 
or fuel oil. The use of oxy-fuel burners has spread from scrap melting operations to 
RSFs, for the same reasons (Smith, 2008). The reduced nitrogen output from the 
furnace improves thermal efﬁciency, and the higher ﬂame temperature increases the 
heat-transfer rate to the refractory. The use of regenerative burners has also spread 
from melting furnaces to RSFs. Fuel usage in an air/natural gas furnace is 3500–
4000 kJ/kg of dross melted. When oxy-fuel burners and double-pass regenerators 
are installed, this ﬁgure can be reduced by as much as two-thirds. The use of oxy-
fuel burners also allows the furnace to be sealed during operation (Peterson, 2011), 
allowing melting to take place in a reducing environment. This reduces melt loss and 
further reduces the need for ﬂux.
Heating times are a function of the mass of charge and the heat-transfer rate. 
In older RSFs, tap-to-tap time can be 4 h or longer; in newer units, as little as 1. 
Nontilting RSFs generate two products. The ﬁrst is molten aluminum, which is 
cast and sold as RSI. The second is a liquid nonmetallic product, which is cast into 
blocks known as salt cake. The salt cake (Figure 13.14) has a composition similar 
to that of salt dross and still contains 2%–10% metallic aluminum. Recoveries vary, 
but extracting 75% of the charged aluminum is not unusual. Salt-cake generation is 
­200–500 kg per metric ton of secondary aluminum produced (Tsakiridis, 2012).
The standard-model RSF has several drawbacks, the ﬁrst of which is the pro­
duction of liquid salt cake (wet processing). Tapping two liquid products from the 
furnace inevitably results in contamination, which can hurt metal purity or reduce 
recoveries. As a result, several dross processors now use a tiltable rotating barrel 
furnace (Gripenberg et al., 2002; Herbert, 2007; Smith, 2008). Furnaces like this 
(Figure 13.15) allow the molten aluminum to be decanted from the vessel ﬁrst, so 
that a second liquid product is no longer needed. As a result, a dry dross smelting 
process can be used, in which the salt usage is reduced by half and a solid salt cake 
(5%–12% Al, 25%–50% ﬂux, remainder oxides) is produced. This reduces materials 
FIGURE 13.14  Salt cake. (Photograph courtesy of Ralf Urbach.)

Aluminum Recycling
and energy costs and makes product removal easier. Charging clean scrap along with 
dross reduces the salt requirement still further.
However, even the dry process requires salt additions. This results in salt vapor 
emissions from the furnace, along with the production of salt cake. The salt cake is 
expensive to process, as will be discussed later, and cannot be landﬁlled in many 
countries. As a result, considerable efforts have been made over the past 20 years to 
develop salt-free methods for recovering aluminum from nonsalt dross.
SALT-FREE PRoCEssEs
Initial attempts to operate rotary barrel furnaces without ﬂux were unsuccessful, 
largely because the lack of a salt cover allowed thermiting to occur. The exothermic 
reaction caused rapid heating of the charge, which increased the thermiting still 
further (Peterson, 2011). As a result, metal recoveries were poor (55%–60%) and 
frequent relining was required. In response to this, development efforts produced 
four new salt-free melting technologies (Simonian, 2001).
The simplest of the four is ALUREC (Figure 13.16), developed by AGA in part­
nership with Hoogovens Aluminium and MAN GHH (Gripenberg et al., 1995, 1997). 
ALUREC uses an oxy-fuel burner as an energy source, with a sealed furnace door 
to keep air out. Replacing air with pure oxygen eliminates nitrogen from the furnace 
environment. This reduces the ﬂame size, meaning less direct heating of the dross. 
It also increases ﬂame temperature, improving heat transfer to the walls and increas­
ing the heating rate of the charge. As with other salt-free processes, ALUREC relies 
on the mixing generated by furnace rotation to break the oxide skin on the metal in 
the dross, allowing it to coalesce. Operation of a pilot plant at Hoogovens yielded 
recovery of up to 90% of the metal in the dross, with fuel usage of less than 1300 
kJ/kg of dross processed. The solid salt cake recovered from the furnace is half of 
that resulting from RSF processing. Reducing the amount of ﬂux to purchase and the 
amount of salt cake to process gave ALUREC a 45% cost advantage over standard

Dross Processing
RSF processing. However, ALUREC technology has not become widespread due to 
high capital costs and lower recoveries.
The most widely publicized of the four processes is the plasma dross treat­
ment technology introduced in the early 1990s by Alcan (Ünlü and Drouet, 2002). 
Figure 13.17 shows a simpliﬁed view of a nontransferred-arc plasma torch. A gas

Aluminum Recycling
Applying high-voltage power to the torch generates an electric arc between the elec­
trodes that heats the gas to plasma temperatures (>5000°C). Gases this hot give off 
nearly all of their available heat by radiation, resulting in much higher thermal efﬁ­
ciency than that of an RSF. As a result, gas usage is minimal, resulting in much lower 
off-gas volumes than RSF. This reduces oxidation and results in metal recoveries 
of over 95%. Again, salt-free processing yields the same advantages as previously 
described. However, plasma dross processing has also not succeeded commercially. 
High electricity prices and high capital costs are the likely causes.
Figure 13.18 shows a DROSCAR transferred-arc plasma furnace, using graphite 
electrodes (Drouet et al., 1994, 1995; Meunier et al., 1999). Again, the application of 
high voltage causes an arc to be struck between the electrodes, generating high temper­
atures and heat transfer by radiation to the walls and directly to the charge. As with the 
other salt-free processes, the DROSCAR process seals the furnace to keep air out. As a 
result, gas volumes are even lower than for the nontransferred-arc plasma (3 m3/ton of 
processed dross vs. 30 for the Alcan furnace—RSF processing generates 300 m3/ton). 
An argon environment is provided to stabilize the arc; this also reduces thermiting and 
limits the formation of aluminum nitride. This results in metal recoveries similar to 
the other salt-free processes. Again, high electricity costs can be a concern, and lumpy 
dross pieces can break the electrodes as they tumble during furnace rotation.
SALT CAKE AnD SALT DRoss PRoCEssInG
As previously pointed out, it is common practice to recover much of the aluminum 
from salt dross by crushing and concentration. However, this still leaves a salt-cake 
residue, consisting of ﬂux salts (25%–60%), aluminum nitride, metallic aluminum 
(4%–10%), and various oxides (Tsakiridis, 2012; Urbach, 2011). The salt content is 
higher in salt cake from ﬁxed rotary furnaces and lower from that in tiltable fur­
naces. Land-based disposal of this material is still economically feasible in the 
United States but is either banned or too expensive elsewhere. Because of this, fur­
ther treatment is required. The goals of this further processing include the following:
•	 Minimizing or eliminating the residue to be discarded
•	 Generating a nonhazardous residue that can be discarded if necessary

Dross Processing
•	 Recovering the salt content in the feed
•	 Recovering the metallic aluminum in the feed
•	 Reduced cost and complexity for the process
•	 Minimizing environmental impact of the process
Figure 13.19 illustrates a basic process used for most salt-cake treatment (Sheth 
et al., 1996; Tsikiridis, 2012). The feed has been crushed and screened as previously 
described to remove most of the aluminum metal. Since the water will have to be 
removed later, only enough is added to produce a brine with about 22%–25% dis­
solved salt content. The salts (primarily NaCl and KCl) generate heat when they 
dissolve, raising brine temperatures as high as 60°C. The solid–liquid separator is 
usually a two-stage process, beginning with a centrifuge, which separates out most of 
the NMP (Non-metallic product, i.e., the oxide and metal content). The liquid leaving 
the centrifuge is then passed into a clariﬁer, which generates a sludge containing the 
rest of the NMP. This is washed and ﬁltered, resulting in a low-salt NMP that can be 
landﬁlled or possibly used for other purposes. This puriﬁes the brine and also removes 
solids such as calcium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide. These can cause scaling in 
the crystallizer if not removed.
The brine generated by dissolution is then processed to remove the water. This 
is usually done with an evaporator crystallizer. These crystallizers have tradition­
ally been multi-effect forced circulation units, but mechanical vapor recompression 
systems have higher efﬁciencies and have become a preferred option. More recent 
development by Engitec has promoted the use of ﬂash evaporation crystallization 
(Sheth et al., 1996). This reduces energy requirements, at the cost of additional pro­
cess complexity. The result of crystallization is wet salt crystals that are subsequently 
air dried and reused as ﬂux. The potassium chloride in melting ﬂux is preferentially 
vaporized during melting, so the salt recovered from the brine has a higher NaCl/
KCl ratio than the salt used as ﬂux. Purchased KCl is added to bring the ratio back 
to the desired level.

Aluminum Recycling
The energy costs of salt recovery from salt-cake processing can be substantial and 
may not be justiﬁed by the value of the recovered salt. If the salt-cake treatment facil­
ity is located near the ocean, the brine solution can be simply diluted and returned to 
the sea, saving the cost of having to recover the salt (Smith, 2008).
The NMP recovered from the process consists of alumina and other oxides, with 
some aluminum nitride and possibly some aluminum carbide (Tsakiridis, 2012). It 
also contains a small amount of remaining metal, and this poses a problem. When 
the aluminum nitride is exposed to moisture, alumina and oxide are produced:
2AlN + 3H2O = 2NH3 + Al(OH)3
(13.3)
2AlN + 4H2O = Al(OH)3 + NH4OH
(13.4)
The alkaline environment strips the oxide coating from the aluminum particles in 
the NMP, and this allows moisture to react with the metal and generate hydrogen:
3H2O + 2Al = Al2O3 + 3H2 (+ heat)
(13.5)
The presence of hydrogen and heat is a ﬁre and explosion hazard, and this makes 
the disposal of NMP a problem. Aluminum carbide in the NMP engages in simi­
lar reactions, generating methane and possibly other hazardous by-products. As 
a result, disposal of this material is still potentially hazardous, and several of its 
potential uses—cement production, use in the production of calcium aluminate—are 
impacted as well.

14 Safety and Environmental 
Considerations
In addition to its economic advantages, aluminum recycling has desirable environ­
mental beneﬁts. Chapter 1 pointed out that production of aluminum from recycled 
sources reduces CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by 90% compared with primary 
metal, in addition to reducing ﬂuoride and SO2 emissions. The production of sec­
ondary metal reduces energy usage by over 90% compared with primary metal and 
reduces the amount of waste generated by 90%.
However, the technology of aluminum recycling presents potential hazards of its 
own to both the work force and the general public. As the tolerance of the public for 
these hazards decreases, the need to improve the performance of recycling opera­
tions grows. This last chapter will explore the unique hazards of aluminum recycling 
and describe the measures taken in response. The result of these measures will be an 
industry that moves into the future with conﬁdence in its value to society.
COLLECTION AND BENEFICIATION
Chapter 3 described the two basic types of metal scrap, new and old. New scrap is that 
obtained directly from manufacturing operations, while old scrap is obtained from 
discarded manufactured items. The fraction of new scrap that is recycled is higher 
than that of old scrap; however, the fraction of old scrap being recycled is increasing, 
due to the limited amount of new scrap available and the cost of producing primary 
aluminum in some parts of the world (Europe in particular).
Statistics are difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the relative hazards of employment in scrap 
collection and beneﬁciation. The US Department of Labor (BLS, 2012) currently 
maintains industrial injury data for two industry classiﬁcations: “recyclable mate­
rial merchant wholesalers” and “materials recovery facilities.” The ﬁrst classiﬁcation 
includes wholesalers handling a wide variety of recyclables, including boxes, glass, 
rubber, and fur cuttings as well as metallic scrap (United States Census Bureau, 
2012). The second classiﬁcation includes both public facilities (MRFs, described 
in Chapter 6) and private sorting facilities. Table 14.1 compares injury rate data 
for workers in these classiﬁcations with those for private industry as a whole for 
three recent years (the only ones for which data are available). The results show a 
higher rate of both overall injuries and serious injuries in recycling-related indus­
tries. Statistics compiled by the British Health and Safety Executive (HSE, 2012) 
show that major injuries in the waste management and recycling industry happen at 
over four times the rate as industry as a whole. Neitzel et al. (2013) have shown high 
risks for a number of speciﬁc hazards at scrap yards, in particular noise, repetitive 
motion, and laceration/abrasion hazards.

248
Aluminum Recycling
In general, the collection of new scrap presents fewer hazards and ­environmental 
concerns than that of old scrap. Because new scrap is produced in a limited number 
of locations, it is easier to collect and rarely requires separation from other materi­
als. New scrap is purer and so requires less processing; impurities that might pose 
workplace or environmental hazards are less likely to be present. Finally, new scrap 
is a known and contains fewer surprises. The increasing number of captive recy­
cling operations that accept scrap from one industrial facility and return secondary 
ingot directly to that facility makes processing new scrap even less hazardous.
Old scrap is more difﬁcult to process safely and presents several hazards. These 
include the following:
•	 Hazardous chemicals: All sorts of chemicals are put in aluminum containers, 
and recovering these chemicals without exposure of the workforce or the gen­
eral public can be difﬁcult. Larger items such as discarded automobiles and 
appliances are especially likely to contain ﬂuids (PCB-containing oils, refrig­
erants) requiring special handling (Bertram et al., 2007; Dougherty, 2000).
•	 Labor usage: Because old aluminum scrap has to be separated from other 
materials, recycling is often labor intensive. The use of hand sorting was 
discussed in Chapter 6; disassembly of large items such as ships or air­
craft is also done largely by hand. This exposes workers to the hazards 
(heat, noise, dust) normally associated with this type of work, in addi­
tion to the unique hazards of demolition work (falling objects, asbestos 
in ship breaking). Cutting equipment such as shears or saws can be espe­
cially hazardous. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA, 2008) lists contact with an object or piece of equipment and 
overextension as two of the most common causes of lost-time injuries in 
scrap metal processing.

Safety and Environmental Considerations
•	 Explosive material: Mention was brieﬂy made in Chapter 6 of the problems 
posed by aerosol cans in scrap. Shredded under pressure, these cans can 
explode (BAMA, 2002), and the contents can make the explosion worse if 
they are ﬂammable. Military scrap can also contain explosive material if 
not properly decommissioned (Jacoby, 2000; Minter, 2006). Items as small 
as a butane lighter can become an explosion hazard if not spotted (Bertram 
et al., 2007).
•	 Radioactive material: Although no radioactive aluminum alloys are com­
mercially produced, mixed scrap can contain other radioactive sources that 
have not been properly disposed of. These radiation sources can contami­
nate an entire recycling facility if not caught and isolated quickly (Bertram 
et al., 2007).
•	 Location issues: Many scrap yards were located on the edge of town when 
they ﬁrst began operating several decades ago. These yards now ﬁnd them­
selves in the middle of an expanded urban area. The residents of adjacent 
neighborhoods ﬁnd scrap collectors and processors an undesirable neigh­
bor, and the heavy equipment and hazardous chemicals represent a threat 
to those living near as well as working at the yard (Dallas Morning News, 
2011; Malloy, 2011; Woodin, 2012).
The response to these hazards varies considerably with location and the type of 
scrap upgrading technology used. However, several common strategies are available. 
These include the following:
•	 Automation: Although hand picking is still widely practiced in Third World 
countries, the hazards that it poses to the workforce are increasingly unac­
ceptable in more advanced societies. As a result, minerals processing tech­
nology (optical sorting, speciﬁc gravity separation, eddy current devices) is 
replacing hand pickers in many locations.
•	 Improved equipment: The equipment used by scrap processors is much safer 
to operate than it was a generation ago. Shears have guards to protect oper­
ators; hammer mills have exhaust ﬁlters to remove dust; explosion-proof 
shredders are designed to withstand the impact of an exploding aerosol can 
or ﬂammable gas mixture. A current focus is improving baler safety, using 
devices that sense when an operator is in the main chamber and prevent the 
ram from activating (OSHA, 2008).
•	 Collection by type: The hazards of processing old scrap differ according 
to the product being recycled. UBCs have lacquer coatings not found on 
automotive scrap; discarded automobiles contain motor oil and ﬂuids not 
found in UBCs. Separating old scrap by product type makes it easier to 
deal with these hazards. Automobiles and UBCs are already processed 
separately in dedicated facilities in many locations, as are aircraft and 
old electrical cable (see Chapter 6). Efforts are being made to separate 
white goods into a distinct processing stream as well (GIZ, 2011; Ludwig, 
1996).

250
Aluminum Recycling
•	 Regulation of scrap and sorting facilities: Increasingly, governments have 
become involved in directing the movement of scrap and the operation 
of facilities for processing (Los Angeles County, 2011). The goals of the 
regulatory process include eliminating the uncontrolled dumping of haz­
ardous chemicals recovered from scrap, protection of the general public 
from noise and discharges from the facility, and ensuring worker safety 
(Headland Multimedia, 2012; Missouri Department of Natural Resources, 
2004; OSHA, 2008). In some cases, scrap yards in populated areas have 
been forced to close or curtail operations. The regulatory process often goes 
hand-in-hand with the writing of standards (see the following).
•	 Development of standard operating practices: The development of safe 
work practice in scrap yards and MRFs until recently followed standards 
used at construction sites (Glenn, 1998). These are of limited value, since 
the equipment used for tearing items apart is different from that used for 
putting things together. However, two US initiatives have recently been 
announced to develop more industry-speciﬁc standards. The ﬁrst is the pub­
lication of ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Z245.41, which 
applies to MRF operations. More recently, the industry group ISRI has 
developed RIOS (Recycling Industries Operating Standard), which stan­
dardizes responses to environmental issues (Wagger, 2010). OSHA (2008) 
lists numerous operating standards applicable to different unit processes in 
scrap collection, sorting, and processing.
THERMAL PROCESSING AND MELTING
Facilities that remelt aluminum scrap receive raw material both from scrap proces­
sors that upgrade old scrap and directly from producers of new scrap. As a result, the 
environmental and safety hazards faced by processors are also present at remelting 
facilities. Additional hazards include the following (Bertram et al., 2007; Jacoby, 
2000):
•	 Water: There are numerous potential sources of water in melting and cast­
ing facilities (Ekenes, 2007); however, the most serious accidents usu­
ally arise from charging wet scrap (Epstein, 2007). Moisture comes with 
scrap either as trapped liquid, as snow and ice accumulated during storage 
(Pluchon et al., 2011), or as rainwater collected during transportation. In 
any case, it is a signiﬁcant safety hazard. If water is charged to a melting 
furnace along with the scrap, the resulting steam explosion can injure or kill 
plant personnel and damage equipment. The problem is serious enough that 
separate statistics are speciﬁcally kept for steam explosions.
•	 Rust: Rust is hydrated iron oxide (Fe2O3). It represents a safety hazard 
because of its reactivity with molten aluminum:
	
Fe2O3 + 2Al (l) = 2Fe (l) + Al2O3
(14.1)

251
Safety and Environmental Considerations
This thermite reaction is highly exothermic, to the point of being explosive (Ekenes, 
2007; Pierce et al., 2005). The excess heat caused by the reaction can also lead to 
more oxidation of the molten metal, further increasing melt loss.
•	 High-temperature toxics: These are chemicals that pose no hazard dur­
ing ambient-temperature processing and handling but give off toxic fumes 
when heated (Bertram et al., 2007). The organic coatings on UBCs are a 
good example of this; the selenium and arsenic coating of photoreceptor 
tubes is another.
•	 Fines and dust: These can be generated during shredding or wire chop­
ping and collect on the ﬂoor of storage bins or in the dust collection system 
(Bertram et al., 2007; Léon, 2005; Pierce et al., 2005). The resulting explo­
sions can be catastrophic (CSHIB, 2005).
•	 High-temperature explosives: The reaction of nitrate chemicals with molten 
aluminum when charged with a scrap load is a notorious safety problem in 
remelting operations. The most common source is ammonium nitrate from 
discarded fertilizer (Bertram et al., 2007; Pierce et al., 2005). The ammo­
nium phosphate in discarded ﬁre extinguishers also reacts violently with 
molten aluminum. Oxidized material has on occasion been mistaken for 
ﬂux, with deadly results (Caniglia, 2004). A growing problem is that of air 
bags and seatbelt pretensioners from automobiles, which contain explosive 
sodium azide. Most of these are detonated in the shredder, but some occa­
sionally make it through intact.
•	 Chlorine gas and/or flux: Mention was made in Chapter 12 of the desire by 
the aluminum industry to reduce and if possible replace the use of chlorine 
gas in reﬁning operations (DeYoung and Levesque, 2005). One important 
reason for this is the emissions that result from the use of chlorine, which 
include both Cl2 and HCl vapors as well as particulate matter. These emis­
sions occur at levels well below regulatory limits, but are still a source of 
concern. The salt ﬂux used as a replacement for chlorine in rotary and some 
reverberatory furnaces vaporizes to a small extent during melting, generat­
ing chloride fumes (Chesonis et al., 2009). Dust given off by salt slag also 
presents a workplace hazard. More recently, the hygroscopic nature of salt 
accumulated on workplace tools has been identiﬁed as a path by which 
water can be introduced to melting furnaces (Williams et al., 2005) and 
thus a cause of steam explosions.
Figures 14.1 and 14.2 show the relative injury and serious rates of the secondary 
smelting and alloying of aluminum industry compiled by the US Department of 
Labor (BLS, 2012). Although they have in general declined with time, the values 
are signiﬁcantly higher than for private industry as a whole. Much of the rea­
son lies in the persistent incident of molten metal explosions, which have caused 
numerous injuries and fatalities. Figure 14.3 shows historical data collected by 
the Aluminum Association (United States) on the global number of incidents 
­involving molten aluminum explosions (Epstein, 2011). The most numerous of

the three types of explosion are Force 1 explosions, sometimes known as pops 
or steam explosions (Epstein, 2007). Figure 14.4 shows a typical example; these 
occur when water trapped under molten metal expands and throws a small amount 
of metal (<4 kg) a short distance (<5 m). Less numerous are Force 2 explosions, 
when the steam is trapped by something more resistant than just molten metal

(e.g., unmelted solid), resulting in an explosion that can throw molten metal up 
to 15 m or more. These are capable of doing serious damage to both plant equip­
ment and personnel. Force 3 explosions, which result in the type of damage seen 
in Figure 14.5, are rare (for the ﬁrst time, none were reported in 2010). These 
are often assisted by chemical reactions, such as exploding ammonium nitrate or 
the reaction of molten aluminum with water to generate hydrogen (Lowery and 
Roberts, 2010):

The data in Figure 14.4 include explosions of all types, including those associated 
with casting, metal transfer, and melting. About 15% resulted in a serious injury or 
fatality (Pluchon et al., 2011). Melting incidents represented about 40% of the total, 
but almost two-thirds of the fatalities. As a result, the elimination of these incidents 
is a priority for the industry.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant concern resulting from the use of chlorides is their 
reaction with organic vapors given off by decomposing coatings and plastics. The 
reaction generates several persistent organic pollutants (POPs), most notably PCDDs 
(polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins) and PCDFs (polychlorinated dibenzo furans). 
These compounds are found in both the off-gas from melting furnaces and the ﬂy 
ash captured in the dust cleaning system (Pitea et al., 2008). Total emissions and 
emission rates vary considerably among secondary aluminum producers, due to 
variations in the type of scrap used, melting practice, and off-gas treatment method 
(Ba et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009). The types of PCDD/F found in the off-gas and 
ﬂy ash are largely the same, with furans predominating over dioxins (Lenoir et al., 
2012; Li et al., 2007). The most common congeners (forms of PCDD and PCDF) are 
a matter of some disagreement. Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are also found 
in the off-gas and ﬂy ash from secondary aluminum smelting (Ba et al., 2010).
The high ratio of furan to dioxin congeners in secondary aluminum furnace off-
gas suggests that the primary formation mechanism for these compounds is de novo 
synthesis (Lee et al., 2005; Lenoir et al., 2012; Li et al., 2007; Pitea et al., 2008). This 
is a reaction that occurs in the off-gas as it leaves the furnace, using the solid carbon 
in the ﬂy ash from the furnace as a carbon source (Merz, 2004). Molecular oxygen 
in the off-gas stream is also a requirement. The source of the needed chlorine is less 
certain; changing concentrations of Cl2 and HCl have little impact on the formation 
rate, so the presence of a metal catalyst such as copper may play an important role.
Table 14.2, from the 2001 review by Nakamura et al., compares dioxin emissions 
from various industries in Europe and the United States. (A g-TEQ is the equivalent 
mass of toxic dioxin emitted per year; 1 g-TEQ is roughly equal to 61 g of total 
dioxin.) Ba et al., show similar results from a survey in 2009. The numbers are

Safety and Environmental Considerations
subject to considerable uncertainty, but the much larger values for the European 
secondary aluminum industry may reﬂect in part the wider use of rotary furnaces, 
which require ﬂuxing (Sweetman et al., 2004). Dioxin generation is facilitated in the 
remelting of aluminum scrap because of (a) the melt temperature of 700°C–800°C, 
which is below the temperature at which optimal decomposition of dioxins occurs 
and (b) the input raw material, which often includes chlorine- and bromine-contain­
ing plastics. Electronic scrap is a particular concern (Sinkkonen et al., 2004).
RESPONSES TO HAZARDS
The responses to these hazards fall into two classes. The ﬁrst has to do with scrap 
acquisition and storage and the second is changes in charging and melting practice.
Scrap acquisition and storage: Preventing steam explosions is the most important 
task in the receiving and handling of scrap aluminum (or any metal scrap, for that 
matter). Visual inspection of incoming scrap can determine if a load is especially 
wet, but measures taken after receiving are more important (Pluchon et al., 2011). 
Storing scrap in a covered location is recommended, as is a FIFO (First In, First Out)

policy for charging. Although baled scrap is more convenient to charge, shredding 
the bales is increasingly required to uncover surprises and give undesired ﬂuids a 
chance to drain away (Bano Shredders, 2011; Jacoby, 2000). Storage temperatures 
should be watched carefully, as sudden changes in temperature can cause condensa­
tion of atmospheric moisture onto the scrap surface to occur.
Inspection of incoming scrap is vital for removing other hazards, and training per­
sonnel to recognize hazards is an important part of a safety program (Bertram et al., 
2007). Many facilities now supplement visual inspection with a radiation detection 
station, since radioactive material is the hardest to spot and the most damaging if not 
caught. Magnetic separators can remove most of the ferrous material (and the rust) 
from incoming scrap, and this is commonly practiced as well. A good relationship 
with brokers and other scrap suppliers will often prevent problems from reaching the 
recycling facility in the ﬁrst place.
Chapter 5 introduced the types of decoater used for decomposing the organic 
coatings on aluminum scrap, in particular UBCs. It was pointed out that decoating 
reduces melt loss of treated scrap and also reduces ﬂuxing requirements. It also 
reduces soot and organic vapor generation in the melting furnace, reducing the 
amount of environmental equipment required for the furnace. Reducing the amount 
of carbon in the melting furnace off-gas may also play a key role in minimizing 
PCDD/F formation (Lenoir et al., 2012). By collecting the organic vapor in one pro­
cess stream, postcombustion of the vapor to generate CO2 and H2O is easier, and 
the lack of ﬂux in a decoater reduces the possibility of dioxin generation as well. 
Because of this, thermal pretreatment of scrap to decompose organic material is 
increasingly recommended for all old scrap, not just UBCs.
Decoating furnaces obviously remove water as well as organic coatings; even if 
decoating is not performed, a drying furnace such as that shown in Figure 14.6 is still 
recommended for water removal (Emes, 2004; Pluchon et al., 2011). (The heat input 
to the scrap in a drying furnace shortens melting times and increases productivity 
as well.) In addition to scrap, other inputs to a melting furnace should be kept dry—
alloying elements, skimming tools, and primary or secondary ingot charged with 
the scrap. Water trapped in the shrinkage cavity of aluminum sows is recognized as 
FIGURE 14.6  A drying furnace for aluminum scrap. (From Inductotherm, Inc., Induction

Safety and Environmental Considerations
one of the major causes of steam explosions (Niedling and Scherbak, 2003), and as 
a result preheating of any input to a melting furnace is now recommended (Jacoby, 
2000). Any melting furnace with a built-in preheating system, such as a shaft or 
tower furnace, is useful for water removal as well.
Charging and melting: Improving safety in the charging of aluminum scrap to a 
melting furnace has three elements: separation of personnel from the process, placing 
barriers between workers and the furnace, and personal protection of workers. The sep­
aration of personnel is the most effective of the three, and the development of remotely 
operated charging devices is of interest in all scrap metal remelting operations (Anon, 
2004; Emes, 2004; Inductotherm, Inc., 2008; Tabatabei and Turner, 2009). Continuous 
feeding of scrap to steel remelting furnaces has been available for some time, and 
equipment of this type is now being installed by aluminum remelters as well. In addi­
tion to reducing the risk of explosions and maintaining steadier furnace conditions, 
continuous charging seems to reduce the amount of dioxin and other organic emis­
sions from the furnace, most likely by keeping furnace temperatures above the range 
in which dioxins are most likely to form (Lenoir et al., 2012; Ollenschläger and Rossel, 
1999). Using conveyors or vibrating feeders rather than charge buckets also helps sepa­
rate personnel from the furnace during charging (Gillespie + Powers, Inc., 2005).
Figure 14.7 illustrates a melt control station with a barrier to separate the operator 
from the furnace. This reduces the chance of injury from splashing of molten metal 
or small steam eruptions (Emes, 2004; Inductotherm, Inc., 2008). The introduction 
of video monitoring of charging operations now makes it possible to move the opera­
tor even farther away, and this will be more popular in the future. The aluminum 
industry has also made signiﬁcant efforts in recent years to improve personal protec­
tion for plant personnel. These efforts include research on ﬁre- and splash-retardant 
fabrics, which are more difﬁcult to produce for molten aluminum (Johnson, 2003).

Aluminum Recycling
As previously discussed, signiﬁcant effort has been made in recent years to 
develop salt-free melting practices. This includes the introduction of vortexing and 
twin-chamber reverberatory furnaces, decoating equipment, and efforts to develop a 
salt-free dross processing technique (see Chapter 13). Eliminating salt eliminates the 
production of salt dross. It also minimizes chloride fumes in the plant environment 
and the generation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in furnace exhaust gas. For the same 
reasons, eliminating chlorine gas from reﬁning operations is also a goal of many 
casting facilities.
Table 14.3 lists dioxin concentrations in the exhaust gas from secondary alumi­
num processing, again from the review of Nakamura et al. (2001). The treatment of 
most exhaust gas (Figure 14.8) includes (a) contacting it with slaked lime or sodium 
bicarbonate, which reacts with chlorinated hydrocarbons (like dioxin) to generate 
calcium or sodium chloride and nonhazardous hydrocarbons (Ollenschläger and 
Rossel, 1999), and (b) the use of a fabric-ﬁlter baghouse to recover small particles 
and mists from the exhaust gas (Ba et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2005). A newer approach 
is to quickly quench the off-gas, minimizing the time during which it is in the 
­optimum temperature range (300°C–400°C) for dioxin formation. Activated car­
bon injection may also be effective at recovering PCDD/F from the off-gas (Pitea 
­et al., 2008).
Furnace operating characteristics also play a role in dioxin formation. Firing with 
oxygen-enriched air tends to increase dioxin concentrations, in part by reducing the 
volume of exhaust gas generated (Nakamura et al., 2001). However, using dilution of 
off-gas with air to decrease dioxin concentration is not acceptable in many locations. 
The optimization of reverberatory furnace practice to preheat scrap and minimize 
ﬂux usage is more helpful.
