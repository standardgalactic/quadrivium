Foreword to the First Edition
We are delighted to write the foreword of this comprehensive book by Massimo
Rudan, entitled Physics of Semiconductor Devices, a treatise that goes to the heart
of the physics involved in the study of electron devices. While the literature on this
topic is very wide and diversiﬁed, it typically covers only part of the whole subject:
either semiconductor physics or device theory. This book bridges the gap between
these two aspects of the discipline, as it thoroughly covers both of them and even
addresses process technology.
Why do we need a book on physics written by an engineer for engineers? Are
not physics books written by physicists good enough? The answer is rooted in the
difference of motivation of science as opposed to engineering. The scientist wants
to know why and investigates the cause or the underlying fundamental laws from
observed effects. The engineer wants to know what for and pursues a purpose, like
building a device, based on such effects. The engineer tries to arrange physical
objects in such a way that a desired and foreseeable action is achieved as can be
expected by virtue of the laws of physics. The engineer goes from the known causes
to the desired effects. In this sense, the engineer’s objective is the inverse of the
scientist’s endeavor.
Is there common ground between physics and engineering? Yes, and that is why
physicists and engineers should be friends. Obviously, knowledge of the appropriate
part of physics (but not all physics) is indispensable for the engineer to build
something useful. That is what this book aims at in the area of electronic devices. On
the other hand, physicists build sophisticated laboratory equipment (sometimes with
the help of engineers) for the purpose of investigating new physical phenomena.
The builders of such unique tools do not have to worry about mass manufacturing
in contrast to engineering, where low-cost production and reliability are major
concerns, yet another difference of motivation.
The complexity of the physical background required for a deep understanding
of device behavior makes it difﬁcult to pursue a deductive teaching methodology,
where every new concept is justiﬁed on fundamental physical principles. The limited
number of lecture hours, and the need to comply with the program and objectives of
engineering courses, is often such that many teachers, as well as textbooks, tend to
vii

viii
Foreword to the First Edition
ignore such a background and to use an inductive approach instead. So doing, some
fundamental concepts are delivered to students intuitively, in the form of physical
models with some degree of simpliﬁcation and no proof behind them. While the
inductive approach may be useful for practical purposes, it bears the drawback of
hiding assumptions and limitations of the model, thereby leading to an insufﬁcient
depth of understanding and lack of criticism on the validity of the obtained results.
This book is fully functional to a deductive teaching approach and, as such,
represents a very useful tool not just for students but for researchers and scientists as
well. The reader can thus ﬁnd within the same volume both a rigorous justiﬁcation
for the semiclassical and quantum-mechanical models adopted in practice to clarify
the device operation, such as the most popular drift-diffusion transport model,
and detailed descriptions of the operating principles of the most important semi-
conductor devices. The evolution of microelectronics toward nanoscale structures
makes it imperative to master quantum mechanics and solid-state physics in order
to understand the operation of miniaturized devices. This book is therefore timely
and meets a need felt by many students as well as teachers.
Roughly speaking, this volume addresses four main areas: (i) a review of
analytical mechanics and electromagnetism, (ii) an introduction to statistical and
quantum mechanics, (iii) a treatment of solid-state physics and carrier trans-
port in semiconductors, and (iv) a description of the basic device concepts and
their operating principles. The Appendices highlight mathematical concepts and
proofs of theorems cited somewhere throughout the volume. For example, Chap. 6,
where the Boltzmann transport equation is derived and discussed; Chap. 17, where
the fundamental concepts of crystalline solid-state physics are introduced; and
Chap. 18, with the description of the basic properties of electrons and holes in
semiconductors under equilibrium conditions, highlight the rigorous, yet elegant,
approach to the description of delicate physical concepts, such as the Bloch theorem,
the band structure of crystalline solids in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, and the phonon
vibrational spectra. The author’s deep mathematical background shows up in several
demonstrations, where the use of sophisticated mathematical tools leads to simple,
albeit rigorous, proofs of the concepts addressed in the treatment. An important
speciﬁcity of this book is also that simplifying assumptions are widely discussed
and their impact on ﬁnal results is typically highlighted.
In conclusion, Physics of Semiconductor Devices by Massimo Rudan represents
a remarkable piece of work that is likely to provide a valuable learning tool
to electrical engineering students willing to deepen their understanding of this
fascinating ﬁeld. It will also be a useful consultation tool for researchers, scientists,
and engineers involved in the fundamental aspects of material science and device
design.

Preface to the Second Edition
The second edition of this book has been enriched mostly in the parts devoted
to semiconductors and devices (Chaps. 20 through 25). The analysis of the net
recombination rate in polycrystalline materials, relevant for, e.g., thin-ﬁlm tran-
sistors, is carried out in Chap. 20. The derivation of the characteristics of the
bipolar transistor, photodiode, and solar cell has been added to Chap. 21, along
with some considerations about the scaling limits of the bipolar architecture. The
new material of Chap. 22 features the analysis of the n-substrate MOS capacitor,
MOS photo-capacitor, and p-channel MOSFET, followed by the description of the
CMOS architecture. A more general theory of the MOSFET, including the diffusive
contribution to the channel current, is given; a brief outline about the scaling rules of
semiconductor devices and the design steps of integrated circuits completes the new
material of this chapter. Chapter 23 has been extended substantially by including the
description of ion implantation. As for the measurement techniques, Chap. 25 has
been enriched with the theory of the Hall effect in the nonideal case and with the
resistivity measurement based on the van der Pauw method.
More material has sparsely been added to other chapters: the derivation of the
Schrödinger equation as the Euler equation of a constrained functional is extended
to more than one dimension in Chap. 1; the theory of the Green function in the
top half plane, instrumental to the van der Pauw measurement scheme, has been
added to Chap. 4; a full derivation of the ﬁeld generated by a point-like charge is
now included in Chap. 5. The demonstration of the Boltzmann H-theorem and a
discussion about the Kac-ring paradox have been added to Chap. 6. In the chapters
devoted to quantum mechanics, the discussion of Chap. 13 about the properties
of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is more extended, and the treatment
of the time-dependent perturbation of Chap. 14 is now embracing the harmonic
perturbation of a general form and the spatially periodic case; the latter analysis
provides in turn the selection rules that are exploited in the discussion of the
electron-phonon interaction, added to Chap. 17. The transport model worked out in
Chap. 19 is used in the complements of the chapter to derive the Onsager relations.
The Appendices have also been enriched with new material, with the aim of
completing a number of topics tackled in the book’s chapters; several sections about
ix

x
Preface to the Second Edition
matrix analysis have been added to Appendix A, followed by other sections showing
the application to the numerical solution of the semiconductor equations in one
dimension. Appendix B has been enriched with the theories of Lagrange multipliers,
conformal mapping, and contraction mappings; ﬁnally, the approximations to the
Fermi integrals, the illustration of the Bernoulli numbers and polynomials, the
calculation of a special integral using Cauchy’s residue theorem, the treatment
of the random walk problem, and the central limit theorem have been added to
Appendix C.
About 50 problems, 50 ﬁgures, and 3 tables have been added to those of the ﬁrst
edition and about 20 ﬁgures reworked; several new ﬁgures are in color. A subject
index featuring about 2;600 entries has been inserted at the end of the volume.

Preface to the First Edition
This volume originates from the lectures on solid-state electronics and microelec-
tronics that I have been giving since 1978 at the School of Engineering of the
University of Bologna. Its scope is to provide the reader with a book that, starting
from the elementary principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism,
introduces the concepts of quantum mechanics and solid-state theory and describes
the basic physics of semiconductors including the hierarchy of transport models,
ending up with the standard mathematical model of semiconductor devices and
the analysis of the behavior of basic devices. The ambition of the work has been
to write a book, self-contained as far as possible, that would be useful for both
students and researchers; to this purpose, a strong effort has been made to elucidate
physical concepts, mathematical derivations, and approximation levels, without
being verbose.
The book is divided into eight parts. Part I deals with analytical mechanics and
electromagnetism; purposedly, the material is not given in the form of a resumé:
quantum mechanics and solid-state theory concepts are so richly intertwined with
the classical ones that presenting the latter in an abridged form may make the
reading unwieldy and the connections more difﬁcult to establish. Part II provides
the introductory concepts of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, followed
by the description of the general methods of quantum mechanics. The problem of
bridging the classical concepts with the quantum ones is ﬁrst tackled using the
historical perspective, covering the years from 1900 to 1926. The type of statistical
description necessary for describing the experiments, and the connection with the
limiting case of the same experiments involving massive bodies, is related to the
properties of the doubly stochastic matrices. Part III illustrates a number of appli-
cations of the Schrödinger equation: elementary cases, solutions by factorization,
and time-dependent perturbation theory. Part IV analyzes the properties of systems
of particles, with special attention to those made of identical particles, and the
methods for separating the equations. The concepts above are applied in Part V
to the analysis of periodic structures, with emphasis to crystals of the cubic type
and to silicon in particular, which, since the late 1960s, has been and still is the
most important material for the fabrication of integrated circuits. Part VI illustrates
xi

xii
Preface to the First Edition
the single-electron dynamics in a periodic structure and derives the semiclassical
Boltzmann transport equation; from the latter, the hydrodynamic and drift-diffusion
models of semiconductor devices are obtained using the moments expansion. The
drift-diffusion model is used in Part VII to work out analytically the electrical
characteristics for the basic devices of the bipolar and MOS type. Finally, Part VIII
presents a collection of items which, although important per se, are not in the book’s
mainstream: some of the fabrication-process steps of integrated circuits (thermal
diffusion, thermal oxidation, layer deposition, epitaxy) and methods for measuring
the semiconductor parameters.
In the preparation of the book, I have been helped by many colleagues. I wish
to thank, in particular, Giorgio Baccarani, Carlo Jacoboni, and Rossella Brunetti,
who gave me important suggestions about the matter’s distribution in the book, read
the manuscript, and, with their observations, helped me to clarify and improve the
text; I wish also to thank, for reading the manuscript and giving me their comments,
Giovanni Betti Beneventi, Fabrizio Buscemi, Gaetano D’Emma, Antonio Gnudi,
Elena Gnani, Enrico Piccinini, Susanna Reggiani, and Paolo Spadini.
Last, but not least, I wish to thank the students, undergraduate, graduate, and
postdocs, who for decades have accompanied my teaching and research activity with
stimulating curiosity. Many comments, exercises, and complements of this book are
the direct result of questions and comments that came from them.

About the Author
Massimo Rudan received a degree in electrical
engineering in 1973 and a degree in physics in 1976,
both from the University of Bologna, Italy. His research
interests are in the ﬁeld of physics of carrier transport
and numerical analysis of semiconductor devices. In
1986, he was a visiting scientist, on a one-year assign-
ment, at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center at
Yorktown Heights, NY, studying the discretization tech-
niques for the higher-order moments of the Boltzmann
transport equation.
From 1979, he has been teaching annual courses in the Faculty of Engineering
of the University of Bologna, ﬁrstly as lecturer and then as associate professor. In
1990, he became full professor of microelectronics at the University of Bologna.
An IEEE fellow (2008) and life fellow (2014), M.R. is author, coauthor, or editor of
12 books and has authored or coauthored about 250 technical papers published in
major journals or presented in international conferences, in the ﬁelds of electronics,
solid-state physics, and solid-state sensors.
M.R. has coordinated several research projects funded by the European Commis-
sion, international companies and foundations, the National Council of Research,
and the National Ministry of University and Research. In 2001, he was one of the
founders of the Advanced Research Center for Electronic Systems (ARCES) of the
University of Bologna.

Acronyms
AM
Air mass. Length of the optical path, through Earth’s atmosphere, of
light rays coming from an extraterrestrial source. The AM value at sea
level, when the source is at the zenith, is set equal to unity and used as
normalization parameter.
BJT
Bipolar junction transistor. A transistor whose operation is obtained by
a suitable arrangement of two p-n junctions. The term “bipolar” is used
because both electrons and holes are involved in the device functioning.
BTE
Boltzmann transport equation. The equation expressing the continuity
of the distribution function in the phase space.
CVD
Chemical vapor deposition. A deposition process in which the material
to be deposited is the product of a chemical reaction that takes place on
the surface of the substrate or in its vicinity.
DD
Drift diffusion. The term indicates a transport model for semiconduc-
tors made, for each energy band, of the balance equations for the carrier
number and average velocity. Such equations contain the electric ﬁeld
and the magnetic induction; as a consequence, their solution must be
calculated consistently with that of the Maxwell equations. Compare
with the HD model.
DRAM
Dynamic random access memory. A type of random-access, solid-
state memory where each bit is stored in a separate capacitor. The
charged/discharged states of the latter correspond to the logic states
of the memory bit. Due to the leakage of the circuits connected to
the capacitor, the stored datum tends to fade unless it is periodically
refreshed (whence the designation “dynamic”). DRAM memories are
volatile, namely, they lose the data when the power supply is removed.
HD
Hydro dynamic. The term indicates a transport model for semiconduc-
tors made, for each energy band, of the balance equation for the carrier
number, average velocity, average kinetic energy, and average ﬂux of
the kinetic energy. Such equations contain the electric ﬁeld and the
magnetic induction; as a consequence, their solution must be calculated

Acronyms
consistently with that of the Maxwell equations. Compare with the DD
model.
IC
Integrated circuit. Also called chip or microchip. An assembly of elec-
tronic circuits on the same plate of a semiconductor material. The idea
was proposed in the early 1950s and demonstrated in 1958; it provided
an enormous improvement, both in cost and performance, with respect
to the manual assembly of circuits using discrete components.
IGFET
Insulated gate ﬁeld effect transistor. A device architecture demon-
strated in the early 1930s. Its ﬁrst implementation (1960) using a
thermally oxidized silicon layer gave rise to the MOSFET architecture.
LASER
Light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation. A device made
of a material having a high probability of radiative emission, in which
the electron concentration of high-energy states is artiﬁcially kept
high by an external power source. The material produces a coherent
emission, and a suitable feedback makes it to oscillate; this results in a
nearly monochromatic light.
LOCOS
Local oxidation. The technological process consisting in depositing
and patterning a layer of silicon nitride over the areas where the
substrate’s oxidation must be prevented.
MBE
Molecular beam epitaxy. A low-temperature epitaxial process based on
evaporation.
MIS
Metal insulator semiconductor. Structure made of the superposition of
a metal contact, an insulator, and a semiconductor.
MOS
Metal oxide semiconductor. Structure made of the superposition of a
metal contact, an oxide that acts as an insulator, and a semiconductor.
MOSFET
Metal oxide semiconductor, ﬁeld effect transistor. A transistor whose
active region is an MOS structure. In last-generation devices, the
insulator may be deposited instead of being obtained by oxidizing the
semiconductor underneath. The MOSFET has been for decades, and
still is, the fundamental device of the integrated-circuit architecture.
PCM
Phase change memory. A solid-state memory whose logic states are
associated with a high-resistance or low-resistance condition of the
material; such conditions are in turn associated to the material’s phases,
amorphous or crystalline, respectively. The material is forced to switch
from one phase to the other by an externally applied electric signal.
PDE
Partial differential equation.
PV
Photo voltaic. The adjective refers to physical processes that convert
the energy of a radiation into electric energy (e.g., photovoltaic effect)
or to devices where such processes occur (e.g., photovoltaic cell).
PVD
Physical vapor deposition. A deposition process in which the material
to be deposited does not react chemically with other substances.
SGOI
Silicon germanium on insulator. A technology analogous to SOI. SGOI
increases the speed of the transistors by straining the material under the
gate, thus making the electron mobility higher.

Acronyms
xxxi
SOI
Silicon on insulator. A technology introduced in 1998 for semiconduc-
tor manufacturing, in which the standard silicon substrate is replaced
with a layered structure of the silicon-insulator-silicon type. SOI
reduces the parasitic capacitances and the short-channel effect in MOS
transistors.
SOS
Silicon on sapphire. A technological process that consists in growing a
thin layer of silicon on a wafer made of sapphire (Al2O3).
SS
Subthreshold slope. The inverse of d log10.I/=dVG in a device where a
conductive channel is controlled by a gate; I is the channel current, VG
the gate voltage. A smaller SS corresponds to a faster transition of the
device from the on to the off state or vice versa.
TFT
Thin ﬁlm transistor. A type of ﬁeld-effect transistor fabricated by
depositing the active semiconductor layer, the dielectric layer, and
the metallic contacts over a nonconducting substrate. An important
application of TFTs is in liquid-crystal displays; for this reason, a
typical type of nonconducting substrate of TFTs is glass.

Chapter 1
Analytical Mechanics
1.1
Introduction
The differential equations that govern the dynamic problems can be derived from
variational principles, upon which the theories of Euler and Lagrange, and those
of Hamilton and Jacobi, are based. Apart from being the source of the greatest
intellectual enjoyment, these theories have the deﬁnite advantage of generality.
Their concepts can in fact be extended to cases where the Newtonian equation of
dynamics does not apply. Among such cases there are the equations governing the
electromagnetic ﬁeld and those related to the quantum description of the particles’
motion.
The invariance property of the Lagrange equations with respect to a change of
coordinates gives origin to the concept of generalized coordinates and conjugate
momenta; in turn, the introduction of the Hamilton equations provides a picture
in which the intrinsic symmetry of the roles of coordinates and momenta becomes
apparent. Basing on the concept of conjugate coordinates, the time evolution of
a particle or of a system of particles is described in the phase space instead of
the coordinate space. This chapter and the next one illustrate the basic principles
of Analytical Mechanics. Their purpose is to introduce a number of concepts
that are not only useful per se, but also constitute a basis for the concepts of
Quantum Mechanics that are introduced in later chapters. The third chapter devoted
to Analytical Mechanics describes a number of important examples that will be
applied to later developments illustrated in the book.
As the velocity of particles within a semiconductor device is small with respect
to that of light, the nonrelativistic form of the mechanical laws is sufﬁcient for
the purposes of this book. The relativistic form is used only in a few paragraphs
belonging to the chapter devoted to examples, to the purpose of describing a speciﬁc
type of collision between particles. This chapter starts with the description of the
Lagrangian function and the Lagrange equations that are derived as a consequence
of the variational calculus, followed by the derivation of the Hamiltonian function
and Hamilton equations. Next, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is derived after

discussing the time-energy conjugacy. The chapter continues with the deﬁnition of
the Poisson brackets and the derivation of some properties of theirs, and concludes
with the description of the phase space and state space.
1.2
Variational Calculus
Consider a real function w./ deﬁned in the interval  2 Œa; b and differentiable in
its interior at least twice. The ﬁrst two derivatives will be indicated with Pw e Rw. Now,
deﬁne the integral
GŒw D
Z b
a
g.w; Pw; / d ;
(1.1)
where the form of the function g.w; Pw; / is prescribed. If (1.1) is calculated for any
function w fulﬁlling the requisites stated above, with a and b ﬁxed, the result is some
real number G whose value depends on the choice of w. By this procedure, (1.1)
establishes a correspondence GŒw between a set of functions and a set of numbers.
Such a correspondence is called functional.
It is interesting to extend to the case of functionals some concepts and procedures
that apply to functions proper; among these the concept of extremum is important.
In fact, one deﬁnes the extremum function of a functional by a method similar to that
used for deﬁning the extremum point of a function: some w is an extremum of G if a
variation dw in (1.1) produces a variation dG that is inﬁnitesimal of an order higher
than that of dw. The procedure by which the extremum functions are calculated is
called variational calculus.
To proceed it is necessary to deﬁne the variation dw. For this one lets ıw D ˛ ,
with ./ an arbitrary function deﬁned in Œa; b and differentiable in its interior, and
˛ a real parameter. The function ıw thus deﬁned is the ﬁnite variation of w. The sum
w C ıw tends to w in the limit ˛ ! 0. As a consequence, such a limit provides the
inﬁnitesimal variation dw. For simplicity it is convenient to restrict the choice of 
to the case .a/ D .b/ D 0, so that w C ıw coincides with w at the integration
boundaries for any value of ˛. Now, replacing w with w C ˛  in (1.1) makes G a
function of ˛, whose derivative is

(1.2)
According to the deﬁnition given above, if w is an extremum function of G then it
must be lim˛!0 dG=d˛ D 0; in this case, in fact, the ﬁrst-order term in the power
expansion of G with respect to ˛ vanishes, and the variation of G becomes second
order in ˛ or higher. In conclusion, one proceeds by imposing that the right-hand
side of (1.2) vanishes for ˛ D 0. Then, integrating by parts the second term in
brackets yields

(1.3)
where, in turn, the integrated part vanishes because .a/ D .b/ D 0. This makes
the two integrals in (1.3) equal to each other. On the other hand, such an equality
must hold for any choice of  due to the arbitrariness of the latter. It follows that the
integrands must be equal to each other, namely,
d
d

@w :

The relation (1.4) thus found is a second-order differential equation in the unknown
w, whose explicit form is easily calculated:

@ Pw2 Rw C
@2g
@w@ Pw Pw C @2g
@@ Pw D @g
@w :
(1.5)
Its solution provides the extremum function w sought. To actually ﬁnd a solution one
must associate with (1.4) suitable boundary conditions, e.g., w.a/ D wa, Pw.a/ D Pwa,
or w.a/ D wa, w.b/ D wb, and so on. As g does not contain Rw, (1.4) is linear with
respect to Rw. It is also worth noting that, consistently with what happens in the case
of functions proper, the above calculation does not provide in itself any information
about w being a minimum or maximum of G. Such an information must be sought
through additional calculations.
The analysis above is easily extended to the case where g depends on several
functions w1, w2 ; : : : and the corresponding derivatives. Introducing the vectors
w./ D .w1; w2; : : : ; wn/, Pw./ D . Pw1; Pw2; : : : ; Pwn/ one ﬁnds that the set of n

(1.7)
supplemented with suitable boundary conditions. Equations (1.7) are called Euler
equations of the functional G.
Each Eq. (1.7) is homogeneous with respect to the derivatives of g and does
not contain g itself. As a consequence, the differential equations (1.7) are invariant
when g is replaced with A g C B, where A; B ¤ 0 are constants. As the boundary
conditions of wi are not affected by that, the solutions wi are invariant under the
transformation. Moreover, it can be shown that the solutions are invariant under a

more general transformation. In fact, consider an arbitrary function h D h.w; / and
let g0 D g C dh=d, thus transforming (1.6) into
G0Œw D A
Z b
a
g.w; Pw; / d C h.wb; b/  h.wa; a/ :
(1.8)
When each wi is replaced with wi C dwi, the terms involving h do not vary because
the variations vanish at the boundaries of the integration domain. Thus, the variation
of G0 equals that of the integral, namely, it is of a higher order than dwi. In
conclusion, the extremum functions of G are also extremum functions of G0. This
means that the solutions wi./ are invariant under addition to g of the total derivative
of an arbitrary function that depends on w and  only. This reasoning does not apply
if h depends also on the derivatives Pw, because in general the derivatives of the
variations do not vanish at the boundaries.
1.3
Lagrangian Function
In many cases the solution of a physical problem is achieved by solving a set of
second-order differential equations of the form Rwi D Rwi.w; Pw; /. For instance,
for nonrelativistic velocities the law of motion of a particle of constant mass m
is Newton’s law F D m a which, in a Cartesian frame, takes the form
m Rxi D Fi.r; Pr; t/ ;
i D 1; 2; 3 :
(1.9)
In (1.9), r.t/ D .x1; x2; x3/ is the particle’s position vector1at t. In the following the
particle’s velocity will be indicated with u D Pr.
Equations (1.9) and (1.7) have the same form, as is easily found by observing that
t is the analogue of  and xi is that of wi. As a consequence, one may argue that (1.9)
could be deduced as Euler equations of a suitable functional. This problem is in fact
the inverse of that solved in Sect. 1.2: there, the starting point is the function g,
whose derivatives provide the coefﬁcients of the differential equations (1.7); here,
the coefﬁcients of the differential equation are given, while the function g is to
be found. For the inverse problem the existence of a solution is not guaranteed in
general; if a solution exists, ﬁnding the function g may be complicate because the
process requires an integration. In other terms, the direct problem involves only
the somewhat “mechanical” process of calculating derivatives, whereas the inverse
problem involves the integration which is, so to speak, an art.
When dealing with the dynamics of a particle or of a system of particles, the
function g, if it exists, is called Lagrangian function and is indicated with L. The
1The units in (1.9) are: Œm D kg, Œr D m, ŒPr D m s1, Œ Rxi D m s2, ŒFi D N, where “N”
stands for Newton.

equations corresponding to (1.7) are called Lagrange equations. The expression of
the Lagrangian function depends on the form of the force Fi in (1.9). Some examples
are given in the following. It is important to note that by “system of particles”
it is meant a collection of particles that interact with each other. If there were no
interactions it would be possible to tackle the dynamics of each particle separately;
in other terms, each particle would constitute a system in itself, described by a
smaller number of degrees of freedom.

(1.11)
The ﬁrst of (1.11) shows that the sum T D LCV does not depend on the coordinates
xi. Inserting L D T  V into the second of (1.11) and taking i D 1 show that the
difference ˚ D @T=@u1  mu1 does not depend on time either, so it depends on
the ui components at most. Integrating ˚ with respect to u1 yields T D mu2
1=2 C
T1.u2; u3; t/, with T1 yet undetermined. Differentiating this expression of T with
respect to u2 and comparing it with the second of (1.11) speciﬁed for i D 2 yield
T D m .u2

i D 3 ﬁnally provides T D m .u2

function of time only. The latter, in turn, can be viewed as the time derivative of
another function h. Remembering the invariance property discussed at the end of
Sect. 1.2 with reference to (1.8), one lets T0 D 0. In conclusion, indicating with u
the modulus of u it is T D mu2=2, and the Lagrangian function reads
L D 1

The derivation of (1.12) may appear lengthy. However, the procedure is useful
because it is applicable to forces of a more complicate form.

Electromagnetic Force
Consider a charged particle subjected to an electromagnetic ﬁeld and let m and
e be its mass and charge, respectively. The particle’s velocity u is assumed to be
nonrelativistic. The electromagnetic ﬁeld acts on the particle with the Lorentz force

(1.20)
namely, the transformed Lagrangian function differs from the original one by the
total derivative of an arbitrary function that depends on position and time only. As a
consequence, the solutions xi.t/ are invariant under the gauge transformation (1.19).
This is easily understood by observing that the invariance of the E and B ﬁelds
makes the Lorentz force (1.13) invariant as well. As a consequence, the particle’s
dynamics is not inﬂuenced by the gauge transformation.
1.3.3
Work
The elementary work exerted by a force F acting on a particle of mass m during
the time dt is F  dr, where r is the particle’s position at t in a Cartesian frame and
dr D u dt the elementary displacement. Let P D r.t D a/, Q D r.t D b/ be the
boundaries of the particle’s trajectory. The work exerted from P to Q is found by
integrating F  dr over the trajectory, namely,
Z Q

Z b

dt dt D T.b/  T.a/ ;
(1.21)
where the relation T D mu2=2 has been used. The exerted work is then equal to the
variation of T, which is the same quantity that appears in (1.12, 1.18) and is called
kinetic energy of the particle. If a system having n degrees of freedom is considered
instead of a single particle, the work exerted by the forces is deﬁned as the sum
of terms of the form (1.21). As a consequence, the kinetic energy of the system is
the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual particles. The expression of the
system’s kinetic energy in Cartesian coordinates is

that is, a positive-deﬁnite quadratic form in the velocities. The masses in (1.22)
take the same value when they are referred to the same particle. When other types
of coordinates are used, the kinetic energy is still a second-degree function of the
velocities; however, the function’s coefﬁcients may depend on the coordinates (an
example is given in Sect. 2.8).
When a force deriving from a potential energy V D V.r; t/ is considered, like that
of Sect. 1.3.1, the integrand of (1.21) becomes  grad V dr. To calculate the integral
it is necessary to account for the explicit dependence of V on t by using mutually
consistent values of r and t; in other terms, the integral in (1.21) can actually be
calculated only after determining the function r.t/. An exception occurs when V
has no explicit dependence on time; in this case one ﬁnds

(1.23)
namely, to calculate the integral it sufﬁces to know the boundaries of the trajectory.
Moreover, when V
D V.r/ the Lagrangian function (1.12) does not depend
explicitly on time either. It is shown in Sect. 1.6 that in this case also the sum T C V
of the kinetic and potential energies is independent of time. A dynamic property that
does not depend on time is called constant of motion. A force ﬁeld that makes T CV
a constant of motion is called conservative.
When a force of the form F D e .ECu^B/ is considered, like that of Sect. 1.3.2,
the scalar multiplication by dr D u dt shows that the second term of the force does
not contribute to the work because u ^ B  u D 0 (Sect. A.7). Remembering the ﬁrst
of (1.14), the integral corresponding to that of (1.23) reads

If the electromagnetic ﬁeld is independent of time, the calculation is the same as

1.3.4
Hamilton Principle—Synchronous Trajectories
From the analysis of Sect. 1.2 it follows that the solutions xi.t/ of the motion
equations (1.9) are the extremum functions of the functional
SŒr D

L.r; Pr; t/ dt :
(1.25)
On the other hand, r.t/ describes the particle’s trajectory. The latter is also called
natural trajectory to distinguish it from the r C ır trajectories that are obtained
through a variation. In summary, the natural trajectory of the particle is the
extremum function of (1.25). This statement is called Hamilton principle.

1.4
Generalized Coordinates
11
The integration boundaries in (1.25) determine a time interval ba that measures
the motion’s duration between the initial and ﬁnal position of the particle, r.a/ and
r.b/ respectively. The duration is the same also for the r C ır trajectories. In fact,
remembering the derivation of Sect. 1.2, the variation ır vanishes at the integration
boundaries, so that any trajectory obtained through a variation has the same initial
and ﬁnal positions as the natural one at the same instants a and b. Moreover, any
position r C ır between r.a/ and r.b/ is considered at the same instant as the
position r of the natural trajectory. For this reason the r C ır trajectories of the
functional (1.25) are called synchronous.
1.4
Generalized Coordinates
The extremum functions are calculated as shown in Sect. 1.3 also when a system
of N particles, instead a single particle, is considered. The starting point is
still (1.9), where a new index is introduced to distinguish the masses. The number
of coordinates that describe the motion of all particles in the system is not necessary
equal to 3 N; in fact, a number of constraints may exist that limit the relative
positions of the particles. As a consequence, letting n  3 N indicate the number
of degrees of freedom of the system, the set x1.t/ ; : : : ; xn.t/ sufﬁces to determine
the positions of the particles at time t.
Depending on the problem in hand it may be more convenient to use a new set of
coordinates q1.t/ ; : : : ; qn.t/ instead of the Cartesian set x1.t/ ; : : : ; xn.t/. For this, it
is necessary to extend the calculation of the extremum functions to the case where
the new set is used. Let the relation between the old and new coordinates be

(1.26)
The coordinates qi, whose units are not necessarily a length, are called generalized
coordinates. Their time derivatives Pqi D dqi=dt are called generalized velocities.
The explicit dependence on time in (1.26) is present if a relative motion of the two
frames exists: e.g., the relations q1 D x1v0t, q2 D x2, q3 D x3 transform the x1x2x3
set into the q1q2q3 set that moves with respect to the former one with the velocity
v0 along the ﬁrst axis.
Differentiating qi twice with respect to time and using the ﬁrst of (1.26)
provide a relation of the form Rqi D Rqi.x1; Px1; Rx1 ; : : : ; xn; Pxn; Rxn ; t/. The above,
after eliminating the second derivatives Rx1; : : : ; Rxn through (1.9), becomes Rqi D
Rqi.x1; Px1 ; : : : ; xn; Pxn ; t/. Finally, replacing x1; Px1 ; : : : ; xn; Pxn extracted from the sec-
ond of (1.26) yields

where q indicates the set q1 ; : : : ; qn, and Pq indicates the corresponding derivatives.
Equations (1.27) have the same form as (1.9), hence they must be deducible as the
extremum functions of a functional. To show this, one starts from (1.25) by writing
the Lagrangian function in the new set of coordinates. A rather lengthy calculation
based on the chain-differentiation rule yields

(1.29)
This result is very important because it shows that the Lagrange equations are
invariant under a change of coordinates of the type (1.26).
The solution of (1.28) provides the time evolution of the coordinates qi describing
the particles’ motion. As (1.28) are n second-order equations, to determine their
solution it is necessary to specify at t D a the values of the n functions qi and
of the correspondent derivatives Pqi, namely, a total of 2 n constants. The function
pi D @L=@Pqi is called generalized momentum or conjugate momentum of qi. From
this deﬁnition and from (1.28) it follows

The derivative Ppi is called generalized force. Due to the deﬁnitions (1.30), the
generalized momentum and force depend on the same coordinates as the Lagrangian
function, namely, pi D pi.q; Pq; t/, Ppi D Ppi.q; Pq; t/.

Hamiltonian Function
13
The quantity H deﬁned by (1.32) is called Hamiltonian function. Remembering the
derivation of the Lagrangian function one observes that L, H, and piPqi have the units
of an energy. In turn, the product energy  time is called action. In particular, the
functional (1.29) is called action integral [56, Chap. 8]. From the above observation
it follows that qi pi has the units of an action in all coordinate sets.
By way of example one takes the single-particle Lagrangian functions (1.12)
and (1.18), where the Cartesian coordinates are used. The momentum conjugate to
xi is given, respectively, by
L D 1
2 mu2  V ! pi D m ui ;
L D 1
2 mu2  e' C eu  A ! pi D mui C eAi :
(1.33)
The expression of H is found from (1.32) after introducing the vector p D
.p1; p2; p3/ and indicating its modulus with p. For the case L D mu2=2  V one
ﬁnds

(1.35)
Still using the Cartesian coordinates, (1.34) is readily extended to the case of a
system of particles having n degrees of freedom. The force acting on the i th degree
of freedom at time t is given by a generalization of (1.10),
miPui D @V

(1.36)
where the time derivative is calculated at t and the x1; : : : ; xn coordinates appearing
in V are calculated at t as well. For the sake of simplicity the coordinate index i is
also used to distinguish the masses in (1.36). It is implied that the same value of
mi must be applied to the indices associated with the same particle. The Lagrangian
function is calculated in the same manner as in Sect. 1.3 and reads

Comparing the two forms of H shown in (1.38), one notes that the second of (1.37)
is exploited to express the Hamiltonian function in terms of the r, p sets instead of
the r, u sets. This procedure is generalized in Sect. 1.6.
1.6
Hamilton Equations
As the Lagrangian function depends on q, Pq, and t, the generalized momentum pi
deﬁned by (1.30) depends on the same variables at most. It is useful to consider also
the inverse relations, where the generalized velocities Pqi are expressed in terms of
q, p, and t. The two sets of relations are

(1.39)
A simple example is given by the two cases of (1.33). Letting qi D xi, Pqi D ui,
the ﬁrst case gives (1.39) the form pi D m Pqi and Pqi D pi=m, while the second one
gives (1.39) the form pi D m Pqi C e Ai.q; t/ and Pqi D Œpi  e Ai.q; t/=m.
Introducing the second of (1.39) into the deﬁnition (1.32) of the Hamiltonian
function expresses the latter in terms of q, p, and t. The derivatives of the
Hamiltonian function with respect to the new variables qi, pi are very signiﬁcant.

The Hamilton equations (1.42) provide the time evolution of the generalized coor-
dinates qi; as a consequence, they are equivalent to the Lagrange equations (1.28).
Another way of obtaining the Hamilton equations is to derive them as the extremum
equations of a suitable functional. This is shown in Sect. 1.7.
In contrast to the Lagrange equations (1.28), that are n second-order differential
equations, the Hamilton equations (1.42) are 2n, ﬁrst-order differential equations.
To determine the solution of the latter it is necessary to prescribe the values of the
2n unknowns q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn at the initial time t D a, that is, 2n constants.
Therefore, the number of constants to be prescribed is the same as for the Lagrange
equations. The independent functions q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn are called canonical
coordinates. For each index i the functions qi; pi are called conjugate coordinates.
Thanks to (1.42) the total derivative of H reads

(1.44)
where the last equality derives from the ﬁrst of (1.32). If the Lagrangian function
does not depend explicitly on time it follows dH=dt D 0, namely, H is a constant of
motion. Its value is ﬁxed by the values of the canonical coordinates at the initial time
t D a. From (1.44) it also follows that dH=dt D 0 is equivalent to @H=@t D 0. In
other terms, the Hamiltonian function is a constant of motion if it does not depend
explicitly on time, and vice versa.
If the Lagrangian function does not depend on one of the coordinates, say, qr,
the latter is called cyclic or ignorable. From the second of (1.30) it follows that if
qr is cyclic, its conjugate momentum pr is a constant of motion. Moreover, due to
the second of (1.42) it is @H=@qr D 0, namely, the Hamiltonian function does not
depend on qr either.

Time–Energy Conjugacy—Hamilton-Jacobi Equation
Equations (1.42) can also be derived as the extremum equations of a functional.

As in Sect. 1.2 the equations for the extremum functions are found by letting
.@S=@˛i/0 D 0, .@S=@ˇi/0 D 0. Such equations coincide with (1.42). It is worth
observing that as no integration by part is necessary for obtaining the second
of (1.48), the derivation of (1.42) does not require any prescription for the boundary
conditions of i. On the other hand, considering that in the Hamilton equations qi
and pi are independent variables, one can add the prescription i.a/ D i.b/ D 0.
Although the latter is not necessary here, it becomes useful in the treatment of the
canonical transformations, as shown in Sect. 2.2.
In the coordinate transformations discussed so far, time was left unchanged. This
aspect is not essential: in fact, within the coordinate transformation one can replace t
with another parameter that depends single-valuedly on t. This parameter, say, .t/,
is equally suitable for describing the evolution of the particles’ system; proceeding
in this way transforms (1.45) into

i. Remembering the deﬁnition (1.30) of the conjugate momenta, it follows
that the latter becomes pi D @L=@q0

function is the momentum conjugate to . This result is not due to any particular
choice of the relation .t/, hence it holds also for the identical transformation  D t;
in other terms, H is the momentum conjugate to t.
If the upper limit b in the action integral S (Eq. (1.29)) is considered as a variable,
the Lagrangian is found to be the total time derivative of S. Letting b  t, from
the (1.45) form of S one derives its total differential

that is, a partial-differential equation in the unknown function S. The former is
called Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while the latter in this context is called Hamilton’s
principal function. As (1.51) is a ﬁrst-order equation in the n C 1 variables
q1; : : : ; qn; t, the solution S contains n C 1 integration constants. One of them is
an additive constant on S, as is easily found by observing that (1.51) contains the
derivatives of S, not S itself. For this reason the additive constant is irrelevant and
can be set to zero, so that the integration constants reduce to n. It is shown in
Sect. 2.2 that (1.51) provides the time evolution of the generalized coordinates qi. As
a consequence it is equivalent to the Lagrange equations (1.28) and to the Hamilton
equations (1.42) for describing the system’s dynamics.

Phase Space and State Space
Given a system of particles having n degrees of freedom it is often convenient to
describe its dynamic properties by means of a geometrical picture. To this purpose
one introduces a 2n-dimensional space whose coordinates are q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn.

1.9
Phase Space and State Space
19
This space has no deﬁnite metrical structure; one simply assumes that qi and pi are
plotted as Cartesian coordinates of an Euclidean space [82, Chap. 6-5]. Following
Gibbs, the space thus deﬁned is often called phase space. However, it is convenient
to better specify the terminology by using that of Ehrenfest, in which the term
”-space is used for this space (the citations of Gibbs and Ehrenfest are in [136,
Sect. 17]). At some instant t the whole set of canonical coordinates q1; : : : ; qn,
p1; : : : ; pn corresponds to a point of the ”-space. Such a point is called phase point.
In turn, the state of a mechanical system at some instant t is deﬁned as the set of its
canonical coordinates at that instant. It follows that the phase point represents the
dynamic state of the system at t. As time evolves, the phase points representing the
state at different instants provide a curve of the ”-space called phase trajectory.
A generalization of the ”-space is obtained by adding the time t as a .2n C
1/th coordinate. The .2n C 1/-dimensional space thus obtained is called state space
[82, Chap. 6-5]. The curve of the state space describing the system’s dynamics is
called state trajectory. Consider two systems governed by the same Hamiltonian
function and differing only in the initial conditions. The latter are represented by
two distinct points of the 2n-dimensional section of the state space corresponding
to t D 0. The subsequent time evolution of the two systems provides two state
trajectories that never cross each other. In fact, if a crossing occurred at, say, t D Nt,
the canonical coordinates of the two Hamiltonian functions would be identical there,
thus making the initial conditions of the subsequent motion identical as well. As a
consequence, the two state trajectories would coincide for t  Nt. However, the same
reasoning holds when considering the motion backward in time (t  Nt). Thus, the
two trajectories should coincide at all times, thus contradicting the hypothesis that
the initial conditions at t D 0 were different.
A similar reasoning about the crossing of trajectories is possible in the ”-
space. The conclusion is that the phase trajectories do not cross each other if the
Hamiltonian function does not depend explicitly on time. Instead, they may cross
each other if the Hamiltonian function depends on time; the crossing, however,
occurs at different times (in other terms, the set of canonical coordinates of the
ﬁrst system calculated at t D t1 may coincide with the set of canonical coordinates
of the second system calculated at t D t2 only in the case t2 ¤ t1).
Despite of the larger number of dimensions, the adoption of the state space is
convenient for the geometrical representation of the system’s dynamics, because a
trajectory is uniquely speciﬁed by the initial point and no crossing of trajectories
occurs. With the provision stated above, this applies also to the ”-space. In contrast,
consider a geometrical picture of the Lagrangian type, in which the generalized
coordinates q1; : : : ; qn only are used. The latter may be considered as the Cartesian
coordinates of an n-dimensional Euclidean space called conﬁguration space. To
specify a trajectory in such a space it is necessary to prescribe the position q1; : : : ; qn
and velocity Pq1; : : : ; Pqn of the system at t D 0. If one considers two or more systems
differing only in the initial conditions, the motion of each system could start from
every point of the conﬁguration space and in every direction. As a consequence,
it would be impossible to obtain an ordered picture of the trajectories, which will
inevitably cross each other.

Analytical Mechanics
As mentioned above, the ”-space for a system having n degrees of freedom is a
2n-dimensional space whose coordinates are q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn. It is sometimes
convenient to use a different type of phase space whose dimension is twice the
number of degrees of freedom possessed by each of the system’s particles. To
specify this issue, consider the case of a system made of N point-like particles, with
no constraints. In this case each particle (say, the jth one) has 3 degrees of freedom
and its dynamic state at the time t is determined by the 6 canonical coordinates
Nq1j; Nq2j; Nq3j, Np1j; Np2j; Np3j. Together, the latter identify a point Xj of a 6-dimensional
phase space called 
-space.4 At the time t the system as a whole is represented in
the 
-space by the set of N points X1; : : : ; XN.

an arbitrary function. These two properties have in fact the same origin, namely,
the description based upon a Lagrangian function. In fact, as shown in Sect. 4.2, a
Lagrangian description is possible also in the case of a system having a continuous
distribution of the degrees of freedom like, for instance, the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

1.10.3
Variational Calculus with Constraints
In several problems it is required that the function w, introduced in Sect. 1.2 as the
extremum function of functional (1.1), be able to fulﬁll one or more constraints. By
way of example consider the constraint
G0 D
Z b
a
g0.w; Pw; / d ;
(1.62)
where the function g0 and the number G0 are prescribed. A typical case where (1.62)
occurs is that of ﬁnding the maximum area bounded by a perimeter of given
length (Dido’s problem). For this reason, extremum problems having a constraint
like (1.62) are called isoperimetric even when they have no relation with geometry
[143, Par. 4-1].
To tackle the problem one extends the deﬁnition of the variation of w by letting
ıw D ˛11 C ˛22, where 1./, 2./ are arbitrary functions that are differentiable
in the interior of Œa; b and fulﬁll the conditions 1.a/ D 1.b/ D 0, 2.a/ D
2.b/ D 0. If w is an extremum function of G that fulﬁlls (1.62), replacing w with
wCıw transforms (1.1, 1.62) to a pair of functions of the ˛1, ˛2 parameters, namely,
G D G.˛1; ˛2/ ;
G0.˛1; ˛2/ D G0.0; 0/ D const.
(1.63)
The ﬁrst of (1.63) has an extremum at ˛1 D ˛2 D 0, while the second one
establishes a relation between ˛1 and ˛2. The problem is thus reduced to that of
calculating a constrained extremum, and is solved by the method of the Lagrange
multipliers, described in Sect. B.6. For this, one considers the function G D
G.˛1; ˛2/ C  G0.˛1; ˛2/, with  an indeterminate parameter, and calculates the
free extremum of G by letting
@G
@˛1

0
D 0 ;
@G
@˛2

0
D 0 ;
(1.64)
where index 0 stands for ˛1 D ˛2 D 0. The rest of the calculation is the same
as in Sect. 1.2; the two relations (1.64) turn out to be equivalent to each other and
provide the same Euler equation. More speciﬁcally, from the deﬁnition of G and G0
as integrals of g and g0 one ﬁnds that the Euler equation of this case is obtained
from that of Sect. 1.2 by replacing g with g D g C g0:

As (1.65) is a second-order equation, its solution w contains two integration
constants. The  multiplier is an additional indeterminate constant. The three
constants are found from the constraint (1.62) and from the two relations provided
by the boundary or initial conditions of w.

An Interesting Example of Extremum Equation
Consider the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (1.51) for a single particle of mass m. Using
the Cartesian coordinates and a Hamiltonian function of the form
H D p2
2m C V.x1; x2; x3; t/ ;
p2 D p2
1 C p2
2 C p2

the Hamilton-Jacobi equation reads
@S

@qi

(1.67)
If V is independent of time, then H D E and the separation S D W  E t (Sect. 2.4)
yields @S=@t D E, grad S D grad W D p. It follows
j grad Wj2
2m
C V.x1; x2; x3/ D E :
(1.68)
Both Hamilton’s principal (S) and characteristic (W) functions have the dimensions
of an action and are deﬁned apart from an additive constant. Also, the form of
j grad Wj is uniquely deﬁned by that of V  E. In turn, E is prescribed by the initial
conditions of the particle’s motion.
Consider now the case where E  V within a closed domain  whose boundary
is @. As grad W is real, the motion of the particle is conﬁned within , and grad W
vanishes at the boundary @. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation for W (1.68) is recast
in a different form by introducing an auxiliary function w such that
w D w0 exp.W=/ ;
(1.69)
with  a constant having the dimensions of an action. The other constant w0 is used
for prescribing the dimensions of w. Apart from this, the choice of w0 is arbitrary
due to the arbitrariness of the additive constant of W. Taking the gradient of (1.69)
yields  grad w D w grad W, with w ¤ 0 due to the deﬁnition. As grad W vanishes
at the boundary, grad w vanishes there as well. As a consequence, w is constant over
the boundary. Inserting (1.69) into (1.68) yields
2

namely, the Schrödinger equation independent of time (7.44). This result shows that
the Schrödinger equation derives from a stronger constraint than that prescribed by
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
An immediate consequence of replacing the integral relation (1.72) with the
differential equation (1.73) is that the domain of w is not limited any more by
the condition E  V, but may extend to inﬁnity. Another consequence is that if
the boundary conditions are such that w vanishes over the boundary (which, as
said above, may also be placed at inﬁnity), then (1.73) is solvable only for speciﬁc
values of E, that form its spectrum of eigenvalues. Moreover it can be demonstrated,
basing on the form of the Schrödinger equation, that the condition E  Vmin must
be fulﬁlled (Sect. 8.2.3).
It is interesting to note another relation between the Schrödinger and the
Hamilton-Jacobi equations. For the sake of simplicity one takes the one-dimensional
case of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation expressed in terms of w (1.70):
2
2m .w0/2 C V.x/ w2 D E w2 ;
(1.74)
where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to x. The left-hand side of the

showing that the Schrödinger equation is actually the Euler equation of the

the Lagrange multiplier. This result holds also in the higher-dimensional cases
(Prob. 1.6), and is in fact the method originally used by Schrödinger to determine
the time-independent equation [118, Eqs. (23,24)].
1.10.5
Constant-Energy Surfaces
Consider the ”-space for a system having n degrees of freedom (Sect. 1.9). If the
system is conservative, the relation H.q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn/ D E introduces a
constraint among the canonical coordinates. Due to this, at each instant of time the
latter must belong to the .2n  1/-dimensional surface H D E of the phase space,
that is called constant-energy surface. As E is prescribed by the initial conditions,
the phase point of a conservative system always belongs to the same constant-energy
surface.
For a system having one degree of freedom the relation describing the constant-
energy surface reduces to H.q; p/ D E that describes a curve in the q p plane. The
corresponding state trajectory is a curve of the three-dimensional q p t space.

Chapter 2
Coordinate Transformations and Invariance
Properties
2.1
Introduction
An important generalization of the subject of coordinate transformation is that of
canonical transformation, which leads to the concept of generating function and,
through it, to the deﬁnition of the principal function and characteristic function
of Hamilton. The principal function is found to coincide with the solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation introduced in the previous chapter, thus showing the
equivalence of the approach based on the variational principles with that based on
the canonical transformations. Connected with the Hamiltonian formalism is also
the important concept of separability. Still based on Hamilton’s principal function is
the concept of phase velocity applied to a mechanical system, that brings about an
analogy with the electromagnetic theory. The aspects mentioned above give another
indication about the generality that is reached by the formalism of Analytical
Mechanics illustrated in this part of the book.
Another fundamental issue is that of the invariance properties of the mechanical
systems. It is shown that, basing only on the observation of symmetries possessed by
the Lagrangian function or other functions connected to it, one derives the existence
of invariance properties of the system. Among these are the constants of motion,
namely, the dynamic properties that are constant in time and are therefore known
from the motion’s initial condition.
Of special relevance among the constants of motion are the total energy, the total
momentum, and the total angular momentum of the system. The conservation of
the total energy is related to the uniformity of time, that of the total momentum is
related to the uniformity of space, and, ﬁnally, that of the total angular momentum
is related to the isotropy of space. Besides the theoretical interest connected to it,
the knowledge of a constant of motion is important also for practical purposes: by
introducing a known constraint among the canonical coordinates, it is of use in the
separation procedure.

Coordinate Transformations and Invariance Properties
This chapter completes the illustration of the basic principles of Analytical
Mechanics started in the previous one. The purpose of the two chapters is to
introduce a number of concepts that are not only useful per se, but also constitute a
basis for the concepts of Quantum Mechanics that are introduced in later chapters.
The ﬁrst subject is that of the canonical transformations, followed by the deﬁnition
and properties of the Hamilton characteristic function and of the phase velocity.
Then, the invariance properties that derive from the symmetries of the Lagrangian
function are discussed. The chapter continues with a short description of the
Maupertuis principle and of the expression of the angular momentum in spherical
coordinates. The last paragraphs deal with the linear motion and the action-angle
variables.
2.2
Canonical Transformations
Section 1.4 introduced the generalized coordinates q1; : : : ; qn that are deﬁned by
the ﬁrst of (1.26) starting from a set of Cartesian coordinates x1; : : : ; xn. From
this, one deﬁnes the generalized velocities Pqi and, from the second of (1.26),
calculates the Lagrangian function in the new variables L.q; Pq; t/. The conjugate
momenta pi are derived from the latter using the ﬁrst of (1.30) and, ﬁnally, the
new Hamiltonian function is determined from the second of (1.32). From this, the
Hamilton equations (1.42) in the new coordinates are deduced. The process depicted
here is a series of replacement, elimination, and differentiation steps.
Relations like (1.26), that transform a set of coordinates into another one, are
called point transformations. It has been observed in Sect. 1.6 that the canonical
coordinates q1; : : : ; qn, p1; : : : ; pn are mutually independent. It follows that the point
transformations are not the most general coordinate transformations, because they
act on the q1; : : : ; qn only. The most general transformations act simultaneously on
the generalized coordinate and momenta, hence they have the form

where qi; pi indicate the old canonical coordinates and Qqi; Qpi indicate the new ones. If
H is the Hamiltonian function in the old coordinates, introducing into H the inverse
transformations of (2.1) yields a function QH that depends on the new coordinates
and on time.

2.2
Canonical Transformations
27
For an arbitrary choice of the form of (2.1) it is not possible in general to deduce
from QH the Hamilton equations in the new coordinates. For this it is in fact necessary
to limit the choice of the transformation (2.1) to the cases where the resulting QH is a
Hamiltonian function proper, namely, it is such that
dQqi
dt D @ QH
@Qpi
;
dQpi
dt D @ QH
@Qqi
;
i D 1; : : : ; n :
(2.2)
are fulﬁlled. The transformations (2.1) that make (2.2) to hold are called canonical
transformations. The procedure by which the Hamilton equations in the old
coordinates are found has been illustrated in Sect. 1.6 and is based on the derivation
of the extremum equation of the action integral (1.45). To obtain (2.2) the same
calculation must be repeated based on the action integral deﬁned in the new
coordinates. It follows that for two sets of coordinates qi; pi and Qqi; Qpi connected
by a canonical transformation, the following must hold simultaneously:
S D
Z b

dt  H
!
dt ;
QS D
Z b

Qpi

(2.3)
The difference between the two integrals in (2.3) can be set equal to an arbitrary
constant because the calculation uses only the variations of S or QS. As the limits of
the two integrals are ﬁxed to the same values a and b, the constant can in turn be
written as the integral between a and b of the total time derivative of an arbitrary
function K. In this way the relation between the two integrands in (2.3) reads
n

(2.4)
It is worth reminding that in the derivation of the Hamilton equations in Sect. 1.7 it
is assumed that all variations of generalized coordinates and momenta vanish at the
integration limits. Here this applies to both the old and new sets of coordinates. As
a consequence, K can be made to depend on all 4 n coordinates qi, pi, Qqi, Qpi, and on
time t. Due to the 2 n relations (2.1) that deﬁne the canonical transformation, only
2 n coordinates are independent. As a consequence K can be made to depend on 2 n
coordinates chosen among the 4 n available ones, and on time. The most interesting
cases are those where K has one of the following forms [56, Sect. 9-1]:
K1 D K1.q; Qq; t/ ;
K2 D K2.q; Qp; t/ ;
K3 D K3.p; Qq; t/ ;
K4 D K4.p; Qp; t/ :

By way of example, select the ﬁrst form: replacing K1 into (2.4), calculating dK1=dt,
and multiplying both sides by dt yield

Regardless of the choice of K, the relation between the old and new Hamiltonian
function is always of the form QH D H C @K=@t. As the canonical transformation is
completely determined when K is prescribed, the latter is called generating function
of the canonical transformation. Two interesting examples are those produced by
the generating functions F1 D Pn
iD1 qiQqi and F2 D Pn
iD1 qiQpi. Applying (2.7) to
F1 yields Qqi D pi and Qpi D qi. As a consequence, the effect of the transformation
generated by F1 is that of exchanging the roles of the generalized coordinates and
momenta. This result shows that the distinction between coordinates and momenta
is not fundamental, namely, these two groups of variables globally constitute a
set of 2 n independent coordinates. Applying (2.9) to F2 provides the identical
transformation Qqi D qi, Qpi D pi. A generalization of this example is found using
F2 D Pn
iD1 zi.q; t/Qpi, where zi are arbitrary functions. The new coordinates are in
this case Qqi D zi.q; t/ which, as indicated at the beginning of this section, are point
transformations. This example shows that all point transformations are canonical.
2.3
An Application of the Canonical Transformation
The discussion of Sect. 2.2 has shown that a canonical transformation based on an
arbitrary generating function K brings a Hamiltonian function H.q; p; t/ into a new
one QH.Qq; Qp; t/. One may then exploit the arbitrariness of K to obtain the form of QH
that is most convenient for solving the problem in hand. For instance, remembering
the deﬁnition of cyclic coordinate given in Sect. 1.6, one may seek a transformation
such that the new canonical coordinates Qqi ; Qpi are all cyclic. In this case, thanks
to (2.2), it is dQqi=dt D @ QH=@Qpi D 0, dQpi=dt D @ QH=@Qqi D 0, namely, each new
canonical coordinate is a constant of motion.
The simplest way to obtain this result is to set the new Hamiltonian function
equal to zero. Remembering from Sect. 2.2 that in every canonical transformation
the relation between the old and new Hamiltonian function is QH D H C @K=@t,
one ﬁnds in this case the relation @K=@t C H D 0. To proceed it is convenient to
choose a generating function of the K2 D K2.q; Qp; t/ type in which, as noted above,
the new momenta Qpi are constants of motion. Given that the aim is to obtain the
relation QH D 0, the generating function of this problem is the particular function
of the coordinates qi, Qpi, and t, that fulﬁlls the equation @K2=@t C H D 0. In
other terms, the generating function becomes the problem’s unknown. A comparison
with (1.51) shows that the equation to be solved is that of Hamilton-Jacobi, and that
K2 coincides with Hamilton’s principal function S.

Coordinate Transformations and Invariance Properties
As mentioned in Sect. 1.7, (1.51) is a ﬁrst-order, partial differential equation in
the unknown S and in the nC1 variables q1; : : : ; qn; t. As one of the nC1 integration
constants can be set to zero, the actual integration constants are n. This seems
contradictory because the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is expected to be equivalent
to those of Hamilton or Lagrange for the description of the system’s motion. As a
consequence, the number of constants involved should be 2 n. The contradiction is
easily removed by observing that n more constants appear in S, to be identiﬁed with
the new momenta Qp1; : : : ; Qpn: remembering the canonical transformations (2.9) to

Calculating the ﬁrst of (2.14) at the initial time t D a yields a set of n algebraic
equations in the n unknowns Qp1; : : : ; Qpn. In fact, at t D a the old canonical
coordinates qi; pi are known because they are the problem’s initial conditions.
The solution of such algebraic equations yields the ﬁrst set of motion’s constants
Qp1; : : : ; Qpn. Then, one considers the second of (2.14) at t D a, whose right-hand
sides, at this point of the procedure, are known. As a consequence, the second
of (2.14) yields the new generalized coordinates Qq1; : : : ; Qqn, that are the second set
of motion’s constants.
It is worth observing that the procedure depicted above provides also the
time evolution of the old canonical coordinates. In fact, after all constants
have been calculated, Eq. (2.14) forms 2 n relations in the 2 n C 1 variables
q1; : : : ; qn ; p1; : : : ; pn ; t. From them one extracts the relations q1 D q1.t/; : : : ; pn D
pn.t/. This shows that the Hamilton-Jacobi picture is equivalent to those based on
the Hamilton or Lagrange equations for the solution of the mechanical problem.

Solving (2.15) becomes simpler if one of the coordinates, say qi, and the cor-
responding momentum pi D @S=@qi appear in (2.15) only through a relation
ci D ci.qi; @S=@qi/ that does not contain any other coordinate, nor derivatives with
respect to them, nor time. In this case qi is called separable coordinate and the
solution of (2.15) can be written as S D Si C Wi, where Si depends only on qi
and Wi depends on the other coordinates and time [84, Sect. 48]. Replacing this
expression of S into (2.15) and extracting ci yield a relation of the form Ci D ci with

where C does not contain qi nor the corresponding derivative. The solution of the
ﬁrst of (2.17) provides Si.qi/. The latter contains two constants, namely ci0 and
the integration constant. As noted earlier, the latter can be set to zero because an
additive constant on S is irrelevant. In conclusion, ci0 is the only constant that
remains after this step. In turn, the solution of the second of (2.17), which is an
n-variable differential equation, contains n more constant, one of which is additive
and can be disregarded. It follows that the total number of integration constants in
the set (2.17) is still n.
If all coordinates are separable one has S D Pn
iD1 Si.qi/ and the problem is
solved by n individual integrations (an example is given in Sect. 3.10). In this case
one says that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is completely separable. A special case
of separable coordinate is that of the cyclic coordinate. If qi is cyclic, in fact, (2.17)
reduces to @Si=@qi D ci0, whence Si D ci0qi and S D ci0qi C Wi. If the cyclic

with the hypothesis that H does not depend on t. Using the symbol W instead of

2.5
Phase Velocity
The dynamics of a mechanical system can be obtained from Hamilton’s principal
function S.q; Qp; t/ as shown in Sect. 2.3. After S has been determined it is possible to
build up an interesting geometrical construction, that is shown below. The indication
of the constants Qpi is omitted for the sake of conciseness.
To begin, ﬁx the time t and let S.q; t/ D S0, where S0 is some constant. This
relation describes a surface belonging to the conﬁguration space q1 ; : : : ; qn. Now
change the time by dt: the corresponding variation in S is obtained from (1.50) and
reads dS D Pn
iD1 pidqi  Hdt D p  dq  Hdt. In this relation each component
pi D @S=@qi is calculated in terms of the coordinates q1 ; : : : ; qn at the instant t,
hence the vector p D gradqS is a function of q calculated at that instant. If q belongs
to the surface S D S0, then p is normal to the surface at q. Now let S0 D SCdS D S0,
where S0 is the same constant as before. The relation S0.q; t/ D S0 provides the new
surface into which S D S0 evolves in the interval dt. As both S D S0, S C dS D S0
hold, it must be dS D 0, namely, p  dq D Hdt.
When H has no explicit dependence on t, thanks to (2.19) the relation p  dq D
Hdt becomes p  dq D E dt, with p D gradqW. In this case, letting ' be the angle
between the vectors p and dq (whose moduli are indicated with p, dq), and excluding
the points where p D 0, one obtains
cos ' dq
dt D E
p :
(2.20)
The product cos ' dq in (2.20) is the projection of dq over the direction of p, hence
it provides the variation of q in the direction normal to the surface S D S0. When
the Cartesian coordinates are used, the product cos ' dq is a length and the left-hand
side of (2.20) is a velocity that provides the displacement of the point q during the
time interval dt and in the direction normal to the surface S D S0.
As shown above, the vector p is normal to the S D S0 surface at each point
of the latter. Consider for simplicity the case of a single particle of mass m in the
conservative case, and use the Cartesian coordinates; from p D m Pq one ﬁnds that at
each instant the surface S D S0 is normal to the particle’s trajectory. This makes the
surface S D S0 the analogue of the constant-phase surface found in the wave theory
(e.g., Sect. 5.9). For this reason, cos ' dq=dt is called phase velocity.
Due to its deﬁnition, the phase velocity depends on the position q and is the
velocity with which each point of the S D S0 surface moves. It is worth adding that
the phase velocity does not coincide with the actual velocity of any of the system’s
particles. To show this it sufﬁces to consider the single particle’s case with p D m Pq:
from (2.20) one ﬁnds that the modulus of the phase velocity is in fact inversely
proportional to that of the particle.

Invariance Properties
33
2.6
Invariance Properties
A number of dynamic properties of the system of particles under consideration
can be inferred directly from the form of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function,
without the need of solving the motion’s equations. An example is the conservation
of the momentum conjugate to a cyclic coordinate (Sect. 1.6). Other properties are
discussed below.
2.6.1
Time Reversal
It is found by inspection that the expression (1.22) of the system’s kinetic energy in
Cartesian coordinates is invariant when t is replaced with t (time reversal). A rather
lengthy calculation based on the chain-differentiation rule shows that this property
still holds after a coordinate transformation.
In some cases the whole Lagrangian function is invariant under time reversal.
This makes the Lagrange equations (1.28) invariant as well. Assume that (1.28) are
solved starting from a given initial condition at t D a to the ﬁnal instant t D b. Then,
replace t with t0 D t and solve the Lagrange equations again, using qi.t D b/ and
Pqi.t D b/ as initial conditions. Letting q0
i D dqi=dt0 D Pqi, (1.28) become

i/ D d

;
i D 1; : : : ; n
(2.21)
where, due to the hypothesis of invariance, the Lagrangian function is the same as
that used to describe the motion from t D a to t D b. It follows that the trajectories of
the second motion are equal to those of the ﬁrst one. Moreover, the initial velocities
of the second motion, calculated at t0 D b, are opposite to those of the ﬁrst motion
at the same point. Due to the arbitrariness of b, at each point of a trajectory the
velocity described by the time t0 is opposite to that described by t. A motion having
this property is called reversible.
Taking the examples of Sect. 1.3 and remembering the form (1.12, 1.18) of the
corresponding Lagrangian functions one ﬁnds that, in the ﬁrst example, the motion
is reversible if the potential energy V is invariant under time reversal, namely,
V.t/ D V.t/, while in the second example the motion is reversible if '.t/ D '.t/
and A.t/ D A.t/.
2.6.2
Translation of Time
Consider the case where the Hamiltonian function is invariant with respect to
translations of the origin of time. The invariance holds also for an inﬁnitesimal

translation dt, hence it is dH=dt D 0. In other terms H is a constant of motion. When
this happens, as illustrated in Sect. 1.6, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions
have no explicit dependence on time, and vice versa.
2.6.3
Translation of the Coordinates
Another interesting case occurs when the Lagrangian function is invariant with
respect to translations of the coordinates’ origin. By way of example consider an
N-particle system with no constraints, whence n D 3N, and use the Cartesian
coordinates xjs. Here the ﬁrst index is associated with the particles and the second
one with the axes. Then, choose an inﬁnitesimal translation dh1 in the direction of
the ﬁrst axis and, similarly, inﬁnitesimal translations dh2 and dh3 in the other two
directions. Thus, each coordinate xj1, j D 1; : : : ; N within the Lagrangian function
is replaced by xj1 C dh1, and so on. The translation invariance then yields

Each sum in (2.22) vanishes independently of the others due to the arbitrariness of
the translations. Taking the sum multiplying dh1 and using (1.28) yield

of the system of particles. The other two components are treated in the same manner.
In conclusion, if the Lagrangian function is invariant with respect to translations of
the coordinates’ origin, then the total momentum of the system is a constant of
motion.
The above reasoning applies independently to each axis. As a consequence, if
the Lagrangian function is such that the sum PN
jD1 @L=@xj1 vanishes, while the
analogous sums associated with the other two axes do not vanish, then P1 is a
constant of motion, while P2, P3 are not.
An important example of a Lagrangian function, that is invariant with respect to
translations of the coordinates’ origin, is found when the force Fi acting on the ith

particle derives from a potential energy V that depends only on the relative distances
rjk D jrj  rkj among the particles, k ¤ j. An example is given in Sect. 3.7.
2.6.4
Rotation of the Coordinates
Consider the case where the Lagrangian function is invariant with respect to
rotations of the coordinates around an axis that crosses the origin. Like in Sect. 2.6.3
a system of N particles with no constraints is assumed, and the Cartesian coordinates
are used. Let   be the plane that contains the origin and is normal to the rotation
axis. It is convenient to use on   a polar reference (Sect. B.2) in which the rotation
is deﬁned over   by the angle '. In turn, let #j be the angle between the rotation
axis and the position vector rj D .xj1; xj2; xj3/ of the jth particle. The meaning of the
angles is the same as in Fig. B.1, where the axes x; y deﬁne plane  ; then, #j and
rj are represented by # and r of the ﬁgure, respectively. If an inﬁnitesimal rotation
d' is considered, the position vector rj undergoes a variation drj parallel to   and
of magnitude jdrjj D rj sin #j d'. To specify the direction of drj one takes the unit
vector a of the rotation axis and associates with the rotation the vector a d' such
that
drj D a d' ^ rj :

The corresponding variations dPrj of the velocities are found by differentiating (2.25)

is the total angular momentum of the system of particles. In conclusion, if the

momentum M over the rotation axis is a constant of motion.
2.7
Maupertuis Principle
Besides the Hamilton principle described in Sect. 1.3.4, other variational principles
exist. Among them is the Maupertuis, or least action, principle, that applies to a
particle subjected to conservative forces. Let V D V.x1; x2; x3/ be the potential
energy and E D const the total energy, and let A and B indicate the two points of the
.x1; x2; x3/ space that limit the trajectory of the particle. The Maupertuis principle
states that the natural trajectory between A and B is the one that minimizes the

term “least action”: in fact, the relation p2=.2m/ D m u2=2 D E  V shows that the
integrand
p
E  V is proportional to the particle’s momentum p; as a multiplicative
constant is irrelevant for calculating the extremum functions, the minimization of G
is equivalent to that of the action
R

To calculate the extremum functions of (2.30) it is convenient to parametrize the
coordinates in the form xi D xi./, where the parameter  takes the same limiting
values, say,  D a at A and  D b at B, for the natural and all the virtual trajectories.

Spherical Coordinates—Angular Momentum
Consider a single particle of mass m and use the transformation from the Cartesian
(x; y; z) to the spherical (r; #; ') coordinates shown in Sect. B.1. The kinetic energy
is given by (B.7), namely,
T D m
2 .Pr2 C r2 P#2 C r2 P'2 sin2 #/ :

If M is a constant of motion, (2.40) shows that the kinetic energy depends on r and

p' D Mz ;
(2.41)
namely, the component along the z axis of the angular momentum turns out to be
the momentum conjugate to the ' coordinate. The latter describes the rotations
along the same axis. In contrast, the other two components of M are not conjugate
momenta. This result is due to the asymmetry of the relations (B.1) that connect the
Cartesian to the spherical coordinates, and does not ascribe any privileged role to
the z axis. In fact, by exchanging the Cartesian axes one makes p' to coincide with
Mx or My.
Another example refers to a particle of mass m and charge e subjected to an
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Remembering (1.33) one has L D .1=2/ m u2  e U C e u 

(2.44)
that coincides with the component of the angular momentum M D r ^ p D r ^

acting onto the particle derives from an electromagnetic ﬁeld.

function of this type is a constant of motion whence, remembering that here it is
p D m Px,

2 m Px2 C V.x/ D E D const.
(2.45)
The constant E is called total energy. Its value is given by the initial conditions
x0 D x.t D a/; Px0 D Px.t D a/. As the kinetic energy m Px2=2 cannot be negative,
the motion is possible only in the intervals of the x axis such that V.x/  E. In
particular, the velocity Px vanishes at the points where V D E. Instead, the intervals
where V > E cannot be reached by the particle. Equation (2.45) is separable and
provides a relation of the form t D t.x/,

By way of example consider a situation like that shown in Fig. 2.1, where it is
assumed that to the right of xC the potential energy V keeps decreasing as x ! 1.
If the initial position of the particle is x0 D xC, there the velocity vanishes and
the particle is subjected to a positive force F D dV=dx > 0. As a consequence,
the particle’s motion will always be oriented to the right starting from xC. Such a
motion is called unlimited. If the initial position is x0 > xC and the initial velocity
is negative, the particle moves to the left until it reaches the position xC, where it
bounces back. The subsequent motion is the same as described above.

Coordinate Transformations and Invariance Properties
A different situation arises when the initial position of the particle belongs to
an interval limited by two zeros of the function E  V.x/ like, e.g., xA and xB in
Fig. 2.1. The motion is conﬁned between xA and xB and, for this reason, is called
limited. The particle bounces back and forth endlessly under the effect of a force
that does not depend on time. As a consequence, the time necessary to complete
a cycle xA ! xB ! xA is the same for each cycle. In other terms, the motion is
periodic in time. Also, from (2.46) it is found by inspection that the time spent by
the particle in the xA ! xB part of the cycle is the same as that spent in the xB ! xA
part. The period of the oscillation is then found to be

Action-Angle Variables
Consider a linear, conservative motion of constant energy E (Sect. 2.9) and let q, p
be two canonical coordinates describing it. The following hold
H.q; p/ D E ;
p D p.q; E/ :
(2.48)
The second of (2.48) is derived from the ﬁrst one by solving for the momentum, and
provides the phase trajectory (Sect. 1.9) starting from the initial conditions q0, p0
of the motion. As shown below, in several mechanical systems of interest the phase
trajectory has some special characteristic that is worth examining.
Consider, ﬁrst, the situation where the phase trajectory is closed: in this case,
after a time T has elapsed from t D 0, the canonical coordinates take again the
values q0, p0. As a consequence, for t > T the motion repeats itself, and so on. It
follows that both q and p are periodic functions of time with the same period T.
As discussed in Sect. 2.9, this type of periodic motion, in which both q and p are
bounded, is typically found when the initial position q0 lies between two zeros of
E  V, and is of the oscillatory type. It is also indicated with the astronomical term
libration.
A second important situation occurs when p is a periodic function of q. In
this type of motion q is unbounded. However, when q increases by a period the
conﬁguration of the mechanical system remains practically unchanged. In fact, in
this type of motion the canonical coordinate q is always an angle of rotation: the
motion is still periodic and is referred to as rotation. Note that the same mechanical

system may give rise to a libration or a rotation, depending on the motion’s initial
conditions: a typical example is that of the simple pendulum where q is identiﬁed
with the angle of deﬂection [56, Chap. 10.6]. The action variable is deﬁned as
J.E/ D
I
p.q; E/ dq ;
(2.49)
where the integral is carried out over a complete period of libration or rotation,
depending on the case under investigation. The name given to J stems from the
fact that, as mentioned in Sect. 1.5, the product q p has the units of an action in all
coordinate sets. The action variable is a constant of motion because it depends on E
only. Inverting J.E/ yields H D H.J/. Now one applies a canonical transformation
generated by a Hamilton characteristic function of the form W
D
W.q; J/.
Remembering the procedure depicted in Sect. 2.4, W is the solution of
H

q; @W


D E :
(2.50)
Applying (2.14) one ﬁnds the generalized coordinate w D @W=@J, called angle
variable, conjugate to J. The pair J; w constitutes the set of canonical coordinates
called action-angle variables. Finally, the Hamilton equations in the new coordi-
nates read
Pw D @H
@J D const ;
PJ D @H
@w D 0 :
(2.51)
The time evolution of the action-angle variables is then w D Pw t C w0, J D const.
From the ﬁrst of (2.51) it also follows that the units of Pw are those of a frequency.
The usefulness of the action-angle variables becomes apparent when one calculates
the change w over a complete libration or rotation cycle of q:
w D
I
dw D
I @w
@q dq D
I
@2W
@q @J dq D d
dJ
I @W
@q dq D 1 ;
(2.52)
where the last equality derives from combining p D @W=@q with (2.49). On the
other hand, if T is the time necessary for completing a cycle of q, then it is w D
w.T/w.0/ D Pw T, whence Pw D 1=T. Thus, the frequency  D Pw is that associated
with the periodic motion of q. In conclusion, the action-angle variables provide a
straightforward method to determine the frequency of a periodic motion without the
need of solving the motion equation. The method is applicable also to conservative
systems having more than one degree of freedom, provided there exists at least one
set of coordinates in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is completely separable
[56, Chap. 10.7].

Inﬁnitesimal Canonical Transformations
Consider a system with n degrees of freedom whose Hamiltonian function is
H.q1; : : : ; qn; p1; : : : ; pn; t/. Remembering (1.42) one ﬁnds that the canonical coor-
dinates at t Cdt are expressed, in terms of the same coordinates at t, by the relations
qi C dqi D qi C @H
@pi
dt ;
pi C dpi D pi  @H
@qi
dt :
(2.53)
Letting Qqi D qi C dqi, Qpi D pi C dpi gives (2.53) the same form as (2.1),
namely, that of a coordinate transformation. It is interesting to check whether such a
transformation is canonical. For this, one notes that the transformation (2.53) differs
by inﬁnitesimal quantities from the identical transformation Qqi D qi, Qpi D pi; as a
consequence one expects the generating function of (2.53), if it exists, to differ by an
inﬁnitesimal function from F2 D Pn
iD1 qi Qpi which, as shown in Sect. 2.2, generates
the identical transformation. One then lets
K2 D
n
X
iD1
qi Qpi C  G.q; Qp; t/ ;
(2.54)
where  is an inﬁnitesimal quantity. From the ﬁrst two equations in (2.9) it follows
pi D @K2
@qi
D Qpi C  @G
@qi
;
Qqi D @K2
@Qpi
D qi C  @G
@Qpi
:
(2.55)
In the last term of (2.55) one may replace Qpi with pi on account of the fact that
the difference between  @G=@Qpi and  @G=@pi is inﬁnitesimal of a higher order.
Then, letting  D dt, G.q; p; t/ D H.q; p; t/, and K2 D Pn
iD1 qi Qpi C H.q; p; t/ dt,
makes (2.55) identical to (2.53). Note that this replacement transforms the third
of (2.9) into QH D H C .@H=@t/ dt, as should be (compare with (1.44)).
The above reasoning shows that the H dt term in (2.54) generates a canonical
transformation that produces the variations of the canonical coordinates in the time
interval dt. Such a transformation is called inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation.
On the other hand, as the application of more than one canonical transformation
is still canonical, the evolution of the coordinates qi; pi during a ﬁnite interval of
time can be thought of as produced by a sequence of inﬁnitesimal canonical trans-
formations generated by the Hamiltonian function. In other terms, the Hamiltonian
function generates the motion of the system.

2.11.2
Constants of Motion
It has been shown in Sect. 2.11.1 that a sequence of inﬁnitesimal canonical trans-
formation generated by the Hamiltonian function determines the time evolution of
the canonical coordinates qi; pi. If such a sequence starts with the initial conditions
qi0; pi0, at some later time t the transformation equations (2.53) take the form
qi D qi.q0; p0; t/ ;
pi D pi.q0; p0; t/ :
(2.56)
The relations (2.56) are nothing else than the solution of the mechanical problem;
in fact, they express the canonical coordinates at time t, given the initial conditions.
From another viewpoint, they show that the solution of the problem contains 2 n
constants. They are not necessarily constants of motion, in fact, their values at t > 0
are in general different from those at t D 0. If the system has extra properties
(like, e.g., the invariance properties discussed in Sect. 2.6), it also has one or more
constants of motion. The latter keep the value that they possessed at t D 0, so they
are expressible as combinations of the canonical coordinates at t D 0; by way of
example, the total energy E of a single particle subjected to a conservative force
reads E D .p2
01 C p2
02 C p2
03/=.2 m/ C V.x10; x20; x30/.
For a system having n degrees of freedom the total number of independent
combinations of the initial conditions cannot exceed the number of the initial
conditions themselves. As a consequence, for such a system the maximum number
of independent constants of motion is 2 n.

Introduction
This chapter provides a number of important examples of application of the
principles of Analytical Mechanics. The examples are chosen with reference to the
applications to Quantum Mechanics shown in later chapters. The ﬁrst sections treat
the problems of the square well, linear harmonic oscillator, and central motion. The
subsequent sections deal with the two-particle interaction: ﬁrst, the description of
the collision is given, along with the calculation of the energy exchange involved
in it, with no reference to the form of the potential energy; this is followed by the
treatment of the collision when the potential energy is of the repulsive-Coulomb
type. The chapter continues with the treatment of a system of strongly bound
particles: the diagonalization of its Hamiltonian function shows that the motion
of the particles is a superposition of harmonic oscillations. Finally, the motion
of a particle subjected to a periodic potential energy is analyzed, including the
case where a weak perturbation is superimposed to the periodic part. A number
of complements are also given, that include the treatment of the collision with a
potential energy of the attractive-Coulomb type, and that of the collision of two
relativistic particles.
3.2
Particle in a Square Well
As a ﬁrst example of linear motion consider the case of a potential energy V of the
form shown in Fig. 3.1. Such a potential energy is called square well and is to be
understood as the limiting case of a potential energy well whose sides have a ﬁnite,
though very large, slope. It follows that the force F D dV=dx is everywhere equal
to zero with the exception of the two points xM and CxM, where it tends to C1

and 1, respectively. From the discussion of Sect. 2.9 it follows that the case E < 0
is forbidden. The motion of the particle is ﬁnite for 0  E  V0, while it is inﬁnite
for E > V0.
Considering the 0  E  V0 case ﬁrst, the motion is conﬁned within the well
and the velocity of the particle is constant in the interval xM < x < CxM, where
the Hamiltonian function yields m Px2=2 D E. If the particle’s motion is oriented to
the right, the velocity is Px D
p
2 E=m. When the particle reaches the position xM
its velocity reverses instantly to become Px D 
p
2 E=m. The motion continues at a
constant velocity until the particle reaches the position xM where it reverses again,
and so on. As the spatial interval corresponding to a full cycle is 4 xM, the oscillation
period is T D
p
8 m=E xM.
To treat the E > V0 case assume that the particle is initially at a position x < xM
with a motion oriented to the right. The Hamiltonian function outside the well yields
m Px2=2 C V0 D E. The constant velocity is Px D
p
2 .E  V0/=m until the particle
reaches the position xM. There the velocity increases abruptly to Px D
p
2 E=m and
keeps this value until the particle reaches the other edge of the well, CxM. There,
the velocity decreases abruptly back to the initial value Px D
p
2 .E  V0/=m, and
the particle continues its motion at a constant velocity in the positive direction.
3.3
Linear Harmonic Oscillator
An important example of linear motion is found when the force derives from a
potential energy of the form V D c x2=2, with c > 0. The force acting on the
particle turns out to be F D dV=dx D c x, namely, it is linear with respect to x,
vanishes at x D 0, and has a modulus that increases as the particle departs from the
origin. Also, due to the positiveness of c, the force is always directed towards the
origin. A force of this type is also called linear elastic force, and c is called elastic
constant (Fig. 3.2).
From the discussion of Sect. 2.9 it follows that the case E < 0 is forbidden. The
motion of the particle is always ﬁnite because for any E  0 it is conﬁned between

Due to the form of (3.2), a particle whose motion is derived from the Hamiltonian

T depends on the two parameters m, c appearing in the Hamiltonian function, but
not on the total energy (in other terms, for a given pair m; c the oscillation period
does not depend on the initial conditions). As mentioned in Sect. 2.9, this is an
exceptional case.

potential energy of the form V D V.r/, where r D

depends on r only and is oriented along r. For this reason it is called central force. In
turn, the point whence the force originates (in this case, the origin of the reference)
is called center of force. The corresponding Lagrangian function
L D 1
2 mPr2  V.r/ ;
p D m Pr ;

(3.4)
turns out to be invariant under any rotation (Sect. 2.6.4). Remembering (2.28, 2.29),
this type of invariance means that the projection of the angular momentum M onto
any direction is conserved. It follows that for a particle acted upon by a central force,
the vector M itself is conserved. On the other hand, it is M D r^m Pr, so the constant
angular momentum is ﬁxed by the initial conditions of the motion.
As M is normal to the plane deﬁned by r and Pr, the trajectory of the particle lies
always on such a plane. It is then useful to select the Cartesian reference by aligning,
e.g., the z axis with M. In this way, the trajectory belongs to the x; y plane and
two coordinates eventually sufﬁce to describe the motion. Turning to the spherical
coordinates (B.1) and using (2.40) yields the Hamiltonian function

extremum of the possible values of r. In this way the sign of t and '  '0 changes

from the origin to the point of coordinates r0; '0, and the evolution of the particle’s
motion over each half of the trajectory is symmetric with respect to time.
3.5
Two-Particle Collision
Consider a system made of two particles whose masses are m1, m2. The system
is isolated, namely, the particles are not subjected to any forces apart those due
to the mutual interaction. As a consequence, the Lagrangian function is invariant
under coordinate translations, and the Hamiltonian function is invariant under time
translations. Thus, as shown in Sect. 2.6, the total momentum and total energy of
the system are conserved.
The type of motion that is considered is such that the distance between the
particles is initially so large as to make the interaction negligible. The interaction
becomes signiﬁcant when the particles come closer to each other; when they move
apart, the interaction becomes negligible again. This type of interaction is called
collision. The values of the dynamic quantities that hold when the interaction is
negligible are indicated as asymptotic values. The labels a and b will be used to
mark the asymptotic values before and after the interaction, respectively.
It is worth specifying that it is assumed that the collision does not change the
internal state of the particles (for this reason it is more appropriately termed elastic
collision [84, Sect. 17]). When the distance is sufﬁciently large, the particles can
be considered as isolated: they move at a constant velocity and the total energy of
the system is purely kinetic, Ea D Ta and Eb D Tb. On the other hand, due to
the invariance under time translation the total energy of the system is conserved,
Eb D Ea. In conclusion it is Tb D Ta, namely, in an elastic collision the asymptotic
kinetic energy of the system is conserved.
An analysis of the collision based only on the asymptotic values is incomplete
because it does not take into account the details of the interaction between the two
particles. However it provides a number of useful results, so it is worth pursuing.

the center of mass and the relative position of the particles are

To complete the asymptotic analysis of the two-particle collision it is useful to
choose for O a reference such that v2a D 0. In this case (3.10) yields va D v1a,
whence the total momentum reads .m1 C m2/ PRa D m1v1a D m1va. Remembering

This relation allows one to calculate, in reference O where the particle of mass m2
is initially at rest, the modulus of the ﬁnal velocity of this particle in terms of the
initial velocity of the other particle and of angle 	. As only v1a is prescribed, the two
quantities v2b and 	 cannot be determined separately. The reason for this (already
mentioned in Sect. 3.5) is that (3.21) is deduced using the motion’s asymptotic
conditions without considering the interaction’s details. In fact, the calculation is
based only on the momentum and total-energy conservation and on the hypothesis
that the collision is elastic. From (3.21) one derives the relation between the kinetic

The maximum variation is T2b.	 D ˙/. The conservation relation for the kinetic

Although expressions (3.21–3.24) are compact, the use of angle 	 is inconvenient.
It is preferable to use the angle, say  , between vectors v1b and v1a D va that
belong to the same reference O (Fig. 3.7).1 A scalar multiplication by v1a of the
conservation relation for momentum, m1v1b D m1v1a  m2v2b, followed by the

Using (3.25) one expresses (3.21–3.24) in terms of the deﬂection  (in reference

the other particle is deﬂected, but its kinetic energy is left unchanged.

Central Motion in the Two-Particle Interaction
Consider an isolated two-particle system where the force acting on each particle
derives from a potential energy V D V.r1; r2/. Using the symbols deﬁned in
Sect. 3.5 yields the Lagrangian function L D m1v2
1=2 C m2v2
2=2  V.r1; r2/. Now
assume that the potential energy V depends on the position of the two particles only
through the modulus of their distance, r D jr1  r2j. In this case it is convenient to
use the coordinates and velocities relative to the center of mass, (3.12–3.17), to ﬁnd
L D 1

2 m Ps2  V.s/ ;
Ps D jPsj D juj :
(3.27)
As discussed in Sects. 2.6.3 and 3.5 the total momentum is conserved, whence PR
is constant. Another way of proving this property is noting that the components
of R are cyclic (Sect. 1.6). The ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of (3.27), being
a constant, does not inﬂuence the subsequent calculations. The remaining terms, in
turn, are identical to those of (3.4). This shows that when in a two-particle system the
potential energy depends only on the relative distance, adopting suitable coordinates
makes the problem identical to that of the central motion. One can then exploit
the results of Sect. 3.4. Once the time evolution of s is found, the description of
the motion of the individual particles is recovered from (3.12) to (3.17), where the
constant PR is determined by the initial conditions.
The total energy of the two-particle system is conserved and, in the new
reference, it reads

The total angular momentum is constant as well. Starting from the original reference
and using (3.12–3.17) yields
M D r1 ^ m1v1 C r2 ^ m2v2 D .m1 C m2/ R ^ PR C m s ^ u :
(3.29)
The constancy of PR yields R D R0 C PR t, with R0 the initial value of R, whence
.R0 C PR t/ ^ PR D R0 ^ PR. Thus, the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of (3.29) is
constant, which makes MB D m s^u a constant as well. The latter vector is parallel
to M because the motion is conﬁned to a ﬁxed plane (Sect. 3.4). Then, aligning
the z axis with M, turning to polar coordinates over the x; y plane (sx D s cos ',
sy D s sin '), and using (3.8), one ﬁnds

is the scalar coefﬁcient of MB D MBk, with k the unit vector of the z axis. As a
consequence, MB may have a sign. As observed in Sect. 2.9, the admissible values
of s are those belonging to the interval such that EB  Ve.s/. If two or more disjoint
intervals exist that have this property, the actual interval of the motion is determined
by the initial conditions. The motion is limited or unlimited, depending on the extent
of this interval.
The analysis cannot be pursued further unless the form of the potential energy V
is speciﬁed. This is done in Sect. 3.8 with reference to the Coulomb case.
3.8
Coulomb Field
An important example is that of a potential energy of the form V / 1=r that
occurs for the gravitational and for the electrostatic force. In the latter case the term
Coulomb potential energy is used for V, that reads

(3.31)
with q > 0 the elementary electric charge, Z1 q and Z2 q the absolute value of the net

ﬁnally,  D 1 .1/ in the repulsive (attractive) case. The form of V ﬁxes the additive
constant of the energy so that V.1/ D 0. The repulsive case only is considered here,

(Sect. 3.4). The deﬁnitions (3.32, 3.33) are now inserted into the expression (3.30)
of the particle’s trajectory. To calculate the integral it is convenient to use a new
variable w such that .s0  /=.  / D .2  s2

Next, the trajectory in the Cartesian reference sx; sy is found by replacing (3.35) into
sx D s cos ', sy D s sin ' and eliminating s from the pair sx.s/, sy.s/ thus found.
A graphic example is given in Fig. 3.4. It is worth observing that in the derivation
of (3.35) the factor jj appears twice, in such a way as to compensate for the sign of
. The result then holds irrespective of the actual sign of MB D p2m EB . It still
holds for MB D 0, that yields '.s/ D '0; such a case corresponds to a straight line
crossing the origin of the s; ' reference: along this line the modulus s of the relative
position decreases until it reaches s0, then it increases from this point on.
When MB ¤ 0 the angles corresponding to the asymptotic conditions of the
motion are found by letting s ! 1, namely, 'a D '0  2 arctan.=s0/ and 'b D
'0 C 2 arctan.=s0/. The total deﬂection is then 'b  'a which, in each curve of
Fig. 3.4, is the angle between the two asymptotic directions. Now one combines the
deﬁnition of angle 	 given in Sect. 3.6 with the equality u D v taken from the last
of (3.15); with the aid of Fig. 3.5 one ﬁnds

The deﬁnitions (3.32, 3.33) show that (3.36) eventually provides the relation

conditions only were considered, here the analysis has been brought to the end by
considering a speciﬁc type of interaction.
When  ranges from 1 to C1 at a ﬁxed EB, the deﬁnitions (3.32, 3.33) make
the ratio =s0 D =sA to range from 1 to C1. If =s0 D 1 (1), then 	 D 0 (2),

Applications of the Concepts of Analytical Mechanics
The relations obtained so far are readily recast in matrix form. First, one deﬁnes the
mass matrix M as the real, 3N  3N diagonal matrix whose entries are ŒMkn D
n ıkn > 0, with ıkn the Kronecker symbol (A.18). By construction, the mass matrix
is symmetric and positive deﬁnite; the entries of its inverse are ŒM1kn D ıkn=n.
Then, one deﬁnes the elastic matrix C as the real, 3N  3N matrix whose entries
are ŒCkn D ckn. The entries of the elastic matrix are the second derivatives of
the potential energy Va; as the order of the derivation is irrelevant, the matrix is
symmetric. Also, the derivatives are calculated in a minimum of Va; from the ﬁrst
of (3.39) it follows that the quadratic form at the right-hand side equals Va  Va0
which, by construction, is positive. It follows that the elastic matrix is positive
deﬁnite, namely, for any choice of the displacements (excluding the case where
all displacements are zero) the quadratic form generated by the matrix is positive.
Finally, let h be the column vector of entries h1; h2; : : :, and hT its transpose.
Combining (3.37, 3.39, 3.41) expresses the Hamiltonian function in terms of the
sum of two quadratic forms,

3.10
Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian Function
Thanks to the properties of the matrices M and C, the right-hand side of (3.42) can
be set in diagonal form. To this purpose one considers the eigenvalue equation
C g D  M g ;
 D 1; : : : ; 3N ;
(3.43)
where the eigenvalues  are real because C and M are real and symmetric. As all
coefﬁcients of (3.43) are real, the eigenvectors g are real as well. Also, due to the
positive deﬁniteness of C and M, the eigenvalues are positive and the eigenvectors
are linearly independent. They can also be selected in order to fulﬁll the property of
being orthonormal with respect to M, namely, gT
 M g D ı.
Each of the 3N eigenvectors g has 3N entries. Thus, the set of eigenvectors
can be arranged to form a 3N  3N real matrix G, whose th column is the th
eigenvector. The inverse matrix G1 exists because, by construction, the columns of
G are linearly independent. The orthonormality relation between the eigenvectors
can now be expressed in matrix form as2
GT M G D I ;
(3.44)
2The procedure illustrated here is an application to the case of real matrices of the unitary
transformation illustrated in Sect. A.11.2.

3.10
Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian Function

with I the identity matrix. Equation (3.44) is the basic ingredient for the diagonal-
ization of (3.42). From it one preliminarily derives four more relations,
GT M D G1 ;
G GT M D I ;
M G D

GT	1 ;
M G GT D I :
(3.45)
The ﬁrst of (3.45) is obtained by right multiplying (3.44) by G1 and using
G G1 D I. Left multiplying by G the ﬁrst of (3.45) yields the second one. The third
of (3.45) is obtained by left multiplying (3.44) by .GT/1. Finally, right multiplying
by GT the third of (3.45) yields the fourth one. To complete the transformation of
the equations into a matrix form one deﬁnes the eigenvalue matrix L as the real,
3N  3N diagonal matrix whose entries are ŒL D  ı > 0. The set of 3N
eigenvalue equations (3.43) then takes one of the two equivalent forms
C G D M G L ;
GT C G D L :
(3.46)
The ﬁrst of (3.46) is the analogue of (3.43), while the second form is obtained
from the ﬁrst one by left multiplying by GT and using (3.44). The diagonalization
of (3.42) is now accomplished by inserting the second and fourth of (3.45) into the
potential-energy term of (3.42) to obtain
hT C h D hT .M G GT/ C .G GT M/ h D .hT M G/ .GT C G/ .GT M h/ ;
(3.47)
where the associative law has been used. At the right-hand side of (3.47), the term in
the central parenthesis is replaced with L due to the second of (3.46). The term in the
last parenthesis is a column vector for which the short-hand notation b D GT M h
is introduced. Note that b depends on time because h does. The ﬁrst of (3.45) shows
that h D G b, whence hT D bT GT. Finally, using (3.44), transforms the term in the
ﬁrst parenthesis at the right-hand side of (3.47) into hT M G D bT GT M G D bT.
In conclusion, the potential-energy term of (3.42) is recast in terms of b as hT C h D
bT L b, which is the diagonal form sought. By a similar procedure one ﬁnds for the
kinetic-energy term Ph
T M Ph D Pb
T GT M G Pb D Pb
T Pb.
The terms Pb
T Pb and bT L b have the same units. As a consequence, the units of
L are the inverse of a time squared. Remembering that the entries of L are positive,
one introduces the new symbol !2
 D  for the eigenvalues, ! > 0. In conclusion,
the diagonal form of (3.42) reads

Apart from the constant Va0, the Hamiltonian function Ha is given by a sum of
terms, each associated with a single degree of freedom. A comparison with (3.1)
shows that the individual summands H are identical to the Hamiltonian function
of a linear harmonic oscillator with m D 1. As a consequence, the two canonical

(3.49)
The constants ˇ, ' depend on the initial conditions b.0/, Pb.0/. The complex
coefﬁcients are related to the above constants by Qˇ D ˇ exp.i'/. In turn, the
initial conditions are derived from those of the displacements, b.0/ D G1 h.0/,
Pb.0/ D G1 Ph.0/.
The 3N functions b.t/ are called normal coordinates or principal coordinates.
Once the normal coordinates have been found, the displacements of the particles
are determined from h D G b. It follows that such displacements are superpositions
of oscillatory functions. Despite the complicacy of the system, the approximation
of truncating the potential energy to the second order makes the Hamiltonian
function completely separable in the normal coordinates. The problem then becomes
a generalization of that of the linear harmonic oscillator (Sect. 3.3), and the
frequencies of the oscillators are determined by combining the system parameters,
speciﬁcally, the particle masses and elastic constants. The Hamiltonian function
associated with each degree of freedom is a constant of motion, H D E, whose
value is prescribed by the initial conditions. The total energy of the system is also a
constant and is given by

Periodic Potential Energy
An interesting application of the action-angle variables introduced in Sect. 2.10 is
found in the case of a conservative motion where the potential energy V is periodic.
For simplicity a linear motion is considered (Sect. 2.9), whence V.x C a/ D V.x/,
with a > 0 the spatial period. Letting E be the total energy and m the mass
of the particle, an unlimited motion is assumed, namely, E > V; it follows that
the momentum p D
p
2 m ŒE  V.x/ is a spatially periodic function of period a
whence, according to the deﬁnition of Sect. 2.10, the motion is a rotation. For any
position g, the time  necessary for the particle to move from g to g C a is found
from (2.47), where the positive sign is provisionally chosen:

The integral in (3.51) is independent of g due to the periodicity of V. As a
consequence, for any g the position of the particle grows by a during the time .
The action variable is found from (2.49):

In turn, the derivative of the angle variable is found from (2.51). It reads Pw D
@H=@J D 1=.dJ=dE/ D const, with H the Hamiltonian function. The second
form of Pw holds because H does not depend on w, and H D E. Using (3.52) and
comparing with (3.51) one ﬁnds

Œ2 m .E  V.x//1=2 dx D  :
(3.53)
As expected, 1= is the rotation frequency. In conclusion, the time evolution of
the action-angle variables is given by w D t= C w0, J D const. Note that the
relation (3.52) between E and J holds when the positive sign is chosen in (2.47); if
the above calculations are repeated after choosing the negative sign, one ﬁnds that
J is associated with the same E. As a consequence, E is an even function of J.
Another observation is that the action-angle variables can be scaled by letting,
e.g., w J D .a w/ .J=a/. In this way the property that the product of two canonically
conjugate variables is dimensionally an action is still fulﬁlled. A comparison
with (3.52) shows that, thanks to this choice of the scaling factor, P D J=a is
the average momentum over a period, while X D a w is a length. The Hamilton
equations and the time evolution of the new variables are then
PX D @H
@P ;
PP D @H
@X D 0 ;
X D a
 t C X0 ;
P D P0 D const ;
(3.54)
where a= is the average velocity of the particle over the spatial period, and X0 D
X.0/, P0 D P.0/. In conclusion, in the new canonical variables no force is acting
(PP D 0), and the motion of the new position X is uniform in time. However, the
relation between E and P D J=a, given by (3.52), is not quadratic as it would be in
free space.3
In many cases it is of interest to investigate the particle’s dynamics when a
perturbation ıH is superimposed to the periodic potential energy V. It is assumed
that ıH depends on x only, and that E is the same as in the unperturbed case (the
latter assumption is not essential). The Hamiltonian function of the perturbed case

The relations (3.58, 3.62) are worth discussing. If one considers g as a position
coordinate and QP as the momentum conjugate to it, (3.58, 3.62) become a pair
of Hamilton equations where some derivatives are replaced with difference quo-
tients. Speciﬁcally, (3.62) shows that the average momentum varies so that its
“coarse-grained” variation with respect to time, QP=Q, is the negative coarse-
grained variation of the Hamiltonian function with respect to space, H=g D
ıH=g. In turn, (3.58) shows that the coarse-grained variation of position with
respect to time, g=Q, is the derivative of the Hamiltonian function with respect
to the average momentum. In conclusion, (3.58, 3.62) are useful when one is not
interested in the details of the particle’s motion within each spatial period, but wants
to investigate on a larger scale how the perturbation inﬂuences the average properties
of the motion.
3.12
Energy-Momentum Relation in a Periodic Potential
Energy
It has been observed, with reference to the non-perturbed case, that the rela-
tion (3.52) between the total energy and the average momentum is not quadratic.
In the perturbed case, as shown by (3.56), the momentum depends on both the total
energy and the coarse-grained position. To investigate this case it is then necessary
to ﬁx g and consider the dependence of QP on E only. To proceed one takes a small
interval of QP around a given value, say QPs, corresponding to a total energy Es, and
approximates the E.QP/ relation with a second-order Taylor expansion around QP,

Although in general the QP.E/ relation (3.56) cannot be inverted analytically, one
can calculate the derivatives that appear in (3.63). The latter are worked out in the
unperturbed case ıH D 0 for simplicity. Using (3.53), the ﬁrst derivative is found

In conclusion, in a small interval of QP or Qp the relation between energy and average
momentum of a particle of mass m subjected to a periodic potential has the same
form as that of a free particle of mass m=rs. In other terms, the ratio m=rs acts as an
effective mass within the frame of the coarse-grained dynamics.
A bound for rs is obtained from Hölder’s inequality (C.119). Letting jFj D K,
G D 1, b D 3, x1 D g=a, x2 D g=a C 1 in (C.119) and using the deﬁnition (3.66)
yield rs  1, whence m=rs  m: the effective mass can never exceed the true mass.
The equality between the two masses is found in the limiting case E  VM  VM 
V ıH, with VM the maximum of V. In fact, (3.66) yields r ' 1 and, from (3.56), it
is QP '

Comments on the Linear Harmonic Oscillator
The paramount importance of the example of the linear harmonic oscillator, shown
in Sect. 3.1, is due to the fact that in several physical systems the position of a
particle at any instant happens to depart little from a point where the potential energy
V has a minimum. As a consequence, the potential energy can be approximated
with a second-order expansion around the minimum, that yields a positive-deﬁnite

quadratic form for the potential energy and a linear form for the force. The theory
depicted in this section is then applicable to many physical systems, as shown by
the examples of Sects. 3.9 and 5.6. The approximation of the potential energy with a
second-order expansion, like that discussed in Sects. 3.9, 3.10, is called harmonic
approximation. The terms beyond the second order in the expansion are called
anharmonic.
3.13.2
Degrees of Freedom and Coordinate Separation
With reference to the analysis of the central motion carried out in Sect. 3.4, it is
worth noting that the constancy of M reduces the number of degrees of freedom of
the problem from three to two. Also, the form (3.6) of the Hamiltonian function is
such as to provide a relation containing only r and the corresponding momentum
pr. Thus the coordinate r is separable according to the deﬁnition of Sect. 2.4. This
allows one to independently ﬁnd the time evolution (3.7) of r by solving an ordinary
differential equation of the ﬁrst order. Then one ﬁnds (3.8), that is, the trajectory
'.r/, through another equation of the same type. Finally, combining (3.7) with (3.8)
yields the time evolution of the remaining coordinate '.
It has been noted in Sect. 3.13.2 that, thanks to the constancy of the angular
momentum, the adoption of spherical coordinates allows one to separate the radial
coordinate r. This simpliﬁes the problem, whose solution is in fact reduced to the
successive solution of the evolution equations for r and '. The same problem,
instead, is not separable in the Cartesian coordinates. In other terms, separability
may hold in some coordinate reference, but does not hold in general in an arbitrarily
chosen reference.
Another example of separability is that illustrated in Sects. 3.9, 3.10. In general
the Hamiltonian function is not separable in the Cartesian coordinates, whereas it
is completely separable in the normal coordinates, no matter how large the number
of the degrees of freedom is. Moreover, after the separation has been accomplished,
one ﬁnds that all the equations related to the single degrees of freedom (the second
relation in (3.48)) have the same form. In fact, they differ only in the numerical value
of the angular frequency !. As a consequence, the expression of the solution is the
same for all. Also, as the energy H of each degree of freedom is independently
conserved, no exchange of energy among the normal coordinates occurs: therefore,
the distribution of energy among the normal coordinates that is present at t D 0 is
maintained forever. This result is bafﬂing because, for instance, it seems to prevent
the condition of thermal equilibrium from being established; actually it is due to
the fact that the system under investigation is isolated: if it were put in contact with
a thermal reservoir, the exchanges of energy occurring with the reservoir would
eventually bring the energy distribution of the system to the condition of thermal
equilibrium.
Still with reference to the system discussed in Sects. 3.9, 3.10, it is important
to underline the formal analogy between the modes of a mechanical, vibrating

system and those of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuo described in Sect. 5.6. In
both cases the energy of each mode is that of a linear harmonic oscillator of unit
mass (Eq. (3.48) and, respectively, (5.40)).
3.13.3
Comments on the Normal Coordinates
It has been shown in Sect. 3.9 that the elastic matrix C is positive deﬁnite. One may
argue that in some cases the matrix is positive semi-deﬁnite. Consider, for instance,
the case where the potential energy depends on the relative distance of the particles,
Va D Va.R1  R2; R1  R3; : : :/. For any set of positions R1; R2; : : :, a uniform
displacement Rı of all particles, that transforms each Rj into Rj C Rı, leaves Va
unchanged. As a consequence, if the positions prior to the displacement correspond
to the equilibrium point R01; R02; : : :, it is Va.R01 C Rı; : : :/ D Va.R01; : : :/ D
Va0. In such a case all terms beyond the zero-order term in the Taylor expansion
of Va around the equilibrium point vanish, which implies that the elastic matrix C
is positive semi-deﬁnite. In the case examined in Sect. 3.9 the eigenvalues are real
and positive; here, instead, they are real and nonnegative. Remembering (3.48), one
ﬁnds that the Hamiltonian function of the degree of freedom corresponding to the
null eigenvalue reads H D Pb2
=2, whence Rb D 0, b D b.0/ C a t, with a a
constant.
The problem tackled in Sect. 3.10 is that of diagonalizing the right-hand side
of (3.42). The diagonalization of a quadratic form entails a linear transformation
over the original vector (h in this case) using a matrix formed by eigenvectors. One
may observe that in (3.42), the kinetic energy Ph
T M Ph=2 is already diagonal in the
original vector, while the potential energy hT C h=2 is not. If the diagonalization was
carried out using the matrix formed by the eigenvalues of C alone, the outcome of
the process would be that of making the potential energy diagonal while making the
kinetic energy non-diagonal (both in the transformed vector). The problem is solved
by using the eigenvalue equation (3.43) that involves both matrices M and C in the
diagonalization process. In fact, as shown in Sect. 3.10, in the transformed vector b
the potential energy becomes diagonal, and the kinetic energy remains diagonal.
One may observe that, given the solutions of the eigenvalue equation (3.43), the
process of diagonalizing (3.42) is straightforward. The real difﬁculty lies in solv-
ing (3.43). When the number of degrees of freedom is large, the solution of (3.43)
must be tackled by numerical methods and may become quite cumbersome. In
practical applications the elastic matrix C exhibits some structural properties, like
symmetry or periodicity (e.g., Sect. 17.7.1), that are exploited to ease the problem
of solving (3.43).

Areal Velocity in the Central-Motion Problem
Consider the central-motion problem discussed in Sect. 3.4. In the elementary time-
interval dt the position vector changes from r to r C dr. The area dA of the triangle
whose sides are r, r C dr, and dr is half the area of the parallelogram Q1Q2Q3Q4
whose consecutive sides are, e.g., r and dr (Fig. 3.6). Thus,

with M the angular momentum. The derivative dA=dt is called areal velocity. The
derivation of (3.69) is based purely on deﬁnitions, hence it holds in general. For a
central motion the angular momentum M is constant, whence the areal velocity is
constant as well: the area swept out by the position vector r in a given time interval
is proportional to the interval itself (Kepler’s second law). If the particle’s trajectory

Initial Conditions in the Central-Motion Problem
The theory of the central motion for a two-particle system has been worked out in
Sects. 3.7, 3.8 without specifying the initial conditions. To complete the analysis it
is convenient to use the same prescription as in Sect. 3.6, namely, to select an O
reference where the particle of mass m2 is initially at rest (v2a D 0). Moreover,
here reference O is chosen in such a way as to make the initial position of the
particle of mass m2 to coincide with the origin (r2a D 0), and the initial velocity

The distance c between the x axis and the direction of v1a (Fig. 3.7) is called impact

reference O as described above. In fact, for a given form of the potential energy V,
the angle 	 deﬁned in Sect. 3.6 becomes a function of two easily speciﬁed quantities:
kinetic energy (E D m1 v2

1a=2) and impact parameter c (compare,

property of reference O is that  turns out to be the angle between the x axis and the

Dynamic Relations of Special Relativity
The dynamic relations considered in this book refer almost invariably to situations
where the particle velocity is small with respect to that of light. For this reason it is
sufﬁcient to use the nonrelativistic relations. The only exception where the velocities
of the particles involved do not allow for such an approximation is considered in
Sects. 3.13.8 and 7.4.3. For this reason a set of relations of the Special-Relativity
Theory are given here, that apply to the case of a free particle. The ﬁrst of them is
the relation between velocity u and momentum p,
p D
m0 u
p
1  u2=c2 ;
u D juj ;
(3.82)
with c the velocity of light and m0 a constant mass. The second relation involves
energy and velocity and reads
E D m c2 ;
m D
m0
p
1  u2=c2 :
(3.83)
where E is a kinetic energy because a free particle is considered. In the above,
m D m.u/ is called relativistic mass and m0 D m.0/ is called rest mass. The latter
is the mass measured in a reference where the particle is at rest, and is the value of
the mass that is used in nonrelativistic mechanics. From (3.82, 3.83) it follows
p D m u ;
m2 c2  m2 u2 D m2

m2 c2 D E2=c2 ;

Applications of the Concepts of Analytical Mechanics
In general the p D p.E/ relation is nonlinear. However, for particles with m0 D 0
the expressions (3.85) simplify to the linear relation p D E=c. An example of this is
found in the theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, where the same momentum-energy
relation is derived from the Maxwell equations (Sect. 5.7). It is worth observing that
if a particle has m0 D 0 and p ¤ 0, its velocity is necessarily equal to c; in fact,
the ﬁrst of (3.84) yields limm0!0 p D 0 when u < c. Another limiting case is found
when u=c  1. In fact, the second of (3.83) simpliﬁes to

Collision of Relativistic Particles
This section illustrates the collision between two relativistic particles that constitute
an isolated system. The same approach of Sect. 3.5 is used here, namely, the asymp-
totic values only are considered. Also, the case where the particles’ trajectories
belong to the same plane, speciﬁcally, the x; y plane, is investigated. The initial
conditions are the same as in Sect. 3.6: the asymptotic motion of the ﬁrst particle
before the collision is parallel to the x axis, while the second particle is initially
at rest. Finally, it is assumed that the rest mass of the ﬁrst particle is zero, so that
the momentum-energy relation of this particle is p D E=c as shown in Sect. 3.13.7,
while the rest mass of the second particle is m0 ¤ 0.
The collision is treated by combining the conservation laws of energy and
momentum of the two-particle system. Let Ea, Eb be the asymptotic energies of the
ﬁrst particle before and after the collision, respectively. As for the second particle,
which is initially at rest, the energy before the collision is its rest energy m0 c2, while
that after the collision is m c2 (Sect. 3.13.7). The conservation of energy then reads
Ea C m0 c2 D Eb C m c2 ;
(3.88)
while the conservation of momentum reads, respectively for the x and y components,

that provides the asymptotic energy after the collision of the ﬁrst particle, as a
function of the asymptotic energy before the collision, the deﬂection angle of the
same particle, and the rest energy of the second particle. Equation (3.92) is used in
Sect. 7.4.3 for the explanation of the Compton effect.
The nonrelativistic analogue of the above procedure is illustrated in Sect. 3.6. It is
interesting to note that the calculation carried out here seems rather less involved
than the nonrelativistic one. This surprising fact is actually due to the special choice
of the ﬁrst particle, whose rest energy is zero. In this case, in fact, the relation
between momentum and energy becomes linear. That of the second particle, which
is nonlinear, is eliminated from the equations. On the contrary, in the nonrelativistic
case treated in Sect. 3.6 the energy-momentum relations are nonlinear for both
particles, thus making the calculation more laborious.
3.13.9
Energy Conservation in Charged-Particles’ Interaction
The two-particle interaction considered in Sect. 3.8 involves charged particles.
As the particles’ velocity during the interaction is not constant, the particles radiate
(Sect. 5.11.2) and, consequently, lose energy. This phenomenon is not considered in
the analysis carried out in Sect. 3.8, where the total energy of the two-particle system
is assumed constant. The assumption is justiﬁed on the basis that the radiated power
is relatively small. This subject is further discussed in Sect. 5.11.3.

Electromagnetism
4.1
Introduction
This chapter outlines the basic principles of the electromagnetic theory in vacuo.
First, the extension of the Lagrangian formalism to functions that depend on more
than one variable is tackled: this yields useful tools for the analysis of continuous
media. Next, the Maxwell equations are introduced along with the derivation of
the electric and magnetic potentials, and the concept of gauge transformation is
illustrated. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the Helmholtz and wave
equations, both in a ﬁnite and inﬁnite domain. The chapter ﬁnally introduces the
Lorentz force that connects the electromagnetic ﬁeld with the particles’ dynamics.
The complements discuss some invariance properties of the Euler equations, derive
the wave equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld, and clarify some issues
related to the boundary conditions in the application of the Green method to the
boundary-value problem.
4.2
Extension of the Lagrangian Formalism
In Sect. 1.2 the derivation of the extremum functions has been carried out with
reference to a functional GŒw of the form (1.1). Such a functional contains one
unknown function w that, in turn, depends on one independent variable . The result
has been extended to the case where the functional depends on several unknown
functions w1, w2 ; : : :, each dependent on one variable only (compare with (1.6)).
The extension to more than one independent variable is shown here.
To proceed it sufﬁces to consider a single unknown function w that depends on
two independent variables ,  and is differentiable at least twice with respect to
each. The ﬁrst and second derivatives of w are indicated with w, w, w, w,
and w. Letting  be the domain over which w is deﬁned, and g the generating
function, the functional reads

an extremum function of G, the extremum condition if found by replacing w with
w C ˛  and letting .dG=d˛/0 D 0, where sufﬁx 0 indicates that the derivative

The second and third terms of the integrand in (4.2) are recast in compact form by
deﬁning vector u D .@g=@w ; @g=@w/ and using the second identity in (A.16), so
that the sum of the two terms reads u  grad  D div.u/   div u. Integrating over

equal to zero because  vanishes over †.
It is important to clarify the symbols that will be used to denote the derivatives.
In fact, to calculate div u one needs, ﬁrst, to differentiate @g=@w with respect
to  considering also the implicit -dependence within w, w, and w; then, one
differentiates in a similar manner @g=@w with respect to . The two derivatives are
summed up to form div u. For this type of differentiation the symbols d=d and d=d
are used, even if the functions in hand depend on two independent variables instead
of one. The symbols @=@ and @=@ are instead reserved to the derivatives with
respect to the explicit dependence on  or  only. With this provision, inserting (4.3)

of generalized coordinates; in turn, the scalar parameter  of (1.7) becomes the

Lagrangian Function for the Wave Equation
It has been shown in Sect. 1.3 that the relations Rwi D Rwi.w; Pw; /, i D 1; : : : ; n,
describing the motion of a system of particles with n degrees of freedom, are the
Euler equations of a suitable functional. Then, the analysis of Sect. 4.2 has shown
that when the unknown functions w1; : : : ; wl depend on more than one variable,
the Euler equations are the second-order partial-differential equations (4.8). The
form (4.8) is typical of the problems involving continuous media (e.g., elasticity
ﬁeld, electromagnetic ﬁeld). Following the same reasoning as in Sect. 1.3 it is pos-
sible to construct the Lagrangian function whence the partial-differential equation
derives. This is done here with reference to the important case of the wave equation1

(4.13)
where u D const is a velocity and, for the sake of simplicity, s is assumed to
depend on x and t, but not on w or its derivatives. It is worth noting that when
a differential equation other than Newton’s law is considered, the corresponding
Lagrangian function is not necessarily an energy. For this reason it will provisionally
be indicated with Le instead of L. To proceed one considers the one-dimensional
form of (4.13), @2w=@x2  .1=u2/ @2w=@t2 D s and replaces , , g with x, t, Le,
respectively. Then, one makes the one-dimensional form identical to (4.5) by letting

of w. Replacing Le D s w C c into the ﬁrst two equations in (4.14) and integrating
the ﬁrst one with respect to wx yield @c=@wx D wx C a01, with a01 independent of
wx. Similarly, from the second equation in (4.14), @c=@wt D wt=u2 Ca02, with a02
independent of wt. Also, remembering that c is independent of w, one ﬁnds that a01
and a02 do not depend on w either. Considering that all the second derivatives of Le
not appearing in (4.14) are equal to zero shows that a01 depends on t at most, while
a02 depends on x at most. Integrating @c=@wx D wxCa01 and @c=@wt D wt=u2Ca02

(4.15)
where a11 does not depend on w or wx, while a12 does not depend on w or wt. Also,
a11 cannot depend on both t and wt due to @2Le=.@t @wt/ D 0; similarly, a12 cannot
depend on both x and wx due to @2Le=.@x @wx/ D 0. On the other hand, as both (4.15)
hold, a11 must coincide (apart from an additive constant) with the ﬁrst two terms at
the right-hand side of the second equation in (4.15), and a12 must coincide with the
ﬁrst two terms at the right-hand side of the ﬁrst equation. In conclusion,

in Sect. 4.2 such a vector is arbitrary, so it can be eliminated by letting a01 D 0,

Maxwell Equations
The Maxwell equations, that describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld, lend themselves
to an interesting application of the results of Sect. 4.3. The ﬁrst group of Maxwell
equations reads
div D D % ;
rot H  @D
@t D J ;
(4.19)
where D is the electric displacement and H the magnetic ﬁeld.2 The sources of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld are the charge density % and the current density J. When
point-like charges are considered, they read
%c D

Jc D

(4.20)
where index c is used to distinguish the case of point-like charges from that of a
continuous charge distribution. In (4.20), ej is the value of the jth charge, sj and
uj its position and velocity at time t, respectively, and r the independent positional
variable. If the spatial scale of the problem is such that one can replace the point-
like charges with a continuous distribution, one applies the same procedure as in
Sect. 23.2. The number of charges belonging to a cell of volume V centered at r is
R
V %c d3s0 D P0
j ej, where the prime indicates that the sum is limited to the charges
that belong to  at time t. Then one deﬁnes %.r; t/ D P0

F.r; t/ the ﬂux density (compare with the deﬁnitions of Sect. 23.2). If the charges are
different from each other it is convenient to distribute the sum P

made of equal charges. In this case the charge density and current density read
% D %1 C %2 C : : : ;
J D %1 v1 C %2 v2 C : : : ;
(4.22)

“Wb,” and “T” stand for Coulomb, Ampère, Volt, Weber, and Tesla, respectively. The coefﬁcients
in (4.19, 4.23, 4.24) differ from those of
[10] because of the different units adopted there.
In turn, the units in (4.25) are Œ"0 D C V1 m1 D F m1, Œ0 D s2 F1 m1 D H m1,
where “F” and “H” stand for Farad and Henry, respectively, and those in (4.26) are Œ' D V,

Apart from the different units of the functions involved, the form of (4.23) is the

div B D 0 ;
rot E C @B

(4.24)
where B and E are the magnetic induction and the electric ﬁeld, respectively. Here
the Maxwell equations are considered in vacuo, so that the following hold

of light in vacuo.
4.5
Potentials and Gauge Transformations
Thanks to (4.25), the electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuo is determined by two suitably
chosen vectors—typically, E and B—out of the four ones appearing in (4.25). This
amounts to using six scalar functions of position and time. However, the number of
scalar functions is reduced by observing that while (4.19) provides relations between
the electromagnetic ﬁeld and its sources, (4.24) provides relations among the ﬁeld
vectors themselves; as a consequence, (4.24) reduces the number of independent
vectors. In fact, using the properties illustrated in Sect. A.9, one ﬁnds that from
div B D 0 one derives B D rot A, where A is called vector potential or magnetic
potential. In turn, the vector potential transforms the second of (4.24) into rot.E C
@A=@t/ D 0; using again the results of Sect. A.9 shows that the term in parentheses
is the gradient of a scalar function, that is customarily indicated with '. Such a
function3 is called scalar potential or electric potential. In summary,
3The minus sign in the deﬁnition of ' is used for consistency with the deﬁnition of the gravitational
potential, where the force is opposite to the direction along which the potential grows.

In conclusion, (4.29) and the ﬁrst equation in (4.28) are a set of four scalar
differential equations whose unknowns are ' and the components of A. Such
equations are coupled because  contains all unknowns; however, they become
decoupled after suitable transformations, shown below.
To proceed, one observes that only the derivatives of the potentials, not the
potential themselves, appear in (4.26); as a consequence, while the ﬁelds E, B are
uniquely deﬁned by the potentials, the opposite is not true. For instance, replacing
A with A0 D A C grad f, where f.r; t/ is any differentiable scalar function, and
using the second identity in (A.35), yields B0 D rot A0 D B, namely, B is invariant
with respect to such a replacement. If, at the same time, one replaces ' with a
yet undetermined function '0, (4.26) yields E0 D  grad.'0 C @f=@t/  @A=@t.
It follows that by choosing '0 D '  @f=@t one obtains E0 D E. The transformation
.' ; A/ ! .'0 ; A0/ deﬁned by
'0 D '  @f
@t ;
A0 D A C grad f :
(4.30)
is called gauge transformation. As shown above, E and B are invariant with respect
to such a transformation. One also ﬁnds that (4.29) and the ﬁrst equation in (4.28)
are invariant with respect to the transformation: all terms involving f cancel each
other, so that the equations in the primed unknowns are identical to the original
ones. However, the solutions '0, A0 are different from ', A because, due to (4.30),
their initial and boundary conditions are not necessarily the same. The difference

4.6

between the primed and unprimed solutions is unimportant because the ﬁelds, as
shown above, are invariant under the transformation. Using (4.30) in the second

from the Coulomb gauge are indeed decoupled. Another possibility is choosing f

expressions (4.26) of the ﬁelds in terms of the potentials. It follows that the functions

respectively, @'=@xk, @Ai=@xk, @Ai=@t, with i; k D 1; 2; 3, k ¤ i. The Lagrangian

The relation (4.46) would not be applicable if r were internal to V, because G
diverges for g ! 0 and, as a consequence, is not differentiable in q D r. On the
other hand, in many applications r happens to be internal to V. In such cases one
must exclude from the integral a suitable portion of volume V; this is achieved
by considering a spherical domain of radius  centered on r and internal to V
(Fig. 4.1). Letting V, S be, respectively, the volume and surface of such a sphere,
and considering the new volume V0 D V  V, having S0 D S [ S as boundary,

Letting k D 0 in (4.45), namely, taking G D 1=g, makes the results of this section
applicable to the Poisson equation r2f D b. It must be noted that (4.52) should
be considered as an integral relation for f, not as the solution of the differential
equation whence it derives. In fact, for actually calculating (4.52) it is necessary to
prescribe both f and @f=@n over the boundary. This is an overspeciﬁcation of the
problem: in fact, the theory of boundary-value problems shows that the solution
of an equation of the form (4.43) is found by specifying over the boundary either
the unknown function only (Dirichlet boundary condition), or its normal derivative
only (Neumann boundary condition). To ﬁnd a solution starting from (4.52) it is
necessary to carry out more steps, by which either f or @f=@n is eliminated from the
integral at the right-hand side [69, Sect. 1.8–1.10]. In contrast, when the solution
is sought in a domain whose boundary extends to inﬁnity, and the contribution of
the boundary conditions vanish as shown in Sect. 4.9, the limiting case of (4.52)
provides a solution proper. More comments about this issue are made in Sect. 4.12.3.

Solution of the Wave Equation in an Inﬁnite Domain
The solutions of the Helmholtz equation found in Sects. 4.8, 4.9 allow one to
calculate that of the wave equation. In fact, it is worth reminding that the Helmholtz
equation (4.43) was deduced in Sect. 4.7 by Fourier transforming the wave equa-
tions (4.35) and i) letting f indicates the transform of the scalar potential ' or of
any component Ai of the vector potential, ii) letting b indicates the transform of
%="0 or 0 Ji, i D 1; 2; 3. As a consequence, f and b depend on the angular
frequency ! besides the spatial coordinates. From the deﬁnition k2 D !2=c2 one
may also assume that both k and ! have the same sign, so that k D !=c. Considering
for simplicity the case V ! 1, applying (C.17) to antitransform (4.56), and
interchanging the order of integrals yields

4.11
Lorentz Force
It has been assumed so far that the sources of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, namely
charge density and current density, are prescribed functions of position and time.
This is not necessarily so, because the charges are in turn acted upon by the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, so that their dynamics is inﬂuenced by it. Consider a test
charge of value e immersed in an electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the vectors E,
B generated by other charges. The force acting upon the test charge is the Lorentz
force [10, Vol. I, Sect. 44]
F D e .E C u ^ B/ ;
(4.60)
where u is the velocity of the test charge and E, B are independent of u. The
expression of the Lorentz force does not derive from assumptions separate from
Maxwell’s equations; in fact, it follows from Maxwell’s equations and Special
5Expressions of ' and A obtained from (4.58,4.59) after replacing t  jr  qj=c with t C jr  qj=c
are also solutions of the wave equations (4.35). This is due to the fact that the Helmholtz
equation (4.43) can also be solved by using G instead of G, which in turn reﬂects the time
reversibility of the wave equation. However, the form with t  jr  qj=c better represents the
idea that an electromagnetic perturbation, that is present in r at the time t, is produced by a source
acting in q at a time prior to t.

Comments on the Boundary-Value Problem
Considering relation (4.52) derived in Sect. 4.8, one notes that the right-hand side
is made of the difference between two terms; the ﬁrst one depends on the boundary
values of f, @f=@n, but not on b, while the second one depends only on the values of
b within V and over the boundary. In these considerations it does not matter whether
point r is external to V, on the boundary of V, or internal to it. In latter case the two
terms at the right-hand side of (4.52) balance each other.
If b is replaced with a different function Qb, and thereby the value of the second
integral changes, it is possible to modify the boundary values in such a way as
to balance the variation of the second integral with that of the ﬁrst one; as a
consequence, f.r/ is left unchanged. A possible choice for the modiﬁed b is Qb D 0;
by this choice one eliminates the data of the differential equation and suitably
modiﬁes the boundary values, leaving the solution unaffected. An observer placed
at r would be unable to detect that the data have disappeared. The same process
can also be carried out in reverse, namely, by eliminating the boundary values and
suitably changing the data.
An example is given in Prob. 4.4 with reference to a one-dimensional Poisson
equation where the original charge density differs from zero in a ﬁnite interval Œa; b.
The charge density is removed and the boundary values at a are modiﬁed so that the
electric potential ' is unaffected for x  b. Obviously ' changes for a < x < b
because both the charge density and boundary conditions are different, and also for
x  a because the boundary conditions are different.

Green Function for the Upper Half Plane
The solution of the Laplace equation in two dimensions is considered in this section,

and Gyy D 2 Œ.x  /2  y2=r4. Adding the last two relations yields r2G D 0: From
the above it follows that also log r D G=2 is harmonic in the upper half plane. On
the contrary, G is not everywhere harmonic along the x axis because G.x; 0/ diverges
as j  xj ! 0.

Chapter 5
Applications of the Concepts
of Electromagnetism
5.1
Introduction
This chapter provides a number of important applications of the concepts of
Electromagnetism. The solution of the wave equation found in Chap. 4 is used to
calculate the potentials generated by a point-like charge; this result is exploited
later to analyze the decay of atoms in the frame of the classical model, due to the
radiated power. Next, the continuity equations for the energy and momentum of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld are found. As an application, the energy and momentum
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are calculated in terms of modes in a ﬁnite domain,
showing that the energy of each mode has the same expression as that of a linear
harmonic oscillator. The analysis is extended also to an inﬁnite domain. The chapter
is concluded by the derivation of the eikonal equation, leading to the approximation
of Geometrical Optics, followed by the demonstration that the eikonal equation is
generated by a variational principle, namely, the Fermat principle. The complements
show the derivation of the ﬁelds generated by a point-like charge and the power
radiated by it. It is found that the planetary model of the atom is inconsistent
with electromagnetism because it contradicts the atom’s stability. Finally, a number
of analogies are outlined and commented between Mechanics and Geometrical
Optics, based on the comparison between the Maupertuis and Fermat principles.
The reasoning deriving from the comparison hints at the possibility that mechanical
laws more general than Newton’s law exist.

The calculation of ' and A based upon (4.58, 4.59) has the inconvenience that as q
varies over the space, it is necessary to consider the sources % and J at different time
instants. This may be avoided by recasting a in the form

As wCwem is an energy density, S (called Poynting vector) is an energy-ﬂux density
(ŒS D J m2 s1). To give wem and S a physical meaning one notes that (5.11) has
the form of a continuity equation (compare, e.g., with (23.3) and (4.23)) where two
interacting systems are involved, namely, the charges and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

where † is the boundary of V, n is the unit vector normal to d† oriented in the

vanish at inﬁnity; it follows that for an inﬁnite domain the sum WCWem is conserved
in time, so that dWem=dt D dW=dt. Observing that W is the kinetic energy of the
charge, and that the latter exchanges energy with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, gives

Wem the meaning of energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld; as a consequence, wem is
the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and the sum W CWem is the constant
energy of the two interacting systems.
When V is ﬁnite, the surface integral in (5.12) may be different from zero, hence
the sum W C Wem is not necessarily conserved. This allows one to give the surface
integral the meaning of energy per unit time that crosses the boundary †, carried
by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this reasoning it is implied that when V is ﬁnite, it
is chosen in such a way that no charge is on the boundary at time t. Otherwise the
kinetic energy of the charges crossing † during dt should also be accounted for.
5.4
Momentum Continuity
The procedure used in Sect. 5.3 to derive the continuity equation for the charge
energy can be replicated to obtain the continuity equation for the charge momentum
per unit volume, m. Remembering (4.61) one ﬁnds the relation f D Pm D P0
j Ppj=V,
with pj the momentum of the jth charge contained within V. Using (4.19) along

S=c2 takes the meaning of momentum per unit volume of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
When V is ﬁnite, the surface integral in (5.17) may be different from zero, hence
the sum (5.18) is not necessarily conserved. This allows one to give the surface
integral in (5.17) the meaning of momentum per unit time that crosses the boundary
†, carried by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this reasoning it is implied that when
V is ﬁnite, it is chosen in such a way that no charge is on the boundary at time

accounted for.
5.5
Modes of the Electromagnetic Field
The expressions of the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, worked
out in Sect. 5.3 and 5.4, take a particularly interesting form when a spatial region free
of charges is considered. In fact, if one lets % D 0, J D 0, Eqs. (4.33) or (4.35) that
provide the potentials become homogeneous. To proceed one takes a ﬁnite region
of volume V; the calculation will be extended in Sect. 5.8 to the case of an inﬁnite
domain. As the shape of V is not essential for the considerations illustrated here, it
is chosen as that of a box whose sides d1, d2, d3 are aligned with the coordinate axes
and start from the origin (Fig. 5.1). The volume of the box is V D d1 d2 d3.
The calculation is based on (4.33) that are the equations for the potentials
deriving from the Coulomb gauge (4.32). Letting % D 0, J D 0 and dropping

In conclusion, ak has no components in the direction of k, namely, it has only two

Thanks to (5.29) one reconstructs the vector potential A in a form that shows
its dependence on space and time explicitly. To this purpose one notes that the
sum (5.21) contains all possible combinations of indices n1, n2, n3, so that a sum-
mand corresponding to k is paired with another summand corresponding to k. One
can then rearrange (5.21) as A D .1=2/ P

The summands of (5.30) corresponding to k and k describe two plane and

two waves together form a mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, whose angular
frequency is ! D c k. The summands corresponding to k D 0 yield the real constant
c0 C c
0 D a0. Finally, the E and B ﬁelds are found by introducing the expansion of
A into (4.26) after letting ' D 0. For this calculation it is convenient to use the form
of the expansion bearing the factor 1=2 introduced above: from the deﬁnition (5.29)
of sk and the ﬁrst identity in (A.35) one ﬁnds

As anticipated, the constant term a0 does not contribute to the ﬁelds. Also, due to the
second relation in (5.29), the vectors sk, s
k, sk, and s
k lie over the plane normal
to k. Due to (5.31, 5.32) the E and B ﬁelds lie on the same plane as well, namely,
they have no component in the propagation direction. For this reason they are called
transversal.

Energy of the Electromagnetic Field in Terms of Modes
The expressions of the E, B ﬁelds within a ﬁnite volume V free of charges have been
calculated in Sect. 5.5 as superpositions of modes, each of them associated with a
wave vector k and an angular frequency ! D c k. Basing upon such expressions
one is able to determine the electromagnetic energy within V in terms of modes.
To this purpose one calculates from (5.31, 5.32) the squares E2 D E  E and B2 D
B  B, inserts the resulting expression into the second relation of (5.10) to obtain
the energy per unit volume, and, ﬁnally, integrates the latter over V (last relation
in (5.12)). Letting Ik be the quantity enclosed within brackets in (5.31), it is E2 D

This result shows that the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within V is the sum of
individual contributions, each associated with a wave vector k through the complex
vector sk. As the latter lies on the plane normal to k, it is expressed in terms
of two scalar components as sk D sk1 e1 C sk2 e2. Such components are related
to the polarization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld over the plane [15, Sect. 1.4.2].
These considerations allow one to count the number of indices that are involved
in the representation (5.37) of Wem: in fact, the set of k vectors is described by
the triple inﬁnity of indices n1, n2, n3 2 Z that appear in (5.22), while the two
scalar components require another index  D 1; 2. The sk vectors describe the
electromagnetic ﬁeld through (5.31) and (5.32), hence one may think of each scalar
component sk as a degree of freedom of the ﬁeld; the counting outlined above
shows that the number of degrees of freedom is 2  Z3. In turn, each degree of
freedom is made of a real and an imaginary part, sk D Rk C i Ik, thus yielding

Applications of the Concepts of Electromagnetism
Comparing (5.41) with (1.42) shows that qk, pk are canonically conjugate
variables and Wk is the Hamiltonian function of the degree of freedom associated
with k. Then, comparing (5.40) with (3.1, 3.2) shows that Wk is indeed the
Hamiltonian function of a linear harmonic oscillator of unit mass.
The energy associated with each degree of freedom is constant in time. In fact,
from the second relation in (5.29) one derives Wk D 2 "0 V !2 ck  c
k. The
same result can be obtained from the properties of the linear harmonic oscilla-
tor (Sect. 3.3). It follows that the total energy Wem is conserved. As shown in
Sect. 5.11.4 this is due to the periodicity of the Poynting vector (5.11): in fact, the
electromagnetic energies the cross per unit time two opposite faces of the boundary
of V are the negative of each other.

where the last two equalities derive from (5.37, 5.38, 5.40). One notes from (5.43)
that the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the sum of individual momenta,
each related to a single degree of freedom. The modulus of the individual momen-
tum is equal to the energy Wk pertaining to the same degree of freedom divided by

Eikonal Equation

(5.49)
while rot E D B=@t yields

The solution of (5.49, 5.50) has the form Ec D Ec0 exp.i kr/, Hc D Hc0 exp.i kr/,
with Ec0 ; Hc0 D const, i.e., a planar wave propagating along the direction of k. In a
nonuniform medium it is " D ".r/,  D .r/, and the form of the solution differs
from the planar wave. The latter can tentatively be generalized as

that is, a partial-differential equation, called eikonal equation, in the unknown S.
The equation has been derived in the hypothesis that ! D 2  is large, hence
 D uf = is small; it is shown below that this condition is also described by stating
that Ec0.r/, Hc0.r/, and S.r/ vary little over a distance of the order of .
The form of (5.51) is such that S.r/ D const deﬁnes the constant-phase surface
(the same concept has been encountered in Sect. 2.5 for the case of a system of
particles). It follows that the normal direction at each point r of the surface is
that of grad S. Let t D dr=ds be the unit vector parallel to grad S in the direction
of increasing S. A ray is deﬁned as the envelope of the t vectors, taken starting
from a point A in a given direction. The description of rays obtained through the
approximation of the eikonal equation is called Geometrical Optics.
The eikonal equation (5.56) can be given a different form by observing that from
the deﬁnition of t it follows grad S D n t and t  grad S D dS=ds D n, whence

This form of the eikonal equation is more often used. It shows that the equation
is of the second order in the unknown function r.s/, where r is the point of the
ray corresponding to the curvilinear abscissa s along the ray itself. The equation’s
coefﬁcient and data are given by the refraction index n. As the equation is of
the second order, two boundary conditions are necessary to completely deﬁne the
solution; for instance, the value of r.s D 0/ corresponding to the initial point
A, and the direction t D dr=ds of the ray at the same point. Remembering
that dt=ds D n=%c, where %c is the curvature radius of the ray at r, and n the
principal normal unit vector, the eikonal equation may also be recast as grad n D
.dn=ds/ t C .n=%c/ n. Using the curvature radius one can specify in a quantitative
manner the approximation upon which the eikonal equation is based; in fact, for
the approximation to hold it is necessary that the electromagnetic wave can be
considered planar, namely, that its amplitude and direction do not signiﬁcantly
change over a distance of the order of . This happens if at each point r along
the ray it is %c  .
5.10
Fermat Principle
It is worth investigating whether the eikonal equation (5.57) worked out in Sect. 5.9
is derivable from a variational principle. In fact it is shown below that the Fermat (or
least time) principle holds, stating that if A and B are two different points belonging
to a ray, the natural ray (that is, the actual path followed by the radiation between
the given points) is the one that minimizes the time
R
AB dt. The principle thus reads

the ﬁelds E, B are determined by applying (4.26) to (5.6, 5.7), which amounts

ﬁeld. Also, E and B are orthogonal to each other, while g is orthogonal to B but not

Decay of Atoms According to the Classical Model
The power radiated by a point-like charge has been determined in Sect. 5.11.2
under the approximations Pu ¤ 0, u=c  1, typical of a bound particle. The
radiated power (5.72) is proportional to the square of the particle’s acceleration: this
result is of a paramount importance, because it shows that the so-called planetary
model of the atom is not stable. Considering for instance the simple case of
hydrogen, the model describes the atom as a planetary system whose nucleus is
ﬁxed in the reference’s origin while the electron orbits around it. If no power was
emitted the motion’s description would be that given, e.g., in Sect. 3.13.6, where the
Hamiltonian function is a constant of motion. In other terms, the total energy would
be conserved. In fact, in the planetary motion the electron’s acceleration, hence the
emitted power, differ from zero; the emission produces an energy loss which was
not considered in the analysis of Sect. 3.13.6. Some comments about this problem
were anticipated in Sect. 3.13.9.
To proceed it is useful to carry out a quantitative estimate of the emitted power.
The outcome of it is that in the case of a bound electron the emission is relatively
weak, so that one can consider it as a perturbation with respect to the conservative
case analyzed in Sect. 3.13.6. The estimate starts from the experimental observation
of the emission of electromagnetic radiation by excited atoms; here the datum that
matters is the minimum angular frequency !0 of the emitted radiation, which is
found to be in the range Œ1015; 1016 rad s1. The simplest model for describing the
unperturbed electron’s motion is that of the linear harmonic oscillator [10, Vol. II,
Sect. 4]
s./ D s0 cos.!0/ ;
(5.73)
with s0 D js0j the maximum elongation with respect to the origin, where the
nucleus is placed. Equation (5.73) may be thought of as describing the projection
over the direction of s0 of the instantaneous position of an electron that follows a
circular orbit. The product e s is called electric dipole moment of the oscillator. Other
experimental results, relative to the measure of the atom’s size, show that s0 is of
the order of 1010 m so that, calculating u D ds=d D s0 !0 sin.!0/ from (5.73)
and letting !0 D 5  1015, one ﬁnds u=c  s0 !0=c ' 2  103. This shows that the
approximations of Sect. 5.11.2 are applicable.
It is worth noting that the type of motion (5.73) is energy conserving, hence
it must be understood as describing the unperturbed dynamics of the electron.
Remembering the discussion of Sect. 3.3 one ﬁnds for the total, unperturbed energy
the expression Eu D m !2
0 s2
0=2, with m D 9:11  1031 kg the electron mass.
To tackle the perturbative calculation it is now necessary to estimate the energy
Er lost by the electron during an oscillation period 2 =!0 and compare it with
Eu. From Pu D du=d D !2

the electron’s acceleration, Pu2

This result shows that the energy lost during an oscillation period is indeed small,
so that the electron’s motion is only slightly perturbed with respect to the periodic
case. The equation of motion of the perturbed case can now tentatively be written as

is the variation in the oscillator’s energy during a period; a part of it crosses the

† (Sects. 5.3 and 5.11.2). The part that crosses † is the time average of (5.72)2; for
the sake of simplicity it is assumed that it is dominant with respect to the other one.
The factor hPu2i that appears in (5.72) is worked out by taking the time average of
the identity d.u  Pu/=d D Pu2 C u  Ru and observing that hd.u  Pu/=di is negligibly
small, whence hPu2i D hu  Rui > 0. In conclusion, deﬁning a time 0 such that

0/ ' 13  109 s. As the ratio of
the decay time to the period 2 =!0 is about 107, the perturbative approach is indeed

As anticipated at the beginning of this section, the planetary model of the atom
is not stable. The approximate solution (5.78) of the electron’s dynamics shows that
according to this model the electron would collapse into the nucleus in a very short
time due to the radiation emitted by the electron. This behavior is not observed
experimentally: in fact, the experiments show a different pattern in the energy-
emission or absorption behavior of the atoms. The latter are able to absorb energy
from an external radiation and subsequently release it: an absorption event brings
the atom to a higher-energy state called excited state; the absorbed energy is then
released by radiation in one or more steps (emissions) until, eventually, the atom
reaches the lowest energy state (ground state). However, when the atom is in the
ground state and no external perturbations is present, the atom is stable and no
emission occurs. In conclusion, the experimental evidence shows that the planetary
model is not applicable to the description of atoms.3

Comments About the Field’s Expansion into Modes
The homogeneous wave equation (5.20) used in Sects. 5.5, 5.8 as a starting point for
the derivation of the ﬁeld’s expansion into modes is based on the hypothesis that a
gauge transformation exists such that ' D 0. In turn, (5.20) derives from (5.19),
that implies the Coulomb gauge div A
D
0. To show that these conditions
are mutually compatible one chooses f in (4.30) such that '0 D 0, whence
E0 D @A0=@t due to the second relation in (4.26). In a charge-free space it is
div D0 D "0 div E0 D 0; it follows @ div A0=@t D 0, namely, div A0 does not depend
on time. The second equation in (4.19) with J D 0 yields .1=c2/ @E0=@t D rot B0,
so that .1=c2/ @2A0=@t2 D rot rot A0. Now let A0 D A00 C grad g, where g is an
arbitrary function of the coordinates only; the second identity in (A.35) and the

div A00 D div A0  r2g. Choosing g such that div A00 D 0 and dropping the double
apex ﬁnally yield (5.20) [85, Sect. 46].
The vector potential A has been expressed in (5.21) as a Fourier series and
in (5.44) as a Fourier integral. Such expressions produce a separation of the spatial
coordinates from the time coordinate: the former appear only in the terms exp.i kr/,
while the latter appears only in the terms ak and, respectively, bk.
The Fourier series (5.21) applies to the case of a ﬁnite domain of the form shown
in Fig. 5.1 and prescribes the spatial periodicity of A at all times. By way of example,
let 0  x2  d2, 0  x3  d3 and consider the point rA D x2 i2Cx3 i3; then, consider
a second point rB D d1 i1 C x2 i2 C x3 i3. By construction, rA and rB belong to two
opposite faces of the domain of Fig. 5.1 and are aligned with each other in the x1
direction. From (5.22) one obtains for any k
exp.i k  rB/ D exp.i 2  n1/ exp.i k  rA/ D exp.i k  rA/
(5.79)
which, combined with (5.21), yields A.rB; t/ D A.rA; t/. Clearly an equality of this
form is found for any pair of opposite boundary points that are aligned along the
coordinate direction normal to the faces where the points lie. On the other hand, such
an equality is a homogeneous relation among the boundary values of the solution of
the differential equation (5.20), namely, it is a homogeneous boundary condition of
the Dirichlet type.
The reasoning based on (5.79) is applicable also to the expressions (5.31, 5.32) to
yield E.rB; t/ D E.rA; t/ and B.rB; t/ D B.rA; t/, namely, the ﬁelds have the same
periodicity as A. The Poynting vector S D E ^ H has this property as well, whence
S.rB; t/  nB D S.rA; t/  nA; in fact, the unit vector n is oriented in the outward
direction with respect to the domain (Sect. 5.3), so that when two opposite faces of V
are considered it is nB D nA. Using (5.12) with W D 0 shows that dWem=dt D 0
namely, as noted in Sect. 5.6, the electromagnetic energy within V is conserved.
The same reasoning applies to the conservation of the electromagnetic momentum
found in Sect. 5.7. As for the initial condition on A, from (5.21) and (5.29) one
derives A.r; t D 0/ D P
k.ck C c
k/ exp.i k  r/. It follows that the initial condition
is provided by the vectors ck.
5.11.5
Finiteness of the Total Energy
The differential equation (5.20) is linear and homogeneous with respect to the
unknown A; when the Fourier series (5.21) is replaced in it, the resulting equa-
tion (5.28) is linear and homogeneous with respect to ak, hence (due to (5.29))
with respect to sk and ck as well. It follows that the ﬁelds (5.31, 5.32) are linear
and homogeneous functions of these quantities. The same applies in the case of an
inﬁnite domain (Sect. 5.8), in which the ﬁelds E, B are linear and homogeneous
functions of Qsk and dk.

In turn, the energy density wem of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, given by the second
relation in (5.11), is a quadratic and homogeneous function of the ﬁelds; this
explains why the expressions (5.37) and (5.46) are quadratic and homogeneous
functions of sk, ck or, respectively, Qsk, dk.
When (5.37) is considered, the energy associated with the individual degree of
freedom is Wk D 2 "0 V !2 jckj2; as the sum P
k Wk spans all wave vectors, the
factor !2 D c2 k2 diverges. On the other hand, the energy of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld within a ﬁnite region of space is ﬁnite; this means that the term jckj2 becomes
vanishingly small as jkj ! 1, in such a way as to keep the sum P
k Wk ﬁnite.
The same reasoning applies to the term jdkj2 in (5.46); in this case the ﬁniteness
of the total energy Wem is due to the fact that the vanishing of the ﬁelds at inﬁnity
makes the Fourier transform in (5.44) to converge.
5.11.6
Analogies Between Mechanics and Geometrical Optics
A number of analogies exist between the Maupertuis principle, discussed in
Sect. 2.7, and the Fermat principle discussed in Sect. 5.10. The principles read,
respectively,
ı
Z
AB
p
E  V ds D 0 ;
ı
Z
AB
n ds D 0 ;
(5.80)
and the analogies are:
1. A constant parameter is present, namely, the total energy E on one side, the
frequency  on the other side (in fact, the Fermat principle generates the eikonal
equation which, in turn, applies to a monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld,
Sect. 5.9).
2. Given the constant parameter, the integrand is uniquely deﬁned by a property of
the medium where the physical phenomenon occurs: the potential energy V.r/
and the refraction index n.r/, respectively.
3. The outcome of the calculation is a curve of the three-dimensional space: the
particle’s trajectory and the optical ray, respectively. In both cases the initial
conditions are the starting position and direction (in the mechanical case the
initial velocity is obtained by combining the initial direction with the momentum
extracted from E  V).
In summary, by a suitable choice of the units, the same concept is applicable to both
mechanical and optical problems. In particular it is used for realizing devices able
to obtain a trajectory or a ray of the desired form: the control of the ray’s shape is
achieved by prescribing the refraction index n by means of, e.g., a lens or a system
of lenses; similarly, the trajectory of a particle of charge e is controlled by a set of
electrodes (electrostatic lenses) that prescribe the electric potential ' D V=e. The
design of electron guns and of the equipments for electron-beam lithography and
ion-beam lithography is based on this analogy.

Applications of the Concepts of Electromagnetism
It must be emphasized that the Maupertuis principle is derived without approxi-
mations: as shown in Sect. 2.7, the principle is equivalent to Newton’s law applied
to a particle of constant energy. The Fermat principle, instead, is equivalent to the
eikonal equation; the latter, in turn, is derived from the Maxwell equations in the
hypothesis that at each position along the ray the curvature radius of the ray is
much larger than the wavelength. In other terms, the mechanical principle is exact
whereas the optical principle entails an approximation. If the exact formulation of
electromagnetism given by the Maxwell equation was used, the analogy discussed
here would be lost.
The rather surprising asymmetry outlined above could be ﬁxed by speculating
that Newton’s law is in fact an approximation deriving from more general laws,
possibly similar to the Maxwell equations. In this case one could identify in
such laws a parameter analogue of the wavelength, and deduce Newton’s law
as the limiting case in which the parameter is small. It will be shown later that
mechanical laws more general than Newton’s laws indeed exist: they form the object
of Quantum Mechanics.4
The analogy between Mechanics and Geometrical Optics discussed here is one
of the possible courses of reasoning useful for introducing the quantum-mechanical
concepts; however, in this reasoning the analogy should not be pushed too far. In
fact, one must observe that the Maupertuis principle given by the ﬁrst expression
in (5.80) provides the nonrelativistic form of Newton’s law, whereas the Maxwell
equations, of which the Fermat principle is an approximation, are intrinsically
relativistic. As a consequence, the analogy discussed in this section is useful
for generalizing the geometrical properties of the motion, but not the dynamic
properties.

Classical Distribution Function and Transport

6.1
Introduction
When a system made of a large number of molecules is considered, the description
of the dynamics of each individual member of the system is practically impossible,
and it is necessary to resort to the methods of Statistical Mechanics. The chapter
introduces the concept of distribution function in the phase space and provides the
deﬁnition of statistical average (over the phase space and momentum space) of a
dynamic variable. The derivation of the equilibrium distribution in the classical
case follows, leading to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The analysis proceeds
with the derivation of the continuity equation in the phase space: the collisionless
case is treated ﬁrst, followed by the more general case where the collisions are
present, thus leading to the Boltzmann Transport Equation. In the Complements,
after a discussion about the condition of a vanishing total momentum and angular
momentum in the equilibrium case, and the derivation of statistical averages based
on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the Boltzmann H-theorem is demonstrated.
This is followed by an illustration of the apparent paradoxes brought about by
Boltzmann’s Transport Equation and H-theorem: the violation of the symmetry of
the laws of mechanics with respect to time reversal, and the violation of Poincaré’s
time recurrence. The illustration is carried out basing on Kac’s ring model. The
chapter is completed by the derivation of the equilibrium limit of the Boltzmann
Transport Equation.

Distribution Function
Consider a system made of N identical particles with no constraints. For the sake
of simplicity, point-like particles are assumed, so that the total number of degrees
of freedom is 3 N. The dynamics of the jth particle is described by the canonical

coordinates q1j, q2j, q3j, p1j, p2j, p3j that belong to the 6-dimensional 
-space
introduced in Sect. 1.9.
If the number of particles is large, the description of the dynamics of each
individual belonging to the system is in fact impossible. For instance, the number
density of air at 20 ıC and 1 atm is about 2:5  1019 cm3. Even if the measurement
of the initial conditions was possible, it would not be feasible in practice [83,
Sect. 1]. This aspect is present also when the number of particles is much lower
than in the example above.
The problem is faced by adopting the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, whose
object is not the description of the dynamic behavior of the individual particles
but, rather, that of the distribution of the dynamic properties over the phase space.
To this purpose one identiﬁes each point of the 
-space with the pair of vectors
q D .q1; q2; q3/, p D .p1; p2; p3/ pertaining to it, and considers the elementary
volume d! D d3q d3p of the 
-space centered at .q; p/, with d3q D dq1 dq2 dq3
and the like for d3p. Then, the number of particles dN that at time t belong to d! is
given by
dN D f
.q; p; t/ d! ;
(6.1)
with f
 the concentration in the 
-space. The procedure here is similar to that carried
out in Sect. 23.2, the difference being that the space considered here is the phase
space instead of the conﬁguration space of Sect. 23.2.1 In both cases, the motion of
the particles is described as that of a continuous ﬂuid: in fact, index j is dropped
from the canonical coordinates, which do not indicate any more a speciﬁc particle,
but the center of the elementary cell of the phase space where the concentration f
is considered. As in Sect. 23.2, this procedure is legitimate if the cells of volume d!
into which the phase space is partitioned can be treated as inﬁnitesimal quantities
in the scale of the problem that is being investigated, and the number of particles
within each cell is large enough to make their average properties signiﬁcant. The
concentration f
 is also called distribution function. By deﬁnition it fulﬁlls the
normalization condition

Statistical Equilibrium
123
The function n.q; t/ deﬁned by the ﬁrst of (6.3) is the concentration of the particles
in the conﬁguration space.
Basing on the distribution function it is possible to deﬁne the average of a
dynamic function. For the sake of generality the dynamic function is considered to
be a vector that depends on all canonical coordinates and time, say, a D a.q; p; t/.
Due to the smallness of the cell size one assumes that the dynamic function takes
the same value for all particles within the same cell. As a consequence, the product
a f
 d! is the cell value of the function weighed by the number of particles belonging
to the cell. The statistical average of a over the phase space is then

Using the expression of N given by (6.2), and that of n given by the ﬁrst of (6.3),
shows that the deﬁnitions (6.4, 6.5) indeed provide the weighed averages of interest.
By way of example, the dynamic function may be identiﬁed with the particle

Statistical Equilibrium
This section deals with the properties of a system of particles in a condition
of macroscopic equilibrium. Considering that in general the systems that are
considered are composed of a large number of particles or molecules, the statistical
concepts introduced in Sect. 6.2 will be used. Generally speaking, the condition of
statistical equilibrium is fulﬁlled if the distribution function is independent of time.
This condition may be achieved in different ways: for instance, f
 D const fulﬁlls
the required condition. A more general deﬁnition of a distribution function fulﬁlling
the condition of statistical equilibrium is f
 D f
.c/, where c is any constant of
motion of the system. In case of a conservative system, energy is the most natural
constant of motion to be used.

Classical Distribution Function and Transport Equation
To proceed, consider a conservative system having a total energy ES, enclosed in
a stationary container of volume . Let the walls of the container be such that no
energy ﬂows across them. Also, the container is assumed to be sufﬁciently massive
so that it can be regarded as stationary despite the transfer of kinetic energy due to
the molecules’ collisions with the walls. If any external force acts on the molecules,
it is assumed to be independent of time and conservative [136, Sect. 26]. Finally,
the total momentum and angular momentum of the system are assumed to vanish;
this condition is by no means obvious and requires some reasoning, as detailed in
Sect. 6.6.1.
So far it has not been explicitly indicated whether the molecules that form the
system are identical to each other or not; in the practical cases it is to be expected
that the system under consideration be made of a mixture of different atoms or
molecules. As the extension to a mixture is straightforward [136, Sect. 30], the
analysis is limited here to a system made of identical molecules. It should be
noted that the molecules are identical, but distinguishable from each other: from the
point of view of Classical Mechanics a continuous observation of the trajectory of
each molecule is in fact possible, without disturbing its motion. As a consequence,
two systems that differ by the exchange of two molecules are to be considered as
different from each other.
To proceed one assumes that the number of molecules forming the system is
N, and that each molecule has R degrees of freedom. The canonical coordinates
that describe the motion of a single molecule are then q1; : : : ; qR, p1; : : : ; pR, so
that the number of dimensions of the 
-space is 2 R. As anticipated in Sect. 6.2,
the description of the precise state of each molecule is impossible in practice; the
state of the system will then be speciﬁed in a somewhat less precise manner, as
detailed below. First, each q axis of the 
-space is divided into equal intervals of
size q1; : : : ; qR and, similarly, each p axis is divided into equal intervals of size
p1; : : : ; pR. As a consequence, the 
-space is partitioned into elements, called
cells, whose volume and units are, respectively,
M D .q1 p1/ : : : .qR pR/ ;
ŒM D (J s)R :
(6.8)
The partitioning of the 
-space into cells has the advantage, ﬁrst, that the set of
cells is countable. Besides that, the partitioning into cells of ﬁnite size has a deeper
meaning, that becomes apparent when the theory outlined in this section is extended
to the quantum-mechanical case. In fact, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
(Sect. 10.6), the precision by which two conjugate variables can simultaneously be
known is limited, so that each product qi pi in (6.8) is bounded below, the bound
being of the order of the Planck constant.
After the partitioning is accomplished, the state of the system is assigned by
specifying the numbers N1; N2; : : :  0 of molecules that belong, respectively, to the
cell labeled 1; 2; : : :; such numbers are subjected to the constraint N1CN2C: : : D N
which, in view of the calculations that follow, is more conveniently expressed as

(6.9)
The sum in (6.9) may be thought of as extending to all cells, due to the fact that
only in a ﬁnite number of cases the cell population Ni differs from zero. Clearly,
the description using the numbers N1; N2; : : : is less precise than that given by
the molecules’ trajectories, and provides a partial speciﬁcation of the state of each
molecule within the limits of the size of M. This means, among other things, that
identical molecules belonging to different cells are distinguishable from each other,
whereas identical molecules belonging to the same cell are not distinguishable.
As mentioned above, the total energy of the system is ES, which provides a
second constraint to be vested with mathematical form. It is provisionally assumed
that the system is dilute, namely, that the energy of the interaction among the
molecules is negligible. It follows that one can approximately assign to each
molecule a total energy that corresponds to its position, momentum, and internal
conﬁguration, in other terms, to the cell where the molecule belongs. Letting
the energy corresponding to the ith cell be Ei, the constraint on energy reads
N1 E1 C N2 E2 C : : : D ES, namely,
FE.N1; N2; : : :/ D 0 ;
FE D ES 

Ni Ei :
(6.10)
The above reasoning does not apply to concentrated systems, where the interaction
energy is strong. However, it can be shown that (6.10) still holds, albeit with a
different interpretation of Ei [136, Sect. 29]. Another observation is that, given the
constraints to which the system is subjected, the set of numbers N1; N2; : : : may
not be unique. It is therefore necessary to extract the set, that actually describes the
system, from a larger number of sets made of all possible sets that are compatible
with the constraints.
To proceed, let N1; N2; : : : be a set that provides a molecules’ distribution
compatible with the constraints; such a set is called accessible state. It is postulated
that no accessible state is privileged with respect to any other; this is in fact the
fundamental hypothesis of equal a priori probability of the accessible states, upon
which Statistical Mechanics is based [136, Sect. 23]. Remembering that the parti-
cles are identical to each other, any system obtained from the original distribution
by exchanging two molecules is also compatible with the constraints. However,
the system resulting from the exchange of molecules belonging to different cells
is different from the original one because such molecules are distinguishable; in
contrast, an exchange within the same cell does not produce a different system. As
the total number of possible exchanges of N molecules of the system as a whole is
NŠ, and the number of possible exchanges within the ith cell is NiŠ, the total number
of different systems corresponding to a set N1; N2; : : : is
W.N1; N2; : : :/ D

Classical Distribution Function and Transport Equation
As time evolves, the interactions among the molecules make the numbers N1; N2; : : :
to change, so that, if the system is inspected at successive times, it may be found to
belong to different accessible states (as the principles of Classical Mechanics apply
here, such an inspection does not perturb the state of the system); in principle, given
enough time, the system will go through all accessible states. Now, the dependence
of W on N1; N2; : : : is quite strong, so that some accessible states correspond to a
large number W of systems, others to a much smaller number.2 As no accessible
state is privileged with respect to any other, the majority of inspections carried
out onto the system will provide the accessible state that maximizes W. Such an
accessible state corresponds, by deﬁnition, to the condition of statistical equilibrium
of the system under consideration.
6.4
Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
The analysis carried out in Sect. 6.3 led to the conclusion that the condition of
statistical equilibrium of the system is found by maximizing the expression of W
given by (6.11), under the constraints (6.9) and (6.10). The calculation is based upon
the Lagrange method that determines the free maximum of an auxiliary function F
embedding the constraints (Sect. B.6). It is convenient to maximize log W, which is
a monotonic function of W, instead of W itself, so that the auxiliary function reads
F.N1; N2; : : : ; ˛; ˇ/ D log W C ˛ FN C ˇ FE ;
(6.12)
where ˛, ˇ are the Lagrange multipliers, respectively related to the total number
of molecules and total energy of the system. In a typical system the total number
of molecules and the populations of the majority of nonempty cells are very large,3
so that the Stirling approximation (C.104) is applicable; it follows, after neglecting
terms of the form log

where N and P

of being very large is again of help, because, on account of the fact that a change

for instance N D 8: the combination N1 D 8, N2 D N3 D : : : D 0 yields W D 1, whereas the

one introduces a constant C such that

as that of a monatomic gas of mass m, described by the Cartesian coordinates xi and
conjugate momenta pi. Integrating (6.18) over the container’s volume  yields the
number dNp of atoms belonging to the elementary volume of the momentum space.
As the gas is assumed to be dilute, the energy in (6.18) is substantially of the kinetic

component along the x1 direction is 2 p1. The p2, p3 components, instead, are left
unchanged. The product of 2 p1 by the number of atoms hitting d† in the unit time
provides the force dF exerted by the gas on the surface element, whence the pressure
is obtained as P D dF=†. Now, consider an elementary cylinder whose base and
height are d† and dx1 respectively; the number d QN1 of atoms that belong to such a
cylinder and whose momentum p1 belongs to dp1 is obtained as the product of the
atoms’ concentration dNp= times the cylinder’s volume d† dx1 D d† dt dx1=dt D

As each atom in (6.22) undergoes a change 2 p1 in the momentum component due

by 2 p1, dividing it by dt, and integrating over p1 between 0 and C1; in fact, only

It can be shown that the validity of (6.26) is not limited to the case where the simple
derivation shown here applies. Actually, (6.26) is found to hold for any system that
follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law [136, Sect. 32] and also, as shown
in Sects. 15.9.1, 15.9.5, for quantum systems in equilibrium.
6.5
Boltzmann Transport Equation
The expressions worked out in this section show the important role of the distribu-
tion function. It is then necessary to determine the equation fulﬁlled by it when the
system is not in an equilibrium condition. The derivation is made in two steps; in the
ﬁrst one the interactions between molecules are neglected, in the second one they
are accounted for. To start with the ﬁrst step one observes that, due to the neglect
of collisions, the only force acting on the molecules is that of an external ﬁeld. To
denote the position in the phase space it is convenient to use the symbol s introduced
in Sect. 1.8. Here the symbol has a slightly different meaning, because the space is
6-dimensional instead of being n-dimensional. However, the relations (1.57, 1.58,
1.59) still hold. Applying to the 
-space the same reasoning used in Sect. 23.2 to
ﬁnd the continuity equation (23.3), and considering the case where no particles are
generated or destroyed, yield

. Replacing the latter into (6.27)
and using the Cartesian coordinates yields the Boltzmann collisionless equation5

From the meaning of a continuity equation it follows that divs

is the time
variation of f
 per unit volume d! of the 
-space. As f
 depends on r, p, and t, (6.28)
is recast in compact form as df=dt D 0.
To accomplish the second step, namely, adding the effects of collisions, one
observes that the latter produce a further time change in f
. In principle, one might
incorporate such effects into divs
Ps f
	
; however, it is more convenient to keep
the effects of collisions separate from those of the external ﬁeld. In fact, assuming
as before that the system under consideration is dilute, each molecule spends a
relatively large fraction of time far enough from the other molecules not to suffer
any interaction; in other terms, the time during which a molecule is subjected to the
external ﬁeld is much longer than that involved in a collision. For this reason it is
preferable to write the continuity equation, when the collisions are accounted for, as
@f
@t C Pr  gradrf
 C Pp  gradpf

(6.29)
called Boltzmann Transport Equation. In (6.29), term C indicates the time variation
of f
 per unit volume d! due to collisions, whereas divs
Ps f
	
keeps the meaning
of variation due to the external ﬁeld. The compact form of (6.29) reads in this case
df
dt D C ;
Z
C d! D 0 :
(6.30)
where the second relation is due to the normalization condition (6.2). In the
equilibrium condition the distribution function has no explicit dependence on
time (@f
=@t D 0) and depends on constants of motion only, so that C D 0.
The condition C D 0 does not prevent collisions from happening; in fact, in the
equilibrium condition the change in the state of two colliding particles is balanced
by simultaneous state changes of other particles that occur in the same elementary
volume d!, in such a way that the distribution function is left unchanged (principle
of detailed balance).
In the calculation of C it is assumed that collisions are of the binary type,
namely, that they involve only two particles at the time because the probability
of a simultaneous interaction of more than two particles is negligibly small. This
hypothesis, along with the assumption of a short duration of the interactions, greatly
simpliﬁes the calculation of C. This issue will not be pursued further here, because
it will be developed directly in the quantum case (Sect. 19.3.1). It is worth observing
that in a general nonequilibrium condition it is C ¤ 0; the second relation in (6.30)
then indicates that the form of C must be such, that in the integration over the

-space every elementary contribution to the integral is balanced by an opposite
contribution.

Momentum and Angular Momentum at Equilibrium
In the introductory discussion about statistical equilibrium, carried out in Sect. 6.3,
it has been assumed that the total momentum and angular momentum of the system
vanish. To discuss this issue, consider the box-shaped container whose cross-section
is shown in Fig. 6.1, ﬁlled with molecules identical to each other, having initial
positions near the right wall of the container. If the initial velocities are normal to
the wall and equal to each other, as schematically indicated by the arrows, the total
momentum P of the particles at t D 0 is different from zero. If the left and right
walls are perfectly reﬂecting and parallel to each other, the particles keep bouncing
back and forth between the two walls, and the total momentum alternates between
P and P. As the container’s mass is large, absorbing the momentum 2 P leaves the
stationary condition of the container unaltered. On the other hand, as remarked in
Sect. 1.3, this picture should not be regarded as describing a “system of particles,”
because the latter have no mutual interaction. To establish the interaction one must
assume that the initial velocities are slightly misaligned, or the walls are not exactly
parallel, or both; in this way the molecules will start colliding with each other and,
after some time, their velocities will not be parallel anymore. If each collision,
and reﬂection at the walls, is energy conserving, the total energy of the system
does not change; in contrast, opposite velocity components of different molecules
compensate each other in the calculation of the total momentum, so that the latter
will vanish after a sufﬁciently large number of collisions.6 A similar argument is
applicable to the case of the cylindrical container whose cross-section is shown in
Fig. 6.2, where the initial positions and velocities of the molecules are such that all
molecules would move along the square described by the arrows. In this case the
total angular momentum with respect to the cylinder’s axis is different from zero.
6If the walls are perfectly reﬂecting, and the collisions are elastic (Sect. 3.5), the molecular motions
are reversible so that, in both examples of this section, the initial condition is recovered by reversing
the direction of time. More comments about this are made in Sect. 6.6.4.

Averages Based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
In a system made of classical particles in equilibrium at temperature T, each
having R degrees of freedom, the average occupation number at energy Er is
given by (6.14). In general, the number of energy levels is large and their
separation small, so that one disposes of the index and considers the number
of particles belonging to the inﬁnitesimal interval dq1 dp1 : : : dqR dpR centered at
.q1; p1; : : : ; qR; pR/. After dropping the index, the energy becomes a function of
the position .q1; p1; : : : ; qR; pR/ of the interval’s center, E D E.q1; p1; : : : ; qR; pR/;
in turn, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (6.14) takes the form exp.˛ 

The physical systems where the energy is a quadratic form of the type (6.33) are
made of linear-harmonic oscillators, like those deriving from the diagonalization of
the Hamiltonian function of a system of particles near the mechanical-equilibrium
point (Sect. 3.10), or from the expression of the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
in vacuo in terms of modes (Sect. 5.6). For systems of this type the average energy of
the particles equals kB T times the number R of degrees of freedom of each particle.
Another important system is the dilute one, where the energy is essentially
kinetic. In this case the form of the latter is found by letting ai ! 0 in (6.33),
so that the energy is made of a sum of R terms instead of n D 2 R. Thus, the average
energy of the particles is given by an expression of the form (6.37) where n=2 is

As indicated in Sect. 6.5, the collision term will be worked out directly in the
quantum case. However, it is worth anticipating that the analysis of the collision
term C leads, both in the classical and quantum cases, to an important conclusion:
the time derivative dHB=dt is negative for any distribution function f
 different
from the equilibrium one, while it vanishes in the equilibrium case. This result
is the Boltzmann H-theorem. This implies that if a uniform system is initially
set in a condition described by a nonequilibrium distribution function, and the
external forces are removed, then the initial distribution cannot be stationary: an
equilibration process occurs, that brings the distribution to the equilibrium one, and
whose duration is dictated by the time constants typical of C. The decrease of HB
with respect to time while the system reaches the equilibrium condition reminds one
of the behavior of entropy. In fact, it can be shown that HB is the entropy apart from
a negative multiplicative factor and an additive constant [141, Sect. 18.3].7
The demonstration of the Boltzmann H-theorem is given below considering for
simplicity the partitioning of the phase space into a discrete set of cells, like that
used in Sect. 6.3. As before, the number of particles of the system is N; the cells are
labeled by a single index. Letting Nr D Nr.t/ be the number of particles belonging
to the rth cell at time t, the fraction Pr.t/ of particles belonging to the same cell is
7Compare with the deﬁnition of entropy given in Sect. 15.9.1 which, at ﬁrst sight, looks different.
The equivalence between the two deﬁnitions is justiﬁed in Sects. 47 and 102 of [136].

vanishes for Pr D 1, whereas it is negative for 0 < Pr < 1 (Fig. 6.5). It follows
that HB is by construction a non-positive quantity. Observing that N > 0, the only
condition for HB to vanish occurs when all particles belong to the same cell. To
examine the time evolution of HB one calculates the derivative

In turn, the time derivative of Pr is obtained from a balance equation: let Wsr  0
be the unconditional probability per unit time that a particle makes a transition from
the sth to the rth cell, s ¤ r. Thus, the number of particles that in the unit time
make a transition from the sth to the rth cell is Wsr Ns; adding up the above over
all cells different from r provides the increase per unit time in the population of the
rth cell. In parallel to this, there are particles that make a transition from the rth
cell to any different cell, thus contributing to the decrease of Nr; letting Wrs be the
unconditional probability per unit time of a transition from the rth to the sth cell,
the balance equation at time t reads

Wsr depends on the interactions of the particles among each other and with external
perturbing agents. If the system is assumed to be isolated, Wsr is determined only by
the mutual interactions of the particles. The calculation shows that in this case Wsr
is independent of time; also, it can be shown that Wsr is invariant upon the exchange

Paradoxes—Kac-Ring Model
It is known that the Boltzmann Transport Equation (6.29), and the H-theorem
derived from it, bring about two apparent paradoxes: the ﬁrst one is that the equation
contains irreversibility, because any initial distribution function, different from the
equilibrium one, evolves towards the equilibrium distribution when the external
forces are removed, whereas an opposite evolution never occurs. This outcome is
in contrast with the symmetry of the laws of mechanics with respect to time reversal
(Sect. 2.6.1). The second paradox is the violation of Poincaré’s time recurrence,
which states that every ﬁnite mechanical system returns to a state arbitrarily close to

method.

the initial one after a sufﬁciently long time (called Poincaré cycle); this is forbidden
by the H-theorem that prevents entropy from decreasing back to the initial value.
A discussion about the mathematical origin of the paradoxes can be found, e.g., in
[141, Sect. 18.4]; a qualitative insight into the question is given by a simple model,
called Kac’s ring model, also reported in [141] and taken from [76]. In the model,
N objects are uniformly distributed over a circle, so that at time t D 0 each object
is ascribed to a speciﬁc arc. The objects have two possible states, say, either “0” or
“1.” The time variable is discrete so that, when time evolves from k t to .kC1/ t,
k D 0; 1; 2; : : :, each object moves clockwise from the arc it occupied at time k t to
the next arc. A number n < N of markers is present along the circle: speciﬁcally, the
markers’ positions are at the junctions between two neighboring arcs. The objects
that cross the position of a marker change the state from “0” to “1” or vice versa;
those that do not cross the position of a marker keep their state.
Given the number of objects and markers, the initial state of each object, and the
markers’ positions along the circle, one wants to investigate the time evolution of
the states. Such an evolution is obviously time reversible and fulﬁlls Poincaré’s time
recurrence; in fact, the set of objects goes back into the initial condition after N time
steps if n is even, and after 2 N time steps if n is odd.
Providing the time evolution of the individual object’s state is in fact a micro-
scopic description of the system; as remarked in Sect. 6.2, such a description
becomes impossible when the number of objects in the system is large. A less
detailed, macroscopic description of the Kac ring consists, for instance, in providing
the time evolution of the number of “0” states. However, the outcome of the latter
analysis seems to indicate that an irreversible process takes place; for instance,
Fig. 6.3 shows a computer calculation of the time evolution of the number of “0”
states in two samples made of N D 4;000 objects, which at time t D 0 were all
set to “0.” The markers of the two samples are n D 4 and n D 8, respectively,
and the number of time steps is much smaller than N. Both curves tend to decrease
and, after some ﬂuctuations (that depend on the markers’ positions), stabilize to a
constant value; the same behavior occurs at a larger number of markers, although the
number of time steps necessary to reach a constant value increases (curve n D 16 in
Fig. 6.4). A further increase in the number of markers makes the ﬂuctuations more
pronounced (curve n D 32 in the same ﬁgure) (Fig. 6.5).
On the other hand, a similar calculation using a number of time steps larger than
the number of objects shows that the stabilization at or around a constant value is
eventually lost: the system fulﬁlls Poincaré’s time recurrence and recovers the initial
condition (Fig. 6.6). Such an outcome is not detectable in real many-body systems,
because the Poincaré cycle is enormously long with respect to the typical time scales
of experiments.9
A detailed analysis of the dilemma is given in [58], where the time evolution of
the Kac-ring model is calculated as follows: let Fk be the number of objects that at
9A crude estimate of the Poincaré cycle yields  exp.N/, with N the total number of molecules in
the system [65, Sect. 4.5]. In typical situations such a time is longer than the age of the universe.

no way to eliminate fk, vk from (6.50) as they stand; as the set of available equations

is not closed, the time evolution of the macroscopic quantities cannot be computed
without introducing further relations.
To proceed, one introduces the hypothesis of a random distribution of markers,
so that the probability that a marker is present at the edge of an arc, in the clockwise
direction, is P D n=N. It follows fk D P Fk and vk D P Vk, whence the third relation
in (6.50) becomes DkC1 D C Dk, with C D 1  2 P. As the result holds for any
index, the time evolution follows in the form
Dk D Ck D0 ;
jCj < 1 :
(6.51)
where the inequality derives from 0 < P < 1. In (6.51) it is limk!1 Dk D
0, namely, the additional hypothesis makes the system to reach an equilibrium
conﬁguration in which the populations of “0” and “1” states are equal: in fact,
the dynamics described by (6.51) is irreversible. In conclusion, the hypothesis
of a random distribution of markers has provided the closure condition of the
problem, at the cost of disregarding the past history of the system’s evolution
(besides, Dk in (6.51) is not an integer any more). The basic idea is that such a
random distribution of markers represents the typical behavior of large rings. More
discussion on this issue is found in [58].

Equilibrium Limit of the Boltzmann Transport Equation
As remarked in Sect. 6.5, in the equilibrium condition the distribution function has
no explicit dependence on time (@f
=@t D 0) and depends on constants of motion
only, so that C D 0. From (6.29) it then follows that Pr  gradrf

case of a conservative system, energy is the most natural constant of motion to be

Apart from the trivial case f

recasting the Hamilton equations (1.42) as Pr D gradpH, Pp D gradrH, and
replacing them in (6.52), reduces the term in parentheses to PrPpCPpPr, thus showing
that the equation is fulﬁlled identically regardless of the explicit form of f
.H/.
This result implies that the equilibrium distribution (6.14) cannot be extracted solely
from the equilibrium limit of (6.29); its derivation requires also the maximization
procedure described in Sects. 6.3 and 6.4.

Problem
141
The equilibrium limit of the Boltzmann Transport Equation described in this
section applies in general; as a consequence, it includes also cases like that of (6.31),
where a magnetic force is involved. This seems to contradict one of the hypotheses
used in Sect. 6.3 to derive the equilibrium distribution, namely, that the system
is acted upon by conservative forces. To clarify the issue one uses the concepts
illustrated in Sects. 1.5,1.6; ﬁrst, one notes that the equilibrium limit is achieved
by making the external force independent of time, so that the scalar and vector
potentials whence E and B derive are independent of time as well: ' D '.r/,
A D A.r/ (the dependence on space is kept to account for the possibility that
the system under consideration is not uniform). It follows that the Hamiltonian
function, which in this case is given by (1.35), is still a constant of motion; as a
consequence, the procedure leading to (6.52) is applicable. One notes in passing
that each summand in the resulting identity Pr  Pp C Pp  Pr becomes in this case
Pp  u D e .E C u ^ B/  u D e E  u ;

Introduction
This chapter tackles the difﬁcult problem of bridging the concepts of Classical
Mechanics and Electromagnetism with those of Quantum Mechanics. The subject,
which is fascinating per se, is illustrated within a historical perspective, covering
the years from 1900, when Planck’s solution of the black-body radiation was given,
to 1926, when Schrödinger’s paper was published.
At the end of the 1800s, the main branches of physics (mechanics, thermody-
namics, kinetic theory, optics, electromagnetic theory) had been established ﬁrmly.
The ability of the physical theories to interpret the experiments was such, that many
believed that all the important laws of physics had been discovered: the task of
physicists in the future years would be that of clarifying the details and improving
the experimental methods. Fortunately, it was not so: the elaboration of the
theoretical aspects and the reﬁnement in the experimental techniques showed that
the existing physical laws were unable to explain the outcome of some experiments,
and could not be adjusted to incorporate the new experimental ﬁndings. In some
cases, the theoretical formulations themselves led to paradoxes: a famous example
is the Gibbs entropy paradox [87]. It was then necessary to elaborate new ideas
that eventually produced a consistent body generally referred to as modern physics.
The elaboration stemming from the investigation of the microscopic particles led
to the development of Quantum Mechanics, that stemming from investigations on
high-velocity dynamics led to Special Relativity.
This chapter starts with the illustration of the planetary model of the atom,
showing that the model is able to justify a number of experimental ﬁndings; this
is followed by the description of experiments that cannot be justiﬁed in full by
the physical theories existing in the late 1800s: stability of the atoms, spectral
lines of excited atoms, photoelectric effect, spectrum of the black-body radiation,
Compton effect. The solutions that were proposed to explain such phenomena are
then illustrated; they proved to be correct, although at the time they were suggested
a comprehensive theory was still lacking. This part is concluded by a heuristic

derivation of the time-independent Schrödinger equation, based upon the analogy
between the variational principles of Mechanics and Geometrical Optics.
In the ﬁnal part of this chapter the meaning of the wave function is given: for
this, an analysis of the measuring process is carried out ﬁrst, showing the necessity
of describing the statistical distribution of the measured values of dynamic quantities
when microscopic particles are dealt with; the connection with the similar situations
involving massive bodies is also analyzed in detail. This chapter is concluded with
the illustration of the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function.
7.2
Planetary Model of the Atom
Several experiments were carried out in the late 1800s and early 1900s, whose
outcome was the determination of a number of fundamental constants of atomic
physics; among them, the electron charge-to-mass ratio was measured by J. J.
Thomson in 1897, and electron charge was measured by R. Millikan in 1909
(Table D.1). A theory of the atom was proposed by E. Rutherford after a series of
experiments in 1909–1914, that led to the measurement of the atomic radius ra. The
experiments consisted in measuring the broadening of beams of ﬁnely collimated
˛ particles1 passing through thin metal foils. The latter were typically made of
gold sheets with a thickness of a few thousand atomic layers; the dynamics of
the interaction between an ˛ particle and the metal foil was treated by Classical
Mechanics, using an interaction of the Coulomb type (Sect. 3.8). The outcome of
the experiments led Rutherford to conceive the planetary model of the atom; this
model depicts the atom as made of a small nucleus of atomic charge Z q surrounded
by Z electrons, where q is the absolute value of the electron charge and Z indicates
the position of the element in the periodic table. The model assumes that as the
˛-particles are rather heavy, they are deﬂected mainly by the nuclei2 of the foil;
the type of deﬂection implies that the majority of the ˛ particles is deﬂected only
once when crossing the foil, thus indicating that the foil’s atoms are placed far apart
from each other. In fact, the deﬂection experiments made it possible to estimate3 the
atom’s and nucleus’ diameters, respectively, as
ra  0:1 nm ;
re  2  106 p
Z nm ;
Z D 1; 2; : : : :
(7.1)
1These particles are obtained by ionizing helium atoms.
2The meaning of the term “nucleus” in this context needs to be clariﬁed. Throughout this book
the term is used to indicate the system made of protons, neutrons, and core electrons, namely,
those electrons that do not belong to the outer shell of the atom and therefore do not participate
in the chemical bonds. In solid-state materials, core electrons are negligibly perturbed by the
environment, in contrast to the electrons that belong to the outer shell (valence electrons).
3The estimate means that for scale lengths equal or larger than those indicated in (7.1), an atom
or a nucleus can be considered as geometrical points having no internal structure. The electron’s
radius can be determined in a similar way using X-ray diffusion.

Planetary Model of the Atom

As Z ranges from 1 to about 100, the second relation in (7.1) shows that re  ra
(compare with Table D.1).
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. The planetary model depicts it as an
electron moving nearby the proton under the effect of a Coulomb potential V, where
the energy reference is chosen in such a way as to make V.1/ D 0. Then, the theory
of the Coulomb interaction in the attractive case applies (Sect. 3.13.6). As the proton
is much more massive than the electron, its position can be approximated with that
of the atom’s center of mass, and placed in the origin; in summary, it is

(7.2)
where r is the electron position, u its velocity’s module, T and E its kinetic and total
energies, respectively, and "0 the permittivity of vacuum. The planetary model is
extended to more complicate atoms by considering an outer electron moving nearby
a core of net charge q embedding Z protons and Z  1 electrons, or to even more
complicate cases (hydrogenic-like systems). Observing that T D E  V D E C
jVj  0, and remembering the analysis of Sect. 3.8, one ﬁnds that two cases are
possible: the ﬁrst one, shown in Fig. 7.1, is E  0, corresponding to V  0  E and
rmax D 1 (free electron). The second case is E < 0, corresponding to V  E < 0
and rmax < 1 (bound electron). For the qualitative reasoning to be carried out here,
it is sufﬁcient to consider the simpler case of a bound electron whose trajectory is
circular (Fig. 7.2). In such a case, using the results of Sects. 3.7 and 3.13.6 after
letting Z1 D Z2 D 1 and replacing s with r, yields r D 4  "0 M2

It follows dE=dr D jEj=r > 0, that is, the total energy is larger at larger orbits (this
is a particular case of the general theory worked out in Prob. 3.2).
Despite its simplicity, the planetary model is able to explain phenomena like
the excitation and ionization of atoms; excitation corresponds to the absorption of
energy from an external electromagnetic ﬁeld, such that an initially bound electron
increases its energy from E1 to E2, where E1 < E2 < 0: the electron in the ﬁnal
state is still bound. The inverse process is the emission of energy in the form of an
electromagnetic radiation, so that the electron’s total energy decreases from E2 to E1.
In turn, ionization corresponds to the absorption of energy such that an initially
bound electron becomes free: E1 < 0 and E2  0. The inverse process is the capture
of a free electron by an ionized atom, with an energy emission equal to E2  E1.
The above reasoning can also be used to explain the behavior of systems more
complicate than single atoms. For instance, consider a ﬁnite linear monatomic
chain, namely, a system made of a ﬁnite number of identical atoms placed along
a line, at equal mutual distances (Fig. 7.3), which can be thought of as a rudimental
version of a crystal. The positions of the atoms are marked by the dots visible
in the upper part of the ﬁgure. Let the chain be aligned with the x axis; if each
nucleus is made to coincide with a local origin of the reference, the distance
r D
p
x2 C y2 C z2 in the expression of the potential energy becomes jxj; the
potential energy pertaining to each nucleus is proportional to 1=jxj and is indicated
with a dashed line in the ﬁgure. An electron placed at some position in the chain
is subjected to the sum of the potential energies; being the latter negative, the
sum is lower than the individual contributions: in the ﬁgure, it is indicated by the
continuous line, which for simplicity is drawn by adding up the contributions of
the nearest-neighboring nuclei only. The chain, however, has a ﬁnite length; when
the leftmost nucleus is considered, the potential energy on its left does not suffer any

Fig. 7.3 Schematic description of the potential energy in a linear monatomic chain
lowering: this creates the energy step visible in the ﬁgure. The same happens on the
right side of the rightmost nucleus. The shape of the potential energy thus obtained
is able to qualitatively explain several features of crystals. For instance, consider by
way of example the case where the only force acting on an electron inside the crystal
derives from the potential energy of Fig. 7.3, namely, it is a conservative force. If
the total energy of the electron under consideration is E1, the electron’s position is
conﬁned within the potential well dictated by the initial position of its motion. Thus,
the electron oscillates within the well like in the example of Prob. 3.2, and its motion
cannot extend out of it; if all electrons of the crystal are bound, the material is an
insulator. This reasoning implies that the situation where all electrons are bound is
maintained also under the application of an external voltage; due to this, no electric
current ensues.
If the total energy of the electron under consideration is E2, the electron can move
within the whole crystal; ﬁnally, if the total energy is E3, the electron overcomes
one or the other of the energy steps and moves into vacuum: for this reason,
the minimum energy E0 necessary for the electron to leave the crystal is called
vacuum level. If the two ends of the crystal are connected to a voltage generator
by suitable contacts, and an external voltage is applied, the material can carry an
electric current, whose amplitude depends also on the number of electrons whose
energy is sufﬁciently high.4 It is worth noting that although this is prohibited in the
frame of Classical Mechanics, the electrons whose energy is of the type E2 may also
contribute to the current; in fact, Quantum Mechanics shows that they have a ﬁnite
probability to penetrate the energy step and reach the contact. This phenomenon is
called tunnel effect (Sect. 11.3.1).
To proceed it is convenient to give Fig. 7.3 a simpler appearance: in fact,
considering that the interatomic distance is a fraction of a nanometer, the spatial
extent in the x direction where each peak is placed is hardly visible in a macroscopic
representation; for this reason, it is sufﬁcient to graphically indicate the envelope
E˛ of the peaks. By the same token, the steps on the sides are described as
discontinuities (Fig. 7.4). The electrons with E < E˛ or E  E˛ are called,
4The combination of the number of such electrons with other factors also determines whether the
material is a conductor or a semiconductor (Chap. 18).

respectively, bound electrons and free electrons.5 In the equilibrium condition the
total energy of the electrons is prescribed; it follows that the majority of the electrons
has an energy E lower than a given value Eˇ (which is not necessarily larger than
E˛). Thus, the difference W D E0  Eˇ is a measure of the energy that is necessary
to extract an electron from the material: among other things, the model explains the
existence of a minimum extraction energy of the electrons.6
7.3
Experiments Contradicting the Classical Laws
About 1900, experimental evidence was found for a number of phenomena that
contradict the calculations based on the known physical laws, that is, the laws of
Analytical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Statistical Mechanics. A number of
such phenomena are listed in this section.
7.3.1
Stability of the Atom
The solution of the electromagnetic equations shows that an accelerated electron
radiates a power given by (5.72), namely, q2 Pv2=.6  "0 c3/, with Pv the electron’s
acceleration. As discussed in Sect. 5.11.2, this is in contradiction with the planetary
model of the atom (7.3), in which T C V D E D const: due to the radiated power,
the electron should lose energy and, as a consequence, the atom should shrink. The
possibility of an extremely slow, non-detectable shrinking must be ruled out: in fact,
a perturbative calculation (Sect. 5.11.3) shows that due to the energy loss the atomic
radius should decrease from the initial value, say, r, to the value r=e in about 108
s. This, however, is not observed (Sect. 9.7.2).
5The description is qualitative; for instance, it does not consider the band structure of the solid
(Sect. 17.6).
6When the material is a conductor, Eˇ coincides with the Fermi level (Sect. 15.8.1), and W is called
work function; in a semiconductor, Eˇ coincides with the lower edge EC of the conduction band
(Sect. 17.6.5) and the minimum extraction energy (typically indicated with a symbol different from
W) is called electron afﬁnity (Sect. 22.2).

7.3.2
Spectral Lines of Excited Atoms
The planetary model explains the emission of electromagnetic radiation by excited
atoms. The explanation, however, is qualitative only, because the model does not
impose any constraint on the frequency of the emitted waves. In contrast, the
experiments show that the waves emitted by, e.g., hydrogen atoms have frequencies
 of the form (Balmer law, 1885),7

where n; m are integers, m > n  1. The emissions described by (7.4) are also
called spectral lines. The lower series of spectral lines are shown in Fig. 7.5 along
with their designations; the numbers in the ﬁgure correspond to n, m in (7.4).
Another experimental ﬁnding shows that instead of occurring with a single emission
of frequency nm, the release of electromagnetic energy by the atom may be
accomplished in steps; if that happens, the frequencies associated with the individual
steps fulﬁll a relation called Ritz emission rule: considering, e.g., two steps, it reads
nm D nk C km ;
(7.5)
with nk, km the frequencies of the individual steps.

in the 1880s to the hydrogenic-like atoms by Rydberg: the expression (7.4) of the frequencies must
be multiplied by a constant that depends on the atom under consideration.

Photoelectric Effect
It is found that an impinging electromagnetic radiation extracts charges from a metal
(H. Hertz, 1887) and that these charges are electrons (J. J. Thomson, 1899). The
phenomenon is ascribed to the absorption of energy from the radiation: the electron
absorbs an energy sufﬁciently large to be extracted from the metal. An electron thus
extracted is also called photoelectron. A sketch of the measuring apparatus is given
in Fig. 7.6, where two electrodes, anode (A) and cathode (K), are placed inside a
vacuum tube in order to prevent interactions between the photoelectrons and the
atmosphere. A voltage VAK is applied to the electrodes, such that VAK > 0 when the
electric potential at the anode is larger than that at the cathode. A monochromatic
radiation of a given intensity is made to impinge on the cathode, whose surface
is marked with †, and the current I ﬂowing in the tube is recorded. Important
parameters are the radiation’s frequency , the spectral intensity of the radiation,

The outcome of the experiment is shown in arbitrary units in Figs. 7.7 and 7.8. The

When VAK is positive and sufﬁciently high, it is expected that practically all electrons
extracted from the cathode be driven to the anode; as a consequence, the slope of
the curves should be negligible. Also, when the intensity of the radiation increases,
the number of extracted electrons, and the current with it, should also increase. This
is in fact conﬁrmed by the curves of Fig. 7.7. When, instead, VAK is negative, only
the electrons leaving the cathode with a sufﬁciently high kinetic energy are able
to reach the anode, whereas those whose initial kinetic energy is low are repelled

wall of an enclosure kept at constant temperature, like that illustrated in Fig. 7.9: any
radiation entering the hole has a negligible probability of escaping, due to multiple
reﬂections at the walls; as a consequence, the hole acts like a perfect absorber.

In turn, the integral of u over the coordinates gives the equilibrium value of the
spectral energy, whose general deﬁnition is given by (5.47).
The spectral energy density u can be calculated as the product of the number
of monochromatic components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld per unit volume and
frequency, times the energy of each monochromatic component. The ﬁrst factor is
readily found by taking an enclosure of prismatic form like that of Sect. 15.9.4; the
calculation yields 8  2=c3, which is obtained by dividing both sides of (15.74) by
the enclosure’s volume V. As for the energy of each monochromatic component, the
only assumption possible in the frame of Classical Mechanics is that the energy of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld at equilibrium is distributed over the frequencies according
to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (6.14). Assuming that each monochromatic
component is equivalent to a one-dimensional linear-harmonic oscillator, the energy
to be associated with it is the average energy of a system with one degree of freedom;
thus, letting R D 1 in (6.37) yields for the average energy the value kB T. The
product of the two factors thus found yields for the spectral energy density of the
black body the expression

(7.15)
called Rayleigh-Jeans law. Experimental results for u as a function of frequency are
shown in Fig. 7.10, with temperature a parameter. The comparison with experiments
shows that the parabolic behavior of (7.15) approximates the correct form of the
curves only at low frequencies; clearly the result expressed by (7.15) cannot be
correct, because it makes the equilibrium energy density (7.14) to diverge.12
7.3.5
Compton Effect
When X-rays of a given frequency interact with atoms and are scattered with an
angle  with respect to the direction of incidence, the frequency of the emerging
rays is found to depend on  . This outcome is in contrast with the prediction of
the electromagnetic theory, according to which the frequency of the scattered rays
should be equal to that of the impinging ones. The dependence of frequency on the
scattering angle is also called Compton effect.
11Compare with the general deﬁnition (5.10) of wem, where the assumption of equilibrium is not
made.
12This unphysical outcome is also called ultraviolet catastrophe.

From Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics
7.4
Quantum Hypotheses
In the early 1900s, a number of hypotheses were made to solve the contradictions
between the experimental evidence and the calculations based on the physical laws
known at that time. The solutions thus found and the new concepts originating
from them were eventually combined into a uniﬁed and coherent theory, Quantum
Mechanics.
In essence, the contradictions with the physical laws known in the early
1900s were found thanks to the reﬁnement of the experimental techniques. Such
reﬁnements were in turn made available by the general advancement of science that
had taken place in the preceding decades. Thanks to them, it was possible to start
investigating the microscopic world, namely, the dynamics of elementary particles.
A parallel improvement took place in the same years in the investigation of the
dynamics at high velocities, and led to the concepts of Special Relativity (1905).13
7.4.1
Planck’s Solution of the Black-Body Problem
To explain the features of the black-body radiation, Planck made in 1900 the
hypothesis that a monochromatic electromagnetic energy is absorbed or emitted
only in quantities that are integer multiples of a ﬁxed quantity h, where h is a
suitable constant [104]. The occupation number then becomes
Pn D P0 exp.nˇ h / ;
ˇ D 1=.kB T/ :
(7.16)
As a consequence, using the same procedure as in Sect. 6.6.2 after replacing the
integrals with sums, yield for the average energy AvŒn h  the expression14
AvŒn h  D

exp.ˇ h /  1 :
(7.17)
In contrast with the constant value kB T used in the determination of the Rayleigh-
Jeans law, here the average energy of each monochromatic component depends
on the component’s frequency. Multiplying (7.17) by the number 8  2=c3 of
monochromatic components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld per unit volume and
frequency, found in Sect. 7.3, yields for the spectral energy density of the black
body the expression
13As the particles’ velocities that occur in solid-state physics are low, Special Relativity is not
used in this book; the only exception is in the explanation of the Compton effect, illustrated in
Sect. 7.4.3.
14The detailed calculation leading to (7.17) is shown in Prob. 6.1.

called Planck law (1900). The derivation of (7.18) involves one undetermined
parameter, h. If the latter is made equal to the Planck constant introduced in
the description of the photoelectric effect (Sect. 7.3), the resulting expression ﬁts
perfectly the experimental data like those of Fig. 7.10. Remembering that the
spectral energy density of a black body in equilibrium is a universal function, it
follows that h does not depend on the speciﬁc experiment, namely, it is a universal
constant.
The low-frequency limit of (7.18), h   kB T, is independent of h and renders
the Rayleigh-Jeans law (7.15).
7.4.2
Einstein’s Solution of the Photoelectric Effect
In 1905, Einstein proposed the following explanation of the photoelectric effect:
the transport of electromagnetic energy is quantized; speciﬁcally, a monochromatic
electromagnetic wave of frequency  is made of the ﬂux of identical objects,
called photons, each carrying the energy h . In the interaction with a photon, an
electron may absorb an energy up to h . If the absorbed energy is exactly h,
the photon is annihilated [45].15 This theory provides a correct explanation of the
photoelectric effect: with reference to Fig. 7.7, the photoelectric current increases
as the spectral power … increases at constant , because the number of photons is
larger: as a consequence, the number of photoelectrons is larger as well. In turn, with
reference to Fig. 7.8, the blocking voltage VR increases as  increases at constant …,
because the photons are more energetic; however, they are fewer, which explains
why the curves intersect each other: the spectral power, in fact, can be written as
… D dE=.dt d/ D h  ŒdN=.dt d/, where the quantity in brackets is the number
of photons per unit time and frequency; as a consequence, the constraint … D const
of the experiment of Fig. 7.8 makes the quantity in brackets to decrease when the
photon energy h  increases.
7.4.3
Explanation of the Compton Effect
The concept of photon, introduced in Sect. 7.4.2, explains the Compton effect
by describing the interaction of the electron with the electromagnetic ﬁeld as
the collision between the electron and a photon [29]. As the photon’s velocity
15Einstein’s hypothesis is more general than Planck’s: the latter, in fact, assumes that energy is
quantized only in the absorption or emission events.

is c, its rest mass is zero (Sect. 3.13.7); in turn, the modulus of the photon’s
momentum is p D E=c, which is consistent with classical electromagnetism
(compare with (5.43)).
The analysis of the electron-phonon collision is worked out assuming that
the system made of the two particles under consideration is isolated; thus, the
calculation is based upon the energy- and momentum-conservation equations, and
the results of Sect. 3.13.8 hold. The dynamic quantities for the photon are given by
E D h  ;
p D E
c D h 
c D h
 ;
(7.19)
the second of which derives from (5.55) expressed in vacuo. Deﬁning the reduced
Planck constant „ D h=.2 / ' 1:055  1034 J s, and using the modulus k of the
wave vector, (7.19) becomes
E D „ 2  D „ ! ;
p D

=.2 / D „ k :
(7.20)
The second relation of (7.20) in vector form reads
p D „ k :
(7.21)
Here the useful outcome of the analysis of Sect. 3.13.8 is (3.92), that relates the
photon’s energies prior and after the collision (Ea and Eb, respectively) with the
deﬂection angle  (Fig. 3.7). Using E D c h= in (3.92) yields

with 0 ' 2:43  1012 m the Compton wavelength (1923). The frequency
corresponding to it is 0 D c=0 ' 1:2  1020 Hz. The maximum difference in
wavelength corresponds to the case of reﬂection, max.b  a/ D 2 0. Even in
this case, the smallness of 0 makes the effect difﬁcult to measure; in practice, the
shift in wavelength is detectable only for sufﬁciently small values of a, typically in
the range of 1010 m corresponding to the X-ray frequencies (  1018 s1). Due
to the large energy of the photon, the energy transferred to the electron brings the
latter into a high-velocity regime; this, in turn, imposes the use of the relativistic
expressions for describing the electron’s dynamics.
7.4.4
Bohr’s Hypothesis
The description of the monochromatic components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as
a ﬂow of identical photons with energy h  lends itself to the explanation of the
Balmer law (7.4). Such an explanation (Bohr’s hypothesis, 1913) is based on the

7.4

159
idea that if nm is the frequency of the emitted radiation, the corresponding energy
of the emitted photon is h nm; multiplying (7.4) by h and remembering that m > n
then yields

As the left-hand side is the energy of the emitted photon, the terms on the right-hand
side can be recast as
Em D hR
m2 ;
En D hR
n2 ;
En < Em < 0 I
(7.24)
then, if Em (En) is interpreted as the atom’s energy before (after) emitting the
photon, Balmer’s law becomes the expression of energy conservation. From this,
the emission rule of Ritz is easily explained; in fact, (7.5) is equivalent to
Em  En D .Em  Ek/ C .Ek  En/ :
(7.25)
Bohr’s hypothesis is expressed more precisely by the following statements:
1. The energy variations of the atom are due to the electrons of the outer shell, that
exchange energy with the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
2. The total energy of a non-radiative state is quantized, namely, it is associated
with an integer index: En D h R=n2, n D 1; 2; : : :; the values of energy thus
identiﬁed are called energy levels. The lowest level corresponds to n D 1 and is
called ground level or ground state.
3. The total energy can vary only between the quantized levels by exchanging with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld a photon of energy nm D .Em  En/=h.
It is interesting to note that by combining Bohr’s hypothesis with the planetary
model of the atom, the quantization of the other dynamic quantities follows from
that of energy; again, the case of a circular orbit is considered. By way of example,
using En D h R=n2 in the second relation of (7.3) provides the quantization of the
orbit’s radius:
r D rn D 
q2
8  "0 En

(7.26)
The smallest radius r1 corresponds to the ground state n D 1; taking R from (7.4)
and the other constants from Table D.1 one ﬁnds r1 ' 0:05 nm; despite the
simplicity of the model, r1 is fairly close to the experimental value ra given in (7.1).
In turn, the velocity is quantized by combining (7.3) to obtain T D V=2 D E;
replacing the expressions of T and E then yields

The largest velocity is found from (7.27) by letting n D 1 and using the minimum
value for the mass, that is, the rest mass m D m0. It turns out u1 ' 7  103 c;
as a consequence, the velocity of a bound electron belonging to the outer shell
of the atom can be considered nonrelativistic. Thanks to this result, from now on
the electron’s mass will be identiﬁed with the rest mass. Finally, for the angular

Mn D n „ :
(7.29)
The Bohr hypothesis provides a coherent description of some atomic properties;
yet it does not explain, for instance, the fact that the electron belonging to an
orbit of energy En D h R=n2 does not radiate, in contrast to what is predicted
by the electromagnetic theory (compare with the discussion in Sect. 7.3). Another
phenomenon not explained by the hypothesis is the fact that only the ground state
of the atom is stable, whereas the excited states are unstable and tend to decay to the
ground state.
7.4.5
De Broglie’s Hypothesis
The explanation of the Compton effect (Sect. 7.4.3) involves a description of the
photon’s dynamics in which the latter is treated like a particle having energy and
momentum. Such mechanical properties are obtained from the wave properties of
a monochromatic component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld: the relations involved
are (7.19) (or (7.20)), by which the photon energy is related to the frequency, and
its momentum to the wave vector. It is worth specifying that such relations are
applied to the asymptotic part of the motion, namely, when the photon behaves
like a free particle. In 1924, de Broglie postulated that analogous relations should
hold for the free motion of a real particle: in this case, the fundamental dynamic
properties are energy and momentum, to which a frequency and a wavelength (or a
wave vector) are associated by relations identical to (7.19), (7.20),17
16This result shows that the physical constants appearing in (7.28) are not independent from each
other. Among them, R is considered the dependent one, while q, m D m0, "0, and h are considered
fundamental.
17The wavelength associated with the particle’s momentum is called de Broglie’s wavelength.

(7.30)
The usefulness of associating, e.g., a wavelength to a particle’s motion lies in the
possibility of qualitatively justifying the quantization of the mechanical properties
illustrated in Sect. 7.4.4. For this, consider the case of the circular orbit of the
planetary motion, and associate a wavelength with the particle’s momentum,  D
h=p. Such an association violates the prescription that (7.30) apply only to a free
motion; however, if the orbit’s radius is very large, such that   r, the orbit may be
considered as locally linear and the concept of wavelength is applicable. Replacing
 D h=p in (7.29) yields
2  r D n  ;
(7.31)
namely, the quantization of the mechanical properties implies that the orbit’s length
is an integer multiple of the wavelength associated with the particle. This outcome
suggests that the formal description of quantization should be sought in the ﬁeld of
eigenvalue equations.
De Broglie also postulated that a function  D  .r; t/, containing the parameters
!, k deﬁned in (7.30), and called wave function, is associated with the particle’s
motion. Its meaning is provisionally left indeﬁnite; as for its form, it is sensible to
associate with the free motion, which is the simplest one, the simplest wave function,
that is, the planar monochromatic wave. The latter is conveniently expressed in
complex form as
 D A expŒi .k  r  ! t/ ;
(7.32)
where A ¤ 0 is a complex constant, not speciﬁed. Due to (7.30), the constant
wave vector k identiﬁes the momentum of the particle, and the angular frequency
! identiﬁes its total energy, which in a free motion coincides with the kinetic
energy. It is worth pointing out that despite its form, the wave function is not
of electromagnetic nature; in fact, remembering that in a free motion it is H D

The concepts introduced so far must now be extended to motions of a more
general type. A sensible generalization is that of the conservative motion of a
particle subjected to the force deriving from a potential energy V.r/. In this case
the association described by (7.30) works only partially, because in a conservative
motion the total energy is a constant, whereas momentum is generally not so. As a
consequence, letting ! D E=„ yields for the wave function the form
 D w.r/ exp.i ! t/ ;
(7.36)
which is still monochromatic but, in general, not planar. Its spatial part w.r/ reduces
to A exp.i k  r/ for the free motion. The function of the form (7.36) is postulated
to be the wave function associated with the motion of a particle at constant energy
E D „!. While the time dependence of  is prescribed, its space dependence must
be worked out, likely by solving a suitable equation involving the potential energy
V, the particle’s mass and, possibly, other parameters.
7.5
Heuristic Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation
The concept of wave function introduced in Sect. 7.4.5 has been extended from
the case of a free motion, where the wave function is fully prescribed apart from
the multiplicative constant A, to the case of a conservative motion (7.36), where
only the time dependence of the wave function is known. It is then necessary
to work out a general method for determining the spatial part w.r/. The starting
point is the observation that w is able at most to provide information about the
particle’s trajectory, not about the particle’s dynamics along the trajectory. One of
the methods used in Classical Mechanics to determine the trajectories is based on
the Maupertuis principle (Sect. 2.7); moreover, from the discussion carried out in
Sect. 5.11.6 it turns out that the analogy between the Maupertuis principle and the
Fermat principle of Geometrical Optics (compare with (5.80)) provides the basis for
a generalization of the mechanical laws. The ﬁrst of the two principles applies to a
particle (or system of particles) subjected to a conservative force ﬁeld prescribed
by a potential energy V.r/, with E a given constant; the second one applies to
a monochromatic ray ( D const) propagating in a medium whose properties
are prescribed by the refraction index n.r/. The latter is related to frequency and
wavelength by n D c=. / (compare with (5.55)); as a consequence, (5.80) can be
rewritten as

where ˛ is a constant that must not depend on the form of V or , nor on other

the Geometrical-Optics approximation; when this happens, the Fermat principle is
replaced with the Maxwell equations or, equivalently, with the wave equations for
the electric ﬁeld (4.64) and magnetic ﬁeld (4.65). For simplicity, the latter equations
are solved in a uniform medium with no charges in it, on account of the fact
that ˛ is not inﬂuenced by the medium’s properties. Also, considering that in the
uniform case (4.64) and (4.65) have the same structure, and that the function w
under investigation is scalar, the analysis is limited to any scalar component C of E

a differential equation holds in a uniform medium; hence, the dynamic property
involved is the kinetic energy of the particle. The extension to the case of a
nonuniform medium is then obtained by using the general form E  V of the kinetic
energy in terms of the coordinates; in conclusion, the equation for the spatial part of
the wave function in a conservative case is
r2w C 2 m

(7.44)
The above is the time-independent Schrödinger equation. It is a homogenous
equation, with E the eigenvalue and w the eigenfunction.18 Although the derivation
based on the analogy between mechanical and optical principles is easy to follow, it
must be remarked that the step leading from (7.43) to (7.44) is not rigorous; in the
electromagnetic case, in fact, Eq. (7.41) for the spatial part holds only in a uniform
medium; when the latter is nonuniform, instead, the right-hand side of (7.41) is
different from zero, even in a charge-free case, because it contains the gradient of
the refraction index. As shown in Sect. 1.10.4, the actual method used in 1926 by
Schrödinger for deriving (7.44) consists in seeking the constrained extremum of
a functional generated by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation; in such a procedure, the
hypothesis of a uniform medium is not necessary.
It is also worth noting that in the analogy between mechanical and optical
principles the spatial part of the wave function, and also the wave function as a
whole, is the analogue of a component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. From this
standpoint, the analogue of the ﬁeld’s intensity is the wave function’s square
modulus. In the monochromatic case, the latter reads j j2 D jwj2. This reasoning is
useful in the discussion about the physical meaning of  .

7.6
Measurement
To make the wave function a useful tool for the description of the particles’
dynamics it is necessary to connect the value taken by  , at a speciﬁc position
and time, with some physical property of the particle (or system of particles) under
investigation. To make such a connection it is in turn necessary to measure the
property of interest; otherwise, the hypotheses illustrated in the previous sections
would be relegated to a purely abstract level. In other terms, the meaning of the
wave function can be given only by discussing the measuring process in some detail.
The analysis is carried out below, following the line of [86]; in particular, a general
formalism is sought which applies to both the macroscopic and microscopic bodies;
the speciﬁc features brought about by the different size of the objects that are being
measured are made evident by suitable examples.
The measurement of a dynamic variable A pertaining to a physical body is
performed by making the body to interact with a measuring apparatus and recording
the reading shown by the latter. For simplicity it is assumed that there is a ﬁnite
number of possible outcomes of the measurement, say, A1; : : : ; AM. The extension
to the case of a continuous, inﬁnitely extended set of outcomes can be incorporated
into the theory at the cost of a more awkward notation. Letting Ai be the outcome
of the measurement of A, consider the case where the body is later subjected to
the measurement of another dynamic variable B. Assume that the outcome of such
a measurement is Bj, out of the possible outcomes B1; : : : ; BN. Next, the body is
subjected to the measurement of a third variable C, thus yielding the value Ck, and
so on.
As in general the dynamic variables depend on time, it is necessary to specify
the time of each measurement. The most convenient choice is to assume that the
time interval between a measurement and the next one is negligibly small, namely,
that the measurement of B takes place immediately after that of A, similarly for
that of C, and so on. The duration of each measurement is considered negligible as
well. A special consequence of this choice is the following: if the measurement of
A yielded Ai, and the measurement is repeated (namely, B D A), the outcome of the
second measurement is again Ai.
Consider now the case where, after ﬁnding the numbers Ai, Bj, and Ck from the
measurements of A, B, and C, respectively, the three variables are measured again,
in any order. The experiments show that the results depend on the size of the body
being measured. For a massive body the three numbers Ai, Bj, and Ck are always
found. One concludes that the dynamic state of a massive body is not inﬂuenced
by the interaction with the measuring apparatus or, more precisely, that if such an
inﬂuence exists, it is so small that it cannot be detected. As a consequence one may
also say that the values of the dynamic variables are properties of the body that exist
prior, during, and after each measurement.
The situation is different for a microscopic body. By way of example, consider
the case of a measurement of B followed by a measurement of A, the ﬁrst one
yielding Bn, the second one yielding Ai. If the measurement of B is carried out

again after that of A, the result is still one of the possible outcomes B1; : : : ; BN, but
it is not necessarily equal to Bn. In other terms, the individual outcome turns out to
be unpredictable. For a microscopic body one concludes that the interaction with
the measuring apparatus is not negligible. It is worth observing that the apparatus
able to measure the dynamic variable A may also be conceived in such a way as to
block all outcomes that are different from a speciﬁc one, say, Ai. In such a case the
apparatus is termed ﬁlter. Using the concept of ﬁlter one may build up the statistical
distribution of the outcomes, for instance by repeating a large number of times the
experiment in which the measurement of B is carried out after ﬁltering Ai. The
statistics is built up by recording the fraction of cases in which the measurement
of B carried out on an Ai-ﬁltered body yields the result Bj, j D 1; : : : ; N.
7.6.1
Probabilities
The fraction of measurements of the type described above, namely, of those that
yield Bj after a measurement of A that has yielded Ai, will be indicated with the
symbol P.Ai ! Bj/. Obviously the following hold:

(7.45)
The ﬁrst relation in (7.45) is due to the deﬁnition of P.Ai ! Bj/, the second
one to the fact that the set of values B1; : : : ; BN encompasses all the possible
outcomes of the measurement of B. It follows that P.Ai ! Bj/ is the probability
that a measurement of the dynamic variable B, made on a particle that prior to the
measurement is in the state Ai of the dynamic variable A, yields the value Bj. The
possible combinations of P.Ai ! Bj/ are conveniently arranged in the form of an

Due to (7.45), each row of PAB adds up to unity. As the number of rows is M, the
sum of all entries of matrix (7.46) is M. The same reasoning can also be made when
the measurement of B is carried out prior to that of A. In this case the following

(7.49)
for any pair of indices ij. In fact, if (7.49) did not hold, thermodynamic equilibrium
would not be possible [86, Chap. V-21]. Equality (7.49) makes PBA the transpose of
PAB. As a consequence, the sum of all entries of the two matrices must be the same,
namely, N D M. In other terms the outcomes of the measurements have the same
multiplicity, and the matrices (7.46), (7.47) are square matrices of order N D M.

showing that in the matrices (7.46), (7.47) not only each row, but also each column
adds up to unity. A square matrix where all entries are nonnegative and all rows and
columns add up to unity is called doubly stochastic matrix. Some properties of this
type of matrices are illustrated in [94, Chap. II-1.4] and in Sect. A.11.4.
Note that (7.49) does not imply any symmetry of PAB. In fact, symmetry would
hold if P.Aj ! Bi/ D P.Ai ! Bj/. If the ﬁltered state is Ai and the measurement of
the dynamic variable A is repeated, the result is Ai again. In other terms,

7.6.2
Massive Bodies
It is useful to consider the special case where the measurement of B does not change
the outcome of a previous measurement of A, and vice versa. In other terms, assume
that the measurement of A has yielded Ai and the subsequent measurement of B has
yielded Bj; then, another measure of A yields Ai again, a later measure of B yields
Bj again, and so on. It follows that in P0
AB it is P0.Ai ! Bj/ D 1, while all remaining
entries in the ith row and jth column are equal to zero. This situation is typical of
the bodies that are sufﬁciently massive, such that the interference suffered during the
measurement of a dynamic variable is not detectable. For the sake of clarity an apex
is used here to distinguish the probabilities from those of the general case where the
body’s mass can take any value. Considering a 4  4 matrix by way of example, a
possible form of the matrix would be

(7.52)
that is, one of the 4Š possible permutation matrices of order 4. Clearly all the other
permutation matrices of order 4 different from (7.52) are equally possible. The
meaning of a matrix like (7.52) is that the successive measurements of A and B yield
either the pair A1; B2, or the pair A2; B3, or A3; B1, or A4; B4. Matrix (7.52) may be
thought of as a limiting case: starting from a microscopic body described by a 44,
doubly stochastic matrix whose entries are in general different from zero, the size
of the body is increased by adding one atom at a time, and the set of measurements
of A and B is repeated at each time. As the reasoning that prescribes the doubly
stochastic nature of the matrix holds at each step, the successive matrices must tend
to the limit of a permutation matrix. Which of the 4Š permutation matrices will be
reached by this process depends on the initial preparation of the experiments. One
may wonder why a matrix like

should not be reached. In fact, such a matrix is not acceptable because it is
not doubly stochastic: its transpose implies that the outcomes B1 and B2 are
simultaneously associated with A2 with certainty, which is obviously impossible
not only for a massive body, but for any type of body. This reasoning is associated
with another argument, based on the theorem mentioned in Sect. A.11.4, stating that
a doubly stochastic matrix is a convex combination of permutation matrices. Letting
1; : : : ; M be the combination’s coefﬁcients as those used in (A.70), in the process

of transforming the microscopic body into a macroscopic one all the coefﬁcients but
one vanish, and the nonvanishing one tends to unity. As a consequence, out of the
original combination, only one permutation matrix is left.
7.6.3
Need of a Description of Probabilities
The non-negligible inﬂuence of the measuring apparatus on the dynamic state of
a microscopic body makes it impossible to simultaneously measure the dynamic
variables that constitute the initial conditions of the motion. As a consequence, the
possibility of using the Hamiltonian theory for describing the dynamics is lost. As
outlined in the above sections, the distinctive mark of experiments carried out on
microscopic objects is the statistical distribution of the outcomes; thus, a theory that
adopts the wave function as the basic tool must identify the connection between the
wave function and such a statistical distribution. The theory must also contain the
description of the massive bodies as a limiting case.
7.7
Born’s Interpretation of the Wave Function
Basing on the optical analogy and the examination of experiments, the probabilistic
interpretation of the wave function introduced by Born states that the integral
Z

j .r; t/j2 d3r
(7.54)
is proportional to the probability that a measuring process ﬁnds the particle within
the volume  at the time t.19 Note that the function used in (7.54) is the square
modulus of  , namely, as noted in Sect. 7.5, the counterpart of the ﬁeld’s intensity
in the optical analogy. Also, considering that by deﬁnition the integral of (7.54) is
dimensionless, the units20 of  are m3=2.
When  ! 1 the integral in (7.54) may, or may not, converge. In the ﬁrst case,
 is said to be normalizable, and a suitable constant  can be found such that the
integral of j j2 over the entire space equals unity. The new wave function provides
a probability proper,
Z

(7.55)
19From this interpretation it follows that j j2 d3r is proportional to an inﬁnitesimal probability,
and j j2 to a probability density.

Consider a particle whose wave function at time t differs from zero within some
volume , and assume that a process of measuring the particle’s position is initiated
at t and completed at some later time t0; let the outcome of the experiment be an

differs from zero in a smaller volume 0  . This event is also called contraction
of the wave function.

Chapter 8
Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
8.1
Introduction
The properties of the time-independent Schrödinger equation are introduced step by
step, starting from a short discussion about its boundary conditions. Considering
that the equation is seldom amenable to analytical solutions, two simple cases
are examined ﬁrst: that of a free particle and that of a particle in a box. The
determination of the lower energy bound follows, introducing more general issues
that build up the mathematical frame of the theory: norm of a function, scalar
product of functions, Hermitean operators, eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of oper-
ators, orthogonal functions, and completeness of a set of functions. This chapter is
concluded with the important examples of the Hamiltonian operator and momentum
operator. The complements provide examples of Hermitean operators, a collection
of operators’ deﬁnitions and properties, examples of commuting operators, and a
further discussion about the free-particle case.
8.2
Properties of the Time-Independent Schrödinger
Equation
A number of properties of the time-independent Schrödinger equation are discussed
in this section. The equation holds only when the force is conservative; however,
as will be shown later, many of its properties still hold in more complicate cases.
Equation (7.44) is a linear, homogeneous partial-differential equation of the second
order, with the zero-order coefﬁcient depending on r. As shown in Prob. 8.1, it is
a very general form of linear, second-order equation. The boundary conditions are
speciﬁed on a case-by-case basis depending on the problem under consideration.
More details about the boundary conditions are discussed below. One notes that:

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
1. The coefﬁcients of (7.44) are real. As a consequence, the solutions are real.
In same cases, however, it is convenient to express them in complex form. An
example is given in Sect. 8.2.1.
2. The equation is linear and homogeneous and, as shown below, its boundary
conditions are homogeneous as well. It follows that its solution is deﬁned apart
from a multiplicative constant. The function w D 0 is a solution of (7.44);
however, it has no physical meaning and is not considered.
3. As the equation is of the second order, its solution w and ﬁrst derivatives @w=@xi
are continuous. These requirements are discussed from the physical standpoint
in Sect. 9.4. The second derivatives may or may not be continuous, depending
on the form of the potential energy V.
4. The solution of (7.44) may contain terms that diverge as jrj ! 1. In this case
such terms must be discarded because they are not compatible with the physical
meaning of w (examples are given in Sect. 8.2.1).
Given the above premises, to discuss the boundary conditions of (7.44) it is
convenient to distinguish a few cases:
A. The domain  of w is ﬁnite; in other terms, some information about the
problem in hand is available, from which it follows that w vanishes identically
outside a ﬁnite domain . The continuity of w (see point 3 above) then implies
that w vanishes over the boundary of , hence the boundary conditions are
homogeneous. After discarding possible diverging terms from the solution, the
integral
R
 jwj2 d is ﬁnite (the use of the absolute value is due to the possibility
that w is expressed in complex form, see point 1 above).
B. The domain of w is inﬁnite in all directions, but the form of w is such that
R
 jwj2 d is ﬁnite. When this happens, w necessarily vanishes as jrj ! 1.
Thus, the boundary conditions are homogeneous also in this case.1
C. The domain of w is inﬁnite, and the form of w is such that
R
 jwj2 d diverges.
This is not due to the fact that jwj2 diverges (in fact, divergent terms in w
must be discarded beforehand), but to the fact that w, e.g., asymptotically tends
to a constant different from zero, or oscillates (an example of asymptotically
oscillating behavior is given in Sect. 8.2.1). These situations must be tackled
separately; one ﬁnds that w is still deﬁned apart from a multiplicative constant.
As remarked above, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is a second-order
differential equation of a very general form. For this reason, an analytical solution
can seldom be obtained, and in the majority of cases it is necessary to resort
to numerical-solution methods. The typical situations where the problem can be
tackled analytically are those where the equation is separable (compare with
1It may happen that the domain is inﬁnite in some direction and ﬁnite in the others. For instance,
one may consider the case where w vanishes identically for x  0 and differs from zero for x < 0.
Such situations are easily found to be a combination of cases A and B illustrated here.

Sect. 10.3), so that it can be split into one-dimensional equations. Even when this
occurs, the analytical solution can be found only for some forms of the potential
energy. The rest of this chapter provides examples that are solvable analytically.
8.2.1
Schrödinger Equation for a Free Particle
The equation for a free particle is obtained by letting V D const in (7.44). Without
loss of generality one may let V D 0, thus yielding r2w D .2 m E=„2/ w. As the
above can be solved by separating the variables, it is sufﬁcient to consider here only
the one-dimensional form
d2w
dx2 D 2 m E
„2
w :
(8.1)
The case E < 0 must be discarded as it gives rise to divergent solutions, which are
not acceptable from the physical standpoint. The case E D 0 yields w D a1x C a2,
where a1 must be set to zero to prevent w from diverging. As a consequence, the
value E D 0 yields w D a2 D const, that is one of the possibilities anticipated at
point C of Sect. 8.2. The integral of jwj2 diverges. Finally, the case E > 0 yields
w D c1 exp.i k x/ C c2 exp.i k x/ ;
k D
p
2 m E=„2 D p=„ > 0 ;
(8.2)
where c1, c2 are constants to be determined. Thus, the value E > 0 yields the
asymptotically oscillating behavior that has also been anticipated at point C of
Sect. 8.2. The integral of jwj2 diverges. One notes that w is written in terms of
two complex functions; it could equally well be expressed in terms of the real
functions cos.k x/ and sin.k x/. The time-dependent, monochromatic wave function
 D w exp.i ! t/ corresponding to (8.2) reads
 D c1 expŒi .k x  ! t/ C c2 expŒi .k x C ! t/ ;
! D E=„ :
(8.3)
The relations k D p=„, ! D E=„ stem from the analogy described in Sect. 7.4.5.
The total energy E and momentum’s modulus p are fully determined; this outcome
is the same as that found for the motion of a free particle in Classical Mechanics: for
a free particle the kinetic energy equals the total energy; if the latter is prescribed,
the momentum’s modulus is prescribed as well due to E D p2=.2 m/. The direction
of the motion, instead, is not determined because both the forward and backward
motions, corresponding to the positive and negative square root of p2 respectively,
are possible solutions. To ascertain the motion’s direction it is necessary to acquire
more information; speciﬁcally, one should prescribe the initial conditions which, in
turn, would provide the momentum’s sign.
The quantum situation is similar, because the time-dependent wave function (8.2)
is a superposition of a planar wave c1 expŒi .k x  ! t/ whose front moves in the
www.ebook3000.com

174

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
positive direction, and of a planar wave c2 expŒi .k x C ! t/ whose front moves in
the negative direction. Here to ascertain the motion’s direction one must acquire the
information about the coefﬁcients in (8.2): the forward motion corresponds to c1 ¤
0, c2 D 0, the backward motion to c1 D 0, c2 ¤ 0. Obviously (8.2) in itself does not
provide any information about the coefﬁcients, because such an expression is the
general solution of (8.1) obtained as a combination of the two linearly independent,
particular solutions exp.i k x/ and exp.i k x/; so, without further information about
c1 and c2, both the forward and backward motions are possible.
Another similarity between the classical and quantum cases is that no constraint
is imposed on the total energy, apart from the prescription E  0. From this
viewpoint one concludes that (8.1) is an eigenvalue equation with a continuous
distribution of eigenvalues in the interval E  0.

let V D const D 0 for x 2 Œ0; a and V D V0 > 0 elsewhere. The form of the
potential energy is that of a square well whose counterpart of Classical Mechanics
is illustrated in Sect. 3.2. Here, however, the limit V0 ! 1 is considered for the
sake of simplicity. This limiting case is what is referred to with the term box. As
shown in Sect. 11.5, here w vanishes identically outside the interval Œ0; a: this is
one of the possibilities that were anticipated in Sect. 8.2 (point A). The continuity
of w then yields w.0/ D w.a/ D 0. It is easily found that if E  0 the only solution
of (8.4) is w D 0, which is not considered because it has no physical meaning. When
E > 0, the solution reads
w D c1 exp.i k x/ C c2 exp.i k x/ ;
k D
p
2 m E=„2 > 0 :
(8.5)
Letting w.0/ D 0 yields c1 C c2 D 0 and w D 2 i c1 sin.k x/. Then, w.a/ D 0 yields

of E and w,

(8.6)
This result shows that (8.4) is an eigenvalue equation with a discrete distribution
of eigenvalues, given by the ﬁrst relation in (8.6). For this reason, the energy is
said to be quantized. To each index n it corresponds one and only one eigenvalue
En, and one and only one eigenfunction wn; as a consequence, this case provides

175
a one-to-one-correspondence between eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.2 Not every
integer should be used in (8.6) though; in fact, n D 0 must be discarded because the
corresponding eigenfunction identically vanishes. Also, the negative indices are to
be excluded because En D En and jwnj2 D jwnj2, so they do not add information
with respect to the positive ones. In conclusion, the indices to be used are n D

As expected, each eigenfunction contains a multiplicative constant; here the
integral of jwj2 converges, so the constant can be exploited to normalize the

introduced a discontinuity of the second kind into the potential energy; for this
reason, the property mentioned above does not apply.
8.2.3
Lower Energy Bound in the Schrödinger Equation
In the example of Sect. 8.2.1, where the free particle is considered, the lower bound
for the particle’s total energy is E  Vmin, with Vmin the minimum3 of the potential
energy; in contrast, in the example of the particle in a box illustrated in Sect. 8.2.2,
the lower bound is E > Vmin. A more general analysis of the lower bound for the
total energy in the Schrödinger equation is carried out here.

homogeneous boundary conditions, it is often convenient to choose the constant
such that the norm equals unity. This is accomplished by letting ' D c f and
jj'jj D 1, whence jcj2 D 1=jjfjj2.
Consider two square-integrable functions f and g deﬁned over the same domain
; their scalar product is deﬁned as
hgjfi D

g f d :

(8.14)
It is implied that f, g are regular enough to make the integral in (8.13) to exist; in
fact, this is proved by observing that for square-integrable functions the Schwarz
inequality holds, analogous to that found in the case of vectors (Sect. A.2): if f and
g are square integrable, then

where the equality holds if and only if f is proportional to g (compare with (A.5)).
In turn, to prove (8.15) one observes that  D f C  g, where  is an arbitrary
constant, is also square integrable. Then [62],
jjjj2 D jjfjj2 C jj2 jjgjj2 C  hfjgi C  hgjfi  0 :
(8.16)
The relation (8.15) is obvious if f D 0 or g D 0. Let g ¤ 0 and choose  D
hgjfi=jjgjj2. Replacing in (8.16) yields (8.15). For the equality to hold it must be
 D 0, which implies that f and g are proportional to each other; conversely, from
f D c g the equality follows.
The symbol hgjfi for the scalar product is called Dirac’s notation.5 If hgjfi D 0,
the functions f, g are called orthogonal. For any complex constants b, b1, b2 the
following hold:
hgjb fi D b hgjfi ;
hgjb1 f1 C b2 f2i D b1 hgjf1i C b2 hgjf2i ;

hb gjfi D b hgjfi ;
hb1 g1 C b2 g2jfi D b

(8.18)
namely, the scalar product is distributive and bilinear. The properties deﬁned here
are the counterpart of those deﬁned in Sect. A.1 for vectors.
8.3.1
Adjoint Operators and Hermitean Operators
A function appearing within a scalar product may result from the application of
a linear operator, say, A , onto another function.6 For instance, if s D A f, then
from (8.13, 8.14) it follows
hgjsi D
Z

g A f d ;
hsjgi D
Z

.A f/ g d D hgjsi :
(8.19)
Given an operator A it is possible to ﬁnd another operator, typically indicated with
A , having the property that, for any pair f; g of square-integrable functions,
Z


A g
	 f d D


g A f d
(8.20)
5The two terms hgj and jfi of the scalar product hgjfi are called bra vector and ket vector,
respectively.
6In this context the term operator has the following meaning: if an operation brings each function f
of a given function space into correspondence with one and only one function s of the same space,
one says that this is obtained through the action of a given operator A onto f and writes s D A f.
A linear operator is such that A .c1 f1 C c2 f2/ D c1 A f1 C c2 A f2 for any pair of functions f1, f2
and of complex constants c1, c2 [96, Chap. II.11].

or, in Dirac’s notation, hA gjfi D hgjA fi. Operator A  is called the adjoint 7 of
A . In general it is A  ¤ A ; however, for some operators it happens that A  D A .
In this case, A is called Hermitean. Thus, for Hermitean operators the following
holds:
hgjA fi D hA gjfi D hgjA jfi :
(8.21)
The notation on the right of (8.21) indicates that one can consider the operator as
applied onto f or g. Examples of Hermitean operators are given in Sect. 8.6.1. It
is found by inspection that for any operator C , the operators S D C C C  and
D D i .C  C / are Hermitean.
The following property is of use: a linear combination of Hermitean operator
with real coefﬁcients is Hermitean; considering, e.g., two Hermitean operators A ,

Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of an Operator
A linear operator A may be used to generate a homogeneous equation (eigenvalue
equation) in the unknown v, having the form8
A v D A v ;
(8.23)
with A a parameter. Clearly (8.23) admits the solution v D 0 which, however,
is of no interest; it is more important to ﬁnd whether speciﬁc values of A exist
(eigenvalues), such that (8.23) admits nonvanishing solutions (eigenfunctions). In
general (8.23) must be supplemented with suitable boundary or regularity conditions
on v.
The set of the eigenvalues of an operator found from (8.23) is the operator’s
spectrum. It may happen that the eigenvalues are distinguished by an index, or a set
of indices, that take only discrete values; in this case the spectrum is called discrete.
If, instead, the eigenvalues are distinguished by an index, or a set of indices, that
vary continuously, the spectrum is continuous. Finally, it is mixed if a combination
of discrete and continuous indices occurs.
An eigenvalue is simple if there is one and only one eigenfunction corresponding
to it, while it is degenerate of order s if there are s linearly independent eigenfunc-

tions corresponding to it. The order of degeneracy may also be inﬁnite. By way of
example, the Schrödinger equation for a free particle in one dimension discussed
in Sect. 8.2.1 has a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues E D „2 k2=.2 m/ of index
k, namely, E D Ek. Each eigenvalue is degenerate of order 2 because to each E
there correspond two linearly independent eigenfunctions exp.i k x/, exp.i k x/,
with k D
p
2 m E=„. Instead, the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box
discussed in Sect. 8.2.2 has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues En given by the ﬁrst
relation in (8.6). Each eigenvalue is simple as already indicated in Sect. 8.2.2.
Let v.1/; : : : ; v.s/ be the linearly independent eigenfunctions belonging to an
eigenvalue A degenerate of order s; then a linear combination of such eigenfunctions
is also an eigenfunction belonging to A. In fact, letting ˛1; : : : ; ˛s be the coefﬁcients

8.4.1
Eigenvalues of Hermitean Operators
A fundamental property of the Hermitean operators is that their eigenvalues are
real. Consider, ﬁrst, the case where the eigenfunctions are square integrable, so
that hvjvi is different from zero and ﬁnite. To proceed one considers the discrete
spectrum, where the eigenvalues are An. Here n indicates a single index or also a set
of indices. If the eigenvalue is simple, let vn be the eigenfunction belonging to An;
if it is degenerate, the same symbol vn is used here to indicate any eigenfunction
belonging to An. Then, two operations are performed: in the ﬁrst one, the eigenvalue
equation A vn D An vn is scalarly multiplied by vn on the left, while in the second
one the conjugate equation .A vn/ D A
n v
n is scalarly multiplied by vn on the
right. The operations yield, respectively,
hvnjA vni D An hvnjvni ;
hA vnjvni D A
n hvnjvni :
(8.25)
The left-hand sides in (8.25) are equal to each other due to the hermiticity of A ; as
a consequence, A
n D An, that is, An is real.
Another fundamental property of the Hermitean operators is that two eigen-
functions belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other. Still
considering the discrete spectrum, let Am, An be two different eigenvalues and let
vm (vn) be an eigenfunction belonging to Am (An). The two eigenvalues are real
as demonstrated earlier. Then, the eigenvalue equation A vn D An vn is scalarly
multiplied by vm on the left, while the conjugate equation for the other eigenvalue,
.A vm/ D Am v
m, is scalarly multiplied by vn on the right. The operations yield,
respectively,

8.4

181
hvmjA vni D An hvmjvni ;
hA vmjvni D Am hvmjvni :
(8.26)
The left-hand sides in (8.26) are equal to each other due to the hermiticity of A ; as
a consequence, .Am  An/ hvmjvni D 0. But An ¤ Am, so it is hvmjvni D 0.
8.4.2
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
When two eigenfunctions belonging to a degenerate eigenvalue are considered, the
reasoning that proves their orthogonality through (8.26) is not applicable because
An D Am. In fact, linearly independent eigenfunctions of an operator A belonging
to the same eigenvalue are not mutually orthogonal in general. However, it is
possible to form mutually orthogonal linear combinations of the eigenfunctions. As
shown by (8.24), such linear combinations are also eigenfunctions, so their norm is
different from zero. The procedure (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization) is described
here with reference to the case of the nth eigenfunction of a discrete spectrum, with
a degeneracy of order s. Let the non-orthogonal eigenfunctions be v.1/
n ; : : : ; v.s/
n ,
and let u.1/

As discussed in Sect. 8.2.1, the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation for a
free particle, for a given k D
p

are wCk D exp.i k x/ and wk D exp.i k x/. They may be written equivalently
as w.x; k/ D exp.i k x/, with k D ˙
p
2 m E=„. Taking the multiplicative constant
equal to 1=

the Fourier representation, one applies (C.16) and (C.17) to ﬁnd

f.x/ D
Z C1
1
c.k/ w.x; k/ dk ;
c.k/ D hwjfi :
(8.32)
In general the shorter notation wk.x/, ck is used instead of w.x; k/, c.k/. A set of
functions like wk.x/ that allows for the representation of f given by the ﬁrst relation
in (8.32) is said to be complete. Each member of the set is identiﬁed by the value
of the continuous parameter k ranging from 1 to C1. To each k it corresponds a
coefﬁcient of the expansion, whose value is given by the second relation in (8.32).
Expressions (8.31) and (8.32) hold true because they provide the Fourier
transform or antitransform of a function that fulﬁlls (C.19). On the other hand, wk.x/
is also the set of eigenfunctions of the free particle. In conclusion, the eigenfunctions
of the Schrödinger equation for a free particle form a complete set.
The same conclusion is readily found for the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger
equation for a particle in a box. To show this, one considers a function f.x/ deﬁned
in an interval Œ˛=2; C˛=2 and fulﬁlling
R C˛=2

orthonormal. Next, (8.37) shows that the set 	n, n, n D 0; 1; 2; : : : is complete in
Œ˛=2; C˛=2 with respect to any g for which the expansion is allowed. Letting

From the properties of the Fourier series it follows that the set of the n functions
alone is complete with respect to any function that is odd in Œ˛=2; C˛=2, hence
it is complete with respect to any function over the half interval Œ0; C˛=2. On the
other hand, letting a D ˛=2 and comparing with (8.8) show that n (apart from
the normalization coefﬁcient) is the eigenfunction of the Schrödinger equation for a
particle in a box. In conclusion, the set of eigenfunctions of this equation is complete
within Œ0; a.
One notes the striking resemblance of the ﬁrst relation in (8.38) with the vector-
algebra expression of a vector in terms of its components cm. The similarity is
completed by the second relation in (8.38), that provides each component as the
projection of g over wm. The latter plays the same role as the unit vector in algebra,
the difference being that the unit vectors here are functions and that their number is
inﬁnite. A further generalization of the same concept is given by (8.32), where the
summation index k is continuous.
Expansions like (8.32) or (8.38) hold because wk.x/ and wm.x/ are complete sets,
whose completeness is demonstrated in the theory of Fourier’s integral or series;
such a theory is readily extended to the three-dimensional case, showing that also the
three-dimensional counterparts of wk.x/ or wm.x/ form complete sets (in this case

the indices k or m are actually groups of indices, see, e.g., (9.5)). One may wonder
whether other complete sets of functions exist, different from those considered in
this section; the answer is positive: in fact, completeness is possessed by many other
sets of functions,9 and those of interest in Quantum Mechanics are made of the
eigenfunctions of equations like (8.23). A number of examples will be discussed
later.

while it must vanish for ˇ ¤ ˛ no matter how small the difference ˛  ˇ is. In

Hamiltonian Operator and Momentum Operator
As mentioned in Sect. 7.5, the form (7.44) of the time-independent Schrödinger

that is, a linear, real operator that gives (7.44) the form

classical expression H.p; q/ D E of a particle’s total energy in a conservative ﬁeld,
where H D T C V is the Hamiltonian function (Sect. 1.5). By this similarity, the

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
The units of T are those of an energy, hence „2 r2 has the units of a momentum
squared. One notes that to transform T into T one must replace each component of
momentum by a ﬁrst-order operator as follows:
pi ( Opi D i „ @
@xi
;
(8.48)
where Opi is called momentum operator. The correspondence (8.47) would still hold
if the minus sign in (8.48) were omitted. However, the minus sign is essential for a
correct description of the particle’s motion.11
From the results of Sect. 8.6.1 one ﬁnds that the momentum operator and
its three-dimensional form Op D i „ grad are Hermitean for square-integrable
functions. Their units are those of a momentum. The Hamiltonian operator (8.45)
is a real-coefﬁcient, linear combination of r2 and V; combining (8.22) with the
ﬁndings of Sect. 8.6 shows that (8.45) is Hermitean for square-integrable functions.
The one-dimensional form of the momentum operator yields the eigenvalue
equation
 i „ dv
dx D Qp v ;
(8.49)
where Qp has the units of a momentum. The solution of (8.49) is v D const 
exp.i Qp=„/, where Qp must be real to prevent the solution from diverging. Letting
const D 1=
p
2 , k D Qp=„ yields v D vk.x/ D exp.i k x/=
p
2 , showing
that the eigenfunctions of the momentum operator form a complete set (compare
with (8.31)) and are mutually orthogonal (compare with (8.43)). As jvk.x/j2 D
1=.2 /, the eigenfunctions are not square integrable; the spectrum is continuous
because the eigenvalue „ k can be any real number.

A real function V, depending on the spatial coordinates over the domain , and

operator. Such an operator is Hermitean12; in fact,
11Consider for instance the calculation of the expectation value of the momentum of a free particle

opposite to that of the propagation of the wave front associated with it.

The form of the right-hand side of (8.53) is due to (A.25). As f, g vanish over the

Another important example, still in the one-dimensional case, is that of the
operator d2=dx2. Integrating by parts twice shows that the operator is Hermitean. Its
three-dimensional generalization in Cartesian coordinates is r2. Using the second
Green theorem (A.25) and remembering that f, g vanish over the boundary provides
hgjr2fi D hr2gjfi, that is, r2 is Hermitean.

A Collection of Operators’ Deﬁnitions and Properties
A number of deﬁnitions and properties of operator algebra are illustrated in this
section. The identity operator I is such that I f D f for all f; the null operator
O is such that Of D 0 for all f. The product of two operators, A B, is an operator
whose action on a function is deﬁned as follows: s D A Bf is equivalent to g D Bf,
s D A g; in other terms, the operators A and B act in a speciﬁc order. In general,

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
It has been anticipated above that in general it is BA ¤ A B. Two operators
A , B are said to commute if
BA f D A Bf
(8.70)
for all f. The commutator of A , B is the operator C such that
i C f D .A B  BA / f
(8.71)
for all f. The deﬁnition (8.71) is such that if both A and B are Hermitean, then C is
Hermitean as well. The commutator of two commuting operators is the null operator.
A very important example of non-commuting operators is the pair q, i d=dq, where
q is any dynamic variable. One ﬁnds

namely, the commutator is in this case the identity operator I .
8.6.3
Examples of Commuting Operators
Operators that contain only spatial coordinates commute; similarly, operators that
contain only momentum operators commute. The operators A , B, C deﬁned
in (10.4) commute because they act on different coordinates; note that the deﬁnition
of A is such that it may contain both x and Opx D i „ @=@x, and so on.
As an example of operators containing only momentum operators one may
consider the Hamiltonian operator .„2=2 m/ r2 of a free particle discussed in
Sect. 8.2.1 and the momentum operator i „ r itself (Sect. 8.5). As for a free particle
they commute, a measurement of momentum is compatible in that case with a
measurement of energy. Considering a one-dimensional problem, the energy is
E D p2=.2 m/, where the modulus of momentum is given by p D „ k; for a
free particle, both energy and momentum are conserved. The eigenfunctions are
const  exp.˙i p x=„/ for both operators.
Remembering (8.72) one concludes that two operators do not commute if one of
them contains one coordinate q, and the other one contains the operator i „ @=@q
associated with the momentum conjugate to q.

Momentum and Energy of a Free Particle

the solution of (8.49) coincides with either one or the other of the two linearly
independent solutions of (8.1). This outcome is coherent with the conclusions
reached in Sect. 8.2.1 about the free particle’s motion. For a free particle whose
momentum is prescribed, the energy is purely kinetic and is prescribed as well,
whence the solution of (8.49) must be compatible with that of (8.1). However,
prescribing the momentum, both in modulus and direction, for a free particle,
provides the additional information that allows one to eliminate one of the two
summands from the linear combination (8.2) by setting either c1 or c2 to zero. For
a given eigenvalue Qp, (8.49) has only one solution (apart from the multiplicative
constant) because it is a ﬁrst-order equation; in contrast, for a given eigenvalue E, the
second-order equation (8.1) has two independent solution and its general solution is
a linear combination of them.
In a broader sense the momentum operator Opx D i „ d=dx is Hermitean also for
functions of the form vk.x/ D exp.i k x/=

Chapter 9
Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
9.1
Introduction
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is derived from the superposition princi-
ple, in the conservative case ﬁrst, then in the general case. The derivation of the
continuity equation follows, leading to the concept of wave packet and density
of probability ﬂux. Then, the wave packet for a free particle is investigated in
detail, and the concept of group velocity is introduced. The ﬁrst complement deals
with an application of the semiclassical approximation; through it one explains
why an electron belonging to a stationary state emits no power, namely, why the
radiative decay predicted by the classical model does not occur. The polar form
of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is then shown, that brings about an
interesting similarity with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of Classical Mechanics.
The last complement deals with the Hamiltonian operator of a particle subjected to
an electromagnetic ﬁeld and shows the effect of a gauge transformation on the wave
function.
9.2
Superposition Principle
Following de Broglie’s line of reasoning one associates the monochromatic wave
function w.r/ exp.i ! t/ with the motion of a particle with deﬁnite and constant
energy E D „ !. The analogy with the electromagnetic case then suggests that a
more general type of wave function—still related to the conservative case—can be
expressed as a superposition, that is, a linear combination with constant coefﬁcients,
of monochromatic wave functions. This possibility is one of the postulates of de
Broglie’s theory, and is referred to as Superposition Principle. To vest it with a

mathematical form one must distinguish among the different types of spectrum;
for the discrete spectrum, indicating with cn the complex coefﬁcients of the linear
combination, the general wave function reads
 .r; t/ D
X
n
cn wn exp.i !n t/ ;
(9.1)
with En, wn the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the time-independent Schrödinger
equation H wn D En wn, and !n D En=„. As usual, n stands for a single index or
a set of indices. The form of (9.1) is such that the spatial coordinates are separated
from the time coordinate; ﬁxing the latter by letting, say, t D 0, and remembering
that the set of eigenfunctions wn is complete, yield
 tD0 D  .r; 0/ D
X
n
cn wn ;
cn D hwnj tD0i :
(9.2)
The above shows that the coefﬁcients cn are uniquely determined by the initial
condition  tD0. On the other hand, once the coefﬁcients cn are known, the whole
time evolution of  is determined, because the angular frequencies appearing in the
time-dependent terms exp.i !n t/ are also known. In other terms,  is determined
by the initial condition and by the time-independent Hamiltonian operator whence
En, wn derive.
An important aspect of (9.1) is that it allows one to construct a wave function of
a given form; for such a construction, in fact, it sufﬁces to determine the coefﬁcients
by means of the second relation in (9.2). In particular it is possible to obtain a wave
function that is square integrable at all times, even if the eigenfunctions wn are
not square integrable themselves. Thanks to this property the wave function (9.1)
is localized in space at each instant of time, hence it is suitable for describing the
motion of the particle associated with it. Due to the analogy with the electromagnetic
case, where the interference of monochromatic waves provides the localization
of the ﬁeld’s intensity, a wave function of the form (9.1) is called wave packet.
Remembering that the wave function provides the probability density j j2 used
to identify the position of the particle, one can assume that the wave packet’s
normalization holds:

j j2 d3r D

jcnj2 D 1 ;
(9.3)
where the second equality derives from Parseval’s theorem (8.41). From (9.3) it
follows that the coefﬁcients are subjected to the constraint 0  jcnj2  1.
As all possible energies En appear in the expression (9.1) of  , the wave packet
does not describe a motion with a deﬁnite energy. Now, assume that an energy
measurement is carried out on the particle, and let t D tE be the instant at which
the measurement is completed. During the measurement the Hamiltonian operator
of (8.46) does not hold because the particle is interacting with the measuring

apparatus, hence the forces acting on it are different from those whence the
potential energy V of (8.45) derives. Instead, for t > tE the original Schrödinger
equation (8.46) is restored, so the expression of  is again given by a linear
combination of monochromatic waves; however, the coefﬁcients of the combination
are expected to be different from those that existed prior to the measurement, due to
the perturbation produced by the latter. In particular, the form of  for t > tE must be
compatible with the fact that the energy measurement has found a speciﬁc value of
the energy; this is possible only if the coefﬁcients are set to zero, with the exception
of the one corresponding to the energy that is the outcome of the measurement. The
latter must be one of the eigenvalues of (8.46) due to the compatibility requirement;
if it is, say, Em, then the form of the wave function for t > tE is
 .r; t/ D wm expŒi Em .t  tE/=„ ;
(9.4)
where the only nonvanishing coefﬁcient, cm, has provisionally been set to unity.
The reasoning leading to (9.4) can be interpreted as follows: the interaction with
the measuring apparatus ﬁlters out from (9.1) the term corresponding to Em; as a
consequence, the coefﬁcients cn whose values were previously set by the original  
are modiﬁed by the measurement and become cn D ınm when n ¤ m. If the ﬁltered
eigenfunction wm is square integrable, then (9.3) holds, whence P
n jcnj2 D jcmj2 D
1, cm D exp.i ˚/. As the constant phase ˚ does not carry any information, it can
be set to zero to yield cm D 1. If wm is not square integrable, the arbitrariness of the
multiplicative constant still allows one to set cm D 1.
As the energy measurement forces the particle to belong to a deﬁnite energy
state (in the example above, Em), for t > tE the particle’s wave function keeps
the monochromatic form (9.4). If, at a later time, a second energy measurement is
carried out, the only possible outcome is Em; as a consequence, after the second
measurement is completed, the form of the wave function is still (9.4), whence
jcmj2 D 1. One notes that the condition jcmj2 D 1 is associated with the certainty
that the outcome of the energy measurement is Em whereas, when the general
superposition (9.1) holds, the coefﬁcients fulﬁll the relations P
n jcnj2 D 1, 0 
jcnj2  1, and the measurement’s outcome may be any of the eigenvalues. It is
then sensible to interpret jcnj2 as the probability that a measurement of energy ﬁnds
the result En. This interpretation, that has been worked out here with reference to
energy, is extended to the other dynamic variables (Sect. 10.2).

The expression of  tD0 in (9.6) lends itself to providing an example of a wave
function that is square integrable, while the eigenfunctions that build up the super-
position are not. Consider, in fact, the relation (C.83) and let ck D  exp.2 k2=2/,

square-integrable function like the Gaussian one can be expressed as a combination
of the non-square-integrable spatial parts of the plane waves.
The extraction of the probabilities in the continuous-spectrum case accounts for
the fact that the E.k/ varies continuously with k. To this purpose one takes the
elementary volume d3k centered on some k and considers the product jckj2 d3k.
Such a product is given the meaning of inﬁnitesimal probability that the outcome of
an energy measurement belongs to the range of E.k/ values whose domain is d3k
(more comments are made in Sect. 9.7.1).

The second relation in (9.9) is a linear, homogeneous partial-differential equation,
of the second order with respect to the spatial coordinates and of the ﬁrst order with
respect to time, whose solution is the wave function  . It is called time-dependent
Schrödinger equation; as its coefﬁcients are complex, so is  . To solve the equation
it is necessary to prescribe the initial condition  .r; t D 0/ and the boundary
conditions. For the latter the same discussion as in Sect. 8.2 applies, because the
spatial behavior of  is prescribed by the Hamiltonian operator.

Continuity Equation and Norm Conservation
197
The reasoning leading to the second relation in (9.9) is based on the Superpo-
sition Principle, namely, once the form of  is given, the equation fulﬁlled by
 is readily extracted. Such a reasoning is not applicable in the nonconservative
cases, because the time-independent equation H wn D Enwn does not hold then,
so the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions upon which the superposition is based are
not available. However, another line of reasoning shows that the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation holds also for the nonconservative situations [86]. Although
in such cases the wave function  is not expressible as a superposition of
monochromatic waves, it can still be expanded using an orthonormal set. If the set

Remembering that the square modulus of the wave function provides the local-

equation (9.9). Here it is assumed that the wave function is normalized to unity and
that the Hamiltonian operator is real, H  D H D „2=.2 m/ r2CV; a case where
the operator is complex is examined in Sect. 9.5. Taking the time derivative of j j2

relation of (9.13) is imaginary.
Relations (9.13) provide a physical explanation of the continuity requirements
that were discussed from the mathematical standpoint in Sect. 8.2. Such require-
ments, namely, the continuity of the wave function and of its ﬁrst derivatives
in space, were introduced in Sect. 8.2 with reference to the solutions of the
time-independent Schrödinger equation; however, they hold also for the time-
dependent one because the spatial behavior of  is prescribed by the Hamiltonian
operator. Their physical explanation is that they provide the spatial continuity of
the probability density and of the probability-ﬂux density. Integrating (9.13) over a

at the left-hand side of (9.14) is the probability of localizing the particle within 0,
that at the right-hand side is the probability ﬂux across †0 in the outward direction;
as a consequence, the meaning of (9.14) is that the time variation of the localization
probability within 0 is the negative probability ﬂux across the surface. If 0 ! 1

It is worth noting that the transformation from the Hamiltonian function (9.18) to
the Hamiltonian operator (9.19) produced by replacing pi with Opi is limited to the
dynamics of the particle; the electromagnetic ﬁeld, instead, is still treated through
the scalar and vector potentials, and no transformation similar to that used for
the particle is carried out. The resulting Hamiltonian operator (9.19) must then be
considered as approximate; the term semiclassical approximation is in fact used to

classically whereas Quantum Mechanics is used in the description of the particle’s
dynamics. The procedure by which the quantum concepts are extended to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld is described in Sect. 12.3.
The semiclassical approximation is useful in several instances, among which
there is the calculation of the stationary states of atoms. As shown in Sect. 9.7.2,
it explains why the radiative decay predicted in Sect. 5.11.3 using the classical
(planetary) model does not actually occur.

As 1 < ki < C1, here the order of degeneracy of Ek is inﬁnite. Now, remem-
bering that the wave packet is normalized to unity, it follows that j .r; t/j2 d3r is
the inﬁnitesimal probability that at time t the particle is localized within d3r ; also,
from the analysis carried out in Sect. 9.2, the product jckj2 d3k is the inﬁnitesimal
probability that the outcome of an energy measurement belongs to the range of E.k/
values whose domain is d3k. Note that ck does not depend on time.
Considering the example of a Gaussian wave packet given at the end of Sect. 9.2,
one can assume that j .r; t/j2 is localized in the r space and jckj2 is localized in
the k space. This means that j .r; t/j2 and jckj2 become vanishingly small when
r departs from its average value r0.t/ and respectively, k departs from its average
value k0. Such average values are given by2

About the Units of the Wave Function
Consider the wave function  associated with a single particle. When the wave
function is square integrable and normalized to unity, its units are Œ  D m3=2 due
to
R
j j2 d3r D 1 . Then, if the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are discrete,
the second equality in (9.3) shows that jcnj2, cn are dimensionless and, ﬁnally, (9.2)
shows that wn has the same units as  . If the eigenvalues are continuous, the second
equality in (9.7) shows that jckj2 has the dimensions of a volume of the real space,
so that Œck D m3=2 and, ﬁnally, (9.6) shows that wk has the same units as  .
There are situations, however, where units different from those illustrated above
are ascribed to the eigenfunctions. One example is that of the eigenfunctions of the
form wk D exp.i kr/=.2 /3=2, worked out in Sect. 8.2.1, which are dimensionless;
another example is that of eigenfunctions of the form (10.7), whose units are
Œı.r  r0/ D m3. When such eigenfunctions occur, the units of the expansion’s
coefﬁcients must be modiﬁed in order to keep the correct units of  (compare with
the calculation shown in Sect. 14.6).

Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
The considerations carried out here apply to the single-particle case. When
the wave function describes a system of two or more particles, its units change
accordingly (Sect. 15.2).
9.7.2
An Application of the Semiclassical Approximation
As indicated in Sect. 9.5 for the case of a particle subjected to an electromagnetic
ﬁeld, the semiclassical approximation consists in using the Hamiltonian opera-
tor (9.19), which is derived from the Hamiltonian function (9.18) by replacing pi
with Opi. The electromagnetic ﬁeld, instead, is still treated through the scalar and
vector potentials. Experiments show that the approximation is applicable in several
cases of interest. For instance, consider again the problem of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld generated by a single electron, discussed in classical terms in Sect. 5.11.2.
If  is the wave function (assumed to be square integrable) associated with the
electron in the quantum description, the electron’s localization is given by j j2. It
is then sensible to describe the charge density and the current density produced by
the electron as
% D q j j2 ;
J D q J ;
(9.27)
where q is the elementary charge and J is deﬁned in (9.13). If the electron is in a
stationary state, namely,  .r; t/ D w.r/ exp.i ! t/, then % and J are independent
of time. From (4.58, 4.59) it follows that the potentials ', A are independent of time
as well. As a consequence, the distribution of charge and current density associated
with the electron’s motion is stationary (compare with (9.17)), which also yields
that the acceleration Pu vanishes. From Larmor’s formula (5.72) one ﬁnally ﬁnds that
in this situation the electron emits no power; thus, the radiative decay predicted in
Sect. 5.11.3 using the classical model does not occur.
9.7.3
Polar Form of the Schrödinger Equation
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (9.9) is easily split into two real equations
by considering the real and imaginary part of  . However, in this section the wave
function will rather be written in polar form,  D ˛.r; t/ expŒi ˇ.r; t/, ˛  0,
which reminds one of that used to derive the eikonal equation (5.51) of Geometrical
Optics. Despite the fact that the resulting relations are nonlinear, the outcome of
this procedure is interesting. Considering a Hamiltonian operator of the type H D
„2 r2=.2 m/ C V, replacing the polar expression of  in (9.9), and separating the
real and imaginary parts yield two coupled, real equations; the ﬁrst of them reads

The two differential equations (9.31), whose unknowns are ˛, ˇ, are coupled with

Classical Mechanics, and becomes equal to it in the limit „ ! 0, that makes Q to

the deﬁnition of dispersion around the average: the analogy with the treatment used
in statistical mechanics (compare with (19.79)) suggests that p2

analogue of the convective part of the kinetic energy, while Q provides the analogue

It is interesting to note that the analogy between the Schrödinger equation and a
set of a continuity and a Hamilton-Jacobi-like equations had been observed by de
Broglie, who introduced the concept of pilot wave in [34]. This cost him severe
criticism by Pauli at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927. He resumed the idea
more than 20 years later, stimulated by the papers by Bohm introducing the concept
of quantum potential, see, e.g., [14]. The most recent paper by de Broglie on the
subject is [35], published when the author was 79 years old.

Also in the quantum case it turns out that the Hamiltonian operator is not gauge

General Methods of Quantum Mechanics
10.1
Introduction
The preceding chapters have provided the introductory information about Quantum
Mechanics. Here the general principles of the theory are illustrated, and the methods
worked out for the Hamiltonian operator are extended to the operators associated
with dynamic variables different from energy. The important concept of separable
operator is introduced, and the property of some operators to commute with each
other is related to the mutual compatibility of measurements of the corresponding
dynamic variables. Then, the concepts of expectation value and uncertainty are
introduced, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is worked out. This leads in
turn to the analysis of the time derivative of the expectation values, showing that
the latter fulﬁll relations identical to those of Classical Mechanics. The form of the
minimum-uncertainty wave packet is worked out in the complements.
10.2
General Methods
The discussion carried out in Sect. 9.2 has led to a number of conclusions regarding
the eigenvalues of the time-independent Schrödinger equation (7.44). They are:
•
The energy of a particle subjected to a conservative force is one of the eigenvalues
of the time-independent equation H w D Ew, where H is derived from the
corresponding Hamiltonian function by replacing pi with i „ @=@xi. Any other
energy different from an eigenvalue is forbidden.
•
The wave function of a conservative case (taking by way of example the discrete-
eigenvalue case) is  D P

given by j j2, where it is assumed that  is normalized to unity. The probability

General Methods of Quantum Mechanics
that a measurement of energy ﬁnds the eigenvalue Em is jcmj2; an energy
measurement that ﬁnds the eigenvalues Em forces cn to become ınm.
•
The time evolution of  is found by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation i „ @ =@t
D
H  . The latter holds also in the nonconservative
situations; although in such cases the wave function  is not expressible as
a superposition of monochromatic waves, it can still be expanded using an
orthonormal set like in (9.10) or (9.11).
An important issue is now extending the conclusions listed above to the dynamic
quantities different from energy (e.g., momentum, angular momentum, and so on).
The extension is achieved by analogy, namely, it is assumed that for any dynamic
variable one can construct an eigenvalue equation whose solution provides the
possible values of the variable itself. This line of reasoning yields the procedures
listed below, that are called general methods of Quantum Mechanics:
1. Given a dynamic variable A, an operator A is associated with it. It is found,
ﬁrst, by expressing A in terms of canonical coordinates qi; pi (Sect. 1.6), then, by
replacing the momentum’s components pi with Opi D i „ @=@qi in such a way
that A is Hermitean.
2. It is checked whether the eigenvalue equation A v D Av possesses a complete,
orthonormal set of eigenfunction. If the check fails, the operator is not con-
sidered; otherwise it is accepted and is called observable [96, Chap. V.9]. The
eigenvalue equation is subjected to the same boundary or asymptotic conditions
as H w D Ew.
3. Let An or Aˇ be the eigenvalues of A v D Av, with n (ˇ) a set of discrete
(continuous) indices. Such eigenvalues are the only values that a measure of the
dynamic variable A can ﬁnd.
4. Thanks to completeness, the wave function  describing the particle’s localiza-
tion can be written, respectively for discrete or continuous spectra,

with an D hvnj i, aˇ D hvˇj i.
5. If the wave function in (10.1) is normalizable, then P
n janj2 D 1,
R
ˇ jaˇj2 dˇ D
1 at all times. For a discrete spectrum, Pn D jan.tA/j2 is the probability that a
measurement of A ﬁnds the eigenvalue An at t D tA. For a continuous spectrum,
the inﬁnitesimal probability that at t D tA the domain of Aˇ is found in the
interval dˇ around ˇ is dP D jaˇ.tA/j2 dˇ.
6. When the measurement is carried out at t D tA and an eigenvalue, say, Am,
is found, the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst expansion in (10.1) are forced by the
measurement to become jan.tC
A /j2 D ımn, and the wave function at that instant1
1Measurements are not instantaneous (refer to the discussion in Sect. 9.2). Here it is assumed that
the duration of a measurement is much shorter than the time scale of the whole experiment.

becomes  .r; tC
A / D vm.r/. The time evolution of  starting from tC
A is
prescribed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation i „ @ =@t D H  , with
 .r; tC
A / as the initial condition. In this respect there is a neat parallel with
Classical Mechanics, where the time evolution of the canonical variables starting
from the initial conditions is prescribed by the Hamilton equations (1.42).
According to the general methods listed above, the eigenvalues of A are the only
possible outcome of a measurement of the dynamic variable A. As the eigenvalues
represent a physical quantity, they must be real; this makes the requirement that
A must be Hermitean easily understood: if an operator is Hermitean, then its
eigenvalues are real (Sect. 8.4.1). The inverse is also true: if the eigenfunctions of
A form a complete set and its eigenvalues are real, then A is Hermitean. In fact,
for any pair of functions f, g, considering the discrete spectrum by way of example,
one has

(10.2)
which holds for all f, g because the eigenfunctions vn are mutually orthogonal and
the eigenvalues An are real.
As indicated at 1 point above, the dynamic variable A is transformed into the
operator A by replacing pi with Opi. The operator obtained from such a replacement
is not necessarily Hermitean: its hermiticity must be checked on a case-by-case
basis. For instance, the dynamic variable A D x px can be written in equivalent ways
as x px, px x, and .x px C px x/=2. However, their quantum counterparts

Let A be an operator acting only on the x coordinate. Similarly, let B and C the
two operators acting only on y and z, respectively. The eigenvalue equations for the

combination of the above operators, with a, b, c constant vectors, it is
.a A C b B C c C / uk vm wn D .a Ak C b Bm C c Cn/ uk vm wn ;
(10.6)
that is, uk vm wn is an eigenfunction corresponding to eigenvalue a AkCb BmCc Cn. It
is important to add that in (10.4) it is implied that the boundary conditions of A uk D
Ak uk depend on x alone, those of Bvm D Bm vm on y alone, and the like for the
third equation. In other terms, separability means that at least one set of coordinates
exists, such that both the equation and boundary conditions are separable.
As a ﬁrst example of application of (10.6), consider the classical position of
a particle, r D x1 i1 C x2 i2 C x3 i3. Such a dynamic variable does not contain
the components of momentum; as a consequence, the operator associated with it
is r itself, and generates the eigenvalue equation r g.r/ D r0 g.r/. Separating the
latter and considering the eigenvalue equation for xi, one ﬁnds xi vi.xi/ D xi0 vi.xi/,
namely, .xi  xi0/ vi.xi/ D 0 for all xi ¤ xi0. It follows vi D ı.xi  xi0/, whence

Neither (10.7) nor F (10.9) are square integrable. The indices of the eigenvalues
(r0 in (10.8) and k in (10.9)) are continuous in both cases. Also, from the results
of Sects. C.2 and C.5 one ﬁnds that gr0.r/ D g.r; r0/ is the Fourier transform of
fk.r/ D f.r; k/.
10.4
Eigenfunctions of Commuting Operators
It has been shown in Sect. 10.2 that a measurement of the dynamic variable A at
time tA yields one of the eigenvalues of the equation A a D A a. Considering
for instance a discrete spectrum, let the eigenvalue be Am. The initial condition
 .r; tC
A / for the time evolution of the particle’s wave function after the measurement
is one of the eigenfunctions of A corresponding to Am. If a measurement of another
dynamic variable B is carried out at a later time tB, the wave function at t D tB
is forced to become one of the eigenfunctions of Bb D B b, say, bk. The latter
can in turn be expanded in terms of the complete set derived from A , namely,
bk D P
nhanjbki an. As the coefﬁcients of the expansion are in general different
from zero, there is a ﬁnite probability that a new measurement of A at tC > tB
ﬁnds a value different from Am. In principle this could be due to the fact that if A
is not conserved, its value has evolved, from the outcome Am of the measurement
carried out at t D tA, into something different, as prescribed by the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation having  .r; tC
A / as initial condition.2 However, the instant
tB of the second measurement can in principle be brought as close to tA as we
please, so that the two measurements can be thought of as simultaneous. As a
consequence, the loss of information about the value of A must be ascribed to the
second measurement, speciﬁcally, to its interference with the wave function, rather
than to a natural evolution3 of the value of A: the gain in information about the
eigenvalue of B produces a loss of information about that of A; for this reason, the
two measurements are said to be incompatible.
From the discussion above one also draws the conclusion that if it were bk D am,
the two measurements of outcome Am and Bk would be compatible. This is in itself
insufﬁcient for stating that the measurements of A and B are compatible in all cases;
for this to happen it is necessary that the whole set of eigenfunctions of A coincides
with that of B: in this case, in fact, the condition bk D am is fulﬁlled no matter what
the outcome of the two measurements is.
It would be inconvenient to check the eigenfunctions to ascertain whether two
observables A, B are compatible or not. In fact, this is not necessary thanks to the
following property: if two operators A and B have a common, complete set of
2By way of example one may think of A as the position x, that typically evolves in time from the
original value xA D x.tA/ even if the particle is not perturbed.
3In any case, the evolution would be predicted exactly by the Schrödinger equation. Besides, the
eigenvalue would not change if A were conserved.

eigenfunctions, then they commute, and vice versa (as indicated in Sect. 8.6.2, two
operators commute if their commutator (8.71) is the null operator). Still assuming
a discrete spectrum, for any eigenfunction vn it is A Bvn D A Bn vn D BnA vn D
Bn An vn. Similarly, BA vn D BAn vn D AnBvn D An Bn vn, showing that A and
B commute for all eigenfunctions. Then, using the completeness of the common
set vn to expand any function f as f D P
n fn vn, one ﬁnds
A Bf D

(10.10)
This proves that if two operators have a complete set of eigenfunctions in common,
then they commute. Conversely, assume that A and B commute and let vn be an
eigenfunction of A ; then, A Bvn D BA vn and A vn D An vn. Combining the
latter relations yields A Bvn D BAn vn which, letting gn D Bvn, is recast as
A gn D Angn. In conclusion, both vn and gn are eigenfunctions of A belonging to
the same eigenvalue An.
If An is not degenerate, the eigenfunctions vn and gn must be the same function,
apart from a multiplicative constant due to the homogeneity of the eigenvalue
equation. Let such a constant be Bn; combining gn D Bn vn with the deﬁnition
gn D Bvn yields Bvn D Bn vn, thus showing that vn is an eigenfunction of B as
well. The property holds also when An is degenerate, although the proof is somewhat
more involved [95, Chap. 8-5]. This proves that if two operators commute, then they
have a complete set of eigenfunctions in common. Examples are given in Sect. 8.6.3.
10.5
Expectation Value and Uncertainty
The discussion carried out in Sect. 10.2 has led to the conclusion that the wave
function  describing the particle’s localization can be expanded as in (10.1),
where vn or vˇ are the eigenfunctions of an Hermitean operator A that form a
complete, orthonormal set. Considering a discrete spectrum ﬁrst, the coefﬁcients of
the expansion are an D hvnj i; assuming that the wave function is normalizable, it
is P
n janj2 D 1.
The meaning of the coefﬁcients is that Pn D jan.t/j2 is the probability that a
measurement of A ﬁnds the eigenvalue An at time t. From this it follows that the
statistical average of the eigenvalues is
hAi.t/ D
X
n
Pn An :
(10.11)
The average (10.11) is called expectation value.4 It can be given a different form by
observing that Pn D a

m ımn/ an and that, due to the orthonormality of
the eigenfunctions of A , it is ımn D hvmjvni; then,
4If the wave function is normalized to a number different from unity, the deﬁnition of the
expectation value is P
n Pn An= P
n Pn, and the other deﬁnitions are modiﬁed accordingly.

term used to indicate the positive square root of the variance, A D

is standard deviation. When it is used with reference to the statistical properties of
the eigenvalues, the standard deviation is called uncertainty.
Assume by way of example that the wave function at t D tA coincides with one
of the eigenfunctions of A . With reference to a discrete spectrum (ﬁrst relation
in (10.1)), let  .tA/ D vm. From (10.13) and (10.17) it then follows hAi.tA/ D
Am, A.tA/ D 0. The standard deviation of the eigenvalues is zero in this case,
because the measurement of A can only ﬁnd the eigenvalue Am. As a second example
consider a continuous spectrum in one dimension, and let  .tA/ D exp.i k x/=

namely, an eigenfunction of the momentum operator. In this case the wave function
is not square integrable, so one must calculate the expectation value as

If one lets A D Op D i „ d=dx, the result is hpi.tA/ D „ k, p.tA/ D 0. In fact, like
in the previous example, the wave function coincides with one of the eigenfunctions
of the operator. If, however, one applies another operator to the same wave function,
its variance does not necessarily vanish. A remarkable outcome stems from applying
Ox D x, that is, the operator associated with the dynamic variable canonically
conjugate to p: one ﬁnds hxi.tA/ D 0, x.tA/ D 1.
In conclusion, the examples above show that the term “uncertainty” does not
refer to an insufﬁcient precision of the measurements (which in principle can be
made as precise as we please), but to the range of eigenvalues that is covered by the
form of  .tA/. In the last example above all positions x are equally probable because
j .tA/j2 D const, whence the standard deviation of position diverges.
10.6
Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation
Consider the wave function  describing the dynamics of a particle, and let A
and B be Hermitean operators. A relation exists between the standard deviations
of these operators, calculated with the same wave function. Deﬁning the complex
functions f D .A  hAi/  and g D .B  hBi/  yields
jjfjj2 D .A/2 ;
jjgjj2 D .B/2 ;
hfjgi  hgjfi D i hCi ;
(10.19)
where the ﬁrst two relations derive from (10.17) while hCi in the third one is the
expectation value of the commutator C D i .A B  BA /. Letting  D i 
in (8.16), with  real, and using (10.19) provides
.A/2 C 2 .B/2   hCi  0 ;
(10.20)
namely, a second-degree polynomial in the real parameter . In turn, the coefﬁcients
of the polynomial are real because they derive from Hermitean operators. For the
polynomial to be nonnegative for all , the discriminant hCi2 4 .A/2 .B/2 must
be non-positive. The relation between the standard deviations then reads
A B  1
2 jhCij :
(10.21)
The interpretation of this result follows from the discussion carried out at the end of
Sect. 10.5. If A and B commute, then their commutator is the null operator, whose
eigenvalue is zero. As a consequence it is A B  0, namely, the minimum of the
product is zero. Remembering the result of Sect. 10.4, when two operators commute

they have a common, complete set of eigenfunctions. If the wave function used for
calculating the variance (10.17) is an eigenfunction of A and B, then both standard
deviations A and B vanish and A B D 0, namely, the minimum can in fact be
attained. If, instead, A and B do not commute, the minimum of the product A B
must be calculated on a case-by-case basis. The most interesting outcome is found
when the two operators are associated with conjugate dynamic variables: A D qi
and B D i „ @=@qi. Remembering (8.72) one ﬁnds C D „ I , C D „, hCi D „,

(10.22)
Inequality (10.22) is also called Heisenberg principle or uncertainty principle,
because it was originally deduced by Heisenberg from heuristic arguments [63].5
The more formal deduction leading to (10.21) was given shortly after in
[77]
and [144].
10.7
Time Derivative of the Expectation Value
The expectation value (10.11) of a Hermitean operator is a real function of time. In
Classical Mechanics, the generalized coordinates and momenta are also functions
of time, whose evolution is given by the Hamilton equations (1.42); the latter
express the time derivatives of coordinates and momenta in terms of the Hamiltonian
function. Then, for an arbitrary function % of the canonical coordinates, the total
derivative with respect of time is expressed through the Poisson bracket as in (1.53).
A relation of the same form as (1.53) is found in Quantum Mechanics by calculating
the time derivative of the expectation value (10.13). It is assumed that operator A
depends on time, but does not operate on it; as a consequence, the symbol @A =@t
indicates the operator resulting from differentiating A with respect to its functional
dependence on t. With these premises one ﬁnds

of motion.
10.8
Ehrenfest Theorem
An important application of (10.27) is found by replacing A with either a position
operator or a momentum operator. The calculation is shown here with reference to
the Hamiltonian operator H D „2=.2 m/r2 C V, where the potential energy V is
independent of time. Letting ﬁrst A D x yields

Minimum-Uncertainty Wave Function
It has been shown in Sect. 10.6 that when the two operators are associated with
conjugate dynamic variables, A D q and B D i „ d=dq, the relation between
their standard deviations is given by (10.22). It is interesting to seek a form of
the wave function such that the equality A B D „=2 holds. If it exists, such
a form is called minimum-uncertainty wave function. To proceed one notes that the
equality yields the value m D .jhCij=2/=.B/2 corresponding to the minimum
of the polynomial (10.20); moreover, such a minimum is zero. On the other hand,
imposing the equality in (8.16) after letting  D i m yields the more compact form

Applications of the Schrödinger Equation

Chapter 11
Elementary Cases
11.1
Introduction
The time-independent Schrödinger equation is a linear, second-order equation with
a coefﬁcient that depends on position. An analytical solution can be found in a
limited number of cases, typically one-dimensional ones. This chapter illustrates
some of these cases, starting from the step-like potential energy followed by the
potential-energy barrier. In both of them, the coefﬁcient of the Schrödinger equation
is approximated with a piecewise-constant function. Despite their simplicity, the
step and barrier potential proﬁles show that the quantum-mechanical treatment may
lead to results that differ substantially from the classical ones: a ﬁnite probability of
transmission may be found where the classical treatment would lead to a reﬂection
only, or vice versa. The transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients are deﬁned by
considering a plane wave launched towards the step or barrier. It is shown that
the deﬁnition of the two coefﬁcients can be given also for a barrier of a general
form, basing on the formal properties of the second-order linear equations in one
dimension. Finally, the case of a ﬁnite well is tackled, showing that in the limit of an
inﬁnite depth of the well one recovers the results of the particle in a box illustrated
in a preceding chapter.
11.2
Step-Like Potential Energy
Consider a one-dimensional, step-like potential energy as shown in Fig. 11.1, with
V D 0 for x < 0 and V D V0 > 0 for x > 0. From the general properties of the
time-independent Schrödinger equation (Sect. 8.2.3) it follows E  0. To proceed,
it is convenient to consider the two cases 0 < E < V0 and E > V0 separately.

Step-Like Potential Energy

The eigenvalues E are continuous in the range 0  E < V0. The monochromatic
wave function corresponding to wk is  k.x; t/ D w.x/ exp.iEk t=„/, with Ek D
„2 k2=.2 m/.
The quantity R D ja2=a1j2 is called reﬂection coefﬁcient of the monochromatic
wave. As shown in Sect. 11.4 from a more general point of view, R is the probability
that the wave is reﬂected by the step. In the case investigated here, where a particle
with 0 < E < V0 is launched towards a step, it is a2=a1 D exp.i '/ whence R D 1.
The solution (11.3) or (11.5) shows that w becomes vanishingly small on the right
of the origin as x ! C1. When a wave packet is built up using a superposition of
monochromatic solutions, chosen in such a way that each energy Ek is smaller than
V0, its behavior is similar; as a consequence, the probability of ﬁnding the particle
on the right of the origin becomes smaller and smaller as the distance from the origin
increases. In conclusion, if a particle described by such a packet is launched from
x < 0 towards the step, the only possible outcome is the same as in a calculation
based on Classical Mechanics, namely, a reﬂection. A difference between the
classical and quantum treatment exists though: in the former the reﬂection occurs
at x D 0, whereas in the latter the reﬂection abscissa is not deﬁned. This is better
understood by considering a wave packet of standard deviation x approaching the
origin from x < 0. Considering the approximate form of the packet described in
Sect. 9.6, the incident envelope has the form Ai D A.x  u t/, and the localization
of the incident particle is described by j ij2 D jAij2. Due to its ﬁnite width, the
packet crosses the origin during a time t  x=u starting, e.g., at t D 0. At a later
instant t C t0, where t0  0 is the time that the wave packet takes to move away
from the step to the extent that the interaction with it is practically completed, only
the reﬂected packet exists, described by j rj2 D jArj2, with Ar D AŒx C u .t  t0/.
For 0  t  t C t0 both incident and reﬂected packets exist. One could think
that the reﬂection abscissa is given by the product u t0; however, t0 depends on
the form of the packet, so the reﬂection abscissa is not well deﬁned. Before the
particle starts interacting with the step, only the incident packet exists and the
normalization
R 0
1 j ij2 dx D 1 holds; similarly, after the interaction is completed,
only the reﬂected packet exists and
R 0
1 j rj2 dx D 1. For 0  t  t C t0 the
normalization is achieved by a superposition of the incident and reﬂected packets.
11.2.2
Case B: E > V0

(11.7)
Remembering the discussion of Sect. 9.6, function w in (11.7) describes a superpo-
sition of two planar and monochromatic waves, belonging to the x < 0 region, that
propagate in the forward and backward direction, respectively; a similar meaning
holds for wC with reference to the x > 0 region. Now one assumes that an extra
information is available, namely, that the particle was originally launched from
x < 0 towards the origin; it follows that one must set a4 D 0, because a wave
that propagates in the backward direction cannot exist in the region x > 0. By the
same token one should set a1 D 0 if the particle was launched from x > 0 towards
the origin. From the continuity of w and w0 in the origin it follows

that k > k1 > 0, namely, the modulus of the particle’s momentum in the x > 0
region is smaller than in the x < 0 region; this is similar to what happens in the
classical treatment. On the other hand, from k > k1 it follows a2 ¤ 0, showing that
a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the backward direction exists in the
x < 0 region. In other term, a ﬁnite probability of reﬂexion is present, which would
be impossible in the classical treatment. As before, the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the
monochromatic wave is deﬁned as R D ja2=a1j2 < 1. In turn, the transmission
coefﬁcient is deﬁned as T D 1  R whence, from (11.9),

Like in the 0 < E < V0 case one may build up a wave packet of standard

envelope has the form Ai D A.x  u t/. Before the particle starts interacting with
the step, its localization is given by j ij2 D jAij2. The packet crosses the origin in a
time t  x=u and, using the symbols k0, k10 to indicate the center of the packet
in the momentum space for x < 0 and x > 0, respectively, from the ﬁrst of (11.11)
the reﬂected packet is described by
j rj2 D .k0  k10/2
.k0 C k10/2 jA.x C u t/j2 :
(11.12)
It has the same group velocity, hence the same width, as j ij2. The transmitted
packet has the form
j tj2 D

.k0 C k10/2 jA.k0 x=k10  u t/j2 ;
(11.13)
and its group velocity is u1 D dx=dt D k10 u=k0 < u. As all packets cross
the origin in the same time interval t it follows x=u D x1=u1 whence
x1 D .k10=k0/ x < x. This result shows that the transmitted packet is slower
and narrower than the incident packet (if the incident packet was launched from
x > 0 towards the origin, the transmitted packet would be faster and broader). From

The two numbers Pr, Pt fulﬁll the relations 0 < Pr; Pt < 1 , Pr CPt D 1, and are the
reﬂection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet. The treatment outlined
above for the case E > V0 still holds when V0 < 0, E > 0. In particular, if V0 < 0
and jV0j  E, like in Fig. 11.2, from (11.16) it turns out Pr ' 1. This result is quite
different from that obtained from a calculation based on Classical Mechanics; in
fact, its features are similar to those of the propagation of light across the interface
between two media of different refraction index [15, Sects. 1.5,1.6]. The oddity of
the result lies, instead, in the fact that term

potential energy makes it impossible to apply the Ehrenfest approximation (10.33)

no matter what the value of the mass is. The same happens for the monochromatic
wave: in fact, using (11.6) and replacing E0 with E in (11.16) makes the latter equal
to (11.11). To recover the classical result it is necessary to consider a potential
energy whose asymptotic values 0 and V0 are connected by a smooth function, and
solve the corresponding Schrödinger equation. The classical case is then recovered
by letting m increase (Prob. 11.1).
11.3
Energy Barrier
Consider a one-dimensional energy barrier as shown in Fig. 11.3, with V D V0 > 0
for 0 < x < s and V D 0 elsewhere. From the general properties of the time-
independent Schrödinger equation (Sect. 8.2.3) it follows E  0. To proceed, it is
convenient to consider the two cases 0 < E < V0 and E > V0 separately.

Solving for a1, a2 and letting # D 1 C i ˛=k yields 2 a1 D # a4 C # a3, 2 a2 D
# a3 C # a4. Using the same reasoning as in Sect. 11.2.2, one now assumes that an
extra information is available, namely, that the particle was originally launched from
x < 0 towards the barrier; it follows that one must set a6 D 0 in (11.18), because
a wave that propagates in the backward direction cannot exist in the region x > s.
By the same token one should set a1 D 0 if the particle were launched from x > s
towards the barrier. Taking the ﬁrst case (a6 D 0) and using the continuity of w and
w0 at x D s provides

whence 2 a3 D a5  exp.i k s  ˛ s/, 2 a4 D a5  exp.i k s C ˛ s/, with  D
1 C i k=˛. In summary, a1, a2 are linear combinations of a3, a4; the latter, in
turn, are proportional to a5. It follows that if it were a5 D 0, then it would also
be a3 D a4 D 0 and a1 D a2 D 0. However, this is impossible because w
cannot vanish identically; as a consequence it is necessarily a5 ¤ 0. This shows
that wC D a5 exp.i k x/ differs from zero, namely, that a wave propagating in the
forward direction exists for x > s.
As the relations involving the coefﬁcients ai are homogeneous, they determine
a2, a3, a4, a5 apart from the arbitrary constant a1. This should be expected as w
is not normalizable. As shown below, the determination of the ratios between the
coefﬁcient does not impose any constraint on the total energy; as a consequence, the
eigenvalues 0  E < V0 are continuous. The ratio a5=a1 is found from

Elementary Cases
In the classical treatment, if a particle with 0 < E < V0 is launched from the left
towards the barrier, it is reﬂected at x D 0; similarly, it is reﬂected at x D s if it
is launched from the right. In the quantum treatment it is T > 0: in contrast to the
classical case, the particle can cross the barrier. For a given width s of the barrier
and total energy E of the particle, the transmission coefﬁcient T decreases when
V0 increases; for E and V0 ﬁxed, T becomes proportional to exp.2˛s/ when s
increases to the extent that ˛ s  1. Finally, T ! 1 as s ! 0; this was expected
because the potential energy becomes equal to zero everywhere.1
The interaction of the particle with the barrier is better understood by considering
a wave packet approaching the origin from x < 0. The incident envelope has
the form Ai D A.x  u t/. Before reaching the origin the particle’s localization
is described by j ij2 D jAij2. After the interaction with the barrier is completed,
both the reﬂected and transmitted packet exist, that move in opposite directions
with the same velocity. Letting Pr D

that
R 0

0 < Pr; Pt < 1, Pr C Pt D 1, and are the reﬂection and transmission probabilities
of the wave packet. In summary, the solution of the Schrödinger equation for the
energy barrier shows that a particle with 0 < E < V0 has a ﬁnite probability of
crossing the barrier, which would be impossible in the classical treatment. The same
result holds when the form of the barrier is more complicate than the rectangular one
(Sect. 11.4). The phenomenon is also called tunnel effect.

would yield the case discussed in Sect. 11.2 (compare also with Sects. 11.4 and 17.9.4).

In the classical treatment, if a particle with 0 < V0 < E is launched towards the
barrier, it is always transmitted. In the quantum treatment it may be R > 0: in
contrast to the classical case, the particle can be reﬂected.2 The barrier is transparent
(R D 0) for k1 s D i , with i any integer. Letting 1 D 2 =k1 yields s D i 1=2,
which is equivalent to the optical-resonance condition in a sequence of media of
refractive indices n1, n2, n1 [15, Sect. 1.6].
2The reﬂection at the barrier for k1 s ¤ i  explains why the experimental value of the Richardson
constant A is lower than the theoretical one. Such a constant appears in the expression Js D
A T2 expŒEW=.kB T/ of the vacuum-tube characteristics [31]. This is one of the cases where the
effect is evidenced in macroscopic-scale experiments. Still considering the vacuum tubes, another
experimental evidence of the tunnel effect is the lack of saturation of the forward current-voltage
characteristic at increasing bias.

Elementary Cases
11.4
Energy Barrier of a General Form
The interaction of a particle with an energy barrier has been discussed in Sect. 11.3
with reference to the simple case of Fig. 11.3. Here it is extended to the case of a
barrier of a general form—still considering the one-dimensional, time-independent
Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass m, to the purpose of calculating the
transmission coefﬁcient T. The equation reads
d2w
dx2 C q w D 0 ;
q.x/ D 2 m
„2 .E  V/ ;
(11.28)
where the potential energy V.x/ is deﬁned as follows:
V D VL D const. ;
x < 0 I
V D VR D const. ;
0 < s < x :
(11.29)
In the interval 0  x  s the potential energy is left unspeciﬁed, with the only
provision that its form is such that (11.28) is solvable. It will also be assumed that
E > VL; VR; as a consequence, the total energy is not quantized and all values of E
larger than VL and VR are allowed. For a given E the time-dependent wave function
takes the form  .x; t/ D w.x/ exp.i E t=„/, where
w.x/ D a1 exp.i kL x/ C a2 exp.i kL x/ ;
x < 0 ;
(11.30)

The real parameters kL; kR > 0 are given by kL D
p
2 m .E  VL/=„ and, respec-
tively, kR D
p
2 m .E  VR/=„. Like in the examples of Sect. 11.3 it is assumed
that the particle is launched from 1, so that the plane wave corresponding to the
term multiplied by a6 in (11.31) does not exist. As a consequence one lets a6 D 0,
whereas a1, a2, a5 are left undetermined. In the interval 0  x  s the general
solution of (11.28) is
w.x/ D a3 u.x/ C a4 v.x/ ;
0  x  s ;
(11.32)
where u, v are two linearly independent solutions. The continuity equation for the
wave function (9.13), becomes in this case dJ =dx D 0, namely, J D const. In

Given E, VL, VR, and a1, the transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients depend on the
form of the potential energy in the interval 0  x  s. By way of example, if
VL D 0 and the potential energy in the interval 0  x  s is equal to some constant
VB  0, then R is expected to vary from 0 to 1 as VB varies from 0 to C1. On
the other hand, R and T cannot vary independently from each other because of the
relation R C T D 1. As a consequence, it sufﬁces to consider only one coefﬁcient,
say, T. From the discussion above it follows that the coefﬁcient T depends on the
shape of the potential energy that exists within the interval 0  x  s, namely,
it is a functional of V: 0  T D TŒV  1. One may also note that the relation
R C T D 1 derives only from the constancy of J due to the one-dimensional,
steady-state condition. In other terms, the relation R C T D 1 does not depend
on the form of the potential energy within the interval 0  x  s. It must then
reﬂect some invariance property intrinsic to the solution of the problem. In fact, the
invariance is that of the density of the probability ﬂux J , which is intrinsic to the
form of the Schrödinger equation and leads to the relation (11.35).
For the sake of generality one provisionally considers a slightly more general
equation than (11.28), built by the linear operator
L D d2
dx2 C p.x/ d
dx C q.x/ ;
(11.37)
where the functions p and q are real. If u is a solution of the differential equation
L w D 0 in the interval 0  x  s, let P.x/ be any function such that p D dP=dx,
and deﬁne
v.x/ D u.x/
Z x
a
expŒP./
u2./
d ;
(11.38)
where a, x belong to the same interval. It is found by inspection that L v D 0 in the
interval 0  x  s, namely, v is also a solution. Moreover, the Wronskian of u and
v (Sect. A.12) reads
W.x/ D u v0  u0 v D exp.P/ :
(11.39)
www.ebook3000.com

232
11
Elementary Cases
As the Wronskian never vanishes, u and v are linearly independent. This shows that
for any solution u of the differential equation L w D 0 in a given interval, (11.38)
provides another solution which is linearly independent from u (see also Prob. 8.3).
As the differential equation is linear and of the second order, the general solution is
then given by a linear combination of u and v.
Being the equation L w D 0 homogeneous, the solution u may be replaced by
u, with  ¤ 0 a constant. In this case v must be replaced by v= due to (11.38).
It follows that the Wronskian (11.39) is invariant under scaling of the solutions.
Another consequence of the homogeneity of L w D 0 is that the dimensions of w
may be chosen arbitrarily. The same holds for the dimensions of u. Once the latter
have been chosen, the dimensions of v follow from (11.38); in fact, the product uv
has the dimensions of a length. From (11.32) it then follows that the products a3 u
and a4 v have the same dimensions.
The linear independency allows one to choose for u and v the two fundamental
solutions, namely, those having the properties [66, Sect. 5.2]
u.0/ D 1 ;
u0.0/ D 0 ;
v.0/ D 0 ;
v0.0/ D 1 ;
(11.40)
so that the Wronskian W equals 1 everywhere. Then, letting a6 D 0 in (11.31) and
prescribing the continuity of the solution and its derivative at x D 0 and x D s
yields, from (11.32),

Repeating the calculation of this section after letting a1 D 0, a6 ¤ 0 provides
the known result that, for a given barrier, the transmission probability for a particle
of energy E is the same whether the particle is launched from the left or from the
right. The property holds also in the relativistic case [98].

Taking a one-dimensional case, let V D V0 < 0 for 0 < x < s and V D 0 elsewhere.
From the general properties of the time-independent Schrödinger equation it follows
E  V0. The case E > 0 is treated in the same way as that of Sect. 11.3.2 and leads
to similar results. The case V0 < E < 0, shown in Fig. 11.4, is instead different
from those investigated above: the total energy is quantized and the wave function
is square integrable. The Schrödinger equation over the three domains reads

to a1 and to a4. It follows that if it were a1 D 0 or a4 D 0, then it would also be
a2 D a3 D 0. However, this is impossible because w cannot vanish identically; as
a consequence it is necessarily a1 ¤ 0, a4 ¤ 0. This shows that, in contrast to the
classical case, the particle penetrates the boundaries of the well. The relations found
so far determine two different expressions for a2=a3 : For them to be compatible,
the equality #2 exp.i k s/ D .#/2 exp.i k s/ must hold, which represents the
condition of a vanishing determinant of the 4  4, homogeneous algebraic system

Cases Related to the Linear Harmonic Oscillator
12.1
Introduction
The chapter is devoted to the solution of the Schrödinger equation for the linear
harmonic oscillator, and to a number of important application of the results. The
importance of the problem has already been outlined in the sections devoted to the
classical treatment: its results can in fact be applied, with little or no modiﬁcation,
to mechanical situations where the positional force acting on the particle can be
replaced with a ﬁrst-order expansion, or to more complicate systems whose degrees
of freedom can be separated into a set of Hamiltonian functions of the linear-
harmonic-oscillator type. Such systems are not necessarily mechanical: for instance,
the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuo is amenable to such a separation,
leading to the formal justiﬁcation of the concept of photon. Similarly, a system of
particles near a mechanical-equilibrium point can be separated in the same manner,
providing the justiﬁcation of the concept of phonon. An interesting property of the
Fourier transform of the Schrödinger equation for the linear harmonic oscillator is
shown in the complements.
12.2
Linear Harmonic Oscillator
An example of paramount importance is that of the linear harmonic oscillator,
whose classical treatment is given in Sect. 3.3. The potential energy is shown in
Fig. 12.1. From the general properties of the time-independent Schrödinger equation
(Sect. 8.2.3) it follows E  0. Also, the time-independent wave function w is
expected to be square integrable. The Hamiltonian operator is found by replacing p
with Op D i „ d=dx in (3.1), yielding the Schrödinger equation

Also, Oa and Oa do not commute; using the deﬁnitions of Oa and Oa yields
OaOa  OaOa D I ;
OaOa C OaOa D 2 H 0 ;
(12.5)
with I the identity operator. From (12.5), after deﬁning the operator N D OaOa,
called number operator, one ﬁnds 2 H 0 D .I C OaOa/ C OaOa D 2 N C I , whence

and observing that Oa and Oa are real, one ﬁnds

(12.7)
showing that N D OaOa, in contrast to Oa and Oa, is Hermitean, hence its eigenvalues
 are real. Moreover, they are nonnegative: in fact, the integral of jwj2 in (12.7)
is strictly positive because an eigenfunction cannot vanish identically; in turn, the
integral of jOawj2 is strictly positive if Ow ¤ 0, whereas it vanishes if Ow D 0
identically. As a consequence it is  D 0 if and only if Oaw D 0, otherwise it is
 > 0. Another relation is found by left multiplying by Oa the ﬁrst relation in (12.5),
to ﬁnd N OaOaN D Oa, whence a new operator is deﬁned: N Oa D Oa .N C I /.
The action of the latter upon an eigenfunction w of N results in
N Oaw D Oa .N C I / w D Oa w C Oaw D . C 1/ Oaw :
(12.8)
In other terms, if  is an eigenvalue of N and w is an eigenfunction belonging to
, then  C 1 is also an eigenvalue of N , with eigenfunction Oaw. This reasoning
can be repeated indeﬁnitely: N OaOaw D . C 2/ OaOaw ; : : :; its conclusion is that
if a number   0 is known to be an eigenvalue of N , then all numbers  C 1,
 C 2; : : : belonging to the unlimited ladder1 beginning with  are also eigenvalues
of N . Also, if w is an eigenfunction belonging to , the eigenfunctions belonging
to  C 1,  C 2; : : : are Oaw, OaOaw; : : :.
One may argue that the same kind of reasoning should be applicable in the
backward direction as well, to check whether   1,   2 are eigenvalues of N . In
fact, right multiplying by Oa the ﬁrst relation in (12.5) yields OaN N Oa D Oa, whence
Oa .N  I / D N Oa. The action of N Oa upon an eigenfunction w of N results in
N Oaw D Oa .N  I / w D Oa w  Oaw D .  1/ Oaw :
(12.9)
Remembering that the eigenvalues of N are nonnegative, (12.9) shows that if  is
an eigenvalue of N and   1, than   1 is also an eigenvalue of N , to which Oaw
belongs. By induction, N OaOaw D .  2/ OaOaw, and so on. However, the backward
process cannot be repeated indeﬁnitely because one of the numbers   2,   3; : : :
will eventually be found to be negative: this result contradicts (12.7), that shows
that the eigenvalues cannot be negative. The contradiction is due to the implicit
assumption that the eigenvalue  can be any real number, and is readily eliminated
by specifying that  D n D 0; 1; 2; : : :; consider in fact the eigenvalue n D 1 and
let w be an eigenfunction belonging to it. Applying (12.9) shows that w0 D Oaw is an
eigenfunction of N belonging to n D 0, namely, N w0 D 0. The next step in the
backward process would yield Oaw0 which, however, is not an eigenfunction because
it vanishes identically: this is easily found by combining hw0jN w0i D jjOaw0jj2

end when the eigenvalue n D 0 is reached.
The above reasoning shows that only the numbers n D 0; 1; 2; : : : are eigenvalues
of N . It also provides an easy method to calculate the eigenfunctions, that starts
from the result Oaw0 D 0 just found. Such a relation is a differential equation of the

From this construction it is easily found that the eigenvalues are not degenerate, and

2The eigenfunction’s nature of being either even or odd is related to a general property of the
one-dimensional Schrödinger equation, speciﬁcally: if the eigenvalue E is simple and the potential
energy V is even, the eigenfunction corresponding to E is either even or odd (Prob. 8.4).

12.3
Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field’s Energy
241
In conclusion, the energy of the linear harmonic oscillator is the sum of the
minimum energy E0 D „ !=2 > 0, also called zero-point energy, and of an
integer number of elementary quanta of energy „!. The paramount importance of
the example of the linear harmonic oscillator has already been emphasized in the
classical treatment of Sect. 3.13.1. Examples of application of the quantization of
the linear harmonic oscillator are given in Sects. 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5.
The Hermite polynomials (12.13) fulﬁll the recursive relation [59]
HnC1  2  Hn C 2 n Hn1 D 0 ;
n D 1; 2; : : : ;
(12.16)
which is useful to determine some properties of the Oa, Oa operators. For instance,
combining the deﬁnition of Oa with (12.12) one obtains

.nŠ 2n p/1=2 exp.2=2/

(12.17)
On the other hand, one ﬁnds from (12.13) that dHn=d D 2  Hn  HnC1. Replacing
the derivative in (12.17) yields
Oawn D

p

.nŠ 2n p/1=2 exp.2=2/ HnC1 D

n C 1 wnC1 :
(12.18)
This result shows that, apart from the multiplicative constant, Oa transforms the state
of index n into that of index n C 1. Due to (12.15), the transformation corresponds
to an increase EnC1  En D „ ! in the total energy of the oscillator. Since its
action “creates” a quantum of energy, Oa is called creation operator. Using the same
procedure, combined with the recursive relation (12.16), one ﬁnds
Oawn D pn wn1 :
(12.19)
Due to the above, Oa is called destruction operator or annihilation operator. Note
that, due to (12.18, 12.19), the successive application of Oa and Oa to wn is equivalent
to N wn D n wn.
12.3
Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field’s Energy
The energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within a ﬁnite volume V free of charge has
been calculated in Sect. 5.6 in terms of the ﬁeld’s modes. In such a calculation the
shape of V was chosen as that of a box whose sides d1, d2, d3 are aligned with the
coordinate axes and start from the origin (Fig. 5.1), so that V D d1 d2 d3. The energy

It should be noted, however, that if the intermediate expression in (12.22), instead

In conclusion, the energy of each mode of oscillation is a multiple (0 included) of the
elementary quantum of energy „ !.k/. This result provides the formal justiﬁcation
of the concept of photon. The integer nk is the occupation number of the pair k; ,
whereas nk is the number of photons3 of the mode corresponding to k. Like in the
classical treatment, the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the sum of the energies
of each mode of oscillation.

Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field’s Momentum
The momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within a ﬁnite volume V free of charge

3To complete the description of the photon it is necessary to work out also the quantum expression
of its momentum. This is done in Sect. 12.4. The concept of photon was introduced by Einstein in
1905 [45] (the English translation of [45] is in [133]). The quantization procedure shown here is
given in [41].

of momentum „ k, and completes the formal justiﬁcation of the concept of photon
started in Sect. 12.3. Each photon has energy and momentum, given by „ ! and „ k
respectively. Like in the classical treatment, the momentum of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is the sum of the momenta of each mode of oscillation.

In (12.31), 3 N is the number of degrees of freedom, b the normal coordinate of

is given by a sum of terms, each associated with a single degree of freedom. In turn,
each summand H is identical to the Hamiltonian function of a linear harmonic

called mode of the vibrating system. The classical expression of the energy associ-
ated with each mode has the same form as that of a mode of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld (compare (12.31) with (12.22)). By analogy with the electromagnetic case, a
particle of energy „ !, called phonon, is introduced in the quantum description,
and the energy of the mode is ascribed to the set of phonons belonging to the mode.
The integers ./ are the occupation numbers of the normal modes of oscillation.4
Note that the quadratic form (12.31) of the total energy H of each degree of
freedom of the oscillating system was derived directly, in contrast with that of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld where the product of two linear forms was involved (compare
with (12.22)). For this reason, the discussion about three possible forms of the
Hamiltonian operator, carried out in Sect. 12.3, is not necessary here. The total
energy (12.36) does not diverge because the number of degrees of freedom is ﬁnite.
The standard way of describing the interaction of an electron with the vibrating
nuclei is using the quantum-mechanical, ﬁrst-order perturbation theory (Sect. 17.8).

Introduction
A number of properties of the one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger
equation can be worked out without specifying the form of the coefﬁcient. To this
purpose one examines the two fundamental solutions, which are real because the
coefﬁcient is such. One ﬁnds that the fundamental solutions do not have multiple
zeros and do not vanish at the same point; more precisely, the zeros of the ﬁrst
and second fundamental solution separate each other. It is also demonstrated that
the character of the fundamental solutions within an interval is oscillatory or non-
oscillatory depending on the sign of the equation’s coefﬁcient in such an interval.
After completing this analysis, the chapter examines an important and elegant
solution method, consisting in factorizing the operator. The theory is worked out
for the case of localized states, corresponding to discrete eigenvalues. The procedure
by which the eigenfunctions’ normalization is embedded into the solution scheme is
also shown. The chapter continues with the analysis of the solution of a Schrödinger
equation whose coefﬁcient is periodic; this issue ﬁnds important applications in the
case of periodic structures like, e.g., crystals. Finally, the solution of the Schrödinger
equation for a particle subjected to a central force is worked out; the equation is
separated and the angular part is solved ﬁrst, followed by the radial part whose
potential energy is speciﬁed in the Coulomb case. The ﬁrst complements deal
with the operator associated with the angular momentum and to the solution of
the angular and radial equations by means of the factorization method. The last
complement generalizes the solution method for the one-dimensional Schrödinger
equation in which the potential energy is replaced with a piecewise-constant
function, leading to the concept of transmission matrix.

13.2
Properties of the One-Dimensional
Schrödinger Equation
In the general expression (11.44) for the transmission coefﬁcient, the fundamental
solutions u, v appear in the denominator. It is then necessary to investigate the zeros
of the solutions of (11.28). Due to the u.0/ D 1 prescription, the possible zeros of u
belong to the interval 0 < x  s, while those of v belong to the interval 0  x  s.
If one or more zero exist, they cannot be multiple. In fact, if u had a multiple
zero at xm it would be u.xm/ D 0, u0.xm/ D 0, hence u D 0 would be a solution
of (11.28) compatible with such conditions. In fact, because of the uniqueness of
the solution, u D 0 would be the only solution. Observing that u is continuous, this
would contradict the condition u.0/ ¤ 0. Similarly, if v had a multiple zero it would
vanish identically. Remembering that the derivative of the solution is continuous,
this would contradict the condition v0.0/ D 1 of (11.40). Another property is that
u and v cannot vanish at the same point. This is apparent from the relation W.x/ D
u v0  u0 v D 1 demonstrated in Sect. A.12. For the same reason, u0 and v0 cannot
vanish at the same point.
If one of the solutions, say u, has more than one zero in 0 < x  s, then the
following property holds: between two consecutive zeros of u there is one and only
one zero of v. Let xL, xR be two consecutive zeros of u, with 0 < xL < xR  s.
The property is demonstrated by showing, ﬁrst, that a contradiction would arise
if there were no zeros of v between xL and xR (that is to say, at least one zero
must exist there) and, second, that if a zero of v exists between xL and xR, it must
be unique [127]. To proceed one considers the function u=v in the interval xL 
x  xR. By deﬁnition u=v vanishes at the boundaries of such an interval while,
as shown above, v cannot vanish at the boundaries. If one assumes that there are
no zeros of v inside the interval, then u=v exists everywhere in the interval, and is
also everywhere continuous with a continuous ﬁrst derivative because u and v are
solutions of the second-order differential equation (11.28). As u=v vanishes at xL
and xR, its derivative must vanish at least once in the open interval xL < x < xR.
However, this is impossible because d.u=v/=dx D W=v2 D 1=v2 ¤ 0. This
shows that v must have at least one zero between xL and xR. Such a zero is also
unique because, if v had two zeros in xL < x < xR, then by the same reasoning
u would have one zero between them, so xL and xR would not be consecutive. The
property may be restated as the zeros of two real linearly independent solutions of
a second-order linear differential equation separate each other. The property does
not hold for complex solutions.
So far the properties demonstrated in this section did not consider the sign of the
coefﬁcient q.x/ D 2 m .E  V/=„2 of (11.28). The coefﬁcient separates the interval
0  x  s into subintervals where q is alternatively positive or negative. If q is
continuous the extrema of the subintervals are the zeros of q, otherwise they may
be discontinuity points of q. In either case the behavior of the solution u within
each subinterval depends on the sign of q there. To show this, consider the function
d.u u0/=dx D .u0/2q u2, where the expression at the right-hand side has been found

13.2
Properties of the One-Dimensional Schrödinger Equation

by means of (11.28). If q  0 in the subinterval, then d.u u0/=dx is nonnegative.
It follows that u u0 is a nondecreasing function in the subinterval, hence it has one
zero at most. Remembering that u and u0 cannot vanish at the same point, one of
the following holds: (i) neither u nor u0 vanishes in the subinterval, (ii) either u or
u0 vanishes once in the subinterval. For a given interval a function is called non-
oscillatory if its derivative vanishes at most once. It follows that the solution u is
non-oscillatory in those subintervals where q  0. The case V D V0 > E > 0 in the
interval 0 < x < s, considered in Sect. 11.3.1, is of this type.
The investigation about the behavior of the solutions may be extended to the
case of an inﬁnite domain, at least for typical forms of the potential energy V [96,
Chap. III.9]. Consider for instance the domain 0  x < 1, and assume that for x >
0 the potential energy is such that the constraint q.x/  ˛2 > 0 is fulﬁlled. Without
further specifying the form of q, it is possible to analyze the asymptotic behavior of
the solutions by comparison with those of the simple case q D const D ˛2. The
fundamental solutions1 of the simple case are Qu D cosh.˛ x/ and Qv D sinh.˛ x/=˛,
neither of which is acceptable from a physical point of view because both diverge as
x ! 1. However, two linear combinations of the fundamental solutions, namely,
Qu˛ Qv D exp.˛ x/ and QuC˛ Qv D exp.˛ x/, are also linearly independent solutions
of w00 D ˛2 w, the ﬁrst of which is physically acceptable.
Turning now to the general case q.x/  ˛2 > 0, and letting u, v be its
fundamental solutions, one ﬁnds that u is by construction positive and concave
upward for x D 0; thus, it increases when x departs from 0, thus making the second
derivative q u even more positive. In conclusion, u remains positive for x > 0;
moreover, it keeps increasing at least as fast as exp.˛ x/. One can prove the last
statement by the following procedure: multiply by Qu both sides of u00 D q u, then
multiply by u both sides of Qu00 D ˛2 Qu, and subtract the resulting expressions from
each other. Following the same steps as in Prob. 8.2, and remembering that here
˛2 C q is non-positive, one ﬁnds for the Wronskian W.u; Qu/ D u ˛ sinh.˛ x/ 
u0 cosh.˛ x/ the relation2
dW.u; Qu/

(13.1)
Integrating (13.1) from 0 to x and observing that W.u; Qu/ vanishes at x D 0, one

manner one ﬁnds that, by construction, the second fundamental solution v has a
positive derivative and is concave upward for x D 0; thus, it remains positive and
keeps increasing for x > 0. Following the same steps as for u yields W.v; Qv/ D

Integrating both sides from 0 to x and taking the exponentials yield v  sinh.˛ x/;
also, (13.3) shows that asymptotically it is v0  ˛ v. As a ﬁnal consideration, the
Wronskian of the two linearly independent solutions u, v is equal to a constant
(Prob. 8.2); using the values of the fundamental solutions and their derivatives at
x D 0 yields W.u; v/ D 1.
Having discussed some properties of the fundamental solutions, one may seek a
linear combination of u, v that vanishes at inﬁnity. To this purpose, one observes
that the ratios u=v and u0=v0 have the following property:
u

Due to (13.5), u=v is a decreasing function while u0=v0 is an increasing function;
as their difference (13.4) vanishes asymptotically, the two ratios have a common
positive limit  as x ! 1. The following inequalities then hold, u0=v0 <  < u=v
or, equivalently, u0=v0   < 0 < u=v  . Using (13.4), the latter form can further
be reﬁned to yield

which in turn splits as

(13.7)
Due to the asymptotic behaviors discussed above, the denominators v, v0 in (13.7)
are such that v  sinh.˛ x/, v0  ˛ v  ˛ sinh.˛ x/; as a consequence, the
linear combination u   v of the two fundamental solutions is always positive,
and vanishes at inﬁnity at least as fast as 1=v0, a fortiori at least as fast as
1= sinh.˛ x/  exp.˛ x/. At the same time the derivative u0   v0 of the linear
combination is always negative, and vanishes at inﬁnity in the same manner.

Finally, the linear combination found above is the only solution that vanishes at
inﬁnity; in fact, consider another linear combination, say, w D uC v with  ¤ :
the new solution can be recast in the form w D u   v C . C / v. While the term
u v vanishes asymptotically, the remaining term diverges with the same strength
as v because  C  ¤ 0.

Localized States—Operator’s Factorization
It may happen that the form of the potential energy V in the interval 0 
x  s is such that V has one or more negative minima (Fig. 13.1). In this case
negative eigenvalues of E may exist, giving rise to localized states. To treat this case
one must preliminarily observe that the eigenfunctions do not vanish identically
outside the interval 0  x  s, because the minima of V are ﬁnite. As a consequence,
it is convenient to replace the above interval with x1  x  x2, where the
two boundaries may be brought (independently from each other) to 1 or C1,
respectively. Letting

Other Examples of the Schrödinger Equation
The integer index l D 0; 1; : : : is attached to r.x/ for convenience. In fact, in typical
applications the form of the potential energy in (13.8) may be prescribed by a
previous separation procedure in which the index is involved. As will be shown
after the analysis of the solution procedure, index l may eventually be disposed
of. For the time being, the solutions of (13.9) must be considered as dependent
on the eigenvalue  and on the index l, namely, w D wl.x/. Also, for a given
pair , l the eigenfunctions are nondegenerate due to the normalization condition.
As a consequence, two eigenfunctions belonging to the same pair differ by a
multiplicative constant at most.
13.3.1
Factorization Scheme
A possible method for solving (13.9) is expanding w into a power series, replacing
the series into (13.9), collecting the terms of equal power, and letting their
coefﬁcients vanish. This provides a recurrence relation involving the coefﬁcients of
the series; then, the latter is suitably truncated to obtain a square-integrable solution.
Another method for solving (13.9), that greatly reduces the calculation effort and
brings about a procedure of supreme elegance, is the operator’s factorization. The
conditions that make the factorization possible are illustrated in [67] and are brieﬂy
reported here. In essence they amount to ﬁnding a function gl.x/ and a parameter Ll
such that (13.9) may be recast as

glC1 C d

glC1  d


wl D .  Ll/ wl :
(13.11)
Note that both (13.10) and (13.11) must be identical to (13.9). An additional
constraint is that, for a given integer n, it must be LnC1 > LlC1, l D 0; 1; : : : ; n1. To
proceed, the boundary conditions wl.x1/ D wl.x2/ D 0 will be assumed. If one or
both boundaries are at inﬁnity, the condition
R
jwlj2 dx < 1 will also be assumed.
Now, imposing that (13.10) is identical to (13.9) yields g2

g2

Other Examples of the Schrödinger Equation
where (13.19) has been used after letting f1 D wl, f2 D A 
lC1wl. From (13.20) it
follows that if wl is an eigenfunction, that is, if wl does not vanish identically, then
the case  < LlC1 is impossible. In fact, the integral at the right-hand side of (13.20)
is strictly positive, while that at the left-hand side is nonnegative. There remain two
possibilities, namely:
1. A 
lC1wl does not vanish identically, whence both integrals of (13.20) are strictly
positive. It follows that  > LlC1. Also, as will be shown later, A 
lC1wl is another
eigenfunction of (13.9). The opposite is also true, namely,  > LlC1 implies that
A 
lC1wl does not vanish identically.
2. A 
lC1wl vanishes identically, whence  D LlC1. The opposite is also true,
namely,  D LlC1 implies that A 
lC1wl vanishes identically. In this case A 
lC1wl
is not an eigenfunction of (13.9).
The discussion above allows one to identify the eigenvalue . In fact, there must be
a value of the index l, say l D n, such that the equality  D LnC1 holds. It follows
that the eigenvalue is identiﬁed by the index n,  D n.
As mentioned before the condition LnC1 > LlC1, l D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1 holds. As
a consequence, the eigenfunction corresponding to the pair n; l may be indicated
with wnl instead of wl. In particular, the eigenfunction corresponding to l D n is
wnn. As shown in case 2 above, such an eigenfunction corresponds to the equality
n D LnC1 which, in turn, implies the condition A 
nC1wnn D 0. Remembering
the second relation of (13.17), such a condition yields the ﬁrst-order equation

tion corresponding to l D n is found by solving a ﬁrst-order equation. It remains to
determine the eigenfunctions corresponding to l D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. For this, left
multiplying the ﬁrst relation in (13.18) by A 
lC1, letting l  l C 1 in the second
relation of (13.18), and remembering that  D LnC1, one ﬁnds

The above shows that both wn;lC1 and A 
lC1wnl are eigenfunctions of the operator
A 

lC1 belonging to the same eigenvalue. As the eigenfunctions are nondegen-
erate, it must be
A 

(13.24)
where the constant may be determined by imposing the normalization condition.
The result shows that if wn0 is known, one may calculate a sequence of eigen-
functions belonging to n D LnC1 (apart from the normalization constant) by
successive applications of ﬁrst-order operators: A 

nC1wnn D 0
is not an eigenfunction anymore, so any further application of the operator beyond
l D n provides a sequence of zeros. In a similar manner, left multiplying the second
relation in (13.18) by A C
l
and letting l  l  1 in the ﬁrst relation of (13.18), one
ﬁnds

(13.25)

l A C

(13.26)
From the above one ﬁnds that both wn;l1 and A C
l wnl are eigenfunctions of the
operator A C
l A 

belonging to the same eigenvalue, whence
A C
l wnl D const  wn;l1 :
(13.27)
The result shows that if wnn is known, one may calculate a sequence of eigenfunc-
tions belonging to n D LnC1 (apart from the normalization constant) by successive
applications of ﬁrst-order operators: A C
n wnn D const  wn;n1, A C
n1wn;n1 D
constwn;n2; : : :. The process stops for l D 0 which, by hypothesis, is the minimum
of l. The derivation also shows that since wnn and the operators are real, all the
eigenfunctions found using the factorization method are real as well.
13.3.4
Normalization
The results of this section may be summarized as follows: (13.24) shows that
the application of the ﬁrst-order operator A 
lC1 to an eigenfunction of indices
n; l provides an eigenfunction of indices n; l C 1. Similarly, (13.27) shows that
the application of the ﬁrst-order operator A C
l
to an eigenfunction of indices n; l
provides an eigenfunction of indices n; l  1. These results may be described as a
process of going up or down along a ladder characterized by an index n  0, whose
steps are numbered by a second index l D 0; 1; : : : ; n. It follows that by applying
two suitably chosen operators one may go up and down (or down and up) one step in
the ladder and return to the same eigenfunction apart from a multiplicative constant.

Other Examples of the Schrödinger Equation
This is indeed true, as shown by (13.18), that also indicate that the multiplicative
constant to be used at the end of the two steps starting from wnl is LnC1  Ll
when the operators’ index is l. It follows that the constants in (13.24,13.27) must be
chosen as pLnC1  LlC1 and pLnC1  Ll, respectively. This provides a method for
achieving the normalization of the eigenfunctions, starting from an eigenfunction
wnn normalized to unity as in (13.21). For this one deﬁnes the auxiliary, mutually

Thanks to the auxiliary operators the multiplicative constant at the end of the two

is normalized to unity, all the others have the same normalization. In particular,
if wnn is normalized to unity as in (13.21), then the whole ladder of normalized

Schrödinger Equation with a Periodic Coefﬁcient
An important case of (11.28) occurs when the coefﬁcient q is periodic [49], with
a period that will be denoted with 2 !. The independent variable (not necessarily a
Cartesian one) will be denoted with z:
w00.z/ C q.z/ w.z/ D 0 ;
q.z C 2 !/ D q.z/ ;
(13.33)

13.4
Schrödinger Equation with a Periodic Coefﬁcient
257
where primes indicate derivatives. Here the variable z is considered real; the theory,
however, can be extended to the case of a complex variable. Let u.z/, v.z/ be
fundamental solutions (Sect. 11.4), with u.0/ D 1, u0.0/ D 0, v.0/ D 0, v0.0/ D 1.
As (13.33) holds for any z, it holds in particular for z C 2 !. From the periodicity of
q it follows
w00.z C 2 !/ C q.z/ w.z C 2 !/ D 0 ;
(13.34)
namely, w.zC2 !/ is also a solution. Similarly, u.zC2 !/, v.zC2 !/ are solutions.
As the equation has only two independent solutions it must be
u.zC2 !/ D a11 u.z/Ca12 v.z/ ;
v.zC2 !/ D a21 u.z/Ca22 v.z/ ;
(13.35)
with aij suitable constants. The values of the latter are readily related to those of
u; v by letting z D 0 and using the initial conditions: u.2 !/ D a11, u0.2 !/ D a12,
v.2 !/ D a21, v0.2 !/ D a22. As the Wronskian of u; v equals unity it follows
a11a22  a12a21 D 1. One now seeks a constant s such that
u.z C 2 !/ D s u.z/ ;
v.z C 2 !/ D s v.z/ :
(13.36)
This is equivalent to diagonalizing (13.35), namely, s must fulﬁll for any z the
following relations:
.a11  s/ u.z/ C a12 v.z/ D 0 ;
a21 u.z/ C .a22  s/ v.z/ D 0 :
(13.37)
Equating to zero the determinant of the coefﬁcients in (13.37) yields
s D a0
2 ˙
s
a2
0
4  1 ;
a0 D a11 C a22 :
(13.38)
If a0 D 2 the two solutions of (13.38) are real and take the common value s D
sC D 1. In this case, as shown by (13.36), the functions u; v are periodic with
period 2 !. Similarly, if a0 D 2 the two solutions of (13.38) are real and take the
common value s D sC D 1. In this case, as shown by (13.36), the functions u; v
are periodic with period 4 !, whereas their moduli juj, jvj are periodic with period
2 !. As the moduli juj, jvj do not diverge as further and further periods are added
to z, the case a0 D ˙2 is stable. If a0 > 2 the two solutions of (13.38) are real
and range over the intervals 0 < s < 1 and, respectively, sC > 1. In particular
it is s ! 0 for a0 ! 1. If a0 < 2 the two solutions of (13.38) are real and
range over the intervals sC < 1 and, respectively, 1 < s < 0. In particular it
is s ! 0 for a0 ! 1. From the relations (13.36) it follows that the moduli of
the solutions corresponding to sC diverge: in fact one has u.z C n 2 !/ D .sC/n u.z/
and v.z C n 2 !/ D .sC/n v.z/, so the case ja0j > 2 is unstable. When ja0j < 2 the

Other Examples of the Schrödinger Equation
two solutions are complex, namely, s˙ D exp.˙i / with tan2  D 4=a2
0  1. As
the modulus of the solutions is unity, the case ja0j < 2 is stable.
The discussion about stability may seem incomplete because the possible cases
depend on the value of a0 D a11 C a22 D u.2 !/ C v0.2 !/, which depends on the
fundamental solutions that are yet to be found. On the other hand, the analysis of
stability must eventually reduce to considering only the properties of the coefﬁcient
of (13.33). In fact, it can be shown that if q.z/ is positive for all values of z and
the absolute value of 2 !
R 2 !
0
q.z/ dz is not larger than 4, then ja0j < 2 [92].
Multiplying both sides of the ﬁrst relation in (13.36) by expŒ˛ .z C 2 !/, with
˛ an undetermined constant, yields
Qu.z C 2 !/ D s exp.2 !˛/ Qu.z/ ;
Qu.z/ D exp.˛ z/ u.z/ :
(13.39)
A similar treatment is applied to v.z/, to yield another auxiliary function Qv. Now
one exploits the undetermined constant to impose that the auxiliary functions be
periodic of period 2 !: for this one lets s exp.2 ! ˛/ D 1, whence
˛ D log s
2 ! :
(13.40)
The constant ˛ deﬁned by (13.40) is termed characteristic exponent or Floquet
exponent. Three of the cases listed in the discussion above about stability, namely,
s˙ D exp.˙i /, s˙ D 1, and s˙ D 1 lead now to the single expression
˛˙ D ˙i =.2 !/, with 0    , showing that ˛ is purely imaginary. The
cases 0 < s < 1 and sC > 1 lead to real values of ˛ (negative and positive,
respectively) and, ﬁnally, the cases sC < 1 and 1 < s < 0 lead to complex
values of ˛. Considering the stable cases only, one transforms (13.33) by replacing
w.z/ with, e.g., Qu.z/ expŒ˙i  z=.2 !/ to ﬁnd

The coefﬁcients and the unknown function of (13.41) are periodic functions of
period 2 !. As a consequence it sufﬁces to solve the equation within the single
period, say, 0  z  2 !. An example is given in Sect. 17.9.4; a different approach
leading to the generalization to three dimensions is shown in Sect. 17.6.

Schrödinger Equation for a Central Force
In the investigation about the properties of atoms it is important to analyze the
dynamics of particle subjected to a central force in the case where the motion is
limited. The treatment based on the concepts of Classical Mechanics is given in
Sects. 3.4 (where the general properties are illustrated), 3.7 (for the two-particle

interaction), 3.8 (for a Coulomb ﬁeld in the repulsive case), and 3.13.6 (for a
Coulomb ﬁeld in the attractive case). To proceed one considers a particle of mass3
m0 acted upon by a force deriving from a potential energy of the central type, V D
V.r/, and expresses the time-independent Schrödinger equation „2=.2 m0/ r2w C
V.r/ w D E w in spherical coordinates r, #, ' (Sect. B.1). Remembering the

The ﬁrst equation in (13.45), called angular equation, does not depend on any
parameter speciﬁc to the problem in hand. As a consequence, its eigenvalues c and
eigenfunctions Y can be calculated once and for all. Being the equation’s domain
two dimensional, the eigenfunctions Y are expected to depend onto two indices,
say, l, m. After the angular equation is solved, inserting each eigenvalue c into the
second equation of (13.45), called radial equation, provides the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the latter. For the radial equation, the solution depends on the
form of V.r/. It is also worth noting the similarity of Ve with its classical counterpart
(3.5), that reads

Other Examples of the Schrödinger Equation
To tackle the solution of the angular equation OY D c Y one associates an operator
Lx, Ly, Lz with each component of the classical angular momentum M D r ^
p, and another operator L 2 to its square modulus M2. The procedure, illustrated
in Sect. 13.6.1, shows that the three operators Lx, Ly, Lz do not commute with
each other, whereas L 2 commutes with each of them. Also, it is found that L 2
is proportional to O, speciﬁcally, L 2 D „2 O. In conclusion, the Schrödinger
equation in the case of a central force reads
H w D E w ;
H D 

@r2 r C
L 2
2 m0 r2 C V.r/ :
(13.47)
As the r coordinate does not appear in L 2, the latter commutes with H ; moreover,
L 2 does not depend on time. As a consequence, its expectation value is a constant
of motion (Sect. 10.7). Similarly, Lz commutes with L 2 and does not contain r or
t, so it commutes with H as well and its expectation value is also a constant of
motion. As H , L 2, and Lz commute with each other, they have a common set of
eigenfunctions.
13.5.1
Angular Part of the Equation
The conservation of the expectation values of L 2 and Lz is the counterpart of
the classical result of the conservation of M2 and Mz (Sect. 2.8). In contrast, the
expectation values of Lx and Ly are not constants of motion. To determine the
eigenfunctions w of H , L 2 and Lz it is convenient to solve the eigenvalue equation
for Lz ﬁrst:
Lzw D Lz w ;
i „ @w
@' D Lz w ;
w D v.r; #/ exp.i Lz '=„/ ;
(13.48)
with v yet undetermined. For an arbitrary value of Lz, the exponential part of
w is a multi-valued function of '. This is not acceptable because w should not
vary when ' is changed by integer multiples of 2. A single-valued function is
achieved by letting Lz=„ D m, with m an integer. In conclusion, the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of Lz are

This result shows that in (13.47) the factor exp.i m '/ cancels out, so that O actually

From L 2 D „2 O, it follows that the eigenvalue of L 2 is  D „2 c. The
eigenvalues c of (13.52) are found by the factorization method described in
Sect. 13.3.1; they have the form c D l .l C 1/, with l a nonnegative integer, called
orbital (or total) angular momentum quantum number. For a given l, the allowed
values of m, called azimuthal (or magnetic) quantum number, are the 2 lC1 integers

The factorization method provides also the eigenfunctions of L 2 and Lz, that
are called spherical harmonics and, as expected, depend on the two indices l, m.
The details of the calculation of the eigenfunctions Ym

the square modulus of the angular momentum commutes with any single component
of it. To check whether L 2 or any of the components Lx, Ly, Lz commute with
the Hamiltonian operator of a central force, it is necessary to express all operators
in spherical coordinates. To this purpose, using Lz by way of example, one ﬁnds

The partial derivatives @=@x and @=@y in terms of the spherical coordinates are
extracted from (B.4); in particular, the ﬁrst one reads @=@x D sin # cos ' @=@r C
.1=r/ cos # cos ' @=@#  .1=r/ .sin '= sin #/ @=@', while the expression of @=@y is
obtained from that of @=@x by replacing cos ' with sin ' and sin ' with  cos '.
When such expressions of the partial derivatives are used within (13.65), several
terms cancel out to ﬁnally yield the relation

which, consistently with the classical one, Mz D p' (Sect. 3.4), shows that the
operator associated with the z component of the angular momentum is conjugate to
the generalized coordinate '. The quantum relation can thus be derived directly from
the classical one by letting Lz D Op' D i „ @=@'. As already noted in Sect. 2.8, the

Eigenvalues of the Angular Equation
The solution of the angular equation is found by the factorization method described
in Sect. 13.3.1. Remembering that Lz and L 2 commute, the whole eigenfunction
Y D P.#/ exp.i m '/, introduced in Sect. 13.5 and common to both operators, will
be used here. The following hold:
LzY D Lz Y ;
L 2Y D  Y ;
(13.69)
with Lz D m „, m an integer. Applying the operator Lx ˙ i Ly to the ﬁrst equation
in (13.69) yields

Lx ˙ i Ly
	
LzY D m „

Lx ˙ i Ly

signs hold together. Due to the commutation rules (13.60) the left-hand side of the
above transforms into

eigenvalue as Y. By induction, .Lx ˙ i Ly/2Y ; : : : are also eigenfunctions of L 2,
belonging to the same eigenvalue as Y. To summarize, if Y D P.#/ exp.i m '/ is
an eigenfunction common to operators Lz and L 2, belonging to the eigenvalues
Lz D m „ and , respectively, then,
1. .Lx C i Ly/Y is another eigenfunction of L 2 still belonging to , and is also
an eigenfunction of Lz belonging to .m C 1/ „. Similarly, .Lx C i Ly/2Y is still
another eigenfunction of L 2 belonging to , and is also an eigenfunction of Lz
belonging to .m C 2/ „, and so on.
2. .Lx  i Ly/Y is another eigenfunction of L 2 still belonging to , and is also
an eigenfunction of Lz belonging to .m  1/ „. Similarly, .Lx  i Ly/2Y is still
another eigenfunction of L 2 belonging to , and is also an eigenfunction of Lz
belonging to .m  2/ „, and so on.
By this reasoning, starting from a given pair , Y it seems possible to construct
as many degenerate eigenfunctions of L 2 as we please. This, however, leads to
unbounded eigenvalues of Lz, which are not admissible as shown below. As a
consequence, the procedure depicted here can be applied only a ﬁnite number of
times. To demonstrate that the eigenvalues of Lz are bounded one starts from the
relation L 2 D L 2
x C L 2
y C L 2
z and from a given pair , Y. As Y is also an
eigenfunction Lz belonging to, say, m „, an application of L 2 to Y followed by a
left scalar multiplication by Y yields, thanks to (13.69),
  m2„2 D hLxYjLxYi C hLyYjLyYi

(13.72)
where the hermiticity of Lx, Ly has been exploited. Inequality (13.72) provides
the upper bound for jmj. To ﬁnd the acceptable values of m one deﬁnes mC D
max.m/, and lets YC be an eigenfunction of L 2 and Lz belonging to  and mC „,
respectively. From (13.70) one obtains Lz .Lx C i Ly/YC D .mC C 1/ „ .Lx C
i Ly/YC but, as the eigenvalue .mC C 1/„ is not acceptable, it must be .Lx C
i Ly/YC D 0. Similarly, letting m D min.m/, and letting Y be an eigenfunction
of L 2 and Lz belonging to  and m „, respectively, it must be .Lx i Ly/Y D 0.
Due to the commutation rules it is .Lx  i Ly/ .Lx C i Ly/ D L 2

be indicated with Yl

it will be indicated with Pm

Transmission Matrix
The one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger equation (11.28) is solvable
analytically in a limited number of cases, some of which have been illustrated in
the sections above. When the analytical solution is not known one must resort to
approximate methods; an example is given here, with reference to a ﬁnite domain
0  x  s. The latter is tessellated by selecting N points x1 < x2 < : : : < xN,
internal to the domain, called nodes. The boundaries of the domain are indicated
with 0 D x0 < x1 and s D xNC1 > xN. The segment bounded by xi and xiC1 is
indicated with hiC1 and is called element. The same symbol indicates the length of
the element, hiC1 D xiC1  xi. Finally, a subdomain i, called cell, is associated
with each node. For the internal nodes x1; : : : ; xN the cell is bounded by xi  hi=2
and xi C hiC1=2. The same symbol is used to indicate also the cell length, i D

The approximation methods that are applicable to a given tessellation are
numerous. The method depicted in this section replaces the coefﬁcient q.x/ of
(11.28) over each element hi with an approximating function qi.x/ such that the
solution wi.x/ to (11.28) over hi can be found analytically. The approximating
functions qi may differ from an element to another, thus yielding different analytical
solutions. Then, the continuity of the analytical solutions and their derivatives is
imposed at each node; ﬁnally, the same continuity is imposed at the boundaries 0
and s, where the form of the wave function is supposed to be known.
To proceed, consider an internal node i D 1; 2; : : : ; N and the two elements hi,
hiC1 adjacent to it. The solutions wi, wiC1 over the two elements are expressed in

higher-order accuracy without a signiﬁcant increase in the computational cost [19],
[20]. The details of the method are illustrated in Sect. A.13.3 and its application to
the solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation is shown in Prob. 13.3.

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
14.1
Introduction
In many physical problems it is necessary to consider the collision of a particle
with another particle or system of particles. The treatment based on Classical
Mechanics is given in Sects. 3.5,3.6 with reference to the motion’s asymptotic
conditions, without considering the form of the interaction, while Sect. 3.8 shows a
detailed treatment of the Coulomb interaction. Here the approach based on Quantum
Mechanics is shown, dealing with the following problem: a particle in a conservative
motion enters at t D 0 an interaction with another particle or system of particles;
such an interaction has a ﬁnite duration tP, at the end of which the particle is in a
conservative motion again. The perturbation produced by the interaction, which is
described by a suitable Hamiltonian operator, may change the total energy of the
particle; the analysis carried out here, called time-dependent perturbation theory,
allows one to calculate such an energy change. The other particle or system, with
which the particle under consideration interacts, is left unspeciﬁed. However, it is
implied that the larger system, made of the particle under consideration and the
entity with which it interacts, is isolated, so that the total energy is conserved:
if the particle’s energy increases due to the interaction, then such an energy is
absorbed from the other entity, or vice versa. As in Classical Mechanics, other
dynamic properties of an isolated system are conserved; an example of momentum
conservation is given in Sect. 14.8.3.
The discussion is carried out ﬁrst for the case where the eigenvalues prior and
after the perturbation are discrete and nondegenerate. Starting from the general
solution of the perturbed problem, a ﬁrst-order approximation is applied, which
holds for small perturbations, and the probability per unit time of the transition
from a given initial state to another state is found. The analysis is repeated for the
degenerate case (still for discrete eigenvalues) and, ﬁnally, for the situation where
both the initial and ﬁnal state belong to a continuous set. The last section shows
the calculation of the perturbation matrix for a screened Coulomb perturbation.
The complements deal with the important problems of a perturbation constant in

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
time and a harmonic perturbation; a short discussion follows about the Fermi golden
rule, the transitions from discrete to continuous levels, and the general form of the
harmonic perturbation.
14.2
Discrete Eigenvalues
Let H be the Hamiltonian operator that describes the dynamics of the particle when
the perturbation is absent. Such an operator is assumed to be conservative, namely,
H D „2 r2=.2 m/ C V.r/. When the perturbation is present, namely, for 0  t 
tP, the Hamiltonian operator is referred to as H 0. The two operators, respectively
called unperturbed Hamiltonian and perturbed Hamiltonian, are Hermitean, so their
difference ıH
D H 0  H , called perturbation Hamiltonian, is Hermitean as
well. Also, it is assumed that H and H 0 are real, and that ıH does not act on
time; however, it is ıH D ıH .t/ because the perturbation is present only when
0  t  tP.
For t < 0 and t > tP the wave function is unperturbed; remembering the concepts
introduced in Sect. 9.2 and considering the case of discrete eigenvalues, it reads
 D
X
n
cn wn.r/ exp.i En t=„/ ;
(14.1)
with wn the solutions of H wn D En wn. As usual, n stands for a single index or a
set of indices. For the sake of simplicity, here it is assumed provisionally that the
energy eigenvalues are not degenerate, so that a one-to-one correspondence exists
between En and wn; this assumption will be removed later (Sect. 14.5). The wave
function is assumed to be square integrable and normalized to unity, whence jcnj2
is the probability that the particle under consideration is found in the nth state, and
hwsjwni D ısn. As noted above, expansion (14.1) holds for both t < 0 and t > tP.
However, prior to the perturbation and as a consequence of a measurement, the
additional information about the energy state is available; assuming that the outcome
of the measurement was the rth state, it follows (Sect. 9.2) that for t < 0 it is cn D 0
when n ¤ r, and1

When t ! 0 the last relation in (14.2) yields  .r; t D 0/ D wr which, by continuity,
provides the initial condition for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to be
solved in the interval 0  t  tP; such an equation reads

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
As mentioned above, the solution of the Schrödinger equation for t > tP is (14.1),
with jcnj2 the probability that a measurement carried out at t D tP yields the
eigenvalue En. The coefﬁcients cn are found by observing that after the solution
of (14.6) or (14.8) is calculated, the time-continuity of  and the uniqueness of
the expansion yield cn D an.tP/. It follows that the probability that at t D tP an
energy measurement ﬁnds the eigenvalue Es is jas.tP/j2. On the other hand, the
energy state prior to the perturbation was assumed to be Er, and the functions an.t/
inherit this assumption through the initial condition an.0/ D ınr; as a consequence,
the quantity jas.tP/j2 D jbs.tP/j2 can be thought of as the probability that the
perturbation brings the particle from the initial state Er to the ﬁnal state Es: for
this reason, Prs D jas.tP/j2 is called transition probability from state r to state s.
Thanks to the normalization condition it is P

R
 j .tP/j2 d3r D 1; the term
of equal indices, Prr, is the probability that the perturbation leaves the particle’s state
unchanged.
The two forms (14.6) and (14.8) are equivalent to each other; however, the second
one is better suited for an iterative-solution procedure, that reads

To start the procedure it is necessary to choose the iterate of order zero, a.0/

which is typically done by letting a.0/
n .t/ D a.0/
n .0/ D ınr; in other terms, the initial

Considering the case where the initial and ﬁnal states are different, and observing

In conclusion, the ﬁrst-order solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equa-

„2 jFhrsj2 :
(14.12)
The units of hns are those of an energy. It follows that the units of Fhrs are those
of an action, and Prs is dimensionless, as expected. Some important consequences
derive from (14.12):
1. It may happen that for a given perturbation Hamiltonian ıH the eigenfunctions
wr, ws (s ¤ r) are such that hrs D 0. In this case ıH is not able to induce
the transition from state r to state s: the transition is forbidden. Basing on this
observation one can determine the pairs of indices for which the transitions are
permitted, thus providing the so-called transition rules or selection rules. For
this analysis it is sufﬁcient to consider the symmetry of the integrand in the
deﬁnition (14.7) of hrs, without the need of calculating the integral itself.
2. By exchanging r and s one ﬁnds hsr D h
rs, while !rs becomes !rs. From (14.11)
it follows that Fhsr D .Fhrs/, whence Psr D Prs: for a given perturbation
Hamiltonian ıH the probability of the r ! s and s ! r transitions are the
same.
The transition from an energy state to a different one entails a change in the total
energy of the particle under consideration. Such a change is due to the interaction
with another particle or system of particles whence ıH originates. Examples are
given in Sects. 14.8.1 and 14.8.2.
The replacement of the integration limits 0 and tP with 1 and C1, carried out
above, has the advantage of making the presence of the Fourier transform clearer;
however, remembering that the duration tP of the perturbation is ﬁnite, one observes
that the probability Prs is a function of tP proper. From this, the probability per unit
time of the transition is deﬁned as

Degenerate Energy Levels
In Sect. 14.2 nondegenerate energy levels have been assumed for the sake of
simplicity. The case of degenerate levels is considered here, still assuming that the
indices are discrete. By way of example, let each energy value En correspond to a
set wn1; : : : ; wn; : : : of linearly independent, mutually orthogonal eigenfunctions.
An example of this is given by the eigenvalues (13.56) of the Schrödinger equation
for a central force of the Coulomb type, whose degree of degeneracy in the spinless
case is given by (13.57). Expression (14.1) of the unperturbed wave function, that
holds for t < 0 and t > tP, becomes in this case

probability that the particle under consideration is found in the state labeled by
n; , and hwsˇjwni D ısn ıˇ. Prior to the perturbation and as a consequence
of measurements, the additional information about the energy state is available,
along with that of the observable associated with index , whose measurement
is compatible with that of energy (compare with Sect. 10.4); assuming that the
outcome of the measurements was the state labeled r; ˛, it follows that for t < 0
it is cr˛ D 1,  D wr˛.r/ exp.i Er t=„/, while all other coefﬁcients vanish. As
a consequence, the initial condition for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation
to be solved in the interval 0  t  tP is  .r; t D 0/ D wr˛. Following

Screened Coulomb Perturbation
An important case of perturbation is that of a charged particle deﬂected by another
charged particle ﬁxed in the origin. The perturbation Hamiltonian is independent of
time and, in vacuo, takes the form (3.31) of the Coulomb potential energy.2 Though,
2This case is the quantum analogue of that treated in classical terms in Sect. 3.8.

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
the perturbation matrix (14.24) calculated using (3.31) diverges. Such an outcome
is explained by observing that as the vanishing behavior of the Coulomb potential
energy away from the origin is weak, the particle is actually subjected to it at large
distances from the origin; as a consequence, using the free particle’s eigenfunctions
exp.i k  r/=.2 /3=2 as solutions of the unperturbed Schrödinger equation is too
strong an approximation. A more appropriate approach adopts for the perturbation
Hamiltonian the screened Coulomb potential energy

with e > 0 the elementary electric charge, Z a positive integer, "0 the vacuum
permittivity, qc > 0 the inverse screening length, and, ﬁnally,  D 1 .1/ in the
repulsive (attractive) case. The asymptotic vanishing of (14.33) is much stronger
than that of the pure Coulomb case, and the resulting matrix elements are ﬁnite,
as shown below. Although the choice of a screened potential energy is not realistic
in vacuo, an expression like (14.33) is more appropriate than (3.31) when a solid
material is considered (Sect. 20.5).
To calculate (14.24) one lets q D k  g and chooses a Cartesian reference such
that q is aligned with the z axis: turning to spherical coordinates (B.1) transforms

The form of f.!rs/=tP suggests that if tP is sufﬁciently large, such a ratio may be
approximated with a Dirac delta (Sect. C.4), namely, f.!rs/  2  tP ı.!rs/, where
the coefﬁcient 2  tP is chosen for consistency with (14.37). To this purpose one also
notes that due to the smallness of „, the modulus of !rs D .Er  Es/=„ is very large

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
This shows that the particle’s energy is approximately conserved when the pertur-
bation lasts for a long time. The result is intuitive, because in the limit tP ! 1 a
constant perturbation is equivalent to a shift in the potential energy, which makes the
Hamiltonian operator conservative at all times. On the other hand, the conservation
of energy does not imply the conservation of other dynamic quantities like, e.g.,
momentum (compare with the analysis of the two-particle collision carried out in
classical terms in Sect. 3.6 and in quantum terms in Sects. 14.6 and 17.8).

namely, the modulus of momentum is also conserved. The result is the same as in the
case of the classical treatment of a particle’s collision with another particle having a
much larger mass (Sect. 3.6).
14.8.4
Transitions from Discrete to Continuous Levels
The transition probability is calculated following a reasoning similar to that of
Sect. 14.5 also in the case where the initial state is labeled by a discrete index and the
ﬁnal state belongs to a continuous set. A physical situation where such a transition
may occur is that of a particle initially trapped within a well: with reference to
Sect. 11.5, the energy levels are discrete if E < 0, whereas they are continuous for
E > 0, namely, the spectrum is mixed (Sect. 8.4). A particle whose initial state
belongs to the discrete set may absorb from the perturbation an amount of energy
sufﬁcient for reaching the continuous set of states, thus leaving the well. As the ﬁnal
energy belongs to a continuous set, the outcome of the calculation is the expression
of an inﬁnitesimal probability like in Sect. 14.6.

unspeciﬁed. From the deﬁnition (14.45) it follows that ıH is Hermitean. Deﬁning

Like in the case of (14.43), the arguments of the ı symbols in (14.51) cannot vanish

„ !q < Ek, namely, the particle undergoing the transition emits the quantum of
energy „ !k. If the second argument vanishes it is Ek0 D EkC„ !q > Ek, namely, the
particle undergoing the transition absorbs the quantum of energy „ !q. This results
may be viewed in two ways: if the particle is considered on its own, the result of
the perturbation is that the particle energy is either increased by the amount „ !k
(absorption) or decreased by the same amount (emission). If, instead, the system
made of the particle and the perturbing agent is viewed as a whole, the result of the
perturbation is the exchange of the energy „ !q between the two parts of the system,
whose total energy is conserved.
The result established by (14.50) and (14.51) is based upon the obvious assump-
tion that states Ek and Ek0 exist, namely, that they are eigenvalues of the unperturbed
Hamiltonian of the particle under investigation. It follows that an energy transition
of the particle may occur only if, within its energy spectrum, there exist two states

fulﬁlling the relation Ek  Ek0 D j„ !qj. If they do not exist, the arguments of the ı
symbols in (14.50) or (14.51) never vanish and no transition occurs. In other terms,
the particle is not able to exchange energy with the perturbing agent. This apparently
surprising result is due to the limit P ! 1. In fact, in the limit the frequency
spectrum of the perturbation becomes monochromatic and only the energy „ !q
becomes available. Without the limit P ! 1 the transition probability per unit
time is found by taking the derivative of (14.48) with respect to tP. The resulting
spectrum extends over all frequencies; correspondingly, there are much more pairs
of states Ek and Ek0 between which the particle may undergo a transition due to the
interaction with the perturbing agent, albeit with different probabilities. The analysis
above applies in the same manner to the results of Sects. 14.8.1 and 14.8.2.

concepts that will be illustrated in more detail in Sect. 17.5.1. When the Hamiltonian
operator is periodic, the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed problem have the form of
Bloch functions, so that the expansion of the wave function takes the form (17.51).
In the following, the Bloch functions belonging to a given branch of the dispersion

Selection Rules
It has been found in Sect. 14.8.6 that when the spatial part of the perturbation has
a plane-wave form, the connection among the state of the electron before (k) and
after (k0) the perturbation, and the wave vector kd of the perturbing wave, is given
by (14.67). One in fact assumes that k and kd are given, whereas k0 is to be found
from (14.67). Therefore, the relation is a selection rule for the possible ﬁnal states;
as g is an arbitrary translation vector, many ﬁnal states are possible. The number
of allowed transitions is strongly reduced by the constraint that k, k0, and kd belong
to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Sect. 17.4). In this case (compare with (17.37)),

A similar expression holds for k0, with ns replaced by another integer n0

then the selection rule for the sth axis is fulﬁlled with s D 1 and n0

As a consequence, the eight combinations shown in Table 14.2 are possible. In all
cases the values of s and n0
s are unique once ns and ds are given. In other terms,
for a given pair of vectors k, kd of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, the only g vectors that
make k0 to belong to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone as well are those listed in Table 14.1 or
Table 14.2. If vector g is null, then the transition from k to k0 is called an N-process
(“N” stands for “normal”). If g is different from zero, then the transition is called a
U-process (“U” stands for Umklapp, meaning “ﬂip over”). Note that a process may
be either N or U depending on how the scaled reciprocal space is divided into cells.7
The selection rules may also be considered from another viewpoint, namely,
that of prescribing the initial state k and the ﬁnal state k0 of the transition, and
determining the pairs kd, g that make the transition possible. As before, the

Systems of Interacting Particles:
Quantum Statistics

Chapter 15
Many-Particle Systems
15.1
Introduction
This chapter illustrates the properties of many-particle systems. The quantum-
mechanical description of the latter is obtained by solving the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation. After commenting the simpliﬁcations that occur when the
Hamiltonian operator is separable, the important issue of the symmetry or anti-
symmetry of the wave function is introduced for the purpose of illustrating the
peculiar properties possessed by the systems of identical particles. Then, the concept
of spin and the exclusion principle are introduced. After a general discussion,
the above concepts are applied to the important case of a conservative system,
and further properties related to the separability of the Hamiltonian operator are
worked out. The remaining part of the chapter is devoted to the derivation of
the equilibrium statistics in the quantum case (Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein
statistics). The connection between the microscopic statistical concepts and the
macroscopic thermodynamic properties is illustrated in the complements, where two
important examples of calculation of the density of states are also given.

Wave Function of a Many-Particle System
The quantum-mechanical concepts outlined in Parts II and III dealt with wave
functions  describing a single particle. In such a case, if  is normalized to
unity, the product j .r; t/j2 d3r is the inﬁnitesimal probability that at time t the
particle’s position belongs to the elementary volume d3r D dx dy dz centered on r;
speciﬁcally, the x coordinate belongs to dx, and so on. It is now necessary to extend
the treatment to the case of many-particle systems. This is readily accomplished by
considering, ﬁrst, a system made of two particles: the wave function  describing
such a system depends on two sets of coordinates, r1, r2, and time. The ﬁrst set

where

is a short-hand notation for a six-fold integral over dx1 : : : dz2. Then, the
product j .r1; r2; t/j2 d3r1 d3r2 is the inﬁnitesimal probability that at time t, set r1
belongs to d3r1 and set r2 belongs to d3r2. The wave function in (15.1) is the solution
of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation

(15.2)
where the initial condition  0 is prescribed. In turn, the Hamiltonian operator
in (15.2) is derived, following the procedure illustrated in Sect. 10.2, from the
Hamiltonian function that describes the two-particle system in the classical case.
Considering by way of example a case where the forces acting on the two particles
derive from a potential energy V D V.r1; r2; t/, the Hamiltonian function and the
Hamiltonian operator read, respectively,

It may happen that the Hamiltonian operator is separable with respect to the two
sets r1, r2, namely, H D H1 C H2 such that H1 does not contain any component
of r2 and H2 does not contain any component1 of r1. Also, let  1 D  1.r1; t/,

the units of  depend on the number of particles involved; speciﬁcally, in (15.6) it is
Œ  D cm3 N=2 (compare with the discussion of Sect. 9.7.1).
15.3
Symmetry of Functions and Operators
The Hamiltonian operator and the wave function describing a many-particle system
contain sets of coordinates like r1, r2 : : :. It is important to introduce a number of
properties related to the exchange of two such sets within the operator or the wave
function. The problem is tackled ﬁrst in a rather abstract way; the applications to
speciﬁc cases of interest are shown in Sect. 15.6.
Consider a function f
D f.q1; q2; : : : ; qn/, where qk represents a group of
coordinates.2 Let Sij be an operator such that [96, Chap. XIV.3]
Sijf.q1; : : : ; qi; : : : ; qj; : : : ; qn/ D f.q1; : : : ; qj; : : : ; qi; : : : ; qn/ ;
(15.7)
namely, Sij exchanges the names of the ith and jth group, leaving the rest
unchanged. From the deﬁnition it follows S 2
ij D Sij Sij D I . Now, let  be
an eigenvalue of Sij, and w an eigenfunction corresponding to it: Sijw D w. The
following relations hold together:
S 2
ij w D w ;
S 2
ij w D 2w ;
(15.8)
the ﬁrst due to the general property shown before, the second to the deﬁnition of
 and w. As a consequence,  D ˙1, namely, Sij has two eigenvalues. As their
modulus equals unity, Sij is unitary (Sect. 8.6.2), namely, S 1
ij
D S 
ij .
The properties of the operator’s eigenfunctions are found by letting ws D Sijw,
so that ws is the function that results from exchanging the names of the ith and jth
group of coordinates. Depending on the eigenvalue, two cases are possible: the ﬁrst
one is  D C1, whence Sijw D C1  w and Sijw D ws hold together, so that
ws D w; the second case is  D 1, whence Sijw D 1  w and Sijw D ws hold
2A “group” of coordinates may also consist of a single coordinate.

Many-Particle Systems
together, so that ws D w. A function such that ws D w is called symmetric with
respect to indices ij, while a function such that ws D w is called antisymmetric
with respect to indices ij. In conclusion,
•
all symmetric functions are eigenfunctions of Sij belonging to  D C1;
•
all antisymmetric functions are eigenfunctions of Sij belonging to  D 1.
The set of eigenfunctions of Sij is complete; in fact, for any function f it is
f D 1
2 .f C Sijf/ C 1
2 .f  Sijf/ ;
(15.9)
where the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side is symmetric and the second one is
antisymmetric, so that both terms at the right-hand side are eigenfunctions of Sij.
This shows that any function is expressible as a linear combination of eigenfunction
of Sij.
Only a speciﬁc pair ij of coordinate groups has been considered so far. On the
other hand, it may happen that a function is symmetric (antisymmetric) with respect
to all pairs of indices; in this case it is called symmetric (antisymmetric) with no
further speciﬁcation.
The deﬁnitions above extend to operators. For instance, an operator A is
symmetric with respect to ij if A s D SijA D A ; it is symmetric without further
speciﬁcation if A s D A for any pair ij. Given a function f and an operator A , and
letting let f s D Sijf, it is for all f,
.A f/s D SijA f D SijA S 1
ij Sijf D A sf s :
(15.10)
If A is symmetric, replacing A s D A in (15.10) shows that SijA f D A Sijf
namely, Sij commutes with all symmetric operators.
The operator whose symmetry properties are of interest is typically the Hamil-
tonian one. Considering for instance a system of N particles interacting with each
other through Coulomb interactions in vacuo, one has

at all times. Now assume that  is the solution of a Schrödinger equation deriving
from a symmetric Hamiltonian operator, and that  is itself symmetric at some
instant t0 with respect to the pair ij. As the functions wk of (15.12) are linearly
independent, the symmetry of  entails that of wk for all k. As a consequence,
for the pair ij, wk is an eigenfunction of the operator Sij corresponding to  D
1. Combining (15.13) with the deﬁnition (10.13) of the expectation value of the
eigenvalues yields hi D 1 at t D t0. In turn, due to symmetry, H commutes
with Sij; this yields, for the time derivative (10.27) of the average value of the
eigenvalues of Sij,

(15.14)
namely, hi is conserved in time. The above calculation can be summarized as
follows:
•
Given a symmetric Hamiltonian H , select a pair of indices ij. Due to commu-
tativity, a complete set of eigenfunctions wk of H exists, that belongs also to
operator Sij.
•
The eigenfunctions wk of H can thus be separated into two sets, made of
symmetric and antisymmetric functions, respectively.
•
Let  .q1; : : : ; t/ D P
k ak.t/wk.q1; : : :/ be the wave function of the system
described by H , and let  be symmetric at some instant t0. It follows that
the nonvanishing coefﬁcients ak.t0/ in the expansion of  .q1; : : : ; qn; t0/ are only
those multiplying the symmetric eigenfunctions.
As hi D
R
  Sij  dq1 : : : qn D 1 at all times, the expansion of  is made in
terms of the symmetric wks at all times. Hence,  is always symmetric with respect
to the groups of coordinates of indices ij. The above reasoning can be repeated
for all pairs of indices for which  is symmetric. Note that, in order to repeat the
reasoning for different pairs of indices, say, ij and jk, one needs not assume that the

corresponding operators Sij, Sjk commute with each other (in fact, they typically
do not commute). The analysis holds equally for the case where  , at time t0, is
antisymmetric with respect to two indices. In such case, it remains antisymmetric at
all times with respect to them.
15.5
Identical Particles
It is interesting to ascertain whether the mathematical properties related to symmetry
or antisymmetry, brieﬂy discussed in Sects. 15.3 and 15.4, correspond to some
physical property. This is indeed so, and is especially important when a system of
identical particles is considered.
Take for instance a system of two identical particles interacting with each other.3
In classical terms, the two identical objects that form the system can always be
made distinguishable from each other, without disturbing their motion. The typical
example is that of two identical billiard balls that are made distinguishable by
a different coloring; although the latter has no inﬂuence on the balls’ dynamics,
it allows one to distinguish them from each other irrespective of the number of
collisions they undergo. As a consequence, the conjugate variables describing the
motion of each particle (e.g., position and momentum) are exactly known at each
instant of time. By way of example consider the collision of two identical, charged
particles schematically illustrated in Fig. 15.1: it is assumed that the particles are
initially far apart, with equal moduli of the initial velocities; the initial velocity of
the particle labeled 1 is described by the upper-left arrow visible in cases a and b
of the ﬁgure, while the initial velocity of the particle labeled 2 is described by the
lower-right arrow. As they come closer, the particles repel each other due to the

15.5
Identical Particles
307
Coulomb interaction, and their classical motion is described as in Sects. 3.5–3.8.
If the initial velocities were exactly aligned (this case is not shown in the ﬁgure),
the two particles would bounce back along the same direction; if, however, the
initial velocity of particle 1 was slightly misaligned to the left, the collision would
yield case a, whereas it would yield case b for a right misalignment. Even if the
misalignment is made as small as we please, either case a or b occurs, and the two
possible outcomes are distinguishable from each other.
In the quantum-mechanical description, instead, it is not possible to track each
particle separately, because the information about the system’s dynamics derives
from the wave function; when the particles come closer, the norm of the wave
function in (15.1) is signiﬁcantly different from zero in a ﬁnite region of space,
which is schematically indicated by the circle of case c in Fig. 15.1. Due to
the Heisenberg principle (10.22), it is impossible to determine the position and
momentum of each particle at the same time with arbitrary precision. It follows
that, for identical particles, the collision is described as an event where two particles
enter the circle and two particles eventually leave it, without the possibility of
distinguishing between cases a and b: the two cases must in fact be counted as
one, and the wave function describing the system must be consistent with it. This
requires j j2 be symmetric with respect to the groups r1; r2:
j sj2 D jS12 j2 D j j2 ;
(15.15)
which implies  s
D exp.i˛/  with ˛ a real constant. On the other hand,
remembering the ﬁrst equation in (15.8),
S 2
12 D exp.2 i˛/  ;
S 2
12 D  ;
(15.16)
whence exp.j˛/ D ˙1. In conclusion, when the two particles of the system are
indistinguishable from each other, the system’s wave function is either symmetric
or antisymmetric. One may argue that when the system is made of more than
two identical particles, its wave function could be symmetric with respect to some
pairs of indices and antisymmetric with respect to other pairs. However, this is not
possible, as the simple case of three identical particles shows [86, Sect. 26]. Assume
that  is symmetric with respect to r1; r2 and antisymmetric with respect to r1; r3;
it follows
 .r1; r2; r3; t/ D  .r2; r1; r3; t/ D  .r2; r3; r1; t/ D  .r1; r3; r2; t/ D
(15.17)
D  .r3; r1; r2; t/ D  .r3; r2; r1; t/ D  .r1; r2; r3; t/ ;
(15.18)
that is, a contradiction. In other terms,  can either be symmetric with respect to all
the identical particles of the system, or antisymmetric with respect to all of them.
This result has a far-reaching consequence, namely, the class of all particles is made
of two subclasses: the ﬁrst one collects the types of particles whose systems are
www.ebook3000.com

308
15
Many-Particle Systems
described by symmetric wave functions; they are called Bose particles or bosons.
The second subclass collects the types of particles whose systems are described
by antisymmetric wave functions; they are called Fermi particles or fermions. This
applies to all known particles, including composite ones (e.g., atoms) and particles
describing collective motions (e.g., phonons, photons).4
15.5.1
Spin
The properties discussed so far in this section bring about an interesting question:
consider a single particle, e.g., an electron. Although electrons are fermions,5 here
the concept of symmetry or antisymmetry does not apply because the wave function
of a single electron contains only one group of coordinates. Then add a second
electron, so that a system of two identical particles is formed: how do these electrons
“know” that, when paired, the wave function of their system must be antisymmetric?
It is reasonable to assume that each particle in itself must possess a property that
makes it to behave like a fermion or a boson within a system of particles identical
to it. Such a property, called spin, does in fact exist; as its existence can be proven
only within the frame of the relativistic quantum theory [42, 43], [124, Sect. 15],
which is beyond the scope if this book, only a brief illustration of spin’s properties
of interest will be given.
In contrast with the other dynamic quantities considered so far, there is no
classical counterpart of spin. Therefore, the latter cannot be derived from the
expression of a dynamic variable by replacing conjugate coordinates with suitable
operators. It can be shown that the eigenvalues of spin are derived in a manner
similar to that of angular momentum: this leads, like in Sect. 13.5.1, to determining
the square modulus of spin, 2, and its component along one of the coordinate axes,
say, z. Their values are given by expressions similar to (13.53), speciﬁcally,
S2 D „2 s .s C 1/ ;
Sz D „ sz :
(15.19)
The important difference with (13.53) is that s, instead of being a nonnegative
integer, is a nonnegative half integer: s D 0; 1
2; 1; 3
2; 2; : : :; in turn, sz can take the
2 s C 1 values s; s C 1; : : : ; s  1; s.
The introduction of spin must be accounted for in the expression of the wave
function: the latter, in the case of a single particle, must be indicated with  .r; sz; t/,
and its normalization to unity, if existing, is expressed by
4The names “bosons,” “fermions” of the two subclasses have this origin: when a system of identical
particles is in thermodynamic equilibrium, the particles’ energy follows a statistical distribution
whose expression is named after Bose and Einstein (Sect. 15.8.2) and, respectively, Fermi and
Dirac (Sect. 15.8.1).
5It must be noted, however, that in condensed-matter physics two electrons or other fermions may
bind together at low temperatures to form a so-called Cooper pair, which turns out to have an
integer spin, namely, it is a composite boson [30].

If (15.20) holds, the product j .r; sz; t/j2 d3r is the probability that at time t the
particle is in the elementary volume d3r centered on r, and the component of its
spin along the z axis is Sz D „ sz.
The connection between spin and boson-like or fermion-like behavior is the
following: the quantum number s is integer for bosons, half integer for fermions
[101]. It is then meaningful to use the terms “boson” or “fermion” for an individual
particle. All known fermions have s D 1=2, whence 2 s C 1 D 2. It follows that for
fermions the z-component of spin has two possible values, „=2 (spin up) and „=2
(spin down). As anticipated above, electrons are fermions. Photons are bosons with
s D 1.
The similarity between the expressions of the quantum numbers for spin and
those of the angular momentum (Eqs. (13.53) cited above) is the origin of the
qualitative visualization of spin in classical terms: spin is described as an intrinsic
angular momentum of the particle, as if the particle was a sphere spinning on its
axis.
15.6
Pauli Exclusion Principle
Consider a system of identical particles, so that its Hamiltonian operator H is
symmetric with respect to each pair of particle labels ij. Its wave function, in turn, is
either symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the nature of the particles forming
the system. It may happen that when solving the Schrödinger equation of the system,
a solution is found, say ', that does not possess the necessary symmetry properties.
One can then exploit a relation like (15.9) to construct from ' another solution
which is either symmetric or antisymmetric. For this, one must remember that '
depends on the groups of coordinates .r1; sz1/, .r2; sz2/; : : : which, for the sake of
conciseness, will be indicated with the symbol qi D .ri; szi/. Remembering from
Sect. 15.3 that the Hamiltonian operator, due to its symmetries, commutes with any
operator Sij, one ﬁnds

(15.21)
where Sij exchanges qi with qj. The parenthesis on the left-hand side of (15.21) is
zero because ' solves the Schrödinger equation; it follows that 's is also a solution.
Due to the linearity of the Schrödinger equation, the two functions

are solutions of the Schrödinger equation, which are also symmetric and, respec-
tively, antisymmetric with respect to the pair ij. The procedure is easily generalized
to obtain a wave function that is symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to all pairs
of indices. To this purpose, one considers the NŠ permutations of the system’s N
particles; let  be an index representing the order of each permutation with respect
to the fundamental one (1    NŠ), and S the operator that achieves the th
permutation of the particles’ coordinates within '. The functions
 D a

 D b


.1/S'
(15.23)
are solutions of the Schrödinger equation, which are also symmetric and, respec-
tively, antisymmetric with respect to all particles’ permutations. Symbols a and
b denote two constants, that can be used to normalize  if ' is normalizable.
The above constructions can be worked out at any instant, as the symmetry or
antisymmetry of the wave function is conserved in time (Sect. 15.4). The second
relation in (15.23) lends itself to an interesting derivation. Considering for simplicity
the case N D 2 one ﬁnds
 D b Œ'.r1; sz1; r2; sz2; t/  '.r2; sz2; r1; sz2; t/ ;
(15.24)
If it were r2 D r1, sz2 D sz1, the wave function (15.24) would vanish, which is not
acceptable. The same unphysical results are found by letting rj D ri, szj D szi in
the second expression in (15.23). The conclusion is that in a system of identical
fermions, two (or more) particles with the same spin cannot occupy the same
position; this ﬁnding derives solely from the antisymmetry of the wave function for
a system of identical fermions, and is called Pauli principle or exclusion principle.6
As shown in Sect. 15.7 it can be restated in different forms depending on the system
under consideration. No similar restriction applies to systems of identical bosons,
as the form of the ﬁrst relation in (15.23) shows.
15.7
Conservative Systems of Particles
An important example of a system of N interacting particles occurs when the
forces are conservative. To begin, the general case of nonidentical particles is
considered. The Hamiltonian function and the corresponding Hamiltonian operator
read, respectively:
6Like the Heisenberg principle illustrated in Sect. 10.6, that of Pauli was originally deduced from
heuristic arguments. The analysis of this section shows in fact that it is a theorem rather than a
principle.

where index n.i/ denotes the nth eigenvalue of the ith particle. From the general
properties of operators (Sect. 10.3) it follows that each eigenfunction of the whole
system is the product of eigenfunctions like wn.i/,
W D wn.1/.q1/ wn.2/.q2/ : : : wn.N/.qN/ ;
(15.29)
and the eigenvalue of H is the sum of eigenvalues like En.i/:

(15.30)
If the particles are identical, m1 D m2 D : : : D mN, then the single-particle Hamilto-
nian operators Hi become identical to each other; as a consequence, each eigenvalue
equation like (15.28) produces the same set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. It
follows that all NŠ permutations of the indices 1; 2; : : : ; N in (15.30) leave the total
energy unchanged. On the other hand, as for any pair of groups qr, qs it is
wn.r/.qr/ wn.s/.qs/ ¤ wn.s/.qr/ wn.r/.qs/ ;
(15.31)
the total eigenfunction is changed by a permutation of the coordinate indices. Thus,
to ES there correspond NŠ eigenfunctions w, namely, the eigenvalues of H W D E W
for a system of identical particles are NŠ-fold degenerate.

As noted in Sect. 15.6, the solution (15.26) of the system’s Schrödinger equation

When the wave function has the form (15.32) or (15.33), and the eigenfunctions

that is called Slater determinant. A transposition of two particles involves the
exchange of the corresponding coordinate sets, but not of the eigenfunction indices;

15.8

this is equivalent to exchanging two rows of the determinant, whence the change
of sign. Also, if two or more particles belonged to the same state (including spin),
two or more columns of the Slater determinant would be equal to each other and
the wave function (15.33) would vanish. This is another form of the proof of Pauli’s
exclusion principle.
15.8
Equilibrium Statistics in the Quantum Case
This section illustrates the quantum-mechanical treatment of a system of particles in
a condition of macroscopic equilibrium. The approach is the same as that outlined
in Sect. 6.3 for the classical case; however, the constraints to which the particles
are subjected are different. Here the term “particle” is used in a broader meaning,
incorporating, e.g., also the case of photons (Sect. 12.3) and phonons (Sect. 16.6).
As in Sect. 6.3 one considers a conservative system of identical particles, having a
total energy ES, enclosed in a stationary container of volume . The conservation
of the total energy introduces a ﬁrst constraint, identical to (6.10):
FE.N1; N2; : : :/ D 0 ;

(15.39)
describing the conservation of the total number of particles, may, instead, be fulﬁlled
or not depending on the type of particles. For instance, a system of photons does
not fulﬁll it: in fact, a photon may be absorbed by the container’s wall and, say,
two photons may be emitted by it, such that the energy of the emitted photons
equals that of the absorbed one. In this way, constraint (15.38) applies, whereas
constraint (15.39) does not. Another difference from the classical treatment is that,
as remarked in Sect. 15.5, identical quantum particles belonging to a system are not
distinguishable from each other; as a consequence, the method of counting their
placement into the cells of the phase space (illustrated in Sect. 6.3 for the classical
case) is different here. A further distinction must be made between the cases of
systems made of fermions, to which the exclusion principle applies, and systems
made of bosons, to which it does not apply. To appreciate the strong differences
that are introduced by the constraints due to indistinguishability and exclusion, the
example below is of help.
Consider a system made of three identical particles, whose total energy ES is,
in some units , equal to 3 . For simplicity, the particles are considered spinless

Fig. 15.2 Placement of three identical particles into equally spaced energy states. The particles’
total energy equals three energy units . Different graphic symbols are used for the particles to
make the classical treatment clearer
and, instead of the phase space, a space made of energy cells7 is used, where the
energies of the particles are assumed to be quantized starting from a ground level.
As a consequence, the energies allowed to the particles are 0, , 2 , 3 ; : : :; the
energy levels are shown in Fig. 15.2, where the particles are drawn with different
graphics to make them provisionally distinguishable. If the system is considered
as classical, it is easily found that there are ten possible ways of placing the three
particles into the available states in such a way as to fulﬁll the energy constraint
ES D 3 . One way is to place all three particles in the  state. Another choice is
to place one particle in the 3  state and the remaining two in the ground state; this
provides three different ways, as there are three distinct possibilities to choose the
particle to be placed in the 3  state. The last choice is to place one particle in the
ground state, another particle in the  state, and the remaining one in the 2  state;
this yields 3Š ways as shown in the ﬁgure. If, instead, the particles are bosons, the
three former combinations with energies .0; 0; 3/ reduce to a single one because of
the particles’ indistinguishability; by the same token, the six former combinations
with energies .0; ; 2/ reduce to a single one as well. This gives a total of three
ways for bosons, in contrast with the ten ways of the classical particles. Finally, if
the particles are fermions, the combinations .; ; / and .0; 0; 3/ must be excluded
because the exclusion principle forbids one or more fermions to occupy the same
state; as a consequence, the only way left for fermions is .0; ; 2/ that fulﬁlls both
indistinguishability and exclusion.
Coming back to the general case, consider a system in thermodynamic equi-
librium at temperature T, with ES the system’s total energy. As in the classical
case outlined in Sect. 6.3, the system is considered dilute, namely such that the
mutual interaction among the particles, albeit necessary for the existence of the
system, is weak enough to assume that the energy of the interaction among the
particles is negligible within the Hamiltonian operator. It follows that the latter is
separable, and the expressions found in Sect. 15.7 are applicable. As the particles are
identical, the single-particle eigenvalues En.i/ and eigenfunctions wn.i/.qi/ obtained
7The use of energy intervals does not entail a loss of generality, as the subsequent treatment of the
general case will show.

by solving (15.28) are the same for all particles. Also, the indices8 n.i/ are those
of an energy, so that the procedure of placing the particles into the available
states can be carried out directly in the energy space. To account for spin, states
corresponding to the same energy and different spin are to be considered as distinct.
The minimum eigenvalue of (15.28) is ﬁxed by the form of the potential energy
within the Hamiltonian operator. Given these premises, the energy axis is divided
into equal intervals of length E; as in the classical case, the partitioning has the
advantage that the set of intervals is countable. The intervals are numbered starting
from the one containing the minimum eigenvalue mentioned above, and their size
E is such that each of them contains a number of eigenvalues of (15.28). Let gr be
the number of eigenvalues within the rth interval, r D 1; 2 : : :, and Nr the number
of particles whose eigenvalues belong to the same interval; if the size E is taken
small, one can approximate the energy of the Nr particles with the product Nr Er,
where Er is the energy at the interval’s center. Following the same procedure as in
Sect. 6.4, one then constructs the function
F.N1; N2; : : : ; ˛; ˇ/ D log W C ˛ FN C ˇ FE ;
(15.40)
where ˛, ˇ are the Lagrange multipliers, respectively, related to the total number of
particles and total energy of the system, and the form of W depends on the type of
particles, as shown below. If the constraint on the total number of particles is not
applicable, one lets ˛ D 0. Using the numbers N1, N2; : : : as continuous variables,
taking the derivative of F with respect to Nr, and equating it to zero yield
@
@Nr
log W D ˛ C ˇ Er :
(15.41)
On the other hand, it is W D W1 W2 : : : ; Wr : : :, where Wr is the number of ways
in which Nr particles can be placed into the gr states of the rth interval, subjected to
the constraints of the type of particles under consideration. As in the left-hand side
of (15.41) only the rth summand depends on Nr, the relation to be worked out is
eventually
@
@Nr
log Wr D ˛ C ˇ Er :
(15.42)
The expression of Wr depends on the type of particles; it is given in Sect. 15.8.1 for
the case of fermions and in Sect. 15.8.2 for that of bosons.
8Here the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are discrete because the system is enclosed in a
container, hence the wave function is normalizable. As usual, the notation n.i/ stands for a group
of indices.

For a system of fermions it is Nr  gr due to the exclusion principle. To calculate the
number of ways of placing Nr particles into gr states one provisionally assumes that
the particles are distinguishable. There are gr possibilities to place the ﬁrst particle;
after the latter has been placed, there remain gr  1 states due to the exclusion
principle, hence the different ways of placing the ﬁrst two (distinct) particles are
gr .gr  1/. The process continues until all Nr particles are used up, thus leading to

also the meaning of occupation probability of a state at energy E. Its high-energy
tail (EEF  kB T) identiﬁes with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law (6.14).
The dependence of (15.49) on E is shown in Fig. 15.3 at different temperatures.
The states whose energy is substantially lower than the Fermi level (E  EF 

dependence of EF on T is not considered in the ﬁgure; in fact, it is inﬂuenced by the
form of g.E/ and must therefore be determined on a case-by-case basis. A discussion
about this issue is found in [70, Sect. 8.6] and is summarized in Prob. 15.2. In the
limit T ! 0 the function becomes discontinuous, speciﬁcally it is P D 1 for E < EF

Connection with Thermodynamic Functions
The calculation of the equilibrium distribution carried out in Sects. 6.4, 15.8.1,
and 15.8.2 respectively for classical particles, fermions, and bosons, entails the
maximization of the function log W, subjected to suitable constraints. On the
other hand, from the second principle of Thermodynamics one derives that the
equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the condition that the system’s entropy
S has a maximum. For this reason one expects that a functional dependence W.S/
exists; to identify its form one notes that if W1 and W2 indicate the value of W

Density of States for a Particle in a Three-Dimensional

the number of states per unit energy. Its form depends on the system under
consideration. Two examples of the derivation of g.E/ are given here (with reference

The problem of the particle conﬁned within a one-dimensional box has been
tackled in Sect. 8.2.2. The set of eigenvalues is given by the ﬁrst relation in (8.6),
and the corresponding eigenfunctions are (8.8). For a three-dimensional box whose
sides have lengths d1, d2, d3, due to the properties of separable operators (Sect. 10.3),
the eigenfunctions are products of one-dimensional eigenfunctions,

the one-dimensional case, the eigenvalues (15.61) are degenerate, because different
triads n1, n2, n3 correspond to the same energy.
The density of states could be calculated by the procedure depicted in Sect. (B.5),
with the provision that in this case the variables kni belong to a discrete set whereas
those in Sect. B.5 are continuous. On the other hand, the relations involved here
are simple enough to be tackled by a direct calculation. One observes, ﬁrst, that
the distance between two consecutive projections of k along the ith axis is =di;
as a consequence, one may partition the k1k2k3 space into equal volumes13 3=V,
so that each k vector is associated with one and only one volume: this shows that
the density of k vectors in the k1 k2 k3 space is Qk D V=3. Given the electron’s
energy E, from the geometrical point of view the ﬁrst relation in (15.62) describes
a sphere of radius .2 m E=„2/1=2 in the k1 k2 k3 space; thus, the total number Nk of
3=V volumes contained within the sphere is obtained by multiplying the sphere’s
volume by the density Qk. Clearly the volumes that are near the boundary produce
a ragged surface; the latter is identiﬁed with that of the sphere by assuming that the
distribution of k vectors belonging to the spherical surface is very dense. With this
provision one ﬁnds

the electron a fourth quantum number is necessary, related to spin (Sect. 15.5.1).
Remembering that electrons have two possible spin states, one ﬁnds that the number
of electron states within the sphere is twice the number of k vectors, namely, Nk=4.
Finally, the number of states per unit energy is found by differentiating the latter

Density of States for a Two- or One-Dimensional Box
As observed in Sect. B.5, the functional dependence of g on E is inﬂuenced by the
number of spatial dimensions: considering by way of example the case of an electron
within a two-dimensional box, one must associate with each vector k an area of the
k1k2 space equal to 2=.d1 d2/ D 2=A, where A D d1 d2 is the area of the box. The
density of the k vectors in the k1k2 space is Qk D A=2, whence the total number
of 2=A areas in a circle of radius .2 m E=„2/1=2 is
Nk D Qk  k2 D A

(15.66)
As indices n1; n2 take only positive values, the k vectors belong to 1=4 of the circle
only; it follows that their number is Nk=4. Accounting for spin one ﬁnds that the
number of states within the circle is twice the number of k vectors, namely, Nk=2.
Finally, the number of states per unit energy is found by differentiating the latter
with respect to energy,

When the energy dependence on the k coordinates is quadratic, the density of states
of a two-dimensional case is constant (compare with (B.33)).

very densely. This makes it possible to treat E as a continuous variable.

Density of States for Photons
Consider the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within a box whose sides d1, d2, d3
are aligned with the coordinate axes and start from the origin. It is assumed that no
charge is present within the box, so that the calculation of the modes is the same as
that illustrated in Sect. 5.5. The wave vectors have the form

the angular frequency of the mode corresponding to k is ! D c k, with k the modulus
of k, and the energy of each photon of that mode is E D „ ! D „ c k, with c
the speed of light. The calculation of the density of states associated with this case
follows the same line as that used in Sect. 15.9.2 for a particle in a three-dimensional
box; the differences are that the distance between two consecutive projections of k
along the ith axis is 2=di instead of =di, the indices ni are not limited to the
positive values, and the E.k/ relation is linear instead of being quadratic.
With these premises, and with reference to Fig. 15.4, the volume associated with
each k is .2 /3=.d1 d2 d3/ D .2 /3=V, where V is the volume of the box, so that
the density of the k vectors in the k space is Qk D V=.2 /3; in turn, the total number
of k vectors within a sphere of radius k like that shown in the ﬁgure is15
15The calculation shown here is equivalent to counting the number of elements of volume
.2 /3=.d1 d2 d3/ that belong to the spherical shell drawn in Fig. 15.4. The result is then multiplied
by 2 to account for spin.

the product of the number dNph of photons belonging to d by the energy h  of
each photon. Considering that photons are bosons, and that the equilibrium case is
considered, the number dNph is given in turn by the product Qg./ d P.E D h /,
with P the Bose-Einstein statistics (15.55). In summary, using the second relation

Chapter 16
Separation of Many-Particle Systems
16.1
Introduction
The chapter illustrates a number of steps that are necessary to reduce the many-
particle problem to a tractable form. The analysis starts from a system of interacting
electrons and nuclei; such a system is not made of identical particles and its
Hamiltonian operator is not necessarily separable. Besides that, the number of
particles that are present in the typical volume of, e.g., a solid-state device is
so huge that the solution of the Schrödinger equation of such a system in the
original form is a hopeless task. The ﬁrst step consists in the application of the
adiabatic approximation, by which the system made of the electrons is separated
from that of the nuclei. The way in which such a separation is accomplished has
the inconvenience that the nuclei are kept ﬁxed in the equilibrium positions; this
approximation is too strong, because it prevents the exchange of energy between
the two systems from occurring: in fact, it is used provisionally and is removed
at a later stage. The next step deals with the electron system which, despite the
separation from the nuclei, is still too complicate to be dealt with directly; using
the Ritz method, the Schrödinger equation for the electron system is separated
into single-particle equations, in which each electron is subjected to the average
ﬁeld of the others. This step yields the Hartree equations and greatly simpliﬁes
the problem; in fact, the equations, besides being separated, are also identical to
each other, so that the set of eigenvalues and eigenfunction obtained from one of
them is applicable to all electrons. The Hartree equations do not comply with the
exclusion principle, which must necessarily be fulﬁlled because the system under
consideration is made of identical fermions; a further modiﬁcation, yielding the
Hartree-Fock equations, provides the wave function with the expected antisymmetry
property. Finally, the system of nuclei is taken again into consideration for the
purpose of eliminating the simpliﬁcation that the nuclei are ﬁxed in the equilibrium
positions: considering the fact that the nuclei are strongly bound together, so that
their displacement from the equilibrium position is small, the nuclei are treated
as a system of linear harmonic oscillators. In this way, the interaction between

Separation of Many-Particle Systems
an electron and the nuclei is described (in a later chapter) using the quantum-
mechanical, ﬁrst-order perturbation theory applied to the two-particle collision of
an electron with a phonon.
16.2
System of Interacting Electrons and Nuclei
The analysis of a conservative system of identical particles, started in Sect. 15.7,
is based on the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (15.28). It must be noted,
however, that the typical systems to be dealt with are not made of identical particles
but, rather, of a mixture of subsystems; the particles of each subsystem are identical
to each other, but different from those of the other subsystems. Moreover, the
Hamiltonian operator of each subsystem is not necessarily separable. It follows
that the existence of a single-particle Hamiltonian operator like (15.28) is by no
means obvious. It is then necessary to tackle the problem from a more general point
of view, starting from the consideration of a mixture of systems, and determining
the approximations that may simplify the problem to a level that is practically
affordable.
To this purpose, consider a conservative system made of K electrons and N
nuclei, interacting with each other. The particles are bound together, so that the
system’s wave function can be assumed to be normalized to unity. The coordinates
associated with the electrons are indicated with small letters and grouped into a
single vector r D .r1; : : : ; rK/; those of the nuclei are indicated with capital letters:
R D .R1; : : : ; RN/. The interaction among the particles is assumed to be of the
Coulomb type, so that the contributions to the potential energy due to the electron-
electron and nucleus-nucleus interactions are, respectively,

The time-independent Schrödinger equation of the system then reads

where the eigenfunctions depend on all variables, w D w.r; R/. In (16.5), Uext D
Uext.r; R/ is the potential energy due to an external, conservative ﬁeld acting on
the system. If it were Uea C Uext D 0, the Hamiltonian would be separable with
respect to the two subsystems, H D .Te CUe/C.Ta CUa/. The time-independent
equations resulting from the separation would be
.Te C Ue/ u D Ee u ;
.Ta C Ua/ v D Ea v ;
(16.6)
with u D u.r/, v D v.R/; due to the general properties of separable operators
(compare with Sect. 10.3), the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of (16.5) would have
the form w D u v, E D Ee C Ea. As in general it is Uea C Uext ¤ 0, the Schrödinger
equation (16.5) is not actually separable, and its solution may often present a
formidable challenge: considering by way of example that the concentration of
atoms in solid matter is of the order of 5  1022 cm3, and that to a nucleus
there correspond Z electrons, with Z the atomic number, the number of scalar
coordinates necessary to describe a cubic centimeter of solid matter is of the order
of 15 .Z C 1/  1022. It is then necessary to make a number of approximations; they
are introduced step by step and, as illustrated in Sects. 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5, they are
capable to bring the problem back to the solution of single-particle equations.
16.3
Adiabatic Approximation
The problem of solving the Schrödinger equation (16.5) for a system of interacting
electrons and nuclei is simpliﬁed by observing that the mass of a nucleus is much
larger than that of the electrons. As a ﬁrst consequence, one expects that the
interaction with an individual electron inﬂuences little the motion of a nucleus;
rather, the latter is expected to be inﬂuenced by the average interaction with many
electrons. A second consequence is that if the particles’ dynamics is provisionally
considered in classical terms, the motion of the nuclei is much slower than
that of the electrons; as a consequence, the classical positions R of the nuclei
can be considered as slowly varying parameters when the electron dynamics is
investigated. For this reason, the procedure shown below, based on the latter obser-
vation, is called adiabatic approximation or also Born-Oppenheimer approximation

Separation of Many-Particle Systems
[78, Sect. 8]. In quantum terms, the approximation leads to the splitting of the
original equation (16.5) into a set of two coupled equations. To this purpose, let
He D Te C Ue C Uea C Uext ;
(16.7)
where the dependence on R is algebraic only. Considering such a dependence, the
Hamiltonian operator He provides an eigenvalue equation whose eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions depend on R; they read
He u D Ee u ;
Ee D Ee.R/ ;
u D u.r; R/ :
(16.8)
Also, from the Schrödinger equation (16.8) one ﬁnds that, for any function v that
depends only on R, the following holds: Heu v D Ee u v. As v is undetermined,
one may seek a form of v such that w D u v is also an eigenfunction of the
full Hamiltonian operator H of (16.5). From the deﬁnition of He it follows
H D Ta C Ua C He, whence the original Schrödinger equation (16.5) is recast as
.Ta C Ua C He/ uv D E uv :
(16.9)
The second relation in (16.4) shows that each Laplacian operator in Ta acts on both
u and v, speciﬁcally, r2
j u v D u r2
j v C v r2
j u C 2 rj u  rj v. Multiplying the latter
by „2=.2 mj/ and adding over j transforms (16.9) into
u .Ta C Ua C Ee/ v C v Tau C Gau v D E u v ;
(16.10)
where the short-hand notation Gau v D  PN
jD1.„2=mj/ rj urj v has been used. To
proceed one notes that the coefﬁcients in the Schrödinger equation (16.8) are real,
so that u can be taken real as well. Remembering that the particles described by u
are bound, one ﬁnds that u is normalizable so that, for any R,

In this way, the original Schrödinger equation (16.5) is eventually split into two

.Te C Ue C Uea C Uext/ u D Ee u :
(16.15)
The ﬁrst equation, (16.14), is the equation for the nuclei, in fact its kinetic operator
Ta acts on R only, and its potential-energy term Ua C Ee C Uu depends on R
only; this equation is coupled with the second one, (16.15), because Ee is an
eigenvalue of (16.15) and Uu is given by the integral in (16.14) that involves the
eigenfunctions of (16.15). In turn, (16.15) is the equation for the electrons, in fact
its kinetic operator Te acts on r only; the part Uea CUext of its potential-energy term
couples (16.15) with (16.14) due to the dependence on R.
In principle, one may solve (16.15) after ﬁxing R and, from the solution, calculate
Ee and Uu to be used in (16.14). From v one then determines the expectation value
of R that updates the starting point for the solution of (16.15). Considering the
case of solid matter, and still reasoning in classical terms, a zero-order solution
for the iterative procedure depicted above is found by observing that the nuclei,
being massive and tightly bound together, are expected to depart little from their
equilibrium positions R0. One then ﬁxes R D R0 in (16.15) to ﬁnd, for the electrons’
Schrödinger equation, the approximate form
.Te C Ve/ u D Ee u ;
Ve.r/ D Ue.r/ C Uea.r; R0/ C Uext.r; R0/ :
(16.16)
This separates completely the equation for the electrons, that may be thought of as
forming a separate system of total energy Ee. Clearly, keeping the positions of the
nuclei ﬁxed is rather crude an approximation; in this way, in fact, the nuclei cannot
exchange energy with the electrons any more. On the other hand, it can be shown
that the solution of (16.16) provides an acceptable approximation for the energy of
the electrons. Another advantage of keeping the nuclei in the equilibrium positions
occurs in the investigation of materials where the nuclei are arranged in periodic
structures; in fact, one exploits in this case the properties of differential equations
having periodic coefﬁcients (compare with Sects. 13.4 and 17.5.1). In conclusion,
the present analysis will continue by provisionally considering only the system of
electrons as described by (16.16); obviously the problem of the exchange of energy
with the system of nuclei cannot be dispensed with and will be resumed at a later
stage (Sect. 16.6).

Hartree Equations
Equation (16.16), describing the separate system of K electrons after ﬁxing the
nuclei to the equilibrium positions R0, lends itself to the application of the Ritz
method outlined in Sect. 16.7.1. For the sake of generality, one starts by assuming
that the K particles are distinguishable; for this reason, the symbols Te, Ve, u,
and Ee of (16.16) are not used. Also, the application of the Ritz method will
be carried out in the case where the external forces are absent, Uext D 0; such
forces will be introduced again into the problem in Sect. 19.2.1, where the single-
particle dynamics is described. Given these premises, the operator A , its minimum
eigenvalue A1, and the corresponding eigenfunction v1 used in Sect. 16.7.1 for
describing the Ritz method are indicated here with A D H , A1 D E1, v1 D w1,

The potential energy of the ith particle is the sum of two-particle potential energies
averaged with the localization probabilities of the particles different from the ith.
The eigenvalue i is then the energy of the ith particle in the ﬁeld of the other K  1
particles (for this reason, the sum 1 C: : :CN is not the total energy of the system).
The solution of (16.25) is found by iteration; one starts with i D 1 and
provides an initial guess for f2; : : : ; fK, so that the initial guess for U1 is calculated
from (16.26) and used in (16.25). The solution of the latter yields the ﬁrst iteration
for f1 and, remembering the Ritz method outlined in Sect. 16.7.1, the parameters
embedded in f1 are exploited at this stage to lower the eigenvalue; then, one proceeds
with i D 2, using the ﬁrst iteration for f1 and the initial guess for f3; : : : ; fK, and
so on. It must be noted that the initial guess is used within an integral, whose

334
16
Separation of Many-Particle Systems
effect is that of averaging the difference between the initial guess and the actual
solution; therefore, it may happen that the accuracy of the ﬁrst iteration is sufﬁcient,
to the extent that the iterative process may be brought to an end. In this case, the
K equations (16.25) become independent of each other and the solution effort is
greatly reduced.
16.5
Hartree-Fock Equations
It is now necessary to investigate the problem originally introduced in Sect. 16.3,
namely, that of equation (16.16), which describes the separate system of electrons
after ﬁxing the nuclei to the equilibrium positions R0. The Hartree equations (16.25)
cannot be applied as they stand, because they have been deduced for a system made
of distinguishable particles. To treat a system of electrons, instead, it is necessary to
account for the particles’ spin that was not considered in Sects. 16.3 and 16.4, and
ensure the antisymmetry of the wave function (Sect. 15.7). The procedure is similar
to that depicted in Sect. 16.4, the difference being that the auxiliary function f is not
expressed as a product like in (16.37), but is given by a Slater determinant (15.37),
whose entries depend on the position and spin coordinates of the corresponding
particle [78, Sect. 8], [124, Sect. 16.3].
The calculations are rather involved and are not reported here. It is important
to mention that like in Sect. 16.4, the derivation is carried out by assuming that
the external forces are absent (Uext D 0). The procedure yields a set of K equations,
coupled with each other, that generalize the Hartree equations (16.25) and are called
Hartree-Fock equations. If the accuracy of the ﬁrst iteration is sufﬁcient, the original
Hamiltonian operator of (16.16), describing the system of electrons as a whole, is
separated into K single-particle, identical operators:
Te C Ve D
K
X
iD1

 „2

i C Vei.ri/

:
(16.27)
In this way the form (15.28) of the Schrödinger equation for the electrons, sought at
the beginning of Sect. 16.2, is recovered.
16.6
Schrödinger Equation for the Nuclei
In the process of separating the Schrödinger equation for the electrons, (16.15),
from that of the nuclei, (16.14), that is carried out in Sect. 16.3, the positions
of the nuclei are ﬁxed to the equilibrium values R D R0. This is done to the
purpose of calculating the coefﬁcients Ee and Uu (compare with (16.6) and (16.14),
respectively); such coefﬁcients depend on R and can be obtained only by solving the

16.6
Schrödinger Equation for the Nuclei
335
equation for the electrons. After this step is accomplished, one turns to the equation
for the nuclei, in which Ee and Uu are ﬁxed to constants from the previous iteration;
the potential energy of (16.14) then becomes
Va.r/ D Ua.r/ C Ee.r0/ C Uu.r0/ :
(16.28)
If the positions of the nuclei are kept ﬁxed, that is, the iterative procedure outlined
in Sect. 16.3 is brought to an end without solving (16.14), the exchange of energy
between the system of electrons and that of nuclei cannot take place. It is then
necessary to proceed to the solution of (16.14); such a solution is obtained by
means of an approximation shown below, and the iterative procedure for the solution
of (16.14) and (16.15) is stopped right after. In this way, one keeps for the energy
of the electrons the eigenvalues obtained with the nuclei ﬁxed at R0, which is a
convenient choice due to the advantages illustrated in Sect. 16.3.
As for the nuclei, it has already been observed in Sect. 16.3 with respect to
the case of solid matter that the nuclei, being massive and tightly bound together,
are expected to depart little from their equilibrium positions R0. To improve with
respect to the zero-order approximation R D R0, and provisionally reasoning in
classical terms, one assumes that the instantaneous displacement RR0 with respect
to the equilibrium point is small, so that Va in (16.28) can be approximated with a
second-order Taylor expansion around R0. The classical form of the problem is thus
brought to the case already solved in Sects. 3.9 and 3.10: indicating with Ta C Va
the classical equivalent of the operator Ta C Va, the vibrational state of the nuclei is
described in terms of the normal coordinates b, whose conjugate momenta are Pb,
and the total energy of the nuclei reads (compare with (3.50)):

which, introduced into (16.14), yields

(16.31)
This procedure provides the separation of the degrees of freedom of the nuclei and
completes the separation process whose usefulness was anticipated in Sect. 16.2.
The solution of (16.31) is illustrated in Sect. 12.5 and shows that the mode’s energy

is ascribed to the set of phonons belonging to the mode itself. As the phonons are
bosons, the equilibrium distribution of their occupation numbers is given by the
Bose-Einstein statistics. The description of the interaction between an electron and
the nuclei is obtained from the quantum-mechanical, ﬁrst-order perturbation theory
applied to the two-particle collision of an electron with a phonon (Sect. 17.8).

Periodic Structures
17.1
Introduction
This chapter outlines a number of concepts that are useful in the description of
periodic structures. The ﬁrst sections describe the geometrical entities (characteristic
vectors, direct and reciprocal lattices, translation vectors, cells, and Brillouin
zones) used for describing a lattice. The analysis focuses on the lattices of cubic
type, because silicon and other semiconductor materials used in the fabrication
of integrated circuits have this type of structure. The next sections introduce the
mathematical apparatus necessary for solving the Schrödinger equation within a
periodic structure, speciﬁcally, the translation operators, Bloch theorem, and peri-
odic boundary conditions. Basing on such tools, the Schrödinger equation is solved,
leading to the dispersion relation of the electrons, whose properties are worked out
and discussed. The analogy between a wave packet in a periodic potential and in
free space is also outlined. Then, the parabolic-band approximation is introduced,
leading to the concept of effective mass and to the explicit calculation of the density
of states. Examples of the structure of the conduction and valence bands of silicon,
germanium, and gallium arsenide are provided. Considering the importance of two-
dimensional and one-dimensional structures in modern technological applications,
a detailed derivation of the subbands and the corresponding density of states is
also given. Then, the same mathematical concepts used for solving the Schrödinger
equation (Bloch theorem and periodic boundary conditions) are applied to the
calculation of the lattice’s vibrational spectrum in the harmonic approximation.
The properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem are worked
out, leading to the expression of the vibrational modes. Basing on the above,
the description of the electron-lattice interaction is worked out. The complements
provide a number of details about the description of crystal planes and directions,
and about the connection between the symmetries of the Hamiltonian operator
and the properties of its eigenvalues. A number of examples of application of the
concepts outlined in the chapter are given in the last part of the complements;

speciﬁcally, the Kronig-Penney model, showing a one-dimensional calculation of
the electrons’ dispersion relation, and the derivation of the dispersion relation of the
one-dimensional monatomic and diatomic chains. The complements are concluded
by a discussion about some analogies between the energy of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and that of the vibrating lattice, and between the dispersion relation of the
electrons and that of the lattice.
17.2
Bravais Lattice
The concepts illustrated in the previous chapters will now be applied to study the
properties of a speciﬁc class of materials, the crystals. In fact, in the majority of
cases the solid-state devices are manufactured using a crystal as basic material.1
A crystal is made of a periodic arrangement of an atom, or a group of atoms,
called basis. As a periodic structure is unlimited in all spatial directions, the general
properties of crystals are derived using the provisional hypothesis that the material
extends to inﬁnity. The more realistic case of a ﬁnite crystal is considered at a later
stage.
To describe the properties of a crystal it is convenient to superimpose to it a
geometrical structure, called Bravais lattice, made of an inﬁnite array of discrete
points generated by translation operations of the form [16]
l D m1 a1 C m2 a2 C m3 a3 ;
(17.1)
with m1, m2, m3 any integers. In (17.1), l is called translation vector while a1,
a2, a3 are the characteristic vectors; the discrete points generated by (17.1) are
called nodes. The set of vectors l is closed under vector addition. Although the
characteristic vectors are not necessarily of equal length, nor are they orthogonal
to each other, they form a complete set; it follows that any vector r of the three-
dimensional space is expressible as
r D 1 a1 C 2 a2 C 3 a3 ;
(17.2)
with 1, 2, 3 real numbers. In a zero-dimensional or one-dimensional space only
one Bravais lattice is possible. In a two-dimensional space there are ﬁve Bravais
lattices, such as oblique, rectangular, centered rectangular (rhombic), hexagonal,
and square [79]. An example of oblique lattice is shown in Fig. 17.1. Another
1Some important exceptions exist. Thin-Film Transistors (TFT), commonly used in ﬂat-screen or
liquid-crystal displays, are obtained by depositing a semiconductor layer (typically, silicon) over
a nonconducting substrate; due to the deposition process, the structure of the semiconductor layer
is amorphous or polycrystalline. Phase-Change Memories (PCM) exploit the property of speciﬁc
materials like chalcogenides (for example, Ge2Sb2Te5), that switch from the crystalline to the
amorphous state, and vice versa, in a controlled way when subjected to a suitable electric pulse.

important concept is that of cell. Still considering a two-dimensional lattice of the
oblique type, a cell is a two-dimensional surface that is associated with each node
and has the following properties: (i) the association is one-to-one, (ii) the cells are
equal to each other, and (iii) the union of the cells covers the lattice exactly. The
cell so deﬁned is not unique; by way of examples, all the shaded surfaces shown in
Fig. 17.2 fulﬁll the properties listed above. It may seem that the cell of case c) is not
correct, because it touches four nodes; however, each node is shared by four cells,
so that the one-to-one correspondence is maintained. In fact, the type of cell shown
in case c) is most useful to extend the deﬁnitions given so far to the more realistic
three-dimensional case. One notes in passing that the common value of the area of
the cells depicted in Fig. 17.2 is A D ja1 ^ a2j, with a1, a2 the characteristic vectors
indicated in Fig. 17.1.
In a three-dimensional space the simplest cells are three-dimensional volumes
that fulﬁll the same properties as in the two-dimensional case and have the atoms
placed at the corners. Such an arrangement is called primitive. It can be shown that
seven primitive arrangements are possible; each of them may further be enriched
in ﬁve possible ways, by adding a) one atom at the center of the cell, or b) one
atom at the center of each face of the cell, or c) one atom at the center of each
pair of cell faces (this can be done in three different ways). The addition of extra
atoms to the primitive arrangement is called centering. The total number of three-
dimensional arrangements, including the primitive ones, is thus 76 D 42; however,
it is found that not all of them are distinct, so that the actual number of distinct three-
dimensional cells reduces to 14 [79].

A three-dimensional lattice whose characteristic vectors are mutually orthogonal
and of equal length is called cubic. Besides the primitive one, other two arrange-
ments of cubic type are possible: the ﬁrst one has one additional atom at the cell’s
center and is called body-centered cubic (BCC), the second one has one additional
atom at the center of each cell’s face and is called face-centered cubic (FCC). A
portion of a lattice of the FCC type is shown in Fig. 17.3. Examples of chemical
species whose crystalline phase has a cubic cell are carbon (C) in the diamond phase,
silicon (Si), and germanium (Ge); in fact, this type of crystallization state is also
collectively indicated with diamond structure. Elements like C, Si, and Ge belong to
the fourth column of the periodic table of elements; Si and Ge are semiconductors,
while C in the diamond phase is an insulator.2 The FCC cell is also exhibited by
some compound materials, an example of which is gallium arsenide (GaAs), a
semiconductor of the so-called III-V type.3 Some properties of Si, Ge, and GaAs,
along with those of other III-V semiconductors, are listed in Tables 17.1 and 17.2.
The type of crystallization state of GaAs and the other materials of Table 17.2 is
called zincblende structure.4
2The meaning of “insulator” or “semiconductor,” as well as that of “conductor,” is speciﬁed in
Sect. 18.2.
3The term “III-V” derives from the fact the Ga and As belong, respectively, to the third and ﬁfth
column of the periodic table of elements.
4Zincblende is another name for Sphalerite, an economically important mineral whence zinc is
extracted. It consists of zinc sulﬁde in crystalline form with some contents of iron, (Zn,Fe)S.

Reciprocal Lattice
As indicated in Sect. 17.2, the type of cell having the nodes at the corners is the most
useful one for introducing a number of deﬁnitions. For instance, observing that the
characteristic vectors coincide with the cell’s edges (this property is evident for the
FCC cell as shown in Fig. 17.3; however, it applies also to the other types of cells),
one obtains for the cell’s volume
l D a1  a2 ^ a3 D a2  a3 ^ a1 D a3  a1 ^ a2 ;
(17.3)
where the orientation of the characteristic vectors is chosen in such a way as to make
l positive.
The major advantage of dealing with a periodic structure is the possibility of
using the Fourier series. In fact, the functions describing the physical properties
of the structure are expected to be periodic, so that one can take advantage
of the Fourier expansion. The latter, in turn, entails a transformation from the
coordinate space to another space reciprocal to it. Considering, for instance, the one-
dimensional case of the Fourier transform given in (C.17), there the k space is the
reciprocal of the x space; similarly, in an n-dimensional space like that considered
in (C.20), the k space is the reciprocal of the x space: both vectors k, x are linear
combinations of the same set of mutually orthogonal, unit vectors i1; : : : ; in, so that
the scalar product k  x yields k1 x1 C : : : C kn xn. In the case considered here,
instead, one must account for the fact that the reference a1, a2, a3 of the space under
consideration is made of vectors that, in general, are neither mutually orthogonal
nor of equal length. For this reason it is necessary to introduce a reciprocal lattice
by deﬁning its characteristic vectors as
b1 D a2 ^ a3
l
;
b2 D a3 ^ a1
l
;
b3 D a1 ^ a2
l
:
(17.4)
From the deﬁnition (17.3) of l and the mixed-product property (A.32) one ﬁnds
that the characteristic vectors fulﬁll the orthogonality and normalization relation
ai  bj D ıij ;
(17.5)
www.ebook3000.com

346
17
Periodic Structures
with ıij the Kronecker symbol (A.18). The translation vectors and the general
vectors of the reciprocal lattice are linear combinations of b1, b2, b3 whose
coefﬁcients are, respectively, integer numbers or real numbers. To distinguish the
lattice based on b1, b2, b3 from the one based on a1, a2, a3, the latter is also called
direct lattice. The common value of the cells’ volume in the reciprocal lattice is
G D b1  b2 ^ b3 D b2  b3 ^ b1 D b3  b1 ^ b2 :
(17.6)
Observing that ai is a length, from (17.4) it follows that bj is the inverse of a
length; as a consequence, the units of G are m3, and the product  D l G is
a dimensionless constant. The value of  is found by combining the ﬁrst relation
in (17.4), which yields l b1 D a2 ^ a3, with (17.6), so that
 D l G D l b1  b2 ^ b3 D a2 ^ a3  .b2 ^ b3/ D a2  a3 ^ .b2 ^ b3/ ;
(17.7)
where the last equality is due to the invariance of the mixed product upon
interchange of the “wedge” and “dot” symbols (Sect. A.7). Then, using (A.33) to
resolve the double vector product,
l G D a2.a3  b3 b2  a3  b2 b3/ D a2.ı33 b2  ı32 b3/ D a2b2 D 1 :
(17.8)
From the properties that provide the deﬁnition of cell (Sect. 17.2) it follows that for
a given lattice, the volume of the cell does not depend on its form. As a consequence
it is l G D 1 no matter what the cell’s form is. Also, after deﬁning e1 D b2 ^ b3=G
one ﬁnds, by a similar calculation,
e1 D b2 ^ b3
G
D b2 ^ .a1 ^ a2/
l G
D b2  a2 a1  b2  a1 a2 D a1 ;
(17.9)
and the like for e2 and e3; thus, the direct lattice is the reciprocal of the reciprocal
lattice.
Given a direct lattice of characteristic vectors a1, a2, a3, it is convenient to
introduce, besides the reciprocal lattice of characteristic vectors b1, b2, b3 deﬁned
by (17.4), another lattice called scaled reciprocal lattice, whose characteristic
vectors are 2  b1, 2  b2, 2  b3. A translation vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice
has the form
g D n1 2  b1 C n2 2  b2 C n3 2  b3 ;
(17.10)
with n1; n2; n3 any integers, whereas a general vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice
has the form

(17.13)
that is, exp .i g  r/ is periodic in the r space. This shows the usefulness of the
scaled reciprocal lattice for treating problems related to periodic structures. In fact,

The origin of the reference of the direct or reciprocal space has not been identiﬁed so
far. After selecting the origin, consider the cell of the r space whose sides emanate

e.g., with Fig. 17.3), so that, to any point r D 1 a1 C 2 a2 C 3 a3 that belongs to

Wigner-Seitz Cell—Brillouin Zone
It has been mentioned in Sect. 17.2 that the cell properties do not identify the cell
uniquely. Cells of a form different from that shown, e.g., in the two-dimensional
example of Fig. 17.2 can be constructed. Among them, of particular interest is the
Wigner-Seitz cell, whose construction is shown in Fig. 17.4 still considering a two-
dimensional lattice of the oblique type. First, the node to be associated with the
cell is connected to its nearest neighbors as shown in the ﬁgure (the connecting
segments are the continuous lines); then, the axis of each segment is drawn (dashed
lines). As the axis is the locus of points having the same distance from the extrema
of the connecting segment, one can select a contour, made of portions of the axes
(thick line), such that the following property holds: any point inside the contour
is closer to the node associated with the cell than to any other lattice node. From
the construction described above it also follows that the shaded surface so obtained
fulﬁlls the requisites listed in Sect. 17.2, so it is a cell proper; such a cell, named
after Wigner and Seitz, fulﬁlls the additional property of the closeness of the internal
points. Its construction in the three-dimensional case is similar, the only difference
being that the axis is replaced with the plane normal to the connecting segment at
the midpoint.
The concept of Wigner-Seitz cell, that has been introduced above using the direct
lattice by way of example, is applicable also to the reciprocal and scaled-reciprocal
lattices. In the scaled reciprocal lattice, the Wigner-Seitz cell associated with the
origin is called ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The set of Wigner-Seitz cells adjacent to the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone is called second Brillouin zone, and so on. The ﬁrst Brillouin zone of
the FCC lattice is shown in Fig. 17.5; its boundary is made of six square faces and
eight hexagonal faces. The center of the zone is called  point; the k1 axis belongs to
the Œ100 crystal direction5 and intercepts the boundary of the Brillouin zone at two
opposite positions called X points, that coincide with the center of square faces; the
k2, k3 axes belong to the Œ010 and Œ001 directions, respectively, and intercept the
boundary at X points as well. In turn, the f111g directions intercept the boundary at
positions called L points that coincide with the center of the hexagonal faces. There
5The symbols indicating the crystal directions are illustrated in Sect. 17.9.1.

17.5
Translation Operators
The typical procedure by which the physical properties of periodic structures, like
crystals, are investigated entails the solution of eigenvalue equations generated by
quantum-mechanical operators. In this respect it is useful to introduce a class of
operators, called translation operators, that are associated with the direct-lattice
vectors l deﬁned by (17.1). To ease the notation, the translation operator associated
with the ith lattice vector li is indicated with Ti D T .li/. A translation operator is
deﬁned by the property
Tif.r/ D f.r C li/
(17.18)
for all functions f deﬁned over the direct lattice. It is easily found that translation
operators are linear and non-Hermitean. Also, they commute with each other; in
fact,
TiTsf.r/ D f.r C li C ls/ D TsTif.r/
(17.19)
for all functions f and all indices i; s. Remembering the property derived in
Sect. 10.4, it follows that all translation operators have a common set of eigen-
functions v. Combining this result with deﬁnition (17.18) provides the form of the

eigenvalues ˛ of the translation operators. For this, consider the operators associated
with three arbitrary vectors li, ls, and lu, and generate the eigenvalue equations
Ti v D ˛.li/ v ;
Ts v D ˛.ls/ v ;
Tu v D ˛.lu/ v :
(17.20)
If one now lets lu D li C ls, it follows TiTs v.r/ D v.r C li C ls/ D Tu v.r/, that is,
TiTs D Tu. On the other hand, the ﬁrst two eigenvalue equations in (17.20) provide
TiTs v D Ti ˛.ls/ v D ˛.li/ ˛.ls/ v which, combined with the third one, yields
˛.li/ ˛.ls/ D ˛.lu/ D ˛.li C ls/ :
(17.21)
The result shows that the functional dependence of ˛ on the translation vector must
be of the exponential type:
˛.l/ D exp.c  l/ ;
c D
3
X
sD1
.<	s C i =	s/ 2  bs ;
(17.22)
where c is a complex vector whose units are the inverse of a length. For this reason
c is given the general form shown in the second relation of (17.22), with bs a
characteristic vector of the reciprocal lattice, s D 1; 2; 3, and 	s a dimensionless
complex number that is momentarily left unspeciﬁed.
17.5.1
Bloch Theorem
The expression (17.22) of the eigenvalues of the translation operators makes it
possible to specify some property of the eigenfunctions; in fact, combining the
deﬁnition of translation operator, T v.r/ D v.r C l/, with the eigenvalue equation
T v.r/ D exp.c  l/ v.r/ yields
vc.r C l/ D exp.c  l/ vc.r/ ;
(17.23)
called Bloch theorem (ﬁrst form). The importance of this result can be appreciated
by observing that if v is known within a lattice cell, and c is given, then the
eigenfunction can be reconstructed everywhere else. The index in (17.23) reminds
one that the eigenfunction depends on the choice of c. The theorem can be recast
differently by deﬁning an auxiliary function uc.r/ D vc.r/ exp.c  r/, so that
vc.r C l/ D exp.c  l/ vc.r/ D exp.c  l/ uc.r/ exp.c  r/ :
(17.24)
In turn, from the deﬁnition of uc one draws vc.r C l/ D uc.r C l/ expŒc  .r C l/
which, combined with (17.24), yields the Bloch theorem (second form):

17.5
Translation Operators
351
vc.r/ D uc.r/ exp.c  r/ ;
uc.r C l/ D uc.r/ :
(17.25)
The second form of the Bloch theorem shows that the auxiliary function uc is
periodic in the direct lattice, so that the eigenfunctions of the translation operators
are the product of an exponential function times a function having the lattice
periodicity. One notes the similarity of this result with that expressed by (13.39);
in fact, the Bloch theorem is a form of the Floquet theorem (Sect. 13.4).
The eigenfunctions of the translation operators play an important role in the
description of the physical properties of periodic structures. For this reason, vectors
c of the general form are not acceptable because their real part would make
vc.r/ D uc.r/ exp.c  r/ to diverge as r departs more and more from the origin.6
It is then necessary to impose the restriction c D i k, with k real. This is achieved
by letting <	s D 0 and =	s D s in the second relation of (17.22), so that the
eigenvalues of the translation operators become
˛.l/ D exp.i k  l/ ;
k D
3
X
sD1
s 2  bs :
(17.26)
Remembering (17.15), such eigenvalues are periodic in the scaled reciprocal lattice.
In turn, the ﬁrst and second forms of the Bloch theorem become, respectively,
vk.r C l/ D exp.i k  l/ vk.r/ ;
(17.27)
vk.r/ D uk.r/ exp.i k  r/ ;
uk.r C l/ D uk.r/ :
(17.28)
Eigenfunctions of the form (17.27,17.28) are also called Bloch functions. They fulﬁll
the eigenvalue equation T vk.r/ D exp.i kl/ vk.r/ so that, observing that T is real
and taking the conjugate of the eigenvalue equation yield
T v
k.r/ D exp.i k  l/ v
k.r/ :
(17.29)
If, instead, one replaces k with k in the original equation, the following is found:
T vk.r/ D exp.i k  l/ vk.r/ :
(17.30)
Comparing (17.30) with (17.29) shows that v
k and vk belong to the same
eigenvalue. Moreover, comparing the second expression in (17.26) with (17.11)
shows that k is a vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice.
A further reasoning demonstrates that the variability of k in (17.27,17.28) can
be limited to a single cell of the scaled reciprocal lattice; for instance, to the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone or, alternatively, to the cell of the k space whose sides emanate from
the origin, so that the coefﬁcients of (17.11) fulﬁll the relation 0  i  1 as shown

in Sect. 17.3. The property derives from the periodicity of the eigenvalues in the
scaled reciprocal lattice, expŒi .k C g/  l D exp.i k  l/, due to which the values of
exp.i k  l/, with k ranging over a single cell, provide the whole set of the operator’s
eigenvalues. As expŒi .k C g/  l is the same eigenvalue as exp.i k  l/, the Bloch
function vkCg.r/ is the same as vk.r/. Note that the reasoning does not prevent the
eigenvalue from being degenerate: if this is the case, one ﬁnds

17.5.2
Periodic Operators
An operator A is periodic in the direct lattice if A .r C l/ D A .r/ for all vectors
r and all translation vectors l of the direct lattice. Periodic operators commute with
translation operators: this is shown by letting v0 D A v, so that
T .l/A .r/v.r/ D T .l/v0.r/ D v0.r C l/ D
D A .r C l/v.r C l/ D A .r/v.r C l/ D A .r/T .l/v.r/ :
(17.32)
From the commutativity property T A D AT it follows that T and A have a
common set of eigenfunctions, so that the eigenfunctions of a periodic operator are
Bloch functions; letting Ak be the eigenvalue, one has
A vk D Ak vk ;
(17.33)
with k belonging to a single cell of the scaled reciprocal lattice, and vkCg D vk.
Since an eigenfunction belongs to one eigenvalue only, it follows
AkCg D Ak ;
(17.34)
namely, if an operator is periodic in the direct lattice, its eigenvalues are periodic in
the scaled reciprocal lattice.
17.5.3
Periodic Boundary Conditions
In the derivation of the Bloch theorem, carried out in Sect. 17.5.1, it has been
observed that complex vectors c in the expression vc.r/ D uc.r/ exp.c  r/ of the
eigenfunctions are not acceptable because their real part would make the function
to diverge. In fact, as noted in Sect. 17.5.2, such eigenfunctions belong also to the

operators that commute with the translation operators and may describe physical
properties of the crystal, so that diverging solutions must be discarded. On the other
hand, such a divergence is due to the assumption that the crystal is unlimited; in
the more realistic case of a ﬁnite block of material, diverging solutions would not
appear. Unfortunately, a ﬁnite block of material is not periodic, hence the useful
concepts and properties worked out so far in this chapter are not applicable to it.
To further investigate on the subject one notes that a ﬁnite block may be thought
of as derived from the original crystal by sectioning the latter using three pairs
of parallel crystal planes, as shown in Fig. 17.6. One of the vertices of the block
coincides with the origin of the reference of the direct lattice, and the block’s sides
are aligned with the characteristic vectors. Also, the type of cell chosen here is the
one whose sides coincide with the characteristic vectors themselves. The relation
between the total number Nc of the block’s cells, the block’s volume , and that of
the cell is easily found to be
Nc D N1 N2 N3 D 
l
;
(17.35)
with Ns the number of cell sides that match the side of the block in the sth direction.
In a ﬁnite volume of material, the number of cells that belong to the interior is
typically much larger than the number of cells that are adjacent to the boundaries;
when solving a single-electron Schrödinger equation within such a structure, it is
found that in the interior of it the eigenfunctions practically coincide with Bloch
functions, whereas the effect of the real part of vector c in vc.r/ D uc.r/ exp.c  r/
becomes relevant only when the position under investigation is close to a boundary.
In fact, the real part of c is such that the eigenfunctions become vanishingly small
far away from the volume considered [24, Sects. F-XI, O-III].
The considerations above show that for practical purposes one may keep the
analysis based on the original periodicity of the unlimited structure by replacing
the vanishing boundary conditions with a different type of conditions, able to
formally restore periodicity in a ﬁnite structure. This is accomplished by imposing
the identity of the Bloch functions corresponding to two boundary points facing each
other along the direction of a characteristic vector. This prescription, called periodic

boundary condition or Born-Von Karman boundary condition, is illustrated with
the aid of Fig. 17.6. Consider for instance point r D 1 a1 C 2 a2 (labeled P in the
ﬁgure), that belongs to the boundary plane deﬁned by a1, a2. Point Q facing P on the
opposite boundary plane is such that Q  P D l D N3 a3 whence, applying the ﬁrst
form (17.23) of Bloch’s theorem, one obtains vc.r C N3 a3/ D exp.N3 c  a3/ vc.r/.
Imposing vc.r C N3 a3/ D vc.r/ yields N3 c  a3 D i n3 2 , with n3 any integer, so
that, using expression (17.22) for c,
N3 c  a3 D 2  N3 .<	3 C i =	3/ D i n3 2  :

along the other directions to ﬁnally yield

(17.37)
In summary, the application of the periodic boundary conditions gives c the same
imaginary form c D i k that was found in an unlimited structure, the difference
being that in a ﬁnite structure the components of k are discrete instead of being
continuous: given the size of the structure, which is prescribed by N1, N2, N3,
each k vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice is associated with a triad of integers
n1, n2, n3.
Note that the reasoning carried out at the end of Sect. 17.5.1 about the variability
of k still holds; as a consequence, k can be restricted to a single cell of the scaled
reciprocal lattice, so that its coefﬁcients s D ns=Ns fulﬁll the relation 0  s  1
as shown in Sect. 17.3. In fact, as s D 0 and s D 1 are redundant, the above
relation must more appropriately be recast as 0  ns=Ns < 1, corresponding to
ns D 0; 1; : : : ; Ns  1 or, alternatively, 0 < ns=Ns  1, corresponding to ns D
1; 2; : : : ; Ns. In both cases, ns can take Ns distinct values, so that the total number
of distinct k vectors in a cell of the scaled reciprocal lattice is N1 N2 N3 D Nc.
From (17.35) one ﬁnds that such a number equals the number of the structure’s cells
in the direct lattice. Also, as the k vectors are equally spaced in each direction, their
density in the reciprocal scaled lattice is uniform; it is given by the ratio Nc=g, with
g the cell’s volume. Remembering that the latter is invariant (Sect. 17.3), one may
think of k as restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Combining (17.8) with (17.17)

17.6
Schrödinger Equation in a Periodic Lattice
The concepts introduced in the previous sections of this chapter are applied here
to the solution of the Schrödinger equation in a periodic lattice. It is assumed
provisionally that the lattice is unlimited; as a consequence, the components of the k
vector are continuous. The Schrödinger equation to be solved is the single-electron
equation (16.27) obtained from the separation procedure outlined in Sects. 16.2
through 16.5. This means that the nuclei are kept ﬁxed and the force acting on the
electron derives from a potential energy7 having the periodicity of the direct lattice:
V.r C l/ D V.r/, with l given by (17.1). As mentioned in Sects. 16.4 and 16.5, the
external forces are absent (Uext D 0). The equation then reads
H w D E w ;
H D  „2
2 m r2 C V :
(17.40)
Replacing r with r C l is equivalent to add a constant to each component of r,
say, xi  xi C li, hence the partial derivatives in (17.40) are unaffected. As a
consequence, the Hamiltonian operator as a whole has the lattice periodicity, so
that its eigenfunctions are Bloch functions. Remembering (17.28), they read
wk.r/ D uk.r/ exp.i k  r/ ;
uk.r C l/ D uk.r/ ;
(17.41)
with k belonging to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Sect. 17.5.3). Letting k2 D jkj2, (17.41)
yields r2wk D exp.i kr/ .k2Cr2C2 i kgrad/ uk whence, if Ek is the eigenvalue

groups in ascending order of d: for example, d D 0 corresponds to .0; 0; 0/, d D 1 to
Œ.0; 0; 1/; .0; 1; 0/; .1; 0; 0/; .0; 0; 1/; .0; 1; 0/; .1; 0; 0/, and so on. As each group is made by
construction of ﬁnite number of triads, the latter are numbered within each group using a ﬁnite set
of values of b; in order to have b ranging from 1 to C1, one associates a positive (negative)
value of b with the triads in which the number of negative indices is even (odd).

The solution of (17.48) provides an inﬁnite set of eigenvalues E1.k/, E2.k/; : : : ;
Ei.k/; : : : associated with the given k. As the latter ranges over the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone, the functions Ei.k/ are thought of as branches9 of a many-valued function.
For each branch-index i, the function Ei.k/ is called dispersion relation, and the set
of values spanned by Ei.k/ as k runs over the Brillouin zone is called energy band
of index i. Being an eigenvalue of a periodic operator, Ei.k/ is periodic within the
reciprocal, scaled lattice (compare with (17.34)); also, it can be shown that Ei.k/ is
even with respect to k (Sect. 17.9.3):
Ei.k C g/ D Ei.k/ ;
Ei.k/ D Ei.k/ :
(17.49)
When a ﬁnite structure is considered, supplemented with the periodic boundary
condition discussed in Sect. 17.5.3, vector k is discrete. On the other hand, for the
derivation of (17.47) it is irrelevant whether k is continuous or discrete; hence, the
analysis carried out in this section still holds for a discrete k, provided the additional
relations derived in Sect. 17.5.3, that describe the form of k and the corresponding
densities, are accounted for. It must be remarked that the number Ns of cells along
each direction in the direct lattice is typically very large.10 As a consequence,
a change by one unity of ns in (17.37) is much smaller than the corresponding
denominator Ns, so that for all practical purposes Ei.k/ is treated as a function of
continuous variables when the derivatives with respect to the components of k enter
the calculations.
The analysis carried out in this section clariﬁes the role of k. In fact, for a
given band index i, k labels the energy eigenvalue; for this reason, remembering
the discussion about spin carried out in Sect. 15.5, k and the quantum number
associated with spin determine the state of the particle. For fermions, the quantum
number associated with spin has two possible values, so that two states with opposite
spins are associated with each k vector. When the periodic boundary conditions
are considered, the density of k vectors in the k space is given by (17.38), and
the combined density of k vectors in the r; k space is given by (17.39). As a
consequence, the density of states in the k space and in the r; k space are given,
respectively, by

9Typically, a graphic representation of Ei.k/ is achieved by choosing a crystal direction and
drawing the one-dimensional restriction of Ei along such a direction. Examples are given in
Sect. 17.6.5.
10For instance, in a cube of material with an atomic density of 6:41027 m3, the number of atoms

17.6.1
Wave Packet in a Periodic Potential
From the solution of the Schrödinger equation worked out from (17.48) one
reconstructs the periodic part of the Bloch function using the second relation
in (17.43). Such a function inherits the band index i, so that the Bloch functions11
read wi k D i k exp.i k  r/; they form a complete set so that, letting !i k D !i.k/ D
Ei.k/=„, the expansion of the wave function  .r; t/ in terms of the eigenfunctions
of the periodic Hamiltonian operator (17.40) reads
 .r; t/ D
X

ci k wi k.r/ exp.i !i k t/ D
X
i k
ci k i k.r/ expŒi .k  r  !i k t/ ;
(17.51)
with ci k D hwi kj itD0 a set of constants. The expansion (17.51) bears a strong sim-
ilarity with that of the wave packet describing a free particle (compare with (9.1)),
the only difference between the two expansions being the periodic factor i k.r/. The
similarity suggests that an approximate expression of the wave packet is achieved
by following the same reasoning as in Sect. 9.6, namely, by expanding !i.k/ around
the average value k0 of the wave vector and retaining the ﬁrst-order term of the
expansion12:
!i.k/ ' !i.k0/ C ui.k0/  .k  k0/ ;
ui.k0/ D .gradk!i/0 ;
(17.52)
with ui the group velocity of the ith band. The approximation holds as long as
jRij t  2 , where Ri is the rest of the expansion. Letting !i 0 D !i.k0/,
i 0 D i.k0/, and ˚i 0 D k0  r  !i 0 t, the approximate expression of  reads
 .r; t/ '
X
i k
ci k i 0 exp.i ˚i 0/ exp Œi .r  ui t/  .k  k0/ :
(17.53)
The envelope function is now deﬁned as in (9.26), the difference being that a sum
is used here instead of an integral:
A .r  ui t I k0/ D
X
k
ci k exp Œi .r  ui t/  .k  k0/ ;
(17.54)
so that

i 0 exp.i ˚i 0/ A .r  ui t I k0/ :
(17.55)
11Here the periodic part of wi k is indicated with i k to avoid confusion with the group velocity.
12In the case of a free particle (Sect. 9.6) the approximation neglects only the second order because
!.k/ has a quadratic dependence on the components of k. Here, instead, the expansion has in
general all terms due to the more complicate form of !i.k/, so the neglected rest Ri contains
inﬁnite terms.

As a further approximation one considers the fact that the number of k vectors
of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone is in general very large, because it equals the number Nc
of direct-lattice cells. It follows that although the set of eigenfunctions belonging
to a single branch is not complete, such a set is still able to provide an acceptable
description of the wave packet. In this case one ﬁxes the branch index, say, i D n,
so that  .r; t/ ' n 0 exp.i ˚n 0/ A.r  un t I k0/. It follows

In (17.56), the periodic factor jun 0.r/j2 is a rapidly oscillating term whose period
is of the order of the lattice constant; such a term does not provide any information
about the particle’s localization. This information, in fact, is carried by the envelope
function, like in the case of a free particle outlined in Sect. 9.6. A one-dimensional
example about how (17.56) is built up is given in Figs. 17.7, 17.8, 17.9, and 17.10.
17.6.2
Parabolic-Band Approximation
The dispersion relation En.k/ obtained from the solution of the Schrödinger
equation (17.40) in a periodic lattice fulﬁlls the periodicity condition given by the
ﬁrst expression in (17.49). As a consequence, En.k/ has necessarily a number of
extremum points within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone or at the boundary of it.13
13As mentioned in Sect. 17.6, En.k/ is considered as a function of a continuous vector variable k
even when the periodic boundary conditions are assumed.

In view of further developments of the theory it is useful to investigate the form of
En.k/ in the vicinity of such extremum points. To this purpose, the absolute minima
are considered ﬁrst; for a given branch index n assume that the number of such
minima is MC, and let ka be the value of k at the ath minimum, a D 1; : : : ; MC,
with EC D En.ka/. At k D ka the Hessian matrix of En.k/ is symmetric and positive

14The parabolic-band approximation is not necessarily limited to absolute minima or absolute
maxima; here it is worked out with reference to such cases because they are the most interesting
ones. However, it applies as well to relative minima and relative maxima. The different values of
the inverse, effective-mass tensor’s entries between an absolute and a relative minimum of a branch
in GaAs give rise to interesting physical effects (Sect. 17.6.6).

17.6
Schrödinger Equation in a Periodic Lattice
363
It is important to note that the expressions of the parabolic-band approximation
given in this section have been worked out in a speciﬁc reference of the k space,
namely, the reference where the Hessian matrix is diagonal. In so doing, the
reference of the direct space r has been ﬁxed as well, because the two references
are reciprocal to each other (Sect. 17.3). In other terms, when diagonal expressions
like (17.59) or (17.64) are used in a calculation of dynamic properties, the reference
in the r space cannot be chosen arbitrarily.
17.6.3
Density of States in the Parabolic-Band Approximation
Calculations related to many-particle systems often involve the density of states
in energy (e.g., Sects. 15.8.1,15.8.2). The calculation of this quantity is relatively
simple for the dispersion relation En.k/ in the parabolic-band approximation,
because the dispersion relation is quadratic in the components of k and, in turn,
the density of the k vectors is constant. In fact, it is found from (B.34) that in the
three-dimensional case a quadratic expression A D u2 C v2 C w2 yields a density
of states equal to A1=2. It is then sufﬁcient to reduce (17.59) and (17.64) to the
quadratic expression above. Taking (17.59) by way of example, one disposes of
the multiplicative factors and the shift in the origin by applying the Herring-Vogt
transformation

Crystals of Si, Ge, and GaAs
Among semiconductors, silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and gallium arsenide (GaAs)
are very important for the electronic industry. This section is devoted to illustrating
some properties of their crystal and energy-band structures. The crystals of silicon
and germanium are of the face-centered, cubic type; the reciprocal lattices have the

elementary, body-centered
cubic block of silicon or
germanium. The side of the

body-centered, cubic structure. The lattice constants, that is, the physical sizes of the
unit cell, are the same in the Œ100, Œ010, and Œ001 directions (Sect. 17.9.1). Their
values at T D 300 K are given in Table 17.1 [99]. The crystals of the materials under
consideration are formed by elementary blocks like that shown in Fig. 17.11. Each
atom has four electrons in the external shell, so that it can form four chemical bonds
with other identical atoms; the latter place themselves symmetrically in space, to
build up the tetrahedral structure shown in the ﬁgure. In this structure, which is of
the body-centered cubic type with a side equal to one half the lattice constant a, the
chemical bonds of the central atom are saturated, whereas the atoms placed at the
vertices still have three bonds unsaturated; as a consequence, they may behave as
centers of new tetrahedral structures identical to the original one.
An example of this is given in Fig. 17.12: the top half of the ﬁgure shows two
replicas of the elementary block of Fig. 17.11 sharing an atom belonging to an
upper corner, while the bottom half of the ﬁgure shows again two replicas, this
time sharing an atom belonging to a lower corner. The atoms drawn in white do
not belong to any of the elementary blocks considered in the ﬁgure, and serve the
purpose of demonstrating how the rest of the crystal is connected to them. Note
that the structure in the bottom half of Fig. 17.12 is identical to that of the top half,
the difference being simply that one structure is rotated by 90 degrees with respect
to the other on a vertical axis. The construction is now completed by bringing the
two halves together, as shown in Fig. 17.13; this provides the diamond structure
mentioned in Sect. 17.2. Such a structure is of the face-centered, cubic type, with an
additional atom at the center of each tetrahedral block.
The minimum distance d among the atoms (interatomic distance) is the distance
from the atom in the center of the tetrahedral elementary block to any of the atoms
at its vertices; its relation with the lattice constant is easily found to be

Band Structure of Si, Ge, and GaAs
Coming now to the description of the band structure, it is important to focus on the
bands that are able to contribute to the electric conduction of the material. In fact,
considering the aim of manufacturing electronic devices out of these materials, the
bands that do not contribute to the electric current are not relevant. It is intuitive

17.6
Schrödinger Equation in a Periodic Lattice
367
that a band with no electrons, that is, whose states have a zero probability of being
occupied, is not able to provide any conduction; it is less intuitive (in fact, this is
demonstrated in Sect. 19.3) that a band whose states are fully occupied does not
provide any conduction either. It follows that the only bands of interest are those
where only a fraction of the electronic states are occupied. Although a discussion
involving the electric current must necessarily refer to a nonequilibrium condition, it
is easier to base the reasoning upon the equilibrium condition at some temperature
T; in fact, in this case the occupation probability of the electronic states is given
by the Fermi-Dirac statistics (15.49). As a consequence, the number of electrons
belonging to a band whose energy values range, say, from Ea to Eb, is given by the
ﬁrst relation in (15.48) with ˛ C ˇ E D .E  EF/=.kB T/, namely,
Nab D

(17.76)
As mentioned in Sect. 17.6 each branch of the dispersion relation Ei.k/ spans an
energy band. In many cases the bands are disjoint from each other, namely, energy
intervals exist that contain no eigenvalue of the Schrödinger equation (17.40). Such
intervals are called forbidden bands or gaps. In the equilibrium condition the energy
of an electron can never belong to a gap, no matter what the value of the occupation
probability is, because the density of states is zero there. Also, at a given temperature
the position of the Fermi level EF is either within a band (edges included), or
within a gap; the latter case, typical of semiconductors, is illustrated with the aid
of Fig. 17.14, where it is assumed (using the units of .E  EF/=.kB T/) that a gap
exists between the energies EV, EC such that .EV  EF/=.kB T/ D 0:15 and
.EC  EF/=.kB T/ D C0:15. In other terms, EV is the upper energy edge of a band,
and EC the lower energy edge of the next band. These assumptions also imply that
the Fermi level coincides with the gap’s midpoint. As will become apparent below,
the two bands that are separated by the Fermi level are especially important; for this
reason they are given speciﬁc names: the band whose absolute maximum is EV is
called valence band, that whose absolute minimum is EC is called conduction band.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the case is considered (typical of Si, Ge, and GaAs)
where the gap’s width contains the main variation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics15;
as a consequence, the occupation probability becomes vanishingly small as the
difference E  EC becomes larger, so that only the energy states near the absolute
minimum EC have a nonvanishing probability of being occupied. Thank to this
reasoning, to the purpose of calculating (17.76) one can replace the density of
states g.E/ with the simpliﬁed expression (17.72) deduced from the parabolic-
band approximation; such an expression, g.E/ / pE  EC, is shown in Fig. 17.14
in arbitrary units, along with the g.E/ P.E/ product (thick line), that represents
15The extension of the energy region where the main variation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics occurs
is estimated in Prob. 15.1.

the integrand of (17.76) with reference to the conduction band. To make it more
visible, the g.E/ P.E/ product is drawn in a scale ampliﬁed by 103 with respect to
that of g.E/ alone. The number of electrons belonging to the conduction band is
proportional to the area subtended by the g.E/ P.E/ curve.
Coming now to the valence band, the probability 1  P.E/ that a state at energy
E is empty becomes vanishingly small as the difference EV  E becomes larger,
so that only the energy states near the absolute maximum EV have a nonvanishing
probability of being empty. Empty states are also called holes. The number of holes
is given by an integral similar to (17.76), where P.E/ is replaced with 1  P.E/.

Also in this case one can use for the density of states the parabolic-band approxi-
mation; such an expression, g.E/ / pEV  E, is shown in Fig. 17.14 in arbitrary
units, along with the g.E/ Œ1  P.E/ product (thin line). As before, the product is
drawn in a scale ampliﬁed by 103 with respect to that of g.E/ alone. The number
of holes belonging to the valence band is proportional to the area subtended by the
g.E/ Œ1  P.E/ curve.
Thanks to the spatial uniformity of the crystal, the concentration of the electrons
in the conduction band is obtained by dividing their number by the crystal volume
 or, equivalently, by replacing the density of states in energy g with the combined

for holes. The explicit expressions of the concentrations are given in Sect. 18.3. Here
it is important to remark that the perfect symmetry of the curves g.E/ P.E/ and
g.E/ Œ1P.E/ in Fig. 17.14 is due to the simplifying assumptions that EF coincides
with the gap’s midpoint and that MV m3=2

(compare with (17.73)
and (17.74)). Neither hypothesis is actually true, so that in real cases the two curves
are not symmetric; however, as shown in Sect. 18.3, the areas subtended by them are
nevertheless equal to each other.
Valence Band
The valence band of Si, Ge, and GaAs is made of two branches of E.k/, having the
same absolute maximum EV at k D 0 (so that MV D 2), but different curvatures.
They are shown in Fig. 17.15, where the horizontal axis coincides with the Œ100
direction in the k space, corresponding to the scalar variable k1. As a consequence,
the origin of the horizontal axis coincides with the  point (Sect. 17.4); the axis
intersects the boundary of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone at the X points (not shown in the
ﬁgure). The origin of the vertical axis coincides with EV. The two branches are not
spherically symmetric; in fact, letting EV D 0, the dependence of each of them on
the spherical coordinates k; #; ' has the form [70, Sect. 8.7]

called warped. In the parabolic-band approximation the angular part j is neglected
with respect to unity, and the two branches become spherically symmetric around
k D 0; still with EV D 0, the dependence on k1 of each branch has the form E D
˛ k2
1=2, where the constant ˛ is smaller in the upper branch (indicated by the thick
line in Fig. 17.15), and larger in the lower one. As a consequence, the corresponding
component of the effective-mass tensor (17.63), that reads in this case m1 D „2=˛,

is larger in the upper branch and smaller in the lower one. For this reason, the holes
associated with the energy states of the upper branch are called heavy holes, those
associated with the lower branch are called light holes.
The analysis is identical in the other two directions Œ010 and Œ001 so that, for
each branch of the valence band, the diagonal entries of the effective-mass tensor
are equal to each other. Such tensors then read mhh I , mhl I , with I the identity
tensor; the ﬁrst index of the scalar effective mass stands for “hole,” while the second
one stands for “heavy” or “light.” The second-order expansions around EV take

respectively. The values of mhh and mhl at room temperature Ta are listed in
Table 17.3 [128, Sect. 2-3]; they are normalized to the rest mass of the free electron,
m0 ' 9:11  1031 kg. The effective masses depend in general on temperature
because a change in the latter modiﬁes the lattice constants: as a consequence, the
characteristic vectors of the reciprocal lattice change as well, thus deforming the
dispersion relation E.k/; on the other hand, the variation of the effective masses
with temperature is weak, so it is typically neglected.17
Conduction Band
The conduction band of Si, Ge, and GaAs has only one branch. However, the
absolute minima (also called valleys) are placed differently. In GaAs there is only
one absolute minimum at k D 0, with spherical symmetry. In the parabolic-band
approximation, the constant-energy surface is given by

17In contrast, the temperature dependence of the energy gap, due to the deformation of the
dispersion relation, cannot be neglected because of its strong effect on the carrier concentration
(Sect. 18.3).

The conduction band of Si has six absolute minima (MC D 6), grouped into three

The conduction band of Ge has eight absolute minima, grouped into four pairs.
The pairs belong to the four f111g directions and are placed at the boundary of the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Fig. 17.19); thus, only four absolute minima must be accounted
for (MC D 4). In the parabolic-band approximation, the surfaces at constant energy
of the conduction band of Ge are ellipsoids of revolution about the corresponding
axis; like in silicon, for each ellipsoid the longitudinal mass corresponds to the
direction of the axis itself, while the transverse masses correspond to the directions
normal to it. The values of ml and mt at room temperature Ta, normalized to the rest
mass of the free electron, are listed in Table 17.4 [128, Sect. 2-3].

Further Comments About the Band Structure
As better detailed in Sects. 19.5.2 and 19.5.3, among the coefﬁcients of the equations
describing the transport phenomena in a semiconductor are the electron and hole
mobilities, that enter the relation between current density and electric ﬁeld in a
uniform material. For the conduction band of the semiconductors considered here,
and in the parabolic-band approximation, the electron mobility n turns out to be
proportional to 1=mn D .2=mt C 1=ml/=3, that is, a weighed average of the entries
of the inverse, effective-mass tensor.18 Table 17.4 shows that GaAs has the largest
value of 1=mn; thus, it is expected to have the largest mobility, which is indeed the
case. As far as holes are concerned, the effective masses of heavy holes of Si, Ge,
and GaAs are similar to each other; also the effective masses of light holes have
the same order of magnitude. Besides, considering that the valence band has two
branches of E.k/, the effective masses do not combine in the simple way as for the
conduction band.
The secondary minima of GaAs, placed at an energy EC C E with E ' 0:36
eV (Fig. 17.16), have a larger effective mass than the absolute minimum; due to
18If the magnitudes of mt and ml are signiﬁcantly different, the smaller effective mass dictates the
magnitude of mn.

Periodic Structures
this, the mobility of the electrons in the upper valleys is smaller than that of
the electrons populating the absolute minimum. As E is relatively small, the
population of the secondary minima is not negligible; in a nonequilibrium condition,
the scattering events tend to increase the electron population of the upper valleys
at the expense of that of the absolute minimum, with a ratio between the upper
and lower population that depends on the applied electric ﬁeld. This gives rise to
a negative differential resistivity in the current-to-voltage curve of the material,
i.e., an operating region exists where the current density decreases as the electric
ﬁeld increases. The phenomenon is called Ridley-Watkins-Hilsum mechanism [128,
Sect. 14-3].
In semiconductors, the absorption of energy from an electromagnetic ﬁeld may
induce the transition of an electron from a state belonging to the valence band to
a state belonging to the conduction band. Such a transition increases by one the
number of electrons in the conduction band and, at the same time, increases by
one the number of holes in the valence band; for this reason it is called generation
of an electron-hole pair. The opposite phenomenon may also occur, namely, a
release of electromagnetic energy due to the transition of an electron from a state
belonging to the conduction band to a state belonging to the valence band. Such
a transition decreases by one the number of electrons in the conduction band
and, at the same time, decreases by one the number of holes in the valence band
(recombination of an electron-hole pair). It is worth pointing out that generation
and recombination events may also occur with an energy absorption from, or
release to, an external agent different from the electromagnetic ﬁeld (e.g., the
agent could be a vibrational mode of the lattice); for this reason, the phenomena
considered here better speciﬁed as generations-recombinations of the radiative
type. In GaAs, the minimum of the conduction band and the maxima of the two
branches of the valence band correspond to the same value of k; semiconductors
fulﬁlling this condition are called direct-gap semiconductors. Instead, Si and Ge are
indirect-gap semiconductors, because the maxima of the valence band correspond
to k D 0, whereas the minima of the conduction band correspond to k ¤ 0.
Direct- and indirect-gap semiconductors behave differently as far as generation-
recombination of the radiative type are concerned; in fact, the probability of such
events is much higher in direct-gap semiconductors. This explains why some classes
of solid-state optical devices like, e.g., lasers, are manufactured using direct-gap
semiconductors.19
19The reasoning seems to contradict the fact that large-area, solid-state optical sensors used in
cameras and video cameras, based on the CCD or CMOS architecture, are made of silicon. In fact,
the complex structure of these several-megapixel sensors and related signal-management circuitry
can be realized only with the much more advanced technology of silicon. The relative ease of
fabricating complex structures largely compensates for the poorer optical properties of the material.

Subbands
The calculations of the density of states carried out so far have been based on
the assumption that all components of the k vector can be treated as continuous
variables. In particular, the adoption of the parabolic-band approximation in the case
of a periodic lattice (Sect. 17.6) leads to expressions for the density of states g.E/
and combined density of states .E/ that are formally identical to those obtained for
a particle in a three-dimensional box (Sect. 15.9.2). However, in some situations it
happens that not all components of k may be treated as continuous. To describe this
case it is convenient to use the example of the box ﬁrst; that of the periodic lattice is
worked out later, in the frame of the parabolic-band approximation.
To proceed, consider like in Sect.. 15.9.2 a three-dimensional box whose sides
have lengths d1; d2; d3, so that the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation are

The distance between two consecutive projections of k along the ith side is ki D

d1 d2 d3 the volume of the box in the r space. The density of the k vectors in the k
space is Qk D V=3.

Now, in contrast to what was implicitly assumed in Sect. 15.9.2, let one side of the
box be much different from the others, for instance, d2  d1, d3  d1; d2. It follows
that k3  k1; k2. If the magnitudes involved are such that k1; k2 may still be
considered continuous variables, while k3 cannot, one must calculate the density of
states by treating k1, k2 differently from k3. Considering k1 D n1 =d1, k2 D n2 =d2

ﬁxed s the states are distributed over the circumference of radius cs: such a set of
states is also called subband.
The density of states in energy of the subband thus deﬁned is calculated following
the same reasoning as in Sect. 15.9.3: in fact, one observes that the density of k
vectors in the two-dimensional space k1; k2 is d1d2=2, namely, the inverse of the
area 2=.d1d2/ associated with each k belonging to the given circumference. Then,
the total number of k vectors in a circle of radius cs is

Remembering that indices n1; n2 are positive, it is necessary to consider only the

to multiply it by 2 to account for electron spin. In conclusion, the density of states

while k2; k3 cannot, one must calculate the density of states by treating k1 differently
from k2; k3. Considering k1 D n1=d1 as continuous, ﬁx E, r, s in the relations

Subbands in a Periodic Lattice
The calculations leading to (17.96) consider the case of a box within which the
potential energy is zero (as a consequence, the total energy E is purely kinetic),
and prescribe a vanishing wave function at the boundaries. If a periodic lattice is
present, with the provisions indicated in Sect. 17.5.3 one can apply the periodic
boundary conditions. In this case, the spacing between the components of k in each
direction doubles (ni =di  2 ni =di), but the number of components doubles
as well (ni D 1; 2; : : :  ni D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :), so the density of states remains
the same. In a semiconductor the calculation leading to the density of states is
made more complicate by the presence of the lattice. However, the analysis may
be brought to a simple generalization of that carried out in a box by means of the
following simpliﬁcations:
•
It is assumed that a band structure exists even if the size of the device is small
in one or two spatial directions. In fact, it can be shown that the presence of a
number of atomic planes of the order of ten is sufﬁcient to form a band structure.
•
The analysis is limited to the case of parabolic bands.
The case of the conduction band of silicon is considered by way of example, with
the k1; k2; k3 axes placed along the Œ100; Œ010; Œ001 directions. The parabolic-band
approximation yields for the kinetic energies Ee1, Ee2, Ee3  0 the expressions
given in (17.82), (17.83), and (17.84); the other three kinetic energies Ee4, Ee5, Ee6
are derived from Ee1, Ee2, Ee3, respectively, by letting km  km. Apart from the
constant EC, the energies Ee1; Ee2; : : : are simpliﬁed forms of the eigenvalues of
the Schrödinger equation (17.40). Conversely, to the purpose of determining the
corresponding eigenfunctions, one may view Ee1; Ee2; : : : as the exact eigenvalues
of simpliﬁed forms of the original Hamiltonian operator (17.40), that hold near the
band’s minima; such simpliﬁed forms are expected to be of the purely kinetic type.
They are found by replacing ki with i d=dxi in (17.82), (17.83), and (17.84), thus

One notes that the k vectors and the eigenfunctions are not inﬂuenced by the
effective masses, whereas the eigenvalues are. As a consequence, the density of

Such a density of states is not affected by interchanging the effective masses; thus,

Like in the case of a box, the distance between two consecutive projections of

k1 k2 k3 D 3=V, with V D d1d2d3. The density of the k vectors in the k
space is Qk D V=3.
Consider now the case of a two-dimensional layer, namely, d2  d1, while d3 

In conclusion, for a two-dimensional layer with d3  d1; d2 and n3 D 1, within the

g.1;2;4;5/
2D;n3D2 is the same as above, however, it holds for E  4 Et. It adds up to the value
found for n3 D 1, giving rise to a stair-like form of g.1;2;4;5/
2D
as a function of energy.
The same is obtained for g.3;6/
2D;n3D2 when E  4 El, and so on. An example of such a
density of states is sketched in Fig. 17.20, where the ratio g.1;2;4;5/
2D

2D;n3D1 is shown
as a function of E=Et. The total density of states is found by adding up the two stair-
like functions. From Table 17.4 one ﬁnds that in silicon at room temperature it is
ml ' 0:97 m0, mt ' 0:19 m0, whence Et ' 5:1 El and g.1;2;4;5/
2D;n3D1 ' 4:47 g.3;6/

As shown by Fig. 17.20, the derivative of the density of states with respect to
energy diverges at some points. Such divergences are called Van Hove singularities
[3, Chap. 8].

Calculation of Vibrational Spectra
The discussion carried out in Sect. 16.6 has led to the conclusion that in the case
of solid matter the nuclei, being massive and tightly bound together, are expected
to depart little from their equilibrium positions R0. The classical description of the
nuclear motion is thus brought to the case already solved in Sects. 3.9 and 3.10: the
vibrational state of the nuclei is described in terms of the normal coordinates b,

whose conjugate momenta are Pb, and the total energy of the nuclei reads (compare
with (3.50))

H D 1

(17.118)
where each H corresponds to one degree of freedom and ! > 0 is the angular
frequency of the corresponding mode. The system is completely separable in the
normal coordinates, and each normal coordinate evolves in time as a linear harmonic
oscillator. The calculation is based on Classical Mechanics; it is carried out in this
chapter because it exploits the periodicity properties of the material and, in this
respect, presents several analogies with the solution of the Schrödinger equation
in a periodic lattice. To determine the vibrational frequencies ! it is necessary to
solve the eigenvalue equation (3.43), namely,
C g D !2
 M g ;
 D 1; : : : ; 3 N ;
(17.119)
with g the eigenvectors. The entries of C, M are given by
cpn D ŒCpn D
 @2Va
@hp @hn


;
ŒMpn D n ıpn ;
(17.120)
where Va is the potential energy, hp the displacement of the pth degree of freedom
with respect to the equilibrium position, p the mass associated with the pth degree
of freedom, and ıpn the Kronecker symbol (A.18).
The calculation is in principle the same for any system of particles; however, if
the system has special properties, they reﬂect into the form of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. A particularly important case is that of a periodic structure, such as a
crystal. Considering this case, let the crystal be made of Nc elementary cells, with a
basis made of Nb nuclei (the deﬁnition of basis is in Sect. 17.2). It follows that the
total number of nuclei is N D Nb Nc, and the total number of degrees of freedom
is 3 N. With respect to a given origin O (Fig. 17.22), the mth cell of the lattice is
identiﬁed by the corresponding translation vector of the direct lattice, lm; the latter
determines a local origin within the mth cell. In turn, the equilibrium position of the
˛th nucleus of the mth cell with respect to the local origin is identiﬁed by a vector
e˛ of the direct lattice.
17.7.1
Labeling the Degrees of Freedom—Dynamic Matrix
To proceed, it is convenient to label the degrees of freedom in such a way as to
distinguish the indices of the cells from those of the basis and of the coordinate

displacements, which are more conveniently expressed in terms of three indices:

(17.122)
The entries of C are identiﬁed in the same manner:

The order of derivation is irrelevant, so that cnˇw

is ﬁnite, the crystal is not actually periodic; as indicated in Sect. 17.5.3, periodicity
is recovered by imposing periodic boundary conditions to the quantities of interest
(Sect. 17.5.3).20 With this provision, the entries of C are invariant with respect to
the lattice translations. The latter are related only to the cell indices m; n and are
obtained by the replacements lm  lm C l, ln  ln C l, with  any integer. In
particular, taking l D ln yields
20As mentioned in Sect. 17.5.3, the periodic boundary conditions are actually an approximation;
however, the interatomic interactions typically give rise to short-range forces, hence the above
reasoning holds for all the cells that are not too close to the boundaries.

The above shows that the entries of C depend on the relative positions of the cells.
Due to the invariance of C with respect to the lattice translations one sees that, given
˛; u and ˇ; w, there are only Nc distinct entries of C out of N2
c, namely, the distinct
entries are those such that m  n D 0, m  n D 1; : : : , m  n D Nc  1. In fact, all
remaining N2
c  Nc entries are derived from the ﬁrst Nc ones by suitable translations
of the indices. In turn, using the new indices (17.124) the entries of M read

m˛u;
(17.126)
where the last equality is due to the fact that the mass of a given nucleus of the cell
does not depend on the cell position within the crystal nor on the coordinate axis.
In the new indices the eigenvalue equation (17.119) becomes

Application of the Bloch Theorem
As a consequence of the translation invariance of D, Bloch’s theorem (17.23)
applies,21 namely, for any eigenvector of indices pe, and letting l0 D 0, the
following holds:
ze.lp/ D exp.c  lp/ ze.0/ :
(17.131)
In (17.131), c is any complex vector of the reciprocal lattice, and p D 0; : : : ; Nc 1;
 D 1; : : : ; Nb; e D 1; 2; 3. The complex form of the eigenvectors is adopted for
convenience; at the end of the calculation, a set of real eigenvectors is recovered
from suitable combinations of the complex ones. Using the periodic boundary
conditions, the expression of c is found to be
c D i q ;
q D
3
X
sD1
s
Ns
2  bs ;
(17.132)
with N1; N2; N3 the number of cells along the directions of the characteristic vectors
of the direct lattice, b1; b2; b3 the characteristic vectors of the reciprocal lattice,
and 1; 2; 3 integers, with s D 0; 1; : : : ; Ns  1. The total number of distinct q
vectors is thus N1 N2 N3 D Nc. Comparing (17.132) with (17.37) shows that the
structure of the q vector is the same as that of the k vector found in the solution of
the Schrödinger equation (Sect. 17.5.3). Inserting (17.130) into (17.129) yields, for
the line of indices m˛u of the eigenvalue equation,

(17.134)
As the eigenvalues !2 are real, the matrix made of the entries Anˇw

Hermitean; in fact, this is easily found by observing that D is real and symmetric:

(17.135)
Another property stems from the expression at the left-hand side of (17.133),
21The Bloch theorem was derived in Sect. 17.5.1 with reference to eigenfunctions that depend on a
continuous parameter like, e.g., vector c; the theorem equally holds for a translationally invariant
operator in the discrete case, like the dynamic matrix considered here.

m˛u does not depend on m. This is
easily veriﬁed by carrying out the sum ﬁrst with, say, m D 1, then with m D 2, and
observing that the terms of the second sum are the same as in the ﬁrst one, displaced
by one position. In summary, letting A be the 3 Nb  3 Nb, Hermitean matrix of

(17.138)
For a given q, (17.138) is an eigenvalue equation of order 3 Nb, whose eigenvalues
are found by solving the algebraic equation
det .A  !2 I/ D 0 ;
(17.139)
with I the identity matrix. As the entries of A depend on q, the calculation of the
3 Nb eigenvalues of (17.138) must be repeated for each distinct value of q, namely,
Nc times. The total number of eigenvalues thus found is 3 Nb  Nc D 3 N, as should
be. This result shows that while the translation invariance eliminates the dependence
on lm, it introduces that on q. As the number of different determinations of the two
vectors lm and q is the same, namely, Nc, the total number of eigenvalues is not
affected. Letting the Nc determinations of q be numbered as q1; q2 : : : qp : : :, the
algebraic system (17.138) is recast as
X
ˇw
Aˇw
˛u .qp/ zˇw.0; qp/ D !2.qp/ z˛u.0; qp/ ;
p D 1; 2; : : : Nc
(17.140)
which, for each qp, yields 3 Nb eigenvalues !2 and 3 Nb eigenvectors of length 3 Nb;
as a consequence, the set of column vectors made of the eigenvectors associated
with qp forms a 3 Nb  3 Nb matrix, indicated here with Z1p. By letting qp span
over all its Nc determinations, the total number of eigenvalues turns out to be 3 N,
namely,

 D 1; : : : ; Nb ;

Similarly, the total number of eigenvectors (of order 3 Nb) turns out to be 3 N,
ze.0; q1/ ; : : : ; ze.0; qNc/ ;
 D 1; : : : ; Nb ;
e D 1; 2; 3 :
(17.142)
They provide the set of Nc square matrices of order 3 Nb, indicated with Z11, Z12; : : :,
Z1Nc. Finally, each ze.0; qp/ provides an eigenvector of order 3 N whose entries are

(17.143)

p D 1; : : : ; Nc. The ﬁrst index of matrices Z11; Z12; : : : corresponds to m D 0.
Similarly, index m D 1 provides a new set of matrices Z21; Z22; : : :, and so on.

Properties of the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

det Œ.A  !2 I/ D det Œ.A  !2 I/T D det .A  !2 I/ :
(17.145)
This shows that the eigenvalue equation A.qp/ z.0; qp/ D !2 .qp/ z.0; qp/, and
its conjugate, A.qp/ z.0; qp/ D !2 .qp/ z.0; qp/ have the same eigenvalues.
Moreover, as the entries (17.137) of A are polynomials in expŒi qp  .ln  lm/ with

(17.146)
The above properties give rise to other important consequences for the eigenvalues

of A one ﬁnds

showing that the eigenvalues calculated from A.qp/ are the same as those

A.qp/ z.0; qp/ D !2.qp/ z.0; qp/ :
(17.148)
Taking the conjugate of the second equation in (17.148) and using again the relation

The above result shows that in the harmonic approximation, the displacements have
the form of a superposition of plane and monochromatic waves, whose wave vector
and angular frequency are qp, !e.qp/. The wave corresponding to a given qp is
called vibrational mode. Typically, the number of qp vectors is very large; in such
cases, the same reasoning made in Sect. 17.6 with reference to the k vectors holds,
and q is considered a continuous variable ranging over the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
Function !e.q/ is also called dispersion relation, and is viewed as a multi-
valued function of q having 3Nb branches. For each branch, letting q D jqj, the
wavelength is deﬁned by  D 2 =q and the phase velocity by uf D !=q D  ,
with  D !=.2/ the frequency. The group velocity is deﬁned by u D gradq!. As
shown in Sect. 3.10, the total energy of the system is the sum of the mode energies,
and in the classical description is expressed in terms of the initial conditions as

As remarked in Sect. 12.5, the classical expression of the energy associated with
each mode has the same form as that of a mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In turn,
the energy quantization shows that each mode energy is made of terms of the form
„!e.q/, thus leading to the concept of phonon (Eqs. (12.35,12.36)).
17.8
Interaction of an Electron with the Lattice
The calculation of the vibrational spectra, carried out in Sect. (17.7) using the
harmonic approximation, yields expression (17.152) for the displacements of the
nuclei with respect to the equilibrium positions. More precisely, (17.152) provides,
in classical terms, the uth component of the instantaneous displacement of the
˛th atom of the mth cell, where ˛ is the mass of the ˛th atom of the basis
and qp a vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice belonging to the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone; the form of this vector is given by the second relation in (17.132), namely,
qp D P3
sD1.ps=Ns/ 2  bs, with ps D 0; 1; : : : ; Ns  1. The quantity z˛u
e .0; qp/
in (17.152) is the component of indices ˛ u of the eigenvector of indices  e of
the 3 Nb  3 Nb dynamic matrix associated with qp. In turn, Qbpe0 is a constant that
depends on the initial conditions of the normal coordinate bpe.t/. Finally, the phases
in (17.152) are deﬁned by (17.153), where the angular frequency !e.qp/ > 0 is the
positive square root of the eigenvalue of indices  e of the 3 Nb3 Nb dynamic matrix
associated with qp. In summary, in the harmonic approximation the displacements
have the form of a superposition of plane and monochromatic waves, with wave
vector qp and angular frequency !e.qp/.
It must be remembered that the solution of the single-electron Schrödinger
equation in a periodic lattice, carried out in Sect. 17.6, is based on the hypothesis that
the nuclei are kept ﬁxed in the equilibrium positions, so that the force acting on the

17.8
Interaction of an Electron with the Lattice
391
electron derives from a potential energy V having the periodicity of the lattice. As a
consequence, the set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from the solution
of (17.40) do not account for the displacements of the nuclei produced by the lattice
vibrations. As remarked in Sect. 16.6, if the positions of the nuclei are kept ﬁxed, the
exchange of energy between the system of electrons and that of nuclei cannot take
place; in order to let such an exchange occur, it is necessary to incorporate the lattice
vibrations into the problem. This task is carried out below using the perturbative
approach, namely, starting from the set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
unperturbed problem and accounting for the effect of the lattice vibrations using the
ﬁrst-order perturbative approach of Chap. 14.
Let the equilibrium positions of the nuclei be R0m˛ D lm C e˛, with m D
1; : : : ; Nc and ˛ D 1; : : : ; Nb. In the above, e˛ is the vector connecting the center
of the mth cell with the equilibrium position of the ˛th atom of that cell; the
potential energy of the electron in the unperturbed case is V D V.r; R011; R012; : : :/.
Similarly, the displaced positions of the atoms are denoted with Rm˛ D R0m˛ Chm˛,
where hm˛ is the displacement vector of components hm˛u, u D 1; 2; 3; the
corresponding potential energy is Vdis D Vdis.r; R11; R12; : : :/ and the force acting
on the electron is  grad Vdis, where the gradient is calculated with respect to the
components of r. At this point it is necessary to better analyze the form of the
potential energy: if the latter were simply due to the combined effects of hydrogen-
like, Coulomb centers placed at the equilibrium positions of the atoms, its form
would be

(17.155)
The sum C˛ in (17.155) is made of Nc terms, each one containing a different
translation vector from l0 D 0 to lNc1. The perturbed form of the potential energy,
still in the hypothesis of hydrogen-like, Coulomb centers, is obtained by introducing
the displacements hm˛ into the denominators of (17.155). Actually, due to the
screening effect of the electrons the potential energy is more complicate than a
superposition of interactions of the Coulomb type. However, it is still reasonable
to assume that its form is of the type

U .r  lm  e˛  hm˛/ :
(17.156)
Another observation about the potential energy is that in a form like (17.155),
the largest contribution to the sum is given by the summand having the minimum
denominator. For example, assume that r is close to the equilibrium position of, say,
an atom belonging to the mth cell. In this case the denominator jr  lm  e˛  hm˛j
is small with respect to the other denominators, thus making the contribution of
the mth cell to the sum dominant. This property becomes even more pronounced
when the screening effect is accounted for, and may conveniently be exploited when
evaluating integrals over  like, e.g., (17.157) below.

Periodic Structures
Note that the potential energies V or, similarly, Vdis, are a different concept
from the potential energy Va used for the harmonic approximation of the lattice
vibrations: the latter is in fact the potential energy of the system of interacting nuclei
and, as a consequence, the ﬁrst-order term of its Taylor expansion with respect to
the displacements is zero when the series is started from the equilibrium condition,
namely, from the minimum of Va. Instead, the single-electron potential energy has
no special property even when the nuclei are in the equilibrium positions.
If Vdis as a whole is considered as the perturbation, the eigenfunctions of the
unperturbed problem, namely, those corresponding to Vdis D 0, are the spatial part
of planar waves; this yields for the perturbation-matrix entry22

As before, one ﬁnds that interchanging k with k0 transforms the integral in (17.160)
into its conjugate; thus, this property is retained also by the simpliﬁed form (17.159)
of Hk k0. From (17.159) one also ﬁnds that the perturbation-matrix entry is made of
different contributions; they are treated separately below.23
22The perturbation-matrix entry is indicated here with a capital letter to avoid confusion with the
displacements.
23Treating the contributions separately from each other may seem inconsistent due to the fact that
eventually the transition probability is found by squaring the modulus of the Fourier transform of
Hk k0 (Chap. 14). However, as shown below, the terms of Hk k0 are mutually incompatible due to

(17.161)
where g is an arbitrary translation vector of the scaled reciprocal lattice. As
illustrated in Chap. 14, the transition probability from state k to state k0 is obtained
from the Fourier transform with respect to time of the perturbation-matrix entry; in
particular, due to the absence of displacements the case considered here corresponds
to a perturbation constant in time (Sect. 14.8.1), so that the transition probability is
proportional to ı.Ek  Ek0/. In summary, the electron’s energy is conserved and the
following relations hold:
k D k0 C g ;
Ek D Ek0 :
(17.162)
This result describes a situation where the lattice acts as a rigid body and no
exchange of energy with the electron takes place. If Ek has a spherical symmetry,
from the second relation in (17.162) the equality of the moduli follows, k0 D k;
letting 2 # be the angle between k and k0 (Fig. 17.23), one obtains g D 2 k sin #.
The latter relation is recast in an interesting form by choosing an auxiliary set of
characteristic vectors a0

Energy Exchange Between Electron and Lattice

that one must consider the contribution deriving from i

In parallel, the time part acquires the extra factor expŒi !e.qp/ t, whence ı.Ek 
Ek0/ must be replaced with ıŒEk  Ek0  „ !e.qp/ (compare with the analysis of
the harmonic perturbation in Sect. 14.8.2). Thus, (17.162) is replaced with

k  qp D k0 C g ;
Ek D Ek0  „ !e.qp/ :
(17.169)
As !e.qp/ > 0, the relations involving energy in (17.168) and (17.169) are
mutually incompatible; they are also incompatible with (17.162). When (17.168)
applies, the electron emits a phonon24 of energy „ !e.qp/, which is absorbed by
the lattice; correspondingly, the electron’s momentum changes by „ k0  „ k D
„ qp  „ g. Here one lets k0  k D qp  g in the deﬁnition (17.160); the result is
further simpliﬁed by imposing that the three vectors k, k0, and qp belong to the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone. In this case, following the same reasoning as in Sect. 14.8.6 one ﬁnds
that if two of such vectors are prescribed, then the third one is uniquely deﬁned, and
the possible combinations of components of g are those listed in Table 14.1; also,
as qp is ﬁxed, the sum over p must eventually be dropped from (17.166).
When (17.169) applies, the electron absorbs a phonon of energy „ !e.qp/, which
is emitted by the lattice; correspondingly, the electron’s momentum changes by
„ k0  „ k D „ qp  „ g. The further prescription that k, k0, and qp belong to
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone yields for the components of g the combinations listed in
Table 14.2.
On must now consider the second summand in the expression (17.152) of the
displacement, namely,

(17.170)
The analysis is identical to that of h0
m˛.t/ and leads to the following result: when
the energy balance of (17.168) applies, then the relation between the wave vectors
is k  qp D k0 C g; observing that qp ¤ 0, the above is incompatible with the ﬁrst
relation in (17.168), hence only one of the two cases of phonon emission may occur.
Similarly, when the energy balance of (17.169) applies, then the relation between
the wave vectors is kCqp D k0Cg, incompatible with the ﬁrst relation in (17.169),
hence only one of the two cases of phonon absorption may occur.
It is worth observing that the approach of this section and that of Sect. 14.8.6
are different; however, the ﬁnal result is the same. In Sect. 14.8.6 it is assumed
that the unperturbed problem derives from the solution of the Schrödinger equation

with a periodic potential, whence the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed problem
are Bloch functions; then, it is assumed that the spatial part of the perturbation
has the form of a plane wave, W.r/ D W0 exp.i kd  r/. Here, the whole lattice
potential Vdis is considered as the perturbation, whence the eigenfunctions of the
unperturbed problem are planar waves.25 The key point is (17.158), which brings
in the displacement hm˛; the latter, in turn, brings in factor exp.i qp  lm/ through
(17.166), or factor exp.i qp  lm/ through (17.170). Comparing the expressions
shows in fact that kd in (14.62) is the analogue of qp in (17.167). As a consequence,
the selection rules are the same in the two approaches.

Crystal Planes and Directions in Cubic Crystals
From the general deﬁnition (17.1) of the translation vector, which provides the
positions of all nodes of the crystal, it follows that a crystal plane is deﬁned by
the set of all triads of integers m1; m2; m3 such that, for a given vector g0 of the
scaled reciprocal lattice, the quantity .m1 a1 C m2 a2 C m3 a3/  g0=.2 / equals
a ﬁxed integer. Such a plane is normal to g0. In turn, given two crystal planes
deﬁned as above using, respectively, two nonparallel vectors g1 and g2, a crystal
direction is deﬁned by the set of all triads of integers m1; m2; m3 that belong to the
two crystal planes so prescribed. In cubic crystals, the typical method by which the
crystal planes are identiﬁed is outlined below [128, Sect. 2-2].
Let the plane be indicated with …. After labeling the nodes by the respective
triads of integers m1; m2; m3, as shown in Fig. 17.24, one starts by ﬁnding the
intercepts of … with the directions of the characteristic vectors. Letting such
intercepts be .m
1; m
2; m
3/, the triad .r m
1; r m
2; r m
3/ with r ¤ 0 an integer, spans
a set of planes parallel to …. If M is the largest divisor of m
1; m
2; m
3, then the new
triad m0
i D m
i =M identiﬁes the plane …0 parallel to … and closest to the origin.
Then, the inverse of the triad’s elements is taken: 1=m0
1, 1=m0
2, 1=m0
3. This avoids
the occurrence of inﬁnities; in fact, if … was parallel to one of the characteristic
vectors, say, ai, then m
i and m0
i would become inﬁnite. One the other hand, using
the inverse indices may bring to fractional numbers, a circumstance that must be
avoided as well; so, as the last step, the new elements 1=m0
i are multiplied by the
least multiple N of the m0
i that are not inﬁnite:

Miller indices are found to be .0; 2; 1/.
The indices that turn out to be negative are marked with a bar; for instance, in
.hNkl/ the second index is negative. Some planes have the same symmetry; in cubic
crystals this happens, for instance, to planes .100/, .010/, .001/, .N100/, .0N10/, and
.00N1/. A set of planes with the same symmetry is indicated with braces, e.g., f100g.
Examples of the .111/, .001/, and .010/ planes are given in Fig. 17.25. As remarked
in Sect. 24.4 about the silicon-oxidation process, the .111/ plane has the highest
concentration of atoms, followed by the f100g planes.

distinguish them from the symbols introduced so far, such triads of integers are

where 0 is the transformed domain. This reasoning does not apply to the translation
operators T . In fact, the operation T r D r C l does not leave the norm of r
unchanged. This shows in passing that T is not unitary. Other consequences of
the above deﬁnitions and of the proof that A is unitary are
A f.Rr0/ D f.r0/ ;
A f.r0/ D f.Rr0/ :
(17.177)
Also, A commutes with the operators that are invariant under the transformation
r  Rr. In fact, if B is such an operator,
A B.r/f.r/ D B.Rr/f.Rr/ D B.r/A f.r/

transformation r  Rr. As a consequence, B commutes also with A .

of M: letting qn ¤ 0 be one such eigenfunction, if qn was not a member of M it

In crystals, the unitary coordinate transformations r0 D Rr that leave the

transformations provide a method to study the degenerate eigenvalues of H .

Periodic Structures
Let B D H , and let H be invariant under a coordinate transformation Rr.
If, in addition, H is translationally invariant and the periodic boundary conditions
apply (Sect. 17.5.3), then the eigenfunctions w of H are Bloch functions, namely,
they fulﬁll the Bloch theorem
wi.r C l; k/ D exp.i k  l/ wi.r; k/ ;
(17.181)
with l a translation vector and i the band index. Let A be the operator associated
with R. Then, from H A  D A H ,
H A wi.r; k/ D Ei.k/ A wi.r; k/ ;
(17.182)
with Ei.k/ the eigenvalue. One infers from (17.182) that if wi.r; k/ and A wi.r; k/
are linearly independent, then the eigenvalue is degenerate. Such a degeneracy
does not depend on the detailed form of the Hamiltonian operator, but only on
its symmetry properties. For this reason, the degeneracy is called essential. If
further degeneracies exist, that depend on the detailed form of H , they are called
accidental.
Let M.k/ be the space made of the linearly independent eigenfunctions of E.k/,
and of any nonvanishing linear combination of them, and deﬁne
vi.r; k0/ D A wi.r; k/ D wi.Rr; k/ ;
(17.183)
where symbol k0 accounts for a possible inﬂuence on k of the coordinate transfor-
mation Rr. Being an eigenfunction of H , vi.r; k0/ is a Bloch function,
vi.r C l; k0/ D exp.i k0  l/ vi.r; k0/ ;
(17.184)
where vi.r C l; k0/ D wi.Rr C Rl; k/. On the other hand, Bloch’s theorem applied
to wi.Rr C Rl; k/ yields
wi.Rr C Rl; k/ D exp.jk  Rl/ wi.Rr; k/ ;
(17.185)
where the equality k  Rl D Rk  l holds due to the deﬁnition of adjoint operator.
Comparison with the expression of the Bloch theorem applied to vi.r C l; k0/
provides k0 D Rk, whence
wi.Rr; k/ D vi.r; Rk/ :
(17.186)
In conclusion, if wi.r; k/ is a Bloch function belonging to M.k/ and Rr a
coordinate transformation that leaves the Hamiltonian operator invariant, then the
eigenfunction obtained by such a transformation also belongs to M.k/ and is labeled
by Rk. The following also holds true,

The theory of this section is applied by way of example to the Hamiltonian operator
of a system of K electrons and N nuclei, interacting through electrostatic forces, that
was introduced in Sect. 16.2. The potential energy is (compare with (16.5))

Similar expressions hold for Ua and Uea (the second relation in (16.1) and (16.2),
respectively). If Uext D 0, the potential energy is invariant upon the reﬂexion
transformation Rr D r, RR D R. Clearly, the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian
operator is also invariant. In the adiabatic approximation (Sect. 16.3), the coordi-
nates of the nuclei are ﬁxed to the equilibrium positions R0, which preserves the
reﬂexion invariance. Finally, the reﬂexion invariance is still preserved in the Hartree
and Hartree-Fock approximations (Sects. 16.4 and 16.5, respectively), which also
provide single-electron Hamiltonian operators that are translationally invariant. Due
to lattice periodicity, the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator are Bloch
functions. Denoting now with r the coordinates associated with a single electron,
the transformation Rr D r corresponds to Rk D k whence, from (17.188),
Ei.k/ D Ei.k/ :
(17.191)
This type of degeneracy is accidental because it depends on the detailed form of the
Hamiltonian operator. If the crystal has also a reﬂection symmetry, then the reﬂexion
invariance of the single-electron Hamiltonian operators occurs irrespective of the
form of the interactions. In this case, the degeneracy is essential.

Kronig-Penney Model
The general method for solving the Schrödinger equation in a periodic lattice, shown
in Sect. 17.6, is applied here to a one-dimensional case, where the potential energy
is described as the series of equal barriers shown in Fig. 17.26. The approach is
called Kronig-Penney model; it is amenable to an analytical solution and, despite its
simplicity, is able to capture the main properties of the dispersion relation E.k/.

The function E D E.k/ can be determined by inverting (17.210); alternatively,
it may be obtained in graphic form as shown in Fig. 17.27, where # has been
ﬁxed to 10: given k, the right-hand side of (17.210) is ﬁxed at some value 1 
cos.k a/  1. The energy E is then found by seeking ˛ a such that the two sides
become equal. The horizontal, dashed lines in the ﬁgure correspond to cos.ka/ D 1
and cos.k a/ D 1; they limit the interval where (17.210) has real solutions. The
horizontal, continuous line corresponds to cos.k a/ D 0:4, while the oscillating
curve represents the left-hand side of (17.210). The latter intercepts the cos.k a/ D
0:4 line at inﬁnite points ˛1 a, ˛2 a; : : :; from each ˛i thus found, one determines the
energy corresponding to the given k from the relation ˛i D p2 m Ei=„. Each branch
of the multi-valued function E.k/ is then found by repeating the procedure for all
values of k within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, thus making cos.k a/ to range from 1 to
1. In the ﬁgure, the two vertical lines mark the values of ˛ a delimiting the lowest
band. The following are also worth noting:
•
Letting  indicate the left-hand side of (17.210), there are no real solutions for
 > 1 or  < 1; the intervals with no real solutions are the forbidden bands. In
fact, the k solutions in the forbidden bands are complex: it is k a D ˙i log. C
p
2  1/ when  > 1, and k a D  ˙ i log.jj C
p
2  1/ when  < 1.
•
At large energies the (17.210) relation tends to cos.˛a/ D cos.ka/, namely, to
the free-particle one: k D ˛ D
p
2 m E=„.
•
Like in the general case, for a ﬁnite structure where the periodic boundary
conditions are applied, the above calculation still holds, with k a discrete variable.

Linear, Monatomic Chain
The calculation of vibrational spectra has been carried out in general form in
Sect. 17.7. Simple examples of application, with reference to a one-dimensional
lattice, are given in this section and in the next one. Like the Kronig-Penney model
used in Sect. 17.9.4 for determining the dispersion relation of electrons, the one-
dimensional models of the lattice vibrations are amenable to analytical solutions; the
latter, as shown below, are able to provide the explicit expression of the dispersion
relation.
26The same type of limit is applicable to the single-barrier case, whose transmission coefﬁcient is
given in (11.22).

Periodic Structures
To begin, consider a one-dimensional monatomic lattice made of Nc cells (linear,
monatomic chain). Let the lattice be aligned with the x axis, and the corresponding
characteristic vector be a D a i, a > 0, with i the unit vector of the x axis. Finally,
let the positions of the Nc C 1 nodes be 0, a, 2 a, : : :, n a, : : :. The translation vector
associated with the nth node is ln D n a i. Finally, it is assumed that the motion
of each atom is constrained to the x axis, and the periodic boundary conditions are
applied.
Due to the periodic boundary conditions the nodes of indices n D 0 and n D Nc
are actually the same node. As a one-dimensional case is considered, with Nb D 1,
the total number of atoms is N D Nc. The number of the lattice’s degrees of freedom
is Nc, and the correspondence with the indices used in the general theory (compare
with (17.124)) is
m ; n D 1; : : : ; Nc ;
˛ ; ˇ D 1 ;
u ; w D 1 :
(17.211)
As only one atom per cell is present, one may assume that the equilibrium position
of each nucleus coincides with that of a node. In the harmonic approximation the
force acting on the rth nucleus is a linear function of the displacements:
Fr D 
Nc
X
kD1
crk hk ;
(17.212)
where all coefﬁcients crk in general differ from 0. In real crystals, however, the
interaction between nuclei becomes rapidly negligible as the distance increases. As
a consequence, the dynamics of a nucleus may be tackled in a simpliﬁed manner by
considering only the interaction with the neighboring nuclei to be effective. This is
equivalent to letting crk D 0 when jr  kj > 1, whence
Fr D cr1

r
hrC1 D Fr.hr1; hr; hrC1/ :
(17.213)
In the coefﬁcients of (17.213), the lower index refers to the node being acted
upon by the force at the left-hand side, the upper index refers to the node whose
displacement contributes to such a force. When the nuclei of indices r  1, r,
r C 1 are in the equilibrium positions it is Fr.0; 0; 0/ D 0 for all r. On the other
hand, it is also Fr.ı; ı; ı/ D 0, with ı ¤ 0 an arbitrary displacement. In fact,
when all displacements are equal, the interatomic distance remains the same as in
the equilibrium condition. From Fr.ı; ı; ı/ D 0 it follows that the coefﬁcients are
connected by the relation
cr1

r > 0. As shown in Sect. 17.7 for the general
case, due to the translation invariance the elastic coefﬁcients do not depend on the
cell index, but on the difference between cell indices (compare with (17.125)); in
conclusion, letting

and letting  be the common mass of the nuclei, the dynamics of the rth nucleus is
described by the equation

(17.218)
The general theory shows that the displacement has the form
hr D h0 exp .i q r a  i ! t/ ;
(17.219)
(compare with (17.152)), where h0 is a complex constant, q r a D q  lr D q i  r a i,
and ! D !.q/. Replacing (17.219) in (17.218) and dividing by hr yield

(17.222)
Replacing this form of q within (17.219) and (17.221) shows that using  C Nc
instead of  leaves hr and ! unchanged. As a consequence, it is sufﬁcient to consider
only Nc consecutive values of , say,  D 0; 1; : : : ; Nc  1, which in turn limit the
possible values of q to an interval of length 2 =a. This was expected, because the
values of the indices in (17.211) are such that the number of eigenvalues of the
problem is Nc. Thus, the dispersion relation has only one branch, given by (17.221).

the interval near the origin, where the phase and group velocities are equal to each
other and independent of q, corresponds to the largest values of the vibrations’
wavelength. As some of these wavelengths fall in the audible range, the branch
is called acoustic branch.

Due to the periodic boundary conditions the nodes of indices n D 0 and n D Nc
are actually the same node. As a one-dimensional case is considered, with Nb D 2,
the total number of atoms is N D 2 Nc. The number of degrees of freedom of the

distance increases. Following the same reasoning as in Sect. 17.9.5, the dynamics
of a nucleus is tackled in a simpliﬁed manner by considering only the interaction
with the neighboring nuclei to be effective. This is equivalent to letting crk D 0
when jr  kj > 1. For a nucleus of type 1 the neighboring nuclei are of type 2. It
is assumed that the node numbering is such, that the neighbors of interest belong to
the cells of indices r  1 and r. It follows

In the coefﬁcients of (17.226), the left-lower index refers to the node being acted
upon by the force at the left-hand side, the left-upper index refers to the node whose
displacement contributes to such a force, the right-lower and right-upper indices
refer to the nucleus type. When the nuclei involved are in the equilibrium positions
it is Fr;1.0; 0; 0/ D 0. On the other hand, it is also Fr;1.ı; ı; ı/ D 0, with ı ¤ 0

distance remains the same as in the equilibrium condition. From Fr;1.ı; ı; ı/ D 0 it

Analogies
It is interesting to note the analogy between the expression of the energy of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuo, described as a superposition of modes (Eqs. (5.38,
5.40)), and that of a system of vibrating nuclei (Eqs. (3.48) and (17.118)). In essence,
the two expressions derive from the fact that in both cases the energy is a positive-
deﬁnite, symmetric quadratic form. In the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld the
form is exact because of the linearity of the Maxwell equations; for the vibrating
nuclei the form is approximate because of the neglect of the anharmonic terms
(Sect. 3.13.1).
Other analogies exist between the dispersion relation E.k/ of the electrons
subjected to a periodic potential energy, worked out in Sect. 17.6, and the dispersion
relation !.q/, worked out in Sect. (17.7). Both relations are even and periodic in the
reciprocal, scaled lattice; both have a branch structure, the difference being that the
number of branches of !.q/ is ﬁnite because the number of degrees of freedom of
the vibrating lattice is ﬁnite, whereas that of E.k/ is inﬁnite.

Chapter 18
Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors
at Equilibrium
18.1
Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to provide the equilibrium expressions of the electron
and hole concentrations in a semiconductor. For comparison, the cases of insulators
and conductors are discussed qualitatively, and the concepts of conduction band,
valence band, and generation of an electron-hole pair are introduced. The important
issue of the temperature dependence of the concentrations is also discussed. Then,
the general expressions of the concentrations in an intrinsic semiconductor are
worked out, followed by an estimate of the Fermi level’s position. Next, the equi-
librium expressions are worked out again, this time in the case where substitutional
impurities of the donor or acceptor type are present within the semiconductor. The
mechanism by which donor-type dopants provide electrons to the conduction band
and acceptor-type dopants provide holes to the valence band is explained. An impor-
tant outcome of the analysis is that the introduction of suitable dopants makes the
concentration of majority carriers practically independent of temperature, at least in
a range of temperatures of practical interest for the functioning of integrated circuits.
The simpliﬁcations due to the complete-ionization and nondegeneracy conditions
are illustrated, along with the compensation effect. Finally, the theory is extended
to the case of a nonuniform doping distribution, where the concentrations must
be calculated self-consistently with the electric potential by solving the Poisson
equation. The last section illustrates the band-gap narrowing phenomenon. In the
complements, after a brief description of the relative importance of germanium,
silicon, and gallium arsenide in the semiconductor industry, a qualitative analysis of
the impurity levels is carried out by an extension of the Kronig-Penney model, and
the calculation of the position of the impurity levels with respect to the band edges
is carried out.

18.2
Equilibrium Concentration of Electrons and Holes
The expressions worked out in this chapter are obtained by combining the informa-
tion about the band structure of the crystal under investigation, given in Chap. 17,
with that of the equilibrium distribution of fermions (Chap. 15). A qualitative
description is given ﬁrst, starting from the simpliﬁed case where the structures of
the conduction and valence band are symmetric (Fig. 17.14).
Considering again a case where the Fermi level EF coincides with the gap’s
midpoint and MV m3=2

, let the only difference with respect to the
material of Fig. 17.14 be that the energy gap is larger (Fig. 18.1). Despite the fact
that the situations illustrated in the two ﬁgures may appear similar to each other,
it must be realized that a 2  1031 ampliﬁcation factor, with respect to the scale of
g.E/ alone, is necessary to make the products g.E/ P.E/, g.E/ Œ1  P.E/ visible in
Fig. 18.1, in contrast to the 103 factor used in Fig. 17.14. In practice, for the material
of Fig. 18.1 the states in the conduction band are empty and those of the valence
band are full.1

1The curves of Figs. 17.14, 18.1 are drawn in arbitrary units. To better appreciate the difference in
a practical situation, one may use the equilibrium concentration of electrons in silicon at T D 300
K, which is about 1016 m3. Thus, if Fig. 17.14 is thought of as representing silicon, the ratio of the
ampliﬁcation factors used in Figs. 17.14 and 18.1 produces, in the latter, a concentration of about
one electron in 1000 km3.

product g.E/ P.E/ is drawn in the same scale as g.E/ alone (compare with Figs. 17.14 and 18.1).
The gap’s extension is arbitrary and does not refer to any speciﬁc material
Remembering that a band whose states are empty and, similarly, a band whose
states are fully occupied, do not provide any conduction, it turns out that the
electrical conductivity of a material like that of Fig. 18.1 is expected to vanish: the
material is an insulator.
A different case is found when the Fermi level is inside a band, like in the crystal
illustrated in Fig. 18.2. The name conduction band is given in this case to the band
where the Fermi level belongs; the band beneath is called valence band also in this
case. Due to the position of the Fermi level, the parabolic-band approximation is
grossly mistaken, and is used for a qualitative discussion only. In the ﬁgure, the
g.E/ P.E/ product is drawn without using any ampliﬁcation factor, thus showing
that the electron concentration in the conduction band is much larger than for a
semiconductor; the latter band, in turn, is the only one that contributes to conduction,
because the concentration of holes in the valence band is negligible. Due to the
much larger concentration of charges one expects that the conductivity of the crystal
under investigation be large; in fact, this is found to be the case, and the crystal is a
conductor.
In summary, the combination of a few factors: position of the Fermi level with
respect to the bands, gap’s width, and structure of the density of state, dictates the
presence of partially ﬁlled bands and the concentration of charges in them. Other
situations may occur besides those depicted in Figs. 17.14, 18.1, and 18.2, e.g., the
Fermi level may be positioned within the gap, but closer to one of the band edges
than to the other. They are illustrated in Sects. 18.4.1 and 18.4.2.
Another important issue is the dependence of the electron and hole populations
on temperature. Considering the case of a semiconductor ﬁrst, the discussion is
carried out with reference to Figs. 17.14 and 15.3; the latter illustrates the tempera-

418
18

ture dependence of the Fermi-Dirac statistics, using the simplifying hypothesis that
the position of the Fermi level does not change with temperature.2 Following the
reasoning carried out in Sect. 17.6.5, the temperature dependence of the effective
masses is neglected as well. When temperature increases, the occupation probability
of the conduction-band states increases, thus making the concentration of electrons
in the conduction band to increase; at the same time, the occupation probability
of the valence-band states decreases, thus making the concentration of holes in the
valence band to increase as well. This outcome is easily understood if one thinks
that the increase in temperature is achieved by transferring energy from an external
reservoir to the semiconductor; part of this energy is absorbed by the nuclei and
produces a change in the equilibrium distribution of phonons (Sect. 16.6), while the
other part is absorbed by the electrons and produces a redistribution of the latter
within the available energy states. The absorption of energy by electrons that, prior
to the temperature increase, belonged to valence-band states makes some of them
to transit to the conduction band. As each electron that makes a transition leaves a
hole in the valence band, this is an example of generation of an electron-hole pair
(compare with Sect. 17.6.6).
As shown in Sect. 19.5.5, the conductivity of a semiconductor is proportional
to n n C p p, where n is the concentration of conduction-band electrons, p the
concentration of valence-band holes, and n, p the electron and hole mobilities,
respectively. Mobilities account for the scattering events undergone by electrons
and holes during their motion within the material, and are found to decrease
when temperature increases. It follows that the decrease in mobility competes with
the increase of the concentrations in determining the temperature dependence of
conductivity in a semiconductor. In practice, the increase in the concentrations is
much stronger due to the exponential form of the Fermi-Dirac statistics, so that the
conductivity of a semiconductor strongly increases with temperature.3
The qualitative analysis of conductivity is the same for a conductor where, as
holes are absent, the conductivity is proportional to n n. However, the outcome is
different; in fact, while n, like that of a semiconductor, decreases when temperature
increases, the electron concentration n is unaffected by temperature. In fact, from
Fig. 18.2 one ﬁnds that the deformation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics due to a
temperature variation produces a rearrangement of the electron distribution within
the conduction band itself, and no hole-pair generations; as a consequence, the
energies of some electrons of the conduction band change, while the electron
number (hence the concentration n) does not. As mobility depends weakly on
temperature, the conductivity of a conductor turns out to slightly decrease as
temperature increases.
2The temperature dependence of the Fermi level is inﬂuenced by the shape of the density of states
( [70] and Prob. 15.2). Such a dependence is neglected in the qualitative discussion carried out here.
3This is a negative aspect because the electrical properties of the material are strongly inﬂuenced
by the ambient temperature. The drawback is absent in doped semiconductors, at least in the range
of temperatures that are typical of the operating conditions of semiconductor devices (Sect. 18.4.1).

Equilibrium Concentration of Electrons and Holes

The calculation of the equilibrium electron concentration in the conduction band
of a semiconductor is based on (17.76), where the density of states in energy g
is replaced with the combined density of states in energy and volume  given
by (17.73). The concentration of electrons and the Fermi level are indicated here
with ni, EFi instead of n, EF to remark the fact that the semiconductor is free
from impurities (for this reason, the semiconductor is called intrinsic). From the
discussion of Sect. 17.6.5, the parabolic-band approximation is acceptable, so that
the combined density of states is given by (17.73).4 Remembering that the lower
edge of the conduction band is indicated with EC, and letting ECU be the upper edge

The concentration of holes in the valence band is determined in a similar manner,
namely, starting from an integral of the form (17.76), where P.E/ is replaced with
1  P.E/ and the density of states in energy g is replaced with the combined density
of states in energy and volume . The concentration of holes is indicated here with
pi and, as for the electrons, the parabolic-band approximation is adopted, so that the
combined density of states is obtained from (17.74). Finally, 1  P.E/ is expressed
through (17.77). Remembering that the upper edge of the valence band is indicated

the concentration of electrons and holes. The results of gap’s calculations or
measurements, that show that EG decreases when temperature increases, are usually

where EG0 is the gap’s width extrapolated at T D 0 and ˛ > 0, ˇ > 0 are material’s
parameters. Table 18.1 reports the parameters related to the gap’s width for Si, Ge,
and GaAs, along with the values of the average effective masses normalized to the
rest mass of the free electron [128, Chap. 2-3]. The plot of EG.T/ is shown in
Fig. 18.3 for the three semiconductors of Table 18.1.
Note that expressions (18.4,18.8) can be used only if the position of the
Fermi level is known; in fact, the latter (which is unknown as yet) enters the
deﬁnitions (18.2,18.6) of parameters e, h. To proceed one remembers that in
the T ! 0 limit the Fermi-Dirac statistics becomes discontinuous, speciﬁcally
it is P D 1 for E < EFi and P D 0 for E > EFi (Sect. 15.8.1); on the other
hand, the experimental evidence shows that in the T ! 0 limit the conductivity
of a semiconductor vanishes: this corresponds to a situation where all states of the
conduction band are empty while those of the valence bands are ﬁlled. In conclusion,
when T ! 0 the Fermi level is still positioned in the gap and it is ni D pi D 0. If,
starting from this situation, the temperature is brought again to some ﬁnite value
T > 0, such that some of the valence-band electrons transit to the conduction band,

the total number of holes thus formed equals that of the transited electrons. Due to
the spatial uniformity of the material, the concentrations are equal to each other as

the second of which has been obtained by deleting the common factors from (18.4)
and (18.8). Relations (18.9) and (18.11) are a set of two equations in the unknowns
e, h, whose solution allows one to determine the position of the Fermi level
through (18.2) or (18.6).
The second relation in (18.11) can also be exploited for carrying out an estimate
of e, h, basing on the values of the masses given in Table 18.1. To this purpose
one observes6 that the ratio MC m3=2

and GaAs, respectively, so that a crude estimate is obtained by letting ˚1=2.e/ '

it follows e ' h. Replacing from (18.2,18.6) yields EFi ' .EC C EV/=2, and
e ' h ' EG=2 > 0.
The usefulness of this estimate actually lies in that it simpliﬁes the Fermi

Its values at room temperature are listed in Table 18.2 along with those of
the effective densities of states, for Si, Ge, and GaAs. As for the temperature
dependence of ni one notes that, besides appearing in the exponent’s denominator in
the ﬁrst relation of (18.14), the lattice temperature also inﬂuences the numerator
EG and the NC NV factor. Among these dependencies, that of the exponent’s
denominator is by far the strongest; it follows that a ﬁrst-hand description of ni.T/
can be given by considering only the latter. This yields to the Arrhenius plots shown
in Fig. 18.4, where the relations ni.T/ reduce to straight lines. It is important to
note that despite the similarity of the effective densities of states for the three
semiconductors considered here (Table 18.2), the intrinsic concentrations differ by
orders of magnitude. This is due to the exponential dependence of ni on EG, which
ampliﬁes the differences in EG (visible in Table 18.1) of the three semiconductors.
The estimate of the position of the Fermi level in an intrinsic semiconductor
carried out above has led to the conclusion that the Fermi integrals used for
calculating the intrinsic concentrations can be replaced with exponentials.7Such a

introduced into the semiconductor lattice (Sects. 18.4.1, 18.4.2).

The second term at the right-hand side of (18.16) is the correction with respect to

temperature increases, if MC m3=2

the distance EC  EFi becomes larger,
that is, the Fermi level moves towards the valence band; the opposite happens if

the logarithm in (18.16) is close to unity and the coefﬁcient kB T is always small

with the gap’s midpoint.
18.4
Uniform Distribution of Impurities
As described in Chap. 23, the fabrication of integrated circuits (IC) requires the
introduction into the semiconductor material of atoms (called impurities or dopants)
belonging to speciﬁcally selected chemical species. Dopants are divided into two
classes, termed n-type and p-type. With reference to silicon (Si), the typical n-type
dopants are phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), while the typical p-
type dopants are boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and Indium (In). For a
qualitative introduction to the effects of dopants it is instructive to start with the
case of an intrinsic semiconductor; the analysis is based on the simpliﬁed picture in
which the original arrangement of the atoms in space, like that shown in Fig. 17.11,
is deformed in such a way as to become two dimensional. This representation,
shown in Fig. 18.5 with reference to silicon, is convenient for the description carried
out below. Each silicon atom has four electrons in the external shell, so that it can
form four covalent bonds8 with other identical atoms; each pair of lines connecting
two atoms in Fig. 18.5 stands for a pair of shared electrons. In the T ! 0 limit,
the electrons are permanently bound to the atoms because the energy necessary to
8In a covalent bond atoms share their outermost electrons.

ionize is not available; this situation is drawn in the upper-left part of the ﬁgure. If,
instead, the temperature is brought to some ﬁnite value T > 0 by transferring energy
from an external reservoir to the semiconductor, part of this energy is absorbed by
some of the electrons; the latter break the bond and become free to move within the
material.9 This situation is depicted in the lower-right part of Fig. 18.5, where the
free electrons are represented with black dots.
When an electron becomes free and departs from an atom, the unbalanced
positive charge left behind in the nucleus deforms the shape of the potential energy
in the vicinity of the nucleus itself. The deformation is such that the potential-energy
barrier that separates the nucleus from the neighboring ones becomes lower and
thinner; this, in turn, enhances the probability of tunneling across the barrier by an
electron belonging to a shared pair. Such a tunneling event restores the original pair,
but leaves an unbalanced positive charge behind; instead of considering it as the
motion of an electron from a complete to an incomplete pair, the tunneling event
is more conveniently described as the opposite motion of an empty state, that is, a
hole. This is indicated in Fig. 18.5 by the combinations of arrows and white dots.
The above description, based on a spatial picture of the material, is able to
provide a qualitative explanation of the existence of electrons and holes in a
semiconductor,10 and completes the description given in Sect. 18.3, that focuses on
9Remembering that an equilibrium situation is considered here, the contributions to the electric
current of these electrons cancel each other.
10A similar description could as well apply to a conductor. However, in such a case the barrier
deformation is small and tunneling does not occur.

an energy picture. It also constitutes the basis for analyzing the case of a doped
semiconductor, as shown in the following sections.
18.4.1
Donor-Type Impurities
As explained in Chap. 23, when a dopant atom is introduced into the semiconductor
lattice, in order to properly act as a dopant it must replace an atom of the
semiconductor, namely, it must occupy a lattice position (substitutional impurity).
The concentration of the dopant atoms that are introduced into a semiconductor
is smaller by orders of magnitude than the concentration of the semiconductor
atoms themselves. As a consequence, the average distance between dopant atoms
within the lattice is much larger than that between the semiconductor atoms. Due to
this, when the band structure is calculated, the modiﬁcation in the potential energy
introduced by the dopant atoms can be considered as a perturbation with respect to
the periodic potential energy of the lattice; the resulting band structure is therefore
the superposition of that of the intrinsic semiconductor and of a set of additional
states, whose characteristics will be described later. For the moment being, the
spatial description is considered, still using the two-dimensional picture, where it
is assumed that phosphorus is used as dopant material (Fig. 18.6).
As the dopant concentration is small with respect to the semiconductor’s, each
phosphorus atom is surrounded by silicon atoms. Phosphorus has ﬁve electrons
in the external shell: thus, it forms four covalent bonds with silicon, while the

remaining electron does not participate in any bond. In the T ! 0 limit, the
electrons are permanently bound to the atoms as in the intrinsic case; this situation is
drawn in the upper-left part of the ﬁgure, where the electron that does not form any
bond is represented, in a particle-like picture, as orbiting around the phosphorus
atom. The orbit’s radius is relatively large because the binding force is weak.11
The white dot inside the phosphorus atom indicates the positive nuclear charge that
balances the orbiting electron. If, instead, the temperature is brought to some ﬁnite
value T > 0 by transferring energy from an external reservoir to the semiconductor,
a fraction of the orbiting electrons breaks the bond and become free to move within
the material. At the same time, electrons belonging to shared pairs may also break
their bonds, like in intrinsic silicon. This situation is depicted in the lower-right part
of Fig. 18.6, where the free electrons are represented with black dots.
The deformation in the shape of the potential energy in the vicinity of a
phosphorus nucleus is different from that near a silicon nucleus. In the latter case,
the phenomenon is the same as in the intrinsic material: a series of tunneling events
takes place, leading to the motion of holes from one site to a neighboring one. This
is still represented by the combinations of arrows and white dots in Fig. 18.6. In the
case of phosphorus, instead, the barrier deformation is small and tunneling does not
occur: thus, the phosphorus atoms provide free electrons to the lattice, but no holes.
It is intuitive that the insertion of a prescribed amount of n-type dopants into the
semiconductor lattice provides a method for controlling the number of free electrons
and, through them, the material’s conductivity. Moreover, if the ionization of the
dopant atoms is not inﬂuenced by temperature, at least in a range of temperatures
of practical interest, and the number of electrons made available by the dopant
is dominant with respect to that provided by the intrinsic semiconductor, the
drawback mentioned in Sect. 18.2 is eliminated: conductivity becomes temperature
independent and its value is controlled by the fabrication process. This analysis is
better speciﬁed below, starting from the consideration of the density of states in an
n-type semiconductor, shown in Fig. 18.7.
Concentration of Ionized Impurities (Donor Type)
Atoms like that of phosphorus contribute electrons to the lattice; for this reason they
are also called donors. The concentration of donors is indicated with ND and, in
this section, is assumed to be uniform in space. When donor atoms are present, the
equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes are different from those of the
intrinsic case; they are indicated with n and p, respectively, and are termed extrinsic
concentrations. Their derivation is identical to that of the intrinsic case and yields
n D NC ˚1=2.e/ ;
p D NV ˚1=2.h/ ;
(18.17)
11In a more precise, quantum-mechanical description the electron is described as a stationary wave
function extending over several lattice cells.

The above expression of e, h is similar to (18.2,18.6), the only difference being

In addition to the electrons of the conduction band and holes of the valence band,
a third population of particles must be accounted for, namely, that associated with
the dopants. Let NC

donors.12 The difference nD D ND  NC

because the energy necessary for it is too high.

high values of the donor concentration, D has the form shown in Fig. 18.7. Such
a density of states can be approximated by a Dirac delta centered at an energy ED,
called donor level, positioned within the gap at a small distance from the edge EC
of the conduction band:

(18.20)
The coefﬁcient in (18.20) is such that (18.19) yields nD D ND when PD D 1. The
distance of the donor level from the minimum of the conduction band is calculated
in Sect. 18.7.3; for the typical n-type dopants used with silicon it is EC  ED '
0:033 eV. Another important feature of the donor levels (still in the case of low
or moderately high values of the impurity concentration) is that they are localized
in space, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 18.8. For this reason, the Fermi-Dirac
statistics describing the equilibrium distribution of the electrons within the donor
states is slightly different from that used for the band electrons and reads

with dD the donors’ degeneracy coefﬁcient ([33, Sect. 3.4] and Prob. 18.1). In sil-

Like in the intrinsic case discussed in Sect. 18.3, expressions (18.17,18.22) can
be used only if the position of the Fermi level is known. To proceed one considers
again the T ! 0 limit, where the Fermi-Dirac statistics becomes discontinuous and
the experimental evidence shows that the conductivity of a doped semiconductor

vanishes: this corresponds to a situation where all states of the conduction band
are empty, those of the valence bands are ﬁlled, and the donor states are ﬁlled as
well (in other terms, no dopant atoms are ionized). In conclusion, when T ! 0
the Fermi level of an n-doped semiconductor is positioned between ED and EC, so
that n D p D NC
D D 0. If, starting from this situation, the temperature is brought
again to some ﬁnite value T > 0, such that some of the valence-band electrons and
some of the electrons belonging to the dopant atoms transit to the conduction band,
the total number of holes and ionized donors thus formed is equal to that of the
transited electrons. Due to the spatial uniformity of the material, the same relation
holds among the concentrations, so that

whose limit for ND ! 0 yields (18.11) as should be. Now, inserting (18.17,18.22)

respect to the band edges EC and EV at a given temperature T > 0 and donor
concentration ND. It is easily found that for a ﬁxed temperature, the argument
e D .EF  EC/=.kB T/ increases when ND increases. In fact, using the short-hand

where the right-hand side is positive because dh=de D 1 and ˚1=2 is a monoton-

0 it is EF D EFi and e < 0; as ND increases, the Fermi level moves towards
EC, thus making e less and less negative. At extremely high concentrations of the
donor atoms, the Fermi level may reach EC and even enter the conduction band, thus
making e positive. As n, p, and NC
D are nonnegative, it is intuitive that an increasing
concentration of donor atoms makes n larger than p; for this reason, in an n-doped
semiconductor electrons are called majority carriers while holes are called minority
carriers.13
The behavior of the Fermi level with respect to variations in temperature, at a
ﬁxed dopant concentration, cannot be discussed as easily as that with respect to
the dopant variations, because (18.24) is not expressible in the form T D T.EF/

or its inverse. The analytical approach is made easier when some approximations
are introduced into (18.24), as shown below. From a qualitative standpoint, one
may observe that at very high temperatures the concentration of electron-hole
pairs generated by the semiconductor prevails over the concentration of electrons
provided by the dopant atoms, so that position of the Fermi level must be close to
the intrinsic one; in contrast, when T ! 0 the Fermi level is positioned between
ED and EC as remarked above. In conclusion, for an n-doped semiconductor one
expects that dEF=dT < 0.
In view of further elaborations it is convenient to associate with the Fermi level
an electric potential 'F, called Fermi potential, deﬁned by
q 'F D EFi  EF ;
(18.26)
with q > 0 the elementary charge. In an n-type semiconductor it is EF > EFi; thus,
the Fermi potential is negative.
Complete Ionization and Nondegenerate Condition (Donor Type)
When the Fermi level’s position and temperature are such that
e  D < 1 ;
EF < ED  kB T ;
(18.27)
the exponential term at the right-hand side of (18.22) is negligible with respect to
unity, so that NC
D ' ND. This condition is indicated with complete ionization. Note
that, since D < 0, the complete-ionization condition in an n-doped semiconductor
also implies e < 1; as a consequence, the approximation ˚1=2.e/ ' exp.e/
for the Fermi integral holds (Sect. C.13). Moreover, it is h < e < 1 because
the Fermi level belongs to the upper half of the gap; thus, the same approximation
applies to ˚1=2.h/ as well. When both equilibrium concentrations n and p are
expressible through the approximation ˚1=2./ ' exp./, the semiconductor is
called nondegenerate and the balance relation (18.24) reduces to

The range of validity of (18.30) is quite vast; in silicon at room temperature the
approximation (18.28) holds up to ND ' 1017 cm3; also, even for the lowest
doping concentrations (about 1013 cm3) it is ND  ni, so that (18.30) can
further be approximated as n ' ND, p ' n2
i =ND. Thus, the concentration of
majority carriers turns out to be independent of temperature, while that of minority
carriers still depends on temperature through ni. Assuming by way of example
ND D 1015 cm3 and taking a temperature such that ni D 1010 cm3 (compare with
Table 18.2), one ﬁnds n ' 1015 cm3, p ' 105 cm3. This result is very important
because it demonstrates that the concentration of minority carriers is negligible; as
anticipated above, the inclusion of a suitable concentration of dopants makes the
material’s conductivity independent of temperature. The Arrhenius plot of n.T/ for
an n-type semiconductor is shown in Fig. 18.9 in arbitrary units. The left part of
the curve, called intrinsic range, corresponds to the situation where the intrinsic
concentration prevails due to the high temperature; the plateau, called saturation
range, corresponds to the situation where n ' ND; ﬁnally, the right part of the curve,
called freeze-out range, corresponds to the case where n ' NC
D < ND, with NC
D
decreasing as temperature decreases. From the practical standpoint, the important
outcome is that the saturation region covers the range of temperatures within which
the integrated circuits operate.14
14For instance, for silicon with ND D 1015 cm3 the saturation region ranges from Tmin ' 125 K
to Tmax ' 370 K [128, Sect. 2–4].

Acceptor-Type Impurities
The analysis carried out in Sect. 18.4.1 is repeated here in a shorter form with refer-
ence to a substitutional impurity of the acceptor type like, e.g., boron (Fig. 18.10).
As the dopant concentration is small with respect to the semiconductor’s, each
boron atom is surrounded by silicon atoms. Boron has three electrons in the
external shell: while these electrons form covalent bonds with silicon, the remaining
unsaturated bond deforms the shape of the potential energy in the vicinity of the
boron atom. This attracts an electron from a shared pair of a neighboring silicon. In
other terms, to form four covalent bonds with silicon, boron generates an electron-
hole pair as shown in the ﬁgure. In the T ! 0 limit, the holes are permanently
bound to the atoms as in the intrinsic case; this situation is drawn in the upper-left
part of the ﬁgure, where the hole is represented, in a particle-like picture, as orbiting
around the boron atom. The orbit’s radius is relatively large because the binding
force is weak. The black dot inside the boron atom indicates the negative charge
that balances the orbiting hole. If, instead, the temperature is brought to some ﬁnite
value T > 0 by transferring energy from an external reservoir to the semiconductor,
a fraction of the orbiting holes break the bond and become free to move within the
material. At the same time, electrons belonging to shared pairs may also break their
bonds, like in intrinsic silicon. This situation is depicted in the lower-right part of
Fig. 18.10, where the free holes are represented with white dots. The negative charge
within the boron atom remains trapped within the atom itself: thus, the boron atoms
provide free holes to the lattice, but no electrons.

The analysis is better speciﬁed below, starting from the consideration of the
density of states in a p-type semiconductor, shown in Fig. 18.11.
Concentration of Ionized Impurities (Acceptor Type)
Atoms like that of boron trap electrons from the lattice; for this reason they are also
called acceptors. The concentration of acceptors is indicated with NA and, in this
section, is assumed to be uniform in space. When acceptor atoms are present, the
equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes are different from those of the
intrinsic semiconductor; their derivation is identical to that of the intrinsic or n-type
case and yields again (18.17), with NC, NV given by (18.4,18.8), respectively, and
e, h given by (18.18).
In addition to the electron of the conduction band and holes of the valence band,
a third population of particles must be accounted for, namely, that associated with
the dopants. Let N
A  NA be the spatially constant concentration of the acceptors
that have released the orbiting hole to the lattice.15 Equivalently, N
A may be thought
of as the concentration of electrons that have been captured by the acceptor atoms;
15A boron atom that has not released the orbiting hole is electrically neutral; when the orbiting hole
breaks the bond and becomes free to move within the lattice, the atom becomes negatively ionized,
because the release of a hole is actually the capture of a valence-band electron by the boron atom.
The symbol N
A reminds one of that. The release of a second hole does not occur.

values of the acceptor concentration, A has the form shown in Fig. 18.11. Such a
density of states can be approximated by a Dirac delta centered at an energy EA,
called acceptor level, positioned within the gap at a small distance from the edge EV
of the conduction band:
A.E/ ' NA ı.E  EA/ :
(18.35)
The coefﬁcient in (18.35) is such that (18.34) yields N

distance of the acceptor level from the maximum of the valence band is calculated
in Sect. 18.7.3; for the typical p-type dopants used with silicon it is EA  EV ' 0:05
eV for the heavy holes and EA  EV ' 0:016 eV for the light holes. Another
important feature of the acceptor levels (still in the case of low or moderately
high values of the impurity concentration) is that they are localized in space, as
schematically illustrated in Fig. 18.12. For this reason, the Fermi-Dirac statistics
describing the equilibrium distribution of the electrons within the acceptor states is
slightly different from that used for the band electrons and reads

with dA the acceptors’ degeneracy coefﬁcient. In silicon, germanium, and gallium

The position of the Fermi level is calculated by the same token as for the n-type

n C N

(18.38)
whose limit for NA ! 0 yields (18.11) as should be. Now, inserting (18.17,18.37)

(18.39)
The latter, along with the relation e C h D EG=.kB T/, forms a system in
the two unknowns e, h, whose solution determines the position of EF with
respect to the band edges EC and EV at a given temperature T > 0 and acceptor
concentration NA. It is easily found that for a ﬁxed temperature, the argument
h D .EV EF/=.kB T/ increases when NA increases. The demonstration is identical
to that leading to (18.25). In the intrinsic case NA D 0 it is EF D EFi and h < 0;
as NA increases, the Fermi level moves towards EV, thus making h less and less
negative. At extremely high concentrations of the acceptor atoms, the Fermi level
may reach EV and even enter the valence band, thus making h positive. As n, p,
and N
A are nonnegative, it is intuitive that an increasing concentration of acceptor
atoms makes p larger than n; for this reason, in a p-doped semiconductor holes are
called majority carriers while electrons are called minority carriers.

To discuss from a qualitative standpoint the dependence of the Fermi level
with respect to variations in temperature one may observe that, like in an n-
doped material, at very high temperatures the concentration of electron-hole pairs
generated by the semiconductor prevails over the concentration of holes provided
by the dopant atoms, so that position of the Fermi level must be close to the intrinsic
one; in contrast, when T ! 0 the Fermi level is positioned between EV and EA. In
conclusion, for a p-doped semiconductor one expects that dEF=dT > 0. Also, in a
p-type semiconductor it is EF < EFi; thus, the Fermi potential (18.26) is positive.
Complete Ionization and Nondegenerate Condition (Acceptor Type)
When the Fermi level’s position and temperature are such that
h  A < 1 ;
EA < EF  kB T ;
(18.40)
the exponential term at the right-hand side of (18.37) is negligible with respect to
unity, so that N
A ' NA. This condition is indicated with complete ionization. Note
that, since A < 0, the complete-ionization condition in a p-doped semiconductor
also implies h < 1; as a consequence, the approximation ˚1=2.h/ ' exp.h/
for the Fermi integral holds (Sect. C.13). Moreover, it is e < h < 1 because
the Fermi level belongs to the lower half of the gap; thus, the same approximation
applies to ˚1=2.e/ as well. In conclusion, the semiconductor is nondegenerate and
the balance relation (18.39) reduces to

From the exponential expressions of n and p it follows, like in the n-type case,
that the product of the equilibrium concentrations fulﬁlls (18.29). The algebraic

Compensation Effect
The architecture of semiconductor devices is such that donor and acceptor dopants
are present in the same region (Fig. 18.13). Letting ND, NA be the corresponding
concentrations, still assumed uniform in space, the equilibrium concentrations of
electrons and holes are expressed by (18.17) as in the other cases discussed above,
with NC, NV and e, h given by (18.4,18.8) and (18.18), respectively. In turn, the
concentrations of ionized donors and acceptors are given by (18.22) and (18.37),
respectively. The balance equation reads

Nonuniform Distribution of Dopants
This section deals with the more realistic case where the donor concentration ND,
the acceptor concentration NA, or both, depend on position. A qualitative reasoning
shows that the balance equations (18.23), (18.38), or (18.46) do not hold anymore.
To show this, consider the simple case where only the n-type dopant is present,
ND D ND.r/, NA D 0, and select two nearby positions, say, r1 and r2, in the
limiting case T ! 0; then, let the temperature increase such that a fraction of the
donor atoms ionizes. If ND.r1/ ¤ ND.r2/, the numbers of electrons transiting to the
conduction band at r1 and r2 is different, so that the concentration in one position,
say, r1 is larger than that in the other; thus, some electrons diffuse16 from the former
position to the latter. On the other hand, as the position of the positive charges
within the ionized donors is ﬁxed, the spatial rearrangement of the conduction-band
electrons unbalances the negative charges with respect to the positive ones, so that
the local charge density differs from zero. The same reasoning applies when both
donor and acceptor dopants are present, so that in a general nonuniform case it is
%.r/ D q

(18.53)
A nonvanishing charge density produces in turn an electric ﬁeld E D E.r/ whose
action balances the diffusion. In conclusion, the equilibrium condition is kept by
an exact balance of the two transport mechanisms. Considering that the equilibrium
condition is time-independent, the Maxwell equations in the semiconductor reduce
to "sc div E D %, with E D  grad ' (Sect. 4.4), ' and "sc being the electric potential
and semiconductor permittivity, respectively.17 In other terms, the electric ﬁeld due
to the nonuniformity of % is found by solving the Poisson equation.
The effect onto the total energy of the electrons due to the presence of an electric
ﬁeld also inﬂuences the statistical distribution of the electrons in the energy states.
It will be demonstrated in Sect. 19.2.2 that the statistical distribution to be used here
is a modiﬁed form of the Fermi-Dirac statistics where E is replaced with E q '.r/:
P.E; r/ D

(18.55)
16Diffusive transport is introduced in Sect. 19.3.3.
17Note that the material’s permittivity must be used here instead of vacuum’s. This is coherent
with the use of charge density and, in a nonequilibrium situation, of current density, which entail
averages over volumes of space.

Note that the calculations leading to the concentrations are carried out in the same
manner as in Sects. 18.4.1,18.4.2, because they involve integrals over energy only.

The summands at the right-hand side of (18.53) depend on position through the
electric potential ' and also through the explicit dependence of ND and NA; as a
consequence, inserting the expression of the charge density into the right-hand side
of the Poisson equation yields
 "sc r2' D %.'; r/ ;
(18.59)
namely, a second-order, partial differential equation in the unknown ', with
position-dependent coefﬁcients. The equation must be supplemented with suitable
boundary conditions.18 Equation (18.59) is the generalization of the balance
equation (18.46) to the nonuniform case: in the case of (18.46), the problem is
algebraic and yields EF, whereas in the case of (18.59) it is differential and yields
EF C q '. After solving (18.59) one reconstructs n, p, NC
D , and N
A at each point
through (18.56), (18.57), and (18.58). In the nondegenerate case, (18.56) becomes

Band-Gap Narrowing
When the dopant concentration is large, the density of states associated with the
dopant atoms can no longer be described as in Figs. 18.7, 18.11. Rather, considering
by way of example an n-type dopant, the form of the density of states is similar
to that shown in Fig. 18.14, namely, it overlaps the lower portion of the conduction
band forming the so-called impurity band. In addition, the dopant atoms are close
to each other, to the extent that the probability of tunneling of an electron, from
a neutral to a nearby, ionized donor atom, is not negligible (Sect. 18.7.2). In a
nonequilibrium condition, the tunneling electrons give rise to a current density;
the phenomenon is referred to as impurity-band conduction. From the practical
standpoint, the union of the conduction and impurity bands is viewed as a broader

Band-Gap Narrowing

conduction band whose lower edge is shifted with respect to the undoped, or
moderately doped case; the effect is also called band-gap narrowing. The analysis is
similar when a large concentration of acceptor atoms is present. In conclusion, band-
gap narrowing is in general produced by the lowering of the conduction-band edge,
EC.r/ > 0, combined with the lifting of the valence-band edge, EV.r/ > 0.
Both quantities are position dependent because in general the dopant concentrations
are such. Indicating with ECi, EVi the lower edge of the conduction band and,
respectively, the upper edge of the valence band in the undoped or moderately doped
case, and observing that the variations due to heavy doping are positive, one has for
the actual positions of the band edges:
EC.r/ D ECi  EC.r/ ;
EV.r/ D EVi C EV.r/ ;
(18.63)
whence
EG.r/ D EGi  EG.r/ ;
EGi D ECi  EVi ;
EG D EC C EV > 0 :
(18.64)
To calculate the carrier concentrations when band-gap narrowing is present, one
must replace EC with ECi  EC.r/ in the second relation of (18.56), and EV with
EVi C EV.r/ in the second relation of (18.57), to ﬁnd

Band-gap narrowing makes e, h to increase with respect to the moderately doped
case; as a consequence, the equilibrium carrier concentrations n and p are larger
as well. As mentioned in Sect. 18.3, band gap is measured by either electrical or
optical methods. The results of gap’s measurements, that show that EG decreases
when the dopant concentration exceeds some limiting value Nr, are usually rendered
in compact form by means of interpolating expressions, an example of which is, for

effect of the total doping concentration, without distinguishing between the donor
or acceptor contribution to band-gap narrowing. For this reason, when band-gap
narrowing is accounted for in numerical calculations, EG is equally distributed
between the two bands, namely, EC D EV D EG=2.

It is interesting to note that the onset of band-gap narrowing corresponds to a
total dopant concentration of about 1017 cm3, where the nondegeneracy condition
still holds. As a consequence, a range of dopant concentrations exists where the
exponential approximation can be used for the equilibrium carrier concentrations,
whereas the band-gap narrowing effect must be accounted for.19 The nondegeneracy

Si, Ge, GaAs in the Manufacturing of Integrated
Circuits
As noted in Sect. 18.3, silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide have similar
effective densities of states, but different gap extensions (Table 18.1); in this respect,
silicon is considered as a reference material, so that germanium is indicated as a
narrow-gap material while gallium arsenide is indicated as a wide-gap material.
The differences in the gap extension produce huge differences in the intrinsic
concentration ni (Table 18.2); the latter, in turn, has a strong inﬂuence on the
functioning of the integrated circuits. In fact, the saturation current of a p-n junction
is proportional to n2
i (Sect. 21.3.1); as a consequence, this parameter determines the
current of the junction when a reverse bias is applied to it. When many junctions
are present, as is typically the case in integrated circuits, the inverse currents may
build up and give rise to a substantial parasitic current. From this standpoint, gallium
arsenide is preferable with respect to silicon, which in turn is preferable with respect
to germanium. Gallium arsenide is also preferable because of the smaller effective
mass of the electrons, which makes the electron mobility larger (Sect. 17.6.6). On
the other hand, silicon is much less expensive; in fact it is the second most abundant
element in Earth’s crust (the ﬁrst one is oxygen); gallium, germanium, and arsenic
are much rarer.
The historical development of the semiconductor-device manufacture has fol-
lowed, instead, a different path. Until the mid-sixties of the last century, germanium
was preferred; the reason for this was that a technological process, able to purify
the material to the level required by the electronic industry, was available for
germanium ﬁrst. As soon as the puriﬁcation method became available for silicon
as well, the latter replaced germanium in the fabrication of semiconductor devices
and, soon after, of integrated circuits. The silicon technology developed with a
steady pace, giving rise to decades of exponential miniaturization and development
in the integrated-circuit manufacture. The miniaturization of gallium-arsenide-based
circuits did not proceed with the same pace because the technology of compound
materials is more complicate.
In 1980, practically 100% of the worldwide market share of integrated circuit
was silicon based, almost equally distributed between the bipolar and MOSFET
technologies [21]. In the following years the MOSFET technology became domi-
nant, reaching a market share of 88% in the year 2000; of the remaining 12%, the
bipolar, silicon-based technology kept an 8% share, while the remaining 4% was
taken by integrated circuits using III-V compounds.
In 1989, germanium was introduced again in the silicon integrated-circuit
technology to form silicon-germanium alloys (Si1xGex). The alloy makes a ﬂexible
band-gap tuning possible; it is used for manufacturing heterojunction bipolar tran-
sistors, yielding higher forward gain and lower reverse gain than traditional bipolar
transistors. Another application of the alloy is in the Silicon-Germanium-On-

Insulator (SGOI) technology. The difference in the lattice constants of germanium
and silicon induces a strain in the material under the gate, that makes electron

18.7.2
Qualitative Analysis of the Impurity Levels
A qualitative analysis of the impurity levels may be carried out basing on a modiﬁed
version of the Kronig-Penney model discussed in Sect. 17.9.4. To this purpose,
consider the case of donor atoms placed at equal distances in a one-dimensional
lattice, like that of Fig. 18.16. The deeper wells are those introduced by the dopants,
while the ﬁner structure above the x axis is due to the semiconductor nuclei.
Note that the relative distances in the ﬁgure are not realistic and are used only
for illustrative purposes; assuming in fact that the structure represented a cross-
section of a three-dimensional semiconductor, where a uniform donor concentration
ND is present, the distance between two neighboring impurity atoms is found to
be .1=ND/1=3. If the semiconductor’s concentration is Nsc, the ratio .Nsc=ND/1=3
indicates how many semiconductor atoms are present in the interval between two
neighboring impurities. Considering silicon by way of example (Nsc D 5  1022
cm3) and taking ND D 5  1016 cm3 yield .Nsc=ND/1=3 D 100.
With this provision, let c be the width of the barrier separating two dopant-
induced wells, and consider a negative value E0 of the electron’s energy. If c is
large, the probability that the electron tunnels from a well to an adjacent, empty one
is negligibly small; in this case, the electron is conﬁned within the well where the
localization probability is the largest, and the energy states E0 < 0 are similar to
those of a single well (the energy states of the ﬁnite rectangular well are worked
out in Sect. 11.5). The lowest state of the well is the ground state ED shown in
Fig. 18.16. If, instead, a positive energy state E is considered, the wave function is
extended over the whole lattice like in the Kronig-Penney model. In summary, the
addition of dopant atoms with a low or moderately high concentration, such that

their mutual distance c is large, provides a set of energy states that adds up to the
band structure of the intrinsic semiconductor. The states introduced by the dopants
are localized in space at the positions of the dopant atoms, and are distributed in
energy as discrete levels whose mutual distances depend on the form of the well. In
turn, the states with positive energy have a structure similar to that of the intrinsic
semiconductor, because in this respect the dopant atoms have little effect on the
lattice; in Fig. 18.16, the lower edge EC of the conduction band coincides with
E D 0. As said above, electrons belonging to the dopant atoms cannot move as
long as they are conﬁned within wells, because tunneling is precluded; on the other
hand, they may be promoted to conduction-band states by absorbing energy in a
collision, and become band electrons, that is, mobile. Conversely, a band electron
may lose energy due to a collision, and be trapped in an empty well.
When, due to an increasing dopant concentration, the width c of the barrier
becomes smaller, the transmission coefﬁcient increases, and the electrons belonging
to the wells have a non-negligible probability of moving from a well to another.
When the structure of the wells becomes ﬁner, the description of their energy
states becomes more similar to that applicable to the intrinsic semiconductor: for an
inﬁnite structure one obtains a continuum of states that ﬁll up the well and connect
to those of the conduction band. This explains the band-gap narrowing phenomenon
introduced in Sect. 18.6.
18.7.3
Position of the Impurity Levels
To determine the position of the impurity levels for the case of a low or moderately
high impurity concentration of the donor type, one considers the dispersion relation
E.k/ of the conduction band of the intrinsic semiconductor, in the parabolic-band
approximation (17.57,17.58):

Now, assume that a donor-type impurity is added in the origin, and that the impurity
is ionized. As a consequence, it gives rise to a hydrogenic-like potential energy20
of the form V D q2=.4  "sc r/. The effect of V may be considered as a local
perturbation over the band structure, so that when the ionized impurity is present
the total energy of an electron becomes H D E.k/ C V.r/, with E.k/ the same as in
the unperturbed case. Shifting the origin of k to ka, and replacing ki with i @=@xi,
20Compare with Sect. 7.2. Like in Sect. 18.5, the semiconductor permittivity is used instead of that
of vacuum, because the wave function of an electron subjected to the force due to V extends over
several lattice cells.

Chapter 19
Mathematical Model of Semiconductor Devices
19.1
Introduction
This chapter describes the reasoning that leads from the single-particle Schrödinger
equation for an electron in a crystal to the mathematical model of semiconductor
devices. The latter is a set of equations describing the evolution in space and time
of a number of average quantities of interest: with reference to the electrons of the
conduction band or holes of the valence band, such quantities are the concentration,
average velocity, current density, average kinetic energy, and so on. The model of
semiconductor devices has different levels of complexity depending on the trade-off
between the information that one needs to acquire about the physical behavior of the
device under investigation and the computational cost of the system of differential
equations to be solved. In fact, the possible models are hierarchically ordered from
the drift-diffusion model, which is the simplest one, to the hydrodynamic model, and
so on. In essence, these models are different approaches to the problem of solving, in
a more or less simpliﬁed form, the Boltzmann Transport Equation. Those described
in this chapter are the most widely adopted in the commercial simulation programs
used by semiconductor companies. Other important methods, that are not addressed
in this book, are the Monte Carlo method and the spherical-harmonics expansion.
The steps leading to the mathematical model of semiconductor devices start
with a form of the single-particle Schrödinger equation based on the equivalent
Hamiltonian operator, where it is assumed that the external potential energy is a
small perturbation superimposed to the periodic potential energy of the nuclei; this
leads to a description of the collisionless electron’s dynamics in terms of canonically
conjugate variables, that are the expectation values of the wave packet’s position and
momentum. The dynamics of the Hamiltonian type makes it possible to introduce
the statistical description of a many-electron system, leading to the semiclassical
Boltzmann Transport Equation. After working out the collision operator, the per-
turbative approximation is considered; the simpliﬁed form of the transport equation
thus found is tackled by means of the moments method, whence the hydrodynamic
and drift-diffusion versions of the model are derived. A detailed analysis of the

derivation of the electron and hole mobility in the parabolic-band approximation
is provided. Then, the semiconductor model is coupled with Maxwell’s equation,
and the applicability of the quasi-static approximation is discussed. The typical
boundary conditions used in the analysis of semiconductor devices are shown, and
an example of analytical solution of the one-dimensional Poisson equation is given.
The complements discuss the analogy between the equivalent Hamiltonian
operator and the corresponding Hamiltonian function introduced in an earlier
chapter, provide a detailed description of the closure conditions of the models, and
illustrate the Matthiessen’s rule for the relaxation times. Finally, a short summary of
the approximations leading to the derivation of the semiconductor model is given.
19.2
Equivalent Hamiltonian Operator
The separation procedure outlined in Sects. 16.2 through 16.5 has led to the single-
electron Schrödinger equation (17.40), namely, Œ„2=.2 m/ r2CV w D E w, where
the nuclei are kept ﬁxed and the force acting onto the electron derives from a
potential energy having the periodicity of the direct lattice: V.r C l/ D V.r/, with
l given by (17.1); as mentioned in Sects. 16.4,16.5, the external forces are absent
(Uext D 0).
Thanks to the periodicity of the Hamiltonian operator (17.40) it is possible to
recast the time-independent Schrödinger equation into a different form as shown
below. The procedure is based on the analogy with the Schrödinger equation for a
free particle, r2w D k2 w with k2 D 2 m E=„2. One notes in fact that the left-hand
side is obtained by replacing k with i grad in the right-hand side; this is just another
form of the transformation of momentum into the momentum operator (Sect. 8.5),
which in the present case yields the whole Hamiltonian operator because for a free
particle the energy is purely kinetic. This type of transformation can be pursued
also for the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential energy by observing that
the eigenvalues Ei.k/, for each branch i, are periodic within the reciprocal, scaled
lattice, Ei.k C g/ D Ei.k/ (Sect. 17.6), hence they can be expanded in terms of the
direct-lattice translation vectors l (Sect. 17.3):

The eigenvalue Ei.k/ is now transformed into an operator by letting k  i grad;

coefﬁcients Eil of expansion (19.1). To complete the procedure one must show that
operator (19.2) has the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the original operator
Œ„2=.2 m/ r2 C V w D E w. Applying Ei.i grad/ to a Bloch function wik yields,
using the ﬁrst relation in (19.1) and the periodicity1 of ik (Sect. 17.6),

The result

(19.4)
shows that, for each branch i, the purely kinetic operator Ei.i grad/ has the same
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the Hamiltonian whence Ei.k/ originates. For this
reason, operator Ei.i grad/ is called equivalent Hamiltonian. In summary, when
the potential energy is periodic it is possible to directly reconstruct an equivalent
operator by letting k  i grad, in the same way as for a free particle. In this
respect, the latter case may be viewed as a limiting condition of the former one,
obtained by extending the period of the potential energy to inﬁnity.2 Another
similarity between the free-particle case and that of a periodic potential energy is
that the Hamiltonian operator is purely kinetic (albeit, in the latter case, at the cost
of a more complicate form of the kinetic term).

However, expansion (19.8) is inconvenient because the Hamiltonian operator
in (19.7) is not periodic; as a consequence, the properties of the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions typical of the periodic case are lost. A more suitable expansion4 is
found by using the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator corresponding to
U D 0, namely, the Bloch functions; in this case the coefﬁcients of the expansion

So far, the only approximation in (19.10) is the use of a single branch n of the
dispersion relation. On the other hand, it must be observed that in the sum V CU the
ﬁrst term has the periodicity of the lattice, namely, it varies rapidly in space, whereas
the external potential energy is typically a slowly varying function; in fact, it is due

to the application of external generators and/or to the presence of a nonuniform
distribution of charge within the material.5 Also, the ﬁeld associated with U is weak,
so that it does not inﬂuence the form of V. This leads to the idea of treating U as a
perturbation superimposed to the periodic Hamiltonian operator „2=.2m/ r2 C V.
Using this approximation, the Hamiltonian operator of the perturbed problem is
rewritten as

(19.11)
where index n reminds one that the eigenfunctions of only the nth branch are
used in the expansion. The approximation inherent in (19.11) consists in using the
properties of the unperturbed problem in the perturbed case; in fact, the functional
dependence of En.i grad/ on i grad derives from the unperturbed eigenvalues
En.k/. Remembering that En.i grad/ is purely kinetic, (19.11) is similar to the
Hamiltonian operator of a particle subjected only to the external potential U. The

a system of coupled differential equations in the unknowns cnk. More interesting it
is to use (19.12) for calculating the expectation values of position and momentum;
remembering that  ' exp.i ˚n0/ n0 A is normalized to unity, one readily ﬁnds

is classiﬁed as “external” because it can be treated as a perturbation. Instead, rapid variations
of the physical properties of the material, like those that typically occur at interfaces, cannot be
treated using the perturbative method and require the solution of the Schrödinger equation without
approximations.

is described by Hamilton equations (compare with (1.42)), where r0 D hri and
„ k0 D hpi play the role of position and momentum, respectively. It follows that
Hn is a Hamiltonian function proper. Another important observation is that the time
variations of the wave packet’s momentum are due to the external force only; as a
consequence, if U D const one has „ Pk0 D 0, namely, the crystal momentum is a
constant of motion.
A further insight into the structure of Hn is obtained by calculating the work
exerted onto the wave packet by the external force gradr0U D „ Pk0 during an
elementary time dt:
dW D „ Pk0 dr0 D „ Pk0 un dt D „ un dk0 D .gradkEn/k0 dk0 D dEn :
(19.22)
The work equals the variation of En; it follows that En, apart from an additive
constant, is the kinetic energy of the wave packet. In turn, U is the potential
energy which, as mentioned above, derives from the external force only. If the force
acting on the electron is due to an electric ﬁeld, then U D q '; this justiﬁes the
modiﬁed form (18.54) of the Fermi-Dirac statistics to be used when an electric ﬁeld
is present.7 In the more general case where a magnetic ﬁeld is also acting on the
electron, „ ı Pk is given by the Lorentz force
„ ı Pk D F D q .E C un ^ B/ ;
(19.23)
and the Hamiltonian operator in (19.12) must be modiﬁed accordingly (compare
with (9.19)).
It is important to remark again that the description of the wave packet’s dynamics
given in this section holds when the force is a weak perturbation with respect to the
unperturbed situation. As a consequence, the description does not apply when the
electron undergoes a collision; in fact, the force acting during a collision is strong
and cannot be treated as a perturbation.
7More comments about the analogy with the perturbation theory in the classical case are made in
Sect. 19.6.1.

kinetic energy of the classical case. The same applies to the expression of group
velocity given by (17.61), namely,
u D . Oma/1 „ ık :
(19.25)
Replacing (19.25) into (19.24) yields Ee D .1=2/ Omau  u. When the expectation
value „ k0 of momentum coincides with „ ka, corresponding to an absolute mini-
mum EC of the conduction band, it is Ee D 0. Such a value is also the minimum
of the positive-deﬁnite quadratic form at the right-hand side of (19.24). This shows
that Ee is the kinetic energy of the electron, and allows one to identify EC as the
additive constant mentioned above.
In general, the relation between force and acceleration within a crystal is
anisotropic. For the sake of simplicity consider the case of the parabolic-band
approximation; the time derivative of (19.25) then yields
Pu D . Oma/1 „ ı Pk D . Oma/1 F :
(19.26)
If the entries of the mass tensor are different from each other, the acceleration is not
parallel to the force; the physical reason for this is easily understood if one thinks
that the forces due to the crystal structure are embedded in the mass tensor through
the second derivatives of E.k/. The mass tensor becomes a scalar only if the branch
E is isotropic: Oma D ma I , with I the identity tensor. More comments about this
issue are made in Sect. 19.6.2.
The analysis for the valence band is similar. Again, the branch index n is dropped

which, again, shows that E is the kinetic energy of the electron apart from an additive
constant. The negative signs in (19.27) and (19.28) make the discussion of the
valence-band case somewhat awkward; however, the difﬁculty is readily eliminated
if one refers to holes instead of electrons. For example, consider the case of an
electron whose expectation value of momentum, initially equal to „ ka, is brought
by the action of an external ﬁeld to some other value „ k0
0 in the vicinity of „ ka.
For this transition to occur it is implied that the initial state ka is occupied9 and
the ﬁnal state k0
0 is empty. As a consequence of (19.27), E changes from EV to
E.k0
0/ < EV, namely, it decreases during the time interval t during which the
energy variation occurs; hence, the external ﬁeld has exerted in t a negative work
onto the electron, in fact, energy has been absorbed from the electron by the ﬁeld.
If a hole is considered instead, the initial and ﬁnal states of the transition exchange
roles; however, from the standpoint of the energy balance nothing changes, namely,
the ﬁeld still absorbs energy from the particle. It follows that the hole’s energy must
decrease due to the transition: this is possible only if the energy axis associated
with the hole is reversed with respect to that of the electron, so that, apart from an
additive constant, the hole’s kinetic energy is E. From this point on, the reasoning
becomes identical to that outlined above for the electron of the conduction band:
using (19.27), when the expectation value „ k0 of momentum coincides with „ ka,
corresponding to an absolute maximum EV of the valence band, it is Eh D 0. Such
a value is also the minimum of the positive-deﬁnite quadratic form at the right-hand
side of (19.27). This shows that Eh is the kinetic energy of the hole, and allows one
to identify EV as the additive constant.
19.3
Dynamics in the Phase Space
The theory outlined in Sects. 19.2, 19.2.1, and 19.2.2 has led to the conclusion that
the dynamics of the expectation values of a wave packet describing an electron’s
motion, subjected to an external potential energy that varies slowly in space, is
described by the Hamilton equations (19.21) where hri and hpi play the role of
position and momentum.
9For the sake of simplicity, spin is not considered here.

For a system made of a large number of electrons, the description of the dynamics
of the individual wave packets is impossible from the practical standpoint. In this
case one resorts to the same device as that used in Sect. 6.2 for a system of classical
particles, namely, the distribution function. Being the formal apparatus identical to
that of Sect. 6.2, only the relevant differences will be remarked. The

(compare with (1.57)) so that the distribution function10 reads f D f.r; k; t/. Note
that the units of f are different from those of the classical distribution function. For
the latter, in fact, it is Œf
 D .J s/3, so that the product f
 d3r d3p is dimensionless
(compare with (6.1)); in the present case, instead, both f d3r d3k and d3r d3k are
dimensionless, hence the distribution function itself is dimensionless.
The system considered for the investigation is that of the electrons belonging to
the conduction band. Remembering the ﬁrst relation in (6.3), the concentration and
average velocity of such electrons are given by

with u the electron’s group velocity. In the equilibrium condition it is f eq D Q P,
where the Fermi-Dirac statistics P depends on k only through E.k/, namely, it
is even with respect to k. In turn, u D .1=„/ gradkE is odd, so that the whole
integrand in the second deﬁnition of (19.31) is odd. As the integration domain is
symmetric with respect to k D 0, it is veq D 0 as should be. In a nonequilibrium
condition it is f D Q ˚, with ˚.r; k/ the occupation probability of a state. If
the band is completely ﬁlled, then ˚ D 1; the electron ﬂux n v then becomes
proportional to the integral of u; as the latter is odd, the ﬂux vanishes: this explains
why a completely ﬁlled band does not contribute to the material’s conduction, as
anticipated in Sect. 17.6.5.
The Boltzmann collisionless equation in the r; k space is derived in the same
manner as for (6.28); it reads

The effects of collisions may be grouped into two classes: the collisions of the
ﬁrst class induce transitions that change the number of electrons of the band.
Such transitions are the generations and recombinations introduced in Sect. 17.6.6,
where the initial state of the electron belongs to the conduction band and the ﬁnal
one belongs to the valence band, or vice versa.11 The transitions of this class are
collectively called inter-band transitions.
The collisions of the second class are those where the initial and ﬁnal state belong
to the same band, and are called intra-band transitions; they do not change the
number of electrons of the band. The distinction between the two classes is useful
because the inter-band transitions exhibit characteristic times that are much larger
than those of the intra-band transitions. In turn, the intra-band transitions are further
divided into two subclasses: the intra-valley transitions, where the initial and ﬁnal
states are in the vicinity of the same extremum of the band, and the inter-valley
transitions, where the initial and ﬁnal state are in the vicinity of different extrema.12
Within each class, the transitions are further grouped depending on the entity
with which the collision occurs; typical examples of collisions are those with
phonons, impurities, defects, and photons. Like in the classical case, collisions are
not accounted for in the derivation of (19.32), where the effect of only the slowly
varying external potential energy is present; the further time change of f due to
collisions is more conveniently kept separate from that of the external potential
energy. Also, it is assumed that the system under consideration is dilute, so that
each wave packet spends a relatively large fraction of time without suffering any
collision; in other terms, the time during which an electron is subjected to the
external ﬁeld is much longer than that involved in a collision. For this reason it
is preferable to write the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), when the collisions
are accounted for, as
@f
@t C u  gradrf  q
„ .E C u ^ B/  gradkf D C
(19.33)
(compare with (6.29) and (6.31)). To derive (19.33), the expression (19.23) of the
Lorentz force acting on the electron is used, after dropping index n from the group
velocity. Term C embeds the forces acting during the collisions; such forces are
short ranged and much more intense than those due to the external ﬁeld; as a
consequence, the Ehrenfest approximation (10.33) does not apply, so that a full
quantum-mechanical approach is necessary to treat the collision term.
The relations involving the expectation values at the left-hand side of (19.32)
and (19.33) are formally identical to those of the classical case, despite the fact
11In addition to this one must also consider the trapping-detrapping phenomena involving localized
states. So far, only the localized states due to dopants have been considered (Sect. 18.4); other types
of localized states are introduced in Chap. 20.
12Here the extrema are the minima of the conduction band. The region near an extremum of a band
is also called valley.

the dynamic variables are actually derived from a quantum-mechanical description;
in addition, the electromagnetic ﬁeld appears in the non-quantized form. Therefore,
the form of such equations is also called semiclassical.
19.3.1
Collision Term
The left-hand side of (19.33) equals df=dt, whence the right-hand side is the rate of
change of f due to collisions. As f.r; k; t/ d3r d3k is the number of electrons of the
conduction band that at time t belong to the elementary volume d3r d3k centered on
.r; k/, the rate of change can be expressed as
C D Cin  Cout ;
(19.34)
where Cin d3r d3k is the number of electrons entering d3r d3k per unit time, due to
collisions, and Cout d3r d3k is the number of electrons leaving d3r d3k per unit time,
due to collisions. To illustrate the reasoning it is convenient to refer to Fig. 19.1,
where a one-dimensional case is illustrated using the x; k coordinates. Instead of an
elementary volume dx dk, a ﬁnite, rectangular cell is considered, whose position at
time t1 is ﬁxed by the vertices A1, B1, C1, and D1. For simplicity it is assumed that no
external force is present (U D const), so that the crystal momentum is conserved.
In particular, the vertices’ momenta at t D t1 are „ km D „ k.A1/ D „ k.B1/ and
„ kM D „ k.C1/ D „ k.D1/. The corresponding positions are x.A1/ D x.C1/ D 0,
x0 D x.B1/ D x.D1/. Letting m indicate the effective mass, the position of the
vertices at a subsequent time t2 D t1 C t is
x.A2/ D „ km
m t ;
x.B2/ D x0 C x.A2/ ;
x.C2/ D „ kM
m t ;
x.D2/ D x0 C x.C2/ ;
this giving rise to the parallelogram also shown in Fig. 19.1. If no collisions occur,
the electrons inside the parallelogram at t D t2 are the same as those that were
inside the rectangle at t D t1; in contrast, when collisions occur, some electrons
leave the rectangle without reaching the parallelogram (hence, Cout ¤ 0), while
the parallelogram is reached by other electrons that originally did not belong to
the rectangle (Cin ¤ 0). This is schematically indicated by the arrows in Fig. 19.1.
In general it is Cout ¤ Cin, so that df=dt ¤ 0. The description is the same also in
the case when the external force is present, the difference being that the trajectories
in the phase space are not rectilinear and the deformation of the domain is more
complicate.
To give the analysis a more formal aspect it is necessary to determine how the
population of the elementary domain d6s D d3r d3k evolves in the elementary time
interval dt. To begin, one introduces the scattering probability per unit time and unit

is the probability per unit time that an electron scatters from .r; k/ to the elementary
volume d3r0 d3k0 centered at .r0; k0/. Then, let dNin D Cin d6s, dNout D Cout d6s,
and s D .r; k/, s0 D .r0; k0/. The number dNin is determined by observing that the
electrons contributing to it are those that initially belong to elementary phase-space
volumes, say, d6s0, different from d6s. The population of d6s0 at time t is f.s0; t/ d6s0;
if the latter is multiplied by the scattering probability per unit time from s0 to d6s,
given by S .s0 ! s/ d6s, the unconditional number of transitions from d6s0 to d6s is
obtained. The actual number of such transitions is then found by remembering that
electrons are fermions, so that transitions towards d6s are possible only if the ﬁnal
states are empty; in other terms, the unconditional number of s0 ! s transitions
must be multiplied by 1  ˚.s; t/, where ˚.s; t/ is the probability that the ﬁnal state
is full. Finally, the contributions of all elementary volumes d6s0 must be summed

Point-Like Collisions
The two summands (19.38), (19.39) in the expression of C are substantially
simpliﬁed thanks to the property that the collisional forces, albeit very strong, are
short ranged; as a consequence, whereas the momentum of the colliding electron
may undergo a large change due to the collision, the electron’s position changes
little. The issue is illustrated with the aid of Fig. 19.2, that schematically describes
an electron collision with a negatively ionized dopant. The latter is represented by
the black circle, whereas the gray region around it indicates the positive charge
attracted by the negative ion; such a positive charge acts like an electric screen
that tends to neutralize the ion. As a consequence of the screen, the decay of the
electrostatic potential acting between the ion and the incoming electron, when the
relative distance increases, is much stronger than in the pure Coulomb case.15 In
practice, one can assume that the electron-ion repulsion is non-negligible only when
the electron is inside the screen. This makes the dynamics of the interaction rather
different from that of the pure Coulomb case, treated in Sect. 3.8. As shown in the
ﬁgure, the ﬁnal momentum k0 may differ largely from the initial one, k; in contrast,
considering the atomic scale of the phenomenon, the ﬁnal position r0 may be thought
of as coinciding with the initial one, r. To vest this observation with mathematical

Another important consequence of the above discussion is that although the duration
of the interaction is very short, the force acting on the electron due the interaction
is much stronger than the external forces, to the extent that the effects of the latter
can be neglected during the interaction itself. It follows that S and S0 do not depend
on the external forces; this greatly simpliﬁes the analysis of S0. Inserting (19.40)

The term S0 is typically calculated using the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory

so that (19.41) is in fact the only contribution to C. The latter is recast in a more

In the derivation of (19.44) no distinction is made between the inter-band and intra-

For the semiconductors of interest, the relaxation times deﬁned in (19.45) differ by
several orders of magnitude (e.g., in electronic-grade silicon17 is b > 106 s, v <
1012 s). This makes the intra-band transitions dominant ( D b v=.bCv/ ' v);
one exception exists though, where the effects of the intra-band transitions cancel
each other exactly, so that the inter-band transitions only are left. Such an exception
is discussed in Sect. 19.4.
19.3.3
Perturbative Form of the BTE
The Boltzmann Transport Equation (19.44) is an integral-differential equation in the
phase space and time, in the unknown f. The kernel of the integral part is S0, while
the equation coefﬁcients are E.r; t/, B.r; t/, .r; k/, and u.k/ D .1=„/ gradkH. In
equilibrium f becomes f eq D Q P, with P.r; k/ the Fermi-Dirac statistics; as shown
in Sect. 19.2.2, P depends on position if the semiconductor is not uniform. Moreover
it is df eq=dt D 0; hence, to make the collision term to vanish at equilibrium, it must
be Qf eq D f eq (detailed-balance principle, Sect. 6.5).
In general, the solution of the BTE is quite a difﬁcult task. The issue of effective
solution methods for this equation will be introduced later; however, a solution
procedure is outlined here which, although seldom used in practical cases, has the
advantage of providing a simpliﬁed form of (19.44), upon which a number of models
for semiconductor-device analysis are based. The procedure consists in setting up
17The semiconductor’s puriﬁcation degree necessary for manufacturing integrated circuit is called
electronic grade; it indicates that the ratio between the concentration of impurities and that of the
semiconductor atoms is smaller than 109. Lower-quality materials, with a ratio smaller than 106,
are used in the fabrication of solar cells; in this case the puriﬁcation degree is called solar grade.

ﬁrst-perturbation solution. In many cases of practical interest, the material or device

It is interesting to comment on the form of (19.47). The ﬁrst term at the left-

time; hence, it vanishes in a nonequilibrium condition if the latter is of the steady-
state type. The second term vanishes if the distribution function is independent
of the spatial coordinates, hence it describes a contribution to electron transport
that originates from a spatial nonuniformity. For this reason this term is called
diffusive term (compare with Sect. 23.3). The third term vanishes if the external
force is missing, hence it originates from the action of the external forces on the
electrons and, for this reason, is called drift term. At the right-hand side of (19.47),
the magnitude of the relaxation time inﬂuences the amount by which the distribution
function departs from equilibrium; to better show this, one recasts (19.47) as
f D f eq   L f ;

(19.48)

the perturbative solution is in fact acceptable if the relaxation time is sufﬁciently
small.18 It is worth adding that in Classical Mechanics a simpliﬁed form of (19.48)
is widely used to investigate transport problems. A brief outline of the procedure is
given in Sect. 19.6.7.
18On the other hand, in a collisionless case it is S0 ! 0 whence, from (19.43), it follows  ! 1.
In this situation there is no limit to the departure of f from f eq.

Moments Expansion of the BTE
The moments expansion of the BTE is a transformation method that has successfully
been applied to the analysis of semiconductor devices. It reduces the original
equation to a set of partial-differential equations in the r; t space; the number of
such equations can be adapted to the type of information to be acquired about the
device under investigation. More speciﬁcally, applying the moments method to the
BTE and truncating the series of moments at a suitable order, one extracts from the
BTE a hierarchically ordered set of models, ranging from the simplest to the more
complicate ones ( [112–114], and references therein).
The BTE is an equation in the r; k; t space. The basic idea of the moments
method is that for the description of carrier-transport phenomena in semiconductor
devices, it is often sufﬁcient to rely on equations deﬁned over the r; t space alone; in
fact, for practical applications the information about the distribution of the crystal
momentum is less important. The equations in the r; t space are extracted from
the BTE by multiplying the latter by suitable functions ˛.k/ and integrating the
result over the k space. The integration saturates the k coordinates and, as shown in
Sect. C.6, provides an equation in the r; t space.20 Remembering that the electron
dynamics using the equivalent Hamiltonian operator is described by expanding
the electron’s wave function in terms of the Bloch functions (Sect. 19.2.1), the
integration over the k space is in fact limited to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. On the
other hand, the typical behavior of the distribution function at the boundary  of the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone is such that ˛.k/ f.r; k; t/ ! 0 when k ! k. This amount to
19Compare with the discussion carried out in Sect. 6.6.3.
20As indicated in Sect. C.6, term “moment" is speciﬁcally used when ˛ is a polynomial in k. As the
dependence of ˛ on k is not speciﬁed yet, it is implied that the form of ˛ is such that the integrals
in (19.51) converge.

assuming that there are no electrons at the boundary.21 From a practical standpoint,
the hypothesis has the same effect as that of replacing the ﬁrst Brillouin zone with
an inﬁnite domain and assuming that the distribution function in a nonequilibrium
condition vanishes at inﬁnity in the same exponential-like fashion as it does at
equilibrium, where it becomes proportional to the Fermi-Dirac statistics [108, 111].
With these premises, using the general form (19.33) of the equation, the moment of
the BTE with respect to ˛ reads

As the BTE is a continuity equation of the distribution function in the phase
space, (19.51) is expected to be a continuity equation in the r space; in fact, as shown
below, it is the continuity equation of the product n ˛, where n is the concentration
of the electrons in the conduction band, given by the ﬁrst relation in (19.31), and

This shows that (19.51) is the continuity equation of n ˛, as anticipated.
21In the case of the conduction band of germanium, the minima are at the boundary (Sect. 17.6.5),
which makes the hypothesis inconsistent as it stands; to perform the integration one must shift
the origin of the k space and exploit the periodicity of the band structure. The hypothesis that
the distribution function vanishes at the boundary of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone is made also in the
application of the moments method to the holes of the valence band.

In (19.59), the term containing the magnetic induction does not contribute to the

Here it is convenient to distinguish between the inter-band and intra-band transi-

Moment Equations
Adding up (19.53), (19.54), (19.56), (19.59), and (19.61) after multiplying the drift
terms by q=„ provides the explicit form of (19.51), that reads
@
@t .n ˛/ C divr .n ˛ u/ C q
„ n gradk˛  .E C u ^ B/ D WbŒ˛ C WvŒ˛ :
(19.62)
A simple reasoning shows that the equations of the form (19.62) that are obtained
from different choices of ˛ are coupled with each other. To show this one takes for
simplicity the one-dimensional case and let ˛ D c km, with m a positive integer and
c a constant. Also, the parabolic-band approximation is assumed to hold, so that u
is a linear function of k. It follows that the time derivative in (19.62) contains the
moment of order m of f, while the diffusion term (due to the product ˛ u) contains
the moment of order m C 1; in turn, the summand proportional to E in the drift
term contains the moment of order m  1 due to the derivative of ˛, while the
summand proportional to B contains the moment of order m. These considerations
are sufﬁcient to show that the equation whose unknown is the moment of order m is
coupled with those whose unknowns are the moment of order m  1 and m C 1.

474

Mathematical Model of Semiconductor Devices
In the typical applications of the moments expansion a ﬁnite set of equations
is considered, starting from the lowest-order moment m D 0 up to some order
m0. The system of equations thus obtained is indeterminate because, due to the
coupling mentioned above, the number of equations is m0 whereas the number of
unknown moments appearing in them is m0 C 1. To make the system determinate
it is then necessary to add an extra condition, that is found by prescribing an
approximate form of the .m0 C 1/th moment.22 Such a prescription reduces the
number of unknown moments to m0 and makes the system of differential equations
determinate; for this reason it is called closure condition. The typical choice for the
closure condition is to approximate the .m0 C 1/th moment using the equilibrium
distribution.
Moment of Order Zero
The moment of order zero is obtained by letting ˛ D 1 in (19.62), whose left-hand
side becomes @n=@t C divr .n u/; the electron concentration n is the moment of
order zero and u D v is the average velocity, as deﬁned in (19.31). If the zero-order
moment of the collision term does not introduce further unknowns, the equation’s
unknowns are two: n and v. The form of the left-hand side shows that integrating the
zero-order moment of the BTE over an arbitrary volume  of the r space provides
the balance equation for the number of electrons of the conduction band (compare
with Sect. 23.2):

WvŒ1 d ;
(19.63)
where † is the boundary of  and s the unit vector normal to †, oriented in
the outward direction. The second integral at the right-hand side of (19.63) does
not contribute to the electrons’ balance; in fact, it describes transitions that do not
inﬂuence the number of electrons of the band because both the initial and ﬁnal state
belong to it. On the other hand, due to the arbitrariness of , the integral vanishes
only if WvŒ1 D 0. This result shows that the zero-order moment of the intra-band
transitions vanishes,23 so that the only transitions of importance for the zero-order
moment, despite being dominated by much larger relaxation times, are the inter-
band ones. This is the exception anticipated in Sect. 19.3.2. The zero-order moment
for the electrons of the conduction band then reads
22The choice of the highest-order moment as the function to be approximated is reasonable in view
of the analysis of the moments method carried out in Sect. C.6. In fact, as the moments are the
coefﬁcients of a converging Taylor series, they become smaller and smaller as the order increases;
thus, the error due to approximating the highest-order coefﬁcient is expected to be the smallest.
23A similar reasoning is used to explain (20.16).

The form of the inter-band term WbŒ1, which is not relevant for the analysis in hand,
is worked out in Chap. 20.
General Form of the Higher-Order Moments
As shown above, the contribution of the intra-band transitions vanishes for ˛ D 1.
In contrast, it becomes dominant for other choices of ˛; in fact, in such cases the
intra-band transitions do not cancel out any more and their scattering rates turn out
to be much higher than those of the inter-band transitions. This allows one to adopt
an approximation for WbŒ˛, namely,
WbŒ˛ D

(19.65)
In other terms it is assumed that since the contribution of WbŒ˛ to the collision term
is small when ˛ ¤ 1, the error introduced by (19.65) is negligible. Expanding the
time derivative in (19.62) and using (19.64), (19.65) yield

where only the intra-band transitions appear. Due to its simpler form, (19.66) will
be used in the following to derive the balance equations with ˛ ¤ 1.
Moments of Order One, Two, and Three
The moment of order one of the BTE is found by letting ˛ D ui with i D 1; 2; 3
in (19.66); this yields the continuity equation for the ith component of the average
velocity of the electrons, ui D vi:
n @vi
@t C divr .n ui u/  vi divr .n v/ C q

To proceed it is necessary to introduce the deﬁnition of average kinetic energy and
average ﬂux of the electrons’ kinetic energy,24
24In the equilibrium condition the product Ee f eq is even with respect to k. In turn, u D
.1=„/ gradkE is odd, so that beq D 0. Compare with the similar comment made about the average

the equation reads

The choices ˛ D 1, ˛ D ui, ˛ D Ee, and ˛ D Ee ui are such that each moment
equation provides the balance relation of a dynamic quantity of interest: number
of electrons, average velocity, average kinetic energy, average ﬂux of the kinetic
energy; the even-order moments yield a scalar equation, whereas the odd-order
moments yield a vector equation.
19.4.6
Hierarchical Models
The order-one moment (19.67) contains the new unknown ui u besides n and v
already present in (19.64); the order-two moment (19.70) contains again n and v,
and the new unknowns w, b. The order-three moment contains n, v, b, and the
new unknown Ee ui u. The drift terms and the collision terms, depending on their
form, may or may not introduce extra unknowns; even if they don’t, the number
of unknowns listed above exceeds that of the equations. It is worth anticipating
that the ﬁnite set of balance equations indicated in Sect. 19.4.5 is obtained by
taking the equations in pairs: speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst pair is made of the balance
equations of order zero and one, (19.64) and (19.66), that are collectively termed
drift-diffusion model; in this case, the three unknowns n, v, and ui u are reduced to
two by the closure condition (Sect. 19.4.5), that consists in replacing the highest-
order moment ui u with its equilibrium expression. A more elaborate model is
obtained by taking the ﬁrst two pairs, namely, the balance equations of order zero

19.4
Moments Expansion of the BTE
477
through three, (19.64), (19.66), (19.71), and (19.71), that are collectively termed
hydrodynamic model; the six unknowns n, v, and ui u, w, b, Ee ui u are reduced
to ﬁve by prescribing the closure condition, then to four by determining a relation
between the second-order moments ui u and w.
By this procedure one constructs a set of hierarchically ordered models of
increasing complexity. The type of model adopted in practical applications depends
on the trade-off between the information that one needs to acquire about the physical
behavior of the device under investigation and the computational cost of the system
of differential equations to be solved. To date, the moments method has been
investigated up to order 6 [60], and has been extended to order 21 using a scheme
based on Legendre polynomial expansion [75]; the standard implementations in
the commercial simulation programs used by semiconductor Companies adopt the
hydrodynamic model.25
The balance equations derived so far are still rather cumbersome in view of the
application to the analysis of semiconductor devices. A number of simpliﬁcations
are illustrated below, which eventually lead to the standard form of the hydrody-
namic model [50, 54, 111, 116]. To begin, one considers the time derivatives at the
left-hand side of the balance equations. Such derivatives differ from zero only if
the distribution function depends explicitly on time, which typically happens when
time-dependent boundary conditions are imposed to the device under investigation.
In the practical cases, the maximum frequency of the electric signals applied to a
device or an integrated circuit is lower by many orders of magnitude than the inverse
relaxation times associated with the intra-band transitions; this makes it possible to
neglect the time derivatives of vi, w, and bi. A quasi-static approximation26 is thus
assumed in the continuity equations (19.67), (19.70), and (19.71). The argument
leading to this approximation does not apply to the case of (19.64) because only
the inter-band transitions take place there, whose relaxation times are much longer
than those of the intra-band transitions and, in many cases, also than the inverse
maximum frequency of the external signal. As a consequence, the term @n=@t
in (19.64) must be retained when the boundary conditions depend on time.
As a second approximation, one adopts the parabolic-band approximation; this
implies that in a nonequilibrium condition the electrons of the conduction band still
occupy energy states in the vicinity of the absolute minima. Such a condition is in
general fulﬁlled as shown below.27 Letting a indicate one of the absolute minima of
the conduction band and using (19.24) after dropping sufﬁx “0” yield
25Comprehensive reviews of the solution methods for the BTE are in [71, 72] as far as the Monte
Carlo method is concerned, and in [64] for deterministic methods.
26A similar reasoning is used to treat the time derivative of the vector potential when the
semiconductor equations are coupled with the Maxwell equations (Sect. 19.5.4).
27The adoption of the parabolic-band approximation may be avoided at the cost of redeﬁning the
carrier temperature and introducing more relaxation times [134].

the parabolic-band approximation refer to the ath valley. In principle, the electron

va, and so on; this is not done here to avoid complicacies in the notation. The sufﬁx
will be introduced in Sect. 19.5.2, where the contributions of the valleys are summed
up. This comment does not apply to the moment of order zero, (19.64), because its
derivation does not entail any simplifying hypothesis.
With these premises, one manipulates the terms ui u, Ee ui u by introducing the
auxiliary quantity c D u  v, called random velocity. Clearly it is ci D ui  vi D 0,

The last term at the right-hand side of (19.73) is called convective term. In the
typical operating conditions of the semiconductor devices this term can be neglected
(refer to [108] and the comments below). Replacing into (19.67) the simpliﬁed form
of (19.73) along with the second relation of (19.72) yields

The latter equation contains the unknowns n and v already present in (19.64), and
the new unknown ci c. The drift term does not introduce extra unknowns. Note that
ci c is actually made of three vectors, so that it may be thought of as a symmetric
3  3 tensor with components ci cj, i; j D 1; 2; 3. To give it a more compact form,
after observing that mia ci c has the units of an energy, one deﬁnes the electron-

In the equilibrium condition the electron-temperature tensor reduces to the product
of a scalar coefﬁcient times the identity tensor; in the limit of the Boltzmann dis-
tribution, the scalar coefﬁcient identiﬁes with the lattice temperature (Sect. 19.6.4),
thus providing an estimate of the modulus jcj of the random velocity. The modulus
jvj of the average velocity in a nonequilibrium condition can be estimated as well,
basing upon the current density and carrier concentration of the devices’ operating
conditions. It is found that in typical situations it is jvj  jcj, so that the average

motion of the carriers in a nonequilibrium condition can be thought of as that of a
slowly drifting ﬂuid. This justiﬁes the neglect of the convective term in (19.73), and
also allows one to neglect vi v with respect to ci c when these terms appear in the
same expression.
The simpliﬁcations used in (19.67) apply in the same manner to the moment of

Mathematical Model of Semiconductor Devices
Macroscopic Relaxation Times of the Higher-Order Moments
As remarked in Sect. (19.4.5), the collision terms of the moments of order higher
than zero account for the intra-band transitions only. These terms are worked out
here using the perturbative form of the BTE (Sect. 19.3.3); this approach is coherent
with the other approximations from which the balance equations (19.81–19.83)
derive. The collision term of (19.82) then becomes

with  ' v (Sect. 19.3.2). The equilibrium part is worked out by deﬁning the

where the deﬁnitions (19.68), (19.79) of the electrons’ average kinetic energy and

(19.86)
based on the observation that due to the smallness of the intra-band relaxation time
v, the distribution function departs little from the equilibrium one (Sect. 19.3.3).
The derivation of the analogues of w for the collision terms of (19.81)
and (19.83) is somewhat more complicate. In fact, in most semiconductors, among
which Si, Ge, and GaAs, the relaxation time v is even with respect to k [73],
which makes the integrals of ui f eq=v and Ee ui f eq=v to vanish because the
integrand is odd. To overcome the difﬁculty one expands f  f eq into a Taylor
series with respect to a parameter and truncates the series in such a way as to retain
the ﬁrst summand which is odd with respect to k. For instance, letting  be the
parameter28 and assuming that the ﬁrst-order term of the expansion is odd, one lets

with pi and bi the momentum-relaxation time and relaxation time of the energy ﬂux,
respectively.29 Due to their deﬁnitions, pi and bi are diagonal tensors. However,
as their degree of anisotropy is small, they are approximated by scalar quantities,
pi ' p and bi ' b. Investigations about the relaxation times have been carried
out by different techniques, speciﬁcally, the spherical-harmonics expansion method
to determine the dependence on the average energy [112, 116], and the Monte Carlo

Hydrodynamic and Drift-Diffusion Models
In Sect. 19.4 the moments method has been applied to derive a set of balance equa-
tions; the general form of the latter has successively been modiﬁed by introducing
a number of simpliﬁcations: among them is the parabolic-band approximation, due
to which, as indicated in Sect. 19.4.6, a set of equations restricted to the ath valley
of the conduction band is obtained. In order to recover the equations for the whole
band, it is necessary to add up the single-valley contributions. The procedure is
the same for the hydrodynamic and drift-diffusion models; it will be worked out
explicitly only for the simpler case of the drift-diffusion model.
19.5.1
HD Model
As anticipated in Sect. 19.4.6, the hydrodynamic (HD) model is obtained by
taking the balance equations of order zero through three, (19.64), (19.81), (19.82),
and (19.83), and imposing the closure condition onto the fourth-order moment.
For simplicity, the latter is considered in the nondegenerate case whence,
from (19.159), it is mia

29The term “momentum” for pi derives from the observation that the continuity equation for the
ith component of the average velocity vi of the electrons (19.67) may also be thought of as the
continuity equation for the ith component of the average momentum, mia vi. In turn, bi is also
called heat-relaxation time.

which constitute a system of ﬁrst-order, partial-differential equations in the
unknowns n, v, Te, and b. In general, the model’s equations are to be solved
over a volume that encloses the device under investigation; the boundary conditions
that typically apply are discussed in Sect. 19.5.6. Two of the equations are scalar
(namely, (19.91) and the ﬁrst one in (19.90)), while the other two are vector
equations. The system is nonlinear because the unknowns are multiplied by each
other.30 Note, however, that the second equation in (19.90) is linear with respect to
the components of v; the latter can be extracted and replaced into the two scalar
equations. The same procedure is applicable to (19.92), which is linear with respect
to the components of b. After the replacements are completed, the system reduces to
two scalar equations of the second order. An example is given in Sect. 19.5.5, with
reference to the simpler case of the drift-diffusion model. Due to the components mia
of the effective-mass tensor, the vector equations are anisotropic; however, when the
contributions of the different valleys are combined together, the anisotropy cancels
out (the explicit calculation is provided for the drift-diffusion model below).
The qualitative analysis of the model carried out above implies that the electric
ﬁeld and magnetic induction are known, so that they are embedded in the model’s
coefﬁcients. In fact, this is not true, because the ﬁelds are inﬂuenced by the
distribution of electric charge and current density that are some of the model’s
unknowns. For this reason, as shown below, the hydrodynamic equations, and the
drift-diffusion ones as well, must be coupled with the Maxwell equations.
19.5.2
DD Model
The drift-diffusion (DD) model is obtained by taking the balance equations of order
zero and one, (19.90), and imposing the closure condition onto the second-order
moment. For simplicity, the latter is considered in the nondegenerate case, whence

As indicated in Sect. 19.4.6, the ﬁrst equation in (19.93) refers to the whole
conduction band because its derivation did not entail any simplifying hypothesis;
in contrast, the second equation refers to the ath minimum of the band due to the
parabolic-band approximation. This explains the index attached to n and to the
average velocity; the momentum-relaxation time, instead, does not depend on the
valley [112]. As noted above, the dependence on the components via is linear,
which makes it possible to express them in terms of the other functions. In fact,
it is more convenient to extract, instead of va, the electron-current density of the
ath minimum; remembering (4.21) and (4.22), the latter is given by Ja D q na va.

silicon by way of example (MC D 6), the mass tensor is obtained from (17.82); thus,

As anticipated in the qualitative discussion about the HD model, despite the fact that
each vector equation is anisotropic, when the contributions of the different valleys
are combined together the anisotropy cancels out. From the deﬁnition of the electron
mobility n D .l C 2 t/=3 one may also extract a scalar effective mass mn D
q p=n that fulﬁlls 1=mn D .2=mt C 1=ml/=3. Using the room-temperature values
taken from Table 17.4 yields, for silicon, mn=m0 ' 0:26. By the same token one
ﬁnds an ' 2:61.
In the next sections, the current density of the electrons in the conduction band
will be used in equations involving also the current density of the holes in the
valence band; for this reason it is necessary to use different symbols. Speciﬁcally, Jn
for the former and Jp for the latter; with this provision, the above calculation yields
Jn D q n n E C q Dn gradn C q an n B ^ .n n E C Dn gradn/ ;
(19.107)

here, the DD model will be worked out. Remembering the discussion of Sect. 19.2.3
about the dynamics in the parabolic-band approximation, the model is described

in terms of the concentration and current density of holes. The two quantities are
deﬁned by adapting the corresponding expression for electrons, (19.31), as shown

(19.109)
In turn, the hole current density is deﬁned starting from the deﬁnition of the electron
current density of the valence band. The latter is similar to (19.31), the difference
being that the integration in (19.31) is restricted to the branch of E.k/ belonging to
the conduction band, whereas the integration in (19.110) below is restricted to one
of the two branches of the valence band:

u Q.1  ˚/ d3k  q
ZZZ C1
1

(19.111)
where the second integral vanishes because u is odd with respect to k. As a
consequence, the current density of the branch under consideration may also be
thought of as given by the motion of the empty states (holes), having the group
velocity u.k/ and the positive charge q. Moreover, one deﬁnes the average velocity
of holes using Q .1  ˚/ as weighing function, to ﬁnd

where the deﬁnition (19.109) of the hole concentration has been speciﬁed for the
branch under consideration, and the short-hand notation

Given the above deﬁnitions, the derivation of the drift-diffusion model for holes
follows the same pattern as for the electrons. Remembering the description of the
band structure given in Sect. 17.6.5, for the valence band index a ranges over h
and l; moreover, due to the isotropy of each branch deriving from the parabolic-
band approximation (compare with 17.78), the effective mass is scalar. Then, the

Coupling with Maxwell’s Equations
As anticipated in Sect. 19.5.1, as the electromagnetic ﬁeld is inﬂuenced by the
distribution of charge and current density, it is necessary to couple the equations
describing the charge transport (in the form, e.g., of the hydrodynamic or drift-
diffusion model) with the Maxwell equations. For this, one inserts the total charge
density % and current density J into the right-hand sides of (4.19); considering that
there are different groups of charges and currents, one uses (4.22), where the charge
density is given by (18.53), namely,33
% D q .p  n C N/ ;
N D NC
D  N
A :
(19.125)
In turn, the current density reads
J D Jp C Jn D %p vp C %n vn D q p vp  q n vn ;
(19.126)
with Jn and Jp given by (19.107) and (19.123), respectively. As noted in Sect. 18.5,
the material’s permittivity must be used here instead of vacuum’s; as a consequence,
the relation between electric displacement and ﬁeld reads D D "sc E.
One notes that the E and B ﬁelds are the sum of two contributions: the ﬁrst
one derives from the internal charge and current-density distribution as mentioned
above, while the second one derives from external sources, e.g., voltage or current
generators connected to the device or integrated circuits, or electric and magnetic
ﬁelds present in the environment. In general, the internal contribution to B is
negligible and is not considered in semiconductor devices or integrated circuit;
33Equation (18.53) is the deﬁnition of charge density in a semiconductor; as a consequence it holds
in general, not only in the equilibrium condition considered in Sect. 18.5. In fact, it can readily
be extended to account for charges trapped in energy states different from those of the dopants
(Sect. 20.2.2).

Hydrodynamic and Drift-Diffusion Models

it follows that B is to be accounted for in (19.107) and (19.123) only when
it derives from external sources34 and, due to this, it must be thought of as a
prescribed function of r and t. With these premises, the analysis will continue
here after letting B D 0. Despite this simpliﬁcation, the continuity and transport
equations (19.108), (19.107) and (19.123), (19.124) must be coupled with the whole
set of Maxwell equations: in fact, the expression of the electric ﬁeld in terms of the
potentials is given by the second relation in (4.26), namely, E D grad '  @A=@t;
as a consequence, in a dynamic condition both the scalar and vector potential must
be determined. In a steady-state or equilibrium condition, instead, the expression of
the electric ﬁeld reduces to E D grad '; in this case it is sufﬁcient to couple it
with the ﬁrst equation in (4.19) only.
The presence of the vector potential A makes the model more complicate; thus, it
is useful to ascertain whether, in the typical operating conditions, the time derivative
@A=@t in the expression of E should be kept or not. As noted above, the derivative
differs from zero only if the boundary conditions (e.g., the applied voltages) vary
with time. To associate a characteristic time with a boundary condition one takes
the period associated with the maximum frequency of the boundary condition’s
spectrum, min D 1=max; then, one compares min with the time t necessary for
the electromagnetic perturbation produced by the boundary condition to propagate
to a position internal to the semiconductor. If d is the distance between a point
on the boundary and an internal point, the propagation time can be estimated to
be t D d=uf , with uf the radiation’s phase velocity corresponding to max. If it
happens that t  min, the propagation is practically instantaneous, namely, the
electromagnetic ﬁeld at the internal point is consistent with the boundary condition
existing at the same instant of time; as a consequence, the boundary condition is
thought of as stationary, and the @A=@t derivative is neglected. This is called quasi-
static approximation; the condition of its applicability is summarized as35
t D d
uf
 min D
1
max
;
max  uf
d :
(19.127)
To estimate the condition one must ﬁx the value of d; as a conservative choice
one takes the channel length of the MOSFET transistors of the old generations,
d  107 m. Using uf  108 m s1 yields max  1015 Hz, which is amply
fulﬁlled in the present state-of-the-art integrated circuits. Note that the condition is
even better veriﬁed in the last-generation devices, whose channel length is shorter
than 107 m.
The choice of the channel length in the above estimate is dictated by the fact
that the channel is the active region of the device. Choosing, instead, d as the (much
34A typical example is found when a semiconductor device or circuit is used as a magnetic-ﬁeld
sensor or in speciﬁc measurement setups, like in the Hall-voltage measurement (Sect. 25.4).
35A similar reasoning is used to treat the time derivative of vi, w, and bi in the derivation of the
BTE’s moments of order larger than zero (Sect. 19.4.6).

larger) thickness of the silicon wafer would not make sense, because the phenomena
taking place in the wafer’s bulk are relatively unimportant. Other distances within an
integrated circuit are larger by orders of magnitude than the value of d considered in
the estimate; for instance, the diameter of the integrated circuit itself is of the order
of 102 m, hence the quasi-static approximation is not applicable to the case of two
devices placed, e.g., at opposite corners of a chip and connected by a line. In fact,
the propagation of signals along the lines connecting different devices on a chip is
modeled using the whole set of Maxwell equations.36

As outlined in Chap. 24, insulating layers play an essential role in the fabrication
of integrated circuits; it is then necessary to extend the model to incorporate also
the description of such layers. This is easily accomplished by observing that mobile
charges are absent in an insulator, so that the balance equations for the number of
particles and the transport equations reduce to identities, 0 D 0. The model for the
insulators then reduces to Poisson’s equation only. The right-hand side of the latter
does not necessarily vanish because, as indicated in Sect. 24.1, contaminants may
enter the insulator during the fabrication steps; some of these contaminants may
ionize and act as ﬁxed charges so that, letting Nox be their density, the model for the
insulator reads37

The set of equations (19.128–19.131) is commonly called semiconductor-device
model. It is made of partial-differential equations of the ﬁrst order, in the
unknowns ', n, p and D, Jn, Jp. The coefﬁcients are n, p, Dn D .kB T=q/ n,
36The progressive device scaling from one generation to the next is in general associated with
an increase in the size of the chips. Due to this, the constraints on the circuit’s speed are rather
imposed by the lines connecting the devices than by the devices themselves.
37The insulator’s permittivity is indicated with "ox because, in the examples used later, silicon
dioxide (SiO2) is used as the reference insulator.

Dp D .kB T=q/ p. In turn, N, Wn, Wp are either known functions or are expressed in
terms of the unknowns themselves. Some of the equations are nonlinear because the
unknowns are multiplied by each other. Each equation on the left in (19.128–19.131)
contains the divergence of a vector; in turn, the expression of the vector is given by
the corresponding equation on the right, in terms of the scalar unknowns (in fact
it is E D grad'). It follows that by introducing the expressions of D, Jn, and Jp
into the divergence operator, each pair of ﬁrst-order equation is transformed into a
single, second-order equation. This observation is useful in view of the application
of numerical methods to the solution of the semiconductor-device model.
Remembering the derivation of the transport model, the terms Wn, Wp
in (19.129), (19.130) are due to the generation-recombination phenomena.
Speciﬁcally, Wn is the difference between the number of electrons entering the
conduction band, and of those leaving it, per unit volume and time; in turn, Wp
is the difference between the number of holes entering the valence band, and of
those leaving it, per unit volume and time.38 For this reason, they are also called
net generation rates. As mentioned in Sect. 19.3, the transitions of a given class are
further grouped depending on the entity with which the particle’s collision occurs.
As far as the net generation rates are concerned, it is customary to separate the
contribution of the phonon collisions from those of the other types (e.g., electron-
electron collisions, electron-photon collisions, and so on); in fact, unless the device
is kept at a very low temperature, the phonon collisions are the most important ones.
Thus, the net generation rates are recast as
Wn D Gn  Un ;
Wp D Gp  Up ;
(19.132)
where Un, Up describe the transitions due to phonon collisions, while Gn, Gp
describe those of the other types. The minus signs in (19.132) come from the fact
that Un is deﬁned as the difference between the number of electrons leaving the
conduction band, and of those entering it, because of phonon collisions, per unit
volume and time; similarly, Up is deﬁned as the difference between the number
of holes leaving the valence band, and of those entering it, because of phonon
collisions, per unit volume and time. The terms used for Un, Up are net thermal
recombination rates, those for Gn, Gp are net nonthermal generation rates.
Another comment about the semiconductor-device model concerns the drift
terms in (19.129), (19.130). The latter can be recast as Jdr

19.5.6
Boundary Conditions
In practical applications, the equations of the semiconductor-device model, (19.128)
through (19.131), are solved over a closed domain whose boundary39 is indicated
here with . The boundary is partitioned into portions, some of which, indicated
with i1; i2; : : :, are insulating boundaries, namely, they cannot be crossed by
electrons or holes; the remaining portions, c1; c2; : : :, can be crossed by the
carriers and are termed conducting boundaries.
Considering that the domain over which the equations are solved is in general a
part of a much larger domain enclosing an integrated circuit, some ﬂexibility exists
as for the choice of . Thanks to this, it is possible to select i1; i2; : : : such that
the normal component of the vector unknowns vanishes there; in other terms, letting
s be the unit vector normal to an insulating boundary at some point r, it is
E  s D 0 ;
@'
@s D 0 ;
r 2 i1; i2; : : : :
(19.135)
where @=@s indicates the derivative normal to the boundary at r. An example of how
this can be accomplished is given in Figs. 19.3 and 19.4, representing the schematic
cross-section of a MOSFET. In Fig. 19.3 only the conducting boundaries are shown,
with VS, VG, and VD indicating the voltage applied to the source, gate, and drain
contact, respectively. The bulk contact is grounded, as shown by the line below;
such a contact is the ground reference for the whole chip and, for this reason,
extends laterally beyond the region occupied by the MOSFET under consideration.
The insulating boundaries must now be selected in order to form a closed line that
completes the boundary ; in principle, such a completion may be accomplished
in different ways. Consider, however, the completion shown in the upper part of
Fig. 19.4: as in general it is VS ¤ VG, it is likely that one of the ﬁeld lines in the
region between the source and gate contacts coincides with the segment ab. As a
39A two- or three-dimensional case is considered. In the one-dimensional case the boundary
reduces to the two points enclosing the segments over which the equations are to be solved.

consequence, choosing ab as the insulating boundary in that region guarantees that
the component of E normal to such a boundary is zero, thus achieving the condition
sought. The same reasoning applies to line cd. By this procedure one succeeds in
prescribing the boundary conditions for the Poisson equation along the insulating
boundaries. If, instead, the insulating boundaries were placed differently, like, e.g.,
in the lower part of Fig. 19.4, the component of E normal to the boundary would be
different from zero; besides that, it would be impossible to determine it a priori, and
Poisson’s equation would become ill-posed.
Once the insulating boundaries are completed, the same condition as (19.135) is
prescribed onto the current densities, namely, Jn  s D Jp  s D 0 whence, using the

i.e., a boundary condition of the homogeneous Neumann type.
The conducting boundaries c1; c2; : : : are typically covered with metal layers or
heavily doped polycrystalline layers that provide the electric contacts to the device.
Unless the operating condition of the device departs strongly from equilibrium, a
contact is able to supply the amount of charge necessary to keep the equilibrium
and charge-neutrality conditions in the semiconductor layer adjacent to it. Thus at

each point r of this layer one takes % D 0 or, more speciﬁcally,
%c D q .pc  nc C Nc/ D 0 ;
r 2 c1; c2; : : : ;
(19.138)
where index c indicates the conducting boundary. In most cases the metal or
polycrystalline layer is connected to a voltage generator, so that the electric potential
is prescribed, or to another part of the integrated circuit, so that the electric potential
can be determined from a separate calculation. In these cases, the electric potential
of the contact is known. From it, one derives the electric potential 'c of the
conducting boundary adjacent to the contact; in fact, when the departure from the
equilibrium condition is not too strong, the difference between the electric potential
of the conducting boundary and that of the contact does not depend on the current
density that crosses the boundary, and equals the contact’s work function.40 The
latter is experimentally known, thus yielding 'c. In conclusion, at a conducting
boundary where the voltage is prescribed, the boundary condition is the same for
all scalar unknowns: ' D 'c, n D nc, p D pc, r 2 c1; c2; : : :, i.e., a boundary
condition of the Dirichlet type. Note that the quantities in parenthesis in (19.138)
depend on 'c (compare with (18.56) and (18.57)); as a consequence, they can be
calculated only after the electric potential has been determined.
In some instances a current generator is connected to a contact; as a consequence,
the voltage is not prescribed at the corresponding conducting boundary. However,
such a voltage can be determined by observing that the ﬂux of the current density
across the boundary equals the generator’s current. This provides the extra relation
that keeps the well-posedness of the mathematical problem.41
19.5.7
Quasi-Fermi Potentials
The drift-diffusion transport equations, given by the second relation in (19.129),

40Examples of application of this concept are given in Sects. 21.2.2 and 22.2.
41This outcome becomes immediately clear by applying a numerical-discretization method to the
problem. In fact, the component of the current density normal to the contact depends on the electric
potential of the contact itself; thus, the extra relation provided by the ﬂux-conservation equation
embeds the extra unknown 'c.

In the equilibrium limit, (19.140) must coincide with (18.62), namely, 'n !
'F, 'p
! 'F. It follows that the auxiliary functions (19.139) are a formal
generalization of the concept of Fermi potential; they have the advantage of keeping
the exponential form of the expressions of n and p in the nonequilibrium case.
For this reason, 'n and 'p are called Quasi-Fermi potentials for electrons and
holes, respectively.42 From (19.140) one ﬁnds .kB T=q/ gradn D n grad.'  'n/
and .kB T=q/ gradp D p grad.'p  '/ which, replaced into the second relation

(19.142)
One notes that the monomial forms (19.142), (19.142) thus achieved are similar
to drift-diffusion equations where the drift term only is present. This result allows
one to interpret grad'n and grad'p as effective ﬁelds acting on the electrons (or,
respectively, holes) and incorporating both drift and diffusion effects. The monomial
form is useful for describing unipolar devices, where one of the current densities Jn,
Jp dominates over the other and is essentially solenoidal (Sect. 22.8).
The deﬁnition of the quasi-Fermi potential given above is applicable only to
drift-diffusion equations of the form (19.129), (19.130), that are valid within the
approximations of parabolic band and nondegenerate conditions. However, the
concept of quasi-Fermi potential can be generalized by disposing, e.g., of the
nondegeneracy hypothesis. For this, one starts from the equilibrium expressions of n
and p, given by (18.56) and (18.57), respectively, and replaces EF in the deﬁnitions
of e, h with EF D EFiq 'F (compare with (18.26)); then, the Fermi potential 'F is
replaced with 'n in the deﬁnition of e, and with 'p in that of h. The nonequilibrium

Poisson Equation in a Semiconductor
In the equilibrium condition the concentrations of electrons (19.143) and
holes (19.144) depend on the electric potential only. In turn, the ionized donor and
acceptor concentrations depend on the electric potential and, possibly, on position
if the dopant distributions are position dependent. In summary, the general form
of the equilibrium charge concentration is % D %.'; r/. The semiconductor-device
model reduces to the Poisson equation alone because at equilibrium it is @=@t D 0,

a semi-linear partial differential equation (PDE).43 If the explicit dependence on r

to the nonequilibrium case if it happens that the electric potential depends on one
independent variable, say, x, while the Poisson equation contains terms that depend
also on independent variables different from x. In fact, the other variables can be
considered as parameters during the integration with respect to x. An example of
this case is given in Sect. 22.11.1.
43A PDE of order s in the unknown ' is called quasi-linear if it is linear in the order-s derivatives
of ' and its coefﬁcients depend on the independent variables and the derivatives of ' of order
m < s. A quasi-linear PDE where the coefﬁcients of the order-s derivatives are functions of the
independent variables alone is called semi-linear. A PDE which is linear in the unknown function
and all its derivatives, with coefﬁcients depending on the independent variables alone, is called
linear. PDEs not belonging to the classes above are fully nonlinear.

Comments on the Equivalent Hamiltonian Operator
It has been observed in Sect. 19.2.2 that in the description of the wave-packet
dynamics based on the equivalent Hamiltonian operator and crystal momentum, that
the time variations of the latter are due to the external force only; as a consequence,
if U D const one has „ Pk0 D 0, namely, the crystal momentum is a constant of
motion. The periodic part of the potential energy is incorporated with the kinetic part
to form an equivalent operator. Thus, the expression of the Hamiltonian operator
is eventually made of two terms, the equivalent-kinetic part, where the space
coordinates do not explicitly appear, and the potential part due to the external force
only; from this standpoint it is similar to that of a particle in vacuo.
The same results were found in the analysis of the motion of a classical particle
subjected to a periodic potential onto which a weak perturbation is superimposed
(Sect. 3.11). The classical investigation makes it clear that the crystal momentum
is in fact different from the actual momentum of the particle; also, the subsequent
elaboration carried out in Sect. 3.12 shows that the concept of effective mass is not
distinctive of Quantum Mechanics.
19.6.2
Special Cases of Anisotropy
It is interesting to note that for an anisotropic branch the acceleration Pu may still be
parallel to F; this happens when the force is parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
Taking by way of example a force parallel to the ﬁrst coordinate axis, F D F i1, it
follows in fact
Pu1g D F=m1a ;
Pu2g D 0 ;
Pu3g D 0 :
(19.148)
This seems to imply that a suitable choice of the reference is sufﬁcient to make the
acceleration parallel to the force. However, this is not so: as noted in Sect. 17.6.2,
for (19.24) to hold, the reference in the k space must be chosen in such a way as to
make the Hessian matrix of En.k/ diagonal; this, in turn, ﬁxes the reference in the
r space, because the two references are reciprocal to each other. As a consequence,
if one rotates the r reference to align one of its axes with the force, the k reference
rotates as well; as the mass tensor in the new reference is not necessarily diagonal,
the anisotropy present in the old reference is maintained.

˛-Moment at Equilibrium
The derivation of the moment with respect to ˛ of the BTE has been shown
in Sect. 19.4.5, leading to (19.62). In the equilibrium condition the distribution
function f eq is independent of t and depends on k through the Hamiltonian function
H only; since the latter is even with respect to k, the distribution function is
even as well. In turn, as the transitions balance each other, the right-hand side
of (19.62) vanishes. The term with the magnetic induction vanishes as well (compare
with (19.60)); in conclusion, in the equilibrium condition (19.62) reduces to

(19.149)
It is easily found that (19.149) yields the identity 0 D 0 if ˛ is even with respect to k.
This, on the contrary, is not true when ˛ is odd; in this case the equilibrium condition
consists in the balance between the diffusion term, due to the spatial nonuniformity
of .n ˛ u/eq, and the second term, proportional to the carrier concentration and
linearly dependent on the electric ﬁeld.

diffusion model. At equilibrium one can replace c with u; then, out of the three
components of u, only that of index i contributes to the integral, because those of
index j ¤ i make the integrand odd with respect to both ki and kj. In other terms,
the integrand in (19.157) is replaced with Ee u2

Matthiessen’s Rule
The effects of the inter-band and intra-band transitions have been separated in
Sect. 19.3.2 under the assumption that the two types are uncorrelated. The separation
may further be pursued within each class, depending on the entity with which the
collision occurs. Here the collisions leading to the intra-band transitions only are
considered. With reference to (19.45), and assuming that the intra-band transitions
are uncorrelated, one lets S0v D S.1/

As shown in Sect. 19.5.2, the electron and hole mobilities are expressed by relations
of the form  D q p=m, where p is the momentum-relaxation time and m
an effective mass. To the purpose of estimating the order of magnitude it is not

Onsager Relations
A method widely used in Classical Mechanics to treat transport problems is based
on a simpliﬁed form of (19.48), which is illustrated below. To avoid a change in
notation, the method will be described as if it were applied to the conduction band of
a semiconductor. To this purpose, consider the equilibrium statistics for the electrons
of the conduction band in a uniform case, given by (18.54) with ' D 0, and recast
the numerator of the exponent as E  EF D Ee C EC  EF, with Ee D E.k/  EC the
kinetic energy of the electrons (compare with (19.24)). Taking the nondegenerate
form of (18.54), the equilibrium distribution function f eq D Q P becomes f eq D
f0 expŒEe.k/=.kB T/. The simpliﬁed form of (19.48) is obtained, ﬁrst, by letting
B D 0 and considering the steady-state case; then, the distribution function acted
upon by the Liouvillian operator is replaced with fa D f0 expŒEe.k/=.kB Ta/, with
Ta.r/ a function to be determined. The transport equation (19.48) then becomes
f D f eq   L fa; observing that

Note that the coefﬁcient of the second term at the right-hand side of (19.168) is
identical to the coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of (19.169); this
identity is also called Onsager relation. Similar relations hold for the next moments;
in fact, the moment of order ﬁve is obtained by integrating (19.167) over k after
multiplying it by E2
e ui, and so on.
The above ﬁnding holds irrespective of the dependence of  on k because it is
essentially based on the form of fa. On the other hand, the analysis of the coefﬁcients
of (19.168) and (19.169) is greatly simpliﬁed when the dependence is of the form
 D .Ee/; thanks to spherical symmetry one can in fact follow the same reasoning

Second, one turns to spherical coordinates and integrates over the angles, thus
yielding a factor 4 . Third, one lets  D Ee=.kB Ta/; the integrand thus becomes

The approach depicted in this section prescribes a form of the distribution
function and, for this reason, is less general than the hydrodynamic model illustrated
in section 19.5.1. It is interesting to check whether the Onsager relation is found
also in the hydrodynamic equations describing the particle and energy ﬂux, namely,
the second of (19.90) and (19.92). Apparently, the Onsager relation is not fulﬁlled
because b ¤ p; however, it can be shown that when the perturbation with respect
to equilibrium is small it is b ! p [132]. Thus, the Onsager relation can also be
deduced from the limiting case of the hydrodynamic model.
49These deﬁnitions hold also in the general case where the form of  has no special symmetry. In
this case, however, all coefﬁcients of (19.168) and (19.169) are tensors.

A Resumé of the Transport Model’s Derivation
The number of steps that lead to the hydrodynamic or drift-diffusion model for
semiconductors is quite large; thus, a brief summary is of use. The starting point
is the single-particle Schrödinger equation for an electron in a crystal. To reach
this stage of the theory a considerable amount of work has already been spent,
necessary to reduce the many-particle problem to a tractable form (Chap. 16). When
the external forces are absent, the single-particle equation is recast in a form based
on the equivalent Hamiltonian operator, that exploits the periodicity of the lattice
(this implies in turn that the nuclei are kept ﬁxed in the equilibrium positions).
Finally, the external forces are added, assuming that the external potential energy
is a small perturbation; thanks to this hypothesis, it is possible to describe the
collisionless motion of a single electron by means of a Hamiltonian function whose
canonical variables are the expectation values of the wave packet’s position and
momentum (Sects. 19.2.1 and 19.2.2).
Basing on the Hamiltonian function thus found, the analysis shifts from the
description of the single-particle to the statistical treatment of a system made
of a large number of electrons, following the same pattern as in the classical
case; this leads to the semiclassical BTE (Sect. 19.3), for which the general form
of the collision term is worked out (Sect. 19.3.1). The latter is simpliﬁed, ﬁrst,
by considering point-like collisions, then by taking the perturbative form of the
collision operator (Sects. 19.3.2 and 19.3.3).
The perturbative form of the BTE is treated with the moments method, that
provides a hierarchical set of models, e.g., the drift-diffusion and the hydrodynamic
model. Important approximations at this stage are, for all moments of order larger
than zero, the neglect of the inter-band transitions, of the time derivatives, and of
the convective terms. The models reach the ﬁnal form thanks to the hypothesis of
parabolic bands and the approximation of the relaxation-time tensors with scalar
quantities.

Introduction
This chapter illustrates the main contributions to the transitions of the inter-band
type, that give rise to the generation-recombination terms in the continuity equations
for electrons and holes, and to those of the intra-band type, that give rise to
the electron and hole mobilities in the current-density equations. The inter-band
transitions that are considered are the net thermal recombinations (of the direct
and trap-assisted type), Auger recombinations, impact-ionization generations, and
net-optical recombinations. The model for each type of event is ﬁrst given as a
closed-form function of the semiconductor-device model’s unknowns, like carrier
concentrations, electric ﬁeld, or current densities. Such functions contain a number
of coefﬁcients, whose derivation is successively worked out in the complements by
means of a microscopic analysis. The case of semiconductors having a distribution
of traps within the gap, like, e.g., polycrystalline silicon, is treated as well. Some
discussion is devoted to the optical-generation and recombination events to show
how the concepts of semiconductor laser, solar cell, and optical sensor may be
derived as particular cases of nonequilibrium interaction between the material and
an electromagnetic ﬁeld. The intra-band transitions are treated in a similar manner:
two examples, the collisions with acoustic phonons and ionized impurities, are
worked out in some detail; the illustration then follows of how the contributions
from different scattering mechanisms are combined together in the macroscopic
mobility models. The material is supplemented with a brief discussion about
advanced modeling methods.

Net Thermal Recombinations
As anticipated in Sect. 19.5.5, it is customary to separate the net generation rates
Wn, Wp into two contributions, namely, those deriving from the phonon collisions
and those of the other types (e.g., electron-electron collisions, electron-photon
collisions, and so on). The separate contributions are deﬁned in (19.132); this section
deals with the net thermal recombination rates Un, Up.
In the calculations carried out below, the nonequilibrium carrier concentrations
are derived by integrating over the bands’ energy. This is consistent with the general
deﬁnitions (19.31) and (19.109). In fact, considering the nonequilibrium electron
concentration n as deﬁned in (19.31), one introduces the variable transformation
illustrated in Sect. B.5 and replaces the quantities appearing in it as follows:

the combined density of states in energy and r space, while ˚.r; k; t/, P.r; E; t/ are
the nonequilibrium occupation probabilities in the phase space and, respectively, in
energy; the integration in energy is carried out over the range corresponding to the
conduction band’s branch. The hole concentration is treated in the same manner. In

Direct Thermal Recombinations
To begin, a graphic example of thermal transitions is shown in Fig. 20.1, where the
edges of the conduction and valence bands are indicated with the same symbols
used in Sect. 18.2; the transition marked with a is a recombination event, in which
an electron belonging to an energy state of the conduction band transfers to an
empty state of the valence band. The energy difference between the initial and
ﬁnal state is released to the lattice in the form of a phonon. The opposite transition,
where the electron’s energy increases due to phonon absorption, is an electron-hole
generation and is marked with b in the ﬁgure. The transitions of type a and b are

called direct thermal recombination and direct thermal generation, respectively. Let

the difference ra  rb provides the contribution to the net thermal recombination
rate Un due to the direct thermal transitions. When the valence band is considered
instead, the rates of electrons transitions reverse; however, for the valence band the
transitions of holes must be considered: as consequence, the contribution to Up is
again ra  rb. In conclusion,

(20.5)
where D stands for “direct” and T for “thermal.” The expressions of ra, rb are
determined by a reasoning similar to that used in Sect. 19.3.1 to express the collision
term of the BTE; here, however, the analysis is carried out directly in the energy
space instead of the k space.1 Let P.r; E; t/ be the occupation probability of a state
at energy E; then, let C be the probability per unit time and volume (in r) of an
electron transition from a state of energy E to a state of energy E0 belonging to
a different band, induced by the interaction with a phonon.2 Such a probability
depends on the phonon energy „ ! (Sect. 12.5), and also on the position in r if the
semiconductor is nonuniform. Typically, the equilibrium distribution is assumed for
the phonons, which makes C independent of time; as the collisions are point-like

impurities.

C D C.r; „ !; E ! E0/.
Indicating with g.E/ the density of states of the band where the initial state
belongs, the product g dE P is the number of electrons within the elementary
interval dE around the initial state; such a product is multiplied by C to ﬁnd the
number of unconditional E ! E0 transitions per unit time and volume. On the other
hand, the transitions take place only if the ﬁnal states around E0 are empty; as the
empty states in that interval are g0 dE0 .1  P0/, the number of actual transitions per
unit time and volume from dE to dE0 turns out to be g dE P C g0 dE0 .1  P0/. Now,
to calculate the ra or rb rate it is necessary to add up all transitions: for ra one lets E
range over the conduction band and E0 over the valence band; the converse is done
for rb. As the calculation of the latter is somewhat easier, it is shown ﬁrst:

is due to the so-called trap-assisted transitions. As mentioned in Sect. 19.3, among
the possible collisions undergone by electrons or holes are those with lattice defects.
The latter may originate from lattice irregularities (e.g., dislocations of the material’s
atoms occurring during the fabrication process, Sect. 24.1), or from impurities
that were not eliminated during the semiconductor’s puriﬁcation process, or were
inadvertently added during a fabrication step. Some defects may introduce energy
states localized in the gap; such states, called traps, may capture an electron from
the conduction band and release it towards the valence band, or vice versa. The
phenomena are illustrated in Fig. 20.2, where four traps located in the energy gap
are shown in order to distinguish among the different transition events, that are: a)
capture of a conduction-band electron by a trap, b) release of a trapped electron
towards the conduction band, c) release of a trapped electron towards the valence
band (more suitably described as the capture of a valence-band hole by the trap),

and d) capture of a valence-band electron from the valence band (more suitably
described as the release of a hole towards the valence band). Each transition is
accompanied by the absorption or emission of a phonon. Thus, transitions of type
a and b contribute to the net thermal recombination Un of the conduction band,
while those of type c and d contribute to the net thermal recombination Up of the
valence band. Also, a sequence of two transitions, one of type a involving a given
trap, followed by one of type c involving the same trap, produces an electron-
hole recombination and is therefore called trap-assisted thermal recombination;
similarly, a sequence of two transitions, one of type d involving a given trap,
followed by one of type b involving the same trap, produces an electron-hole
generation and is therefore called trap-assisted thermal generation.
To calculate the contribution of the trap-assisted transitions to Un and Up
it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of traps: those of donor type,
that are electrically neutral when the electron is present in the trap and become
positively charged when the electron is released, and those of acceptor type, that are
electrically neutral when the electron is absent from the trap and become negatively
charged when the electron is captured. In this respect, the traps are similar to the
dopants’ atoms. Instead, a strong difference is made by the position of the traps’
energy within the gap. Consider, for instance, traps localized near the gap’s midpoint
(the latter is indicated by the intrinsic Fermi level EFi in Fig. 20.2); the phonon
energy necessary for the transition is about EG=2 in all cases, to be compared with
the value EG necessary for a direct transition. On the other hand, the equilibrium-
phonon distribution (Sect. 16.6) is the Bose-Einstein statistics (15.55); it follows that
the number dNph of phonons in the interval d! is
dNph D
gph.!/ d!
expŒ„ !=.kB T/  1 ;
(20.12)
with „ ! the energy and gph the density of states of the phonons. Due to (20.12),
dNph=d! rapidly decreases as the phonon energy increases, thus making the
probability of an electron-phonon interaction much larger at lower energies. For
this reason, even in an electronic-grade semiconductor, where the concentration of
defects is very small (Sect. 19.3.2), the traps are able to act as a sort of “preferred
path” in energy for the inter-band transitions, to the extent that the contribution
to Un, Up of the trap-assisted transitions is largely dominant over that of the
direct transitions. Therefore, in the continuity equations (20.13) below, and in the
subsequent derivation of the trap-assisted, thermal-transition rates, symbols Un, Up
refer only to the latter transitions, not any more to the sum of the trap-assisted and
direct ones.
The net thermal-recombination terms Un, Up appear in (19.129) and (19.130)
after replacing Wn, Wp with (19.132); this yields

(20.13)

20.2

To introduce the trap-assisted transitions one formally duplicates (20.13) as if the
acceptor and donor traps formed two additional bands; as the acceptor traps are
either neutral or negatively charged, the charge and current densities of the band
associated with them are thought of as due to electrons; instead, the charge and
current densities of the band associated with the donor traps are thought of as due
to holes. In summary, the two additional equations read
@nA
@t C UnA  1
q divJnA D GnA ;
@pD
@t C UpD C 1
q divJpD D GpD ;
(20.14)
with a and d standing for “acceptor” and “donor,” respectively. To ease the
calculation it is assumed that the nonthermal phenomena are absent, whence Gn D
Gp D GnA D GpD D 0. Combining (20.13) with (20.14) and observing that
J D Jp C JpD C Jn C JnA is the total current density of the semiconductor yield
@Œq .p C pD  n  nA/
@t
C divJ D q .Un C UnA/  q .Up C UpD/ :
(20.15)
As the net dopant concentration N is independent of time, it is @Œq .p C pD  n 
nA/=@t D @Œq .pCpD nnA CN/=@t D @%=@t; thus, the left-hand side of (20.15)
vanishes due to (4.23), and3
Un C UnA D Up C UpD :
(20.16)
The two continuity equations (20.14) are now simpliﬁed by observing that in
crystalline semiconductors the current densities JpD, JnA of the traps are negligible.
In fact, the trap concentration is so low that inter-trap tunneling is precluded by
the large distance from a trap to another; the reasoning is the same as that used in
Sect. 18.7.2 with respect to the impurity levels.4 Letting JpD D JnA D 0 makes the
two equations (20.14) local:
@nA
@t D UnA ;
@pD
@t D UpD :
(20.17)
In steady-state conditions the traps’ populations are constant, thus yielding
UnA D UpD D 0 and, from (20.16), Un D Up. In equilibrium all continuity
equations reduce to the identity 0 D 0, whence the net-recombination terms vanish
independently, Ueq
n D Ueq
nA D Ueq
p D Ueq
pD D 0.
3The result expressed by (20.16) is intuitive if one thinks that adding up all continuity equations
amounts to counting all transitions twice, the ﬁrst time in the forward direction (e.g., using the
electrons), the second time in the backward direction (using the holes). The reasoning is similar to
that leading to the vanishing of the intra-band contribution in (19.63).
4In a polycrystalline semiconductor with a large spatial concentration of traps it may happen
that the traps’ current densities are not negligible; in fact, the whole system of equations (20.13)
and (20.14) must be used to correctly model the material [26–28]. The conduction phenomenon
associated with these current densities is called gap conduction.

Shockley-Read-Hall Theory
The Shockley-Read-Hall theory describes the trap-assisted, net thermal-recomb-
ination term in a crystalline semiconductor based upon the steady-state relation
Un D Up. In fact, the outcome of the theory is used also in dynamic conditions;
this approximation is acceptable because, due to the smallness of the traps’
concentration, the contribution of the charge density stored within the traps is
negligible with respect to that of the band and dopant states; the contribution of
the time variation of the traps’ charge density is similarly negligible. The theory
also assumes that only one trap level is present, of energy Et; with reference to
Fig. 20.2, the trap levels must be thought of as being aligned with each other. If
more than one trap level is present, the contributions of the individual levels are
summed up at a later stage. In the theory it is not important to distinguish between
acceptor-type or donor-type traps; however, one must account for the fact that a trap
can accommodate one electron at most.
Still with reference to Fig. 20.2, let ra be the number of type-a transitions per
unit volume and time, and similarly for rb, rc, rd. The derivation of these rates is
similar to that of the direct transitions and is shown in the complements; here the
expressions of the net thermal-recombination terms are given, that read
Un D ra  rb D ˛n n Nt .1  Pt/  en Nt Pt ;
(20.18)
Up D rc  rd D ˛p p Nt Pt  ep Nt .1  Pt/ ;
(20.19)
where Nt is the concentration of traps of energy Et, Pt the trap-occupation
probability, ˛n, ˛p the electron- and hole-transition coefﬁcients, respectively, and
en, ep the electron- and hole-emission coefﬁcients, respectively.5 The ratios en=˛n,
ep=˛p are assumed to vary little from the equilibrium to the nonequilibrium case.

(20.24)
In this way one expresses the trap-occupation probability as a function of two of
the unknowns of the semiconductor-device model, namely, n and p, and of a few
parameters. Among the latter, nB and pB are known (given the trap’s energy) because
they are calculated in the equilibrium condition. In conclusion, replacing (20.24)
into (20.18) or (20.19) yields, for the common value USRH D Un D Up,
USRH D

(20.25)
where the indices stand for “Shockley-Read-Hall.” Eventually, the only unknown
parameters turn out to be the products Nt ˛p and Nt ˛n which, as shown in Sect. 25.2,
can be obtained from measurements.
The expression obtained so far, (20.25), has been derived considering a single
trap level Et. Before adding up over the levels it is convenient to consider how
sensitive USRH is to variations of Et; in fact, one notes that the numerator of (20.25)
is independent of Et, whereas the denominator D has the form

The denominator has a minimum where  D 0; thus, USRH has a maximum there.
Moreover, the maximum is rather sharp due to the form of the hyperbolic cosine.
It follows that the trap level EtM that most efﬁciently induces the trap-assisted
transitions is found by letting  D 0. The other trap levels have a much smaller
efﬁciency and can be neglected; in conclusion, it is not necessary to add up over the
trap levels.6 With this provision, one ﬁnds

Limiting Cases of the Shockley-Read-Hall Theory
The operating conditions of semiconductor devices are often such that the SRH
recombination function (20.32) can be reduced to simpler forms. The ﬁrst case is
the so-called full-depletion condition, where both electron and hole concentrations
are negligibly small with respect to nB and pB. Remembering that neq peq D nB pB

In a nondegenerate condition nB, pB take the simpliﬁed form (20.33), whence
p
nB=pB D ni and g D p0=dt C n0 dt. In a full-depletion condition USRH is
always negative, namely, generations prevail over recombinations; for this reason,
g is called generation lifetime.
The second limiting case of interest is the so-called weak-injection condition.
This condition occurs when both inequalities below are fulﬁlled:
jn  neqj  ceq ;
jp  peqj  ceq ;
(20.35)
where ceq is the equilibrium concentration of the majority carriers in the spatial
position under consideration. From the above deﬁnition it follows that the concept
of weak injection is applicable only after specifying which carriers are the majority
ones. Expanding the product n p to ﬁrst order in n and p around the equilibrium
value yields n p ' neq peq C neq .p  peq/ C peq .n  neq/. As a consequence, the
numerator of (20.32) becomes
n p  neq peq ' neq .p  peq/ C peq .n  neq/ :
(20.36)
To proceed, it is necessary to distinguish between the n-type and p-type regions.
Weak-Injection Condition, n-Type Semiconductor
The weak-injection condition (20.35) reads jn  neqj  neq, jp  peqj  neq. As a
consequence, one lets n ' neq in the denominator of (20.32) and neglects nB with
respect to neq; in fact, in a nondegenerate condition it is nB ' ni  neq, and the
same inequality is also applicable in a degenerate condition. As the lifetimes are
similar to each other, the term n0 .p C pB/ in the denominator is negligible with
respect to p0 neq, because p is a concentration of minority carriers and pB is similar
to nB. In conclusion, the denominator of (20.32) simpliﬁes to p0 neq, whence

(20.38)
with p the minority-carrier lifetime in an n-doped region.
Weak-Injection Condition, p-Type Semiconductor
The weak-injection condition (20.35) reads jn  neqj  peq, jp  peqj  peq. As a
consequence, one lets p ' peq in the denominator of (20.32) and neglects pB with
respect to peq; the other term in the denominator of (20.35) is neglected as above,
thus simplifying the denominator to n0 peq. In conclusion,
USRH '

The ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of (20.39) is negligible because peq=neq  1;
letting n D n0 ﬁnally yields
USRH ' n  neq
n
;
(20.40)
with n the minority-carrier lifetime in a p-doped region.
The simpliﬁed expressions of USRH found here are particularly useful; in fact,
in contrast to (20.32), the weak-injection limits (20.38) and (20.40) are linear
with respect to p or n. Moreover, as (20.38) and (20.40) depend on one unknown
only, they decouple the continuity equation of the minority carriers (the ﬁrst one
in (19.129) or in (19.130)) from the other equations of the semiconductor’s model;
thanks to this it is possible to separate the system of equations. The simpliﬁcation
introduced by the full-depletion condition is even stronger, because (20.34) is
independent of the model’s unknowns. On the other hand, all simpliﬁcations
illustrated here are applicable only in the regions where the approximations hold;
once the simpliﬁed model’s equations have been solved locally, it is necessary to
match the solutions at the boundaries between adjacent regions.
7Considering for instance the example in Sect. 18.4.1, one has neq ' 1015 cm3, peq ' 105 cm3,
whence neq=peq ' 1010.

Thermal Recombination with Tail and Deep States
In recent years, thin-ﬁlm transistors made of amorphous silicon (˛-Si:H TFTs) or
polycrystalline silicon (poly-TFTs) have acquired great importance in microelec-
tronics; in fact, they can be fabricated with a low thermal budget and on large-area
substrates and, at the same time, they are able to achieve performances adequate
for the realization of complex circuits. Typical applications are in the area of solid-
state image sensors, active-matrix liquid-crystal displays, charge-coupled devices,
and static random-access memories. These materials are characterized by a large
amount of defects, giving rise to localized states with a complex energy distribution
within the gap; typically, the concentration of the acceptor-like states is larger in the
upper half of the gap, while that of the donor-like states is larger in the lower half of
the gap.
Traps in amorphous silicon are due to the irregular distribution of atoms and
to defects in the material; the lack of long-range order in the atomic structure
produces a distribution of localized states with energies near the conduction- and
valence-band edges (tail states); in turn, the defects give rise to a distribution of
states localized near midgap (deep states). As for the spatial localization, traps in
amorphous silicon are uniformly distributed in the semiconductor’s volume, while
defects in polycrystalline silicon are located at the grain boundaries; for the latter
material a simplifying hypothesis is used, that consists in describing the traps as
uniformly distributed over the volume [51]. Given these premises, for both materials
the energy distribution of traps in the gap can be modeled as the superposition
of two distributions of acceptor and donor states; in turn, the densities of states
per unit volume, D and A, for each group of donor- and acceptor-like states is
approximated as the sum of two exponential functions, describing the deep and tail
states, respectively [25, 103, 137]:

distinguishing between bands and gap seems meaningless; the distinction, however,
is kept as long as the gap states, although dense in energy, are still much less
dense in space than those of the bands, so that the contribution of the gap states to
current transport is negligible (in other terms, the mobility of the carriers belonging
to the gap states is much smaller than that of the band carriers). This condition
is assumed here; thus, proceeding in the same manner as in Sect. 20.2.3 yields

the steady-state form of (20.54) generalizes the ﬁrst expression in (20.24). In
conclusion, the continuity equations for a semiconductor having a distribution
of traps within the gap, neglecting gap conduction, are (20.13) and (20.54),
supplemented with the deﬁnitions (20.43), (20.44) of the net recombination rates.

Auger Recombination and Impact Ionization
An important, nonthermal recombination mechanism is Auger recombination. The
phenomenon is due to the electron-electron or hole-hole collision and is illustrated
in Fig. 20.3. With reference to case a, two electrons whose initial state is the
conduction band collide and exchange energy. The outcome of the collision is that
one of the electrons suffers an energy loss equal or larger than the energy gap and

makes a transition to an empty state of the valence band; the other electron absorbs
the same amount of energy and makes a transition to a higher-energy state of the
conduction band. The phenomenon is also indicated as an Auger recombination
initiated by electrons. The analogue for holes is shown in case c of Fig. 20.3:
two holes whose initial state is in the valence band collide and exchange energy.
Remembering that hole energy increases in the opposite direction with respect to
that of electrons (Sect. 19.2.3), the hole that suffers an energy loss equal or larger
than the energy gap makes a transition to a ﬁlled state of the conduction band;
the other hole absorbs the same amount of energy and makes a transition to a
higher-energy state of the valence band. The phenomenon is indicated as an Auger
recombination initiated by holes.
The phenomenon dual to Auger recombination is illustrated in Fig. 20.4 and is
called impact ionization. With reference to case b, an electron whose initial state is in
the conduction band at high energy collides and exchanges energy with an electron
whose initial state is in the valence band. The initial energy E of the electron in the
conduction band is such that E  EC is equal or larger than the energy gap, whereas
the initial energy of the electron in the valence band is near EV. The outcome of
the collision is that although the high-energy electron suffers an energy loss equal
or larger than the energy gap, its ﬁnal state is still in the conduction band; the
other electron absorbs the same amount of energy and makes a transition to the
conduction band. The phenomenon is in fact an electron-hole pair generation and is
also indicated as an impact-ionization event initiated by electrons. The analogue for
holes is shown in case d of Fig. 20.4: a hole whose initial state is in the valence band
at high energy collides and exchanges energy with a hole whose initial state is in the
conduction band. The initial energy E of the hole in the valence band is such that
jEEVj is equal or larger than the energy gap, whereas the initial energy of the hole
in the conduction band is near EC. The outcome of the collision is that although the
high-energy hole suffers an energy loss equal or larger than the energy gap, its ﬁnal
state is still in the valence band; the other hole absorbs the same amount of energy

cients for the Auger recombination and impact ionization initiated by electrons, and
cp, Ip the analogue for holes; cn, cp are also called Auger coefﬁcients.8 In equilibrium

When the operating condition departs strongly from equilibrium, the simpliﬁcation

be used. Referring to all recombinations as due to transitions of electrons, their
rate is easily found to be ra C rc; similarly, the total generation rate is rb C rd.

For Auger recombination to occur it is necessary that an electron collides with
another electron, or a hole collides with another hole. The probability of such
an event is relatively small because in normal operating conditions and at room
temperature there is a high probability that a carrier collides with a phonon; as
a consequence, for the collisionless motion of an electron to be interrupted by a
collision with another electron it is necessary that the electron concentration be very
high. This situation occurs only in a heavily doped, n-type region; similarly, an
Auger recombination initiated by holes can be signiﬁcant only in a heavily doped,
p-type region.9
Considering now the case of impact-ionization, for this phenomenon to occur it is
necessary that an electron, or a hole, acquires a kinetic energy larger than the energy
gap. This is a rare event as well,10 because in general the carrier undergoes a phonon
collision when its kinetic energy is still signiﬁcantly lower than the energy gap. The
impact-ionization event occurs only if the carrier acquires a substantial energy over
a distance much shorter than the average collisionless path, which happens only in
presence of a strong electric ﬁeld.11
The qualitative reasoning outlined above explains why the conditions for a strong
Auger recombination are incompatible with those that make impact-ionization
dominant; in fact, a large charge density, like that imposed by a heavy dopant
concentration, prevents the electric ﬁeld from becoming strong. Vice versa, a strong
electric ﬁeld prevents a large carrier concentration from building up. It is therefore
sensible to investigate situations where only one term dominates within UAI.
20.3.1
Strong Impact Ionization
As indicated in Sect. 20.3, far from equilibrium the approximations In D cn neq peq,
Ip D cp neq peq are not valid, and the general expressions (20.55) must be used.

recombination mechanisms is considered, using the steady-state case. If impact
ionization is dominant, it is Un  Gn D Up  Gp ' UAI ' In n  Ip p. The
continuity equations (the ﬁrst ones in (19.129) and (19.130)) then become
9In fact, Auger recombination becomes signiﬁcant in the source and drain regions of MOSFETs
and in the emitter regions of BJTs, where the dopant concentration is the highest.
10In principle, high-energy electrons or hole exists also in the equilibrium condition; however, their
number is negligible because of the exponentially vanishing tail of the Fermi-Dirac statistics.
11The high-ﬁeld conditions able to produce a signiﬁcant impact ionization typically occur in the
reverse-biased p-n junctions like, e.g., the drain junction in MOSFETs and the collector junction
in BJTs.

As outlined in Sect. 20.3, impact-ionization dominates if the electric ﬁeld is high.
For this reason, the transport equations in (19.129) and (19.130) are simpliﬁed by
keeping the ohmic term only, to yield Jn ' q n n E and Jp ' q p p E. As a
consequence, the electron and hole current densities are parallel to the electric ﬁeld.

the ﬁrst order, whose solution in the one-dimensional case is relatively simple if the
dependence of the coefﬁcients on position is given (Sect. 21.5).
20.4
Optical Transitions
The description of the optical transitions is similar to that of the direct thermal
transitions given in Sect. 20.2.1; still with reference to Fig. 20.1, the transition
marked with a can be thought of as an optical-recombination event if the energy
difference between the initial and ﬁnal state is released to the environment in
the form of a photon. The opposite transition (b), where the electron’s energy
increases due to photon absorption from the environment, is an optical electron-hole
generation. The expression of the net optical-recombination rate is similar to (20.11)
and reads
UO D ˛O n p  GO ;
(20.61)
whose coefﬁcients are derived in the same manner as those of UDT (Sect. 20.2.1).
In normal operating conditions the similarity between the direct-thermal and
optical generation-recombination events extends also to the external agent that
induces the transitions. In fact, the distribution of the phonon energies is typically
the equilibrium one, given by the Bose-Einstein statistics (15.55) at the lattice tem-
perature; as for the photons, the environment radiation in which the semiconductor
is immersed can also be assimilated to the equilibrium one, again given by the Bose-
Einstein statistics at the same temperature.

Generation-Recombination and Mobility
The conditions of the optical generation-recombination events drastically change
if the device is kept far from equilibrium. Consider for instance the case where
the electron concentration of the conduction band is artiﬁcially increased with
respect to the equilibrium value at the expense of the electron population of the
valence band, so that both n and p in (20.61) increase. This brings about an excess
of recombinations; if the probability of radiative-type generation-recombination
events is high,12 the emission of a large number of photons follows. The angular
frequencies of the emitted photons is close to .EC  EV/=„, because the majority
of the electrons in the conduction band concentrate near EC, and the ﬁnal states of
the radiative transitions concentrate near EV. In this way, the energy spent to keep
the artiﬁcially high concentration of electron-hole pairs is transformed into that of
a nearly monochromatic optical emission. In essence, this is the description of the
operating principle of a laser.13 Another method for keeping the device far from
equilibrium is that of artiﬁcially decreasing both the concentration of electrons of the
conduction band and the concentration of holes of the valence band. The outcome is
opposite with respect to that described earlier: the decrease of both n and p in (20.61)
brings about an excess of generations, which in turn corresponds to the absorption
of photons from the environment. The absorption may be exploited to accumulate
energy (thus leading to the concept of solar cell), or to provide an electrical signal
whose amplitude depends on the number of absorbed photons (thus leading to the
concept of optical sensor).
In a nonequilibrium condition the amount of energy exchanged between the
semiconductor and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not necessarily uniform in space.
Consider, by way of example, the case of an optical sensor on which an external
radiation impinges; as the nonequilibrium conditions are such that the absorption
events prevail, the radiation intensity within the material progressively decreases
at increasing distances from the sensor’s surface. Therefore, it is important to
determine the radiation intensity as a function of position.
It is acceptable to assume that the absorption events are uncorrelated from each
other. Thus, one can limit the analysis to a monochromatic radiation; the effect of
the whole spectrum is recovered at a later stage by adding up over the frequencies.
When absorption prevails, (20.61) simpliﬁes to UO ' GO, where GO is a function
of the radiation’s frequency  and possibly of position. If the radiation’s intensity
varies with time, GO depends on time as well.14 When the radiation interacts with
the external surface of the material, part of the energy is reﬂected; moreover, the
radiation is refracted at the boundary, so that the propagation direction outside the
material differs in general from that inside. Letting  be the propagation direction
inside the material, consider an elementary volume with a side d aligned with 
12As indicated in Sect. 17.6.6, among semiconductors this is typical of the direct-gap ones.
13In fact, LASER is the acronym of Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
14In principle, a time dependence of the intensity is incompatible with the hypothesis that
the radiation is monochromatic. However, the frequency with which the intensity may vary is
extremely small with respect to the optical frequencies.

the optical-generation events per unit time and volume is h  GO. The latter is not
necessarily equal to h  .@˚=@/; in fact, some photons crossing the elementary

Macroscopic Mobility Models
It has been shown in Sect. 19.5.2 that the carrier mobilities are deﬁned in terms of the
momentum-relaxation times. Speciﬁcally, in the parabolic-band approximation it is,
for the electrons of the conduction band, n D .l C 2 t/=3, with l D q p=ml,
t D q p=mt, where p is the electron momentum-relaxation time (19.87); similarly,
for the holes of the valence band the carrier mobility is given by inserting (19.118)
into the second relation of (19.121), namely, a linear combination of the heavy-hole
and light-hole momentum-relaxation times. As, in turn, the inverse momentum-
relaxation time is a suitable average of the inverse intra-band relaxation time,
the Matthiessen rule follows (Sect. 19.6.5); in conclusion, the electron and hole
mobilities are calculated by combining the effects of the different types of collisions
(e.g., phonons, impurities, and so on) suffered by the carrier.16 In the case of
electrons, the application of the Matthiessen rule is straightforward, leading to
16As mentioned in Sect. 19.6.5, it is assumed that the different types of collisions are uncorrelated.

ph ' pl is applicable.
In the typical operating conditions of semiconductor devices the most important
types of collisions are those with phonons and ionized impurities. For devices
like surface-channel MOSFETs, where the ﬂow lines of the current density are
near the interface between semiconductor and gate insulator, a third type is
also very important, namely, the collisions with the interface. The macroscopic
mobility models are closed-form expressions in which mobility is related to a
set of macroscopic parameters (e.g., temperature) and to some of the unknowns
of the semiconductor-device model; the concept is similar to that leading to the
expressions of the generation-recombination terms shown in earlier sections.
20.5.1
Example of Phonon Collision
By way of example, a simpliﬁed analysis of the contribution to mobility of
the electron-phonon collision is outlined below, starting from the deﬁnition of
the ith component of the momentum-relaxation tensor pi given by (19.87); the
simpliﬁcations are such that the ﬁrst-order expansion f  f eq ' .df=d/eq  is not
used here. Starting from the perturbative form (19.47) one considers the steady-
state, uniform case and lets B D 0,  D v, to ﬁnd

components different from ui vanish because the corresponding integrand is odd; as
a consequence, only the ith component of the electric ﬁeld remains, and cancels out.

(20.71)
To proceed it is necessary to make an assumption about v. Remembering the
deﬁnition of the relaxation time given by the ﬁrst relation in (19.43), it is reasonable
to assume that the scattering probability S0 increases with the kinetic energy Ee of
the electron, so that the relaxation time decreases; a somewhat stronger hypothesis
is that the relaxation time depends on Ee only, namely, the collision is isotropic.17
In this case, (20.71) is readily manipulated by a Herring-Vogt transformation.
Following the same procedure as in Sect. 19.6.4, one ﬁnds that all numerical factors
cancel out; as a consequence, one may replace the auxiliary coordinate 2
i with
2=3 D Ee=3, thus showing that pi D p is isotropic as well. One eventually ﬁnds

where “ap” stands for “acoustic phonon.” More elaborate derivations, including also
the contribution of optical phonons, still show that carrier-phonon collisions make
mobility to decrease when temperature increases.
17The ﬁrst-principle derivation of the scattering probabilities is carried out by applying Fermi’s
Golden Rule (Sect. 14.8.3) to each type of perturbation, using the Bloch functions for the
unperturbed states
[73]. Examples are given in Sect. 14.8.6 for the case of the harmonic
perturbation in a periodic structure, and in this chapter (Sect. 20.5.2) for the case of ionized-
impurity scattering.
18Acoustic phonons are those whose momentum and energy belong to the acoustic branch
of the lattice-dispersion relation (Sect. 17.9.5); a similar deﬁnition applies to optical phonons
(Sect. 17.9.6).

Example of Ionized-Impurity Collision
As a second example one considers the collisions with ionized impurities. The
interaction with a single ionized impurity is a perturbation of the Coulomb type;
due to the presence of the crystal, the more suitable approach is the screened
Coulomb perturbation, an example of which is shown in Sect. 14.7, leading to the
perturbation-matrix element (14.34):

In (20.75), e > 0 is the elementary electric charge, Z a positive integer, "0 the
vacuum permittivity, qc > 0 the inverse screening length,19 q D jqj D jk  gj
and, ﬁnally,  D 1 .1/ in the repulsive (attractive) case. The wave vectors k
and g correspond to the initial and ﬁnal state of the transition, respectively. In
principle, (20.75) should not be used as is because it holds in vacuo; in fact, the
eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator used to derive (20.75)
are plane waves. Inside a crystal, instead, one should deﬁne the perturbation
matrix hkg.t/ using the Bloch functions wk D uk exp.i k  r/ in an integral of
the form (14.24). However, it can be shown that the contribution of the periodic
part uk can suitably be averaged and extracted from the integral, in the form of
a dimensionless coefﬁcient, whose square modulus G is called overlap factor.20
For this reason, the collisions with ionized impurities is treated starting from the
deﬁnition (20.75) to calculate the perturbation matrix, with the provision that the
result is to be multiplied by G and the permittivity "sc of the semiconductor replaces
"0 in the second relation of (20.75).
Like in Sect. 14.6, a Gaussian wave packet (14.27) centered on some wave vector
b ¤ g is used as initial condition. In this case the perturbation is independent of
time, hbg D h.0/
bg D const ¤ 0; as a consequence, the inﬁnitesimal probability dPb
that such a perturbation induces a transition, from the initial condition (14.27), to a
ﬁnal state whose energy belongs to the range dEg, is given by (14.32). In turn, the
integral (14.31) providing H.0/
b .Eg/ is calculated in Prob. 14.1. Assuming that the
duration tP of the interaction is large enough to make Fermi’s Golden Rule (14.44)
applicable, and inserting the overlap factor, one ﬁnally obtains

The above expression provides the contribution to the intra-band relaxation time
of the scattering due to a single impurity. One notes that since A is squared, the
effect onto (20.77) of a positive impurity is the same as that of a negative one. If
the effect of each impurity is uncorrelated with that of the others,21 the probabilities
add up; letting NI D NC

A be the total concentration of ionized impurities,
the product NI d3r is the total number of ionized impurities in the elementary

inverse proportionality with NI; letting “ii” indicate “ionized impurity,” one ﬁnds

The derivation of the dependence on NI shown above is in fact oversimpliﬁed,
and the resulting model does not reproduce the experimental results with sufﬁcient
precision. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is that the inverse screening length
qc depends on the dopant concentration as well, as is apparent, for instance, from
the second relation of (20.105). In order to improve the model, while still keeping

or (20.80) stands for “bulk.” More generally, the term bulk mobility is ascribed to
the combination of all contributions to mobility different from surface collisions.
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, in surface-channel devices the
degradation of mobility produced by the interaction of the carriers with the interface
between channel and gate insulator is also very important. The macroscopic models
of this effect are built up by considering that the carrier-surface interaction is more
likely to occur if the ﬂow lines of the current density are closer to the interface
itself; such a closeness is in turn controlled by the intensity of the electric ﬁeld’s
component normal to the interface, E?. In conclusion, the model describes the
contribution to mobility due to surface scattering as a decreasing function of E?,

Beyond Analytical Modeling of Mobility
In general the analytical approaches outlined above do not attain the precision
necessary for applications to realistic devices. For this reason, one must often resort
to numerical-simulation methods; in this way, the main scattering mechanisms are
incorporated into the analysis (e.g., for silicon: acoustic phonons, optical phonons,
ionized impurities, and impact ionization), along with the full-band structure of the
semiconductor, which is included in the simulation through the density of states and
group velocity deﬁned in the energy space. The latter, in turn, are obtained directly
from the corresponding functions in the momentum space by integrating the full-
band system over the angles. The energy range considered to date allows for the
description of carrier dynamics up to 5 eV.
As mentioned above, the ionized-impurity collisions can be treated as interac-
tions between the carrier and a single impurity as long as the impurity concentration
is below some limit. When the limit is exceeded, impurity clustering becomes
relevant and must be accounted for
[80]. In fact, at high doping densities the
carrier scatters with a cluster of K ions, where K is a function of the impurity
concentration. Finally, different outcomes are found for majority- or minority-
mobility calculations: e.g., minority-hole mobility is found to be about a factor 2
higher than the majority-hole mobility for identical doping levels.
Figures 20.7 and 20.8 show the outcome of electron- and hole-mobility calcu-
lations for bulk silicon, obtained from the spherical-harmonics method illustrated
in [140]. The method incorporates the models for the scattering mechanisms listed
above. The electron and hole mobility have been calculated as a function of the total
ionized-dopant concentration NI, using the lattice temperature T as a parameter; in
the ﬁgures, they are compared with measurements taken from the literature.
To include the surface effects in the analysis it is necessary to account for the
fact that in modern devices the thickness of the charge layer at the interface with
the gate insulator is so small that quantum conﬁnement and formation of subbands
must be considered. The typical collisions mechanisms to be accounted for at the
semiconductor–insulator interface are surface roughness, scattering with ionized
impurities trapped at the interface, and surface phonons. Figures 20.9 and 20.10
show the outcome of electron and hole surface-mobility calculations in silicon,

Transition Rates in the SRH Recombination Function
The expressions of the transition rates ra, rb, rc, rd to be used in the calculation of
the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination function (20.32) are determined by the same
reasoning as that used in Sect. 20.2.1 for the direct thermal transitions. Let P.r; E; t/
be the occupation probability of a state at energy E, and C.E ! E0/ the probability
per unit time and volume (in r) of a transition from a ﬁlled state of energy E to an
empty state of energy E0. Such a probability is independent of time; it depends on

deﬁne P0 D P.r; E D E0; t/, Pt D P.r; E D Et; t/, where Et is the energy of the
trap. Finally, let .E/ be the combined density of states in energy and volume of the

if the traps’ distribution is nonuniform). The number of transitions per unit volume

Total Recombination-Generation Rate
The expressions for the most important generation-recombination terms have been
worked out in this chapter. Only one of them, the SRH recombination function
USRH, involves energy states different from those of the conduction and valence
bands; in principle, such states would require additional continuity equations to be
added to the semiconductor-device model. However, as discussed in Sect. 20.2.3,
this is not necessary in crystalline semiconductors. The other mechanisms (direct
thermal recombination-generation UDT, Auger recombination and impact ionization
UAI, and optical recombination-generation UO) do not involve intermediate states.
As a consequence, with reference to (20.13) the generation-recombination terms
of the electron-continuity equation are equal to those of the hole continuity
equation. Finally, assuming that the different generation-recombination phenomena
are uncorrelated and neglecting UDT with respect to USRH (Sect. 20.2.2) yield

Chapter 21
Bipolar Devices
21.1
Introduction
The mathematical model of semiconductor devices, derived in Chap. 19, is applied
here to the description of the fundamental bipolar device, the p-n junction. The term
bipolar indicates that both electrons and holes contribute to the current. The analysis
is carried out using the simple example of a one-dimensional abrupt junction in
steady state, with the hypotheses of nondegeneracy and complete ionization, that
lend themselves to an analytical treatment. The equilibrium condition is considered
ﬁrst, and the solution of Poisson’s equation is tackled, showing that the structure
can be partitioned into space-charge and quasi-neutral regions. Then, the Shockley
theory is illustrated, leading to the derivation of the ideal I.V/ characteristic. The
semiconductor model is then applied to illustrating two features of the reverse-
bias condition, namely, the depletion capacitance and the avalanche due to impact
ionization. Next, the model is used to work out the features of the photodiode,
both in the continuous and storage mode, of the solar cell, and of the bipolar
junction transistor. The complements justify the simpliﬁcation of considering only
the diffusive transport for the minority carriers in a quasi-neutral region, and provide
the derivation of the Shockley boundary conditions. Finally, the expression of the
depletion capacitance is worked out for the case of an arbitrary charge-density
proﬁle. The typical parameters of the p-n junction and of the solar cell are also
illustrated in the complements, along with the single-generator equivalent circuit
for the bipolar junction transistor.

P-N Junction in Equilibrium
A very simple, yet fundamental, semiconductor device is the p-n junction, whose
one-dimensional version is sketched in Fig. 21.1. The device is fabricated by
thermally diffusing (Chap. 23), or ion implanting p-type dopant atoms into an n-
type substrate, or vice versa. As a consequence, the diffused or implanted proﬁle
is not spatially uniform. The substrate proﬁle may in turn result from a similar
process, so that in general it is not uniform either. The locus of points where the
ionized dopant concentrations are equal to each other, NC
D D N
A , is a surface called
metallurgical junction.1 The theory of the p-n junction is carried out with reference
to a simpliﬁed structure, where the device is one dimensional and aligned with the
x axis; in this case the metallurgical junction is a plane normal to x and, as shown
in Fig. 21.1, its position is made to coincide with the reference’s origin. Also, the
nonuniform dopant concentrations NA.x/ and ND.x/ are approximated by piecewise-
constant functions, NA D const for x < 0 and ND D const for x > 0. The device
obtained from this approximation is called abrupt p-n junction. Considering the
actual form of the dopant distribution, the approximation is not realistic; however,
the much simpler model based on it is still able to capture the essential features
of the device characteristics. Moreover, the model assumes that the conditions of
nondegeneracy and complete ionization hold; this assumption makes the analytical
approach possible.
Within an integrated circuit the p-n junction is supplemented with contacts that
connect it to the rest of the circuit. Such contacts are typically made of metals,
metal silicides, or heavily doped polycrystalline semiconductors; as a consequence,
two more junctions are present: the ﬁrst one is between the contact and the p-doped
semiconductor, the other one between the contact and the n-doped semiconductor.
It is implied that the contacts are made of the same material; if it is not so, more
junctions must be considered as shown below.

Built-In Potential
A qualitative description of the device in the equilibrium condition starts from the
assumption that the extension of the p-doped and n-doped regions along the x axis
is large, so that, far away from the junction, the semiconductor can be considered
as uniformly doped of the p or n type, respectively. This ﬁxes the boundary
conditions for the electron and hole concentrations:2 in fact, remembering that in the
nondegeneracy and complete-ionization conditions the equilibrium concentrations
in a uniform semiconductor are given by (18.42) for the p type and by (18.30) for
the n type, one ﬁnds

makes the theory of Sect. 19.5.8 applicable. Therefore, it is convenient to separately
solve (21.8) in each half space, and apply suitable matching conditions at x D 0

Space-Charge and Quasi-Neutral Regions
The form of the electric potential ' is shown in Fig. 21.2 for a p-n junction at
equilibrium with NA D 1016 cm3, ND D 1015 cm3. The form of the bands is
shown in Fig. 21.3 for the same device. It is interesting to note that the device
can be thought of as made of three regions: in the intermediate region, whose
boundaries are marked by dashed vertical lines in Fig. 21.2, the electric potential
has a non-negligible curvature, thus showing that the charge density is large. The
region is called space-charge region and contains the metallurgical junction, marked
by the continuous vertical line. In the two regions on the sides of the space-charge
region, the electric potential is nearly constant,5 whence the electric ﬁeld d'=dx
is negligibly small. As a consequence, the charge density  D "sc d2'=dx2 is
negligible as well; for this reason, the two regions under consideration are called
quasi-neutral regions.6
5The electric potential cannot be exactly constant, because the solution of (21.8) is an analytical
function; as a consequence, if ' was constant in a ﬁnite interval, it would be constant everywhere.
6The inverse reasoning would not be correct: in fact,  D 0 may yield d'=dx D const ¤ 0, which
makes ' a linear function of x; deducing ' D const from  D 0 is correct only if the additional
condition of spatial uniformity holds.

The transition from the space-charge region and one or the other quasi-neutral
region is sharp. Thanks to this, it is possible to identify the width l of the space-
charge region and correlate it with other parameters of the device; such a correlation
is worked out in Sect. 21.4 in a speciﬁc operating regime. For convenience, the width
of the space-charge region is expressed as l D lpCln, where lp is the extension of the
space-charge region on the p side of the metallurgical junction, and ln the analogue

Fig. 21.4 Electron and hole concentrations in a one-dimensional, abrupt p-n junction at equilib-
rium, with NA D 1016 cm3, ND D 1015 cm3. The ﬁgure is drawn in a logarithmic scale. The
continuous vertical line marks the position of the metallurgical junction, the dashed vertical lines
mark the edges of the space-charge region
on the n side. As shown in Fig. 21.2, it is ln > lp; as explained in Sect. 21.4, this is
due to the global charge neutrality and to the fact that ND < NA.
If the equilibrium carrier concentrations corresponding to the electric potential
of Fig. 21.2 are drawn in a logarithmic scale, the curves look similar to that of
Fig. 21.2, apart from scaling factors and from the inversion due to the negative
sign in p D pn0 expŒq '=.kB T/. This is shown in Fig. 21.4. A more realistic
representation, shown in Fig. 21.5, uses a linear scale. The hole concentration
p ranges from pp0 ' NA D 1016 cm3 in the p-type quasi-neutral region to
pn0 ' n2
i =ND D 105 cm3 in the n-type quasi-neutral region; similarly, the electron
concentration n ranges from np0 ' n2
i =NA D 104 cm3 in the p-type quasi-neutral
region to nn0 ' ND D 1015 cm3 in the n-type quasi-neutral region. This shows that
the two concentrations vary by several orders of magnitude over the space-charge
region, whose length is about 1 m; for this reason, if these gradients existed alone,
they would make holes (electrons) to diffuse in the positive (negative) direction of
the x axis. Such diffusions in fact do not occur, because in the equilibrium condition
they are balanced by the electric ﬁeld. The latter is negative: in fact, the electric
potential increases with x, so that the force associated with the electric ﬁeld E is
negative (positive) for holes (electrons); the equations for the current densities of
the semiconductor device model in (19.129) and (19.130) yield in this case

Fig. 21.5 The same concentrations as in Fig. 21.4, drawn in a linear scale
introducing two more junctions. The contacts are made of materials different from
the semiconductor of which the p-n junction is made, hence the atomic structure of
the contact’s material must adapt to that of the semiconductor when the contact is
deposited on it; for this reason, the structure of the contact-semiconductor junction
must be described on a case-by-case basis. From the qualitative standpoint, one
can use the analogy with the p-n junction to deduce the existence of a built-in
potential ˚mp between the contact and the p-type semiconductor, and of another
built-in potential ˚mn between the contact and the n-type semiconductor. The built-
in potentials are inﬂuenced by the dopant concentration of the semiconductor,
namely, ˚mp D ˚mp.NA/ and ˚mn D ˚mn.ND/. Assume that the contacts are made
of the same material; if they are short-circuited, a closed loop is formed where, from
Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the built-in potentials fulﬁll the relation
 0 C ˚mn  ˚mp D 0 :
(21.17)
This situation is schematically illustrated in Fig. 21.6, where it is assumed that the
material of the contacts is the same.7 In the ﬁgure, the built-in potentials at the
contacts are represented by discontinuities; in the practical cases, in fact, to prevent
the contact-semiconductor junction from behaving like a rectifying device, a heavy
dose of dopant is preliminarily introduced into the semiconductor region onto which
the contact is to be deposited. For this reason, the spatial extension where ˚mp
or ˚mn occurs is negligibly small with respect to the typical scale length of the
device. Regardless of this, another important outcome of the fabrication process
mentioned above is that the concentration of carriers available in the materials
forming a contact is very large; for this reason, as mentioned in Sect. 19.5.6, a

contact is able to supply the amount of charge necessary to keep the equilibrium
and charge-neutrality conditions in the semiconductor layer adjacent to it. This also
implies that within some limits to be speciﬁed later, in a nonequilibrium condition
the built-in potential is practically the same as in equilibrium. In circuit theory, a
contact whose built-in potential is independent of the current that crosses it is called
ideal Ohmic contact; this condition is equivalent to that of a vanishing differential
resistivity of the contact.
21.3
Shockley Theory of the P-N Junction
The analytical derivation of the current-voltage characteristic of the p-n junction is
based on the hypothesis that the device is not too far from equilibrium, so that the
weak-injection condition (20.35) is fulﬁlled in the quasi-neutral regions. Within this
limit, the approximation that the contacts are ideal is acceptable. A nonequilibrium
condition is obtained by applying, e.g., a bias voltage V between the contacts; if V
is such that the electric potential at the contact of the p region is higher than that of
the n region, the condition is called forward bias; when it is lower, the condition is
called reverse bias. Figure 21.7 shows the symbol of the p-n junction used in circuit
theory, along with the standard references for the applied voltage V and current I.
In a one-dimensional case the current is given by I D Ae J, with Ae the device
cross-sectional area and J the total current density.
Numerical solutions of the semiconductor-device model show that in the weak-
injection condition the partitioning of the device into space-charge and quasi-neutral
regions still holds; this implies that when a bias voltage is applied between the

contacts, such a voltage adds algebraically to the built-in potential. In fact, the
discontinuities at the contacts are the same as in the equilibrium condition due
to the contacts’ ideality, and the electric potential in the quasi-neutral regions is
nearly constant; the extension of the space-charge region, instead, changes due to
the application of the external voltage, lp D lp.V/, ln D ln.V/. When a forward
bias is applied, lp and ln slightly decrease, as qualitatively shown in Fig. 21.8; the
drawing is not in the same scale as Fig. 21.6 and is meant only to show the change
in l. The same applies to Fig. 21.9 that refers to the reverse bias and shows that in
this case lp and ln increase. Using (21.17), the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to either case yields, for the voltage drop  across the space-charge region, the
expression

In reverse bias (V < 0) it is always  >  0 > 0; in forward bias (V > 0)
a sufﬁciently large value of V in (21.18) could make  to become negative.
However, when V becomes large the weak-injection condition does not hold any
more, and (21.18) does not apply; in conclusion, the range of forward biases to be
considered here is such that the condition  0 >  > 0 is always fulﬁlled.
When a forward bias is applied, due to  <  0 the electric ﬁeld within the
space-charge region decreases with respect to the equilibrium case;8 thus, the drift
term in the drift-diffusion equations of (19.129) and (19.130) becomes weaker.
The diffusion term, in contrast, becomes slightly stronger, because the values of
the electron concentrations in the quasi-neutral regions are ﬁxed by the asymptotic
conditions, and the width of the space-charge region slightly decreases with respect

When a reverse bias is applied, due to  >  0 the voltage drop across the

electric ﬁeld within the space-charge region increases and the drift term in the drift-
diffusion equations of (19.129) and (19.130) becomes stronger. The diffusion term,

Once Jp, Jn are determined from (21.22), they are speciﬁed at a suitable position and

Observing that lp is the boundary of the p-type region, Jp.lp/ is a majority-carrier

happens if the other boundary is chosen, to yield J D Jp.ln/ C Jn.ln/. To proceed,

Derivation of the I.V/ Characteristic
Remembering the simpliﬁed form (20.38) or (20.40) of the net thermal-recombin-

and neq D np0 in the p-type region, transforms (21.22) into, respectively,

In this way, the hole- and electron-continuity equations are decoupled from
each other; also, they are to be solved over disjoint intervals. To the current-
continuity equations one associates the corresponding drift-diffusion equation taken
from (19.129) or (19.130); it follows that in each quasi-neutral region the drift-
diffusion equation is that of the minority carriers. It can be shown that in a
quasi-neutral region, when the weak-injection condition holds, the diffusion term
of the minority carriers dominates over the drift term (the details are worked out in
Sect. 21.9.1). Thus, for x < lp (p-type region), Jn D q n n E C q Dn dn=dx '

In this derivation the diffusion coefﬁcient Dn D kB T n=q is not subjected to
the derivative; in fact, the two parameters that inﬂuence bulk mobility, T and NA

with Ln the diffusion length of the minority carriers in the p-type region. It is a
second-order, linear equation in the unknown n; it is decoupled from the rest of the
semiconductor-device model: in fact, the simpliﬁed form of the net-recombination
term contains only the electron concentration, and the neglect of the drift term
eliminates the coupling with the Poisson equation. The boundary conditions must
be ﬁxed at x ! 1 and x D lp; the former is n.1/ D np0, whereas the
latter needs a more elaborate derivation, given in Sect. 21.9.2, whose outcome (also
called Shockley’s boundary condition) is n.lp/ D np0 expŒq V=.kB T/. The general
solution of (21.27) is

The characteristic fulﬁlls the equilibrium condition I.0/ D 0; in fact, at equilibrium
it is USRH D 0. When q V=kB T  1, the exponential term in (21.34) prevails over
the other terms and the characteristic becomes I ' Is exp ŒqV=.kB T/, namely, the
well-known exponential form of the forward-bias case. Finally, when q V=kB T 
1, the current becomes I ' Is C IU. As the order of magnitude of Is may be
similar to that of IU, it is necessary to calculate the latter explicitly. The analysis
is made easier by the observation that the electric ﬁeld (which in the reverse-bias
condition prevails over diffusion) drains the holes from the space-charge region to
the p-type quasi-neutral region; similarly, the electrons of the space-charge region
are drained towards the n-type quasi-neutral region. As a consequence, the carrier
concentrations in the space-charge region are negligible, and the full-depletion
condition (20.34) applies there; using the nondegenerate expression one ﬁnds, for
the reverse-bias current,

the reverse-bias condition and for an abrupt junction it is l /
p
 0 C jVj; as a
consequence, jIUj increases with jVj.
The approximations that have been introduced to derive the I.V/ characteristic
are many; in fact, (21.34) is referred to as the ideal characteristic. However, it
captures quite well the general behavior of the device as long as the applied voltage
is within the limit of the weak-injection approximation. When the forward bias
exceeds such a limit, the drift term is not negligible anymore and the effect of
the electric ﬁeld in the quasi-neutral regions must be accounted for. Considering in
turn the reverse-bias condition, at large values of jVj the electric ﬁeld in the space-
charge region becomes sufﬁciently strong to induce impact ionization (Sect. 20.3)
and, possibly, the junction breakdown due to avalanche (Sect. 21.5).
The dependence of the I.V/ characteristic on temperature is due, besides that
of q V=.kB T/, to the coefﬁcients of Js and JU. To this purpose, the second
form of (21.33) is more useful because it shows explicitly the term n2
i , whose

temperature dependence is exponential (18.14); in fact, the temperature dependence
of Dp=p, Dn=n is much weaker. The same considerations apply to JU, whose main
dependence on temperature is due to factor ni. The dependence on ni of the reverse
current (at constant temperature) has been used in the considerations about the
parasitic currents in integrated circuits made in Sect. 18.7.
21.4
Depletion Capacitance of the Abrupt P-N Junction
It has been anticipated in Sect. 21.3.1 that when a reverse bias is applied to
the junction, the full-depletion condition holds in the space-charge region; as a
consequence, the charge density  in the latter is essentially due to the dopant atoms.
In the abrupt junction considered here, the dopants’ concentration is piecewise
constant; a simpliﬁed description of the charge density in the situation in hand
is obtained from the abrupt space-charge edge (ASCE) approximation, which
describes  with the form sketched in Fig. 21.10. In other terms, the approximation
consists in replacing with a discontinuity the smooth change of  at x D lp, x D 0,
and x D ln; thus, the space charge is given by
 D q NA ;
lp < x < 0 ;

as is found by integrating divD D  over the space-charge region. In the charge-
conservation relation the widths lp, ln depend on V through (21.43); it follows that
in the reverse-bias condition the device can be assimilated to a nonlinear capacitor
where the charge per unit area of the two oppositely charged sides is, respectively,
Qp D q NA lp and Qn D q ND ln. The differential capacitance per unit area

10It is worth reminding that the result holds only in the reverse-bias condition. In the forward-
bias condition the injection of carriers from the quasi-neutral regions into the space-charge region
prevents one from neglecting the contribution of the carrier concentrations to the charge density
and makes the use of (21.47) erroneous.

concentration is piecewise constant; as shown in Sect. 21.9.3, it applies in fact to
all cases.
From the standpoint of circuit design, the capacitance associated with a p-n
junction is a parasitic effect that hampers the circuit’s speed. However, the effect
is also exploited to manufacture voltage-controlled capacitors, called variable
capacitors or varactors. In these devices, that are operated in reverse bias, the
geometry is designed to maximize the capacitance; they are used, e.g., in voltage-
controlled oscillators, parametric ampliﬁers, and frequency modulation.11 The bias
range of these devices is such that the reverse current is negligibly small; if the
modulus of the reverse bias is made to increase and is eventually brought outside
this range, carrier multiplication due to impact ionization (Sect. 20.3) takes place;
this, as shown in Sect. 21.5, leads to a strong increase of the reverse current.
21.5
Avalanche Due to Impact Ionization
The situation where impact ionization dominates over the other generation-recomb-
ination mechanisms has been illustrated in Sect. 20.3.1, showing that in the steady-
state case the continuity equations for electrons and holes reduce to (20.59). Such
equations are applicable, for instance, to the space-charge region of a reverse-biased
p-n junction; when the value of jVj becomes large, the increase in the number of
carriers due to impact ionization may give rise to an avalanche phenomenon that
eventually leads to the junction’s avalanche breakdown, namely, a strong increase
in the current due to carrier multiplication.12 The absolute value VB of the voltage at
which the phenomenon occurs is called breakdown voltage. To illustrate avalanche,
the one-dimensional case is considered, so that (20.59) become

dx D kn Jn C kp Jp ;
dJp
dx D kn Jn  kp Jp ;
(21.49)
where the impact-ionization coefﬁcients kn, kp depend on x through the electric
ﬁeld E and are determined experimentally.13 To ease the notation the boundaries
of the space-charge region are indicated with a, b; also, considering the reference’s
orientation (Fig. 21.7), it is E; Jn; Jp < 0, where the electric ﬁeld is signiﬁcant
11Varactors are also manufactured using technologies other than the bipolar one; e.g., with MOS
capacitors or metal-semiconductor junctions.
12If the breakdown is accompanied by current crowding, the junction may be destroyed due to
excessive heating. Special p-n junctions, called avalanche diodes, are designed to have breakdown
uniformly spread over the surface of the metallurgical junction, to avoid current crowding. Such
devices are able to indeﬁnitely sustain the breakdown condition; they are used as voltage reference
and for protecting electronic circuits against excessively high voltages.
13An example of model for kn, kp is that proposed by Chynoweth [23]: kn D kns exp.jEcn=Ejˇn/,
kp D kps exp.jEcp=Ejˇp/, where the parameters depend on temperature [105, 138].

(21.54)
The above result is somewhat simpliﬁed by observing that due to impact ionization,
the concentration of electrons in the conduction band increases from a to b, whereas
that of holes increases from b to a; the concept is rendered in Fig. 21.12: consider a
portion x1 < x < x2 of the space-charge region, where it is assumed for simplicity
that the electric potential is linear. As the electric ﬁeld is oriented toward the left,
electrons (indicated by the black dots) are accelerated toward the right end of the
space-charge region, holes (the white dots) are accelerated toward the left end.
The vertical lines indicate the exchange of energies involved in impact-ionization
events initiated by electrons or holes. An electron transited from the valence to
the conduction band is accelerated by the ﬁeld and may acquire a kinetic energy
sufﬁcient for initiating an impact-ionization event itself; the same applies to holes.
As a consequence, the number of conduction-band electrons is multiplied from
left to right, namely, the number of those exiting at x2 is larger than the number
entering at x1; similarly, the number of valence-band holes is multiplied from right
to left. Due to the multiplication mechanism, taking x D b by way of example, the
major contribution to J D Jn.b/ C Jp.b/ is given by Jn.b/. Then, letting J ' Jn.b/

where Mn is the electron-multiplication factor. The latter is a measure of the impact
ionization’s level. As long as Yn < 1, corresponding to a ﬁnite value of Mn, the
avalanche condition does not occur; when Yn ! 1, then Mn ! 1: in this case, the
injection of a negligibly small number of electrons at a produces a large electron
current density at b. The operating conditions where Mn is large must be avoided
because an excessive current may damage the device. Note that in the design stage
of the device one ﬁrst calculates Yn from (21.54), then obtains Mn from (21.55).
Thus, it may well happen that Yn > 1, corresponding to Mn < 0; this outcome is not
physically sound and simply indicates that the parameters used in the calculation of
the ionization integral (21.54) are not consistent.14
The analysis of the impact-ionization condition can also be carried out starting
with the elimination of Jn from the second equation in (21.49). The equation
corresponding to (21.51) reads

21.6
Photodiode
The analysis of the p-n junction, depicted in Sects. 21.2 and 21.3, is readily
extended to incorporate the description of a radiation detector, the photodiode. More
speciﬁcally, the device described in this section is the depletion-layer photodiode,
that consists of a reverse-biased p-n junction subjected to an impinging radiation. In
the reverse-bias condition, the space-charge region is practically depleted from the
mobile carriers; it follows that in such a region the radiation-induced generations
prevail over the recombinations. The carriers thus generated modulate the device
current: in this way, as outlined in the discussion of Sect. 20.4, the impinging
radiation is exploited to provide an electric signal whose amplitude depends on the
number of absorbed photons. Typical applications aim at detecting visible light; in
this case the device is also termed optical sensor.15
In the description that follows, a one-dimensional, abrupt junction is considered,
whose structure is analyzed with the help of Fig. 21.13; in the latter, the impinging
photons are sketched by the wavy arrows, while the black dot indicates an electron
and the white dot a hole. The following considerations are also worth attention:
ﬁrst, the approximation of considering the structure as one dimensional makes the
upper contact to cover the semiconductor area completely; in real devices, the
upper contact covers only a fraction of the sensor’s area and, moreover, the area
free from the contact is covered with an anti-reﬂection coating to minimize the
loss of photons;16 in the simpliﬁed structure considered here it is assumed that
15A reverse-biased p-n junction can also be used for detecting photons in a broader range of
frequencies than the visible one, including x-rays or -rays, or high-energy particles, like electrons,
˛-particles, or neutrons. The mechanism is in all cases the creation of electron-hole pairs without
signiﬁcantly altering the junction’s functioning.
16Anti-reﬂection coatings are structures made of the superposition of layers having different
refraction indices. The thicknesses of the layers are such that a destructive interference is produced
in the rays reﬂected at the interfaces, while a constructive interference is produced in the

the contact is partially transparent. Next, the radiation-induced generations occur in
both the space-charge and quasi-neutral regions.17 The electron-hole pairs generated
in the space-charge region are separated by the electric ﬁeld and move in opposite
directions, as graphically sketched in Fig. 21.13. In contrast, the electrons and holes
generated in the quasi-neutral regions, where the electric ﬁeld is small, have a
relatively high chance of recombining.18 It follows that most of the electron-hole
pairs generated within the quasi-neutral regions are useless as far as the functioning
of the photodiode is concerned. This disadvantage is particularly severe in the quasi-
neutral region close to the upper contact, which in the example of Fig. 21.13 is
the pC region: in fact, remembering from the analysis of Sect. 20.4 that the optical
generation decays exponentially along the propagation direction (x in this case), the
number of generated pairs is maximum near the upper contact. To limit the loss it
is then necessary to make the depth of the upper neutral region as small as possible,
namely, the junction’s width xj must be minimized (shallow junction). At the same
time, it is necessary to make the space-charge region’s depth as large as possible,
so that the majority of the pairs are generated in it; for this reason, the junction is
strongly asymmetric, speciﬁcally, the dopant concentration of the upper region is
much larger than that of the lower region. In the case considered here it is NA  ND

transmitted rays. The coating’s design is optimized in order to obtain maximum transmission in
a speciﬁc range of wavelengths and incidence angles.
17As shown in detail in Sect. 21.6.1, the photodiode is analyzed under the same hypotheses as those
used for the p-n junction, among which is the partitioning of the structure into space-charge and
quasi-neutral regions (Sect. 21.2.2).
18An exception is made for the pairs generated in the quasi-neutral regions near the edges of the
space-charge region. The pairs move due to diffusion; if they succeed in reaching the edge before
recombining, they are separated by the electric ﬁeld and contribute to the radiation-generated
current.

Bipolar Devices
The minimization of xj brings about the problem, already noted in Sect. 21.2.1,
that the asymptotic boundary condition typical of the p-n junction’s theory does not
hold when the distance between the contact and the edge of the space-charge region
is too short; a slightly more involved theory must be applied, whose outcome is that
the expression of the saturation current density Js differs from that given by (21.33).
The derivation of the new expression is identical for the photodiode and the solar
cell, and will therefore be postponed to the analysis of the latter (Sect. 21.7). As
a ﬁnal remark, in the derivation of the photodiode’s characteristic it is acceptable
to assume that the absorption events are uncorrelated from each other, so that one
can limit the analysis to a monochromatic radiation. The more general approach
in which one recovers the effect of the whole spectrum by adding up over the
frequencies is shown in Sect. 21.7.
21.6.1
Photodiode—Continuous Mode
The continuous mode of operation of the photodiode corresponds to the case
where the applied bias V < 0 is constant in time. Therefore, one uses the one-
dimensional, steady-state form of the continuity equations for the electrons and
holes. The analysis follows the same pattern as for the p-n junction (Sect. 21.3),
the difference being that in addition to thermal recombination, one must consider
optical generation as well. The continuity equations (21.22) then become

to be compared with (21.24). Like in Sect. 21.3, the rest of the calculation is based
upon the weak-injection approximation, which allows one to decouple the continuity
equations for the minority carriers in the quasi-neutral region and to assume that,
still in such regions, the diffusion term in the transport equation for the minority
carriers dominates over the drift term. Remembering that a reverse bias is applied
to the photodiode, the recombination current is given by the same expression as
in (21.35), namely, IU D q Ae ni l=g, with l D l.V/ the width of the space-charge
region and Ae the cross-sectional area of the device. In turn, the optical current
IG D Ae JG is found by inserting (20.67) into (21.62); assuming for simplicity that
the absorption coefﬁcient k is independent of position, one ﬁnds
IG D Ae q  ˚B k
Z ln
lp
exp .k x/ dx D Ae q  ˚B exp.k lp/ Œ1  exp.k l/ ;
(21.65)
where k depends on the photons’ wavelength . In (21.65), 0 <  < 1 is
the quantum efﬁciency (compare with (20.63)), and ˚B D ˚.x D 0C/ is the
photons’ ﬂux density on the inside edge of the interface between the top contact
and the semiconductor. The expression of IG simpliﬁes when speciﬁc materials or
applications are considered; taking for instance the case of silicon used for visible-
light detection, 1=k ranges monotonically between 1=k ' 0:25 m at  D 0:4 m
and 1=k ' 5 m at  D 0:7 m, with 1=k ' 1 m at  D 0:5 m [128, Sect. 12-4].
In turn, the order of magnitude of l can be determined with the aid of the expressions
shown in Sect. 21.9.4. From the analysis one ﬁnds that the dopant concentrations
and the applied voltage can be adapted to obtain k l  1 and k lp  1, so that
IG ' Ae q  ˚B. This brings about the advantage that IG becomes independent of the
applied voltage.
The calculation of the term Jp.ln/ C Jn.lp/ in (21.64) follows the same pattern
as for the solar cell and is postponed to Sect. 21.7. It leads to a constant saturation
current whose expression, as anticipated above, differs from that given by (21.33)
due to a modiﬁed boundary condition. Indicating the saturation current with I0

of the current has been carried out starting from the steady-state form of the

where the ﬂux density of photons, ˚B, is independent of time. However, the result
may still be used in time-dependent cases, provided the period of the time variation
of ˚B is much larger than the other relevant time constants (the minority-carrier
lifetimes in this case).

Photodiode—Storage Mode
The current of a photodiode functioning in the continuous mode, whose simpliﬁed
expression is (21.66), may be rather small under the typical illumination conditions;
for this reason, the noise introduced by the external circuit (such a circuit is
mimicked by resistor R in Fig. 21.13) may bring in an unacceptable degradation of
the electric signal obtained from the device. To increase the amplitude of the output
signal one may renounce the continuous mode operation, and sample the signal only
at speciﬁc instants. This solution leads to the concept of storage-mode photodiode,
which can be accomplished by introducing a suitable modiﬁcation in the external
circuit.
In the storage-mode operation of the photodiode, a constant voltage V0 < 0 is
applied (Fig. 21.14), while the switch is alternately opened and closed. When the
switch is open, no current can ﬂow in the circuit; thus, the effect of the generation-
recombination processes is to modify the charge stored in the photodiode. This, in
turn, changes the voltage drop VD across the photodiode according to the relation
dQ D C dVD, where Q is the charge per unit area and C D C.VD/ the differential
capacitance per unit area. The latter is obtained from (21.47) in the case of an
abrupt junction, and from (21.126) in the case of a diffused junction; here a general
expression will be used, namely,
C D
C0
.1  VD= 0/1=m ;
m D 2; 3 ;
(21.67)
where the constant C0 must be consistent with the choice of m. The expression of dQ
is more easily derived with reference to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 21.15,
where IG D q Ae  ˚B indicates the optical-generation current.19

carried out in Sect. 21.7.

It is assumed that IG is independent of time, and much larger than the other two
summands at the right-hand side of (21.66); therefore, only IG is considered in the
equivalent circuit. When the switch is kept closed and possible earlier transients
have vanished, it is I D IG < 0, so that the voltage drop across the photodiode is
VD D V0 C R IG; the choice of V0 is such that V0 C R IG < 0. If the switch is opened
at, say, t D 0, the external current I vanishes while IG starts modifying the charge
stored in the capacitor according to the relation Ae dQ D IG dt. Combining the latter
with dQ D C dVD and using (21.67) yield

whose solution provides the time evolution of VD when the switch is open. This
condition is kept until a suitable time Ti, called integration time, has elapsed; then,
the switch is closed again. To ﬁnd the voltage drop across the photodiode right
before the closing of the switch, one solves (21.68) and calculates the solution at
t D Ti; this yields

with Vi D VD.Ti/ and V0 C R IG D VD.0/. The left-hand side of (21.69) and IG are
positive, whence Vi > V0. Also, Ti is selected in such a way as to keep Vi negative,
whence 0 > Vi > V0. Note that during the integration time it is VR D 0. The closing
of the switch restores the voltage V0 of the upper electrode of the photodiode, forcing
a voltage variation, from Vi to V0, virtually in zero time. As the capacitor does
not allow for a time discontinuity of VD, the same variation is forced in the lower
electrode of the photodiode; as a consequence VR changes, virtually in zero time,
from 0 to V0  Vi < 0, making a current peak to ﬂow in the load resistor. The ratio

The switch is kept closed for a time interval Ts, called sampling time, long enough
to restore the condition VD D V0 C R IG. The differential equation describing the
circuit during the sampling time is different from (21.68) because here it is I ¤ 0.

and in the sampling time is shown in Fig. 21.16 for m D 2 and m D 3. Observing
that during the sampling time it is VR D V0  VD and I D VR=R, the time evolution
of VR and I within the sampling time is the same as that of VD apart from scaling
factors and/or additive constants; within the integration time, instead, it is VR D 0,
I D 0 as remarked above.
Typical applications of storage-mode devices are in the ﬁeld of imaging, where
individual sensors are organized into arrays that provide a signal to be displayed
on a screen. The temporal sensitivity and resolution of human vision are such that
an image is perceived as stable when the frame rate is higher than about 50 Hz.20
Above such a limit, no ﬂicker is perceived by the average observer despite the fact
that static images are presented one after the other. The interlaced technique can
effectively be used to double the perceived frame rate; in this technique, each frame
is made of two ﬁelds, one of which contains the odd-numbered lines of the image,
the other one contains the even-numbered lines. When the interlaced technique

a video camera) displays consecutive images.

is used, the frame rate can in fact be reduced to about 25 Hz, corresponding to
40 ms per frame. The estimates carried out in Probs. 21.8 and 21.9 show that the
photodiode’s performance complies with these speciﬁcations.
21.7
Solar Cell
In contrast to the photodiode, whose purpose is that of sensing the radiation, the
solar cell exploits the radiation-induced generations to convert the radiation’s energy
into electric energy. Such a conversion is also termed photovoltaic (PV) effect.
The schematic cross-section of a solar cell is shown in Fig. 21.17; observing
that there is no external bias, one cannot prescribe the sign of V a priori: such
an information must be obtained by solving the full p-n junction’s model ﬁrst,
and deducing the value of V and I afterwards. Thus, besides considering optical
generation in addition to thermal recombination, the general approach of Sect. 21.3
will be followed. As remarked in Sect. 21.6, the whole spectrum of the radiation
must be used; to this purpose, one takes the simpliﬁed form of the optical-generation
term (20.67) in which, like in Sect. 21.6.1, it is assumed that the absorption
coefﬁcient k is independent of position:
GO./ D gO exp.k x/ ;
gO./ D  ˚B k :
(21.72)
The zero of x is made to coincide with the inside edge of the interface between the
top contact and the semiconductor. Considering a discrete spectrum of the radiation,
the symbols GO, gO are replaced with Gi, gi, respectively, where index i refers
to the ith monochromatic component. As noted in Sect. 21.6.2, it is acceptable to
assume that the absorption events are uncorrelated from each other, so that the
generations due to the whole spectrum are described by P
i Gi. With these premises,

independent from each other, the left-hand side of (21.76) vanishes only if each
term in brackets vanishes. It could happen that ki D 1=Ln for some value of i; in
this case, however, the corresponding summand Ci exp.ki x/ D Ci exp.x=Ln/
would be incorporated into the second term at the right-hand side of (21.75), thus
becoming a part of the homogeneous solution. In conclusion, when treating the
nonhomogeneous part of (21.75), one may always assume that ki ¤ 1=Ln; this
eventually yields the expression of the coefﬁcients Ci,

The remaining two constants, An and Bn, are found as usual from the boundary
conditions of the electron concentration in the quasi-neutral region. To this purpose
one notes, from Fig. 21.17, that the position of the boundary between the quasi-
neutral and space-charge regions is s D xj  lp so that, using the Shockley boundary
condition (Sect. 21.9.2), the following holds:

(21.78)
with F D expŒq V=.kB T/  1. As for the boundary condition at x D 0, that is,
at the interface between the top contact and the semiconductor, the minimization
of xj, necessary for the efﬁcient operation of the device, prevents one from using
the asymptotic conditions (21.1) typical of the p-n junction’s theory; this had
already been noted in Sects. 21.2.1 and 21.6.1. On the other hand, as discussed in
Sect. 19.5.6, a contact is able to supply the amount of charge necessary to keep the
equilibrium and charge-neutrality conditions in the semiconductor layer adjacent to
it; as a consequence, here the boundary condition at x D 0 reads

Solving the algebraic system (21.78, 21.79) provides the two coefﬁcients An, Bn.
The solution is somewhat simpliﬁed if s  Ln and s  1=ki; comparing with
the estimates of the diffusion lengths given in (21.129), the ﬁrst condition is easily
fulﬁlled. As for the second one, remembering the ﬁgures given in Sect. 21.6.1, for
very shallow junctions the constraint is fulﬁlled in the near-infrared and part of the
visible range. Then, linearizing the exponentials reduces (21.78) to21

Bipolar Junction Transistor
The bipolar junction transistor22 (BJT) was proposed in 1948 [9, 121]. The ﬁrst
prototype of the device, constructed in December 1947 using germanium, was
a point-contact transistor, namely, a structure where the tip of a triangle-shaped
block of material produces a point-contact diode. The structure was improved in
1948 by replacing the point contact with a p-n junction.23 After being used for
about two decades for fabricating BJTs, germanium was almost totally replaced
by silicon in the mid-sixties of the last century (Sect. 18.7.1). The research that led
to the invention of the transistor aimed at replacing vacuum tubes with smaller and
less power-consuming devices; the initial applications to low-frequency ampliﬁers
quickly extended to include high-power, high-frequency, and switching operations:
thus, the introduction of the BJT had a formidable impact on the semiconductor
industry and the related research activities. Until the introduction of the MOS
transistor, the BJT has been the basic ingredient in the fabrication of the electronic
circuits.
The electric current in a BJT is transported by both type of carriers, electrons
and holes; for this reason the device is called bipolar. There exist two possible
architectures of the devices, the n-p-n type and the p-n-p type; the schematic cross-
section of an n-p-n BJT is shown in Fig. 21.19. The starting point is a p-type silicon
substrate, with an NA D const dopant concentration.24 At the beginning of the
process, the upper surface of the semiconductor wafer is in the position marked
by the dash-dotted arrows; the superimposed structure does not exist yet. In the ﬁrst
step of the fabrication, a limited area is deﬁned by a suitable mask, and a heavy
n-type thermal diffusion is carried out in it, to create a region called buried layer
or subcollector; this region is shown as the dark area marked with nC in the ﬁgure.
Purpose of the buried layer is to provide a low-resistance path between the active
part of the transistor and the collector contact. Next, a lightly doped, n-type epitaxial
layer is grown over the entire wafer; this layer, shown as the area marked with n
in the ﬁgure, replicates the crystalline structure of the wafer underneath. As epitaxy
22The term is a contraction of transfer resistor.
23This explains the term “junction” in the name.
24The terminology of the process steps is better explained in the chapters devoted to the
technological issues.

is a high-temperature process, during the epitaxial growth the buried layer diffuses
in all directions; this explains why the upper edge of the buried layer is higher than
the interface between the substrate and the epitaxial layer.25
As in the normal operation of the device one of its p-n junctions is forward biased,
it might happen that a part of the junction’s current ﬂows into an adjacent device,
thus creating a parasitic effect that hampers the circuit’s performance. In this respect,
BJTs are not self-isolated.26 The problem is ﬁxed by means of isolation diffusions,
that consist of heavily doped p regions diffused across the epitaxial layer down to
the substrate. In this way a volume of material belonging to the epitaxial layer,
forming a well that will later become the collector region of the BJT, is completely
surrounded by a p-type region and is therefore isolated from the adjacent devices.27
Next, the p-type base region is diffused within the collector region, and the n-
type emitter region is diffused within the base region. In summary, two p-n junctions
are formed, the base-emitter (B-E) junction and the base-collector (B-C) junction.
For reasons dictated by the need of optimizing the device performance, the dopant
concentration in the base must be larger than that of the collector, and the dopant
concentration in the emitter must be larger than that of the base. Finally, the emitter
(E), base (B), and collector (C) contacts are deposited. As indicated in Sect. 21.2.2,
to prevent the contact-semiconductor junction from behaving like a rectifying
device, a heavy dose of dopant is preliminarily introduced into the semiconductor
region onto which the contact is to be deposited. Here, this is necessary for the
collector contact, because the epitaxial layer is lightly doped; in general, besides
introducing a large dopant concentration in the area near the contact, a heavily doped
25The details of the epitaxial process are given in Sects. 24.6 and 24.7; those of thermal diffusion
are in Chap. 23.
26In contrast, MOS transistors are self-isolated, because their junctions are never forward biased
(Sects. 22.7, 22.8). However, in some MOS architectures parasitic currents are possible, and
precautions must be taken against them using, e.g., channel stops (Sect. 22.10).
27The p-n junction formed by the substrate and the epitaxial layer is kept reverse biased by the
application of a suitable voltage between the substrate and collector contacts.

region (here of the n type) is diffused from the collector contact down to the buried
layer; purpose of this is again lowering the series resistance.
To distinguish the applied voltages from one another, two letters are used;
considering the base metallization as the reference contact, in an n-p-n BJT the
typical choice of the two independent voltages is VBE D VBVE and VBC D VBVC,
with VCE D VBE  VBC. The situation where the base contact is chosen as reference
is called common-base conﬁguration. It is clear from the description above that the
BJT architecture is structurally asymmetric; this reﬂects into the different behaviors
of the device, depending on the working conditions of the two junctions. The four
combinations of the applied biases are termed as shown in Table 21.1, along with
the combinations’ names and some comments; the indications “F” and “R” stand
for “forward bias” and “reverse bias,” respectively.28
A diagram describing the functioning regimes of the n-p-n transistor is shown in
Fig. 21.20 along with the device symbol. Note that the arrows associated with the
voltages point toward the p regions, so that the junctions are forward biased when
VBE > 0 and VBC > 0.
The structure of the BJT of the p-n-p type is dual to that of the n-p-n type; with
reference to Fig. 21.19, the cross-section is obtained by exchanging the “p” and “n”
letters. The voltages to be used in the common-base conﬁguration are VEB D VEVB
and VCB D VC  VB, with VCE D VCB  VEB. A diagram describing the functioning
regimes of the p-n-p transistor is shown in Fig. 21.21 along with the device symbol.
Again, the arrows associated with the voltages point toward the p regions, so that
the junctions are forward biased when VEB > 0 and VCB > 0.
28The nomenclature of Table 21.1 is fully general and is applicable to both the n-p-n and p-n-p
transistors. The forward condition is also called normal mode or active mode.

Current-Voltage Characteristics of the P-N-P BJT
The structure of the BJT, shown in Fig. 21.19, is rather complicate; for this reason,
an analytical derivation of the current-voltage characteristics is not viable for
the device as is, and some simpliﬁcations are necessary. The standard approach
consists in deriving the characteristics of the intrinsic transistor, namely, the one-
dimensional structure marked by the dashed contour visible in the ﬁgure; the dopant
concentration is considered constant in the emitter, base, and collector regions: in
this way, the structure to be analyzed is reduced to the one-dimensional juxtaposition
of two abrupt p-n junctions.
The intrinsic transistor, rotated by 90 degrees for convenience, is shown
in Fig. 21.22 for the n-p-n type, along with the diagram of the net concentration
of ionized impurities, N D NC
D  N
A . In the following, the complete-ionization
condition is assumed to hold; it follows that, indicating with NE, NC the constant
donor concentrations of the emitter and collector regions, respectively, and with
NB the constant acceptor concentration of the base region, the diagram of N takes
the piecewise-constant shape shown in the right part of the ﬁgure. The emitter (IE),
base (IB), and collector (IC) currents are also marked in the same ﬁgure; note that
the arrows associated with the currents point toward the p region, while they point
away from the n regions; thus, the relation IB D IE C IC holds. Remembering that
VBE and VBC are being used as independent voltages, it is convenient to select IE
and IC as the independent currents.
By comparing the intrinsic transistor of Fig. 21.22 with the transistor’s symbol of
Fig. 21.20 one notes that in the former, VBE and VBC are the voltage drops across the
junctions of the intrinsic transistor while, in the latter, the same symbols (and VCE
as well) indicate the voltages between the external contacts. In principle, different
symbols should be used, because the voltage drops of the intrinsic device do not
account for other effects due to the rest of the structure; among such effects are the

both the n-p-n and p-n-p types

due to the base current that ﬂows laterally (that is, normal to the x direction) across
the base region. In the calculations carried out below, the same notation is used
for simplicity; distinct symbols are to be used when the extra effects are accounted
for.29
The intrinsic transistor and net impurity concentration of the p-n-p type are those
shown in Fig. 21.23, where NE, NC are acceptor concentrations and NB a donor
concentration.
The hypotheses upon which the analytical theory of the intrinsic BJT is based
are the same as those used for the p-n junction (Sect. 21.3). It is assumed that the
working conditions are such that the device’s partitioning into quasi-neutral and
space-charge regions holds: as shown in Fig. 21.24, the position of the emitter junc-
tion is indicated with OE, and the left and right edges of the space-charge region of
the same junction are indicated with O
E , OC
E , respectively; a similar nomenclature
applies to the collector region. The device has two space-charge regions and three
quasi-neutral regions; the length of the quasi-neutral base region is marked with W
and is particularly important in determining the electric characteristics of the BJT.
The analytical theory carried out below refers to the p-n-p type;30 to distinguish the
29A typical way for considering the effect of the lateral ﬂow is to introduce a series resistance
(called intrinsic base resistance) between the base contact of the intrinsic device and the external
base contact.
30The choice of the p-n-p type is dictated only by a convenience in notation, due to the fact that the
current density of the minority carriers in the base (holes) has the same orientation as the x axis.

that the position of O

such coefﬁcients, whose units are those of a current, form a 22 symmetric matrix in

Equivalent Circuit of the P-N-P BJT
The right-hand sides of (21.102) depend on the voltages VEB, VCB through the coefﬁ-
cients a11; : : : ; a22 and the dimensionless factors FE, FC deﬁned in (21.90), (21.91).
Thus, (21.102) have the form IE D IE.VEB; VCB/, IC D IC.VEB; VCB/ which, from
the standpoint of circuit theory, describe a voltage-driven two-port circuit. The
ﬁrst equation in (21.102) shows that the current ﬂowing into the emitter may be
thought of as the sum of two currents, a11 FE C IUE and a12 FC, respectively; as a
consequence, the two contributions must be represented as two elements in parallel,
subjected to the voltage VEB; a similar representation applies to the collector port. To
better determine the elements of the circuit it is convenient to neglect the relatively
weak dependence of a11; : : : ; a22 on the voltages33 with respect to the exponential
33The voltage-dependence of the space-charge region’s width in the reverse-bias condition is
worked out in Sect. 21.4 for an abrupt junction and in Sect. 21.9.3 for a diffused junction. The
dependence is the strongest in the reverse-bias condition. When a forward bias is applied, the
width of the space-charge region is small; also, its variation is negligible because the bias itself
varies little.

dependence of FE, FC. It follows that the ﬁrst element describing IE becomes
identical to the equation of a p-n junction subjected to VEB, with a11 the saturation
current (compare with (21.34)). In turn, the term a12 FC, which depends on VCB
only, is a current driven by the voltage present at the other port; as a consequence,
it is represented in the circuit by a voltage-driven current generator. The analysis of
the collector port is similar, thus eventually leading to the Ebers and Moll model
of the BJT, shown in Fig. 21.25. The importance of the width of the quasi-neutral
base region can now be appreciated by observing that the coefﬁcients a11; : : : ; a22

As a consequence, the current generators of Fig. 21.25 become open circuits, and
the circuit reduces to the assembly of two independent p-n junctions in which the
current of each port is controlled only by the voltage of the same port. In fact, the
limit W=LB  1 is not realistic: the order of magnitude of W is about 1 m, while
the typical diffusion lengths are much larger (compare with the estimate (21.129));
due to this, the full expressions of a11; : : : ; a22 must be kept. From the physical
point of view, this means that the closeness of the two junctions is such that the
current of each port is inﬂuenced also by the voltage present at the other port; thus,
the behavior of the BJT is substantially different from that of two independent p-n
junctions.34
The typical values of W and LB are actually such that the other limit W=LB 
1 holds; in this case it is coth.W=LB/ ! 1= sinh.W=LB/ ! LB=W, and the
coefﬁcients (21.99), (21.100) simplify to
34From the technological point of view, the scaling down of W is more difﬁcult than that of the
channel length L of the MOS transistor. In fact, W is limited by the positions of the emitter-base
and collector-base junctions, which are in turn determined by two diffusion processes (Sect. 21.8).
In contrast, L is obtained from a lithographic process, whose control is much ﬁner than that of
thermal diffusions. This is the main reason why the evolution of the BJT technology, in terms of
scaling, has ceased progressing when W has reached the value of about 0:7 m.

Beside the form (21.102) of the device equations, it is often useful to consider
the mixed form IE D IE.VEB; VCB/, IC D IC.VCB; IE/. Remembering that the
dependence of a11; : : : ; a22 on the voltages is neglected, this is easily accomplished
by eliminating FE from (21.102). Letting

In the forward regime (Table 21.1) the emitter-base junction is forward biased,
whence IE  IUE; at the same time, the collector-base junction is reverse biased,
whence FC ' 1: as hFB is of order unity (see below) and IC0 is small, the collector
current is of the same order of magnitude as the emitter current, whence IC  IUC.
In summary, in the forward regime the second equation in (21.107) simpliﬁes to
IC ' hFB IE C IC0. Using the expressions (21.104), (21.105) for a11; : : : ; a22 one

From IC ' hFB IE C IC0 it follows that IC0 is the negative collector current when
the emitter port is open; such a current is necessarily small because the collector-
base junction is reverse biased.35 As a further approximation, applicable when
IE ¤ 0, one neglects IC0 to ﬁnd IC ' hFB IE; this justiﬁes the designation36
current gain ascribed to hFB (sufﬁxes “F” and “B” remind one that IC ' hFB IE
applies in the forward regime and in the common-base conﬁguration). From the
ﬁrst equation in (21.108) it follows that hFB approaches unity from below when
the ratio DE nE W=.DB pB LE/ is made smaller. Singling out the three factors, and
remembering the estimate of W=LB carried out above, one ﬁnds that the ratio W=LE
is smaller than unity; as for the ratio of the diffusion coefﬁcients, the Einstein
relation (19.102) yields DE=DB D nE=pB, where nE is the mobility of the
35The same result stems from the observation that IC0 has the same structure as a saturation current;
compare, e.g., with the estimate (21.130).

minority carriers (electrons) in the emitter, and pB is the mobility of the minority
carriers (holes) in the base. Their ratio is larger than one, but still of order unity.37
Finally, using (21.86) one ﬁnds nE=pB D NB=NE; as the two dopant concentrations
can be made to differ by orders of magnitude, the ratio NB=NE provides an easy way
to achieve a current gain close to unity. This explains why the dopant concentration
in the emitter must be larger than that in the base, as anticipated in Sect. 21.8.
Still in the forward regime, the contribution lnE.VEB/ to the width of the quasi-
neutral base region (21.101) varies little because in the typical operating conditions
the forward bias VEB is practically constant; the variations of the other contribution
lnC.VCB/, instead, may be large because the collector-base junction is reverse biased.
To limit the variations, the dopant concentration in the collector is made much
smaller than that of the base; in this way, the space-charge region of the collector-
base junction is strongly asymmetric, and extends mainly in the collector (compare
with the second relation in (21.39)): thus, the variation of lnC.VCB/ is negligible
and W may be considered constant. This explains why the dopant concentration in
the collector must be smaller than that in the base, as anticipated in Sect. 21.8. A
light dopant concentration in the collector is also useful to prevent the junction’s
avalanche breakdown (Sect. 21.5); in fact, a larger width of the space-charge region
corresponds to a smaller electric ﬁeld.
The output characteristics of the BJT of the p-n-p type, in the common-base
conﬁguration, represent the IC
D IC.VCB; IE/ relation, with VCB, IE used as
independent variable and parameter, respectively. The characteristics are drawn in
Fig. 21.26 using the second equation in (21.107) with hFB D 0:95, after neglecting
IUC and IUE. The portion of the characteristics on the right of the vertical line
describes the forward regime, while the portion on the left of it describes the
saturation regime (Table 21.1). Limiting the discussion to the forward regime, one
notes that IC is independent of VCB and practically equal to IE; in other terms,
the current at the output port (collector) is dictated by the voltage of the input
port (emitter). From the physical point of view, this means that the closeness of
the two junctions is such that the majority of the carriers (holes) injected by the
emitter into the base are able to diffuse to the space-charge region of the collector
without recombining. Once the holes reach the space-charge region, which is reverse
biased, the strong electric ﬁeld present in it pulls them into the collector. The small
fraction of holes that recombine within the base region give rise to the base current
IB D IE C IC; combining the latter with the second equation in (21.107), still
neglecting IUC and IUE, and eliminating IE yield
37Moreover, the degradation of nE is more severe than that of pB because the dopant concentra-
tion in the emitter is larger (Sect. 20.5.2). In the BJT of the n-p-n type, the ratio of the diffusion
coefﬁcients becomes DE=DB D pE=nB < 1, which is more advantageous; all other parameters
being the same, the n-p-n BJT is thus preferable. This is true also in time-dependent conditions,
because the dynamics of the device is essentially controlled by the mobility of the minority carriers
in the base.

The input characteristics of the BJT of the p-n-p type, in the common-base
conﬁguration, represent the IE D IE.VEB; VCB/ relation, with VEB, VCB used as
independent variable and parameter, respectively. They are derived from the ﬁrst
equation in (21.107) after neglecting IUC and IUE, namely, IE ' a11 FE Ca12 FC. For
a qualitative analysis one rewrites the above as IE D .a11ja12j/ FECja12j .FEFC/;
then, using (21.104) and making the same estimate as that used for hFB, one ﬁnds
IE ' ja12j .FE  FC/. As in the forward regime it is FC ' 1, it follows that the
curves corresponding to different values of VCB are barely distinguishable from one
another, and the input characteristics practically reduce to the single I.V/ curve of a
p-n junction.

Shockley’s Boundary Conditions
The derivation of the analytical model of the p-n junction’s I.V/ characteristic,
worked out in Sect. 21.3.1, requires the boundary conditions for the minority-carrier
concentrations at the boundaries of the space-charge region; speciﬁcally, one needs
to determine n.lp/ and p.ln/. The derivation is based on calculating approximate
expressions for the ratios n.lp/=n.ln/, p.ln/=p.lp/, where the denominators are
majority-carrier concentrations that are in turn approximated with n.ln/ ' nn0 ' ND

q Dn dn=dx, and observes that in the space-charge region the drift and diffusion
terms have opposite signs; also, their moduli are much larger than that of the
current density. In fact, the latter is small due to the weak-injection condition,
whereas the terms at the right-hand side of the equation are large because the
electric potential and the electron concentration have non-negligible variations over
the space-charge region. It follows that the moduli of the drift and diffusion terms
are comparable to each other: q n n E ' q Dn dn=dx  jJnj and, similarly,
q p p E ' q Dp dp=dx  jJpj for holes. Now, the approximation is introduced,

Depletion Capacitance—Arbitrary Doping Proﬁle
The expression of the depletion capacitance worked out in Sect. 21.4 for an abrupt p-
n junction is extended here to an arbitrary doping proﬁle, still in one dimension. Let
a < x < b be the region where the charge density  differs from zero, and assume
for the electric potential that ' D '.a/ D const for x < a and ' D '.b/ D const
for x > b. Also, it is assumed that there are no single layers or double layers of
charge, whence the electric ﬁeld E and ' are continuous. The constancy of ' in
the outside regions implies the global charge neutrality, as is found by integrating
"sc dE=dx D  from a to b and using the continuity of E:
Z b

 dx D 0 :
(21.120)
Thanks to (21.120) one ﬁnds, for any x,

which provides the deﬁnition of the charge per unit area Q. The deﬁnition holds
also if x is outside the interval Œa; b; in this case, however, one ﬁnds Q D 0. In the
following it is assumed that x is internal to the space-charge region. The solution
of the Poisson equation is taken from Prob. 4.2; using E.a/ D 0 and the global
charge-neutrality condition after letting  D '.b/  '.a/ yields

Thus, the capacitance per unit area of the space-charge region is

prescribed, the values of a, b are determined by the system of equations (21.120)
and (21.122).
It is interesting to note that if the charge density has a power form,   xn, then
 depends on the .n C 2/th power of b  a. Consider by way of example a diffused
junction, namely, a junction obtained, e.g., by diffusing a dopant of the p type
into a uniform n-type substrate. Expanding  to ﬁrst order around the metallurgical
junction and using the full-depletion and ASCE approximations yield  ' k x for

Solar Cell’s Parameters
As apparent from (21.85), the I.V/ characteristic of the solar cell is obtained by
shifting that of a standard p-n junction by an amount equal to IG. The curve is
drawn in Fig. 21.27 in arbitrary units; the intercept with the V axis is the open-
circuit voltage VOC D V.I D 0/ D .kB T=q/ logŒ.IG  IU/=I0
s C 1 > 0, that
with the I axis is the short-circuit current ISC D I.V D 0/ D IU  IG < 0. As
the intercept of the I.V/ curve with the load characteristic I D V=R belongs
to the fourth quadrant, the working voltage is positive while the corresponding
current is negative. It follows that the power P D V I is negative, namely, it is
delivered by the cell to the load resistance; as this reasoning applies to any value
of R, the latter can be adapted in order to maximize the transferred power. The
voltage that yields the maximum power is in fact determined by letting dP=dV D 0,
namely, I C V .dI=dV/ D 0, with I given by (21.85). The solution provides
the maximum-power voltage VMP which, replaced into (21.85), renders in turn
the maximum-power current IMP. The two values thus found eventually yield the
maximum-power resistance RMP D VMP=IMP.
A number of parameters are used to quantify the solar cell’s performance; among
them, the ﬁll factor has two alternative deﬁnitions, namely,

(21.134)
Due to the atmospheric absorption and the angle of incidence of sunlight, the
denominator of (21.134) is substantially lower than the solar constant39 dPE=dA '
136 mW cm2. The maximum theoretical efﬁciency of a solar cell made of a
single p-n junction with a 1:34 eV band gap has been calculated in [123] using
a 1:5 air mass;40 the resulting ﬁgure is about 33:7%. Silicon, whose band gap
at room temperature is about 1:12 eV, has a slightly smaller ﬁgure: 32%. The
efﬁciency of actual devices is lower than the theoretical one due to different types
of losses: e.g., reﬂection at the surface, shielding due to the wires deposited over the
surface, electron-hole recombinations, lateral resistance in the semiconductor, series
39The solar constant is calculated in Prob. 7.1.
40In this matter, air mass (AM) indicates the length of the optical path, through earth’s atmosphere,
of light rays coming from an extraterrestrial source. The parameter is used to quantify the
attenuation due to absorption and scattering. The AM value at sea level, when the source is at
the zenith, is set equal to unity and used as normalization parameter.

resistance of the wires.41 To date (2017), the maximum efﬁciency of commercial
solar cells made of crystalline materials is about 24%.
It is worth pointing out that the ﬁgures indicated so far refer to single-junction
cells, in which a single band gap exists: such cells cannot absorb the part of the
spectrum whose energy is below the band gap itself, and have a limited efﬁciency
in absorbing photons whose energy is much higher than the band gap. For instance,
the maximum wavelength that can be absorbed by silicon at room temperature is
M D h c

that belongs to the near infrared. A multi-junction cell consists of a stack of two
or more single-junction cells, each with a different band gap; this arrangement is
able to absorb a larger fraction of the spectrum, making the maximum theoretical
efﬁciency to reach 42% or 49% in a two-cell or three-cell stack, respectively.
Another parameter that inﬂuences the efﬁciency of the solar cell is temperature.
In the normal functioning of a cell, temperature reaches about 350 K due to
the combined effect of the exposure to sunlight and of the internal losses; even
higher temperatures are reached when light concentrators are used. The increase
in temperature degrades the cell’s efﬁciency; from a thermodynamic viewpoint this
was expected, because the cell can be thought of as an engine that delivers energy by
working between two temperatures: the larger one, TH, is that of the sun, the lower
one, TL, is that of cell itself. In turn, the efﬁciency of a real engine cannot exceed
that of a reversible engine, 1  TL=TH [47, Sect. III-9].
A more detailed analysis shows that an increase in temperature makes VOC and,
consequently, VMP, to decrease. This shows, in passing, that the ﬁll factor (21.133)
is not an efﬁciency: the I.V/ curve may deform in a way that makes the product
VMP IMP, hence the efﬁciency, to decrease, without altering the ﬁll factor.

Equivalent Circuit of the P-N-P BJT (Single Generator)

(21.136)
IC D Œ.a22 C a12/ FC C IUC C a21 .FE  FC/ ;

41Due to the need of minimizing at the same time the shielding effect and the series resistance, the
total area and layout of the wiring over the top surface of a solar cell must be optimized carefully.

subsequent transformation, and remembering that IB D IE C IC, the emitter contact
is split into two branches: the upper branch belongs to the loop that closes into
the collector, while the lower branch belongs to the loop that closes into the base.
A replica of the single-generator equivalent circuit is shown in the lower part of

Comment on the Diffusion Length
The analysis of the p-n junction and of the BJT carried out in this chapter has
shown that the diffusion length of the minority carriers plays an important role in
determining the spatial behavior of the carrier concentration. Refer for instance to
the n-type quasi-neutral region of a p-n junction, whose extent is assumed to be
large enough to make the asymptotic condition applicable (Sect. 21.2.1); letting the
origin of x coincide with the boundary between the quasi-neutral and space-charge
regions (Fig. 21.6), the hole concentration reads
p D pn0 C Ap exp.x=Lp/ ;
Lp D
p
p Dp :
(21.141)
Thus, Lp determines the rate of decay of the minority-carrier concentration toward
the asymptotic value. The expression of Lp shows that the diffusion length is in
fact the result of two competing mechanisms, thermal recombination and diffusion.
In the weak-injection approximation (21.25), the net thermal recombination rate
is dictated by p only; in the p ! 0 limit it must be p ! pn0 to prevent the
left-hand side of (21.25) from diverging. Without the limit, when the lifetime is
small the minority-carrier concentration is kept close to the equilibrium value; if, at
the same time, the diffusion coefﬁcient Dp is small, the hole current density Jp D
q Dp dp=dx and average velocity, related to the former by Jp D q p vp, are also
small. In these conditions, the holes entering the quasi-neutral region at x D 0
move slowly and recombine quickly, thus providing a spatially rapid decay to the
asymptotic value; this is rendered by (21.141), where Lp is small. The reasoning can
be repeated using other combinations of the values of p and Dp. Also, it can easily

598
21

be proven from (21.141) that Lp is the average value of the inverse function x D x.p/
(Prob. 21.13); thus, Lp can be thought of as the average distance traveled by a hole
within the quasi-neutral region before recombining.

MOS Devices
22.1
Introduction
The mathematical model of semiconductor devices, derived in Chap. 19, is applied
here to the description of two fundamental devices of the insulated-gate type:
the MIS capacitor, whose most important implementation is the MOS capacitor,
and the IGFET, whose most important implementation is the MOSFET. Both
devices can be realized starting from either a p-doped or an n-doped substrate.
The analysis of the MOS capacitor is carried out using the simple example of
a one-dimensional device in steady state, with the hypotheses of nondegeneracy
and complete ionization, that lend themselves to an analytical treatment. Observing
that in a steady-state condition the device is in equilibrium, the theory needs the
solution of Poisson’s equation only. From the solution of the latter, the device’s
capacitance is calculated, followed by a number of other important relations,
that are useful in the subsequent treatment of the MOSFET. The functioning of
the photocapacitor is worked out thereafter, by combining the analysis of the
MOS capacitor with that of the storage-mode photodiode illustrated in Chap. 21.
The theory of the MOSFET is then tackled in two dimensions and in steady-
state conditions, ﬁrst deriving a general expression for the channel current that
holds in the case of a well-formed channel. The calculation is then completed by
introducing the gradual-channel approximation: the differential conductances are
derived ﬁrst, followed by the expression of the drain current as a function of the
applied voltages. A further simpliﬁcation leads to the linear-parabolic model, which
is widely used in the semiqualitative analyses of circuits. Then, still basing upon
the linear-parabolic model, the input-output characteristic of the CMOS inverter
is derived. The complements address the solution of the Poisson equation in the
channel when a nonequilibrium condition holds, to provide a formal proof of the
relation between the surface and quasi-Fermi potentials used in the gradual-channel
approximation; then, a few phenomena that are not accounted for by the gradual-
channel approximation are discussed, and the neglect of the dependence on position

of the average carrier mobility is justiﬁed. Finally, the theory of the MOSFET is
worked out again after disposing of the hypothesis of a well-formed channel; in
this way, the subthreshold operation of the device is described. This chapter is
concluded by the illustration of the scaling rules applied to the miniaturization of
semiconductor devices, and by a brief account on the design procedures typically
adopted in the integrated-circuit production.
22.2
Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Capacitor
The Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) capacitor is a fundamental device that
constitutes the basis for the ﬁeld-effect transistors used in the fabrication of
integrated circuits. The device has also extensively been used for studying the
properties of semiconductor surfaces [128]. A one-dimensional version of it is
sketched in Fig. 22.1: the structure is fabricated by depositing or thermally growing
(Chap. 24) an insulator layer over a semiconductor substrate. The fabrication
process must obtain an electrically clean interface; in fact, the number of localized
electronic states at the interface must be kept to a minimum to avoid carrier trapping-
detrapping processes. The contact deposited onto the insulator is called gate contact,
the other one is called bulk contact.
In the standard silicon technology, the insulator is obtained by thermally growing
silicon dioxide (Sect. 24.2). For this reason, the thickness of the insulator is indicated
in the following with tox instead of the generic symbol ti used in Fig. 22.1; by
the same token, the insulator’s permittivity is indicated with "ox, and the device is
called MOS capacitor. In the last years, the progressive scaling down in the size of
semiconductor devices has brought the insulator thickness to the range of nanome-
ters. A smaller thickness has the advantage of providing a larger capacitance;
however, it may eventually lead to dielectric breakdown and leakage by quantum

tunneling. Silicon dioxide, which has been used as a gate insulator for decades, is
being replaced in advanced devices with insulating layers made of materials having
a larger permittivity (high-k dielectrics). Such layers are obtained by deposition
(Sect. 24.5). Still with reference to the silicon technology, the conductive layers are
made of metals, heavily doped polycrystalline silicon, or metal silicides; here they
will be indicated with the generic term “metal.”
Like in the case of p-n junctions, the theory of the MOS capacitor is carried
out with reference to a simpliﬁed structure, where the device is one dimensional
and aligned with the x axis; in this case the semiconductor–insulator interface is
a plane normal to x and, as shown in Fig. 22.1, its position is made to coincide
with the reference’s origin. A constant dopant concentration is present in the
semiconductor region; to further simplify the analytical approach one also assumes
that the conditions of nondegeneracy and complete ionization hold.
To describe the functioning of the device it is necessary to consider the fact that
in a region where the important electric phenomena occur, different materials are
brought into an intimate contact. With reference to Fig. 22.2, the three materials
(gate metal, oxide, and semiconductor) are initially considered separate from each
other, and in the equilibrium condition. The left part of the ﬁgure shows the
conduction band of the metal, with Em
C the band’s lower edge and Em
F the metal’s
Fermi level. Due to the form of the Fermi-Dirac statistics, the probability that an
electron’s energy exceeds Em
F is small; remembering the discussion of Sect. 7.2, the
minimum energy necessary for an electron to transit from the metal into vacuum
is the metal work function W D E0  Em
F , with E0 the vacuum level (left part
of Fig. 22.2). For an insulator or a semiconductor, the electrons with maximum
energy belong to states in the vicinity of the lower edge of the conduction band,
Eox
C (center) or EC (right); in this case the minimum energy necessary for transiting
into vacuum is the electron afﬁnity Aox D E0Eox
C or A D E0EC, respectively. The
semiconductor considered in the ﬁgure is uniformly doped of the p type, as shown
by the fact that the Fermi level is below the intrinsic Fermi level EFi (Sect. 18.4.2).
However, the analysis carried out here applies also to a semiconductor of the n type.

When the materials are brought into contact, they form a single, nonuniform
system; as a consequence, in the equilibrium condition the Fermi levels must align
with each other. On the other hand, the vacuum levels must align as well, and the
bands must adapt to compensate for a possible charge redistribution that occurs
when the materials contact each other. The situation is similar to that represented
in Fig. 21.3 for the p-n junction. The values of the parameters W; A; : : : selected for
drawing Fig. 22.2 fulﬁll the relation
W  A D EC  EF :
(22.1)
As a consequence, there is no need for the bands to modify their shape; as shown in
Fig. 22.3, which represents the situation after the materials have been brought into
contact, the bands do not deform. The condition where the semiconductor’s bands
are everywhere parallel to the Fermi level is indicated with ﬂat-band condition.1 It is
important to remark that condition (22.1) seldom occurs in realistic cases; however,
as shown below, the case W  A ¤ EC  EF is easily incorporated into the analysis.
When the bulk contact is considered, Figs. 22.2 and 22.3 must be completed
by adding the band structure of the contact’s material to the right of that of the
semiconductor. Assuming that the gate and bulk contacts are made of the same
material, the structure to be added is identical to that already present on the left part
of the ﬁgures. In the interior of each material, due to spatial uniformity, the electric
potential is piecewise constant, thus the electric ﬁeld is zero.
Consider now the case where a voltage VG is applied between the gate and bulk
contacts; the voltage reference is such that VG > 0 when the electric potential of
the gate contact is larger than that of the bulk contact, and vice versa. In steady-
state conditions, the insulator prevents a current from ﬂowing through the device;
therefore, during the transient consequent to the application of VG, the electric

charge adjusts itself to the new boundary conditions. At the end of the transient
the device is again in an equilibrium condition, while the form of the bands is
different from that of Fig. 22.3. Similarly, the electric potential in the oxide and
semiconductor is not constant any longer; its form is found by solving the Poisson
equation in each region.
22.2.1
Surface Potential—P-Type Substrate
The solution of the Poisson equation in the semiconductor region follows the same
pattern as for the p-n junction (Sect. 21.2.1). Here a uniformly p-doped region
is considered; its extension along the x axis is large, so that, far away from the
semiconductor–insulator interface, the semiconductor behaves as if it were isolated.
This ﬁxes the carrier-equilibrium concentrations in the bulk; the asymptotic value
of the electric potential is set to zero, '.C1/ D 0 whence, remembering that the
nondegeneracy and complete-ionization conditions hold, it is

which must be solved numerically because it has no analytical solution.2 Much
information, however, is gained directly from (22.5), without the need of integrat-
ing (22.6). To this purpose, one notes that the electric potential is continuous at
the semiconductor–oxide interface; in fact, the normalized charge density in the
semiconductor (22.3) has no charge layers in it, hence it cannot contribute to a
double charge layer at the interface. As a consequence, one can adopt the same
symbol 's for the electric potential at x D 0, without distinguishing between the
two sides of the interface; 's is called surface potential, whilst us D q 's=.kB T/ is
the normalized surface potential. In contrast, the electric ﬁeld is discontinuous at
the same interface; for this reason, one deﬁnes

The relation between Es and Eox is found by considering a cylinder of thickness c
placed across the semiconductor–oxide interface, such that the unit vector nR normal
to the right face is parallel to the unit vector i of the x axis, whereas the unit vector
nL normal to the left face is antiparallel to i (Fig. 22.4). Letting Ae be the common
area of the two faces, the total charge within the cylinder is Ae Q, with Q the charge
per unit area. Integrating div D D % over the cylinder’s volume and using (A.23)

layers on the semiconductor’s side; as for the oxide layer, in principle it should
be free of charges, although some contaminants may be present (Sect. 24.1). Here
it is assumed that the oxide is free of charge; in conclusion, letting the cylinder’s
thickness c go to zero, one obtains Q ! 0, whence, using the limits (22.7),

To ﬁnd Eox one observes that in a one-dimensional medium free of charge the
electric potential is linear, whence Eox is given by the negative potential drop across
the oxide divided by the oxide thickness tox. To complete the analysis it is then
necessary to consider the interface between oxide and gate metal.
In the interior of the metal the electric potential is uniform; its value with respect
to the metal of the bulk contact is VG. However, in the solution of the Poisson
equation within the semiconductor, the asymptotic condition '.C1/ D 0 has been
chosen, which holds inside the semiconductor region; the surface potential 's is
referred to such a zero as well. If (22.1) holds, the distinction between bulk contact
and bulk semiconductor does not matter because the electric potential is the same;
however, in the realistic cases it is not so, whence VG and 's are referred to two
different zeros. Assuming that the interior of the oxide and the semiconductor–
oxide interface are free of charge, and remembering the discussion carried out in
Sect. 21.2.2, the difference between the external zero (namely, that within the bulk
contact) and the internal zero (given by the asymptotic condition) is the built-in
potential ˚mp between the bulk contact and the p-type semiconductor; thus, the gate
voltage referred to the internal zero is V0
G D VG  ˚mp. Also, the electric potential
is continuous across the interface between the oxide and the gate metal, because no
double layer is present there. In contrast, as E D 0 within the metal while Eox ¤ 0,
the electric ﬁeld is generally discontinuous; in fact, a charge layer of density
%m D Qm ı.x C t

(22.10)
with Qm the charge per unit area of the metal, builds up at the gate-metal’s surface.

In conclusion, (22.12) provides the relation between surface potential and gate volt-
age. When 's D 0, the electric potential vanishes everywhere in the semiconductor,
namely, V0
G D 0 corresponds to the ﬂat-band condition. When V0
G > 0, the charge
in the gate metal is positive; as a consequence, the left-hand side of (22.12) is
positive as well, whence V0
G > 's and the positive sign must be chosen at the right-
hand side. The opposite happens when V0
G < 0. An example of the 's D 's.V0

The 's D 's.V0
G/ relation lends itself to identifying different functioning regimes
of the MOS capacitor. This identiﬁcation can be carried out more accurately basing
upon the values of the electron and hole concentrations at the semiconductor surface,
ns D n.x D 0/ and ps D p.x D 0/. In the nondegenerate conditions considered here,
the expressions of the surface concentrations read

(22.15)
where uF D .1=2/ log.pp0=np0/ ' log.NA=ni/ > 0: Depending on the value
of us, several functioning regimes are identiﬁed, which are listed in Table 22.1.
The regimes’ designations are given by comparing the carrier concentrations at the

face concentration (holes, in the example used here) exceeds the asymptotic one; the
regime is called accumulation. When us D 0, both majority- and minority-carrier
concentrations equal the corresponding asymptotic concentrations everywhere, and
the already-mentioned ﬂat-band condition holds. For 0 < us < uF, the majority-
carrier concentration is smaller than the asymptotic one, while the minority-carrier
concentration is smaller than the intrinsic one. By continuity, the majority-carrier
concentrations is smaller than the asymptotic one not only at the semiconductor’s
surface, but also in a ﬁnite region of width xd, which is therefore depleted from
carriers; for this reason, the condition 0 < us < uF is called depletion regime, and
xd is called depletion width.3 When us D uF, both majority- and minority-carrier
concentrations at the surface equal the intrinsic concentration; remembering that
in an intrinsic semiconductor the Fermi level practically coincides with the gap’s
3The depletion width xd is conceptually the same thing as the extension lp of the space-charge
region on the p side of a metallurgical junction (Sect. 21.2.2). A different symbol is used to avoid
confusion in the analysis of the MOSFET (Sect. 22.8).

midpoint (Sect. 18.3), this regime is called mid gap. When uF < us < 2 uF, the
minority-carrier concentration at the surface exceeds that of the majority carriers;
however, it is still lower than the asymptotic concentration of the majority carriers:
the regime is called weak inversion. When us D 2 uF, the surface concentration of
the minority carriers equals the asymptotic concentration of the majority carriers,
and vice versa; the regime is called threshold of the strong inversion, or simply
threshold. Finally, when us > 2 uF, the minority-carrier concentration at the surface
exceeds the asymptotic concentration of the majority carriers, and the regime is
called strong inversion. In Fig. 22.5 the normalized surface potential at threshold,
2 uF, is marked by the horizontal bar; one notes that in the strong-inversion regime
the surface potential rapidly saturates as the gate voltage increases.
The form of the electric potential and charge density is shown in Fig. 22.6 for
the accumulation regime. The upper part of the ﬁgure shows the charge density,
which is schematically represented by a negative charge layer at the metal-oxide
interface and by the thicker, positive layer at the semiconductor oxide interface.
The lower part of the ﬁgure shows the electric potential along with the band structure
of the semiconductor; note that two different vertical axes are used, in such a way
that energy increases upwards and the electric potential increases downwards. The
zero of the electric potential coincides with the horizontal part of the dashed line
(in fact, here it is V0
G < 's < 0). The mid-gap condition, V0
G > 0, 's D 'F, is
illustrated in Fig. 22.7, whose general description is similar to that of Fig. 22.6; here
the charge layer on the gate metal is positive and balances the negative charge of
the semiconductor. Due to the depletion that occurs in the region adjacent to the

semiconductor–oxide interface, the charge density is dominated by the contribution
from the negative acceptor ions, % ' q NA. In the ﬁgure, the charge density of
the semiconductor is schematically indicated by the shaded area, that corresponds
to a charge per unit area equal to q NA xd. Finally, Fig. 22.8 shows the form of
the electric potential and charge density for the threshold condition, V0
G > 0, 's D
2 'F. Again, the general description is similar to that of Figs. 22.6 and 22.7; here,
there are two contributions to the negative charge of the semiconductor: the ﬁrst one
comes from the contribution of the negative acceptor ions, whose charge density is
schematically indicated by the shaded area of width xd (note that due to the larger
value of VG, the depletion width is larger than that of the mid-gap condition). The
second contribution to the semiconductor’s charge is due to the electrons, whose
concentrations at the interface or near it is sufﬁciently large to be signiﬁcant; they
form a negative layer, called inversion layer, whose width, albeit larger than that of
the positive layer located at the metal-oxide interface,4 is much smaller than xd.
Numerical solutions of the semiconductor-device model show that, with the
exception of the accumulation regime, the semiconductor region of a uniformly
doped MOS capacitor can be partitioned into a space-charge and a quasi-neutral
region; the quasi-neutral region behaves as an isolated, uniform semiconductor,
4The width of the region where the charged layer at the metal-oxide interface is signiﬁcant is of
the order of 1 nm. That of an inversion layer is of the order of 5 nm; an example is given below,
with reference to Fig. 22.14.

When accumulation is excluded, in a p-substrate capacitor one must take us > 0.

from (22.5), whose limiting case in the depletion and weak-inversion regimes is

to note that a relation identical to (22.30) is obtained using the full-depletion and

Flat-Band Voltage
The theory worked out so far was initially based on the assumption that rela-
tion (22.1) holds between the gate metal’s work function, the semiconductor’s
afﬁnity, and the position of the semiconductor’s Fermi level with respect to the
band edges. The assumption was then removed and, to account for the possibility
that W  A ¤ EC  EF, the difference V0
G D VG  ˚mp has been used to
replace VG when the gate voltage referred to the bulk semiconductor is to be
considered, with ˚mp the built-in potential between the bulk contact and the p-
type semiconductor (Sect. 22.2.1). This outcome is better understood with the aid
of Fig. 22.3, where the electron afﬁnity A of the semiconductor is larger than that
used in Fig. 22.3, so that W  A < EC  EF. As shown in the ﬁgure, the distance
between the Fermi level of the metal and the vacuum level is prescribed by W;
such a distance is the same everywhere in the metal, because the interior of the
latter is equipotential. In turn, the distance between the vacuum level and the edge
of the semiconductor’s conduction band, at the semiconductor–oxide interface, is
prescribed by A. This forces the conduction band’s edge to come nearer to the Fermi
level; in this way, the band’s edge shift downwards with respect to its position in the
semiconductor bulk, whose distance from the Fermi level (marked with E1

of electrons, which in the nondegenerate and complete-ionization condition reads
n D NC expŒ.EC  EF/=.kB T/ (Sect. 18.4), is larger at the semiconductor–oxide
interface than in the bulk; in fact, when the materials are connected, a number
of electrons ﬂow from the metal to the semiconductor, leaving behind a layer of
positive charge at the metal–oxide interface (Fig. 22.12).9
The analysis is completed by supposing that a ﬁxed charge density %ox.x/ is
present in the oxide. If this is the case, it is not correct to assume that the electric
potential is linear within the oxide; however, (22.11) still holds by giving Eox the
meaning of average oxide ﬁeld. The Poisson equation in the oxide is readily solved
using the procedure shown in Prob. 4.1; from "ox '00 D %ox one ﬁnds

9When the materials are put together, the ﬂow of electrons from the metal to the semiconductor,
or vice versa, occurs thanks to the electric connection between the gate and bulk contacts provided
by the external voltage generator. This connection makes it possible to establish the condition of
thermal equilibrium of the whole system. If the contacts were left open, no ﬂow of charge would
be possible (apart from the occurrence of tunneling events across the oxide which, given enough
time, would be able to restore equilibrium), and the Fermi level of each material would keep the
value it possessed when the materials were still separate; this situation would be similar to that of
two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, separated by a thermal insulator.

The constant voltage VFB is called ﬂat-band voltage. The designation is due to the
fact that letting VG D VFB establishes the ﬂat-band condition in the semiconductor.
It is possible that a ﬁxed layer of charge is also present in the oxide, in addition to
%ox; its effect on VFB is readily incorporated into the analysis leading to (22.37) by
adding to %ox a term of the form Qf ı.x  h/, with Qf the charge per unit area of the
layer (compare with Prob. 4.5).
Deﬁnition (22.37) of VFB does not account for the fact that, besides the ﬁxed
charge, mobile charges may be present within the oxide or at the semiconductor–
oxide interface. The former type of mobile charges is typically made of con-
taminants (Sect. 24.1); they may become mobile at temperatures slightly larger
than room temperature, thus making VFB unstable. Consequently, the threshold
voltage (22.85) or (22.113) of the MOS transistor becomes unstable as well. The
charge at the semiconductor–oxide interface is due in turn to a distribution of
interfacial electronic states, called surface states, whose energy belongs to the band
gap. Such states are due to the disruption of periodicity caused by the ﬁniteness of
the crystal’s size. In a bare silicon crystal the surface concentration of surface states
turns out to be equal to that of the atoms themselves [4]; in silicon, the latter is
about .5:0  1022/2=3 ' 1:36  1015 cm2 (Sect. 24.2). When the semiconductor–
oxide interface is considered, instead, the concentration of surface states is much
smaller; the typical ﬁgures for the silicon–oxide interface range from 109 to 1011
cm2, depending on the quality of the oxide growth’s process and on the subsequent
annealing steps.
In the following it is assumed that the effect of the mobile charges described here
is negligible. Also, the analysis carried out in this section shows that the presence
of a ﬁxed charge density %ox merely shift V0
G by a constant amount. For this reason,
from now on symbol V0
G will be given the more general meaning V0
G D VG  VFB.

Fig. 22.14, where the dependence on position of n and NA  p is drawn for a p-
substrate MOS capacitor with NA D 1016 cm3 in the strong-inversion regime
(us D 2:5 uF). The term .NA  p/=pp0 is signiﬁcant in a surface region of the
semiconductor, whose thickness is several units of x=LA. The term n=pp0 is much
larger, but only in a much thinner region near the surface. If the width of the
inversion layer is conventionally taken at the intersection between the two curves
of Fig. 22.14, that occurs at x=LA ' 0:1, one ﬁnds from (22.38) a width of about
5 nm.
With reference to Fig. 22.2, and using aluminum as metal and silicon as

of the device is shown in Fig. 22.15, where the case of a uniform, p-substrate

while the black dots indicate the electrons and the white dot indicates a hole.
The considerations about the use of a one-dimensional structure and of a partially
transparent contact are the same as in Sect. 21.6. The resistor shown in the ﬁgure
mimics the input resistance of the circuit that measures the photocapacitor’s current.
The applied voltage V.t/ is periodically switched between the ﬂat-band voltage
VFB and a value VGI that, in the steady-state condition, corresponds to strong
inversion. The time extent Ts during which the applied voltage equals VFB is called
sampling time, while the time extent Ti during which the applied voltage equals
VGI is called integration time. It is assumed that prior to the switching from VFB to
www.ebook3000.com

622
22
MOS Devices
VGI the earlier transients have vanished, so that the net local charge is negligible.10
As the applied voltage has a step-like form, the majority carries (holes) are pushed
away from the semiconductor–insulator interface and a depleted region of width xd
is formed in a negligible time after the application of the gate voltage; observing
that the inversion layer is not present yet, the value of xd is found by combining the
ﬁrst relation in (22.32) with (22.33), namely,
xd D

VGI  VFB C .=2/2  =2 ;
(22.40)
with NA the constant concentration of the acceptor dopant. Due to the absence of
the inversion layer, the value of xd rendered by (22.40) is considerably larger than
the one that would correspond to the equilibrium condition. During the integration
time, an inversion layer is built up by the combined contributions of the thermal
and optical generations in the depleted region; thus, xd gradually decreases while
the modulus of the inverted charge increases. When the gate voltage is switched
back to VFB, the majority carriers ﬂood the depleted region, which disappears in a
time of the order of that required by a hole to reach the interface; as this time is
negligible, the form of the inversion layer is not initially affected by the process. On
the other hand, as the disappearing of the depleted region makes the electric ﬁeld to
vanish, the electrons of the inversion layer diffuse toward the substrate and, at the
same time, recombine with the holes; this, in turn, produces a current in the external
circuit. Under the typical operating conditions of the device, the contribution of
optical generation to the inversion layer is dominant with respect to that of thermal
generation; it follows that the measured current is essentially due to the illumination,
whereas the effect of thermal generation superimposed to it can be considered as a
noise signal.
Like in the case of the storage-mode photodiode (Sect. 21.6.2), it is important to
identify the order of magnitude of the integration and sampling times. While the
former can be made relatively small, the latter cannot be reduced below the limit
necessary for the inversion layer to disappear completely; if, in fact, at the moment
of the gate voltage’s switching from VFB to VGI, a fraction of the electron charge
was still present in the semiconductor, it would add to the one generated in the next
integration cycle, thus introducing an error in the measured signal.
To analyze the semiconductor’s behavior during the sampling time one must
solve the minority-carrier continuity equation, whose one-dimensional form reads

In the above it is assumed for simplicity that the weak-injection condition holds
(Sect. 20.2.3), and that the absorption coefﬁcient k (Sect. 20.4) is constant with
respect to both position and radiation frequency. Remembering (20.67), it is Gs D
 ˚B k exp.k s/, where ˚B is the ﬂux density of the photons on the inside edge of
the contact–oxide interface; the exponential exp.k s/ accounts for the absorption
within the oxide, whose thickness is s (the origin is placed at the semiconductor–
oxide interface). The integral of the minority-carrier excess concentration n  np0
over the semiconductor thickness L provides the excess charge Q per unit area at
time t; observing that Jn.x D 0/ D 0 due to the presence of the oxide, and that L is
large enough to yield Jn.L/ ' Jn.1/ D 0, the integration of (22.41) over L renders

The above result shows that the approach to the asymptotic condition12 is
dominated by the minority-carrier lifetime n. The process can be made considerably
shorter by building the photocapacitor in a p-type epitaxial layer13 of thickness
a grown over an n-type substrate (Fig. 22.16). From a qualitative standpoint, the
advantage of this implementation is that the heavily doped nC substrate acts as
a contact, so that the excess charge is expected to vanish in the short time that
is necessary to diffuse across a. On the other hand, in this case the asymptotic
condition Jn.L/ D 0 does not hold anymore; to determine the time decay of Q
one must then solve the continuity equation

11It is assumed that the minimum period of variation of the photon ﬂux density is small with respect
to n, so that in the integration of (22.42) Gs can be considered a constant.
12Note that in the asymptotic limit the excess charge does not vanish; in fact it is Q.1/ D

MOS Capacitor—N-Type Substrate
The theory of the n-substrate MOS capacitor is similar to that of the p-substrate one,
and is brieﬂy illustrated in this section. A constant concentration ND of donor atoms
is assumed, such that the nondegeneracy and complete-ionization conditions hold.
The value of the electric potential is set to zero in the bulk of the semiconductor,

The opposite happens when V0

Like in the p-substrate case, the 's D 's.V0
G/ relation lends itself to identifying
different functioning regimes of the MOS capacitor. The identiﬁcation is carried out
basing upon the values of the electron and hole concentrations at the semiconductor
surface, ns D n.x D 0/ and ps D p.x D 0/. In the nondegenerate conditions
considered here, the expressions of the surface concentrations are given by (22.15),
where uF D .1=2/ log.pn0=nn0/ ' log.ni=ND/ < 0: The functioning regimes
are listed in Table 22.2; their designations are given by comparing the carrier
concentrations at the surface with the intrinsic and asymptotic ones. The discussion
about functioning regimes, depletion width, form of the electric potential and charge
density, and differential capacitance is similar to that of the p-substrate case.
To obtain a simpliﬁed form of the inversion layer’s charge that holds in all the
functioning regimes with the exception of accumulation, one recasts (22.59) as

shown in normalized units in Fig. 22.17. When accumulation is excluded, in an n-

A relation identical to (22.62) is obtained using the full-depletion and ASCE

Insulated-Gate Field-Effect Transistor—MOSFET
The principle of the insulated-gate, ﬁeld-effect transistor (IGFET) was demonstrated
in the early 1930s [128, Chap. 10]. The ﬁrst structures using a thermally oxidized
silicon layer were fabricated in 1960. The IGFET architecture using silicon dioxide
as gate dielectric is more commonly called MOSFET. This device architecture,
jointly with the continuous improvements in the silicon technology, made it possible
the tremendous progress in the fabrication of integrated circuits during the last
decades, and is the most common component in digital and analog circuits.
The electric current in a MOSFET is transported by one type of carriers only,
electrons or holes; for this reason the device is called unipolar. In a p-substrate
device, the carriers are the electrons that form the charge layer at the semiconductor–
insulator interface; therefore, this type of transistor is called n-channel MOSFET.
Conversely, in an n-substrate device the carriers are holes, and the transistor is
called p-channel MOSFET. The schematic cross-section of an n-channel MOSFET
is shown in Fig. 22.18. The starting point is a p-type silicon substrate, with an
NA D const dopant concentration, onto which a layer of silicon dioxide is thermally
grown and patterned; then, the gate contact (G) is deposited. The extension Lg of
the gate metal in the horizontal direction is called geometrical length of the gate.
The next step is the introduction of a heavy dose of an n-type dopant on the two
sides of the gate. As shown in the ﬁgure, lateral diffusion (Sect. 23.8.3) makes the
gate oxide to partially overlap the n-doped regions.16
The metallizations of the nC regions provide two more contacts, called source (S)
and drain (D); the bottom metal layer contacting the p-type substrate is indicated
with bulk (B), and the term channel denotes the interfacial semiconductor region
between the two junctions. To distinguish the applied voltages from one another,
two letters are used; considering the bulk metallization as the reference contact, in
an n-channel MOSFET a typical choice of the three independent voltages is VGB D
VGVB, VSB D VSVB, and VDB D VDVB. As the standard MOSFET architecture
is structurally symmetric, it is not possible to distinguish the source contact from
16The n-type regions are typically obtained by ion implantation, whose lateral penetration is
limited. However, ion implantation is followed by a thermal process (annealing), during which
thermal diffusion takes place.

the drain contact basing on geometry or dopant distribution: the distinction is to be
based on the applied voltages; in fact, in the typical operating regime of the device
the source-bulk and drain-bulk junctions are never forward biased, whence in an
n-channel MOSFET it is VSB  0 and VDB  0. The drain contact is identiﬁed17 by
the condition VDB  VSB D VDS > 0.
22.8
N-Channel MOSFET—Current-Voltage Characteristics
To work out the theory of the MOSFET, one introduces a reference whose x axis is
normal to the semiconductor–insulator interface, while the y axis is parallel to it. The
origin (O) is placed at the intersection of the source p-n junction and the interface
(Fig. 22.18). The y coordinate corresponding to the intersection of the drain p-n
junction and the interface is indicated with L; the latter is called electric length of
the gate, or channel length. The device is considered uniform in the z direction; its
width along such a direction is indicated with W.
Purpose of the analysis is to derive the steady-state characteristics, namely, the
relations between the currents at the contacts and the applied voltages. To proceed,
one assumes that the gate voltage VGB is such that at all positions y along the
channel the strong-inversion condition holds. Thus, a layer of electrons is present,
indicated in Fig. 22.18 with the shaded area underneath the gate oxide; the term
17In fact, in some types of logic circuits the source and drain contact may exchange their roles
depending on the applied voltages.

22.8
N-Channel MOSFET—Current-Voltage Characteristics

well-formed channel is used to denote this situation. The minimum gate voltage
necessary for obtaining a well-formed channel will be identiﬁed later. In a steady-
state condition there is no current through the gate contact because the gate insulator
is in series to it; also, the current ﬂowing through the bulk contact is negligibly small
because the two junctions are never forward biased. Since the channel layer connects
two heavily doped regions of the n type, the application of a drain-source voltage
VDS > 0 gives rise to a current ID that ﬂows from the drain to the source contact (its
reference is shown in Fig. 22.18); for a given VDS, the drain current ID is controlled
by the amount of charge available in the channel, which is in turn controlled by
the gate voltage VGB. In other terms, the device is an electronic valve in which the
gate-bulk port controls the current ﬂowing into the drain-source port; moreover,
in the steady-state condition the control port does not expend energy, because the
gate current is zero. This, among other things, explains the success of the MOSFET
concept.
Due to the uniformity in the z direction, the electron and hole current densities
have the form
Jn D Jnx i C Jny j ;
Jp D Jpx i C Jpy j ;
(22.66)
with i, j the unit vectors of the x and y axes, respectively. On the other hand, it
is Jnx D Jpx D 0 because no current can ﬂow through the insulator, so only the
y components Jny, Jpy are left in (22.66). In turn, the condition of a well-formed
channel implies that the concentration of holes is negligibly small with respect to
that of the electrons,18 whence jJnyj  jJpyj. It follows J D Jn C Jp ' Jn D
Jny.x; y/ j. The equality J D Jn is the mathematical form of the MOSFET’s property
of being unipolar. It also entails div J D div Jn; therefore, remembering that in a
steady-state condition it is div J D 0, it follows that div Jn D 0 as well.
Consider now two planes parallel to the x; z plane, placed at different positions y1
and y2 in the channel; their intersections with the x; y plane are respectively marked
with S1 and S2 in Fig. 22.18. From the divergence theorem (A.23) and the property
div Jn D 0 it follows19

is independent of y. The last form of (22.68) derives from the uniformity in z. To
express Jny in (22.68) it is convenient to adopt the monomial form (19.141) of the
electron current density, Jn D q n n grad 'n, with 'n the electron quasi-Fermi
potential. The components of Jn in monomial form read
Jnx D q n n @'n

Jny D q n n @'n

(22.69)
where Jnx D 0 as found above. In the channel it is n ¤ 0, whence for Jnx to vanish

In (22.72), e and Qi are positive- and negative-deﬁnite, respectively, and I, W are
constant; it follows that d'n=dy has always the same sign and, as a consequence,
'n.y/ is invertible. Using the inverse function y D y.'n/ within e and Qi

22.8.1
Gradual-Channel Approximation
In the derivation of (22.74) the condition of a well-formed channel has not been
exploited yet; this condition makes a number of approximations possible, which
are collectively indicated with the term gradual-channel approximation;22 they
lead to an expression of (22.74) in closed form. First, one uses the deﬁnition of
surface potential which, in the two-dimensional analysis considered here, is given
by 's.y/ D '.x D 0; y/; it is shown in Sect. 22.11.1 that the condition of a well-
formed channel entails the relation
's D 'n C 'F :
(22.75)
It follows that d'n=dy in (22.72) can be replaced with d's=dy, thus showing that
the transport in a well-formed channel is dominated by the drift term, Jny D
q n n d's=dy D q n n Esy, with Esy the y-component of the electric ﬁeld at x D 0;
using (22.75) one changes the variable from 'n to 's in the integral of (22.74). The
integration limits in terms of 's are found by the same reasoning leading to (22.75),
and read (Sect. 22.11.1)
's.0/ D VSB C 2 'F ;
's.L/ D VDB C 2 'F :

In conclusion, (22.74) becomes

Qi.'s/ d's :
(22.77)
The next step of the gradual-channel approximation consists in determining the
relation Qi.'s/, for which the solution of the Poisson equation in two dimensions is
necessary. As shown in Sect. 22.11.1, one can exploit the strong difference between
the strengths of the electric-ﬁeld components in the x and y directions, to give the
equation a one-dimensional form in which the y coordinate acts as a parameter. This
is equivalent to assimilating each elementary portion of the channel, like that marked
with dy in Fig. 22.18, to a one-dimensional MOS capacitor whose surface potential
is the local value 's.y/. The ﬁnal step of the gradual-channel approximation is the
adoption of the full-depletion and ASCE approximations (Sect. 21.4), so that the
inversion-layer charge per unit area at position y in the channel is given by (22.34),
22The gradual-channel approximation is not limited to the analysis of the MOSFET shown
here. Indeed, it is a widely used method to treat the Poisson equation in devices in which the
geometrical conﬁguration and applied voltages are such that the variation of the electric ﬁeld in
one direction is much weaker than those in the other two directions. Typically, the former direction
is the longitudinal one (that is, along the channel), the other two the transversal ones. From
the mathematical standpoint, the approximation amounts to eliminating a part of the Laplacian
operator, so that the dependence on all variables but one becomes purely algebraic.

Differential Conductances and Drain Current,
N-Channel
The drain current’s expression (22.78) of the n-channel MOSFET provides a relation
of the form ID D ID.VGB; VDB; VSB/, where VGB D V0
GB C VFB. In the integrated-
circuit operation an important role is played by the differential conductances of
the device, each of them deﬁned as the partial derivative of ID with respect to one
of the applied voltages. In some cases the differential conductances can be found
without the need of actually calculating the integral in (22.78); for this reason,
here such conductances are calculated ﬁrst. Prior to that, it is worth noting that
in circuit applications it is often preferred to use the source contact, instead of the
bulk contact, as a voltage reference. The transformation from one reference to the
other is easily obtained from
VDS D VDB  VSB > 0 ;
VGS D VGB  VSB ;
VBS D VSB  0 :
(22.79)
Then, the drain conductance24 is deﬁned as the derivative of ID with respect to VDB,
at constant VSB and VGB; or, equivalently, as the derivative with respect to VDS, at
constant VBS and VGS:

namely, the drain conductance is proportional to the inversion charge per unit area

construction; its zero corresponds to the value of 's.L/ obtained from (22.33). Such
a zero is indicated with 'sat

and is termed saturation surface potential. From (22.79),
the saturation voltage in the bulk and source references is found to be

saturation current. If a value of VDS larger than Vsat
DS is used, the right-hand side
of (22.81) becomes negative; this result is not physically sound and indicates that
the gradual-channel approximation is not applicable in that voltage range.25
Still considering the drain conductance, it is also important to determine its limit
for VDB ! VSB, or VDS ! 0. Again, there is no need to calculate the integral
in (22.78) which, in this limiting case, is the product of the integration interval VDS
times the integrand calculated in the lower integration limit; in turn, the derivative
eliminates VDS, whence

and VDS is ID D ˇ .VGS  VT/ VDS: there, the current-voltage characteristics are
approximated by straight lines whose slope, for a given VBS, is prescribed by VGS.
At larger values of VDS the limiting case (22.85) does not hold any longer: the slope
of the ID D ID.VDS/ curves decreases, to eventually vanish when VDS reaches Vsat
DS.
Considering that ID is nonnegative, the theory depicted above is applicable as long
as ˇ .VGS  VT/  0; this observation allows one to better specify the condition
of a well-formed channel, used at the beginning: from the formal standpoint the
condition of a well-formed channel is VGS > VT.
25In fact, beyond the saturation voltage the Poisson equation near the drain end of the channel
cannot be reduced anymore to a one-dimensional equation where y is treated as a parameter
(compare with Sect. 22.11.1).

D, where the two
contributions are given by (22.86) and (22.87), provides a fair description of the
drain current up to the saturation voltage. Beyond saturation, the model is not correct
any longer: in fact, the terms with a negative sign within the expression of ID give
rise to a negative slope gD; instead, the experiments show that for VDS > Vsat
DS the
current tends to saturate. For this reason, the analytical model is given a regional
form: for a prescribed pair VGS, VBS, the regional model ﬁrst separates the on
condition VGS > VT from the off condition VGS  VT. The on condition is further
separated into the linear region26 0 < VDS  Vsat
DS, where the drain current is
described by the ID D I0
D  I00
D model worked out above, and the saturation region
VDS > Vsat
DS, where the regional model lets ID D Isat
D . Finally, in the off condition the
model lets ID D 0.
As the threshold voltage deﬁned in (22.85) refers to a p-type substrate, from the
deﬁnition (18.26) of the Fermi potential and the analysis of Sect. 18.4.2 one ﬁnds
2 'F D .kB T=q/ log.pp0=np0/ > 0; on the other hand, the ﬂat-band voltage (22.37)
may have either sign, depending on the materials used. It follows that the threshold
voltage as a whole may have either sign as well. It is then customary to distinguish
two types of n-channel transistors: the enhancement-type ones have VT > 0, so that
a gate voltage VGS > VT > 0 is necessary to achieve the condition of a well-formed
channel, whereas the transistor is in the off condition when VGS D 0; the depletion-
type transistors have VT < 0, so that the condition of a well-formed channel is
already present when VGS D 0, whereas a gate voltage VGS  VT < 0 is necessary
to put the device in the off condition.
For a given bulk-source voltage VBS, the ID D ID.VDS/ curves corresponding to
different values of VGS are called output characteristics. Other types of characteris-
tics are also used to enrich the picture of the MOSFET’s behavior: for instance,
the transfer characteristics are the ID D ID.VGS/ curves drawn using VBS as a
26The term linear originates from the behavior of the curves near the origin, shown by (22.85). The
term is ascribed to the region up to Vsat
DS despite the fact that far away from the origin the curves are
blatantly nonlinear.

limiting case (22.85) hold.
Besides the drain conductance (22.80), two more differential conductances are
deﬁned in a MOSFET: the ﬁrst one is the transconductance gm, given by the
derivative of ID with respect to VGB, at constant VDB and VSB; or, equivalently, as
the derivative with respect to VGS, at constant VDS and VBS. Observing that VGS

The small-signal circuit of an n-channel MOSFET is shown in Fig. 22.19. Since the
circuit is derived from the steady-state transport model, it holds at low frequencies
only. The small-signal voltages are indicated with vDS, vGS, and vBS. The gate
and bulk contacts are left open because the corresponding currents are zero; as
a consequence, iD D iS is the only nonzero small-signal current of the circuit.
Observing that
iD D gD vDS C gm vGS C gB vBS ;
(22.90)
the drain-source branch of the circuit is made of three parallel branches. One of them
is represented as a resistor 1=gD because the current ﬂowing in it is controlled by the
voltage vDS applied to the same port; the other two branches are voltage-controlled
generators because the current of each branch is controlled by the voltage applied
to a different port.
It is worth adding that the body effect mentioned above is actually an incon-
venience, because it introduces a complicate dependence on VBS which must be
accounted for during the circuit’s design. The body effect is suppressed by letting

contact device.27 This solution is adopted whenever the circuit’s architecture allows
for it.
Linear-Parabolic Model, N-Channel
In semiqualitative circuit analyses the whole term I00

a simpliﬁed model ID ' I0

is equivalent to letting  ! 0, it follows gB ' 0 and, from the second relation

P-Channel MOSFET—Current-Voltage Characteristics
The structure of the p-channel MOSFET is dual to that of the n-channel type; with
reference to Fig. 22.18, the cross-section is obtained by exchanging the “p” and
“n” letters. Like in the n-channel device, the applied voltages are distinguished
from one another by means of two letters; considering the bulk metallization as
the reference contact, in a p-channel MOSFET the standard choice of the three
independent voltages is VGB D VG VB, VSB D VS VB, and VDB D VD VB. In the
typical operating regime of the p-channel MOSFET, the source-bulk and drain-bulk
junctions are never forward biased, whence VSB  0 and VDB  0. The drain contact
is identiﬁed by the condition VSB  VDB D VSD > 0.
To derive the steady-state characteristics of the device, one proceeds in the same
manner as for the n-channel MOSFET, i.e., by introducing a reference like in
Fig. 22.18. Next, one assumes that the gate voltage VGB is such that at all positions
y along the channel the strong-inversion condition holds. Thus, a layer of holes is
present, providing the condition of a well-formed channel. Since the channel layer
connects two heavily doped regions of the p type, the application of a source-drain
voltage VSD > 0 gives rise to a current IS that ﬂows from the source to the drain

contact; such a current is indicated in Fig. 22.22, where the symbol of the p-channel
MOSFET of the enhancement type is depicted. For a given VSD, the source current
IS is controlled by the amount of charge available in the channel, which is in turn
controlled by the gate voltage VGB. Like in the n-channel device, one obtains an
electronic valve in which the gate-bulk port controls the current ﬂowing into the
source-drain port; moreover, in the steady-state condition the control port does not
expend energy, because the gate current is zero.
Due to the uniformity in the z direction, the electron and hole current densities
have the form (22.66), with i, j the unit vectors of the x and y axes, respectively. On
the other hand, it is Jnx D Jpx D 0 because no current can ﬂow through the insulator,
so only the y components Jny, Jpy are left in (22.66). In turn, the condition of a well-
formed channel implies that the concentration of electrons is negligibly small with
respect to that of the holes, whence jJpyj  jJnyj. It follows J D Jn C Jp ' Jp D

where Qi is the inversion-layer charge per unit area at position y in the channel.
In (22.99), both h and Qi are positive-deﬁnite, and I, W are constant; it follows
that d'p=dy has always the same sign and, as a consequence, 'p.y/ is invertible.
Using the inverse function y D y.'p/ within h and Qi makes (22.99) separable;

Due to the choice of the reference, which is the same as for the n-channel device, the
positions y D 0 and y D L correspond to the source and drain ends of the channel,
respectively. As the dependence of h on y is weak,29 (22.100) becomes (compare
with (22.74))
I D W

Z 'p.0/

(22.101)
To complete the calculation of (22.101) one makes use of the gradual-channel
approximation, starting from the condition of a well-formed channel. Using the
deﬁnition 's.y/ D '.x D 0; y/ of the surface potential, the latter condition in a
p-channel device reads
's D 'p C 'F :
(22.102)
It follows that d'p=dy in (22.99) can be replaced with d's=dy, that is, transport in
a well-formed channel is dominated by the drift term, Jpy D q p p d's=dy D
q p p Esy, with Esy the y-component of the electric ﬁeld at x D 0; using (22.102)
one changes the variable from 'n to 's in the integral of (22.101). The integration
limits in terms of 's are found by the same reasoning leading to (22.102) and read

coordinate acts as a parameter. This is equivalent to assimilating each elementary
portion of the channel, of width dy, to a one-dimensional, n-substrate MOS capacitor
whose surface potential is the local value 's.y/. Finally, introducing the full-
depletion and ASCE approximations (Sect. 21.4), one ﬁnds the expression of the
inversion-layer charge per unit area at position y in the channel, for a p-channel
MOSFET. The result is similar to that already obtained for a p-substrate capacitor
and is given by (22.65), namely:

Differential Conductances and Drain Current,

The differential conductances are calculated from (22.107) in the same way as for
the n-channel device. Prior to that, one remembers that in circuit applications it is
often preferred to use the source contact, instead of the bulk contact, as a voltage
reference. The transformation from one reference to the other is easily obtained
from

the gradual-channel approximation is not applicable in that voltage range.30 The

and VSD is IS D ˇ .VSG  VT/ VSD: considering that IS is nonnegative, the theory
depicted above is applicable as long as ˇ .VSG  VT/  0; this observation allows
one to better specify the condition of a well-formed channel, used at the beginning:

with a negative sign within the expression of IS give rise to a negative slope gS;
instead, the experiments show that for VSD > Vsat

For this reason, the analytical model is given a regional form: for a prescribed pair

As the threshold voltage deﬁned in (22.113) refers to an n-type substrate, it is
2 'F D .kB T=q/ log.pn0=nn0/ < 0; on the other hand, the ﬂat-band and threshold
voltages may have either sign. Like in the case of the n-channel devices, it is then
customary to distinguish two types of p-channel transistors: the enhancement-type
ones have VT > 0, so that a gate voltage VSG > VT > 0 is necessary to achieve the
condition of a well-formed channel, whereas the transistor is in the off condition
when VSG D 0; the depletion-type transistors have VT < 0, so that the condition
of a well-formed channel is already present when VSG D 0, whereas a gate voltage
VSG  VT < 0 is necessary to put the device in the off condition.
The output characteristics of the p-channel MOSFET are the IS D IS.VSD/ curves
corresponding to different values of VSG, for a given bulk-source voltage VBS; the
transfer characteristics are the IS D IS.VSG/ curves drawn using VBS as a parameter
and letting VSD D const, with a value of VSD small enough to let the limiting
case (22.113) hold.

The CMOS architecture (the designation stands for “Complementary Metal-Oxide-

grated circuits. The scheme of the CMOS inverter, which is the basic structure
of the logic circuits manufactured with this technology, is shown in Fig. 22.23; it
is obtained by connecting a p-channel MOSFET with an n-channel MOSFET, in

such a way that the two gate contacts are connected to each other, and the two
drain contacts are connected to each other. Whenever possible, the bulk contact is
shorted with the source contact of the same device, thus eliminating the body effect
(Sect. 22.8.2); in this case, each MOSFET is described in terms of two voltages
only, instead of three, and the threshold voltages (22.85) and (22.113) reduce to two
constants.31 From the technological standpoint, even the simple arrangement shown
in Fig. 22.23 requires the presence of two different substrates in the same wafer: a
p-type substrate to build the n-channel device, and an n-type substrate to build the
p-channel device. This is achieved, starting from a given wafer, by preliminarily
diffusing a region (called well or tub) of the opposite polarity with respect to that of
the wafer, in which one of the two transistors is then accommodated. An example
of fabrication of the n-well structure in silicon is illustrated in the following.
A CMOS structure can be realized using either the bulk technology, where the
devices are fabricated directly within the silicon wafer, or the silicon on insulator
(SOI) technology, where the devices are fabricated within an epitaxial layer of
crystalline silicon grown on an insulator, e.g., sapphire (Sect. 24.6). The simpler
bulk technology is shown here, with reference to Fig. 22.24. Starting from a lightly
doped, p-type substrate, the area of the well is deﬁned by a suitable mask, and
the well is obtained by implanting n-type dopants.32 The implant is followed by a
thermal process that drives-in the impurities. As the duration of the thermal process
is rather long, the ﬁnal gradient of the impurity concentration is small; this makes the
impurity proﬁle of the well relatively ﬂat. This step is followed by a p-type implant,
called channel stop, in the area that separates the regions where the two transistors
31Elimination of the body effect is possible in simple structures like that shown in Fig. 22.23, where
the source contact of the p-channel MOSFET is connected to the highest voltage of the circuit, and
the source contact of the n-channel MOSFET is connected to the lowest one. However, when the
circuit becomes slightly more complicate like, e.g., in a NAND or a NOR gate, shorting the bulk
and source contact of all devices becomes impossible.
32The terminology of the process steps is better explained in the chapters devoted to the
technological issues.

Fig. 22.24 Cross-section of an n-well CMOS inverter
will be fabricated; to further separate the n-channel from the p-channel transistor,
a thick oxide layer is grown in the area above the channel stop; this layer is called
ﬁeld oxide and is marked with “F.O.” in Fig. 22.24. Purpose of the channel stop and
of the ﬁeld oxide is to prevent the formation of an inversion layer of electrons at the
silicon surface: such a layer, in fact, would form a parasitic channel connecting the
two transistors. As shown in the ﬁgure, the drain metallization is right above the ﬁeld
oxide. In some operating conditions of the inverter the voltage drop between drain
and substrate would be large enough to form the parasitic channel; this is averted
by the combined effect of the ﬁeld oxide, that lowers the vertical component of the
electric ﬁeld, and of the channel stop, that lowers the surface concentration of the
electrons.
In the next step, the gate oxide is thermally grown over the active areas of
the two transistors, and suitably patterned; this is followed by the deposition and
patterning of the gate contacts, usually made of polysilicon.33 The source and
drain regions of the n-channel transistor are obtained by implanting a donor-type
dopant while protecting from the implant the active area of the p-channel device; a
successive implant of acceptor-type dopant creates in the same manner the source
and drain regions of the p-channel transistor. Both implants use the corresponding
gate electrode as a mask; this technique, called self-aligned gate, has the advantage
that the implantation process, along with the subsequent annealing step, ensure that
the gate overlaps the edges of the source and drain regions. Finally, the drain and
source contacts are deposited and patterned; as shown in Fig. 22.24, the source
contacts of both transistors extend laterally with respect to the source region: in
the n-channel device, part of the source contact overlaps the substrate region, while
in the p-channel device part of the source contact overlaps the well region. By
this contrivance, the source and bulk contacts of each transistor are shorted, and
the body effect eliminated. As indicated in Sect. 21.2.2, to prevent the contact-
semiconductor junction from behaving like a rectifying device, a heavy dose of
dopant is preliminarily introduced into the semiconductor region onto which the

contact is to be deposited; as shown in the ﬁgure, in the CMOS inverter two heavily
doped regions of this type are formed, of the p and n type respectively. The p-well
structure is dual with respect to that of Fig. 22.24; it is obtained from the latter by
exchanging “p” and “n” letters, including those of Sp and Sn.
In the standard operating conditions, the input signal of the inverter is applied
to the common gate contact, and the output signal is taken from the common
drain contact; concerning the latter, in complex digital circuits the output contact
is connected to several input contacts belonging to other logic gates. The fan out of
the inverter is the maximum number of input contacts it can be connected to without
altering its functioning. In general, such input contacts are the gate contacts of other
MOS transistors: as a consequence, from the circuit viewpoint they can globally
be mimicked as a nonlinear capacitor. The analysis that follows is limited to the
steady-state functioning of the inverter, whence one can assume that no current is
absorbed from the drain contact; the capacitor sketched in Fig. 22.23 is simply meant
to remind which type of load should be used in dynamic conditions.
22.10.1
I-O Characteristic of the CMOS Inverter
To describe the functioning of the CMOS inverter, it is necessary to distinguish the
quantities pertaining to the p-channel device from those of the n-type one. For this, it
sufﬁces to add an extra index; in particular, the voltages and current of the p-channel
MOSFET are denoted with VSGp, VSDp, and ISp, while symbols VGSn, VDSn, and IDn
are reserved for the n-channel device. The threshold voltages (22.85) and (22.113),
are indicated with
VTn D VFBn C 2 'Fn C n
p
2 'Fn ;
VTp D VFBp  2 'Fp C p
p
2 'Fp :
(22.123)
For the correct functioning of the inverter, both transistors must be of the enhance-
ment type, namely, remembering the deﬁnitions of Sects. 22.8.2 and 22.9.1, the
choice of the materials and the fabrication process must be such that VTn > 0 and
VTp > 0. A ﬁxed bias VSS > 0 is applied between the source contact of the p-channel
transistor and that of the n-channel one, as shown in Fig. 22.23; it is assumed that
the inequality
VSS > VTn C VTp
(22.124)
holds, which is easily achieved in the practical cases. The voltages VGSn and VDSn
are considered the input (Vin) and output (Vout) voltages of the inverter, respectively.
With these premises, the qualitative functioning of the inverter is readily discussed,
basing on the linear-parabolic model for the current-voltage characteristics worked
out in Sects. 22.8 and 22.9. Let, for instance, be 0  Vin  VTn, so that the n-channel
transistor is in the off condition and IDn D 0. As a consequence it is also ISp D 0 due

to the steady-state condition. On the other hand, it is VSGp  VTp D VSS  Vin  VTp
which, after adding and subtracting VTn, yields VSGp  VTp D .VSS  VTn  VTp/ C
.VTn  Vin/; in the latter, the ﬁrst term in parentheses is positive due to (22.124),
and the second one is nonnegative. In conclusion, VSGp VTp > 0 and the p-channel
device is in the on condition. For the latter to be compatible with ISp D 0, it is
necessary for the device to work in the linear region with VSDp D 0; in fact, the
saturation region is ruled out because it implies ISp ¤ 0. From the general relation
VSS D VDSn C VSDp it then follows Vout D VSS. As long as 0  Vin  VTn, the output
voltage is the highest and no power is dissipated by the inverter.
Let now the input voltage be increased by a small amount ıVin > 0 starting from
the threshold value, so that Vin D VTn C ıVin. It follows VGSn  VTn D ıVin, which
makes the n-channel device to turn on, yielding ISp D IDn ¤ 0. In turn, the current
ﬂow makes Vout to decrease and become Vout D VSS ıVout, with ıVout > 0, whence
VSDp D VSS  Vout D ıVout and VDSn D VSS  ıVout. Then,
.VGSn  VTn/  VDSn D ıVin  .VSS  ıVout/ D .ıVin C ıVout/  VSS ;

(22.126)
As ıVin CıVout can be made as small as we please, from (22.125) it follows .VGSn 
VTn/  VDSn < 0, which shows that the n-channel device works in the saturation
region; at the same time, thanks to (22.126) it is .VSGp  VTp/  VSDp > 0, namely,
the p-channel device is in the linear region. If the input voltage is further increased,
the p-channel transistor will eventually turn from the linear to the saturation region.
This happens for VSGpVTp D VSDp, namely, VSSVinVTp D VSSVout, equivalent
to Vout D Vin C VTp. When this occurs, the operating region of the n-channel device
is given by

(22.127)
As VTn; VTp > 0, the n-channel device is still in the saturation region, namely, both
transistors are working in the saturation region. In this regime, equating the currents
at the output node, ISp D IDn, provides an expression where only the input voltage
appears. This is so, because in the saturation region the expression of the current
provided by the model is independent of the drain-source voltage. In fact, equating
the currents yields ˇp .VSS  Vin  VTp/2 D ˇn .Vin  VTn/2, whence .VSS  VTn 

because the left-hand side is positive deﬁnite and ﬁnite. In conclusion, the input

It is worth observing that this result is not physically sound because the output

assumes perfect saturation,34 which never occurs in practice. However, in real
CMOS inverters the slope jdVout=dVinj, although ﬁnite, is still very large when both
transistors operate in the saturation region.
In the frame of the linear-parabolic model, the condition in which the n-channel
transistor turns from the saturation to the linear region must be found by keeping
Vin D Vsat
in and decreasing Vout until the condition VGSn  VTn D VDSn is fulﬁlled.
When Vin D Vsat
in
and Vout decreases, the n-channel transistor turns from the
saturation to the linear region as soon as VGSn  VTn D VDSn. This is equivalent
to Vin  VTn D Vout, namely
Vout D Vsat
in  VTn :
(22.129)
When Vin is increased beyond Vsat
in , more current is drawn by the n-channel
transistor, which makes Vout to decrease and the saturation condition of the p-
channel one to become deeper. The description of this region of the Vout.Vin/ curve
is similar to that of the region VTn  Vin  Vsat
in . The p-channel transistor reaches
the off condition as soon as the relation VSGp D VTp is fulﬁlled, namely,
VSS  Vin D VTp ;
Vin D VSS  VTp :
(22.130)
As long as VSS  VTp  Vin  VSS, the p-channel transistor remains in the off
condition, whence Vout D 0 and ISp D IDn D 0. Thus, the output voltage is the
lowest and no power is dissipated by the inverter.
The functioning conditions of the CMOS inverter are summarized in Table 22.3,
where columns Tn, Tp indicate the operating regions of the n-channel and p-
channel transistor, respectively. Letters A, B, C, or D in the ﬁrst column mark some
signiﬁcant points of the Vout.Vin/ curve. The full curve is shown by the black, thick
line in Fig. 22.25; in the same ﬁgure, the continuous, blue line represents the relation
Vout D Vin  VTn, which is equivalent to VDSn D VGSn  VTn. Remembering (22.93),
the line marks the boundary between the linear and saturation regions of the n-
channel transistor; such a line intercepts the horizontal axis at VTn. In turn, the

Poisson’s Equation in the MOSFET Channel
The derivation of the MOSFET’s current carried out in Sect. 22.8 is based upon two
integrals; the ﬁrst one, (22.68), is calculated over a section of the channel at some
position y, the second one, (22.73), is calculated along the channel from y D 0
to y D L. Apparently this procedure eliminates the need of solving the Poisson
equation. In fact, the solution of the latter is deeply rooted in the relation (22.75),
which is a fundamental point of the procedure itself, and in the choice of the
integration limits (22.76), which are also related to (22.75).
The Poisson equation in a nonequilibrium condition is conveniently tackled by
expressing the carrier concentrations in terms of the quasi-Fermi potentials 'n and
'p; the device considered here is the same n-channel MOSFET of Sect. 22.8. Using
the normalized form un D q 'n=.kB T/ and up D q 'p=.kB T/, the concentrations

read n D ni exp.u  un/ and p D ni exp.up  u/, respectively. Remembering that in
the equilibrium limit it is un; up ! uF, with uF the normalized Fermi potential, it is
useful to introduce the differences

in the equilibrium condition, whence 'n ! 'F as x increases. The same applies

it is u D u.x; y/ ; 	n D 	n.y/, with u.1; y/ D 0, u0.1; y/ D 0 due to the charge
neutrality of the bulk region; in fact, as shown by numerical solutions, both u and u0
practically vanish when x reaches the value of the depletion width xd.y/.
The Poisson equation is to be solved in two dimensions. If the condition of
a well-formed channel holds, the components of the electric ﬁeld along the x
and y directions are quite different from each other. The x component at the
semiconductor–oxide interface, Esx, which is due to the voltage applied to the gate
contact, is large because it maintains the strong-inversion condition of the surface.
Moreover, the derivative @Ex=@x D @2u=@x2 is also large, because Ex changes

from Esx to zero in the short distance xd.y/. In contrast, the y component of the
electric ﬁeld at the interface, Esy, which is due to the voltage VDS applied between
the drain and source contacts, is small; in fact, VDS is small in itself because the
linear region only is considered, and the channel length L is larger than the insulator
thickness. Moreover, numerical solutions show that for 0 < VDS < Vsat

dependence of both Esx and Esy on y is weak, which in particular makes @Ey=@y D

The dependence of A on y remains, and y is treated as a parameter in the solution

the contribution of the electron charge (proportional to exp.us/  1 in (22.137))

by letting 	n D 0. Also, specifying us D 	n C 2 uF at the source and drain ends of
the channel provides the integration limits (22.76) [128, Sec. 10-2].

is approximated by a charge layer at x D 0C, the volume charge is entirely due
to the ionized dopants, whose contribution in the second relation of (22.137) is
proportional to us like in the equilibrium case. Using the same relation Qi D

Inversion-Layer Charge and Mobility Degradation
In the model (22.78) for the drain current worked out in the previous sections, the
inversion-layer charge Qi decreases from source to drain due to the increase in 's
along the channel (compare with (22.34)). Considering that the MOSFET current
is carried by the inversion-layer charge, the vanishing of the latter occurring at
the drain end of the channel when VDS ! Vsat
DS may seem an oddity. However, it
is important to remember that a number of approximations are necessary to reach
the result expressed by (22.86) and (22.87); such approximations make the theory
applicable only in the linear region and in the condition of a well-formed channel.
When VDS ! Vsat
DS, the vertical component of the electric ﬁeld at the interface,
Esx, is made weaker by the interplay between the voltages applied to the gate
electrode and to the nearby drain electrode; for this reason, at the drain end of
the channel the ﬂow lines of Jn do not keep close to the interface any longer, but
spread into the substrate, thus decreasing the carrier density. The phenomenon is
better understood with the aid of Fig. 22.26, where the linear-parabolic model is
used with, e.g., VT D 0:5, VS D 0, VGS D 1:5, VDS D 2 V. As Vsat
DS D 1 V, the
saturation condition VDS > Vsat
DS D 1 holds. Along the dash-dotted line enclosed
in the right oval, the direction of the electric ﬁeld is that shown in the vector
diagram in the upper-right part of the ﬁgure; in particular, the vertical component
of the ﬁeld at the position marked by the vertical dashed line points upwards. As a
consequence, the channel electrons are repelled downwards and the ﬂow lines of the
current density detach from the interface. On the source end of the channel, instead,
the vertical component of the ﬁeld points downwards. By continuity, a position
within the channel exists where, in saturation, the vertical component of the ﬁeld
vanishes; such a position (not shown in the ﬁgure) is called inversion point. Also,
the large component of the electric ﬁeld along the y direction, which exists within
the space-charge region of the reverse-biased drain junction, makes the carriers’

22.11
Complements
655
average velocity to increase at the drain end of the channel; as the total current
is constant, a further decrease in the carrier concentration occurs. The two effects
brieﬂy illustrated above are not accounted for by the simpliﬁed model and require a
more elaborate approach in which the two-dimensional structure of the electric ﬁeld
is accounted for.
Another comment is useful, this time related to the off condition. When VGS !
VT, the current of a real device does not actually vanish; in fact, a current (called
subthreshold current), due to the carriers present in the channel in the weak-
inversion condition, ﬂows for VGS < VT. Also in this case a more elaborate theory
is necessary, showing that the subthreshold current vanishes exponentially as VGS
decreases (Sect. 22.11.5).
It is worth concluding this section by commenting the simpliﬁcation used
in (22.74), where the effective electron mobility e is assumed to be independent
of the position y along the channel. The factors that affect mobility in a MOSFET
are collisions with phonons, ionized impurities, and semiconductor–oxide interface;
remembering the features of the macroscopic mobility models (Sect. 20.5), the elec-
tron mobility n.x; y/ is made to depend on the lattice temperature T, concentration
of ionized impurities NA, and x component of the electric ﬁeld Ex.x; y/. The ﬁrst
two parameters, T and NA, do not introduce a dependence on position because they
are themselves constant. The x dependence of Ex is absorbed by the integral (22.71)
that deﬁnes e; it follows that the average mobility depends on y because Ex does.
Such a dependence, in turn, is relatively weak in the strong-inversion condition as
remarked in Sect. 22.11.1. Therefore, the dependence of e on position is considered
negligible.
22.11.3
Comments About the CMOS Inverter
With respect to other technologies, the CMOS inverter has a number of advantages;
they are brieﬂy listed below, using for comparison the old-fashioned inverters made
of an n-channel MOSFET with a resistive load (Fig. 22.27), or a p-channel MOSFET
still with a resistive load (Fig. 22.28). For a given bias VSS, the CMOS inverter
has the largest difference between the maximum and minimum output voltages
(dynamic range). In fact, as shown in Sect. 22.10, in a CMOS inverter described with
the linear-parabolic model such voltages are VSS and zero, respectively; a resistive-
load inverter (Probs. 22.7 and 22.8) cannot attain both limits.35 Connected to the
above comment is the fact that the transition of Vout from VSS to zero is actively
forced by the turning on of the n-channel transistor (pull-down device); similarly,
the transition of Vout from zero to VSS is actively forced by the turning on of the
35As shown in Sect. 22.11.5, in a real CMOS inverter the dynamic range is slightly decreased,
with respect to VSS, due to the subthreshold current; however, the conclusions about the CMOS
inverter’s superiority do not change.

p-channel transistor (pull-up device). In a resistive-load inverter, instead, one of
the two transitions is produced by the much less efﬁcient charging (discharging),
through the load resistor, of the capacitance associated with the logic gates
connected to the inverter’s output.
Another advantage of the CMOS inverter is that it has almost zero power
consumption in the steady-state condition. In the linear-parabolic model the static
power consumption is exactly zero because the current is such; in a real CMOS
inverter, some power is dissipated due to subthreshold conduction; however, it is
still much smaller than in other technologies.
More energy is consumed during the transients; assuming for simplicity that the
capacitor C associated with the output’s logic gates is linear, the energy dissipated
during either transient is C V2
SS=2: such an energy is still very small due to the fact
that MOS transistors are an easily scalable technology, which is another advantage
of the CMOS inverter with respect to earlier implementations.36 The combination
of small power consumption and ease of miniaturization, along with the relatively
simple and easy-to-replicate structure of the CMOS gates, makes it possible to
manufacture densely integrated and highly performing circuits. It is mainly thanks
to these properties that the CMOS architecture in silicon is to date (2017) the
most successful technology for manufacturing microprocessors or other integrated
circuits.
36An integrated resistor occupies a larger area than a MOSFET; this is another reason why
resistors are not suited for miniaturization. The scaling procedures are illustrated in some detail
in Sect. 22.11.6.

Exact Charge Partitioning in the MOS Capacitor
In view of the application to the theory of MOS transistors, the analysis of the
charge distribution within the MOS capacitor, in all functioning regimes with
the exclusion of accumulation, has been carried out using the approximation of
Sect. 22.4; with reference to the p-substrate capacitor, the procedure consists in
partitioning the semiconductor’s volume into the space-charge and quasi-neutral
regions, and using the expression (22.32) of the bulk charge per unit area Qb, with
xd the extension of the space-charge region. From this, the simpliﬁed form (22.34)
is found, that describes the inversion layer’s charge of a p-substrate MOS capacitor
in the depletion, weak-inversion, and strong-inversion regimes.
One may argue that a more precise analysis could be carried out without an
a priori partitioning of the semiconductor’s volume into regions; this is in fact
possible, starting from the integral expression (22.14) of the semiconductor charge
per unit area,37 and considering the individual charge contributions within the
integral. In this process, however, care must be taken to avoid diverging terms. To
investigate this issue one observes that if the partitioning into regions is not carried
out, the integral deﬁning the semiconductor charge per unit area extends over an
inﬁnite domain,
Qsc D

(22.140)
While the integral as a whole does converge because the asymptotic vanishing
of the integrand is sufﬁciently fast (see below), the integral of p or n alone may
not converge, and the integral of NA obviously diverges. This outcome is an
artifact due to the consideration of an inﬁnite domain; however, as shown below,
a separate calculation of the charges is still possible, keeping the domain as is: in
this way, the complicacy of placing the neutrality condition at a ﬁnite distance is
avoided. To proceed, one remembers that in a p-type substrate the relation between
the normalized electric potential and normalized ﬁeld at any position within the
semiconductor is given by (22.5), where the sign is negative because accumulation is
excluded. Remembering that the charge density reads % D q pp0 A.u/, with A given

which can also be proven by a direct calculation. Relations (22.142) and (22.143)

in [5], when accumulation is excluded the approximations are sufﬁciently accurate
and can also be extended to the treatment of the nonequilibrium case (Sect. 22.11.5).

MOSFET Theory Including the Subthreshold Current
The current-voltage relation of the n-channel MOSFET has been derived in
Sect. 22.8.1 starting from (22.74) and applying the gradual-channel approximation.
Such an approximation entails the use of (22.34) for the inversion-layer charge
per unit area at any position y in the channel, and of the condition (22.75) of a
well-formed channel. As indicated in Sect. 22.11.4, the expression of the charge is
accurate enough, both in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. In order to
improve the theory, one may then dispose of the condition of a well-formed channel;
in this case, when changing the variable from 'n to 's in (22.74), one ﬁnds

to be compared with (22.77). To proceed, one exploits the results of Sect. 22.11.1,
speciﬁcally, the deﬁnitions (22.131) and the relation (22.137), that holds between
surface potential, electron quasi-Fermi potential, and gate voltage when the accu-

Note that neglecting the term with the logarithm in (22.147) reproduces (22.75). It

and allows one to incorporate the subthreshold current in the analysis. Also, it is

the drift term; in fact, the diffusion component of the electron current is included

It is found by inspection that ID is made of two parts: the ﬁrst one derives from the
ﬁrst term (that is, the unity) at the right-hand side of (22.148), and is structurally
identical to the current I0
D  I00
D found in Sect. 22.8.2; the only difference here with
respect to the case of Sect. 22.8.2 is that one must obtain the integration limits
from (22.147) instead of using VSB C 2 'F and VDB C 2 'F directly. The other part
of ID derives from the second term at the right-hand side of (22.148); its analytical
calculation, although a little more elaborate, is feasible (Prob. 22.11).
The form of the us D us.	n/ relation calculated from (22.147) is shown in
Fig. 22.29 for different values of u0
GB. The dashed line shows the 	n D us C 2 uF
approximation; it is found that the approximation is fair when the surface potential
is sufﬁciently smaller than the lower zero of the logarithm’s argument in (22.147).
Then, the surface potential us saturates at the value corresponding to such a zero
(the latter is calculated in Prob. 22.11). The observation is important because it
shows that (22.149) provides a smooth transition from the linear to the saturation
region: when VDB is such that 	n.L/ D q VDB=.kB T/ enters the saturation region,
the upper limit us.L/ of the integral (22.149) is pinned to the saturation value; as a
consequence, the current does not increase anymore from that value of VDB on.
In contrast to the simpler model of Sect. 22.8, the theory worked out here makes
the hypothesis of a strong-inversion regime at each point of the channel unnecessary;
with reference to Eq. (22.147) and Fig. 22.29, at some position y, depending on the
values of 	n and u0
GB the condition may or may not hold. The latter case is also
indicated with subthreshold condition. If both VDB and VSB are such that the drain
and source ends of the channel are in the subthreshold condition, the whole channel
is such, and the expression (22.149) of the drain current becomes (Prob. 22.12):

a switch, the transitions must occur in a small interval of gate voltages. The

22.11.6
Scaling Rules for MOSFETs
An integrated circuit (IC, or chip) is a complex electric circuit (e.g., a computer’s
processor) whose elements are simultaneously fabricated41 on the same physical
support (wafer); it may incorporate transducers (e.g., optical, thermal, chemical,
or mechanical sensors; solid-state displays). An IC is fabricated by means of a
sequence of optical, chemical, and physical processes applied onto a wafer of
semiconductor material.42 The above processes involve only the surface region
of the wafer and a limited portion of its thickness; this explains the term planar
technology by which the fabrication of integrated circuits is typically indicated.
The integration level is determined by the chip’s area and by the number of
elementary devices per unit area. Since their introduction in the 1960s, the speed
of the integrated circuits, along with their computing and storage capacity, have
increased exponentially; this trend is consistent with the well-known Moore law,
40The deﬁnition of subthreshold slope is not limited to the MOS transistor, but applies in general
to the devices where a conductive channel is controlled by a gate. The value of 60 mV per decade
calculated in (22.151) is the minimum (that is, the most favorable one); in real devices, S is larger
(that is, worse).
41In contrast, in a discrete circuit the individual components are fabricated independently and
assembled afterwards.
42Some process steps are illustrated in the chapters devoted to the technological issues.

that is, the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit
approximately doubles every two years. This steady improvement in the fabrication
of chip makes it possible to identify subsequent “generations” of the integrated-
circuit technology, that are referred to as nodes, each node being marked by a
characteristic length.43 By way of example, the 1971 node was 10 m, the 2017 one
is 10 nm [68]. Considering that the chip as a whole, and each elementary device in
it, are essentially two-dimensional structures, it is sensible to associate a “radius”
with each of them; the steady improvement in the resolution and quality of the
fabrication processes has made it possible, at each generation of integrated circuits,
to decrease by a constant factor the radius of the elementary device and to increase
by a constant factor that of the chip: as a consequence, the number of elementary
devices of the chip, hence the chip’s capability to perform complex functions, have
grown exponentially.
In addition to the above, other advantages of miniaturization of the elementary
devices are that the electric power absorbed by the individual device decreases, and
that of the whole chip decreases as well thanks to clever circuit design made possible
by complexity; as a consequence, portable equipments become lighter as the number
and size of batteries decrease. Also, as the transistors’ switching time decreases
along with size, computers of the new generation perform more operations per unit
time with respect to those of the old generation.
If the applied voltages are left unchanged, the decrease in size of a device
brings about an increase in the electric ﬁeld. This is not acceptable because it
eventually gives rise to, e.g., junction breakdown due to avalanche (Sect. 21.5), or
gate-oxide breakdown; it is then necessary to decrease the applied voltages in order
to prevent these phenomena from happening. The methodologies by which this goal
is achieved are termed scaling rules; if, in particular, the latter are such that the
electric ﬁeld within the new-generation device is the same as in the old-generation
one, they are referred to as constant-ﬁeld scaling rules.
As the spatial dependence of the electric ﬁeld is found by solving the Poisson
equation " r2' D %, it is necessary to examine how the equation behaves under
scaling. It is assumed that the material does not change from the old-generation to
the new-generation device, so that the permittivity is the same in the two cases. The
shrinking of the device can be described as a variable transformation, such that the
coordinates xold
i
of the old-generation device are replaced with xnew
i
D xold
i =, where
 > 1 is the common scaling factor of the coordinates. At the same time, the electric
potential 'old becomes 'new D 'old=, where  > 1 is the corresponding scaling
factor. For the time being it is assumed that no relation exists between  and ; this
approach is more general than the constant-ﬁeld scaling rules, and is referred to as
generalized scaling theory [6]. It is important to note that the transformation of
the electric potential does not involve the interfaces between different media like,
for instance, the metal–semiconductor interfaces of the contacts; in fact, the work-

It is readily found from (22.153) that the constant-ﬁeld scaling rules are derived from
the generalized scaling theory by letting  D  D xold

density must scale as %new D  %old. The constant-ﬁeld scaling relation for % is
fulﬁlled in the insulator regions (%ox ' 0); as for the semiconductor regions, where
% D q .p  n C N/, in principle the relation is not fulﬁlled due to the presence of the
electron and hole concentrations. However, one remembers that in most operating
conditions the semiconductor domain can be divided into neutral and space-charge
regions (Sects. 21.2.2 and 22.2.2). In the space-charge regions, the mobile-carrier
concentrations are negligible with respect to the dopant’s, % D q .pnCN/ ' q N;
thus, the scaling relation is fulﬁlled if

The use of (22.155), where the contact voltages appear, seems to contradict the
prescription that the interfaces with the contacts should not be considered; one
notes, however, that with the exception of the threshold voltage VT, the voltages
appearing in (22.155) are actually voltage differences, from which the non-scalable
constants are automatically eliminated.44 The effect of the remaining non-scalable
voltage, VT, is provisionally neglected by assuming VGS  jVTj. In conclusion, the
term in brackets of (22.155) can be viewed as the square of a scalable voltage. As
far as coefﬁcient ˇ is concerned, the permittivity does not change because, as said

ox /. Finally, to determine how e
behaves under scaling, one refers to the discussion carried out in Sect. 20.5.3 about
the mobility dependence on macroscopic parameters in surface-channel devices.
Speciﬁcally, such parameters are lattice temperature, dopant concentration, and
intensity of the electric ﬁeld’s component normal to the semiconductor–insulator
interface. Experimental evidence shows that a difference in lattice temperature from
one generation to another can be neglected; in turn, the intensity of the electric ﬁeld’s
components is obviously invariant. In contrast, one expects a mobility degradation
to occur, due to the increase in the dopant concentration as prescribed by (22.154);
however, if one limits the analysis to the single step that brings from one generation
to the next one, factor  in (22.154) is limited between 1 and 2, which makes the
effect of the increase in the dopant concentration negligible as well.45 In conclusion,
assuming that e is invariant under scaling and using symbol VX to collectively

This is a fundamental result: it shows that scaling makes it possible to concentrate

time. To demonstrate this it is convenient to refer to the CMOS architecture
(Fig. 22.23) and to examine the charging or discharging processes of the capacitive
load that, as indicated in Sect. 22.10, mimics the inverter’s fan-out. Letting A be the

Sect. 22.10.1, the voltage V across the capacitor coincides with VDSn; it is equal to

in the off state. When the states reverse, the capacitor discharges through the n-

in the circuit made of the capacitor and the n-channel transistor. In the opposite
situation, in which V is initially equal to zero, when the transistors’ states reverse

the drain (source) current of an MOS transistor, whose scaling rule is (22.156); in

namely, within the constant-ﬁeld scaling rules, the scaling factor of time is the same
as that of lengths.
The presence of quantities that are not scalable introduces some complicacies
into the plain form of the scaling theory depicted so far; the general conclusions,
however, do not change. As mentioned above, non-scalable quantities typically arise
at the interfaces among different media; the problem is not necessarily restricted
to the device boundaries: for instance, in a reverse-biased abrupt p-n junction

quantity is the threshold voltage, whose expression for an n-channel transistor is
given by (22.85); it embeds the Fermi potential 'F D .kB T=q/ log.ND=ni/, the
work-function difference at the interface between semiconductor and bulk contact

the ﬁrst class: as mentioned in Sect. 22.2, the progressive scaling has brought the
insulator thickness to the range of nanometers. This may eventually lead to dielectric
breakdown and leakage by quantum tunneling; for this reason, silicon dioxide is
being replaced in advanced devices with high-k dielectrics. Another problem that is
aggravated by miniaturization is the statistical variability produced by the random
distribution of the dopant atoms. For instance, implanting a dopant with a 6  1018
cm3 concentration into a channel whose size is 40  20  20 nm3 yields about 100
implanted atoms; therefore, considering the dopant distribution still a continuous
function becomes a rather simplistic approximation. Practical problems, in turn,
derive from the increase (of exponential nature) in the cost of investments that are
necessary to move from one generation of integrated circuits to the next one, and
from the increasing complexity of the integrated circuits’ design: the latter issue
is in fact tackled by means of advanced techniques for automatic design, and of
sophisticated models describing each phase of the design. A brief outline of this
aspect is given in Sect. 22.11.7.

A Brief Account on IC Design
A rough scheme of the IC-design tree is depicted in Fig. 22.30. The design of a new
IC can be stimulated by a direct request from a customer or by a market analysis
carried out by the manufacturer. With reference to the left section of Fig. 22.30,
the ﬁrst steps of the design are a feasibility study including the description of
the functional specs, the choice of the technology (e.g., CMOS) along with an
estimate of the chip size, followed by chip planning, namely, the placement of the
individual blocks forming the chip. The next steps are the design of the circuits
able to abide by the functional specs, of the devices able to provide the static
and dynamic characteristics required by the circuits, and of the processes able to
yield the devices of interest. The design of equipments that make the processes
feasible is also important; it is uncommon, however, that the design of equipments
is accomplished by the same manufacturer that produces the integrated circuits.
As a whole, the steps listed above are also called top-down design, because they
start from an overview of the global system and break it successively into smaller
blocks. This part of the process is followed by the validation part, in which the
functionality of the individual blocks is checked separately and in detail (bottom-
up design). To complete the design it may be necessary to repeat several times
the top-down, bottom-up suite. When the design is complete, the layout of the
circuit is represented in a ﬁgure called stick diagram, useful for planning the relative
placement of the devices. The stick diagram for the CMOS inverter of Fig. 22.23 is
shown in Fig. 22.31 by way of example; the colors have a meaning: the red (light
blue) stick represents the p-channel (n-channel) transistor, the green sticks are the
input contact, the black sticks represent the bias or ground lines, and the output
contact; ﬁnally, the dots indicate the positions where different layers contact each
other.

The placement of each device in the layout is accomplished thanks to the stick
diagram; after its completion, the circuit’s layout is examined by means of an
automatic procedure (design-rule checker) to verify whether a set of recommended
design rules is satisﬁed; the rules specify restrictions about geometry and connec-
tivity (for instance, minimum width of each shape, minimum distance between
two adjacent objects, and many others), able to account for variability in the
manufacturing process. The steps involving the production of the stick-diagram,
of layout design, and of design-rule checking are depicted in the right section of

It is important to mention that the steps encircled by the left and right frames

the design of circuits, devices, processes, and equipment (left frame), two aspects
are fundamental for each step: the accurate physical modeling of the problem in
hand, and the ability of solving the equations resulting from the physical modeling.

Chapter 23
Thermal Diffusion—Ion Implantation
23.1
Introduction
The fabrication of integrated circuits requires the introduction into the semicon-
ductor material of atoms belonging to speciﬁcally selected chemical species. Such
atoms are called impurities or dopants. As shown in Chap. 18, the inclusion
of dopants into the semiconductor lattice attains the important goals of ﬁxing
the concentration of mobile charges in the material and making it practically
independent of temperature.
Dopants are divided into two classes, termed n-type and p-type. With reference
to silicon (Si), the typical n-type dopants are phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and
antimony (Sb), while the typical p-type dopants are boron (B), aluminum (Al),
gallium (Ga), and Indium (In). When a dopant atom is introduced into the
semiconductor lattice, in order to properly act as a dopant it must replace an atom
of the semiconductor, namely, it must occupy a lattice position. When this happens,
the dopant atom is also called substitutional impurity. An impurity atom that does
not occupy a lattice position is called interstitial. Interstitials cannot properly act
as dopants; in fact, they degrade the conductivity and other electrical properties of
the semiconductor.
The concentration of the dopant atoms that are introduced into a semiconductor
is smaller by orders of magnitude than the concentration of the semiconductor
atoms themselves. As a consequence, the average distance between dopant atoms
within the lattice is much larger than that between the semiconductor atoms. Thus,
the material resulting from a doping process is not a chemical compound: it is
still the semiconductor in which some of the electrical properties are modiﬁed
by the presence of the dopant atoms. In fact, while the presence and type of
dopants are easily revealed by suitable electrical measurements, they may remain
undetectable by chemical analyses.

Thermal Diffusion—Ion Implantation
The ﬁrst part of this chapter illustrates the diffusive transport with reference to
the processes that are used for introducing impurities into a semiconductor in a
controlled way. First, the expressions of the continuity equation and of the diffusive
ﬂux density are derived. These expressions are combined to yield the diffusion
equation, whose form is reduced to a one-dimensional model problem. The model
problem allows for an analytical solution, based on the Fourier-transform method,
that expresses the diffused proﬁle at each instant of time as the convolution of the
initial condition and an auxiliary function.
Then, the solution of the model problem is used to calculate the impurity proﬁles
resulting from two important processes of semiconductor technology, namely, the
predeposition and the drive-in diffusion. In the next part of this chapter the solution
of the model problem is extended to more general situations. Speciﬁc data about
the parameters governing the diffusion processes in semiconductors are in [61,
Chap. 3], [129, Chap. 10], [130, Chap. 7], [88, Chap. 12]. Many carefully drawn
illustrations of the diffusion process are found in [93, Sec. 1.5]. The properties of
the Fourier transform are illustrated in [89, 146] and Sect. C.2.
The last part of this chapter illustrates the features of ion implantation; it starts
from the description of the ion implanter, followed by the analysis of the energy
exchange between the ion and the crystal, and the statistical construction of the
implanted proﬁle. Some remarks about the annealing techniques are given at the end
of this chapter. Speciﬁc data about the parameters governing ion implantation may
be found in [130, Chap. 8] and [88, Chap. 11]. Many carefully drawn illustrations
of the diffusion process are found in [93, Sec. 1.6].
23.2
Continuity Equation
The continuity equation described in this section is a balance relation for the
number of particles. Here it is not necessary to specify the type of particles that
are being considered: they may be material particles, like molecules or electrons,
particles associated with the electromagnetic ﬁeld (photons), those associated with
the vibrational modes of atoms (phonons), and so on.1 Although the type of particles
is not speciﬁed, it is assumed that all particles considered in the calculations are of
the same type.
The balance relation is obtained by considering the space where the particles
belong and selecting an arbitrary volume V in it, whose boundary surface is denoted
with S. The position of the volume is ﬁxed. Let N .t/ be the number of particles
1The continuity equations for the free carriers in semiconductors, and the corresponding transport
equations, are deduced and extensively discussed in Chap. 19. The derivation of the continuity
equation for the impurity atoms is repeated here in a more concise manner, to let the reader use the
material of this chapter without the need of referring to concepts introduced elsewhere in the book.
The transport equation here is simpler than those of Chap. 19 because the drift term is missing due
to the atoms’ neutrality. Other types of continuity equations are illustrated in Chaps. 4 and 5 with
reference to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and in Chap. 9 with reference to the wave function.

Continuity Equation

that are inside S at time t. Due to the motion of the particles, in a given time interval
some of them move across S in the outward direction, namely, from the interior to
the exterior of S. In the same interval of time, other particles move across S in the
inward direction. Let Fout.t/ and Fin.t/ be the number of particles per unit time that
cross S in the outward or inward direction, respectively, and let F D Fout  Fin.
The quantity F, whose units are s1, is the ﬂux of the particles across the surface
S. If the only reason that makes N to change is the crossing of S by some particles,
the balance relation takes the form of the ﬁrst equation in (23.1). The minus sign
at the right-hand side is due to the deﬁnition of F; in fact, N decreases with time
when F > 0, and vice versa.
Besides the crossing of the boundary S by some particles, there is another
mechanism able to contribute to the time variation of N , namely, the generation or
destruction of particles inside the volume V. This possibility seems to violate some
commonly accepted conservation principle. However, it is not so, as some examples
given in Sect. 23.8.1 will show. As a consequence, the description of the particle
generation or destruction must be included. This is accomplished by letting
Wge.t/ and Wde.t/ be the number of particles per unit time that are generated or,
respectively, destroyed within the volume V. Deﬁning W D Wge  Wde, the balance
relation that holds when generation or destruction are present takes the form of the
second equation in (23.1):
dN

D F ;
dN

D F C W :
(23.1)
The quantity W , whose units are s1, is the net generation rate within volume V.
It is convenient to recast (23.1) in local form. This is done basing on the second
equation of (23.1), which is more general, and is accomplished by describing the
motion of the particles as that of a continuous ﬂuid. Such a description is legitimate
if V can be partitioned into equal cells of volume V1; V2; : : : having the following
properties: i) the cells can be treated as inﬁnitesimal quantities in the length scale of
the problem that is being considered and, ii) the number of particles within each cell
is large enough to make their average properties signiﬁcant. If the above conditions
are fulﬁlled one lets Vk ! dV and introduces the concentration N.r; t/, such that
N dV is the number of particles that at time t belong to the volume dV centered at
position r. Similarly, one deﬁnes the net generation rate per unit volume W.r; t/
such that W dV is the net generation rate at time t within dV. The units of N and W
are m3 and m3s1, respectively. From the deﬁnitions of N, W it follows that the
number N .t/ of particles that are inside S at time t is found by integrating N.r; t/
over V, and that the net generation rate W .t/ is found by integrating W over V.
To recast in local form the part of (23.1) related to the ﬂux F, one associates a
velocity v.r; t/ to the concentration N.r; t/. In general, such a velocity is different
from the velocity of each individual particle that contributes to the concentration N.
In fact, v is a suitable average of the particles’ velocities, whose deﬁnition (6.6) is
given in Sect. 6.2. In the elementary time dt the concentration originally in r moves
over a distance v dt in the direction of v. As a consequence, if r belongs to the

boundary surface S, a crossing of S by the particles may occur, thus contributing
to the ﬂux. To calculate the contribution to the ﬂux at a point r belonging to S,
one takes the plane tangent to S at r and considers an elementary area dS of this
plane centered at r (Fig. 23.1). The construction implies that the surface S is smooth
enough to allow for the deﬁnition of the tangent plane at each point of it.
Let s be the unit vector normal to dS, oriented in the outward direction with
respect to S. If v is normal to s, no crossing of S occurs and the contribution to the
ﬂux at point r is zero. If the scalar product v  s is positive, the crossing occurs in
the outward direction and contributes to Fout. Its contribution is found by observing
that the elementary cylinder, whose base area and side are dS and, respectively, v dt,
has a volume equal to v  s dS dt. Due to the sign of v  s, the cylinder is outside the
surface S. The number of particles in the cylinder is found by multiplying its volume
by the concentration N.r; t/. Letting F D Nv, such a number reads F  s dS dt. As
the particles that are in the cylinder at time t C dt were inside the surface S at time
t, dividing the above expression by dt yields the elementary contribution of point r
to the ﬂux, dF D F  s dS > 0. The contribution from a point r where v  s < 0 is
calculated in a similar way. The ﬂux F is then found by integrating F  s over the
surface S. The quantity F  s D dF=dS, whose units are m2s1, is the ﬂux density.

(23.2)
The last equality in (23.2) is due to the divergence theorem (A.23), whereas the use
of the partial-derivative symbol is due to the fact that the N, in contrast with N ,
depends also on r. The procedure leading to (23.2) does not prescribe any constraint
on the choice of the volume V. As a consequence, the two integrals over V that
appear in (23.2) are equal to each other for any V. It follows that the corresponding
integrands must be equal to each other, thus yielding the continuity equation

(23.3)
As mentioned above, (23.3) is the local form of the second equation of (23.1), which
in turn is a balance relation for the number of particles. In the steady-state condition
the quantities appearing in (23.3) do not depend explicitly on time, hence (23.3)
reduces to div F D W. In the equilibrium condition it is v D 0 and (23.3) reduces to
the identity 0 D 0. It is worth noting that in the equilibrium condition the velocity
of each particle may differ from zero; however, the distribution of the individual
velocities within any elementary volume dV is such that the average velocity v
vanishes. Similarly, in the equilibrium condition the generation or destruction of
particles still occurs; however, they balance each other within any dV.
To proceed it is assumed that the net generation rate per unit volume W, besides
depending explicitly on r and t, may also depend on N and F, but not on other
functions different from them.
23.3
Diffusive Transport
The continuity equation (23.3) provides a relation between the two quantities N and
F (or, equivalently, N and v). If both N and F are unknown it is impossible, even in
the simple case W D 0, to calculate them from (23.3) alone. However, depending on
the speciﬁc problem that is being considered, one can introduce additional relations
that eventually provide a closed system of differential equations. The important case
of the diffusive transport is considered in this section.
It is convenient to specify, ﬁrst, that the term transport indicates the condition
where an average motion of the particles exists, namely F ¤ 0 for some r and t.
The type of transport in which the condition F ¤ 0 is caused only by the spatial
nonuniformity of the particles’ concentration N is called diffusive. Simple examples
of diffusive transport are those of a liquid within another liquid, or of a gas within
another gas. They show that in the diffusive motion of the particles, the ﬂux is
oriented from the regions where the concentration is larger towards the regions
where the concentration is smaller.
The analytical description of the diffusion process dates back to 1855 [48]. Here
the relation between F and N in the diffusive case is determined heuristically, basing
on the observation that grad N is a sensible indicator of the spatial nonuniformity
of N. Speciﬁcally it is assumed, ﬁrst, that F depends on N and grad N, but not
on higher-order derivatives of N. The dependence on grad N is taken linear, F D
F0  D grad N, with F0 D 0 because F must vanish when the concentration is
uniform. Finally, one remembers that the particles’ ﬂux is oriented in the direction
of a decreasing concentration, namely, opposite to grad N. It follows that D > 0, so
that the relation takes the form
F D D grad N ;
D > 0 :

Thermal Diffusion—Ion Implantation
The above is called transport equation of the diffusion type, or Fick’s ﬁrst law of
diffusion. Parameter D is the diffusion coefﬁcient, whose units are m2s1. From the
derivation leading to (23.4) it follows that if a dependence of F on N exists, it must
be embedded in D. In the case D D D.N/ the relation (23.4) is linear with respect
to grad N, but not with respect to N. The diffusion coefﬁcient may also depend
explicitly on r and t. For instance, it depends on position when the medium where
the diffusion occurs is nonuniform; it depends on time when an external condition
that inﬂuences D, e.g., temperature, changes with time.
For the typical dopants used in the silicon technology, and in the temperature
range of the thermal-diffusion processes, the experimentally determined dependence
on temperature of the diffusion coefﬁcient can be approximated by the expression
D D D0 expŒEa=.kBT/ ;
(23.5)
where kB (J K1) is the Boltzmann constant and T (K) the process temperature.
In turn, the activation energy Ea and D0 are parameters whose values depend on
the material involved in the diffusion process. The form of (23.5) makes it more
convenient to draw it as an Arrhenius plot, that displays the logarithm of the function
using the inverse temperature as a variable: log D D log.D0/  .Ea=kB/ .1=T/.
At the diffusion temperatures, Ea and D0 can often be considered independent of
temperature. In this case the Arrhenius plot is a straight line (examples of Arrhenius
plots are given in Chap. 24). At room temperature the diffusion coefﬁcient of
dopants in silicon is too small to make diffusion signiﬁcant. In order to activate
the diffusion mechanism a high-temperature process is necessary, typically between
900ıC and 1;100ıC. Data about the diffusion coefﬁcients of different dopants in
silicon are reported, e.g., in [130, Sect. 7.5].

supplemented with the initial condition N0.r/ D N.r; t D 0/ and suitable boundary
conditions for t > 0. If the diffusion coefﬁcient is constant, or depends on t at

Equation (23.8) is also called Fick’s second law of diffusion. Thanks to the linearity

speciﬁcally, by transforming both sides of (23.8) with respect to x. Indicating2 with

23.5
Predeposition and Drive-in Diffusion
Basing on the model problem worked out in Sect. 23.4 it is possible to describe the
thermal diffusion of dopants in silicon. The modiﬁcation induced in the electrical
properties of the silicon lattice by the inclusion of atoms belonging to different
chemical species (e.g., phosphorus or boron) is described elsewhere (Sects. 18.4.1
and 18.4.2). Here the analysis deals with the diffusion process in itself.
The formation of a diffused proﬁle in silicon is typically obtained in a two-
step process [61, 93, 130]. In the ﬁrst step, called predeposition, a shallow layer
of dopants is introduced into the semiconductor. The most common predeposition
methods are the diffusion from a chemical source in a vapor form or the diffusion
from a solid source (e.g., polycrystalline silicon) having a high concentration of
dopants in it. In both methods the silicon wafers are placed in contact with the
source of dopant within a furnace kept at a high temperature.
During a predeposition step, new dopant atoms are continuously supplied by the
source to the silicon region. As a consequence, the number of dopant atoms in the
silicon region increases with time. When the desired amount of atoms is reached,
the supply of dopants is blocked, whereas the diffusion process is continued. During
this new step, called drive-in diffusion, the number of dopant atoms in the silicon
region remains constant. The drive-in diffusion is continued until a suitable proﬁle
is reached.
Typically, the blocking of the ﬂow of dopant atoms from the source to the
silicon region is achieved by introducing oxidizing molecules into the furnace
atmosphere, thus resulting in the growth of a silicon-dioxide layer at the silicon
surface (the details of the oxidation process are given in Chap. 24).
It is worth anticipating that in some processes the predeposition step is skipped,
and the dopant atoms are introduced into the silicon wafers at low temperature by
means of an ion-implantation process (Sect. 23.7).

with the y; z plane, with the x axis oriented towards the wafer’s bulk, and the initial
condition N0 is assumed constant in the source region. The diffusion coefﬁcients in
the source and wafer regions are provisionally taken equal to each other. Thanks to
these assumptions the problem has no dependencies on the y; z variables, and the
one-dimensional form (23.8) of the diffusion equation holds. In the practical cases
the extent of the source region in the x direction is large and the concentration of the
dopant atoms in it is high. As a consequence, the source is not depleted when the
atoms diffuse into the wafer. The spatial form of the concentration N at a given time

Thermal Diffusion—Ion Implantation
where the dependence on t derives from the second of (23.10). As parameter a
increases with time, the dose increases with time as well, consistently with the
qualitative description of predeposition given earlier in this section. In most cases
the diffusion coefﬁcient is independent of time, a D D t, thus yielding Q / pt.
Still from the second of (23.10) one ﬁnds a.0/ D 0. Combining the latter with the
properties (C.69) of the complementary error function shows that limt!0C N.x; t/
coincides with the initial condition given by the ﬁrst of (23.15). Also, the solu-
tion (23.16) fulﬁlls the boundary conditions N.1; t/ D 2C, N.C1; t/ D 0
at any t > 0. Finally it is N.0; t/ D C at any t > 0. This explains the term
constant-source diffusion that is also used to indicate this type of process. In fact,
the concentration at the wafer’s surface is constant in time. Figure 23.2 shows the
normalized concentration N=C calculated from the ﬁrst of (23.16) at different values
of a.
The analysis of the diffusion process carried out so far was based on the
assumption of a position-independent diffusion coefﬁcient D. In the actual cases
this assumption is not fulﬁlled because the dopant source and the wafer are made
of different materials. As a consequence, the solution of (23.8) must be reworked.
In the case of predeposition this is accomplished with little extra work, which is
based on the ﬁrst of (23.16) as shown below.
One assumes, ﬁrst, that the diffusion coefﬁcient in either region is independent
of time, as is the standard condition of the typical processes. In each region the
diffusion coefﬁcient takes a spatially constant value, say, DS in the source and DW ¤
DS in the wafer. Now, observe that (23.8) is homogenous and contains the derivatives
of N, but not N itself. It follows that if C erfcŒx=.4 a/1=2 is the solution of (23.8)
fulﬁlling some initial and boundary conditions, then A erfcŒx=.4 a/1=2 C B is also
a solution of (23.8), fulﬁlling some other conditions that depend on the constants A
and B. One then lets, with t > 0,

In order to ﬁx the remaining constants one must consider the matching conditions
of the two regional solutions (23.17, 23.18) at the source–wafer interface. The
concentrations across an interface between two different media are related by the
segregation coefﬁcient k
[130, Sect. 1.3.2]. Also, given that no generation or

Thermal Diffusion—Ion Implantation
23.5.2
Drive-in Diffusion
As indicated at the beginning of this section, the drive-in diffusion is started when
the desired amount of atoms has been introduced into the silicon lattice, and is
continued until a suitable proﬁle is reached.
In principle, the proﬁle to be used as initial condition of a drive-in diffusion is
not exactly equal to the ﬁnal proﬁle of the predeposition step. In fact, the boundary
condition .@NW=@x/0C is different from zero during the predeposition step. Instead,
during the growth of the silicon-dioxide layer that blocks the supply of dopant atoms
from the source region, the boundary condition becomes equal to zero to adapt to
the situation of a vanishing ﬂux density of dopants across the interface.
The calculation of the drive-in diffusion is tackled more easily by assuming
that the blocking of the supply of dopants atoms is instantaneous, so that the ﬁnal
proﬁle of the predeposition step is “frozen.” Then, one considers the full domain
1 < x < C1 instead of the wafer domain 0  x < C1, with the same
diffusion coefﬁcient D D DW everywhere. In this way one can still use the model
problem (23.8). As for the initial condition N0, one mirrors the ﬁnal proﬁle of the
predeposition step over the negative axis, thus making the initial condition even with
respect to x. Letting x  x in (23.13) one easily proves that N.x; t/ D N.x; t/
if N0./ D N0./; namely, if the initial condition is even, then the solution is even
at all times. With the provisions above one ﬁnds .@NW=@x/0C D .@NW=@x/0,
which automatically fulﬁlls the condition of a vanishing ﬂux density of dopants
across the origin. Then, the application of (23.13) provides the proﬁle of the drive-
in diffusion in the wafer region 0  x < C1:
The ﬁnal proﬁle (23.16) of the predeposition step, used as initial condition, does
not lend itself to an analytical calculation of the drive-in diffusion. Some examples
of calculation are given below, in which proﬁles of a simpler form than (23.16) are
used as approximations. Let Q be the dose present within the wafer region. As a ﬁrst
example one lets

(23.23)
showing that when the initial condition is a Dirac ı, the proﬁle resulting from a
diffusion process is Gaussian. Only the portion of (23.23) belonging to the wafer
region, that is, x  0, must in fact be considered. Integrating (23.23) from 0 to
C1 and using (C.78) yield the expected value Q of the dose at all times. Although
rather crude, the approximation of using a Dirac ı as initial condition is acceptable,
because the proﬁle obtained from a predeposition or an ion-implantation process is
typically very thin.

23.6
Generalization of the Model Problem
685
As a second example one takes a Gaussian proﬁle as the initial condition,
speciﬁcally, the second of (23.23) where, to better distinguish the symbols, a
is replaced with a1. It is assumed that the drive-in diffusion to be calculated is
characterized by another value of the parameter, say, a2. The difference between
a2 and a1 may be due to the duration of the diffusion process under investigation,
to a temperature-induced difference in the diffusion coefﬁcients, or both. As usual
the instant t D 0 is set as the initial time of the diffusion process. Applying (23.13)

(23.26)
As before, the integral of the proﬁle from 0 to C1 yields the dose Q at all times. The
result expressed by (23.26) is important because it shows that a diffusion process
whose initial condition is a Gaussian proﬁle yields another Gaussian proﬁle. The
parameter of the latter is found by simply adding the parameter a2 D
R t
0 D.t0/ dt0
of the diffusion process in hand, whose duration is t, to the parameter a1 of the
initial condition. Clearly, the result is also applicable to a sequence of successive
diffusion processes. In fact, it is used to calculate the ﬁnal proﬁles after the wafers
have undergone the several thermal processes that are necessary for the integrated-
circuit fabrication.
23.6
Generalization of the Model Problem
The generalization of the model problem (23.8) to three dimensions, that is,
equation (23.7) with W D 0 and initial condition N0.r/ D N.r; t D 0/, is
still tackled by means of the Fourier transform. For this, it is necessary to deﬁne
the vectors r D .r1; r2; r3/, s D .s1; s2; s3/, k D .k1; k2; k3/, and the elements
d3k D dk1 dk2 dk3, d3s D ds1 ds2 ds3. Using (C.20) and following the procedure

When the net generation rate per unit volume, W, is different from zero, it is in

is the case where W is linear with respect to N and has no explicit dependence on r

that N D Na C N0 exp.t=/. In fact, N0 turns out to be the solution of the three-

Ion Implantation
The reproducibility of thermal diffusion, as a method for introducing dopant atoms
into a semiconductor material, is limited. The analysis carried out in the previous
sections has shown that the predeposition process is controlled by the boundary
condition, where a constant concentration of the dopant is kept, and by the diffusion
coefﬁcient. Similarly, the drive-in diffusion is controlled by the zero-ﬂux boundary
condition and by the diffusion coefﬁcient. Thus, the proﬁle obtained from a thermal
diffusion is invariably of the same type; another drawback of the process is the
strong dependence on temperature of the diffusion coefﬁcient (23.5), which makes
the reproducibility more difﬁcult.
In the sixties of the last century, ion implantation has emerged as a method,
alternative to thermal diffusion, for introducing dopant atoms in the semiconductor.
The ion implanter (Fig. 23.4) consists of an ion source where the dopant atoms
(in solid, liquid, or gaseous phase) are ionized by a conﬁned electric discharge, one

Fig. 23.4 Schematic cross-section of an ion implanter
or more acceleration systems, and an analyzing system where the ions are ﬁltered
according to their mass and kinetic energy. The ion beam thus obtained is uniformly
distributed, by means of a scanning system, over the wafer (target). When the ions
enter the wafer, they gradually lose energy due to collisions, until they come to rest.
The collision between an ion and a wafer’s nucleus may displace the nucleus from its
lattice site; this happens if the energy released by the ion during the collision is larger
than the displacement threshold energy (about 15 eV in silicon). The damage is
removed at a later stage by a suitable heat treatment (annealing); besides removing
the damage, annealing drives the implanted ions into the substitutional positions.
The neutrality of the implanted ions is restored by electrically connecting the ion
source with the target holder (Fig. 23.4). This also provides a method for measuring
the current ﬂowing through the connection; since all ions are equal to each other, this
yields a very precise measurement of the ion current and, as a consequence, of the
implanted dose (more details are given below). From the description of the process,
it is clear that the dose is controlled independently from the penetration depth of the
ions; such a depth is in fact determined by prescribing the kinetic energy of ions
through the acceleration systems. It follows that a large variety of proﬁles can be
obtained from the convolution of subsequent implantation steps with different doses
and penetrations. In summary, the advantages of ion implantation are:
•
Fine control of dose and penetration.
•
Flexibility in building-up proﬁles.
•
Reproducibility.
•
Small lateral penetration.
•
Applicability to compound semiconductors.

The disadvantages with respect to thermal diffusion are the cost of the equipments,
the higher complexity of the process, and crystal damage.4
23.7.1
Ion Implanter
The ion implanter is made of a number of blocks that are illustrated with reference
to Fig. 23.4. The whole process is carried out in vacuo to prevent the molecules
of the atmosphere from interfering with the motion of the ions. The ﬁrst block of
the implanter is the ion source, where a suitable compound containing the dopant
is subjected to a high electric ﬁeld. Typical compounds are boron triﬂuoride (BF3),
arsine (AsH3), or phosphine (PH3). A fraction of the atoms ionize; as a consequence,
free electrons and ionized atoms of different chemical species are present in the ion
source. While the electrons are collected by a suitable contact, some of the ions
escape through a hole in the wall of the ion source and transfer from the latter to
the second block, where an electric ﬁeld is present. If VA is the potential drop across
the second block, the ions are accelerated and their kinetic energy increases by q VA
(Fig. 23.5).

3This aspect is particularly relevant because each high-temperature process activates the diffusion
coefﬁcients and deforms the doping proﬁles already present in the semiconductor.
4In contrast, thermal diffusion has simpler process and equipments, and does not produce a
crystal damage; this, however, does not compensate for its drawbacks (high temperature, modest
reproducibility, difﬁcult application to compound semiconductors, large lateral penetration).

23.7
Ion Implantation
689
It is important to note that although the increase in kinetic energy is known,
the actual kinetic energy of the ions is not, because there is no information about
the distribution of the ion velocities when the ions escape from the ion source;
moreover, the ions that escape are a mixture of those deriving from the dopant
atoms and from the other atoms of the compound. For this reason, it is necessary to
introduce an analyzing system made of a third and fourth block, where the ions are
ﬁltered: the result of the ﬁltering action is that all ions belonging to chemical species
different from the dopant are eliminated, and the dopant ions whose kinetic energy
is different from that prescribed by the process are eliminated as well. In summary,
the ﬁltering action must involve two dynamic properties: the mass, to distinguish the
ions belonging to different chemical species, and the kinetic energy; or, equivalently,
other two dynamic properties uniquely related to the above like, e.g., momentum and
velocity. As shown below, the ions having the prescribed momentum are obtained
from the third block, called magnetic ﬁlter; these ions then enter the fourth block, the
electromagnetic ﬁlter, that eliminates the ions not possessing the prescribed velocity.
The outcome is that only those ions having the correct momentum and velocity pass
the two ﬁlters. After the ﬁltering action is completed, the ions are oriented onto the
target by suitable deﬂection electrodes. Prior to that, a further acceleration block
may be present, with VB the potential drop.
The action of the magnetic ﬁlter is described below, with the aid of Fig. 23.5.
The magnetic induction is oriented upward with respect to the plane of the cross-
section shown in the ﬁgure, and the initial velocity of the ion belongs to such a
plane. As the orientation of the magnetic induction is the same as in Prob. 4.6, the
ion’s trajectory within the magnetic ﬁlter is a portion of circumference of radius
r D u=! D u m=.qB/, whence
m u D r q B :
(23.31)
The ion escapes from the magnetic ﬁlter if r D r0, with r0 the ﬁlter’s radius
(Fig. 23.5); otherwise, it is intercepted by the ﬁlter’s walls. Letting r D r0, (23.31)
shows that B can be calibrated to obtain a desired value of the ion’s momentum m u.
The magnetic ﬁlter is followed by the electromagnetic ﬁlter. In the latter, the
same magnetic induction B as before is present; in addition to it, a constant electric
ﬁeld E is applied as well through the voltage V shown in the ﬁgure. Let u be the
velocity of the ion at the instant of entering the electromagnetic ﬁlter, that is, at
the instant of escaping the magnetic ﬁlter; as before, the direction of u is normal
to B, while its modulus (with which the ion escapes the magnetic ﬁlter) is yet
unknown, because (23.31) prescribes the product m u only. Finally, the direction
of E is normal to both B and u. The structure of the apparatus is such that the
ion escapes the electromagnetic ﬁlter only if it suffers no deviation; this happens
if F D q .E C u ^ B/ D 0. Considering the orientation of the three vectors
in the above, it follows E D u B; combining the latter with (23.31) provides
m D r0 q B2=E. Finally, collecting the above results one ﬁnds for the mass, velocity,
and kinetic energy of the ﬁltered ion,

This result shows that a suitable choice of E and B ﬁlters only the ions of a certain
mass; other ions possibly present in the ion source are eliminated. Moreover, all
ﬁltered ions have the same kinetic energy.
From the description above it follows that the ion beam is formed by identical
ions that move in the same direction with a common velocity of modulus u and a
uniform concentration cI. In principle, the direction of the ions’ velocities should
spread due to mutual repulsion; however, the beam is dilute, to the extent that this
effect is negligible. Let the velocity of the ions be aligned with the x axis, and let A
be the cross-section of the beam in the direction normal to x. From the concentration
cI D dnI=.dx dA/ of the ions in the beam, one ﬁnds the relation
u cI D u dnI
dx dA D u

(23.33)
with F the ion ﬂux. The latter is constant due to the constancy of u and cI. The

In (23.35), the area A of the beam is given; as the current measurement is
accomplished with a very high accuracy,5 the dose is determined with the same
accuracy by calibrating the duration tP of the process. For this reason the accuracy
of ion implantation is superior to that of thermal diffusion. From (23.32) and (23.35)
one ﬁnds that, as mentioned before, the kinetic energy and the dose are controlled
independently from each other.
23.7.2
Ion Trajectories
When it enters the semiconductor, the implanted ion undergoes a series of collisions
with the nuclei of the semiconductor, and also with the electron cloud surrounding
5Remembering the description of the process given at the beginning of the section, the current that
is measured is in fact that of the electrons extracted from the dopant atoms.

the nuclei. As indicated above, the ion gradually loses energy until it comes to
rest; also, due to collisions, the ion’s trajectory within the semiconductor is not a
straight line: for this reason, it is convenient to use a curvilinear abscissa s along the
trajectory, whose origin is in the position where the ion enters the semiconductor.
A sketch of such a trajectory is shown in Fig. 23.6, where the y z plane deﬁnes
the semiconductor’s surface; the semiconductor belongs to the half space x > 0, and
the ion under consideration enters the semiconductor, with an initial velocity u, in a
position corresponding to the origin of the reference. The collisions with the nuclei
are considered point-like, whence the trajectory is represented as a broken line; at
each collision, the ion loses a fraction of its energy. Along the segment from one
collision to the next, the ion still suffers an energy loss due the interaction with the
electrons. Letting P indicate the ﬁnal position of the ion, a number of parameters
are of use: speciﬁcally, letting r D PO (called range) be the modulus of the position
vector at the end of the trajectory, the projection of r along the x axis, rP D QO, is
called projected range, while the distance between the ﬁnal position and the x axis,
rL D QP, is called lateral range.
Due to the randomness of the collisions, ions entering the semiconductor at the
same position and with the same velocity follow in general different trajectories;
three of them are shown in Fig. 23.6 by way of example. It is then necessary to
describe the outcome of the process by means of statistical parameters; one of them
is the dose Q deﬁned in (23.35), other parameters are the average projected range
and the average lateral range, respectively deﬁned as6
RP D hrPi ;
RL D hrLi :
(23.36)
6The masks used in an ion-implantation process are similar to those used in thermal diffusion.
For the ions that enter the semiconductor far from the mask’s edges, the lateral ranges rL tend to
compensate each other when calculating the average lateral range. For this reason, more attention
is given here to the average range.

The averages in (23.36) are taken over all ions. Some typical parameters character-

The loss S D dT=ds > 0 of kinetic energy suffered by the ion along the element
ds of trajectory is called stopping power;7 due to the different mechanisms involved,
it is convenient to separate the losses produced by the interaction with electrons from
those due to collisions with nuclei:

expressions for Se and Sn are given with different orders of approximation [130,
Chap. 8], [88, Chap. 11]. When the kinetic energy of the ion is low, the electronic
stopping power can be assimilated to a viscous drag force which, to ﬁrst order, is
proportional to the velocity of the ion; in this order of approximation one obtains

As for the nuclear stopping power, a qualitative analysis may be based on the

at rest; the interaction potential energy is of the Coulomb type, with Z1 q, Z2 q the
particles’ charges and c the impact parameter. The calculation leads to

In the problem in hand, the exchange of energy occurs over a path of the order of
the lattice constant a; dividing by a both sides of the ﬁrst relation in (23.41), and
assuming that K is small, one obtains dK=ds ' .b=a/ K=.1 C K2/. Combining

with g a suitable constant. The above treatment of the nuclear stopping power is only
qualitative because it does not take screening into account; in fact, if the electronic
stopping power was missing (g D 0), integration of (23.42) would yield a diverging
length of the trajectory due to the long-range decay of the pure Coulomb potential
(compare with Sect. 20.6.4). Also, an integration of (23.42) would imply that the
impact parameter is the same for all collisions; this parameter appears in fact in
one of the integration limits due to the second relation in (23.38). A more realistic
analysis shows that the majority of the implanted ions8 undergo a large number
of collisions, so that many different impact parameters are involved in a single
trajectory; it is then reasonable to assume that for such ions the same set of impact
parameters, although in different order, are present. It follows that the same set of
energy losses applies to all ions, whence the lengths of the trajectories are equal for
all; this helps in building up a statistical theory of the position of the end points of
the trajectories.
A sketch of the behavior of the nuclear and electronic stopping power is shown in
Fig. 23.7, in arbitrary units and using
p
T as abscissa. The energy Tc corresponding
to the intersection is called critical energy. If r0 q E=2  Tc, as the ion enters the
semiconductor a large part of the energy loss is due to nuclear collisions; some of
the latter, in turn, displace the nuclei, so that the crystal damage starts from the
superﬁcial layers of the semiconductor. When, instead, it is r0 q E=2 > Tc, most
of the initial energy loss is due to electronic collisions, which produce no damage;
however, as the ion continues its motion into the semiconductor its kinetic energy
decreases, and eventually reaches the critical value: as a consequence, the crystal
damage is larger far from the semiconductor’s surface.
8The ions not belonging to this majority are included in the analysis at a later stage (Sect. 23.7.3).

Implanted Proﬁle
As mentioned in Sect. 23.7.2, for the majority of implanted ions the same set of
energy losses apply, although in different order. This yields the same length s0 of
the trajectories; their end points, however, are different, and a statistical description
is necessary. For a single ion, the important parameter is the projected range rP,
namely, the distance of the end point from the semiconductor surface in the direction
x normal to the surface. The rP values of the different ions are distributed around the
average projected range RP: it is therefore of interest to determine the form N.rP/ of
such a distribution (called implanted proﬁle) around the average. Let P.rP/ be the
probability density of the implanted proﬁle, such that P.rP/ drP is the probability
that the end point of the trajectory of an ion lies between rP and rP C drP. From the
normalization condition

P.rP/ drP D 1 and from the deﬁnition (23.14) of the
dose it follows N.rP/ D Q P.rP/.
For the analysis of the implanted proﬁle, the simpliﬁed form of the trajectory
of an ion, shown in Fig. 23.8, is of help; the number of collisions shown is much
smaller than in realistic cases, and a two-dimensional path is assumed. Each portion
of the trajectory between two nuclear collisions is projected along the axis normal
to the semiconductor surface, the projections being labeled 1, 2, : : :; the projected
and lateral ranges are indicated as well. In the analysis, the length of each projection
is described by a probability density p.i/, such that p.i/ di is the probability
that the ith projection lies between i and i C d. The projections are assumed
to be independent from each other, with the same probability density applicable
to all; the projected range is the sum rP D 1 C 2 C    C n, and the issue is
to ﬁnd the probability density P.rP/. The conditions of the problem are those of the
random walk problem (Sect. C.18); also, the number of collisions is sufﬁciently high
to concentrate the majority of the projected ranges in the vicinity of the average.

If the provisional assumption is made that the probability density p.i/ complies

Deviations from the Gaussian Proﬁle
Experimental evidence shows that the actual implanted proﬁle deviates from the
Gaussian function derived in Sect. 23.7.3. Besides the approximations inherent in
the derivation of (23.43), two additional sources of error must be considered. They
are described with the aid of Fig. 23.9, representing the trajectories of three different
ions; symbols c1, c2, : : : indicate the impact parameters of each collision. For the
trajectory on the left it is assumed that a large number of collisions occur; this
trajectory partakes in the statistical treatment described above. One notes that the
collision characterized by c4, which is shorter than the other impact parameters,
produces a dislocation of the nucleus: the latter moves from the original lattice
position (the white dot) from a new position (the annular symbol). The trajectory
in the center describes an ion that enters the semiconductor in a position that is
practically symmetric with respect to the nuclei, so that the ion penetrates the

material for several lattice constants before suffering a sensible deviation due to
nuclear collisions. This event, called channeling, pertains to a small fraction of the
implanted ions; for such ions, the typical depth of the end points of the trajectories
is much larger than RP C RP: thus, channeling builds up a tail of the implanted
proﬁle that cannot be tackled with the statistical treatment shown above.9 Finally,
the trajectory on the right describes an ion that soon after entering the semiconductor
suffers a nuclear collision in which most of its kinetic energy is lost; such ions are a
small fraction of the total ions implanted, whence the statistical treatment above is
not applicable. The typical depth of their end points is much smaller than RP RP:
thus, the implanted proﬁle near the semiconductor surface turns out to be richer than
that predicted by the Gaussian distribution.
A sensible method to treat the deviations with respect to the theory of Sect. 23.7.3
is that of generalizing the Gaussian distribution by introducing more parameters
in it. To this purpose one observes from (23.43) that a normalized Gaussian
distribution, P D N=Q in this case, is characterized by two parameters: the mean
value RP, which is the moment of order 1 of the distribution (Sect. C.18), and
the standard deviation RP, which is obtained from the moment of order 2. It is
expected that the modiﬁed distribution will depend also on moments of order higher
than 2, or on parameters related to such moments. To this purpose one deﬁnes the
skewness  and kurtosis ˇ of a distribution P by the relations10
9Some techniques have been devised to reduce channeling. The basic idea is disrupting the
orderly arrangement “seen” by the ion when approaching the semiconductor. For instance, pre-
amorphization of the surface layers of the wafer, or growth of an insulating layer (e.g., thermally
grown silicon dioxide is amorphous). Another method consists in tilting the wafer with respect
to the incident beam; tilting angles are typically less than 15ı, with 7ı the preferred choice [88,
Chap. 11].
10It is assumed that RP ¤ 0. The units of  and ˇ are those of rP.

The skewness is an indicator of the asymmetry of the distribution about the

letting w D u2 yields ˇ D .4=p/  .5=2/ D 3, with  the Euler Gamma function
(Sect. C.10).
To express a more general distribution in terms of the moments it is convenient to
start from its differential form; to ease the notation one lets s D rP  RP,  D RP,

distributions, deﬁned by the equation

where the parameters a, b0, b1, and b2 must be expressed in terms of the moments

The Pearson distributions are thus deﬁned in terms of their moments of order

called Pearson IV distribution, in which the coefﬁcients satisfy the condition

11The moment of order 0 is the normalization condition, and that of order 1 speciﬁes the position

that the moments of order m > 1 are deﬁned with reference to that of order 1, namely, from the
average of .rP  RP/m.

23.7.5
Annealing
Ion implantation produces lattice damage; in addition, for most of the implanted
ions the end point of the trajectory does not coincide with a lattice site, namely,
the ion is not in a substitutional position. A thermal process (annealing) becomes
then necessary, to achieve i) removal of lattice damage by epitaxial regrowth of
the damaged layers, and ii) electrical activation of the implanted ions (namely, by
moving into the lattice sites the ions introduce electronic states in the expected
positions of the energy gap; in this way, they act as dopants proper). Annealing
also results in increasing carrier lifetimes and mobility. Different techniques are
available: thermal annealing, in which the wafer is kept for about 1 h in a furnace at
900–1000ıC; laser annealing, where local heating of the surface layers of the wafer
is induced by laser irradiation; rapid thermal annealing, where the surface layers
of the wafer are heated to about 1000ıC for a relatively short time (1–20 s) using
a tungsten halogen lamp. Thermal annealing modiﬁes the existing dopant proﬁles
due to thermal diffusion; this must be accounted for in the fabrication process of the
integrated circuit. A problem with laser annealing is that constructive or destructive
interferences occur when the laser wavelength is of the same order as the thicknesses
of the layers subjected to irradiation; the local difference in temperature may force
the layers to bend due to different thermal expansions. Rapid thermal annealing does
not suffer the drawbacks of the other two methods.

Generation and Destruction of Particles
The discussion carried out in Sect. 23.2 about the continuity equation implies the
possibility that particles may be generated or destroyed. To tackle this issue consider
the problem “counting the time variation of students in a classroom.” Assuming
that the classroom has only one exit, to accomplish the task it sufﬁces to count the
students that cross the exit, say, every second. The students that enter (leave) the
room are counted as a positive (negative) contribution.
Consider now a slightly modiﬁed problem: “counting the time variation of non-
sleeping students in a classroom.” To accomplish the task it does not sufﬁce anymore
to count the students that cross the exit. In fact, a student who is initially awake
inside the classroom may fall asleep where she sits (one assumes that sleeping
students do not walk); this provides a negative contribution to the time variation
sought, without the need of crossing the exit. Similarly, an initially sleeping student
may wake up, thus providing a positive contribution. Falling asleep (waking up) is
equivalent to destruction (creation) of a non-sleeping student.
In the two examples above the objects to be counted are the same, however, in the
second example they have an extra property that is not considered in the ﬁrst one.

23.8
Complements
699
This shows that creation/destruction of a given type of objects may occur or not,
depending on the properties that are considered. When particles instead of students
are investigated, it is often of interest to set up a continuity equation for describing
the time variation, in a given volume, of the particles whose energy belongs to a
speciﬁed range. Due to their motion, the particles undergo collisions that change
their energy. As a consequence a particle may enter, or leave, the speciﬁed energy
range without leaving the spatial volume to which the calculation applies. In this
example the origin of the net generation rate per unit volume W introduced in
Sect. 23.2 is the extra property about the particles’ energy.
23.8.2
Balance Relations
As indicated in Sect. 23.2, and with the provisions illustrated in Sect. 23.8.1, the
continuity equation is a balance relation for the number of particles. Due to
its intrinsic simplicity and generality, the concept of balance relation is readily
extended to physical properties different from the number of particles; for instance,
momentum, energy, energy ﬂux, and so on. A detailed illustration of this issue is
given in Chap. 19. It is also worth noting, in contrast, that the transport equation of
the diffusion type (23.4), being based on a speciﬁc assumption about the transport
mechanism, is less general than the continuity equation.
23.8.3
Lateral Diffusion
The treatment of predeposition and drive-in diffusion carried out in Sect. 23.5 is
based on a one-dimensional model. This implies that the concentration of the dopant
at the interface between the source and wafer regions is constant along the y and z
directions. In the practical cases this is impossible to achieve, because the area over
which the source is brought into contact with the wafer is ﬁnite. In fact, prior to
the predeposition step the surface of the wafer is covered with a protective layer,
called mask. As indicated in Sect. 24.1, in the current silicon technology the mask
is typically made of thermally grown silicon dioxide. Next, a portion of the mask is
removed to expose the silicon surface over a speciﬁc area, called window, through
which the predeposition step takes place.
From the description above it follows that the initial condition N0 of the predepo-
sition step is constant only within the window, while it is equal to zero in the other
parts of the y; z plane. This makes the hypothesis of a one-dimensional phenomenon
inappropriate, and calls for the use of the three-dimensional solution (23.28). The
subsequent drive-in diffusions must be treated in three dimensions as well, due to
the form of their initial conditions. An important effect is the diffusion of the dopant
underneath the edges of the mask. This phenomenon, called lateral diffusion, makes
the area where the doping proﬁle is present larger than the original mask, and must
be accounted for in the design of the integrated circuit.

on a speciﬁc transport model.
23.8.5
The Initial Condition of the Predeposition Step
The initial condition N0 of the predeposition step is given by the ﬁrst of (23.15).
To carry out the solution of the diffusion equation it is necessary to recast N0 in
an integral representation of the Fourier type. However, (23.15) does not fulﬁll the
condition (C.19) that is sufﬁcient for the existence of such a representation.
Nevertheless the solution procedure leading to (23.13) is still applicable. In fact,
remembering the deﬁnition (C.8) of the unit step function H, the initial condition
can be recast as N0./ D 2 C Œ1  H./. In turn, as shown in Appendix C.4, H can
be represented in the required form.

Chapter 24
Thermal Oxidation—Layer Deposition
24.1
Introduction
High-quality oxide is essential in silicon technology. The most important applica-
tions of the oxide are the passivation of the wafer’s surface, the isolation between
metallizations, the formation of masks for, e.g., diffusion or implantation of dopants,
the isolation between devices, and the formation of the gate insulator in MOS
devices.
While the oxides used for passivation or isolation between metallization are
typically obtained by chemical vapor deposition (Sect. 24.5), the oxide suitable for
the other applications listed above is obtained by thermal oxidation. In fact, the
extraordinary evolution of the VLSI technology in the last decades is due to a large
extent to the excellent electrical properties of the thermally grown layers of silicon
dioxide and to the reliability and control of the growth process.
In crystalline silicon dioxide (quartz), one silicon atom forms chemical bonds
with four oxygen atoms, creating a tetrahedral structure. In turn, one oxygen atom
forms chemical bonds with two silicon atoms. The tetrahedra are thus connected
to form a structure with a stoichiometric ratio 1 W 2 and density % D 2:65 g cm3
(Fig. 24.1). In thermally grown SiO2 not all tetrahedra are connected, because at the
silicon–oxide interface chemical bonds must be created with the pre-existing silicon
crystal, whose interatomic distance is different from that of SiO2. As a consequence,
the oxide has a shorter-range order giving rise to a more open (amorphous) structure
with density % D 2:20 g cm3. Because of this the diffusion of contaminants, in
most cases Na and Li ions [4], or H2O ions, is easier than in crystalline silicon
dioxide.
Also, the need of adapting to the silicon crystal produces a mechanical stress
in the oxide layer closer to the silicon surface, which in turn inﬂuences the
concentration of substrate defects and the value of some electrical properties in
MOS devices (typically, the threshold voltage, Sect. 22.8.2). The properties of
the mechanically stressed layer are inﬂuenced by the process temperature T. At

relatively low process temperatures, T < 950ıC, the stressed layer is thinner and
the mechanical stress in it is stronger; when T > 950ıC, the stress distributes over
a thicker layer and becomes locally weaker.
The growth of a thermal oxide’s layer is obtained by inducing a chemical reaction
between the silicon atoms belonging to the wafer and an oxidant species that is
brought into contact with it. As mentioned above, another technique for obtaining
an oxide layer is deposition. The latter process has actually a broader scope, in fact
it is used for depositing several types of conducting or insulating materials that are
necessary in the fabrication of the integrated circuits. Deposition differs from the
thermal growth because the chemical reaction may be absent or, if present, it does
not involve the species that are in the solid phase. One special type of deposition is
epitaxy, that is used to grow a crystalline layer over another crystalline layer.
This chapter illustrates the oxidation of silicon, starting from the description of
the chemical reactions involved in it, and deriving the relation between the thickness
of the oxide layer and that of the silicon layer consumed in its growth. The kinetics
of the oxide growth is analyzed, the linear–parabolic model is worked out, and its
features are commented. Then, a brief description of the deposition processes is
given, followed by the description of the chemical reaction involved in the epitaxial
process and by the analysis of the epitaxial kinetics.
In the last part of this chapter a number of complementary issues are discussed.
Speciﬁc data about the parameters governing the thermal oxidation, deposition, and
epitaxial processes in semiconductors are in [61, Chap. 2], [129, Chap. 9], [130,
Chap. 3], [88, Chap. 3]. Many carefully drawn illustrations are found in [93, Sec.
1.2].

Silicon Oxidation

24.2
Silicon Oxidation
Silicon exposed to air at room temperature oxidizes spontaneously and forms a
shallow layer of SiO2 of about 1 nm called native oxide. As soon as the native oxide
is formed, the oxygen molecules of the air cannot reach the silicon surface anymore
and the chemical reaction dies out. In fact, oxidation of silicon is caused by the
inward motion of the oxidant. To activate the reaction and grow a layer of the desired
thickness it is necessary to place the wafers at atmospheric pressure in a furnace
(Fig. 24.2) kept at a temperature in the range 800ıC  T  1;200ıC. This increases
the diffusion coefﬁcient of the oxidant. The latter penetrates the already-formed
oxide layer and reaches the silicon surface, where new SiO2 molecules are formed.
The furnace is made of a quartz or polycrystalline-silicon tube heated by a
resistance or by induction through a radiofrequency coil. To grow the oxide layer
in a reproducible way it is necessary to control the temperature inside the furnace
within ˙1ıC. The oxidant is introduced from one end of the furnace after being
mixed with a carrier gas (typically, N2 or Ar).
The chemical reactions involved in the growth of thermal oxide are different
depending on the type of oxidant. The latter is either molecular oxygen (O2)
or steam (H2O). The corresponding thermal growth is called, respectively, dry
oxidation or wet (steam) oxidation. The reactions read
Si C O2 • SiO2 ;
Si C 2H2O • SiO2 C 2H2 ;
(24.1)
where the hydrogen molecules produced by the second reaction are eliminated by
the carrier gas. The formation of SiO2 molecules is accompanied by a change in
volume. In fact, each newly formed SiO2 molecule uses up a silicon atom initially
belonging to the silicon crystal. On the other hand, the concentration of the silicon
atoms in a silicon crystal is about N1 D 5:0  1022 cm3, while that of the silicon

with A the area of the oxidized region. In other terms, when an oxide layer of thick-
ness s is grown, the silicon–oxide interface shifts by 0:44 s with respect to the orig-
inal position (Fig. 24.3). If the oxidation takes place uniformly over the whole area
of the wafer, the shift of the interface is uniform as well. However, in many cases the
oxidation involves only portions of the wafer’s area. This makes the silicon–oxide
interface nonplanar, because the shift is different from one portion to another.
24.3
Oxide-Growth Kinetics
Growth kinetics is modeled after Deal and Grove [38]. The model describes the
sequence of steps by which the oxidant, initially in the gaseous phase, comes into
contact with silicon and reacts with it. The steps are: the oxidant i) diffuses from the
source region into the already-formed oxide, ii) crosses the oxide still by diffusion
and reaches the silicon–oxide interface, iii) produces a chemical reaction that forms
a new SiO2 molecule.
The motion of the gas parallel to the wafer surface is not considered. As a
consequence, the only nonvanishing component of the oxidant average velocity
has the direction x normal to the wafer surface. The corresponding ﬂux density is

F D Fi, with i the unit vector parallel to x. The oxidant concentration N is assumed
uniform over the wafer’s surface, thus making N and F to depend on x and t only.
The concentration of the oxidant in the bulk of the gaseous phase, NG, is a known
boundary condition because it is regulated by the microprocessors controlling the
furnace. In the gaseous region, at the gas–oxide interface, and in the oxide region, no
generation or destruction of oxidant molecules occurs. The ﬂux density is given by
F D DS

F D DO

(24.4)
respectively in the source and oxide region. In (24.4), the symbol DS (DO) indicates
the diffusion coefﬁcient of the oxidant in the source (oxide) region. Each diffusion
coefﬁcient is taken independent of time and spatially constant in its own region.
The matching conditions at the source–oxide interface are the same as in (23.20),
namely,

(24.5)
where k is the gas–oxide segregation coefﬁcient, while the index S (O) attached
to the concentration or its derivative indicates that the function is calculated at the
source–oxide interface on the side of the source (oxide). As one of the two phases
is gaseous, it is DS  DO whence j.@N=@x/Sj  j.@N=@x/Oj. The situation here is
similar to that illustrated in Fig. 23.3. It follows that the interface concentration of
the source region, NS, is practically equal to the boundary condition NG. The ﬁrst
of (24.5) then yields NO D k NG.
To proceed one observes that due to the thinness of the oxide layer, the oxidant
concentration in it can be described by a linear approximation. Due to this, the ﬂux
density in the oxide layer (the second equation in (24.4)) becomes
F D DO
NI  NO
s
D DO
kNG  NI

;
(24.6)
where NI is the oxidant concentration on the oxide side of the silicon–oxide
interface, and s the oxide thickness. Note that the ﬂux density in (24.6) is constant
with respect to x, whereas it is time dependent because s increases with time.
When the oxidant reaches the silicon–oxide interface it reacts with silicon, so that
there is no ﬂux density of the oxidant on the semiconductor’s side of this interface.
In fact, the oxidant’s molecules are destroyed at the interface to form molecules of
SiO2. The ﬂux density FI entering the silicon–oxide interface gives the number of
oxidant molecules destroyed per unit area and time which, to a ﬁrst approximation,
is taken proportional to the concentration NI. It follows
FI D vr NI ;
(24.7)

where the constant vr (m s1) is called reaction velocity. As FI is just another
symbol to denote the spatially constant ﬂux density within the oxide, one com-
bines (24.7) with (24.6) to obtain

(24.8)
At a given instant equation (24.8) expresses NI in terms of the boundary condition
NG, the process parameters k, DO, vr, and the oxide thickness s.
24.4
Linear-Parabolic Model of the Oxide Growth
The relation between the oxidant’s ﬂux density F and the growth velocity ds=dt of
the oxide layer is found as follows. Letting A be the area of the oxidized region, the
product A F provides the number of oxidant molecules reaching the silicon–oxide
interface per unit time. Each molecule, in turn, makes the volume V of the oxide
layer to increase by a ﬁnite amount w. As a consequence, the volume increase per
unit time of the oxide layer is dV=dt D wA F. As shown in Sect. 24.2, the oxide layer
is free to expand only in the direction normal to the wafer, so that dV=dt D A ds=dt.
Combining the above relations and using (24.7, 24.8) yield a differential equation
in the unknown s:
ds

with si D s.t D 0/. The relation between s and t given by (24.10) is called linear–
parabolic model of the oxide growth. The quantities cp (m2 s1) and cl (m s1) are
the parabolic coefﬁcient and linear coefﬁcient, respectively. The model is recast as

Using (24.11) and the deﬁnitions (24.10) of cp and cl one ﬁnds two limiting cases
of the s.t/ relation. Speciﬁcally, it is s ' cl .t C/ when the oxide thickness is such
that vr s  2 D, while it is s ' Œcp .t C /1=2 when the oxide thickness is such that
vr s  2 D. Due to the form of cp and cl, in the ﬁrst limiting case the oxide growth
does not depend on the diffusion coefﬁcient DO, whereas in the second limiting
case it does not depend on the reaction velocity vr. This is easily understood if

24.4
Linear-Parabolic Model of the Oxide Growth
709
one considers that the concentration NO D k NG is prescribed. As a consequence,
as long as the oxide thickness is small the derivative of the concentration (hence
the ﬂux density) is limited essentially by the ﬂux density entering the silicon–oxide
interface, (24.7); on the contrary, when the oxide thickness becomes large the ﬂux
density is limited essentially by the diffusion across the oxide because the value of
the concentration NI at the silicon–oxide interface becomes less important.
The linear-parabolic model (24.11) is recast in terms of dimensionless variables
by multiplying both sides by c2
l =cp, thus yielding .cl s=cp/2Ccl s=cp D c2
l .tC/=cp.
Inverting the latter yields the curve shown in Fig. 24.6; the two limiting cases are
reported as well. The differential form of (24.11),

;
(24.12)
is a linear relation between dt=ds and s. Such quantities can be measured indepen-
dently from each other, thus providing a method for measuring cp and cl. Repeating
the measurement at different temperatures shows that the temperature dependence
of the parabolic and linear coefﬁcients is given by
cp D cp0 expŒEap=.kBT/ ;
cl D cl0 expŒEal=.kBT/ :
(24.13)
The form of (24.13) is due to the temperature dependence of D / expŒEap=.kBT/
and, respectively, vr / expŒEal=.kBT/. In fact, the parameters w, NG that appear
in the deﬁnitions (24.10) are independent of temperature, whereas the temperature
dependence of the segregation coefﬁcient k, that can be measured independently, is
shown to be relatively weak.
The measurement of cp and cl allows one to determine also other properties of the
oxidation process; for instance, the effect of carrying out a steam or dry oxidation,
and the inﬂuence of the substrate orientation. As for the ﬁrst issue one ﬁnds
k.Steam/ > k.Dry/ ;
DO.Steam/ > DO.Dry/ :
(24.14)
The Arrhenius plots of cp and cl are shown in Figs. 24.4 and 24.5, respectively.
In each plot the upper (lower) continuous curve refers to the steam (dry) oxidation.
As for the effect of the crystal orientation of the silicon wafer, one observes that
the number of chemical reactions per unit time involved in the formation of SiO2
molecules must depend on the surface density of silicon atoms at the silicon–oxide
interface. Due to this, the reaction velocity is expected to depend on the orientation
of the interface. The crystal planes that are typically used in the silicon technology
are the .111/ one, whose surface density is 11:8  1014 cm2, and those equivalent
to the .100/ one,1 whose surface density is 6:8  1014 cm2. In fact the experiments
show that

Layer Deposition and Selective Oxide Growth
The deposition of ﬁlms of different materials is necessary at several steps of
the integrated-circuit fabrication. Conducting materials provide the electrical con-
nections among the individual devices of the integrated circuit, while insulating
materials provide the electrical insulation between the metal layers, and the protec-
tion from the environment. The majority of the deposition processes take place in
the vapor phase under reduced-pressure or vacuum conditions. One exception is the
deposition of resist, which is carried out in the liquid phase.
When the material to be deposited does not react chemically with other sub-
stances, the process is called physical vapor deposition (PVD). An example of
PVD is the deposition of a metal by evaporation in vacuo. When the material to
be deposited is the product of a chemical reaction that takes place over the wafer
surface or in its vicinity, the process is called chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
The materials that are most widely used in CVD processes are polycrystalline
silicon (also termed polysilicon), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and silicon nitride (Si3N4).
Examples of CVD reactions are given in Table 24.1. More examples are found in
[130, Sect. 6-2].

The structure of the deposited layer depends on the substrate’s properties and
deposition conditions. In the manufacturing of integrated circuits the substrate is
crystalline, that is, it has long-range order extending throughout the entire volume
(Chap. 17). If the material to be deposited on a crystalline substrate is the same as
that of the substrate, by means of a carefully controlled process it is possible to
obtain a deposited layer that replicates the substrate’s structure. Such a process is
called epitaxy and, with reference to silicon, is described in Sect. 24.6.
The structure of silicon deposited on a different material is polycrystalline, that is,
it has a long-range order only within small volumes. Such volumes, called grains,
have an average diameter of about 1 
m and are oriented randomly with respect
to each other. Polycrystalline silicon is used for fabricating the gate electrodes in
MOS devices, for obtaining ohmic contacts to shallow junctions, and for producing
resistors. To increase the gate’s conductivity, a layer of metal or metal silicide (like
tungsten or tantalum silicide) may be deposited over the polycrystalline silicon.
The structure of deposited SiO2 or Si3N4 is amorphous, that is, it has a short-
range order only. The applications of SiO2 have been illustrated in Sect. 24.1. Silicon
nitride Si3N4 provides a strong barrier to the diffusion of water, that corrodes
the metallizations, and of other contaminants, like sodium, that make the devices
unstable by changing their threshold voltage. In addition, Si3N4 is resistant to high
temperatures and oxidizes slowly. For these reasons it is used for passivating the
wafer and for producing the masks that are necessary for the selective oxidation
of silicon. The latter process, also called local oxidation (LOCOS), consists in
depositing and patterning a Si3N4 layer over the areas where the substrate’s
oxidation must be prevented. As oxidation is isotropic, a lateral penetration of the
oxidized region occurs under the edge of Si3N4. This produces a characteristic
proﬁle of the oxide layer called bird’s beak (Fig. 24.7). To compensate for the
effect of the lateral penetration, the Si3N4 mask must be larger than the area whose
oxidation is to be prevented.
A layer replicates the topography of the surface onto which it is deposited. For
this reason it is important to avoid, or reduce, the formation of steps on the substrate.
In fact, over a step the layer’s thickness is smaller than on a ﬂat surface (Fig. 24.8)
which, in turn, may cause reliability problems in the ﬁnal circuit. For instance, the
nonuniform thickness of a metal line causes a nonuniform distribution of the current
density. This may induce metal migration and the eventual breakdown of the metal
connection.

Epitaxy
Epitaxy (from the Greek verb epitàsso, “to deploy side by side”) is used to grow a
monocrystalline layer over another monocrystalline layer. Most epitaxial processes
use the CVD method. When the epitaxial layer is made of the same material as
the substrate, e.g., silicon over silicon, the term homoepitaxy is also used, while
the term heteroepitaxy is reserved to the case where the materials are different.
Heteroepitaxy is possible when the difference between the lattice constants2 of
the two materials is small. An example of heteroepitaxy is the silicon-on-sapphire
(SOS) process that belongs to the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technological family
and consists in growing a thin layer of silicon (about 0:5 
m) on a wafer made of a
sapphire crystal (Al2O3). Another application of heteroepitaxy is the fabrication of
the heterojunctions that are necessary in optoelectronic devices.
In the silicon technology, epitaxy originated from the need of producing high-
resistance layers in bipolar technology. This type of layers is necessary, e.g.,
for realizing the collector region of the bipolar junction transistor, whose dopant
concentration must be substantially lower than that of the base region (Sect. 21.8).
Due to the high temperature of the CVD process (about 1;200ıC), during an
epitaxy a diffusion occurs of the substrate dopant into the epitaxial layer and of
the epitaxial-layer’s dopant into the substrate. This effect must be accounted for,
and compensated, at the design stage of the process.
2The deﬁnition of lattice constant is given in Sect. 17.6.4.

Thermal Oxidation—Layer Deposition
The fundamental reaction of epitaxy combines silicon tetrachloride SiCl4 with
molecular hydrogen in the vapor phase to obtain silicon in solid phase, while the
hydrochloric acid HCl remains in the vapor phase and is eliminated:
SiCl4 C 2H2 • Si C 4HCl :
(24.16)
Reaction (24.16) is reversible: an excess of HCl removes silicon atoms from the
wafer’s surface and releases SiCl4 and 2H2 in the vapor phases. This reaction is
used in the ﬁrst stages of the process to the purpose of cleaning the wafer’s surface.
Besides (24.16), a secondary reaction takes place as well, namely,
SiCl4 C Si ! 2SiCl2 :
(24.17)
Reaction (24.17) removes silicon from the wafer’s surface and releases silicon
dichloride SiCl2 in the vapor phase. For this reason, reactions (24.16) and (24.17)
compete with each other. When the vapor concentration of SiCl4 is sufﬁciently low
the ﬁrst reaction prevails and the thickness of the epitaxial layer increases with time.
In contrast, at higher SiCl4 concentrations the second reaction prevails and silicon
is etched.
The epitaxial layer is doped by introducing hydrides of the dopants into the vapor
phase. The hydride, e.g., arsine (AsH3), phosphine (PH3), or diborane (B2H6), is
absorbed on the surface, decomposes, and is incorporated in the growing layer, e.g.,
2AsH3 ! 2As C 3H2 :
(24.18)
24.7
Kinetics of Epitaxy
As in the case of the oxide-growth kinetics (Sect. 24.3), the motion of the vapor
parallel to the wafer surface is not considered. As a consequence, the only
nonvanishing component of the average velocity of the SiCl4 molecules has the
direction x normal to the wafer surface. The corresponding ﬂux density is F D F  i,
with i the unit vector parallel to x. The SiCl4 concentration N is assumed uniform
over the wafer’s surface, thus making N and F to depend on x and t only.
The SiCl4 concentration in the bulk of the vapor phase, NG, is a known boundary
condition because it is regulated by the microprocessors controlling the furnace. The
ﬂux density is given by
F D D @N
@x ' vG .NG  NI/ ;

24.7
Kinetics of Epitaxy
715
where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of SiCl4 in the vapor phase and NI the SiCl4
concentration at the wafer’s surface. The diffusion coefﬁcient is taken independent
of time and spatially constant. The form of the right-hand side of (24.19), where the
parameter vG (m s1) is called gas-phase, mass-transfer coefﬁcient, is due to the
observation that D is very large because the diffusion takes place in the vapor phase.
As a consequence, the derivative @N=@x is so small that a linear approximation for
N is acceptable (the situation here is similar to that illustrated for the region on the
left of the origin in Fig. 23.3). Note that the ﬂux density in the vapor phase (24.19)
is constant with respect to x. In principle it depends on time because the extension
of the vapor phase decreases due to the growth of the epitaxial layer. However, this
time dependence can be disregarded because the relative variation in the vapor-phase
extension is negligible.
The ﬂux density FI entering the silicon surface gives the number of SiCl4
molecules destroyed per unit area and time which, to a ﬁrst approximation, is taken
proportional to the concentration NI. It follows
FI D vr NI ;
(24.20)
where the constant vr (m s1), as in the case of the oxide-growth kinetics, is called
reaction velocity. As FI is just another symbol to denote the spatially constant ﬂux
density, one combines (24.20) with (24.19) to obtain
NI D
vG
vr C vG
NG :
(24.21)
At a given instant equation (24.21) expresses NI in terms of the boundary condition

The relation between the ﬂux density F of SiCl4 and the growth velocity ds=dt
of the epitaxial layer is found by the same reasoning as that used in Sect. 24.4 for
the growth velocity of SiO2. From (24.20, 24.21) it follows

The s.t/ relation (24.23) is linear with respect to time. The growth velocity cl of
the epitaxial layer depends on the concentration NG of SiCl4 at the boundary and on
the process parameters w, vr, and vG. The temperature dependence of the gas-phase
mass-transfer coefﬁcient vG is weak. As w and NG are independent of temperature,
the temperature dependence of cl is to be ascribed to vr. It is found

An Apparent Contradiction
In commenting (24.6) it was noted that the ﬂux density F in the oxidation process is
constant with respect to x, whereas it depends on time due to the time dependence
of the oxide thickness s. This seems to bring about a contradiction. In fact, as
the one-dimensional form of the continuity equation (23.3) with W D 0 yields
@N=@t C @F=@x D 0, the constancy of F makes N independent of time. However,
N does depend on time. This is demonstrated by Fig. 24.10 that shows the linear
approximation of the oxidant concentration within the oxide at two different
instants, t1 and t2 > t1. The value k NG at the source–oxide interface is kept constant
by the boundary condition as explained in Sect. 24.3, while the value NI at the
silicon–oxide interface changes with time due to (24.8), and the oxide’s thickness
changes as well.
The contradiction is eliminated by observing that the continuity equation (23.3)
has been derived for the case where the boundary is ﬁxed, whereas the growth
of thermal oxide is a moving-boundary process. The motion of the boundary is
not a rigid one (otherwise the problem could be ﬁxed by moving the reference

accordingly), because the oxide volume is actually expanding. In conclusion, equa-
tion (23.3) must not be used. In fact, the derivation of the linear–parabolic model of
the oxide growth (24.10) is based solely on the deﬁnition of the ﬂux density.
24.8.2
Elementary Contributions to the Layer’s Volume
The relation ds=dt D w FI was used to connect, in Sect. 24.4, the growth velocity
of the oxide layer to the ﬂux density of the oxidant and, in Sect. 24.7, the growth
velocity of the epitaxial layer to the ﬂux density of SiCl4. The coefﬁcient w is the
amount by which one oxidant or SiCl4 molecule makes the volume of the layer to
increase. To specify w for the oxidation process one must distinguish between the
dry and steam cases. In the ﬁrst one, each molecule of the oxidant produces one
SiO2 molecule. As a consequence, w is the volume of the SiO2 molecule. In the
steam case, two H2O molecules are necessary for producing one SiO2 molecule,
hence w is half the volume of the latter. By the same token, in the epitaxial process
w is the volume of a Si atom.
24.8.3
Features of the Oxide Growth and Epitaxial Growth
The quadratic term in the left-hand side of (24.10) becomes dominant at larger
oxide thicknesses. This in turn slows down the growth rate, as shown by (24.9).
A qualitative explanation of the phenomenon is easily obtained by considering that
in order to reach the silicon–oxide interface, the oxidant must diffuse across the
already-formed oxide. The slope of the oxidant concentration, hence its ﬂux density,
decreases with time because the thickness of the oxide region increases, while the
value k NG at the source–oxide interface is kept constant by the boundary condition.

718
24
Thermal Oxidation—Layer Deposition
The decrease in the oxidant concentration NI at the silicon–oxide interface, shown
by (24.8), is not sufﬁcient to contrast the decrease in the concentration’s slope. The
reasoning above does not apply to the epitaxial growth; in fact, in this case the
chemical reaction occurs at the vapor–silicon interface and there is no intermediate
layer to be crossed. As a consequence, the corresponding model (24.23) has no
quadratic term.
In the analysis of the oxide-growth kinetics carried out in Sect. 24.3 it is assumed
that the interface concentration in the source region, NS, is practically equal to the
boundary condition NG. The simpliﬁcation is used in the expression (24.6) of the
ﬂux density in the oxide layer. The calculation then proceeds by considering only the
oxidant diffusion across the already-formed layer and the chemical reaction at the
silicon–oxide interface. In this respect, the assumption NS D NG has the mere effect
of introducing a negligible change in (24.6). A similar approximation would not be
possible in the analysis of the epitaxial growth. In fact, letting NI D NG in (24.19)
would set the ﬂux density to zero. The difference between the two cases is that in the
epitaxial growth the ﬂux density exists only in the vapor phase, while in the oxide
growth it exists both in the gaseous and solid phases. However, as DS  DO, only
the diffusion in the solid phase plays a signiﬁcant role in determining the kinetics of
the oxidation process.
24.8.4
Reaction Velocity
The reaction velocity vr is among the parameters used in the analysis of the oxide-
growth kinetics and epitaxial kinetics. This parameter controls the ﬂux density
through (24.7) or (24.20), and is found to depend also on the concentration Ndop
of dopant atoms in the silicon lattice. The dependence is negligible as long as
Ndop  ni.T/, where ni (called intrinsic concentration, Sect. 18.3) is calculated at
the process temperature. When Ndop > ni.T/, the reaction velocity increases with
Ndop. It should be noted that ni ' 1018 cm3 at T D 1;000ıC. As a consequence,
the dependence of vr on Ndop becomes important only at relatively high dopant
concentrations.
24.8.5
Molecular Beam Epitaxy
Epitaxy can also be obtained by a process different from CVD, that is called
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and is based on evaporation. The main advantages
of MBE are the low-temperature processing and the ﬁne control of the dopant
distribution throughout the epitaxial layer. On the other side, MBE has a low
throughput and a higher cost. As a consequence, CVD is used is in the majority
of cases for growing epitaxial layers in the silicon technology [130, Sect. 6-3].

Secondary Reaction in the Epitaxial Growth
The analysis of the epitaxial kinetics carried out in Sect. 24.7 is based on the hypoth-
esis that only the fundamental reaction (24.16) is present. However, as mentioned in
Sect. 24.7, the secondary reaction (24.17) also takes place, which removes silicon
atoms from the wafer’s surface and, therefore, competes with (24.16). At low
concentrations of SiCl4 the effect of the secondary reaction is negligible and the
theory of Sect. 24.7 holds; in particular, as shown by (24.23), the growth velocity cl
is proportional to the concentration NG of SiCl4 in the bulk of the vapor phase. At
larger tetrachloride concentrations the dependence of cl on NG becomes sublinear
as shown in Fig. 24.11. Further increases in NG make cl to continuously decrease,
and to eventually vanish when the secondary reaction balances the fundamental one.
Further on, the secondary reaction prevails and cl becomes negative, that is, silicon
is etched.
The growth velocity also inﬂuences the structure of the epitaxial layer. When
cl is low the deposited silicon atoms match the preexisting crystalline structure, so
that the newly formed layer is crystalline as well. Higher values of cl make the
matching more and more difﬁcult. Beyond a critical value of cl the epitaxial layer is
polycrystalline, as sketched in Fig. 24.11. To avoid the growth of a polycrystal it is
necessary to keep the SiCl4 concentration in the range shown in the ﬁgure.

Measuring the Semiconductor Parameters
25.1
Introduction
A number of methods used for measuring the semiconductor parameters are
illustrated here. Apart from the intrinsic usefulness, the methods are interesting
because they show the connection with the theories worked out in other chapters.
For example, the measurement of lifetimes exploits the features of the net thermal
recombination and of optical generation, that are combined in a simpliﬁed form
of the continuity equation for the minority carriers. Similarly, the measurement of
mobility carried out with the Haynes-Shockley experiment is based on a clever use
of the diffusion of optically generated carriers. The Hall effect, in turn, provides a
powerful method to extract the information about the concentration and mobility of
the majority carriers; the method exploits the effect of a magnetic ﬁeld applied in the
direction normal to that of the current density, and is widely used for determining,
e.g., the dependence of concentration and mobility on the concentration of dopants
and on temperature. The analysis of the Hall effect is enriched by a detailed
treatment of the case where the standard theory is not applicable because the device
is not sufﬁciently slender; a deeper analysis based on the concept of stream function
shows that the equations describing the current-density ﬁeld are in fact solvable
for any aspect ratio of the device. This chapter is completed by the illustration
of a method for measuring the doping proﬁle in an asymmetric, reverse-biased,
one-dimensional junction; the procedure is based on the observation that despite
the fact that the relation between the applied voltage and the extension of the
space-charge region is nonlinear, the differential capacitance of the junction has
the same form as that of a parallel-plate, linear capacitor. Finally, the van der Pauw
method for measuring the conductivity of a sample is illustrated, based on the use
of a two-dimensional Green function introduced in an earlier chapter and on the
conformal-mapping method shown in the Appendix.

Measuring the Semiconductor Parameters
25.2
Lifetime Measurement
The lifetimes have been introduced in Sect. 20.2.3 with reference to the trap-
assisted, thermal generation and recombination phenomena. A measurement
method for the lifetimes is illustrated here with the aid of Fig. 25.1 that shows
a uniformly doped, thin layer of semiconductor of length L and cross-section A.
The method is able to measure the minority-carrier lifetime; in the example shown in
the ﬁgure, which refers to an n-doped material, the outcome is p. The x axis is taken
normal to the external surface of the semiconductor, with the origin placed on such
a surface. The latter, parallel to the y; z plane, is illuminated with a monochromatic
radiation of frequency , whose intensity is uniform over the surface and constant
in time. Remembering the expression (20.67) of the optical-generation term, and
observing that due to uniformity the absorption coefﬁcient does not depend on
position, one ﬁnds
GO D  ˚B k exp .k x/ ;
k D k./ :
(25.1)
At the same time, a constant voltage V is applied to the semiconductor, producing
an electric ﬁeld in the z direction. The device is thin in the x and y directions, and
elongated in the z direction, to the extent that the ﬂow lines of the current density
are substantially parallel to the z axis; also, the small extension in the x direction
makes it possible to neglect the x-dependence of GO and let GO ' Gc D  ˚B k.
With these premises,1 the material is spatially uniform also in the nonequilibrium
case; it follows that the condition of local charge neutrality holds. For simplicity
one assumes that the n-dopant concentration ND is sufﬁciently low to ensure that
nondegeneracy and complete ionization hold, NC
D D ND; thus, local neutrality reads
n D p C ND :
(25.2)
The nonequilibrium condition prescribed by the combination of illumination and
bias is adjusted in such a way that a weak-injection condition holds (Sect. 20.2.3);
in this case the hole-continuity equation (19.124) reads

(25.4)
showing that optical generation is exactly balanced by thermal recombination. If, at
time t D 0, the source of light is removed, Gc vanishes and recombination prevails;
it follows that the semiconductor undergoes a transient to adapt to the new situation.
On the other hand, spatial uniformity still holds: during the transient the spatial

of (25.5) is found to be
p D pGc exp.t=p/ :
(25.6)
To determine the conductivity of the device it is necessary to ﬁnd the electron
concentration n or, equivalently, the difference n D n  nn0. This is easily
accomplished by observing that spatial uniformity holds also during the transient;
as a consequence, the condition of local charge neutrality (25.2) applies. At the end
of the transient, the latter becomes nn0 D pn0 C ND which, subtracted from (25.2),
yields n D p at all times. The semiconductor conductivity (19.134) can then be
written

(25.7)
with 0 D q .n nn0 C p pn0/ and p D q .n C p/ p Gc. In the one-dimensional,
uniform case considered here, the current is the product of the current density times
the cross-section A of the device, and the electric ﬁeld is the ratio of the applied
voltage to the length L (Fig. 25.1). In conclusion, for t > 0 the current I D V=R D

I D I0 C Ip exp.t=p/ ;
(25.8)
with I0 D 0 .A=L/ V, Ip D p .A=L/ V, namely, the current’s decay time is the
minority-carrier lifetime. The quantity to be measured is the current through the
device which, for t < 0, is equal to the constant I0 C Ip, while it decreases
exponentially towards I0 for t > 0 (Fig. 25.2). The measurement of p is easily
accomplished by observing that the tangent to the exponential branch drawn at the

Thermal Velocity and Capture Cross-Section
In an n-doped material the hole lifetime is related to the hole-transition coefﬁcient
˛p and to the trap concentration Nt by p D p0 D 1=.˛pNt/ (Sect. 20.2.3). It follows
that measuring p after deliberately introducing a known concentration Nt of traps
into the semiconductor provides the value of the transition coefﬁcient ˛p. The latter
is often recast in a different form by deﬁning the carrier thermal velocity uth with
the relation

where m D me for electrons and m D mh for holes, with me, mh the average

Mobility Measurement—Haynes-Shockley Experiment
A measurement method for mobility is illustrated with the aid of Fig. 25.3, showing
a uniformly doped layer of semiconductor to which a constant positive voltage V is
applied; this produces an electric ﬁeld in the x direction, E D E i1. The method is
able to measure the minority-carrier mobility; in the example shown in the ﬁgure,
which refers to an n-doped material, the outcome is p.
Holes are generated at some position x by, e.g., illuminating the material with
a laser pulse. The electric ﬁeld makes the holes to drift to the right, where they
are eventually collected after crossing a distance x1 in the direction parallel to E.

3The fact that the size of the capture cross-section is sometimes similar, like in the present case,
to the size of an atom may explain the popularity of expressing the capture phenomenon in terms
of cross-sections. This, however, oversimpliﬁes the problem: capture cross-sections, in fact, range
from 1025 to 1012 cm2 [12, Sect. 4.1.2].

instant of the laser pulse; the other two proﬁles are shifted to the right because of
the action of the ﬁeld. The hole distribution becomes progressively wider and shorter
because of diffusion; also, its area decreases with time due to recombination. When
the proﬁle crosses the section corresponding to the measuring electrode, the largest
value of the measured voltage VS corresponds to the proﬁle’s peak. This allows one
to measure the time t necessary for the proﬁle’s peak to cover the distance from
the section where the laser pulse is applied to that of the measuring electrode. Then,
the average velocity of the peak is found from x1=t.
The analysis of the experiment is carried out assuming that the perturbation is
sufﬁciently small, so that a weak-injection condition holds. The continuity equation

25.4
Hall-Voltage Measurement
The measurements based on the Hall effect are a powerful investigation tool that
exploits the combined action of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld. The Hall effect is
the production of a voltage drop, transverse to the direction of the electric current,
due to the application of a magnetic ﬁeld. The qualitative features of the method
are explained with the aid of Fig. 25.4. Consider a uniformly doped, prismatic
block of semiconductor. The block is slender, and a constant voltage V is applied
to it to produce an electric ﬁeld E aligned with the longitudinal direction. As a
consequence, one can assume that the ﬂow lines of the current density be parallel to
E; due to spatial uniformity, such a current density is essentially due to the drift of
majority carriers. At the same time, a constant magnetic-induction ﬁeld B is applied,
normal to one of the lateral faces. The upper part of the ﬁgure refers to an n-doped
semiconductor; there, the majority carriers are electrons, whose average velocity
is oriented opposite to the ﬁeld; it follows that the Lorentz force F D % v ^ B
(Sect. 4.11) is oriented as shown in the ﬁgure. The negative indices in the expression
of the Lorentz force remind one that the charge density and average velocity are
those of negative charges. The mobile electrons are pushed by the Lorentz force
towards the lower face of the device, where they form a negative charge layer.
The ﬂow lines of the current density are still parallel to the longitudinal direction;
however, their density is not uniform anymore. Due to the global charge neutrality,
the negative charge layer is compensated by a positive charge layer that forms at the
upper face. The two opposite layers, schematically indicated in the diagram in the
upper-right part of Fig. 25.4, produce an electric ﬁeld normal to the upper and lower
faces; as a result, a measurable voltage drop (Hall voltage) between the two faces
comes into existence: for the example in hand, the voltage of the upper face is larger
than that of the lower face.

Hall-Voltage Measurement

In a p-doped semiconductor (lower part of the ﬁgure), the majority carriers are
holes, whose average velocity is oriented in the direction of the ﬁeld; the Lorentz
force F D %C vC ^ B is oriented as in the previous case, because both charge
density and average velocity change sign with respect to the n-doped semiconductor.
The consequence is that the mobile holes are pushed towards the lower face of the
device, where they form a positive charge layer. In conclusion, the sign of the Hall
voltage is opposite with respect to the case of the n-doped semiconductor.
The analysis of the experiment is based on the drift-diffusion equations incor-
porating the magnetic terms, (19.107), (19.123); the diffusion terms are neglected,

shown below; while  is positive deﬁnite, r has a sign. In particular, the following
limiting cases hold: for the p-type dopant it is p  n, whence  ' q p p and
r ' ap=.q p/ > 0; thus,

From (25.28) and (25.29) it follows that the concentration and mobility of the
majority carriers can be determined independently, provided  and r are known.
In turn, the measurement of  and r is easily carried out by applying (25.26) to the
prismatic sample of Fig. 25.4. Let iL be the unit vector of the longitudinal direction,
and iW the unit vector parallel to B, so that B D B iW. Observing that EW D 0,

namely, the two parameters are obtained by combining the Hall voltage with
other known physical and geometrical parameters. Typical applications of the
measurement scheme shown in this section are the measurements of concentrations
and mobilities as functions of temperature and dopant concentration.
25.5
Hall Voltage—Arbitrary Aspect Ratio
The measurement technique based on the Hall effect, outlined in Sect. 25.4, is based
on the hypothesis that the sample under investigation is slender, so that the ﬂow lines
of the current density are aligned with the longitudinal direction, whose unit vector
is iL, and the contacts where the Hall voltage is measured are far away from the
contacts onto which the external perturbation is applied. A typical arrangement is
that shown in Fig. 25.4, where the contacts used for measuring the Hall voltage are
in the mid section of the sample. In more realistic situations the device of interest
exhibits geometrical features that do not allow for the approximations listed above.
As a typical example, consider the device shown in Fig. 25.5, which is used for
measuring the conductivity and the Hall voltage. The former quantity is measured by
the four-contact, van der Pauw method outlined in Sect. 25.7: for this, the contacts
labeled c1, c2, c3, c4, also termed Hall probes, are used, while the two lateral contacts
k1, k2 are left open. In turn, the Hall voltage VH is measured at a pair of Hall probes,
e.g., c1 and c3, after applying the external perturbation to the lateral contacts and a
magnetic induction B normal to the x; y plane. Here it is assumed for simplicity that
the external perturbation is a constant current I forced into the device.
To decrease the relative error in the conductivity measurement, for a given length
L of the device it is preferable to place the probes near the contacts, like in Fig. 25.5;
on the other hand, considering that the contacts are equipotential, to measure the
Hall voltage it would be preferable to place the probes far away from the contacts,
to avoid a possible perturbation due to the proximity of the equipotential regions
created by the contacts themselves. Clearly, the latter constraint is incompatible
with the former. Even if a third pair of Hall probes was placed at the mid section

of the sample, when the latter is not sufﬁciently elongated the ratio H=L inﬂuences
the distribution of the current density, again due to the presence of the equipotential
regions.
In the experimental setup for the measurement of conductivity and Hall voltage,
the thickness h of the active region (i.e., in the z direction normal to the x; y plane
of Fig. 25.5) is typically very small, and the dopant distribution is constant. At
the same time, the carrier concentration in the active region is high enough to make
the diffusive part of the current density negligible. By way of example, one may
use a resistor fabricated within an epitaxial layer, or a MOSFET whose gate bias is
sufﬁciently high to produce a strong-inversion regime in the channel. Considering
that there are only two components of the current density and one component of the
magnetic induction, B D Bz, one applies directly (19.95) so that, for the valley of
index a, and assuming that the carriers are electrons, one ﬁnds

(25.33)
with J0

2a D q 2a na E2 due to the neglect of the diffusive
component.5 When adding up (25.33) over the valleys, the result depends on which,
between J1a and J2a, is aligned with the x axis. To avoid this complicacy one takes a
suitable average of 1a and 2a, indicated with H; letting  D H B one ﬁnds

In (25.34) it is Jx D P

in turn, the conductivity is given by the standard expression  D q n P

uniformity; in a MOSFET’s channel it is J0
3a D kB T 3a @na=@x3 C q 3a na E3 D 0 because the
drift and diffusion components balance each other. Also, in a MOSFET’s channel the components
of the current density parallel to the x; y plane depend also on z; however, one can neglect such a
dependence in (25.33) by considering J1a and J2a as averages over h [115].

Measuring the Semiconductor Parameters
Note that thanks to the approximation leading to (25.34) it is not necessary to
assume that B is small (compare with (19.98) and (19.99)).
The two-dimensional current ﬁeld (25.33) is expressible as J D rot. k/, where
k is the unit vector of the z axis and  a function of x; y only, which is sometimes
called stream function. The latter fulﬁlls the Laplace equation (Prob. 25.1),
r2 D 0 ;
(25.35)
supplemented with suitable boundary conditions (Prob. 25.2). Once the current
density is found, the components of the electric ﬁeld are determined from (25.33);
then, from E D  grad ', the voltage drop between any two points of the domain,
boundary included, is found from the negative path integral of E along any line
connecting the two points and belonging to the domain.
25.5.1
Solution of the Stream-Function Equation
The solution of (25.35) is sought over the domain D of Fig. 25.5, namely, the
rectangle H=2  x  H=2, L=2  y  L=2. The device has two contacts
connected with a current generator, whose current is I; they are placed at the two
ends y D ˙L=2 and have a common width H. The voltage measurements at the
Hall probes are performed using a zero-admittance equipment, hence no current is
absorbed there. However, the Hall probes may still affect the boundary condition
of (25.35), because the portion of the boundary onto which a probe is applied
becomes equipotential. Such an effect obviously disappears in the ideal case of
point-like probes, and may still be considered negligible if the common width s
of the probes is much smaller than L [8, 90]. As such a constraint is easily fulﬁlled
by the present technology, the effect of the probes’ size is neglected here. From
Prob. 25.2, the boundary conditions of (25.35) are found to be6

6With reference to Prob. 25.2, the second condition in (25.36) is derived by observing that along the
side y D L=2 the unit vector t is aligned with the side itself and points in the positive direction of
x. As a consequence, n points in the positive direction of y, namely, n D j and @ =@y D @ =@n.
By the same token, the sign in the second condition of (25.37) is justiﬁed by observing that the
currents at the contacts sum to zero, and by using the relation @ =@y D @ =@n that holds on the
side y D L=2 because n D j there. It is assumed that the current density is uniformly distributed
along the contact.

with  0 1 D I=h. As for the thickness h, it is sufﬁcient to assume that h is small, in
order to keep the validity of the two-dimensional analysis carried out here; as shown
in Prob. 25.4, the actual value h does not inﬂuence the measurement’s results. The
solution of (25.35) is a harmonic function, fulﬁlling (25.36) and (25.37), which may
be written as  D P C Q, with P D . 1   0/ x=H C . 1 C  0/=2; clearly, P is
harmonic and fulﬁlls the same Dirichlet conditions as  at x D ˙H=2, whereas it
fulﬁlls the homogeneous Neumann conditions at y D ˙L=2. As a consequence, Q
must be harmonic and fulﬁll the same Neumann conditions as  at y D ˙L=2, and
the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at x D ˙H=2:

Condition (25.38) suggests to seek for a function that is even with respect to x and

in fact, qn is harmonic and fulﬁlls by construction the homogeneous Dirichlet
condition at x D ˙H=2. On the contrary, it does not fulﬁll the nonhomogeneous
Neumann condition at y D ˙L=2; to achieve this result one forms a linear
combination Q D P1
nD0 n qn and suitably determine the coefﬁcients n. It is

and observing that the integral of cos.km x/ cos.kn x/ equals .H=2/ ımn, with ımn

that is, the voltage drop VH.y/ D '.H=2; y/  '.H=2; y/ between two points
facing each other on the insulating boundaries x D ˙H=2 (Fig. 25.5). To proceed,
one starts from the ﬁrst of (25.34) and combines  D P C Q with (25.40), (25.41),

The term @Q=@x does not contribute to the integral in (25.43) because Q fulﬁlls the

calculation one uses

The above result is to be compared with that obtained in Sect. 25.4, where the
standard Hall-voltage theory yielded VH D r B I=W; introducing into the latter
expression the second relation of (25.29), that applies to the case where the electron
current is dominant, shows that expression of the Hall voltage of the standard theory

The calculation of the depletion capacitance for an arbitrary doping proﬁle, in the

Measuring the Semiconductor Parameters
25.7
Van der Pauw Method
The theory of the Green function in two dimensions, outlined in Sect. 4.12.4, lends
itself to an interesting application to a technique for measuring the conductivity
and Hall coefﬁcient of a sample. The method, named after van der Pauw [139],
is outlined here with reference to the conductivity measurement. The sample to be
measured is approximately two dimensional (that is, its thickness is uniform and
much smaller that the length and width) and simply connected. Apart from these
constraints, its form is arbitrary. Four point-like contacts are placed at arbitrary
points along the sample’s periphery; two of them are connected with a current
generator, whereas the other two contacts are used to measure the voltage drop
produced by the current.
25.7.1
Solution over the Upper Half Plane
To begin with, one considers the case of a thin layer of material of uniform
conductivity , extending over the upper half plane; due to uniformity, the current
ﬂow is described by Ohm’s law J D  E, with E a two-dimensional ﬁeld. Charge
neutrality is supposed to hold, so that the electric potential ' is found by solving
the Laplace equation r2' D 0. As for the boundary conditions, it is assumed that a
current Iab is forced by a generator through two contacts lying along the x axis and
centered at x D a and x D b, respectively. The current enters the layer at the contact
centered at a and leaves it at the contact centered at b. The size s of both contacts is
provisionally left undetermined. Let J D k=s be the component of J normal to the x
axis at the contact centered at a, with k D const > 0. Letting h be the thickness of
the layer in the direction normal to the x; y plane, it is
Iab D h
Z aCs=2
as=2
J dx D h k > 0 ;
(25.50)
independent of the contact’s size. The normal component of the electric ﬁeld at
the contact centered at a turns out to be Ea D J= D =s, with  D k= D
Iab=.h / > 0, while that at the contact centered at b reads Eb D J= D =s. The
remaining parts of the x axis are electrically isolated. Thus, the normal component
of the current density and, consequently, that of the electric ﬁeld are zero there. Due
to the form of E it also follows
Z C1
1
E./ d D 0 :
(25.51)
The assumptions above prescribe the normal derivative of ' everywhere along the
x axis, and make it possible to determine ' in the upper half plane y > 0. It is

25.7
Van der Pauw Method
739
also possible to determine ' along the x axis away from the contacts. For this, with
no loss of generality one may assume a < b. Letting y D 0 in (4.67), one splits
the integral over the subintervals of the x axis; in so doing, one ﬁnds that only the
integrals extended over the contacts are different from zero. The other parts of the x
axis, in fact, do not contribute due to the vanishing normal component of E. Using
Ea D =s and Eb D =s yields

The above result holds away from the contacts, namely, for x ¤ a and x ¤ b.
Selecting two more points c > b and d > c and using  D Iab=.h /, the voltage

(25.55)
where all quantities in parentheses are positive. In (25.55) it is assumed that two
point-like contacts are placed at x D c, x D d, and the voltage difference Vdc
produced by Iab is measured. Observing that the positions a; b; c; d of the contacts
are prescribed, the only unknown left in (25.55) is the conductivity . Also,

generator or voltmeter are applied do not explicitly appear. In fact, the power of the
method lies in its ability to accurately measure the conductivity of the sample by
making the procedure independent of the positions of the contacts.
25.7.2
Solution over the Unit Circle
Another fundamental property of (25.59) is that it does not depend on the sample’s
geometry. Consider by way of example the conformal-mapping transformation
x; y ! u; v, shown in Sect. B.7, that brings the upper half plane y > 0 onto the
disk u2 C v2 < 1. As a consequence of the transformation, the solution of the
Laplace equation with Neumann boundary conditions, given by (4.67), transforms
into (B.65), (B.66), where the polar coordinates u D  cos #, v D  sin # are
used for convenience. The same boundary conditions used in the case of the upper
half plane will be studied here. In particular, in that problem the component of the
electric ﬁeld normal to the x axis at the contact of size s centered at a was Ea D =s.
Similarly, the normal component at the contact of the same size centered at b was
Eb D =s. The remaining part of the x axis was supposed to be electrically
isolated. When the variable transformations x; y ! u; v and u; v ! ; # are
carried out, the boundary is speciﬁed by letting y ! 0, u2 C v2 ! 1, and  ! 1,
respectively; as a consequence, the ﬁrst integral in (25.52) transforms as

identical to (25.59). In other terms, despite the fact that the expressions appearing
in the intermediate steps, leading either to (25.59) or (25.68), are different, the ﬁnal
expression is the same. New forms of the domain obtained by other conformal-
mapping transformations would still lead to the same result. In conclusion, the
relation connecting the sample’s conductivity with the measurement results is
independent not only of the contacts’ positions, but also of the form of the sample
itself. The latter can then be chosen in such a way as to minimize the experimental
errors.

from (A.5) one also derives the inequalities a b  <.ab/  Ca b. Thanks to this,

where x1; : : : ; xn are the coordinates of an n-dimensional Cartesian reference. The

manner as the product of a vector and a scalar quantity introduced above: rf is a
vector of components .r/if, namely,

The product deﬁned by (A.12) is also called gradient of f, whereas the scalar

Dyadic Products
Sometimes it is convenient to adopt a notation that uses the basis set of real, mutually
orthogonal unit vectors i1; : : : ; in associated with the axes of a Cartesian reference.
By construction it is ir  is D ırs, where the Kronecker symbol ırs is the entry of
indices rs of a second-rank matrix deﬁned as
ırs D
 1
s D r
0
s ¤ r
(A.18)
The expression of vector a in terms of the basis vectors is a D a1 i1 C : : : C an in.
The notation applies also to the higher-rank objects; for instance, in this notation the
matrix A of (A.8) reads
A D A11 i1 iT
1 C A12 i1 iT
2 C : : : C An;n1 in iT
n1 C Ann in iT
n ;
(A.19)
A group like ir iT
s is also called dyadic product. Observing that ir is an n-dimensional
column vector whose rth entry is equal to 1 while all the other entries are equal to 0,
the application of the third equation in (A.9) shows that ir iT
s is an n  n matrix
whose entry of indices rs is equal to 1, while all the other entries are equal to
zero. As a consequence, the form (A.19) expresses A as a sum of matrices, each
associated with an individual entry. Using this notation, a product like A b reads
P
rs Ars ir iT
s
P
k bk ik. On the other hand, due to the second equation in (A.9), the
same product is equal to P
rs Ars bs ir. This shows that ir iT
s ik D ir ısk, that is, the
juxtaposition of the right unit vector of the dyadic product with the next unit vector
must be treated as a scalar product.
The relation deﬁned by the second equation in (A.9) applies also when b is
replaced with a vector operator, with the provision that the operator is meant to act
towards the left. For instance, replacing b with r yields .A r/i D Pn
jD1 @Aij=@xj.
It follows that the divergence of a second-rank matrix is a column vector of
the form
div A D

In turn, considering the product deﬁned by the third equation in (A.9) and replacing
b with r, still with the provision that the operator acts towards the left, yield
.a rT/ij D @ai=@xj. It follows that the gradient of a column vector is a second-rank
matrix of the form

Vector Product
Another possible product between two vectors is the vector product a ^ b, which
yields a column vector. In contrast with the other products introduced in this section,
the deﬁnition of the vector product will be limited to the three-dimensional case; it
is given as the expansion of a determinant, namely,

From (A.27) it follows b ^ a D a ^ b and a ^ a D 0. The latter also shows
that if two nonvanishing vectors are parallel to each other, say, b D k a ¤ 0, then
a ^ b D 0. When the vector product involves the unit vectors associated with the
axes of a right-handed Cartesian reference, the following relations are found:
i1 ^ i2 D i3 ;
i2 ^ i3 D i1 ;
i3 ^ i1 D i2 :

Mixed Product

to yield a scalar quantity called mixed product. For the sake of simplicity, in the
deﬁnition of the mixed product the three vectors will be considered real. From (A.2)

The two determinants in (A.31) are equal because they transform into each other by
interchanging rows an even number of times. On the other hand, from their equality
it follows a^bc D ab^c, namely, the mixed product is invariant upon interchange
of the “wedge” and “dot” symbols.
Considering three nonvanishing vectors a, b, c, where a and b are not parallel
to each other, and remembering the properties of determinants, one ﬁnds that the
mixed product vanishes if c is parallel to a or parallel to b. In fact,
a ^ b  a D a ^ b  b D 0 :
(A.32)
It follows that the vector product a ^ b is normal to both a and b, namely, is normal
to the plane deﬁned by the two nonparallel vectors a and b. If one associates the
plane of a and b with that of the unit vectors i1 and i2, then, using (A.28), the vector
product simpliﬁes to a ^ b D .a1 b2  a2 a1/ i3, that provides the information about
the direction of a ^ b. Finally, using (A.27) twice provides the expression for the
double vector product

.a ^ b/ ^ c D a  c b  b  c a :

is also called rotational of a, the corresponding symbol being r ^ b D rot a.
Combining (A.34) with the three-dimensional case of (A.12) and (A.13) shows that
the following identities hold:
rot.f a/ D f rot a C grad f ^ a ;
rot grad f D 0 ;
div rot a D 0 ;

Helmholtz Theorem
A vector u such that rot u D 0 is called irrotational. From the second identity
in (A.35) one ﬁnds that if u D grad f, then u is irrotational. The inverse is not true
in general; however, if the domain of u is simply connected, the condition rot u D 0
implies that u can be expressed as a gradient: u D grad f.

A vector v such that div v D 0 is called solenoidal. From the third identity
in (A.35) one ﬁnds that if v D rot a, then v is solenoidal. The inverse is not true
in general; however, if the domain of v is simply connected, the condition div v D 0
implies that v can be expressed as a rotational: v D rot a.
The Helmholtz theorem states that a vector w deﬁned in a simply connected
domain can be expressed in a unique manner as the sum of an irrotational and a
solenoidal vector:
w D grad f C rot a :
(A.40)
Scalar f is found by taking the divergence of both sides of (A.40) and using the
identities div grad f D r2f, div rot a D 0. In turn, vector a is found by taking the
rotational of both sides of (A.40) and using the ﬁrst identity in (A.36) along with
the auxiliary condition div a D 0. By this procedure it is found that f and a fulﬁll
the relations
r2f D div w ;
r2a D  rot w :
(A.41)
The right-hand sides of (A.41) are known because w is prescribed. As a conse-
quence, the problem of ﬁnding f and a is equivalent to solving a set of Poisson
equations. The solution of (A.41) is unique provided that w vanishes at inﬁnity
faster than r1 [82, Sect. XI.3]. Unless some additional prescriptions are imposed
on f and a, (A.40) still holds if one adds to f an arbitrary constant and, to a, the
gradient of an arbitrary scalar function.
A.11
Matrices
The following deﬁnitions and properties2 apply to a real square matrix A of order
N, whose entries are indicated with aij D .A/ij. It is known that the determinant of
a matrix changes its sign when two rows or columns are exchanged. It follows that
if the matrix is non-singular, det A ¤ 0, the matrix obtained by a sequence of such
exchanges is still non-singular.
In the numerical solution of the differential equations that model a semicon-
ductor device it is necessary to repeatedly solve an algebraic system of the form
A x D b, with A a non-singular, real square matrix of order N. This section
illustrates a number of matrix properties that are useful for the problem under
consideration; the application to the semiconductor-device equations is illustrated
in Sect. A.13.
It is important to distinguish the solution of the algebraic system, which amounts
to ﬁnding x given the data b, from the inversion of A, which amounts to ﬁnding
B D A1. The second operation lends itself to solving the system as well: in fact,
2Several deﬁnitions and properties illustrated in this section have an analogue in the theory of
operators. An illustration of the latter is given in Sects. 8.3, 8.4, and 8.6.

x D A1 b D B b; however, it is much more expensive than the ﬁrst one.3 To show
this, let b D ik, where ik is a vector whose kth entry is equal to unity, while all other
entries vanish; observing that the jth entry of ik is equal to the Kronecker symbol
ıjk (A.18), the entries of x D B ik are

(A.42)
Thus, the solution vector x is the kth column of B D A1; the whole inverse matrix
B is found by repeating the solution process with k D 1; 2; : : : ; N. In conclusion, if
C.N/ is the computational cost of solving the N N algebraic system A x D b, then
the cost of inverting A is N C.N/.
The main diagonal of a square matrix of order N is the set of entries a11; : : : ; aNN.
A real, square matrix of entries aij is symmetric when aji D aij; thus, a symmetric
matrix is deﬁned by prescribing the N diagonal elements and the .N2  N/=2
elements on one side of the diagonal. A real, square matrix is anti-symmetric or
skew-symmetric when aji D aij; thus, the diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric
matrix vanish, and the matrix is deﬁned by giving the .N2  N/=2 elements on one
side of the diagonal.
A diagonal matrix is a square matrix in which all entries that do not belong to
the main diagonal are equal to zero.
The transpose AT of a square matrix A of order N is the matrix of entries .AT/ij D
.A/ji; thus, a real, symmetric matrix is equal to its transpose, AT D A. A non-
singular, square matrix A is orthogonal if AT D A1; for an orthogonal matrix it
then follows A AT D AT A D I, whence the scalar product of each column by itself
is equal to unity, a2
r1C  Ca2
rN D 1, while the scalar product of a column by another
column is equal to zero, ar1 as1 C    C arN asN D 0; the same property applies to
rows. If A is orthogonal, the norm of vector d D A c is equal to that of vector c; the
demonstration is the same as for the unitary matrix, given by (A.43).
A real square matrix A is real normal if it commutes with its transpose,

The above deﬁnitions are extended to the case of a complex square matrix A of

Matrix A is skew-Hermitean if .A/ji D .A/
ij; thus, a skew-Hermitean matrix is
equal to the negative of its conjugate transpose, A D A. From the deﬁnition
it follows that in a skew-Hermitean matrix the entries of the main diagonal are
imaginary.
A complex square matrix A is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose,
A A D A A. Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, and unitary matrices are normal. Instead,
a unitary matrix is not necessarily Hermitean: for this to hold it must simultaneously
be A D A1 and A D A, whence A must fulﬁll the constraint A2 D I.
A.11.1
Eigenvalues
Given an N  N non-singular matrix V, consider the algebraic system
V e D  e ;
(A.44)
with  an undetermined parameter. If  exists, such as (A.44) has a nontrivial
solution, then  is an eigenvalue of V and the nontrivial solution thus found is the
eigenvector corresponding to . For the existence of nontrivial solutions of (A.44)
it is necessary that
det.V  I/ D 0 :
(A.45)
The above is an algebraic equation of degree N, called characteristic equation
or also secular equation, which has N solutions 1; : : : ; N; such solutions are
not necessarily distinct from each other, and are generally complex. Successively
inserting 1; 2; : : : into (A.44) yields the eigenvectors e1; e2; : : :, that are the only
nontrivial solutions of (A.44).
The eigenvalues of a non-singular matrix are different from zero; in fact, if it
were m D 0, then it would be V em D 0; however, the latter equation can have a
nontrivial solution only if V were singular, contrary to the hypothesis. The converse
is also true: if V is singular, then there exists a nonvanishing vector em that makes
the left-hand side of (A.44) equal to zero; this is compatible with (A.44) only if the
corresponding eigenvalue is equal to zero.

A
Vector and Matrix Analysis
From the homogeneity of (A.44) it follows that the eigenvectors are determined
apart from a multiplicative constant. For each eigenvector er, the constant can then
be chosen such that the vector is normalized to unity: jerj D 1. Another important
property is that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are different
(that is, nonparallel) from each other. Let the eigenvalues be r and s ¤ r, and
let er be an eigenvector corresponding to r, and es an eigenvector corresponding
to s. Specifying (A.44) for index r and index s, and subtracting from each other
the two relations thus found, yields V .er  es/ D r er  s es. If it were es D er
it would follow .r  s/ er D 0; however, the latter relation is impossible because
er, being an eigenvector, does not vanish, and the two eigenvalues are different by
hypothesis. As a corollary, it follows that an eigenvector belongs to one and only
one eigenvalue.
The spectral radius of a matrix is the maximum modulus of its eigenvalues, % D
maxi.jij/. There are several theorems providing upper bounds for % [94, Chap.
III]; among these, the Gershgorin theorem states that
jj  min.R; C/ ;
(A.46)
where the two real parameters R; C depend on the entries of V as shown below. To
demonstrate (A.46) one starts from (A.44) and let  be an eigenvalue of V, with e
an eigenvector corresponding to it. Take the entry of e whose modulus is maximum,
say, ei, and consider the ith row of (A.44), PN
jD1 Vij ej D  ei. Using the arbitrary
multiplicative constant of the eigenvalues, normalize e so that ei D 1; it follows

(A.47)
This shows that the eigenvalue under consideration belongs to the disc of the
complex plane centered in the origin and having Ri as radius. On the other hand, as
the reasoning leading to (A.47) can be repeated for any eigenvalue, one concludes
that the maximum of such discs contains all eigenvalues of V, namely, jj 
R D maxi.Ri/. Repeating the procedure starting from the transpose of (A.44)
yields jj  C D maxi.Ci/ with Ci D PN
jD1 jVjij, namely, the moduli of the
entries are added columnwise; since both constraints jj  R and jj  C hold
simultaneously, (A.46) ensues.
Linear Independence of the Eigenvectors
From the properties demonstrated in Sect. A.11.1 it follows that two eigenvectors er,
es belonging to different eigenvalues are linearly independent. If the opposite were
true, there would exist two nonvanishing constants r, s such that r er C ses D
0; this, however, is impossible because the two eigenvectors would be parallel to

each other. More generally, it is found that the eigenvectors of V belonging to m >
2 distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. For this, assume that (A.45) has
m distinct roots, with 2 < m  N, and number such roots with indices ranging
from 1 to m, so that the corresponding eigenvectors are e1; : : : ; em. Now, if these
eigenvectors were linearly dependent, there would exist m constants 1; : : : ; m such
that
1e1 C : : : C mem D 0 ;
(A.48)
with at least two of the constants different from zero. Multiplying (A.48) by V and
using (A.44) provides
1 1 e1 C : : : C m m em D 0 :
(A.49)
Now, for any index k such that 1  k  m, multiplying (A.48) by k and subtracting
the result from (A.49) yield
m
X
jD1
j .k  j/ ej D 0
(A.50)
where, apart from the summand with j D k, the differences in parentheses are
different from zero because the eigenvalues are distinct; from (A.50) it then follows
that the m  1 eigenvectors e1, : : :, ek1, ekC1, : : :, em are linearly dependent. On the
other hand, this reasoning can be repeated for all values of k between 1 and m; as a
consequence, if (A.48) were true, then all sets made of m  1 eigenvalues extracted
from e1; : : : ; em would fulﬁll relations similar to (A.48). Starting from this result
one may repeat the reasoning to show that linear independence would be absent for
all sets made of m  2; m  3; : : : eigenvectors, to ﬁnally reach all sets made of two
eigenvectors. This, however, is absurd as shown above; in conclusion, (A.48) holds
only if all constants 1, : : :, m vanish, thus showing that eigenvectors belonging to
distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.4
If it is m D N, matrix V has N distinct eigenvalues, each of them associated
with a different eigenvector. If, instead, it is m < N, thus implying that (A.45)
has multiple eigenvalues, the above reasoning is not applicable to the indices larger
than m; in fact, if one included in (A.50) also the summands relative to mC1, mC2,
: : :, the parentheses containing repeated eigenvalues would vanish, and the left-hand
side of (A.50) would still be made of m  1 summands.
4Note that the conclusion is reached without assuming any special property of the matrix, apart
from that of being non-singular.

Orthogonalization of a Set of Vectors
It is shown here that from a set of N linearly independent vectors p1; p2; : : : ; pN it
is possible to extract a set of N mutually orthogonal vectors w1; w2; : : : ; wN. The
procedure, called Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, forms linear combinations of
the pr vectors according to the scheme

w2 D p2Cd21 w1 ;
w3 D p3Cd31 w1Cd32 w2 ;

or, more generally, wr D pr C Pr1
kD1 drk wk, where coefﬁcients drk are provisionally
left undetermined. Left multiplying by w
1 the second relation in (A.51), and
prescribing that w2 and w1 are orthogonal, yields d21 jw1j2 D w
1  p2. The left-
hand side of the latter cannot vanish: if it did, it would also be p1 D w1 D 0
and, in this case, vectors pr would not be linearly independent. Thus, extracting
d21 D w
1  p2=jw1j2 and replacing it in the second relation in (A.51), provides
w2 as a linear combination of p1 and p2; therefore, w2 does not vanish. Then, one
proceeds by left multiplying the third relation in (A.51) by either w
1 or w
2, and
prescribing that w3 be orthogonal to w1 in the ﬁrst case, and to w2 in the second
case. Remembering that w1 and w2 are orthogonal, one ﬁnds d31 jw1j2 D w
1  p3
and d32 jw2j2 D w
2  p3, where the vectors at the left-hand side are different from
zero. Thus, one extracts the coefﬁcients d31 and d32, determines w3, and so on. In
conclusion, the general expression for the coefﬁcients reads drk jwkj2 D w

A.11.2
Properties of Hermitean Matrices
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitean matrices have a number of proper-
ties that are worth illustrating. To begin one ﬁnds that if V is Hermitean, the scalar
product a  V a is real for any choice of vector a; in fact, the product a  V a reads

(A.52)
where the second form is obtained from the ﬁrst one by exchanging the indices.
From (A.52) it follows that the sum is equal to its conjugate, namely, it is real. A
consequence of this ﬁnding is that the eigenvalues of a Hermitean matrices are real;
to show this, let er be an eigenvector of V and r the corresponding eigenvalue.
A scalar multiplication on the left by e
r of the eigenvalue equation (A.44) yields
e?
r  V er D r e?
r  er, where the left-hand side is real as demonstrated with (A.52).

is real. It may happen that the real product a  V a is strictly positive (negative) for
any choice of vector a; in this case, A is called positive deﬁnite (negative deﬁnite).
From (A.53) it then follows that the eigenvalues of a positive-deﬁnite Hermitean
matrix are all positive; thus, as shown in Sect. A.11.1, such a matrix is non-singular.
Other relations are derived by considering eigenvectors with different indices,
e.g., er and es: left multiplying V er D r er by e?
s , right multiplying the conjugate
of V es D s es by er, and subtracting the relations thus obtained, one ﬁnds that the
left-hand sides delete each other due to the hermiticity of V. In conclusion,
.r  s/ e?
s  er D 0 :
(A.54)
If all roots of the characteristic equation (A.45) are distinct, the term in parentheses
in (A.54) is different from zero for any pair of indices r, s; it follows that all eigen-
vectors are mutually orthogonal. Remembering (Sect. A.11.1) that the eigenvectors
are deﬁned apart from a multiplicative constant, hence they are normalizable to
unity, for a Hermitean matrix with distinct eigenvalues one can always assume
e?
s  er D ısr ;
(A.55)
with ısr the Kronecker symbol (A.18). Eigenvalues that fulﬁll (A.55) are called
orthonormal.5
If the characteristic equation (A.45) has multiple roots, there are pairs of indices
such that the difference in parentheses of (A.54) vanishes; for this reason, the
analysis cannot be based upon (A.54). However, as shown in Sect. A.11.1, there
always exist N mutually independent eigenvectors; also, for Hermitean matrices it
is always possible to ﬁnd a set of N mutually orthonormal eigenvectors, regardless
of the multiplicity of the eigenvalues (section “Diagonalization of Hermitean
Matrices—Multiple Eigenvalues”). Finally, if V is real and symmetric the eigen-
value equation (A.44) is an algebraic system with real coefﬁcients; it is then possible
to select the normalization constants in a way that makes all eigenvectors real.
5Condition (A.55) provides a simpler demonstration, with respect to the general one shown in
Sect. A.11.1, of the linear independence of the eigenvectors. If the eigenvectors were linearly
dependent there would be N constants 1; : : : ; N, not all vanishing, such that the relation
PN
rD1 r er D 0 holds. Assuming for instance that s ¤ 0, left multiplying the above relation
by e?

of the sth one, thus yielding the absurd conclusion jesj2 D 0.

Diagonalization of Hermitean Matrices
Let V be an NN Hermitean matrix, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are r and
er, respectively. Assume that all eigenvalues are distinct; it follows (section “Linear
Independence of the Eigenvectors”) that the eigenvectors are mutually independent;
also, one can assume (section “Orthogonalization of a Set of Vectors”) that the
eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and normalized to unity. With these premises,
let G be an N  N matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of V, namely, the
entry of indices k r of G is the kth entry of er. From the linear independence of the
eigenvectors it follows that G is non-singular, whence its inverse G1 exists. Left
multiplying G by its conjugate transpose G, one ﬁnds that the entry of indices s r
of the product is PN
kD1.G/sk Gkr D PN
kD1 G?
ks Gkr D e?
s  er. Remembering that the
set of eigenvectors is orthonormal, one ﬁnds from (A.55) that GG D I, namely,
from the deﬁnition of Sect. A.11, G is unitary.
Now, let D be a diagonal matrix of order N, whose diagonal entries are the
eigenvalues r, namely, Dkr D r ıkr. From the above deﬁnitions, the N algebraic
systems V er D r er are recast in matrix form as V G D G D. Left multiplying the
latter by G1 yields
G1 V G D D:
(A.56)
This result shows that the matrix made of the eigenvectors produces a similarity
transformation (Sect. A.11.3) that brings the Hermitean matrix V into the matrix
made of its eigenvalues. This type of similarity transformation is called diagonal-
ization, because it yields a diagonal matrix, or also unitary transformation, because
it is based upon a unitary matrix. An example of application to the diagonalization
of a Hamiltonian function is shown in Sect. 3.10.
Diagonalization of Hermitean Matrices—Multiple Eigenvalues
This section examines the case of a Hermitean matrix whose characteristic equa-
tion (A.45) ha multiple roots. One starts by considering a unitary matrix W, not
necessarily made of the eigenvectors of V. As shown in Sect. A.11, a unitary matrix
is not Hermitean in general; instead, for any matrix W the property holds that if V
is Hermitean, then W V W is also Hermitean; in fact,

where the right-hand sides are equal because V is Hermitean. Also, the product of

Now, let .N/

be an eigenvalue of (A.44), with e1 an eigenvector corresponding to it,
normalized to unity. In the N-dimensional space it is always possible to ﬁnd other
N  1 vectors, linearly independent with respect to e1 and to each other; then, using
the orthogonalization procedure of section “Orthogonalization of a Set of Vectors,”
one extracts N  1 vectors w2; : : : ; wN, also normalized to unity, that are orthogonal
to e1 and with respect to each other. Let WN be the unitary matrix having e1 as

relation similar to (A.62) whose right-hand side is a diagonal matrix D; the elements
of the latter are eigenvalues of Hermitean matrices, hence they are real. In turn, at
the left-hand side one ﬁnds that matrix V is right multiplied by the unitary matrix
G D UN UN1 : : : U2 U1 and left multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the above.
One then ﬁnds that the procedure eventually leads to (A.56); in other terms, one can

of D with the eigenvalues of V, and the

resorting to the hypothesis that the eigenvalues are simple, it has been demonstrated
that a Hermitean matrix can be diagonalized with a unitary transformation; this, in
turn, provides a set of N orthonormal eigenvectors. As shown in Sect. A.11.2, if
matrix V is real and symmetric it is possible to choose the normalization constants
such that the eigenvectors are real.
Eigenvalues of Other Special Matrices
Let A be a complex square matrix. If A is normal, and er is an eigenvector of A
corresponding to eigenvalue r, then er is also an eigenvector of A, corresponding
to eigenvalue 
r . To show this one deﬁnes B D A   I so that the eigenvalue
equation (A.44) takes the form B e D 0. Matrix B is normal by construction, and
B D A   I. From jB ej2 D .B e/ .B e/ D 0 one ﬁnds
.B e/ .B e/ D e B B e D e B B e D jB ej2 D 0 :
(A.64)
The above is equivalent to B e D 0, namely, to A e D  e as anticipated.
Other properties refer to the eigenvalues of skew-Hermitian matrices and of
unitary matrices. The nonvanishing eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix A D
A are imaginary; to show this, one left multiplies by e the eigenvalue equation
A e D  e, to ﬁnd
 jej2 D e A e D e A e D  .A e/ e D  . e/ e D  jej2 ;
(A.65)
with jej2 ¤ 0. It follows  D , namely,  is either equal to zero or to an
imaginary number.

If A is unitary, A A D I, the modulus of its eigenvalues is equal to unity. To
show this, one left multiplies by A the eigenvalue equation A e D  e and exploits
the property of normal matrices demonstrated with (A.64), to ﬁnd
e D  A e D   e ;
(A.66)
with e ¤ 0. It follows jj2 D 1.
Permutation Matrices
A given set of row and column exchanges to which A may be subjected is
conveniently described by means of a permutation matrix P of order N; in each
row and in each column of a permutation matrix there is one and only one entry
equal to 1, while all the remaining entries are equal to 0; for instance, a possible
permutation matrix of order 3 is
P D
2
4
0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 1
3
5 :
(A.67)
If A is a 3  3 matrix, then A P, with P given by (A.67), is the 3  3 matrix obtained
by exchanging the ﬁrst two columns of A, while P A is the 3  3 matrix obtained
by exchanging the ﬁrst two rows of A. It is easily found that jdet Pj D 1 for all
permutation matrices; it follows that permutation matrices are non-singular.
A.11.3
Similarity Transformations
Let V be a square matrix of order N, and let G be a non-singular square matrix, still
of order N. Using the above, one constructs a third matrix G1 V G. This operation,
that applies to both real and complex matrices, is called similarity transformation;
the two matrices V and G1 V G are called similar. If two matrices are similar, they
have the same determinant and the same eigenvalues. The ﬁrst property is due to the
fact that the determinant of a product is equal to the product of determinants,
det.G1 V G/ D det.G1/ det.V/ det.G/ D det.G1G/ det.V/ D det.V/ ;
(A.68)
The second property derives from the eigenvalue equation for V. Letting r be an
eigenvalue and I the identity matrix, consider the matrix
G1 V G  r I D G1 V G  r G1 I G D G1 .V  r I/ G ;
(A.69)
where I D G1 G D G1 I G has been used. From (A.68) it follows det.G1 V G 
r I/ D det.V  r I/. By deﬁnition, r makes the right-hand side of the above to

764

Vector and Matrix Analysis
vanish for all r; it follows that V and G1 V G have the same eigenvalues. From
the identity V e D V G G1 e, which holds for any vector e of length N, it follows
for the rth eigenvalue G1 V G G1 er D r G1 er; as a consequence, G1 er is an
eigenvector of G1 V G for all r.
A.11.4
Doubly Stochastic Matrices

nonnegative numbers k such that 1 C : : : C M D 1. The matrix

mutation matrices [11].

A square matrix A of order N is called reducible if a permutation matrix P exists
such that
P A P1 D
 F O
H G

;
(A.74)
where F, G are square matrices, O is a matrix whose entries are equal to zero, and
P1 is the inverse of P. If no permutation matrix exists that makes (A.74) to hold,
then A is irreducible. If A is reducible, let Na be the order of F and Nb D N  Na
that of G; then, assume that an algebraic system A u D b is to be solved, with u, b
the unknown and data vectors, respectively. Left multiplying the system by P, and
observing that P1 P D I, with I the identity matrix, yields P A P1 P u D P b.
Deﬁning the vectors w D P u and g D P b, let wa and ga be the vectors made of the
ﬁrst Na entries of w and g, respectively, and let wb and gb be the vectors made of the
remaining Nb entries. The algebraic system to be solved then becomes
F wa D ga ;
H wa C G wb D gb :
(A.75)
If A is non-singular, P AP1 is non-singular as well,8 whence w is unique. It follows
that the solution of the ﬁrst equation in (A.75), whose unknown vector is made of
the ﬁrst Na entries of w, is also unique; as a consequence, F is non-singular. Solving
for wa the ﬁrst equation in (A.75), and replacing the result in the second one, yields
an algebraic system in the unknown vector wb. By the same token one ﬁnds that G
is also non-singular, whence wb is found. Thus, the solution of the original algebraic
system A u D b of order N has been reduced to that of two systems of lower order.
The irreducibility property is amenable to an interesting graphic representation:
given an N  N matrix, with N > 1, choose N different points of the plane and
arbitrarily number them from 1 to N; then, for each nonvanishing entry aij of the
matrix, j ¤ i, draw an arc oriented from the ith to the jth point.9 The construction
yields an oriented graph; the latter is called connected if, for any choice of two
different points i, j, one or both of the following occur: A) there exists an arc that
connects points i and j; B) there exists an oriented path, made of more than one arc,
8If A, B are two square matrices of order N, it is det.A B/ D .det A/ .det B/. From P P1 D I it
follows ˙1  det.P1/ D 1, namely, det P D det.P1/; thus, det.P AP1/ D det A.
9The diagonal entries aii are of no interest in this construction; for the sake of completeness one
might draw a closed arc at each point i for which aii ¤ 0.

that connects point i to point ˛, point ˛ to ˇ, : : :, point  to j. It can be shown that
if the oriented graph of A is connected, then A is irreducible, and vice versa [147,
Par. 2.5].
A.11.6
Properties of Diagonally Dominant Matrices
Still considering a real square matrix A of order N, and basing upon the deﬁnitions
given in Sect. A.11.5, the following theorems are now proven:
1. If the main diagonal of A is strongly dominant, then A is non-singular.
2. If A is irreducible and its main diagonal is weakly dominant, then A is non-
singular and all entries aii of the main diagonal are different from zero.
The demonstration of the ﬁrst theorem starts from (A.72), which shows that aii ¤ 0,
i D 1 ; : : : ; N; next, consider the auxiliary, homogeneous system A v D 0, whose
ith row reads aii vi C P
j¤i aij vj D 0. Letting bij D 0 for j D i and bij D aij=aii for
j ¤ i transforms the latter into

This inequality is false because, due to the deﬁnition of M, the quantity in

the only possible solution of the homogeneous system A v D 0 is the trivial one,
whence A is non-singular.
The demonstration of the second theorem starts from the trivial case N D 1;
it must be ja11j > 0 due to the deﬁnition of weakly dominant diagonal, whence

the theorem for the trivial case is proven. Consider now the nontrivial case N >
1 and assume that aii D 0 for some index i; from (A.73) it follows aij D 0 for
all j, namely, all entries of the i row vanish. By suitable permutations it is then
possible to transform this row into the ﬁrst one; comparing with (A.74) shows that
A is reducible, contrary to the hypothesis. The rest of the proof follows the same
reasoning as for the ﬁrst theorem: the condition that the main diagonal is weakly
dominant prescribes that the strict inequality PN

index i, whereas for all indices i for which the strict inequality does not hold it is

where M and k have the same meaning as in the ﬁrst theorem. Due to the deﬁnition
of M, the quantity in parentheses in (A.80) is non-positive for all indices; it follows
that jvjj D M for all values of j such that bkj ¤ 0. On the other hand, A is
irreducible, whence (remembering the construction of the oriented graph illustrated
above) for any pair j ¤ k it is bkj ¤ 0, or there exist indices ˛ ; ˇ ; : : : ; 
such that bi˛ b˛ˇ : : : bj ¤ 0. Due to (A.80), this is equivalent to jvjj D M or
jv˛j D jvˇj D : : : D jvjj D M, both of which imply jvjj D M for all j ¤ k.

It is assumed that all terms wi, ri, zi are different from zero, so that the matrix
is irreducible (Sect. A.11.5), and also that the main diagonal is dominant, namely,
jr1j > jz1j, jrNj > jzNj, and jrij > jzij C jwij for i D 2; : : : ; N  1. It follows that
matrix A is non-singular (Sect. A.11.6).
L U Decomposition
One of the possible methods for solving an algebraic system (not necessarily
tridiagonal) is the so-called A
D
L U decomposition, where L is a lower-
triangular matrix and U an upper-triangular matrix.10 For a matrix not having a
special structure, the decomposition is in general expensive from the computational
viewpoint; however, for a tridiagonal matrix it is simple, and the form of L and U
turns out to be:

It follows that the decomposition requires only to determine the entries i and gi.
The determinant of L is equal to unity, that of U is equal to g1 : : : gN. It can be shown
that U also is non-singular; as a consequence the diagonal entries gi are nonzero.11
The relations between the entries of A and those of L and U are found
from (A.83), (A.84) by performing the matrix multiplication. Considering the ﬁrst
row of A one ﬁnds r1 D g1; the relations for the other rows are ri D i zi1 C gi and
wi D i gi1, with i D 2; : : : ; N. Next, replacing A with L U in the original system
A x D b, one splits the latter into two subsystems:
L e D b ;
U x D e :
(A.85)
The ﬁrst of (A.85) is equivalent to e1 D b1 and i ei1 C ei D bi, with i D 2; : : : ; N,
that is, to a sequence of steps that provides the entries ei by forward substitution,
while the second of (A.85) is equivalent to gN xN D eN and gi xi C zi xiC1 D ei,
with i D N  1; : : : ; 1, that is, to a sequence of steps that provides the entries xi by
backward substitution. In the algorithm used to solve (A.85) it is not necessary to
store the vector of entries i: unless such a vector is necessary for other purposes,
one can use a single scalar . Proceeding in this way one ﬁnds g1 D r1 and e1 D b1;

The divisions by wi or gi in (A.86), (A.87) are possible because it is wi ¤ 0 and
gi ¤ 0 as shown above. The method requires the storage of two vectors, g and e,
besides those necessary for the storage of A and b. The computational cost of the
solution of A x D b is found from (A.86), (A.87), and turns out to be 6 .N  1/
multiplications and 3 .N  1/ additions.12
A Cheaper Solution Scheme
The tridiagonal structure lends itself to another solution methods, that has some
advantages over the L U decomposition. The method is outlined here, with reference

(A.92)
the ﬁrst of which is obviously a replica of the ﬁrst relation in (A.89). Again, if
relations like (A.91) and (A.92) are added up, the terms pi cumulate while the

QNC1  const > 0 by construction. In this way, all terms at the right-hand side
of (A.99) are deﬁned; as a consequence, (A.99) provides the solution sought. The
method requires the storage of two vectors, Q D .Q1; Q2; : : :/ and Y D .Y1; Y2; : : :/,
while no vector is necessary to store P D .P1; P2; : : :/. The computational cost is
3 .N 1/ multiplications and 6 .N 1/ additions, to be compared with the 6 .N 1/
multiplications and 3 .N1/ additions of the L U decomposition. Another advantage
of the method illustrated in this section is that each nodal value (A.95) or (A.99)
can be calculated independently from the others; in contrast, to calculate the ith
unknown with the backward substitution (A.87) it is necessary to calculate ﬁrst all
the other unknowns whose index is larger than i.
A.12
Wronskian Determinant
The Wronskian determinant provides the condition of linear independence of
functions [66, Sect. 5.2]. Although its properties hold for any number of functions,
they will be discussed here for the case of two functions only, say, u and v deﬁned on
some interval of the independent variable x. It is convenient to seek for the condition
of linear dependence ﬁrst. If u, v are linearly dependent, then two nonvanishing
constants c1, c2 exist such that
c1 u C c2 v D 0
(A.100)
for all x in the interval. If (A.100) holds, it is easily found that both c1 and c2 must
differ from zero. Also, as the function at the left-hand side of (A.100) vanishes
www.ebook3000.com

A
Vector and Matrix Analysis
773
identically, its derivative vanishes as well. Such a derivative exists because u and v
are supposed to be solutions of a second-order differential equation. Then,
c1 u0 C c2 v0 D 0
(A.101)
for all x in the interval. As (A.100, A.101) hold together, for all x the two constants
c1, c2 are the nontrivial solution of a homogeneous algebraic system. Now, if the
nontrivial solution of the algebraic system exists for all x, the determinant W D
u v0  u0 v must vanish identically. That is, the condition W D 0 (identically) is
necessary for the linear dependence of u, v. As a consequence, the condition W ¤ 0
(identically) is sufﬁcient for the linear independence of u, v.
A.13
Numerical Solution of the Semiconductor Equations
As mentioned in Sect. 22.11.7, several steps in the design of integrated circuits
are carried out by computer simulation. In many cases, this entails the solution of
differential equations; as the form of the latter is seldom amenable to an analytic
solution, one must resort to numerical methods. In this section, a brief account is
given of methods useful for solving the drift-diffusion model in a semiconductor
region, in the form worked out in Sect. 19.5.5; the equations read
div D D q .p  n C N/ ;
D D "sc grad ' D "sc E ;
(A.102)
@n
@t  1
q div Jn D Wn ;
Jn D q n n E C q Dn grad n ;
(A.103)
@p
@t C 1
q div Jp D Wp ;
Jp D q p p E  q Dp grad p :
(A.104)
Apart from the constants q, "sc, the model’s coefﬁcients are the mobilities n,
p and the diffusion coefﬁcients Dn, Dp; the latter are proportional to the
corresponding mobilities through the Einstein relations (19.102). The data are
the dopant distribution N and the generation-recombination rates Wn, Wp. The
model (A.102), (A.103), (A.104) can be viewed as a set of six equations of the ﬁrst
order with respect to the spatial variables; alternatively, inserting the expression of
D, Jn, or Jp, appearing on the right, into the divergence operator belonging to the
same line, yields a set of three equations of the second order. The latter form is the
most common one for the application of numerical methods, because only three
scalar unknowns appear in it (', n, and p). The equations must be supplemented
with suitable boundary conditions. In dynamic conditions, the equations are also of
the ﬁrst order with respect to time, and the initial condition must be supplemented
as well.

A suitable deﬁnition of the symbols recasts the set of equations (A.102), (A.103),
(A.104) in the more compact form
 div S D C ;
S D a grad u C b u :
(A.105)
In fact, (A.105) reduces to (A.102) by letting u D q '=.kB T/, a D "sc, b D 0,
S D q D=.kB T/, C D q %=.kB T/; in turn, it reduces to (A.103) by letting u D n,
a D Dn, b D n E, S D Jn=q, C D Wn  @n=@t; ﬁnally, it reduces to (A.104) by
letting u D p, a D Dp, b D p E, S D Jp=q, C D Wp C @p=@t. As mentioned
above, elimination of S transforms the pair of ﬁrst-order equations (A.105) into a
single, second-order equation, whose unknown is u.
A.13.1
Decoupled/Coupled Solution
Apart from the simpler case where the drift term is negligible, the problem to be
solved is nonlinear due to the presence of the n E, p E products in the transport
equations. Also, the mobilities and generation-recombination terms depend in
general on the problem’s unknowns (besides depending on parameters like, e.g.,
lattice temperature); such dependences may be nonlinear as well. To handle the
presence of nonlinear terms one may resort to different solution strategies; the
simplest one, called decoupled solution, works as follows: a tentative solution
n.0/.r/, p.0/.r/ is prescribed for the carrier concentrations, and (A.102) is solved
to yield the ﬁrst-iteration electric potential '.1/.r/. Next, (A.103) is solved for n
using '.1/ and p.0/ as data, to yield the ﬁrst-iteration electron concentration n.1/;
ﬁnally, (A.104) is solved for p using '.1/ and n.1/ as data, to yield the ﬁrst-iteration
hole concentration p.1/. In general, the spatial dependence of n.1/, p.1/ differs from
that of n.0/, p.0/; then, one solves again (A.102) using n.1/, p.1/ at the right-hand
side, to ﬁnd the second-iteration electric potential '.2/.r/, and so on. If the iterative
scheme converges, the process is brought to an end when one or more suitable error
indicators become lower than a prescribed limit; examples of such indicators are the
norms of the increments between two successive iterations,
jj'.kC1/  '.k/jj ;
jjn.kC1/  n.k/jj ;
jjp.kC1/  p.k/jj ;
(A.106)
with k the iteration index. The advantage of the decoupled solution lies in the fact
that the problem is decomposed into simpler problems, whose computational cost
is relatively small; on the other hand, the precision of the method is limited: from
a qualitative standpoint the power of the method is of the ﬁrst order, namely, the
improvement in the solution is about one digit per iteration.
In contrast, the coupled solution prescribes the tentative solution '.0/.r/, n.0/.r/,
p.0/.r/ to all unknowns, and linearizes the whole set of equations around the
tentative solution. In this way, the actual unknowns of the linearized system are the

increments ı'.r/, ın.r/, ıp.r/; once found, they are added to the tentative solution
to yield the ﬁrst-iteration solution:
'.1/ D '.0/ C ı' ;
n.1/ D n.0/ C ın ;
p.1/ D p.0/ C ıp :
(A.107)
The norm of the increments is monitored at each iteration to check the convergence
behavior. By way of example, consider the equilibrium condition, in which the
set of equations (A.102), (A.103), (A.104) reduces to the Poisson equation alone,
"sc r2' D % where (compare with (18.56) and (18.57)) it is % D q Œp.'/  n.'/ C

(A.108)
At convergence, both sides of (A.108) vanish; in fact, the increment ı' tends to zero
while '.k/ at the right-hand side tends to the equation’s solution. The advantage
of the coupled-solution method is that its power is of the second order; on the
other hand, its computational cost is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the decoupled
solution.14 As a rule of thumb, the more accurate coupled scheme is used when
the solution is nearly reached, so that a small number of iterations is sufﬁcient to
complete the calculation; the cheaper decoupled scheme is used instead during the
initial stages. It must be remarked that the convergence of the iteration methods
(either coupled or decoupled) is not guaranteed: it depends on the coefﬁcients of the
equations and on the choice of the tentative solution. Although the discussion about
the iteration methods is beyond the scope of this book, a hint about their general
structure is given in Sect. B.8.
It is also important to note that the above description of the decoupled- and
coupled-solution schemes is referred to the dependence of the unknowns on the
spatial coordinates, at a given instant of time t. If the problem depends on time,
when the spatial solution is completed, the process must be repeated after updating
the time variable. Considering that the differential problem with respect to time is of
the ﬁrst order, one has to deal with an open integration. As before, the convergence
of the integration process depends on the structure of the equations and is not
guaranteed in general.
14As shown below, the differential equation to be solved is transformed into an algebraic system
whose matrix has the size N  N, with N the number of spatial points where the unknown function
is sought. If C.N/ is the computational cost of solving an N  N algebraic system, the cost of
the iteration in a decoupled solution is 3 C.N/. When, instead, the coupled solution is used, each
iteration entails the solution of a 3 N  3 N algebraic system, thus yielding a cost per iteration
equal to C.3 N/. If the matrix has no special structure, the dependence of C on N is of the type
C ' const  Na, with a ranging between 2 and 3 depending on the solution method and the type
of matrix. It follows C.3 N/=Œ3 C.N/ D 3a1.

Discretization Scheme in One Dimension
An example of the solution method of (A.105) in one dimension is given here.
The solution is sought within a ﬁnite interval Œx0; xNC1, with prescribed boundary
conditions u0 D u.x0/, uNC1 D u.xNC1/. The interval is subdivided into N C 1
regions (elements), whose end points are called nodes. The number of internal nodes
is N, their positions are x1 < x2 < : : : < xN. The element bounded by xi and
xiC1 is indicated with hiC1; the same symbol indicates the length of the element,
hiC1 D xiC1  xi. Finally, a subdomain i, called cell, is associated with each node.
For the internal nodes x1; : : : ; xN the cell is bounded by xi  hi=2 and xi C hiC1=2.
The same symbol is used to indicate also the cell length, i D .hi C hiC1/=2. The
left boundary x0 is associated with the cell 0 of length h1=2 placed on the right of
x0, while the right boundary xNC1 is associated with the cell NC1 of length hNC1=2
placed on the left of xNC1. This procedure yields the same tessellation (or grid) as
that used in Sect. 13.6.6 with reference to the Schrödinger equation (Fig. A.2). The
lengths of the elements are not necessarily equal to each other; indeed, the choice
of the number of nodes, and of their placement along the domain, is by no means
an easy task. The general rule for constructing a grid is that the nodes should be
denser where the curvature of the unknown function is larger; unfortunately, the
information about curvature is not available a priori. An excessively large number
of nodes makes the solution procedure more expensive; nevertheless, a uniform
grid might in some cases be preferable to a coarser, nonuniform grid, because
uniform grids lend themselves to the application of more efﬁcient discretization
methods (A.13.3).
Discretization of the Poisson Equation
To proceed, consider (A.105) in one dimension with b D 0, namely, the Poisson
equation made of the pair dS=dx D C and S D a du=dx. Aim of the calculation
is to determine u at the nodes, given C and the boundary conditions. In the
Poisson equation, coefﬁcient a represents the material’s permittivity; if the domain
Œx0; xNC1 extends over different materials, the permittivity changes. To consider this
possibility, one must place a node at the interface between the two materials, and
ascribe the correct value to a on the two sides of the interface. More generally, one

can also assume that a takes a different value over each element:15 to indicate this,
one associates the element’s index with a. Now, the integration of dS=dx D C over
the ith cell yields Si  SiC1 D
R
i C dx, where the integral at the right-hand side can
be calculated to various degrees of approximation, depending on the information
available about C; the zero-order approximation consists in replacing the integral
with the product i Ci, with Ci the nodal value of C. The next step is the elimination
of S by means of S D a du=dx; to this purpose, one must express Si and SiC1 in terms
of the nodal values of u. The simplest way is using the difference quotients over each
element; in summary, one obtains

operator d2=dx2 is transformed. As is apparent from the discussion in Sect. A.11, it is necessary
that jaj  const > 0, namely, a must be either strictly positive or strictly negative. When the
Poisson equation is concerned, this condition is fulﬁlled because a stands for permittivity. As for
the drift-diffusion equation (discussed below), a is proportional to the carrier mobility: in this case,
care must be taken not to use models in which the degradation due to parameters (like, e.g., dopant
concentration) makes mobility to become arbitrarily small.

(A.113)
Remembering the deﬁnitions given in Sect. A.11, the diagonal of A is weakly
dominant (in fact, strict inequality holds only for the ﬁrst and last rows). Also,
A is irreducible: in fact, using for a moment the two-index notation, it is i D
.A/i;iC1 ¤ 0, ˇiC1 D .A/iC1;i ¤ 0, with i D 1 ; : : : ; N  1; remembering
the construction based on the oriented graph illustrated in Sect. A.11.5, one ﬁnds
that all points of the graph are pairwise connected in both directions, whence the
graph is connected. As a consequence of the second theorem in Sect. A.11.6, A is
non-singular and the solution of (A.113) is unique.16 It must be remarked that the
tridiagonal structure of A is due to the fact that the nodes are numbered in a speciﬁc
order. On the other hand, any permutation in the node numbering is equivalent to
multiplying A by one or more permutation matrices and, as shown in Sect. A.11,
a permutation multiplies det A by ˙1. Thus, if det A ¤ 0 for a speciﬁc node
numbering, it will be so for any other numbering.
Discretization of the Linearized Poisson Equation

with the comments in Sect. 4.12.3.

In principle, the term 	 u could be incorporated into the deﬁnition of C; this,
however, is not convenient because of its explicit dependence on the unknown.
The discretization scheme of (A.116) leads again to an algebraic system of the
form (A.112), (A.113), the only difference being in the deﬁnition of the diagonal
entries of A; one ﬁnds in fact ˛i D ˇi C i C i 	i where, as before, ˇi D ai=hi and
i D aiC1=hiC1, i D 1; : : : ; N.
An important observation is that 	i > 0; this is easily found in the approximation
of parabolic bands and nondegenerate conditions, where the equilibrium concentra-
tions are given by (18.62); one ﬁnds in fact d.n  p/=d' D q .n C p/=.kB T/ > 0.
The result is the same also in the general case (Sect. 18.5), where the equilibrium
concentrations are given by

Observing that ˇi; i > 0 the addition of the positive term i 	i to the diagonal
makes the latter strongly dominant (Sect. A.11.5). This does not change the nature of
the system’s matrix, which would be non-singular even if all 	i vanished; however,
when an algebraic system is tackled with an iterative-solution method, the more
dominant the diagonal, the faster the convergence.
Discretization of the Drift-Diffusion Equation
Consider now the case of (A.105) with b ¤ 0, still in one dimension; this yields
the pair of normalized continuity and drift-diffusion transport equations dS=dx D
C and S D a du=dx C b u. Aim of the calculation is again to determine u at the
nodes, given C and the boundary conditions. As symbol u is used here to indicate
the carrier concentration, a change in notation is necessary with respect to the case
of Poisson’s equation; speciﬁcally, one lets  D q '=.kB T/ in the electron-transport
equation, and  D q '=.kB T/ in the hole-transport equation: with this provision,
both equations take the form S D a .du=dx  u d=dx/. Integration of dS=dx D C
over the ith cell yields, like in the case of Poisson’s equation, Si  SiC1 ' i Ci.
The transport equation is more suitably recast in the self-adjoint form S exp./ D
a d Œu exp./ =dx; integration of the latter over the ith element hi, with S D Si and
a D ai, provides

structurally identical to (A.110). The auxiliary unknown w D u exp./ has a
physical meaning: remembering in fact that the drift-diffusion equations in (A.103)
and (A.104) hold within the approximations of parabolic bands and nondegenerate
conditions (Sect. 19.5.2), the electron and hole concentrations can be expressed
by means of the quasi-Fermi potentials 'n, 'p like in (19.140); it follows that
w D ni expŒq 'n=.kB T/ for the electrons, and w D ni expŒq 'p=.kB T/ for the
holes. Given the boundary conditions u0, uNC1 of the concentration (Sect. 19.5.6),
the algebraic system to be solved has the form (A.112), (A.113), with ˛i D ˇi C i,
ˇi D ai=Yi and i D aiC1=YiC1, i D 1; : : : ; N; in particular, the system matrix is
tridiagonal and symmetric. The matrix is also irreducible with a weakly dominant
diagonal; as a consequence of the second theorem in Sect. A.11.6, it is non-singular:
in conclusion, the solution w1, : : :, wN is unique.
To calculate the denominator Yi, one must provide the explicit form of the electric
potential over the corresponding element hi. To this purpose one observes that in the
solution of the Poisson equation carried out earlier, the derivative of the electric
potential over each element is approximated with the difference quotient; this is
equivalent to assuming that the electric potential is piecewise constant over the
elements. The same approximation is used here to yield  D i1 C .i  i1/ x=hi

if the quantities wi are used as unknowns, one extracts Yi from the ﬁrst relation

ui are to be kept, one replaces exp.i/=Yi from the second relation in (A.121); in
this case, letting Bk

A.13.3
The Numerov Process
Considering the discretized form (A.110) of Poisson’s equation, a few comments
are useful. First, the right-hand side i Ci is one of the possible approximations of
R
i C dx; other forms of the right-hand side are possible if a different interpolation
scheme was used. Also, the left-hand side of (A.110) may be viewed as an
interpolation of the unknown function u over the three nodes xi1, xi, xiC1, that
determines one of the nodal values when the other two are given; it is therefore of
interest to investigate the order of the approximation of the left-hand side. For this,
one takes the case19 a D 1 and seeks for a parabolic interpolation of the unknown
u over a triad of consecutive nodes, u
 
f.x/ D f0 x2 C f1 x C f2. After ﬁxing
xi D 0, let the abscissæ of the right and left node be hR and hL, respectively;
the corresponding nodal values of the unknown are u0, uR, and uL, while the cell’s
18Symmetry holds only when  ! 0 over each element. In fact, lim!0 B./ D 1; this case
corresponds to  D const (diffusive-only transport), where the equation to be solved becomes
identical to Poisson’s.
19The restriction a D 1 is taken here for the sake of simplicity. As shown below, the analysis would
be the same in the general case a D a.x/.

782

Vector and Matrix Analysis
length is .hL C hR/=2. Here the equation to be solved reads d2u=dx2 D C: in the
parabolic approximation its left-hand side becomes 2 f0, namely, a constant; one
then chooses such a constant as C0 D C.0/. Then, the coefﬁcients of the parabolic
interpolation are readily found by imposing that f equals the nodal values of u; in
particular, one ﬁnds f2 D f.0/ D u0, so that the other two nodal values fulﬁll the
relations
f0 h2
R C f1 hR D uR  u0 ;
f0 h2

whence
hR .u0  uL/ C hL .u0  uR/ D f0 .h2
R hL C h2
L hR/ :
(A.125)
Letting f0 D C0=2 and dividing both sides by hR hL renders .u0  uL/=hL C .u0 
uR/=hR D C0 .hL C hR/=2, identical to the special case of (A.110) where a is set
equal to unity. This shows that the left-hand side of (A.110) is in fact a parabolic
interpolation.
As for the calculation of the right-hand side, the accuracy of the interpolation
can be increased, with respect to that of (A.110), without changing the number of
nodes involved in it, and with a negligible increase in the computational cost, by
better exploiting the form of the equation. This is achieved by the so-called Numerov
process (the original reference is [100], cited, e.g., in [22]), which is illustrated
below. Prior to that, one disposes of the simplifying assumption a D 1 as follows:
consider the general form of the equation, dS=dx D C, S D a du=dx, and assume
that a D a.x/ is a given function of position; changing the independent variable
from x to , such that

where u, S, a, and C are now functions of . With no loss of the generality one
can then base the description of the Numerov process upon the form d2u=d2 D
B where, due to the change in the independent variable, the new elements of the
discretization grid will be indicated with si. To proceed, it is necessary to assume
that the elements are all equal, s1 D : : : D sNC1 D s; a series expansion of u at i,
using s as increment,20 combined with u00 D B, provides
20It must be assumed that s is smaller than the convergence radius of the series.

By the same token one expresses ui1 using s as increment; this yields a new series
whose odd-degree terms have the opposite sign with respect to those of (A.128).

As shown above, the essence of the method is the elimination of the derivatives of
odd order, and the exploitation of the form of the original equation to eliminate the
fourth derivative of u. In this respect, the method is applicable to other classes of
equations that provide the form of the second derivative of the unknown function,
without involving the ﬁrst derivative; an example of this is the time-independent
Schrödinger equation, which is in fact amenable to the application of the Numerov
process (Sect. 13.6.6 and Prob. 13.3). One also notes that if the last term at the right-
hand side of (A.129) was neglected, the discretized form of the Poisson equation
would become identical to (A.109), the latter with a D 1 and h1 D : : : D hNC1 D h.
Due to this, and considering also that the derivative of the ﬁfth order is eliminated
from the beginning, one ﬁnds that the interpolation of the right-hand side provided
by the Numerov process is more accurate by three orders with respect to the standard
one [19, 20].22
By a suitable generalization of the variable transformation (A.126), the Numerov
process can be extended to the discretization of the continuity and drift-diffusion
equations. As shown above, these equations can be recast as dS=dx D C
and, respectively, S exp./ D a dw=dx, with w D u exp./. By analogy
with (A.126) one changes the independent variable from x to , such that
21Using the new unknown v D 12 u=s2 in (A.131) makes the grid’s details invisible.
22The elimination of the odd-order derivatives requires the uniformity of the elements’ size; this
drawback, however, is largely compensated by the superior accuracy of the method, which allows
for coarser grids.

for the Poisson equation. This, in general, is not possible because the variable
transformations (A.126) and (A.132) are different; for this reason, an interpolation
of  from one grid to the other is necessary.23 The solution of (A.133) is then
completed as for the Poisson equation, leading to an equation identical to (A.131)
where w and D replace u and B.
23If the Poisson equation is solved over a domain where the permittivity a is constant, then the
grid transformation (A.126) becomes trivial. However, the interpolation to the other grid is still
necessary.

Coordinate Rotation
Consider a coordinate transformation that consists in a rotation around the origin,

relations

where the integration is carried out over the whole domain of u, v, w. Next, consider
the transformation from the original variables to the new variables ˛, ˇ, ,

vanish. After the transformation is carried out, (B.26) takes the form
S./ D
ZZZ
s.˛; ˇ; ; / jJj d˛ dˇ d :
(B.28)
It may happen that one is interested in the dependence of s on one of the new
variables, say, , rather than in the details about its dependence on the whole set
of new variables. In this case one ﬁrst carries out the integrals with respect to ˛ and
ˇ in (B.28), to ﬁnd

Then one deﬁnes

(B.30)
A function like b./ plays an important role in many physical problems (e.g.,
Sects. 14.6, 15.8.1, 15.8.2). For this reason, although its derivation in this section
is of a purely formal nature, b./ will be called density of states in . Note that the
density of states depends only on the structure of the variable transformation (B.27)
and (at most) on . The form of (B.29) and (B.30) shows that the ratio Ns D h=b is
a weighed average of s.˛; ˇ; ; / over the two variables ˛ and ˇ, that uses jJj as
weight. Introducing the deﬁnition of Ns into (B.28) gives the latter form
S./ D
Z
b./ Ns.; / d :
(B.31)
If s happens to be independent of ˛ and ˇ, deﬁnition (B.29) yields h D s b, whence
Ns.; / D s.; /. The derivation of b is not limited to a three-dimensional case;
in fact it applies to any number of dimensions. In the following, a few examples
in one, two, and three dimensions are given, in which one of the transformation
relations (B.27), namely,  D .u; v; w/, has a quadratic form; these examples are
in fact particularly signiﬁcant for the physical applications, where  stands for the
energy and u, v, w stand for the generalized coordinates.

This case is straightforward because there are no other variables involved in the
transformation. Instead, in the two-dimensional case with  D u2 Cv2, a convenient

The above examples show that despite the fact that the  D .u; v; w/ relation is
quadratic in all cases, the form of b./ changes depending on the number of spatial
dimensions.
Still considering the case where one of the transformation relations (B.27) has
a quadratic form, the analysis can be extended to arbitrary values of the number
of spatial dimensions. As a starting point, and considering provisionally the three-
dimensional case, one notes from (B.30) that the following equality holds:2

Remembering the deﬁnition of b, it follows that B is the number of states in the
domain of u; v; w. Due to the last integral in (B.34), B is also equal to the volume
of such a domain; in turn, due to the ﬁrst integral, B can be thought of as the sum
of the volumes of elementary shells of thickness d, with b./ the area of each shell
(that is, the area of the two-dimensional surface  D const). These observations
provide the key to extending the analysis to the case where  is a quadratic form in
an arbitrary number of dimensions,

Letting  D const, (B.36) is the equation of an .n  1/-dimensional sphere of radius

expressing the area of the sphere in terms of ; although it can be solved by using a

constant factor Q0, called density of states in the u; v; w space which, besides describing some
properties of the physical problem under investigation, makes B dimensionless. Here, all variables
involved are dimensionless, and Q0 is set equal to unity.

generalization of the spherical coordinates to n dimensions, a more elegant approach
consists in ﬁnding a recursive expression involving also the sphere’s volume.
To this purpose, let Vn indicate the volume of a sphere of an n-dimensional space,
and let Sn1 indicate the surface area of the same sphere. When n D 1, the sphere
is a segment whose volume is the length V1 D 2 g; for n D 2, the sphere is a circle
whose volume is the area V2 D  g2; for n D 3 it is V3 D .4=3/  g3; for n D 4
it is V4 D 2 g4=2, and so on; in turn, for n D 2 the surface is a circumference
whose area is the length S1 D 2  g; for n D 3 it is S2 D 4  g2; for n D 4 it is
S3 D 2 2 g3, and so on. Consistently with the expression of B as the integral of b
given by (B.35), one ﬁnds from the above values the general relation
Vn D g
n Sn1 :
(B.37)
Combining (B.37) with V1 D 2 g also yields S0 D 2, that is, the “surface” of
the segment considered above; such a surface is made of the segment’s endpoints
f1; C1g. From (B.37) it also follows that Vn / gn and Sn1 / gn1, whence
Sn / g Vn1 and V0 D const. From the values found above one ﬁnds S2=.g V1/ D
S3=.g V2/ D 2 ; it follows that Sn D 2  g Vn1 and V0 D 1. The latter is the
“volume” of a sphere in a zero-dimensional space. The recursive relation involving
the volumes then reads
Vn D g
n Sn1 D g
n 2  g Vn2 D 2  g2
n
Vn2 ;
V0 D 1 ;
V1 D 2 g :
(B.38)
The above can further be improved by observing that the sequence V0, V1; : : :
embeds Euler’s Gamma function of half-integer order; in fact, combining (B.37)
and (B.38) with the deﬁnitions of Sect. C.10, yields
Vn D

 .n=2 C 1/ gn ;
Sn1 D
n n=2
 .n=2 C 1/ gn1 :
(B.39)
The last step consists in expressing the result in terms of . This is accomplished by
noting that b./ d D Sn1.g/ dg, where g D p and dg D dp D d=.2 p/;
then, one ﬁnds

B.6
Constrained Extrema—Lagrange Method
In several occasions it is necessary to determine an extremum point of a function
under one or more additional constraints (constrained extremum). To begin, one
considers a function f that depends on two variables, x and y. It is implied that
f is differentiable in its domain of deﬁnition, D; for the sake of conciseness, the
partial derivatives with respect to the variables are indicated here with fx and fy. The
problem to be solved is ﬁnding an extremum of f in D subjected to a constraint of
the form F.x; y/ D 0, where it is assumed that F is differentiable in D and that if the
extremum exists, either Fx, or Fy, or both, are different from zero there.
To proceed, let x0, y0 be the extremum’s coordinates; since F D 0 everywhere in
D, it must be dF D 0 in .x0; y0/, namely,
Fx.x0; y0/ dx C Fy.x0; y0/ dy D 0
(B.41)
where, by hypothesis, at least one of the two derivatives is different from zero.
Assume that Fy.x0; y0/ ¤ 0; then, using sufﬁx “0” to indicate that the derivatives are
calculated in the extremum, from (B.41) the relation dy D .Fx=Fy/0 dx follows.
Such a relation provides the increment dy corresponding to an arbitrary increment
dx, in other terms it provides the derivative at .x0; y0/ of the function y D y.x/
implicitly deﬁned by F D 0. The same reasoning applies when Fx.x0; y0/ ¤ 0,
yielding in this case the inverse function x D x.y/.
In the extremum it is also df D 0, namely,
fx.x0; y0/ dx C fy.x0; y0/ dy D 0 ;
(B.42)
where the relation between dx and dy is prescribed by (B.41). For (B.41) and (B.42)
to be compatible it must be
det
 fx.x0; y0/ fy.x0; y0/
Fx.x0; y0/ Fy.x0; y0/

D 0 :
(B.43)
The determinant vanishes if, e.g., the rows are a linear combination of each other,
say, fx D  Fx, fy D  Fy, with  ¤ 0 an undetermined parameter. Combining the
above with the constraint F D 0 yields
fx.x0; y0/ D  Fx.x0; y0/ ;
fy.x0; y0/ D  Fy.x0; y0/ ;
F.x0; y0/ D 0 ;
(B.44)
namely, a system of three equations in the unknowns x0, y0, , whose solution
provides the coordinates of the extremum and the parameter. The latter is called
Lagrangian multiplier. It is worth noting that the ﬁrst two equations in (B.44) are
equivalent to

794
B
Coordinates
@
@x .f   F/ D 0 ;
@
@y .f   F/ D 0 :
(B.45)
Thus, the calculation of a constrained extremum entails the construction of the
auxiliary function f   F. If no constraint exists, the procedure is brought back
to the calculation of the unconstrained extremum of f, which requires the solution
of the system
fx.x0; y0/ D 0 ;
fy.x0; y0/ D 0
(B.46)
in the two unknowns x0, y0; such equations may be thought of as derived from (B.45)
by letting  D 0 there.
In the example using a two-variable function shown above it would be impossible
to add another constraint, say, G D 0: in fact, the increments dy D .Fx=Fy/0 dx and
dy D .Gx=Gy/0 dx are different in general. It follows that the number of constraints
must be smaller than the number of variables. Some other examples of the procedure
are shown below.
Consider the Lagrange method applied to a function of three variables x, y, z,
to which one constraint of the form F.x; y; z/ D 0 is applied. Following the same
reasoning as in the two-variable case one obtains
fx dx C fy dy C fz dz D 0 ;
Fx dx C Fy dy C Fz dz D 0 ;
(B.47)
where the derivatives are calculated at the extremum point .x0; y0; z0/. Assuming
that Fz.x0; y0; z0/ ¤ 0 and eliminating dz from (B.47) yields
.fx Fz  fz Fx/ dx C

fy Fz  fz Fy
	
dy D 0 :
(B.48)
On account of the arbitrariness of dx and dy in (B.48), the corresponding coefﬁcients
must vanish, leading to the system
fx D  Fx ;
fy D  Fy ;
fz D  Fz ;
F D 0
(B.49)
in the four unknowns x0, y0, z0, .
As a ﬁnal example consider the case of the constrained extremum of a function
that depends on three variables, subjected to two constraints, namely, F D 0, G D 0.
Letting df D 0, dF D 0, and dG D 0 in the extremum provides, as in the case
of (B.43),

two Lagrangian multipliers. In conclusion, the system to be solved is made of the

As a consequence, transformation (B.52) is invertible, namely, there exist the
relations x D x.u; v/ and y D y.u; v/. It follows that starting from a function '.x; y/
deﬁned in D and letting  .u; v/ D 'Œx.u; v/; y.u; v/, it is

@v2 jrvj2 C 2 @2

The conditions on the variable transformations are sought for which  is harmonic
with respect to u; v. They are easily found as r2u D r2v D 0, ru  rv D 0, and
jruj2 D jrvj2 ¤ 0. The ﬁrst condition shows that u and v must be harmonic. The
second one yields

with ! yet undetermined. As a consequence, the third condition becomes jruj2 D
!2 jrvj2, thus yielding ! D ˙1 for all x; y. Taking ! D 1 provides the Cauchy-

(B.58)
by which u and v are harmonic conjugate and the complex function deﬁned by
ujv is analytical in D. An invertible transformation fulﬁlling the Cauchy-Riemann
relations determines a conformal mapping between the domains D and D0 [7, 142].
By way of example, let w D x2 C .y C 1/2 and
u D .x2 C y2  1/=w ;
v D 2 x=w :
(B.59)
It is easily found that u and v are harmonic and fulﬁll the Cauchy-Riemann relations
of the ﬁrst kind (B.57). In particular,

From the above the Jacobian determinant of the variable transformation turns out to
be jruj2 D 4 w2 > 0. To ﬁnd the inverse relations one observes that from the above
deﬁnitions,
u  1 D 2 .y C 1/=w ;
v D 2 x=w :
(B.61)
Squaring (B.61), adding term by term, and using the deﬁnition of w yield .u1/2 C
v2 D 4=w D 2 v=x whereas, dividing term by term, yields .u1/=v D .yC1/=x.
Combining the above results and letting m D .u  1/2 C v2, one ﬁnds
x D 2 v=m ;
y D 2 .1  u/=m  1 :
(B.62)
In particular, letting y D 0 provides u2 C v2 D 1, thus showing that the variable
transformation (B.59) carries the x axis of the x; y space onto the circumference C
of unit radius centered in the origin of the u; v space. In turn, the upper half plane

disk it is m D u2  2 u C 1 C v2 < 2 .1  u/, whence y D 2 .1  u/=m  1 > 0.
At the same time, letting u D 1  , v D ˙, yields m D 2 2, whence x D 
2=,
showing that the values of jxj may become arbitrarily large as u; v span the disk. A
similar reasoning shows that the exterior of the disk, u2 C v2 > 1, is carried onto
the lower half plane y < 0. When the point Q D .; 0/ runs over the x axis from

the function (B.64) obtained from '.x; y/ by a transformation using harmonic-

of the boundary it is more convenient to turn to the polar coordinates u D  cos #,

Contraction Mapping
Before illustrating the contraction mapping it is necessary to provide some prelimi-
nary concepts. Given a set X of elements x, y, z, : : :, one deﬁnes a distance by means
of a nonnegative, single-valued real function % having the following properties: for
any x, y, and z of X it is
1. .x ; y/ D 0 if and only if x D y,
2. %.x ; y/ D %.y ; x/ (symmetry),
3. %.x ; z/  %.x ; y/ C %.y ; z/ (triangle inequality).

798
B
Coordinates
A set equipped with a distance is called metric space and is indicated with R; its
elements are called points. In general, there are several functions % that fulﬁll the
requisites of distance; each of them deﬁnes a different metric space.
A sequence x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; of points of a metric space R (also indicated with fxng)
fulﬁlls the Cauchy criterion if, given " > 0, there exists an index n" such that
.xn ; xm/ < " for all n ; m > n"; a sequence that fulﬁlls the Cauchy criterion is called
Cauchy sequence. A metric space R is complete if every Cauchy sequence fxng of
points of R converges to an element of R; otherwise, R is incomplete.3 Examples of
complete metric spaces are the space of real numbers with distance %.x ; y/ D jxyj,
and the space of N-tuples x D .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xN/ with Euclidean distance
%.x ; y/ D

(B.67)
The triangle inequality for (B.67) is readily checked using the Schwarz inequal-
ity (A.5). The Euclidean distance (B.67) is generalized by letting n D 3; 4; : : :. As n
increases, the difference xk  yk having the largest modulus becomes dominant and,
in the n ! 1 limit, (B.67) yields
%.x ; y/ D maxkjxk  ykj :
(B.68)
Now, consider a correspondence A between a point y of a metric space R and
another point z of R. Such a correspondence is indicated with z D A y. For the time
being, these symbols are used without a speciﬁc reference to the objects of interest;
for instance, R could be the real line, an N-dimensional space, a space of functions,
and so on; correspondingly, A could be a function proper, a matrix, an operator, and
so on. Multiple applications of correspondence A are indicated with powers, e.g.,
A2y means A.A y/. Given these premises, a point x of R is called ﬁxed point of A if
A brings x on itself, namely,
x D A x :
(B.69)
In turn, correspondence A is called contraction mapping or contraction if, for any
pair of points x, y of R there exists a positive number ˛ < 1 such that
%.A x ; A y/  ˛ %.x ; y/ :
(B.70)
From (B.70) it follows that a contraction is continuous. The theorem holds [81, Sect.
2-8.1]: Any contraction deﬁned over a complete metric space has one and only one
3For instance, in the metric space of rational numbers Z with distance .x ; y/ D jx  yj, consider
the sequence whose nth element has the integer part equal to unity and the decimal part made of
the ﬁrst n decimal ﬁgures of
p

ﬁxed point. The theorem, called ﬁxed-point theorem or successive-approximations
theorem, can be exploited to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution
of several classes of equations. As shown in the examples below, it also provides
practical methods for calculating the solution.
B.8.1
Determining the Zero of a Function
Let ' be a function deﬁned over the interval I D Œa; b, such that '.x/ belongs to I
as well; also, for any pair p, q of I, let ' fulﬁll the Lipschitz condition
j'.p/  '.q/j  K jp  qj ;
0 < K < 1 :
(B.71)
As jpqj is a distance proper, ' is a contraction and, given the initial point x0 within
I, the sequence x0 ; x1 D '.x0/ ; x2 D '.x1/ ; : : : ; converges to the unique root of
the equation '.x/ D x. If, in particular, ' is differentiable in I, for the mean-value
theorem there exists  2 Œp; q such that Œ'.p/  '.q/=.p  q/ D '0./. Observing
that (B.71) applies to any pair p, q, one may recast it as
ˇˇ'0ˇˇ  K < 1
in
I :
(B.72)
The example shows that to determine the zero of an equation of the form f.x/ D 0
within an interval I, one may resort to an auxiliary equation '.x/ D x such that ' is a
contraction in I and its ﬁxed point coincides with the zero of f. For a given function f
there are in general several possibilities to deﬁne such a '; one of these, particularly
interesting for the applications, provides the so-called Newton’s method, extensively
used in the numerical solution of the semiconductor equations (Sect. A.13.1).

Comparing with the deﬁnitions and results of Sect. A.11.1 one ﬁnds that if the

As the value of the integral in (C.37) is independent of a, the integral is equal to unity
also in the limit a ! 0. Figure C.1 shows how the form of B changes with a: the
width of the peak decreases as a decreases, while its height increases so that the area
subtending the function remains constant. Note that the procedure depicted above
gives a different result if one carries out the integration after calculating the limit.
In other terms, the integration and the limit are to be carried out in a speciﬁc order

The function B.x; a/ deﬁned above is an example of generating function of the

(C.55)
Replacing k with k in (C.55) shows that ı is even with respect to its argument,
ı.x  / D ı.  x/. Also, comparing (C.55) with (C.16) shows that ı.  x/ is
the Fourier transform of exp.i k x/=

one dimension is immediate; e.g., the three-dimensional case reads
ı.g  x/ D
ZZZ C1

expŒi k  .x  g/

d3k :
(C.56)
The discrete-case analogue of (C.56) is given by (C.126, C.130), where the gener-
alization of the Kronecker symbol is given. Note that the latter is dimensionless,
whereas the units of Dirac’s ı depend on its argument: by way of example, the
integral
R C1
1 ı.  x/ d D 1 shows that the units of ı.  x/ are the inverse of
those of d; similarly, the integral
RRR C1
1 ı.g  x/ d3g D 1 shows that the units of
ı.g  x/ are the inverse of those of d3g, and so on.
A generalization of Dirac’s ı is found by replacing ı.x/ with ıŒq.x/, with q.x/ a
function having one or more zeros. Let x1 be a simple zero of q, namely, q0.x1/ ¤ 0,
and consider the contribution of it to the integral
R C1
1 ıŒq.x/ dx. Observing that in
a ﬁnite neighborhood I1 of x1 there are no other zeros, one can determine such
a contribution by replacing q.x/ with q0.x1/ .x  x1/; in this way, to bring the
calculation back to the standard form one may provisionally scale the differential
dx by 1=q0.x1/. However, if the scaling factor was negative, the evenness of ı would
be violated; thus, the correct scaling factor is jq0.x1/j, and

(C.59)
It is assumed that the integral converges for any n. This implies that f vanishes at
inﬁnity with a strength larger than any power. As the present considerations apply
to a distribution function, the vanishing of f is typically of the exponential type. The
quantity Mn is called moment of order n of function f. Thanks to its properties, f
can be Fourier transformed; let

The above analysis shows that if the moments Mn of f.k/ are known, from them
one constructs the Fourier transform g.y/ D Ff by means of a Taylor series. Then,
one recovers the original function from the inverse transform f.k/ D F 1g. In
conclusion, the knowledge of the set of moments of f is equivalent to the knowledge
of f. The result holds true also in the multi-dimensional case f D f.k/, where

If only the lower-order moments are used, then the Taylor series for the Fourier
transform is truncated and provides an approximation Qg for g. As a consequence of
this approximation, the inverse transform Qf D F 1Qg provides an approximate form
of the original function f.
An extension of the above concepts is obtained by replacing the monomial
expression kl

interpolation. In this case, in fact, the integral of ˛.k/ f.k/ is a combination of

moments of f. A further generalization consists in considering f, ˛, or both, as
functions of other variables besides k:
M˛.r; t/ D
ZZZ C1
1
˛.r; k; t/ f.r; k; t/ d3k :
(C.64)
If f.r; k; t/ is the solution of a differential equation generated by an operator A ,
say, A f D 0, one can derive a set of moments from such an equation by selecting
different forms of ˛:
ZZZ C1
1
˛ A f d3k D 0 :
(C.65)
Each moment depends on the other variables r; t. If operator A contains the
derivatives with respect to r, t, or both, then the moment of A f D 0 is a differential
equation in r, t, or both.

The last equality is demonstrated by applying Cauchy’s residue theorem [142, Sect.
64] to the function f.z/ D z1=.1 C z/, with z complex, that over the real axis
reduces to the integrand of (C.87). To proceed, one must ﬁrst observe that f.z/ is a
multivalued function; this is readily seen by letting z D r exp.i ˛/ and recasting f
in the form f.z/ D .1 C z/1 expŒ.  1/ .log r C i ˛/. One then considers only one
branch of f, letting for instance 0  ˛ < 2 . Also, it is found that f is continuous
in the complex plane with the exception of the positive part of the real axis; in fact,
in the vicinity of a point x of it, it is ˛ ! 0 for =.z/ > 0 and ˛ ! 2  for =.z/ < 0.
The corresponding limits of f are

of two circumferences A and B, centered in the origin and having radii a < 1 and

clockwise starting from z D a; next, segment Q is traced from a to b along the upper
edge, where f.z/ is given by the ﬁrst expression in (C.88). Then, circumference B
is traced counterclockwise, followed by segment Q from b to a along the lower
edge, where f.z/ is given by the second expression in (C.88). In the interior of the
integration path f has the simple pole z0 D 1 D exp.i /, whose residue is

Gamma Function’s Asymptotic Behavior
Euler’s Gamma function introduced in Sect. C.10, considered for real values of ,
lends itself to a signiﬁcant application of the asymptotic analysis. Speciﬁcally, one
seeks another function f./, expressible through elementary functions, such that
lim!1Œ . C 1/=f./ D 1. The asymptotic analysis applied to the  function

The asymptotic value of the derivative of log  is also of interest, for instance

The Fermi integrals embed the Fermi-Dirac statistics (18.54), whose form is
P./ D 1=Œexp./ C 1. It is easily found that the latter fulﬁlls the relation

P./  1=2 is an odd function of . It follows that the set of coefﬁcients in the

Random Walk Problem
The problem considered in this section goes under the general name of random walk
problem. In its simplest formulation, the problem considers an object performing a
one-dimensional motion made of steps of equal length, in which each step has the
same probability 0 < p < 1 of being made in the positive direction; the probability
for the negative direction is therefore q D 1  p. Given the initial position of the
object, the issue is determining the probability that after n steps the position has a
speciﬁed value. A generalization of the problem is considering a motion in two or
more dimensions; in this case, the issue is to ﬁnd the probability that after n steps
the object is located at a speciﬁed distance from the origin.
Another generalization, which is considered below, is that of a one-dimensional
motion where the length  of each step is a continuous variable. In this case one
must assign a probability density p./ such that p./ d is the probability that the
displacement at the ith step lies between  and  C d; function p is the same for all
steps, and the outcome of each step is independent from that of the other steps. The
total displacement after n steps is x D 1 C    C n; letting P.x/ be the probability
density such that P.x/ dx is the probability that the total displacement lies between
x and x C dx, the issue is determining P, given p.
The problem may be tackled by provisionally considering the simpler example of
a die tossed four times, thus giving the sequence of four numbers fm1; m2; m3; m4g,
1  mi  6. The probability4 QP.x/ is sought that the sum x D m1 C m2 C m3 C m4
equals a given number, e.g., x D 7. As the probability that the ith event yields mi is
Qpi.mi/ D 1=6, it follows that the probability of each sequence fm1; m2; m3; m4g of
four independent events is Qp1.m1/    Qp4.m4/ D 1=64 D 1=1;296. Clearly,

Although this example may seem trivial, it provides a hint for solving the original
problem. As the displacements are independent from each other, the probability of
a particular sequence 1, 2, : : :, n is given by p.1/ p.2/ : : : p.n/, where p fulﬁlls

Central Limit Theorem
The results of Sect. C.18 have been obtained without the need of specifying the
form of the probability density p./; in fact, the only hypothesis is that the events
are mutually independent. It has also been proven that when the number n of events
becomes large, the distribution of the sum x tends to concentrate around the mean
value hxi. This suggests that when the number of events is large, it is sensible
to seek for an approximate description of the central part of P.x/ (namely, that
corresponding to the values of x sufﬁciently near to hxi), because the majority of
the P.x/ values belong there.
To begin, one remembers that q.0/ D 1 and limjkj!1 q.k/ D 0. This means that
for jkj sufﬁciently large it is jq.k/j < q.0/ D 1. From the second relation in (C.158)
one ﬁnds that the rapidness with which q vanishes for k ¤ 0 depends on the form
of p./; if p./ varies slowly in a range a <  < b in which many oscillations
of exp.i k / occur, the oscillations almost cancel each other and the corresponding
integral tends to vanish:
Z b
a
p./ exp.i k / d ' p.a/
Z b
a
exp.i k / d ' 0 :
(C.168)
The condition that makes p a slowly varying function in the given range is
p D jdp=dj .b  a/  p; in turn, the condition that the range contains many
oscillations reads jkj .b  a/  1; combining the two conditions yields
1
jkj
ˇˇˇˇ
dp
d
ˇˇˇˇ  p ;
(C.169)
where the range of ba has been eliminated. For all values of k that fulﬁll (C.169),
jqj rapidly decays to zero as k departs from zero. The decay is much more rapid for
qn when n is large; this suggests to calculate P.x/ in (C.158) by expanding qn, or
some function of it, into a Taylor series around k D 0 and truncating the series to
some order. To proceed, one recasts the second relation in (C.158) by expanding the
exponential, to ﬁnd (compare with (C.61))

As indicated above, qn decays rapidly to zero for a large n; it is then preferable to
use the logarithm by letting q.k/ D 1C#, where # D hi i k.1=2/ h2i k2 C   is
the part of the series starting from m D 1. It follows qn D expŒn log.1 C #/, where
j#j < 1 because the values of k near k D 0 are considered: this makes it possible
to use the series expansion log.1 C #/ D #  .1=2/ #2 C .1=3/ #3 C    . Finally,
one replaces the expression of # in the last series and retains only the terms that are
ﬁrst or second order in k: one ﬁnds that # contributes a term of the ﬁrst order and

C

835
another term of the second order; next, .1=2/ #2 contributes a term of the second
order, which is kept, and higher-order terms, which are neglected; the terms from
.1=3/ #3 on are not considered. Thus,

set of mutually independent events, having a slowly varying probability density
p./, the central part of the probability density of the sum x D 1 C    C n
is well approximated by a Gaussian. This result, called central-limit theorem, is
very important because its conditions, being relatively unrestrictive, apply to a large
variety of practical cases.

The state trajectory of the harmonic oscillator of the general form used in
Prob. 1.3, in the s ! 1 limit, is sketched in Fig. D.4. The problem reduces to
describing the motion of a particle within a square well. Assume that the particle is
initially at A; its position x coincides with the negative edge xM of the well, and its
momentum is positive. The particle’s motion at A is oriented in the positive direction
of the x axis; when the particle reaches the positive edge xM (point B in Fig. D.4),
a time has elapsed corresponding to the difference between the positions of B and
A along the vertical axis. As shown by the ﬁrst portion of the state trajectory (thick
line between A and B), the x.t/ relation is linear; in fact, the particle’s velocity p=m
is constant. At point B, the particle is reﬂected by the right edge of the well, so that
its momentum reverses in zero time: this is described by the segment between B
and C, the two extrema of which have the same position along the x axis and also
along the t axis. After the reﬂection has occurred, the particle continues its motion
with a constant (negative) momentum towards the left edge of the well (dashed line
starting from C). Note that the orientations of the x and p axes are different from
those used in Probs. 1.2 and 1.3; for this reason, here the motion of the phase point
viewed from the positive side of the t axis is counterclockwise.

it does. Still in the case s D 2 one ﬁnds T D 2 =!, ! D
p
c=m, as should be
(compare with the results of Sect. 3.3). In turn, the case s ! 1 yields s1=s ! 1,
c1=s ! 1 whence, using (C.108), lims!1 T D
p
8 m=E. The above is the period
in a square well of length 2 (compare with the description of Sect. 3.2). In fact, as
s ! 1, the potential energy cjxjs=s transforms into a square well with xM D 1.
The potential energy is shown in Fig. D.5 for some values of s. Thanks to the result
of this problem one may tune the form of the potential energy to make the period
proportional to a chosen power h D 1=s  1=2  1=2 of the energy. For instance,
letting s D 2=3 makes T proportional to E, namely, T D

whence n dx2=ds D const, n dx3=ds D const. The ratio of the latter relations yields
dx2=dx3 D const, namely, x2 D a x3 C b, where a, b are constants. This expression
is one of the two parametric equations u.x1; x2; x3/ D 0, v.x1; x2; x3/ D 0 describing
the ray, and shows that the ray belongs to a plane parallel to x1. By a suitable rotation
around x1, such that x2 ! x0
2, x3 ! x0
3, the plane of the ray is made parallel to
the plane x1 x0

3 is ﬁxed. In the new reference, let #

constant refraction index, nA and, respectively, nB ¤ nA. The internal region I,
whose thickness is s, has a refraction index that varies continuously from nA to
nB as x1 varies from the A-I interface to the I-B interface. Applying the solution
of problem 5.1 to this case shows that nA sin #A D const everywhere in region A,
hence the ray is a straight line there; similarly it is nB sin #B D const everywhere in
region B, with the same constant. It follows
nB sin #B D nA sin #A :
Unless #A D 0, the position of the ray along the x0
2 axis at the I-B interface is
different from that at the A-I interface; if, however, s is made to vanish, the position
becomes the same, thus yielding the Descartes law of refraction: the ray crossing
an interface between two media is continuous, whereas its slopes on the two sides
of the interface fulﬁll the relation above. The result still holds in the cases where
the interface between the two media is not planar, provided its curvature is small
enough to make Geometrical Optics applicable.

Problems of Chap. 8
8.1 Consider the homogeneous equation associated with (8.76), g00Ca g0Cb g D 0,
and let f D g h and u D h0; this splits (8.76) into the system
g00 C a g0 C b g D 0 ;
g u0 C .2 g0 C a g/ u D c :
If g is known, then u is found by integrating a ﬁrst-order equation, whence f D
g
R
u d. To ﬁnd g one lets A.x/ D
R
a d, g D exp.A=2/ w, thus transforming the
homogeneous equation for g into
w00 C q w D 0 ;
q D b  a2=4  a0=2 ;
which is a time-independent Schrödinger equation.
8.2 As both w1 and w2 are solutions corresponding to the same eigenvalue, it is
w00
1Cq w1 D 0 and w00
2Cq w2 D 0. Multiply the ﬁrst one by w2, the second one by w1,
and subtract; this yields w2 w00
1 D w1 w00
2. The latter is recast as .w2 w0

namely

D dW
dx D 0 ;
W D const,
with W the Wronskian. As shown in Sect. A.12, the condition W D 0 is necessary
for the linear dependence of w1, w2; as a consequence, the condition W ¤ 0 is
sufﬁcient for the linear independence of w1, w2. The calculation carried out in this
problem does not tell whether the constant is zero or not; to discriminate between
the two cases, one must add some prescription on the solutions (an example is given
in Prob. 8.3).
8.3 The procedure shown here is used also in Sect. 11.4. As both w1 and w2 are
solutions corresponding to the same eigenvalue, it is w00
1 Cq w1 D 0 and w00
2 Cq w2 D
0. Letting w2 D v w1 in the latter yields v w00
1 C2 v0 w0
1 Cv00 w1 Cv q w1 D 0, where
the ﬁrst and last summands cancel each other due to the equation fulﬁlled by w1.
Thus, letting a be any point of I, the relation 2 v0 w0



where x belongs to I as well. Now, if it were v0.a/ D 0, it would be w2 D v.a/ w1,
that is, the two solutions would be linearly dependent in contrast to the hypothesis. It
follows that v0.a/ ¤ 0 and, as a consequence, v is monotonic in I because w1.a/ ¤ 0
and the integrand 1=w2
1 is positive. Given these premises, it is found by inspection
that w2 D v w1 fulﬁlls w00
2 C q w2 D 0. The Wronskian of the two solutions w1, w2
(Sect. A.12) reads W D w1 w0

By way of example, in the case of a free particle (Sect. 8.2.1) one of the two
solutions of (8.1) can be written as w1 D cos.k x/; then, letting I 	 Œ=4; C=4
and a D 0 it follows v D v.0/ C v0.0/ tan.k x/=k. Although this is not relevant
for the reasoning here, one may note that w1 is a fundamental solution (Sect. 11.4);
in order to make w2 a fundamental solution as well, one lets v.0/ D 0, v0.0/ D 1
to ﬁnd w2 D v w1 D sin.k x/=k. The two solutions are linearly independent, and
W D 1.
As a second example, consider the case of the energy well of Sect. 11.5; as shown
in (11.47), one of the two solutions in the left region (x < 0) is w1 D exp.˛ x/.
Letting I 	 .1; 0 and a D 0 one ﬁnds v D v.0/Cv0.0/ exp.˛ x/ sinh.˛ x/=˛;
thus, w2 D v.0/ exp.˛ x/ C v0.0/ sinh.˛ x/=˛. If v0.0/ ¤ 0, such a solution
is linearly independent from w1; however, as sinh.˛ x/ diverges for x ! 1,
the result is not acceptable from a physical point of view: one must then let
v0.0/ D 0 which, however, renders w2 D v.0/ w1. Thus, imposing the additional
prescription that w2 should not diverge makes the two solutions linearly dependent,
whence W D 0.
8.4 Let w1 be the eigenfunction corresponding to E, namely, w1 fulﬁlls the equation
w00
1.x/Cq.x/ w1.x/ D 0. It follows that w00
1.x/Cq.x/ w1.x/ D 0 also holds. On
the other hand, if V is even, q is also even; as a consequence,
w00
1.x/ C q.x/ w1.x/ D 0
is fulﬁlled with the same eigenvalue. Being the latter simple, it must be w1.x/ D
a w1.x/, with a some nonvanishing constant. As this relation holds for any x,
one may replace x with x to ﬁnd w1.x/ D a w1.x/; multiplying by a both
sides of the latter yields a2 w1.x/ D a w1.x/ D w1.x/, whence a D ˙1 and
w1.x/ D ˙w1.x/. An example of this property is found from the analysis of the
linear harmonic oscillator (Sect. 12.2).

15.2 From the qualitative standpoint one may discuss the problem by remembering
that, from the ﬁndings of Sect. C.4, P.E/  1=2 is odd with respect to E  EF; as a
consequence, a decrease in the occupation probability produced, by a temperature
change, at E D EF  E, corresponds to a probability increase by the same
amount at E D EF C E. If it were g.E/ D const, a number of particles
would relocate from one side of EF to the other. However, g.E/ is not constant
in general; it follows that the number of states available on the two sides of EF is
not the same and, when temperature changes, EF must shift in order to compensate
for this.
From the quantitative standpoint, and for the conditions speciﬁed by the problem,
one may let E1 D 0 and EU ! 1 in the ﬁrst relation of (15.48). This yields [70]

Collecting the results yields NS ' G.EF/ C .2=6/ g0.EF/ .kB T/2. As expected,
the relation between EF and T depends on the form of the density of states g:
if it were g0 D 0, EF would not depend on temperature. Note that the integral
involving the third derivative of G also vanishes, still because the integrand is odd;
it follows that the ﬁrst term left out in this approximation is of the fourth order
in E  EF. In the T ! 0 limit the above relation becomes NS ' G.EF0/, with

15.3 Object of the combinatorial problem is placing Nr particles, not subjected to
the exclusion principle, into gr states. The particles are not distinguishable. Since
the exclusion principle does not apply, both cases gr  Nr and gr < Nr are possible.
They are considered below, with the aid of tables whose columns are labeled by
numbers that refer to the particles; the entries of each line are letters that indicate
1In principle, the statement would be correct if the integral was started from 1. It is
approximately true due to the condition P.E D 0/ ' 1.

the states. The left table shows the placement of two particles, labeled 1 and 2, into
three states, labeled A, B, and C; in the right table, four particles, labeled from 1 to

The state labels may be repeated within the same line because the exclusion
principle does not apply; e.g., the ﬁrst line of the left table shows that in this
placement both particles 1 and 2 belong to state A. In each line the state labels
are ordered in ascending order because, due to indistinguishability, permutations
of these labels do not introduce new placements. It is found by inspection that the
number of placements (lines) of each table equals the number Ck
n of k-combinations
with repetitions of n objects, where n D gr is the number of states and k D Nr is the
number of particles. In particular it is C1
n D n.
To ﬁnd Ck
n it is necessary to determine its relation with Ck1
n
. To this purpose,
one starts from the total number of states k Ck
n appearing in the table, and observes
that each state appears the same number of times; thus, the number of appearances
of single state, say, A, is k Ck
n=n. Now, one selects in the table only the placements
where state A appears, and suppresses A once in each placement; this yields the .k
1/-combinations of n elements, whose number is Ck1
n
. The number of appearances
of A in the latter is, by the same token, .k1/ Ck1
n
=n; as a consequence, the number
of appearances of A in the original table (before suppression) can be calculated in
an alternative way as

18.1 The derivation of (18.21) follows the same line as that of (15.49). The starting
point is determining the number of way of placing the electrons into the available
states, subjected to the constraints of exclusion and indistinguishability. The states
of the bands are the same as for an undoped semiconductor; for such states the
number of placements W D W1 W2 : : : Wr : : : still applies, where Wr is the number
of ways in which Nr particles can be placed into the gr states of the rth energy
interval; its value is given by (15.43). In a doped semiconductor one must then
consider the additional states associated with the dopants. Considering an n-doped
semiconductor where a constant concentration ND of donors is present, the total
number of donor atoms is KD D  ND, with  the volume of the crystal. In each
donor atom, the states able to accommodate the electron are those not involved in the
formation of the covalent bonds with the semiconductor atoms; thus, if the available
orbitals are fD, the available states are dD D 2 fD due to spin.
Given these premises, to the placements W considered above one must add
the placements of a number of electrons, say, kD, into the donor atoms; the latter
counting, however, must be carried out differently: in each group of dD states it is
possible in fact to accommodate one electron at most, while in each group of gr
states of the bands it is possible to accommodate more than one electron. Let WD
be the number of ways to place kD electrons into the KD groups of states, with the
provision that at most one electron can be placed into each group (kD  KD), and
that a given group has dD states able to accommodate the electron. If it were dD D 1,
the outcome would be W0
D D KDŠ=ŒkDŠ .KD  kD/Š; in fact, the counting would be
identical to that leading to (15.49). As dD > 1, there are dD ways to place the ﬁrst
electron into one of the dopant atoms; for each of the above placements, there are dD
to place the second electron into another atom, and so on. In conclusion one ﬁnds

equation is coupled with the relation e C h D EG=.kB T/ to form a system in the
two unknowns e, h, the solution determines the position of EF C q '.C1/ with
respect to the band edges EC and EV in the n region, at a given temperature T > 0

where A D .EA  EV/=.kB T/ > 0 is the normalized distance between the ground

the relation e C h D EG=.kB T/, again forms a system in the two unknowns e,
h, whose solution determines this time the position of EF C q '.1/ with respect
to the band edges EC and EV in the p region, at a given temperature T > 0 and
acceptor concentration NA. The built-in potential is then found from

Due to the presence of the Fermi integrals, the charge-neutrality equations cannot
be solved analytically as they stand. The approximating expressions for the Fermi
integrals shown in Sect. C.13 ease the calculation somewhat.

22.6 Let 0  Vin  VTn: the current is zero at A and in the region to the left of A; the
corresponding output voltage is VSS. As Vin increases from VTn to Vsat

the expression of this part of the curve is worked out in Prob. 22.4. Similarly, let

the corresponding output voltage is zero. As Vin decreases from VSS  VTp to Vsat

the current grows from 0 to QIsat and Vout increases from zero (point D) to Vsat

Problems of Chap. 25
25.1 As the problem is independent of time it is E D  grad '. At any point along
the boundary of D, let n be the unit vector normal to the boundary and pointing
inwards, and t the tangent unit vector such that k D t ^ n, with k the unit vector
of the z axis. Due to the steady-state condition and the hypothesis that one type
of carriers prevail, it is div J D 0, with J the two-dimensional current ﬁeld whose
components Jx, Jy are deﬁned by (25.34). As the domain is simply connected, there
exist a function  .x; y/ such that J D rot. k/; thus, letting i, j be the unit vectors
of the x and y axes, it is
J D @ 
@y i  @ 
@x j ;
k ^ J D @ 
@y j C @ 
@x i D grad  :
Taking the divergence of the second equation above yields
r2 D k  rot J D @Jy
@x  @Jx
@y :

Solutions
Then, one differentiates the ﬁrst of (25.33) with respect to y, the second one with
respect to x, and subtracts the results using div J D 0; this provides

@Ey
@x  @Ex
@y

D @Jy
@x  @Jx
@y ;
where the term in parenthesis is the component of rot E along the z axis. On the
other hand, it is rot E D 0 due to the steady-state condition. Combining this with
the two equations above yields r2 D 0.
25.2 The triad of unit vectors k D t^n is considered here at any point belonging to
the interior of D or to its boundary; thus, t is not necessarily parallel to a boundary.
Starting from E D Et t C En n, letting  D H B, and observing that J ^ k  t D
J  k ^ t D J  n and J ^ k  n D J  k ^ n D J  t, the two-dimensional current
ﬁeld (25.33) is recast as
 Et D Jt C  Jn ;
 En D Jn   Jt :
Sufﬁxes t and n indicate the component along t or n. Another relation is found from
k ^ J D grad  , whence
k ^ J D @ 
@t t C @ 
@n n ;
Jt D @ 
@n ;
Jn D @ 
@t ;
where @ =@t and @ =@n indicate the derivative in the direction of t or n. The
boundary conditions for  are obtained from the above. Along a contact it is Et D 0,
whence Jt D  Jn; integrating the above along the ith contact,
h
Z
si
@ 
@n ds0 D  Ii ;
@ 
@n D  Ii
h si
;
where si, h are the contact’s length and thickness, s0 is the curvilinear abscissa along
the contact, and Ii the current through it. As n points inwards, the direction of Ii
is taken inwards as well. The second form of the above equation is due to the fact
that due to the smallness of the contact, Jn is uniformly distributed along it; such a
relation provides a nonhomogeneous Neumann condition for  along the contacts.
Along an insulating boundary it is Jn D 0, whence @ =@t D 0, En D  Et, and
Jt D  Et. This shows that  D const along an insulating boundary, corresponding
to a Dirichlet condition, yet unknown.2 Let  i1,  i be the values of  along two
insulating boundaries that are separated by the ith contact. Integrating @ =@t along
the contact yields
2Note that the boundary conditions of  are dual to those of the electric potential ': the latter is
an unknown constant along the contacts, whereas a mixed Neumann condition En D  Et holds
along the insulating boundaries, to be compared with Jt D  Jn.

From div J D 0 it also follows Pn

supplemented with the boundary conditions shown above, provides  apart from an
additive constant. Prescribing the value of  along one of the insulating boundaries,
e.g.,  0, ﬁxes the Dirichlet conditions along the other insulating boundaries. In this
way, the problem is completely deﬁned.
25.3 From the deﬁnitions of qn, kn, and n given in Sect. 25.5 one ﬁnds jn qnj 
4  I=.h H2 k2
n/ D 4  I=Œh 2 .2 nC1/2. Adding up over n and combining the result
with the relation P1
nD0.2 n C 1/2 D 2=8 [59] shows that the series (25.40) is
uniformly and absolutely convergent. This makes derivation and integration term-
by-term admissible. Differentiating (25.40) term-by-term with respect to y, letting
y D L=2, and using knH D .2 n C 1/  yield

The series above converges, but not absolutely; in order to prove that it is in fact the
derivative of Q one observes that, due to the boundary condition (25.39), the right-
hand side of the above equation must equal  I=.h H/. This is indeed true, thanks to
one of the possible series expansions of  valid in the interval 0  x=H  =2 [59].
As cosŒ.2 n C 1/ x=H is even, the expansion holds in the interval =2  x=H  0
as well.
25.4 The calculation is similar to that of Sect. 25.5.2. Taking by way of example
the side x D H=2, let yc be the distance of the probes from the x axis (Fig. 25.5).
The voltage drop sought is Vc D '.H=2; yc/  '.H=2; yc/. Combining the second
of (25.34) with  D P C Q, with (25.40) and (25.41), and with the results of
Prob. 25.1, yields

The term @Q=@x does not contribute to the integral because Q is odd with respect to
y; in turn, the term @Q=@y does not contribute because Q fulﬁlls the homogeneous
Dirichlet condition at x D H=2. The ratio Gc D I=Vc is the conductance measured
at the probes, whence  h D 2 ycGc=H; replacing the latter into the ﬁrst relation
of (25.45) yields

The last relation shows that, as anticipated in Sect. 25.5.1, the device thickness h
does not explicitly appear in the ﬁnal calculation. The same result would be found
if the product  h was measured by the van der Pauw method outlined in Sect. 25.7.
25.5 A fast calculation of S.y/ is accomplished by taking the interval 0  y  L=2,
introducing the ratio ! D H=L and the normalized coordinate  D y=L; letting ˛n D
