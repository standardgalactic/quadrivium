Numbers
Mathematics has its own language with numbers as the alphabet.
The language is given structure
with the aid of connective symbols, rules of operation, and a rigorous mode of thought (logic).
These
concepts, which previously were explored in elementary mathematics courses such as geometry, algebra,
and calculus, are reviewed in the following paragraphs.
SETS
Fundamental in mathematics is the concept of a set, class, or collection of objects having speciﬁed
characteristics.
For example, we speak of the set of all university professors, the set of all letters
A; B; C; D; . . . ; Z of the English alphabet, and so on.
The individual objects of the set are called
members or elements.
Any part of a set is called a subset of the given set, e.g., A, B, C is a subset of
A; B; C; D; . . . ; Z.
The set consisting of no elements is called the empty set or null set.
REAL NUMBERS
The following types of numbers are already familiar to the student:
1.
Natural numbers 1; 2; 3; 4; . . . ; also called positive integers, are used in counting members of a
set. The symbols varied with the times, e.g., the Romans used I, II, III, IV, . . . The sum a þ b
and product a  b or ab of any two natural numbers a and b is also a natural number.
This is
often expressed by saying that the set of natural numbers is closed under the operations of
addition and multiplication, or satisﬁes the closure property with respect to these operations.
2.
Negative integers and zero denoted by 1; 2; 3; . . . and 0, respectively, arose to permit solu-
tions of equations such as x þ b ¼ a, where a and b are any natural numbers.
This leads to the
operation of subtraction, or inverse of addition, and we write x ¼ a  b.
The set of positive and negative integers and zero is called the set of integers.
3.
Rational numbers or fractions such as 2
3,  5
4, . . . arose to permit solutions of equations such as
bx ¼ a for all integers a and b, where b 6¼ 0. This leads to the operation of division, or inverse of
multiplication, and we write x ¼ a=b or a  b where a is the numerator and b the denominator.
The set of integers is a subset of the rational numbers, since integers correspond to rational
numbers where b ¼ 1.
4.
Irrational numbers such as
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
and  are numbers which are not rational, i.e., they cannot be
expressed as a=b (called the quotient of a and b), where a and b are integers and b 6¼ 0.
The set of rational and irrational numbers is called the set of real numbers.

DECIMAL REPRESENTATION OF REAL NUMBERS
Any
real
number
can
be
expressed
in
decimal
form,
e.g.,
17=10 ¼ 1:7,
9=100 ¼ 0:09,
1=6 ¼ 0:16666 . . . .
In the case of a rational number the decimal exapnsion either terminates, or if it
does not terminate, one or a group of digits in the expansion will ultimately repeat, as for example, in
1
7 ¼ 0:142857 142857 142 . . . .
In the case of an irrational number such as
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
¼ 1:41423 . . . or
 ¼ 3:14159 . . . no such repetition can occur. We can always consider a decimal expansion as unending,
e.g., 1.375 is the same as 1.37500000 . . . or 1.3749999 . . . .
To indicate recurring decimals we some-
times place dots over the repeating cycle of digits, e.g., 1
7 ¼ 0:_1_4_2_8_5_7, 19
6 ¼ 3:1_6.
The decimal system uses the ten digits 0; 1; 2; . . . ; 9.
(These symbols were the gift of the Hindus.
They were in use in India by 600 A.D. and then in ensuing centuries were transmitted to the western world
by Arab traders.)
It is possible to design number systems with fewer or more digits, e.g. the binary
system uses only two digits 0 and 1 (see Problems 32 and 33).
GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF REAL NUMBERS
The geometric representation of real numbers as points on a line called the real axis, as in the ﬁgure
below, is also well known to the student.
For each real number there corresponds one and only one
point on the line and conversely, i.e., there is a one-to-one (see Fig. 1-1) correspondence between the set of
real numbers and the set of points on the line.
Because of this we often use point and number
interchangeably.
(The interchangeability of point and number is by no means self-evident; in fact, axioms supporting
the relation of geometry and numbers are necessary.
The Cantor–Dedekind Theorem is fundamental.)
The set of real numbers to the right of 0 is called the set of positive numbers; the set to the left of 0 is
the set of negative numbers, while 0 itself is neither positive nor negative.
(Both the horizontal position of the line and the placement of positive and negative numbers to the
right and left, respectively, are conventions.)
Between any two rational numbers (or irrational numbers) on the line there are inﬁnitely many
rational (and irrational) numbers.
This leads us to call the set of rational (or irrational) numbers an
everywhere dense set.

For any a there is a number x in R such that x þ a ¼ 0.
x is called the inverse of a with respect to addition and is denoted by a.
9.
For any a 6¼ 0 there is a number x in R such that ax ¼ 1.
x is called the inverse of a with respect to multiplication and is denoted by a1 or 1=a.
Convention: For convenience,
operations called subtraction
and division are deﬁned by
a  b ¼ a þ ðbÞ and a
b ¼ ab1, respectively.
These enable us to operate according to the usual rules of algebra.
In general any set, such as R,
whose members satisfy the above is called a ﬁeld.
INEQUALITIES
If a  b is a nonnegative number, we say that a is greater than or equal to b or b is less than or equal to
a, and write, respectively, a A b or b % a.
If there is no possibility that a ¼ b, we write a > b or b < a.
Geometrically, a > b if the point on the real axis corresponding to a lies to the right of the point
corresponding to b.
EXAMPLES.
3 < 5 or 5 > 3; 2 < 1 or 1 > 2; x @ 3 means that x is a real number which may be 3 or less
than 3.
If a, b; and c are any given real numbers, then:
1.
Either a > b, a ¼ b or a < b
Law of trichotomy
2.
If a > b and b > c, then a > c
Law of transitivity
3.
If a > b, then a þ c > b þ c
4.
If a > b and c > 0, then ac > bc
5.
If a > b and c < 0, then ac < bc
ABSOLUTE VALUE OF REAL NUMBERS
The absolute value of a real number a, denoted by jaj, is deﬁned as a if a > 0, a if a < 0, and 0 if
a ¼ 0.
EXAMPLES.
j  5j ¼ 5, j þ 2j ¼ 2, j  3

3.

The distance between any two points (real numbers) a and b on the real axis is ja  bj ¼ jb  aj.
EXPONENTS AND ROOTS
The product a  a . . . a of a real number a by itself p times is denoted by a p, where p is called the
exponent and a is called the base.
The following rules hold:
1.
a p  aq ¼ a pþq

2.

aq ¼ a pq

These and extensions to any real numbers are possible so long as division by zero is excluded.
In
particular, by using 2, with p ¼ q and p ¼ 0, respectively, we are lead to the deﬁnitions a0 ¼ 1,
aq ¼ 1=aq.
If a p ¼ N, where p is a positive integer, we call a a pth root of N written
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
pp
.
There may be more
than one real pth root of N. For example, since 22 ¼ 4 and ð2Þ2 ¼ 4, there are two real square roots of
4, namely 2 and 2.
For square roots it is customary to deﬁne
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
as positive, thus
ﬃﬃﬃ
4
p
¼ 2 and then

ﬃﬃﬃ
4
p
¼ 2.
If p and q are positive integers, we deﬁne a p=q ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a p
qp
.
LOGARITHMS
If a p ¼ N, p is called the logarithm of N to the base a, written p ¼ loga N.
If a and N are positive
and a 6¼ 1, there is only one real value for p.
The following rules hold:
1.
loga MN ¼ loga M þ loga N
2. loga
M
N ¼ loga M  loga N
3.
loga Mr ¼ r loga M
In practice, two bases are used, base a ¼ 10, and the natural base a ¼ e ¼ 2:71828 . . . .
The logarithmic
systems associated with these bases are called common and natural, respectively.
The common loga-
rithm system is signiﬁed by log N, i.e., the subscript 10 is not used.
For natural logarithms the usual
notation is ln N.
Common logarithms (base 10) traditionally have been used for computation.
Their application
replaces multiplication with addition and powers with multiplication.
In the age of calculators and
computers, this process is outmoded; however, common logarithms remain useful in theory and
application.
For example, the Richter scale used to measure the intensity of earthquakes is a logarith-
mic scale.
Natural logarithms were introduced to simplify formulas in calculus, and they remain
eﬀective for this purpose.
AXIOMATIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM
The number system can be built up logically, starting from a basic set of axioms or ‘‘self-evident’’
truths, usually taken from experience, such as statements 1–9, Page 2.
If we assume as given the natural numbers and the operations of addition and multiplication
(although it is possible to start even further back with the concept of sets), we ﬁnd that statements 1
through 6, Page 2, with R as the set of natural numbers, hold, while 7 through 9 do not hold.
Taking 7 and 8 as additional requirements, we introduce the numbers 1; 2; 3; . . . and 0.
Then
by taking 9 we introduce the rational numbers.
Operations with these newly obtained numbers can be deﬁned by adopting axioms 1 through 6,
where R is now the set of integers. These lead to proofs of statements such as ð2Þð3Þ ¼ 6, ð4Þ ¼ 4,
ð0Þð5Þ ¼ 0, and so on, which are usually taken for granted in elementary mathematics.
We can also introduce the concept of order or inequality for integers, and from these inequalities for
rational numbers.
For example, if a, b, c, d are positive integers, we deﬁne a=b > c=d if and only if
ad > bc, with similar extensions to negative integers.
Once we have the set of rational numbers and the rules of inequality concerning them, we can order
them geometrically as points on the real axis, as already indicated.
We can then show that there are
points on the line which do not represent rational numbers (such as
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
, , etc.).
These irrational
numbers can be deﬁned in various ways, one of which uses the idea of Dedekind cuts (see Problem 1.34).
From this we can show that the usual rules of algebra apply to irrational numbers and that no further
real numbers are possible.

POINT SETS, INTERVALS
A set of points (real numbers) located on the real axis is called a one-dimensional point set.
The set of points x such that a @ x @ b is called a closed interval and is denoted by ½a; b.
The set
a < x < b is called an open interval, denoted by ða; bÞ.
The sets a < x @ b and a @ x < b, denoted by
ða; b and ½a; bÞ, respectively, are called half open or half closed intervals.
The symbol x, which can represent any number or point of a set, is called a variable.
The given
numbers a or b are called constants.
Letters were introduced to construct algebraic formulas around 1600.
Not long thereafter, the
philosopher-mathematician Rene Descartes suggested that the letters at the end of the alphabet be used
to represent variables and those at the beginning to represent constants. This was such a good idea that
it remains the custom.
EXAMPLE.
The set of all x such that jxj < 4, i.e., 4 < x < 4, is represented by ð4; 4Þ, an open interval.
The set x > a can also be represented by a < x < 1.
Such a set is called an inﬁnite or unbounded
interval.
Similarly, 1 < x < 1 represents all real numbers x.
COUNTABILITY
A set is called countable or denumerable if its elements can be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the
natural numbers.
EXAMPLE.
The even natural numbers 2; 4; 6; 8; . . . is a countable set because of the 1-1 correspondence shown.

A set is inﬁnite if it can be placed in 1-1 correspondence with a subset of itself. An inﬁnite set which
is countable is called countable inﬁnite.
The set of rational numbers is countable inﬁnite, while the set of irrational numbers or all real
numbers is non-countably inﬁnite (see Problems 1.17 through 1.20).
The number of elements in a set is called its cardinal number.
A set which is countably inﬁnite is
assigned the cardinal number Fo (the Hebrew letter aleph-null).
The set of real numbers (or any sets
which can be placed into 1-1 correspondence with this set) is given the cardinal number C, called the
cardinality of the continuuum.
NEIGHBORHOODS
The set of all points x such that jx  aj <  where  > 0, is called a  neighborhood of the point a.
The set of all points x such that 0 < jx  aj <  in which x ¼ a is excluded, is called a deleted 
neighborhood of a or an open ball of radius  about a.
LIMIT POINTS
A limit point, point of accumulation, or cluster point of a set of numbers is a  number l such that
every deleted  neighborhood of l contains members of the set; that is, no matter how small the radius of
a ball about l there are points of the set within it.
In other words for any  > 0, however small, we can
always ﬁnd a member x of the set which is not equal to l but which is such that jx  lj < .
By
considering smaller and smaller values of  we see that there must be inﬁnitely many such values of x.
A ﬁnite set cannot have a limit point.
An inﬁnite set may or may not have a limit point.
Thus the
natural numbers have no limit point while the set of rational numbers has inﬁnitely many limit points.
CHAP. 1]
NUMBERS

A set containing all its limit points is called a closed set. The set of rational numbers is not a closed
set since, for example, the limit point
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
is not a member of the set (Problem 1.5).
However, the set of
all real numbers x such that 0 @ x @ 1 is a closed set.
BOUNDS
If for all numbers x of a set there is a number M such that x @ M, the set is bounded above and M is
called an upper bound. Similarly if x A m, the set is bounded below and m is called a lower bound. If for
all x we have m @ x @ M, the set is called bounded.
If M is a number such that no member of the set is greater than M but there is at least one member
which exceeds M   for every  > 0, then M is called the least upper bound (l.u.b.) of the set.
Similarly
if no member of the set is smaller than m but at least one member is smaller than m þ  for every  > 0,
then m is called the greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) of the set.
BOLZANO–WEIERSTRASS THEOREM
The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem states that every bounded inﬁnite set has at least one limit point.
A proof of this is given in Problem 2.23, Chapter 2.
ALGEBRAIC AND TRANSCENDENTAL NUMBERS
A number x which is a solution to the polynomial equation
a0xn þ a1xn1 þ a2xn2 þ    þ an1x þ an ¼ 0
ð1Þ
where a0 6¼ 0, a1; a2; . . . ; an are integers and n is a positive integer, called the degree of the equation, is
called an algebraic number.
A number which cannot be expressed as a solution of any polynomial
equation with integer coeﬃcients is called a transcendental number.
EXAMPLES.
2
3 and
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
which are solutions of 3x  2 ¼ 0 and x2  2 ¼ 0, respectively, are algebraic numbers.
The numbers  and e can be shown to be transcendental numbers.
Mathematicians have yet to
determine whether some numbers such as e or e þ  are algebraic or not.
The set of algebraic numbers is a countably inﬁnite set (see Problem 1.23), but the set of transcen-
dental numbers is non-countably inﬁnite.
THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM
Equations such as x2 þ 1 ¼ 0 have no solution within the real number system.
Because these
equations were found to have a meaningful place in the mathematical structures being built, various
mathematicians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries developed an extended system of
numbers in which there were solutions.
The new system became known as the complex number system.
It includes the real number system as a subset.
We can consider a complex number as having the form a þ bi, where a and b are real numbers called
the real and imaginary parts, and i ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
is called the imaginary unit.
Two complex numbers a þ bi
and c þ di are equal if and only if a ¼ c and b ¼ d.
We can consider real numbers as a subset of the set
of complex numbers with b ¼ 0.
The complex number 0 þ 0i corresponds to the real number 0.
The absolute value or modulus of a þ bi is deﬁned as ja þ bij ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a2 þ b2
p
.
The complex conjugate of
a þ bi is deﬁned as a  bi. The complex conjugate of the complex number z is often indicated by z or z.
The set of complex numbers obeys rules 1 through 9 of Page 2, and thus constitutes a ﬁeld.
In
performing operations with complex numbers, we can operate as in the algebra of real numbers, replac-
ing i2 by 1 when it occurs.
Inequalities for complex numbers are not deﬁned.

NUMBERS
[CHAP. 1

From the point of view of an axiomatic foundation of complex numbers, it is desirable to treat a
complex number as an ordered pair ða; bÞ of real numbers a and b subject to certain operational rules
which turn out to be equivalent to those above.
For example, we deﬁne ða; bÞ þ ðc; dÞ ¼ ða þ c; b þ dÞ,
ða; bÞðc; dÞ ¼ ðac  bd; ad þ bcÞ, mða; bÞ ¼ ðma; mbÞ, and so on.
We then ﬁnd that ða; bÞ ¼ að1; 0Þ þ
bð0; 1Þ and we associate this with a þ bi, where i is the symbol for ð0; 1Þ.
POLAR FORM OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
If real scales are chosen on two mutually perpendicular axes X 0OX and Y 0OY (the x and y axes) as
in Fig. 1-2 below, we can locate any point in the plane determined by these lines by the ordered pair of
numbers ðx; yÞ called rectangular coordinates of the point.
Examples of the location of such points are
indicated by P, Q, R, S, and T in Fig. 1-2.
Since a complex number x þ iy can be considered as an ordered pair ðx; yÞ, we can represent such
numbers by points in an xy plane called the complex plane or Argand diagram.
Referring to Fig. 1-3
above we see that x ¼  cos , y ¼  sin  where  ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ y2
p
¼ jx þ iyj and , called the amplitude or
argument, is the angle which line OP makes with the positive x axis OX.
It follows that
z ¼ x þ iy ¼ ðcos  þ i sin Þ
ð2Þ
called the polar form of the complex number, where  and  are called polar coordintes.
It is sometimes
convenient to write cis  instead of cos  þ i sin .
If z1 ¼ x1 þ iyi ¼ 1ðcos 1 þ i sin 1Þ and z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 ¼ 2ðcos 2 þ i sin 2Þ
and by using the
addition formulas for sine and cosine, we can show that

MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
The principle of mathematical induction is an important property of the positive integers.
It is
especially useful in proving statements involving all positive integers when it is known for example that
the statements are valid for n ¼ 1; 2; 3 but it is suspected or conjectured that they hold for all positive
integers.
The method of proof consists of the following steps:
1.
Prove the statement for n ¼ 1 (or some other positive integer).
2.
Assume the statement true for n ¼ k; where k is any positive integer.
3.
From the assumption in 2 prove that the statement must be true for n ¼ k þ 1.
This is part of
the proof establishing the induction and may be diﬃcult or impossible.
4.
Since the statement is true for n ¼ 1 [from step 1] it must [from step 3] be true for n ¼ 1 þ 1 ¼ 2
and from this for n ¼ 2 þ 1 ¼ 3, and so on, and so must be true for all positive integers.
(This
assumption, which provides the link for the truth of a statement for a ﬁnite number of cases to
the truth of that statement for the inﬁnite set, is called ‘‘The Axiom of Mathematical Induc-
tion.’’)

0 as numbers.
(a)
If we deﬁne a=b as that number (if it exists) such that bx ¼ a, then 0=0 is that number x such that
0x ¼ 0.
However, this is true for all numbers.
Since there is no unique number which 0/0 can
represent, we consider it undeﬁned.
(b)
As in (a), if we deﬁne 1/0 as that number x (if it exists) such that 0x ¼ 1, we conclude that there is no
such number.
Because of these facts we must look upon division by zero as meaningless.

For x ¼ 3 the given fraction is undeﬁned.
RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL NUMBERS
1.4.
Prove that the square of any odd integer is odd.
Any odd integer has the form 2m þ 1. Since ð2m þ 1Þ2 ¼ 4m2 þ 4m þ 1 is 1 more than the even integer
4m2 þ 4m ¼ 2ð2m2 þ 2mÞ, the result follows.
1.5.
Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 2.
Let p=q be a rational number whose square is 2, where we assume that p=q is in lowest terms, i.e., p and q
have no common integer factors except 1 (we sometimes call such integers relatively prime).
Then ðp=qÞ2 ¼ 2, p2 ¼ 2q2 and p2 is even. From Problem 1.4, p is even since if p were odd, p2 would be
odd.
Thus p ¼ 2m:
Substituting p ¼ 2m in p2 ¼ 2q2 yields q2 ¼ 2m2, so that q2 is even and q is even.
Thus p and q have the common factor 2, contradicting the original assumption that they had no
common factors other than 1.
By virtue of this contradiction there can be no rational number whose
square is 2.
1.6.
Show how to ﬁnd rational numbers whose squares can be arbitrarily close to 2.
We restrict ourselves to positive rational numbers.
Since ð1Þ2 ¼ 1 and ð2Þ2 ¼ 4, we are led to choose
rational numbers between 1 and 2, e.g., 1:1; 1:2; 1:3; . . . ; 1:9.
Since ð1:4Þ2 ¼ 1:96 and ð1:5Þ2 ¼ 2:25, we consider rational numbers between 1.4 and 1.5, e.g.,
1:41; 1:42; . . . ; 1:49:
Continuing in this manner we can obtain closer and closer rational approximations, e.g. ð1:414213562Þ2
is less than 2 while ð1:414213563Þ2 is greater than 2.
1.7.
Given the equation a0xn þ a1xn1 þ    þ an ¼ 0, where a0; a1; . . . ; an are integers and a0 and
an 6¼ 0.
Show that if the equation is to have a rational root p=q, then p must divide an and q
must divide a0 exactly.
Since p=q is a root we have, on substituting in the given equation and multiplying by qn, the result
a0pn þ a1pn1q þ a2pn2q2 þ    þ an1pqn1 þ anqn ¼ 0
ð1Þ
or dividing by p,
a0pn1 þ a1pn2q þ    þ an1qn1 ¼  anqn
p
ð2Þ
Since the left side of (2) is an integer, the right side must also be an integer. Then since p and q are relatively
prime, p does not divide qn exactly and so must divide an.
In a similar manner, by transposing the ﬁrst term of (1) and dividing by q, we can show that q must
divide a0.

1.9.
Prove that between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.
The set of rational numbers is closed under the operations of addition and division (non-zero
denominator).
Therefore, a þ b
2
is rational.
The next step is to guarantee that this value is between a
and b.
To this purpose, assume a < b.
(The proof would proceed similarly under the assumption b < a.)
Then 2a < a þ b, thus a < a þ b
2
and a þ b < 2b, therefore a þ b
2
< b.
INEQUALITIES
1.10.
For what values of x is x þ 3ð2  xÞ A 4  x?
x þ 3ð2  xÞ A 4  x when x þ 6  3x A 4  x, 6  2x A 4  x, 6  4 A 2x  x, 2 A x, i.e. x @ 2.
1.11.
For what values of x is x2  3x  2 < 10  2x?
The required inequality holds when
x2  3x  2  10 þ 2x < 0;
x2  x  12 < 0
or
ðx  4Þðx þ 3Þ < 0
This last inequality holds only in the following cases.
Case 1: x  4 > 0 and x þ 3 < 0, i.e., x > 4 and x < 3.
This is impossible, since x cannot be both greater
than 4 and less than 3.
Case 2: x  4 < 0 and x þ 3 > 0, i.e. x < 4 and x > 3.
This is possible when 3 < x < 4.
Thus the
inequality holds for the set of all x such that 3 < x < 4.
1.12.
If a A 0 and b A 0, prove that 1
2 ða þ bÞ A

ab

.
The statement is self-evident in the following cases
(1) a ¼ b, and (2) either or both of a and b zero.
For both a and b positive and a 6¼ b, the proof is by contradiction.
Assume to the contrary of the supposition that 1
2 ða þ bÞ <
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ab
p
then 1
4 ða2 þ 2ab þ b2Þ < ab.
That is, a2  2ab þ b2 ¼ ða  bÞ2 < 0.
Since the left member of this equation is a square, it cannot be
less than zero, as is indicated.
Having reached this contradiction, we may conclude that our assumption is
incorrect and that the original assertion is true.

Write all fractions with denominator 2, then 3; . . . considering equivalent fractions such as 1
2 ; 2
4 ; 3
6 ; . . . no
more than once.
Then the 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers can be accomplished as follows:

(see Page 5).
1.18.
If A and B are two countable sets, prove that the set consisting of all elements from A or B (or
both) is also countable.
Since A is countable, there is a 1-1 correspondence between elements of A and the natural numbers so
that we can denote these elements by a1; a2; a3; . . . .
Similarly, we can denote the elements of B by b1; b2; b3; . . . .
Case 1: Suppose elements of A are all distinct from elements of B.
Then the set consisting of elements from
A or B is countable, since we can establish the following 1-1 correspondence.

Case 2: If some elements of A and B are the same, we count them only once as in Problem 1.17. Then the set
of elements belonging to A or B (or both) is countable.
The set consisting of all elements which belong to A or B (or both) is often called the union of A and B,
denoted by A [ B or A þ B.
The set consisting of all elements which are contained in both A and B is called the intersection of A and
B, denoted by A \ B or AB.
If A and B are countable, so is A \ B.
The set consisting of all elements in A but not in B is written A  B.
If we let B be the set of elements
which are not in B, we can also write A  B ¼ A B.
If A and B are countable, so is A  B.
1.19.
Prove that the set of all positive rational numbers is countable.
Consider all rational numbers x > 1.
With each such rational number we can associate one and only
one rational number 1=x in ð0; 1Þ, i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between all rational numbers > 1
and all rational numbers in ð0; 1Þ. Since these last are countable by Problem 1.17, it follows that the set of all
rational numbers > 1 is also countable.
From Problem 1.18 it then follows that the set consisting of all positive rational numbers is countable,
since this is composed of the two countable sets of rationals between 0 and 1 and those greater than or equal
to 1.
From this we can show that the set of all rational numbers is countable (see Problem 1.59).
1.20.
Prove that the set of all real numbers in ½0; 1 is non-countable.
Every real number in ½0; 1 has a decimal expansion :a1a2a3 . . . where a1; a2; . . . are any of the digits
0; 1; 2; . . . ; 9.
We assume that numbers whose decimal expansions terminate such as 0.7324 are written 0:73240000 . . .
and that this is the same as 0:73239999 . . . .
If all real numbers in ½0; 1 are countable we can place them in 1-1 correspondence with the natural
numbers as in the following list:
1
2
3
..
.
$
$
$
0:a11a12a13a14 . . .
0:a21a22a23a24 . . .
0:a31a32a33a34 . . .
..
.
We now form a number
0:b1b2b3b4 . . .
where b1 6¼ a11; b2 6¼ a22; b3 6¼ a33; b4 6¼ a44; . . . and where all b’s beyond some position are not all 9’s.
This number, which is in ½0; 1 is diﬀerent from all numbers in the above list and is thus not in the list,
contradicting the assumption that all numbers in ½0; 1 were included.
Because of this contradiction it follows that the real numbers in ½0; 1 cannot be placed in 1-1 corre-
spondence with the natural numbers, i.e., the set of real numbers in ½0; 1 is non-countable.
LIMIT POINTS, BOUNDS, BOLZANO–WEIERSTRASS THEOREM
1.21.
(a) Prove that the inﬁnite sets of numbers 1; 1
2 ; 1
3 ; 1
4 ; . . . is bounded.
(b) Determine the least
upper bound (l.u.b.) and greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) of the set.
(c) Prove that 0 is a limit point
of the set.
(d) Is the set a closed set?
(e) How does this set illustrate the Bolzano–Weierstrass
theorem?
(a)
Since all members of the set are less than 2 and greater than 1 (for example), the set is bounded; 2 is an
upper bound, 1 is a lower bound.
We can ﬁnd smaller upper bounds (e.g., 3
2) and larger lower bounds (e.g.,  1
2).
12
NUMBERS
[CHAP. 1

(b)
Since no member of the set is greater than 1 and since there is at least one member of the set (namely 1)
which exceeds 1   for every positive number , we see that 1 is the l.u.b. of the set.
Since no member of the set is less than 0 and since there is at least one member of the set which is
less than 0 þ  for every positive  (we can always choose for this purpose the number 1=n where n is a
positive integer greater than 1=), we see that 0 is the g.l.b. of the set.
(c)
Let x be any member of the set.
Since we can always ﬁnd a number x such that 0 < jxj <  for any
positive number  (e.g. we can always pick x to be the number 1=n where n is a positive integer greater
than 1=), we see that 0 is a limit point of the set.
To put this another way, we see that any deleted 
neighborhood of 0 always includes members of the set, no matter how small we take  > 0.
(d)
The set is not a closed set since the limit point 0 does not belong to the given set.
(e)
Since the set is bounded and inﬁnite it must, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, have at least one
limit point.
We have found this to be the case, so that the theorem is illustrated.

Let P ¼ ja0j þ ja1j þ    þ janj þ n.

Write all algebraic numbers corresponding to P ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4; . . . avoiding repetitions. Thus, all algebraic

The statement is true for n ¼ 1 since 12 ¼ 1

Assume the statement true for n ¼ k.
Then
12 þ 22 þ 32 þ    þ k2 ¼ 1
6 kðk þ 1Þð2k þ 1Þ
Adding ðk þ 1Þ2 to both sides,
12 þ 22 þ 32 þ    þ k2 þ ðk þ 1Þ2 ¼ 1

¼ 1
6 ðk þ 1Þð2k2 þ 7k þ 6Þ ¼ 1
6 ðk þ 1Þðk þ 2Þð2k þ 3Þ
which shows that the statement is true for n ¼ k þ 1 if it is true for n ¼ k.
But since it is true for n ¼ 1, it
follows that it is true for n ¼ 1 þ 1 ¼ 2 and for n ¼ 2 þ 1 ¼ 3; . . . ; i.e., it is true for all positive integers n.
1.30.
Prove that xn  yn has x  y as a factor for all positive integers n.
The statement is true for n ¼ 1 since x1  y1 ¼ x  y.
Assume the statement true for n ¼ k, i.e., assume that xk  yk has x  y as a factor.
Consider
xkþ1  ykþ1 ¼ xkþ1  xky þ xky  ykþ1
¼ xkðx  yÞ þ yðxk  ykÞ
The ﬁrst term on the right has x  y as a factor, and the second term on the right also has x  y as a factor
because of the above assumption.
Thus xkþ1  ykþ1 has x  y as a factor if xk  yk does.
Then since x1  y1 has x  y as factor, it follows that x2  y2 has x  y as a factor, x3  y3 has x  y as a
factor, etc.

Prove Bernoulli’s inequality ð1 þ xÞn > 1 þ nx for n ¼ 2; 3; . . . if x > 1, x 6¼ 0.
The statement is true for n ¼ 2 since ð1 þ xÞ2 ¼ 1 þ 2x þ x2 > 1 þ 2x.
Assume the statement true for n ¼ k, i.e., ð1 þ xÞk > 1 þ kx.
Multiply both sides by 1 þ x (which is positive since x > 1).
Then we have
ð1 þ xÞkþ1 > ð1 þ xÞð1 þ kxÞ ¼ 1 þ ðk þ 1Þx þ kx2 > 1 þ ðk þ 1Þx
Thus the statement is true for n ¼ k þ 1 if it is true for n ¼ k.
But since the statement is true for n ¼ 2, it must be true for n ¼ 2 þ 1 ¼ 3; . . . and is thus true for all
integers greater than or equal to 2.
Note that the result is not true for n ¼ 1.
However, the modiﬁed result ð1 þ xÞn A 1 þ nx is true for
n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . .

Prove that every positive integer P can be expressed uniquely in the form P ¼ a02n þ a12n1þ
a22n2 þ    þ an where the a’s are 0’s or 1’s.
Dividing P by 2, we have P=2 ¼ a02n1 þ a12n2 þ    þ an1 þ an=2.
Then an is the remainder, 0 or 1, obtained when P is divided by 2 and is unique.
Let P1 be the integer part of P=2.
Then P1 ¼ a02n1 þ a12n2 þ    þ an1.
Dividing P1 by 2 we see that an1 is the remainder, 0 or 1, obtained when P1 is divided by 2 and is
unique.
By continuing in this manner, all the a’s can be determined as 0’s or 1’s and are unique.

Dedekind deﬁned a cut, section, or partition in the rational number system as a separation of all
rational numbers into two classes or sets called L (the left-hand class) and R (the right-hand class)
having the following properties:
I.
The classes are non-empty (i.e. at least one number belongs to each class).
II.
Every rational number is in one class or the other.
III.
Every number in L is less than every number in R.
Prove each of the following statements:
(a) There cannot be a largest number in L and a smallest number in R.
(b) It is possible for L to have a largest number and for R to have no smallest number.
What
type of number does the cut deﬁne in this case?
(c) It is possible for L to have no largest number and for R to have a smallest number.
What
type of number does the cut deﬁne in this case?
16
NUMBERS
[CHAP. 1

(d) It is possible for L to have no largest number and for R to have no smallest number.
What
type of number does the cut deﬁne in this case?
(a)
Let a be the largest rational number in L, and b the smallest rational number in R. Then either a ¼ b or
a < b.
We cannot have a ¼ b since by deﬁnition of the cut every number in L is less than every number
in R.
We cannot have a < b since by Problem 1.9, 1
2 ða þ bÞ is a rational number which would be greater
than a (and so would have to be in R) but less than b (and so would have to be in L), and by deﬁnition a
rational number cannot belong to both L and R.
(b)
As an indication of the possibility, let L contain the number 2
3 and all rational numbers less than 2
3, while
R contains all rational numbers greater than 2
3.
In this case the cut deﬁnes the rational number 2
3.
A
similar argument replacing 2
3 by any other rational number shows that in such case the cut deﬁnes a
rational number.
(c)
As an indication of the possibility, let L contain all rational numbers less than 2
3, while R contains all
rational numbers greaters than 2
3.
This cut also deﬁnes the rational number 2
3.
A similar argument
shows that this cut always deﬁnes a rational number.
(d)
As an indication of the possibility let L consist of all negative rational numbers and all positive rational
numbers whose squares are less than 2, while R consists of all positive numbers whose squares are
greater than 2.
We can show that if a is any number of the L class, there is always a larger number of
the L class, while if b is any number of the R class, there is always a smaller number of the R class (see
Problem 1.106).
A cut of this type deﬁnes an irrational number.
From (b), (c), (d) it follows that every cut in the rational number system, called a Dedekind cut,
deﬁnes either a rational or an irrational number.
By use of Dedekind cuts we can deﬁne operations
(such as addition, multiplication, etc.) with irrational numbers.

Sequences
DEFINITION OF A SEQUENCE
A sequence is a set of numbers u1; u2; u3; . . . in a deﬁnite order of arrangement (i.e., a correspondence
with the natural numbers) and formed according to a deﬁnite rule.
Each number in the sequence is
called a term; un is called the nth term.
The sequence is called ﬁnite or inﬁnite according as there are or
are not a ﬁnite number of terms.
The sequence u1; u2; u3; . . . is also designated brieﬂy by fung.
EXAMPLES.
1. The set of numbers 2; 7; 12; 17; . . . ; 32 is a ﬁnite sequence; the nth term is given by
un ¼ 2 þ 5ðn  1Þ ¼ 5n  3, n ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 7.
2. The set of numbers 1; 1=3; 1=5; 1=7; . . . is an inﬁnite sequence with nth term un ¼ 1=ð2n  1Þ,
n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . .
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we shall consider inﬁnite sequences only.
LIMIT OF A SEQUENCE
A number l is called the limit of an inﬁnite sequence u1; u2; u3; . . . if for any positive number  we can
ﬁnd a positive number N depending on  such that jun  lj <  for all integers n > N.
In such case we
write lim
n!1 un ¼ l.
EXAMPLE .
If un ¼ 3 þ 1=n ¼ ð3n þ 1Þ=n, the sequence is 4; 7=2; 10=3; . . . and we can show that lim
n!1 un ¼ 3.
If the limit of a sequence exists, the sequence is called convergent; otherwise, it is called divergent. A
sequence can converge to only one limit, i.e., if a limit exists, it is unique.
See Problem 2.8.
A more intuitive but unrigorous way of expressing this concept of limit is to say that a sequence
u1; u2; u3; . . . has a limit l if the successive terms get ‘‘closer and closer’’ to l.
This is often used to
provide a ‘‘guess’’ as to the value of the limit, after which the deﬁnition is applied to see if the guess is
really correct.

INFINITY
We write lim
n!1 an ¼ 1 if for each positive number M we can ﬁnd a positive number N (depending on
M) such that an > M for all n > N. Similarly, we write lim
n!1 an ¼ 1 if for each positive number M we
can ﬁnd a positive number N such that an < M for all n > N.
It should be emphasized that 1 and
1 are not numbers and the sequences are not convergent.
The terminology employed merely
indicates that the sequences diverge in a certain manner.
That is, no matter how large a number in
absolute value that one chooses there is an n such that the absolute value of an is greater than that
quantity.
BOUNDED, MONOTONIC SEQUENCES
If un @ M for n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; where M is a constant (independent of n), we say that the sequence
fung is bounded above and M is called an upper bound. If un A m, the sequence is bounded below and m is
called a lower bound.
If m @ un @ M the sequence is called bounded.
Often this is indicated by junj @ P.
Every
convergent sequence is bounded, but the converse is not necessarily true.
If unþ1 A un the sequence is called monotonic increasing; if unþ1 > un it is called strictly increasing.
Similarly, if unþ1 @ un the sequence is called monotonic decreasing, while if unþ1 < un it is strictly
decreasing.
EXAMPLES.
1. The sequence 1; 1:1; 1:11; 1:111; . . . is bounded and monotonic increasing.
It is also strictly
increasing.
2. The sequence 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; . . . is bounded but not monotonic increasing or decreasing.
3. The sequence 1; 1:5; 2; 2:5; 3; . . . is monotonic decreasing and not bounded. However, it
is bounded above.
The following theorem is fundamental and is related to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (Chapter
1, Page 6) which is proved in Problem 2.23.
Theorem.
Every bounded monotonic (increasing or decreasing) sequence has a limit.
LEAST UPPER BOUND AND GREATEST LOWER BOUND OF A SEQUENCE
A number M is called the least upper bound (l.u.b.) of the sequence fung if un @ M, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . .
while at least one term is greater than M   for any  > 0.
A number m is called the greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) of the sequence fung if un A m, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . .
while at least one term is less than m þ  for any  > 0.
Compare with the deﬁnition of l.u.b. and g.l.b. for sets of numbers in general (see Page 6).

SEQUENCES
[CHAP. 2

LIMIT SUPERIOR, LIMIT INFERIOR
A number l is called the limit superior, greatest limit or upper limit (lim sup or lim) of the sequence
fung if inﬁnitely many terms of the sequence are greater than l   while only a ﬁnite number of terms are
greater than l þ , where  is any positive number.
A number l is called the limit inferior, least limit or lower limit (lim inf or lim) of the sequence fung if
inﬁntely many terms of the sequence are less than l þ  while only a ﬁnite number of terms are less than
l  , where  is any positive number.
These correspond to least and greatest limiting points of general sets of numbers.
If inﬁntely many terms of fung exceed any positive number M, we deﬁne lim sup fung ¼ 1.
If
inﬁnitely many terms are less than M, where M is any positive number, we deﬁne lim inf fung ¼ 1.
If lim
n!1 un ¼ 1, we deﬁne lim sup fung ¼ lim inf fung ¼ 1.
If lim
n!1 un ¼ 1, we deﬁne lim sup fung ¼ lim inf fung ¼ 1.
Although every bounded sequence is not necessarily convergent, it always has a ﬁnite lim sup and
lim inf.
A sequence fung converges if and only if lim sup un ¼ lim inf un is ﬁnite.
NESTED INTERVALS
Consider a set of intervals ½an; bn, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; where each interval is contained in the preceding
one and lim
n!1ðan  bnÞ ¼ 0.
Such intervals are called nested intervals.
We can prove that to every set of nested intervals there corresponds one and only one real number.
This can be used to establish the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem of Chapter 1.
(See Problems 2.22 and
2.23.)
CAUCHY’S CONVERGENCE CRITERION
Cauchy’s convergence criterion states that a sequence fung converges if and only if for each  > 0 we
can ﬁnd a number N such that jup  uqj <  for all p; q > N.
This criterion has the advantage that one
need not know the limit l in order to demonstrate convergence.
INFINITE SERIES
Let u1; u2; u3; . . . be a given sequence.
Form a new sequence S1; S2; S3; . . . where
S1 ¼ u1; S2 ¼ u1 þ u2; S3 ¼ u1 þ u2 þ u3; . . . ; Sn ¼ u1 þ u2 þ u3 þ    þ un; . . .
where Sn, called the nth partial sum, is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the sequence fung.
The sequence S1; S2; S3; . . . is symbolized by
u1 þ u2 þ u3 þ    ¼
X
1
n¼1
un
which is called an inﬁnite series.
If lim
n!1 Sn ¼ S exists, the series is called convergent and S is its sum,
otherwise the series is called divergent.
Further discussion of inﬁnite series and other topics related to sequences is given in Chapter 11.

Two students were asked to write an nth term for the sequence 1; 16; 81; 256; . . . and to write the
5th term of the sequence. One student gave the nth term as un ¼ n4. The other student, who did
not recognize this simple law of formation, wrote un ¼ 10n3  35n2 þ 50n  24.
Which student
gave the correct 5th term?
If un ¼ n4, then u1 ¼ 14 ¼ 1, u2 ¼ 24 ¼ 16, u3 ¼ 34 ¼ 81, u4 ¼ 44 ¼ 256, which agrees with the ﬁrst four
terms of the sequence.
Hence the ﬁrst student gave the 5th term as u5 ¼ 54 ¼ 625:
If un ¼ 10n3  35n2 þ 50n  24, then u1 ¼ 1; u2 ¼ 16; u3 ¼ 81; u4 ¼ 256, which also agrees with the ﬁrst
four terms given.
Hence, the second student gave the 5th term as u5 ¼ 601:
Both students were correct.
Merely giving a ﬁnite number of terms of a sequence does not deﬁne a
unique nth term.
In fact, an inﬁnite number of nth terms is possible.

It should be emphasized that the use of the notations 1 and 1 for limits does not in any way
imply convergence of the given sequences, since 1 and 1 are not numbers.
Instead, these are
notations used to describe that the sequences diverge in speciﬁc ways.
2.7.
Prove that lim
n!1 xn ¼ 0 if jxj < 1.
Method 1:
We can restrict ourselves to x 6¼ 0, since if x ¼ 0, the result is clearly true.
Given  > 0, we must show
that there exists N such that jxnj <  for n > N. Now jxnj ¼ jxjn <  when n log10 jxj < log10 . Dividing by
log10 jxj, which is negative, yields n > log10 
log10 jxj ¼ N, proving the required result.
Method 2:
Let jxj ¼ 1=ð1 þ pÞ, where p > 0.
By Bernoulli’s inequality (Problem 1.31, Chapter 1), we have
jxnj ¼ jxjn ¼ 1=ð1 þ pÞn < 1=ð1 þ npÞ <  for all n > N.
Thus lim
n!1 xn ¼ 0.

BOUNDED MONOTONIC SEQUENCES

Prove that the sequence with nth un ¼ 2n  7

(a) is monotonic increasing,
(b) is bounded
above,
(c) is bounded below,
(d) is bounded,
(e) has a limit.

fung is monotonic increasing if unþ1 A un, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . .

true.
Thus, by reversal of steps in the inequalities, we see that fung is monotonic increasing.
Actually,
since 10 > 35, the sequence is strictly increasing.
(b)
By writing some terms of the sequence, we may guess that an upper bound is 2 (for example). To prove
this we must show that un @ 2.
If ð2n  7Þ=ð3n þ 2Þ @ 2 then 2n  7 @ 6n þ 4 or 4n < 11, which is
true.
Reversal of steps proves that 2 is an upper bound.
(c)
Since this particular sequence is monotonic increasing, the ﬁrst term 1 is a lower bound, i.e.,
un A  1, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . .
Any number less than 1 is also a lower bound.
(d)
Since the sequence has an upper and lower bound, it is bounded.
Thus, for example, we can write
junj @ 2 for all n.
(e)
Since every bounded monotonic (increasing or decreasing) sequence has a limit, the given sequence has
a limit.

Clearly, unþ1 A un. Then the sequence is monotone increasing.
By Problem 1.14, Chapter 1, un @ 31 ¼ 3, i.e. un is bounded above. Hence, un is bounded (since a
lower bound is zero).
Thus, a limit exists, since the sequence is bounded and monotonic increasing.

Then a1 @ an @ bn @ b1, and the sequences fang and fbng are bounded and respectively monotonic

Prove the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (see Page 6).
Suppose the given bounded inﬁnite set is contained in the ﬁnite interval ½a; b.
Divide this interval into
two equal intervals.
Then at least one of these, denoted by ½a1; b1, contains inﬁnitely many points.
Dividing ½a1; b1 into two equal intervals, we obtain another interval, say, ½a2; b2, containing inﬁnitely
many points.
Continuing this process, we obtain a set of intervals ½an; bn, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; each interval
contained in the preceding one and such that
b1  a1 ¼ ðb  aÞ=2; b2  a2 ¼ ðb1  a1Þ=2 ¼ ðb  aÞ=22; . . . ; bn  an ¼ ðb  aÞ=2n

This set of nested intervals, by Problem 2.22, corresponds to a real number which represents a limit
point and so proves the theorem.
CAUCHY’S CONVERGENCE CRITERION
2.24.
Prove Cauchy’s convergence criterion as stated on Page 25.
Necessity.
Suppose the sequence fung converges to l.
Then given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd N such that
jup  lj < =2 for all p > N
and
juq  lj < =2 for all q > N
Then for both p > N and q > N, we have
jup  uqj ¼ jðup  lÞ þ ðl  uqÞj @ jup  lj þ jl  uqj < =2 þ =2 ¼ 
Suﬃciency.
Suppose jup  uqj <  for all p; q > N and any  > 0.
Then all the numbers uN; uNþ1; . . .
lie in a ﬁnite interval, i.e., the set is bounded and inﬁnite. Hence, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem there
is at least one limit point, say a.
If a is the only limit point, we have the desired proof and lim
n!1 un ¼ a.
Suppose there are two distinct limit points, say a and b, and suppose b > a (see Fig. 2-1). By deﬁnition
of limit points, we have
jup  aj < ðb  aÞ=3
for infinnitely many values of p
ð1Þ
juq  bj < ðb  aÞ=3
for infinitely many values of q
ð2Þ
Then since b  a ¼ ðb  uqÞ þ ðuq  upÞ þ ðup  aÞ, we have
jb  aj ¼ b  a @ jb  uqj þ jup  uqj þ jup  aj
ð3Þ
Using (1) and (2) in (3), we see that jup  uqj > ðb  aÞ=3 for inﬁnitely many values of p and q, thus
contradicting the hypothesis that jup  uqj <  for p; q > N and any  > 0.
Hence, there is only one limit
point and the theorem is proved.

Functions, Limits, and
Continuity
FUNCTIONS
A function is composed of a domain set, a range set, and a rule of correspondence that assigns
exactly one element of the range to each element of the domain.
This deﬁnition of a function places no restrictions on the nature of the elements of the two sets.
However, in our early exploration of the calculus, these elements will be real numbers.
The rule of
correspondence can take various forms, but in advanced calculus it most often is an equation or a set of
equations.
If the elements of the domain and range are represented by x and y, respectively, and f symbolizes
the function, then the rule of correspondence takes the form y ¼ f ðxÞ.
The distinction between f and f ðxÞ should be kept in mind. f denotes the function as deﬁned in the
ﬁrst paragraph.
y and f ðxÞ are diﬀerent symbols for the range (or image) values corresponding to
domain values x. However a ‘‘common practice’’ that provides an expediency in presentation is to read
f ðxÞ as, ‘‘the image of x with respect to the function f ’’ and then use it when referring to the function.
(For example, it is simpler to write sin x than ‘‘the sine function, the image value of which is sin x.’’)
This deviation from precise notation will appear in the text because of its value in exhibiting the ideas.
The domain variable x is called the independent variable.
The variable y representing the corre-
sponding set of values in the range, is the dependent variable.
Note: There is nothing exclusive about the use of x, y, and f to represent domain, range, and
function.
Many other letters will be employed.
There are many ways to relate the elements of two sets. [Not all of them correspond a unique range
value to a given domain value.] For example, given the equation y2 ¼ x, there are two choices of y for
each positive value of x. As another example, the pairs ða; bÞ, ða; cÞ, ða; dÞ, and ða; eÞ can be formed and
again the correspondence to a domain value is not unique.
Because of such possibilities, some texts,
especially older ones, distinguish between multiple-valued and single-valued functions.
This viewpoint
is not consistent with our deﬁnition or modern presentations.
In order that there be no ambiguity, the
calculus and its applications require a single image associated with each domain value.
A multiple-
valued rule of correspondence gives rise to a collection of functions (i.e., single-valued).
Thus, the rule
y2 ¼ x is replaced by the pair of rules y ¼ x1=2 and y ¼ x1=2 and the functions they generate through the
establishment of domains.
(See the following section on graphs for pictorial illustrations.)

EXAMPLES.
1.
If to each number in 1 @ x @ 1 we associate a number y given by x2, then the interval
1 @ x @ 1 is the domain.
The rule y ¼ x2 generates the range 1 @ y @ 1.
The totality
is a function f .
The functional image of x is given by y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x2. For example, f ð 1
3Þ ¼ ð 1
3Þ2 ¼ 1
9 is the
image of  1
3 with respect to the function f .
2.
The sequences of Chapter 2 may be interpreted as functions. For inﬁnite sequences consider the
domain as the set of positive integers. The rule is the deﬁnition of un, and the range is generated
by this rule.
To illustrate, let un ¼ 1
n with n ¼ 1; 2; . . . .
Then the range contains the elements
1; 1
2 ; 1
3 ; 1
4 ; . . . .
If the function is denoted by f , then we may write f ðnÞ ¼ 1
n.
As you read this chapter, reviewing Chapter 2 will be very useful, and in particular com-
paring the corresponding sections.
3.
With each time t after the year 1800 we can associate a value P for the population of the United
States.
The correspondence between P and t deﬁnes a function, say F, and we can write
P ¼ FðtÞ.
4.
For the present, both the domain and the range of a function have been restricted to sets of real
numbers.
Eventually this limitation will be removed.
To get the ﬂavor for greater generality,
think of a map of the world on a globe with circles of latitude and longitude as coordinate
curves.
Assume there is a rule that corresponds this domain to a range that is a region of a
plane endowed with a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.
(Thus, a ﬂat map usable for
navigation and other purposes is created.)
The points of the domain are expressed as pairs of
numbers ð; Þ and those of the range by pairs ðx; yÞ.
These sets and a rule of correspondence
constitute a function whose independent and dependent variables are not single real numbers;
rather, they are pairs of real numbers.
GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
A function f establishes a set of ordered pairs ðx; yÞ of real numbers.
The plot of these pairs
ðx; f ðxÞÞ in a coordinate system is the graph of f . The result can be thought of as a pictorial representa-
tion of the function.
For example, the graphs of the functions described by y ¼ x2, 1 @ x @ 1, and y2 ¼ x, 0 @ x @ 1,
y A 0 appear in Fig. 3-1.
BOUNDED FUNCTIONS
If there is a constant M such that f ðxÞ @ M for all x in an interval (or other set of numbers), we say
that f is bounded above in the interval (or the set) and call M an upper bound of the function.
If a constant m exists such that f ðxÞ A m for all x in an interval, we say that f ðxÞ is bounded below in
the interval and call m a lower bound.
40
FUNCTIONS, LIMITS, AND CONTINUITY
[CHAP. 3
Fig. 3-1

If m @ f ðxÞ @ M in an interval, we call f ðxÞ bounded.
Frequencly, when we wish to indicate that a
function is bounded, we shall write j f ðxÞj < P.
EXAMPLES.
1.
f ðxÞ ¼ 3 þ x is bounded in 1 @ x @ 1.
An upper bound is 4 (or any number greater than 4).
A lower bound is 2 (or any number less than 2).
2.
f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x is not bounded in 0 < x < 4 since by choosing x suﬃciently close to zero, f ðxÞ can be
made as large as we wish, so that there is no upper bound. However, a lower bound is given by
1
4 (or any number less than 1
4).
If f ðxÞ has an upper bound it has a least upper bound (l.u.b.); if it has a lower bound it has a greatest
lower bound (g.l.b.). (See Chapter 1 for these deﬁnitions.)
MONOTONIC FUNCTIONS
A function is called monotonic increasing in an interval if for any two points x1 and x2 in the interval
such that x1 < x2, f ðx1Þ @ f ðx2Þ.
If f ðx1Þ < f ðx2Þ the function is called strictly increasing.
Similarly if f ðx1Þ A f ðx2Þ whenever x1 < x2, then f ðxÞ is monotonic decreasing; while if f ðx1Þ > f ðx2Þ,
it is strictly decreasing.
INVERSE FUNCTIONS.
PRINCIPAL VALUES
Suppose y is the range variable of a function f with domain variable x.
Furthermore, let the
correspondence between the domain and range values be one-to-one.
Then a new function f 1, called
the inverse function of f , can be created by interchanging the domain and range of f . This information is
contained in the form x ¼ f 1ðyÞ.
As you work with the inverse function, it often is convenient to rename the domain variable as x and
use y to symbolize the images, then the notation is y ¼ f 1ðxÞ.
In particular, this allows graphical
expression of the inverse function with its domain on the horizontal axis.
Note: f 1 does not mean f to the negative one power.
When used with functions the notation f 1
always designates the inverse function to f .
If the domain and range elements of f are not in one-to-one correspondence (this would mean that
distinct domain elements have the same image), then a collection of one-to-one functions may be created.
Each of them is called a branch.
It is often convenient to choose one of these branches, called the
principal branch, and denote it as the inverse function, f 1.
The range values of f that compose the
principal branch, and hence the domain of f 1, are called the principal values.
(As will be seen in the
section of elementary functions, it is common practice to specify these principal values for that class of
functions.)
EXAMPLE.
Suppose f is generated by y ¼ sin x and the domain is 1 @ x @ 1.
Then there are an inﬁnite
number of domain values that have the same image. (A ﬁnite portion of the graph is illustrated below in Fig. 3-2(a.)
In Fig. 3-2(b) the graph is rotated about a line at 458 so that the x-axis rotates into the y-axis. Then the variables are
interchanged so that the x-axis is once again the horizontal one.
We see that the image of an x value is not unique.
Therefore, a set of principal values must be chosen to establish an inverse function.
A choice of a branch is
accomplished by restricting the domain of the starting function, sin x.
For example, choose  
2 @ x @ 
2.
Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of this domain and the images in 1 @ x @ 1.
Thus, f 1 may be deﬁned with this interval as its domain.
This idea is illustrated in Fig. 3-2(c) and Fig. 3-2(d).
With the domain of f 1 represented on the horizontal axis and by the variable x, we write y ¼ sin1 x, 1 @ x @ 1.
If x ¼  1
2, then the corresponding range value is y ¼  
6.
Note: In algebra, b1 means 1
b and the fact that bb1 produces the identity element 1 is simply a rule of algebra
generalized from arithmetic.
Use of a similar exponential notation for inverse functions is justiﬁed in that corre-
sponding algebraic characteristics are displayed by f 1½ f ðxÞ ¼ x and f ½ f 1ðxÞ ¼ x.

MAXIMA AND MINIMA
The seventeenth-century development of the calculus was strongly motivated by questions concern-
ing extreme values of functions.
Of most importance to the calculus and its applications were the
notions of local extrema, called relative maximums and relative minimums.
If the graph of a function were compared to a path over hills and through valleys, the local extrema
would be the high and low points along the way.
This intuitive view is given mathematical precision by
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition:
If there exists an open interval ða; bÞ containing c such that f ðxÞ < f ðcÞ for all x other than c
in the interval, then f ðcÞ is a relative maximum of f .
If f ðxÞ > f ðcÞ for all x in ða; bÞ other than c, then
f ðcÞ is a relative minimum of f .
(See Fig. 3-3.)
Functions may have any number of relative extrema. On the other hand, they may have none, as in
the case of the strictly increasing and decreasing functions previously deﬁned.
Deﬁnition:
If c is in the domain of f and for all x in the domain of the function f ðxÞ @ f ðcÞ, then f ðcÞ is
an absolute maximum of the function f .
If for all x in the domain f ðxÞ A f ðcÞ then f ðcÞ is an absolute
minimum of f .
(See Fig. 3-3.)
Note: If deﬁned on closed intervals the strictly increasing and decreasing functions possess absolute
extrema.
42
FUNCTIONS, LIMITS, AND CONTINUITY
[CHAP. 3
Fig. 3-2

Absolute extrema are not necessarily unique. For example, if the graph of a function is a horizontal
line, then every point is an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
Note: A point of inﬂection also is represented in Fig. 3-3. There is an overlap with relative extrema in

It is worth realizing that there is a fundamental pool of functions at the foundation of calculus and
advanced calculus. These are called elementary functions. Either they are generated from a real variable
x by the fundamental operations of algebra, including powers and roots, or they have relatively simple
geometric interpretations. As the title ‘‘elementary functions’’ suggests, there is a more general category
of functions (which, in fact, are dependent on the elementary ones). Some of these will be explored later
in the book.
The elementary functions are described below.
1.
Polynomial functions have the form
f ðxÞ ¼ a0xn þ a1xn1 þ    þ an1x þ an
ð1Þ
where a0; . . . ; an are constants and n is a positive integer called the degree of the polynomial if
a0 6¼ 0.
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that in the ﬁeld of complex numbers every
polynomial equation has at least one root.
As a consequence of this theorem, it can be proved
that every nth degree polynomial has n roots in the complex ﬁeld.
When complex numbers are
admitted, the polynomial theoretically may be expressed as the product of n linear factors; with
our restriction to real numbers, it is possible that 2k of the roots may be complex.
In this case,
the k factors generating them will be quadratic.
(The corresponding roots are in complex
conjugate pairs.)
The polynomial x3  5x2 þ 11x  15 ¼ ðx  3Þðx2  2x þ 5Þ illustrates this
thought.
2.
Algebraic functions are functions y ¼ f ðxÞ satisfying an equation of the form
p0ðxÞyn þ p1ðxÞyn1 þ    þ pn1ðxÞy þ pnðxÞ ¼ 0
ð2Þ
where p0ðxÞ; . . . ; pnðxÞ are polynomials in x.
If the function can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials, i.e., PðxÞ=QðxÞ where
PðxÞ and QðxÞ are polynomials, it is called a rational algebraic function; otherwise it is an
irrational algebraic function.
3.
Transcendental functions are functions which are not algebraic, i.e., they do not satisfy equations
of the form (2).

Note the analogy with real numbers, polynomials corresponding to integers, rational functions to
rational numbers, and so on.
TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS
The following are sometimes called elementary transcendental functions.
1.
Exponential function:
f ðxÞ ¼ ax, a 6¼ 0; 1.
For properties, see Page 3.
2.
Logarithmic function:
f ðxÞ ¼ loga x, a 6¼ 0; 1.
This and the exponential function are inverse
functions.
If
a ¼ e ¼ 2:71828 . . . ;
called
the
natural
base
of
logarithms,
we
write
f ðxÞ ¼ loge x ¼ ln x, called the natural logarithm of x.
For properties, see Page 4.
3.
Trigonometric functions
(Also called circular functions because of their geometric interpreta-
tion with respect to the unit circle):
sin x; cos x; tan x ¼ sin x
cos x ; csc x ¼
1
sin x ; sec x ¼
1
cos x ; cot x ¼
1
tan x ¼ cos x
sin x
The variable x is generally expressed in radians ( radians ¼ 1808).
For real values of x,
sin x and cos x lie between 1 and 1 inclusive.
The following are some properties of these functions:
sin2 x þ cos2 x ¼ 1
1 þ tan2 x ¼ sec2 x
1 þ cot2 x ¼ csc2 x
sinðx  yÞ ¼ sin x cos y  cos x sin y
sinðxÞ ¼  sin x

cosðxÞ ¼ cos x
tanðx  yÞ ¼ tan x  tan y
1 	 tan x tan y
tanðxÞ ¼  tan x
4.
Inverse trigonometric functions.
The following is a list of the inverse trigonometric functions
and their principal values:
ðaÞ
y ¼ sin1 x; ð=2 @ y @ =2Þ

y ¼ csc1 x ¼ sin1 1=x; ð=2 @ y @ =2Þ

Hyperbolic functions are deﬁned in terms of exponential functions as follows.
These functions
may be interpreted geometrically, much as the trigonometric functions but with respect to the
unit hyperbola.

LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS
Let f ðxÞ be deﬁned and single-valued for all values of x near x ¼ x0 with the possible exception of
x ¼ x0 itslef (i.e., in a deleted  neighborhood of x0).
We say that the number l is the limit of f ðxÞ as x
approaches x0 and write lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ l if for any positive number  (however small) we can ﬁnd some
positive number  (usually depending on ) such that j f ðxÞ  lj <  whenever 0 < jx  x0j < .
In such
case we also say that f ðxÞ approaches l as x approaches x0 and write f ðxÞ ! l as x ! x0.
In words, this means that we can make f ðxÞ arbitrarily close to l by choosing x suﬃciently close to
x0.
EXAMPLE.
Let f ðxÞ ¼ x2 if x 6¼ 2
0 if x ¼ 2




.
Then as x gets closer to 2 (i.e., x approaches 2), f ðxÞ gets closer to 4.
We
thus suspect that lim
x!2 f ðxÞ ¼ 4.
To prove this we must see whether the above deﬁnition of limit (with l ¼ 4) is
satisﬁed. For this proof see Problem 3.10.
Note that lim
x!2 f ðxÞ 6¼ f ð2Þ, i.e., the limit of f ðxÞ as x ! 2 is not the same as the value of f ðxÞ at x ¼ 2 since
f ð2Þ ¼ 0 by deﬁnition.
The limit would in fact be 4 even if f ðxÞ were not deﬁned at x ¼ 2.
When the limit of a function exists it is unique, i.e., it is the only one (see Problem 3.17).
RIGHT- AND LEFT-HAND LIMITS
In the deﬁnition of limit no restriction was made as to how x should approach x0.
It is sometimes
found convenient to restrict this approach.
Considering x and x0 as points on the real axis where x0 is
ﬁxed and x is moving, then x can approach x0 from the right or from the left.
We indicate these
respective approaches by writing x ! x0þ and x ! x0.
If lim
x!x0þ f ðxÞ ¼ l1 and lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ l2, we call l1 and l2, respectively, the right- and left-hand limits of
f at x0 and denote them by f ðx0þÞ or f ðx0 þ 0Þ and f ðx0Þ or f ðx0  0Þ.
The ;  deﬁnitions of limit of
f ðxÞ as x ! x0þ or x ! x0 are the same as those for x ! x0 except for the fact that values of x are
restricted to x > x0 or x < x0, respectively.
We have lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ l if and only if
lim
x!x0þ f ðxÞ ¼ lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ l.

Similar results hold for right- and left-hand limits.
INFINITY
It sometimes happens that as x ! x0, f ðxÞ increases or decreases without bound.
In such case it is
customary to write lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ þ1 or lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ 1, respectively.
The symbols þ1 (also written
1) and 1 are read plus inﬁnity (or inﬁnity) and minus inﬁnity, respectively, but it must be emphasized
that they are not numbers.
In precise language, we say that lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ 1 if for each positive number M we can ﬁnd a positive
number  (depending on M in general) such that f ðxÞ > M whenever 0 < jx  x0j < . Similarly, we say
that lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ 1 if for each positive number M we can ﬁnd a positive number  such that
f ðxÞ < M whenever 0 < jx  x0j < .
Analogous remarks apply in case x ! x0þ or x ! x0.
Frequently we wish to examine the behavior of a function as x increases or decreases without bound.
In such cases it is customary to write x ! þ1 (or 1) or x ! 1, respectively.
We say that
lim
x!þ1 f ðxÞ ¼ l, or f ðxÞ ! l as x ! þ1, if for any positive number  we can ﬁnd a
positive number N (depending on  in general) such that j f ðxÞ  lj <  whenever x > N.
A similar
deﬁnition can be formulated for
lim
x!1 f ðxÞ.

CONTINUITY
Let f be deﬁned for all values of x near x ¼ x0 as well as at x ¼ x0 (i.e., in a  neighborhood of x0).
The function f is called continuous at x ¼ x0 if lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ. Note that this implies three conditions
which must be met in order that f ðxÞ be continuous at x ¼ x0.
1.
lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ l must exist.
2.
f ðx0Þ must exist, i.e., f ðxÞ is deﬁned at x0.
3.
l ¼ f ðx0Þ.
In summary, lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ is the value suggested for f at x ¼ x0 by the behavior of f in arbitrarily small
neighborhoods of x0.
If in fact this limit is the actual value, f ðx0Þ, of the function at x0, then f is
continuous there.
Equivalently, if f is continuous at x0, we can write this in the suggestive form lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ f ð lim
x!x0 xÞ.

EXAMPLES.
1.
If f ðxÞ ¼
x2;
x 6¼ 2
0;
x ¼ 2

then from the example on Page 45 lim
x!2 f ðxÞ ¼ 4.
But f ð2Þ ¼ 0.
Hence
lim
x!2 f ðxÞ 6¼ f ð2Þ and the function is not continuous at x ¼ 2.
2.
If f ðxÞ ¼ x2 for all x, then lim
x!2 f ðxÞ ¼ f ð2Þ ¼ 4 and f ðxÞ is continuous at x ¼ 2.
Points where f fails to be continuous are called discontinuities of f and f is said to be discontinuous at
these points.
In constructing a graph of a continuous function the pencil need never leave the paper, while for a
discontinuous function this is not true since there is generally a jump taking place.
This is of course
merely a characteristic property and not a deﬁnition of continuity or discontinuity.
Alternative to the above deﬁnition of continuity, we can deﬁne f as continuous at x ¼ x0 if for any
 > 0 we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that j f ðxÞ  f ðx0Þj <  whenever jx  x0j < .
Note that this is simply the
deﬁnition of limit with l ¼ f ðx0Þ and removal of the restriction that x 6¼ x0.
RIGHT- AND LEFT-HAND CONTINUITY
If f is deﬁned only for x A x0, the above deﬁnition does not apply. In such case we call f continuous
(on the right) at x ¼ x0 if lim
x!x0þ f ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ, i.e., if f ðx0þÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ. Similarly, f is continuous (on the left)
at x ¼ x0 if
lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ, i.e., f ðx0Þ ¼ f ðx0Þ.
Deﬁnitions in terms of  and  can be given.
CONTINUITY IN AN INTERVAL
A function f is said to be continuous in an interval if it is continuous at all points of the interval.
In
particular, if f is deﬁned in the closed interval a @ x @ b or ½a; b, then f is continuous in the interval if
and only if lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ for a < x0 < b, lim
x!aþ f ðxÞ ¼ f ðaÞ and lim
x!b f ðxÞ ¼ f ðbÞ.
THEOREMS ON CONTINUITY
Theorem 1.
If f and g are continuous at x ¼ x0, so also are the functions whose image values satisfy the
relations f ðxÞ þ gðxÞ, f ðxÞ  gðxÞ, f ðxÞgðxÞ and f ðxÞ
gðxÞ, the last only if gðx0Þ 6¼ 0.
Similar results hold for
continuity in an interval.
Theorem 2.
Functions described as follows are continuous in every ﬁnite interval: (a) all polynomials;
(b) sin x and cos x;
(c) ax; a > 0
Theorem 3.
Let the function f be continuous at the domain value x ¼ x0. Also suppose that a function
g, represented by z ¼ gðyÞ, is continuous at y0, where y ¼ f ðxÞ (i.e., the range value of f corresponding to
x0 is a domain value of g).
Then a new function, called a composite function, f ðgÞ, represented by
z ¼ g½ f ðxÞ, may be created which is continuous at its domain point x ¼ x0. [One says that a continuous
function of a continuous function is continuous.]
Theorem 4.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in a closed interval, it is bounded in the interval.
Theorem 5.
If f ðxÞ is continuous at x ¼ x0 and f ðx0Þ > 0 [or f ðx0Þ < 0], there exists an interval about
x ¼ x0 in which f ðxÞ > 0 [or f ðxÞ < 0].
Theorem 6.
If a function f ðxÞ is continuous in an interval and either strictly increasing or strictly
decreasing, the inverse function f 1ðxÞ is single-valued, continuous, and either strictly increasing or
strictly decreasing.

Theorem 7.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b and if f ðaÞ ¼ A and f ðbÞ ¼ B, then corresponding to any
number C between A and B there exists at least one number c in ½a; b such that f ðcÞ ¼ C.
This is
sometimes called the intermediate value theorem.
Theorem 8.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b and if f ðaÞ and f ðbÞ have opposite signs, there is at least one
number c for which f ðcÞ ¼ 0 where a < c < b.
This is related to Theorem 7.
Theorem 9.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in a closed interval, then f ðxÞ has a maximum value M for at least one
value of x in the interval and a minimum value m for at least one value of x in the interval.
Further-
more, f ðxÞ assumes all values between m and M for one or more values of x in the interval.
Theorem 10.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in a closed interval and if M and m are respectively the least upper
bound (l.u.b.) and greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) of f ðxÞ, there exists at least one value of x in the interval
for which f ðxÞ ¼ M or f ðxÞ ¼ m.
This is related to Theorem 9.
PIECEWISE CONTINUITY
A function is called piecewise continuous in an interval a @ x @ b if the interval can be subdivided
into a ﬁnite number of intervals in each of which the function is continuous and has ﬁnite right- and left-
hand limits.
Such a function has only a ﬁnite number of discontinuities.
An example of a function
which is piecewise continuous in a @ x @ b is shown graphically in Fig. 3-4 below.
This function has
discontinuities at x1, x2, x3, and x4.
UNIFORM CONTINUITY
Let f be continuous in an interval.
Then by deﬁnition at each point x0 of the interval and for any
 > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 (which will in general depend on both  and the particular point x0) such that
j f ðxÞ  f ðx0Þj <  whenever jx  x0j < .
If we can ﬁnd  for each  which holds for all points of the
interval (i.e., if  depends only on  and not on x0), we say that f is uniformly continuous in the interval.
Alternatively, f is uniformly continuous in an interval if for any  > 0 we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that
j f ðx1Þ  f ðx2Þj <  whenever jx1  x2j <  where x1 and x2 are any two points in the interval.
Theorem.
If f is continuous in a closed interval, it is uniformly continuous in the interval.

The graph of gðxÞ is the same as that in Problem 3.1 except that the two points ð2; 0Þ and ð8; 0Þ are

The g.l.b. of gðxÞ is 0.
(c)
The l.u.b. of gðxÞ is attained for the value of x ¼ 5.
The g.l.b. of gðxÞ is not attained, since there is no

As in (b), the l.u.b. of f ðxÞ is 9 and the g.l.b. of f ðxÞ is 0.
The l.u.b. of f ðxÞ is attained for the value

Note that a function, such as f ðxÞ, which is continuous in a closed interval attains its l.u.b. and g.l.b.
at some point of the interval.
However, a function, such as gðxÞ, which is not continuous in a closed
interval need not attain its l.u.b. and g.l.b.

(b)
The graph is shown in the adjoining Fig. 3-6. Because both the
sets of rational numbers and irrational numbers are dense, the
visual impression is that there are two images corresponding to
each domain value. In actuality, each domain value has only
one corresponding range value.

Referring to Problem 3.1:
(a) Draw the graph with axes
interchanged, thus illustrating the two possible choices avail-

(b) Solve for x in terms of y to

(a)
The graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ is shown in Fig. 3-5 of Problem 3.1(a).
By interchanging the axes (and the
variables), we obtain the graphical form of Fig. 3-7. This ﬁgure illustrates that there are two values of y
corresponding to each value of x, and hence two branches.
Either may be employed to deﬁne f 1.

Yes, any strictly decreasing function is also monotonic decreasing, since if gðx1Þ > gðx2Þ it is also true
that gðx1Þ A gðx2Þ.

In general, any strictly decreasing (or increasing) function has a single-valued inverse (see Theorem

The results of this problem can be interpreted graphically using the ﬁgure of Problem 3.4.

(b) f ðxÞ ¼ ½x ¼ greatest

(a) The required graph is shown in Fig. 3-8.
Since jx sin 1=xj @ jxj, the graph is included between y ¼ x
and y ¼ x.
Note that f ðxÞ ¼ 0 when sin 1=x ¼ 0 or 1=x ¼; m, m ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4; . . . ; i.e., where
x ¼ 1=; 1=2; 1=3; . . . .
The curve oscillates inﬁnitely often between x ¼ 1= and x ¼ 0.

the integers.
The function is sometimes called the staircase function or step function.

(e) Using your choice,

(a) The graph of f ðxÞ ¼ tan x appears in Fig. 3-10 below.
(b)
The required graph is obtained by interchanging the x and y axes in the graph of (a).
The result, with
axes oriented as usual, appears in Fig. 3-11 above.
(c)
In Fig. 3-11 of (b), any vertical line meets the graph in inﬁnitely many points. Thus, the relation of y to
x is multivalued and inﬁnitely many branches are available for the purpose of deﬁning tan1 x.
(d)
To deﬁne tan1 x as a single-valued function, it is clear from the graph that we can only do so by
restricting its value to any of the following: =2 < tan1 x < =2; =2 < tan1 x < 3=2, etc.
We
shall agree to take the ﬁrst as deﬁning the principal value.
Note that no matter which branch is used to deﬁne tan1 x, the resulting function is strictly
increasing.
(e)
tan1ð1Þ ¼ =4 is the only value lying between =2 and =2, i.e., it is the principal value according
to our choice in ðdÞ.

the quotient of two polynomials, so that it is an irrational algebraic function.

(b) f ðxÞ ¼


, prove that lim
x!2 f ðxÞ ¼ 4.
(a)
We must show that given any  > 0 we can ﬁnd  > 0 (depending on  in general) such that jx2  4j < 
when 0 < jx  2j < .
Choose  @ 1 so that 0 < jx  2j < 1 or 1 < x < 3, x 6¼ 2.
Then jx2  4j ¼ jðx  2Þðx þ 2Þj ¼
jx  2jjx þ 2j < jx þ 2j < 5.
Take  as 1 or =5, whichever is smaller.
Then we have jx2  4j <  whenever 0 < jx  2j <  and
the required result is proved.
It is of interest to consider some numerical values. If for example we wish to make jx2  4j < :05,
we can choose  ¼ =5 ¼ :05=5 ¼ :01. To see that this is actually the case, note that if 0 < jx  2j < :01
then 1:99 < x < 2:01 ðx 6¼ 2Þ and so 3:9601 < x2 < 4:0401, :0399 < x2  4 < :0401 and certainly
jx2  4j < :05 ðx2 6¼ 4Þ.
The fact that these inequalities also happen to hold at x ¼ 2 is merely coin-
cidental.
If we wish to make jx2  4j < 6, we can choose  ¼ 1 and this will be satisﬁed.
(b)
There is no diﬀerence between the proof for this case and the proof in (a), since in both cases we exclude
x ¼ 2.

Prove that lim

Since x 6¼ 1, we can write 2x4  6x3 þ x2 þ 3

Then we must show that for any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that j2x3  4x2  3x þ 5j <  when
0 < jx  1j < .
Choosing  @ 1, we have 0 < x < 2, x 6¼ 1.
Now j2x3  4x2  3x þ 5j ¼ jx  1jj2x2  2x  5j < j2x2  2x  5j < ðj2x2j þ j2xj þ 5Þ < ð8 þ 4 þ 5Þ

Taking  as the smaller of 1 and =17, the required result follows.

Then the graph, shown in the adjoining Fig. 3-12,
consists of the lines y ¼ 1, x > 3; y ¼ 1, x < 3 and
the point ð3; 0Þ.
(b)
As x ! 3 from the right, f ðxÞ ! 1, i.e., lim
x!3þ f ðxÞ ¼ 1,
as seems clear from the graph. To prove this we must
show that given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that
j f ðxÞ  1j <  whenever 0 < x  1 < .
Now since x > 1, f ðxÞ ¼ 1 and so the proof con-
sists
in
the
triviality
that
j1  1j < 
whenever
0 < x  1 < .
(c)
As

f ðxÞ ! 1,
i.e.,
lim

A proof can be formulated as in (b).

Since lim

x!3 f ðxÞ, lim
x!3 f ðxÞ does not exist.

Prove that lim
x!0 x sin 1=x ¼ 0.
We must show that given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that jx sin 1=x  0j <  when
0 < jx  0j < .
If 0 < jxj < , then jx sin 1=xj ¼ jxjj sin 1=xj @ jxj <  since j sin 1=xj @ 1 for all x 6¼ 0.
Making the choice  ¼ , we see that jx sin 1=xj <  when 0 < jxj < , completing the proof.
3.14.
Evaluate lim
x!0þ

1 þ e1=x.
As x ! 0þ we suspect that 1=x increases indeﬁnitely, e1=x increases indeﬁnitely, e1=x approaches 0,
1 þ e1=x approaches 1; thus the required limit is 2.
To prove this conjecture we must show that, given  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that

Note that in (c), (d), and (e) if we use the theorems on limits indiscriminately we obtain the so
called indeterminate forms 1=1 and 0/0. To avoid such predicaments, note that in each case the form
of the limit is suitably modiﬁed.

CONTINUITY
(Assume that values at which continuity is to be demonstrated, are interior domain values unless
otherwise stated.)
3.21.
Prove that f ðxÞ ¼ x2 is continuous at x ¼ 2.
Method 1:
By Problem 3.10, lim
x!2 f ðxÞ ¼ f ð2Þ ¼ 4 and so f ðxÞ is continuous at x ¼ 2.
Method 2:
We must show that given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 (depending on ) such that
j f ðxÞ  f ð2Þj ¼ jx2  4j <  when jx  2j < .

x ¼ 0

is not continuous at x ¼ 0.
(b) Can one redeﬁne f ð0Þ
so that f ðxÞ is continuous at x ¼ 0?
(a)
From Problem 3.13, lim
x!0 f ðxÞ ¼ 0.
But this limit is not equal to f ð0Þ ¼ 5, so that f ðxÞ is discontinuous
at x ¼ 0.
(b)
By redeﬁning f ðxÞ so that f ð0Þ ¼ 0, the function becomes continuous.
Because the function can be
made continuous at a point simply by redeﬁning the function at the point, we call the point a removable
discontinuity.
3.23.
Is the function f ðxÞ ¼ 2x4  6x3 þ x2 þ 3
x  1
continuous at x ¼ 1?
f ð1Þ does not exist, so that f ðxÞ is not continuous at x ¼ 1.
By redeﬁning f ðxÞ so that f ð1Þ ¼ lim
x!1
f ðxÞ ¼ 8 (see Problem 3.11), it becomes continuous at x ¼ 1, i.e., x ¼ 1 is a removable discontinuity.

These results follow at once from the proofs given in Problem 3.19 by taking A ¼ f ðx0Þ and B ¼ gðx0Þ

Prove that f ðxÞ ¼ x is continuous at any point x ¼ x0.
We must show that, given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that j f ðxÞ  f ðx0Þj ¼ jx  x0j <  when

By choosing  ¼ , the result follows at once.

UNIFORM CONTINUITY
3.29.
Prove that f ðxÞ ¼ x2 is uniformly continuous in 0 < x < 1.
Method 1:
Using deﬁnition.
We must show that given any  > 0 we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that jx2  x2
0j <  when jx  x0j < , where 
depends only on  and not on x0 where 0 < x0 < 1.
If x and x0 are any points in 0 < x < 1, then
jx2  x2
0j ¼ jx þ x0jjx  x0j < j1 þ 1jjx  x0j ¼ 2jx  x0j
Thus if jx  x0j <  it follows that jx2  x2
0j < 2.
Choosing  ¼ =2, we see that jx2  x2
0j <  when
jx  x0j < , where  depends only on  and not on x0.
Hence, f ðxÞ ¼ x2 is uniformly continuous in
0 < x < 1.
The above can be used to prove that f ðxÞ ¼ x2 is uniformly continuous in 0 @ x @1.
Method 2:
The function f ðxÞ ¼ x2 is continuous in the closed interval 0 @ x @ 1.
Hence, by the theorem
on Page 48 is uniformly continuous in 0 @ x @ 1 and thus in 0 < x < 1.
3.30.
Prove that f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x is not uniformly continuous in 0 < x < 1.
Method 1:
Suppose f ðxÞ is uniformly continuous in the given interval.
Then for any  > 0 we should be
able to ﬁnd , say, between 0 and 1, such that j f ðxÞ  f ðx0Þj <  when jx  x0j <  for all x and x0 in the
interval.
Let x ¼  and x0 ¼

(since 0 <  < 1Þ:
Thus, we have a contradiction and it follows that f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x cannot be uniformly continuous in
0 < x < 1.
Method 2:
Let x0 and x0 þ  be any two points in ð0; 1Þ.
Then
j f ðx0Þ  f ðx0 þ Þj ¼

If y ¼ f ðxÞ is continuous at x ¼ x0, and z ¼ gðyÞ is continuous at y ¼ y0 where y0 ¼ f ðx0Þ, prove
that z ¼ gf f ðxÞg is continuous at x ¼ x0.
Let hðxÞ ¼ gf f ðxÞg.
Since by hypothesis f ðxÞ and gð yÞ are continuous at x0 and y0, respectively, we
have
lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ f ð lim
x!x0 xÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ
lim
y!y0 gðyÞ ¼ gð lim
y!y0 yÞ ¼ gðy0Þ ¼ gf f ðx0Þg
Then
lim

x!x0 gf f ðxÞg ¼ gf lim
x!x0 f ðxÞg ¼ gf f ðx0Þg ¼ hðx0Þ

FUNCTIONS, LIMITS, AND CONTINUITY
[CHAP. 3

Suppose that f ðaÞ < 0 and f ðbÞ > 0. Since f ðxÞ is continuous there must be an interval ða; a þ hÞ, h > 0,
for which f ðxÞ < 0.
The set of points ða; a þ hÞ has an upper bound and so has a least upper bound which
we call c.
Then f ðcÞ @ 0.
Now we cannot have f ðcÞ < 0, because if f ðcÞ were negative we would be able to
ﬁnd an interval about c (including values greater than c) for which f ðxÞ < 0; but since c is the least upper
bound, this is impossible, and so we must have f ðcÞ ¼ 0 as required.
If f ðaÞ > 0 and f ðbÞ < 0, a similar argument can be used.
3.33.
(a) Given f ðxÞ ¼ 2x3  3x2 þ 7x  10, evaluate f ð1Þ and f ð2Þ.
(b) Prove that f ðxÞ ¼ 0 for some
real number x such that 1 < x < 2.
(c) Show how to calculate the value of x in (b).
(a)
f ð1Þ ¼ 2ð1Þ3  3ð1Þ2 þ 7ð1Þ  10 ¼ 4, f ð2Þ ¼ 2ð2Þ3  3ð2Þ2 þ 7ð2Þ  10 ¼ 8.
(b)
If f ðxÞ is continuous in a @ x @ b and if f ðaÞ and f ðbÞ have opposite signs, then there is a value of x
between a and b such that f ðxÞ ¼ 0 (Problem 3.32).
To apply this theorem we need only realize that the given polynomial is continuous in 1 @ x @ 2,
since we have already shown in (a) that f ð1Þ < 0 and f ð2Þ > 0. Thus there exists a number c between 1
and 2 such that f ðcÞ ¼ 0.
(c)
f ð1:5Þ ¼ 2ð1:5Þ3  3ð1:5Þ2 þ 7ð1:5Þ  10 ¼ 0:5.
Then applying the theorem of (b) again, we see that the
required root lies between 1 and 1.5 and is ‘‘most likely’’ closer to 1.5 than to 1, since f ð1:5Þ ¼ 0:5 has a
value closer to 0 than f ð1Þ ¼ 4 (this is not always a valid conclusion but is worth pursuing in practice).
Thus we consider x ¼ 1:4.
Since f ð1:4Þ ¼ 2ð1:4Þ3  3ð1:4Þ2 þ 7ð1:4Þ  10 ¼ 0:592, we conclude
that there is a root between 1.4 and 1.5 which is most likely closer to 1.5 than to 1.4.
Continuing in this manner, we ﬁnd that the root is 1.46 to 2 decimal places.
3.34.
Prove Theorem 10, Page 48.
Given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd x such that M  f ðxÞ <  by deﬁnition of the l.u.b. M.
Then
1
M  f ðxÞ > 1
, so that
1
M  f ðxÞ is not bounded and hence cannot be continuous in view of
Theorem 4, Page 47.
However, if we suppose that f ðxÞ 6¼ M, then since M  f ðxÞ is continuous, by
hypothesis, we must have
1
M  f ðxÞ also continuous.
In view of this contradiction, we must have
f ðxÞ ¼ M for at least one value of x in the interval.
Similarly, we can show that there exists an x in the interval such that f ðxÞ ¼ m (Problem 3.93).

Derivatives
THE CONCEPT AND DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE
Concepts that shape the course of mathematics are few and far between.
The derivative, the
fundamental element of the diﬀerential calculus, is such a concept.
That branch of mathematics called
analysis, of which advanced calculus is a part, is the end result. There were two problems that led to the
discovery of the derivative. The older one of deﬁning and representing the tangent line to a curve at one
of its points had concerned early Greek philosophers.
The other problem of representing the instanta-
neous velocity of an object whose motion was not constant was much more a problem of the seventeenth
century.
At the end of that century, these problems and their relationship were resolved.
As is usually
the case, many mathematicians contributed, but it was Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
who independently put together organized bodies of thought upon which others could build.
The tangent problem provides a visual interpretation of the derivative and can be brought to mind
no matter what the complexity of a particular application.
It leads to the deﬁnition of the derivative as
the limit of a diﬀerence quotient in the following way.
(See Fig. 4-1.)
Let Poðx0Þ be a point on the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ. Let PðxÞ be a nearby point on this same graph of the
function f . Then the line through these two points is called a secant line. Its slope, ms, is the diﬀerence
quotient
ms ¼ f ðxÞ  f ðx0Þ
x  x0
¼ y
x
Fig. 4-1
Copyright 2002, 1963 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use.

where x and y are called the increments in x and y, respectively.
Also this slope may be written
ms ¼ f ðx0 þ hÞ  f ðx0Þ
h
where h ¼ x  x0 ¼ x.
See Fig. 4-2.
We can imagine a sequence of lines formed as h ! 0.
It is the limiting line of this sequence that is
the natural one to be the tangent line to the graph at P0.
To make this mode of reasoning precise, the limit (when it exists), is formed as follows:
f 0ðxÞ ¼ lim
h!0
f ðx0 þ hÞ  f ðx0Þ
h
As indicated, this limit is given the name f 0ðx0Þ.
It is called the derivative of the function f at its
domain value x0.
If this limit can be formed at each point of a subdomain of the domain of f , then f is
said to be diﬀerentiable on that subdomain and a new function f 0 has been constructed.
This limit concept was not understood until the middle of the nineteenth century. A simple example
illustrates the conceptual problem that faced mathematicians from 1700 until that time.
Let the graph
of f be the parabola y ¼ x2, then a little algebraic manipulation yields
ms ¼ 2x0h þ h2
h
¼ 2x0 þ h
Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries simply let h ¼ 0 and said that 2x0 was the slope of the
tangent line at P0. However, this raises the ghost of a 0
0 form in the middle term. True understanding of
the calculus is in the comprehension of how the introduction of something new (the derivative, i.e., the
limit of a diﬀerence quotient) resolves this dilemma.
Note 1:
The creation of new functions from diﬀerence quotients is not limited to f 0.
If, starting
with f 0, the limit of the diﬀerence quotient exists, then f 00 may be constructed and so on and so on.
Note 2:
Since the continuity of a function is such a strong property, one might think that diﬀer-
entiability followed.
This is not necessarily true, as is illustrated in Fig. 4-3.
The following theorem puts the matter in proper perspective:
Theorem:
If f is diﬀerentiable at a domain value, then it is continuous at that value.
As indicated above, the converse of this theorem is not true.

RIGHT- AND LEFT-HAND DERIVATIVES
The status of the derivative at end points of the domain of f , and in other special circumstances, is
clariﬁed by the following deﬁnitions.
The right-hand derivative of f ðxÞ at x ¼ x0 is deﬁned as
f 0
þðx0Þ ¼ lim
h!0þ
f ðx0 þ hÞ  f ðx0Þ
h
ð3Þ
if this limit exists.
Note that in this case hð¼ xÞ is restricted only to positive values as it approaches
zero.
Similarly, the left-hand derivative of f ðxÞ at x ¼ x0 is deﬁned as
f 0
ðx0Þ ¼ lim
h!0
f ðx0 þ hÞ  f ðx0Þ
h
ð4Þ
if this limit exists.
In this case h is restricted to negative values as it approaches zero.
A function f has a derivative at x ¼ x0 if and only if f 0
þðx0Þ ¼ f 0
ðx0Þ.
DIFFERENTIABILITY IN AN INTERVAL
If a function has a derivative at all points of an interval, it is said to be diﬀerentiable in the interval.
In particular if f is deﬁned in the closed interval a @ x @ b, i.e. ½a; b, then f is diﬀerentiable in the
interval if and only if f 0ðx0Þ exists for each x0 such that a < x0 < b and if f 0
þðaÞ and f 0
ðbÞ both exist.
If a function has a continuous derivative, it is sometimes called continuously diﬀerentiable.
PIECEWISE DIFFERENTIABILITY
A function is called piecewise diﬀerentiable or piecewise smooth in an interval a @ x @ b if f 0ðxÞ is
piecewise continuous.
An example of a piecewise continuous function is shown graphically on Page 48.
An equation for the tangent line to the curve y ¼ f ðxÞ at the point where x ¼ x0 is given by
y  f ðx0Þ ¼ f 0ðx0Þðx  x0Þ
ð7Þ
The fact that a function can be continuous at a point and yet not be diﬀerentiable there is shown
graphically in Fig. 4-3. In this case there are two tangent lines at P represented by PM and PN.
The
slopes of these tangent lines are f 0
ðx0Þ and f 0
þðx0Þ respectively.
DIFFERENTIALS
Let x ¼ dx be an increment given to x.
Then
y ¼ f ðx þ xÞ  f ðxÞ
ð8Þ
is called the increment in y ¼ f ðxÞ.
If f ðxÞ is continuous and has a continuous ﬁrst derivative in an
interval, then
y ¼ f 0ðxÞx þ x ¼ f 0ðxÞdx þ dx
ð9Þ
where  ! 0 as x ! 0.
The expression
dy ¼ f 0ðxÞdx
ð10Þ
is called the diﬀerential of y or f(x) or the principal part of y. Note that y 6¼ dy in general.
However
if x ¼ dx is small, then dy is a close approximation of y (see Problem 11). The quantity dx, called the
diﬀerential of x, and dy need not be small.
CHAP. 4]
DERIVATIVES

Because of the deﬁnitions (8) and (10), we often write
dy
dx ¼ f 0ðxÞ ¼ lim
x!0
f ðx þ xÞ  f ðxÞ
x
¼ lim
x!0
y
x
ð11Þ
It is emphasized that dx and dy are not the limits of x and y as x ! 0, since these limits are zero
whereas dx and dy are not necessarily zero.
Instead, given dx we determine dy from (10), i.e., dy is a
dependent variable determined from the independent variable dx for a given x.
Geometrically, dy is represented in Fig. 4-1, for the particular value x ¼ x0, by the line segment SR,
whereas y is represented by QR.
The geometric interpretation of the derivative as the slope of the tangent line to a curve at one of its
points is fundamental to its application. Also of importance is its use as representative of instantaneous
velocity in the construction of physical models.
In particular, this physical viewpoint may be used to
introduce the notion of diﬀerentials.
Newton’s Second and First Laws of Motion imply that the path of an object is determined by the
forces acting on it, and that if those forces suddenly disappear, the object takes on the tangential
direction of the path at the point of release.
Thus, the nature of the path in a small neighborhood
of the point of release becomes of interest.
With this thought in mind, consider the following idea.
Suppose the graph of a function f is represented by y ¼ f ðxÞ.
Let x ¼ x0 be a domain value at
which f 0 exists (i.e., the function is diﬀerentiable at that value). Construct a new linear function
dy ¼ f 0ðx0Þ dx
with dx as the (independent) domain variable and dy the range variable generated by this rule.
This
linear function has the graphical interpretation illustrated in Fig. 4-4.
That is, a coordinate system may be constructed with its origin at P0 and the dx and dy axes parallel
to the x and y axes, respectively. In this system our linear equation is the equation of the tangent line to
the graph at P0.
It is representative of the path in a small neighborhood of the point; and if the path is
that of an object, the linear equation represents its new path when all forces are released.
dx and dy are called diﬀerentials of x and y, respectively. Because the above linear equation is valid
at every point in the domain of f at which the function has a derivative, the subscript may be dropped
and we can write
dy ¼ f 0ðxÞ dx
The following important observations should be made.
dy
dx ¼ f 0ðxÞ ¼ lim
x!0
f ðx þ xÞ  f ðxÞ
x
¼
lim
x!0
y
x, thus dy
dx is not the same thing as y
x.

DERIVATIVES
[CHAP. 4
Fig. 4-4

On the other hand, dy and y are related.
In particular, lim
x!0
y
x ¼ f 0ðxÞ means that for any " > 0
there exists  > 0 such that " < y
x  dy
dx < " whenever jxj < .
Now dx is an independent variable
and the axes of x and dx are parallel; therefore, dx may be chosen equal to x.
With this choice
"x < y  dy < "x
or
dy  "x < y < dy þ "x
From this relation we see that dy is an approximation to y in small neighborhoods of x. dy is called
the principal part of y.
The representation of f 0 by dy
dx has an algebraic suggestiveness that is very appealing and will appear
in much of what follows.
In fact, this notation was introduced by Leibniz (without the justiﬁcation
provided by knowledge of the limit idea) and was the primary reason his approach to the calculus, rather
than Newton’s was followed.
THE DIFFERENTIATION OF COMPOSITE FUNCTIONS
Many functions are a composition of simpler ones.
For example, if f and g have the rules of
correspondence u ¼ x3 and y ¼ sin u, respectively, then y ¼ sin x3 is the rule for a composite function
F ¼ gð f Þ.
The domain of F is that subset of the domain of F whose corresponding range values are in
the domain of g. The rule of composite function diﬀerentiation is called the chain rule and is represented
by dy
dx ¼ dy
du
du
dx ½F 0ðxÞ ¼ g 0ðuÞf 0ðxÞ.
In the example
dy
dx  dðsin x3Þ
dx
¼ cos x3ð3x2dxÞ
The importance of the chain rule cannot be too greatly stressed.
Its proper application is essential
in the diﬀerentiation of functions, and it plays a fundamental role in changing the variable of integration,
as well as in changing variables in mathematical models involving diﬀerential equations.
IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
The rule of correspondence for a function may not be explicit.
For example, the rule y ¼ f ðxÞ is
implicit to the equation x2 þ 4xy5 þ 7xy þ 8 ¼ 0.
Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that this
equation can be solved for y in terms of x.
However, assuming a common domain (described by the
independent variable x) the left-hand member of the equation can be construed as a composition of
functions and diﬀerentiated accordingly.
(The rules of diﬀerentiation are listed below for your review.)
In this example, diﬀerentiation with respect to x yields
2x þ 4 y5 þ 5xy4 dy
dx


þ 7 y þ x dy
dx

¼ 0
Observe that this equation can be solved for dy
dx as a function of x and y (but not of x alone).

HIGHER ORDER DERIVATIVES
If f ðxÞ is diﬀerentiable in an interval, its derivative is given by f 0ðxÞ, y 0 or dy=dx, where y ¼ f ðxÞ. If

Similarly, the nth derivative of f ðxÞ, if it exists, is denoted by f ðnÞðxÞ, yðnÞ or dny
dxn, where n is called the
order of the derivative.
Thus derivatives of the ﬁrst, second, third, . . . orders are given by f 0ðxÞ, f 00ðxÞ,
f 000ðxÞ; . . . .
Computation of higher order derivatives follows by repeated application of the diﬀerentiation rules

MEAN VALUE THEOREMS
These theorems are fundamental to the rigorous establishment of numerous theorems and formulas.
(See Fig. 4-5.)
1.
Rolle’s theorem.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b and diﬀerentiable in ða; bÞ and if f ðaÞ ¼ f ðbÞ ¼ 0,
then there exists a point  in ða; bÞ such that f 0ðÞ ¼ 0.
Rolle’s theorem is employed in the proof of the mean value theorem.
It then becomes a
special case of that theorem.
2.
The mean value theorem.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b and diﬀerentiable in ða; bÞ, then there
exists a point  in ða; bÞ such that
f ðbÞ  f ðaÞ
b  a
¼ f 0ðÞ
a <  < b
ð16Þ
Rolle’s theorem is the special case of this where f ðaÞ ¼ f ðbÞ ¼ 0.
The result (16) can be written in various alternative forms; for example, if x and x0 are in
ða; bÞ, then
f ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0Þ þ f 0ðÞðx  x0Þ
 between x0 and x
ð17Þ
We can also write (16) with b ¼ a þ h, in which case  ¼ a þ h, where 0 <  < 1.
The mean value theorem is also called the law of the mean.
3.
Cauchy’s generalized mean value theorem.
If f ðxÞ and gðxÞ are continuous in ½a; b and diﬀer-
entiable in ða; bÞ, then there exists a point  in ða; bÞ such that
f ðbÞ  f ðaÞ
gðbÞ  gðaÞ ¼ f 0ðÞ
g 0ðÞ
a <  < b
ð18Þ
where we assume gðaÞ 6¼ gðbÞ and f 0ðxÞ, g 0ðxÞ are not simultaneously zero. Note that the special
case gðxÞ ¼ x yields (16).
L’HOSPITAL’S RULES
If lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ A and lim
x!x0 gðxÞ ¼ B, where A and B are either both zero or both inﬁnite, lim
x!x0
f ðxÞ
gðxÞ is
often called an indeterminate of the form 0/0 or 1=1, respectively, although such terminology is
somewhat misleading since there is usually nothing indeterminate involved.
The following theorems,
called L’Hospital’s rules, facilitate evaluation of such limits.
1.
If f ðxÞ and gðxÞ are diﬀerentiable in the interval ða; bÞ except possibly at a point x0 in this
interval, and if g 0ðxÞ 6¼ 0 for x 6¼ x0, then

whenever the limit on the right can be found. In case f 0ðxÞ and g 0ðxÞ satisfy the same conditions
as f ðxÞ and gðxÞ given above, the process can be repeated.
2.
If lim
x!x0 f ðxÞ ¼ 1 and lim
x!x0 gðxÞ ¼ 1, the result (19) is also valid.
These can be extended to cases where x ! 1 or 1, and to cases where x0 ¼ a or x0 ¼ b in which
only one sided limits, such as x ! aþ or x ! b, are involved.
Limits represented by the so-called indeterminate forms 0  1, 10, 00, 11; and 1  1 can be
evaluated on replacing them by equivalent limits for which the above rules are applicable (see Problem
4.29).
APPLICATIONS
1. Relative Extrema and Points of Inﬂection
See Chapter 3 where relative extrema and points of inﬂection were described and a diagram is
presented.
In this chapter such points are characterized by the variation of the tangent line, and
then by the derivative, which represents the slope of that line.
Assume that f has a derivative at each point of an open interval and that P1 is a point of the graph of
f associated with this interval.
Let a varying tangent line to the graph move from left to right through
P1.
If the point is a relative minimum, then the tangent line rotates counterclockwise.
The slope is
negative to the left of P1 and positive to the right.
At P1 the slope is zero.
At a relative maximum a
similar analysis can be made except that the rotation is clockwise and the slope varies from positive to
negative.
Because f 00 designates the change of f 0, we can state the following theorem.
(See Fig. 4-6.)
Theorem.
Assume that x1 is a number in an open set of the domain of f at which f 0 is continuous and
f 00 is deﬁned.
If f 0ðx1Þ ¼ 0 and f 00ðx1Þ 6¼ 0, then f ðx1Þ is a relative extreme of f .
Speciﬁcally:
(a)
If f 00ðx1Þ > 0, then f ðx1Þ is a relative minimum,
(b)
If f 00ðx1Þ < 0; then f ðx1Þ is a relative maximum.
(The domain value x1 is called a critical value.)
This theorem may be generalized in the following way.
Assume existence and continuity of
derivatives as needed and suppose that f 0ðx1Þ ¼ f 00ðx1Þ ¼    f ð2p1Þðx1Þ ¼ 0 and f ð2pÞðx1Þ 6¼ 0 ( p a posi-
tive integer). Then:
(a)
f has a relative minimum at x1 if f ð2pÞðx1Þ > 0,
(b)
f has a relative maximum at x1 if f ð2pÞðx1Þ < 0.

(Notice that the order of diﬀerentiation in each succeeding case is two greater.
The nature of the
intermediate possibilities is suggested in the next paragraph.)
It is possible that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f is positive to the left of P1, zero at the
point, and again positive to the right.
Then P1 is called a point of inﬂection.
In the simplest case this
point of inﬂection is characterized by f 0ðx1Þ ¼ 0, f 00ðx1Þ ¼ 0, and f 000ðx1Þ 6¼ 0.
2. Particle motion
The fundamental theories of modern physics are relativity, electromagnetism, and quantum
mechanics.
Yet Newtonian physics must be studied because it is basic to many of the concepts in
these other theories, and because it is most easily applied to many of the circumstances found in every-
day life.
The simplest aspect of Newtonian mechanics is called kinematics, or the geometry of motion.
In this model of reality, objects are idealized as points and their paths are represented by curves.
In the
simplest (one-dimensional) case, the curve is a straight line, and it is the speeding up and slowing down
of the object that is of importance.
The calculus applies to the study in the following way.
If x represents the distance of a particle from the origin and t signiﬁes time, then x ¼ f ðtÞ designates
the position of a particle at time t.
Instantaneous velocity (or speed in the one-dimensional case) is
represented by dx
dt ¼ lim
t!0
f ðt þ tÞ
t
(the limiting case of the formula change in distance
change in time
for speed when
the motion is constant).
Furthermore, the instantaneous change in velocity is called acceleration and
represented by d2x
dt2 .
Path, velocity, and acceleration of a particle will be represented in three dimensions in Chapter 7 on
vectors.
3. Newton’s method
It is diﬃcult or impossible to solve algebraic equations of higher degree than two. In fact, it has been
proved that there are no general formulas representing the roots of algebraic equations of degree ﬁve and
higher in terms of radicals. However, the graph y ¼ f ðxÞ of an algebraic equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0 crosses the x-
axis at each single-valued real root. Thus, by trial and error, consecutive integers can be found between
which a root lies.
Newton’s method is a systematic way of using tangents to obtain a better approx-
imation of a speciﬁc real root.
The procedure is as follows.
(See Fig. 4-7.)
Suppose that f has as many derivatives as required.
Let r be a real root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0, i.e., f ðrÞ ¼ 0.
Let x0 be a value of x near r. For example, the integer preceding or following r. Let f 0ðx0Þ be the slope
of the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ at P0½x0; f ðx0Þ.
Let Q1ðx1; 0Þ be the x-axis intercept of the tangent line at P0
then

relation for x1 is

Starting with the tangent line to the graph at P1½x1; f ðx1Þ and repeating the process, we get
x2 ¼ x1  f ðx1Þ

hood of the root.
There are various cases which have not been explored here.

Prove Rolle’s theorem.
Case 1:
f ðxÞ  0 in ½a; b.
Then f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0 for all x in ða; bÞ.
Case 2:
f ðxÞ 6 0 in ½a; b.
Since f ðxÞ is continuous there are points at which f ðxÞ attains its maximum and
minimum values, denoted by M and m respectively (see Problem 3.34, Chapter 3).
Since f ðxÞ 6 0, at least one of the values M; m is not zero.
Suppose, for example, M 6¼ 0 and that
f ðÞ ¼ M (see Fig. 4-9). For this case, f ð þ hÞ @ f ðÞ.

But by hypothesis f ðxÞ has a derivative at all points
in ða; bÞ.
Then the right-hand derivative (1) must be
equal to the left-hand derivative (2). This can happen only if they are both equal to zero, in which case
f 0ðÞ ¼ 0 as required.
A similar argument can be used in case M ¼ 0 and m 6¼ 0.

Prove the mean value theorem.
Deﬁne FðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ  f ðaÞ  ðx  aÞ f ðbÞ  f ðaÞ
b  a
.
Then FðaÞ ¼ 0 and FðbÞ ¼ 0.
Also, if f ðxÞ satisﬁes the conditions on continuity and diﬀerentiability speciﬁed in Rolle’s theorem, then
FðxÞ satisﬁes them also.
Then applying Rolle’s theorem to the function FðxÞ, we obtain
F 0ðÞ ¼ f 0ðÞ  f ðbÞ  f ðaÞ
b  a

a <  < b

f ð2Þ ¼ 4, f ð5Þ ¼ 25, f 0ðÞ ¼ 4  7.
Then the mean value theorem states that 4  7 ¼ ð25  4Þ=ð5  2Þ
or  ¼ 3:5.
Since 2 <  < 5, the theorem is veriﬁed.
4.22.
If f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0 at all points of the interval ða; bÞ, prove that f ðxÞ must be a constant in the interval.
Let x1 < x2 be any two diﬀerent points in ða; bÞ.
By the mean value theorem for x1 <  < x2,
f ðx2Þ  f ðx1Þ
x2  x1
¼ f 0ðÞ ¼ 0
Thus, f ðx1Þ ¼ f ðx2Þ ¼ constant.
From this it follows that if two functions have the same derivative at all
points of ða; bÞ, the functions can only diﬀer by a constant.
4.23.
If f 0ðxÞ > 0 at all points of the interval ða; bÞ, prove that f ðxÞ is strictly increasing.
Let x1 < x2 be any two diﬀerent points in ða; bÞ. By the mean value theorem for x1 <  < x2,
f ðx2Þ  f ðx1Þ
x2  x1
¼ f 0ðÞ > 0
Then f ðx2Þ > f ðx1Þ for x2 > x1, and so f ðxÞ is strictly increasing.

Then GðxÞ satisﬁes the conditions

Both latter conditions are satisﬁed if the constant 	 ¼ f ðbÞ  f ðaÞ

a < x0 < b.

Find the length of the longest ladder which can be carried around the corner of a corridor, whose
dimensions are indicated in the ﬁgure below, if it is assumed that the ladder is carried parallel to
the ﬂoor.
The length of the longest ladder is the same as the shortest
straight line segment AB [Fig. 4-10], which touches both outer
walls and the corner formed by the inner walls.
As seen from Fig. 4-10, the length of the ladder AB is

Integrals
INTRODUCTION OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
The geometric problems that motivated the development of the integral calculus (determination of
lengths, areas, and volumes) arose in the ancient civilizations of Northern Africa. Where solutions were
found, they related to concrete problems such as the measurement of a quantity of grain.
Greek
philosophers took a more abstract approach.
In fact, Eudoxus (around 400 B.C.) and Archimedes
(250 B.C.) formulated ideas of integration as we know it today.
Integral calculus developed independently, and without an obvious connection to diﬀerential
calculus. The calculus became a ‘‘whole’’ in the last part of the seventeenth century when Isaac Barrow,
Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (with help from others) discovered that the integral of a
function could be found by asking what was diﬀerentiated to obtain that function.
The following introduction of integration is the usual one. It displays the concept geometrically and
then deﬁnes the integral in the nineteenth-century language of limits. This form of deﬁnition establishes
the basis for a wide variety of applications.
Consider the area of the region bound by y ¼ f ðxÞ, the x-axis, and the joining vertical segments
(ordinates) x ¼ a and x ¼ b.
(See Fig. 5-1.)

Subdivide the interval a @ x @ b into n sub-intervals by means of the points x1; x2; . . . ; xn1 chosen
arbitrarily.
In each of the new intervals ða; x1Þ; ðx1; x2Þ; . . . ; ðxn1; bÞ choose points 1; 2; . . . ; n
arbitrarily.
Form the sum
f ð1Þðx1  aÞ þ f ð2Þðx2  x1Þ þ f ð3Þðx3  x2Þ þ    þ f ðnÞðb  xn1Þ
ð1Þ
By writing x0 ¼ a, xn ¼ b; and xk  xk1 ¼ xk, this can be written
X
n
k¼1
f ðkÞðxk  xk1Þ ¼
X
n
k¼1
f ðkÞxk
ð2Þ
Geometrically, this sum represents the total area of all rectangles in the above ﬁgure.
We now let the number of subdivisions n increase in such a way that each xk ! 0.
If as a result
the sum (1) or (2) approaches a limit which does not depend on the mode of subdivision, we denote this
limit by
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx ¼ lim
n!1
X
n
k¼1
f ðkÞxk
ð3Þ
This is called the deﬁnite integral of f ðxÞ between a and b.
In this symbol f ðxÞ dx is called the integrand,
and ½a; b is called the range of integration.
We call a and b the limits of integration, a being the lower
limit of integration and b the upper limit.
The limit (3) exists whenever f ðxÞ is continuous (or piecewise continuous) in a @ x @ b (see Problem
5.31). When this limit exists we say that f is Riemann integrable or simply integrable in ½a; b.
The deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral as the limit of a sum was established by Cauchy around 1825.
It was named for Riemann because he made extensive use of it in this 1850 exposition of integration.
Geometrically the value of this deﬁnite integral represents the area bounded by the curve y ¼ f ðxÞ,
the x-axis and the ordinates at x ¼ a and x ¼ b only if f ðxÞ A 0.
If f ðxÞ is sometimes positive and
sometimes negative, the deﬁnite integral represents the algebraic sum of the areas above and below the x-
axis, treating areas above the x-axis as positive and areas below the x-axis as negative.
MEASURE ZERO
A set of points on the x-axis is said to have measure zero if the sum of the lengths of intervals
enclosing all the points can be made arbitrary small (less than any given positive number ). We can
show (see Problem 5.6) that any countable set of points on the real axis has measure zero. In particular,
the set of rational numbers which is countable (see Problems 1.17 and 1.59, Chapter 1), has measure
zero.
An important theorem in the theory of Riemann integration is the following:
Theorem.
If f ðxÞ is bounded in ½a; b, then a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of
Ð b

MEAN VALUE THEOREMS FOR INTEGRALS
As in diﬀerential calculus the mean value theorems listed below are existence theorems.
The ﬁrst
one generalizes the idea of ﬁnding an arithmetic mean (i.e., an average value of a given set of values) to a
continuous function over an interval.
The second mean value theorem is an extension of the ﬁrst one
that deﬁnes a weighted average of a continuous function.
By analogy, consider determining the arithmetic mean (i.e., average value) of temperatures at noon
for a given week.
This question is resolved by recording the 7 temperatures, adding them, and dividing
by 7.
To generalize from the notion of arithmetic mean and ask for the average temperature for the
week is much more complicated because the spectrum of temperatures is now continuous.
However, it
is reasonable to believe that there exists a time at which the average temperature takes place.
The
manner in which the integral can be employed to resolve the question is suggested by the following
example.
Let f be continuous on the closed interval a @ x @ b.
Assume the function is represented by the
correspondence y ¼ f ðxÞ, with f ðxÞ > 0.
Insert points of equal subdivision, a ¼ x0; x1; . . . ; xn ¼ b.
Then all xk ¼ xk  xk1 are equal and each can be designated by x.
Observe that b  a ¼ nx.
Let k be the midpoint of the interval xk and f ðkÞ the value of f there.
Then the average of these
functional values is

This sum speciﬁes the average value of the n functions at the midpoints of the intervals.

[CHAP. 5

Of course, the question of for what value x ¼  the average is attained is not answered; and, in fact,
in general, only existence not the value can be demonstrated. To see that there is a point x ¼  such that
f ðÞ represents the average value of f on ½a; b, recall that a continuous function on a closed interval has
maximum and minimum values, M and m, respectively.
Thus (think of the integral as representing the
area under the curve).

CONNECTING INTEGRAL AND DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
In the late seventeenth century the key relationship between the derivative and the integral was
established. The connection which is embodied in the fundamental theorem of calculus was responsible
for the creation of a whole new branch of mathematics called analysis.
Deﬁnition:
Any function F such that F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ is called an antiderivative, primitive, or indeﬁnite
integral of f .
The antiderivative of a function is not unique.
This is clear from the observation that for any
constant c
ðFðxÞ þ cÞ 0 ¼ F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ
The following theorem is an even stronger statement.
Theorem.
Any two primitives (i.e., antiderivatives), F and G of f diﬀer at most by a constant, i.e.,
FðxÞ  GðxÞ ¼ C.
(See the problem set for the proof of this theorem.)
EXAMPLE.
If F 0ðxÞ ¼ x2, then FðxÞ ¼
ð
x2dx ¼ x3
3 þ c is an indeﬁnite integral (antiderivative or primitive) of x2.
The indeﬁnite integral (which is a function) may be expressed as a deﬁnite integral by writing
ð
f ðxÞ dx ¼
ðx
c
f ðtÞ dt
The functional character is expressed through the upper limit of the deﬁnite integral which appears
on the right-hand side of the equation.
This notation also emphasizes that the deﬁnite integral of a given function only depends on the limits
of integration, and thus any symbol may be used as the variable of integration.
For this reason, that
variable is often called a dummy variable.
The indeﬁnite integral notation on the left depends on
continuity of f on a domain that is not described.
One can visualize the deﬁnite integral on the
right by thinking of the dummy variable t as ranging over a subinterval ½c; x. (There is nothing unique
about the letter t; any other convenient letter may represent the dummy variable.)
The previous terminology and explanation set the stage for the fundamental theorem. It is stated in
two parts.
The ﬁrst states that the antiderivative of f is a new function, the integrand of which is the
derivative of that function.
Part two demonstrates how that primitive function (antiderivative) enables
us to evaluate deﬁnite integrals.
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF THE CALCULUS
Part 1
Let f be integrable on a closed interval ½a; b.
Let c satisfy the condition a @ c @ b, and
deﬁne a new function
FðxÞ ¼
ðx
c
f ðtÞ dt if a @ x @ b
Then the derivative F 0ðxÞ exists at each point x in the open interval ða; bÞ, where f is continuous and
F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ.
(See Problem 5.10 for proof of this theorem.)
Part 2
As in Part 1, assume that f is integrable on the closed interval ½a; b and continuous in the
open interval ða; bÞ.
Let F be any antiderivative so that F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ for each x in ða; bÞ.
If a < c < b,
then for any x in ða; bÞ
ðx
c
f ðtÞ dt ¼ FðxÞ  FðcÞ
94
INTEGRALS
[CHAP. 5

If the open interval on which f is continuous includes a and b, then we may write
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx ¼ FðbÞ  FðaÞ:
(See Problem 5.11)
This is the usual form in which the theorem is used.
EXAMPLE.
To

we

that
F 0ðxÞ ¼ x2,
FðxÞ ¼ x3

Since c subtracts out of this evaluation it is convenient to exclude it and simply write 23

GENERALIZATION OF THE LIMITS OF INTEGRATION
The upper and lower limits of integration may be variables.
For example:
ðcos x
sin x
t dt ¼
t2
2
" #cos x
sin x
¼ ðcos2 x  sin2 xÞ=2
In general, if F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ then
ðvðxÞ
uðxÞ
f ðtÞ dt ¼ F½vðxÞ ¼ F½uðxÞ
CHANGE OF VARIABLE OF INTEGRATION
If a determination of
Ð
f ðxÞ dx is not immediately obvious in terms of elementary functions, useful
results may be obtained by changing the variable from x to t according to the transformation x ¼ gðtÞ.
(This change of integrand that follows is suggested by the diﬀerential relation dx ¼ g 0ðtÞ dt.) The funda-
mental theorem enabling us to do this is summarized in the statement
ð
f ðxÞ dx ¼
ð
f fgðtÞgg 0ðtÞ dt
ð6Þ
where after obtaining the indeﬁnite integral on the right we replace t by its value in terms of x, i.e.,
t ¼ g1ðxÞ.
This result is analogous to the chain rule for diﬀerentiation (see Page 69).
The corresponding theorem for deﬁnite integrals is
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx ¼
ð
	
f fgðtÞgg 0ðtÞ dt
ð7Þ
where gð	Þ ¼ a and gð
Þ ¼ b, i.e., 	 ¼ g1ðaÞ, 
 ¼ g1ðbÞ.
This result is certainly valid if f ðxÞ is con-
tinuous in ½a; b and if gðtÞ is continuous and has a continuous derivative in 	 @ t @ 
.
INTEGRALS OF ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS
The following results can be demonstrated by diﬀerentiating both sides to produce an identity.
In
each case an arbitrary constant c (which has been omitted here) should be added.

SPECIAL METHODS OF INTEGRATION
1.
Integration by parts.
Let u and v be diﬀerentiable functions.
According to the product rule for diﬀerentials
dðuvÞ ¼ u dv þ v du
Upon taking the antiderivative of both sides of the equation, we obtain
uv ¼
ð
u dv þ
ð
v du
This is the formula for integration by parts when written in the form
ð
u dv ¼ uv 
ð
v du
or
ð
f ðxÞg 0ðxÞ dx ¼ f ðxÞgðxÞ 
ð
f 0ðxÞgðxÞ dx
where u ¼ f ðxÞ and v ¼ gðxÞ.
The corresponding result for deﬁnite integrals over the interval
½a; b is certainly valid if f ðxÞ and gðxÞ are continuous and have continuous derivatives in ½a; b.
See Problems 5.17 to 5.19.
2.
Partial fractions.
Any rational function PðxÞ
QðxÞ where PðxÞ and QðxÞ are polynomials, with the
degree of PðxÞ less than that of QðxÞ, can be written as the sum of rational functions having the
form
A
ðax þ bÞr,
Ax þ B
ðax2 þ bx þ cÞr where r ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . which can always be integrated in terms of
elementary functions.

The constants, A, B, C, etc., can be found by clearing of fractions and equating coeﬃcients of like powers of x
on both sides of the equation or by using special methods (see Problem 5.20).
3.
Rational functions of sin x and cos x can always be integrated in terms of elementary functions by
the substitution tan x=2 ¼ u (see Problem 5.21).
4.
Special devices depending on the particular form of the integrand are often employed (see
Problems 5.22 and 5.23).
IMPROPER INTEGRALS
If the range of integration ½a; b is not ﬁnite or if f ðxÞ is not deﬁned or not bounded at one or more
points of ½a; b, then the integral of f ðxÞ over this range is called an improper integral.
By use of
appropriate limiting operations, we may deﬁne the integrals in such cases.

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR EVALUATING DEFINITE INTEGRALS
Numerical methods for evaluating deﬁnite integrals are available in case the integrals cannot be
evaluated exactly.
The following special numerical methods are based on subdividing the interval ½a; b
into n equal parts of length x ¼ ðb  aÞ=n.
For simplicity we denote f ða þ kxÞ ¼ f ðxkÞ by yk, where
k ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; n.
The symbol  means ‘‘approximately equal.’’ In general, the approximation
improves as n increases.
1.
Rectangular rule.

a
f ðxÞ dx  xfy0 þ y1 þ y2 þ    þ yn1g
or
xf y1 þ y2 þ y3 þ    þ yng
ð8Þ
The geometric interpretation is evident from the ﬁgure on Page 90.
When left endpoint
function values y0; y1; . . . ; yn1 are used, the rule is called ‘‘the left-hand rule.’’ Similarly, when
right endpoint evaluations are employed, it is called ‘‘the right-hand rule.’’
2.
Trapezoidal rule.
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx  x
2 f y0 þ 2y1 þ 2y2 þ    þ 2yn1 þ yng
ð9Þ
This is obtained by taking the mean of the approximations in (8).
Geometrically this
replaces the curve y ¼ f ðxÞ by a set of approximating line segments.
3.
Simpson’s rule.

f ðxÞ dx  x
3 f y0 þ 4y1 þ 2y2 þ 4y3 þ 2y4 þ 4y5 þ    þ 2yn2 þ 4yn1 þ yng
ð10Þ
The above formula is obtained by approximating the graph of y ¼ gðxÞ by a set of parabolic
arcs of the form y ¼ ax2 þ bx þ c.
The correlation of two observations lead to 10. First,
ðh
h
½ax2 þ bx þ c dx ¼ h
3 ½2ah2 þ 6c
The second observation is related to the fact that the vertical parabolas employed here are
determined by three nonlinear points.
In particular, consider ðh; y0Þ, ð0; y1Þ, ðh; y2Þ then
y0 ¼ aðhÞ2 þ bðhÞ þ c, y1 ¼ c, y2 ¼ ah2 þ bh þ c.
Consequently, y0 þ 4y1 þ y2 ¼ 2ah2 þ 6c.
Thus, this combination of ordinate values (corresponding to equally space domain values) yields
the area bound by the parabola, vertical segments, and the x-axis. Now these ordinates may be
interpreted as those of the function, f , whose integral is to be approximated.
Then, as illu-
strated in Fig. 5-3:

3 ½yk1 þ 4yk þ ykþ1 ¼ x
3 ½ y0 þ 4y1 þ 2y2 þ 4y3 þ 2y4 þ 4y5 þ    þ 2yn2 þ 4yn1 þ yn
The Simpson rule is likely to give a better approximation than the others for smooth curves.
APPLICATIONS
The use of the integral as a limit of a sum enables us to solve many physical or geometrical problems
such as determination of areas, volumes, arc lengths, moments of intertia, centroids, etc.

ARC LENGTH
As you walk a twisting mountain trail, it is possible to determine the distance covered by using a
pedometer.
To create a geometric model of this event, it is necessary to describe the trail and a method
of measuring distance along it.
The trail might be referred to as a path, but in more exacting geometric
terminology the word, curve is appropriate.
That segment to be measured is an arc of the curve.
The
arc is subject to the following restrictions:
1.
It does not intersect itself (i.e., it is a simple arc).
2.
There is a tangent line at each point.
3.
The tangent line varies continuously over the arc.
These conditions are satisﬁed with a parametric representation x ¼ f ðtÞ; y ¼ gðtÞ; z ¼ hðtÞ; a @ t @ b,
where the functions f , g, and h have continuous derivatives that do not simultaneously vanish at any
point.
This arc is in Euclidean three space and will be discussed in Chapter 10.
In this introduction to
curves and their arc length, we let z ¼ 0, thereby restricting the discussion to the plane.
A careful examination of your walk would reveal movement on a sequence of straight segments,
each changed in direction from the previous one.
This suggests that the length of the arc of a curve is
obtained as the limit of a sequence of lengths of polygonal approximations.
(The polygonal approx-
imations are characterized by the number of divisions n ! 1 and no subdivision is bound from zero.
(See Fig. 5-4.)
Geometrically, the measurement of the kth segment of the arc, 0 @ t @ s, is accomplished by
employing the Pythagorean theorem, and thus, the measure is deﬁned by

AREA
Area was a motivating concept in introducing the integral.
Since many applications of the integral
are geometrically interpretable in the context of area, an extended formula is listed and illustrated below.
Let f and g be continuous functions whose graphs intersect at the graphical points corresponding to
x ¼ a and x ¼ b, a < b.
If gðxÞ A f ðxÞ on ½a; b, then the area bounded by f ðxÞ and gðxÞ is
A ¼

about the x-axis has the volume

This method of generating a volume is called the disk method because the cross sections of revolution
are circular disks.
(See Fig. 5-5(a).)

A solid cone is generated by revolving the graph of y ¼ kx, k > 0 and 0 @ x @ b, about the x-axis.
Its volume is

Suppose f is a continuous function on ½a; b, a A 0, satisfying the condition f ðxÞ A 0. Let R be a
plane region bound by f ðxÞ, x ¼ a, x ¼ b, and the x-axis. The volume obtained by orbiting R about the
y-axis is
V ¼
ðb
a
2x f ðxÞ dx
This method of generating a volume is called the shell method because of the cylindrical nature of the
vertical lines of revolution.
(See Fig. 5-5(b).)
EXAMPLE.
If the region bounded by y ¼ kx, 0 @ x @ b and x ¼ b (with the same conditions as in the previous
example) is orbited about the y-axis the volume obtained is
V ¼ 2
ðb

By comparing this example with that in the section on the disk method, it is clear that for the same
plane region the disk method and the shell method produce diﬀerent solids and hence diﬀerent volumes.
Moment of Inertia
Moment of inertia is an important physical concept that can be studied through its idealized geo-
metric form.
This form is abstracted in the following way from the physical notions of kinetic energy,
K ¼ 1
2 mv2, and angular velocity, v ¼ !r.
(m represents mass and v signiﬁes linear velocity).
Upon
substituting for v
K ¼ 1
2 m!2r2 ¼ 1
2 ðmr2Þ!2
When this form is compared to the original representation of kinetic energy, it is reasonable to
identify mr2 as rotational mass.
It is this quantity, l ¼ mr2 that we call the moment of inertia.
Then in a purely geometric sense, we denote a plane region R described through continuous func-
tions f and g on ½a; b, where a > 0 and f ðxÞ and gðxÞ intersect at a and b only.
For simplicity, assume
gðxÞ A f ðxÞ > 0.
Then

MEAN VALUE THEOREMS FOR INTEGRALS

Given the right triangle pictured in Fig. 5-6:
(a) Find the
average value of h. (b) At what point does this average value
occur?
(c) Determine
the
average
value
of
f ðxÞ ¼ sin1 x; 0 @ x @ 1

(Use integration by parts.)
(d) Determine the average value of f ðxÞ ¼ cos2 x; 0 @ x @ 

(a)
hðxÞ ¼ H
B x. According to the mean value theorem for integrals,
the average value of the function h on the interval ½0; B is
A ¼ 1
B
ðB
0
H
B x dx ¼ H
2
(b)
The point, , at which the average value of h occurs may be obtained by equating f ðÞ with that average
value, i.e., H
B  ¼ H
2 .
Thus,  ¼ B

FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF THE CALCULUS
5.10.
If FðxÞ ¼
ðx

f ðtÞ dt where f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b, prove that F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ.

h
ðxþh

f ðtÞ dt
¼ f ðÞ
 between x and x þ h
by the ﬁrst mean value theorem for integrals (Page 93).
Then if x is any point interior to ½a; b,
F 0ðxÞ ¼ lim
h!0
Fðx þ hÞ  FðxÞ
h
¼ lim
h!0 f ðÞ ¼ f ðxÞ
since f is continuous.
If x ¼ a or x ¼ b, we use right- or left-hand limits, respectively, and the result holds in these cases as
well.
5.11.
Prove the fundamental theorem of the calculus, Part 2 (Pages 94 and 95).
By Problem 5.10, if FðxÞ is any function whose derivative is f ðxÞ, we can write
FðxÞ ¼
ðx
a
f ðtÞ dt þ c
where c is any constant (see last line of Problem 22, Chapter 4).
Since FðaÞ ¼ c, it follows that FðbÞ ¼
ðb
a
f ðtÞ dt þ FðaÞ or
ðb
a
f ðtÞ dt ¼ FðbÞ  FðaÞ.
5.12.
If f ðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b, prove that FðxÞ ¼
ðx
a
f ðtÞ dt is continuous in ½a; b.
If x is any point interior to ½a; b, then as in Problem 5.10,
lim
h!0 Fðx þ hÞ  FðxÞ ¼ lim
h!0 h f ðÞ ¼ 0
and FðxÞ is continuous.
If x ¼ a and x ¼ b, we use right- and left-hand limits, respectively, to show that FðxÞ is continuous at
x ¼ a and x ¼ b.

INTEGRALS

Another method:
By Problem 5.10 and Problem 4.3, Chapter 4, it follows that F 0ðxÞ exists and so FðxÞ must be con-
tinuous.
CHANGE OF VARIABLES AND SPECIAL METHODS OF INTEGRATION
5.13.
Prove the result (7), Page 95, for changing the variable of integration.
Let FðxÞ ¼
ðx
a
f ðxÞ dx and GðtÞ ¼
ðt
	
f fgðtÞg g 0ðtÞ dt, where x ¼ gðtÞ.
Then dF ¼ f ðxÞ dx, dG ¼ f fgðtÞg g 0ðtÞ dt.
Since dx ¼ g 0ðtÞ dt, it follows that f ðxÞ dx ¼ f fgðtÞg g 0ðtÞ dt so that dFðxÞ ¼ dGðtÞ, from which
FðxÞ ¼ GðtÞ þ c.
Now when x ¼ a, t ¼ 	 or FðaÞ ¼ Gð	Þ þ c.
But FðaÞ ¼ Gð	Þ ¼ 0, so that c ¼ 0.
Hence FðxÞ ¼ GðtÞ.
Since x ¼ b when t ¼ 
, we have
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx ¼
ð
	
f fgðtÞg g 0ðtÞ dt
as required.

Let f ðxÞ ¼ 1=ð1 þ x2Þ.

Then

Let  ¼

f ðkÞ xk, using the notation of Page 91. Since f ðxÞ is continuous we can ﬁnd numbers Mk
and mk representing the l.u.b. and g.l.b. of f ðxÞ in the interval ½xk1; xk, i.e., such that mk @ f ðxÞ @ Mk.
We then have
mðb  aÞ @ s ¼

Mkxk ¼ S @ Mðb  aÞ
ð1Þ
where m and M are the g.l.b. and l.u.b. of f ðxÞ in ½a; b. The sums s and S are sometimes called the lower and
upper sums, respectively.
Now choose a second mode of subdivision of ½a; b and consider the corresponding lower and upper
sums denoted by s 0 and S 0 respectively.
We have must
s 0 @ S
and
S 0 A s
ð2Þ
To prove this we choose a third mode of subdivision obtained by using the division points of both the ﬁrst
and second modes of subdivision and consider the corresponding lower and upper sums, denoted by t and T,
respectively.
By Problem 5.84, we have
s @ t @ T @ S 0
and
s 0 @ t @ T @ S
ð3Þ
which proves (2).
From (2) it is also clear that as the number of subdivisions is increased, the upper sums are monotonic
decreasing and the lower sums are monotonic increasing.
Since according to (1) these sums are also
bounded, it follows that they have limiting values which we shall call s and S respectively.
By Problem
5.85, s @ S.
In order to prove that the integral exists, we must show that s ¼ S.
Since f ðxÞ is continuous in the closed interval ½a; b, it is uniformly continuous.
Then given any  > 0,
we can take each xk so small that Mk  mk < =ðb  aÞ.
It follows that
S  s ¼
X
n
k¼1
ðMk  mkÞxk <

b  a
X
n
k¼1
xk ¼ 
ð4Þ
Now S  s ¼ ðS  SÞ þ ðS  sÞ þ ðs  sÞ and it follows that each term in parentheses is positive and so is less
than  by (4).
In particular, since S  s is a deﬁnite number it must be zero, i.e., S ¼ s.
Thus, the limits of
the upper and lower sums are equal and the proof is complete.

Partial Derivatives
FUNCTIONS OF TWO OR MORE VARIABLES
The deﬁnition of a function was given in Chapter 3 (page 39). For us the distinction for functions of
two or more variables is that the domain is a set of n-tuples of numbers.
The range remains one
dimensional and is referred to an interval of numbers.
If n ¼ 2, the domain is pictured as a two-
dimensional region.
The region is referred to a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system described
through number pairs ðx; yÞ, and the range variable is usually denoted by z.
The domain variables are
independent while the range variable is dependent.
We use the notation f ðx; yÞ, Fðx; yÞ, etc., to denote the value of the function at ðx; yÞ and write
z ¼ f ðx; yÞ, z ¼ Fðx; yÞ, etc.
We shall also sometimes use the notation z ¼ zðx; yÞ although it should be
understood that in this case z is used in two senses, namely as a function and as a variable.
EXAMPLE.
If f ðx; yÞ ¼ x2 þ 2y3, then f ð3; 1Þ ¼ ð3Þ2 þ 2ð1Þ3 ¼ 7:
The concept is easily extended.
Thus w ¼ Fðx; y; zÞ denotes the value of a function at ðx; y; zÞ [a
point in three-dimensional space], etc.
EXAMPLE.
If z ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1  ðx2 þ y2Þ
p
, the domain for which z is real consists of the set of points ðx; yÞ such that
x2 þ y2 @ 1, i.e., the set of points inside and on a circle in the xy plane having center at ð0; 0Þ and radius 1.
THREE-DIMENSIONAL RECTANGULAR COORDINATE SYSTEMS
A three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system, as referred to in the previous paragraph,
obtained by constructing three mutually perpendicular axes (the x-, y-, and z-axes) intersecting in
point O (the origin).
It forms a natural extension of the usual xy plane for representing functions of
two variables graphically.
A point in three dimensions is represented by the triplet ðx; y; zÞ called
coordinates of the point.
In this coordinate system z ¼ f ðx; yÞ [or Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0] represents a surface,
in general.
EXAMPLE.
The set of points ðx; y; zÞ such that z ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1  ðx2 þ y2Þ
p
comprises the surface of a hemisphere of radius
1 and center at ð0; 0; 0Þ.
For functions of more than two variables such geometric interpretation fails, although the termi-
nology is still employed. For example, ðx; y; z; wÞ is a point in four-dimensional space, and w ¼ f ðx; y; zÞ
[or Fðx; y; z; wÞ ¼ 0] represents a hypersurface in four dimensions; thus x2 þ y2 þ z2 þ w2 ¼ a2 represents
a hypersphere in four dimensions with radius a > 0 and center at ð0; 0; 0; 0Þ. w ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a2  ðx2 þ y2 þ z2Þ
p
,
x2 þ y2 þ z2 @ a2 describes a function generated from the hypersphere.

NEIGHBORHOODS
The set of all points ðx; yÞ such that jx  x0j < , j y  y0j <  where  > 0, is called a rectangular 
neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ; the set 0 < jx  x0j < , 0 < j y  y0j <  which excludes ðx0; y0Þ is called a
rectangular deleted  neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ.
Similar remarks can be made for other neighborhoods,
e.g., ðx  x0Þ2 þ ð y  y0Þ2 < 2 is a circular  neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ.
The term ‘‘open ball’’ is used to
designate this circular neighborhood.
This terminology is appropriate for generalization to more
dimensions.
Whether neighborhoods are viewed as circular or square is immaterial, since the descrip-
tions are interchangeable.
Simply notice that given an open ball (circular neighborhood) of radius 
there is a centered square whose side is of length less than
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
 that is interior to the open ball, and
conversely for a square of side  there is an interior centered of radius of radius less than =2.
(See Fig.
6-1.)
A point ðx0; y0Þ is called a limit point, accumulation point, or cluster point of a point set S if every
deleted  neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ contains points of S.
As in the case of one-dimensional point sets,
every bounded inﬁnite set has at least one limit point (the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, see Pages 6 and
12).
A set containing all its limit points is called a closed set.
REGIONS
A point P belonging to a point set S is called an interior point of S if there exists a deleted 
neighborhood of P all of whose points belong to S.
A point P not belonging to S is called an exterior
point of S if there exists a deleted  neighborhood of P all of whose points do not belong to S. A point P
is called a boundary point of S if every deleted  neighborhood of P contains points belonging to S and
also points not belonging to S.
If any two points of a set S can be joined by a path consisting of a ﬁnite number of broken line
segments all of whose points belong to S, then S is called a connected set.
A region is a connected set
which consists of interior points or interior and boundary points. A closed region is a region containing
all its boundary points. An open region consists only of interior points. The complement of a set, S, in
the xy plane is the set of all points in the plane not belonging to S.
(See Fig. 6-2.)
Examples of some regions are shown graphically in Figs 6-3(a), (b), and (c) below. The rectangular
region of Fig. 6-1(a), including the boundary, represents the sets of points a @ x @ b, c @ y @ d which
is a natural extension of the closed interval a @ x @ b for one dimension. The set a < x < b, c < y < d
corresponds to the boundary being excluded.
In the regions of Figs 6-3(a) and 6-3(b), any simple closed curve (one which does not intersect itself
anywhere) lying inside the region can be shrunk to a point which also lies in the region. Such regions are
called simply-connected regions. In Fig. 6-3(c) however, a simple closed curve ABCD surrounding one of
the ‘‘holes’’ in the region cannot be shrunk to a point without leaving the region. Such regions are called
multiply-connected regions.

LIMITS
Let f ðx; yÞ be deﬁned in a deleted  neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ [i.e.; f ðx; yÞ may be undeﬁned at
ðx0; y0Þ].
We say that l is the limit of f ðx; yÞ as x approaches x0 and y approaches y0 [or ðx; yÞ
approaches ðx0; y0Þ] and write lim
x!x0
y!y0
f ðx; yÞ ¼ l [or
lim
ðx;yÞ!ðx0;y0Þ f ðx; yÞ ¼ l] if for any positive number  we
can ﬁnd some positive number  [depending on  and ðx0; y0Þ, in general] such that j f ðx; yÞ  lj < 
whenever 0 < jx  x0j <  and 0 < j y  y0j < .
If desired we can use the deleted circular neighborhood open ball 0 < ðx  x0Þ2 þ ð y  y0Þ2 < 2
instead of the deleted rectangular neighborhood.
EXAMPLE.
Let f ðx; yÞ ¼
3xy
if ðx; yÞ 6¼ ð1; 2Þ
0
if ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1; 2Þ

.
As x ! 1 and y ! 2 [or ðx; yÞ ! ð1; 2Þ], f ðx; yÞ gets closer to
3ð1Þð2Þ ¼ 6 and we suspect that lim
x!1
y!2
f ðx; yÞ ¼ 6.
To prove this we must show that the above deﬁnition of limit with
l ¼ 6 is satisﬁed.
Such a proof can be supplied by a method similar to that of Problem 6.4.
Note that lim
x!1
y!2
f ðx; yÞ 6¼ f ð1; 2Þ since f ð1; 2Þ ¼ 0.
The limit would in fact be 6 even if f ðx; yÞ were not deﬁned at
ð1; 2Þ. Thus the existence of the limit of f ðx; yÞ as ðx; yÞ ! ðx0; y0Þ is in no way dependent on the existence of a value
of f ðx; yÞ at ðx0; y0Þ.
Note that in order for
lim
ðx;yÞ!ðx0;y0Þ f ðx; yÞ to exist, it must have the same value regardless of the
approach of ðx; yÞ to ðx0; y0Þ.
It follows that if two diﬀerent approaches give diﬀerent values, the
limit cannot exist (see Problem 6.7).
This implies, as in the case of functions of one variable, that if a
limit exists it is unique.
The concept of one-sided limits for functions of one variable is easily extended to functions of more
than one variable.
EXAMPLE 1.

tan1ð y=xÞ ¼ =2.
EXAMPLE 2.
lim
x!0
y!1
tan1ð y=xÞ does not exist, as is clear from the fact that the two diﬀerent approaches of Example
1 give diﬀerent results.
In general the theorems on limits, concepts of inﬁnity, etc., for functions of one variable (see Page
21) apply as well, with appropriate modiﬁcations, to functions of two or more variables.

Although they must be equal if lim

CONTINUITY
Let f ðx; yÞ be deﬁned in a  neighborhood of ðx0; y0Þ [i.e.; f ðx; yÞ must be deﬁned at ðx0; y0Þ as well as
near it].
We say that f ðx; yÞ is continuous at ðx0; y0Þ if for any positive number  we can ﬁnd some
positive number  [depending on  and ðx0; y0Þ in general] such that j f ðx; yÞ  f ðx0; y0Þj <  whenever
jx  x0j <  and jy  y0j < , or alternatively ðx  x0Þ2 þ ð y  y0Þ2 < 2.
Note that three conditions must be satisﬁed in order that f ðx; yÞ be continuous at ðx0; y0Þ.
1.
lim
ðx;yÞ!ðx0;y0Þ f ðx; yÞ ¼ l, i.e., the limit exists as ðx; yÞ ! ðx0; y0Þ
2.
f ðx0; y0Þ must exist, i.e., f ðx; yÞ is deﬁned at ðx0; y0Þ
3.
l ¼ f ðx0; y0Þ
If desired we can write this in the suggestive form lim
x!x0
y!y0
f ðx; yÞ ¼ f ð lim
x!x0 x; lim
y!y0 yÞ.
EXAMPLE.
If f ðx; yÞ ¼
3xy
ðx; yÞ 6¼ ð1; 2Þ
0
ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1; 2Þ

, then
lim
ðx;yÞ!ð1;2Þ f ðx; yÞ ¼ 6 6¼ f ð1; 2Þ.
Hence, f ðx; yÞ is not contin-
uous at ð1; 2Þ. If we redeﬁne the function so that f ðx; yÞ ¼ 6 for ðx; yÞ ¼ ð1; 2Þ, then the function is continuous at
ð1; 2Þ.
If a function is not continuous at a point ðx0; y0Þ, it is said to be discontinuous at ðx0; y0Þ which is then
called a point of discontinuity.
If, as in the above example, it is possible to redeﬁne the value of a
function at a point of discontinuity so that the new function is continuous, we say that the point is a
removable discontinuity of the old function.
A function is said to be continuous in a region r of the xy
plane if it is continuous at every point of r.
Many of the theorems on continuity for functions of a single variable can, with suitable modiﬁca-
tion, be extended to functions of two more variables.
UNIFORM CONTINUITY
In the deﬁnition of continuity of f ðx; yÞ at ðx0; y0Þ,  depends on  and also ðx0; y0Þ in general. If in a
region r we can ﬁnd a  which depends only on  but not on any particular point ðx0; y0Þ in r [i.e., the
same  will work for all points in r], then f ðx; yÞ is said to be uniformly continuous in r.
As in the case
of functions of one variable, it can be proved that a function which is continuous in a closed and
bounded region is uniformly continuous in the region.
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
The ordinary derivative of a function of several variables with respect to one of the independent
variables, keeping all other independent variables constant, is called the partial derivative of the function
with respect to the variable.
Partial derivatives of f ðx; yÞ with respect to x and y are denoted by

EXAMPLE.
If f ðx; yÞ ¼ 2x3 þ 3xy2, then fx ¼ @f =@x ¼ 6x2 þ 3y2 and fy ¼ @f =@y ¼ 6xy.
Also, fxð1; 2Þ ¼
6ð1Þ2 þ 3ð2Þ2 ¼ 18, fyð1; 2Þ ¼ 6ð1Þð2Þ ¼ 12.
If a function f has continuous partial derivatives @f =@x, @f =@y in a region, then f must be continuous
in the region.
However, the existence of these partial derivatives alone is not enough to guarantee the
continuity of f (see Problem 6.9).
HIGHER ORDER PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
If f ðx; yÞ has partial derivatives at each point ðx; yÞ in a region, then @f =@x and @f =@y are themselves
functions of x and y, which may also have partial derivatives.
These second derivatives are denoted by

If fxy and fyx are continuous, then fxy ¼ fyx and the order of diﬀerentiation is immaterial; otherwise they
may not be equal (see Problems 6.13 and 6.41).
EXAMPLE.
If f ðx; yÞ ¼ 2x3 þ 3xy2 (see preceding example), then fxx ¼ 12x, fyy ¼ 6x, fxy ¼ 6y ¼ fyx. In such case
fxxð1; 2Þ ¼ 12, fyyð1; 2Þ ¼ 6, fxyð1; 2Þ ¼ fyxð1; 2Þ ¼ 12.
In a similar manner, higher order derivatives are deﬁned. For example @3f
@x2@y ¼ fyxx is the derivative
of f taken once with respect to y and twice with respect to x.
DIFFERENTIALS
(The section of diﬀerentials in Chapter 4 should be read before beginning this one.)
Let x ¼ dx and y ¼ dy be increments given to x and y, respectively.
Then
z ¼ f ðx þ x; y þ yÞ  f ðx; yÞ ¼ f
ð3Þ
is called the increment in z ¼ f ðx; yÞ.
If f ðx; yÞ has continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives in a region, then
z ¼ @f
@x x þ @f
@y y þ 1x þ 2y ¼ @z
@x dx þ @z
@y dy þ 1 dx þ 2 dy ¼ f
ð4Þ
where 1 and 2 approach zero as x and y approach zero (see Problem 6.14).
The expression
dz ¼ @z
@x dx þ @z
@y dy
or
df ¼ @f
@x dx þ @f
@y dy
ð5Þ
is called the total diﬀerential or simply diﬀerential of z or f , or the principal part of z or f . Note that
z 6¼ dz in general. However, if x ¼ dx and y ¼ dy are ‘‘small,’’ then dz is a close approximation of
z (see Problem 6.15). The quantities dx and dy, called diﬀerentials of x and y respectively, need not be
small.

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
[CHAP. 6

The form dz ¼ fxðx0; y0Þdx þ fyðx0; y0Þdy signiﬁes a linear function with the independent variables dx
and dy and the dependent range variable dz. In the one variable case, the corresponding linear function
represents the tangent line to the underlying curve.
In this case, the underlying entity is a surface and
the linear function generates the tangent plane at P0.
In a small enough neighborhood, this tangent
plane is an approximation of the surface (i.e., the linear representation of the surface at P0). If y is held
constant, then one obtains the curve of intersection of the surface and the coordinate plane y ¼ y0. The
diﬀerential form reduces to dz ¼ fxðx0; y0Þdx (i.e., the one variable case). A similar statement follows
when x is held constant.
See Fig. 6-4.
If f is such that f (or zÞ can be expressed in the form (4) where 1 and 2 approach zero as x and
y approach zero, we call f diﬀerentiable at ðx; yÞ.
The mere existence of fx and fy does not in itself
guarantee diﬀerentiability; however, continuity of fx and fy does (although this condition happens to be
slightly stronger than necessary). In case fx and fy are continuous in a region r, we shall say that f is
continuously diﬀerentiable in r.
THEOREMS ON DIFFERENTIALS
In the following we shall assume that all functions have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives in a

IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS
In general, an equation such as Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 deﬁnes one variable, say z, as a function of the other
two variables x and y. Then z is sometimes called an implicit function of x and y, as distinguished from a
so-called explicit function f, where z ¼ f ðx; yÞ, which is such that F½x; y; f ðx; yÞ  0.
Diﬀerentiation of implicit functions requires considerable discipline in interpreting the independent
and dependent character of the variables and in distinguishing the intent of one’s notation.
For
example, suppose that in the implicit equation F½x; y; f ðx; zÞ ¼ 0, the independent variables are x and
y and that z ¼ f ðx; yÞ. In order to ﬁnd @f
@x and @f
@y, we initially write (observe that Fðx; t; zÞ is zero for all
domain pairs ðx; yÞ, in other words it is a constant):
0 ¼ dF ¼ Fx dx þ Fy dy þ Fz dz
and then compute the partial derivatives Fx; Fy; Fz as though y; y; z constituted an independent set of
variables.
At this stage we invoke the dependence of z on x and y to obtain the diﬀerential form
dz ¼ @f
@x dx þ @f
@y dy.
Upon substitution and some algebra (see Problem 6.30) the following results are
obtained:
@f
@x ¼  Fx
Fz
;
@f
@y ¼  Fy
Fz
EXAMPLE.
If
0 ¼ Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ x2z þ yz2 þ 2xy2  z3
and
z ¼ f ðx; yÞ
then
Fx ¼ 2xz þ 2y2,
Fy ¼ z2 þ 4xy.
Fz ¼ x2 þ 2yz  3z2.
Then
@f
@x ¼ 
ð2xz þ 2y2Þ
x2 þ 2yz  3z2 ;
@f
@y ¼ 
ðz2 þ 4xyÞ
x2 þ 2yz  3x2
Observe that f need not be known to obtain these results.
If that information is available then (at
least theoretically) the partial derivatives may be expressed through the independent variables x and y.
JACOBIANS
If Fðu; vÞ and Gðu; vÞ are diﬀerentiable in a region, the Jacobian determinant, or brieﬂy the Jacobian,
of F and G with respect to u and v is the second order functional determinant deﬁned by
@ðF; GÞ
@ðu; vÞ ¼

is called the Jacobian of F, G, and H with respect to u, v, and w.
Extensions are easily made.
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES USING JACOBIANS
Jacobians often prove useful in obtaining partial derivatives of implicit functions.
Thus, for
example, given the simultaneous equations
Fðx; y; u; vÞ ¼ 0;
Gðx; y; u; vÞ ¼ 0
CHAP. 6]
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
123

we may, in general, consider u and v as functions of x and y.
In this case, we have (see Problem 6.31)
@u
@x ¼ 
@ðF; GÞ
@ðx; vÞ
@ðF; GÞ
@ðu; vÞ
;
@u
@y ¼ 
@ðF; GÞ

@ðF; GÞ
@ðu; vÞ
;
@v
@y ¼ 
@ðF; GÞ
@ðu; yÞ
@ðF; GÞ
@ðu; vÞ
The ideas are easily extended.
Thus if we consider the simultaneous equations
Fðu; v; w; x; yÞ ¼ 0;
Gðu; v; w; x; yÞ ¼ 0;
Hðu; v; w; x; yÞ ¼ 0
we may, for example, consider u, v, and w as functions of x and y.
In this case,
@u
@x ¼ 
@ðF; G; HÞ
@ðx; v; wÞ
@ðF; G; HÞ
@ðu; v; wÞ
;
@w
@y ¼ 
@ðF; G; HÞ
@ðu; v; yÞ
@ðF; G; HÞ
@ðu; v; wÞ
with similar results for the remaining partial derivatives (see Problem 6.33).
THEOREMS ON JACOBIANS
In the following we assume that all functions are continuously diﬀerentiable.
1.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition that the equations Fðu; v; x; y; zÞ ¼ 0, Gðu; v; x; y; zÞ ¼ 0
can be solved for u and v (for example) is that @ðF; GÞ
@ðu; vÞ is not identically zero in a region r.
Similar results are valid for m equations in n variables, where m < n.
2.
If x and y are functions of u and v while u and v are functions of r and s, then (see Problem 6.43)
@ðx; yÞ
@ðr; sÞ ¼ @ðx; yÞ
@ðu; vÞ
@ðu; vÞ
@ðr; sÞ
ð9Þ
This is an example of a chain rule for Jacobians.
These ideas are capable of generalization (see
Problems 6.107 and 6.109, for example).
3.
If u ¼ f ðx; yÞ and v ¼ gðx; yÞ, then a necessary and suﬃcient condition that a functional relation
of the form ðu; vÞ ¼ 0 exists between u and v is that @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ be identically zero.
Similar results
hold for n functions of n variables.
Further discussion of Jacobians appears in Chapter 7 where vector interpretations are employed.
TRANSFORMATIONS
The set of equations
x ¼ Fðu; vÞ
y ¼ Gðu; vÞ

ð10Þ
deﬁnes, in general, a transformation or mapping which establishes a correspondence between points in the
uv and xy planes.
If to each point in the uv plane there corresponds one and only one point in the xy
plane, and conversely, we speak of a one-to-one transformation or mapping.
This will be so if F and G
are continuously diﬀerentiable with Jacobian not identically zero in a region.
In such case (which we
shall assume unless otherwise stated) equations (10) are said to deﬁne a continuously diﬀerentiable
transformation or mapping.
124
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
[CHAP. 6

Under the transformation (10) a closed region r of the xy plane is, in general, mapped into a closed
region r 0 of the uv plane. Then if Axy and Auv denote respectively the areas of these regions, we can
show that
lim Axy
Auv
¼ @ðx; yÞ
@ðu; vÞ








ð11Þ
where lim denotes the limit as Axy (or Auv) approaches zero.
The Jacobian on the right of (11) is
often called the Jacobian of the transformation (10).
If we solve (10) for u and v in terms of x and y, we obtain the transformation u ¼ f ðx; yÞ, v ¼ gðx; yÞ
often called the inverse transformation corresponding to (10).
The Jacobians @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ and @ðx; yÞ
@ðu; vÞ of these
transformations are reciprocals of each other (see Problem 6.43).
Hence, if one Jacobian is diﬀerent
from zero in a region, so also is the other.
The above ideas can be extended to transformations in three or higher dimensions.
We shall deal
further with these topics in Chapter 7, where use is made of the simplicity of vector notation and
interpretation.
CURVILINEAR COORDINATES
If ðx; yÞ are the rectangular coordinates of a point in the xy plane, we can think of ðu; vÞ as also
specifying coordinates of the same point, since by knowing ðu; vÞ we can determine ðx; yÞ from (10). The
coordinates ðu; vÞ are called curvilinear coordinates of the point.
EXAMPLE.
The polar coordinates ð; Þ of a point correspond to the case u ¼ , v ¼ .
In this case the
transformation equations (10) are x ¼  cos , y ¼  sin .
For curvilinear coordinates in higher dimensional spaces, see Chapter 7.
MEAN VALUE THEOREM

(i.e., excluding boundary points), then

LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

Prove that lim
x!1
y!2
ðx2 þ 2yÞ ¼ 5.
Method 1, using deﬁnition of limit.
We must show that given any  > 0, we can ﬁnd  > 0 such that jx2 þ 2y  5j <  when 0 < jx  1j < ,
0 < j y  2j < .
If 0 < jx  1j <  and 0 < j y  2j < , then 1   < x < 1 þ  and 2   < y < 2 þ , excluding
x ¼ 1; y ¼ 2.
Thus, 1  2 þ 2 < x2 < 1 þ 2 þ 2 and 4  2 < 2y < 4 þ 2.
Adding,
5  4 þ 2 < x2 þ 2y < 5 þ 4 þ 2
or
 4 þ 2 < x2 þ 2y  5 < 4 þ 2
Now if  @ 1, it certainly follows that 5 < x2 þ 2y  5 < 5, i.e., jx2 þ 2y  5j < 5 whenever
0 < jx  1j < , 0 < j y  2j < .
Then choosing 5 ¼ , i.e.,  ¼ =5 (or  ¼ 1, whichever is smaller), it
follows that jx2 þ 2y  5j <  when 0 < jx  1j < , 0 < j y  2j < , i.e., lim

Then lim

Alternatively, we can show, in much the same manner as in the ﬁrst method of Problem 6.4, that given

Since the limits exist for all points ðx0; y0Þ, we can write fxðx; yÞ ¼ fx ¼ 4x  y, fyðx; yÞ ¼ fy ¼
x þ 2y which are themselves functions of x and y.
Note that formally fxðx0; y0Þ is obtained from f ðx; yÞ by diﬀerentiating with respect to x, keeping y
constant and then putting x ¼ x0; y ¼ y0.
Similarly, fyðx0; y0Þ is obtained by diﬀerentiating f with
respect to y, keeping x constant.
This procedure, while often lucrative in practice, need not always
yield correct results (see Problem 6.9). It will work if the partial derivatives are continuous.

If f ðx; yÞ is deﬁned in a region r and if fxy and fyx exist and are continuous at a point of r, prove
that fxy ¼ fyx at this point.
Let ðx0; y0Þ be the point of r.
Consider
G ¼ f ðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ  f ðx0; y0 þ kÞ  f ðx0 þ h; y0Þ þ f ðx0; y0Þ
Deﬁne
(1)
ðx; yÞ ¼ f ðx þ h; yÞ  f ðx; yÞ

Then
(3)
G ¼ ðx0; y0 þ kÞ  ðx0; y0Þ
(4)
G ¼  ðx0 þ h; y0Þ   ðx0; y0Þ
Applying the mean value theorem for functions of one variable (see Page 72) to (3) and (4), we have

(8)
G ¼ hk fxyðx0 þ 2h; y0 þ 4kÞ

From (7) and (8) we have
ð9Þ
fyxðx0 þ 3h; y0 þ 1kÞ ¼ fxyðx0 þ 2h; y0 þ 4kÞ
Letting h ! 0 and k ! 0 in (9) we have, since fxy and fyx are assumed continuous at ðx0; y0Þ,
fyxðx0; y0Þ ¼ fxyðx0; y0Þ
as required.
For example where this fails to hold, see Problem 6.41.

Let f ðx; yÞ have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives in a region r of the xy plane.
Prove that
f ¼ f ðx þ x; y þ yÞ  f ðx; yÞ ¼ fxx þ fyy þ 1x þ 2y
where 1 and 2 approach zero as x and y approach zero.
Applying the mean value theorem for functions of one variable (see Page 72), we have
ð1Þ
f ¼ f f ðx þ x; y þ yÞ  f ðx; y þ yÞg þ f f ðx; y þ yÞ  f ðx; yÞg
¼ x fxðx þ 1x; y þ yÞ þ y fyðx; y þ 2yÞ
0 < 1 < 1; 0 < 2 < 1
Since, by hypothesis, fx and fy are continuous, it follows that
fxðx þ 1x; y þ yÞ ¼ fxðx; yÞ þ 1;
fyðx; y þ 2yÞ ¼ fyðx; yÞ þ 2
where 1 ! 0, 2 ! 0 as x ! 0 and y ! 0.
Thus,
f ¼ fxx þ fyy þ 1x þ 2y
as required.
Deﬁning
x ¼ dx; y ¼ dy, we have f ¼ fx dx þ fy dy þ 1 dx þ 2 dy:
We call
df ¼ fx dx þ fy dy the diﬀerential of f (or z) or the principal part of f (or z).

Thus,
ðbÞ
dz ¼ 2xy x þ ðx2  3Þy ¼ 2xy dx þ ðx2  3Þ dy

dz ¼ 2xy dx þ ðx2  3Þ dy ¼ 2ð4Þð3Þð0:01Þ þ ð43  3Þð0:02Þ ¼ 0:02
Note that in this case z and dz are approximately equal, because x ¼ dx and y ¼ dy are
suﬃciently small.
(d)
We must ﬁnd f ðx þ x; y þ yÞ when x þ x ¼ 5:12 and y ¼ y ¼ 6:85.
We can accomplish this by
choosing x ¼ 5, x ¼ 0:12, y ¼ 7, y ¼ 0:15.
Since x and y are small, we use the fact that
f ðx þ x; y þ yÞ ¼ f ðx; yÞ þ z is approximately equal to f ðx; yÞ þ dz, i.e., z þ dz.
Now
z ¼ f ðx; yÞ ¼ f ð5; 7Þ ¼ ð5Þ2ð7Þ  3ð7Þ ¼ 154
dz ¼ 2xy dx þ ðx2  3Þ dy ¼ 2ð5Þð7Þð0:12Þ þ ð52  3Þð0:15Þ ¼ 5:1:
Then the required value is 154 þ 5:1 ¼ 159:1 approximately.
The value obtained by direct com-
putation is 159.01864.

where FðyÞ is the ‘‘constant’’ of integration.
Substituting this into (2) yields
x3  4xy þ F 0ð yÞ ¼ x3  4xy þ 6y2 from which F 0ð yÞ ¼ 6y2;
i.e., Fð yÞ ¼ 2y3 þ c
Hence, the required function is  ¼ x3y  2xy2 þ 2y3 þ c, where c is an arbitrary constant.
Note that by Theorem 3, Page 122, the existence of such a function is guaranteed, since if
P ¼ 3x2y  2y2 and Q ¼ x3  4xy þ 6y2, then @P=@y ¼ 3x2  4y ¼ @Q=@x identically.
If @P=@y 6¼
@Q=@x this function would not exist and the given expression would not be an exact diﬀerential.
Method 2:
ð3x2y  2y2Þ dx þ ðx3  4xy þ 6y2Þ dy ¼ ð3x2y dx þ x3 dyÞ  ð2y2 dx þ 4xy dyÞ þ 6y2 dy
¼ dðx3yÞ  dð2xy2Þ þ dð2y3Þ ¼ dðx3y  2xy2 þ 2y3Þ
¼ dðx3y  2xy2 þ 2y3 þ cÞ
Then the required function is x3y  2xy2 þ 2y3 þ c.
This method, called the grouping method, is based on one’s ability to recognize exact diﬀerential
combinations and is less than Method 1. Naturally, before attempting to apply any method, one should
determine whether the given expression is an exact diﬀerential by using Theorem 3, Page 122. See
Theorem 4, Page 122.

From 3 equations in 5 variables, we can (theoretically at least) determine 3 variables in terms of the

Thus, 3 variables are dependent and 2 are independent. If we were asked to determine @v=@y,
we would know that v is a dependent variable and y is an independent variable, but would not know the
remaining independent variable.
However, the particular notation @v

Let u ¼ f ðx; yÞ and v ¼ gðx; yÞ, where f and g are continuously diﬀerentiable in some region r.
Prove that a necessary and suﬃcient condition that there exists a functional relation between u
and v of the form ðu; vÞ ¼ 0 is the vanishing of the Jacobian, i.e., @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ ¼ 0 identically.
Necessity.
We have to prove that if the functional relation ðu; vÞ ¼ 0 exists, then the Jacobian @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ ¼ 0
identically.
To do this, we note that
d ¼ u du þ v dv ¼ uðux dx þ uy dyÞ þ vðvx dx þ vy dyÞ
¼ ðu ux þ v vxÞ dx þ ðu uy þ v vyÞ dy ¼ 0
ð1Þ
u ux þ v vx ¼ 0
ð2Þ
u uy þ v vy ¼ 0
Then
Now u and v cannot be identically zero since if they were, there would be no functional relation,
contrary to hypothesis.
Hence it follows from (1) and (2) that
ux

uy
vy








 ¼ @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ ¼ 0 identically.
Suﬃciency.
We have to prove that if the Jacobian @ðu; vÞ
@ðx; yÞ ¼ 0 identically, then there exists a functional
relation between u and v, i.e., ðu; vÞ ¼ 0.
Let us ﬁrst suppose that both ux ¼ 0 and uy ¼ 0. In this case the Jacobian is identically zero and u is a
constant c1, so that the trival functional relation u ¼ c1 is obtained.
Let us now assume that we do not have both ux ¼ 0 and uy ¼ 0; for deﬁniteness, assume ux 6¼ 0.
We
may then, according to Theorem 1, Page 124, solve for x in the equation u ¼ f ðx; yÞ to obtain x ¼ Fðu; yÞ,
from which it follows that
ð1Þ
u ¼ f fFðu; yÞ; yg
ð2Þ
v ¼ gfFðu; yÞ; yg
From these we have respectively,
ð3Þ
du ¼ ux dx þ uy dy ¼ uxðFu du þ Fy dyÞ þ uy dy ¼ uxFu du þ ðuxFy þ uyÞ dy
ð4Þ
dv ¼ vx dx þ vy dy ¼ vxðFu du þ Fy dyÞ þ vy dy ¼ vxFu du þ ðvxFy þ vyÞ dy
From (3), uxFu ¼ 1 and uxFy þ uy ¼ 0 or (5) Fy ¼ uy=ux.
Using this, (4) becomes
dv ¼ vxFu du þ fvxðuy=uxÞ þ vyg dy ¼ vxFu du þ

But by hypothesis @ðu; vÞ

 ¼ uxvy  uyvx ¼ 0 identically, so that (6) becomes dv ¼ vxFu du.
This means essentially that referring to (2), @v=@y ¼ 0 which means that v is not dependent on y but depends
only on u, i.e., v is a function of u, which is the same as saying that the functional relation ðu; vÞ ¼ 0 exists.

By Problem 6.35, since the Jacobian is identically zero in a region, there must be a functional relation-
ship between u and v.
This is seen to be tan v ¼ u, i.e., ðu; vÞ ¼ u  tan v ¼ 0.
We can show this
directly by solving for x (say) in one of the equations and then substituting in the other.
Thus, for
example, from v ¼ tan1 x þ tan1 y we ﬁnd tan1 x ¼ v  tan1 y and so
x ¼ tanðv  tan1 yÞ ¼ tan v  tanðtan1 yÞ
1 þ tan v tanðtan1 yÞ ¼ tan v  y

Then substituting this in u ¼ ðx þ yÞ=ð1  xyÞ and simplifying, we ﬁnd u ¼ tan v.

TRANSFORMATIONS, CURVILINEAR COORDINATES

A region r in the xy plane is bounded by x þ y ¼ 6, x  y ¼ 2; and y ¼ 0.
(a) Determine the

(b) Compute @ðx; yÞ

(c) Compare the result of (b) with the ratio of the areas of r and r 0.

The region r shown shaded in Fig. 6-9(a) below is a triangle bounded by the lines x þ y ¼ 6, x  y ¼ 2,
and y ¼ 0 which for distinguishing purposes are shown dotted, dashed, and heavy respectively.
Under the given transformation the line x þ y ¼ 6 is transformed into ðu þ vÞ þ ðu  vÞ ¼ 6, i.e.,
2u ¼ 6 or u ¼ 3, which is a line (shown dotted) in the uv plane of Fig. 6-9(b) above.

Similarly, x  y ¼ 2 becomes ðu þ vÞ  ðu  vÞ ¼ 2 or v ¼ 1, which is a line (shown dashed) in the
uv plane.
In like manner, y ¼ 0 becomes u  v ¼ 0 or u ¼ v, which is a line shown heavy in the uv
plane.
Then the required region is bounded by u ¼ 3, v ¼ 1 and u ¼ v, and is shown shaded in Fig. 6-

The area of triangular region r is 4, whereas the area of triangular region r 0 is 2.
Hence, the ratio is
4=2 ¼ 2, agreeing with the value of the Jacobian in (b).
Since the Jacobian is constant in this case, the
areas of any regions r in the xy plane are twice the areas of corresponding mapped regions r 0 in the uv
plane.
6.39.
A region r in the xy plane is bounded by x2 þ y2 ¼ a2, x2 þ y2 ¼ b2, x ¼ 0 and y ¼ 0, where
0 < a < b.
(a) Determine the region r 0 into which r is mapped under the transformation
x ¼  cos , y ¼  sin , where  > 0, 0 @  < 2.
(b) Discuss what happens when a ¼ 0.
(c) Compute @ðx; yÞ
@ð; Þ.
(d) Compute @ð; Þ
@ðx; yÞ.
(a)
The region r [shaded in Fig. 6-10(a) above] is bounded by x ¼ 0 (dotted), y ¼ 0 (dotted and dashed),
x2 þ y2 ¼ a2 (dashed), x2 þ y2 ¼ b2 (heavy).
Under the given transformation, x2 þ y2 ¼ a2 and x2 þ y2 ¼ b2 become 2 ¼ a2 and 2 ¼ b2 or
 ¼ a and  ¼ b respectively. Also, x ¼ 0, a @ y @ b becomes  ¼ =2, a @  @ b; y ¼ 0, a @ x @ b
becomes  ¼ 0, a @  @ b.
The required region r 0 is shown shaded in Fig. 6-10(b) above.
Another method:
Using the fact that  is the distance from the origin O of the xy plane and  is the
angle measured from the positive x-axis, it is clear that the required region is given by a @  @ b,
0 @  @ =2 as indicated in Fig. 6-10(b).
(b)
If a ¼ 0, the region r becomes one-fourth of a circular region of radius b (bounded by 3 sides) while r 0
remains a rectangle.
The reason for this is that the point x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0 is mapped into  ¼ 0,  ¼ an
indeterminate and the transformation is not one to one at this point which is sometimes called a singular
point.

MEAN VALUE THEOREMS
6.40.
Prove the mean value theorem for functions of two variables.
Let f ðtÞ ¼ f ðx0 þ ht; y0 þ ktÞ.
By the mean value theorem for functions of one variable,
Fð1Þ ¼ Fð0Þ ¼ F 0ðÞ
0 <  < 1
ð1Þ
If x ¼ x0 þ ht, y ¼ y0 þ kt, then FðtÞ ¼ f ðx; yÞ, so that by Problem 6.17,
F 0ðtÞ ¼ fxðdx=dtÞ þ fyðdy=dtÞ ¼ hfx þ kfy
and
F 0ðÞ ¼ h fxðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ þ k fyðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ
where 0 <  < 1.
Thus, (1) becomes
f ðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ  f ðx0; y0Þ ¼ h fxðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ þ k fyðx0 þ h; y0 þ kÞ
ð2Þ
where 0 <  < 1 as required.
Note that (2), which is analogous to (1) of Problem 6.14 where h ¼ x, has the advantage of being
more symmetric (and also more useful), since only a single number  is involved.

The equations x ¼ f ðu; vÞ, y ¼ gðu; vÞ deﬁnes a transformation between points ðx; yÞ in the xy plane
and points ðu; vÞ in the uv plane.
The inverse transformation is given by u ¼ ðx; yÞ, v ¼  ðx; yÞ.
The
result obtained states that the Jacobians of these transformations are reciprocals of each other.

Show
that

satisﬁes
under
suitable
conditions
the
equation
xð@z=@xÞ  yð@z=@yÞ ¼ 2x.
What are these conditions?
Let u ¼ xy, v ¼ z  2x.
Then Fðu; vÞ ¼ 0 and
dF ¼ Fu du þ Fv dv ¼ Fuðx dy þ y dxÞ þ Fvðdz  2 dxÞ ¼ 0
ð1Þ
Taking z as dependent variable and x and y as independent variables, we have dz ¼ zx dx þ zy dy. Then
substituting in (1), we ﬁnd
ð yFu þ Fvzx  2Þ dx þ ðxFu þ FvzyÞ dy ¼ 0
Hence, we have, since x and y are independent,
ð2Þ
yFu þ Fvzx  2 ¼ 0
ð3Þ
xFu þ Fvzy ¼ 0
Solve for Fu in (3) and substitute in (2). Then we obtain the required result xzx  yzy ¼ 2x upon dividing by
Fv (supposed not equal to zero).
The result will certainly be valid if we assume that Fðu; vÞ is continuously diﬀerentiable and that Fv 6¼ 0.

Vectors
VECTORS
The foundational ideas for vector analysis were formed indepen-
dently in the nineteenth century by William Rowen Hamilton and
Herman Grassmann.
We are indebted to the physicist John Willard
Gibbs, who formulated the classical presentation of the Hamilton
viewpoint in his Yale lectures, and his student E. B. Wilson, who
considered the mathematical material presented in class worthy of
organizing as a book (published in 1901). Hamilton was searching for
a mathematical language appropriate to a comprehensive exposition
of the physical knowledge of the day.
His geometric presentation
emphasizing magnitude and direction, and compact notation for the
entities of the calculus, was reﬁned in the following years to the beneﬁt of expressing Newtonian
mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and so on.
Grassmann developed an algebraic and more philo-
sophic mathematical structure which was not appreciated until it was needed for Riemanian (non-
Euclidean) geometry and the special and general theories of relativity.
Our introduction to vectors is geometric.
We conceive of a vector as a directed line segment PQ
!
from one point P called the initial point to another point Q called the terminal point. We denote vectors
by boldfaced letters or letters with an arrow over them.
Thus PQ
! is denoted by A or ~A as in Fig. 7-1.
The magnitude or length of the vector is then denoted by jPQ
!j, PQ, jAj or j ~Aj.
Vectors are deﬁned to satisfy the following geometric properties.
GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES
1.
Two vectors A and B are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of their
initial points.
Thus A ¼ B in Fig. 7-1 above.
In other words, a vector is geometrically represented by any one of a class of commonly
directed line segments of equal magnitude.
Since any one of the class of line segments may be
chosen to represent it, the vector is said to be free.
In certain circumstances (tangent vectors,
forces bound to a point), the initial point is ﬁxed, then the vector is bound.
Unless speciﬁcally
stated, the vectors in this discussion are free vectors.
2.
A vector having direction opposite to that of vector A but with the same magnitude is denoted
by A [see Fig. 7-2].
Q
P
A or A
B
Fig. 7-1

3.
The sum or resultant of vectors A and B of Fig. 7-3(a) below is
a vector C formed by placing the initial point of B on the
terminal point of A and joining the initial point of A to the
terminal point of B [see Fig. 7-3(b) below].
The sum C is
written C ¼ A þ B.
The deﬁnition here is equivalent to the
parallelogram law for vector addition as indicated in Fig.7-3(c)
below.
Extensions to sums of more than two vectors are
immediate. For example, Fig. 7-4 below shows how to obtain
the sum or resultant E of the vectors A, B, C, and D.
4.
The diﬀerence of vectors A and B, represented by A  B, is that vector C which added to B gives
A. Equivalently, A  B may be deﬁned as A þ ðBÞ. If A ¼ B, then A  B is deﬁned as the null
or zero vector and is represented by the symbol 0. This has a magnitude of zero but its direction
is not deﬁned.
The expression of vector equations and related concepts is facilitated by the use of real
numbers and functions. In this context, these are called scalars. This special designation arises
from application where the scalars represent object that do not have direction, such as mass,
length, and temperature.
5.
Multiplication of a vector A by a scalar m produces a vector mA with magnitude jmj times the
magnitude of A and direction the same as or opposite to that of A according as m is positive or
negative.
If m ¼ 0, mA ¼ 0, the null vector.
ALGEBRAIC PROPERTIES OF VECTORS
The following algebraic properties are consequences of the geometric deﬁnition of a vector.

LINEAR INDEPENDENCE AND LINEAR DEPENDENCE OF A SET OF VECTORS
A set of vectors, A1; A2; . . . ; Ap, is linearly independent means that a1A1 þ a2A2 þ    þ apAp þ    þ
apAp ¼ 0 if and only if a1 ¼ a2 ¼    ¼ ap ¼ 0 (i.e., the algebraic sum is zero if and only if all the
coeﬃcients are zero).
The set of vectors is linearly dependent when it is not linearly independent.
UNIT VECTORS
Unit vectors are vectors having unit length. If A is any vector with length A > 0, then A=A is a unit
vector, denoted by a, having the same direction as A.
Then A ¼ Aa.
RECTANGULAR (ORTHOGONAL) UNIT VECTORS
The rectangular unit vectors i, j, and k are unit vectors having the direction of the positive x, y, and z
axes of a rectangular coordinate system [see Fig. 7-5]. We use right-handed rectangular coordinate
systems unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Such systems derive their name from the fact that a right-threaded
screw rotated through 908 from Ox to Oy will advance in the positive z direction.
In general, three
vectors A, B, and C which have coincident initial points and are not coplanar are said to form a right-
handed system or dextral system if a right-threaded screw rotated through an angle less than 1808 from A
to B will advance in the direction C [see Fig. 7-6 below].

COMPONENTS OF A VECTOR
Any vector A in 3 dimensions can be represented with
initial point at the origin O of a rectangular coordinate
system [see Fig. 7-7]. Let ðA1; A2; A3Þ be the rectangular
coordinates of the terminal point of vector A with initial
point at O.
The vectors A1i; A2j; and A3k are called the
rectangular component vectors, or simply component vec-
tors, of A in the x, y; and z directions respectively. A1; A2;
and A3 are called the rectangular components, or simply
components, of A in the x, y; and z directions respectively.
The vectors of the set fi; j; kg are perpendicular to one
another, and they are unit vectors.
The words orthogonal
and normal, respectively, are used to describe these charac-
teristics; hence, the set is what is called an orthonormal basis.
It is easily shown to be linearly independent.
In an n-dimensional space, any set of n linearly indepen-
dent vectors is a basis.
The further characteristic of a basis is that any vector of the space can be
expressed through it.
It is the basis representation that provides the link between the geometric and
algebraic expressions of vectors and vector concepts.
The sum or resultant of A1i; A2j; and A3k is the vector A, so that we can write
A ¼ A1i þ A2j þ A3k

DOT OR SCALAR PRODUCT
The dot or scalar product of two vectors A and B, denoted by A  B (read A dot B) is deﬁned as the
product of the magnitudes of A and B and the cosine of the angle between them.
In symbols,
A  B ¼ AB cos ;
0 @  @ 
ð4Þ
Assuming that neither A nor B is the zero vector, an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition is that
A  B ¼ 0 if and only if A and B are perpendicular.
Note that A  B is a scalar and not a vector.
The following laws are valid:
1.
A  B ¼ B  A

from the law of cosines.

CROSS OR VECTOR PRODUCT
The cross or vector product of A and B is a vector C ¼ A  B (read A cross B).
The magnitude of
A  B is deﬁned as the product of the magnitudes of A and B and the sine of the angle between them.
The direction of the vector C ¼ A  B is perpendicular to the plane of A and B and such that A, B, and C
form a right-handed system.
In symbols,
A  B ¼ AB sin u;

where u is a unit vector indicating the direction of A  B. If A ¼ B or if A is parallel to B, then sin  ¼ 0
and A  B ¼ 0.

½ABC.
The product A  ðB  CÞ is called the vector triple product.
In A  ðB  CÞ parentheses are sometimes omitted and we write A  B  C.
However, parentheses
must be used in A  ðB  CÞ (see Problem 7.29). Note that A  ðB  CÞ ¼ ðA  BÞ  C.
This is often
expressed by stating that in a scalar triple product the dot and the cross can be interchanged without
aﬀecting the result (see Problem 7.26).
AXIOMATIC APPROACH TO VECTOR ANALYSIS
From the above remarks it is seen that a vector r ¼ xi þ yj þ zk is determined when its 3 components
ðx; y; zÞ relative to some coordinate system are known.
In adopting an axiomatic approach, it is thus
quite natural for us to make the following
Deﬁnition.
A three-dimensional vector is an ordered triplet of real numbers with the following
properties.
If A ¼ ðA1; A2; A3Þ and B ¼ ðB1; B2; B3Þ then
1.
A ¼ B if and only if A1 ¼ B1; A2 ¼ B2; A3 ¼ B3

Unit vectors are deﬁned to be ð1; 0; 0Þ; ð0; 1; 0Þ; ð0; 0; 1Þ and then designated by i; j; k, respectively,
thereby identifying the components axiomatically introduced with the geometric orthonormal basis
elements.
If one wishes, this axiomatic formulation (which provides a component representation for vectors)
can be used to reestablish the fundamental laws previously introduced geometrically; however, the
CHAP. 7]
VECTORS
155

primary reason for introducing this approach was to formalize a component representation of the
vectors.
It is that concept that will be used in the remainder of this chapter.
Note 1: One of the advantages of component representation of vectors is the easy extension of the
ideas to all dimensions.
In an n-dimensional space, the component representation is
AðA1; A2; . . . ; AnÞ
An exception is the cross-product which is speciﬁ-
cally restricted to three-dimensional space.
There are
generalizations of the cross-product to higher dimen-
sional spaces, but there is no direct extension.)
Note 2: The geometric interpretation of a vector
endows it with an absolute meaning at any point of
space.
The component representation (as an ordered
triple of numbers) in Euclidean three space is not unique,
rather, it is attached to the coordinate system employed.
This follows because the components are geometrically
interpreted as the projections of the arrow representation
on the coordinate directions.
Therefore, the projections
on the axes of a second coordinate system rotated (for
example) from the ﬁrst one will be diﬀerent.
(See Fig.
7-10.) Therefore, for theories where groups of coordinate
systems play a role, a more adequate component deﬁni-
tion of a vector is as a collection of ordered triples of
numbers, each one identiﬁed with a coordinate system
of the group, and any two related by a coordinate
transformation.
This viewpoint is indispensable in New-
tonian mechanics, electromagnetic theory, special relativ-
ity, and so on.
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
If corresponding to each value of a scalar u we associate a vector A, then A is called a function of u
denoted by AðuÞ.
In three dimensions we can write AðuÞ ¼ A1ðuÞi þ A2ðuÞj þ A3ðuÞk.
The function concept is easily extended.
Thus, if to each point ðx; y; zÞ there corresponds a vector
A, then A is a function of ðx; y; zÞ, indicated by Aðx; y; zÞ ¼ A1ðx; y; zÞi þ A2ðx; y; zÞj þ A3ðx; y; zÞk.
We sometimes say that a vector function A deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld since it associates a vector with each
point of a region. Similarly, ðx; y; zÞ deﬁnes a scalar ﬁeld since it associates a scalar with each point of a
region.
LIMITS, CONTINUITY, AND DERIVATIVES OF VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Limits, continuity, and derivatives of vector functions follow rules similar to those for scalar func-
tions already considered.
The following statements show the analogy which exists.
1.
The vector function represented by AðuÞ is said to be continuous at u0 if given any positive
number , we can ﬁnd some positive number  such that jAðuÞ  Aðu0Þj <  whenever
ju  u0j < .
This is equivalent to the statement lim
u!u0 AðuÞ ¼ Aðu0Þ.
2.
The derivative of AðuÞ is deﬁned as
dA
du ¼ lim
u!0
Aðu þ uÞ  AðuÞ
u
provided this limit exists.
In case AðuÞ ¼ A1ðuÞi þ A2ðuÞj þ A3ðuÞk; then

dA
du ¼ dA1
du i þ dA2

Higher derivatives such as d2A=du2, etc., can be similarly deﬁned.
3.
If Aðx; y; zÞ ¼ A1ðx; y; zÞi þ A2ðx; y; zÞj þ A3ðx; y; zÞk, then
dA ¼ @A
@x dx þ @A
@y dy þ @A

products are involved the order may be important.

of the vector function rðuÞ deﬁnes x, y; and z as functions of u (r is called a position vector). As u changes,
the terminal point of r describes a space curve (see Fig. 7-11) having parametric equations
x ¼ xðuÞ; y ¼ yðuÞ; z ¼ zðuÞ.
If the parameter u is the arc length s measured from some ﬁxed point
on the curve, then recall from the discussion of arc length that ds2 ¼ dr  dr.
Thus
dr
ds ¼ T
ð7Þ
is a unit vector in the direction of the tangent to the curve and is called the unit tangent vector. If u is the
time t, then
dr
dt ¼ v
ð8Þ
is the velocity with which the terminal point of r describes the curve.
We have
v ¼ dr
dt ¼ dr
ds

dt ¼ ds
dt T ¼ vT

from which we see that the magnitude of v is v ¼ ds=dt.
Similarly,
d2r
dt2 ¼ a
ð10Þ
is the acceleration with which the terminal point of r describes the curve. These concepts have important
applications in mechanics and diﬀerential geometry.
A primary objective of vector calculus is to express concepts in an intuitive and compact form.
Success is nowhere more apparent than in applications involving the partial diﬀerentiation of scalar and
vector ﬁelds. [Illustrations of such ﬁelds include implicit surface representation, fx; y; zðx; yÞ ¼ 0, the
electromagnetic potential function ðx; y; zÞ, and the electromagnetic vector ﬁeld Fðx; y; zÞ.]
To give
mathematics the capability of addressing theories involving such functions, William Rowen Hamilton
and others of the nineteenth century introduced derivative concepts called gradient, divergence, and curl,
and then developed an analytic structure around them.
An intuitive understanding of these entities begins with examination of the diﬀerential of a scalar
ﬁeld, i.e.,
d ¼ @
@x dx þ @
@y dy þ @
@z dz
Now suppose the function  is constant on a surface S and that C; x ¼ f1ðtÞ; y ¼ f2ðtÞ; z ¼ f3ðtÞ is a
curve on S.
At any point of this curve dr
dt ¼ dx
dt i þ dy
dt j þ dz
dt k lies in the tangent plane to the surface.
Since this statement is true for every surface curve through a given point, the diﬀerential dr spans the
tangent plane.
Thus, the triple @
@x, @
@y, @
@z represents a vector perpendicualr to S.
With this special
geometric characteristic in mind we deﬁne
r ¼ @
@x i þ @
@y j þ @
@z k
to be the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld .
Furthermore, we give the symbol r a special signiﬁcance by naming it del.
EXAMPLE 1.
If ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 is an implicity deﬁned surface, then, because the function always has the value zero
for points on it, the condition of constancy is satisﬁed and r is normal to the surface at any of its points.
This
allows us to form an equation for the tangent plane to the surface at any one of its points.
See Problem 7.36.
EXAMPLE 2.
For certain purposes, surfaces on which  is constant are called level surfaces.
In meteorology,
surfaces of equal temperature or of equal atmospheric pressure fall into this category.
From the previous devel-
opment, we see that r is perpendicular to the level surface at any one of its points and hence has the direction of
maximum change at that point.
The introduction of the vector operator r and the interaction of it with the multiplicative properties
of dot and cross come to mind.
Indeed, this line of thought does lead to new concepts called divergence
and curl.
A summary follows.
GRADIENT, DIVERGENCE, AND CURL
Consider the vector operator r (del) deﬁned by
r  i @
@x þ j @
@y þ k @
@z
ð11Þ
Then if ðx; y; zÞ and Aðx; y; zÞ have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives in a region (a condition which is
in many cases stronger than necessary), we can deﬁne the following.

In other words, r is a vector operator, not a vector.
When employing it the laws of
vector algebra either do not apply or at the very least must be validated.
In particular, r  A is a new
vector obtained by the speciﬁed partial diﬀerentiation on A, while A  r is an operator waiting to act
upon a vector or a scalar.

VECTOR INTERPRETATION OF JACOBIANS,

The transformation equations
x ¼ f ðu1; u2; u3Þ;
y ¼ gðu1; u2; u3Þ;
z ¼ hðu1; u2; u3Þ
ð15Þ
[where we assume that f ; g; h are continuous, have continuous partial derivatives, and have a single-
valued inverse] establish a one-to-one correspondence between points in an xyz and u1u2u3 rectangular
coordinate system.
In vector notation the transformation (17) can be written
r ¼ xi þ yj þ zk ¼ f ðu1; u2; u3Þi þ gðu1; u2; u3Þj þ hðu1; u2; u3Þk
ð16Þ
A point P in Fig. 7-12 can then be deﬁned not only by rectangular coordinates ðx; y; zÞ but by coordinates
ðu1; u2; u3Þ as well.
We call ðu1; u2; u3Þ the curvilinear coordinates of the point.
If u2 and u3 are constant, then as u1 varies, r describes a curve which we call the u1 coordinate curve.
Similarly, we deﬁne the u2 and u3 coordinate curves through P.
From (16), we have
dr ¼ @r
@u1
du1 þ @r
@u2
du2 þ @r
@u3
du3
ð17Þ
The collection of vectors @r
@x ; @r
@y ; @r
@z is a basis for the vector structure associated with the curvilinear
system.
If the curvilinear system is orthogonal, then so is this set; however, in general, the vectors are
not unit vectors. he diﬀerential form for arc length may be written
ds2 ¼ g11ðdu1Þ2 þ g22ðdu2Þ2 þ g33ðdu3Þ2
where
g11 ¼ @r
@x  @r
@x ;
g22 ¼ @r
@y  @r
@y ;
g33 ¼ @r
@z  @r
@z
The vector @r=@u1 is tangent to the u1 coordinate curve at P.
If e1 is a unit vector at P in this
direction, we can write @r=@u1 ¼ h1e1 where h1 ¼ j@r=@u1j.
Similarly we can write @r=@u2 ¼ h2e2 and
@r=@u3 ¼ h3e3, where h2 ¼ j@r=@u2j and h3 ¼ j@r=@u3j respectively.
Then (17) can be written

dr ¼ h1 du1e1 þ h2 du2e2 þ h3 du3e3
ð18Þ
The quantities h1; h2; h3 are sometimes caleld scale factors.
If e1; e2; e3 are mutually perpendicular at any point P, the curvilinear coordinates are called
orthogonal.
Since the basis elements are unit vectors as well as orthogonal this is an orthonormal
basis.
In such case the element of arc length ds is given by
ds2 ¼ dr  dr ¼ h2
1 du2
1 þ h2
2 du2
2 þ h2
3 du2

ð19Þ
and corresponds to the square of the length of the diagonal in the above parallelepiped.
Also, in the case of othogonal coordinates, referred to the orthonormal basis e1; e2; e3, the volume of
the parallelepiped is given by
dV ¼ jgjkjdu1du2du3 ¼ jðh1 du1e1Þ  ðh2 du2e2Þ  ðh3 du3e3Þj ¼ h1h2h3 du1du2du3

@ðu1; u2; u3Þ








du1du2du3
ð21Þ
where @ðx; y; zÞ=@ðu1; u2; u3Þ is the Jacobian of the transformation.
It is clear that when the Jacobian vanishes there is no parallelepiped and explains geometrically the
signiﬁcance of the vanishing of a Jacobian as treated in Chapter 6.
Note: The further signiﬁcance of the Jacobian vanishing is that the transformation degenerates at the
point.

Vector OP or A represents displacement of 3 mi due north.
Vector PQ or B represents displacement of 5 mi northeast.
Vector OQ or C represents the resultant displacement or sum

Prove that if a and b are non-collinear, then xa þ yb ¼ 0 implies x ¼ y ¼ 0.
Is the set fa; bg

Suppose x 6¼ 0. Then xa þ yb ¼ 0 implies xa ¼ yb or a ¼ ðy=xÞb, i.e., a and b must be parallel to the
same line (collinear), contrary to hypothesis.
Thus, x ¼ 0; then yb ¼ 0, from which y ¼ 0.
The set is
linearly independent.

If x1a þ y1b ¼ x2a þ y2b, where a and b are non-collinear, then x1 ¼ x2 and y1 ¼ y2.

x1a þ y1b  ðx2a þ y2bÞ ¼ 0
or
ðx1  x2Þa þ ðy1  y2Þb ¼ 0

But AB ¼ AP þ PB ¼ AP  BP, i.e., a ¼ yða þ bÞ  xðb  aÞ
¼ ðx þ yÞa þ ðy  xÞb.
Since a and b are non-collinear, we have by Problem 7.5,

THE CROSS OR VECTOR PRODUCT
7.16.
Prove A  B ¼ B  A.
A  B ¼ C has magnitude AB sin  and direction such that A, B, and C form a right-handed system [Fig.
7-24(a)].
B  A ¼ D has magnitude BA sin  and direction such that B, A, and D form a right-handed system
[Fig. 7-24(b)].
Then D has the same magnitude as C but is opposite in direction, i.e., C ¼ D or A  B ¼ B  A.
The commutative law for cross products is not valid.
7.17.
Prove that A  ðB þ CÞ ¼ A  B þ A  C for the case where A is perpendicular to B and also
to C.

VECTORS
[CHAP. 7

Since A is perpendicular to B, A  B is a vector perpendicular to the plane of A and B and having magnitude
AB sin 908 ¼ AB or magnitude of AB.
This is equivalent to multiplying vector B by A and rotating the
resultant vector through 908 to the position shown in Fig. 7-25.
Similarly, A  C is the vector obtained by multiplying C by A and rotating the resultant vector through
908 to the position shown.
In like manner, A  ðB þ CÞ is the vector obtained by multiplying B þ C by A and rotating the resultant
vector through 908 to the position shown.
Since A  ðB þ CÞ is the diagonal of the parallelogram with A  B and A  C as sides, we have
A  ðB þ CÞ ¼ A  B þ A  C.
7.18.
Prove that A  ðB þ CÞ ¼ A  B þ A  C in the general case where A, B, and C are non-
coplanar.
See Fig. 7-26.
Resolve B into two component vectors, one perpendicular to A and the other parallel to A, and denote
them by B? and Bk respectively.
Then B ¼ B? þ Bk.
If  is the angle between A and B, then B? ¼ B sin .
Thus the magnitude of A  B? is AB sin , the
same as the magnitude of A  B.
Also, the direction of A  B? is the same as the direction of A  B.
Hence A  B? ¼ A  B.
Similarly, if C is resolved into two component vectors Ck and C?, parallel and perpendicular respec-
tively to A, then A  C? ¼ A  C.
Also, since B þ C ¼ B? þ Bk þ C? þ Ck ¼ ðB? þ C?Þ þ ðBk þ CkÞ it follows that
A  ðB? þ C?Þ ¼ A  ðB þ CÞ
Now B? and C? are vectors perpendicular to A and so by Problem 7.17,
A  ðB? þ C?Þ ¼ A  B? þ A  C?
A  ðB þ CÞ ¼ A  B þ A  C
Then

Applications of Partial
Derivatives
APPLICATIONS TO GEOMETRY
The theoretical study of curves and surfaces began
more than two thousand years ago when Greek phi-
losopher-mathematicians explored the properties of
conic sections, helixes, spirals, and surfaces of revolu-
tion generated from them.
While applications were
not on their minds, many practical consequences
evolved.
These included representation of the ellipti-
cal paths of planets about the sun, employment of the
focal properties of paraboloids, and use of the special
properties of helixes to construct the double helical
model of DNA.
The analytic tool for studying functions of more
than one variable is the partial derivative. Surfaces are
a geometric starting point, since they are represented
by functions of two independent variables.
Vector
forms of many of these these concepts were introduced
in the previous chapter.
In this one, corresponding
coordinate equations are exhibited.
1.
Tangent Plane to a Surface.
Let Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 be the equation of a surface S such as shown in
Fig. 8-1.
We shall assume that F, and all other functions in this chapter, is continuously diﬀerentiable
unless otherwise indicated.
Suppose we wish to ﬁnd the equation of a tangent plane to S at the point
Pðx0; y0; z0Þ.
A vector normal to S at this point is N0 ¼ rFjP, the subscript P indicating that the
gradient is to be evaluated at the point Pðx0; y0; z0Þ.
If r0 and r are the vectors drawn respectively from O to Pðx0; y0; z0Þ and Qðx; y; zÞ on the plane, the
equation of the plane is
ðr  r0Þ  N0 ¼ ðr  r0Þ  rFjP ¼ 0
ð1Þ
since r  r0 is perpendicular to N0.

ð2Þ
In case the equation of the surface is given in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the form
Fðu1; u2; u3Þ ¼ 0, the equation of the tangent plane can be obtained using the result on Page 162 for
the gradient in these coordinates.
See Problem 8.4.
2.
Normal Line to a Surface.
Suppose we require equations for the normal line to the surface S at
Pðx0; y0; z0Þ i.e., the line perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at P.
If we now let r be the
vector drawn from O in Fig. 8-1 to any point ðx; y; zÞ on the normal N0, we see that r  r0 is collinear
with N0 and so the required condition is
ðr  r0Þ  N0 ¼ ðr  r0Þ  rFjP ¼ 0
ð3Þ
By expressing the cross product in the determinant form

Setting each of these ratios equal to a parameter (such as t or u) and solving for x, y; and z yields the
parametric equations of the normal line.
The equations for the normal line can also be written when the equation of the surface is expressed
in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.
(See Problem 8.1(b).)
3. Tangent Line to a Curve.
Let the parametric equations of curve C
of Fig. 8-2 be
x ¼ f ðuÞ; y ¼ gðuÞ; z ¼ hðuÞ; where we shall suppose, unless otherwise indicated, that f , g; and h are
continuously diﬀerentiable. We wish to ﬁnd equations for the tangent line to C at the point Pðx0; y0; z0Þ
where u ¼ u0.

. If r0 and r
denote the vectors drawn respectively from O to Pðx0; y0; z0Þ and Qðx; y; zÞ on the tangent line, then since
r  r0 is collinear with T0 we have
ðr  r0Þ  T0 ¼ ðr  r0Þ  dR
du




P

ð5Þ
In rectangular form this becomes
x  x0
f 0ðu0Þ ¼ y  y0
g 0ðu0Þ ¼ z  z0
h 0ðu0Þ
ð6Þ
The parametric form is obtained by setting each ratio equal to u.
If the curve C is given as the intersection of two surfaces with equations Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 and
Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 observe that rF  rG has the direction of the line of intersection of the tangent planes;
therefore, the corresponding equations of the tangent line are

Note that the determinants in (7) are Jacobians.
A similar result can be found when the surfaces are
given in terms of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.
4.
Normal Plane to a Curve.
Suppose we wish to ﬁnd an equation for the normal plane to curve C
at Pðx0; y0; z0Þ of Fig. 8-2 (i.e., the plane perpendicular to the tangent line to C at this point). Letting r be
the vector from O to any point ðx; y; zÞ on this plane, it follows that r  r0 is perpendicular to T0.
Then
the required equation is
ðr  r0Þ  T0 ¼ ðr  r0Þ  dR
du




P
¼ 0
ð8Þ
When the curve has parametric equations x ¼ f ðuÞ; y ¼ gðuÞ; z ¼ hðuÞ this becomes
f 0ðu0Þðx  x0Þ þ g 0ðu0Þð y  y0Þ þ h 0ðu0Þðz  z0Þ ¼ 0
ð9Þ
Furthermore, when the curve is the intersection of the implicitly deﬁned surfaces
Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0

Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0
then

Envelopes.
Solutions of diﬀerential equations in two variables are geometrically represented by
one-parameter families of curves.
Sometimes such a family characterizes a curve called an envelope.
For example, the family of all lines (see Problem 8.9) one unit from the origin may be represented by
x sin 	  y cos 	  1 ¼ 0, where 	 is a parameter.
The envelope of this family is the circle x2 þ y2 ¼ 1.
If ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 is a one-parameter family of curves in the xy plane, there may be a curve E which is
tangent at each point to some member of the family and such that each member of the family is tangent
to E.
If E exists, its equation can be found by solving simultaneously the equations
ðx; y; 	Þ ¼ 0;
	ðx; y; 	Þ ¼ 0
ð11Þ
and E is called the envelope of the family.
CHAP. 8]
APPLICATIONS OF PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
185

The result can be extended to determine the envelope of a one-parameter family of surfaces
ðx; y; z; 	Þ.
This envelope can be found from
ðx; y; z; 	Þ ¼ 0;
	ðx; y; z; 	Þ ¼ 0
ð12Þ
Extensions to two- (or more) parameter families can be made.

curve

the length of arc of the curve between those points.

ð15Þ
from which it follows that the directional derivative is given by the component of rF in the direction of
the tangent to C.
In the previous chapter we observed the following fact:
The maximum value of the directional derivative is given by jrFj.
These maxima occur in directions normal to the surfaces Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ c (where c is any constant)
which are sometimes called equipotential surfaces or level surfaces.

including u1 @ x @ u2, a @ 	 @ b and if u1 and u2 are continuous and have continuous derivatives for
a @ 	 @ b.
In case u1 and u2 are constants, the last two terms of (17) are zero.
The result (17), called Leibnitz’s rule, is often useful in evaluating deﬁnite integrals (see Problems
8.15, 8.29).

MAXIMA AND MINIMA
In Chapter 4 we brieﬂy examined relative extrema for functions of one variable.
The general idea
was that for points of the graph of y ¼ gðxÞ that were locally highest or lowest, the condition g 0ðxÞ ¼ 0
was necessary. Such points P0ðx0Þ were called critical points. (See Fig. 8-3a,b.) The condition g 0ðxÞ ¼ 0
was useful in searching for relative maxima and minima but it was not decisive.
(See Fig. 8-3(c).)
To determine the exact nature of the function at a critical point P0, g 00ðx0Þ had to be examined.

need for further investigation.
This section describes the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for relative extrema of functions of two
variables.
Geometrically we think of surfaces, S, represented by z ¼ f ðx; yÞ.
If at a point P0ðx0; y0Þ
then fxðx; y0Þ ¼ 0, means that the curve of intersection of S and the plane y ¼ y0 has a tangent parallel to
the x-axis.
Similarly fyðx0; y0Þ ¼ 0 indicates that the curve of intersection of S and the cross section
x ¼ x0 has a tangent parallel the y-axis.
(See Problem 8.20.)
Thus
fxðx; y0Þ ¼ 0; fyðx0; yÞ ¼ 0
are necessary conditions for a relative extrema of z ¼ f ðx; yÞ at P0; however, they are not suﬃcient
because there are directions associated with a rotation through 3608 that have not been examined.
Of
course, no diﬀerentiation between relative maxima and relative minima has been made.
(See Fig. 8-4.)
A very special form, fxy  fxfy invariant under plane rotation, and capable of characterizing the
roots of a quadratic equation, Ax2 þ 2Bx þ C ¼ 0, allows us to form suﬃcient conditions for
relative extrema.
(See Problem 8.21.)

METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS FOR MAXIMA AND MINIMA
A method for obtaining the relative maximum or minimum values of a function Fðx; y; zÞ subject to
a constraint condition ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0, consists of the formation of the auxiliary function
Gðx; y; zÞ  Fðx; y; zÞ þ ðx; y; zÞ
ð21Þ
subject to the conditions
@G
@x ¼ 0;
@G
@y ¼ 0;
@G
@z ¼ 0
ð22Þ
which are necessary conditions for a relative maximum or minimum.
The parameter , which is
independent of x; y; z, is called a Lagrange multiplier.
The conditions (22) are equivalent to rG ¼ 0, and hence, 0 ¼ rF þ r
Geometrically, this means that rF and r are parallel.
This fact gives rise to the method of
Lagrange multipliers in the following way.
Let the maximum value of F on ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 be A and suppose it occurs at P0ðx0; y0; z0Þ.
(A
similar argument can be made for a minimum value of F.) Now consider a family of surfaces
Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ C.
The member Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ A passes through P0, while those surfaces Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ B with B < A do
not.
(This choice of a surface, i.e., f ðx; y; zÞ ¼ A, geometrically imposes the condition ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 on
F.) Since at P0 the condition 0 ¼ rF þ r tells us that the gradients of Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ A and ðx; y; zÞ are
parallel, we know that the surfaces have a common tangent plane at a point that is maximum for F.
Thus, rG ¼ 0 is a necessary condition for a relative maximum of F at P0.
Of course, the condition is
not suﬃcient.
The critical point so determined may not be unique and it may not produce a relative
extremum.
The method can be generalized.
If we wish to ﬁnd the relative maximum or minimum values of a
function Fðx1; x2; x3; . . . ; xnÞ subject to the constraint conditions ðx1; . . . ; xnÞ ¼ 0; 2ðx1; . . . ; xnÞ ¼

F ¼ x2  2yz þ y3  4 ¼ 0
and
G ¼ x2 þ 1  ð2  4aÞy2  az2 ¼ 0
Then
rF ¼ 2xi þ ð3y2  2zÞj  2yk;
rG ¼ 2xi  2ð2  4aÞyj  2azk
Thus, the normals to the two surfaces at ð1; 1; 2Þ are given by
N1 ¼ 2i  j þ 2k;
N2 ¼ 2i þ 2ð2  4aÞj  4ak
Since N1  N2 ¼ ð2Þð2Þ  2ð2  4aÞ  ð2Þð4aÞ  0, it follows that N1 and N2 are perpendicular for all a,

Suppose the curve is deﬁned by the intersection of two surfaces whose equations are Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0,

The normals to each surface at point P are given respectively by N1 ¼ rFjP and N2 ¼ rGjP.

ENVELOPES
8.8.
Prove that the envelope of the family ðx; y; 	Þ ¼ 0, if it exists, can be obtained by solving
simultaneously the equations  ¼ 0 and 	 ¼ 0.
Assume parametric equations of the envelope to be x ¼ f ð	Þ; y ¼ gð	Þ.
Then ð f ð	Þ; gð	Þ; 	Þ ¼ 0
identically, and so upon diﬀerentiating with respect to 	 [assuming that , f and g have continuous deriva-
tives], we have
x f 0ð	Þ þ yg 0ð	Þ þ 	 ¼ 0

The slope of any member of the family ðx; y; 	Þ ¼ 0 at ðx; yÞ is given by x dx þ y dy ¼ 0 or dy

	ðx; y; 	Þ ¼ x cos 	  y cos 	 ¼ 0.
From these equations we ﬁnd
x ¼ sin 	; y ¼ cos 	 or x2 þ y2 ¼ 1.

The given family is a family of straight lines, some members of which

 ¼ 2	x  	2y  z ¼ 0
and
ð2Þ
	 ¼ 2x  2	y ¼ 0
From (2) 	 ¼ x=y.
Then substitution in (1) yields x2 ¼ yz, the required envelope.

Find the envelope of the two-parameter family of surfaces z ¼ 	x þ

The envelope of the family Fðx; y; z; 	;

 between the
equations F ¼ 0; F	 ¼ 0; F

Now
F ¼ z  	x 

fxðx0; y0Þ ¼ 0, fyðx0; y0Þ ¼ 0 (using results for functions of one variable).
8.21.
Let f be continuous and have continuous partial derivatives of order two, at least, in a region R
with the critical point P0ðx0; y0Þ an interior point. Determine the suﬃcient conditions for relative
extrema at P0.
In the case of one variable, suﬃcient conditions for a relative extrema were formulated through the
second derivative [if positive then a relative minimum, if negative then a relative maximum, if zero a possible
point of inﬂection but more investigation is necessary]. In the case of z ¼ f ðx; yÞ that is before us we can
expect the second partial derivatives to supply information.
(See Fig. 8-6.)
First observe that solutions of the quadratic equation
At2 þ 2Bt þ C ¼ 0 are t ¼ 2B 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

Further observe that the nature of these solutions is determined by B2  AC. If the quantity is positive
the solutions are real and distinct; if negative, they are complex conjugate; and if zero, the two solutions are
coincident.

The expression B2  AC also has the property of invariance with respect to plane rotations
x ¼ x cos   y sin 
y ¼ x sin  þ y cos 
It has been discovered that with the identiﬁcations A ¼ fxx; B ¼ fxy; C ¼ fyy, we have the partial deri-
vative form f 2
xy  fxxfyy that characterizes relative extrema.
The demonstration of invariance of this form can be found in analytic geometric books.
However, if
you would like to put the problem in the context of the second partial derivative, observe that
f x ¼ fx
@x
@ x þ fy
@y
@ x ¼ fx cos  þ fy sin 
fy ¼ fx
@x
@ y þ fy
@y
@y ¼ fx sin  þ fy cos 
Then using the chain rule to compute the second partial derivatives and proceeding by straightforward
but tedious calculation one shows that
f 2
xy ¼ fxxfyy ¼ f 2
x y  f x xfy y:
The following equivalences are a consequence of this invariant form (independently of direction in the
tangent plane at P0):
f 2
xy  fxx fyy < 0
and
fxx fyy > 0
ð1Þ
f 2
xy  fxx fyy > 0
and
fxx fyy < 0
ð2Þ
The key relation is (1) because in order that this equivalence hold, both fx fy must have the same sign.
We can look to the one variable case (make the same argument for each coordinate direction) and conclude
that there is a relative minimum at P0 if both partial derivatives are positive and a relative maximum if both
are negative.
We can make this argument for any pair of coordinate directions because of the invariance
under rotation that was established.
If (2) holds, then the point is called a saddle point. If the quadratic form is zero, no information results.
Observe that this situation is analogous to the one variable extreme value theory in which the nature of
f at x, and with f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0, is undecided if f 00ðxÞ ¼ 0.
8.22.
Find the relative maxima and minima of f ðx; yÞ ¼ x3 þ y3  3x  12y þ 20.
fx ¼ 3x2  3 ¼ 0 when x ¼ 1; fy ¼ 3y2  12 ¼ 0 when y ¼ 2.
Then critical points are Pð1; 2Þ,
Qð1; 2Þ; Rð1; 2Þ; Sð1; 2Þ.
fxx ¼ 6x; fyy ¼ 6y; fxy ¼ 0.
Then  ¼ fxxfyy  f 2
xy ¼ 36xy.
At Pð1; 2Þ;  > 0 and fxx (or fyyÞ > 0; hence P is a relative minimum point.
At Qð1; 2Þ;  < 0 and Q is neither a relative maximum or minimum point.
At Rð1; 2Þ;  < 0 and R is neither a relative maximum or minimum point.
At Sð1; 2Þ;  > 0 and fxx (or fyyÞ < 0 so S is a relative maximum point.
Thus, the relative minimum value of f ðx; yÞ occurring at P is 2, while the relative maximum value
occurring at S is 38. Points Q and R are saddle points.

LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS FOR MAXIMA AND MINIMA
8.24.
Consider Fðx; y; zÞ subject to the constraint condition Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0.
Prove that a necessary
condition that Fðx; y; zÞ have an extreme value is that FxGy  FyGx ¼ 0.
Since Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0, we can consider z as a function of x and y, say z ¼ f ðx; yÞ.
A necessary condition
that F½x; y; f ðx; yÞ have an extreme value is that the partial derivatives with respect to x and y be zero. This
gives
ð1Þ
Fx þ Fzzx ¼ 0
ð2Þ
Fy þ FzZy ¼ 0
Since Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0, we also have
ð3Þ
Gx þ Gxzx ¼ 0
ð4Þ
Gy þ Gzzy ¼ 0
From (1) and (3) we have (5) FxGx  FxGx ¼ 0, and from (2) and (4) we have (6) FyGz  FzGy ¼ 0.
Then
from (5) and (6) we ﬁnd FxGy  FyGx ¼ 0:
The above results hold only if Fz 6¼ 0; Gz 6¼ 0.
8.25.
Referring to the preceding problem, show that the stated condition is equivalent to the conditions
x ¼ 0; y ¼ 0 where  ¼ F þ G and  is a constant.
If x ¼ 0; Fx þ Gx ¼ 0.
If y ¼ 0; Fy þ Gy ¼ 0.
Elimination of  between these equations yields
FxGy  FyGx ¼ 0.
The multiplier  is the Lagrange multiplier.
If desired we can consider equivalently  ¼ F þ G where
x ¼ 0; y ¼ 0.

Find the shortest distance from the origin to the hyperbola x2 þ 8xy þ 7y2 ¼ 225, z ¼ 0.
We must ﬁnd the minimum value of x2 þ y2 (the square of the distance from the origin to any point in
the xy plane) subject to the constraint x2 þ 8xy þ 7y2 ¼ 225.
According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we consider  ¼ x2 þ 8xy þ 7y2  225 þ ðx2 þ y2Þ.
Then
x ¼ 2x þ 8y þ 2x ¼ 0

From (1) or (2), y ¼ 2x and substitution in x2 þ 8xy þ 7y2 ¼ 225 yields 45x2 ¼ 225.

From the second constraint condition, x þ y  z ¼ 0, we obtain on division by 2, assumed dif-
ferent from zero (this is justiﬁed since otherwise we would have x ¼ 0; y ¼ 0; z ¼ 0, which would not
satisfy the ﬁrst constraint condition), the result

The value of x2 þ y2 þ z2 corresponding to these is ð1600 þ 1225 þ 25Þ=646 ¼ 75=17.
Thus, the required maximum value is 10 and the minimum value is 75/17.
(b)
Since x2 þ y2 þ z2 represents the square of the distance of ðx; y; zÞ from the origin ð0; 0; 0Þ, the problem
is equivalent to determining the largest and smallest distances from the origin to the curve of intersec-
tion of the ellipsoid x2=4 þ y2=5 þ z2=25 ¼ 1 and the plane z ¼ x þ y.
Since this curve is an ellipse, we
have the interpretation that
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
10
p
and
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of
this ellipse.
The fact that the maximum and minimum values happen to be given by 1 in both Case 1 and
Case 2 is more than a coincidence.
It follows, in fact, on multiplying equations (1) by x, y, and z in
succession and adding, for we then obtain

Multiple Integrals
Much of the procedure for double and triple integrals may be
thought of as a reversal of partial diﬀerentiation and otherwise is
analogous to that for single integrals.
However, one complexity
that must be addressed relates to the domain of deﬁnition.
With
single integrals, the functions of one variable were deﬁned on
intervals of real numbers.
Thus, the integrals only depended on
the properties of the functions.
The integrands of double and
triple integrals are functions of two and three variables, respec-
tively, and as such are deﬁned on two- and three-dimensional
regions.
These regions have a ﬂexibility in shape not possible
in the single-variable cases.
For example, with functions of two
variables, and the corresponding double integrals, rectangular
regions, a @ x @ b, c @ y @ d are common.
However, in
many problems the domains are regions bound above and below by segments of plane curves.
In
the case of functions of three variables, and the corresponding triple integrals other than the regions
a @ x @ b; c @ y @ d; e @ z @ f , there are those bound above and below by portions of surfaces.
In
very special cases, double and triple integrals can be directly evaluated.
However, the systematic
technique of iterated integration is the usual procedure.
It is here that the reversal of partial diﬀerentia-
tion comes into play.
Deﬁnitions of double and triple integrals are given below.
Also, the method of iterated integration
is described.
DOUBLE INTEGRALS
Let Fðx; yÞ be deﬁned in a closed region r of the xy plane (see Fig. 9-1).
Subdivide r into n
subregions rk of area Ak, k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n.
Let ðk; kÞ be some point of Ak. Form the sum

where the limit is taken so that the number n of subdivisions increases without limit and such that the
largest linear dimension of each Ak approaches zero. See Fig. 9-2(a). If this limit exists, it is denoted by
ð
r
ð
Fðx; yÞ dA
ð3Þ
and is called the double integral of Fðx; yÞ over the region r.
It can be proved that the limit does exist if Fðx; yÞ is continuous (or sectionally continuous) in r.
The double integral has a great variety of interpretations with any individual one dependent on the
form of the integrand.
For example, if Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðx; yÞ represents the variable density of a ﬂat iron
plate then the double integral,
Ð
A  dA, of this function over a same shaped plane region, A, is the mass of
the plate. In Fig. 9-2(b) we assume that Fðx; yÞ is a height function (established by a portion of a surface
z ¼ Fðx; yÞÞ for a cylindrically shaped object.
In this case the double integral represents a volume.
ITERATED INTEGRALS
If r is such that any lines parallel to the y-axis meet the boundary of r in at most two points (as is
true in Fig. 9-1), then we can write the equations of the curves ACB and ADB bounding r as y ¼ f1ðxÞ
and y ¼ f2ðxÞ, respectively, where f1ðxÞ and f2ðxÞ are single-valued and continuous in a @ x @ b. In this
case we can evaluate the double integral (3) by choosing the regions rk as rectangles formed by
constructing a grid of lines parallel to the x- and y-axes and Ak as the corresponding areas.
Then
(3) can be written
ð ð

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
[CHAP. 9

where the integral in braces is to be evaluated ﬁrst (keeping x constant) and ﬁnally integrating with
respect to x from a to b. The result (4) indicates how a double integral can be evaluated by expressing it
in terms of two single integrals called iterated integrals.
The process of iterated integration is visually illustrated in Fig. 9-3a,b and further illustrated as
follows.
The general idea, as demonstrated with respect to a given three-space region, is to establish a plane
section, integrate to determine its area, and then add up all the plane sections through an integration
with respect to the remaining variable. For example, choose a value of x (say, x ¼ x 0Þ. The intersection
of the plane x ¼ x 0 with the solid establishes the plane section.
In it z ¼ Fðx 0; yÞ is the height function,
and if y ¼ f1ðxÞ and y ¼ f2ðxÞ (for all z) are the bounding cylindrical surfaces of the solid, then the width
is f2ðx 0Þ  f1ðx 0Þ, i.e., y2  y1.
Thus, the area of the section is A ¼
ðy2
y1
Fðx 0; yÞ dy.
Now establish slabs
Ajxj, where for each interval xj ¼ xj  xj1, there is an intermediate value x 0
j . Then sum these to get
an approximation to the target volume.
Adding the slabs and taking the limit yields
V ¼ lim

In some cases the order of integration is dictated by the geometry. For example, if r is such that any
lines parallel to the x-axis meet the boundary of r in at most two points (as in Fig. 9-1), then the
equations of curves CAD and CBD can be written x ¼ g1ðyÞ and x ¼ g2ð yÞ respectively and we ﬁnd
similarly

If the double integral exists, (4) and (5) yield the same value. (See, however, Problem 9.21.) In writing a
double integral, either of the forms (4) or (5), whichever is appropriate, may be used.
We call one form
an interchange of the order of integration with respect to the other form.

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

In case r is not of the type shown in the above ﬁgure, it can generally be subdivided into regions
r1; r2; . . . which are of this type.
Then the double integral over r is found by taking the sum of the
double integrals over r1; r2; . . . .
TRIPLE INTEGRALS
The above results are easily generalized to closed regions in three dimensions.
For example,
consider a function Fðx; y; zÞ deﬁned in a closed three-dimensional region r.
Subdivide the region
into n subregions of volume Vk, k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n.
Letting ðk; k; kÞ be some point in each subregion,
we form
lim

X
n
k¼1
Fðk; k; kÞ Vk
ð6Þ
where the number n of subdivisions approaches inﬁnity in such a way that the largest linear dimension of
each subregion approaches zero.
If this limit exists, we denote it by
ð ð
r
ð
Fðx; y; zÞ dV
ð7Þ
called the triple integral of Fðx; y; zÞ over r. The limit does exist if Fð; x; y; zÞ is continuous (or piecemeal
continuous) in r.
If we construct a grid consisting of planes parallel to the xy, yz, and xz planes, the region r is
subdivided into subregions which are rectangular parallelepipeds. In such case we can express the triple
integral over r given by (7) as an iterated integral of the form

(where the innermost integral is to be evaluated ﬁrst) or the sum of such integrals.
The integration can
also be performed in any other order to give an equivalent result.
The iterated triple integral is a sequence of integrations; ﬁrst from surface portion to surface portion,
then from curve segment to curve segment, and ﬁnally from point to point.
(See Fig. 9-4.)
Extensions to higher dimensions are also possible.

TRANSFORMATIONS OF MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
In evaluating a multiple integral over a region r, it is often convenient to use coordinates other than
rectangular, such as the curvilinear coordinates considered in Chapters 6 and 7.
If we let ðu; vÞ be curvilinear coordinates of points in a plane, there will be a set of transformation
equations x ¼ f ðu; vÞ; y ¼ gðu; vÞ mapping points ðx; yÞ of the xy plane into points ðu; vÞ of the uv plane.
In such case the region r of the xy plane is mapped into a region r 0 of the uv plane.
We then have

is the Jacobian of x and y with respect to u and v (see Chapter 6).
Similarly if ðu; v; wÞ are curvilinear coordinates in three dimensions, there will be a set of transfor-
mation equations x ¼ f ðu; v; wÞ; y ¼ gðu; v; wÞ; z ¼ hðu; v; wÞ and we can write

Generalizations to higher dimensions are easily made.
THE DIFFERENTIAL ELEMENT OF AREA IN POLAR COORDINATES, DIFFERENTIAL
ELEMENTS OF AREA IN CYLINDRAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES
Of special interest is the diﬀerential element of area, dA, for polar coordinates in the plane, and the
diﬀerential elements of volume, dV, for cylindrical and spherical coordinates in three space. With these
in hand the double and triple integrals as expressed in these systems are seen to take the following forms.
(See Fig. 9-5.)
The transformation equations relating cylindrical coordinates to rectangular Cartesian ones
appeared in Chapter 7, in particular,
x ¼  cos ; y ¼  sin ; z ¼ z
The coordinate surfaces are circular cylinders, planes, and planes.

The integration with respect to y (keeping x constant) from y ¼ 1 to y ¼ x2 corresponds formally
to summing in a vertical column (see Fig. 9-6). The subsequent integration with respect to x from x ¼ 1

summing the cubical volumes (indicated by dVÞ in a vertical column extending from the xy plane to the
paraboloid.
The subsequent integration with respect to  (keeping  constant) from  ¼ 0 to  ¼ a
corresponds to addition of volumes of all columns in the wedge-shaped region.
Finally, integration with
respect to  corresponds to adding volumes of all such wedge-shaped regions.
The integration can also be performed in other orders to yield the same result.
We can also set up the integral by determining the region r 0 in ; ; z space into which r is mapped by
the cylindrical coordinate transformation.

In spherical coordinates the equation

Line Integrals, Surface
Integrals, and Integral
Theorems
Construction of mathematical models of physical phenomena requires functional domains of greater
complexity than the previously employed line segments and plane regions.
This section makes progress
in meeting that need by enriching integral theory with the introduction of segments of curves and
portions of surfaces as domains.
Thus, single integrals as functions deﬁned on curve segments take
on new meaning and are then called line integrals. Stokes’s theorem exhibits a striking relation between
the line integral of a function on a closed curve and the double integral of the surface portion that is
enclosed.
The divergence theorem relates the triple integral of a function on a three-dimensional region
of space to its double integral on the bounding surface.
The elegant language of vectors best describes
these concepts; therefore, it would be useful to reread the introduction to Chapter 7, where the impor-
tance of vectors is emphasized.
(The integral theorems also are expressed in coordinate form.)
LINE INTEGRALS
The objective of this section is to geometrically view the domain of a vector or scalar function as a
segment of a curve.
Since the curve is deﬁned on an interval of real numbers, it is possible to refer the
function to this primitive domain, but to do so would suppress much geometric insight.
A curve, C, in three-dimensional space may be represented by parametric equations:
x ¼ f1ðtÞ; y ¼ f2ðtÞ; z ¼ f3ðtÞ;
a @ t @ b
ð1Þ
or in vector notation:
x ¼ rðtÞ
ð2Þ
where
rðtÞ ¼ xi þ yj þ zk
(see Fig. 10-1).
Copyright 2002, 1963 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use.

For this discussion it is assumed that r is continuously diﬀerentiable.
While (as we are doing) it is
convenient to refer the Euclidean space to a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, it is not necessary.
(For example, cylindrical and spherical coordinates sometimes are more useful.)
In fact, one of the
objectives of the vector language is to free us from any particular frame of reference.
Then, a vector
A½xðtÞ; yðtÞ; zðtÞ or a scalar, , is pictured on the domain C, which according to the parametric repre-
sentation, is referred to the real number interval a @ t @ b.
The Integral
ð
C
A  dr
ð3Þ
of a vector ﬁeld A deﬁned on a curve segment C is called a line integral.
The integrand has the
representation
A1 dx þ A2 dy þ A3 dz
obtained by expanding the dot product.

can be interpreted as line integrals; however, they do not play a major role [except for the fact that the
scalar integral (3) takes the form (4)].
The following three basic ways are used to evaluate the line integral (3):
1.
The parametric equations are used to express the integrand through the parameter t. Then
ð
C
A  dr ¼
ðt2
t1
A  dr
dt dt
2.
If the curve C is a plane curve (for example, in the xy plane) and has one of the representations
y ¼ f ðxÞ or x ¼ gðyÞ, then the two integrals that arise are evaluated with respect to x or y,
whichever is more convenient.

If the integrand is a perfect diﬀerential, then it may be evaluated through knowledge of the end
points (that is, without reference to any particular joining curve). (See the section on indepen-
dence of path on Page 232; also see Page 237.)
These techniques are further illustrated below for plane curves and for three space in the problems.
EVALUATION OF LINE INTEGRALS FOR PLANE CURVES
If the equation of a curve C in the plane z ¼ 0 is given as y ¼ f ðxÞ, the line integral (2) is evaluated
by placing y ¼ f ðxÞ; dy ¼ f 0ðxÞ dx in the integrand to obtain the deﬁnite integral
ða2
a1
Pfx; f ðxÞg dx þ Qfx; f ðxÞg f 0ðxÞ dx
ð7Þ
which is then evaluated in the usual manner.
Similarly, if C is given as x ¼ gðyÞ, then dx ¼ g 0ðyÞ dy and the line integral becomes
ðb2
b1
Pfgð yÞ; ygg 0ð yÞ dy þ Qfgð yÞ; yg dy
ð8Þ
If C is given in parametric form x ¼ ðtÞ; y ¼  ðtÞ, the line integral becomes
ðt2
t1
PfðtÞ;  ðtÞg 0ðtÞ dt þ QfðtÞ;  ðtÞg;  0ðtÞ dt
ð9Þ
where t1 and t2 denote the values of t corresponding to points A and B, respectively.
Combinations of the above methods may be used in the evaluation.
If the integrand A  dr is a
perfect diﬀerential, d, then
ð

A  dr ¼

SIMPLE CLOSED CURVES, SIMPLY AND MULTIPLY CONNECTED REGIONS
A simple closed curve is a closed curve which does not intersect itself anywhere.
Mathematically, a
curve in the xy plane is deﬁned by the parametric equations x ¼ ðtÞ; y ¼  ðtÞ where  and  are single-
valued and continuous in an interval t1 @ t @ t2.
If ðt1Þ ¼ ðt2Þ and  ðt1Þ ¼  ðt2Þ, the curve is said to
be closed.
If ðuÞ ¼ ðvÞ and  ðuÞ ¼  ðvÞ only when u ¼ v (except in the special case where u ¼ t1 and
v ¼ t2), the curve is closed and does not intersect itself and so is a simple closed curve.
We shall also
assume, unless otherwise stated, that  and  are piecewise diﬀerentiable in t1 @ t @ t2.
If a plane region has the property that any closed
curve in it can be continuously shrunk to a point
without leaving the region, then the region is called
simply connected; otherwise, it is called multiply con-
nected (see Fig. 10-2 and Page 118 of Chapter 6).
As the parameter t varies from t1 to t2, the plane
curve is described in a certain sense or direction.
For curves in the xy plane, we arbitrarily describe
this direction as positive or negative according as a person traversing the curve in this direction with his
head pointing in the positive z direction has the region enclosed by the curve always toward his left or
right, respectively.
If we look down upon a simple closed curve in the xy plane, this amounts to saying
that traversal of the curve in the counterclockwise direction is taken as positive while traversal in the
clockwise direction is taken as negative.
GREEN’S THEOREM IN THE PLANE
This theorem is needed to prove Stokes’ theorem (Page 237). Then it becomes a special case of that
theorem.
Let P, Q, @P=@y; @Q=@x be single-valued and continuous in a simply connected region r bounded by
a simple closed curve C.
Then

where

This theorem is also true for regions bounded by two or more closed curves (i.e., multiply connected
regions).
See Problem 10.10.
CONDITIONS FOR A LINE INTEGRAL TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE PATH
The line integral of a vector ﬁeld A is independent of path if its value is the same regardless of the
(allowable) path from initial to terminal point.
(Thus, the integral is evaluated from knowledge of the
coordinates of these two points.)
For example, the integral of the vector ﬁeld A ¼ yi þ xj is independent of path since
ð
C
A  dr ¼
ð
C
y dx þ x dy ¼
ðx2y2
x1y1
dðxyÞ ¼ x2y2  x1y1
Thus, the value of the integral is obtained without reference to the curve joining P1 and P2.
This notion of the independence of path of line integrals of certain vector ﬁelds, important to theory
and application, is characterized by the following three theorems:
Theorem 1.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition that
ð
C
A  dr be independent of path is that there
exists a scalar function  such that A ¼ r.

[CHAP. 10
Fig. 10-2

Theorem 2.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition that the line integral,
ð
C
A  dr be independent of path
is that r  A ¼ 0.
Theorem 3.
If r  A ¼ 0, then the line integral of A over an allowable closed path is 0, i.e.,
þ
A  dr ¼ 0.
If C is a plane curve, then Theorem 3 follows immediately from Green’s theorem, since in the plane
case r  A reduces to
@A1
@y ¼ @A2
@x
EXAMPLE.
Newton’s second law for forces is F ¼ dðmvÞ
dt
, where m is the mass of an object and v is its velocity.
When F has the representation F ¼ r, it is said to be conservative.
The previous theorems tell us that the
integrals of conservative ﬁelds of force are independent of path.
Furthermore, showing that r  F ¼ 0 is the
preferred way of showing that F is conservative, since it involves diﬀerentiation, while demonstrating that  exists
such that F ¼ r requires integration.
SURFACE INTEGRALS
Our previous double integrals have been related to a very special surface, the plane.
Now we
consider other surfaces, yet, the approach is quite similar.
Surfaces can be viewed intrinsically, i.e., as
non-Euclidean spaces; however, we do not do that.
Rather, the surface is thought of as embedded in a
three-dimensional Euclidean space and expressed through a two-parameter vector representation:
x ¼ rðv1; v2Þ
While the purpose of the vector representation is to be general (that is, interpretable through any
allowable three-space coordinate system), it is convenient to initially think in terms of rectangular
Cartesian coordinates; therefore, assume
r ¼ xi þ yj þ zk
and that there is a parametric representation
x ¼ rðv1; v2Þ; y ¼ rðv1; v2Þ; z ¼ rðv1; v2Þ
ð11Þ
The functions are assumed to be continuously diﬀerentiable.
The parameter curves v2 ¼ const and v1 ¼ const establish a coordinate system on the surface (just as
y ¼ const, and x ¼ const form such a system in the plane).
The key to establishing the surface integral
of a function is the diﬀerential element of surface area.
(For the plane that element is dA ¼ dx; dy.)
At any point, P, of the surface
dx ¼ @r
@v1
dv1 þ @r
@v2
dv2
spans the tangent plane to the surface.
In particular, the directions of the coordinate curves v2 ¼ const
and v1 ¼ const are designated by dx1 ¼ @r
@v1
dv1 and dx2 ¼ @r
@v2
dv2, respectively (see Fig. 10-3).
The cross product
dx1x dx2 ¼ @r
@v1
 @r
@v2
dv1 dv2

 @r

parallelogram.

(This is the usual geometric interpretation of the cross product abstracted to the diﬀerential level.)

If the surface is given in the implicit form Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0, then the gradient may be employed to
obtain another representation.
To establish it, recall that at any surface point P the gradient, rF is
perpendicular (normal) to the tangent plane (and hence to S).
Therefore, the following equality of the unit vectors holds (up to sign):

[Now a conclusion of the theory of implicit functions is that from Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 (and under appro-
priate conditions) there can be produced an explicit representation z ¼ f ðx; yÞ of a portion of the surface.
This is an existence statement.
The theorem does not say that this representation can be explicitly
produced.]

The formulas (14) and (16) also can be introduced in the following nonvectorial manner.
Let S be a two-sided surface having projection r on the xy plane as in the adjoining Fig. 10-4.
Assume that an equation for S is z ¼ f ðx; yÞ, where f is single-valued and continous for all x and y in r .
Divide r into n subregions of area Ap; p ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, and erect a vertical column on each of these
subregions to intersect S in an area Sp.
Let ðx; y; zÞ be single-valued and continuous at all points of S. Form the sum

where ðp; p; pÞ is some point of Sp.
If the limit of this sum as n ! 1 in such a way that each
Sp ! 0 exists, the resulting limit is called the surface integral of ðx; y; zÞ over S and is designated by
ð ð
S
ðx; y; zÞ dS

Since Sp ¼ j sec pj Ap approximately, where p is the angle between the normal line to S and the
positive z-axis, the limit of the sum (17) can be written

The results (21) or (22) can be used to evaluate (18).
In the above we have assumed that S is such that any line parallel to the z-axis intersects S in only
one point.
In case S is not of this type, we can usually subdivide S into surfaces S1; S2; . . . ; which are of
this type.
Then the surface integral over S is deﬁned as the sum of the surface integrals over S1; S2; . . . .
The results stated hold when S is projected on to a region r on the xy plane.
In some cases it is
better to project S on to the yz or xz planes.
For such cases (18) can be evaluated by appropriately
modifying (21) and (22).
THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
The divergence theorem establishes equality between triple integral (volume integral) of a function
over a region of three-dimensional space and the double integral of the function over the surface that
bounds that region.
This relation is very important in the expression of physical theory.
(See Fig.
10-5.)

EXAMPLE.
If B is the magnetic ﬁeld vector, then one of Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic theory is
r  B ¼ 0.
When this equation is substituted into the left member of (23), the right member tells us that the
magnetic ﬂux through a closed surface containing a magnetic ﬁeld is zero.
A simple interpretation of this fact
results by thinking of a magnet enclosed in a ball.
All magnetic lines of force that ﬂow out of the ball must return
(so that the total ﬂux is zero).
Thus, the lines of force ﬂow from one pole to the other, and there is no dispersion.
STOKES’ THEOREM
Stokes’ theorem establishes the equality of the double integral of a vector ﬁeld over a portion of a
surface and the line integral of the ﬁeld over a simple closed curve bounding the surface portion. (See
Fig. 10-6.)
Suppose a closed curve, C, bounds a smooth surface portion, S.

Extend the proof of Green’s theorem in the plane given in Problem
10.5 to the curves C for which lines parallel to the coordinate axes
may cut C in more than two points.
Consider a closed curve C such as shown in the adjoining Fig. 10-10,
in which lines parallel to the axes may meet C in more than two points.
By constructing line ST the region is divided into two regions r1 and r2,
which are of the type considered in Problem 10.5 and for which Green’s
theorem applies, i.e.,

A region r such as considered here and in Problem 10.5, for which any closed curve lying in r can be
continuously shrunk to a point without leaving r, is called a simply connected region. A region which is not

simply connected is called multiply connected.
We have shown here that Green’s theorem in the plane
applies to simply connected regions bounded by closed curves. In Problem 10.10 the theorem is extended to
multiply connected regions.
For more complicated simply connected regions, it may be necessary to construct more lines, such as
ST, to establish the theorem.

10.10. Show that Green’s theorem in the plane is also valid for a multiply connected region r such as
shown in Fig. 10-11.
The shaded region r, shown in the ﬁgure, is multiply
connected since not every closed curve lying in r can be
shrunk to a point without leaving r, as is observed by con-
sidering a curve surrounding DEFGD, for example.
The
boundary of r, which consists of the exterior boundary
AHJKLA and the interior boundary DEFGD, is to be tra-
versed in the positive direction, so that a person traveling in
this direction always has the region on his left. It is seen that
the positive directions are those indicated in the adjoining
ﬁgure.
In order to establish the theorem, construct a line, such
as AD, called a cross-cut, connecting the exterior and interior
boundaries.
The region bounded by ADEFGDALKJHA is
simply connected, and so Green’s theorem is valid.
Then

INDEPENDENCE OF THE PATH
10.11. Let Pðx; yÞ and Qðx; yÞ be continuous and have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives at each point
of a simply connected region r.
Prove that a necessary and suﬃcient condition that
þ
C
P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0 around every closed path C in r is that @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x identically in r.

Suppose @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x.
Then by Green’s theorem,

where r is the region bounded by C.
Necessity.
Suppose
þ
C
P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0 around every closed path C in r and that @P=@y 6¼ @Q=@x at some point of
r.
In particular, suppose @P=@y  @Q=@x > 0 at the point ðx0; y0Þ.
By hypothesis @P=@y and @Q=@x are continuous in r, so that there must be some region  containing
ðx0; y0Þ as an interior point for which @P=@y  @Q=@x > 0.
If  is the boundary of , then by Green’s
theorem
þ

P dx þ Q dy ¼
ð ð

@Q
@x  @P
@y


dx dy > 0
contradicting the hypothesis that
þ
P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0 for all closed curves in r.
Thus @Q=@x  @P=@y cannot
be positive.
Similarly, we can show that @Q=@x  @P=@y cannot be negative, and it follows that it must be identically
zero, i.e., @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x identically in r.
10.12. Let P and Q be deﬁned as in Problem 10.11.
Prove that a
necessary and suﬃcient condition that
ðB
A
P dx þ Q dy be inde-
pendent of the path in r joining points A and B is that
@P=@y ¼ @Q=@x identically in r.
Suﬃciency.
If @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x, then by Problem 10.11,
ð

P dx þ Q dy ¼ 0
(see Fig. 10-12).
From this, omitting for brevity the integrand P dx þ Q dy, we have

(a)
Necessity.
If P dx þ Q dy ¼ d ¼ @
@x dx þ @
@y dy, an exact diﬀerential, then (1) @=@x ¼ P, (2) @=@y ¼ 0.
Thus, by diﬀerentiating (1) and (2) with respect to y and x, respectively, @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x since we are
assuming continuity of the partial derivatives.
Suﬃciency.
By Problem 10.12, if @P=@y ¼ @Q=@x, then
ð
P dx þ Q dy is independent of the path joining two
points.
In particular, let the two points be ða; bÞ and ðx; yÞ and deﬁne
ðx; yÞ ¼

Since the last integral is independent of the path joining ðx; yÞ and ðx þ x; yÞ, we can choose the path
to be a straight line joining these points (see Fig. 10-13) so that dy ¼ 0.
Then by the mean value
theorem for integrals,

Taking the limit as x ! 0, we have @=@x ¼ P.
Similarly we can show that @=@y ¼ Q.
Thus it follows that
P dx þ Q dy ¼ @

@y dy ¼ d:

(a)
P ¼ 6xy2  y3; Q ¼ 6x2y  3xy2.
Then @P=@y ¼ 12xy  3y2 ¼ @Q=@x and by Problem 10.12 the line
integral is independent of the path.
(b)
Method 1:
Since the line integral is independent of the path, choose any path joining ð1; 2Þ and ð3; 4Þ,
for example that consisting of lines from ð1; 2Þ to ð3; 2Þ [along which y ¼ 2; dy ¼ 0] and then ð3; 2Þ to
ð3; 4Þ [along which x ¼ 3; dx ¼ 0].
Then the required integral equals
ð3
x¼1
ð24x  8Þ dx þ
ð4
y¼2
ð54y  9y2Þ dy ¼ 80 þ 156 ¼ 236
Method 2:
Since

@y ¼ @Q
@x ; we must have
ð1Þ
@
@x ¼ 6xy2  y3;
ð2Þ
@
@y ¼ 6x2y  3xy2:
From (1),  ¼ 3x2y2  xy3 þ f ð yÞ.
From (2),  ¼ 3x2y2  xy3 þ gðxÞ.
The only way in which
these two expressions for  are equal is if f ð yÞ ¼ gðxÞ ¼ c, a constant.
Hence  ¼ 3x2y2  xy3 þ c.
Then by Problem 10.13,
ðð3;4Þ
ð1;2Þ
ð6xy2  y3Þ dx þ ð6x2y  3xy2Þ dy ¼
ðð3;4Þ
ð1;2Þ
dð3x2y2  xy3 þ cÞ
¼ 3x2y2  xy3 þ cjð3;4Þ
ð1;2Þ ¼ 236
Note that in this evaluation the arbitrary constant c can be omitted.
See also Problem 6.16, Page 131.
We could also have noted by inspection that
ð6xy2  y3Þ dx þ ð6x2y  3xy2Þ dy ¼ ð6xy2 dx þ 6x2y dyÞ  ð y3 dx þ 3xy2 dyÞ
¼ dð3x2y2Þ  dðxy3Þ ¼ dð3x2y2  xy3Þ
from which it is clear that  ¼ 3x2y2  xy3 þ c.

P ¼ x2y cos x þ 2xy sin x  y2ex; Q ¼ x2 sin x  2yex
Then @P=@y ¼ x2 cos x þ 2x sin x  2yex ¼ @Q=@x, so that by Problem 10.11 the line integral around any
closed path, in particular x2=3 þ y2=3 ¼ a2=3 is zero.

10.21. In dealing with surface integrals we have restricted
ourselves to surfaces which are two-sided.
Give an
example of a surface which is not two-sided.
Take a strip of paper such as ABCD as shown in the
adjoining Fig. 10-17. Twist the strip so that points A and
B fall on D and C, respectively, as in the adjoining ﬁgure.
If n is the positive normal at point P of the surface, we
ﬁnd that as n moves around the surface, it reverses its
original direction when it reaches P again.
If we tried
to color only one side of the surface, we would ﬁnd the
whole thing colored.
This surface, called a Mo¨bius strip,

is an example of a one-sided surface. This is sometimes called a nonorientable surface. A two-sided surface
is orientable.
THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
10.22. Prove the divergence theorem.
(See Fig. 10-18.)
Let S be a closed surface which is such that any line parallel to the coordinate axes cuts S in at most two

respectively.
Denote the projection of the surface on the xy plane by r.

The theorem can be extended to surfaces which are such that lines parallel to the coordinate axes meet
them in more than two points.
To establish this extension, subdivide the region bounded by S into
subregions whose surfaces do satisfy this condition.
The procedure is analogous to that used in Green’s
theorem for the plane.

STOKES’ THEOREM
10.26. Prove Stokes’ theorem.
Let S be a surface which is such that its projections on the xy, yz, and xz planes are regions bounded by
simple closed curves, as indicated in Fig. 10-20.
Assume S to have representation z ¼ f ðx; yÞ or x ¼ gðy; zÞ

The theorem is also valid for surfaces S which may not satisfy the restrictions imposed above.
For
assume that S can be subdivided into surfaces S1; S2; . . . ; Sk with boundaries C1; C2; . . . ; Ck which do satisfy
the restrictions. Then Stokes’ theorem holds for each such surface. Adding these surface integrals, the total
surface integral over S is obtained.
Adding the corresponding line integrals over C1; C2; . . . ; Ck, the line
integral over C is obtained.

Method 2:
Since the integral is independent of the path, we can choose any path to evaluate it; in
particular, we can choose the path consisting of straight lines from ð1; 1; 1Þ to ð2; 1; 1Þ, then to

A=V represents the ﬂux or net outﬂow per unit volume of the vector A from
the surface S.
If div A is positive in the neighborhood of a point P, it means that the outﬂow from P is
positive and we call P a source. Similarly, if div A is negative in the neighborhood of P, the outﬂow is really
an inﬂow and P is called a sink.
If in a region there are no sources or sinks, then div A ¼ 0 and we call A a
solenoidal vector ﬁeld.

Inﬁnite Series
The early developers of the calculus, including Newton and Leibniz, were well aware of the
importance of inﬁnite series.
The values of many functions such as sine and cosine were geometrically
obtainable only in special cases.
Inﬁnite series provided a way of developing extensive tables of values
for them.
This chapter begins with a statement of what is meant by inﬁnite series, then the question of when
these sums can be assigned values is addressed. Much information can be obtained by exploring inﬁnite
sums of constant terms; however, the eventual objective in analysis is to introduce series that depend on
variables.
This presents the possibility of representing functions by series.
Afterward, the question of
how continuity, diﬀerentiability, and integrability play a role can be examined.
The question of dividing a line segment into inﬁnitesimal parts has stimulated the imaginations of
philosophers for a very long time.
In a corruption of a paradox introduce by Zeno of Elea (in the ﬁfth
century B.C.) a dimensionless frog sits on the end of a one-dimensional log of unit length.
The frog
jumps halfway, and then halfway and halfway ad inﬁnitum.
The question is whether the frog ever
reaches the other end.
Mathematically, an unending sum,
1
2 þ 1
4 þ    þ 1
2n þ   
is suggested. ‘‘Common sense’’ tells us that the sum must approach one even though that value is never
attained.
We can form sequences of partial sums
S1 ¼ 1
2 ; S2 ¼ 1
2 þ 1
4 ; . . . ; Sn ¼ 1
2 þ 1
4 þ    þ 1
2n þ   
and then examine the limit.
This returns us to Chapter 2 and the modern manner of thinking about the
inﬁnitesimal.
In this chapter consideration of such sums launches us on the road to the theory of inﬁnite series.
DEFINITIONS OF INFINITE SERIES AND THEIR CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE
Deﬁnition:
The sum
S ¼

un ¼ u1 þ u2 þ    þ un þ   
ð1Þ

is an inﬁnite series.
Its value, if one exists, is the limit of the sequence of partial sums fSng
S ¼ lim
n!1 Sn
ð2Þ
If there is a unique value, the series is said to converge to that sum, S.
If there is not a unique sum
the series is said to diverge.
Sometimes the character of a series is obvious.
For example, the series
X
1
n¼1
1
2n generated by the
frog on the log surely converges, while
X
1
n¼1
n is divergent.
On the other hand, the variable series
1  x þ x2  x3 þ x4  x5 þ   
raises questions.
This series may be obtained by carrying out the division
1
1  x. If 1 < x < 1, the sums Sn yields an
approximations to
1
1  x and (2) is the exact value.
The indecision arises for x ¼ 1.
Some very great
mathematicians, including Leonard Euler, thought that S should be equal to 1
2, as is obtained by
substituting 1 into
1
1  x.
The problem with this conclusion arises with examination of
1  1 þ 1  1þ 1  1 þ    and observation that appropriate associations can produce values of 1 or
0. Imposition of the condition of uniqueness for convergence put this series in the category of divergent
and eliminated such possibility of ambiguity in other cases.
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS CONCERNING INFINITE SERIES
1.
If un converges, then lim
n!1 un ¼ 0 (see Problem 2.26, Chap. 2).
The converse, however, is not
necessarily true, i.e., if lim
n!1 un ¼ 0, un may or may not converge.
It follows that if the nth
term of a series does not approach zero the series is divergent.
2.
Multiplication of each term of a series by a constant diﬀerent from zero does not aﬀect the
convergence or divergence.
3.
Removal (or addition) of a ﬁnite number of terms from (or to) a series does not aﬀect the
convergence or divergence.

for p @ 1.
The series with p ¼ 1 is called the harmonic series.
TESTS FOR CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE OF SERIES OF CONSTANTS
More often than not, exact values of inﬁnite series cannot be obtained.
Thus, the search turns
toward information about the series.
In particular, its convergence or divergence comes in question.
The following tests aid in discovering this information.
266
INFINITE SERIES
[CHAP. 11

1.
Comparison test for series of non-negative terms.
(a)
Convergence.
Let vn A 0 for all n > N and suppose that vn converges.
Then if
0 @ un @ vn for all n > N, un also converges.
Note that n > N means from some
term onward.
Often, N ¼ 1.
EXAMPLE:
Since
1
2n þ 1 @ 1
2n and
X 1
2n converges,
X
1
2n þ 1 also converges.
(b)
Divergence.
Let vn A 0 for all n > N and suppose that vn diverges. Then if un A vn for
all n > N, un also diverges.
EXAMPLE:
Since
1
ln n > 1
n and
X

n diverges,
X

ln n also diverges.
2.
The Limit-Comparison or Quotient Test for series of non-negative terms.
(a)
If un A 0 and vn A 0 and if lim
n!1
un
vn
¼ A 6¼ 0 or 1, then un and vn either both converge
or both diverge.
(b)
If A ¼ 0 in (a) and vn converges, then un converges.
(c)
If A ¼ 1 in (a) and vn diverges, then un diverges.
This test is related to the comparison test and is often a very useful alternative to it.
In
particlar, taking vn ¼ 1=np, we have from known facts about the p series the
Theorem 1.
Let lim
n!1 np un ¼ A.
Then
(i)
un converges if p > 1 and A is ﬁnite.
(ii)
un diverges if p @ 1 and A 6¼ 0 (A may be inﬁnite).

Integral test for series of non-negative terms.
If f ðxÞ is positive, continuous, and monotonic decreasing for x A N and is such that
f ðnÞ ¼ un; n ¼ N; N þ 1; N þ 2; . . . ,
then
un
converges
or

according
as
ð1

f ðxÞ dx ¼ lim

f ðxÞ dx converges or diverges.
In particular we may have N ¼ 1, as
is often true in practice.
This theorem borrows from the next chapter since the integral has an unbounded upper
limit. (It is an improper integral. The convergence or divergence of these integrals is deﬁned in
much the same way as for inﬁnite series.)

positive and negative.
An alternating series converges if the following two conditions are satisﬁed (see Problem

(a)
junþ1j @ junj

Hence, the series converges.
Theorem 2.
The numerical error made in stopping at any particular term of a convergent alternating
series which satisﬁes conditions (a) and (b) is less than the absolute value of the next term.

5.
Absolute and conditional convergence.
The series un is called absolutely convergent if junj
converges.
If un converges but junj diverges, then un is called conditionally convergent.
Theorem 3.
If junj converges, then un converges.
In words, an absolutely convergent series is
convergent (see Problem 11.17).

Thus, 1  1

Any of the tests used for series with non-negative terms can be used to test for absolute
convergence.
Also, tests that compare successive terms are common.

this type.

Then the series un
(a)

Then the series un

THEOREMS ON ABSOLUTELY CONVERGENT SERIES
Theorem 4.
(Rearrangement of Terms) The terms of an absolutely convergent series can be rearranged
in any order, and all such rearranged series will converge to the same sum.
However, if the terms of a
conditionally convergent series are suitably rearranged, the resulting series may diverge or converge to
any desired sum (see Problem 11.80).
Theorem 5.
(Sums, Diﬀerences, and Products) The sum, diﬀerence, and product of two absolutely
convergent series is absolutely convergent.
The operations can be performed as for ﬁnite series.

Observe that until this section the sequences and series depended on one element, n.
Now there is
variation with respect to x as well.
This complexity requires the introduction of a new concept called
uniform convergence, which, in turn, is fundamental in exploring the continuity, diﬀerentiation, and
integrability of series.
Let funðxÞg; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . be a sequence of functions deﬁned in ½a; b.
The sequence is said to
converge to FðxÞ, or to have the limit FðxÞ in ½a; b, if for each  > 0 and each x in ½a; b we can ﬁnd
N > 0 such that junðxÞ  FðxÞj <  for all n > N. In such case we write lim
n!1 unðxÞ ¼ FðxÞ. The number
N may depend on x as well as . If it depends only on  and not on x, the sequence is said to converge to
FðxÞ uniformly in ½a; b or to be uniformly convergent in ½a; b.
The inﬁnite series of functions
X
1
n¼1
unðxÞ ¼ u1ðxÞ þ u2ðxÞ þ u3ðxÞ þ   
ð3Þ
is said to be convergent in ½a; b if the sequence of partial sums fSnðxÞg, n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; where
SnðxÞ ¼ u1ðxÞ þ u2ðxÞ þ    þ unðxÞ, is convergent in ½a; b.
In such case we write lim
n!1 SnðxÞ ¼ SðxÞ
and call SðxÞ the sum of the series.
It follows that unðxÞ converges to SðxÞ in ½a; b if for each  > 0 and each x in ½a; b we can ﬁnd
N > 0 such that jSnðxÞ  SðxÞj <  for all n > N. If N depends only on  and not on x, the series is called
uniformly convergent in ½a; b.
Since SðxÞ  SnðxÞ ¼ RnðxÞ, the remainder after n terms, we can equivalently say that unðxÞ is
uniformly convergent in ½a; b if for each  > 0 we can ﬁnd N depending on  but not on x such that
jRnðxÞj <  for all n > N and all x in ½a; b.
These deﬁnitions can be modiﬁed to include other intervals besides a @ x @ b, such as a < x < b,
and so on.
The domain of convergence (absolute or uniform) of a series is the set of values of x for which the
series of functions converges (absolutely or uniformly).
EXAMPLE 1.
Suppose un ¼ xn=n and  1
2 @ x @ 1. Now think of the constant function FðxÞ ¼ 0 on this interval.
For any  > 0 and any x in the interval, there is N such that for all n > Njun  FðxÞj < , i.e., jxn=nj < .
Since the
limit does not depend on x, the sequence is uniformly convergent.
CHAP. 11]
INFINITE SERIES
269

EXAMPLE 2.
If un ¼ xn and 0 @ x @ 1, the sequence is not uniformly convergent because (think of the function
FðxÞ ¼ 0, 0 @ x < 1, Fð1Þ ¼ 1Þ
jxn  0j <  when xn < ;
thus
n ln x < ln :
On the interval 0 @ x < 1, and for 0 <  < 1, both members
of
the
inequality
are
negative,
therefore,
n > ln 
ln x :
Since
ln 
ln x ¼ ln 1  ln 
ln 1  nn x ¼ lnð=Þ
lnð1=xÞ, it follows that we must choose N
such that
n > N > ln 1=
ln 1=x
From this expression we see that  ! 0 then ln 1
 ! 1 and
also as x ! 1 from the left ln 1
x ! 0 from the right; thus, in either
case, N must increase without bound.
This dependency on both
 and x demonstrations that the sequence is
not uniformly
convergent.
For a pictorial view of this example, see Fig. 11-1.

This test supplies a suﬃcient but not a necessary condition for uniform convergence, i.e., a
series may be uniformly convergent even when the test cannot be made to apply.
One may be led because of this test to believe that uniformly convergent series must be
absolutely convergent, and conversely.
However, the two properties are independent, i.e., a
series can be uniformly convergent without being absolutely convergent, and conversely.

THEOREMS ON UNIFORMLY CONVERGENT SERIES
If an inﬁnite series of functions is uniformly convergent, it has many of the properties possessed by
sums of ﬁnite series of functions, as indicated in the following theorems.
Theorem 6.
If funðxÞg; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . are continuous in ½a; b and if unðxÞ converges uniformly to the
sum SðxÞ in ½a; b, then SðxÞ is continuous in ½a; b.
Brieﬂy, this states that a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions is a continuous
function.
This result is often used to demonstrate that a given series is not uniformly convergent by
showing that the sum function SðxÞ is discontinuous at some point (see Problem 11.30).
In particular if x0 is in ½a; b, then the theorem states that
lim
x!x0

unðxÞ ¼

n¼1
lim
x!x0 unðxÞ ¼
X

n¼1
unðx0Þ
where we use right- or left-hand limits in case x0 is an endpoint of ½a; b.
Theorem 7.
If funðxÞg; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; are continuous in ½a; b and if unðxÞ converges uniformly to the
sum SðxÞ in ½a; b, then

Brieﬂy, a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions can be integrated term by term.
Theorem 8.
If funðxÞg; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; are continuous and have continuous derivatives in ½a; b and if
unðxÞ converges to SðxÞ while u 0
nðxÞ is uniformly convergent in ½a; b, then in ½a; b

where a0; a1; a2; . . . are constants, is called a power series in x.
It is often convenient to abbreviate the
series (9) as anxn.
In general a power series converges for jxj < R and diverges for jxj > R, where the constant R is
called the radius of convergence of the series.
For jxj ¼ R, the series may or may not converge.
The interval jxj < R or R < x < R, with possible inclusion of endpoints, is called the interval of
convergence of the series. Although the ratio test is often successful in obtaining this interval, it may fail
and in such cases, other tests may be used (see Problem 11.22).
The two special cases R ¼ 0 and R ¼ 1 can arise.
In the ﬁrst case the series converges only for
x ¼ 0; in the second case it converges for all x, sometimes written 1 < x < 1 (see Problem 11.25).
When we speak of a convergent power series, we shall assume, unless otherwise indicated, that R > 0.
Similar remarks hold for a power series of the form (9), where x is replaced by ðx  aÞ.
THEOREMS ON POWER SERIES
Theorem 9.
A power series converges uniformly and absolutely in any interval which lies entirely within
its interval of convergence.
Theorem 10.
A power series can be diﬀerentiated or integrated term by term over any interval lying
entirely within the interval of convergence.
Also, the sum of a convergent power series is continuous in
any interval lying entirely within its interval of convergence.
This follows at once from Theorem 9 and the theorems on uniformly convergent series on Pages 270
and 271.
The results can be extended to include end points of the interval of convergence by the
following theorems.
Theorem 11.
Abel’s theorem. When a power series converges up to and including an endpoint of its
interval of convergence, the interval of uniform convergence also extends so far as to include this
endpoint.
See Problem 11.42.
Theorem 12.
Abel’s limit theorem. If
X

anxn converges at x ¼ x0, which may be an interior point or an
endpoint of the interval of convergence, then

If x0 is an end point, we must use x ! x0þ or x ! x0 in (10) according as x0 is a left- or right-hand
end point.
This follows at once from Theorem 11 and Theorem 6 on the continuity of sums of uniformly
convergent series.
OPERATIONS WITH POWER SERIES
In the following theorems we assume that all power series are convergent in some interval.
Theorem 13.
Two power series can be added or subtracted term by term for each value of x common to
their intervals of convergence.

Theorem 14.
Two power series, for example,
X

bnxn, can be multiplied to obtain

cnxn
where
cn ¼ a0bn þ a1bn1 þ a2bn2 þ    þ anb0
ð11Þ
the result being valid for each x within the common interval of convergence.
Theorem 15.
If the power series
X
1
n¼0
anxn is divided by the power series bnxn where b0 6¼ 0, the quotient
can be written as a power series which converges for suﬃciently small values of x.
Theorem 16.
If y ¼
X

n¼0
anxn, then by substituting x ¼
X

n¼0
bnyn, we can obtain the coeﬃcients bn in
terms of an.
This process is often called reversion of series.
EXPANSION OF FUNCTIONS IN POWER SERIES
This section gets at the heart of the use of inﬁnite series in analysis.
Functions are represented
through them.
Certain forms bear the names of mathematicians of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
century who did so much to develop these ideas.
A simple way (and one often used to gain information in mathematics) to explore series representa-
tion of functions is to assume such a representation exists and then discover the details.
Of course,
whatever is found must be conﬁrmed in a rigorous manner.
Therefore, assume
f ðxÞ ¼ A0 þ A1ðx  cÞ þ A2ðx  cÞ2 þ    þ Anðx  cÞn þ   
Notice that the coeﬃcients An can be identiﬁed with derivatives of f .
In particular
A0 ¼ f ðcÞ; A1 ¼ f 0ðcÞ; A2 ¼ 1
2! f 00ðcÞ; . . . ; An ¼ 1
n! f ðnÞðcÞ; . . .
This suggests that a series representation of f is
f ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ f 0ðcÞðx  cÞ þ 1
2! f 00ðcÞðx  cÞ2 þ    þ 1
n! f ðnÞðcÞðx  cÞn þ   
A ﬁrst step in formalizing series representation of a function, f , for which the ﬁrst n derivatives exist,
is accomplished by introducing Taylor polynomials of the function.
P0ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ
P1ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ f 0ðcÞðx  cÞ;
P2ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ f 0ðcÞðx  cÞ þ 1
2! f 00ðcÞðx  cÞ2;
PnðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ f 0ðcÞðx  cÞ þ    þ 1
n! f ðnÞðcÞðx  cÞn
ð12Þ
TAYLOR’S THEOREM
Let f and its derivatives f 0; f 00; . . . ; f ðnÞ exist and be continuous in a closed interval a  x  b and
suppose that f ðnþ1Þ exists in the open interval a < x < b.
Then for c in ½a; b,
f ðxÞ ¼ PnðxÞ þ RnðxÞ;
where the remainder RnðxÞ may be represented in any of the three following ways.
For each n there exists  such that

RnðxÞ ¼

ðn þ 1Þ! f ðnþ1ÞðÞðx  cÞnþ1
(Lagrange form)
ð13Þ
( is between c and x.)
(The theorem with this remainder is a mean value theorem.
Also, it is called Taylor’s formula.)
For each n there exists  such that
RnðxÞ ¼ 1
n! f ðnþ1ÞðÞðx  Þnðx  cÞ
(Cauchy form)

RnðxÞ ¼ 1

ð15Þ
If all the derivatives of f exist, then
f ðxÞ ¼
X
1
n¼0
1
n! f ðnÞðcÞðx  cÞn
ð16Þ
This inﬁnite series is called a Taylor series, although when c ¼ 0, it can also be referred to as a
MacLaurin series or expansion.
One might be tempted to believe that if all derivatives of f ðxÞ exist at x ¼ c, the expansion (16) would
be valid.
This, however, is not necessarily the case, for although one can then formally obtain the series
on the right of (16), the resulting series may not converge to f ðxÞ.
For an example of this see Problem
11.108.
Precise conditions under which the series converges to f ðxÞ are best obtained by means of the theory
of functions of a complex variable. See Chapter 16.
The determination of values of functions at desired arguments is conveniently approached through
Taylor polynomials.
EXAMPLE.
The value of sin x may be determined geometrically for 0; 
6, and an inﬁnite number of other
arguments.
To obtain values for other real number arguments, a Taylor series may be expanded about any of
these points.
For example, let c ¼ 0 and evaluate several derivatives there, i.e., f ð0Þ ¼ sin 0 ¼ 0; f 0ð0Þ ¼ cos 0 ¼ 1,
f 00ð0Þ ¼  sin 0 ¼ 0; f 000ð0Þ ¼  cos 0 ¼ 1; f 1vð0Þ ¼ sin 0 ¼ 0; f vð0Þ ¼ cos 0 ¼ 1.
Thus, the MacLaurin expansion to ﬁve terms is
sin x ¼ 0 þ x  0  1
3! x3 þ 0  1
51 x5 þ   
Since the fourth term is 0 the Taylor polynomials P3 and P4 are equal, i.e.,
P3ðxÞ ¼ P4ðxÞ ¼ x  x3
3!
and the Lagrange remainder is
R4ðxÞ ¼ 1
5! cos  x5
Suppose an approximation of the value of sin :3 is required.
Then
P4ð:3Þ ¼ :3  1
6 ð:3Þ3  :2945:
The accuracy of this approximation can be determined from examination of the remainder. In
particular, (remember j cos j  1)
jR4j ¼ 1
5! cos ð:3Þ5

Thus, the approximation P4ð:3Þ for sin :3 is correct to four decimal
places.
Additional insight to the process of approximation of functional
values results by constructing a graph of P4ðxÞ and comparing it to
y ¼ sin x.
(See Fig. 11-2.)

The graph is a local approximation of the sin
curve.
The reader can show that P6ðxÞ produces an even better approximation.
(For an example of series approximation of an integral see the example below.)

If p is a positive integer or zero, the series terminates.
(b)
If p > 0 but is not an integer, the series converges (absolutely) for 1 @ x @ 1:
ðcÞ
If 1 < p < 0, the series converges for 1 < x @ 1:
(d)
If p @  1, the series converges for 1 < x < 1.
For all p the series certainly converges if 1 < x < 1.

Bessel function of order p.
See Problems 11.46, 11.110 through 11.113.
Similarly, the hypergeometric function
Fða; b; c; xÞ ¼ 1 þ a  B

ð17Þ
is a solution of Gauss’ diﬀerential equation xð1  xÞy 00 þ fc  ða þ b þ 1Þxgy 0  aby ¼ 0.
These functions have many important properties.
2.
Inﬁnite series of complex terms, in particular power series of the form
X
1
n¼0
anzn, where z ¼ x þ iy
and an may be complex, can be handled in a manner similar to real series.
Such power series converge for jzj < R, i.e., interior to a circle of convergence x2 þ y2 ¼ R2,
where R is the radius of convergence (if the series converges only for z ¼ 0, we say that the radius
of convergence R is zero; if it converges for all z, we say that the radius of convergence is
inﬁnite).
On the boundary of this circle, i.e., jzj ¼ R, the series may or may not converge,
depending on the particular z.
Note that for y ¼ 0 the circle of convergence reduces to the interval of convergence for real
power series.
Greater insight into the behavior of power series is obtained by use of the theory
of functions of a complex variable (see Chapter 16).
3.
Inﬁnite series of functions of two (or more) variables, such as
X
1
n¼1
unðx; yÞ can be treated in a
manner analogous to series in one variable. In particular, we can discuss power series in x and y
having the form
a00 þ ða10x þ a01yÞ þ ða20x2 þ a11xy þ a02y2Þ þ   
ð18Þ
using double subscripts for the constants. As for one variable, we can expand suitable functions
of x and y in such power series.
In particular, the Taylor theroem may be extended as follows.
TAYLOR’S THEOREM (FOR TWO VARIABLES)
Let f be a function of two variables x and y. If all partial derivatives of order n are continuous in a
closed region and if all the ðn þ 1Þ partial derivatives exist in the open region, then

Multivariable Taylor series have a similar pattern.

ð1 þ ukÞ, where
we suppose that uk 6¼ 1; k ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . . If there exists a number P 6¼ 0 such that lim

ð1 þ ukÞ, or brieﬂy
ð1 þ ukÞ, converges to P; otherwise, it diverges.
If ð1 þ jukjÞ converges, we call the inﬁnite product ð1 þ ukÞ absolutely convergent. It can
be shown that an absolutely convergent inﬁnite product converges and that factors can in such
cases be rearranged without aﬀecting the result.
Theorems about inﬁnite products can (by taking logarithms) often be made to depend on
theorems for inﬁnite series.
Thus, for example, we have the following theorem.
Theorem.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition that ð1 þ ukÞ converge absolutely is that uk converge

Summability.
Let S1; S2; S3; . . . be the partial sums of a divergent series un.
If the sequence
S1; S1; S2
2
; S1 þ S2 þ S3
3
; . . . (formed by taking arithmetic means of the ﬁrst n terms of
S1; S2; S3; . . .) converges to S, we say that the series un is summable in the Ce´saro sense, or
C-1 summable to S (see Problem 11.51).
If un converges to S, the Ce´ saro method also yields the result S.
For this reason the
Ce´ saro method is said to be a regular method of summability.
In case the Ce´ saro limit does not exist, we can apply the same technique to the sequence
S1; S1 þ S2
3
; S1 þ S2 þ S3
3
; . . . :
If the C-1 limit for this sequence exists and equals S, we say
that uk converges to S in the C-2 sense.
The process can be continued indeﬁnitely.

Geometrically, u2 þ u3 þ    þ uM is the total area

ALTERNATING SERIES
11.15. Given the alternating series a1  a2 þ a3  a4 þ    where 0 @ anþ1 @ an and where lim
n!1 an ¼ 0.
Prove that
(a) the series converges,
(b) the error made in stopping at any term is not greater
than the absolute value of the next term.
(a)
The sum of the series to 2M terms is
S2M ¼ ða1  a2Þ þ ða3  a4Þ þ    þ ða2M1  a2MÞ
¼ a1  ða2  a3Þ  ða4  a5Þ      ða2M2  a2M1Þ  a2M
Since the quantities in parentheses are non-negative, we have
S2M A 0;
S2 @ S4 @ S6 @ S8 @    @ S2M @ a1
Therefore, fS2Mg is a bounded monotonic increasing sequence and thus has limit S.
Also, S2Mþ1 ¼ S2M þ a2Mþ1.
Since
lim
M!1 S2M ¼ S and
lim
M!1 a2Mþ1 ¼ 0 (for, by hypothesis,
lim
n!1 an ¼ 0), it follows that lim
M!1 S2Mþ1 ¼ lim
M!1 S2M þ lim
M!1 a2Mþ1 ¼ S þ 0 ¼ S.
Thus, the partial sums of the series approach the limit S and the series converges.
(b)
The error made in stopping after 2M terms is
ða2Mþ1  a2Mþ2Þ þ ða2Mþ3  a2Mþ4Þ þ    ¼ a2Mþ1  ða2Mþ2  a2Mþ3Þ    
and is thus non-negative and less than or equal to a2Mþ1, the ﬁrst term which is omitted.
Similarly, the error made in stopping after 2M þ 1 terms is
a2Mþ2 þ ða2Mþ3  a2Mþ4Þ þ    ¼ ða2Mþ2  a2Mþ3Þ  ða2Mþ4  a2Mþ5Þ    
which is non-positive and greater than a2Mþ2.
11.16. (a) Prove that the series
X

n¼1
ð1Þnþ1
2n  1 converges.
(b) Find the maximum error made in approx-
imating the sum by the ﬁrst 8 terms and the ﬁrst 9 terms of the series. (c) How many terms of the
series are needed in order to obtain an error which does not exceed .001 in absolute value?
(a)
The series is 1  1
3 þ 1
5  1
7 þ 1
9     .
If un ¼ ð1Þnþ1
2n  1 , then an ¼ junj ¼

Since

2n  1
and since
lim
n!1

2n  1 ¼ 0,
it follows by Problem 11.5(a) that the series
converges.
(b)
Use the results of Problem 11.15(b). Then the ﬁrst 8 terms give 1  1
3 þ 1
5  1
7 þ 1
9  1
11 þ 1
13  1
15 and the
error is positive and does not exceed 1
17.
Similarly, the ﬁrst 9 terms are 1  1
3 þ 1
5  1
7 þ 1
9  1
11 þ 1
13  1
15 þ 1
17 and the error is negative and
greater than or equal to  1
19, i.e., the error does not exceed 1
19 in absolute value.
282
INFINITE SERIES
[CHAP. 11

(c)
The absolute value of the error made in stopping after M terms is less than 1=ð2M þ 1Þ. To obtain the
desired accuracy, we must have 1=ð2M þ 1Þ @ :001, from which M A 499:5. Thus, at least 500 terms
are needed.
ABSOLUTE AND CONDITIONAL CONVERGENCE
11.17. Prove that an absolutely convergent series is convergent.
Given that junj converges, we must show that un converges.
Let SM ¼ u1 þ u2 þ    þ uM and TM ¼ ju1j þ ju2j þ    þ juMj.
Then
SM þ TM ¼ ðu1 þ ju1jÞ þ ðu2 þ ju2jÞ þ    þ ðuM þ juMjÞ
@ 2ju1j þ 2ju2j þ    þ 2juMj
Since junj converges and since un þ junj A 0, for n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; it follows that SM þ TM is a bounded
monotonic increasing sequence, and so lim
M!1ðSM þ TMÞ exists.
Also, since lim
M!1 TM exists (since the series is absolutely convergent by hypothesis),
lim
M!1 SM ¼ lim
M!1ðSM þ TM  TMÞ ¼ lim
M!1ðSM þ TMÞ  lim
M!1 TM
must also exist and the result is proved.

13=2 þ 1
23=2 þ 1
33=2 þ    , which converges, it follows that the given series is absolutely convergent and
hence convergent by Problem 11.17.

:
(a)
The series of absolute values is
X

n¼1
n
n2 þ 1 which is divergent by Problem 11.13(b).
Hence, the given
series is not absolutely convergent.
However, if an ¼ junj ¼
n
n2 þ 1 and anþ1 ¼ junþ1j ¼
n þ 1
ðn þ 1Þ2 þ 1
, then anþ1 @ an for all n A 1, and
also lim
n!1 an ¼ lim
n!1
n
n2 þ 1 ¼ 0.
Hence, by Problem 11.15 the series converges.
Since the series converges but is not absolutely convergent, it is conditionally convergent.
(b)
The series of absolute values is

By the integral test, this series converges or diverges according as lim

If u ¼ ln x;
ð

(c)
Since lim
n!1 un 6¼ 0 where un ¼ ð1Þn12n
n2

To show that
lim
n!1 un 6¼ 0, it suﬃces to show that lim

n2 6¼ 0. This can be accomplished by L’Hospital’s
rule or other methods [see Problem 11.21(b)].
RATIO TEST
11.20. Establish the ratio test for convergence.
Consider ﬁrst the series u1 þ u2 þ u3 þ    where each term is non-negative.
We must prove that if
lim
n!1
unþ1
un
¼ L < 1, then necessarily un converges.
By hypothesis, we can choose an integer N so large that for all n A N, ðunþ1=unÞ < r where L < r < 1.
Then
uNþ1 < r uN
uNþ2 < r uNþ1 < r2 uN
uNþ3 < r uNþ2 < r3 uN
etc.
By addition,
uNþ1 þ uNþ2 þ    < uNðr þ r2 þ r3 þ   Þ
and so the given series converges by the comparison test, since 0 < r < 1.
In case the series has terms with mixed signs, we consider ju1j þ ju2j þ ju3j þ    .
Then by the above
proof and Problem 11.17, it follows that if lim
n!1
unþ1
un








 ¼ L < 1, then un converges (absolutely).
Similarly, we can prove that if lim

(a)
By Problem 11.27, SnðxÞ ¼ 1  xn; SðxÞ ¼ lim
n!1 SnðxÞ ¼ 1 if  1
2 < x < 1
2; thus, the series converges in this
interval.
We have
Remainder after n terms ¼ RnðxÞ ¼ SðxÞ  SnðxÞ ¼ 1  ð1  xnÞ ¼ xn
The series is uniformly convergent in the interval if given any  > 0 we can ﬁnd N dependent on ,
but not on x, such that jRnðxÞj <  for all n > N. Now
jRnðxÞj ¼ jxnj ¼ jxjn < 
when
n ln jxj < ln 
or
n > ln 
ln jxj
since division by ln jxj (which is negative since jxj < 1
2) reverses the sense of the inequality.
But if jxj < 1
2 ; ln jxj < ln ð1
2Þ, and n > ln 
ln jxj > ln 
lnð1
2Þ ¼ N.
Thus, since N is independent of x, the
series is uniformly convergent in the interval.
(b)
In this case jxj @ 1
2 ; ln jxj @ ln ð1
2Þ; and n > ln 
ln jxj A ln 
lnð1
2Þ ¼ N, so that the series is also uniformly
convergent in  1
2 @ x @ 1
2 :
(c)
Reasoning similar to the above, with 1
2 replaced by .99, shows that the series is uniformly convergent in
:99 @ x @ :99.
(d)
The arguments used above break down in this case, since ln 
ln jxj can be made larger than any positive
number by choosing jxj suﬃciently close to 1.
Thus, no N exists and it follows that the series is not
uniformly convergent in 1 < x < 1.
(e)
Since the series does not even converge at all points in this interval, it cannot converge uniformly in the
interval.
11.29. Discuss the continuity of the sum function SðxÞ ¼ lim
n!1 SnðxÞ of Problem 11.27 for the interval
0 @ x @ 1.
If 0 @ x < 1; SðxÞ ¼ lim
n!1 SnðxÞ ¼ lim
n!1ð1  xnÞ ¼ 1.
If x ¼ 1; SnðxÞ ¼ 0 and SðxÞ ¼ 0.
Thus, SðxÞ ¼
1
if 0 @ x < 1
0
if x ¼ 1

and SðxÞ is discontinuous at x ¼ 1 but continuous at all other points in
0 @ x < 1.
In Problem 11.34 it is shown that if a series is uniformly convergent in an interval, the sum function SðxÞ
must be continuous in the interval.
It follows that if the sum function is not continuous in an interval, the
series cannot be uniformly convergent.
This fact is often used to demonstrate the nonuniform convergence
of a series (or sequence).

1 þ x2 þ

ð1 þ x2Þ2 þ    þ

ð1 þ x2Þn þ    .
Suppose x 6¼ 0. Then the series is a geometric series with ratio 1=ð1 þ x2Þ whose sum is (see Problem
2.25, Chap. 2).
SðxÞ ¼
x2
1  1=ð1 þ x2Þ ¼ 1 þ x2
If x ¼ 0 the sum of the ﬁrst n terms is Snð0Þ ¼ 0; hence Sð0Þ ¼ lim
n!1 Snð0Þ ¼ 0.
Since lim
x!0 SðxÞ ¼ 1 6¼ Sð0Þ, SðxÞ is discontinuous at x ¼ 0. Then by Problem 11.34, the series cannot be
uniformly convergent in any interval which includes x ¼ 0, although it is (absolutely) convergent in any
interval.
However, it is uniformly convergent in any interval which excludes x ¼ 0.
This can also be shown directly (see Problem 11.93).

WEIERSTRASS M TEST
11.31. Prove the Weierstrass M test, i.e., if junðxÞj @ Mn; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; where Mn are positive
constants such that Mn converges, then unðxÞ is uniformly (and absolutely) convergent.
The remainder of the series unðxÞ after n terms is RnðxÞ ¼ unþ1ðxÞ þ unþ2ðxÞ þ    .
Now
jRnðxÞj ¼ junþ1ðxÞ þ unþ2ðxÞ þ    j @ junþ1ðxÞj þ junþ2ðxÞj þ    @ Mnþ1 þ Mnþ2 þ   
But Mnþ1 þ Mnþ2 þ    can be made less than  by choosing n > N, since Mn converges. Since N is clearly
independent of x, we have jRnðxÞj <  for n > N, and the series is uniformly convergent.
The absolute
convergence follows at once from the comparison test.

For all x in this interval,

However, Mn, where Mn ¼ 1

Then by the M test the given series converges uniformly for all x.

(a) absolutely in the
interval jxj < jx0j,
(b) uniformly in the interval jxj @ jx1j; where jx1j < jx0j.
(a)
Since anxn
0 converges, lim
n!1 anxn
0 ¼ 0 and so we can make janxn
0j < 1 by choosing n large enough, i.e.,
janj <
1
jx0jn for n > N.

janxnj ¼

janjjxjn <

Since the last series in (1) converges for jxj < jx0j, it follows by the comparison test that the ﬁrst
series converges, i.e., the given series is absolutely convergent.
(b)
Let Mn ¼ jx1jn
jx0jn.
Then Mn converges since jx1j < jx0j.
As in part (a), janxnj < Mn for jxj @ jx1j, so
that by the Weierstrass M test, anxn is uniformly convergent.
It follows that a power series is uniformly convergent in any interval within its interval of con-
vergence.

Now SðxÞ ¼ SnðxÞ þ RnðxÞ, so that Sðx þ hÞ ¼ Snðx þ hÞ þ Rnðx þ hÞ and thus
Sðx þ hÞ  SðxÞ ¼ Snðx þ hÞ  SnðxÞ þ Rnðx þ hÞ  RnðxÞ
ð1Þ
where we choose h so that both x and x þ h lie in ½a; b (if x ¼ b, for example, this will require h < 0).
Since SnðxÞ is a sum of ﬁnite number of continuous functions, it must also be continuous.
Then given
 > 0, we can ﬁnd  so that
jSnðx þ hÞ  SnðxÞj < =3
whenever jhj < 
ð2Þ
Since the series, by hypothesis, is uniformly convergent, we can choose N so that
jRnðxÞj < =3
and
jRnðx þ hÞj < =3
for n > N
ð3Þ
Then from (1), (2), and (3),
jSðx þ hÞ  SðxÞj @ jSnðx þ hÞ  SnðxÞj þ jRnðx þ hÞj þ jRnðxÞj < 
for jhj < , and so the continuity is established.

so

The reason for the result in (a) is that although the sequence SnðxÞ converges to 0, it does not converge

To show this, observe that the function nxenx2 has a maximum at x ¼ 1=

Let R > 0 be the radius of convergence of anxn. Let 0 < jx0j < R. Then, as in Problem 11.33, we can
choose N as that janj <

jx0jn for n > N.
Thus, the terms of the series jnanxn1j ¼  njanjjxjn1 can for n > N be made less than corresponding
terms of the series  n jxjn1
jx0jn , which converges, by the ratio test, for jxj < jx0j < R.
Hence, nanxn1 converges absolutely for all points x0 (no matter how close jx0j is to R).
If, however, jxj > R, lim
n!1 anxn 6¼ 0 and thus lim
n!1 nanxn1 6¼ 0, so that nanxn1 does not converge.

Thus, R is the radius of convergence of nanxn1.
Note that the series of derivatives may or may not converge for values of x such that jxj ¼ R.

The two series have the same radius of convergence, i.e., R ¼ 3, although they do not have the same
interval of convergence.
Note that the result of Problem 11.39 can also be proved by the ratio test if this test is applicable.
The
proof given there, however, applies even when the test is not applicable, as in the series of Problem 11.22.
11.41. Prove that in any interval within its interval of convergence a power series
ðaÞ
represents a continuous function, say, f ðxÞ,
ðbÞ

ðcÞ

We consider the power series anxn, although analogous results hold for anðx  aÞn.
(a)
This follows from Problem 11.33 and 11.34, and the fact that each term anxn of the series is continuous.
(b)
This follows from Problems 11.33 and 11.35, and the fact that each term anxn of the series is continuous
and thus integrable.
(c)
From Problem 11.39, the series of derivatives of a power series always converges within the interval of
convergence of the original power series and therefore is uniformly convergent within this interval.
Thus, the required result follows from Problems 11.33 and 11.36.
If a power series converges at one (or both) end points of the interval of convergence, it is possible to
establish (a) and (b) to include the end point (or end points).
See Problem 11.42.
11.42. Prove Abel’s theroem that if a power series converges at an end point of its interval of conver-

For simplicity in the proof, we assume the power series to be

akxk with the end point of its interval
of convergence at x ¼ 1, so that the series surely converges for 0 @ x @ 1.
Then we must show that the

Let

Since ak converges by hypothesis, it follows that given  > 0 we can choose N such that jRkj < =2 for
all k A n.
Then for n > N we have from (1),

since ð1  xÞð1 þ x þ x2 þ x3 þ   Þ ¼ 1 (if 0 @ x < 1).
Also, for x ¼ 1; jRnðxÞj ¼ jRnj <  for n > N.
Thus, jRnðxÞj <  for all n > N, where N is independent of the value of x in 0 @ x @ 1, and the
required result follows.
Extensions to other power series are easily made.

As in Problem 11.42, assume the power series to be

akxk, convergent for 0 @ x @ 1.
Then we must show that lim

This follows at once from Problem 11.42, which shows that akxk is uniformly convergent for
0 @ x @ 1, and from Problem 11.34, which shows that akxk is continuous at x ¼ 1.
Extensions to other power series are easily made.

i.e., Snþ1  Sn @ 0, so that Sn is monotonic decreasing.
Since Sn is bounded and monotonic decreasing, it has a limit.
This limit, denoted by , is equal to
0:577215 . . . and is called Euler’s constant.
It is not yet known whether  is rational or not.

Since u1 þ u2 þ    converges, it follows that Pn is a bounded monotonic increasing sequence and so has

(b) Obtain the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder in Taylor’s Formula.

since
f ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ
ðx
C
f 0ðtÞ dt ¼ f ðcÞ þ f ðxÞ  f ðcÞ
We make the induction assumption that it holds for n ¼ k and then use integration by parts with

Then
v ¼  ðx  tÞkþ1

Thus,

Having demonstrated that the result holds for k þ 1, we conclude that it holds for all positive integers.

To obtain the Lagrange form of the remainder Rn, consider the form

2! f 00ðcÞðx  cÞ2 þ    þ K
n! ðx  cÞn
This is the Taylor polynomial Pn1ðxÞ plus K
n! ðx  cÞn:
Also, it could be looked upon as Pn except that
in the last term, f ðnÞðcÞ is replaced by a number K such that for ﬁxed c and x the representation of f ðxÞ is
exact.

The function  satisﬁes the hypothesis of Rolle’s Theorem in that ðcÞ ¼ ðxÞ ¼ 0, the function is
continuous on the interval bound by c and x, and  0 exists at each point of the interval.
Therefore, there
exists  in the interval such that  0ðÞ ¼ 0. We proceed to compute  0 and set it equal to zero.

K

According to hypothesis: for each n there is n such that

Thus
K ¼ f ðnÞðnÞ
and the Lagrange remainder is

n!
ðx  cÞn
or equivalently
Rn ¼

ðn þ 1Þ! f ðnþ1Þðnþ1Þðx  cÞnþ1
The Cauchy form of the remainder follows immediately by applying the mean value theorem for
integrals.
(See Page 274.)

Improper Integrals
DEFINITION OF AN IMPROPER INTEGRAL
The functions that generate the Riemann integrals of Chapter 6 are continuous on closed intervals.
Thus, the functions are bounded and the intervals are ﬁnite.
Integrals of functions with these char-
acteristics are called proper integrals. When one or more of these restrictions is relaxed, the integrals are
said to be improper.
Categories of improper integrals are established below.
The integral
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx is called an improper integral if
1.
a ¼ 1 or b ¼ 1 or both, i.e., one or both integration limits is inﬁnite,
2.
f ðxÞ is unbounded at one or more points of a @ x @ b.
Such points are called singularities of
f ðxÞ.
Integrals corresponding to (1) and (2) are called improper integrals of the ﬁrst and second kinds,
respectively. Integrals with both conditions (1) and (2) are called improper integrals of the third kind.
EXAMPLE 1.
ð1
0
sin x2 dx is an improper integral of the ﬁrst kind.
EXAMPLE 2.
ð4

x  3 is an improper integral of the second kind.

This can be illustrated with f ðxÞ ¼ xex2.
The ﬁrst expression is not deﬁned since neither of the
improper integrals (i.e., limits) is deﬁned while the second form yields the value 0.

Perhaps at some point in your academic career you were
‘‘graded on the curve.’’ The inﬁnite region under the curve with
the limiting area of 1 corresponds to the assurance of getting a
grade.
C’s are assigned to those whose grades fall in a desig-
nated central section, and so on.
(Of course, this grading
procedure is not valid for a small number of students, but as
the number increases it takes on statistical meaning.)
In this chapter we formulate tests for convergence or diver-
gence of improper integrals. It will be found that such tests and
proofs of theorems bear close analogy to convergence and
divergence tests and corresponding theorems for inﬁnite series
(See Chapter 11).
CONVERGENCE OR DIVERGENCE OF IMPROPER INTEGRALS OF THE FIRST KIND
Let f ðxÞ be bounded and integrable in every ﬁnite interval a @ x @ b.
Then we deﬁne
ð1
a
f ðxÞ dx ¼ lim
b!1
ðb
a
f ðxÞ dx
ð1Þ
where b is a variable on the positive real numbers.
The integral on the left is called convergent or divergent according as the limit on the right does or
does not exist.

f ðxÞ dx bears close analogy to the inﬁnite series

while

of improper integrals of the ﬁrst kind.)

CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR IMPROPER INTEGRALS OF THE FIRST KIND
The following tests are given for cases where an integration limit is 1. Similar tests exist where an
integration limit is 1 (a change of variable x ¼ y then makes the integration limit 1).
Unless
otherwise speciﬁed we shall assume that f ðxÞ is continuous and thus integrable in every ﬁnite interval

IMPROPER INTEGRALS OF THE SECOND KIND

f ðxÞ dx
ð4Þ
and deﬁne it to be an improper integral of the second kind. If the limit on the right of (4) exists, we call
the integral on the left convergent; otherwise, it is divergent.
Similarly if f ðxÞ becomes unbounded only at the end point x ¼ b of the interval a @ x @ b, then we
extend the category of improper integrals of the second kind.

function is undeﬁned at x ¼ 0.
In such case the integral on the left of (5) is called convergent or
divergent according as the limit on the right exists or does not exist.
Finally, the category of improper integrals of the second kind also includes the case where f ðxÞ
becomes unbounded only at an interior point x ¼ x0 of the interval a @ x @ b, then we deﬁne
ðb

f ðxÞ dx ¼ lim

The integral on the left of (6) converges or diverges according as the limits on the right exist or do
not exist.
Extensions of these deﬁnitions can be made in case f ðxÞ becomes unbounded at two or more points
of the interval a @ x @ b.
CAUCHY PRINCIPAL VALUE
It may happen that the limits on the right of (6) do not exist when 1 and 2 approach zero
independently.
In such case it is possible that by choosing 1 ¼ 2 ¼  in (6), i.e., writing
ðb

a
f ðxÞ dx þ

the limit does exist.
If the limit on the right of (7) does exist, we call this limiting value the Cauchy
principal value of the integral on the left.
See Problem 12.14.
EXAMPLE.
The natural logarithm (i.e., base e) may be deﬁned as follows:
ln x ¼
ðx

0 < x < 1
Since f ðxÞ ¼ 1
x is unbounded as x ! 0, this is an improper integral of the second kind (see Fig. 12-2).

IMPROPER INTEGRALS OF THE THIRD KIND
Improper integrals of the third kind can be expressed in terms of improper integrals of the ﬁrst and
second kinds, and hence the question of their convergence or divergence is answered by using results
already established.
IMPROPER INTEGRALS CONTAINING A PARAMETER, UNIFORM CONVERGENCE
Let
ð	Þ ¼

f ðx; 	Þ dx
ð8Þ
This integral is analogous to an inﬁnite series of functions.
In seeking conditions under which we
may diﬀerentiate or integrate ð	Þ with respect to 	, it is convenient to introduce the concept of uniform
convergence for integrals by analogy with inﬁnite series.
We shall suppose that the integral (8) converges for 	1 @ 	 @ 	2, or brieﬂy ½	1; 	2.
Deﬁnition.
The integral (8) is said to be uniformly convergent in ½	1; 	2 if for each  > 0, we can ﬁnd a number N
depending on  but not on 	, such that
ð	Þ 
ðu

This can be restated by nothing that ð	Þ 
ðu

f ðx; 	Þ dx








, which is analogous in
an inﬁnite series to the absolute value of the remainder after N terms.
The above deﬁnition and the properties of uniform convergence to be developed are formulated in
terms of improper integrals of the ﬁrst kind.
However, analogous results can be given for improper
integrals of the second and third kinds.

If f ðx; 	Þ is continuous for x A a and 	1 @ 	 @ 	2, and if

EVALUATION OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS
Evaluation of deﬁnite integrals which are improper can be achieved by a variety of techniques. One
useful device consists of introducing an appropriately placed parameter in the integral and then diﬀer-
entiating or integrating with respect to the parameter, employing the above properties of uniform
convergence.
LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
Operators that transform one set of objects into another are common in mathematics.
The
derivative and the indeﬁnite integral both are examples.
Logarithms provide an immediate arithmetic
advantage by replacing multiplication, division, and powers, respectively, by the relatively simpler
processes of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
After obtaining a result with logarithms an
anti-logarithm procedure is necessary to ﬁnd its image in the original framework.
The Laplace trans-
form has a role similar to that of logarithms but in the more sophisticated world of diﬀerential
equations.
(See Problems 12.34 and 12.36.)

IMPROPER INTEGRALS
[CHAP. 12

The Laplace transform of a function FðxÞ is
deﬁned as
f ðsÞ ¼ lfFðxÞg ¼
ð1
0
esxFðxÞ dx
ð12Þ
and is analogous to power series as seen by replacing
es by t so that esx ¼ tx.
Many properties of power
series also apply to Laplace transforms.
The adjacent
short table of Laplace transforms is useful.
In each
case a is a real constant.
LINEARITY
The Laplace transform is a linear operator, i.e.,
fFðxÞ þ GðxÞg ¼ fFðxÞg þ fGðxÞg:
This property is essential for returning to the solution after having calculated in the setting of the
transforms.
(See the following example and the previously cited problems.)
CONVERGENCE
The exponential est contributes to the convergence of the improper integral.
What is required is
that FðxÞ does not approach inﬁnity too rapidly as x ! 1.
This is formally stated as follows:
If there is some constant a such that jFðxÞj  eax for all suﬃciently large values of x, then
f ðsÞ ¼
ð1
0
esxFðxÞ dx converges when s > a and f has derivatives of all orders.
(The diﬀerentiations
of f can occur under the integral sign >.)
APPLICATION
The feature of the Laplace transform that (when combined with linearity) establishes it as a tool for

Conditions must be satisﬁed that guarantee the convergence of the integrals (for example, estFðtÞ ! 0

This result of integration by parts may be put in the form
(a)
fF 0ðtÞg ¼ sfFðtÞg þ F 0ð0Þ.
Repetition of the procedure combined with a little algebra yields

The Laplace representation of derivatives of the order needed can be obtained by repeating the
process.

where y ¼ FðtÞ and Fð0Þ ¼ 1, F 0ð0Þ ¼ 0. We use

From the above we see that an improper integral of the ﬁrst kind may be transformed into an
improper integral of the second kind, and conversely (actually this can always be done).
We also see that an improper integral may be transformed into a proper integral (this can only
sometimes be done).

Method 2:
Let f ðxÞ ¼

Since lim

[CHAP. 12

Write the integral as
ð1
0
xn1ex dx þ
ð1
1
xn1ex dx
ð1Þ
(a)
If n A 1, the ﬁrst integral in (1) converges since the integrand is continuous in 0 @ x @ 1.
If 0 < n < 1, the ﬁrst integral in (1) is an improper integral of the second kind at x ¼ 0.
Since
lim
x!0þ x1n  xn1ex ¼ 1, the integral converges by Theorem 3(i), Page 312, with p ¼ 1  n and a ¼ 0.
Thus, the ﬁrst integral converges for n > 0.
If n > 0, the second integral in (1) is an improper integral of the ﬁrst kind.
Since
lim
x!1 x2  xn1ex ¼ 0 (by L’Hospital’s rule or otherwise), this integral converges by Theorem 1ðiÞ,
Page 309, with p ¼ 2.
Thus, the second integral also converges for n > 0, and so the given integral converges for n > 0.
(b)
If n @ 0, the ﬁrst integral of (1) diverges since lim
x!0þ x  xn1ex ¼ 1 [Theorem 3(ii), Page 312].
If n @ 0, the second integral of (1) converges since lim
x!1 x  xn1ex ¼ 0 [Theorem 1(i), Page 309].
Since the ﬁrst integral in (1) diverges while the second integral converges, their sum also diverges,
i.e., the given integral diverges if n @ 0.
Some interesting properties of the given integral, called the gamma function, are considered in
Chapter 15.
UNIFORM CONVERGENCE OF IMPROPER INTEGRALS

(b) Prove that the integral in (a) converges uniformly to 1 for 	 A 	1 > 0.

Thus, the integral converges to 1 for all 	 > 0.
(b)
Method 1, using deﬁnition:
The integral converges uniformly to 1 in 	 A 	1 > 0 if for each  > 0 we can ﬁnd N, depending on
 but not on 	, such that 1 
ðu

lows.
Method 2, using the Weierstrass M test:
Since lim
x!1 x2  	e	x ¼ 0 for 	 A 	1 > 0, we can choose j	e	xj < 1
x2 for suﬃciently large x, say
x A x0.
Taking MðxÞ ¼ 1
x2 and noting that
ð1
x0
dx
x2 converges, it follows that the given integral is
uniformly convergent to 1 for 	 A 	1 > 0.
(c)
As 	1 ! 0, the number N in the ﬁrst method of (b) increases without limit, so that the integral cannot
be uniformly convergent for 	 > 0.
12.20. If ð	Þ ¼

f ðx; 	Þ dx is uniformly convergent for 	1 @ 	 @ 	2, prove that ð	Þ is continuous in

Let
ð	Þ ¼
ðu
a
f ðx; 	Þ dx þ Rðu; 	Þ; where Rðu; 	Þ ¼
ð1
u
f ðx; 	Þ dx:
Then
ð	 þ hÞ ¼
ðu

f ðx; 	 þ hÞ dx þ Rðu; 	 þ hÞ and so
ð	 þ hÞ  ð	Þ ¼
ðu

f f ðx; 	 þ hÞ  f ðx; 	Þg dx þ Rðu; 	 þ hÞ  Rðu; 	Þ
Thus

ðu
a
j f ðx; 	 þ hÞ  f ðx; 	Þjdx þ jRðu; 	 þ hÞj þ jRðu; 	Þj
ð1Þ
Since the integral is uniformly convergent in 	1 @ 	 @ 	2, we can, for each  > 0, ﬁnd N independent
of 	 such that for u > N,
jRðu; 	 þ hÞj < =3;
jRðu; 	Þj < =3
ð2Þ
Since f ðx; 	Þ is continuous, we can ﬁnd  > 0 corresponding to each  > 0 such that
ðu
a
j f ðx; 	 þ hÞ  f ðx; 	Þj dx < =3
for jhj < 
ð3Þ
Using (2) and (3) in (1), we see that jð	 þ hÞ  ð	Þj <  for jhj < , so that ð	Þ is continuous.
Note that in this proof we assume that 	 and 	 þ h are both in the interval 	1 @ 	 @ 	2.
Thus, if
	 ¼ 	1, for example, h > 0 and right-hand continuity is assumed.
Also note the analogy of this proof with that for inﬁnite series.
Other properties of uniformly convergent integrals can be proved similarly.

Thus the required result follows.
(b)
Since ð	Þ ¼

	eax dx is not uniformly convergent for 	 A 0 (see Problem 12.19), there is no
guarantee that ð	Þ will be continuous for 	 A 0.
Thus lim

(b) Prove that the integral in (a) converges uniformly and absolutely for a @ 	 @ b, where

12.36. Solve the diﬀerential equation Y 00ðxÞ þ YðxÞ ¼ x; Yð0Þ ¼ 0; Y 0ð0Þ ¼ 2.
Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the given diﬀerential equation.
Then by Problem 12.35,
lfY 00ðxÞ þ YðxÞg ¼ lfxg;
lfY 00ðxÞg þ lfYðxÞg ¼ 1=s2
s2lfYðxÞg  sYð0Þ  Y 0ð0Þ þ lfYðxÞg ¼ 1=s2
and so
Solving for lfYðxÞg using the given conditions, we ﬁnd
lfYðxÞg ¼
2s2
s2ðs2 þ 1Þ ¼ 1
s2 þ

by methods of partial fractions.
Since 1
s2 ¼ lfxg and
1
s2 þ 1 ¼ lfsin xg;
it follows that

1
s2 þ 1 ¼ lfx þ sin xg:
Hence, from (1), lfYðxÞg ¼ lfx þ sin xg, from which we can conclude that YðxÞ ¼ x þ sin x which is,
in fact, found to be a solution.
Another method:
If lfFðxÞg ¼ f ðsÞ, we call f ðsÞ the inverse Laplace transform of FðxÞ and write f ðsÞ ¼ l1fFðxÞg.
By Problem 12.78, l1f f ðsÞ þ gðsÞg ¼ l1f f ðsÞg þ l1fgðsÞg.

Fourier Series
Mathematicians of the eighteenth century, including Daniel Bernoulli and Leonard Euler, expressed
the problem of the vibratory motion of a stretched string through partial diﬀerential equations that had
no solutions in terms of ‘‘elementary functions.’’
Their resolution of this diﬃculty was to introduce
inﬁnite series of sine and cosine functions that satisﬁed the equations.
In the early nineteenth century,
Joseph Fourier, while studying the problem of heat ﬂow, developed a cohesive theory of such series.
Consequently, they were named after him.
Fourier series and Fourier integrals are investigated in this
and the next chapter.
As you explore the ideas, notice the similarities and diﬀerences with the chapters
on inﬁnite series and improper integrals.
PERIODIC FUNCTIONS
A function f ðxÞ is said to have a period T or to be periodic with period T if for all x, f ðx þ TÞ ¼ f ðxÞ,
where T is a positive constant.
The least value of T > 0 is called the least period or simply the period of
f ðxÞ.
EXAMPLE 1.
The function sin x has periods 2; 4; 6; . . . ; since sin ðx þ 2Þ; sin ðx þ 4Þ; sin ðx þ 6Þ; . . . all
equal sin x.
However, 2 is the least period or the period of sin x.
EXAMPLE 2.
The period of sin nx or cos nx, where n is a positive integer, is 2=n.
EXAMPLE 3.
The period of tan x is .
EXAMPLE 4.
A constant has any positive number as period.
Other examples of periodic functions are shown in the graphs of Figures 13-1(a), (b), and (c) below.

FOURIER SERIES
Let f ðxÞ be deﬁned in the interval ðL; LÞ and outside of this interval by f ðx þ 2LÞ ¼ f ðxÞ, i.e., f ðxÞ
is 2L-periodic. It is through this avenue that a new function on an inﬁnite set of real numbers is created
from the image on ðL; LÞ.

ORTHOGONALITY CONDITIONS FOR THE SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS
Notice that the Fourier coeﬃcients are integrals. These are obtained by starting with the series, (1),
and employing the following properties called orthogonality conditions:
(a)
ðL
L
cos mx
L
cos nx
L
dx ¼ 0 if m 6¼ n and L if m ¼ n
(b)
ðL
L
sin mx
L

L
dx ¼ 0 if m 6¼ n and L if m ¼ n
(3)
(c)
ðL
L
sin mx
L
cos nx
L
dx ¼ 0. Where m and n can assume any positive integer values.
An explanation for calling these orthogonality conditions is given on Page 342. Their application in
determining the Fourier coeﬃcients is illustrated in the following pair of examples and then demon-
strated in detail in Problem 13.4.
EXAMPLE 1.
To determine the Fourier coeﬃcient a0, integrate both sides of the Fourier series (1), i.e.,

f ðxÞ and f 0ðxÞ are piecewise continuous in ðL; LÞ.
Then the series (1) with Fourier coeﬃcients converges to

lim
!0þ f ðx  Þ, respectively. For a proof see Problems 13.18 through 13.23.
The conditions (1), (2), and (3) imposed on f ðxÞ are suﬃcient but not necessary, and are generally
satisﬁed in practice.
There are at present no known necessary and suﬃcient conditions for convergence
of Fourier series.
It is of interest that continuity of f ðxÞ does not alone ensure convergence of a Fourier
series.
ODD AND EVEN FUNCTIONS
A function f ðxÞ is called odd if f ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ.
Thus, x3; x5  3x3 þ 2x; sin x; tan 3x are odd
functions.
A function f ðxÞ is called even if f ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ.
Thus, x4; 2x6  4x2 þ 5; cos x; ex þ ex are even
functions.
The functions portrayed graphically in Figures 13-1(a) and 13-1ðbÞ are odd and even respectively,
but that of Fig. 13-1(c) is neither odd nor even.
In the Fourier series corresponding to an odd function, only sine terms can be present.
In the
Fourier series corresponding to an even function, only cosine terms (and possibly a constant which we
shall consider a cosine term) can be present.
HALF RANGE FOURIER SINE OR COSINE SERIES
A half range Fourier sine or cosine series is a series in which only sine terms or only cosine terms are
present, respectively. When a half range series corresponding to a given function is desired, the function
is generally deﬁned in the interval ð0; LÞ [which is half of the interval ðL; LÞ, thus accounting for the
name half range] and then the function is speciﬁed as odd or even, so that it is clearly deﬁned in the other
half of the interval, namely, ðL; 0Þ.
In such case, we have

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF FOURIER SERIES
Diﬀerentiation and integration of Fourier series can be justiﬁed by using the theorems on Pages 271
and 272, which hold for series in general. It must be emphasized, however, that those theorems provide
suﬃcient conditions and are not necessary.
The following theorem for integration is especially useful.
Theorem.
The Fourier series corresponding to f ðxÞ may be integrated term by term from a to x, and the
resulting series will converge uniformly to
ðx
a
f ðxÞ dx provided that f ðxÞ is piecewise continuous in
L @ x @ L and both a and x are in this interval.

that f ðxÞ is continuous at x.
If f ðxÞ is discontinuous at x, the left side of (7) should be replaced by
ðf ðx þ 0Þ þ f ðx  0Þ

BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS
Boundary-value problems seek to determine solutions of partial diﬀerential equations satisfying
certain prescribed conditions called boundary conditions.
Some of these problems can be solved by
use of Fourier series (see Problem 13.24).
EXAMPLE.
The classical problem of a vibrating string may be idealized in the following way.
See Fig. 13-2.
Suppose a string is tautly stretched between points ð0; 0Þ and ðL; 0Þ.
Suppose the tension, F, is the
same at every point of the string.
The string is made to
vibrate in the xy plane by pulling it to the parabolic
position gðxÞ ¼ mðLx  x2Þ and releasing it.
(m is a
numerically small positive constant.)
Its equation will
be of the form y ¼ f ðx; tÞ.
The problem of establishing
this equation is idealized by (a) assuming that the con-
stant tension, F, is so large as compared to the weight wL
of the string that the gravitational force can be neglected,
(b) the displacement at any point of the string is so small
that the length of the string may be taken as L for any of
its positions, and (c) the vibrations are purely transverse.
The
force
acting
on
a

is

This homogeneous second partial derivative equation is the classical equation for the vibrating
string.
Associated boundary conditions are
yð0; tÞ ¼ 0; yðL; tÞ ¼ 0; t > 0
The initial conditions are
yðx; 0Þ ¼ mðLx  x2Þ; @y
@t ðx; 0Þ ¼ 0; 0 < x < L
The method of solution is to separate variables, i.e., assume
yðx; tÞ ¼ GðxÞHðtÞ
Then upon substituting
GðxÞ H 00ðtÞ ¼ 	2G 00ðxÞ HðtÞ
Separating variables yields
G 00
G ¼ k; H 00
H ¼ 	2k; where k is an arbitrary constant

ORTHOGONAL FUNCTIONS
Two vectors A and B are called orthogonal (perpendicular) if A  B ¼ 0 or A1B1 þ A2B2 þ A3B3 ¼ 0,
where A ¼ A1i þ A2j þ A3k and B ¼ B1i þ B2j þ B3k.
Although not geometrically or physically evi-
dent, these ideas can be generalized to include vectors with more than three components.
In particular,
we can think of a function, say, AðxÞ, as being a vector with an inﬁnity of components (i.e., an inﬁnite
dimensional vector), the value of each component being speciﬁed by substituting a particular value of x in
some interval ða; bÞ.
It is natural in such case to deﬁne two functions, AðxÞ and BðxÞ, as orthogonal in
ða; bÞ if
ðb
a
AðxÞ BðxÞ dx ¼ 0
ð9Þ
A vector A is called a unit vector or normalized vector if its magnitude is unity, i.e., if A  A ¼ A2 ¼ 1.
Extending the concept, we say that the function AðxÞ is normal or normalized in ða; bÞ if
ðb
a
fAðxÞg2 dx ¼ 1
ð10Þ
From the above it is clear that we can consider a set of functions fkðxÞg; k ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; having the
properties
ðb
a
mðxÞnðxÞ dx ¼ 0
m 6¼ n
ð11Þ
ðb
a
fmðxÞg2 dx ¼ 1
m ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . .
ð12Þ
In such case, each member of the set is orthogonal to every other member of the set and is also
normalized.
We call such a set of functions an orthonormal set.
The equations (11) and (12) can be summarized by writing
ðb
a
mðxÞnðxÞ dx ¼ mn
ð13Þ
where mn, called Kronecker’s symbol, is deﬁned as 0 if m 6¼ n and 1 if m ¼ n.
Just as any vector r in three dimensions can be expanded in a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors
i; j; k in the form r ¼ c1i þ c2j þ c3k, so we consider the possibility of expanding a function f ðxÞ in a set
of orthonormal functions, i.e.,
f ðxÞ ¼

As we have seen, Fourier series are constructed from orthogonal functions.
Generalizations of

The above results also hold when the integration limits L; L are replaced by c; c þ 2L:
Note that in all parts above, interchange of summation and integration is valid because the series is
assumed to converge uniformly to f ðxÞ in ðL; LÞ.
Even when this assumption is not warranted, the
coeﬃcients am and bm as obtained above are called Fourier coeﬃcients corresponding to f ðxÞ, and the
corresponding series with these values of am and bm is called the Fourier series corresponding to f ðxÞ.
An important problem in this case is to investigate conditions under which this series actually converges
to f ðxÞ.
Suﬃcient conditions for this convergence are the Dirichlet conditions established in Problems
13.18 through 13.23.

If the equality holds, we have Parseval’s identity (Problem 13.13).
We can think of SMðxÞ as representing an approximation to f ðxÞ, while the left-hand side of (2), divided
by 2L, represents the mean square error of the approximation.
Parseval’s identity indicates that as M ! 1
the mean square error approaches zero, while Bessels’ inequality indicates the possibility that this mean
square error does not approach zero.
The results are connected with the idea of completeness of an orthonormal set. If, for example, we were
to leave out one or more terms in a Fourier series (say cos 4x=L, for example), we could never get the mean
square error to approach zero no matter how many terms we took.
For an analogy with three-dimensional
vectors, see Problem 13.60.

BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS
13.24. Find a solution Uðx; tÞ of the boundary-value problem
@U
@t ¼ 3 @2U
@x2
t > 0; 0 < x < 2
Uð0; tÞ ¼ 0; Uð2; tÞ ¼ 0
t > 0
Uðx; 0Þ ¼ x
0 < x < 2
A method commonly employed in practice is to assume the existence of a solution of the partial
diﬀerential equation having the particular form Uðx; tÞ ¼ XðxÞ TðtÞ, where XðxÞ and TðtÞ are functions of
x and t, respectively, which we shall try to determine. For this reason the method is often called the method
of separation of variables.
Substitution in the diﬀerential equation yields
ð1Þ
@
@t ðXTÞ ¼ 3 @2
@x2 ðXTÞ
or
ð2Þ
X dT
dt ¼ 3T d2X
dx2
where we have written X and T in place of XðxÞ and TðtÞ.
Equation (2) can be written as
1
3T
dT
dt ¼ 1
X
d2X
dx2
ð3Þ
Since one side depends only on t and the other only on x, and since x and t are independent variables, it is
clear that each side must be a constant c.
In Problem 13.47 we see that if c A 0, a solution satisfying the given boundary conditions cannot exist.
Let us thus assume that c is a negative constant which we write as 2.
Then from (3) we obtain two
ordinary diﬀerentiation equations
dT
dt þ 32T ¼ 0;
d2X
dx2 þ 2X ¼ 0
ð4Þ
whose solutions are respectively
T ¼ C1e32t;
X ¼ A1 cos x þ B1 sin x
ð5Þ
A solution is given by the product of X and T which can be written
Uðx; tÞ ¼ e32tðA cos x þ B sin xÞ
ð6Þ
where A and B are constants.
We now seek to determine A and B so that (6) satisﬁes the given boundary conditions.
To satisfy the
condition Uð0; tÞ ¼ 0, we must have
es2tðAÞ ¼ 0
or
A ¼ 0
ð7Þ
so that (6) becomes
Uðx; tÞ ¼ Bes2t sin x
ð8Þ
To satisfy the condition Uð2; tÞ ¼ 0, we must then have
Bes2t sin 2 ¼ 0
ð9Þ
356
FOURIER SERIES
[CHAP. 13

Since B ¼ 0 makes the solution (8) identically zero, we avoid this choice and instead take
sin 2 ¼ 0;
i.e.,
2 ¼ m
or
 ¼ m
2
ð10Þ
where m ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . .
Substitution in (8) now shows that a solution satisfying the ﬁrst two boundary conditions is
Uðx; tÞ ¼ Bme3m22t=4 sin mx
2
ð11Þ
where we have replaced B by Bm, indicating that diﬀerent constants can be used for diﬀerent values of m.
If we now attempt to satisfy the last boundary condition Uðx; 0Þ ¼ x; 0 < x < 2, we ﬁnd it to be
impossible using (11).
However, upon recognizing the fact that sums of solutions having the form (11)
are also solutions (called the principle of superposition), we are led to the possible solution
Uðx; tÞ ¼
X
1
m¼1
Bme3m22t=4 sin mx
2
ð12Þ
From the condition Uðx; 0Þ ¼ x; 0 < x < 2, we see, on placing t ¼ 0, that (12) becomes
x ¼
X
1
m¼1
Bm sin mx
2
0 < x < 2
ð13Þ
This, however, is equivalent to the problem of expanding the function f ðxÞ ¼ x for 0 < x < 2 into a sine
series.
The solution to this is given in Problem 13.12(a), from which we see that Bm ¼ 4
m cos m so that
(12) becomes
Uðx; tÞ ¼
X
1
m¼1
 4
m cos m


e3m22t=4 sin mx
2
ð14Þ
which is a formal solution. To check that (14) is actually a solution, we must show that it satisﬁes the partial
diﬀerential equation and the boundary conditions.
The proof consists in justiﬁcation of term by term
diﬀerentiation and use of limiting procedures for inﬁnite series and may be accomplished by methods of
Chapter 11.
The boundary value problem considered here has an interpretation in the theory of heat conduction.
The equation @U
@t ¼ k @2U
@x2 is the equation for heat conduction in a thin rod or wire located on the x-axis
between x ¼ 0 and x ¼ L if the surface of the wire is insulated so that heat cannot enter or escape. Uðx; tÞ is
the temperature at any place x in the rod at time t.
The constant k ¼ K=s (where K is the thermal
conductivity, s is the speciﬁc heat, and  is the density of the conducting material) is called the diﬀusivity.
The boundary conditions Uð0; tÞ ¼ 0 and UðL; tÞ ¼ 0 indicate that the end temperatures of the rod are kept
at zero units for all time t > 0, while Uðx; 0Þ indicates the initial temperature at any point x of the rod.
In
this problem the length of the rod is L ¼ 2 units, while the diﬀusivity is k ¼ 3 units.

This result is of interest since it represents an expansion of the contangent into partial fractions.

of a function is a periodic form on 1 < x < 1 obtained by gen-
erating the coeﬃcients from the function’s deﬁnition on the least period ½L; L.
If a function deﬁned
on the set of all real numbers has no period, then an analogy to Fourier integrals can be envisioned as
letting L ! 1 and replacing the integer valued index, n, by a real valued function 	. The coeﬃcients an
and bn then take the form Að	Þ and Bð	Þ. This mode of thought leads to the following deﬁnition.
(See
Problem 14.8.)
THE FOURIER INTEGRAL
Let us assume the following conditions on f ðxÞ:
1.
f ðxÞ satisﬁes the Dirichlet conditions (Page 337) in every ﬁnite interval ðL; LÞ.
2.
ð1
1
j f ðxÞj dx converges, i.e. f ðxÞ is absolutely integrable in ð1; 1Þ.
Then Fourier’s integral theorem states that the Fourier integral of a function f is

(2)
Að	Þ and Bð	Þ with 1 < 	 < 1 are generalizations of the Fourier coeﬃcients an and bn.
The
right-hand side of (1) is also called a Fourier integral expansion of f .
(Since Fourier integrals are
improper integrals, a review of Chapter 12 is a prerequisite to the study of this chapter.)
The result
(1) holds if x is a point of continuity of f ðxÞ. If x is a point of discontinuity, we must replace f ðxÞ by
f ðx þ 0Þ þ f ðx  0Þ
2
as in the case of Fourier series. Note that the above conditions are suﬃcient but not
necessary.

The function Fð	Þ is called the Fourier transform of f ðxÞ and is sometimes written Fð	Þ ¼ ff f ðxÞg.
The function f ðxÞ is the inverse Fourier transform of Fð	Þ and is written f ðxÞ ¼ f1fFð	Þg.
Note: The constants preceding the integral signs in (7) and (8) were here taken as equal to 1=

However, they can be any constants diﬀerent from zero so long as their product is 1=2.
The above is
called the symmetric form. The literature is not uniform as to whether the negative exponent appears in
(7) or in (8).

Note: The Fourier transforms Fc and Fs are (up to a constant) of the same form as Að	Þ and Bð	Þ.
Since f is even for Fc and odd for Fs, the domains can be shown to be 0 < 	 < 1.
When the product of Fourier transforms is considered, a new concept called convolution comes into
being, and in conjunction with it, a new pair (function and its Fourier transform) arises. In particular, if
Fð	Þ and Gð	Þ are the Fourier transforms of f and g, respectively, and the convolution of f and g is
deﬁned to be

where in both (11) and (13) the convolution f  g is a function of x.
It may be said that multiplication is exchanged with convolution.
Also ‘‘the Fourier transform of
the convolution of two functions, f and g is the product of their Fourier transforms,’’ i.e.,
Tðf  gÞ ¼ Gð f Þ TðgÞ:
ðFð	Þ Gð	Þ and f  g) are demonstrated to be a Fourier transform pair in Problem 14.29.)
Now equate the representations of f  g expressed in (11) and (13), i.e.,

PROOF OF THE FOURIER INTEGRAL THEOREM

Present a heuristic demonstration of Fourier’s integral theorem by use of a limiting form of
Fourier series.
Let

Then by substitution (see Problem 13.21, Chapter 13),
f ðxÞ ¼ 1

If we assume that
ð1

j f ðuÞj du converges, the ﬁrst term on the right of (2) approaches zero as L ! 1,
while the remaining part appears to approach

where f ðxÞ and f 0ðxÞ are assumed piecewise continuous in ð0; LÞ and ðL; 0Þ respectively.
(a)
Using Problem 9(a), it is seen that a proof of the given result amounts to proving that
lim

This follows at once from Riemann’s theorem, because FðvÞ ¼ f ðx þ vÞ  f ðx þ 0Þ
v
is piecewise contin-
uous in ð0; LÞ since lim
n!0þ FðvÞ exists and f ðxÞ is piecewise continuous.

A proof of this is analogous to that in part (a) if we make use of Problem 14.9(b).

Gamma and Beta
Functions
THE GAMMA FUNCTION
The gamma function may be regarded as a generalization of n! (n-factorial), where n is any positive
integer to x!, where x is any real number.
(With limited exceptions, the discussion that follows will be
restricted to positive real numbers.)
Such an extension does not seem reasonable, yet, in certain ways,
the gamma function deﬁned by the improper integral
ðxÞ ¼
ð1
0
tx1 et dt
ð1Þ
meets the challenge.
This integral has proved valuable in applications.
However, because it cannot be
represented through elementary functions, establishment of its properties take some eﬀort. Some of the
important ones are outlined below.
The gamma function is convergent for x > 0.
(See Problem 12.18, Chapter 12.)
The fundamental property
ðx þ 1Þ ¼ xðxÞ
ð2Þ
may be obtained by employing the technique of integration by
parts to (1).
The process is carried out in Problem 15.1.
From the form (2) the function ðxÞ can be evaluated for all
x > 0 when its values in the interval 1 % x < 2 are known.
(Any other interval of unit length will suﬃce.)
The table and
graph in Fig. 15-1 illustrates this idea.

The equation (2) is a recurrence relationship that leads to the factorial concept. First observe that if
x ¼ 1, then (1) can be evaluated, and in particular,
ð1Þ ¼ 1:
From (2)
ðx þ 1Þ ¼ xðxÞ ¼ xðx  1Þðx  1Þ ¼    xðx  1Þðx  2Þ    ðx  kÞðx  kÞ
If x ¼ n, where n is a positive integer, then
ðn þ 1Þ ¼ nðn  1Þðn  2Þ . . . 1 ¼ n!
ð3Þ
If x is a real number, then x! ¼ ðx þ 1Þ is deﬁned by ðx þ 1Þ. The value of this identiﬁcation is in
intuitive guidance.
If the recurrence relation (2) is characterized as a diﬀerential equation, then the deﬁnition of ðxÞ
can be extended to negative real numbers by a process called analytic continuation.
The key idea is that
even though ðxÞ is deﬁned in (1) is not convergent for x < 0, the relation ðxÞ ¼ 1
x ðx þ 1Þ allows the
meaning to be extended to the interval 1 < x < 0, and from there to 2 < x < 1, and so on.
A
general development of this concept is beyond the scope of this presentation; however, some information
is presented in Problem 15.7.
The factorial notion guides us to information about ðx þ 1Þ in more than one way.
In the
eighteenth century, Sterling introduced the formula (for positive integer values n)
lim
n!1
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
nnþ1 en
n!
¼ 1
ð4Þ
This is called Sterling’s formula and it indicates that n! asymptotically approaches
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
nnþ1 en for large
values of n.
This information has proved useful, since n! is diﬃcult to calculate for large values of n.
There is another consequence of Sterling’s formula.
It suggests the possibility that for suﬃciently
large values of x,
x! ¼ ðx þ 1Þ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
xxþ1 ex
ð5aÞ
(An argument supporting this is made in Problem 15.20.)
It is known that ðx þ 1Þ satisﬁes the inequality
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
xxþ1 ex < ðx þ 1Þ <
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
xxþ1 ex e
1
12ðxþ1Þ
ð5bÞ
Since the factor e
1
12ðxþ1Þ ! 0 for large values of x, the suggested value (5a) of ðx þ 1Þ is consistent

It can be shown that the gamma function has continuous derivatives of all orders.
They are
obtained by diﬀerentiating (with respect to the parameter) under the integral sign.
It helps to recall that ðxÞ ¼
ð1

tx1eyt dt and that if y ¼ tx1, then ln y ¼ ln tx1 ¼ ðx  1Þ ln t.
Therefore, 1
y y 0 ¼ ln t.
It follows that

This result can be obtained (after making assumptions about the interchange of diﬀerentiation with

If x > 0; y > 0 and either or both x < 1 or y < 1, the

Functions of a Complex
Variable
Ultimately it was realized that to accept numbers that provided solutions to equations such as
x2 þ 1 ¼ 0 was no less meaningful than had been the extension of the real number system to admit a
solution for x þ 1 ¼ 0, or roots for x2  2 ¼ 0.
The complex number system was in place around 1700,
and by the early nineteenth century, mathematicians were comfortable with it.
Physical theories took
on a completeness not possible without this foundation of complex numbers and the analysis emanating
from it.
The theorems of the diﬀerential and integral calculus of complex functions introduce math-
ematical surprises as well as analytic reﬁnement.
This chapter is a summary of the basic ideas.
FUNCTIONS
If to each of a set of complex numbers which a variable z may assume there corresponds one or more
values of a variable w, then w is called a function of the complex variable z, written w ¼ f ðzÞ.
The
fundamental operations with complex numbers have already been considered in Chapter 1.
A function is single-valued if for each value of z there corresponds only one value of w; otherwise it is
multiple-valued or many-valued. In general, we can write w ¼ f ðzÞ ¼ uðx; yÞ þ ivðx; yÞ, where u and v are
real functions of x and y.
EXAMPLE.
w ¼ z2 ¼ ðx þ iyÞ2 ¼ x2  y2 þ 2ixy ¼ u þ iv so that uðx; yÞ ¼ x2  y2; vðx; yÞ ¼ 2xy.
These are
called the real and imaginary parts of w ¼ z2 respectively.
In complex variables, multiple-valued functions often are replaced by a specially constructed single-
valued function with branches.
This idea is discussed in a later paragraph.
EXAMPLE.
Since e2ki ¼ 1, the general polar form of z is z ¼  eiðþ2kÞ. This form and the fact that the logarithm
and exponential functions are inverse leads to the following deﬁnition of ln z
ln z ¼ ln  þ ð þ 2kÞi
k ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; n . . .
Each value of k determines a single-valued function from this collection of multiple-valued functions.
These
are the branches from which (in the realm of complex variables) a single-valued function can be constructed.

LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Deﬁnitions of limits and continuity for functions of a complex variable are analogous to those for a
real variable.
Thus, f ðzÞ is said to have the limit l as z approaches z0 if, given any  > 0, there exists a
 > 0 such that j f ðzÞ  lj <  whenever 0 < jz  z0j < .
Similarly, f ðzÞ is said to be continuous at z0 if, given any  > 0, there exists a  > 0 such that
j f ðzÞ  f ðz0Þj <  whenever jz  z0j < .
Alternatively, f ðzÞ is continuous at z0 if lim
z!z0 f ðzÞ ¼ f ðz0Þ.
Note: While these deﬁnitions have the same appearance as in the real variable setting, remember that
jz  z0j <  means
jðx  x0j þ ið y  y0Þj ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ðx  x0Þ2 þ ð y  y0Þ2
q
< :
Thus there are two degrees of freedom as ðx; yÞ ! ðx0; y0Þ:
DERIVATIVES
If f ðzÞ is single-valued in some region of the z plane the derivative of f ðzÞ, denoted by f 0ðzÞ, is deﬁned
as
lim
z!0
ðf ðz þ zÞ  f ðzÞ
z
ð1Þ
provided the limit exists independent of the manner in which z ! 0.
If the limit (1) exists for z ¼ z0,
then f ðzÞ is called analytic at z0. If the limit exists for all z in a region r, then f ðzÞ is called analytic in r.
In order to be analytic, f ðzÞ must be single-valued and continuous.
The converse, however, is not
necessarily true.
We deﬁne elementary functions of a complex variable by a natural extension of the corresponding
functions of a real variable.
Where series expansions for real functions f ðxÞ exists, we can use as
deﬁnition the series with x replaced by z.
The convergence of such complex series has already been
considered in Chapter 11.
EXAMPLE 1.
We deﬁne ex ¼ 1 þ z þ z2
2! þ z3
3! þ    ; sin z ¼ z  z3
3! þ z5
5!  z7
7! þ    ; cos z ¼ 1  z2
2! þ z4
4!  z6
6! þ    .
From these we can show that ex ¼ exþiy ¼ exðcos y þ i sin yÞ, as well as numerous other relations.
Rules for diﬀerentiating functions of a complex variable are much the same as for those of real
variables.
Thus, d
dz ðznÞ ¼ nzn1; d
dz ðsin zÞ ¼ cos z, and so on.
CAUCHY-RIEMANN EQUATIONS
A necessary condition that w ¼ f ðzÞ ¼ uðx; yÞ þ ivðx; yÞ be analytic in a region r is that u and v
satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
@u
@x ¼ @v
@y ;
@u
@y ¼  @v
@x
ð2Þ
(see Problem 16.7).
If the partial derivatives in (2) are continuous in r, the equations are suﬃcient
conditions that f ðzÞ be analytic in r.
If the second derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y exist and are continuous, we ﬁnd by
diﬀerentiating (2) that
@2u
@x2 þ @2u
@y2 ¼ 0;
@2v
@x2 þ @2v
@y2 ¼ 0
ð3Þ
Thus, the real and imaginary parts satisfy Laplace’s equation in two dimensions.
Functions satisfying
Laplace’s equation are called harmonic functions.

INTEGRALS
Let f ðzÞ be deﬁned, single-valued and continuous in a region r. We deﬁne the integral of f ðzÞ along
some path C in r from point z1 to point z2, where z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1; z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2, as
ð
C
f ðzÞ dz ¼
ððx2;y2Þ
ðx1;y1Þ
ðu þ ivÞðdx þ i dyÞ ¼
ððx2;y2Þ
ðx1;y1Þ
u dx  v dy þ i
ððx2;y2Þ
ðx1;y1Þ
v dx þ u dy
With this deﬁnition the integral of a function of a complex variable can be made to depend on line
integrals for real functions already considered in Chapter 10.
An alternative deﬁnition based on the
limit of a sum, as for functions of a real variable, can also be formulated and turns out to be equivalent
to the one above.
The rules for complex integration are similar to those for real integrals.
An important result is
ð
C
f ðzÞ dz








 @
ð
C
j f ðzÞjjdzj @ M
ð
C
ds ¼ ML
ð4Þ
where M is an upper bound of j f ðzÞj on C, i.e., j f ðzÞj @ M, and L is the length of the path C.
Complex function integral theory is one of the most esthetically pleasing constructions in all of
mathematics.
Major results are outlined below.
CAUCHY’S THEOREM
Let C be a simple closed curve.
If f ðzÞ is analytic within the region bounded by C as well as on C,
then we have Cauchy’s theorem that
ð
C
f ðzÞ dz 
þ
C
f ðzÞ dz ¼ 0
ð5Þ
where the second integral emphasizes the fact that C is a simple closed curve.
Expressed in another way, (5) is equivalent to the statement that
ðz2
z1
f ðzÞ dz has a value independent of
the path joining z1 and z2.
Such integrals can be evaluated as Fðz2Þ  Fðz1Þ, where F 0ðzÞ ¼ f ðzÞ.
These
results are similar to corresponding results for line integrals developed in Chapter 10.
EXAMPLE.
Since f ðzÞ ¼ 2z is analytic everywhere, we have for any simple closed curve C
þ
C
2z dz ¼ 0
Also,
ð1þi
2i
2z dz ¼ z2

CAUCHY’S INTEGRAL FORMULAS

f ðaÞ ¼ 1
2i
þ
C
f ðzÞ

where C is traversed in the positive (counterclockwise) sense.
Also, the nth derivative of f ðzÞ at z ¼ a is given by
f ðnÞðaÞ ¼ n!
2i
þ
C
f ðzÞ
ðz  aÞnþ1 dz
ð7Þ
These are called Cauchy’s integral formulas.
They are quite remarkable because they show that if
the function f ðzÞ is known on the closed curve C then it is also known within C, and the various
394
FUNCTIONS OF A COMPLEX VARIABLE
[CHAP. 16

derivatives at points within C can be calculated.
Thus, if a function of a complex variable has a ﬁrst
derivative, it has all higher derivatives as well.
This, of course, is not necessarily true for functions of
real variables.
TAYLOR’S SERIES
Let f ðzÞ be analytic inside and on a circle having its center at z ¼ a. Then for all points z in the circle
we have the Taylor series representation of f ðzÞ given by
f ðzÞ ¼ f ðaÞ þ f 0ðaÞðz  aÞ þ f 00ðaÞ
2!
ðz  aÞ2 þ f 000ðaÞ
3!
ðz  aÞ3 þ   

See Problem 16.21.
SINGULAR POINTS
A singular point of a function f ðzÞ is a value of z at which f ðzÞ fails to be analytic. If f ðzÞ is analytic
everywhere in some region except at an interior point z ¼ a, we call z ¼ a an isolated singularity of f ðzÞ.
EXAMPLE.
If f ðzÞ ¼
1
ðz  3Þ2, then z ¼ 3 is an isolated singularity of f ðzÞ.
EXAMPLE.
The function f ðzÞ ¼ sin z
z
has a singularity at z ¼ 0.
Because lim
z!0 is ﬁnite, this singularity is called a
removable singularity.
POLES
If f ðzÞ ¼
ðzÞ
ðz  aÞn ; ðaÞ 6¼ 0, where ðzÞ is analytic everywhere in a region including z ¼ a, and if n is a
positive integer, then f ðzÞ has an isolated singularity at z ¼ a, which is called a pole of order n.
If n ¼ 1,
the pole is often called a simple pole; if n ¼ 2, it is called a double pole, and so on.
LAURENT’S SERIES
If f ðzÞ has a pole of order n at z ¼ a but is analytic at every other point inside and on a circle C with
center at a, then ðz  aÞn f ðzÞ is analytic at all points inside and on C and has a Taylor series about z ¼ a
so that
f ðzÞ ¼

ðz  aÞn1 þ    þ a1
z  a þ a0 þ a1ðz  aÞ þ a2ðz  aÞ2 þ   
ð9Þ
This is called a Laurent series for f ðzÞ.
The part a0 þ a1ðz  aÞ þ a2ðz  aÞ2 þ    is called the analytic
part, while the remainder consisting of inverse powers of z  a is called the principal part.
More
generally, we refer to the series
X
1
k¼1
akðz  aÞk as a Laurent series, where the terms with k < 0 constitute
the principal part.
A function which is analytic in a region bounded by two concentric circles having
center at z ¼ a can always be expanded into such a Laurent series (see Problem 16.92).
It is possible to deﬁne various types of singularities of a function f ðzÞ from its Laurent series.
For
example, when the principal part of a Laurent series has a ﬁnite number of terms and an 6¼ 0 while
an1; an2; . . . are all zero, then z ¼ a is a pole of order n.
If the principal part has inﬁnitely many
terms, z ¼ a is called an essential singularity or sometimes a pole of inﬁnite order.
EXAMPLE.
The function e1=z ¼ 1 þ 1
z þ

2! z2 þ    has an essential singularity at z ¼ 0.

BRANCHES AND BRANCH POINTS
Another type of singularity is a branch point.
These points play a vital role in the construction of
single-valued functions from ones that are multiple-valued, and they have an important place in the
computation of integrals.
In the study of functions of a real variable, domains were chosen so that functions were single-
valued.
This guaranteed inverses and removed any ambiguities from diﬀerentiation and integration.
The applications of complex variables are best served by the approach illustrated below.
It is in the
realm of real variables and yet illustrates a pattern appropriate to complex variables.
Let y2 ¼ x; x > 0, then y ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃx
p .
In real variables two functions f1 and f2 are described by
y ¼ þ
ﬃﬃﬃx
p
on x > 0, and y ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃx
p
on x > 0, respectively.
Each of them is single-valued.
An approach that can be extended to complex variable results by deﬁning the positive x-axis (not
including zero) as a cut in the plane.
This creates two branches f1 and f2 of a new function on a domain
called the Riemann axis. The only passage joining the spaces in which the branches f1 and f2, respec-
tively, are deﬁned is through 0.
This connecting point, zero, is given the special name branch point.
Observe that two points x in the space of f1 and x in that of f2 can appear to be near each other in the
ordinary view but are not from the Riemannian perspective.
(See Fig. 16-1.)
The above real variables construction suggests one for complex variables illustrated by w ¼ z1=2.
In polar coordinates e2i ¼ 1; therefore, the general representation of w ¼ z1=2 in that system is
w ¼ 1=2 eiðþ2kÞ=2, k ¼ 0; 1.
Thus, this function is double-valued.
If k ¼ 0, then w1 ¼ 1=2  ei=2, 0 <   2;  > 0
If k ¼ 1, then w2 ¼ 1=2  eiðþ2Þ=2 ¼ 1=2  ei=2i ¼ 1=2  ei=2; 2 <   4;  > 0.
Thus, the two branches of w are w1 and w2, where w1 ¼ w2.
(The double valued characteristic of w
is illustrated by noticing that as z traverses a circle, C: jzj ¼  through the values  to 2. The functional
values run from 1=2ei=2 to 1=2ei.
In other words, as z navigates the entire circle, the range variable
only moves halfway around the corresponding range circle.
In order for that variable to complete the
circuit, z would have to make a second revolution. Thus, we would have coincident positions of z giving
rise to distinct values of w. For example, z1 ¼ eð=2Þ=i and z2 ¼ eð=2þ2Þi are coincident points on the unit
circle.
The distinct functional values are z1=2

The following abstract construction replaces the multiple-valued function with a new single-valued
one.
Make a cut in the complex plane that includes all of the positive x-axis except the origin.
Think of
two planes, P1 and P2, the ﬁrst one of inﬁnitesimal distance above the complex plane and the other
inﬁnitesimally below it.
The point 0 which connects these spaces is called a branch point.
The planes
396
FUNCTIONS OF A COMPLEX VARIABLE
[CHAP. 16
Fig. 16-1

and the connecting point constitute a Riemann surface, and w1 and w2 are the branches of the function
each deﬁned in one of the planes.
(Since the space of complex variables is the complex plane, this
Riemann surface may be thought of as a ﬂight of fancy that supports a rigorous analytic construction.)
To visualize this Riemann surface and perceive the single-valued character of the new function in it,
ﬁrst think of duplicates, C1 and C2 of the domain circle, C: jzj ¼  in the planes P1 and P2, respectively.
Start at  ¼  on C1, and proceed counterclockwise to the edge U2 of the cut of P1.
(This edge
corresponds to  ¼ 2).
Paste U2 to L1, the initial edge of the cut on P2.
Transfer to P2 through
this join and continue on C2. Now after a complete counterclockwise circuit of C2 we reach the edge L2
of the cut.
Pasting L2 to U1 provides passage back to P1 and makes it possible to close the curve in the
Riemann plane.
See Fig. 16-2.
Note that the function is not continuous on the positive x-axis. Also the cut is somewhat arbitrary.
Other rays and even curves extending from the origin to inﬁnity can be employed.
In many integration
applications the cut  ¼ i proves valuable.
On the other hand, the branch point (0 in this example) is
special. If another point, z0 6¼ 0 were chosen as the center of a small circle with radius less than jz0j, then
the origin would lie outside it. As a point z traversed its circumference, its argument would return to the
original value as would the value of w.
However, for any circle that has the branch point as an interior
point, a similar traversal of the circumference will change the value of the argument by 2, and the
values of w1 and w2 will be interchanged.
(See Problem 16.37.)
RESIDUES
The coeﬃcients in (9) can be obtained in the customary manner by writing the coeﬃcients for the
Taylor series corresponding to ðz  aÞnf ðzÞ.
In further developments, the coeﬃcient a1, called the
residue of f ðzÞ at the pole z ¼ a, is of considerable importance.
It can be found from the formula

RESIDUE THEOREM
If f ðzÞ is analytic in a region r except for a pole of order n at z ¼ a and if C is any simple closed
curve in r containing z ¼ a, then f ðzÞ has the form (9).

i.e., the integral of f ðzÞ around a closed path enclosing a single pole of f ðzÞ is 2i times the residue at the
pole.
More generally, we have the following important theorem.
Theorem.
If f ðzÞ is analytic within and on the boundary C of a region r except at a ﬁnite number of
poles a; b; c; . . . within r, having residues a1; b1; c1; . . . ; respectively, then

i.e., the integral of f ðzÞ is 2i times the sum of the residues of f ðzÞ at the poles enclosed by C.
Cauchy’s
theorem and integral formulas are special cases of this result, which we call the residue theorem.
EVALUATION OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS
The evaluation of various deﬁnite integrals can often be achieved by using the residue theorem
together with a suitable function f ðzÞ and a suitable path or contour C, the choice of which may reuqire
great ingenuity.

jz þ 2ij is the distance from z to 2i, so that jz þ 2ij ¼ 1 is a circle of radius 1 with center at 2i,
i.e., ð0; 2Þ; and jz þ 2ij ¼ 2 is a circle of radius 2 with center at 2i. Then 1 < jz þ 2ij @ 2 represents

Conversely, we can prove that if the ﬁrst partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y are

(a) If f ðzÞ ¼ uðx; yÞ þ i vðx; yÞ is analytic in a region r, prove that the one parameter families of
curves uðx; yÞ ¼ C1 and vðx; yÞ ¼ C2 are orthogonal families.
(b) Illustrate by using f ðzÞ ¼ z2.
(a)
Consider any two particular members of these families uðx; yÞ ¼ u0; vðx; yÞ ¼ v0 which intersect at the
point ðx0; y0Þ.
Since du ¼ ux dx þ uy dy ¼ 0, we have
dy

Also since dv ¼ vx dx þ vy dy ¼ 0; dy
dx ¼  vx
vy
:
When evaluated at ðx0; y0Þ, these represent
respectively the slopes of the two curves at this
point of intersection.
By
the

equations,

These are identical if FðxÞ ¼ 2x þ c; Gð yÞ ¼ 4y þ c, where c is a real constant.
Thus,

Method 2.
Integrating (1),  ¼ 2xy þ 4y þ FðxÞ.
Then substituting in (2), 2y þ F 0ðxÞ ¼ 2y  2 or

MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS
16.36. Let w ¼ z2 deﬁne a transformation from the z plane (xy plane) to the w plane ðuv plane).
Consider a triangle in the z plane with vertices at Að2; 1Þ; Bð4; 1Þ; Cð4; 3Þ.
(a) Show that the
image or mapping of this triangle is a curvilinear triangle in the uv plane.
(b) Find the angles of
this curvilinear triangle and compare with those of the original triangle.
(a)
Since w ¼ z2, we have u ¼ x2  y2; v ¼ 2xy as the transformation equations.
Then point Að2; 1Þ in the
xy plane maps into point A 0ð3; 4Þ of the uv plane (see ﬁgures below).
Similarly, points B and C map
into points B 0 and C 0 respectively.
The line segments AC; BC; AB of triangle ABC map respectively
into parabolic segments A 0C 0; B 0C 0; A 0B 0 of curvilinear triangle A 0B 0C 0 with equations as shown in
Figures 16-12(a) and (b).

The slope of the tangent to the curve u2 ¼ 2v þ 1 at ð3; 4Þ is m2 ¼ dv

tan  ¼ m2  m1
1 þ m1m2
¼
3  1
2
1 þ ð3Þð1
2Þ ¼ 1; and  ¼ =4
Similarly, we can show that the angle between A 0C 0 and B 0C 0 is =4, while the angle between A 0B 0
and B 0C 0 is =2. Therefore, the angles of the curvilinear triangle are equal to the corresponding ones of
the given triangle.
In general, if w ¼ f ðzÞ is a transformation where f ðzÞ is analytic, the angle between
two curves in the z plane intersecting at z ¼ z0 has the same magnitude and sense (orientation) as the
angle between the images of the two curves, so long as f 0ðz0Þ 6¼ 0. This property is called the conformal
property of analytic functions, and for this reason, the transformation w ¼ f ðzÞ is often called a con-
formal transformation or conformal mapping function.
16.37. Let w ¼
ﬃﬃﬃz
p deﬁne a transformation from the z plane to the w plane.
A point moves counter-
clockwise along the circle jzj ¼ 1.
Show that when it has returned to its starting position for the
ﬁrst time, its image point has not yet returned, but that when it has returned for the second time,
its image point returns for the ﬁrst time.
Let z ¼ ei.
Then w ¼
ﬃﬃﬃz
p ¼ ei=2.
Let  ¼ 0 correspond to the starting position.
Then z ¼ 1 and
w ¼ 1 [corresponding to A and P in Figures 16-13(a) and (b)].
When one complete revolution in the z plane has been made,  ¼ 2; z ¼ 1, but w ¼ ei=2 ¼ ei ¼ 1, so
the image point has not yet returned to its starting position.
However, after two complete revolutions in the z plane have been made,  ¼ 4; z ¼ 1 and
w ¼ ei=2 ¼ e2i ¼ 1, so the image point has returned for the ﬁrst time.
It follows from the above that w is not a single-valued function of z but is a double-valued function of z;
i.e., given z, there are two values of w.
If we wish to consider it a single-valued function, we must restrict .
We can, for example, choose 0 @  < 2, although other possibilities exist.
This represents one branch of
the double-valued function w ¼
ﬃﬃﬃz
p .
In continuing beyond this interval we are on the second branch, e.g.,
2 @  < 4.
The point z ¼ 0 about which the rotation is taking place is called a branch point.
Equiva-
lently, we can insure that f ðzÞ ¼
ﬃﬃﬃz
p will be single-valued by agreeing not to cross the line Ox, called a branch
line.
