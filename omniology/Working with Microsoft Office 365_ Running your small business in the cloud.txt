Introduction
M
icrosoft Office 365 is taking the small business world by storm. According to Mi-
crosoft, over 90 percent of the sales of Office 365 are to small businesses. I can’t 
say I’m surprised. When you look at the capabilities of Office 365 for professionals and 
small businesses, the offer is compelling.
This book was written for small business owners or consultants to small businesses 
who want to learn how to:
■
■
Know whether the Office 365 small business plan is a good fit.
■
■
Sign up and deploy the service, including domain name configuration.
■
■
Avoid common problems.
■
■
Use the best features of Office 365.
This book is designed for small businesses and professionals who are familiar with 
computers but are not technical professionals. While setting up Office 365 can be quite 
straightforward, there are technical aspects to deployment, particularly around custom 
domains. This book describes in a step-by-step fashion how to move a custom domain 
to Office 365 as well as how to set up your desktop. In fact, providing this guidance to 
owners of the service is one of the primary objectives of the book.
Overall, the book is a guide to anyone who anticipates implementing Office 365 
for professionals and small businesses, from early planning, through deployment, to 
making use of the key features and capabilities. Office 365 is a frequently updated 
service. Be sure to check the Service Updates wiki at http://community.office365.com for 
changes made to the service since this book was published.
Acknowledgments
The changing nature of online services required significant rewrites and overhauls that 
extended my time commitment well beyond initial expectations. I’d like to thank my 
loving wife Ryam for her unrelenting support for this project through the duration. In 
addition, the Office 365 small business product group at Microsoft assisted at key times 
by providing information about upcoming changes and implementation details that 
were essential.

Office 365: A Big Deal for Small 
Business
T
he Cloud is unavoidable these days. Big businesses are talking about it. Small businesses are ask-
ing, “Is this for me?” There are conferences, blogs, papers, and even TV commercials about how 
great the cloud is. But what is all this about really, and does it makes sense for a small business?
What Is a Cloud Service?
At its most basic, a cloud service is one that you access over the Internet. A cloud service subscription 
is not much different from paying for a phone service. In fact, some phone services are Internet-based 
these days. You might have heard the term “Voice over IP” (abbreviated as VoIP and pronounced just 
like it looks). If not, you’ve probably seen Magic Jack™ advertised on TV, which provides a popular 
way to connect a telephone to the Internet. Magic Jack is a cloud-based telephone service. 
Any website you access is a cloud service. Online banking is a cloud service. Amazon.com is a cloud 
service. There are thousands of examples, and if all of these services are so common, why is the cloud 
such a hot topic these days? To answer that question, we need to look at how small businesses use 
online services.
Note  For the purposes of this book, a small business is an organization with 1 to 25 em-
ployees. This is the same scale that Microsoft uses for the Office 365 professionals and small 
businesses plan: organizations from 1 to 25 users. Microsoft allows growth in this plan for 
up to but not exceeding 50 users.
Current Services vs. the Cloud
Small businesses use many different kinds of online services. One-person shops often use free con-
sumer email such as Google Mail or Hotmail. However, by the time you have five or more employees, 
you will need to better organize your digital assets, so your business might want to invest in file and 
email services provided by an ISP or Hosted Exchange. Some small businesses choose to purchase 
a server and host their own services on-premises by using the Microsoft Small Business Server line 

2   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
of products. Others simply piece together the services they need from different instant messaging, 
online meeting, document collaboration, and messaging providers.
The patchwork quilt of services used by small businesses creates an opportunity for large compa-
nies like Microsoft, Google, IBM, and others to offer service suites that unify the services your business 
needs in key areas. These companies have the funds, scale, expertise, and capital to build, market, and 
support the infrastructure needed to offer these services on a massive scale. The result is “The Cloud:” 
a set of core business services offered by trusted names and delivered at a very attractive price. 
Are Cloud Services a Good Deal for Small Businesses?
Consider the responsibilities and resulting costs of providing your own services with servers and soft-
ware that you maintain on-premises. You have to buy, deploy, and maintain the servers. These servers 
need software, support, and expertise to operate continuously. This includes spam filtering, server 
virus scanning, backup systems, uninterruptable power supplies, upgrades, security updates, firewalls, 
and many other activities, all necessary to keep your on-premises systems up and running.
If you are not using your own services, one option is to purchase services from a variety of other 
providers. Costs for professionally hosted services can be high. Consumer-based services are often 
free but lack features and are usually advertising based. In either case, you wind up with a fragmented 
set of services.
What if you could have email, document collaboration, instant messaging, online meetings, web-
based access to your mail and documents, and integration with your mobile phones for only $6 per 
user, per month, with a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee provided by a Fortune 500 company like 
Microsoft? That is what Office 365 provides. For many businesses, this is an exceptionally attractive 
value, and this package deal is why there is so much “buzz” about “The Cloud.” 
Office 365 in a Nutshell
I vividly remember meeting the project manager for Office 365 for small businesses at Microsoft to 
review the feature set. Honestly, I was astonished, and I suspect you will be too. More importantly, I 
learned that Office 365 is more than “buzz”; it’s packed with useful features. Here are some highlights:
■
■
25 GB mailboxes
■
■
Ability to use your company’s domain name for your email addresses
■
■
Minimum of one seat available for purchase, if that’s all you need
■
■
Month to month payments with the ability to cancel anytime; no long-term contract required
■
■
Spam filtering delivered directly to your junk folder 
■
■
All email scanned for viruses before it is delivered to you 

	
What Is a Cloud Service?    3
■
■
Free/busy status that lets you view other people's schedules, create meeting requests, and 
reserve resources (such as rooms, vehicles, or projectors) via Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft 
Exchange
■
■
Ability to publish a basic company website to the Internet 
■
■
External sharing feature that allows you to invite people outside your company to work on 
documents on your Microsoft SharePoint Online site 
■
■
99.9 percent uptime guarantee
■
■
Ability to invite up to 50 anonymous users to your online event, such as a web conference, and 
talk to them using a microphone on your PC—no dialing in to 800 numbers required
■
■
Instant messaging 
■
■
Ability to edit Office documents in a browser (using Office Web Apps)
■
■
Ability to sync email and calendar to a mobile device
■
■
Only $6 per seat (US), per month 
And this list is just the beginning. Office 365 is a frequently updated service. Be sure to check the 
Service Updates wiki at http://community.office365.com for changes made to the service since this 
book was published.
Note  When you make a change to your cable TV service, you just call the company and, 
voilà, your new services are updated. With Office 365, it’s not that simple. You cannot flip 
a switch and convert from the plan for small business to another plan that allows for more 
users. If you think you will be at 51 employees in the foreseeable future, consider start-
ing with the higher-capacity plan. Then you won’t have to migrate your content when you 
reach 51 users. For more advice on choosing the right plan for your business, see Chapter 2, 
“Choosing an Office 365 Plan.”
The Cloud vs. Self-Hosting
If you have your own on-premises servers and are considering a move to Office 365, be aware that 
moving to the cloud requires some tradeoffs. Although using Office 365 and its many conveniences 
frees you to focus more on your business than on IT decisions, that freedom comes with limitations in 
a few areas: 
■
■
Server logs  Servers keep boatloads of information about what they are doing that you don’t 
typically see. An IT professional can access event viewer logs, performance metrics, web server 
logs, Exchange server logs, and many others. With an on-premises server, you or your IT team 
can review these logs when a problem arises to determine the source of the issue. If you move 
to Office 365, Microsoft will not grant you access to the server logs, because the servers host 
data for many people, not just you. 

4   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
■
■
Server access  With Office 365, you cannot log on to the server by using terminal services, 
nor can you view, update, or access any server-level settings. You can configure settings 
related to your account services. In general, this limitation affects people who rely on third-
party additions to Exchange or SharePoint on-premises that are not allowed in SharePoint or 
Exchange Online.
■
■
Timing to apply updates  Microsoft decides when to apply updates to the services. Suppose 
that you discover that a specific update to SharePoint Online will enable a feature that will 
benefit your business. In a self-hosted environment, you could apply the patch right away. For 
Office 365, Microsoft will apply the patch to the services—or not—based on its own schedule. 
Microsoft’s schedule is determined by a lot of competing issues, including complexity, broad 
benefits, and importance of other updates that need to be applied. 
■
■
Data location  With Office 365, your data is hosted in a data center that is determined by 
the address used when you sign up for the services. You have no control over where your data 
is stored. 
■
■
Security  The security features built in to the service are the only ones available to you. It 
is absolutely true that some businesses have security requirements that are not available in 
Office 365, such as the ability to enforce specialized password complexity requirements or 
specialized auditing requirements. Businesses with a non-negotiable need for security features 
not available in Office 365 should find another solution. 
■
■
Limited liability  As with most services, if the cloud services fail for some reason, Microsoft 
is responsible for refunding only the portion of your service subscription fee associated with 
the downtime. If data is lost, you cannot recover damages from Microsoft. With redundancy in 
the data center, continuous backups, and fail-over for entire data centers in place, the chances 
of lost data are low. Even so, for security and compliance reasons, many businesses augment 
their own on-premises or cloud services with email and document archiving systems.
■
■
Dependency on Internet connectivity  When your services are cloud-based, if your con-
nection to the Internet is lost, you will experience a disruption. Often you can still work locally 
with email, due to Outlook’s cached mode, and also with locally stored documents that are 
checked out to you. But you should make plans to have alternative ways to access the Internet 
in case of a local outage.
As you can see, having your data in the cloud is really quite different than hosting your own ser-
vices. While you do surrender control and are dependent on the Internet, what are the benefits? Why 
would you move to the cloud? 
How Can My Company Benefit from Office 365?
Office 365 is packaged in a variety of plans, as you’ll learn in Chapter 2. The primary focus of this 
book, called Office 365 for professionals and small businesses, or Plan P1 for short, is aimed at busi-
nesses with 1 to 25 employees, but it can accommodate growth up to 50 users. No matter which 

	
How Can My Company Benefit from Office 365?    5
plan you choose or which name you use for it, the benefits to your company are the same and many. 
Office 365 can help you to upgrade your image, improve productivity, and leverage your investments 
in online services and Microsoft Office.
Professional Image
One of the primary reasons small businesses and professionals benefit from using Office 365 has 
to do with image. Hand someone a business card with your company name and a Google Mail or 
Hotmail account as an email address, for example, and you just might send the wrong message. Cus-
tomarily, businesses of substance use email addresses specific to their businesses, rather than using a 
free online service. With Office 365, you can have all your mail delivered to and sent from your own 
custom domain, ensuring that your business mail looks business-like. 
Do you have a good looking website that explains your business, has a map, and provides a way to 
contact or locate you? With Office 365, you can start a simple, clean, and professional website at no 
additional cost. 
When you need to meet with a customer, sending her a meeting request in Outlook that includes 
a link to an online meeting hosted in Lync Online is very impressive. Online meetings are much easier 
to arrange than you might think, and enterprises use them extensively. In addition, you can host 
webinars or online conferences for up to 50 people at a time.
These kinds of features are usually available only when you host your own services or purchase 
online services that have significant associated costs. With Office 365, many small businesses and 
professionals, as small as one person, can have these impressive capabilities without the overhead of 
the infrastructure so that they can look and act like a much larger company.
Keep Using What You Know
One of the best aspects of moving to Office 365 is that you can continue to use Microsoft Office 
much the same way that you do now. The time you’ve invested in learning about Office and creat-
ing Office documents is not only preserved, but enhanced. With Office 365, you can collaborate very 
easily with SharePoint Online. In Chapter 11, “Working with SharePoint Online,” you’ll learn that you 
don’t even need to exit Microsoft Word when you want to open and edit documents that are hosted 
in SharePoint Online. 
In fact, I like to think about Office 365 for professionals and small businesses as more of a way of 
expanding Microsoft Office to have cloud features, rather than buying a pure cloud service. Many 
features of Microsoft Office just “wake up” when you use Office 365. For example, as you can see in 
Figure 1-1, Microsoft Word automatically knows when it is connected to SharePoint Online and allows 
you to check out the document. No configuration, add-ons, or other specialized settings are needed. 
As a result, you can often benefit from using Office 365 without ever leaving Microsoft Office applica-
tions. You keep working in a familiar user interface and get the additional benefits of sharing and 
document collaboration.

SharePoint Online. 
Work In or Out of the Office
Because your data is hosted in the cloud, you can work from any location that has Internet access, 
including your mobile phone. If your office Internet connection goes down, just move over to the 
local coffee shop Wi-Fi connection, and you’re back in business. When you’re away from your office 
and Microsoft Office, you can use any computer browser to access your email or documents. Plus, 
Office 365 synchronizes your mail with your mobile phone so that you can receive and reply to email 
directly from your phone. 
Security and Availability
Few things impact businesses more profoundly than when email is disrupted. Hosting your own email 
services gives you total control, but you are subject to outages due to local equipment failures, local 
ISP connectivity security problems, and unforeseen issues that occur during updates or configuration 
changes. Any hosted service you obtain will have the same issues, but the procedures and processes 
for updating services at Microsoft’s multimillion dollar data center with millions of mailboxes are gen-
erally more rigorous by several orders of magnitude.

Office 365 services are provided with a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee. In effect, if the services 
are down for more than nine hours annually, you get money back. In practice, this means that if the 
services are down for an unplanned outage for more than 45 minutes in a month, you are due a 
refund. Many small businesses have difficulty achieving this level of service availability with their own 
on-premises solutions. Table 1-1, which is taken from the Exchange Online Microsoft Exchange Online 
Service Level Agreement (SLA), details the credit scale.

The same rationale applies to security. Office 365 provides full virus scanning and spam manage-
ment in its data centers. In addition, Microsoft data centers have obtained certifications from third 
parties attesting to the data center compliance with industry-accepted standards and practices.
More Info You can obtain free virus scanning for your local computers from Microsoft 
Security Essentials (http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx).
For more information about the Microsoft data centers, see the Office 365 Security and 
Service Continuity for Enterprises white paper at http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/
details.aspx?id=13602. While this paper is focused on the enterprise offerings of Office 365, 
the enterprise and small business services are hosted in the same data centers. 
Using Office 365: A True Story
While consulting with a small mortgage company, I asked its IT Manager whether he was us-
ing any online service besides email. As is often the case, he replied that he wasn’t, so I went 
through my usual talk about how SharePoint Online allows you to provide a distributed work-
force with access to documents. 
He perked up and asked if that meant that they could scan documents and post them on 
SharePoint. Indeed it did. Currently, he explained, one employee spent up to two hours every 
day copying documents and faxing them to agents who worked all over the country. Now, with 
Office 365, the employee could scan the documents, and post the resulting PDFs to SharePoint 
Online, and then automatically send a simple email notification to prompt the agents to log on 
and fetch the documents or download them to their phones. “You just saved us a 40-hour work 
week every month,” he said.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
This solution was very simple to implement and required no custom code, special ap-
plications, or updates (other than the initial Office 365 setup). The mobile devices came into 
the picture automatically. The owner of the company could have gone with a somewhat less 
expensive service, but the unexpected benefit from SharePoint Online essentially justified the 
entire subscription. Applying technology to problems of this sort is where productivity benefits 
can easily pay off in unexpected ways.
What’s Included in Office 365?
In some ways, subscribing to Office 365 is like buying a cable TV plan. Just as the specific cable 
channels you receive are dependent on the package you buy, the Office 365 features you receive 
are dependent on your subscription plan. Selecting the right plan is very important, as you’ll learn in 
Chapter 2, which is dedicated to helping you make the right decision. However, all the plans incorpo-
rate the three core services—Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Lync Online—on some level. 
Office Web Apps is also a key feature because it’s part of SharePoint Online; it is not a stand-alone 
service. Because you need to know what’s on the various channels before you can choose the ones 
you want, the next sections provide a closer look at Office 365’s core services, as well as the Office 
Professional Plus option.
Exchange Online for Email
Exchange Online is the Office 365 email service (which Microsoft calls “Messaging”). You typically use 
Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2010 to connect to your Exchange Online mailbox. Also, part of Office 365 
is a browser-based version of Outlook called Outlook Web App, often called OWA for short. OWA is a 
fully functioning web application with which you can manage your mail from almost any computer or 
even from a mobile device. 
With Outlook and Outlook Web App, you can do a lot more than just manage email. You can set 
up meetings, see who’s online now and who’s not (via presence indicators), read documents from 
SharePoint Online, connect to blogs and other services (via RSS feeds), manage tasks, create to-do 
lists, and more.
Exchange Online is based on Exchange Server 2010, which drives enterprise-class mail services for 
many of the largest companies in the world. However, don’t assume that “enterprise” translates to 
“way too complicated and big for my small business needs.” Just because an enterprise-class service 
can be complicated doesn’t mean you have to use it that way. The small business plan for Office 365 
is simplified, and as a result, you have fewer choices in the administration portal. Some of the easi-
est features to use are also the most useful. We’ll focus on these high-impact, easy-to-implement 
features, such as checking documents in and out of SharePoint Online, sending an online meeting 
request from Outlook, and creating distribution groups with Exchange Online.

	
What’s Included in Office 365?    9
In addition to Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010, you can use Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac and 
other email clients that support the POP protocol (Windows Live Mail, for example) or IMAP protocol. 
Outlook 2003 is not supported with Office 365 but was supported with Business Productivity Online 
Suite (the name for the previous version of the services). If you have Outlook 2003, you must upgrade 
if you want to use Office 365. See the Office Professional Plus subscription for details about how you 
can subscribe to Office 2010 rather than purchasing it outright.
Mail features commonly of interest to many small businesses include:
■
■
25-GB mailbox  By default, you are given a 25-GB mailbox, which is the largest mailbox pos-
sible. In practice, this is much more than you need. In fact, if you have a mailbox that is much 
larger than 1 GB, you should consider reducing the size, because Outlook performance can 
degrade when searching for specific content. 
■
■
Ad free  Free email services often place advertisements in email as a way to fund their opera-
tions. When you use Exchange Online, your email will not be cluttered with any additional 
messages or “brought to you by” taglines.
■
■
Spam filtering  Microsoft uses its own product, ForeFront Protection for Exchange (http://
www.microsoft.com/forefront/protection-for-exchange/en/us/default.aspx), to provide spam 
filtering at no extra cost. ForeFront is well regarded as a reliable spam filtering system.
■
■
Virus and malware protection  Also provided by ForeFront, all mail in and out of Exchange 
Online is always scanned for malware. Remember that virus-scanning software should already 
be installed on your PCs and is not part of Office 365.
■
■
Contacts  Contacts are really important to many small businesses. Contacts can be prospects, 
suppliers, vendors, and contractors—anyone who is not part of your organization about whom 
you need to keep details. Using Outlook, you can create contacts that are available just to you. 
With Exchange Online, you can create and share contacts with your entire company. Chapter 
8, “Working with Outlook Web App,” will teach you how to share contacts.
■
■
MailBox alias  Frequently, you might need a mailbox to have more than one identity. While 
the address for a mailbox might be bill@contoso.com, you might want Bill to also get mail for 
sales@contoso.com. This is simple to configure in Office 365 and will be covered in Chapter 8.
■
■
Mobile support  Use your iPhone, Windows Phone, Android, or other device to send and 
receive email and review documents at no extra cost. Included with Office 365 for Small Busi-
ness is the ability to configure a mobile device to connect to your services. Having your phone 
wired up to the information flow for your business allows you and your employees to keep in 
touch and stay up to date on events as they occur. You can send and receive email, reply to 
meeting requests, view documents (including Microsoft PowerPoint slides [see Figure 1-2]), 
receive alerts and notifications, and more.

Important  Your cell phone service provider might charge for the bandwidth for your email, 
so be aware of what charges are associated with email to and from your phone. In particu-
lar, when traveling overseas, be sure to understand what can happen if you are roaming 
and receiving email. I know a well-respected member of the IT community who received a 
bill in excess of $10,000 because he didn’t realize his phone was using foreign carriers every 
couple of minutes to send and receive mail while traveling abroad.
■
■
Access to mail from the web  You can access your mail from any computer connected to 
the web by using the very functional Outlook Web App at https://portal.microsoftonline.com. 
■
■
Scheduling meetings  Exchange Online in Office 365 lets you use Outlook 2007, Outlook 
2010, or Outlook Web App to easily find a mutually free time to schedule the meeting. 
■
■
Signatures  Outlook and OWA offer the ability to add a signature or any one of a set of sig-
natures to your email. This provides a professional and uniform look and turns each communi-
cation into a branding opportunity.
■
■
Rules  One of the most popular features of Outlook is the ability to create custom rules to 
manage your mail. Rules can be applied to any incoming or outgoing message, such as “When 
I receive mail addressed to me from prospect@mywebsite.com play the Alarm sound,” or 
“When I receive mail with the phrase ‘urgent’ in the Subject, mark the message as important 
and place it in the Urgent folder.”
■
■
Out-of-office messages  When traveling or unavailable, you can easily set up an automatic 
reply that informs people about how to reach you or other delegated contacts. 
SharePoint Online for Document Collaboration and Websites
Have you ever tried to collaborate on a document with a group of people by sending the docu-
ment around via email? Microsoft Word provides some helpful tools. For example, by using its Track 
Changes feature, you and other users can easily see the edits in a document as well as who made 
them, and accept or reject those changes later. With Word’s Comment feature you also can add com-
ments for others to review or read other’s comments. However, neither of these features addresses 
the bigger problem of “versioning issues” spawned by using email to circulate a document. 

	
What’s Included in Office 365?    11
For example, John sends a document to his team with an email saying, “This is the first draft of 
the new user’s guide. Please comment and return by Wednesday.” On Wednesday, John receives 
three documents via email, each with different comments and edits. He spends a day integrating the 
changes and sends the new document back out with an email saying “Here is the updated draft, as 
per your comments. Look it over and let me know by Friday if we’re good to go.” About three hours 
later, he gets an email from a team member that says, “John, I sent your draft to Emily, who had some 
really great additions. Can you add these in?” Emily actually made significant updates to the previous 
version. The second draft was already in circulation and under review. What’s John supposed to do?
Document Version Control Using SharePoint Online
SharePoint Online solves John’s problem; instead of sending the document itself to multiple review-
ers, he can send them a link to the document. To avoid versioning issues, SharePoint Online hosts the 
“one true copy” that can be checked in and checked out. When a team member checks out the docu-
ment to work on it, other members cannot edit that version of the document, and all versions of the 
document are saved in sequence.
Figure 1-3  Checking out a document in SharePoint Online.
Figure 1-3 shows Allison checking out a document in the SharePoint Online site. After she opens it, 
she doesn’t need to go back to SharePoint Online to check the document in or manage versions for 
the document. She (and you) can do that within Word itself, as Figure 1-1 shows.
Checking out documents helps to manage multiple versions of edited documents because each 
contributor can mark up and add comments to the same document. In addition, if someone does 
upload a new document by the same name, you can easily configure SharePoint Online to keep cop-
ies of all versions and increment the version numbers automatically. You can also see who has the 
document checked out and add status information about a document for others to see, showing that 
any particular document is a draft, in review, final, or out for design work. Plus, it is easy to configure 

12   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
SharePoint Online to send an email noting whenever a document is changed or updated. These fea-
tures alone can provide a significant improvement in productivity.
External Document Sharing
In addition to working with your coworkers, you can share your document collaboration site with 
users outside of your company. Microsoft calls this the external document sharing feature, but the 
technical name for this feature is extranet. An extranet is a computer network to which you can grant 
access to internal resources to users outside the company. 
With external document sharing, you can collaborate on documents with contractors, partners, 
vendors, or other individuals or organizations. The Small Business plan allows you to invite up to 50 
users external to your company at no additional costs.
Important  As of this writing, SharePoint Online communications do not include Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) under Plan P1. This limits some of the features and means that docu-
ments are not encrypted when being sent across the Internet. Microsoft does include SSL 
for higher-level plans. This is one of those security considerations that were mentioned 
earlier.
Public Website
SharePoint Online, as with Office 365 for Small Business, includes the ability to publish a publicly avail-
able website. You create your site by using the Site Designer Wizard, which can help you to create an 
attractive, simple website suitable for many small businesses. 
It is not fully customizable because you must use the wizard to create the site, and you cannot run 
custom code such as a shopping cart or payment system. Even so, for many businesses that simply 
need to have an identity on the web for reference by customers, suppliers, partners, and others, the 
site can provide your contact details, description of your business and services, and a few other pages.
Offline Viewing of Files
The term “offline viewing” means “looking at or working with documents hosted online, while not on 
the Internet.” This is similar to watching a TiVo recording of a cable TV show. You can disconnect your 
cable but still watch the recording. 
Some pure cloud service providers have tried to sell the notion that you don’t really need offline 
access to your data. But you and I live in the real world and understand that sometimes you get unex-
pected calls at inconvenient times. You need to get your hands on an important piece of information 
(such as the budget for a specific project, a list of phone extensions, or an invoice) in a hurry. Problem 
is you’re in the car, a parking garage, at a baseball game, or some other inconvenient place where you 

	
What’s Included in Office 365?    13
weren’t really planning on needing Internet access. And of course, sometimes you are traveling and 
an Internet connection is not available, but you still need access to work documents. A lot of work 
gets done on airplanes.
You can edit files that are checked out to you even when you’re not online. In addition, SharePoint 
Online allows you to publish your documents to a folder in Outlook where you can view or work with 
documents when offline. Finally, there is a SharePoint Workplace, with which you can synchronize files 
with the SharePoint Online site.
Shared Lists, Calendars, and Contacts
You can use SharePoint Online to share more than just documents. Using Outlook, you can easily cre-
ate a contact list and publish it company-wide or only to a specific group of employees. You can share 
a common calendar, as well. Events posted to the calendar appear on the shared calendar, right next 
to your personal calendar in Outlook. Everyone in the company can see the same events, but they 
cannot see your personal appointments. The same goes for many tasks or to-do lists. 
In Chapter 11, you’ll learn how to add shared calendars and create lists. Custom lists can be 
imported from Microsoft Excel or created by using SharePoint Online for any purpose you require, 
such as lists of vendors, inventory, sales and marketing figures, tracking the status of various projects, 
approval cycles for documents, managing sales cycles, and more. 
Custom Applications
If you buy a website from a website service provider, chances are that your site is hosted on a server 
that delivers your site along with many other customers’ sites. This works quite well for most small 
businesses and is one of the reasons that hosting services is relatively inexpensive. 
SharePoint Online operates the same way. It is called a multi-tenant service. Your SharePoint 
Online sites and content are hosted on a server with other people’s sites and contents but are sepa-
rated by security boundaries enforced by the technology.
SharePoint also has the ability to add custom applications to your site. This presents a bit of prob-
lem for multi-tenant services. For example, what if someone uploads an application that requires a 
great deal of CPU time, perhaps trying to predict the path of a hurricane. Or maybe someone uploads 
an application that attempts to declare a large amount of memory for its own use. The CPU and 
memory are shared resources needed by everyone on the server. If one site over consumes resources, 
everyone else’s performance will suffer. 
To address this problem, Microsoft created the SharePoint sandbox. Applications that run in the 
sandbox are assigned a specific set of resources that they cannot exceed. You can host applications 
written for your business or third-party applications that are written to run in the SharePoint sandbox. 
In contrast, some other SharePoint applications are not designed for sandbox deployment, so if you 
are considering a custom application, be sure it is built for sandbox deployment. If your developer has 
questions about this, send him to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg317460.aspx for details.

Office Web Apps
Office Web Apps (OWA)—not to be confused with Outlook Web App, which is also frequently 
abbreviated OWA—are browser-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Microsoft OneNote. 
Using Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari, you can open 
documents hosted on SharePoint Online (see Figure 1-4 for an example) and do light editing without 
having Microsoft Office installed. 
FIGURE 1-4 Microsoft Word Web App, as viewed in Internet Explorer 8.
You can also access documents by using a mobile device. This is a useful feature when you are 
asked to review an important document but have only a mobile phone connection to the Internet. 
Also, turn this situation around and imagine that you need someone to review a document in a hurry 
and they are available only by mobile phone. That’s what I mean by increasing productivity. 
Instant Messaging and Online Meetings with Lync Online
As shown in Figure 1-5, Lync Online provides instant messaging, voice calls, online meetings, and 
presence for users of Office 365. To use Lync Online, you install the Lync 2010 client. Lync 2010 is pro-
vided as a part of the Office 365 for professionals and small businesses subscription at no additional 
cost and should be installed on every computer you plan to use with Office 365.

	
What’s Included in Office 365?    15
FIGURE 1-5 Lync 2010.
Lync 2010 has a small footprint, looks attractive, and is straightforward to use. It’s easy to instant 
message people and to use the other basic features. But just because the user interface looks simple 
doesn’t mean it is a basic application! Lync 2010 is packed with features, including a full web confer-
encing system with voice and video capabilities. Chapter 12, “Working with Lync Online,” focuses on 
the most useful features and offers some best practices for working with Lync Online.
Instant Messaging
Nothing beats instant messaging (IM) when you need to know something right away. Sometimes 
called “chat,” instant messaging is available via several free services, such as Google Talk, Live Messen-
ger, Skype, and AIM. A quick answer using IM can eliminate several emails, so you can get to the next 
step in your project without waiting on a reply. Once again, this translates to improved productivity.
Using Lync Online and the Lync 2010 client, you can have a private instant messaging system for 
your organization. You can look up a user’s phone number, see whether she is online, chat, and pos-
sibly send files and have a voice conversation. In addition, you can also chat with others outside of 
your organization.
Presence
One of the easiest to use and most beneficial features of Lync Online is a feature known as presence. 
Presence uses colored dots to indicate a particular user’s status. The colors and their associated sta-
tuses are: green, available; orange, busy; red, unavailable; yellow, away; or clear, offline.

16   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Presence is, of course, shown in Lync 2010 (see Figure 1-7), so you can see whether someone is 
available for a chat. However, you can also view presence in Outlook, Outlook Web App (see Figure 
1-6), Office Web App, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Office, and other presence-aware applications. 
FIGURE 1-6 The presence feature in Outlook Web App (Allison and Ben are online and available).
Presence is incredibly useful when you’re typing a message to someone and you notice the green 
dot next to his name. You can then just double-click on his name and start an instant messaging 
session. 
Online Conferences
Online conferences with Lync Online 2010 can be a lot of fun. Normally, if you are instant messaging 
with someone and you want to show her a document, picture, or drawing, you’d have to email her 
the file or place it in an accessible location like SharePoint Online. Because you’re both looking at the 
same document but can’t see each other, you have to continually reference landmarks such as “Are 
you on page 5?” With Lync Online, you can easily just invite your coworkers to an online conference 
and then share the application in real time. You can all continue to IM while discussing the applica-
tion, with everyone looking at the same document. You can even give the person you are meeting 
with control of the application on your desktop!

FIGURE 1-7 Presence in Lync 2010 (Ben is showing as busy; Allison is available).
You might recall an earlier reference to enterprise-class applications and how small businesses 
might shy away from these out of concern that they are simply too complicated or overpowered for 
a “small” business. Granted, a lot of small businesses are located in a single office or have only one or 
two employees. In those situations, the use of instant messaging might not be that great a benefit. 
Even so, many small businesses have a central office with workers or segments of the business out of 
the office or on the road. Instant messaging and online meetings can be very helpful to these kinds of 
companies.
Even if you’re a one-person business, Lync Online has another important capability that you should 
know about: Lync Online replaces Microsoft Live Meeting services to provide web conferencing capa-
bilities. It competes with services like GoToMeeting.com, which, as of this writing, is many times more 
expensive per person than one seat in Office 365.
With Lync Online, you can hold an unlimited number of meetings and invite up to 50 users to any 
event. Attendees do not need an Office 365 license. They can access the meeting by using Lync Web 
App or by using an installable Lync client for a richer experience.
In your webinar, you can present to your attendees by using Voice (no conference call bridge is 
needed when using VoIP) and Video, and you can use a shared whiteboard, take real-time surveys, 
distribute documents, display series of slides in PowerPoint (annotating the deck in real time) as you 
lecture and do live demonstrations. Users can ask questions with voice or chat, and you can record 
the session for distribution (internal library, website, YouTube, and so on). With a service like this, you 

18   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
can really set yourself apart from your competitors by inviting clients and partners into private online 
meetings to review documents.
Office Professional Plus (Optional)
Microsoft Office is the world’s most widely used Office suite and includes a variety of applications, 
including Word, Access, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Visio. You can also 
obtain SharePoint Designer 2010 for free, and it can be used to customize the appearance of your 
SharePoint Online team site (not the public website).
Many small businesses would like to use the latest and greatest version of Office, but the price tag 
can be steep for a small business budget. To make it easier on everyone, Office 365 subscribers can 
purchase a subscription to Office Professional Plus (http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-plus/
professional-plus-version-comparison-FX101871482.aspx). 
A subscription has many advantages for small businesses, including reduced initial outlay for 
upgrading from previous versions of Office; providing a known and predictable cost for your Office 
software; and ensuring that you have the latest releases, which include new features and capabilities. 
For example, Office 2010 comes with improved SharePoint Online integrations, a PowerPoint broad-
casting service, and the SharePoint Workspace for offline editing for SharePoint files. When sub-
scribed, you can download and install Office Professional Plus on up to five computers per user. When 
installed, Office Professional Plus automatically validates and maintains your licensing (no key codes 
to keep) with Office 365. 
Next Steps
With a better understanding of the advantages and tradeoffs of using Office 365, you’re ready to take 
the next step: choosing a plan. Chapter 2 will help you with that decision; the remainder of the book 
will provide immediately actionable and practical advice about how you can set up, deploy, administer, 
and use Office 365 in your small business.

C h a p t e r  2
Choosing an Office 365 Plan
M
icrosoft specifically designed the Office 365 for professionals and small businesses and plan, also 
known as Plan P1, to suit the needs of small businesses and professionals, including the many 
one-person businesses in the world. For the majority of these businesses, the one-to-50-seat Plan P1 
is more than capable and is actually overqualified for the job in many ways. Even so, one size does not 
fit all, so Microsoft also offers a range of additional Office 365 plans that are aimed at enterprise-level 
businesses and two plans for kiosk users as well as add-on subscriptions and stand-alone services. 
Each has specific capabilities, limitations, and requirements. 
Which plan or combination of plans is right for your small business? This chapter focuses on 
answering that question. As you read, consider your own particular circumstances, both now and 
where you plan to take your business in the future. As described in Chapter 1, “Office 365: A Big Deal 
for Small Business,” and recapped in Table 2-2, Plan P1 is a great choice for most small businesses. 
But does that include you? 
The E Plans
Microsoft classifies its four E plans as the “mid-size and enterprise” plans for Office 365. Although the 
names of these plans suggest that they are designed for larger businesses, many small businesses find 
a better fit in an E plan. You can buy an E plan with just one user, and you’re not limited on the num-
ber of users you can add later. I encourage you to evaluate your choices based on the feature set you 
require (or foresee requiring as your business grows) and the price you’re willing to pay, rather than 
on Microsoft’s named categories. 
Table 2-1 outlines the pricing (in US dollars) and basic features of Plans E1 through E4. Each suc-
cessive plan includes all the features of the lower plans, plus at least one additional service or capability. 
You can find the Microsoft version of this chart at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise-
solutions/enterprise-plans.aspx. Refer to the Microsoft site for updates because the service prices, 
features, and plans might change.

Advantages of All E Plans
Each E plan gives you a little more for your money, but all four share some advantages over the basic 
Plan P1. The most obvious advantage is that E plans allow your business to grow larger than 50 users. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Plan P1 has a hard stop at 50 users. You cannot call Microsoft and say, 
“Switch me over to an E plan.” It is necessary to download your data, create a new Office 365 account, 
and reload your data to the new account. 
The E plans also allow you to add additional capacity for SharePoint Online storage. Both the P1 
and the E plans come with 10 GB of storage plus another 500 MB per user seat you purchase. For 
example, a 25-seat plan would provide 22.5 GB (10 GB + [500 MB * 25 users]) of file storage on Share-
Point Online. If you foresee needing more than this standard allotment, you should consider Plan E, 
which allows you to purchase additional storage for $0.20 per GB, per month. 
An additional major difference is in the area of identity. The E plans allow you to install federation 
services to allow single sign-on and directory synchronization to replicate users, groups, contacts, and 
distribution lists into Office 365. Plan P1 does not include federation services. 
If you subscribe to the E plans, you can add K plans, which are designed for kiosk users (these are 
described later in this chapter in the section titled “The K Plans”). Subscribers to Plan P1 cannot add K 
or E plans to the same company. 
Using the E plans, you can configure a rule in Exchange Online to automatically add a footnote to 
all outgoing mail. Businesses—even small ones—often need to attach a disclaimer or other footnote 

	
  The E Plans    21
to every email. In Plan P1, you can add a footnote, but you have to do it by using Signatures in 
Micorsoft Outlook or in OWA, which means that you need to configure it for each user. Because it’s 
a manual process, it can become time-consuming. In addition, you cannot keep users from changing 
the signature, so you can never be sure that your policy is being enforced. This might not sound like a 
major issue, but consider the implications for a legal or accounting firm that, for the purposes of legal 
compliance, must provide a specifically worded privacy warning in every email.
Perhaps the biggest difference between E plans and Plan P1 is the support policy. With Plan P1, 
you can do research and ask questions in forums (at http://community.office365.com), but if you have 
a technical problem, you cannot call Microsoft. The E1 plan includes 24/7 support by email or phone.
Why no on-demand support for the P1? At $6 a seat, Microsoft simply cannot afford to take calls 
from small business subscribers. If yours is one of those businesses that won’t use a key business ser-
vice unless support is available when you need it, you need to buy an E plan. Alternately, you can hire 
a Microsoft Partner to troubleshoot for you and your Plan P1. 
Plan E1
Plan E1 is the “basic” E plan, and it replaces Microsoft’s Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS). 
Customers on BPOS will be migrated to Plan E1 throughout 2012. 
Because it is important to start with the right plan, it’s important to consider the pricing and the 
relative merits of Plan E1 and Plan P1, side by side. Plan E1 is $8 per seat, per month, and includes the 
basic services you’d expect from Office 365: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Lync Online. 
Why is it $2 per month per user more? Table 2-2 compares key features of Plans P1 and E1.

As you can see, Plan P1 offers capabilities not found in Plan E1, such as the ability to edit using 
Office Web Apps and the use of Access services with SharePoint Online. You have to evaluate for 
yourself the importance of these services in your business. For details about editing with Office Web 
Apps, refer to the ”Use Office Web Apps” section in Chapter 11, “Working with SharePoint Online.” 
Having Access Services enabled in Plan P1 opens the door to providing tight integration between 
Microsoft Access and SharePoint Online. 
Although Access services don’t steal the spotlight, with them, you can create create integrations 
and automations that go well beyond what you can otherwise accomplish. In my experience, some 
well-conceived design and development using Access services can pay big dividends by automat-
ing workflows, reporting, and data management in areas that are unique and mission critical to your 
business. Because these are technical features that often require custom coding, they are not covered 
in this book. Utilizing these features might require that you work with an IT professional. For more 
details about publishing Access databases to SharePoint Online, see http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/
sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/build-and-publish-an-access-database-to-sharepoint-HA102435342.

Overall, consider Plan P1 if you want phone support, the option to expand SharePoint Online stor-
age, SSL encryption of documents used with SharePoint, or if you expect to have more than 50 users 
in the foreseeable future. If you want the ability to edit documents by using Office Web Apps but 
cannot use Plan P1, you must move on to Plan E2. If you require Access services but cannot use P1, 
you must move on to Plans E3 or E4.
Plan E2 
Plan E2 is the next step up from E1. It includes all of the features of Plan E1, plus the ability to view 
and edit Office documents online in a web browser by using Office Web Apps. Using Office Web 
Apps, you can work with Microsoft Office documents directly in a browser. The ability to read docu-
ments using Office Web Apps is built into all Office 365 plans, but the ability to edit them is not. Gen-
erally, you would use Office Web Apps only when you don’t have a computer available with Microsoft 
Office installed on it. The question you need to ask is how important is this feature to your business? 
If you need staff to edit documents from anywhere, anytime, on devices without Microsoft Word 
installed, you need Plan P1, E2, E3, or E4. If browser-based editing is not essential, Plan E1 is a choice.
In practice, most small businesses have Microsoft Office, and it’s equally easy to open a document 
in a browser or in Word from SharePoint Online. Simply click a Word document stored in SharePoint 
Online; it will open in Word Web App in your browser, as shown in Figure 2-1. If you have Plan P1, E2, 
E3, or E4, you can click Edit In Browser. No matter which plan you have, you can click Open In Word 
and edit your document. 

	
  The E Plans    23
Figure 2-1  The Plan P1 Office Word App menu. 
Plans E3 and E4
The high-end Plans E3 and E4 include all the capabilities of E2, plus they have Microsoft Access, 
Business Connectivity Services (BCS), Microsoft InfoPath Forms, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Visio 
Services enabled for SharePoint Online services. For small businesses with only basic needs, these 
features might be extraneous. For more complex scenarios, this is where the fun is!
Access, InfoPath, Visio, Excel, and BCS services are SharePoint Online features that enable you to 
do some pretty amazing things. These services bring to life the integration of Microsoft Office and 
SharePoint Online and provide a high value for streamlining tedious document workflows that are 
often bottlenecks in many businesses. With this technology, anyone with some imagination and the 
right expertise can build simple-to-implement but highly productive ways to meet your specific busi-
ness needs.
For example, with InfoPath Forms Services, you can create forms and post them to SharePoint 
Online. Office 365 users can then access the page and complete the form without having InfoPath 
installed. Figure 2-2 shows the Customize Form button, which becomes available when you create a 
list in SharePoint Online. (See Chapter 11 for details about how to easily create and use a SharePoint 
list and why you might want to.)
Figure 2-2  Add custom forms to SharePoint Online with InfoPath Forms Services in Plans E3 and E4.
Using Access services, you can publish an Access database as a SharePoint list. This gives you the 
ability to use features of Access to create forms, validate inputs, and perform calculations, and still 
have the data stored in SharePoint Online, where it is accessible to all. 
Add in Excel and BCS services and you have a platform that can be customized to integrate with 
Office in very precise ways to suit your requirements. The boundaries of what is possible are limited 
more by your imagination than by the technology.
One key difference between Plans E3 and E4 is that Plan E4 includes a license to deploy Lync Server 
2010 on premises. Lync Server 2010 extends the capabilities of Lync Online so that you can make 

24   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
phone calls and provide other services. Installing Lync Server 2010 with Lync Online and integrating 
with the proper on-premises telephony equipment is a task best suited for specialists in the Unified 
Messaging field, as it is called. As a result, this plan is usually of interest only to larger companies. 
For small businesses, the biggest news about Plans E3 and E4 is that Office Professional Plus is 
included in the price. 
Office Professional Plus
Office Professional Plus is a subscription to the best version of Microsoft Office. The subscription 
is included in the price of Plans E3 and E4 and is available as an add-on for all other subscriptions, 
including Plan P1. This version has all the bells and whistles, including Microsoft Access and Microsoft 
Publisher (which is great for newsletters and brochures) and is available only through volume licens-
ing. You can’t walk down to your local office supply store and buy this version of Office. The closest 
commercial equivalent is Microsoft Office Professional, which retails for $499 for one user on two PCs 
or $349 for one PC on the Microsoft site. 
Many small businesses would like to use the latest version of Office, but the up-front costs of buy-
ing the software for all the systems can be daunting. Should you buy a version of Microsoft Office 
outright or pay a monthly subscription fee for Microsoft Office Professional Plus? This question is 
especially pressing for current users of Microsoft Office 2003 because Office 365 does not work with 
Office 2003. You must upgrade, but to what? 
Many small businesses don’t need the full Office suite and find that Office 2010 Home and Busi-
ness ($279.99 for one user on two PCs or $199.99 for one PC.) is sufficient. However, this version does 
not include Microsoft Publisher or Microsoft Access and is limited to installation on two PCs per user. 
Office Professional Plus allows you to install the same software (plus Publisher, Access, SharePoint 
Workspace, InfoPath, and Lync 2010) on up to five systems per user. To determine whether purchasing 
or subscribing is the better deal, let’s do a little analysis of the costs.
Suppose that you purchase Office Home and Business for $279 per person, plus Plan P1. The cost 
per user in the first year is $351 ($279 + 12 months* $6). However, in the second year, your cost is only 
the price of Plan P1. The cost per seat for two years of operation is $17.63 per month, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.

	
  Office Professional Plus    25
Figure 2-3  Plan P1 with Microsoft 2010 Home and Business—costs after 24 months.
But what if instead you bought an Office Professional Plus subscription for $12 per user per month 
and added it to your P1 subscription? As you can see in Figure 2-4, the costs are just about the same. 
Given these assumptions, the Professional Plus subscription is a clear win because you get the latest 
version of Office for all your users, it allows five PCs per user, and when the next release comes along, 
you have no additional expense.
Figure 2-4  Plan P1 with Office Professional Plus subscription.
If you extend this exercise out another year, the cost of buying your own software becomes less 
expensive because you make use of your investment in Office 2010 for three full years. But when the 
next version of Office comes along, you will be looking at the same decision again regarding capital 
outlay. If you have the Pro Plus subscription, you can just automatically upgrade. So when looking at 
Plan P1, in many cases, the Professional Plus subscription makes good sense.
The only other way to get Professional Plus is with Plans E3 and E4 or through Open Licensing, 
which requires a minimum of five users. Is it worth upgrading from P1 to E3 simply to gain the Office 
Pro Plus subscription? Take a look at the analysis in Figure 2-5. 

26   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 2-5  The costs for Plan E3. 
In effect, Plan E3 costs only $2 more per user than the P1 with the Microsoft Office Pro Plus 
subscription added. Considering Plan E3 also comes with support, growth potential, and additional 
SharePoint Online capabilities, it is worth considering. 
In the end, your decision will come down to carefully considering the needs of your business. 
While you deliberate, keep one more important factor in mind: if your subscription includes rights to 
Office Professional Plus, you’re paying month to month for the right to use Microsoft Office, rather 
than buying software outright. If you cancel your Office Professional Plus subscription, you lose the 
rights to use the Microsoft Office software installed from the service. Although there is a generous 
grace period, you eventually need to uninstall Office and reinstall a different version. If you buy the 
software, you can use it for as long as you like. 
The K Plans
Just to add a bit more to the alphabet soup of Office 365 Plans, Microsoft offers K, or kiosk, plans 
for specialized scenarios. For example, a factory floor where several people share a single computer 
would be a good candidate for a K plan. Another example might be a retail store chain where various 
shifts use a common PC at the counter. In cases like these, each user needs to access email and open 
Office documents from a web browser but does not have an individual instance of Office to use.
Plan K1 is only $4 per month and includes the following:
■
■
500 MB mailbox 
■
■
Outlook Web Apps to manage email from a browser
■
■
View-only access to SharePoint Online sites 
Plan K2 is $8 a month and includes Plan K1, plus read and write capabilities with Office Web Apps.

	
  Scenarios That Are Not a Good Fit    27
Note  You cannot buy Plan P1 and then add K plans to your order. That is, if you want some 
users to have a K plan and others to be on a different Office 365 plan and have all those 
users in the same Office 365 account, you must buy an E plan rather than Plan P1.
Stand-Alone Services
While most small businesses and professionals will likely want to buy a bundled version of 
Office 365, you can buy just a single service. Briefly, if you want email and nothing else, you can 
buy the Exchange Online stand-alone plan 1 for $5. Of course, because you can add SharePoint 
Online and Lync Online for $1 under Plan P1, it’s not worth considering for most small businesses. 
It might seem odd, but the SharePoint Online plan (plan 2 at $10.25), when purchased by itself, 
costs more than Plan P1 at $6 and has comparable features. See http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/
office365/buy-office-professional-plus.aspx#fbid=278FkQitXzW for more information about the 
stand-alone and K services.
Scenarios That Are Not a Good Fit
Office 365 has several services, any one of which could be a big help to a small business. However, a 
few specific business uses are not good fits for Microsoft Online Services. 
Mass Email Companies
If your business needs to send a large number of emails, you should look carefully at the throttles 
built into Exchange Online to prevent overconsumption of resources. Office 365 has instrumentation 
that can kick in to constrain mail delivery to maximums of: 
■
■
500 recipients per message.
■
■
1,500 recipients per user, per day.
■
■
30 messages per minute, per user.
The key trigger is when a lot of mail comes from or to one account. If any individual email account 
sends email to more than 1,500 users in one day, it’s possible that something is going on besides nor-
mal email use. Exchange Online is not designed to be a delivery engine for mass email marketing. 
If you have a newsletter or other communication that goes out to many users, no worries. You can 
create a distribution list in Exchange Online and add the receivers to the list. When you send an email 
to the distribution list, all users will receive the mail but it counts as only one recipient to Exchange 
Online.

Businesses with Slow or Unreliable Internet Connections
When you move to cloud services, you should have a reliable and fast Internet connection. If you are 
in an area where connection is spotty or you have a significant lag in your connection to the Micro-
soft Online data centers, you might want to acquire a better connection service before moving to the 
cloud.
More Info  You can test your connection speed to Microsoft Online at http://speedtest.
microsoftonline.com.
Specific Compliance and Security Requirements
One of the facts of life about moving to cloud services is that you have to rely on the provider to take 
care of security. Microsoft data centers are multimillion dollar operations that are third-party certified 
to meet or exceed industry standards. You can review the security policies and practices by searching 
online for “Security Features in Microsoft Online Services.”
The point is that, even though Microsoft has specific security practices, you might have legal 
requirements beyond or different from what Microsoft provides. For example, if you work on content 
that is confidential and requires encryption when at rest on an email server, Office 365 does not pro-
vide that capability. These are technical considerations that are beyond the scope of this book. In any 
event, if you have compliance or security concerns, consider hiring a Microsoft Partner for assistance. 
Significant Investments in Third-Party or Custom Software for 
On-Premises Servers
There is a very active market for products that enhance the capabilities of Exchange and SharePoint 
servers. Other than for applications built to run in the new SharePoint Online Sandbox, Microsoft 
does not allow third-party software to run in its data centers. Consequently, if you have on-premises 
servers and have invested in custom or third-party software, you cannot integrate it into Microsoft’s 
cloud. This is another situation in which you should hire a Microsoft Partner and consult with the soft-
ware vendor to assist you. They can evaluate your current software integrations and make suggestions 
appropriate to your business. 
Work with Large or Non-Office Files
Some businesses work with very large files or file types not well-suited to being managed by Office 
365. SharePoint Online allows files that are 250 MB each, but at that size you could quickly reach your 
SharePoint Online capacity. As stated earlier, you cannot buy additional capacity in Plan P1. Even if 

	
  For More Information    29
you could, working with large files in the cloud might or might not be a good idea, depending on 
your bandwidth, Internet reliability, and how frequently you need to update or modify the files. Firms 
that create large media files or create large CAD/CAM files as a part of their business would fall into 
this category. These types of firms will likely find that managing large files over the Internet is too 
slow. 
Another case arises when you plan to use Office 365 to work with files that are not well-suited for 
SharePoint Online. For example, you cannot store executable files on SharePoint Online, so software 
developers cannot store their applications or works in progress by using Office 365. Of course, this 
is related to file management only for which an on-premises server might still be needed, but in this 
scenario you could easily use Office 365 for mail, messaging, and other purposes. Many small busi-
nesses are taking advantage the best of both online and on-premises services.
For More Information
As you consider which Office 365 plan is right for your business, remember that plans and pricing 
details are subject to change. To find the latest information, browse to http://office365.com. For details 
about each individual service, read the service descriptions. The easiest way to find them is to search 
for “Office 365 Service Descriptions.” If you already know that Plan P1 is right for you, turn to Chapter 
3, “Signing Up for the Office 365 P1 Plan.”

C h a p t e r  3
Signing Up for the Office 365 
P1 Plan
S
igning up for Microsoft Office 365 is straightforward and intuitive. Simply provide some basic 
information, such as your name, address, and email, and get started! While the process is easy, you 
will need to know some important details. This chapter walks you through the process from signing 
up for a free trial of Office 365 to purchasing your subscription, and points out key issues along the 
way.
The Free Trial
Your Office 365 subscription can begin with a free 30-day trial. A trial account offers almost all of the 
same features as a paid account and is delivered identically. The trial account is provisioned with 10 
licenses, which you can increase or decrease when you convert the trial to a paid subscription. 
Of course, the problem with trials is that they expire. If you find that your trial is ending and you 
need to download your email and data, no worries. Microsoft offers a generous grace period at 
the end of the trial, during which you can continue to use your services. While the grace period can 
change without notice, 30 days has been the standard policy. After this period, you can log on but 
cannot access the services. In this way, you can manage passwords and users, or you can buy the 
service, for example, but not send and receive emails. When you log on to the administration portal, 
Microsoft notifies you about the number of days left in your trial period, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
In addition, you will receive email alerts sent to the email address you provide during the sign up 
process.
Note  When you sign up for a trial, add a reminder to your calendar one week before the 
expiration date. This will prompt you to either make the purchase or download your data.
Figure 3-1  The trial account expiration notice at the top of the Office 365 portal.

32   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Sign Up for the Trial
To sign up for a trial subscription to Office 365, browse to http://office365.com. On the main page, 
click the button to launch the trial sign-up. The specific language and landing page on Office365.com 
change from time to time. As of this writing, you should see a Free Trial button and a Buy Now but-
ton. They initiate, essentially, the same process except that in the Buy Now process you provide a 
payment method and agree to terms. 
Step 1: Complete the Sign Up Page
As shown in Figure 3-2, the first form you encounter is more complex than it appears. Begin by des-
ignating your country or region from the drop-down list. Note the warning “Can’t Be Changed After 
Sign-Up” with the hyperlink “Why?” next to it. Click Why? to see the explanation, which is shown in 
Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-2  Office 365 for professionals and small businesses trial sign-up page.

	
Sign Up for the Trial    33
Figure 3-3  The explanation as to why location cannot be changed.
Country and Organizational Language
When you specify a country or region, Microsoft sets the data center that is best suited to host your 
data. Microsoft makes this determination for you. You cannot elect to have your account in a data 
center other than the one Microsoft selects, and once set, it cannot be changed. For most businesses, 
this is not likely to be an issue. However, if you are in a country that restricts where your business data 
is stored, be advised that Microsoft does not guarantee that your data will stay in the “home” data 
center. 
Office 365 is designed to work for multinational companies, so it’s not a problem to have work-
ers who reside in different countries using the same account. It’s up to you to ensure that using the 
services complies with the rules and regulations of the worker’s home country. 
The only other impact that might affect you is that the features of Microsoft Lync Online can vary 
depending on the country you choose. See http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/licensing-
restrictions.aspx for details about licensing restrictions.
Related to your Country setting, the Organization Language setting determines the default lan-
guage for the sign-up process and the Office 365 portal and for other websites you will access related 
to Office 365.
Name and Organization
The First Name, Last Name, and Organization fields are self-explanatory. These are used for billing 
and identification purposes. If you need to identify yourself to Microsoft to discuss billing or other 
issues, these are the names it will refer to in validating ownership of the account.
Special Purpose of the Sign-Up Email Address
The email address you provide is far more important than you might think. This address will receive 
essential notices about billing issues. It is used whenever Microsoft needs to identify you as the owner 
of this account. If you do not monitor this account, you will not see notifications about billing and 
service upgrades. Some users have entered an unmonitored account for this address and have had 

34   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
problems with their billing, not realizing it until their account was nearly suspended. If you find your-
self in this situation, you do not need to worry that you will be disconnected from your data and your 
email deleted at the first opportunity. Microsoft makes it easy for you to continue using the services 
while issues like these are resolved with the 30 day grace period.
The key point is to use an email address that you check regularly.
Your Base Domain and the New Domain Name Setting
The New Domain Name field is vital. Your Office 365 login credentials are unique and can be issued 
to you immediately. For these reasons, during the sign-up process, Office 365 creates a base domain 
name for you and also a user account assigned to that base domain name. The entry you make in this 
field creates a unique, permanent domain name for your Office 365 account. It will look something 
like the following: yourcompanyname.onmicrosoft.com. 
Of course, you probably would prefer to use your own domain name rather than an onmicrosoft.
com domain. You can add a custom domain name to the account after you have purchased service. 
We will cover this process in Chapter 6, “Working with Custom Domains.” 
What Is a Domain? 
A domain is the .com part of an email address or website. For example, if you are sending an email to 
andyr@fabrikam.com, fabrikam.com is the domain. Domains can have other extensions beyond .com, 
such as .gov, .net, or .org. 
The first part of a domain name can be a company name or any phrase you choose, as long as it 
is still available for registration. You can find many domain name registration services where you can 
buy a domain name. Typically, a small business will want to purchase a domain name that customers 
can easily remember and that represents the company or brand. When you own the domain name, 
you can use it with your website or email services. 
Domain names are unique, like phone numbers. When you type in a website address like www.
microsoft.com, your computer automatically searches out a unique number called an IP address that 
is associated with the domain. The IP address is, in effect, the Internet’s version of a phone number. 
All of this happens out of sight for the user, using an Internet protocol called DNS (domain name 
services). 
In the New Domain Name field, enter the name you want to use for the part of your email address 
after the @ symbol.  Typically, you’ll want to enter a version of your company name in this field. For 
example, if your company is Fabrikam Books, you would enter FabrikamBooks with no spaces. Domain 
names cannot have spaces. Do not enter the .com or .net part of the domain name you plan to add 
later. While entering your company name in this field is common, you’re not required to do so. Enter 
anything you like, but remember that it cannot be changed.  

	
Sign Up for the Trial    35
After entering the domain name you want to use, click Check Availability. If your entry is unique, 
you will see a notification stating that your domain is available. If your domain name is not available, 
you will see a message that says the domain is not available and to try again. After your domain name 
is accepted, several new fields will appear, as shown in Figure 3-4. 
Figure 3-4  Completing the Sign Up form.
Your First Account Name
In the New Microsoft Online Services ID field, enter the name of the first account to be created. This 
account will be a service administrator account. The name you enter will be your logon name and 
email address for your first Office 365 account. Typically, people enter their first name or first name 
and last initial.
If you have a small business, employ a consistent pattern for user names. Establish a formula for 
user name creation with your business, and stick to it. As you add users, you can easily ensure conti-
nuity in your address list. This also helps customers identify individual email addresses. If they know 
Joe’s email address at the company is Joe@fabrikam.com, it is likely that the email address for Sanjay, 
at the same company, is Sanjay@fabrikam.com. 
Larger companies often use more than just a first name because it’s likely that more than one 
person will have the same first name. 

36   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Create a Password
The Create New Password field requires you to create a password between 8 and 16 characters. The 
password must contain three of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and 
symbols. The password strength indicator tells you when the password is evaluated as a strong pass-
word, which is mandatory. Do not forget this password. 
Important  Do not forget your initial password; it cannot be recovered. You will have to 
contact Microsoft to have your password reset if you find yourself unable to log on.
Prove You Are Not a Machine
In the Verification field, enter the characters you see in the graphic above the box. This technique is 
used to ensure that a human being is completing the form, not an automated system. If you cannot 
read the characters in the graphic, click the arrow next to the graphic to refresh the characters. If visu-
ally impaired, you can click the speaker button and then complete an audio challenge.
Accept the Terms 
Next you will be asked if you want to receive offers from Microsoft Partners. By doing so, you can 
receive useful offers from Office 365 partners. Microsoft has one of the most sophisticated partner 
networks in the world. Partners in your area can assist you with advanced Office 365 capabilities, 
such as automating Microsoft Office to work in specialized ways with Microsoft SharePoint Online or 
providing training for your staff.
Before clicking the “I Accept And Continue” button, take a moment to review the Microsoft Online 
Services Agreement and Privacy Notice. 
Step 2: Sign In
Next, you will see the Signing In screen, as shown in Figure 3-5. While the account is being provi-
sioned, the Continue button remains gray.

When the button becomes enabled, click Continue to log on to Office 365. 
Step 3: Ensure Administrator Password Recovery
When you log on to the Office 365 portal for the first time, you are asked to add additional informa-
tion for your administrator account, as shown in Figure 3-6.
This is a very important step that you should not skip. If you provide a mobile phone number 
capable of receiving text messages and an alternate email address, you can use the self-service pass-
word reset feature built in to Office 365. This feature is available to administrators only, so by provid-
ing this information you can ensure that you always have access.

Notice that Admin is in bold at the top to indicate that you’re on the Admin page. On this page, 
you manage Office 365, including adding users, domains, and configuring your services. 
When you first arrive, your account might still be in the provisioning stage. In Figure 3-7, you can 
see that SharePoint Online is still being set up. This is common when you first log on, but it should 
resolve in a few minutes. 
When the account is completely provisioned, the SharePoint Online section changes to match 
Figure 3-8.

After a service is provisioned, you can start using it immediately. Just click the Outlook link at the 
top of the page to start sending and receiving mail from your provisioned email address, using the 
web-based Microsoft Outlook Web App.

Purchase the Service
You might opt to purchase Office 365 for professionals and small businesses rather than start with a 
trial. You can also elect to pay for the services at any time during the trial or during the grace period 
after the trial.
You have more than one entry point into the purchasing process. At the top of the screen shown in 
Figure 3-8, at the end of the expiration alert message, you can select Purchase Now. This takes you to 
the screen shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9  Customize your order.
Alternatively (also shown in Figure 3-8), if you click Purchase, in the left column under Subscrip-
tions, you will see the screen shown in Figure 3-10.

	
Purchase the Service    41
Figure 3-10  The Purchase Subscriptions page.
The Purchase Subscriptions page includes Microsoft Office 365 Plan P1 and Office Professional 
Plus. You might find it in your best interest to purchase Microsoft Office on a subscription basis, rather 
than paying for the costs out of pocket at all once. My personal preference is to keep up with the lat-
est software for products that I use extensively, and Microsoft Office is certainly in that category. 
Note  Office Professional Plus is entirely optional. You can use Office 2007 or simply access 
the services by using your browser. For more on the pros and cons of subscribing to Office 
Professional Plus, see Chapter 2, “Choosing an Office 365 Plan.”
Whichever screen you use, the remainder of the process is a standard shopping cart experience: 
you provide your billing address, review the service agreements, payment information, and confirm 
your order. When complete, you will see your default Office 365 Administrator page. The only differ-
ence is that now you will not see a warning showing the number of days until your trial expires at the 
top of the screen. In addition, after the purchase, you can provision a custom domain.

Next Steps
Chapter 4, “The Dual Purpose Office 365 Portal,” walks you through how to use the Office 365 Portal 
to access and manage your services. This sets the stage for validating a custom domain, after which 
you can create users and deploy desktops. However, at this point, you should not set up your desk-
tops for Office 365 until you have validated a custom domain. Even so, your services are now fully 
functional, even if not personalized, and you should feel free to explore.

C h a p t e r  4
The Dual Purpose Office 
365 Portal
Y
our landing zone upon arrival, the Microsoft Office 365 portal has two main functions: it serves as 
a home page for normal users, and as an administration portal for administrators. The portal even 
changes its appearance depending on the role of the person who signs in and the amount of time his 
account has existed. 
When users log on, they see the home page of the portal. Here, they can change their passwords; 
quickly access Microsoft Outlook Web App, Microsoft SharePoint Online, and other web-based services; 
download required software to set up their systems; and access online resources about Office 365.
When you log on to Office 365 as an administrator, you see the Admin page of the portal. The 
Admin page provides configuration settings for all the services, including links to the service admin-
istration portals themselves. For example, Microsoft Exchange Online and SharePoint Online have 
stand-alone administration capabilities that are connected to but separate from the Office 365 
administration portal. Lync Online configuration is limited to allowing external sharing, managing 
conference call service providers, and allowing users to transfer files and use voice and video. Finally, 
administrators can purchase new seats and manage billing through the portal.
In day-to-day operation, you will access the portal primarily to manage users and reset passwords. 
When traveling or using a computer other than your own, the portal provides a convenient way to 
find links for OWA and SharePoint Online. 
This chapter will walk you through the use of the portal both for administrators and for end users. 
As the service administrator, you need to know how to navigate the various options and be aware of 
some not-so-obvious configuration details. 
The Main Menu
The main navigation menu (see Figure 4-1) resides at the top of both versions of the portal (https://
portal.microsoftonline.com). From this menu, you can navigate to the various services at any time. The 
users see Home, Outlook, and Team Site options, whereas administrators see an additional Admin 
option, as well. The Home page is the landing page where users can find links and resources related 
to Office 365. The Outlook link takes you to Outlook Web App, not to Outlook installed on your 

44   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
computer. You can click Team Site to reach SharePoint Online. Administrators can reach their dedi-
cated page by clicking Admin. 
FIGURE 4-1 Office 365 P1 portal top-level menu.
The Home Page
When users log on to the portal, they see the Home page, as shown in Figure 4-2. Clicking the Home 
link in the main menu at the top of the screen will also bring you here. 
FIGURE 4-2 The Office 365 P1 Home page: user’s view.
From the Home page, users can launch or locate the following:
■
■
Outlook Web App
■
■
The Team site
■
■
Your website
■
■
Office Web Apps
■
■
Online help, resources, and community links

	
The Home Page    45
■
■
The user’s Office 365 profile page, which includes a password reset function
■
■
Software downloads for setting up their computers for Office 365 
If you are logged on as an administrator, the page looks slightly different from that of a normal 
user. As you can see in Figure 4-3, the Start Here tasks are different, and Admin appears in the main 
menu.
FIGURE 4-3 The Office 365 P1 Home Page: administrator’s view. 
The Home Page: First Use
The portal is the first place users go upon receiving a new account. As administrator, you should 
direct a new user to http://portal.microsoftonline.com so that he can log on with his new user name 
and the temporary password provided when you created his account. The user must change his tem-
porary password to a new unique password for personal use before he can use the services. Office 
365 then logs him on to the portal and greets him with the normal user view. Creating and managing 
users is covered in Chapter 5, “Working with User Accounts.” The Start Here workflow instructs the 
user to set up his computer. Clicking Set Up Now in Step 1 allows him to download and install the 
Office 365 Setup client and Lync 2010. By the way, resist the temptation to set up your desktop until 
you’ve read Chapter 6, “Working with Custom Domains,” and Chapter 7, “Desktop Setup and Migra-
tion,” which discuss working with custom domains and preparing your desktop.
After initial setup is complete, users typically do not return to this portal frequently. Email is usu-
ally accessed from Outlook, which logs on to Office 365 automatically. The Lync 2010 client will also 

46   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
log on to Lync Online automatically when started. As a user, if you set your SharePoint Team Site in 
a favorite’s link in your browser, you can browse directly to SharePoint Online, as well. You might be 
prompted to authenticate for SharePoint Online, depending on a number of factors, such as how 
long it has been since you last logged on with a web browser to Office 365 or SharePoint Online. In 
addition, when you open a Microsoft Office document that is hosted on SharePoint Online, you do 
not need to be logged on to the Office 365 Portal. However, you might be prompted by SharePoint 
Online to authenticate. 
Authentication and Office 365
When you start Outlook, it automatically logs on to Exchange Online. Similarly, the Lync 2010 
client logs you on to Lync Online. If you then browse to SharePoint Online, you might be asked 
to authenticate. Because Outlook and Lync already logged you on, why are you being asked to 
authenticate to SharePoint Online?
When Outlook logs you on to Exchange Online and Lync 2010 logs you on to Lync Online, 
you are logged on to those services specifically, rather than Office 365, generally. As a result, 
when your browser opens SharePoint Online, SharePoint Online might ask to see whether you 
are authorized to access the requested resource, even though you are already logged on to 
other Office 365 services. SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Lync Online are essentially 
different services connected by a common infrastructure. Despite this, in practice you’ll en-
counter much less authentication than you might expect. 
The Home Page: On the Road
The portal is also quite handy when traveling. If your laptop isn’t available, you can log on to the 
portal to start Outlook Web Access or SharePoint Online on a trusted PC. As always, be careful about 
entering logon credentials on public systems. Using the web browser, you can instant message your 
colleagues within OWA, review documents hosted on SharePoint Online directly in the browser, send 
email, create meetings, view other people’s calendars, and more. You’d be surprised how much you 
and your team members can do from just a web browser on any PC when using Office 365.
The Office 365 Portal Profile
Another feature of the portal is the ability to configure an Office 365 profile. This profile is more 
important than you might initially think because it provides a way for each user to personalize the 
services. For example, you can add a photo to the portal profile, and it will appear in Lync 2010! There 
are some other surprises, as well. When you click Profile in the upper-right corner of the screen, you’ll 
see the My Profile page shown in Figure 4-4.

	
The Home Page    47
FIGURE 4-4 The Office 365 portal My Profile page.
Let’s take a look at the My Profile page from the top down.
Change Password
Next to the My Profile heading is a link to change your password. This important link provides one of 
the few ways for users to initiate a password change. Users can also change their Office 365 pass-
word in Outlook Web App. Keep in mind that to change your password with this method, you must 
know your current password. Use this feature if you have reason to believe your password has been 
compromised. 

48   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Change Photo
The blue picture icon is a placeholder for a photo of the user. Office 365 makes good use of this 
photo, so you or your coworkers can add a picture to each profile as part of the user setup. Both the 
Lync Server 2010 client and SharePoint Online use the photo, and Microsoft has plans to integrate this 
picture into Exchange Online, as well. In a small business, most of the workers know each other, but a 
photo can be quite helpful for new hires, and it adds an appealing personal touch to the services (see 
Figure 4-5).
To add a picture, just click the photo icon and browse to a .jpg, .gif, .bmp, or .png file that is less 
than 100 KB in size. Click Upload, and then click Save. 
FIGURE 4-5 A profile page with photo.
Information, Display Language, and Contact Preferences
The Information details are display only. The user’s office number, address, phone, email, and fax 
number are shown as they were entered when the user account was created. In this example, if a col-
league looks up Chris Gray‘s contact information in Outlook, Outlook Web App, or Lync Online 2010, 
she will find the same information listed here. This makes it easy to find someone’s office number or 
mobile phone number when needed. 
Use the Display Language drop-down menu to set the language you prefer for the Office 365 
portal. 
The Contact Preferences settings determine how and if Microsoft can contact you about the ser-
vices and other offerings. 

	
The Office 365 Admin Portal    49
The Office 365 Admin Portal
When you or another user designated as an administrator log on to the Office 365 portal, you can 
view the Admin version of the portal, shown in Figure 4-6.
FIGURE 4-6 The Office 365 Plan P1 Admin Overview page.
Don’t worry if your page looks different from Figure 4-6; Microsoft changes the websites from 
time to time. In addition, specific content such as the “Welcome to Office 365” section on the lower 
right and the “Get your team started” section will change after you’ve had the services for a while. 
(See the upcoming sidebar for more information.)
From the Admin page, you can add users, add a custom domain, manage each service, configure 
your public website, access help, manage licenses, and more. 
Microsoft designed the Office 365 small business offering for businesses that do not have IT 
administrators on staff. For the most part, you do not need much technical expertise to configure 
and use Office 365. Although each of the services has many features, not all of them are applicable to 
your business. By the end of this book, you will be comfortable configuring and managing the most 
popular and useful features of Office 365 for small businesses.
The best way to become familiar with the admin controls is to tour the portal’s important links. 
Start in the left column titled Admin Overview, which has three main sections: Management, Sub-
scriptions, and Support.

Online Services Are Frequently Updated
Within the halls of Microsoft, the rhythm of releasing software and using service packs to pro-
vide updates and new features has been part of the culture for decades. This kind of a process 
works well for large-scale operations like Microsoft’s, where each release has to be extensively 
tested, inspected by security experts, translated into many languages, packaged by installers, 
and distributed worldwide in a variety of formats. However, it makes it difficult for a specific 
team to release new features or updates to a product, because any individual update, gener-
ally, has to be folded into the release cycle of service packs. 
With the advent of Online Services, this old model is completely undone. Now, Microsoft 
can release updates in a compressed time frame. With the Business Productivity Online Suite 
(BPOS), the predecessor to Office 365, updates were routinely posted almost on a monthly 
basis. By the time BPOS was replaced with Office 365, dozens of significant changes had been 
added to the BPOS service without price increases, and there were no service packs to install.
Similarly, Microsoft has continually released new features and capabilities over the life of Office 
365. By the time this book is published, Office 365 will have several features that were not avail-
able when it first released. For example, Microsoft might change the appearance of specific 
screens and add new features. During the process of collaborating with Microsoft on this book, 
the company even made an internal decision to accelerate the release of planned features. This 
brings more value to customers for the same price and shows that Microsoft is committed to 
improving its online services more frequently than you might expect. The best place to keep 
up with the changes is at http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/office_365_service_updates/
service-updates-for-office-365-for-professionals-and-small-businesses.aspx.
Management
The Management section covers two important topics: Users and Domains.
When you click the Users link, you go to the page where you can add and manage users, as shown 
in Figure 4-7.
By adding a user, you give him the authority to log on to the portal. In the process, you can assign 
him a service license. This license is what you pay for with your service subscription, and assigning 
the license allows the user to access the services. Note that you can add users from other links in the 
portal, including the Add Users link under Get Your Team Started and the Add New Users link under 
Admin Shortcuts. (See Figure 4-6.)
Clicking the Domains link takes you to Domains page (see Figure 4-8) on which you can add your 
company’s domain to Office 365 so that you can use an email address like contoso.com, rather than 
contoso.onmicrosoft.com. 

	
The Office 365 Admin Portal    51
FIGURE 4-7 User administration.
FIGURE 4-8 The Domains page.

52   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Adding a domain to Office 365 is probably the most technically challenging part of configuring 
your service because it involves DNS (domain name services) settings. DNS controls traffic on the 
Internet, and making changes to these settings will impact where your Web and email traffic are sent. 
As a result, it’s important to work with some care. To prepare for this, ensure that you know who your 
DNS provider is and that you can log on to their management console. Chapter 6 goes into detail 
about working with custom domains.
Subscriptions
This section has three major topics: Manage, Licenses, and Purchase. You will be using each of these 
sections to add new users, assign licensing if needed, or convert a trial to a paid account. Take a look.
Manage
Clicking the Manage link takes you to a page titled Billing and Subscription Management (Figure 4-9). 
Here you can see your subscriptions, the number of users, costs, and expiration or renewal dates. 
FIGURE 4-9 The Billing And Subscription Management page.
You will always have at least one entry on this page: your subscription to Office 365. If you pur-
chased Office Pro Plus with your service, that will also be listed.
When you click on a subscription, you see Subscription details, such as for Plan P1 shown in Figure 
4-10. Note that the screens are different if you are using a trial account or a paid account.

Use the Subscription Details page to:

Add a Microsoft Partner to your account.
If you click the Add link under the Partner Information heading to the right, you can associate your 
account with a Microsoft Partner (Figure 4-11). 
FIGURE 4-11 Adding a Partner. 

54   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Why would you want to associate your account with a Microsoft Partner? Microsoft Partners are 
actively selling Office 365 with ongoing support, training, management, customizations, and other 
services for their customers. If you have been working with a Microsoft Partner in relationship with 
Office 365 but no Partner ID is present, ask the Partner for their Microsoft Partner ID, and then add 
them here. You can find an Office 365 Partner by using http://pinpoint.microsoft.com. 
Associating your account with a Partner is completely optional. Microsoft expects that most Plan 
P1 accounts will not be associated with Partners because the technical needs of very small businesses 
are generally far less complex than businesses of 100 or more employees. Although most small busi-
nesses have simple IT requirements, many have complex needs that include custom coding, special-
ized network devices, security considerations, and more. If this sounds like your company, you might 
want to engage the services of Microsoft Partner specializing in Office 365. Adding a Partner ID to 
your account, in and of itself, does not obligate a Partner to provide support or consulting services.
Assigning a Partner to your account has no impact on your costs and does not change the services 
you receive. You can find an Office 365 Partner by going to http://pinpoint.microsoft.com. 
Licenses
The Licenses page shows the number of licenses you have in your subscription and how many are 
assigned. There are no adjustable entries. This page is strictly informational.
Purchase
The Purchase Subscriptions page is where you can convert a trial account to a paid account by using 
the process described in Chapter 3, “Signing Up for the Office 365 P1 Plan.” The Purchase Subscrip-
tions page also lets you add new users and purchase Office Professional Plus. 
Support 
As noted, the P1 subscription does not come with phone or ticketed support using the administration 
portal. Even so, you’ll find some important links on the Support Overview page, as shown in Figure 4-12. 
Although Microsoft does not allow Plan P1 subscribers to directly contact technical support, 
they do have paid staff who answer support and subscription-billing questions from the commu-
nity forums. You can access the community site by clicking Get Support From The Microsoft Online 
Community or browsing to http://community.office365.com. In addition, the forums are monitored 
by a quite a few other individuals in Microsoft, including program managers for the various services, 
Microsoft consulting staff, MVPs, and other experts. The Help And Community search box is a link to 
the community forums. You can often find out information about Office 365 in the forums before it 
finds its way into online help or other official documentation. 

	
The Office 365 Admin Portal    55
FIGURE 4-12 The Support Overview page.
In practice, some issues can be handled by Microsoft only, such as if you lock out your only 
administrator account and cannot log on. Microsoft has a self-service password reset ability for 
administrators, but you have to have a valid alternate email address and mobile phone number with 
text messaging enabled for this to work. If you don’t have an alternate, your only choice is to contact 
support. Microsoft support will help in these and other circumstances for which support services are 
required. 
Another alternative is the Quick Solutions section, which contains links to a few “how-to” articles 
that address the most common calls to technical support. One of the more interesting links is the 
Virtual Agent For Microsoft Office 365; click it to reach the page shown in Figure 4-13. 

56   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
FIGURE 4-13 Virtual Agent for Office 365.
The Virtual Agent is an automated query response system. You ask a question, and it returns an 
answer with links to selected topics, based on your query. Be advised, however, that the answers 
provided by the agent are not scoped to issues related specifically to the Plan P1 service. For example, 
if you ask “How do I create a site in SharePoint Online?”, you will get multiple topics in the response, 
including “Creating and Managing Site Collections,” despite the fact that you cannot create site col-
lections with Plan P1. Use the Virtual Agent, but with some awareness that it is a limited tool.
Note  One useful feature of the Virtual Agent is that it can provide phone numbers for 
Microsoft Online Support in any country. Just ask!
The Troubleshooting Tool
Unlike the Virtual Agent, Microsoft’s Troubleshooting tool (see Figure 4-14) does differenti-
ate between Plan P1 and the E plans. You are presented with a series of choices on pages 1 
through 5, resulting in a list of links and resources related to your problem. You can find this 
tool at http://community.office365.com/en-us/p/troubleshooting.aspx.

	
The Office 365 Admin Portal    57
FIGURE 4-14 The Troubleshooting tool.
If you think you’ll need more help than the forums and Virtual Agent can provide, another option 
is connecting with a good Office 365 Partner. If your service is managed by a Microsoft Partner, 
you can use the Manage Your Delegated Administrators link to authorize the partner as a delegated 
administrator, which allows the partner to log on to your Office 365 account as an administrator. In 
this way, the partner can remotely add users, reset passwords, configure your SharePoint Online sites, 
and manage your email settings. Not all partners offer these services. See http://pinpoint.microsoft.com 
to locate a partner in your region.
Finally, the Billing Service Requests Summary section of the Overview page details any open ser-
vice requests related to billing. As it turns out, you can also actually file a service request by using the 
Service Requests option on the left of the screen, but it must be related to billing. 
Service Requests
Click the Service Request link under Support to ask billing-related questions of the support staff. 
When you create a service request, the tracking information shown under Billing Service Requests 
Summary is updated. 
When Microsoft replies to your request, the Action Required counter goes up. In this way, you can 
quickly see whether any open issues need your attention.

58   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Service Health
Click the Service Health link under Support to access the Service Health page (see Figure 4-15). Ser-
vice Health is one of the most important screens in the Admin portal. Here, you can monitor current 
and past service issues with Office 365. If you are experiencing problems, you should go here to see 
whether there is an issue with Office 365 itself. 
FIGURE 4-15 The Service Health page.
Notice the blue triangle next to most of the services. Click a downward-pointing triangle to expand 
a listing of details about the related service. In Figure 4-15, the Exchange Online section is expanded 
to show additional information; you can click its upward pointing triangle to close the detailed list.
If an issue is listed, you can click the icon to reveal further details. Microsoft attempts to report any 
issues to this page as soon as possible.
In the upper-right corner is an RSS icon. Click this link to subscribe to the service health RSS feed. 
Using RSS, you can receive notifications of service-related issues by using Outlook, a web browser, or 
other RSS reader.
Planned Maintenance
Infrequently, service availability is impacted by service upgrades. Click the Planned Maintenance link 
under Support to access a list of upcoming and historical maintenance events. The Microsoft service 
license agreement promises a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee, but that does not include scheduled 
downtime, which Microsoft defines as follows:

	
The Office 365 Admin Portal    59
…those times when we publish or notify you of periods of Downtime related to 
network, hardware, or Service maintenance or upgrades at least five (5) days prior 
to the commencement of such Downtime.1
The planned maintenance list constitutes notification for these purposes. You should check this list 
if you have a problem with the services. In addition, if you are planning on an important webcast or 
Lync Online session, check to see whether any updates to Lync Online are planned during your event.
Service Administration 
In addition to managing your Office 365 environment, such as users and domains, you can manage 
the services themselves from the main Admin Overview page, as shown earlier in Figure 4-6.
The Admin Overview section contains quick launch links to some common administrative tasks. 
These include resetting user passwords, adding new users, and assigning user licenses. You’ll learn 
more about these topics in Chapter 5.
The Exchange Online page contains two links: General Settings and Distribution Groups (see 
Figure 4-16). 
FIGURE 4-16 Outlook (Exchange Online) administration. 
Clicking either link takes you to the page shown in Figure 4-17.
FIGURE 4-17 Outlook General Setting (Exchange Online Adminstration).

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
The page looks different from the Office 356 administration portal because you’ve been switched 
into the administrator section of Outlook Web App, where you can also manage Exchange Online. 
The Office 365 administration portal simply provides a link to this location. In other words, to manage 
your mail settings, you can log on to OWA or to the Office 365 Portal, which will take you to OWA. 
Because service administration for mail services happens in OWA and not the Office 365 portal, 
Exchange Online administration is covered in Chapter 8, “Working with Outlook Web Access.” For 
now, just keep a couple of details in mind about these pages. Not all the features you see are avail-
able in Plan P1. For example, Plan P1 does support user roles. Additionally, advanced features are 
available to you, such as journaling and audit reports, but these are generally beyond the scope of 
small businesses. Chapter 8 will review the key features you need to know about as well as provide 
some tips along the way. 
Note  In Figure 4-17, notice that the mailbox page allows you to add a new mailbox. This is 
the same as adding a user in Office 365. Here is one area where the Outlook administration 
page has a feature that is also in the Office 365 portal. I would suggest that you do not use 
the New mailbox feature to create a mailbox; instead, add it in the Office 365 portal as dis-
cussed in Chapter 6.
Lync 
When you click the General Settings link under Lync, you are taken to the Lync Online control panel. 
Unlike SharePoint Online and Exchange Online, Lync Online is administered in the Office 365 portal. 
The Lync Online control panel has only a few configurable settings. Most options that can be enabled 
are enabled by default. Lync Online administration is covered in Chapter 12, “Working With Lync 
Online.”
Team Sites and Documents 
Under the Team Sites and Documents heading, you can access your Team Site. The Team Site is a 
pre-built private website on which you and other team members can post notes and documents. The 
Team Site is very simple to use and works without additional configuration. You can, of course, add 
functionality, change the layout, theme, and add customizations. Chapter 11, “Working with Share-
Point Online,” reviews some very useful features of SharePoint Online that you can implement right 
away. 
Note  Click Team Site and then add the URL to your favorites. You can then go directly to the 
SharePoint site without having to log on to the Office 365 Portal.

	
Put the Portal to Work    61
Website
The final administrative section to discuss is simply called Website. This refers to the public website 
that is part of Plan P1. The public website capabilities are good for sites that provide information 
about the business, such as location, contact information, and other static details. Microsoft calls the 
public website a “basic” website, and you should take that description to heart. For instructions on 
configuring a public website, see Chapter 11.
Put the Portal to Work
You’ve seen how the Office 365 portal is used by administrators to configure the services, assist with 
troubleshooting, and manage licensing. Also, you’ve seen how users can launch OWA and SharePoint 
Online, update their profiles, and access downloads for setting up their desktops. In the next chapter, 
you’ll see how to create users who can access the portal and use the services.

Working with User Accounts
M
ost people don’t give user management much thought, but as the Microsoft Office 365 service 
manager, you have to. User management goes well beyond just enabling new user accounts for 
coworkers to access the services. In setting up Office 365, you must be strategic about when you cre-
ate user accounts. 
For example, if you validate your domain and direct mail to Office 365 before users are created, 
no mailboxes are available to receive mail. Or what if someone quits? How do you disable his logon 
without deleting his mail? If you delete him as a user, his mail is gone! What happens when someone 
can’t log on? The most common user management issue is the all-too-familiar phone call to reset a 
password. Microsoft has added a password reset function for administrators so that they can reset 
their password without a service call, but this feature is not available to end users, so you will get 
their calls. This chapter will help you work through these and other important details of adding and 
managing users.
Password Best Practices
Throughout this chapter, you will see a process that generates a temporary password for users when 
new accounts or new passwords are created. Be aware that this temporary password cannot be used 
to log on to Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Web App, Microsoft Lync 2010, or Microsoft SharePoint 
Online. The only place you can use the temporary password is the Office 365 portal. 
When a user logs in to the portal using the temporary password, she is immediately asked to 
change the temporary password on the account to a new, personal one that she creates. This ensures 
that no one but the user knows the password. If the user forgets her password, you must reset it for 
her, which generates a new temporary password. When this occurs, she cannot log on to the services 
until she goes to the Office 365 portal, enters the temporary password, and creates a new one.
As the service administrator, when you create accounts, you must communicate the temporary 
password to users and tell them to go to http://portal.onmicrosoft.com to create a new password. 
There they must enter their new password into Outlook and Lync 2010, when prompted. 
Finally, remember that passwords do not expire for users who are not administrators. However, 
administrators (that means you) have passwords that expire every 90 days. As a best practice, put a 
calendar entry in Outlook to change your password in advance of that date.

Add a New User
To add a user, log on to the Office 365 portal, using administrator credentials to reach the Admin 
page, which is shown in Figure 5-1. 
FIGURE 5-1 The Admin page. 
The Admin page contains two links that look useful: Users in the left column under Management, 
and Add New Users listed under Admin shortcuts. Which of these should you use? Clicking the Add 
New Users link takes you directly to the Add Users page, bypassing the User Management page. After 
you are familiar with the administrator portal, it’s fine to use the shortcut, but for now, click Users to 
get started. 
Before reaching the Users page, some readers will see the Just Checking screen shown in Figure 5-2. 
This is intended to help you create accounts that have custom domain names rather than onmicrosoft.
com names. If you select I Want These Accounts To Have Email Addresses Using A Domain I Already 
Own, Office 365 takes you out of the task of creating users and into the task of domain validation, 
which is covered in Chapter 6, “Working with Custom Domains.” I suggest that you create users 
before adding a custom domain because it can take some time and might require you to gather 
additional information before you can complete the process. You can easily change your users to use 
email addresses from your custom domain later. For now, if you see the Just Checking screen, choose 
the onmicrosoft.com addresses option, and then click Next to get on with creating user accounts.
If you do not have a custom domain, clicking Users on the Admin page takes you straight to the 
Users page shown in Figure 5-3. On the Users page, you can add, edit, and delete users, as well as 
reset passwords. You can also select multiple users and change them at the same time. Click New, and 
then click New User to reach the Details page. (You’ll learn about the Bulk Add Users option shortly.)

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Step 1: Details
Figure 5-4 illustrates that the Details page has two parts: Name and Additional Details.
FIGURE 5-4 Adding a new user: Details.
Name
The Name section includes fields for the user’s first and last names, as well as the required Display 
Name and User Name fields. The most important entry is user name, which is the logon name for the 
Office 365 portal and email address for the user. 
When assigning a user name, pay close attention to the domain name. If you have validated a 
custom domain, you can assign that domain to the user. Keep in mind that if you change the domain 
name for a user, his mailbox content does not change but he cannot log on with the previous user 
name. You’ll run into this problem only if you add a domain name to Office 365 after you have cre-
ated users and then change the user names to the new domain. As soon as you do that, Lync Online 
and Outlook will not log the user on until you update the user’s domain in Lync 2010 and Outlook.
Additional Details
To access the second part of the Details page (see Figure 5-5), click the Additional Details blue arrow. 

	
Add a New User    67
FIGURE 5-5 User Details showing Additional Details.
These details are used in two important ways. First, this information becomes available to others in 
your organization who use Office 365. Coworkers can view a person’s details in Outlook by using the 
Global Address List (GAL). Chapter 10, “Improving your Business Image and Productivity with Out-
look,” provides details on how to use the GAL, which can be very useful if you must reach someone by 
phone but don’t know the number. Second, the Mobile phone field has an important and not obvious 
role. Microsoft implemented a self-service password reset capability that can be initiated from the 
Office 365 logon screen. The last step of the procedure involves sending a text message to the admin-
istrator’s account mobile phone listed in this screen. If there is no entry, the reset feature does not 
work. This process is available only to administrators and is covered later in this chapter. After adding 
the additional details, click Next.

68   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Step 2: Settings
Figure 5-6 presents the Settings page, which has two parts: Assign Permissions and Set User Location.
FIGURE 5-6 The New User Settings page.
Assign Permissions
The Permissions setting determines whether the user is a normal user or service administrator. Choose 
Yes to assign a user administrator privileges. Now the user will see the Admin menu when he logs on 
to the portal and will have administrator rights in all the services. Only two types of users are in Plan 
P1: normal users and administrators. The E plan series gives you more granular control, meaning that 
you can give someone the right to reset his password without also granting him ability to delete or 
add users. You can change this setting at any time for an existing user. Nothing changes operationally 
for the user other than having access to administrative features.
The Alternate Email Address field appears only when the user is set as an administrator. This 
address is used as part of the password reset process, so ensure that it is a valid address and is not the 
same as your Office 365 account. 

	
Add a New User    69
Best Practice: Add a Free Second Administrator
When working with Office 365 users, you will need to change user settings from time to time, 
but what happens when you need to change your own user settings? There are a few settings 
you cannot make to your own account when logged on. The only way to make these changes 
is as an administrator, so you must have a second administrator account accessible with which 
you can make specific edits. Adding a second administrator account is a good idea because it 
solves the self-edit problem; just as importantly, if you forget your password, you can still log 
on as an administrator. 
But don’t you have to pay for the second admin account? No, you don’t. You can create the 
account and assign the administrator role but not assign any licenses. This creates a user who 
cannot access the services but who can log on to the service and change the password, add 
users, and otherwise manage settings in the Office 365 portal. Some companies do this so that 
a consultant or partner can manage Office 365 on their behalf without giving the rights to the 
service.
Set User Location
Office 365 is a global, Internet-based service. Even for small businesses, it’s not uncommon to have 
users in multiple countries. The rules and regulations that govern privacy, security, and access to 
personal information by government agencies vary from country to country. In addition, the laws 
governing voice and video carriers are different. In some cases, Lync Online is not allowed to carry 
voice data. As a result, Microsoft has to know the location of each user to offer only the services that 
are permitted for the region. 
The User Location setting does not change where a user’s information is located. If your company’s 
data is provisioned in the United States data center and you have users in other parts of the world, 
they will all connect to the United States data center regardless of the Location setting. Set the loca-
tion for the user, and then click Next to proceed.
Step 3: Assign Licenses
You use the Assign licenses form (see Figure 5-7) to specify which services a user can access. If you 
purchased Office Professional Plus, that is also listed. You do not have to assign all the licenses to 
everyone. By selectively assigning licenses, you have the option of giving some employees access to 
one service while denying access to others. Note that if you do this, you do not “free up” a license for 
another user. The three services are bundled as a unit, and you can use them all, if you like, but if you 
use just one, the other two are not available to be reassigned. 

70   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
FIGURE 5-7 Adding a new user, step 3: assign licenses.	
You also can create a user and not assign licenses at all. This technique can be used to create a 
backup administrator account without buying additional seats for your service.
It’s important to know that if you remove a Microsoft Exchange Online license, the mailbox is 
deleted, which means that the email in that mailbox is gone.
Step 4: Send Results in Email
The Send Results In Email form shown in Figure 5-8 allows you to enter up to five email addresses to 
receive the Results page that includes the user’s temporary password. Don’t forget that the user can-
not yet log on to her Office 365 account, so you need to use a different email address or other means 
of communication to give her the temporary password. Click Create to continue.

	
Add a New User    71
FIGURE 5-8 Setting up to send results in email.
Step 5: Results
The temporary password for the user appears on the Results page, as shown in Figure 5-9. An email 
containing the password is sent to each address that you provided in the Send Results In Email screen. 
FIGURE 5-9 The Results screen shows the temporary password. 

72   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Bulk Add Users
Most small businesses add one user at time. For businesses with more than 10 users, you can save 
time by using the Bulk Add feature. The process is simple. You just download a spreadsheet from the 
Admin portal, add all the user information, and upload it into the Bulk Add Wizard. If problems occur 
with the imported file, the wizard will tell you. When those are corrected, it generates the accounts 
and temporary passwords. The most common mistake is not providing the correct domain name in 
the spreadsheet. 
To access the Bulk Add Users feature, log on to the Admin portal, and then under Admin Overview, 
in the left column, click Users. From the Users page (refer to Figure 5-3), select New, and then click 
Bulk Add Users. 
Step 1: Select File
When adding information for multiple users, you must provide their information in a CSV file. To help 
you, the Select A CSV File page offers you the options of downloading a blank CSV file to use as a 
template or downloading a sample CSV file (Figure 5-10). A variety of applications, from simple text 
editors like Notepad to Microsoft Excel, read and write CSV files.
FIGURE 5-10 Bulk add users, step 1: select a CSV file. 

	
Bulk Add Users    73
Download the sample CSV file, and you’ll see a simple spreadsheet with 14 columns: user name, 
first name, last name, display name, job title, department, office number, office phone, mobile phone, 
fax, address, city, state or province, and country or region.
Note  The Country or Region field, while listed in the file, is not used. You designate the 
country or region specifically in step 3 of the build wizard, which is applied to all the up-
loaded users. As a result, all users you bulk upload in a spreadsheet should be in the same 
country or region. Alternatively, you can manually correct each entry after the accounts are 
created.
Complete the spreadsheet, adding your users and their information. The only required fields are 
Username and Display name. The user name is the Office 365 email address.
Important  Office 365 user names are represented as an email address, such as bob@
fabrikam.com. The domain used for the user name must match the one in your Office 365 
account. You can use the default domain assigned to you when you created your account, 
such as fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com (bob@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com), or a custom domain 
you add to the account (bob@fabrikam.com). If you do not assign a valid domain to the 
user name, the account will not be created.
Save the spreadsheet in Excel by selecting File, and then click Save As. Type in a file name; ensure 
that the file type is correctly listed as CSV. In my testing, the file type by default was TXT rather than 
CSV and needed to be changed. Click Next.
Step 2: Verification
The verification page inspects the file for errors (see Figure 5-11). If any problems occur with the file, 
this page reports the issues. This page is effective at spelling out what problems are encountered. 
Correct any issues, and then reload the file, if needed. When no more errors appear, click Next.

74   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
FIGURE 5-11 Bulk add users, Step 2: verification.
Step 3: Settings
As Figure 5-12 demonstrates, the Settings form for a group of users is similar to the Settings screen 
for adding a single user (refer to Figure 5-6). Instead of optionally setting a user to be an administra-
tor, here you can choose the sign-in status for created users. Generally, you will want the users to sign 
in, unless you are staging your deployment and want to prevent access until a specific time. Set the 
location, and then click Next.
Step 4: Licenses
In the Assign Licenses page depicted in Figure 5-13, indicate which licenses to assign to the users. 
Because you are bulk uploading, remember that the same setting will apply to all users. Click Next.

	
Bulk Add Users    75
FIGURE 5-12 Bulk add users, step 3: settings.
FIGURE 5-13 Bulk add users, step 4: licenses.

76   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Step 5: Email
Like the process for adding a single user, you can email yourself the temporary passwords when add-
ing multiple users, as shown in Figure 5-14. On the Results page that follows (Figure 5-15), you can 
see the unique passwords generated for each user. Click Create.
FIGURE 5-14 Bulk add users, step 5: send results in email.
Step 6: Results
The Results page lists the new users and their passwords. If you elected to email the results in step 
5, this information is included in the email. In any event, ensure that you have a record of the pass-
word. If a user forgets or misplaces a temporary password, you can reset the password for that user to 
regenerate another temporary password.

	
Reset Passwords    77
FIGURE 5-15 Bulk add users, step 6: results.
Problems are also reported, such as the one shown in Figure 5-15, indicating that you do not have 
enough licenses to create all the users. In this case, the solution is to buy another license. Then you 
can create the account individually. 
After the users are created, you can distribute the logon identities and passwords. 
Important  Users must change their passwords at https://portal.microsoftonline.com before 
they can log on to the services. After changing their password, the user is placed on the 
Office 365 portal Home page, where they can discover how to start the web-based services 
and access useful information about Office 365.
Reset Passwords
When a user is unable to log on because of a forgotten password, a password reset is required. For 
a non-administrative user, the process is simple but requires a service administrator. Administrators 
have a self-service password reset feature. In either case, the user receives a new temporary password, 
which he must change before he can use the services.

78   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
User Password Reset
To reset a user’s password, log on as an Office 365 administrator, and then under Admin Shortcuts, 
select Reset User Passwords. This takes you to the Users page; select the user, and then at the bottom 
of the user list, click Reset Password, as shown in Figure 5-16.
FIGURE 5-16 Select Reset Password at the bottom of the users listing.
From here, the process picks up at step 4 for adding a new user. You select where to send the tem-
porary password (do not use the email address of the locked out account) and view the results. 
Administrator Password Reset
An administrator can reset her own password, provided the user settings for her administrator 
account have correct information for the alternate email address and mobile phone fields.
The alternate email address is located on the user Settings page (refer to Figure 5-6), whereas the 
mobile phone number is located on the Details page, under Additional Details (refer to Figure 5-5). 
The mobile phone must be able to receive text messages. 
To begin the process, click Forgot Your Password? on the logon page for Office 365, as shown in 
Figure 5-17.
You are then asked whether you are an Office 365 administrator or end user. If you select end user, 
you’ll see a message that instructs you to contact the services administrator. If you select administra-
tor, you are asked to provide your logon user name and to solve a case-senstive visual challenge, as 
shown in Figure 5-18.

	
Reset Passwords    79
FIGURE 5-17 The Forgot Your Password? link on the sign-in portal.
FIGURE 5-18 Resetting your password: user verification.

80   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
After successful completion of this page, an email is sent to the alternate email address. You have 
10 minutes to reply by clicking on the provided link. When you do, you see the message shown in 
Figure 5-19, and you are asked enter the security code sent by text to your mobile phone number.
FIGURE 5-19 Resetting your password: mobile phone verification.
You have 10 minutes to enter the code before it expires. When you enter the code and click Next, 
you are taken to the password change screen in which you enter a new password.
Delete a User
Next to the Reset Password link on the Users page (Figure 5-16), you have the option to delete a user. 
Selecting a user and then clicking Delete brings up the confirmation warning shown in Figure 5-20.
FIGURE 5-20 The Delete Selected User? warning.
When you delete a user, the user’s mailbox is deleted from Office 365. Ensure that you have 
copied any mail you need from the user’s system before deleting the user. You cannot add the user 
back and regain access to the mailbox. Should you need to recover a deleted mailbox, you can 

	
Edit User Information    81
post a request on community.office365.com, but because support is not included with Plan P1, you 
have no assurance that the mailbox will be restored. 
SharePoint Online documents associated with the user remain intact. 
Edit User Information
You can set a user’s information from the Users page (refer to Figure 5-16). Simply select the user, and 
then click Edit. 
After selecting to edit a user, you are placed on the Licenses page, as shown in Figure 5-21. You 
can navigate from here by using the Details, Settings, and More links at the top of the screen. You can 
use these choices to selectively edit the same information presented when you created the user. 
FIGURE 5-21 Editing a user.
More Info When you click More, you are presented with a page on which you, as an ad-
ministrator, can edit settings for a particular user’s mailbox and Lync Online. Chapter 8, 
“Working with Outlook Web App,” covers the maibox settings, while Chapter 12, “Working 
with Lync Online,” details the Lync Online settings.

82   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Block a User’s Sign In
In some situations, you might want to block a user from signing in while still keeping the account. 
Perhaps you have terminated an employee, or a vendor you used for a project has finished her job. In 
either case, you probably don’t want to delete all the account’s email, which would occur if you simply 
deleted the account. 
Choose to edit the user’s account, and then click Settings on the edit user menu (beneath the user 
name in Figure 5-21) to reach the page shown in Figure 5-22.
FIGURE 5-22 Edit user settings allows you to set sign-in status to Blocked.
By now, this page should look familiar, but you’ll notice that in the center is a new section not 
available when you created the user: Set Sign-in Status.
By default, the sign-in status is Allowed. When you choose Blocked, the user cannot log on to 
Office 365. This does not evict a currently logged on user from access to the services, but it keeps him 
from accessing services at next logon.
When the user next attempts to log on to the Office 365 Portal, he will see the message shown in 
Figure 5-23.

	
Edit User Information    83
FIGURE 5-23 The Sign-In Is Blocked message.
In addition to setting the account to blocked, you should also reset the account password. By 
doing this, if the account setting becomes unblocked by accident, the user still cannot access the 
services.
Bulk Editing
A nice surprise lurks in the Office 365 administration portal. If you select multiple users and click Edit, 
you can bulk edit specific settings, as shown in Figure 5-24, including the user’s domain.
FIGURE 5-24 Bulk Edit mode.
After entering the updates that you want to apply, click Next to cycle the additional pages in the 
same sequence as the Add Users capabilities.
This is a very useful feature when you add a new domain, change telephone numbers, address, or 
otherwise need to update the information for several users at the same time.

84   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Adding Users Recap
Adding users in Office 365 is straightforward. You can add them one at a time or in bulk. You can 
even bulk edit users to make multiple changes simultaneously. You should add a second administra-
tor account as soon as possible to have a backup for access to administrative capabilities as well as 
to have an account with which to log on to make changes to the default administrator account. The 
second admin account can be a real user or just a placeholder without licenses assigned. Even without 
licenses, the account can log on and make changes to users in the Office 365 Portal. 
As a best practice, add your users first and then delegate your domain. Before you set up your 
users, change the user logon name to the new domain. This helps you avoid issues related to recon-
figuring the client software after you add a custom domain. 

	
	
85
C h a p t e r  6
Working with Custom Domains
W
hen a domain name represents your company branding, rather than an online service like 
Hotmail, Yahoo, Google, Comcast, or Microsoft Online, it is a custom domain. An email address 
like <your name>@<your business> projects a professional image and helps to imprint your brand 
with customers and the public. Every email you send reinforces the message that you have a unique 
identity and are not just using a public email service. Like your company logo, your custom domain 
helps set you apart from other businesses.
To use a custom domain with Microsoft Office 365, you must first own the domain name that you 
want to use. If you do not already have a domain, they are simple and inexpensive to acquire from a 
domain name registrar. Domain names must be unique, so be prepared to be a little flexible. If some-
one already owns the rights to your first choice, you might need to try a variation or two. Services 
and pricing vary widely, but you can buy a domain name, which you must renew annually for about 
$5–$20. 
This chapter will guide you through the process of adding your custom domain to Office 365. 
You’ll be alerted to common problems that can occur, how to avoid them, and a few tricks of the 
trade to help the process along.
About Domains and DNS
A domain name is like a phone number: just owning one doesn’t mean people can call you. You need 
a phone and connection to the phone company or cell network. In addition, when people dial your 
number, there has to be a way for that number to reach your phone. The phone company handles 
routing all the phone calls. When you dial a number, the connection is made automatically, so you 
aren’t aware of the technology or the process of how the call is routed. Unless you get an “all circuits 
busy” or something goes wrong with dialing, the process is completely transparent. Even so, there is 
a huge traffic-switching network behind the scenes that provides the ability to call anywhere in the 
world. 
A similar process occurs on the Internet. When you connect to a website or send an email, behind 
the scenes, your system uses a directory service called DNS, or Domain Name Services, to locate 
the service (website, email, or other Internet entity) you requested. If someone requests access to a 

86   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
service on your domain (by sending an email or accessing a website by using your domain name) your 
domain must have a listing that shows where these services are available. Often, you aren’t aware that 
these entries exist because the domain name registrar takes care of all this for you. For example, if you 
buy a domain name, email, and website from GoDaddy, it all just works because the company hosts 
your DNS services and configures the DNS settings automatically for you. You can modify these DNS 
settings if you choose to do so, and you even can specify that another provider, such as Microsoft, 
host the DNS instead of GoDaddy. In this case, GoDaddy is still the domain name registrar, but Micro-
soft would host the DNS services. 
When Registrars Do Not Host DNS
This chapter assumes that your registrar is also your DNS provider. However, some registrars 
sell domain names and do not host DNS services. In this case, you will have both a domain 
name registrar and a DNS service provider at two different web addresses. Keep in mind as 
you read the chapter that in some cases you will need to log on to the domain name registrar 
(to change the name of your DNS servers), and in other cases you need to log on to your DNS 
provider (to update DNS settings).
Microsoft’s DNS Solutions
Because Office 365 provides website, email, and other services, making changes to your domain’s 
DNS settings is an unavoidable technical reality. Many business owners and managers don’t know 
about DNS and don’t have time to learn the details to set up an email account with Office 365 or any 
other provider. In response, Microsoft implemented a system to make it as simple as possible for most 
small businesses to add domains to Office 365. 
Microsoft’s solution for correctly configuring Office 365 for small businesses is to provide DNS 
hosting for the small business accounts. This ensures that your DNS settings are correctly configured 
for Office 365. To achieve this, in December 2011, Microsoft released an important update called the 
Domain Quickstart for Office 365. Included in the update is a wizard to make certain that you have 
users ready to receive mail, that your website DNS entries are accounted for, and that you actually 
own the domain. Originally, the update was released only for new accounts in the United States, but 
by the time you read this chapter, these updates might have been rolled out worldwide or changed 
again. 
You can determine whether you have the updated Domain Quickstart Wizard when you add a new 
user. If at that time you are asked whether you want the user to have a custom domain name and if 
you see a screen similar to Figure 6-1, then you have the Domain Quickstart Wizard.

	
About Domains and DNS    87
FIGURE 6-1 Updated domain validation experience begins when adding a new user.
The section “Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard” walks you through using 
the wizard later in the chapter. If your version of the Office 365 Admin portal predates the Domain 
Quickstart Wizard, or if you previously used the wizard but now need to add additional domains, you 
can follow Microsoft’s standard method outlined in the section “Add a Domain Without the Domain 
Quickstart Wizard,” later in this chapter.
An Alternate DNS Solution
Some situations do not allow you to redirect your name servers to Microsoft. You should determine 
whether this applies to you before you go much further. You might be in this situation if:
■
■
You have multiple websites and settings that you do not want to manage on Microsoft DNS 
system.
■
■
You rely on software that integrates with your existing DNS provider. 
■
■
You need DNS entries other than a CNAME or A records. The Microsoft DNS Manager allows 
only custom A and CNAME records to be added.

88   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
■
■
You’re unable to delegate to another DNS provider due to your circumstances. In some 
regions, this ability is restricted by policy or law. For example, .no and .de domains cannot be 
delegated.
■
■
You simply want more control over your DNS entries than Microsoft provides and are comfort-
able with your existing provider.
In other words, if you prefer to keep your DNS services where they are, there’s no problem 
in doing so. The “Add a Domain Without Redirecting DNS” section at the end of this chapter 
shows you the way. In addition, for an article that details the process for configuring your 
existing DNS provider with Office 365 settings, you can consult Microsoft’s online help at 
http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-smallbusinesses/hh416759.aspx.
Timing and DNS Changes
Making changes to DNS entries can be an exercise in patience. You will see messages from Microsoft 
and possibly your DNS service provider during this process, saying to expect delays of up to 72 hours. 
In practice, most updates to DNS for Office 365 take effect within a few minutes. The amount of time 
you must wait depends on many circumstances, most of which are outside of your control. For this 
reason, you can expect that your domain validation and setup will be completed in a short amount of 
time, but don’t be surprised if it takes longer.
Your First Domain
Your first domain is the “base” onmicrosoft.com domain that you designated during the signup pro-
cess for Office 365. The <domain>.onmicrosoft.com name is permanently assigned to your account 
and cannot be edited or deleted. You can use this domain for any and all Office 365 purposes. In 
other words, even though adding a custom domain is common, it is entirely optional.
When to Add Users
Before users can receive mail in Office 365, user accounts that are assigned to the custom domain 
must already exist. For this reason, you should add users before you validate a domain. To ensure that  
you have users' accounts ready for receiving mail, the wizard that adds a domain will ask you if you 
want to add users. In addition, after the domain is added, any existing users can be switched to use 
the new domain all at one time. 
If you have a mail service using your current domain name, that mail service will stop receiving 
mail after you fully complete the process of adding a domain to Office 365. If you want to transfer 
mail to Office 365 using your existing logons with the Connected Accounts feature of OWA, you 
should do this before you transfer mail routing to Office 365. Again, you need user accounts in Office 
365 to use this method, which is another reason to create user accounts before adding a domain. 

	
Add a Domain: Common Steps    89
Reuse Your Domain in Office 365
If you previously validated your domain with Office 365 in a different account, perhaps a trial account, 
or used it with the Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS), you must remove the domain com-
pletely from the previous account before it can be validated. Prior to deleting the domain from the 
administration console, you must remove any reference to the domain from user logons, conference 
rooms, distribution lists, and Microsoft Lync Online. For Lync Online, the fastest way to remove cus-
tom domains assigned to user names is to remove the Lync Online license assigned to the user in the 
old account. If you are still unable to delete the domain, you will require Microsoft technical support 
or the assistance of a partner.
Add a Domain: Common Steps
Whether you add a domain by using the Domain Quickstart Wizard, standard method, or without 
changing DNS services, you will follow the same general procedure: 
1.	
Identify your DNS provider.
You will need to know who your DNS provider is and how to log on to the DNS administra-
tion console for your domain. Locate this information before you begin. If you do not know 
who your provider is, try browsing to http://www.internic.net/whois.html. Enter your custom 
domain name on the page, and then click Submit. In the resulting report, look for “Registrar” 
to see which registrar hosts your domain. You can use this information to track down your 
domain registrar and contact them, if necessary, about accessing your DNS settings. Addi-
tional assistance is available in the Office 365 portal Microsoft online help during the domain 
validation process.
2.	
Document your existing DNS settings.
With access to your DNS settings, be sure to print or otherwise record these settings for your 
domain. You will need these for future reference when configuring DNS for Office 365, so if 
something goes awry, you will have a record of how to return your settings to the original 
state. This is an important step that you should not omit. Include MX records, your current 
name server settings, as well as all other entries you see. 
3.	
Verify ownership of the domain.
Imagine if you masqueraded as someone from Microsoft.com or another organization while 
you sent and received email. That of course would be unacceptable. Fortunately, using Office 
365, it is not possible. Microsoft ensures that you are the owner of the domain that you want 
to move to Office 365 through a process known as “domain validation.”

90   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Here’s how it works. During the domain validation process (covered later in this chapter) you 
are given a unique “secret” (looking something like MS=ms234323) to enter into the DNS 
system. Office 365 then queries DNS for the domain to see whether the designated secret is 
present. If found, the domain is accepted for use. The underlying assumption is that if you 
have the authority to edit the DNS entries for the domain, you effectively own the domain. 
This technique is widely used by many services. 
Domain validation is technical but not hard to do. If you follow the instructions and have 
access to the DNS settings for your custom domain, you can validate the domain without 
technical assistance. Alternatively, a helpful DNS provider can add these changes for you. If 
you follow the instructions, domain validation will not affect your current mail or services.
4.	
Assign users to the new domain.
After adding the domain, you need to convert the email addresses of any existing users to the 
new domain. When converted, users must log on using the new email address. 
5.	
Configure DNS for Office 365.
As described earlier, Microsoft prefers that you assign Microsoft as your DNS provider. Office 
365 settings are created for you. You can then add any additional DNS settings that you 
require in the Office 365 administration console. Alternatively, you can add Office 365 DNS 
settings to your existing DNS settings at your DNS provider. 
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard
Microsoft’s Domain Quickstart Wizard was designed to assist with the task of moving your first 
domain to Office 365 and assigning users to the domain. The wizard asks you a few questions and 
then creates a step-by-step plan for you to follow. You can act on or revise the plan as needed. 
The wizard begins with the Add New User page, as shown earlier in Figure 6-1. I prefer to create 
users before adding a domain so that mail can be migrated by using the Connected Accounts feature 
in Outlook Web App. In addition, domain validation can take a while to execute correctly; creating a 
user takes only a minute or less.
You can also start the wizard by clicking Add A Domain on the Domains page, as shown in Figure 6-2.

	
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard    91
FIGURE 6-2 The Domains page: add a domain.
Important  Microsoft regularly updates the administration portal and has made signifi-
cant changes to the domain validation and DNS transfer process since the services were 
released. Because Microsoft releases updates regionally for testing and refinement before 
they are released globally, the process you encounter might be different from the one 
described. Even so, the basic issues remain the same. You need to validate your domain ac-
cording to instructions, ensure that your users are assigned to the new domain, and then 
designate Microsoft as the DNS provider when you are ready to receive mail. During the 
process, be aware of the impact of these changes on your website entries or on any other 
services for which you have DNS entries. 
Enter your custom domain name in the provided text box (Figure 6-3), click Next, and then answer 
the questions on the Tell Us About page (Figure 6-4).

FIGURE 6-3 Specify the domain to use as your email address.
FIGURE 6-4 Tell us about your domain.

	
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard    93
If you are already using your domain name for email, the transfer is a bit more complex because 
timing becomes an issue. You want to ensure that you do not have an email interruption during the 
switch. One way to do this is to use the Connected Accounts feature of Outlook Web App (described 
in Chapter 8, “Working with Outlook Web App”) to read mail from your current service into your 
Office 365 inboxes before you transfer the domain. Then, when you make the switch, your mail from 
your previous provider is already in your inbox.
For the purposes of the example, assume that you are already using the custom domain for email 
and also have a website up and running. Click Next to see the plan, which will be similar to Figure 6-5.
FIGURE 6-5 Set up your domain to work with Office 365.
Confirm That You Own Your Domain (Domain Validation)
To begin the setup process, click Start Step 1; you’ll see the Confirm screen shown in Figure 6-6.
Important  Although the changes that Microsoft asks you to make for validation will not 
interfere with your existing services, incorrectly adding, deleting, or changing settings can 
disrupt your email or web service. Before making any changes, print the DNS listing for 
your domain for later reference.

94

FIGURE 6-6 Identify your DNS registrar.
Microsoft provides specific instructions for several popular registrars, including the following:
■
■
GoDaddy
■
■
eNom
■
■
Melbourne IT
■
■
Network Solutions
■
■
Tucows
■
■
Register.com
If your registrar is in the DNS Service Providers drop-down list, choose it. If not, choose Mine Is 
Not Listed. If you have a consultant or Microsoft Partner who manages this for you, select I Have 
Someone Who Takes Care Of This For Me. You’ll be provided with a message you can forward that 
has instructions about how to validate the domain. If you don’t know who your provider is, click I 
Don’t Know to go to online help, which provides useful links and instructions about how to identify 
your DNS provider.
For this example, select Mine Is Not Listed to receive a generic set of instructions applicable to all 
registrars, as shown in Figure 6-7. 

	
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard    95
FIGURE 6-7 Domain validation instructions.
This is where tasks take a technical turn. To proceed, you will need to log on to your DNS providers 
and make the requested changes. Take note of the message “Don’t worry; this won’t break any fabri-
kamfurniture.com functionality.” At this stage, you are just verifying ownership and nothing more.
Verification Methods
The entries for any DNS system are composed of a series of resource records. These types of records 
comply with industry standards so that DNS works the same way for everyone. Of the many types (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types if you’re interested), the Verify Domain instruc-
tions require that you use a TXT (text) or MX (mail exchange) record verification. 
Although it shares the same abbreviation as an unformatted text file, a TXT DNS entry is very 
different: It’s a general purpose record that has many uses in DNS. In this case, you can validate your 
domain by adding a specific TXT entry in your DNS system. 

96   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Some providers do not allow TXT records to be added to DNS, so Microsoft added the MX 
method. MX stands for Mail Exchange; it is the type of record used to designate where mail for your 
domain should go. For example, if your mail service is provided by your ISP, the MX record will point 
to your ISP’s mail servers. If your mail service is provided by Google, your MX record will point to 
Google’s mail servers. Because changing MX records is common, DNS providers usually allow chang-
ing MX records. In this case, you would validate the domain by adding a specific MX record that is not 
intended to route mail at all but instead is used only for validation of ownership for your domain. 
Of the two methods, the TXT method is preferred because there is little chance that an incorrect 
entry will interfere with any existing services. Use the TXT method if possible. The following discussion 
assumes you are using a TXT record, but it also applies to an MX record. 
Add Verification Entries
There are many domain registrars on the Internet, so it is not possible to provide step-by-step instruc-
tions for everyone. If available, be sure to select the instructions specific to your registrar. Regardless 
of the specific steps, the end result is that you must add a TXT (or MX) record with the provided infor-
mation. Figure 6-8 provides a close up view of the general instructions and shows an actual example 
of what you’re asked to add. 
FIGURE 6-8 Generic instructions for validation by using the TXT method.
Enter this information into your domain name registrars’ system. In the following example, 
eNom.com is the host for Fabriakmfurniture.com. In practice, I would have asked for the instructions 
designed specifically for eNom, but for the purposes of the book, generic instructions are sufficient.
Making the needed updates is actually very simple. Here’s all I did to achieve the desired result, as 
shown in Figure 6-9:
1.	
Log on to eNom.
2.	
Select the domain, and then under Manage Domains, select Host Records.

	
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard    97
3.	
Select record type TXT (there is already a blank line when you access the page).
4.	
Enter an @ sign in the Host Name field. This corresponds to step 3 in Figure 6-8. 
5.	
Copy and paste the “secret” code MS=ms35484637 into the address field. Verify that this is 
correct, and then click Save.
That’s it!
FIGURE 6-9 eNom DNS administration with verification information.
Important  Before you make any changes to your DNS settings, print your current configu-
ration. This printout is a backup of your settings and can be very useful when planning your 
move to Office 365. For example, the entry for www on the first line of Figure 6-9 indicates 
that a website address is configured and in use. You will need this information later.
Variations from the General Instructions
The general instructions are not likely to map exactly to your provider. In this example, step 4 in 
Figure 6-8 directs you to add the secret to a box called Fully Qualified Domain Name or Points To. As 
you can see in Figure 6-9, for eNom (and other providers) there is no such box. Instead, it is named 
Address. 
Also, step 5 of the instructions directs you to update the TTL entry (which stands for Time To Live 
and controls how long a DNS lookup is valid before it needs to be checked again). The TTL entry is 
optional and is not configurable in many DNS provider systems.

98   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
If you are unsure what to do with the instructions, use the preceding example as a guide. Because 
DNS is the same everywhere, the forms might change, but in the end, your entry should be similar in 
appearance to the TXT entry shown in Figure 6-9. Keep in mind that incorrectly entering information 
in a TXT record will not interfere with your services. Just take care not to change anything else. 
Delay Before Validation
At the bottom of Figure 6-7, note the message:
Typically it takes about 15 minutes for your changes to take effect. However, it can take 
up to 72 hours for the record that you created to propagate through the DNS system.
This is good guidance. There is no harm in trying to validate after 5 minutes, and in many cases, 
that is sufficient. Taking 72 hours is quite rare but has been known to occur. 
15 Minutes to 72 Hours? 
Why is the delay so variable? The answer has to do with the inner workings of DNS. When you 
browse to a website such as bing.com, your system queries a DNS server that looks up the IP 
address of bing.com. When the DNS server has found the address, on the next query for bing.
com, the DNS server checks to see whether it has the result in memory. If so, the server returns 
the last IP address it found rather than looking up the address. How long a lookup is held by a 
DNS server depends on settings chosen by the DNS service and is outside of Microsoft’s con-
trol. Some servers look up every address, every time. Most keep entries in memory for an hour 
or less. Others hold onto lookups for days. For this reason, the advice given by Microsoft has a 
very wide range: 15 minutes to 72 hours. In practice, it is usually minutes, not days.
When ready, click Done, Verify Now at the bottom of the screen.
If the validation fails, you will see a message instructing you to wait 72 hours. Verify that you have 
the correct entries, and then try again after some time. If validation still fails after waiting overnight, it 
is likely that there is some other issue.
More Info If you browse to http://network-tools.com/nslook/Default.asp, enter your custom 
domain name, and then select TXT for the query type, you will see a result that shows you 
whether your TXT entry has been written and is available. If your TXT records appears here 
and is correctly entered, Office 365 should successfully validate the domain.
When the validation succeeds, you’ll see a result similar to that shown in Figure 6-10.

Click Next to go to step 2, as shown in Figure 6-11.
Set Up Office 365 DNS for Your Website
This step’s title, Make Sure People Can Still Get To Your Website, could be interpreted to mean that 
something might have just happened to impede access to your current website. That is not the case. 
Step 2 asks you for your current DNS information about your website. Microsoft will add that to their 
DNS settings for your account. Then, when you transfer the DNS service to Microsoft, people can still 
get to your website because the correct DNS entries are present. That transfer doesn’t actually hap-
pen until step 5.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Click Start Step 2 to see the instructions shown in Figure 6-12.
Figure 6-12 Obtain the IP address for your website.
This page asks you to find the IP address of your website. This information is in the DNS settings 
for your domain. You can also discover this by clicking Start, typing CMD, and then pressing Enter. In 
the command window that opens, type PING and your website name (as in ping fabrikamfurniture.
com), and then press Enter. The response will be the IP address associated with your website. 
The wizard also provides a prepared message that you can email to your website-hosting provider 
if you choose to ask them for this information.
When you have the IP address, click Continue, which will bring up the window that you can see in 
Figure 6-13.
The vast majority of websites will be associated with an IP address. Microsoft also allows you to 
designate a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), if required. A fully qualified domain name is your 
website name in full, such as www.contoso.com. The entries in your existing DNS system are your 
guide to the correct path. In the example, assume an IP address, and then click Next. Enter the IP 
address for the website, and then click Check Now (see Figure 6-14).

Update Existing Office 365 Email Addresses
In Step 3, you can update existing user accounts to use the new domain name, as demonstrated in 
Figure 6-17. All the users you change must log on using the new email address. Be sure to tell users to 
do this if you have already given them access to the services. In addition, if you configure Outlook or 
Lync Online prior to adding the domain, you will need to update both applications to work with the 
new domain name. Passwords do not change.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When you click Add Users to Office 365, you’ll have the choice to add new users or skip this step 
(see Figure 6-20). If your users are already set up, you can skip this step by clicking No, I'm The Only 
One With A <Custom Domain Name> Email Address.
Figure 6-20 Do you want to add users now?
The wizard employs a “short form” for adding users, which is shown in Figure 6-21.
Chapter 5, “Working with User Accounts,” covers more of the details that you can complete for 
users, but the short form is sufficient to get you going. As you add users, be sure to make note of 
the temporary passwords created, because users will need them to log on. Instructions for their first 
logon will be emailed to the address entered in the form. 
The key point is that before you actually transfer the DNS services to Microsoft (the next step), you 
must have users set up or there will be no mailbox to receive mail. 
To proceed with the next step, click Done Adding Users on the summary page that is displayed 
after you add the last user.

You’re now getting down to the finish line. In the end, you have to return to your domain registrar 
and update your domain’s settings to use Microsoft DNS services. Like the Domain Validation Wizard, 
specific instructions are provided for some registrars, as well as a generic set of instructions, as shown 
in Figure 6-24. 
Figure 6-24 Complete the process details.
This long detail can be summarized as follows: at your domain registrar’s site, update your 
domain settings to use the DNS servers located at ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com (primary server) 
and ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com (secondary server). When you do this, the DNS entries you 

108   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
created by going through the domain wizard (which occurred in the background) are the ones that 
now drive access to your email and to Internet services such as your website.
Before proceeding, take a look at the DNS settings Microsoft has created for you, and compare 
them to your existing DNS configuration. 
To View Your Office 365 DNS Settings
At the bottom of the screen, click Cancel, as shown in Figure 6-24. Next, click Save and Close, and 
then answer Yes to the prompt “Skip domain setup for now?” This returns you to the main Admin 
page.
On the left side of the Admin screen, under Admin Overview, click Domains. You’ll see the window 
depicted in Figure 6-25, but now your custom domain is added. Select the custom domain, and then 
click Manage DNS.
Figure 6-25 DNS records for a custom domain.
The entries in this page will be in effect when your DNS settings are set to use Microsoft’s name 
servers. Most of the entries are those required for Office 365. At the top of the page, you’ll see the 
entries that were added for the website in step 2 of the wizard. Examine the entries in your existing 
DNS provider’s setup to see what might not be accounted for in Microsoft’s DNS setup. For most 
businesses, the website and email services are all that are present. 
If needed, you can use this page to add entries to Microsoft’s DNS settings.

	
Add a Domain by Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard    109
Important  You can add only CNAME and A records. If your business requires entries other 
than these, see the section “An Alternative DNS Solution” earlier in this chapter.
Assign Microsoft as the DNS Provider 
Log on to your DNS provider’s administration screen and locate where your name servers are speci-
fied. In our example, Fabrikamfurniture is hosted at eNom. By selecting the domain and then DNS 
Server Settings as shown in Figure 6-26, you can change the name server entries.
Important  Before you make any changes to your DNS server settings, be sure to record the 
existing settings. If you need to switch back quickly because of some issue that might have 
been overlooked, you will need to know the original settings. 
Figure 6-26 Delegating DNS services to Microsoft from a domain hosted at eNom. 
After you save the settings, mail will start to flow to Exchange Online as soon as the DNS entries 
are updated on the Internet. This can take from 15 minutes to a couple days, depending on how the 
DNS servers involved are configured. When I changed the settings at eNom for this example, a pop-
up stated that the update would take 24 hours. It actually took about 30 minutes.
When completed, return to the wizard at Microsoft to verify the changes. You might need to click 
through the pages in step 5 again to return to the Complete The Process page (refer to Figure 6-24). 
At the bottom of the page, click Done, Go Check.

110   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
If the check does not verify, you will see the message shown in Figure 6-27.
Figure 6-27 DNS records are not updated yet.
It’s a good idea to double- and triple-check the name server entries at your DNS registrar to 
ensure that they are completely correct. 
 Note  If you browse to http://network-tools.com/nslook/Default.asp and enter your custom 
domain name, you can see whether your DNS servers are showing as directed to Microsoft. 
If so, validation should succeed.
After the settings validate, you’ll see the completion message shown in Figure 6-28.
Because you are delegating DNS to Microsoft, your DNS entries are certain to be correct for email, 
Lync Online, and Microsoft SharePoint Online. It might take some time for your DNS provider changes 
to take effect. The only possible issues relate to addresses you add for your website and to the 
amount of time it takes for DNS to “catch up” with the changes you’ve made. 
You can test that email is flowing by sending mail to your Office 365 email address. If the mail is 
received, you’ve confirmed that email is being routed correctly. If not, check to see whether the mail 
is still being sent to your previous email provider. If the mail is being routed there, you should just 
wait for a while for the DNS system to catch up with the changes.

Figure 6-28 DNS has been changed to Microsoft.
Verify that your website is available by browsing to your website. If it’s not available, verify the 
entries in your DNS configuration for the domain by clicking the domain and selecting Manage DNS.
Add a Domain Without the Domain Quickstart Wizard
If your version of the Office 365 Admin portal does not offer the Domain Quickstart Wizard, or if 
you previously used the wizard and need to add additional domains, you can always fall back on the 
original method that Microsoft provided with the Office 365 Plan P1. 
This method is a bit more manual than using the Domain Quickstart Wizard but has the same 
outcome. One of the differences between the Domain Quickstart Wizard process and this process is 
that the wizard procedure will ask you about your website DNS settings, if any, and configure DNS 
accordingly. Without the wizard, you need to add those settings manually to Microsoft DNS setup 
before completing the finish step. As a result, the actual workflow is:
1.	
Specify your domain.
2.	
Verify the domain. 
3.	
Prepare your accounts for changing name servers.

112   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
4.	
Update Microsoft DNS entries for your website.
5.	
Change name servers.
6.	
Finish. 
Specify Domain
You start the process from the Domains page in the Office 365 Admin portal (see Figure 6-2). Clicking 
Add A Domain takes you to the first step and to the Specify Domain page, as shown in Figure 6-29.
Figure 6-29 The Specify Domain page.
Type your domain name in the text box, and then click Next.
Verify Domain
Figure 6-30 presents the Verify Domain page, which asks you to select your domain name registrar 
from the pull-down list. If your registrar is not listed, select General Instructions.

	
Add a Domain Without the Domain Quickstart Wizard    113
Figure 6-30 The Verify Domain page.
After you make a selection, you will see information similar to that shown in Figure 6-7. Office 365 
instructs you to enter a specific “secret” in your existing DNS provider’s setup for your domain by 
using the MX record or TXT record. After you have added the information to your existing DNS ser-
vice provider’s forms, click Verify. Office 365 then checks whether you entered the secret as directed. 
More Info For important details about how to verify your domain, refer to the section 
”Confirm That You Own Your Domain (Domain Validation)” for an example of the verifica-
tion process; other than cosmetic differences in the screens, that section’s real-world ex-
ample of the validation process is identical to the steps you should follow.
When you are ready, click Verify; Office 365 will validate the entries you made and, when con-
firmed, will accept the domain for use with the services.
You’re probably not expecting this, but after validating the domain, click Cancel. You will come 
back to this step in a bit. First, you have some business to attend to.
Prepare Your Accounts 
For the best experience, stop after validating the custom domain. If you continue with the workflow 
by editing the name server records, as directed by the Office 365 portal, mail for your custom domain 
will start being routed to Office 365 before your user accounts are set up to receive it. You need to 
prepare those accounts now by assigning the custom domain to your users’ email addresses. If you 

114   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
have not created users yet, now is a good time do so. Figure 6-31 shows the user management Prop-
erties page. To reach this page from the Admin portal, click Users, select the user, click Edit, select the 
domain name from the pull-down list, and then click Save.
Note  You can select all the users at the same time, and click Edit to enter Bulk Edit Mode, 
which enables you to set all the accounts to the custom domain at the same time. 
Figure 6-31 Assigning a custom domain to a user name.
As previously mentioned, when you change the email address of the user, she must log on with 
the new address. This will affect Outlook and Lync 2010 if you have already set them up with the old 
address.
Update Office 365 DNS for Your Website and Other Services 
As soon as you validate your domain, Microsoft creates the correct Office 365 DNS entries for the 
domain immediately. They are not in use yet (that doesn’t happen until you make a final change at 
your current registrar), so there’s nothing to worry about in terms of disrupting existing services. 
Because DNS on Office 365 is set up but not in use, you have a window of opportunity to do some 

	
Add a Domain Without the Domain Quickstart Wizard    115
additional preparations before you fully delegate the domain. Basically, you’re pausing between 
step 2 (Figure 6-30) and step 3 (Validate and Change Name Server, respectively). At this stage, you 
can view the entries Microsoft created for your domain. From the Domains page, select your verified 
domain, and then click Manage DNS, as shown in Figure 6-32. 
Figure 6-32 Selecting to manage DNS.
The DNS Manager displays the DNS entries created for you by the validation process. Figure 6-33 
shows the default settings from an actual validation.

116   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
If you have a website using your custom domain (such as www.fabrikamfurniture.com), your cur-
rent DNS provider has the proper settings to support your site. You need to identify those entries and 
re-create them in the Microsoft DNS system before assigning Microsoft to host your name services. 
You can create the record after transferring DNS to Microsoft if you can abide with the potential for 
disruption in access to your website while you make the changes. Remember, due to the nature of 
DNS, there can be delays from minutes to hours between the time you make a change and the time 
they are available.
For example, Figure 6-34 shows the DNS settings for Fabrikamfurniture.net as provided by 
eNom.com.
Figure 6-34 DNS settings for Fabrikamfurniture.net.
The first line directs all traffic for www.fabrikamfurniture.net to the IP address of 192.168.0.1 (an 
invalid Internet IP address used for illustration purposes). This line does not exist in the Office 365 
DNS settings, so it needs to be added. 
In addition, on the next line, you’ll see an @ sign going to the same IP address. This permits 
fabrikamfurniture.net to be used as the website address (no www). This line also needs to be added 
to the Office 365 DNS setup.
To add these entries to Office 365, click New, select A (Address), and then add the entries from 
your existing DNS system, as illustrated in Figure 6-35.

	
Add a Domain Without the Domain Quickstart Wizard    117
Figure 6-35 Adding a DNS record to enable an existing website.
When complete, the custom DNS settings in the Office 365 DNS manager will look similar to 
Figure 6-36.
Figure 6-36 Custom entries for a website.
Now, when switching to the DNS settings hosted by Microsoft, access to your existing website will 
be uninterrupted. If you choose to switch to the public website of SharePoint Online, the DNS settings 
will be updated automatically.
Change Name Servers
You assigned users to your new domain and you updated the Office 365 DNS entries with any custom 
records that you require. However, before proceeding, I suggest that you recheck your new Office 
365 DNS setting against your existing provider’s DNS settings to ensure that everything is accounted 
for properly. When satisfied, you’re ready to “throw the switch” by directing DNS services for your 
domain to Microsoft’s DNS servers. But where should you direct them?
To find out, you need to use a little sleight of hand. Even though you haven’t completed setting 
the domain (the name servers have not been changed), you’ll ask Office 365 Portal to troubleshoot 
the DNS setup. The resulting page will show you the entries that you’re after. To begin, go to the 
Domain page, and then select Troubleshoot (see Figure 6-37). 

118   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 6-37 Troubleshoot domains to return to wizard.
Even though it might not be true, select I Changed The Settings At My Provider More Than 72 
Hours Ago; the Troubleshoot Domains page appears, as shown in Figure 6-38. If you select any other 
option, the troubleshooting does not actually start. Instead, you see a message that says, in effect, 
“wait awhile and try again.”
Figure 6-38 The name server records are not correct.

	
Add a Domain Without Redirecting DNS     119
The Should Point To column tells you that your name servers should be set to ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.
com (primary server) and ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com (secondary server). To delegate name services host-
ing to Microsoft, you must set up your domain so that it refers to NS1.bdm.microsoftonline.com and NS1.
bdm.microsoftonline.com as name servers. Figure 6-26 shows the eNom entries for changing DNS servers. 
Refer to the section “Assign Microsoft as the DNS Provider” for additional details. After you update 
the DNS provider settings for your domain, return to the Office 365 portal and select Troubleshooting 
The Domain again (or click Back if you did not close the window). 
When the name server entries are verified by the troubleshooter, the window presented in Figure 
6-39 appears. This might take some time before it can be detected. 
Figure 6-39 The name server records are correct.
Add a Domain Without Redirecting DNS 
In some circumstances, Microsoft cannot host your DNS services. For example, some countries do 
not permit re-delegation. In other cases, you might need DNS entries for your domain that are not 
allowed in the Microsoft DNS system. Finally, you might simply be more comfortable keeping DNS 
services where they are. To configure this, follow the instructions in the section ”Add a Domain With-
out the Domain Quickstart Wizard,” up to and including verifying the domain. Then, instead of trans-
ferring DNS services to Microsoft, view the DNS settings for your domain in the DNS Manager (Figure 
6-25) and add the entries to your existing DNS service. When you add the MX records, your mail will 
be routed to Office 365. Using this method ensures that access to your existing website will continue 
and that any other DNS entries you rely on will remain present.

120   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
On the downside, if Microsoft adds services that require new DNS entries, you have to manually 
make the entries when you keep control of DNS. This occurred in December 2011 when Microsoft 
released Lync Mobile for Windows 7 phones. For those with DNS hosted at Microsoft, the update 
worked seamlessly. Those hosted elsewhere had to manually update their DNS.
Important  When you host your own DNS, the DNS troubleshooter in Office 365 will always 
report that DNS is not properly configured. In addition, if you plan to use SharePoint Online 
for a public website, you must make the changes to DNS yourself. For these and other con-
siderations, see the section “Limitations in Office 365 Services when Office 365 doesn’t host 
your DNS,” at http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-smallbusinesses/hh416759.aspx.
Multiple Domains
Small businesses commonly have multiple lines of business. You can add domain names for each for 
your businesses, but be aware that the Domain Quickstart Wizard you used (if available) for your first 
domain does not appear for additional domains. Follow the guidance in the section “Add a Domain 
Without Using the Domain Quickstart Wizard” to add additional domains. 
After adding another domain, you can assign users to log on using the new domain or add the 
domain as an alternate email address in their inbox properties. You will learn how to add multiple 
domains to a user account in Chapter 8.
SharePoint Online and Custom Domains
You can use your custom domain with the public website that comes with SharePoint Online. If Micro-
soft hosts your DNS settings, DNS will automatically be updated. If you host your own DNS settings, 
you need to update your DNS settings with the entries for SharePoint Online. 
To change the URL for SharePoint Online, in the Office 365 administration portal, on the Domains 
page, click Change Address as shown in Figure 6-40.
Figure 6-40 Changing the address of your SharePoint Online public website.

	
SharePoint Online and Custom Domains    121
You can then select from a list of validated domains as illustrated in Figure 6-41. 
Figure 6-41 Selecting a new address for the SharePoint Online public website.
Office 365 next displays a message indicating that changes might require 24 hours to take effect. 
In practice, the delay is usually much less than this, often minutes. When Office 365 has finished mak-
ing the changes to its DNS system for your domain, the domain name shown in Figure 6-42 changes 
to show the new domain name.
If you host your own DNS settings, you need to update your DNS entries to direct traffic to Share-
Point Online. After you’ve assigned the custom domain, select the domain from the Domains page, 
and then click DNS Manager. 
Figure 6-42 The DNS Manager with new entries for SharePoint Online.

122   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
The entries you need to add for SharePoint Online are the last CNAME entry with host name www, 
and the A record with the host name of @. 
As usual, with DNS, allow time for any changes you make to take effect.
Final Thoughts
Adding a custom domain to Office 365 is a key step in the deployment process. Microsoft added the 
Domain Quickstart Wizard to the service to assist you through the process. The key feature of DNS for 
Plan P1 is that Microsoft hosts the DNS services for your domain. This ensures that your DNS settings 
are correct and remain updated as new services become available. Even so, you can continue to host 
DNS at your existing service provider if you need or prefer to. Many small businesses have multiple 
lines of business. You can add multiple domains without a problem and assign them individual users 
or have users with multiple email addresses. Finally, you can use the public website of SharePoint 
Online as your public website if you choose.
Now that you have users created and your domain set up and ready to go, you are ready to set up 
your desktops for your users.

Desktop Setup and Migration
Y
ou’ve created your users and configured your custom domain. Without any further action, you 
can access the browser-based features of Microsoft Office 365, such as Microsoft Outlook Web 
App and the Microsoft SharePoint Online Team Site—just head for the Office 365 portal Home page 
(see Figure 7-1) and click Outlook or Team Site. These web-based access points to Office 365 services 
are useful, but most businesses also want to set up Microsoft Office and Lync 2010 for use with Office 
365. To achieve this, you must download and install some software from the administration portal. 
To get the most out of Office 365 for you and your coworkers, resist the temptation to dive in right 
away. Before you begin, take some time to review your existing setup and think through how you 
want to treat your existing mail. Investing the time now to configure your desktop to use Office 365 
will reap benefits later.

Cleaning House
Many small businesses have gigabytes of mail history, much of which is not relevant to their current 
business. If you plan to move your mail into Office 365, now is a good time to clean up your inbox. 
Take some time to remove the mail in the junk folder, empty the trash, and delete those embarrass-
ingly old emails that you’ve been meaning to get around to. No need to clog up your pristine Office 
365 mailbox with unnecessary mail that needlessly increases the migration time and then slows down 
searches. 
Document Your Existing Setup
Take a look at your settings in Outlook for your existing mailbox. Are you using contacts, rules, signa-
tures, or other customizations? Have you created folders in your mailbox to help organize your mail? 
These kinds of settings are specific to your inbox, so when you add your new Office 365 inbox, they 
will not be carried over. Most people have only a few custom settings, so it doesn’t take much time to 
reconfigure them in Outlook for Office 365. If you have a complex setup, you can export and import 
rules and other settings. 
Frequently, small businesses use Outlook contacts as an important part of their operation. If so, 
consider how you want to move the contacts. The process can be as simple as dragging the con-
tacts from one inbox to another, but it might also involve exporting the contacts into a file and then 
importing them into your Office 365 inbox. See “Export from Outlook,” later in this chapter.
Migration Options
Before you set up Outlook for Office 365, determine how you want to manage your existing mail. 
Some companies choose to simply add their Office 365 inbox to their existing setup and have all new 
mail arrive in Office 365, and their old mail just stays in their old service. Others choose to migrate 
their mail, calendar, and other information to Office 365. You have lots of choices. To help you decide 
which is right for your business, the following sections outline the most common scenarios and pro-
vide implementation tips. 

	
Migration Options    125
Special Circumstances
The migration methods presented in this chapter will work with most versions of Outlook as 
well as other mail clients, but you do need to keep a couple special circumstances in mind. 
One such occurs if you use Outlook 2007 and your current mailbox is hosted on an Microsoft 
Exchange Server (locally or in the cloud). Office 365 is also an Exchange mailbox, and Outlook 
2007 does not allow you to have more than one Exchange mailbox in the same profile. In this 
case, you can export your existing mailbox to a PST (and import it into your Office 365 inbox or 
attach it as described later), upgrade to Outlook 2010, or use a migration service. All of these 
work very well to move not only your mail but also your Calendar and other information into 
Office 365. 
If you have Outlook Express on the same system as Outlook, you can directly import mail 
and other settings by following the instructions in the KB article “How to upgrade from Out-
look Express to Outlook 2010, to Outlook 2007, to Outlook 2003, or to Outlook 2002,” at http://
support.microsoft.com/kb/291602. Note that you do not want to import your email account 
configuration, just the contents. 
If you use an email client other than Outlook, you will need to refer to its documentation 
for specific import and export information. Because Outlook is the most common email client 
in the world, most other email clients have the ability to transfer information into and out of 
Outlook. Look for details about how to export the files into a CSV (comma-separated value) or 
PST file format.
Use a Partner or Service
You can migrate your content yourself, or you can get some help. You can find Office 365 Partners 
and consultants available who can manage your migration. Browse to http://pinpoint.microsoft.com 
and search for Office 365 to find someone in your area. 
In addition, inexpensive online services such as Migration Wiz (http://migrationwiz.com) can move 
your mail and related content (depending on your service provider) to Office 365 for a flat, affordable 
fee. 
Move Mail with PST Files
Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 have the ability to host multiple inboxes at the same time. If you 
simply add your Office 365 inbox to Outlook and you already have an inbox, you now have two mail-
boxes. When you set up your account this way, you can easily access your old mail and use Office 365 
at the same time. 

126   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
With two mailboxes, your previous mail is available to you in Outlook but not in Office 365. To 
add your old mail to your Office 365 inbox, just drag your previous mail into your Office 365 inbox. It 
really is that simple. You can do the same with contacts, your calendar, tasks, and other items associ-
ated with an Outlook inbox. This is perhaps the most commonly used method for migrating small 
businesses to Office 365 because it is easy to do and works well.
Because Outlook has both inboxes, a special problem arises when you move your domain name 
from your previous service provider to Office 365. When you make the DNS changes, Outlook will be 
unable to log on to the old service. The resulting errors shown in Outlook are more or less cosmetic, 
because you don’t use the previous mail service anymore (and if you do, both Office 365 and your 
previous provider will have different domains, so this won’t be an issue). Even so, it can be annoying 
to have Outlook showing errors. 
To solve this problem, first export the contents of your inbox to a PST file. When exporting the 
inbox to a PST, you effectively copy the contents of the inbox, including contacts, calendars, mail, and 
tasks, to a portable file that is now separated from the original service. With Outlook, you can work 
with a PST file in a variety of ways. You can import the contents into your Office 365 mailbox, or you 
can simply open it in Outlook where you can work with the mail and other contents as if it were your 
old inbox (see Figure 7-18). In either case, you can then safely delete your old inbox. Outlook will no 
longer try to contact your old mail service, which stops any error message you might be receiving. 
Both methods are covered in this chapter. 
What Is a PST File? 
Outlook has the ability to store mail, tasks, calendars, contacts, and other information in a PST, 
or personal storage, file. In general, most Outlook users don’t know about or need to know 
about their PST files, but when you start to move your mail around, these files can become 
important. You easily create PST files from your existing mail and add contents from a PST to a 
new mailbox. In effect, this lets you simply add your existing mail into Outlook without having 
to move all the mail from one server to another. Outlook’s flexibility in working with PST files is 
one of the keys to moving to Office 365 when you have existing mail to bring forward. 
Export from Outlook
Via a PST file, Outlook makes it easy to export the mail, contacts, calendar, and other settings from 
one account (or computer) and then import to another. This might sound technical, but it is really 
quite simple. In Outlook 2010, for example, follow these steps: 
1.	
Click the File tab.
2.	
Click Options.
3.	
Click Advanced.
4.	
Under Export, click Export.

	
Migration Options    127
5.	
Click Export To A File, and then click Next.
6.	
Click Outlook Data File (.pst), and then click Next.
7.		
Select the account to export, as shown in Figure 7-2, and ensure that the Include Subfolders 
option is selected. This will export all the settings, including mail, calendar, tasks, contacts, and 
notes. Click Next.
Figure 7-2 Select the account name to export all.
8.	
Click Browse to select where you want to save the Outlook Data File (.pst), enter a file name, 
click OK, and then click Finish.
When prompted, consider protecting your exported file with a password, because this file might 
contain valuable information.
Note  Using the PST file technique, you can export your entire previous profile or only spe-
cific pieces, such as contacts, mail, tasks, or any other information. This gives you the ability 
to be very precise in deciding what information you want to export.
Now you have a file that you can attach or import to your new profile when the time comes. See 
“Import Mail, Contacts, and Other Settings from a PST” and “Attach the PST to Your Outlook Profile as 
a Local Folder,” later in this chapter.
Use Connected Accounts 
A second option for moving your mail into Office 365 is to use Outlook Web App’s Connected 
Accounts feature. With Connected Accounts, you can configure your Office 365 mailbox to regularly 
copy mail from an external service into Office 365. When set up, Office 365 will periodically read the 
external mailbox to bring in new mail, but only mail. Connected Accounts does not read or import 
calendars, contacts, or other information from the external service. In addition, the mail from the 

128   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
external service is co-mingled with your Office 365 mail. For example, email read from a Hotmail 
account addressed to joe@hotmail.com is mixed in with messages addressed to joe@contoso.com by 
default, but you can create a rule to sort mail from Connected Accounts into its own folder. 
Connected Accounts is a great way to go, particularly when moving your custom domain to Office 
365. However, if you choose to use Connected Accounts, it is imperative that you import your mail 
from the previous provider before you validate your custom domain in Office 365. The following is an 
example workflow for migrating mail by using this method:
1.	
Configure Connected Accounts in Outlook Web App.
2.	
Wait until email is fully imported (this might take some time, depending on the volume of 
mail).
3.	
Set up Office 365 to use your domain name. Your existing mail service will stop receiving mail. 
All mail will now be received by Office 365 and be available through OWA.
4.	
Set up your desktop, including Outlook. Your mail from your previous mail service will be in 
your inbox.
5.	
Optionally, archive your old mailbox in Outlook. (Export it to a PST.)
6.	
Remove the old inbox from Outlook.
7.		
Remove the Connected Accounts settings from OWA.
For a more detailed explanation of the Connected Accounts feature, as well as instructions for 
creating rules in OWA, see Chapter 8, “Working with Outlook Web App.”
Export Calendar Settings
Calendars are an important part of most businesses. When you import mail to Office 365, in some 
cases—such as when you are using a POP email service—your calendar information is not migrated. 
Fortunately, most calendar systems support exchange information in the ICS (Internet calendar shar-
ing) format, also known as iCal. For example, you can export your Google calendar as follows: 
1.	
Log on to Google Calendar.
2.	
Choose the calendar that you want to export, and then click the down arrow in the My Calen-
dars box.
3.	
From the menu, select Calendar Settings.
4.	
Under Private Address, right-click the iCAL button, and then select Save As, Save Target As, or 
your browser’s equivalent language for saving to file.
5.	
Save the link to a file on your desktop or other easy to find location.

	
Set Up Your Desktop for Office 365    129
To export your calendar from Hotmail:
1.	
Log on to Hotmail, and then select Calendar.
2.	
Select Share, and then select My Calendar.
3.	
Select Send People A View-Only Link To Your Calendar.
4.	
Under Links That Show Event Details, click ICS: Import Into Another Calendar Application.
Figure 7-3 The ICS link for a Hotmail calendar.
5.	
Highlight the link as shown in Figure 7-3, and then press Ctrl+C to copy the link to your 
clipboard.
6.	
Start your browser, and then paste in the link as a URL, but change “webcals” to “http.”
7.		
Download the ICS file to a convenient location for use later.
Other online services, including Hotmail, support exporting calendar information in this way. When 
exported, you can import the ICS file into Outlook by using the import wizard. For details, see “Import 
Calendar Information by Using an iCAL File,” later in this chapter.
Set Up Your Desktop for Office 365
Now that you have your migration plans in order, you’re almost ready to set up your desktop. How-
ever, before you do, take a moment to review the Office 365 system requirements to ensure that you 
have everything you need. To check the formal list of requirements, access the online help by clicking 
the ? (Help) icon at the upper-right of the Admin portal, and then select Getting Started, followed 
by Software Requirements For Office 365. The resulting help page (http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/
en-us/office365-smallbusinesses/ff652564.aspx) details operating systems, browsers, and require-
ments for each service. 
In general, if your system can run Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2010, you can use Office 
365. However, as you know by now, Office 365 does not support Outlook 2003, so you must upgrade 
Office 2003 before you configure your desktop for Office 365. The upgrade process will keep your 

130   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
existing settings and give you more options to manage your existing mail. If you have a Mac, refer 
to the service description paper titled “Office 365 Support for Apple Mac and iOS devices” at http://
www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13602. In general, Office 365 works well with Apple 
systems, but there are significant details to consider. 
More Info If you’re interested in “roadmap” information, the Office 365 team blog at http://
community.office365.com/en-us/b/default.aspx has traditionally been the best place to get 
the official news when features are updated.
Download Steps
After you review your Outlook setup, you can begin setting up your desktop with confidence. The 
required software is located on the Downloads page shown in Figure 7-4. To access this page, on the 
Office 365 Home page, in the Start Here section, click Set Up Now. It’s also available there from the 
Downloads link under Resources.
Figure 7-4 The Downloads page.

	
Set Up Your Desktop for Office 365    131
You need to install Lync 2010 and then the Office 365 setup application, in that order. The setup 
application applies specific updates and configuration settings to your system to ensure that it works 
with Office 365. Before you begin, take a moment to consult the Lync 2010 System Requirements link 
in the Resources column. The link takes you to an online help document that explains that Lync 2010 
works with Windows 7, Windows Vista with Service Pack 2, or Windows XP with Service Pack 3. Apple 
Mac users should receive the Lync Server 2011 client when they select to install Lync. To make the 
best use of Lync Online, also consider using a webcam and voice headset with your computer. 
Why Is Software Sometimes Called a Client?
In this and other books, you will see software installed in your system, like Lync 2010 or Out-
look, called a client. Just as when you (the client) consume the services of an accountant (the 
provider), Lync 2010 consumes the services of Lync Online. Outlook consumes the services of 
Exchange Online. This is commonly referred to as the client/server model. The software on your 
computer, the client software, uses the services provided by the server. Any software on your 
system that connects to a service provider, including your web browser, is technically a client.
Install Lync 2010
It's simple to install Lync 2010. Just select the language and the proper version for your computer (see 
the sidebar “64 or 32 Bits?” if you need help determining this), and then click Install. The Lync 2010 cli-
ent will download. Follow the prompts to complete the installation. On the last screen, clear the Start 
Lync check box, as shown in Figure 7-5, and then click Close. It is best if you don’t start Lync 2010 
before running the Office 365 setup program. 
Figure 7-5 Clearing the Start Lync check box. 

132   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
64 or 32 Bits?
Before installing Lync 2010, you must specify whether to download the 64-bit or 32-bit version 
of the software. You must install the correct version, but if you choose the wrong one, the 
installer will tell you. To find out which to use, click Start on your desktop, right-click the Com-
puter (Windows 7) or My Computer (XP) icon, and then select Properties. If you have a 64-bit 
system, you’ll see a listing similar to Figure 7-6. For XP users, if the results do not state 64-bit, 
you have a 32-bit system.
Figure 7-6 System Properties showing a 64-bit Operating System in Windows 7.
In effect, 64-bit systems have significantly more “headroom” than 32-bit systems, meaning 
they can work with larger amounts of memory, have more space for running programs inter-
nally, and have other benefits that result in faster and more efficient operations. 
If Lync 2010 does launch, you must close it before you can run the Office 365 setup program. The 
easiest way to close the Lync 2010 client (you have a few choices) is to click the status under your 
name. This displays a menu of status options, as shown in Figure 7-7, with Sign Out and Exit at the 
bottom. Click Exit to close Lync 2010.
Run Office 365 Setup
You’re now ready to install the Office 365 setup software. The Office 365 setup program will inspect 
your system, add specific updates to your computer, and configure Microsoft Office and Lync 2010 to 
work with Office 365. 
On the Downloads page (see Figure 7-4), under step 2, Set Up And Configure Your Office Desktop 
Apps, click Set Up to download and start the Office 365 setup application. When prompted, enter 
your logon credentials, and then click Sign In.

After you successfully log on, you will see the screen shown in Figure 7-9. The setup program is 
ready to configure Outlook, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Lync. If you don’t want the setup program 
to configure a particular application for Office 365, clear the appropriate check box. This option is 
provided for companies that might already have Lync or other applications installed and don’t want 
the setup utility to interfere with the existing configuration.

Note the important message on the left: Microsoft Outlook Will Require Manual Configuration 
After The Setup Is Complete. As you will see, this is neither as ominous nor as manual as it sounds. 
After you click Continue and accept the service agreements, the setup utility will run. The final 
screen summarizes the updates that were applied and repeat the message about the manual configu-
ration requirement for Outlook (see Figure 7-10).
After you click Finish, you’re ready to complete the setup by starting your applications.
Complete the Lync 2010 Setup
Now that the Office 365 setup program has run, Lync 2010 is configured to run with Office 365. You 
can now start Lync 2010 and log on to Lync Online.
1.	
From the Start menu, open Microsoft Lync 2010.

Set Up Outlook
The “manual” configuration of Outlook referred to in the Office 365 setup utility would be better 
described as “almost completely automated.” The basic process using Outlook 2010 is as follows: 
More Info You can find step-by-step instructions for Outlook 2010, Outlook 2007, and 
Outlook for Mac 2011 in the article “Connect Outlook to This Account,” at http://help.outlook.

1.	
Start Outlook.
If you have installed but not yet configured Outlook, a setup wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-13. If you’ve already been using Outlook, the setup wizard does not appear. To create 
a new account for Office 365 within Outlook, click the File tab, and then above the Account 
Settings button, click Add Account.

When it is complete, click Finish, as depicted in Figure 7-16.
If you receive the message An Encrypted Connection Is Not Available, Click Next To Attempt An 
Unencrypted Connection, an error occurred during the setup process. There is no point in trying the 
unencrypted connections as offered, because Office 365 requires an encrypted connection. In this 
case, click Back and re-enter your credentials, taking care to enter the correct details.

Troubleshooting Outlook Setup
The Add New Account Wizard works smoothly when:
■
■
You can reach the Microsoft data centers on the Internet.
■
■
The credentials you entered are correct.
■
■
The user account is assigned a license for Exchange Online.
■
■
DNS is properly configured for your logon domain.
You can test these conditions by logging on to the Office 365 Portal at http://portal.microsoft 
online.com. Start by logging on with the same credentials you used when adding Office 365 to 
Outlook with the Add New Account Wizard. If you are authenticated, that proves you can reach 
the data center and the credentials you entered to log on are correct. Next, on the top menu 
bar, click Outlook. If Outlook Web Access starts successfully, you have verified that an Exchange 
Online license is assigned to the user. 
To test your DNS setup configuration:
1.	
Log on to the Office 365 Portal by using administrator credentials.
2.	
Under Admin Overview, click Domains.
3.	
Select the domain you are using for your Outlook setup (fabrikamfurniture.com in the 
example).
4.	
Click View Properties.
5.	
Click Troubleshoot Domain.
6.	
Select the option I Changed The Settings At My Provider More Than 72 Hours Ago, 
and then click Next.
You should see this result: The Name Server Records Are Correct. 
If all of the above conditions are true, Outlook will “auto-discover” the Office 365 account 
and set it up properly, as shown in Figure 7-17.

Import Mail, Contacts, and Other Settings from a PST
Your desktop is now set up for using Office 365. If you exported your prior mail, contacts, calendar, 
and other data mailbox to a PST file, now is the time to bring it into Outlook and Office 365. To make 
that information available in your new setup, you can merge the contents into your new mailbox, 
attach the PST to your Outlook profile as a local folder, or combine the two techniques for a custom 
setup.
Merge the Contents into Your New Mailbox 
The easiest and most common approach is to merge the contents of your PST file into your new mail-
box. The result is that all your old mail is imported into Office 365, using the same folder structure 
and with the same content as before. Choose this option when you want to import your contacts, cal-
endar settings, tasks, mail, and other details from your previous email account into your new Outlook 
account. The content will automatically be copied into your Office 365 online mailbox.

142   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
To import a PST using Outlook 2010:
1.	
Start Outlook.
2.	
Select File | Options | Advanced | Export.
3.	
Select Import From Another Program Or File, and then click Next.
4.	
Select Outlook Data File (.PST), and then click Next.
5.	
Browse to the PST file, choose how you want to manage duplicates, and then click Next.
Attach the PST to Your Outlook Profile as a Local Folder 
Attaching the PST as a local folder is a surprisingly useful and simple technique. Use this approach 
when you want contents of the PST to be separate from your Office 365 mailbox or you want to 
drag information from the PST into your Office 365 inbox. Dragging is preferable to an import (as 
described before) when you want to visually inspect and select content to move to Office 365. 
Figure 7-18 shows a PST called Previous Mail attached to Outlook.
Figure 7-18 Previous Mail is an attached PST. 
As you can see, the PST looks like a regular Outlook mailbox. You can work with the contents in the 
PST, reply to mail, and search its contents, which are indexed by Outlook.
To add the PST to Outlook 2010:
1.	
Start Outlook.
2.	
Select File | Open | Open Outlook Data File (PST).
3.	
Browse to the PST file, and then click OK.
That’s all there is to it! 

	
Import Mail, Contacts, and Other Settings from a PST    143
Selective Importing and Filtering
If you have requirements that are not met by simply merging or attaching the PST file, you can mix 
and match between the two. Examples include:
■
■
Instead of importing all content, select a single folder.
■
■
Keep the mail from your PST in one location by attaching it as a file, but merge the calendar 
entries and contacts from the PST into your main Inbox, using the import wizard. 
■
■
Merge mail from a specific user, date range, or other criteria.
These and other advanced filtering options are available in the importing wizard in Outlook 2010. 
Figure 7-19 shows the Filter window that appears when you click the Filter button in the Import Out-
look Data File Wizard page.
You can use the form shown in Figure 7-19 to filter by word, From, To, and Time (how old the mail 
is). The More Choices and Advanced tabs give you many more capabilities. In short, you have tools 
available to do refined importing from your PST file, if you require it.

Import Contacts and Other Data by Using a CSV File
For those using a system like Google Mail or Hotmail, you can export contacts and other data, such 
as tasks, to a CSV (comma-separated value) file. You can import this information by using the same 
wizard used to import the PST files. 
For example, to export and import contacts from Hotmail, perform the following:
1.	
Log on to Hotmail, select Options (upper right), and then click Export Contacts.
2.	
Enter the answer to the visual puzzle, and then click Export.
3.	
Enter a file name, and then save it to an easy-to-find location.
4.	
Start Outlook 2010.
5.	
Select File | Options | Advanced | Export.
6.	
Select Import From Another Program Or File, and then click Next.
7.		
Select Comma Separated Values (Windows), and then click Next.
8.	
Browse to the file, choose how to handle duplicates, and then click Next.
9.	
Select the Contacts folder, and then click Next.
10.	 Optionally, click Map Custom Fields to review the mapping of fields located in the CSV com-
pared to fields that are used in the Outlook contacts system. Make any appropriate changes, 
as required.
11.	 Click Finish.
Import Calendar Information by Using an iCAL File
When you need calendar information merged into your Office 365 system and it is not available in a 
PST file, you can import an iCAL file like those referenced in “Export Calendar Settings” under “Migra-
tion Options.” In that section, you saw how to create an iCAL file from Google. Other systems also 
support this common calendar file format. 
To import an iCAL file into Outlook 2010, perform the following:
1.	
Start Outlook 2010.
2.	
Select File | Options | Advanced-Export.
3.	
Select Import An iCalendar (.ics) Or vCalendar File (.vcs), and then click Next.
4.	
Browse to the .ics file to import.
5.	
Choose between opening the file contents as a new calendar in Outlook and importing entries 
into your existing calendar, as illustrated in Figure 7-20.

	
Next Steps    145
Figure 7-20 Choose to Open As New or Import the calendar.
If you select Open As New, you will manage the calendar individually from your main calendar and 
can view the entries side by side. This is preferred for situations in which you are viewing calendars 
that belong to other people or that are managed by other systems. In most cases, during setup of 
Office 365, you will want to select Import to add the calendar entries into your main calendar.
Next Steps
You’re now set up to use Office 365! The remaining chapters focus on how to configure and use the 
services rather than setup and deployment topics. First you’ll learn how to use Outlook Web App 
for not only accessing mail, but as a way to configure your email services. Then you’ll learn how to 
work with Outlook and Office 365, work with mobile devices, SharePoint Online, and Lync Online. By 
the end of the book, you’ll have a solid understanding of how the services work and how they work 
together.

Working with Outlook Web App
B
y using the Microsoft Office 365 web-based email application, Microsoft Outlook Web App 
(OWA), you can manage your email and calendar when you don’t have access to the Outlook 
application, but it also does a great deal more.
Both Outlook and OWA show the the contents of your Office 365 Exchange Online account, and, 
in many ways, they look and operate alike. For example, if you find a misplaced message in your Out-
look junk mail folder, you can right-click the message and mark it as safe. This updates a safe list that 
is also available in OWA and shows up in both programs. In addition, folders you create in your OWA 
Inbox appear in Outlook. 
Even though OWA and Outlook display the same information in many cases, they are different 
applications with different features, configurations, and capabilties. For example, Outlook signatures 
are not applied to mail you send from OWA. OWA has its own signature capability, meaning that if 
you use both services, you need to configure a separate signature in each. Plus, Outlook has many 
more features and capabilites for managing mail. Even so, because OWA is actually part of Microsoft 
Exchange Online, OWA has several unique features. For example, in OWA you can force a remote 
wipe of your cell phone in case it is lost or stolen, create public groups, and connect accounts to peri-
odically bring mail from other services to your Office 365 inbox. When you are the service administra-
tor, you can also administer Exchange Online in OWA and make adjustments to other people’s email 
settings. 
You can access OWA from almost any modern browser through the Office 365 Portal. Use the Out-
look link on the top menu or the Inbox, Calendar, and Options links listed under Outlook in the body 
of the page, as shown in Figure 8-1. 

148   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 8-1 The Office 365 end user portal showing links to OWA (Outlook).
Using OWA is straightfoward, and Microsoft has many online demonstrations for learning how 
to do the basics. Rather than focus on the those, this chapter highlights how to personalize and use 
OWA’s exclusive features. In addition, you’ll learn about the important choices that service administra-
tors can make for their users through OWA.
Note  From within OWA, add its URL to your favorites and quick launch bars so that you 
don’t need to return to the portal every time you want to access the program. To add to 
your favorites, press Ctrl+D. To add to your quick launch bar, just place your cursor in the 
address bar and drag the URL to the quick launch bar.
More Info You can find some good instructions regarding the general use of OWA at 
http://help.outlook.com; just keep in mind that not all the features detailed are available in 
Plan P1. Be sure that the help tip you are viewing displays the notice Applies to: Office 365 
for professionals and small businesses at the top.

	
Personalization    149
Personalization
You can use many of the settings in OWA to customize its look and behavior to suit your preferences. 
Taking some time to personalize the portal helps it better suit your needs and work the way you do. 
You have many ways to add a personal touch, from the way the portal looks to customizing signa-
tures for mail. The personalization process begins the moment you first access OWA.
Set the Language and Time Zone
The first time you access OWA, you see a simple configuration screen, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2 First access to OWA.
After you set the language and time zone options, you are presented with the main page, from 
which you can perform almost any email activity you need in day-to-day use. 

150   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Set Up Conversation View
Like Outlook 2010, OWA allows you to view your inbox, sorted by Date, From, To, Attachments, and 
other common email headings. It also has the capability to view your email by conversation. Rather 
than seeing every mail in sequence as it comes in, Conversation view groups together all mail related 
to a specific conversation.
Figure 8-3 shows the normal view of an inbox sorted by incoming date. Each message is shown 
individually. This is a great view for instantly identifying what mail is new, but it does not show which 
messages are part of the same conversation.
Figure 8-3 The default Inbox view.
To switch to Conversation view, just under the search box, click Arrange By, and then choose Con-
versation from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 8-4. The thread titled Vacation Special Brochure 
is expanded in the screen shot to show the email related to that conversation. The reading pane on 
the right shows all the messages in the conversation.

When collapsed, you see just one entry with a triangle next to the subject, indicating that the con-
versation can be expanded, as shown in Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5 Conversation view collapsed.
Many consider Conversation view a significant help in organizing increasing amounts of incoming 
information.
Add Instant Messaging Contacts to OWA
OWA is integrated with Lync Online in a number of ways. For example, you can see the online avail-
ability of your colleagues through the use of “presence” indicators. In Figure 8-6, the green indica-
tor shows that both Andy and Kim are currently online and available. This feature is also enabled in 
Outlook.

152   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 8-6 The Presence indicator in OWA.
In some cases, rather than replying by mail, it can be faster to start an instant messaging session. 
Because Andy can see that Kim is online, even if he is on the road and using a computer at a conven-
tion, he can right-click Kim’s name and start a web-based instant messaging session, as shown in 
Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7 Starting an IM session from an email in OWA.
What if you want to IM colleagues when you’re not viewing an email from them? Just add names 
to your IM Contact list (the menu option shown in Figure 8-7). You can also add IM contacts on the 
left side of the OWA screen by clicking Add Contact, located under the Contact List. After you’ve 
added a contact, every time you open OWA, you get a view of who is online and their availability. In 
addition, these contacts will be added to Lync 2010 when you use your regular PC.
You can start an IM session with anyone in your contact list right in your web browser. Contacts are 
shown at the lower left in Figure 8-8.

	
Personalization    153

Select a Theme
Just for fun, you can select a theme for OWA. Themes are strictly cosmetic and have no impact on 
Outlook or other settings. When you click the Options menu, you can see several choices, including 
Select A Theme (Figure 8-9).
Figure 8-9 The Options menu.

154   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
You can see additional themes by clicking the arrows next to the theme icons. Personally, I like the 
Finger Paints theme shown in Figure 8-10, but that’s just me. You’ll want to look for one that suits you. 
Unfortunately, you cannot customize the themes or add your own.
Figure 8-10 The Finger Paints theme.
Create a Signature
As mentioned earlier, signatures you create in OWA are not copied into Outlook, and vice versa. As a 
result, you will want to set up a signature in OWA for your outbound mail. To do so, click the Options 
menu, and then select See All Options, as shown in Figure 8-9. The resulting My Account screen 
has many uses, including links to features on the left and links to useful how-to articles on the right 
(see Figure 8-11).
Figure 8-11 The Account Options screen.
Next, click Settings to open the Settings Options window, as depicted in Figure 8-12, where you 
can enter your signature. Enter a new signature or copy the signature you use in Outlook, and then 
click Save.

	
Personalization    155
Figure 8-12 Creating a signature in OWA.
Configure Message Format, Read Receipts, and Other Settings
In addition to signatures, the Settings page has numerous configurations, including Message Format, 
Read Receipts, Reading Pane, and Conversations. In addition, you can enable display of the BCC field 
in this screen. 
The default settings for these options work well for most people, so you don’t usually need to 
make adjustments. Even so, you should read over each section so that you’ll know what choices are 
available and make adjustments to suit your preferences. Settings that you adjust here will not be 
applied to Outlook. 
Create a Rule to Send a Text Message to Your Phone 
Using rules in OWA, you can accomplish some very useful automation, such as marking a message as 
important, moving to a folder, or playing a sound when a message arrives that matches your speci-
fied selection criteria. Although many are common to both applications, the rules you have available 
to you in Outlook are much richer than those in OWA. Still, OWA supports one trick that is easy to set 
up and extremely useful: you can create a rule that will send a text message. Using a text message 
is a great way to ensure you are alerted when specific events occur. For example, I have set up one 
that notifies me when one of my websites is offline for any reason. You could set alerts for stock price 
events, receipt of orders, messages marked as important, or messages from specific individuals. 

156   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Note  You can set up the same texting capability in Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010; how-
ever, you must first configure an SMS account within Outlook. This is not necessary in OWA 
with Office 365. In addition, the OWA rule is not dependent on Outlook. The rule will fire 
anytime a message is received that fits your criteria.
When you click the Phones menu option on the left side of Outlook Web App and then click Text 
Messaging, you will see the setup window shown in Figure 8-13.
Figure 8-13 Configuring text messaging in OWA.
Click Turn On Notifications, and then select your locale and mobile operator from the resulting 
window (see Figure 8-14).

	
External Contacts    157
Figure 8-14 Select the locale and mobile operator for your cell phone.
The locale and mobile operator will vary depending on your location. If the mobile operator is 
not listed, this feature is not available to you at this time, but there is a possible workaround. Many 
cell phone companies provide a means to send a text message to a cell phone number by using a 
specially formed email address. For example, you can send a text message to a cell phone on the 
Verizon Wireless network by emailing the <phonenumber>@vtext.com, such as 4255551212@vtext.
com. When Verizon’s email system sees this address, it converts the email to a text message and sends 
it to the phone. Each cell phone carrier has its own format for this service, so you need to research the 
proper email address before configuring this. Using this special email address, you can set up a rule to 
forward the email as text message. 
External Contacts
Many small businesses rely heavily on Outlook Contacts to communicate with customers and business 
associates. When you add a contact to Outlook, you can easily locate the contact’s email address, 
phone, and other information, but that information will not be visible to others in your organization, 
unless you email them the contact card.

158   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Outlook Contact Cards
Outlook can make use of contact cards in several helpful ways, but many people don’t realize 
that you can email a contact card to other people. The receiver can quickly add the information 
to her contact list by double-clicking the attachment (and because Outlook uses a universal 
format for the card, called vCard, the receiver does not need to be using Outlook). This makes 
it easy to provide contact information to business associates and coworkers, as needed. You can 
also send others your contact card for easy inclusion into their contact system. This is an often 
overlooked and generally appreciated gesture, similar to exchanging business cards in a meeting.
By adding yourself to your Contacts in Outlook and then double-clicking your card, you 
can customize the details, including adding a picture and more information about you or your 
company. You can then insert your card into any email or include it in every email as your 
signature. If you do use an image with your card, consider a photo so that people recognize 
that they are talking to you. Use a low-resolution version suitable for email. In this way, your 
business associates are sure to have your current email, business address, phone, fax, cell, or 
any other information you want to include. 
For more information about using contacts as business cards, see http://office.microsoft.com/en-
us/outlook-help/create-and-share-contacts-as-electronic-business-cards-HA010356440.aspx?CTT=1.
Rather than emailing contact cards, you can share contacts with all members of your organization 
by adding them as an external contact to Office 365. When added to External Contacts, the contact’s 
name and email address are listed with your Office 365 users and groups in the Global Address List 
(GAL). An external contact has a globe next to the name, so you can quickly identify that the contact 
is not an internal user, as shown in Figure 8-15.
Figure 8-15 External contact is shown in the GAL with a globe next to the name.

	
External Contacts    159
External contacts are included as part of your company-wide address book (the GAL) and can be 
added to distribution lists. 
Create an External Contact
To create an external contact, at the top of the OWA screen, click Manage Myself, and then select 
My Organization, as shown in Figure 8-16. You cannot see this option unless you are logged on as a 
service administrator. 
Figure 8-16 To create an external contact, click Manage Myself, and then My Organization.
After selecting My Organization, you’ll notice a small but important change. Instead of saying Out-
look Web App in the upper left, it now says Exchange Server 2010, as shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-17 The Exchange administration console for Office 365.

160   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Adding external contacts is one of the few cases where you need to access the Exchange Adminis-
tration console. It's very easy to click into the administration pages through OWA, and notice that the 
pages look and act like OWA in many ways. For all practical purposes, you can think of OWA as a way 
to work with your email and, if you’re an administrator, to manage Exchange Online. 
Next, click External Contacts, and then complete the New External Contact form shown in Figure 
8-18.
The display name is the name shown in your address book that goes on the To line when sending 
email. By adding additional information, such the contact’s company or relationship to your business 
(vendor, agent, attorney, accountant, and so on), you can quickly provide details about the contact to 
users without having them open the contact’s card for information.
When you click Save, Exchange saves the contact, and it becomes available to users. 
Figure 8-18 A New External Contact form.

	
External Contacts    161
Add Details to the External Contact 
Adding the contact is just the first step. When you select the contact and then click Details, new 
options become available, as shown in Figure 8-19.
Figure 8-19 External contact details.
These new options include the following:
■
■
Contact Information  Use this section to add the contact’s address, phone, number, and any 
notes that you want associated with the contact.
■
■
Organization  In some cases, the external contact might have a manager in your organiza-
tion. You can represent that relationship by using the Organization section. Users can then see 
who manages the contact.
■
■
MailTip  Add a MailTip to alert users to details about the contact that will be shown before 
you send a message. A MailTip ensures that anyone sending mail to David will see the tip 
shown in Figure 8-20 and will know that he is a significant business partner before the mail is 
sent. MailTips can be used to flag competitors, potential customers, individuals you might be 
involved with legally, or other useful details.
Note  MailTips cannot be seen using Outlook 2007.

MailTips are one of the most popular features of Office 365. Several MailTips are built in. They auto-
matically alert you when your mailbox is almost full, if you are sending to a large distribution list, and 
display other concerns, as shown in Figure 8-21. Access the MailTips screen in Outlook 2010 by click-
ing File | Options | Mail, and then MailTips.
Figure 8-21 The MailTips automatically provided by Office 365.

	
Add and Administer a Distribution Group    163
The built-in MailTips are useful, but the real power lies in adding customized MailTips. Users can 
add MailTips to distribution groups that they create. Service administrators can add a MailTip to 
just about anything, including External Contacts, Distribution Groups, Users, and Conference Rooms 
(Resource Records).
You might use a MailTip to say, “This is an unmonitored mailbox” or “In Litigation with this vendor, 
do not email without authorization.” Keep in mind that MailTips are not shown in Outlook 2007.
Add and Administer a Distribution Group
A distribution group (sometimes called a distribution list) is a list of email addresses that you treat as 
one address. When you send an email to the group address, that message is delivered to all members 
of the group. For example, a group called support@contoso.com could contain the support staff and 
vendors who provide support for your organization. When someone emails support@contoso.com, 
all members of the group are notified. You can create distribution groups for in-house contacts (all 
employees, support staff, a specific project team), external contacts (all customers, all vendors, on-call 
consultants), or a combination (seminar registration, newsletter). In the next section, you use OWA to 
set up an example distribution group (public group) for all employees.
List Terminology
OWA, Outlook 2007, and Outlook 2010 all provide the ability to give a list of email addresses a 
name and then use that name as an email address. Although this book uses the term “distribu-
tion group” for such a list, each application uses a slightly different name and gives it a unique 
flavor. To decipher these, consult this list:
■
■
Public group  A distribution group created in OWA. The group is public because the 
group’s name is available in the company address book (GAL). All users of Office 365 in 
your organization can use this group for emailing, as shown in Figure 8-22. Note that the 
group’s visibility in the GAL can be disabled. 
Figure 8-22 A public group in the OWA default GAL.

■
■
Contact group  A distribution group created in Outlook 2010. This name is not visible to 
others unless you send it to someone in an email. Recipients can add the contact group 
to their contacts, but it does not appear to others in your organization when they look at 
the company address book in Outlook or OWA. In effect, it is a private list. 
■
■
Distribution list  The term used for a contact group in Outlook 2007.
■
■
Distribution group  The term used in Office 365 when administrators access the set-
tings for a public group.
In short (relatively speaking), when you create these groups in Outlook, they are private 
and are called contact groups (Outlook 2010) or distribution lists (Outlook 2007). User-created 
groups in OWA are called public groups and are shared. To administer this group, the service 
administrator accesses the Distribution Group features in Exchange Online. Refer to Figure 8-17, 
and note the Distribution Groups icon.
Create an All Employees Public Group
Normal users and administrators can create public groups and add members to the group, but only 
administrators can prohibit users from leaving a group or enable a group to receive mail from outside 
the organization. For purposes of example, suppose that you are logged on as the service administrator.
The process of creating a public distribution group has two main steps: first, create the group, and 
second, open the group to modify the details. This general procedure of "create and then modify" is 
common to many items in OWA.
To create a public group, click Groups in the left menu in OWA, as shown in Figure 8-23. 
Figure 8-23 Creating a public group in OWA.

	
Add and Administer a Distribution Group    165
In the Public Groups screen, under Public Groups I Own, click New. The New Group form appears, 
featuring four sections: General, Ownership, Membership, and Membership Approval.
1.	
Fill in the fields under General, as shown in Figure 8-24. All the fields marked with an asterisk 
(*) are required. The Alias and E-Mail Address fields cannot contain spaces.
Figure 8-24 The General section of the New Group form.
a.	
Display Name  Displays on the To line and in the shared address book.
b.	
Alias  Used to generate the email address.
c.	
E-mail address  In almost all cases, the same as the alias. If you have multiple domain 
names available, assign the domain by clicking the pull-down list.
d.	
Description  Optional description to inform users of the group’s purpose. This descrip-
tion is shown when users click Details on a selected group in OWA.
e.	
Make This Group A Security Group  Select this when you want to use the membership 
of this group for other purposes, such as allowing access to specific content in SharePoint 
Online. If the purpose of this group is strictly for mail, leave this cleared. You can convert 
a group to a security group later, if you decide to.
2.	
Expand the Ownership section, and add another owner if needed. 
The service administrator can always take ownership of a group if necessary. It’s a good prac-
tice to have more than one explicit owner to manage and moderate a group.

166   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
3.	
Expand the Membership section, and then click Add to add members to the list.
As the group owner, you can add group members (note that you do not need to add yourself). 
To create a list for all employees, add all regular employees to the list. 
4.	
Expand the Membership Approval section, and then choose the terms under which users can 
join or leave your group.
By default, public groups are set so that all your users can join the group and leave the group. 
The settings shown in Figure 8-25 are typical for a group that includes all employees. The 
membership is assigned by the group owners, and users cannot remove themselves.

Click Save. 
The group is created at this point, but you are not quite finished. Some important settings 
become available to you only after a group is created. 
6.	
Under Public Groups I Own, click the group name, and then click Details. This opens the public 
group form again, but now you see additional choices. Compare Figure 8-24 with Figure 8-26. 

	
Add and Administer a Distribution Group    167
Figure 8-26 New sections are available after you create a public group.
Compared to Figure 8-24, four additional sections have been added: Delivery Management, 
Message Approval, Email Options, and MailTips. Also, a new option called Hide This Group 
From The Shared Address Book is listed under the General section. Use this setting to hide 
groups from searches of the public address book. 
7.		
Expand the Delivery Management section, and then designate the individuals who are autho-
rized to send email to this group. 
By default, all internal users can send email to the list. By adding Andy and Karen, as shown in 
Figure 8-27, mail from any other user will be rejected.

Click Save. You’ve now completed the All Employees list. 
Use Distribution Groups with External Email Addresses
Frequently, a business needs to add one or more users to a distribution group who are not a part of 
the organization. To add a user with an external email address to a distribution group, first create an 
external contact for the user, as described previously in the External Contacts section of this chapter. 
Then add the contact to a distribution group just as you would add a user. Next you need to enable 
the group to allow external mail.
Allow All External Users to Send Mail to the Group
By default, a public group is set to receive incoming mail only from members of your organization. 
This prevents people outside of your organization from sending to the group. Even if you explicitly 
add an external contact to the group, that contact will receive mail from the group but cannot send 
mail to the group. 
To allow your external contact to send email to a group, in the Delivery Management section of 
the Public Groups screen, click the Senders Inside And Outside Of My Organization radio button (see 
Figure 8-27). This setting opens the list to receive mail from the world. Figure 8-28 shows a sugges-
tion box distribution list set to accept all mail.

	
Add and Administer a Distribution Group    169
Figure 8-28 A distribution group set to accept all mail.
This is perfect for a group like suggestions@contoso.com or applications@contoso.com, where 
you want unknown others to send mail to members of the group. But when you want to allow only 
specific external users to send to the group, you must designate which users are permitted. 
Restrict Senders to the Group
Allowing anyone from anywhere to send mail to the group can be very useful but is too permis-
sive for groups that require a specific membership. To restrict who can send to the group, just add 
approved names to the form (Figure 8-28). To add an external name, the user must first be added as 
an external contact. 
Get Creative (Groups Within Groups)
You can add distribution groups to other distribution groups. Although this might be overly com-
plicated for many businesses, it can be quite useful in certain cases. For example, suppose that you 
wanted to receive email externally from anyone and wanted incoming mail to the group to be dis-
tributed to everyone in your organization. To configure this, you would need to manually add all the 
members of your organization to the Membership section of the group, one at time. 
As an easier alternative, you can create your group, set it to receive mail from all external users, 
and then add the All Employees distribution group rather than individual email addresses. Using 
this as an example, you can get creative about how to receive and distribute incoming mail by using 
distribution groups.

170   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When Not to Use Distribution Groups
Office 365 works great for many common business scenarios, but there are a couple of uses that I 
would not recommend.
Public Email Discussion Groups 
Public email discussion groups (also called email discussion lists) are very popular on the Internet. 
Some organizations host these groups to facilitate their business interests. For example, it wouldn’t be 
uncommon for a nonprofit organization with the goal of raising money for a certain cause to host an 
email discussion group of people sympathetic to that cause. 
Office 365 has the basic capabilities needed to host such a list. You can add external contacts to 
a discussion group, and Office 365 will receive and deliver mail for all the users. But email discussion 
groups require more than just the ability to deliver mail. For example, email discussion groups gener-
ally allow users to automatically subscribe and unsubscribe from the list. On most lists, recipients 
can find instructions on how to unsubscribe at the end of every message. In addition, servers that 
host these groups (called list servers) are often specifically designed for this purpose so that you can 
manage mail loops, bounces, email flooding, and other issues that can occur when you provide a mail 
delivery service to a group of unrelated individuals or organizations. 
Office 365 would work well for this purpose only if a group is small and doesn’t change much. For 
example, I would not hesitate to create a list of this sort for a special interest group of 10–20 people. 
Otherwise, given the manual administration of email addresses and other mail list–related issues, you 
probably would be better served by a service designed for this purpose. A quick search for “host your 
own email discussion group” will reveal many good options.
Email as a Business
Office 365 is well designed to provide email services for your business, but it is not designed to pro-
vide email services as a business. In other words, if your business is providing a server that uses email 
extensively, such as the distribution of newsletters to tens of thousands of users or other commercially 
focused, large email loads, it would be advisable to purchase services designed for this use. Office 365 
has built-in email delivery throttles on messages per second and limits regarding how many emails 
can be sent from a single address each day. These limits are placed on the service to prevent overuse 
of resources by individual accounts, thereby protecting performance for all users. These limits are not 
encountered in general use but would likely be an issue in a commercial delivery service. 
The current limits are published at http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/dd630704.aspx.
Join a Public Group
Users can add themselves to a group or request to be added, depending on your Membership 
Approval settings, by clicking Join on the Public Groups page as shown in Figure 8-29. Users cannot 
join a group by sending a “subscribe” email to the group address.

	
Connected Accounts: Add an Existing Mail Service to Office 365     171
Figure 8-29 Joining a public group.
Connected Accounts: Add an Existing Mail Service to 
Office 365 
OWA has a unique and very useful feature called Connected Accounts, which is discussed in Chapter 
7, “Desktop Setup and Migration.” You can use Connected Accounts to add mail to your Inbox from 
Google Mail, Hotmail, or other email services. After connecting a mailbox, OWA continues to read 
the mail from the external service every hour; when you log on to OWA, it adds new messages to 
your Inbox from that account. All users in your Office 365 organization have access to this feature. To 
access the Connected Accounts feature, log on to OWA, click Options, and then select All Options. 
Then, click Connected Accounts, as shown in Figure 8-30.
Figure 8-30 The Connected Accounts window in OWA.

172   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
To add a connected account, just click New and type in the email address and password. If pos-
sible, Office 365 connects to the account and starts to import the existing mail. If the connection fails, 
be sure that you are entering the correct information. Most providers use industry standard settings, 
but some don’t. In those cases, you will need to provide additional information, such as the protocol 
type and port numbers. The service provider for your connected account will have this information 
available. 
For example, to add a Google Mail as a connected account, you need to enable POP access on 
Google Mail. Log on to your Google Mail account, and select Settings | Forwarding and then POP/
IMAP. Under POP, select Enable POP For All Mail (Even Mail That’s Already Been Downloaded) to copy 
all your mail copied to Office 365. You can also instruct Google Mail to keep the mail even after it has 
been downloaded. If you have a large mailbox, it can take quite a while (potentially more than a day) 
for several gigabytes of mail to be copied.
After the initial transfer, you can create a rule that identifies mail coming into the connected 
account and moves it to a specified folder. You can find a good help file topic about connected 
accounts with a short video showing how to set it up, including creating a sorting rule, at http://help.
outlook.com/en-us/140/cc511377.aspx.
Keep in mind that even though this feature imports mail from your connected account, it does not 
bring over contacts, calendars, or other information.
Send Email from Your Connected Account Address
You can send mail from your connected email account address even though you’re using OWA (or 
Outlook) in Office 365. Simply click From, as shown in Figure 8-31, and then select the connected 
account address. 
Figure 8-31 Sending from the connected account.
Be advised, however, that users will not get an email that looks exactly as if you have replied from 
that connected account service. Instead, they will receive a message that says it was received “on 
behalf” of the service, as shown in Figure 8-32.

	
Add and Administer a Conference Room     173
Figure 8-32 Mail sent on behalf of the connected account.
The “on behalf of” message is necessary so that mail coming from Office 365 does not look like it 
originated from another service. This message cannot be turned off or customized. 
Frequency of Reading Mail from Connected Account
When you first set up your connected account, depending on the service and the volume of mail in 
your mailbox, it can take several hours for the mail to fully replicate into Office 365. The length of 
time depends on the service provider and the amount of mail you have saved in that mailbox. In addi-
tion, new messages to your connected account are brought over approximately every hour. You can 
get mail on demand by logging on to OWA. 
If you need to see mail that you receive in your connected account in real time, using a connected 
account is not the way to go. In this case, consider adding the account to Outlook. You will then 
have an inbox in Outlook for your Office 365 mail as well as your external account. When you open 
Outlook or click Send/Receive, Outlook will refresh both inboxes, retrieving all available mail. This is a 
good way to go when you plan to keep using your external account and need real-time access to new 
mail. 
If you instead wish to consolidate all your mail and use only one account, after the mail is in your 
Office 365 inbox, you can disable the connected account. Simply select the account in OWA, and click 
Delete. At that time, mail will stop being imported from the external service. 
Add and Administer a Conference Room 
Many small businesses have resources that need to be scheduled for use. Using Office 365, service 
administrators can create a resource mailbox designed for this purpose. This mailbox is called a room 
mailbox and does not require an Office 365 license. Even though this feature is called a room mailbox, 
you can use it for any resource that requires scheduling—delivery vans, digital projectors, or large 
format printers.

174   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Anyone can see whether the resource is available simply by adding the resource’s email address to 
a meeting request, just as you would add a user. Because the room mailbox is listed with your users, 
contacts, and groups in the company’s email directory in Outlook and OWA, adding the address is a 
simple task of pointing and clicking. You can then view the free/busy schedule of all the users and the 
selected resource on one screen, as shown in Figure 8-33. This makes selecting an available time for 
everyone much easier. Optionally, when you send the meeting request, the resource will automatically 
accept it and block the time, showing the reserved time as busy for others who view the calendar.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
After creating the room, select the room and click Details to add a MailTip or to review your set-
tings. MailTips can be particularly useful when rooms or resources have information that you want to 
communicate to others before they send a meeting request. For example, “digital projector not work-
ing,” “teleconferencing equipped,” or “CC: Andy when reserving this room.” You can set maximum 
occupancy for a room, as well.
Customize a Room Mailbox
You can adjust the following settings for a room mailbox:
■
■
Automatically accept meeting requests.
■
■
Disable reminders.
■
■
Set maximum number of days in advance that a resource can be booked.
■
■
Set maximum time (in minutes) to allow for a meeting request.
■
■
Allow scheduling only during working hours.
■
■
Allow repeating meetings.
■
■
Allow conflicts.
■
■
Set scheduling Permissions:
•	 Specify who can automatically schedule the resource.
•	 Identify users who can submit a request that must be approved before scheduling.
•	 Identify users who can automatically schedule the resource and automatically submit a 
request for approval if the resource is unavailable.
■
■
Allow additional text to be sent in response to requests.
To access these settings, you use the “working on behalf” feature of OWA that is available only to 
administrators.

Use OWA to Configure Other Users’ Mailboxes
In addition to managing settings, service administrators can use the Select Others option under 
the Select What To Manage menu (Figure 8-16) to manage settings for any Office 365 user. 
When you access the user’s account in this way, you can configure all the settings the user can 
access in the OWA options pages. This enables you to inspect, troubleshoot, and configure a 
user’s settings from a browser without having to know their password. Note that you cannot 
read another user’s mail by using this feature. 
Wipe Your Cell Phone
Another valuable OWA feature is the ability for users to remotely wipe their cell phones. This is a fea-
ture that isn’t critical until a company phone is lost or stolen, and suddenly you will be glad you have 
Office 365. To access this option, log on to OWA, select All Options from the Options menu, and then 
click Phone on the menu at the left of the screen. 

178   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 8-37 Wiping a mobile phone.
In the Mobile Phones screen (see Figure 8-37), select the phone and then select Wipe Device. You 
will be told that the device will be wiped and asked to confirm the action. Keep in mind that when 
you wipe a phone, all the data on the phone is permanently erased. When approved, the status for 
the phone will change from OK to Wipe Pending. The next time the phone connects to the service, it 
will be wiped.
If a user has lost the phone but cannot access OWA to initiate wipe, use the administrator’s option 
to manage another user’s account (as detailed in the sidebar “Use OWA to Configure Others Users’ 
Mailboxes”) to access this menu on the user’s behalf and initiate the wipe. 
Enable and Configure the Personal Archive
A personal archive is a separate cloud-based mailbox that contains mail that is past a designated age. 
The archive mailbox appears as a separate mailbox in OWA and Outlook. You can drag mail into the 
archive and set policies that control both when to move mail into the archive and how long it should 
be retained.

	
Enable and Configure the Personal Archive    179
Suppose that you don’t have a cloud-based archive. Where is your old mail stored? Outlook is con-
figured to ask you periodically if you want to archive your old mail. Mail archived by Outlook is stored 
in a PST file on your PC. If the PST files are lost or corrupt, your history goes with it. Another problem 
with PST files surfaces when you need to search your email history for legal or business reasons. This 
can be challenging when dealing with PST files over the course of years.
The Office 365 personal archive addresses both of these issues. Because your archive is in the 
cloud, you don’t have to be concerned about backups or losing the data. In addition, the archives 
inbox can be searched like any other mailbox, making discovery much easier. Finally, you can use 
policy to automatically move mail from an inbox to the archive so that it is self-maintained. This policy 
can be applied to everyone in your business so that everyone is archiving email in a consistent way. 
If mail needs to be recovered from archive, the policy makes it easy because it has defined how that 
mail was archived. In the event of legal action, an enforced archive policy makes discovery easier. 
Outlook Auto-Archive vs. Personal Archive
Although auto-archive and personal archive sound similar, they are very different features. 
Outlook’s auto-archive feature is built into Outlook, so Outlook has to run for the feature to 
work. You have probably seen the auto-archive from Outlook before. Outlook’s auto-archive 
is easy to use and automatically moves older messages to a local PST file. However, because 
those PST files are stored on your PC (and everyone else in your business has theirs stored on 
their PCs), they are easily lost. The personal archive, on the other hand, is a cloud mailbox, and 
policy rules are stored in Office 365. Mail is archived according to the policy, even if you never 
open Outlook. In addition, the personal archive is backed up by Microsoft, so you don’t have to 
worry about securing PST files. 
When using the personal archive, keep in mind that the Office 365 archiving policy to move 
old mail into the personal archive does not move mail in Outlook’s local archive. Mail must be 
in your Inbox or one of its subfolders to be automatically moved to the cloud-based archive. 
Now that you have Office 365, you should turn off auto-archive in Outlook 2010 by clicking File 
| Options | Advanced | Auto-Archive, and then clearing the check box next to Run Auto Archive 
Every __ Days.
Important  Your Exchange Online inbox has a 25 GB limit that is shared with your personal 
archive. The size of your archive plus your inbox cannot exceed 25 GB.

180

To enable the personal archive for a mailbox, perform the following:
1.	
Log on to OWA by using your administrator credentials. 
2.	
Click Options, and then click See All Options to go to the Account Options window, as shown 
in Figure 8-11. 
3.	
Hover over My Account, and then click Manage My Organization, as shown in Figure 8-16.

Expand the Mailbox Features section.
6.	
Select Archive, and then click Enable.
7.		
Enter a name for the archive or accept the default, and then click Save.

Click Save again.
Now, when you view your Inbox in OWA or Outlook, you will see an Archive mailbox along with 
your normal inbox, as shown in Figure 8-38.
Figure 8-38 An archive mailbox in OWA.
The archive mailbox will be empty until the policy service inspects and moves mail to the archive. 
You can also move mail to the archive manually (by dragging it) or by using rules. 

	
Enable and Configure the Personal Archive    181
Enable and Apply Archive Policy
Although you can’t really tell by looking, a default archive policy has been applied to users, which 
instructs Office 365 to move mail that is more than two years old to the archive. Alternatively, you can 
choose to archive after one year or not to archive at all. To enable one of these alternative policies, 
perform the following:
1.	
Log on to OWA by using your Office 365 credentials. 
2.	
Click Options, and then click See All Options to go to the Account Options window, as shown 
in Figure 8-11. 
3.	
On the left menu, click Organize Email, click Retention Policies, and then click Add.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Now when you right-click a folder or mail item in OWA, you see two new menu options: Archive 
Policy and Retention Policy. Figure 8-40 shows the right-click menu for the Inbox, with the Archive 
Policy menu selected. The green check mark adjacent to Use Folder Policy means that the default set-
tings are in place. Recall that the default archive setting is to move mail that is two years old or more 
to the archive. Selecting a different archive policy for the inbox automatically applies the new policy 
to all mail in the Inbox. The exception to this rule is that folder policy is not applied to any individual 
mail item with a different policy applied.
Figure 8-40 Applying an archive policy to a folder.

	
Enable and Configure the Personal Archive    183
Note  You can add custom archive policies by using advanced techniques involving a script-
ing language called Windows PowerShell. PowerShell commands for Office 365 are beyond 
the scope of this book. If you need a more advanced archiving policy, consider using a 
consultant or Microsoft Partner to assist with the setup. As an alternative, in Outlook (not 
OWA), you can create rules to move or copy mail to the archive folder to fit criteria that you 
designate. One of the options is to move mail that is received on, before, after, or between 
specific dates. You can also set the rule to copy the message rather than move the mes-
sage. This gives you a lot of flexibility in deciding exactly what kinds of messages should 
be moved or copied to the archive and when. You can also import a PST into your personal 
archive, providing a convenient way of moving existing archives into the cloud. You import 
mail to the archive the same way you would to your Inbox. Instructions about how to create 
and import PST files are provided in Chapter 7, “Desktop Setup and Migration.”
Enable and Apply Retention Policy
A retention policy controls how long an item is in your inbox before it is deleted. For most small busi-
nesses, retention policies are better handled by using rules or Auto-Archive in Outlook. This provides 
much greater flexibility in determining which mail you want to delete, archive, or keep in your inbox. 
The retention policies available in Plan P1 are shown in the first three rows and have Delete listed 
as the Retention Action. The following policies are available: delete mail after a month, a week, or 
never delete. By default, when you enable the personal archive, the retention policy on your mailbox 
is set to Never Delete. 
If you want Office 365 to automatically delete messages that are one week old or one month old, 
you can enable the policies by selecting them from Retention Policies options (Figure 8-39). Then, 
when you right-click a folder or email items (as shown in Figure 8-40), you can select Retention Policy 
and apply the desired policy to the item.
As with archive policy, retention policies can be customized by using advanced techniques that are 
beyond the scope of this book. For more information about archive and retention policy, see http://
help.outlook.com/en-us/140/cc950504.aspx.

Outlook 2010 and the Personal Archive
With some versions of Outlook 2010, you can apply retention and archive policies to fold-
ers and mail in the same way that you can in OWA. The specific details about which versions 
of Outlook 2010 are supported for this are a bit fuzzy, but it appears that volume-licensed 
editions of Outlook 2010 are supported as well as stand-alone retail versions of Outlook 2010 
(http://office.microsoft.com/client/helppreview14.aspx?AssetId=HA102576659&lcid=1033&NS=O
UTLOOK&Version=14&CTT=3). This means that if you bought Microsoft Office 2010 as part of 
any retail package, such as Home Office and Professional, the policy capabilities are not shown 
in Outlook. 
Figure 8-41 shows the personal archive mailbox just beneath the normal Inbox. So even 
though your version of Outlook might not allow you to right-click and apply policy, the per-
sonal archive is still available for searching, manually adding content, importing PSTs, and using 
rules to move mail to your cloud archive.

For More Information
Microsoft has done a good job of providing how-to videos for using OWA. You can find these in the 
help documents at http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/gg605090.aspx. In particular, the article “Set Up 
Your Email Account on Your Mobile Phone” gives you a preview of some of the topics covered in our 
next chapter on mobile devices.

Working with Mobile Devices 
O
ne the best features of Microsoft Office 365 is the ability to connect to it by using a mobile 
device. Using your email-enabled phone, for example, you can keep in touch with the flow of 
information related to your business, which can both save time and improve your professionalism. 
Here’s a common example: you’re on the campus of a large company to talk to a manager about 
a potential business opportunity. When you check in at the receptionist desk, you realize you don’t 
know the number of the conference room where you are to meet. This one is easy. Just look at your 
phone! Because your phone is synchronized with your Calendar, using Office 365, you’ll see an alert 
that the meeting is starting in five minutes. The alert displays the conference room number right next 
to the meeting start time. You wind up in the correct conference room, right on time. 
Today’s most popular phones all work well with Office 365, from Microsoft phones to the iPhone, 
Droid, and BlackBerry. Most mobiles devices provide the ability to connect to an Microsoft Exchange 
server, which allows your phone to synchronize email, calendar, contacts, and tasks with Office 365. 
You can also use your mobile device to view and (depending on your phone’s capability) edit Office 
documents from Microsoft SharePoint Online. 
Putting on your administrator hat for a minute, if company employees are using Office 365 with 
their mobile devices, you might want to ensure that those devices are secure, using PINs and pass-
words. OWith Office 365, you can designate which users can synchronize email to their phone and to 
enforce specific policies on those phones, such as requiring a PIN or strong password. In addition, you 
can configure new phones so that they are “quarantined” until approved. 
In Chapter 8, “Working with Outlook Web App,” you saw how to set up Office 365 to wipe your cell 
phone if it is lost or stolen, and to send a text message when a specific email arrives. In this chapter, 
you’ll delve deeper into connecting Office 365 with your mobile device, from setting up email to 
working with SharePoint. In addition, you’ll learn how to implement phone policies via the Admin 
portal. 
Windows Phones
Microsoft’s latest phone is called Windows Phone 7.5; it has built-in support for Office 365. Behind 
the scenes, Microsoft uses an auto-discover technology that makes adding your Office 365 account 
as simple as typing in the account’s email address and password. In addition, you can add a Hotmail 

186   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
or other account to the phone and manage them both at the same time. You can view your personal 
and business calendars simultaneously in Office 365, as shown in Figure 9-1. 
Figure 9-1 Windows 7.5 Phone Calendar integrated with Office 365.
Contacts that you add to Office 365 (as described in Chapter 8) are automatically downloaded to 
the phone. When a contact calls you, his name appears, telling you at a glance who is calling. 
Windows Mobile Phone 7.5 includes the Mobile Office feature that contains a mobile version of 
Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft OneNote, and Microsoft Excel. These mobile apps 
work very well to render a SharePoint Online document, allowing you to view and edit documents on 
your phone. 
More Info You can find a Microsoft-produced video about connecting a Windows 
Mobile 7.5 phone to Office 365 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-cLV3DbD4E.
If you have an older Windows phone, you’re still in great shape. You can set up your phone as if 
it were connecting to an Exchange server. When connected, you have all the same benefits of Office 
365, including calendar, contacts, alerts, and other features. However, keep in mind that the ease of 
use of a 7.5 phone is significantly advanced compared to Windows 6.x phones. With a 7.5 phone, you 
have threaded conversations, social networking, mobile office, Lync Mobile, and thousands of apps 
that you can easily download. For years, my Windows 6 Motorola Saga was a reliable partner that 
saved the day many times because it was connected to my Exchange Online account at Microsoft. 
Now that I use a Windows Phone 7.5, there is no going back. 

	
BlackBerry    187
Exchange ActiveSync Devices
The majority of modern mobile devices work well with Office 365 and Exchange Online. If the phone 
you have or are considering has Exchange ActiveSync support, chances are it will work fine. Exchange 
ActiveSync is the software provided by the phone’s manufacturer for connecting to and synchronizing 
with an Exchange server, such as those used by Office 365.
Although Exchange ActiveSync was created by Microsoft, it is licensed to phone manufacturers 
who then create their own versions. As a result, the specific details of exactly how to connect to Office 
365 can vary, as do the specific features. To bring some standardization to the feature set, Micro-
soft created the Exchange ActiveSync Logo Program (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/
gg187968.aspx). The devices listed on the Logo Program page are certified to comply with the 
features needed to ensure a good experience with Office 365. As of this writing, Nokia, Apple, and 
Microsoft phones are listed.
In addition, Microsoft provides the following online resources to assist with setting up mobile 
devices: 
■

At http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/cc511380.aspx, you’ll find a video of setting up a Win-
dows Mobile 6.5 device that uses ActiveSync. 
■
■
At http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/cc825479.aspx, the Mobile Phone Setup Wizard walks 
you through the setup process for Droid, Android Tablet, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Nokia, and 
Microsoft phones. This wizard is covered in more detail later in the chapter.
■
■
At http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13602, the 365 Mobility Solutions 
Service Description is the official document stating what is and is not possible and what is sup-
ported for mobile devices with Office 365. The nature of cloud services is such that features 
and capabilities change faster than software you normally purchase. Check this document 
regularly for updates. 
BlackBerry
Office 365 supports BlackBerry operating systems 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, and 5.0, and Microsoft plans to sup-
port future releases. As of this writing, BlackBerry Enterprise Services (BES) services offered by RIM are 
not available in Plan P1. BlackBerry users can use BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) to connect to Office 
365. The difference between BES and BIS is that with BIS you are essentially accessing Outlook Web 
App (OWA) in your mobile browser. That’s quite a bit different from having a mailbox client on your 
phone. The BES experience is preferred but, as mentioned, is available only in the Office 365 E plans.

The Mobile Phone Setup Wizard
Microsoft publishes a wizard that provides instructions for a variety of phones. You can find the 
wizard at http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/dd936215.aspx. Start the wizard, select your phone (see 
Figure 9-2), and then follow the subsequent instructions to set up your phone for Office 365. 
Figure 9-2 The Mobile Phone Setup Wizard.
For some phones, such as a Windows Phone 7+, your email setup should require you to enter only 
user name and password. However, not all phones can take advantage of the behind-the-scenes 
auto-discover capabilities that make this possible. As a result, your phone’s setup process might 
prompt you to enter server information about your Office 365 mail service. If your phone is listed in 
the Mobile Phone Setup Wizard, you might be guided through the following process. Also, if your 
device does not support Exchange ActiveSync, you can try connecting to the service by using other 
methods, such as POP, IMAP, or SMTP. POP is generally used for receiving mail and SMTP is used for 
sending mail, while IMAP can do both. Your phone might support these protocols to allow you to 
connect to a wide variety of services.
You can find connection details about your mailbox by logging on to OWA, clicking Options, and 
then clicking Show All Options. On the My Account page, click Settings for POP, IMAP, and SMTP 
access, as shown in Figure 9-3.

	
The Mobile Phone Setup Wizard    189
Figure 9-3 The settings for Pop, IMAP, and SMTP shown in OWA.
Note that the server name (in this example, pod51010.outlook.com) is shown in all the settings. 
Use this server name when asked by your phone setup wizard for the URL or server name for the mail 
server. Additional settings are shown for the other protocols you might use.
Important  Microsoft recently introduced a new “universal” server name for mobile ac-
cess. Rather than configuring your service with the server name shown in OWA, Microsoft 
recommends using m.outlook.com. The universal name was introduced because the server 
listed in OWA can change due to routine maintenance or because of a fail-over event at the 
data center. If your phone is configured to use m.outlook.com, when your phone connects 
to Office 365, the connection will be routed to the right server. 
At the time of this writing, Microsoft documentation was not yet updated with this in-
formation. Android (and possibly other) phone users have reported problems using the 
m.outlook.com address. Both Microsoft and Google are working on updates. In this case, 
use the address found in OWA. If you are interested, you can read a technical article on this 
at http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2012/02/07/cross-site-redirection-exchange-
activesync-clients-in-office-365.aspx.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Use SharePoint Online with a Mobile Device 
SharePoint Online can interact with mobile devices in a variety of ways. The most commonly used 
activity is to access an Office document stored in a SharePoint document library. Some phones have 
apps either built in or downloadable, with which you can open and work with Office documents. The 
specifics of these capabilities depend on the combination of phone and application you use to access 
the documents. 
Windows 7.5 or 6.5 Phone 
Using SharePoint Workspace Mobile 2010, you can interact with and synchronize content from Share-
Point Online; it is available on Windows 7.5 and Windows 6.5 phones. You can open and edit docu-
ments in Word Mobile 2010, Excel Mobile 2010, or PowerPoint Mobile 2010.
Windows Phone 7.5 interacts with SharePoint Online from the Office Hub (see Figure 9-4), where 
you can sync with the SharePoint Online site or download documents for offline work. You can then 
save the documents back to SharePoint Online to allow others to access your work. 
Figure 9-4 Windows Phone 7 Office Hub.
Syncing to documents from SharePoint Online with a Windows Phone 7.5 device is easy:
1.	
Open the Office Hub on the phone.
2.	
Locate the SharePoint section, as shown in Figure 9-2.
3.	
Tap Open URL.

	
Use SharePoint Online with a Mobile Device     191
4.	
Type the URL of your team site, and then press the forward arrow. If you don’t know the URL 
of the site, log on to https://portal.microsoftonline.com with your credentials, and then click 
Team Site. 
Important  Your phone will automatically enter “https://” and place the cursor so that you 
can start typing after https:// to complete the entry for the URL to your team site. As of this 
writing, SharePoint Online does not support https://. So to successfully connect, you must 
change https:// to http://, and then type the remainder of your URL.
5.	
Enter your Office 365 credentials, and then tap Sign In. You might be asked to log on a few 
times during the process.
6.	
Browse to the document library (such as Shared Documents) that contains the file that you 
want to take offline.
7.		
Press and hold the file name until a menu opens.
8.	
Select one of the two options presented. Download Now downloads the file to the phone 
for you to work on. When you save the file, it is automatically updated on SharePoint Online. 
Always Keep Offline saves the document to your phone. You can then edit the document and 
manually upload to SharePoint Online later.
Using the Office Hub that comes on the Windows Phone 7+, you can access and edit documents 
on SharePoint Online as well as take notes with OneNote Mobile and sync those notes back to 
SharePoint.
More Info You can find out more about the Office Mobile Workspace on Windows 
Phone 7.5 at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/apps/office.aspx.
Special URL for Mobile Display of SharePoint Online Sites
Modern phones make it easy to navigate webpages simply by flicking the display up, down, 
right, and left, as well as magnify it by using gestures. However, older devices might not sup-
port this kind of browser. SharePoint Online has a special mode just for mobile devices that are 
HTML 4.0–compliant (and most are): just append /?Mobile=1 to the URL to instruct SharePoint 
to deliver a page specially rendered for mobile viewing. For example, if your URL is http://
sharepoint.com/sites/contoso, the mobile viewing URL would be http://sharepoint.com/sites/
contoso/?Mobile=1. More up-to-date devices might not require this URL because with the built-
in browser technology, you can effectively navigate larger, more complex webpages.

192   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Other Phones and Mobile Devices
Most phones and mobile devices, such as an iPhone or iPad, can access SharePoint Online by using 
apps or the built-in browser. Because SharePoint Online is a web-based application, you can browse 
to the site and interact with the applications and content presented. You’ll be able to open and work 
with Office documents, depending on the capabilities of your phone and apps.
Microsoft Lync 2010 Mobile 
Microsoft offers Lync 2010 Mobile clients for several mobile devices, including:

Using Lync Mobile, you can instant message others in your organization or other users of Lync 
Online who are accessible through Lync 2010. The ability to instant message users outside of your 
organization is covered in Chapter 12, “Working with Lync Online.”
If you manage your own DNS services, depending on when you configured your services, you 
might need to update DNS for the mobile client to work. If Microsoft hosts your DNS services, the 
required settings for Lync 2010 Mobile are added for you. For details, see http://community.office365.
com/en-us/w/lync/1040.aspx.
Mobile Device Administration
As the services administrator, you can log on to the administration portal and administer the services 
from your phone. In addition, you have several tools at your disposal to control how users of your 
service access Office 365 from a mobile device. You can control who can access their mail by using 
ActiveSync, and you can configure policies that apply to all users, such as requiring your mobile users 
to employ the use of a PIN on their device to unlock it. Office 365 has a rich set of capabilities in this 
area, extending beyond what most small businesses require. In general, you will want to learn how 
to turn off access for specific users and optionally set a simple policy. You can log on to the services 
as an administrator through OWA by clicking See All Options for the Options setting, hovering over 
Manage Myself, and then clicking My Organization. Alternately, you can log on via the Office 365 
administration portal at https://portal.onmicrosoftonline.com; under Outlook, click General Settings.

	
Mobile Device Administration    193
Prevent ActiveSync Users from Accessing Email 
Some organizations have individuals who need an email account but should not be synchronizing 
their Inbox with a mobile device. By default, the ability to synchronize is enabled for all users. To pre-
vent this synchronization, you can disable ActiveSync for any user in your organization. The user can 
still browse to OWA and log on to view and send mail, but will not be able to create an Inbox on her 
phone by using ActiveSync. 
From the Users & Groups page, select the user whom you want to configure, and then click Details. 
Scroll to the bottom of the settings window, and expand Phone & Voice Features, as shown in Figure 
9-5.
Figure 9-5 Disabling ActiveSync for a user.
Select Disable, and then click Save. Confirm the action, and then click OK.
The next time the user logs on with her phone, ActiveSync will be disabled.
Phone and Voice Administration
You can further control mobile settings by clicking on Phone & Voice in the left menu of the Manage 
My Organization page, as shown in Figure 9-6. Even though the options include the word “Voice” in 
the title, no voice features related to your phone are available in the Office 365 Plan P1. The Phone & 
Voice page presents you with two main choices for phones: ActiveSync Access and ActiveSync Device 
Policy.

194   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
ActiveSync Access
On the ActiveSync Access page, you can control the kinds of devices that can access your services (see 
Figure 9-6). By default, Office 365 allows any device that can authenticate to connect to the service, 
but you can set up Office 365 so that only specific kinds of devices are accepted. This is useful when 
company-provided phones are allowed to connect to the services but personal phones are prohib-
ited. You can create rules in the Device Access Rules section to specify that only particular models of 
phones are allowed. 
Figure 9-6 The ActiveSync Access administration page.
If you do set up such restrictions, devices that do not match your criteria are either quarantined or 
simply disallowed. You can specify a message be sent to you when a device is quarantined. You can 
then either authorize these devices or prohibit their access. In addition, you can customize a message 
to be sent to users when their device is quarantined.
Because most small businesses have only a few users, these settings are not likely to be needed. In 
most small business scenarios, you can simply allow or deny access on the per-user basis, as discussed 
earlier in this chapter. If you do need to control what kinds of devices have access, see http://help.outlook.
com/en-US/140/ms.exch.ecp.newdeviceaccessrule.aspx for more details.

	
Mobile Device Administration    195
ActiveSync Device Policy
When a user connects to your Office 365 services by using ActiveSync, Office 365 enforces a “default 
policy” on the phone so that it behaves in compliance with settings that you specify. Using the set-
tings on the ActiveSync Device Policy page, you can set up usage and access policies to fit the needs 
of your business. For example, you might want to protect business mail and other content by requir-
ing a password to unlock phones that use your Office 365 service. In this way, if a phone is lost or 
stolen, the phone prompts for a password before allowing access. 
If you don’t have an unlimited email plan with your business phone service, you also might want 
to constrain the amount of mail that can be synced when a user first connects. Some people maintain 
large mailboxes, and downloading several gigabytes of data to your mobile device could be expen-
sive. Likewise, if employees travel out of your home area frequently, consider enabling the Require 
Manual Synchronization When Roaming policy. In particular, be careful to manage your email down-
loads to your phone when traveling internationally.
More Info You can find the complete list of device policies at http://help.outlook.com/en-
US/140/ms.exch.ecp.EditActiveSyncMailboxPolicy.aspx. 
The following sections detail the three settings categories you’re most likely to need: General, 
Device Security, and Sync Settings.
General  The settings in the General category are very straightforward, specifying which devices to 
grant permissions to and how frequently to refresh (update) policies for those devices:
■
■
Allow Devices That Don’t Fully Support These Policies To Synchronize  Select this check 
box to allow users to synchronize devices that don’t support policy enforcement or don’t 
support some of the settings you’ve specified in this policy. If you don’t select this check box, 
these devices will receive a 403 Access Denied error message when they try to synchronize 
with Microsoft Exchange.
■
■
Refresh This Policy On Mobile Devices  If you want policies to be regularly refreshed on 
devices, select this check box and enter how often you want ActiveSync to refresh policies on 
devices. Policies aren’t refreshed unless this check box is selected. If you don’t specify the time 
interval, policies will be refreshed every 24 hours.
Device security  The following settings control security features for the mobile devices synchronizing 
with user mailboxes: 
■
■
Require Encryption On Device  Select this check box to require devices to use encryption.
■
■
Require Encryption On Storage Cards  Select this check box to require devices to encrypt 
removable storage cards to protect the data on the cards.

196   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
■
■
Require A Password When Mobile Devices Are Not In Use  Select this check box to 
require that devices be locked with a password. The other password options aren’t available 
unless you select this check box. 
■
■
Allow Simple Passwords  Select this check box to allow devices to use simple password 
sequences, such as 1234 or 1111. Enabling this option makes it easier for users to remember 
their passwords but decreases device security by allowing passwords that are easy to guess.
■
■
Require An Alphanumeric Password  Select this check box to require device passwords to 
contain both numbers and letters. The default is numbers only.
■
■
Passwords Must Include This Many Character Sets  To enhance the security of device 
passwords, you can require passwords to contain characters from multiple character sets. 
Select a number from 1 to 4. The sets are lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and 
symbols. For example, if you select three, passwords must contain characters from three of 
these sets.
■
■
Minimum Password Length  Select this check box, and enter the minimum number of char-
acters that mobile device passwords must use.
■
■
Number Of Sign-In Failures Before Device Is Wiped  Select this check box to wipe the 
memory of a mobile device if a user tries to sign in and fails for the specified number of times. 
This option isn’t enforced unless this check box is selected and you have entered a number 
from 1 to 6.
■
■
Require Sign-In After The Device Has Been Inactive  Select this check box to lock devices 
after they are idle for the number of minutes you specify, requiring users to sign in again. This 
option isn’t enforced unless this check box is selected. You can specify the number of minutes 
from 1 to 60.
■
■
Enable Password Recovery  Select this check box to specify whether users can recover their 
device passwords from the server. If you select this check box, the user can go to Manage 
Myself | Phones | Mobile Phones, and then select Show Recovery Password. If you clear this 
check box, the Show Recovery Password option isn’t available.
■
■
Enforce Password Lifetime  Select this check box and enter the number of days a password 
is valid before users are required to change their device passwords.
■
■
Password Recycle Count  Enter how many different passwords users must use on their 
devices before repeating a password. You can enter a number from 0 to 50. Enter 0 to allow 
users to repeat passwords immediately.

	
Mobile Device Administration    197
Sync settings  The following settings control what users can synchronize to their devices and 
whether they can synchronize when roaming:
■
■
Include Past Calendar Items  Select how far back in time past calendar items are synchro-
nized. To help control data costs, specify a shorter interval.
■
■
 Include Past Email Items  Select how far back in time past email messages are synchro-
nized. To help control data costs, specify a shorter interval.
■
■
Limit Email Size  Enter a limit for the size of email messages, in kilobytes (KB). Emails that are 
larger than the size you specify are delivered, but they’re truncated to the maximum size.
■
■
Require Manual Synchronization When Roaming  Select this check box to require users 
to manually start synchronization from their mobile devices while they are roaming. Clear this 
check box to allow mobile devices to synchronize on a schedule or to use Direct Push when 
they are roaming and data rates are traditionally higher.
■
■
Allow HTML-Formatted Email  Select this check box to allow HTML-formatted email mes-
sages to be downloaded to devices. If you clear this box, messages are converted to plain text 
before synchronizing to the device.
■
■
Allow Attachments To Be Downloaded To Device  Select this check box to allow attach-
ments to be downloaded to devices. If you clear this box, messages show the attachment 
name but users can’t download the attachment to their device.
■
■
Maximum Attachment Size  If you want to allow attachments but want to limit the size 
that can be downloaded, select this check box and enter the maximum attachment size, in 
kilobytes.
Apply Different Policies to Different Users
Most small businesses require only a single policy, but you do have the option of creating new poli-
cies and applying them to users, if necessary. For example, if you provide phones and email accounts 
for temporary workers, you might want to enforce a different set of policies for these workers than for 
your full time employees.
To create a new policy, go to the Manage My Organization page, click Phone & Voice, click the 
ActiveSync Device Policy icon, and then click New (see Figure 9-7). Give the policy a name, configure 
the desired settings, and then click Save. You will see the new policy listed with your default policy.

Next, you need to apply the new policy to the worker. To apply the policy, In the menu on the 
left, click Users & Groups, as shown in Figure 9-5. Then, double-click the desired user. Scroll down 
and expand Phone & Voice Features, also shown in Figure 9-5. However, instead of clicking Disable, 
click Edit (or double-click Exchange ActiveSync). This opens an entirely new menu from which you 
can specify what policy is assigned to control ActiveSync. Click Browse, and you can then select a new 
policy to apply. In Figure 9-8, you can see the series of windows that are opened.

Connection Is Key
Small businesses are big users of mobile technology. The ability to have your mobile devices con-
nected to email, contacts, calendar, and online documents is one of the key drivers of adoption for 
cloud services such as Office 365. The small business plan for Office 365 allows all your users to con-
nect to their mail and online services, including using Lync 2010 mobile as part of the base subscrip-
tion. Of course, you will also want to use Outlook with Office 365, which is the subject of our next 
chapter.

Improving Your Business Image 
and Productivity with Outlook
D
uring my tenure at Microsoft, I had an up-close look at how large companies and their custom-
ers use technology to improve productivity. For example, in a bigger company, simply finding the 
person responsible for a specific program, feature, or product can be challenge. Microsoft uses Share-
Point and internal search capabilities; thus, quickly locating teams, individuals, and content is easy. 
You can see the online status of anyone in the company, worldwide, and start an instant message 
session with them. Need to schedule a meeting with a team? Just add them to a meeting request, and 
locate a conference room in their building by using the Global Address List. Seeing when key people 
are available and sending them all a meeting request is a fast and easy process. The conference room 
will automatically accept the meeting request and show it as booked.
These kinds of services are also available to you as the owner of an Office 365 Plan P1 subscription, 
meaning that you can reap the same benefits from improvements in productivity. Microsoft Office 
365 not only can increase efficiencies but can also significantly enhance your image as a professional 
organization that takes its business—and its customers—seriously.
This chapter assumes that you know the basics of sending and receiving email and that you’ve 
already been using Microsoft Outlook. Rather than going into details about how to create folders, use 
tasks, and perform other useful tasks in Outlook, the chapter focuses on how to improve your profes-
sional image by using Office 365 and Outlook and provides some productivity-enhancing tips.
Improve Your Image
To project a professional image, you want your email to look professional. Using Outlook and Office 
365, your email can have the look and feel of organizations many times your size.
Use a Custom Domain
Think of the impact of someone handing you a business card with an email address from a free ser-
vice like Google Mail: It says “Too small to have my own domain.” Even a one-person company should 
have a custom domain to set it apart from those that just don’t bother. This is perhaps one of the 
most significant steps that you can take to improve your image, and with Office 365, there's no reason 

202   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
why you shouldn't do it. Details on how to add a custom domain are covered in Chapter 6, “Working 
with Custom Domains.”
Create a Signature
When you add a signature to your mail, you brand every message with your company name, email, 
contact information, and any other information you want to include. My signature includes my email 
address, a link to my company website, and states that I’m an Office 365 MVP. Every time an email 
goes out, it’s a potential contact or referral. 
You can get creative with your signature as well. Try adding an electronic business card, hyperlinks, 
or custom graphics. If you add graphics, don’t overdo the design, and be certain that your image does 
not add significantly to the size of your email. A basic text message is quite small, but even a modest 
graphic can triple the size of an email message. If you have more than one line of business, create a 
signature for each of your brands. Just insert the relevant one from the Signature icon when you’re 
crafting an email.
Note  Signatures in OWA are different from signatures in Outlook. If you use OWA and 
Outlook, consider creating similar signatures in both.
More Info Microsoft has a good online training session about creating signatures at http://
office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-great-looking-signatures-for-your-e-mail-
RZ010186191.aspx?CTT=1.
Reply to External Contacts with a Meeting Request 
When you’re talking to customers, vendors, or others outside of your organization, you can quickly 
show that you’re serious about being efficient when you send them a meeting request that contains 
the date, time, contact information, agenda, and other details. Most businesses use Outlook as an 
email client, so they can accept the meeting or propose a new time very easily without having to 
handcraft an acceptance or proposal. 
You can reply to an email with a meeting request simply by clicking the Meeting icon (shown in 
Figure 10-1) on the Message tab in an open message. This adds all the recipients to the meeting 
request and includes the email content in the body of the meeting request. 
Figure 10-1 Reply with a meeting request.

	
Improve Your Image    203
Of course, in Outlook 2010, you can also create a meeting request manually by clicking Home, 
New Items, and then Meeting.
Frequently, in business communication, you will be on the phone with a potential customer 
or businesses associate and agree to meet at a future date. You can immediately send a meeting 
request containing your contact information and any other relevant information. Most businesses 
use Outlook, so your associate can accept, reschedule, or reject the request easily. This is an efficient 
way to ensure that you synchronize with one another, because the event will appear on both of your 
calendars. 
The set of capabilities related to scheduling in Outlook, OWA, and Office 365 is enough for a full 
chapter or perhaps even a book. But for most businesses, the ability to create a meeting request by 
using shared free/busy schedules is one of the key values in Office 365.
Note  Frequently, business communications cross time zone boundaries, so when setting a 
time, be clear about what time zone you are discussing. When sending a meeting request, 
always use your time zone for the agreed time. Outlook automatically adjusts the request 
for those in different time zones.
Online Meetings with Microsoft Lync Online
Another very effective way to improve both your business image and productivity is to hold online 
meetings. Using the Office 365 Lync Online service, you can easily send invitations for—and host—
online meetings with people outside your company. Instead of emailing a document back and forth 
while talking about it on the phone, you can use Lync Online so that all meeting participants can view 
the same document simultaneously. You can even use Lync Online for voice and video, with external 
users, and for performing live demonstrations of websites, software, or anything you can access on 
your computer. 
When your system is set up for Office 365, you will see Lync meeting options in Outlook. You can 
create an online meeting request or convert a normal meeting request to an online request, as shown 
in Figure 10-2. 

204   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 10-2 An online Meeting request in Outlook.
The online meeting request contains a URL, as shown in Figure 10-3, that when clicked connects 
the user to your online meeting. 
When the user clicks the URL, his specific experience depends on his system setup. This also 
determines whether he can participate in two-way voice and video and other options. The minimum 
experience uses a browser-based interface through which the user can view a shared document, a 
product demonstration, a problem, or other activity on your computer. Exact details about how to 
manage the user experience for Lync Online meetings for people who are not in your organization 
are discussed in Chapter 12, “Working with Lync Online.”

Improve Your Productivity    205
Publish Your Calendar
You can make your calendar visible to others by using the Publish Online option in Outlook. You can 
find this option in Outlook 2010 by clicking Calendar | Home | Publish Online on the ribbon, and then 
clicking Publish This Calendar. This option takes you to calendar publishing options in OWA, where 
you can enable calendar publishing as described in Chapter 9, “Working with Mobile Devices.” 
Improve Your Productivity
One of the benefits of Office 365 is that all the resources in your organization are available in a single 
directory called the Global Address List (GAL). This is particularly useful for businesses that have 
multiple locations or multiple business identities. Although normally associated with Outlook, the GAL 
also shows up in OWA as well as in Lync Online.
Use the GAL
Many small businesses have never had the benefit of a GAL. In fact, for a small business, the term 
“global” might seem a bit over-scoped. Even so, the GAL is actually very useful in small and large busi-
nesses alike. 
Using the GAL, you can email anyone or anything in the list, which can contain users, resources 
(such as conference rooms), distribution lists, and contacts. External contacts that you add in OWA 
become available to everyone in the company. In this way, your GAL puts a directory of important 
customers, vendors, and other business associates at your fingertips. 
When you click the To button in an email you are writing, Outlook 2010 shows you the GAL. In the 
example shown in Figure 10-4, the GAL includes two email groups (All Margies Travel Employees and 
Project Delta), individual users, a resource (Board Room), and an external contact (David Pelton), with 
their titles, phone numbers, and locations visible at a glance.
Figure 10-4 The Global Address List.

206   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Right-click any name, and then in the context menu that opens, select Properties to bring up the 
additional details, such as those shown in Figure 10-5. In terms of productivity, it’s a big help when 
anyone in your company can simply right-click to retrieve a cell phone number or mailing address, 
especially when you’re on the road or it’s after hours and you need to contact someone right way. 
Keep this in mind when creating your GAL. Your GAL will be much more useful if fully populated with 
addresses, extension numbers, phone numbers, and notes. When populating user accounts, resist the 
urge to only fill out a few fields with a minimum of user information.
Figure 10-5 The properties of a global contact in the GAL.
Share Your Calendar
By sharing your calendar, you provide other members of your organization with access to your sched-
ule. By default, anyone in your organization can see your free/busy schedule, but you can choose to 
show more details on a person-by-person basis. You can even give rights to others to modify your 
calendar. In this way, an assistant can update your calendar without your involvement.
When you start Outlook 2010, you start out on the Home tab. At the lower left of the main win-
dow, click Calendar. Then, click the Share Calendar icon, as shown in Figure 10-6. 

	
Improve Your Productivity    207
Figure 10-6 The Share Calendar option.
This displays a specialized form in which you can designate the recipients and the kind of detail to 
show when they view your calendar, as shown in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7 Calendar-sharing invitation. 
Before you send the form, if you want to view the recipient’s calendar, select the check box titled 
Request Permission To View Recipient’s Calendar. When she receives your calendar-sharing message, 
she is prompted to allow you to view her calendar, as well.
The Details pull-down menu shown in Figure 10-7 gives you control over how much information is 
shown in your shared calendar. You can choose one of the following:
■
■
Availability Only  Shows your time as Free, Busy, or “Out of Office.” This is the default 
setting.
■
■
Limited Details  Includes the availability and subject of calendar items.
■
■
Full Details  Includes availability and full details of calendar items.
When you click Send, you are asked to confirm that you want to share your calendar. The recipient 
receives an email like the one shown in Figure 10-8.

208   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 10-8 Receiving a sharing invitation.
When the receiver clicks Open This Calendar, at the top of the message, Outlook displays the 
receiver’s calendar along with the shared calendar, side by side, as shown in Figure 10-9.
Figure 10-9 Viewing the shared calendar.
In this example, the calendar was shared with full details so that the receiver can see the meeting 
titles and details. 

	
Improve Your Productivity    209
In the left column (see Figure 10-9), you can deselect the shared calendar by clearing the check 
box under Shared Calendar. The calendar remains available for you to view at any time by simply re-
selecting the calendar.
A popular feature of Outlook is the ability to overlay one calendar on top of another. You can view 
both calendars in this way by clicking the arrow next to the name (in this case, Andy Ruth, shown in 
Figure 10-9). The resulting combined view is very useful because you can view multiple calendars as if 
they were one (Figure 10-10).
Figure 10-10 Calendars overlaid. 
Finally, if you want to give someone permission to edit your calendar, click the Calendar Permis-
sions button (the rightmost icon in Figure 10-6). This opens the permissions controls, as shown in 
Figure 10-11. 
Figure 10-11 Assigning calendar permissions.

210   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
In the top box, you can choose to work with permissions that have already been assigned, add new 
people, or remove existing assignments. When you select the person to work with, their permissions 
are shown in the Permissions section.
While the Permissions Level list has many choices, the differences between these options are not 
obvious. However, when you make a selection, the permissions for Read, Write, Delete Items, and 
Other are set accordingly. For example, Figure 10-12 shows the Author permissions.
Figure 10-12 Author permissions.
Feel free to select a pre-defined set of permissions, such as Author, and adjust as you like. Notice 
that you can control whether people can add items to your calendar as well as whether they can edit 
or delete the items they add. In addition, you can allow them to edit or delete items you add to your 
own calendar. Using these permissions, you can create a permission set to fit most scenarios.
Designate a Delegate
Another benefit of using Office 365 with Outlook is the ability to delegate access to some or all of the 
content in Outlook to another person. Using the delegate features, you can have meeting requests 
sent to both you and the delegate. The delegate can accept or reschedule meetings on your behalf. 
You can also allow the delegate access, enabling him to reply to email you receive or to create tasks 
on your agenda. When a delegate replies to mail or a meeting request, the reply indicates that it was 
sent on your behalf. In this way, the receiver knows that you did not personally respond.

	
Improve Your Productivity    211
To assign a delegate in Outlook 2010, click the File tab, and then click Account Settings | Delegate 
Access, as shown in Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13 The Delegate Access setting.
You are then asked to select the person who is to receive delegate authority. Next, the Delegate 
Permissions form opens, as illustrated in Figure 10-14, in which you can refine the permissions.
Figure 10-14 The Delegate Permissions form.

212   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When you click OK, you can specify how you want meeting requests managed. You can have 
meeting requests sent to your delegate and you receive a copy, sent to your delegate only and you 
do not receive a copy, or sent to both of you. You then click OK to complete the assignment.
The delegate can access content he is assigned by clicking File | Open | Other User’s Folder, and 
then entering the name of the delegator. The delegate can then access the content in Outlook. For 
example, if the Inbox was delegated, the delegate would see their own inbox as well as the delegated 
Inbox.
Note that when you create meeting requests or appointments, you can choose to make them 
Private by clicking Categorize | Private. If the delegate is not allowed to see private content (which 
is controlled by the check box at the bottom of Figure 10-14), the calendar item is hidden from the 
delegate’s view.
Use MailTips
Using MailTips, you can see information about a user, group, or contact in Outlook before you send 
a message. In Figure 10-15, you can see the MailTip assigned to David Pelton. It tells anyone in the 
company who sends him an email that he is an important business associate. 
Figure 10-15 A MailTip shown before the mail is sent.
Only administrators can assign MailTips to external contacts. Both administrators and users can 
assign MailTips to public groups created in OWA. 
Reply with a Meeting Request (Internal Recipients)
When inviting people within your organization to a meeting by using OWA or Outlook, you can easily 
see their free/busy schedule and arrange a time convenient to all. To create a meeting request and 
view the free/busy schedule, just click New Meeting in Outlook or OWA, select the time and date, and 
then click Scheduling Assistant. When you add people to the meeting, their availability is displayed, as 
shown in Figure 10-16. The ability to share calendars and book conference rooms without having to 
send separate emails to all parties asking when they are available obviously saves a great deal of time. 

	
Improve Your Productivity    213
Figure 10-16 The Scheduling Assistant showing free/busy information of invited attendees. 
Use Out-of-Office Messages
When you are going to be away, it's a good idea to get in the habit of setting up Outlook to send an 
out-of-office message while you are gone. You can improve productivity by including details about 
the duration of your absence, advising whether you are responding to email while out, and providing 
contacts for various projects or for situations that might arise. This also improves your professional 
image. If customers or business associates see an auto-reply when you’re out of the office, particu-
larly when it provides contacts for how they can take action to resolve their issue in your absence, it 
clearly saves time for those involved and tells your customers that you care about their business, even 
if you’re traveling. 
Here are some paraphrased messages I’ve seen:
“I’m on vacation till Oct 21st and will be back in the office on the 23rd. Contact Aruth@ 
margiestravel.com for issues related to cruise lines and Marge@margiestravel.com for all other 
questions. I will not have access to email, but will be checking voice messages occasionally.
“Traveling the first week of November, so contact will be spotty. Will return all messages as 
quickly as possible. Back in the Office Nov 15.”
“Out of the office on parental leave, will not be available. Contact myboss@contoso.com for all 
issues.”
To set up an out-of-office message in Outlook 2010, click File, Info, and then select Automatic 
Replies. This displays the form shown in Figure 10-17, in which you can create out-of-office messages 
for internal users and external users as well as designate the time frame when the messages should 
run. You can also configure an out-of-office message in OWA. Unlike signatures, if you configure an 
out-of-office message in Outlook, you do not also need to configure it in OWA.

214

Refine Your Junk Mail Filter
Office 365 uses a high-quality spam and virus filtering system based on Microsoft’s Forefront server 
technology. You won’t even notice that this is going on, except that certain mail will wind up in your 
Junk mailbox. In my experience, the filtering has been very good, but as with most junk mail filters, 
you will find mail in your junk mail that should not be there. Less frequently, you will find junk mail in 
your Inbox. In either of these situations, you can instruct Office 365 as to how to properly classify mail 
by right-clicking any message, or on the ribbon, on the Outlook 2010 Home tab, click the Junk icon, 
and then select one of the options shown in Figure 10-18.
Figure 10-18 Junk options in Outlook 2010.
When you click Junk E-mail Options, Office 365 provides the additional options shown in 
Figure 10-19. 

	
Improve Your Productivity    215
Figure 10-19 The Junk E-mail Options dialog box.
When you right-click an email and designate it as safe or junk, that information is recorded in the 
Safe Senders, Safe Recipients, or Blocked Senders list accordingly. You can manually add to these lists 
and view other options by selecting the appropriate tab. For example, in the Safe Senders list, you can 
designate domains or individuals that should not be treated as junk. As a best practice, if you receive 
email from a domain regularly, add that domain to your Safe Senders list. In addition, you can set up 
Office 365 to treat all your contacts as safe senders or automatically make safe anyone you email. 
Use the Outlook Social Connector
Many savvy small businesses use social networking as a way to create connections, reach new mar-
kets, and stay in touch with business contacts. The Outlook Social Connector, installed as part of the 
Office 365 setup, shows you information from Facebook, LinkedIn, and a few other social networking 
sites, related to people you interact with using email (see Figure 10-20). The Connector is not actually 
an Office 365 feature, because it works without Office 365, but because it is installed with the Office 
365 setup, many people will see it for the first time when they prepare for Office 365. 
Figure 10-20 The Outlook Social Connector.

216   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 10-20 demonstrates that the Social Connector has very practical applications. Suppose that 
you are on the phone with a colleague who is not in your business and you’re discussing a potential 
deal about which you have exchanged some email. Sure, you can click the Mail icon and see all mail 
associated with the person. But that’s just mail, not a social connection. 
Now imagine that, as you talk, the Social Connector is showing you the person’s picture with the 
“In” logo on it, indicating the photo is from a LinkedIn profile. You click his name in the All Items list, 
see the colleague’s LinkedIn profile, and discover that you both worked for the same company at 
some point in your careers. In addition, you can see that you know several people in common. You 
can bring this up during the conversation to help create a more personal connection with some-
one who was previously just a business opportunity. Discovering these connections is fun, and the 
improved rapport can help close new business deals as well as improve your professional image with 
others. 
Note  The Social Connector is minimized by default. In the reading pane, at the bottom, 
expand the Social Connector bar to see the rest of the content.
The Social Connector also has the following features:
■
■
Communication history  Your message history with the person is automatically shown. 
When someone you don’t recognize contacts you, any messages you’ve exchanged with them 
in the past are easy to find.
■
■
Meetings  Meetings scheduled with the sender are shown.
■
■
Attachments  Remember sending an attachment to someone but you can’t find the mes-
sage? Let the Outlook Social Connector do the searching for you. All attachments are 
exchanged automatically. 
■
■
Activity feeds  The activity feed from the network is displayed in Outlook. 
Install a Social Connector Provider
By default, the Social Connector does not connect you to any networks. To add a network in Outlook 
2010, click View, click People Pane, and then select Account Settings, as shown in Figure 10-21.
Figure 10-21 Selecting the People Pane account settings in Outlook 2010

	
For More Information    217
The first time you select this, you see a welcome page with the message, You Can Now Connect 
Outlook To Your Online Social Networks. Click Next, and then click View Social Network Providers 
Available Online. This takes you to the URL on office.microsoft.com, where you can click the icon rep-
resenting the provider that you want to install and add that to your setup.
Figure 10-22 Social network connector providers.
After you install the Social Connector, you can configure it with your logon information and you’ll 
receive information from any contacts involved with those networks right in Outlook.

Working with SharePoint Online
M
icrosoft Office is the world’s most popular software for creating business documents—for good 
reason. While the basics of Office are easy to learn, each Office product has tremendous depth. 
They allow for complex interactions with other Office products, personalization capabilities, multiple 
language support, and a dedicated programming language for developers to create new features and 
integrations with other systems.
Of course, like most well-established software products, Office has grown over the years, and with 
the advent of online services, with Office 365, you can now edit Office documents online as well as 
share them and collaborate with others. 
Microsoft SharePoint Online is the Office 365 service by which you can work with your docu-
ments online in a totally new way. In this chapter, you’ll learn how Office and SharePoint Online work 
together. For example, from within Office, you can open and edit documents that reside on Share-
Point Online. You’ll also learn how to set up version control when working with these Office docu-
ments, retain version history, check documents in and out, use Office Web Apps, and even publish 
a collection of documents to Outlook where they will be available to you offline. Need to ask a 
coworker about one of those documents? SharePoint Online lets you see who is online and then start 
an instant message (IM) session while you’re within Microsoft Word or SharePoint. Finally, the chapter 
will explain some important security-related administrative tasks as well as how to add pages and 
invite external users to share your site. 
SharePoint Online Structure and Terminology
To get the most out of this chapter and working with SharePoint Online, you need to understand a 
few key terms: 
■
■
Site  The top level of a collection of associated pages. You can have multiple sites, each with 
one or more pages. Your subscription comes with a preconfigured team site. The team site has 
tasks and a document library added. You can customize this site to suit your requirements. 
Because the team site is the first site, it is always the “parent” of any new sites you create. 
■
■
Page  A container for content in SharePoint Online. When you add a site, a page is created 
for you, and that page becomes the top level of the site. You can add additional pages as you 
choose.

220   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
■
■
Web Part  An application that you add to a page that provides a predefined capability. Using 
Web Parts, you can add ready-to-use functionality to your site, such as a document library, a 
calendar, task lists, contacts, a blog, or a wiki, without any coding.
■
■
Document library  A type of Web Part designed to work with Office documents, PDFs, and 
Zip files. You can use document libraries to check in and check out documents, keep docu-
ment history, add customized workflows, attach notification of changes, add custom columns, 
and more.
■
■
Lists  A type of Web Part that can be customized to suit your needs. SharePoint Online’s tasks 
and contacts are two examples of Web Parts that are based on lists. 
To recap, your SharePoint Online site comes pre-configured with a team site. You can use the team 
site as-is or customize the site to your liking by adding pages or Web Parts. In addition, you can add 
additional sites to your system and customize the look, feel, function, and security of each. 
Access SharePoint Online
With the Office 365 for professionals and small businesses subscription, you can find SharePoint 
Online by using the Team Site links from the Office 365 portal at https://portal.microsoftonline.com. 
The URL for your site will be unique and have the form http://<company>.sharepoint.com. The links 
and icons shown in Figure 11-1 take you to different capabilities provided by SharePoint Online.
Note  You can access SharePoint Online from most any modern browser, but only the 32-
bit versions of Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 can make full use of its features. 
If you use Firefox, Chrome, or Safari, specific features will not work or will be unavailable. 
For details about which features work with which versions of which browsers, see the article 
“Plan browser support (SharePoint Server 2010)” on TechNet at http://technet.microsoft.com/
en-us/library/cc263526.aspx.
Figure 11-1 Accessing SharePoint Online in the Office 365 Portal.

	
Access SharePoint Online    221
■
■
Visit Team Site  The team site is a website created for you and designed for internal use. You 
can customize the site by adding content and features without any specialized or third-party 
software whatsoever. Technically, the team site is part of a site collection. Your Office 365 sub-
scription allows you to have one site collection, which, as its name suggests, is a group of sites. 
The team site is one site in the collection. You can create additional sites in your site collection 
or just use the team site. 
■
■
Shared Documents  Clicking this link takes you to the part of your team site where you can 
store and share documents online. This is called a document library. You’ll need to know this if 
you want to store documents in places other than the team site. We’ll discuss using the Shared 
Documents feature in some detail, later in this chapter.
■
■
Office application icons  Each of these starts Office Web Apps that are part of your Shared 
Documents features. 
■
■
Website  The Website section takes you to a link for the public website, which is also a fea-
ture of SharePoint Online.
But before investigating each of these links in depth, take some time to become familiar with the 
basic SharePoint navigation: 
1.	
Click Visit Team Site. You will see the default team site, as shown in Figure 11-2.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Notice that the URL now displayed in your browser is very different from the portal URL 
(https://portal.microsoftonline.com/IWDeault.aspx or similar). This is a key point: you are now 
working in SharePoint Online, which is completely distinct from the Office 365 portal. You 
don’t need to go to the portal to access your team site. You can browse directly to your site by 
using its URL.
You can use the Posts section on the page to post messages that can be seen by anyone who 
views the site. You can use the Documents section to add documents to your site.
2.	
As you can see in Figure 11-2, one Documents link is in the main body of the page and one is 
in the left column. Click either to go to the same location, which is shown in Figure 11-3. 
Figure 11-3 The Documents section of team site.

At the top of the page, click Home. This takes you back to the Office 365 portal. You’ve now 
gone full circle, from the Office 365 portal to SharePoint Online and back again.
4.	
Click Shared Documents. The link takes you directly to the same location as the team site’s 
Documents link. The Shared Documents link in the Office 365 portal and the page it takes you 
to are actually both part of the team site and not a separate website or application. They are 
one and the same. 
5.	
Click Home again to return to the Office 365 Portal.
Use Office Web Apps
On the Home page, you’ll see icons for Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and 
Microsoft OneNote. These are shortcuts to a SharePoint Online feature called Office Web Apps 
(OWA). OWA are online versions of Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint that work within a browser. 
You do not need Microsoft Office installed on your computer to create or print documents with OWA. 

	
Use Office Web Apps    223
Because OWA is a browser-based application, you need to use one of the supported browsers listed 
in the Office Web App Service Description located at http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.
aspx?id=13602.
The OWA Conundrum
The designers of OWA were faced with a daunting challenge. Office documents can be very complex, 
so building a way to create complex documents in a browser is not feasible due to the limitations of 
a browser-based environment. At the same time, the designers wanted to provide a browser-based 
ability to display Office documents with as much fidelity as possible. As a result, you can view docu-
ments by using OWA that you cannot create by using OWA. For example, Figure 11-4 shows a docu-
ment using comments as presented in the Word Web App. 
Figure 11-4 Word Web App rendering a document created in Microsoft Word.
As you can see, the document looks pretty good! Comments show as expected, and even the 
Smart Art is faithfully rendered. However, if you click Edit In Browser, you receive the message: “This 
document cannot be opened because it is set to track changes or contains tracked changes or com-
ments. To edit this document, open it in Microsoft Word.”
This highlights a key point. OWA has two distinct modes of operation, called views: Reading view 
and Edit view. Reading view can show Microsoft Office documents that are more complex than the 

224   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Edit view can actually create. So think of OWA as a way for you and others to easily view Microsoft 
Office documents on computers and portable devices when you don’t have Microsoft Office avail-
able, and as a way to create simple, online documents. 
Create Documents by Using OWA
Office 365 for professionals and small businesses makes it very easy to create basic online documents 
by using Office Web Apps. Simply log on to https://portal.onmicrosoft.com, and then click one of the 
Office document icons (refer to Figure 11-1). The Office icons are also available when you click Team 
Site. 
After entering a file name, you are taken to the OWA you selected. You will then see the familiar 
ribbon at the top of the page from which you can begin to create your document (see Figure 11-5). 
You’ll notice the ribbon has Home, Insert, and View options available, with which you can do common 
tasks like format the text, apply styles, insert images, and check spelling. This list will grow as you add 
features such as tables and images. When you want to use a feature that is not available, click Open 
In Word. Your SharePoint Online document will open for editing in Word, which means that you’ll be 
editing your online document directly in Microsoft Office. This is one of the many ways that Office 
and SharePoint work together.
Figure 11-5 Creating a Word document in Word Web App.
When editing, you are, of course, in the Edit view. Except in the most basic documents, you will 
need to switch the view mode to the Reading view to see how your document will look when viewed 
by others or when opened in Office. To do this, click the View menu option, and then select Reading 
View.
Save Documents by Using OWA
Documents created by using OWA are saved online in your document library (called Shared Docu-
ments, by default). You cannot save Word Web App, PowerPoint Web App, or OneNote Web App 
documents to your desktop unless you open them with Microsoft Office. 

	
Use Office Web Apps    225
The Excel Web App File menu is a bit different, as shown in Figure 11-6. If you click Where’s The 
Save Button?, you see a message that your file is continually saved. You can click Download A Copy to 
copy the workbook to your computer. This allows you to store the file locally and edit it without being 
online. Keep in mind that you need to upload the local copy to SharePoint Online after making your 
changes.
Figure 11-6 The Excel Web App Save menu.
Print from Office Web Apps
Printing is a weak spot for Office Web Apps. The Word and PowerPoint Web Apps have a Print option 
that, as you will see, does not work as you might expect. The easiest way to print these documents is 
to first open them in Microsoft Office. 
To print from the Word or PowerPoint Web App, you must first convert the document to a PDF 
file (Portable Document Format). To do this, select File, and then click Print. (If necessary, you will 
be prompted to download an add-on for your browser so that you can save the file as a PDF.) The 
next prompt you receive might seem counterintuitive: you are asked where you want to save the 
file, because the file must be saved as a PDF before it can be printed. After you save the file as a PDF, 
you are asked whether you want to open the file. If you select Yes and your computer can read PDF 
files, the document will open and you can then print it. If your computer cannot print PDF files, your 
browser will ask for permission to locate a program that reads PDF files. You can then elect to install 
the reader of your choice. Finally, you are ready to open and then print the file.
Note  Because PDF files are so common, most people already have some kind of PDF reader 
installed on their computers. One of the most common is the free Adobe Reader available 
at www.adobe.com. However, if you need to download a reader, beware of other add-ons 
that might be automatically selected for you. Adobe, for example, will automatically install 
the Google toolbar as well, unless you opt out.

226   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Microsoft is well aware that this is not an ideal end user experience and is likely to improve this 
feature in the future. However, there is a silver lining. Remember earlier when I mentioned how Word 
Web App doesn’t allow you to save files to your PC without first opening the document in Office? 
As an alternative, you can save them as PDF files by selecting to print the document. This works well 
to email the document to someone, as long as the recipient doesn’t need the file in the Office file 
format. This is actually a good solution for invoices, statements, finished papers, brochures, and other 
documents that are in their final form.
How to Disable OWA
The Library Settings menu (shown in Figure 11-14) includes an Advanced Settings page on which 
you’ll find the Opening Documents In The Browser option. This option allows you to turn off OWA. If 
you want to always use Microsoft Office to view and edit documents, set this option to Open In The 
Client Application. In doing so, keep in mind that you commit to using Office to view the documents. 
If you find yourself at a computer without Office and need to view a document, you will be unable to 
do so.
Add Files to SharePoint Online
Adding documents to SharePoint Online is easy. Simply click the Add Document link as shown in 
Figure 11-7, browse to the file you want to upload, and you’re done. You can also drag up to 50 docu-
ments at a time to SharePoint Online by using the Upload Multiple Files option. 
Note  The Upload Multiple Files option does not appear when using the IE 64-bit version.
You can save many different kinds of files to SharePoint Online, including Zip and PDF files, but 
for the most part, SharePoint is optimized to work with Microsoft Office documents. There are some 
limitations, of course. The maximum file size is 250 MB for a single document. This limit has been 
increased steadily over time. It used to be 50 MB. In addition, you cannot generally upload executable 
files to SharePoint Onlne. The list of disallowed file extensions can be found in the appendix of the 
Microsoft “SharePoint Online Service Description for Enterprises” white paper, which is available for 
download from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13602. The enterprise service 
is the same one used in Plan P1, so many of the same limitations apply.
Create Folders for Shared Documents
Of course, when you have more than a few files, you will want to add folders to help keep them 
organized. This is easy to do when you find the right menu option. Figure 11-7 shows you the default 
shared documents page with a few documents posted. (Click the Documents link on the Team Site 
page to see this page.)

	
Create Folders for Shared Documents    227
Figure 11-7 The default shared documents page with documents added.
You can see the Add Document link at the bottom and the icons for creating different kinds of 
Office documents, but how do you create a folder? It is not obvious, but the listing of files is a click-
able area called a document library. Click in the white space beneath the column headers or to the 
right of any file name to view the Library Tools options available for managing a document library. 
If you’re not sure, click just to the right of Add Document, where the mouse pointer is located in 
Figure 11-8. 
Figure 11-8 Selecting the document library reveals new choices.

228   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Now, at the top of the page, you will see some entirely new choices, including New Folder. Use this 
option to create a new folder for your library. After you add the folder, when you select to upload 
files, the form you see for uploading will ask you what folder to place the files in. Also, note that you 
can select to create a new document or upload documents from this menu.
You can create nested folders to organize content just as you do on your computer; simply click a 
folder to add another inside it. In Figure 11-9, I’ve created a folder called Summer Tours and entered 
the folder. Now, how to get back to the parent folder, Documents?
At the top of the page is a breadcrumb trail that shows you exactly where you are and enables you 
to easily navigate upward. 
Figure 11-9 Navigating by using breadcrumbs.
Use the breadcrumb trail to take you back one or more levels in your directory structure. In addi-
tion, notice on the left a navigation menu with a link to Documents. This is your default document 
library. You can click that link whenever you want to return to your default library.
Open SharePoint Files by Using Windows Explorer
Rather than navigate your SharePoint Online documents and folders in your web browser, you can 
use Windows Explorer to manage your files and folders. In general, this is a much easier way to work 
with your files. To access this feature, you need to select the document library so that you are viewing 
the Library Tools options shown in Figure 11-8. Under Library Tools, click the Library tab to access the 
controls shown in Figure 11-10.

	
Open SharePoint Files by Using Windows Explorer    229
Figure 11-10 The Library Tools tab—the Library menu with Open With Explorer selected.
The Library menu contains some very useful features, such as Open With Explorer (shown selected 
in Figure 11-10). This feature is not named in the menu but is represented by a small icon with a folder 
and computer page, making it somewhat hard to discover.
When you click Open With Explorer, your document library opens in Windows Explorer, where you 
can manage your online documents as if they were in a local folder (see Figure 11-11).
Figure 11-11 A document library open in Windows Explorer.

230   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
You can use this feature to rearrange your content. For example, remember how you added a new 
folder to the document library? That’s great, but how do you get your documents that are already 
in the document library into the new folder? Explorer view is the easiest way. You can just drag the 
document into the folder as if it were a folder on your desktop. 
In addition, when you want to add a folder that has existing content, you can drag the folder from 
your desktop to the opened Explorer window. The folder and its contents will be copied to SharePoint 
Online.
Placing Your Document Library on Your Desktop
This is one of my favorite SharePoint Online productivity tips: you don’t need to open Share-
Point Online in your browser to work with your online documents. You can add a shortcut 
folder to your desktop that will open the document library in SharePoint Online in Explorer 
whenever you click it. You can drag documents right into the folder without opening your 
browser.
First, open the document library in Explorer view, as shown in Figure 11-11. Next, left-click 
and hold on the folder icon in the address bar, as shown in Figure 11-12, and then drag the 
folder on to your desktop.
Figure 11-12 Dragging the folder icon.
Now you have a shortcut folder on your desktop that will open your document library in 
Explorer view! Note that if you delete this icon, your files and folders in SharePoint Online will 
not be deleted. Also, note that the Create Link In Documents tooltip appears in the figure only 
because it is a drag operation. The tooltip changes to Create Link In Desktop when the folder 
moves past the window boundary.

	
Create a New Document Library    231
Troubleshoot Open With Windows Explorer
In some cases, when you click the Open With Explorer icon, you will receive the message Your Client 
Does Not Support Opening This List With Windows Explorer. The most common resolution is to add 
your SharePoint Online site to the list of Trusted Sites. Browse to your SharePoint Online site, and 
from Internet Explorer, choose Tools, and then click Internet Options. (If you don’t see the Tools menu 
option, press the Alt key.) Click the Security tab and ensure that Trusted Sites is selected. Click the 
Sites button, and you should see your SharePoint Online site listed, placed there automatically. Before 
you close this form, be sure to clear the check box labeled Require Server Verification (Https) For All 
Sites In This Zone. Typically, you would not clear this check box for security reasons, but the Share-
Point Online Plan P1 does not support https. Click Close. Clear the Enable Protected Mode check box, 
and then click OK. Close Internet Explorer and try again. This resolves the problem in many cases.
Important  Adding a non-https site to your trusted sites in Internet Explorer does create 
a security risk. If an attacker was able to successfully pose as your website and you con-
nected to it, it could potentially inject harmful code that would run on your computer. Your 
browser would think it’s connecting to a trusted site and provide elevated privileges. When 
your computer connects to a site by using an SSL connection (https://), the possibility of 
this is dramatically reduced because the traffic between you and the site is encrypted. As of 
this writing, Plan P1 does not support https connections, which makes it much easier for an 
attacker to implement this kind of attack. You have to assess for yourself if you consider the 
risk to be worth the convenience.
Create a New Document Library
The default document library works fine, but you might want to create different repositories to better 
manage your content, segregating it by team, project, security, or other grouping that makes sense 
for your business. 
To create a new document library, browse to your team site, and then in the upper-left corner of 
the page, click Site Actions. From the menu, select New Document Library to reach the page shown in 
Figure 11-13. 

232   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-13 Creating a new document library.
Although the Name And Description settings are self-explanatory, the Navigation options are not 
so obvious. In Figure 11-13, notice the Document Library link listed on the left side of the page. The 
link is called a Quick Launch link. By default, when you create a new document library, SharePoint 
Online will add a Quick Launch link to this menu. This makes the document library easily discoverable 
by others using the system. However, if you do not want to “advertise” the document library, you can 
say No to the Navigation question. In this case, make a note of the URL when the library is created so 
that you can easily return to it later.
When enabled, Document Version History creates a new version of your file every time you save 
your edits rather than overwriting the existing file. When you open the file, you always open the lat-
est version, but you have the option of reverting to any previous version. For more details about this 
feature, see the “Versioning Settings” section later in this chapter.
The Document Template setting determines what kind of file is created when you create a new 
file within SharePoint Online rather than uploading a file. In almost all cases, this remains set to the 
default.
When you’ve completed the form, click Create. You are now in the document library, where you 
can add documents or make further configuration settings. If you return to the Team Site page, you 

	
Library Settings    233
can now see the document library listed under Libraries on the left side of the page. This is the afore-
mentioned Quick Launch link.
Note  After using SharePoint Online for a while, you might forget the link or name of a 
page or library that you created. You can find any content you created by clicking the All 
Site Content link on the left side of the Team Site page.
Add Alerts to the Document Library
Document libraries can be set to notify you when a document is added or changed. In some cases, 
this is exactly what you need to keep in touch with an active project that is time sensitive or material 
that is touch sensitive. 
Setting alerts is easy to do. In the Library Tools group, select the Library tab (see Figure 11-10), and 
then click Alert Me (the ringing bell icon). Select Set Alert On The Library, and then complete the form 
that displays. 
The alert options are self-explanatory. You can use them to specify when and where to send an 
alert via email or text message. For example, you can set up the alert to send an email when anyone 
changes any document, just your document, or when files are added, deleted, or modified. You can 
even elect to receive alerts one at a time, daily, weekly, or on a scheduled basis. 
Note  You can have alerts sent to a distribution group if needed. This can be useful when a 
team is responsible for a set of documents, such as service requests. Any time a new one is 
added, several people will be notified.
Library Settings
The configuration settings for the document library are found on the Library Settings page. To access 
this page, on the ribbon, in the Library Tools group, select the Library tab, and then click Library Set-
tings (see Figure 11-10). The page shown in Figure 11-14 opens.

234   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-14 The Library Settings page in SharePoint Online.
This page provides many settings, but only a few that you will use regularly. 
Title, Description, and Navigation 
When you need to modify the title of the library, you can do so from the Title, Description, And Navi-
gation page. In addition, you can add or remove a Quick Launch link for the library.
Versioning Settings
Click the Versioning settings link on the Library Settings page to refine the document history settings 
for your library, which you can see in Figure 11-15. SharePoint Online is designed to provide a frame-
work for document version control and workflow. You can easily set up and control version history as 
well as require documents to be checked out when edited. The sections that follow take a closer look 
at key Versioning Settings page options.

	
Library Settings    235
Figure 11-15 The document library Versioning Settings page.
Content Approval
Microsoft designed the Content Approval feature so that SharePoint sets the Approval Status of new 
documents added to the library to Pending and requires approval of the document before anyone 
other than the author or administrators can see it. For users of Plan P1, Content Approval should be 
disabled. With Content Approval turned on, Figure 11-16 shows the Pending status of a new docu-
ment in the Approved Status column. 
Figure 11-16 A new document showing Pending status after Content Approval enabled.

236   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Because of the default permissions set for Plan P1, Content Approval does not work as you would 
expect from the description. In Plan P1, the default permissions allow all Office 365 users to contrib-
ute to the contents of your document library. As a result, when Content Approval is enabled, pending 
documents can be viewed and approved by any user. Even so, it can be useful to have all submissions 
automatically set to Pending status to note whether it has been reviewed. In the E plans, users do not 
automatically have rights to SharePoint Online, so this feature works as intended. 
Document Version History
You can use the options in the Document Version History section to designate versions as major or 
minor versions as well as limit the number of versions saved. Major versions are whole numbers such 
as 1, 2, and 3, whereas minor versions are incremented in decimals, such as version 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, and 
so on. Everyone can view major versions, but only a select group of people can view minor versions, 
even though they are stored in the same document library as major versions. For larger organizations, 
this feature can be invaluable in preventing pre-release versions of important documents from being 
viewed. Small businesses will generally want to create a new version for both major and minor (draft) 
versions. 
When you save a document to a document library that has versioning enabled, you are asked to 
specify the version number. If you don’t, the version number is automatically incremented. Keep in 
mind that each version you keep consumes storage that counts against your SharePoint Online stor-
age quota. It’s a good idea to limit the number of versions kept for both major and minor versions; 
otherwise, the system will keep an unlimited number of versions, which could quickly consume your 
storage allotment. 
Note  The Draft Item Security setting works in coordination with the minor drafts feature 
as well as Content Approval, but most small businesses are not likely to need it. By default, 
in Plan P1, all users can read and approve a draft item. As a result, this setting has no effect 
unless you customize the security for the library.
Require Check Out
Turning on Require Check Out forces users to take ownership of the document they want to edit 
before they can open it, and it prevents others from editing the document at the same time. In addi-
tion, enabling this feature disables editing by using OWA.
Checking in and checking out documents is a major feature of SharePoint Online that you’ll learn 
more about later in this chapter. In general, you will want to require check-out whenever your busi-
ness involves collaborating on important documents and it’s vital to avoid versioning issues, such as 
those that occur when two people are editing different versions of the same document. 

	
Library Settings    237
Recommended Settings
For general use in a small business, I recommend the following settings based on the default configu-
ration for Plan P1:
■
■
Content Approval: No.
■
■
Document Version History: Create major and minor (draft) versions; keep ten copies of both 
minor and major drafts. 
■
■
Draft Item Security: Disabled.
■
■
Require Check Out: Depends on your use case. If the documents are actively being edited or 
reviewed by multiple people, requiring check-out can be useful. If the documents are finished, 
read-only, or templates, they do not require check-out. 
Click OK to apply the versioning changes. The changes go into effect immediately.
Workflow Settings
The Library Settings page shown in Figure 11-14 includes a link to Workflow Settings, from which you 
can configure a three-stage workflow, or a set of predefined actions for a document. For example, you 
could create a workflow such as “When Kim adds a document with ‘Budget’ in the title, send an email 
to the Budget Committee group.” However, the web-based interface for this feature is a bit awkward 
and quite limited. 
Instead, I recommend using Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010, which you can download from 
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=16573. With this free tool, you can 
create very useful workflows, without writing any code. To get started, go to http://office.microsoft.com/
en-us/sharepoint-designer-help/introduction-to-designing-and-customizing-workflows-HA101859249.
aspx. You can attach these workflows to many items in SharePoint Online, such as lists, documents, 
contacts, and calendars. 
Delete a Document Library or Document
You can delete a document library by clicking the Delete This Document Library option in the Library 
Settings. You will see a message confirming that you approve sending the item to the Recycle Bin. 
If you click OK, then the document library, the documents it contains, versions, and settings will be 
removed. To delete an individual document, select it in the document library, and then on the ribbon, 
click Delete or right-click the document, and then select Delete.

238   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Recover from the Recycle Bin
Of course, not everything that is deleted should be deleted, and Microsoft has kindly added a two-
stage safety net for deleted items. If you have deleted a document or library that you want to recover, 
the Recycle Bin holds a copy of the deleted items for 30 days. Selecting the Recycle Bin shows the 
items available to be recovered. This is called the End User Recycle Bin; it is available to all end users 
by default.
Figure 11-17 shows the Cruise World Overview PowerPoint file in the Recycle Bin. Kim can recover 
the file by clicking Restore Selection or she can delete the file from the Recycle Bin by clicking Delete 
Selection. If she deletes the selection, her Recycle Bin appears empty. If she does nothing, after 30 
days, the file is permanently deleted. 
Figure 11-17 Recovering a document from the team site Recycle Bin.
For purposes of example, Suppose that Kim deleted the file from the bin—even then, the file is still 
not lost. It is simply moved to stage 2. Kim can contact the service administrator (you, in this case), 
who has the ability to restore items that were deleted from the Recycle Bin by users. 
As administrator, you go to the document library from which the item was deleted. At the top of 
the page are instructions on how you can access items deleted from the library by using the Site Col-
lection Recycle Bin link. Click the link (also at the top of the page) to access the Site Collection Admin-
istration Recycle Bin page. Then, choose Deleted From End User Recycle Bin , as shown in Figure 11-18 
(on the left). Now you can easily restore Kim’s PowerPoint by selecting the file and clicking Restore 
Selection.

	
Library Settings    239
Figure 11-18 Recovering a file from the end-user Recycle Bin.
You can also restore any other item deleted from the Site Collection by using the option End User 
Recycle Bin Items, which shows you items that have not yet been deleted from the end-user recycle 
bins—those files are still in stage 1.
Note that when items are deleted, they must be recovered within 30 days or they will be perma-
nently discarded. 
Manage Permissions 
As mentioned earlier, permissions in SharePoint Online for Plan P1 allow all your users to access your 
SharePoint Online site. In addition, they can write, delete, and create content on the site, but they are 
not full administrators.
Even if you have no need to create protected content for your users, you should have a basic 
understanding of how SharePoint Online security works. You will need this information when you 
start sharing content with users outside of your organization.
Using the Summer Catalog Project document library as an example, try setting up permissions so 
that only Kim and Karen can access the library. Of course, the service administrator can access any 
content, so the goal is not to block service administrators but to keep others from viewing the docu-
ment library. When the document is ready, they will post the document to another location where 
people can view the document.
To access the permissions for the library, on the Document Library Settings page, in the Per-
missions And Management column, click Permissions For This Document Library link, as shown in 
Figure 11-14. 

240   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Clicking Permissions For This Document Library opens a page similar to Figure 11-19.
Figure 11-19 Document library default permissions.
The Name column lists all the groups, roles, and users who have permissions to the library. You can 
see that, by default, there are a number of assignments. The most important one is the strange-looking 
Tenant Users listing. This is the group that gives permissions to all your users. The Owners entry is also 
active, in that it contains an entry for the site administrator. Those two settings are the “active” entries 
in this list. You can verify this by clicking each entry; you will see that all the listings are empty except 
for those two groups.
At the top of the page is a very important note: This Library Inherits Permission From Its Parent. In 
other words, this document library does not have any explicit permissions assigned to it. The permis-
sions you see flow down, or are inherited, from the overall team site to which it belongs.
As a result, to set up permissions that are different from the team site, you must first take a step 
called breaking inheritance by clicking the Stop Inheriting Permissions button.
Important  You can seriously impair the functionality of your SharePoint Online service by 
adjusting permissions. Specifically, be very careful when making adjustments to settings at 
the site collection level. There is only one site collection in your subscription, and due to 
inheritance, any adjustment will apply to everything in SharePoint Online. In the example, 
you are working in a test document library, so any changes you make to this library will ap-
ply only to items continued in the library. Be sure you have a good understanding of what 
you are applying and what it will affect before making permissions adjustments.

	
Library Settings    241
When you click Stop Inheriting Permissions, you will receive a warning that you are creating unique 
permissions for the document library and that the parent site permissions will no longer affect this 
site. That’s exactly what you want, so click OK.
When you do this, you’ll notice that the permissions do not change. That is because they are cop-
ied and applied from the team site. However, the document library now has its own unique permis-
sions that can be adjusted individually. So even though they are at first exactly the same, you can now 
modify them.
You make these modifications by using the new menu items that appear after you break inheri-
tance, as shown in Figure 11-20.
Figure 11-20 The Permission Tools ribbon.
■
■
Inherit Permissions  Removes customized permissions and reverts to inheriting permissions 
from the team site.
■
■
Grant Permissions  Used for adding new users, groups, or roles to the list.
■
■
Edit User Permissions and Remove User Permissions  Use this to edit or remove permis-
sions applied to a user, group, or role.
■
■
Check Permissions  Gives you the effective permissions for a user, group, or role. This can be 
useful for situations in which users are members of more than one group or role.
■
■
Manage Access Requests  Sets the options available when users receive an Access Denied 
message. In some cases, you might want to allow people to request access. In other cases, you 
might want no options at all.
Important  Before proceeding, ensure that you are logged on as the service administrator. 
Otherwise, you will remove your own access by taking the following actions.
For the example, you want to allow only Kim and Karen access to the collection, so you need to 
remove the Tenant Users from the list. Select the check box next to Tenant Users, select Remove Users 
Permissions, and then click OK when prompted that you are about to remove all permissions for the 
group. The group will disappear.
Next, click the Owners group. In the upper left, click New, as shown in Figure 11-21.

The Grant Permissions form opens, as shown in Figure 11-22. This form is easy to use but takes a 
bit of getting used to. 
Figure 11-22 The Grant Permissions form with Check Names icon shown.
In the Select Users section, type the first part of the name you want to add, and then click the 
Check Names icon as shown in Figure 11-22. This will auto-complete the name for you, if it exists in 
your user directory. You can also click the address book icon next to the check names icon to locate 
and select multiple names. When you click OK, only Karen, Kim, and the site administrator have access 
to the site. Everyone else gets an access denied message.
Note  You can optionally send an email message to people who are granted access to a site. 
This is useful when adding people to a site, and they need to know that it is now available 
to them. 

	
Library Settings    243
You can control who can do what with the page. In some cases, you will want people to view and 
download documents but not change them. Add those users to the Viewers group. Keep in mind, 
however, that rules are additive. If you are a member of the Contributors role and the Viewers role, 
you will have all the permissions granted to both.
Permissions in SharePoint
The “Manage Permissions” section covers how to change the permission for your SharePoint 
document library, but the same knowledge applies to permissions in general. With SharePoint 
Online, you can control access to lists, calendars, wikis, blogs, custom pages, and even indi-
vidual documents. Just select the item that you want to manage, and then locate the security 
page. You can often find the security option on the ribbon; it is represented by the icon with 
two heads and a key, as shown in Figure 11-23.
Figure 11-23 Document Permissions on the document properties ribbon. 
You can learn more about permissions at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-online-
small-business-help/roadmap-grant-permissions-for-a-site-HA101966936.aspx.
Add a “Checked Out To” Column
Suppose that you go to your document library to work on a document that’s due for a review but see 
that it is checked out, as shown in Figure 11-24. You need to make edits to the document. You know 
you can open the document, save it as a new version, and then edit it, but by doing so, you then run 
the risk of creating multiple versions of the same document. How do you know who has checked it 
out? One way to find out is to hover over the document icon, which will pop up the name of the per-
son who checked out the document.

244   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-24 Hovering over the Checked Out To document icon.
This works well, but it would be easier if the library simply displayed a column that listed the 
people who have documents checked out.
The good news is that you can customize the view of your document library to suit your needs. The 
ability to modify and create new views in SharePoint Online is almost breathtaking in the number of 
options and capabilities you can control. You can add entirely new columns of information and desig-
nate their contents. For example, you could create a Status column and configure it to display one of a 
group of values, such as New, Edited, Approved, or Published. You can add columns that perform math 
based on the content of other columns. You can sort, subsort, query, and format contents in many 
ways. The online help available within SharePoint Online can get you started with any of these topics.
Adding a Checked Out To column is a simple matter because this is one of many predefined columns. 
First, on the ribbon, click Library Tools, and then select the Library tab, as shown in Figure 11-10. You’ll see 
a section on the ribbon related to managing views. Click Modify View. Then, examine the Columns 
section, as shown in Figure 11-25.
Figure 11-25 Adding columns to a document library.

	
Publish a Document Library to Outlook    245
You can add any of the columns listed by simply selecting its corresponding Display check box. In 
addition, you can rearrange the columns by changing the Position From Left setting. This is a good 
example of how SharePoint Online gives you control over your sites and enables you to make changes 
without requiring any programming. 
In this example, I’ve added the Checked Out To and Version columns. The document library now 
looks similar to Figure 11-26.
Figure 11-26 The document library showing Checked Out To and Version columns.
You can now see at a glance who has the document checked out and the latest version numbers. 
Presence in SharePoint Online
You’ll notice that something else appeared along with the Checked Out To name. The green box next 
to Karen and Andy’s name is called a Presence indicator. It shows that both Karen and Andy are online 
and available. Presence is provided by the Microsoft Lync Online service in Office 365 and is shown 
in many places, including Microsoft Office, Outlook, Outlook Web App, and SharePoint Online. Andy 
can see that Karen is available. By hovering over her name, he can bring up the Lync contact card, as 
illustrated in Figure 11-27.
Figure 11-27 A Lync Contact card in SharePoint Online.
From this card, Andy can start an email, an instant message (IM) session, call Karen from Lync 2010, 
or look up her phone number and address in the address list. This is the kind of feature you would not 
normally find in a small business because the technology required to back it up is significant. Fortu-
nately, with Office 365, it works automatically. In the right circumstances, this kind of capability can 
really save time because you can immediately connect with the right person.
Publish a Document Library to Outlook
Sometimes you might need a document when you don’t have access to SharePoint Online. At other 
times, you want the same document available to everyone all the time. With SharePoint Online, you 
can connect a document library to Outlook, such that offline copies of the documents are available 
to you anytime. You can open the documents from within Outlook and make modifications that will 

246   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
be uploaded to the document library—presuming you have permissions—when you next connect. To 
connect Outlook to a document library, open the document library in your browser. On the ribbon, 
click the Library Tools group, and then select the Library tab, as shown in Figure 11-28. 
Note  If you’re using the default team site and having trouble finding the right menu, click 
the spot shown in Figure 11-8. 
Figure 11-28 Enabling the Connect To Outlook option.
Click the Outlook icon as shown. You will then be presented with a series of approvals to confirm. 
When Outlook opens, a new folder will appear in the list of folders representing your document 
library. You can open and edit documents directly from Outlook, as shown in Figure 11-29.
Figure 11-29 A document library connected to Outlook.

	
Publish a Document Library to Outlook    247
When you open a document, you will see the message shown in Figure 11-30, stating that you are 
editing an offline document and that you should save it to your computer for uploading later. 
Figure 11-30 Offline server document.
When you click the Edit Offline button, you’re presented with another message, informing you 
that your documents will be stored on your computer in SharePoint Drafts. That’s useful but not fully 
informative. What if you want to store your drafts on a specific drive or location? You can customize 
the location by clicking Offline Editing Options in the Edit Offline prompt, as shown in Figure 11-31.
Figure 11-31 The Edit Offline dialog box showing offline editing options.
When you click OK, you can edit the document. When you close the document, if you are online, 
you will see the message shown in Figure 11-32, asking whether you want to upload the edited 
document.
Figure 11-32 The prompt when closing a document edited offline, when you’re online. 
If you don’t update the server, your copy stays local. You can upload it at any time by going to 
your SharePoint Drafts folder and opening the document. You will see the prompt shown in 11-32 
when you do. If you do update the server, you replace the online copy with your version. If version 
history is turned on, the previous version is placed in the history. 
Because you are editing an offline version of the file, using this method, if someone changes the 
file on SharePoint Online and you then copied your version to the library, you could potentially over-
write the updated version with your version. SharePoint Online will catch this situation and prompt 
you with the message, Server Copy Of This Document Has Been Updated. Your Changes Conflict With 
The Changes Made To The Server Copy. Save This File To Another Location. In this case, you need to 
resolve the version issue by saving the file locally as a new file name and then upload it to SharePoint 
Online, or alternatively, delete the SharePoint Online file and then upload the document.

Work with SharePoint Online Documents in Microsoft Office
With Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010, you can manage your SharePoint Online documents directly 
within SharePoint. In particular, Office 2010 makes it very easy to interact with SharePoint Online 
documents. In this section, you’ll learn how to open, save, check out, manage versions, revert to 
previous versions, and otherwise work with your online document from within Microsoft Office. I’ll 
focus on using Word because it is most commonly used, and the features shown also apply to Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote. Microsoft Access also interacts with SharePoint Online. 
Open a Document in Microsoft Word
If you need a document that you’ve not opened previously, just browse to the document library and 
double-click the document. If it opens in Word Web App, click Edit In Microsoft Word. You can also 
hover over the line listing for the document, click the down arrow, and then select Edit In Microsoft 
Word (see Figure 11-33).
Figure 11-33 Select the menu options for a document.
After you have worked with the document, you can open it without having to return to SharePoint 
Online. Simply start Word, click the File tab, and then click Recent. The Recent Documents list contains 
the documents you’ve accessed in SharePoint Online, as shown in Figure 11-34.
Figure 11-34 Recent documents will open from SharePoint Online.

	
Work with SharePoint Online Documents in Microsoft Office    249
Editing Online and Coauthoring
When you open a document hosted on SharePoint Online, the document might or might not be 
checked out to you, depending on the settings for the document and document library. If the docu-
ment is not checked out, other people can open and edit the document. This is a feature called 
coauthoring and can be very useful when you need to simultaneously edit a single document. If this 
occurs, you will be notified, as shown in Figure 11-35. 
Figure 11-35 A notification that others are editing a document on which you're working.
You can click the group icon to see who is editing the document, as shown in Figure 11-36.
Figure 11-36 The authors editing this document.
Now that you know who is editing your document, you can contact them by clicking their tag and 
initiating an IM session, phone call, or email. You can also see the editors and contact them by using 
the File tab in Microsoft Word, as shown in Figure 11-37.

250   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-37 The People Currently Editing list.
In addition, you can see what content is being edited by other authors. When someone saves a 
version, you will be notified and your view refreshed. If a conflict occurs, Word has a special conflict 
view. In Figure 11-38, you can see that both Andy and Karen have saved the same heading. You can 
elect to keep your changes or reject your changes. This is a useful feature for handling conflicts that 
can arise from online editing.
Figure 11-38 Conflict view in Word.
Note  Coauthoring is an Office 2010 feature and not available in all Office products. For 
example, Excel does not support coauthoring. In addition, the experience is different if one 
user has Office 2007 and the other has Office 2010. You can read more about coauthoring 
at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff718249.aspx.
Check Out a Document 
You can avoid the headaches of having more than one author on a document by checking out the 
document when you edit a file. In SharePoint Online, simply select a document, and then click Check 
Out to mark the document as belonging to you (see Figure 11-33). Note that checking out a docu-
ment does not automatically open it. When you check out the document, you are asked whether you 

	
Work with SharePoint Online Documents in Microsoft Office    251
want to use your local drafts folder. If you do not select to use your local drafts folder, you will be 
editing the document directly on SharePoint Online. There’s nothing wrong with this, but in general, 
you will want to save a copy locally for editing because it is faster and allows you to work on the 
document when you are not connected to your SharePoint site. 
After you have opened a document with Microsoft Office, you do not need to return to SharePoint 
Online to reopen it and check it out. Just open the document from your Recent Documents list, and 
it will open from SharePoint Online. You can then check out the document without leaving Microsoft 
Office. Click the File tab to display what Microsoft calls the “Backstage view.” (I just call it the File tab, 
because that’s what you click to see the page, similar to Figure 11-39.)
Figure 11-39 Checking out a document while in Microsoft Word.
When a document is checked out, anyone attempting to open the document sees the message 
shown in Figure 11-40. 
Figure 11-40 The File In Use message.

252   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Users can select to view the file or make a copy of the file and edit the new copy. They cannot 
upload and overwrite the existing document in SharePoint Online without first changing the name of 
the document. 
The Downside to Checking Out Documents
Checking out documents is a great feature and works well to prevent versioning issues. The 
downside is that if someone checks out a document and forgets to check it back in, he then 
blocks progress by other team members. In Plan P1, the default permissions are such that a 
user can discard any other user’s checkout by accessing the menu shown in Figure 11-39. If you 
have modified permissions so that this not possible, the service administrator can discard the 
checkout. 
Check In a Document (Offline Editing)
When you’re ready to check in the document, you do not need to go to SharePoint Online. Just 
open the document from your Recent Documents list, click File, and then click Check In, as shown in 
Figure 11-41.
Figure 11-41 Checking in a document within Microsoft Word 2010.
You will be asked to add comments related to the checked-in version. These comments can be 
viewed by others when reviewing the version history.
After checking in the document, the document will revert to Read Only, as shown in Figure 11-42. 

	
Work with SharePoint Online Documents in Microsoft Office    253
Figure 11-42 Selecting Server Read-Only mode.
You can click the Edit Document button to edit the document. The difference is that, because the 
document is now checked in, you are directly editing the online document instead of a local copy. 
As you can see, you can easily switch between editing online and offline, checking in and check-
ing out. Be sure to keep in mind the mode you’re in, and make sure it’s the mode that matches your 
intention.
Notice the Manage Versions button at the bottom of Figure 11-42. You can see that multiple ver-
sions of the document are on SharePoint Online and that you can manage them. One of the actions 
you can take is to hover over the icon to the right of an entry, as shown in Figure 11-43. This displays 
the Comments the author added when checking in the version.
Figure 11-43 Showing Comments in Word 2010.

254   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When you click the Manage Versions button, you see some surprising options, as shown in 
Figure 11-44.
Figure 11-44 The Manage Versions menu in Word 2010.
From this menu, you can check out a document without going to SharePoint Online! This is a very 
nice feature that shows how well Office and SharePoint Online work together. This choice simply 
appears automatically, without having to install anything or turn on any special features. This and 
other features in Office simply “wake up” when Office works with documents stored in SharePoint 
Online.
In addition, you can open any previous version shown. This is useful when you want to review part 
of a previous edition that was not carried forward into the most recent edition. If you open a prior 
version, Word lets you know that you’re not working on the latest version and offers to compare the 
two versions. Use this feature when someone has made changes to a document you are working on 
and you need to inspect every change. Also, the compare options give you a quick way to locate con-
tent in a prior version that you want to bring forward. 
You should click Refresh Server Version List to ensure that your version history is current and has 
not been updated while you are looking at the document.
Again, the key point here is that all of this activity is happening directly in Microsoft Word without 
having to go to SharePoint online. Excel and PowerPoint both have the same kinds of capabilities 
built in.

	
Work with SharePoint Online Documents in Microsoft Office    255
Recover Unsaved Documents 
SharePoint Online includes a feature to recover unsaved documents, which can be a real 
lifesaver. In fact, it saved this chapter. While directly editing the chapter on my own SharePoint 
Online site, I logged on to a different SharePoint Online site to conduct a test. When I opened 
a different Word document from that site, I inadvertently closed without saving the working 
draft of this chapter. I was sure I’d lost several hard-fought pages! Upon returning to my own 
SharePoint Online site and reopening the chapter, I was relieved to see a prompt asking wheth-
er I wanted to recover the unsaved version of my file. Answering yes restored the complete file 
to Word—a testament to the kind of resiliency built into the service.
SharePoint and OneNote
OneNote is an underappreciated Office application with which you can capture and organize unstruc-
tured information. I use it extensively to store technical details that I can then easily search for. I also 
use it for capturing important facts that I reference frequently. It integrates with Internet Explorer 
for easy capture of interesting webpages; simply click Send To OneNote in your browser to store the 
page in a OneNote notebook. At meetings or at any other time, you can toss untreated bits of infor-
mation (Windows key+N) into the notebook and sort them out later. In addition, OneNote integrates 
with Windows 7 Phone and SharePoint Online.
You can create a OneNote notebook by using the OneNote Web App. Click the OneNote icon, and 
you will see the prompt shown in Figure 11-45. 
Figure 11-45 Creating a shared OneNote notebook.

256   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Complete the form, and then click Create. You are now looking at a traditional OneNote notebook 
and can begin making entries. If you click the File tab, you’ll see similar Word-like options tailored to 
OneNote, as shown in Figure 11-46. Anyone who has rights to the online notebook can access the 
notebook by using the URL shown in the Path field in Figure 11-45. 
Figure 11-46 A shared OneNote notebook.
You can get creative about how to use OneNote for meeting items, outlines, capturing details for 
later review, and other ways your team might benefit from having a common, shared notebook. For 
example, you could create a notebook for a research project and have a tab for each person on the 
team. As they discover useful information, links, screen shots, or other suitable material, they simply 
post it to their sections. When you sync the notebook, everyone is updated. 
Note  As of this writing, a Hotfix is required for OneNote notebooks to properly synchro-
nize. You can find details at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2522098. Also, it is not recom-
mended to enable minor versions in your Version settings for a shared copy of an OneNote 
notebook. To learn more about OneNote in general, see http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/
onenote/. 
Edit the Team Site Page
Although the default template for your SharePoint Online site works fine for basic document sharing, 
you can easily customize the look of the page to suit your preferences. To edit the page, at the top of 
the team site, click the Edit This Page link. 

	
Edit the Team Site Page    257
Note  Any new pages you create will not have the Edit This Page link, so you will need to 
select Site Actions | Edit Page to enter the Edit mode for them.
When editing a page, the top menu bar changes. You will see the Editing Tools ribbon and its two 
tabs, as shown in Figure 11-47. Use the Format Text options to change fonts, format lists, insert para-
graphs, and other standard formatting functions. You add or edit text simply by typing on the page. 
Change the Title
When you are in Edit mode, you can change or add the title by typing on the page as if it were a 
Word document. You can add text anywhere you want, but some space is taken by the various parts 
already laid on the page. For example, you can add text above and below the Getting Started section 
(shown in Figure 11-47), but you cannot edit the Getting Started section itself.
Figure 11-47 Customizing the Team Site page title.
If you click the Insert tab, the ribbon changes, and you can insert pictures, tables, links, upload 
files; or insert features such as a shared calendar, announcements, contacts, or other Web Parts.
Note  The Getting Started section is a predefined Web Part added automatically to the 
team site for Plan P1. You can remove, but not edit, this section. The links contained in 
Getting Started are quite useful while you are, appropriately enough, getting started. You 
can access any of the features from other menus, but the links are handy.
SharePoint Online Web Parts
To insert or remove Web Parts, on the ribbon, in the Editing Tools group, click the Insert tab (refer to 
Figure 11-47). You can now work with a variety of Web Parts, including a document library, calendar, 
announcements, contacts, and more. To see the full list, click the More Web Parts option, but don’t 
expect to understand how to use all of the options you see there. The Content Editor Web Part is the 

258   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
one to add when you just want to type in some text and format it accordingly. Some of the options, 
such as the XML Viewer, require technical expertise to understand and use. In general, the tools you 
will use with SharePoint Online are documents and lists, so you don’t need to spend much time learn-
ing how to implement the various other options unless you have a specific need. 
Note  Remember, a Web Part is an application that you can add to your site that provides 
interactive capability. Using a Web Part, you can add functionality to your site without hav-
ing to write any software. SharePoint Online comes with many pre-built Web Parts. 
The Web Parts you can place on a page are configurable but not customizable. This means that 
you can’t add or remove functionality from the predefined Web Parts by modifying the code, but 
you can change their size, color, content, and other settings. For example, suppose that you want to 
change the Posts Web Part on the team site to say Announcements instead of Posts. First, hover over 
the downward-facing triangle on the top right of the Web Part. The menu shown in Figure 11-48 
will display, in which you can select Edit Web Part. Note that you can also delete the Web Part if you 
choose.
Figure 11-48 Configure a Web Part by selecting Edit Web Part
This opens a configuration-setting menu to the right of the Web Part with various sec-
tions that you can expand and configure. Expand the Appearance section to see the Title prop-
erty. Enter Announcements, and then click OK. The title of the Posts section will be changed to 
Announcements. 

	
Edit the Team Site Page    259
If you are the adventurous type and like to explore what happens with various settings, be careful 
because it is possible to configure your Web Part so that it does not appear or function as expected. 
As a tip, notice in the upper-left portion of Figure 11-48 that you can check out the page. This func-
tions similarly to checking out a document. If you check out a page and then discard it, your edits are 
not published.
Add an Image
You can add images to your page from your computer, a network location, or the Internet. Just place 
the cursor where you want the image to appear, click the Insert tab, and then click the Image button. 
You’ll be prompted to browse to a file or provide a URL. The URL option makes it easy to populate a 
page with pictures from Facebook, Linked In, your public website, or other resource. 
Note  If you use a URL for a publicly available image and you have added your SharePoint 
URL to Trusted Domains, every time the photo appears you will receive a warning message 
that the content from the page is coming from both trusted and untrusted sources. In this 
case, it’s best to upload a picture to SharePoint Online rather than use a URL. 
Back on the page, the ribbon will change once again to show Picture Tools options that appear 
only when an image is selected. You can resize the image dynamically by dragging the handles or 
by entering a specific size for the picture. In addition, you can specify whether you want a line drawn 
around the picture as well as how the image should be placed in relationship to the text. Figure 11-49 
shows an image from the Microsoft Office clip art collection placed on the page by clicking Float | Left.

Change the Page Layout
You might want to change the layout of your team site or other sites that you create. Using the layout 
options, you can apply different pre-existing templates to a page. You select from two-column or 
three-column, pages with headers, pages with footers, and other configurations. To change the lay-
out, select Text Layout from the Format Text menu, as shown in Figure 11-50.
Figure 11-50 Changing the page layout.
The new layout provides an additional column for new content or Web Parts.
With just a few minutes of configuring, you can create a simple but pleasant page, as shown in 
Figure 11-51, complete with announcements, a calendar of events, and a document library—and no 
coding was required.

Calendars, Contacts, and Tasks
The calendar Web Part shown in Figure 11-51 is worth exploring a bit. Click the Team Calendar link to 
display the Calendar Tools options, as shown in Figure 11-52. 

262   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-52 SharePoint Online Calendar–Connect To Outlook option.
You can add events to the calendar that viewers can see when they are on the SharePoint site, 
which is nice. But wouldn’t it be great if you could open this in Outlook? You then could view the 
team calendar side by side with your personal calendar. Wouldn’t it be even better if events you 
placed on the calendar in Outlook automatically appeared on the SharePoint Online team calendar? 
That’s exactly the functionality built in to to SharePoint calendars. Click the Calendar Tool’s Connect 
To Outlook option (see Figure 11-52); Outlook shows the SharePoint Calendar and your personal 
calendar, side by side, as in Figure 11-53.
This can be very useful for setting a team calendar that is shared with team members via Share-
Point and is viewed in Outlook. As discussed in Chapter 10, “Improving Your Business Image and Pro-
ductivity with Outlook,” you can overlay one calendar atop the other by right-clicking either calendar 
and selecting Overlay. The resulting single calendar view allows you to easily spot conflicts. 
To add an event to the calendar in Outlook, right-click a date and select whether to add a meet-
ing or an appointment. You can also drag meetings from your Outlook calendar to the SharePoint 
calendar. It’s best if you don’t send meeting requests associated with the SharePoint Online calendar, 
because that is a function that involves email and tracking who and who hasn’t accepted. Those are 
features provided in Exchange Online, not SharePoint Online. In other words, you can add events and 
key dates such as project milestones, holidays, recurring meetings, training events, and other activi-
ties, and they will automatically appear on the SharePoint Online calendar. 

	
Edit the Team Site Page    263
Figure 11-53 The SharePoint Online Calendar shown in Outlook, side by side with a personal calendar.
Similarly, you can add tasks and contacts to SharePoint Online and share them by using Outlook. 
Sharing contacts is a popular feature by which you can have a unified set of contacts available to 
all Office 365 users. Just add a Contacts Web Part to a page, and populate the list with informa-
tion. Select the Contacts Web Part, and then in List Tools, click List | Connect To Outlook. The shared 
contact list will now be available in Outlook. You can drag existing contacts to the list, which then 
become available to other users of the SharePoint Contacts list.
Add Pages to Your Team Site
Suppose that you need to create a page on your team site for a special purpose, such as for a specific 
project or for new or temporary employees to use as they come onboard. Or perhaps you want to 
create a specific list integrated with Access on its own page in the team site. The default team site 
page provides two links for adding a page: in the left menu, under Site Page, you can click the + Add 
New Page or in the Getting Started section, you can click the Add New Page link (see Figure 11-47). 
Either way, you’ll be prompted for a page name, and then you are presented with a blank page that 
you can configure as you like. Don’t forget to set page permissions according to your requirements. 
You can then access the new page in the Quick Start links on the left side of the page under Site 
Pages.

Create New Sites
So far, you have been working within a single site team site. However, you can create other kinds of 
internal-use sites for different purposes. Each site can have its own look and feel, security, feature set, 
and content. To create a new site, click Site Actions, and then select New Site. You will see a preview 
of the site templates you can add. You can scroll through the pages and see whether there’s one that 
suits your needs, keeping in mind that you can add or remove features and relocate content as you 
see fit. The predefined templates are just starting places and suggestions of ways you could build the 
simple Group Work Site, as shown in Figure 11-54, but you have many other ways to configure such a 
site, as well. 
Figure 11-54 Creating a new site—Featured Items showing Group Work Site. 
The Featured Items list does not show you all the choices. At the top of the window, click Browse 
All to view the remaining choices. Perhaps the most commonly used template is the Document Work-
space. Figure 11-55 shows a sample of it. 
In this example, the new site is called Italian Tours and can act as a shared workspace for a group 
creating a new tour offering. As you can see, the site is just a page with announcements, shared docu-
ments, tasks, users, and links Web Parts added. If you need more, check the document libraries and 
lists under Libraries and Lists, respectively, on the left. You can add, remove, or redesign the site to 
suit your requirements.

	
Create New Sites    265
Figure 11-55 A document workspace. 
When working with new sites, it’s important to pay attention to navigation. How do you get to the 
new site? Where are the links for the site going to appear? To view the navigation tree that reveals 
the hierarchy of the content, in the upper-left portion of the page, click the Folder icon, as shown in 
Figure 11-56.
Figure 11-56 Navigating sites in SharePoint Online.
You can see that the the new site, Italian Tours, is actually under the team site. So you can navigate 
back to the team site by clicking Margies Travel Team Site. When you do, you’ll see the familiar team 
site, but now there is a new menu option: Italian Tours, as shown in Figure 11-57.

266   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-57 Italian Tours is now a menu option on the Team Site page.
You can experiment further with the navigation elements by clicking Site Action | Site Settings and 
then exploring such options as Quick Launch, Top Link bar, Tree View, and Site Theme.
Roadmap to How SharePoint Sites Are Organized
If you’re confused about where sites are in relationship to each other on SharePoint Online, 
you’re not alone. Here’s how it works: with SharePoint Online and Plan P1, you are provided 
with a single site collection. A site collection is just what the name says—a collection of sites. 
To make it easy to use right out of the box, Microsoft creates a team site in that site collec-
tion. Otherwise, when you start to use SharePoint, you would see nothing there at all. So 
when you start out, you have one site in your site collection. In this case, the team site URL 
is http://margiestravel1.sharepointonline.com/TeamSite/SitePages/Home.aspx.
When you create a new site, you would expect it to be a peer of the existing site, so it might 
have a URL like http://margiestravel1.sharepointonline.com/NewSite/SitePages/Home.aspx. 
But that is not what happens. Instead, the new site is under the team site. In this example, you 
see that the URL for Italian Tours is http://margiestravel1.sharepointonline.com/TeamSite/Italy/
default.aspx. This is because in SharePoint Online, the first site in the site collection is the par-
ent of all other sites. So even though you are adding a new site, it would be more technically 
correct to call any new site a subsite. You can configure these subsites to have very different 
properties and capabilities from the parent site. In addition, you do not need the top site to 
have links to the subsites. As a result, these subsites can look and act more or less as indepen-
dent sites but cannot have unique URLs.
Create Pages for New Sites
Adding pages to a new site, other than the team site, requires a slightly different process. On the new 
site page, click Site Action, and then select New Page. You’ll then be prompted to enter a page name, 
and the page will be created using a default template. The specific appearance and layout of the new 
page depends on the kind of site that hosts the page. Experiment with different kinds of sites to see 
how pages are added to each and how they are laid out. When you find one you like, you can edit the 
page and populate it with Web Parts. 

	
Work with Lists    267
Using SharePoint Designer 2010
In addition to creating workflows, SharePoint Designer 2010 can help you build highly custom-
ized pages. Assuming you installed this free tool (using the link in the “Workflow Settings” 
section, earlier in this chapter), browse to the desired SharePoint Online page, click Site Action, 
and then select Edit In SharePoint Designer, as shown in Figure 11-58. The page will open in 
SharePoint Designer for editing. Using SharePoint Designer is an advanced topic not included 
in this book, but you can find many references and guides to SharePoint Designer by searching 
for “SharePoint Designer” at http://office.microsoft.com.
Figure 11-58 Edit in SharePoint Designer.
Work with Lists
For many businesses, just using SharePoint Online for document sharing and collaboration is well 
worth the cost of the entire Office 365 subscription. But SharePoint Online has many other capabili-
ties, including the ability to work with predefined and customized lists—for example, inventory, sales 
leads, employee lists, phone numbers, email addresses, or business assets. You can add lists to Share-
Point Online just as you can with document libraries. Lists can be highly customized to have columns 
that you choose, that can be sorted how you like, and can even interact with other lists. Features 
you’ve already learned, such as applying permissions and setting alerts, apply to lists as well as docu-
ments. You’ll find that as you learn how to do something in one area of SharePoint Online, you can 
often apply that knowledge to another area. 

268   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Create a List from an Excel Spreadsheet
If you’re like many businesses, you use Excel from time to time to keep lists of information, such as 
services, email addresses, inventory, attendees of an event, and reviews of your service. You can 
import these simple Excel lists into SharePoint, where others can see and interact with the content. 
For example, Margie’s Travel has several group travel offerings. The company uses a spreadsheet to 
track how many travelers are signed up for each, which agent owns the event, notes, and whether the 
event is a go or no-go. Rather than track this information in a spreadsheet, management decided to 
convert the content to a SharePoint Online list. Agents can then review and update the list in real time 
as well as sign up for alerts to changes. 
Note  To import an Excel spreadsheet, the SharePoint Online site must be listed in Trusted 
Sites. See the section “Troubleshoot Open With Windows Explorer,” earlier in this chapter.
To create a list from a spreadsheet, in the upper-left corner, click Site Actions, and then select 
More Options. From the list of options, select Import Spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 11-59.
Figure 11-59 Click Site Actions, More Options, and then select Import Spreadsheet.
Click Create. A dialog box opens, in which you must provide a name for the list and description. 
Next, browse to the file containing the list, and then click Import. Excel opens and asks what part of 
the spreadsheet you want to import. You can designate one of three types: Table Range, Range Of 
Cells, or Named Range. Table Range is selected by default. For the example, you want to designate a 
range of cells to import, so click Range Type, and then select Table Range, as shown in Figure 11-60.

	
Work with Lists    269
Figure 11-60 Selecting Range Of Cells in preparation for import.
After selecting Table Range, there is an important next step: you must click the Select Range text 
box before you do anything else! By placing the cursor in the Select Range box, as shown in Figure 
11-61, you can click the spreadsheet underneath and select the range to import.
Figure 11-61 Put the cursor in the Select Range box. 
When you’ve selected the correct range, click Import. Your list will import and will be hosted on 
SharePoint Online, as shown in Figure 11-62.

270   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-62 A list imported from Excel.
You can manage any individual item by clicking the down-arrow that appears when you hover over 
a line, as shown in Figure 11-63.
Figure 11-63 List item options.
At the top of the window, you can see the List tab, as illustrated in Figure 11-63 . When selected, 
many new options appear that allow you to work with and customize the list. 

	
Work with Lists    271
Add a Quick Launch Link
Now that you have your list in SharePoint Online, how do you find it again? You could make a note of 
the URL, but it’s best to create a Quick Launch link for the list. The Quick Launch link will appear on 
the left of the page when you are on the site that hosts the list.
To access this option, first select the list so that the List Tools tabs are shown. Next, select List (see 
Figure 11-65), and then click List Settings. Under General Settings, select Title, Description, And Navi-
gation. In the Navigation section, select Yes for the option Display This List In The Quick Launch Bar, 
and then click OK. Now, when you go to the team site, you can click your list from the Quick Launch 
bar. You can see the Trip Tracker list in the Quick Launch bar in Figure 11-64.
Figure 11-64 Adding a list to the Quick Launch bar.
DataSheet View
One of the most useful features for working with lists is the Datasheet view. When selected, you can 
work with a list in columns and rows, as shown in Figure 11-65. It’s like an Excel spreadsheet except 
that it’s hosted on SharePoint Online. Using this view, you can easily filter, add, edit, or delete entries.
Figure 11-65 The Datasheet view.

272   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Edit Existing Columns
One of the most powerful features of lists in SharePoint Online is the ability to create your own 
custom columns. You can add one of many predefined columns; create your own column; change the 
sequence; sort, add, and calculate columns; link two lists together by a shared value; add validations 
for content in any list; and more. 
As a basic exercise, try changing the Go-NoGo column in the example so that it appears as set of 
predefined choices: Go, NoGo, or Pending. To do this, in the upper-right portion of the page, click the 
List Settings icon, as shown in Figure 11-65. In the center of the page, the existing columns are listed 
as shown in Figure 11-66. Note that in the Type column, Go-NoGo is described as a Single Line Of 
Text.
Figure 11-66 A List of existing columns. 
By clicking the Go-NoGo column, you can reconfigure the column type and other details, as shown 
in Figure 11-67.
Figure 11-67 The Go-NoGo column as single line of text.

	
Work with Lists    273
To change this to a set of predefined choices, change the setting from Single Line Of Text to 
Choice (Menu To Choose From). After you make the change, your options change to those shown in 
Figure 11-68.
Figure 11-68 Additional column options for the Choice (Menu To Select From) setting.
You now have some nice options with which you can control how the column behaves. For exam-
ple, you can require that an entry be made for new lines and designate the default value. Note that 
SharePoint Online kindly reads your existing values and suggests those as the options for you. 
After setting the values you want, at the bottom of the page, click OK, and then return to the list. 
When you select to edit an item in the list or use Datasheet view, you will now be presented with a 
drop-down list from which you can choose one of the designated options, as shown in Figure 11-69.
Figure 11-69 The Go-NoGo drop-down list.

274   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Add New Columns
Often, the easiest way to create a list is to start with Excel and import the list, as described earlier. 
But sometimes you will want to build a list from scratch or add new columns after your list is already 
started. 
You can add existing columns to any list from a set of predefined columns, or you can create your 
own. Suppose that you wanted to add a new column to our trip tracker list to indicate whether the 
trip is a new one for Margie’s Travel. 
To do this, in the upper-right part of the page, select the List Settings option, as shown in Figure 
11-65. Under Columns, select Create Column. The form shown in Figure 11-70 opens.
Figure 11-70 Adding a Yes/No field to the list.
After entering New Tour for the column name and selecting Yes/No, when you click OK, the new 
column is added.
It’s worth taking a bit of time to explore the options under each column type. You can add col-
umns for information such as dates, numbers, currency, and even hyperlinks. In addition, you can add 
calculated fields based on other list information. This lets you generate dynamically calculated values 
that can be quite useful. For advanced users, you can create workflows that trigger when these calcu-
lated events hit specified values. In this way, you can automate processes that alert you to important 
events, such as an inventory item dropping below a threshold, or be notified when a sales region hits 
or exceeds its projections. In addition, you can mark columns as required or optional.

	
Work with Lists    275
Add Columns to Document Libraries
Here is a yet another way that Microsoft Office works with SharePoint Online—and it's one 
that you almost never hear about. You can add columns to document libraries just as you can 
to a list. This means that you can add information about a document to the document library, 
such as “last review” or “project owner.” When you do this, the custom fields actually display in 
Microsoft Office when you open the document. You can use this to update the fields when you 
edit the document, as shown in Figure 11-71.
Figure 11-71 A document showing custom SharePoint Online list values.
Reorder Columns
To change the column order, from the List Settings page, select Column Ordering. You can then indi-
cate which sequence you prefer by selecting Position From Top, as shown in Figure 11-72. 

276   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-72 Changing column order.
Filtering and Sorting
Lists (and other libraries) can be sorted and filtered. First, select the column title you want to work 
with. To order the entire list, click A On Top or Z On Top, as shown in Figure 11-73. To filter the view, 
select the entry you want to view and the list will be instantly filtered to show only those that match 
the selected entry.
Figure 11-73 Sorting and filtering columns.
Invite External Users to Share Documents
Small businesses often hire contractors and other business associates to work on content. Typically, 
a person needs an Office 365 logon and password to access your SharePoint Online site, but Plan P1 
includes the capability of inviting up to 50 outside users to a SharePoint Online site. These users do 
not need to be assigned an Office 365 license. 

	
Invite External Users to Share Documents    277
Microsoft promotes this feature as external sharing, and it’s an excellent value for the service. But 
you need to know about a couple of issues before you start inviting people to a document library.
Limited to Live ID Authentication
For people to authenticate to your SharePoint Online site, they must use a Windows Live ID (https://
login.live.com). This is a free service by which you can create a new email address or validate an exist-
ing email address by using the Live ID mechanism. In other words, a contractor or business associate 
could go to https://login.live.com and enable her email address for use with a Live ID and then use it 
to log on to your SharePoint Online document site. 
Send an Invitation
Inviting someone to your site is simple. From the team site, click Share This Site or select Site Actions | 
Share Site. You can then enter the email address (or addresses) you want to invite in either the Visitors 
or Members column. If you select Visitors, as shown in Figure 11-74, the user cannot edit or publish 
documents. This is a good choice when you need people to view frequently updated documents that 
are too large for email. Select Members when you want to allow the user to edit and post documents 
as well as interact with lists. Use the Message field to type a personal welcome to the site, which 
will be included in the standard email invitation sent to the specified user. Click Share to send the 
invitation.
Figure 11-74 Inviting an external user as a visitor to your site.
Although you can customize the standard invitation with a personal message, you cannot change 
the design of the email, which is shown in Figure 11-75. When the user accepts, she is authenticated 
and taken directly to your site.

278   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 11-75 An invitation to collaborate sent to the user.
Restrict External Users to Specific Content
Although sharing the site is a great feature and is easy to do, you must keep one important consid-
eration in mind: if you share the team site with an external user, he will by default have permissions 
to view all your content. When you invite the user to join the site as a Visitor or Member, he is placed 
into a predefined security group by that name. By default, both these groups have permissions to 
view all the content on SharePoint Online. (See “Manage Permissions,” earlier in this chapter and 
Figure 11-19.)
Even though this is the scenario that Microsoft has enabled by placing a Share This Site With Addi-
tional People link on the Team Site home page, it is likely that you will want to limit external users to 
only a specific document library. Here’s how to do it:
1.	
Create a new site to contain the content that you share with outside users. From the Team Site 
home page, click Site Actions, and then click Create New Site. Select the type of site that you 
want to create. The Document Workspace is a good basic template for a document-sharing 
site.
2.	
Within the new site, click Site Actions, and then select Site Settings. Under Users And Permis-
sions, click Site Permissions.
3.	
Click Stop Inheriting Permissions, and then click OK.

	
Invite External Users to Share Documents    279
4.	
Click Create Group. Provide a suitable name for the group, such as External Users. 
5.	
Set the permissions level of the group to a suitable level, such as Contribute. Leave other 
settings the same, unless you have specific reasons for changing them and understand their 
purpose.
6.	
Click Create to open a page on which you can add and edit settings for the group.
7.		
Under Settings, click Make Default Group, as shown in Figure 11-76. You can now send invita-
tions to external users to join the External Users group rather than the Members group.
Figure 11-76 Selecting Make Default Group.
8.	
At the prompt Do You Want To Make The Current Group The Default Members Group, click 
OK—that’s exactly what you want.
Now when you click Site Actions | Share Site, the form looks a bit different, as Figure 11-77 illus-
trates. Instead of listing Members as the second option, your new security group appears (shown in 
the figure as External Users).
Figure 11-77 The updated form shows custom security group.

280   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When you enter a user’s Hotmail address in the External Users field, she will be added to the Exter-
nal Users security group and limited to the content in the new site. Clicking any links to other content 
results in an access denied message. Using this method, you can create multiple sites and security 
groups, keeping each isolated from the others. 
Mobile Devices
Most mobile devices have browsers that permit users to log on to SharePoint Online. As of this writ-
ing, the following mobile devices are supported:
■
■
Windows Phone 7+
■
■
Windows Mobile 6.1+ (Internet Explorer mobile and Office Mobile 2010 for 6.5.x devices)
■
■
Nokia S60 3.0 or later E series and N series devices
■
■
Apple iPhone 3.0 or later
■
■
Blackberry 4.2 or later
■
■
Android 1.5 or later
As a result, you can interact with lists, calendars, tasks, and other content through the mobile 
browser. In some cases, it might be best to view the content through a specialized page by appending 
?Mobile=1 to the URL. For example, if your URL is http://margiestravel1.sharepoint.com, the mobile 
URL would be http://margiestravel1.sharepoint.con?Mobile=1.
If you have a phone running Windows Phone 7, you can access your SharePoint Online site by 
using the Office Hub. The Office Hub lists the content from SharePoint Online sites and allows you 
to access the content from your phone. You can find instructions for connecting the Office Hub to 
SharePoint Online at http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/sharepoint-online-small-business-help/use-a-
mobile-device-to-work-with-sharepoint-online-sites-HA102109237.aspx. Alternatively, search for Use a 
mobile device to work with SharePoint Online sites. 
Other mobile devices, including iPhones and iPads, have applications available specifically for 
working with SharePoint sites and Office documents. Search your device’s application store for apps 
to connect your device to SharePoint Online. 
More Info For a deeper discussion of mobile devices and Office 365, see Chapter 9, 
“Working with Mobile Devices.” In addition, the most accurate and up-to-date information 
about which devices are officially supported for use with SharePoint Online is always avail-
able in the SharePoint Online Service Description. Finally, Microsoft publishes an Office 365 
Mobility Services Description. Both of these documents can be found at http://www.microsoft.
com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13602.

	
Publish a Public Website    281
Publish a Public Website
SharePoint Online comes with a public website that can be accessed anonymously on the Web. The 
site is built using a feature called the Site Designer that configures the pages for you. Site Designer is 
well-suited for a business that only needs a low-traffic, public website with basic information about 
the business, such as contact information, a description of your business, location, hours, bios, or 
other details. You can add downloadable content as well as other useful functionality. 
Use a Custom URL
The default website, shown in Figure 11-78, is created for you when you subscribe to Office 365 and 
can be accessed from the URL located in the Home portal, listed under Website. In our example of 
Margie’s Travel, the website URL is http://margiestravel1.sharepoint.com/Pages/default.aspx.
Figure 11-78 The default public website.

282   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
You can change the URL to a custom URL such as http://margiestravel.com by validating the cus-
tom domain in the Admin portal and delegating DNS services to Microsoft. When the custom domain 
is validated and delegated, you can open https://portal.microsoftonline.com and select Domains from 
the left side of the page. There you will find a link line that states, Your SharePoint Website Address Is 
Http://<Yourcompany>.Sharepoint.Com (Change Address), as shown in Figure 11-79. When you click 
the Change Address link, you will have the option of assigning your custom domain name to the site.
More Info For details about adding custom URLs to Office 365, see Chapter 6, “Working 
with Custom Domains.”
Figure 11-79 Changing the website address. 
Note  Be sure you have finished creating your website before you change the URL, because 
the website will be available to the general public as soon as you make this change.
Customize the Website
You can change the content and appearance of your site. To begin, browse to your website and click 
Member Login. Alternatively, you can log on to SharePoint Online with your administrator credentials, 
click Website (in the top menu bar), and then click Home. The home page will open in the website 
designer, as shown in Figure 11-80.

	
Publish a Public Website    283
Figure 11-80 The Public Website Wizard.
You can quickly customize the look of the page by using the Color, Setup, Footer, Text, Theme, 
Style, and Format options. In addition, you can add pages and arrange the hierarchy of pages. 
The boxes in the body of the page are zones. You can resize each zone independently by clicking 
the handle at the upper-left corner of each. Right-click in a zone to open a properties menu in which 
you can configure the background and other settings, as shown in Figure 11-81.
Figure 11-81 The Zone Format menu.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
If you click the Insert tab at the top of the page, new options become available, as shown in Figure 
11-82. Using this ribbon, you can insert images, tables, links, and gadgets, with which you can embed 
slideshows, maps, videos, a “contact us form” so that users can email you, and other elements.
Figure 11-82 The Insert ribbon for the webpage designer.
As you can see, Microsoft has made it simple for anyone to configure a nice-looking website 
with the basic information needed for many small businesses. In addition to adding basic text, the 
dynamic, predefined gadgets help provide a polished look-and-feel as well as useful functionality. 
More Info It is beyond the scope of this book to cover all the design capabilities provided 
by the public website feature in SharePoint Online. You can find a good description of each 
of the options at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-online-small-business-help/
CL102040066.aspx, or search for “design a public-facing website.” Also, you can watch 
a good introduction video at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-online-small-
business-help/video-design-your-business-website-VA102586182.aspx, or search for “Video: 
Design your business website.”
Limitations of the Public Site
Before you make a choice about the SharePoint Online public site, you should be aware of some 
limitations: 
■
■
The public-facing website is not intended for high-traffic scenarios. 
■
■
There can be only one public website.
■
■
You cannot use SharePoint Designer to manage the site.
■
■
You cannot transfer a site from Windows Live Small Business to the public site.
■
■
You cannot connect to a database-driven application or pre-built applications such as Word-
Press or other open-source web applications.
A business that needs dynamic content, such as an online shopping cart, user forums, blogs, or a 
registration system, should not consider using the SharePoint Online public website because it does 
not currently support this kind of functionality. 

	
Advanced Topics and Resources    285
Advanced Topics and Resources
SharePoint online has many features that we have not discussed. Some of these might interest you 
but would require entire books to explain. This chapter has focused on features and capabilities that 
you can implement without custom code or specialized technical skills, such as designing a database. 
However, you can write custom applications for SharePoint Online by using sandboxed solutions. This 
gives you tremendous flexibility to provide specific features—such as custom workflows, integrated 
mobile applications, forms processing, and other line-of-business integrations—that go beyond what 
you can create using pre-built Web Parts. These applications are referred to as sandboxed because 
they have some limitations enforced by the host environment. In other words, Microsoft limits the 
scope of custom SharePoint Online applications so that they do not risk the performance and avail-
ability of the service. 
In addition, Plan P1 includes Access Web Services, with which you can integrate Access databases 
with SharePoint Online. Consider the possibilities of having an Access database available online that 
all of your users can view, add to, and edit. This can normally be achieved only by using a shared in-
house database. For example, just as you can create a list from Excel, you can publish a basic database 
to SharePoint Online. In this way, the database itself is on SharePoint Online, but you can use Access 
as a front end. Access has some templates provided that can be published to SharePoint Online, and 
SharePoint Online has several templates in the Web Database category (as shown in Figure 11-83) 
that can be opened by using Access or run as an online database. 
Figure 11-83 Web Database templates built into SharePoint Online that can interact with Access.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Having your data on a centralized, Internet-available repository can provide creative ways to solve 
business problems. For example, when gathering data from personnel in the field, you can aggregate 
information for everyone to see and use, or you can create specialized lists and workflows, based on 
incoming data.

Working with Lync Online
S
ome technologies, such as cell phones and the Internet, we just take for granted. How did busi-
nesses ever get along without out them? Microsoft Lync Online is like that, revolutionizing busi-
ness communications so subtly that we don’t really notice it until we discover that we don’t want to 
manage without it. 
Crafting an email and waiting for a response takes time, which is a commodity you might not have 
when you’re facing a deadline. Instead, with Lync Online, you can check to see whether the person 
you need to contact is online and instant message her. If she isn’t online, you can right-click her name 
and set a “flag” to be notified if her status changes. The second she logs in, you’ll be notified. 
If you want to make a voice call to someone, with Lync Online it’s one click away, no matter where 
in the world he is or whether you remember his phone number. While you’re on the phone, you want 
to send the URL you’re discussing to your colleague—just paste it into Lync 2010. There's no need 
to hassle with email; a record of the URL instantly appears in your Conversation History folder in 
Microsoft Outlook. Need to pull others into the conversation? Even arranging an online meeting with 
a shared workspace is just a click of a button in Outlook. 
With today’s distributed workforce, the ability to stay connected with Lync Online adds a lot of 
value. Throw in its many other features, such as hosting online meetings for people outside of your 
organization and the ability to remotely control another person’s desktop, and you’ll wonder how you 
ever managed without it. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use the Lync 2010 client to make the best 
of your Lync Online services. In addition, the chapter reviews how Lync Online interacts with other 
services and describes some administrative settings for Lync Online that you should know how to use. 
Get to Know the Lync 2010 Client
First, some basic terminology: Lync Online is the online service hosted by Microsoft. The Lync 2010 
client is a specialized application that is installed on your computer, which communicates with Lync 
Online. After Microsoft Office 365 is set up on your computer, the Lync 2010 client appears each time 
the computer is started. It automatically logs on to Office 365 and makes your presence known to 
other Office 365 users. 
At first, the Lync 2010 client looks rather plain. As shown in Figure 12-1, it contains no picture of 
you or anyone else, no contact information, and no groups. But it takes only a few minutes to have 
your client fully customized and connected.

288   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-1 The Lync 2010 client. 
Lync at Work
A company like Microsoft relies heavily on the services provided by Lync, but does a small busi-
ness need the same features as an enterprise? Although a large, international company like Mi-
crosoft makes daily use of almost all the features of Lync 2010, smaller businesses will primarily 
use those key features of Lync Online that will be most helpful to their productivity. 
The degree to which you use any particular Lync Online feature depends on the type of 
business you have. Is your work force geographically separated? If so, Lync can help you keep 
in touch with presence, voice, and online meetings. Without Lync, you simply don’t know 
what’s going on with your staff. With Lync Online, you can see at glance who is online, who is 
available, and any current status information that they want to share (“Cell phone dead, call 
hotel!”). Scenarios like these and many others are well served by Lync Online.
Also keep in mind what Lync Online will not do. You cannot use Lync Online to dial phone 
numbers. You can call other Lync Online users regardless of their location, as long as they are 
on the Internet, but you can’t punch in a phone number and dial it. For that kind of service, 
consider Skype.
You should also be aware of limitations when using Lync Online in specific countries. For 
example, Lync Online uses Voice over IP (VoIP) for voice conference calls, but that capability is 
restricted in some countries. You can find the current list of countries that have such restrictions 
at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/licensing-restrictions.aspx.

	
Get to Know the Lync 2010 Client    289
Sign In to Lync Online
Normally, Lync 2010 will open and sign in to Office 365 automatically when you start your computer. 
If Lync 2010 doesn’t start for some reason, you can start it manually from your Start menu. Click Start 
| All Programs | Microsoft Lync, and then select Lync 2010. 
The first time you open Lync 2010, you will be asked to provide your logon credentials, as shown in 
Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2 Signing in for the first time.
It’s important to use your Office 365 email address for both Sign-In Address and User Name so 
that Lync 2010 can connect to Lync Online. After the first time you start Lync 2010, you do not have to 
enter the credentials again until your password changes. By default, password changes are required 
every 90 days. 
Open the Options Menu
The Lync 2010 client doesn’t take up much space, but it has a surprising number of options. If you 
aren’t familiar with the user interface, it can take a bit of time to find key features. For example, where 
are the configuration menus? To open the Options menu, in the upper-right side of the Lync client, 
click the Cog icon, as shown in Figure 12-3. Take a moment to find it now, because you’ll be using the 
Options menu throughout this chapter.

290   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-3 The Lync 2010 Options menu.
Configure Audio and Video
Lync Online can use a USB headset (or one that uses plugs) and a video camera for online commu-
nications. Often, laptops have built in microphones that work with Lync Online, but if you plan to 
regularly use Lync Online for voice calls, it’s preferable for call quality, as well as privacy, to have a 
headset with a microphone. Webcams also often have microphones. As a result, it’s pretty common 
for a single system to have more than one microphone available for use. For this reason, you should 
click Options | Audio Device, and then ensure that the specific microphone and speakers you plan to 
use regularly are selected, as shown in Figure 12-4.
When you plug a headset into your computer, set Lync 2010 to use the device and then remove 
the headset. Lync 2010 will automatically change its settings to use an available device. Later, when 
you plug the headset back in, Lync 2010 will automatically use the headset. 
Even so, if you try to make call and can’t hear or be heard, check this setting, because periodically, 
your system can lose its configuration.
After selecting the device you want, you can adjust the levels for the microphone and audio by 
using the sliders under each device.
Of special interest is the Secondary Ringer setting. This should be set to your computer speakers so 
that you can hear incoming calls without using your headset.
If you select Custom Device, you can select different devices for different purposes. For example, 
you could use the built-in microphone from your computer or webcam, but use a headphone for 
audio.
Setting video is similar. Simply click Video Device, and then select the webcam to use. You will see 
a video feed from the selected device, and you can tune the picture by using the Webcam settings 
options. 

	
Personalize Lync 2010    291
Figure 12-4 The Audio Device settings page.
Personalize Lync 2010
One of the first actions I recommend is to take a few moments to personalize Lync 2010. There are a 
number of possible options, including adding a photo that will display for you and anyone else who 
adds you as a contact. 
Add Your Picture
As explained in Chapter 4, “The Dual Purpose Office 365 Portal,” the best way to add a picture is in 
the Office 365 portal. When you add a photo to the Office 365 portal, the picture is automatically 
displayed in Lync 2010. By placing a picture in the portal, Microsoft can use it in other services. If you 
added a picture to the portal, you can skip this section because your picture will already be shown.
Any picture you add is visible to you and other users and makes the service more user-friendly. In 
larger organizations, having photos in Lync is quite important because people can associate a face 
with a name. In smaller organizations, having pictures in Lync 2010 can help with temporary work-
ers and other new hires. But in my experience, the real value is how adding pictures makes Lync 2010 
more attractive and communication more interesting.

292   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Alternatively, you can link to a picture from a public website. In my testing, sites such as Flickr and 
SkyDrive did not work because they require that you view a picture in a photo album or webpage and 
do not provide direct links to an individual photo. If you provide a URL to your photo that does not 
require authentication, the image will display. 
Picture Requirements 
The picture and its location need to meet three general requirements:
■
■
The size should be a 1-inch to 1.5-inch square.
■
■
The picture size should be no more than 30 KB. If you don’t know the size of a picture, save it 
to your computer, right-click the image, and view the properties. 
■
■
The website that hosts the picture must not require authorization to access it.
Specify the URL
After you have a picture that meets these requirements, browse to the Internet location where the 
photo is located and copy the URL (highlight and then press Ctrl+C). Open the My Pictures form by 
clicking the picture profile in Lync 2010, or open the Options menu shown in Figure 12-4, and then 
select My Picture from the menu. The page shown in Figure 12-5 opens. 
Figure 12-5 The My Picture page in Lync 2010.

	
Personalize Lync 2010    293
Select Show A Picture From A Web Address, and paste (Ctrl+V) or type in the URL. Click Connect 
To Picture to load the picture into Lync 2010, as demonstrated in Figure 12-6. 
Figure 12-6 A picture added to Lync 2010 from website.
Click Close; the photo appears at the top of Lync 2010, as shown in Figure 12-7.
Figure 12-7 Lync 2010 configured with a photo.
Set Your Location
In Figure 12-7, notice the small downward-facing triangle next to the Set Your Location setting. This 
little jewel can be very helpful in communicating your current location to others. For example, it could 
be useful for coworkers to know when you’re in the office, working from home, at a convention, hotel, 
or other site. From my experience, it has been very helpful to see that someone whom you're trying 
to reach is actually “in the building” or “on vacation.” 

294   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
To set a location, just click Set Your Location and start typing. You can disable showing others your 
location, if you choose, or clear custom locations by clicking the down-arrow, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Figure 12-8 The location menu.
Set Your Activity 
At the top of the Lync 2010 client is a text balloon that asks, “What’s happening today?” You can enter 
anything in this box, and it will appear to others in your contact card in their Lync 2010 client. This is a 
great way to broadcast what’s going in your world, from personal (“Go Seahawks”) to business (“Trav-
eling, expect delayed response”) or both (“At doctor, back tomorrow”).
It’s not well known, but you can add a URL in the activity area. This makes it easier to communicate 
online content that’s interesting or informative to your colleagues.
Figure 12-9 Activity with URL.
Add Your Phone Numbers
The Options menu also has a section for you to add your phone numbers. This can be quite important 
when people need to reach you and can easily access your mobile phone or home phone number. 
When added, your numbers are available using the Lync Contact card (covered later in this chapter), 
which appears in a number of places.
Set Ringtones and Sounds
You can further personalize the Lync 2010 client by setting the ringtone you want to sound when 
someone calls you by using Lync. Open the Options menu, and select Ringtones And Sounds. Then 
test the different sounds to find one that you like. If you cannot hear the ringtones, check the Audio 
Device settings.

	
Add Contacts     295
Add Contacts 
When installed, Lync 2010 has no contacts listed. You can easily add contacts from within your com-
pany or other Office 365 organizations. In addition, Microsoft intends to allow MSN Messenger and 
Windows Live Messenger users to interact with your organization, but as of this writing, this feature 
has been temporarily disabled from Plan P1. E plan users do have this capability.
From Your Organization
Adding people from your organization is a simple process of typing their names (or some portion of 
their names) in Lync 2010. You will see the list of available contacts as you type. Click the plus sign (as 
shown in Figure 12-10), and select Pin To Frequent Contacts to add the selected person to the list of 
your frequent contacts, or choose All Contacts to add her to the All Contacts list. 
Figure 12-10 Adding a contact.
When someone adds you as a contact, you receive a notification, as shown in Figure 12-11, and 
you have the option to add the person to your own contact list. 
Figure 12-11 The notification that you’ve been added as a contact.

296   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When you’ve added more contacts than you can easily manage in a single list, you can create a 
group and assign a contact to that group. This helps when you have teams of people with whom you 
work on specific tasks. 
To create a group, just right-click Frequent Contacts or All Contacts, and then select Create New 
Group. You can then right-click any contact and select to move the contact to the group. 
With most small businesses, you won’t have enough contacts for people in your organization 
to make it difficult to manage, but with Lync Online, you can add people outside of your company, 
as well. 
Add Contacts From Outside Your Company
Lync Online has the ability to communicate with Office 365 users at other companies through a 
feature called instant messaging federation. To add a user who is not part of your organization but is 
an Office 365 Lync Online user, simply type his email address into the Lync 2010 client. You can now 
interact with the user, provided his Lync Online system is configured to permit communications out-
side his company. By default, this capability is enabled in Plan P1. Using this feature, you can instant 
message, transfer files, use voice and video, and share applications and video with Office 365 users, 
worldwide. In addition, you can instant message with users of Windows Live Messenger, but you can-
not engage in voice communications or advanced features of Lync 2010. You’ll learn how to configure 
these capabilities in the “Lync Online Administration” section later in this chapter.
Note  As of this writing, the ability to communicate with other instant messaging service 
providers, such as Yahoo, Google Talk, ICQ, and Skype, is not available. Microsoft is working 
on expanding the list of services with which Lync Online can interact.
Use the Contact Card
After you’ve added a contact, you can use the person’s contact card in Lync 2010 and other applica-
tions to start an instant message (IM) session, email the user, start a call, share your desktop, or look 
up information such as a phone number.
Hovering over the name of the contact (and you need to point to the name, not just the picture) 
or clicking on the entry in Lync 2010 opens a contact card fly-out panel (see Figure 12-12). Each of the 
icons on the card initiates the actions you would expect. Email, instant messaging, and voice calls are 
all indicated by the envelope chat bubble and handset, respectively. The last icon is for the Additional 
Choices menu.

	
Use the Contact Card    297
Figure 12-12 Hovering over a contact’s name shows the person’s contact card.
You can click the down-facing triangles shown in Figure 12-12 to reveal more options. When you 
click the phone icon, Lync initiates a call. If you click the down-facing triangle next to the phone, you’ll 
see the contact’s phone numbers and a little-known feature: you can present the conversation subject 
to the contact when the call is made (see Figure 12-13). This can help the person receiving the call to 
distinguish between an urgent business matter and a casual call.
Figure 12-13 The phone menu from the contact card.
This menu also shows you the contact’s phone numbers. Sometimes the ability to quickly locate a 
person’s mobile phone number is exactly what you need.
Note  Figure 12-13 shows phone numbers, but you cannot call those numbers directly by 
using Lync Online. There is even a New Number option that is dimmed (unavailable). Why 
is there a New Number menu option when you can’t dial out? The Lync 2010 client you use 
for Lync Online is the same one used for an on-premises server system called Lync 2010 
Server. When Lync 2010 is used with the on-premises server, it is possible to dial out using 
Lync 2010. In this way, Microsoft has only one client to maintain, which reduces its costs and 
helps keep the service price low. The downside is that features can appear in Lync 2010 and 
other applications that are not actually available when used with Office 365.
Also, the Additional Choices menu (shown in Figure 12-14) has useful options for quickly starting 
a video call (which is the same as a voice call, but a video session is initiated, as well), sharing your 
desktop, adding the user to your contacts, or tagging the user for status change alerts.

298   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-14 The Additional Choices menu.
When you need to reach someone the moment they become available, tag them, using the Tag 
For Status Change Alerts setting. When she logs on, using OWA or Lync 2010, or when the person’s 
status changes in any other way (for example, from busy to available), you will be notified. This is a 
great way to be flagged when someone you must speak with right away becomes available.
The larger down-facing arrow on the contact card expands the card to phone numbers, organiza-
tional information, email address, and other details.
The contact card appears in Microsoft Office applications, including Outlook 2010. Because the 
contact card is so accessible, you can easily initiate a call or IM session without leaving Outlook.
Presence and Lync Online
Connecting with someone is just a click away with Lync 2010, but before you start a call or IM session, 
be mindful of the person’s online status. Although it’s great to be connected to others when you need 
them, it can be less than thrilling to have an instant message appear when your laptop is projected in 
a meeting, conference, or otherwise shared with coworkers. Also, before sending personal or sensitive 
messages, keep in mind that other people might be in the room with your contact. 
The ability of Lync Online to broadcast your online status and availability is called presence. Your 
presence can be any of several status conditions, ranging from Available to Offline. 
Status Indicators
The different status indicators that you can manually set are shown in Figure 12-15.

	
Presence and Lync Online    299
Figure 12-15 Status indicators and messages. 
A variety of colors and accompanying status messages can be shown. You can set your status 
manually or allow the system to manage your status for you. Lync Online displays Busy automatically 
when you’re scheduled to be in a meeting and will also display the message, In A Meeting. Similarly, 
if you’re available and then receive or make a Lync Online call, your status changes to Busy and shows 
the message, In A Call. I’ve found the automatic management to be quite accurate and useful.
The Do Not Disturb status is of particular importance. When your status is Do Not Disturb, you 
cannot be contacted via Lync 2010. Lync 2010 will never automatically place you in Do Not Disturb 
mode. Use this setting or sign out of Lync Online when you do not want any interruptions.
Manually Set Status
The automatic management of your status works quite well, but sometimes you will want to make 
adjustments. If a meeting on your calendar is canceled but still listed on your calendar, your status will 
change to busy when the meeting was scheduled to start. You can manually set your status by using 
the Available pull-down menu, as shown previously. Note that you can also use this menu to sign out 
of Lync 2010; in fact, this is the easiest way to do so. 
Another way to change your status is to hover over the Lync 2010 icon in the taskbar at the bottom 
of your screen, as shown in Figure 12-16.

300   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-16 Hover to quickly change status.
Presence in Other Programs
One of the great aspects about Lync Online is that you can also see the status of your colleagues in 
Outlook Web Access and Microsoft Office applications. Figure 12-17 shows presence in an Outlook 
Web App email. 
Figure 12-17 Presence in Outlook Web App.
The Special Case of Outlook Web App
Outlook Web App (OWA) is unique because presence and instant messaging are built in. In other 
words, you can change your presence, see other’s presence, and instant message others in your 
organization directly in OWA, even if you do not have Lync 2010 installed on the system that you are 
using.
This means that if you are traveling and have access to a trusted system, you can instant message 
others from your browser. Also, when you log on to OWA, your presence is changed to show that you 
are online. 
You can add an IM contact to OWA, just as you can in Lync 2010. Click Add Contact, and select 
the person to add, just as you would select someone to email. They are added to the list, as shown in 
Figure 12-18.

Figure 12-19 shows where to change your status in Outlook Web App. Simply click your name in 
the upper-right side, and then set your status. It will automatically be updated in everyone’s Lync 
2010 application and other presence-aware applications. 
Figure 12-19 Updating status in OWA.

302   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
If you have the Lync 2010 client installed, Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 also provide presence. 
This is one of those features you might not think much of at first but which can be a real time saver. 
For example, suppose you are crafting an email and it starts to get a bit longer than you thought. You 
can see from the presence on the To line that the person to whom you are writing is “green” (online 
and available). Instead of sending an email, you can just call him by using Lync Online to make a quick 
voice call. He's available to clarify the issue you were writing about, and you are back to work without 
writing a detailed email and waiting for response. (And when was the last time you had a complete 
response to a detailed email?) 
Without the presence indicator, you would not have known he was online and available. Plus, it’s 
only a click away to be “dialing,” which helps make it easy to choose to call when you can. You’re bet-
ter informed, faster, and you didn’t have to do much to make it all happen, courtesy of Office 365.
Microsoft Office
Presence is also available in Microsoft Office applications. Shown in Figure 12-20 is the Authors sec-
tion, as it appears when you click the Home tab in Microsoft Word.
Figure 12-20 Presence in Microsoft Word.
In practice, I have found the presence indicators in Microsoft Office applications other than Out-
look to be useful but not highly reliable. However, you can hover over the user’s name, as shown in 
Figure 12-20, which opens the contact card fly-out. The contact card presence represents the same 
status as Lync 2010, so it tends to be more accurate. 
As of this writing, in Office 365 for professionals and small businesses, SharePoint Online does not 
show presence by default because Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is required for presence to be deter-
mined. If you add the SharePoint Online URL (discussed in Chapter 11, “Working with SharePoint 
Online”) to Trusted Sites in your browser, presence will be shown.

Caution For security reasons, adding the SharePoint Online URL to Trusted Sites is not rec-
ommended by Microsoft. Microsoft has stated it is looking at providing SSL at for Plan P1 
in a future release. See the online help for Office 365 for Small Business and Professionals 
(http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-online-small-business-help/step-1-plan-sites-
and-manage-users-HA102029292.aspx) for details.
Microsoft Lync Mobile 2010
As discussed in Chapter 9, “Working with Mobile Devices,” Microsoft has Lync Mobile 2010 clients for 
iPhones, iPads, Microsoft Phones, Nokia, and Android. If your phone is not listed, check the apps store 
for your device, because the list of supported devices is subject to change. Presence and instant mes-
saging are provided in Lync Mobile 2010. Go to http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/what-is-lync/Pages/
what-is-lync.aspx, and then click the Mobile Apps tab. 
IM	
	
IM in Lync 2010 is very much like it is in other IM applications; you just start the conversation, and if 
the other person is available, she will respond (hopefully). 
Start and Accept an IM Session
Start an IM session by double-clicking the person’s entry in Lync 2010 and typing your message. At 
the receiving end, the user receives a prompt that is accompanied by an audio alert. The message 
appears along with a couple of options, as shown in Figure 12-21.
Figure 12-21 Karen initiates an instant message.
In this example, Andy can click the green bubble to open the chat window (which opens automati-
cally if he takes no action). Andy can also click Redirect, which presents the options Respond With 
Lync Call or Set To Do Not Disturb, as shown in Figure 12-22.

Andy can also just ignore the request, of course.
When the chat window is open, Karen and Andy are conversing, as you would expect in a typical 
IM application. 
Note that you can change fonts, font color, and display emoticons by using the A and happy-face 
icons. Also, don’t forget that you can send complex URLs in instant messaging, as shown in Figure 12-23.
Figure 12-23 Sending URLs in a chat.
Add Others to Your Chat
You can easily add other people to your chat session. You can click the group icon adjacent to the 
paper clip shown in Figure 12-23, but that’s the hard way. All you need to do is drag the person’s 
entry into the chat window, and she will automatically be added. 
When you add more than one person, the chat window changes to a group chat, as shown in 
Figure 12-24.

the group conversation. 
Conversation History
Some IM conversations hold important details about costs, contacts, phone numbers, email 
addresses, URLs, and other specific information that might be needed after the conversation is over. 
One of the disadvantages of a traditional IM session is that it is like a phone call. After the call is 
over, information in the call is no longer available, unless you took good notes. Lync Online solves 
this problem by keeping a transcript of all IM sessions. After a session has been idle for a while 
or is closed, a transcript of it is placed in the Conversation History folder of Outlook, as shown in 
Figure 12-25.

306   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-25 Conversation history is kept in Outlook.
The same content is also available in OWA. 
Note that you can elect to disable this feature in the Lync 2010 Options menu, under the Personal 
settings.
File Transfer
When you are discussing specific content and one of you would benefit from having the file under 
discussion, you can transfer the file by using the paper clip icon located in the upper-right corner of 
the page, as shown in Figure 12-24. Just click the paper clip, and browse to the file. When the file is 
sent, the receiver will be prompted, as shown in Figure 12-26. 
When received, the location of the file displays, along with the suggestion that you scan the file 
with an antivirus program. In other words, Lync Online does not inspect transferred files for viruses. 
Even so, certain kinds of files cannot be transferred. You can find a list of blocked file extensions in the 
Office 365 Security and Service Continuity Service Description at http://www.microsoft.com/download/
en/details.aspx?id=13602.
Microsoft does not specify a maximum size for a transferable file, and a recent query to a technical 
source at Microsoft indicated there is no set limit. 
To customize the location of the file drop for transferred files, click Options | File Saving, and then 
click the Browse button adjacent to the File Transfer path.

	
Voice Calls    307
Figure 12-26 Receiving a file during an IM session.
Voice Calls
One of the most popular features of Lync Online is the ability to make VoIP phone calls to others by 
using Lync Online. You can place calls to Lync Online users inside and outside of your organization. 
Lync Online works with a wide variety of hardware. Almost any headset that is suitable for VoIP or 
gaming will work. Even so, Microsoft publishes a list of approved devices at http://technet.microsoft.
com/en-us/lync/gg278164.aspx. If you refer to this list, remember that it is for Lync 2010 Server, which 
supports phone systems as well as the kinds of calls possible with Plan P1. Focus on the USB headsets 
rather than the phones.
After you set up your audio and microphone as covered under “Configure Audio and Video,” you 
are ready to make and receive calls.
Start and Accept a Lync Online Call
Calling is simple. Just click the phone icon on the contact card or entry in Lync 2010. The receiving 
party is notified via a ringtone and a prompt, as shown is Figure 12-27.
Figure 12-27 An incoming call.

308   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When connected, Lync 2010 shows you the ongoing call status and provides choices you can use 
during the call, as shown in Figure 12-28. Also, note that the status of the participants is automatically 
changed to busy and shows In A Call.
Figure 12-28 Options available during a Lync 2010 call.
You can click the appropriate icons on the bottom (from left to right) to do the following:
■
■
Mute or unmute your microphone. 
■
■
Adjust the speaker volume.
■
■
Present a dialing pad for issuing touch-tone sounds.
■
■
Display the duration of the call.
■
■
Monitor the network quality.
■
■
Place the call on hold.
Also, you’ll see that using the top menu items, you can instant message during a call, start video, 
or share an application or your desktop with others.
Add Others to Your Call
Adding people to your call works the same way as adding people to an IM session. Just drag the user 
to the call. If the user is not listed, you can add him by clicking the people icon next to the paper clip, 
as shown in Figure 12-29.
Figure 12-29 Inviting participants who are not in the contact list to a call.

	
Share    309
As mentioned earlier, this capability is not avaible in all countries.
Share
One of the most powerful features of Lync 2010 and Lync Online is the ability to share content with 
others. In short, Lync Online can act like a virtual digital projector so that all participants in the meet-
ing can view the same content. You can even give control of the shared content to others.
 Share an Application
When you click the Share menu option (shown in Figure 12-30), you can select to share your desktop, 
a specific program, or other options. You'll see how to do this in the section “Real-Time Annotation 
and Demonstrations,” later in this chapter.
Figure 12-30 The Share menu.
In the example, Karen asks Andy to share a document. Andy can, of course, direct her to a Share-
Point Online link, transfer the file by using Lync 2010, or email her an attachment. Andy knows that 
simply sharing the same document creates a better shared experience and ensures that no confusion 
arises about which section of a document you are referencing. 
In my experience with conducting online meetings, for which everyone has their own copy of a 
document, people tend to look through the document at different paces and explore whatever areas 
interest them. The group focus on the topic under discussion is frequently lost, and it is necessary to 
continuously call out page numbers and headings to keep the group together. Also, the document is 
difficult to navigate unless it is well-structured with clear landmarks. All of this is avoided by simply 
sharing the same document at the same time.

310   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
To share the Word document, Andy opens the document in Word, and then clicks Share | Program. 
A window similar to the one shown in Figure 12-31 appears. After selecting the Word document, he 
clicks Share.
Figure 12-31 Selecting the program to share.
The Presenter’s View of a Shared Application
Immediately after he clicks Share, Andy’s desktop changes, now looking similar to Figure 12-32.
The shared application is clearly designated by the Now Sharing frame around it. Any activity 
that happens in other applications is not visible to others. For example, in Figure 12-32, the section 
of the Lync 2010 chat window that overlaps the shared windows is not shown as part of the shared 
application.
At the top of the screen is a status bar that indicates you are currently sharing content. From this 
bar, you can also give control to other attendees or stop sharing the application. 

	
Share    311

The Participant’s View of a Shared Application
When Andy clicks Share, Karen receives a prompt to accept the sharing request, as shown in 
Figure 12-33.
Figure 12-33 The Accept Sharing Request prompt.
Karen’s screen now changes to show the shared application (called the stage) and the IM session, 
as shown in Figure 12-34. 

312   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Figure 12-34 A shared application in Lync Online: the participant's view.
The shared document seems small compared to the rest of the window. This size might be fine 
for a slide or graphic image, but not for a document, Karen can click the icons on the bottom right 
to improve her viewing experience. Using these controls, she can switch to actual size and full screen 
views.
Request and Grant Control
If Karen wants to “drive,” she can click the Request Control button in the upper-right corner of the 
page. Figure 12-35 shows the same screen as Figure 12-34, with the document in Actual Size mode, as 
Karen clicks Request Control.

	
Share    313
Figure 12-35 Requesting control.
On the presenter side, at the top of the screen, Andy is alerted that Karen has asked for control, as 
shown in Figure 12-36.
Figure 12-36 You can accept or decline a request for control.
Andy could also elect to offer control to Karen on his own. Referring to Figure 12-32, Presenter 
View, you can see the Give Control button. Using this option, Karen would receive an invitation to 
take control and, if she accepts, can manage the shared document remotely.
Designated Driver
Keep in mind that all participants with control have control at the same time. It is important to be 
clear about who’s responsible for controlling the view. It can be quite confusing when two or more 
people are managing the shared source at the same time. In practice, you should agree on who is 
driving. You can hand off control by asking for or passing this role. “Karen, you drive,” or “Let me 
drive for this part,” are often heard in situations like this.

314   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Share a Desktop
Just as you can share an application, you can share your entire desktop. Alternatively, someone you 
are chatting with can share their desktop. 
Sharing a desktop has some extremely useful applications: 
■
■
Demonstrations  There’s nothing like a demo to drive a point home. Sharing your desktop is 
the best way to demonstrate multistep processes that involve multiple applications. 
■
■
PowerPoint Presentations  Of course, you can just share PowerPoint, but during a presen-
tation you might be asked about a resource or topic that is outside of the deck. If you have 
shared your desktop instead of just the application, you can simply minimize PowerPoint, 
browse to the requested information, and then return to PowerPoint. If you have shared only 
PowerPoint, you need to share any other application you use during the meeting, as well.
■
■
Troubleshooting  This works in two directions. If you are troubleshooting someone else’s 
technical issues, there is no substitute for having the user let you see what’s going on. He 
can give you control, as well, so you can check settings and attempt fixes without having to 
explain each step, click by click. In the right situations, this feature, in and of itself, pays for 
the subscription costs of Office 365. On the other hand, if someone is troubleshooting your 
desktop and you can offer to share it, you can dramatically decrease the time it takes to solve 
the problem.
Invite Others to Online Meetings
Meetings come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, including planned, unplanned, public, and pri-
vate. The specifics on how to invite others to a meeting depend on when the meeting occurs and on 
whom you want to invite.
Meet Now 
As you have seen, a meeting can start between two people and simply escalate as others are added 
to the call or IM session. When you know you want to create a meeting workspace for multiple parties 
right now, you can use the Meet Now option in Lync 2010.
First, you have to locate the Lync 2010 menu, which is not shown by default. In Figure 12-37, notice 
the cursor arrow located on the downward-facing triangle next to but not on the Options menu icon. 
Click that triangle to show the well-hidden Lync 2010 menu. 

	
Invite Others to Online Meetings    315
Figure 12-37 The Lync 2010 menu can be hard to find.
Note  Select the Show Menu Bar option to display the menu items at the top of Lync 2010. 
This setting is persistent. The menu will show the next time you launch Lync 2010.
When you choose Meet Now, you are prompted to provide information about how you want users 
to connect to the meeting for audio, as shown in Figure 12-38. You can have users dial a designated 
phone number (when using a conferencing service), use Lync audio, or just use IM. 
Figure 12-38 Meeting Audio choice for an online meeting.
Lync Online can integrate with specific audio conference providers as provided in the Office 365 
administration portal. This is discussed in the “Lync Online Administration” section at the end of this 
chapter. 
As soon as you click OK or Cancel, you are placed into the Group Conversation page, as shown in 
Figure 12-39.

Figure 12-39 Inviting others to a meeting.
To invite others, you can drag users into the attendee list, click Invite By Name Or Phone Number, 
or click Invite By Email.
Also, notice the Join Information And Meeting Options link at the top of the client. Clicking that 
link reveals some very useful information, as shown in Figure 12-40.
Figure 12-40 The Meeting Link for your meeting.
The meeting link is the unique address for your meeting. Anyone with this link can click to join the 
meeting, but they might or might not be admitted, depending on how you have configured Meeting 
Options (Figure 12-41).

	
Invite Others to Online Meetings    317
Figure 12-41 Online meeting options.
The default meeting options allow everyone with a link to join the meeting without first holding 
them in the “lobby” for approval. Also, everyone who joins is a presenter. These settings work fine for 
ad hoc meetings, created on demand, but if you were going to host a meeting for people outside of 
your company—such as a webinar—you would want to modify the settings to suit the occasion.
Schedule an Online Meeting with Outlook
When you install the Lync 2010 client and the Office 365 connector, Outlook is configured with a 
button that automatically inserts the meeting URL into a meeting request. Just click the Net Online 
Meeting button to open a new meeting request, which contains a link to the online meeting (see 
Figure 12-42).
Figure 12-42 New Online Meeting button in Outlook 2010.

318   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Clicking the button opens a meeting invitation window, as shown in Figure 12-43. 
Figure 12-43 Online meeting request with Lync Online meeting information.
On the To line, invite anyone you want to participate in the meeting. You can add internal or exter-
nal addresses. For example, if you want to invite a group outside your company for an online demon-
stration or training, you can use this method to send them a Lync Online Meeting request. 
Those who accept the meeting request have all the information they need to join the meeting. This 
actually works very well in practice. As the meeting time arrives, Outlook notifies the attendees of the 
upcoming meeting. They click to open the meeting request and can then click Join Online Meeting in 
that request to connect to the meeting.
As the organizer, you can customize the settings of the meeting by using the Meeting Options 
button in Outlook shown in Figure 12-40, located next to the Lync Join Online Meeting icon shown 
in Figure 12-43. This opens an Online Meeting Options form (see Figure 12-44) that is similar to the 
Online Meeting Options menu in Lync 2010 shown in Figure 12-41. 

	
Join Meetings    319
Figure 12-44 The Online Meeting Options from within Outlook.
You can use the options menu to determine who is directly admitted to the meeting without wait-
ing in the lobby and who will be a presenter. A key difference in this menu relates to the Presenters 
section. People From My Company is the selected default option rather than Everyone.
Join Meetings
Lync Online meetings can be attended by those inside or outside your organization. So how do 
people join a meeting if they do not have Lync Online? Two choices are available. 
The Lync 2010 Attendee Client
The Lync 2010 Attendee client can be installed in place of Lync 2010. It provides a great online experi-
ence for Lync Online meetings. This is by far the preferred way for users to connect to your meeting 
if they do not have Lync 2010, but it needs to be installed before they can join. By the way, do not 
confuse the Lync 2010 Attendee with the Lync 2010 Call Attendant, which is a completely different 
product for a different scenario (integration with the on-premises Lync 2010 Server).
If you are holding online meetings that include people outside of your organization, include a link 
to the Attendee client (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15755) in your meeting 
request, and advise them to install it if possible.

320   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
When the user clicks the meeting request link, the Attendee client will automatically open. Using 
the Attendee client, the user has a better visual experience with the stage and can participate in video 
and VoIP communications.
The Lync Web App
Many users do not want to install client-side software to connect to a meeting. If Lync 2010 or the 
Lync 2010 Attendee client is not installed, users are automatically connected to the Lync Web App. 
The Lync Web App is a browser-based application with which users can connect to Lync Online meet-
ings. Microsoft Silverlight 4.0 is required. If not present, the user is prompted to install Silverlight 
4.0. The Lync Web App provides a very good experience for meetings visually, but does not support 
voice or video. This means that you must provide a way for users of the Lync Web App to hear the 
presentation.
The End-User Experience
When a user clicks the meeting request, Lync 2010 or the Lync Attendee client will open, if installed. If 
not, the user sees the webpage shown in Figure 12-45.
Figure 12-45 Alternatives for joining a meeting.

	
Meeting Setup and Preparation    321
Note that users can click the Supported Browser button if they are concerned about their brows-
ers not working for the meeting. In this example, Silverlight is not installed, so the link for installing it 
is presented. Most users will access the meeting without installing the Lync Attendee, unless they are 
directed to do so. The Lync Attendee client link is provided under View Alternative For Joining The 
Meeting but is not expanded by default.
Note  Silverlight is a technology created by Microsoft and is similar to Adobe Flash. Many 
sites, including Netflix, make use of Silverlight to provide a rich graphic experience over the 
web. Silverlight installs quickly, directly in the browser, and does not require a reboot.
In short, when the user clicks the meeting request, he will automatically connect using the best 
method available: Lync 2010, the Lync 2010 Attendee, or the web browser, in that order.
Meeting Setup and Preparation
You can use Lync Online to conduct an online meeting for up to 50 people. In your meeting invita-
tions, be sure you have included audio dial-in instructions, if available, and links to the Lync 2010 
Attendee client or supported browsers. Test the links you include to ensure that they work and are 
current.
If there are other presenters, conduct a trial meeting to ensure that voice and other issues are 
resolved. For example, shared content needs to be uploaded to the stage before the meeting, and 
make a plan for who will control the stage and in what order.
At any time, you can click the meeting URL to display the meeting stage. The stage is on the right, 
as shown in Figure 12-46. This area is visible to all users when application sharing is not in use.
Figure 12-46 An empty Lync 2010 meeting stage.

322   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Meeting Configuration
Take a moment to ensure that the Online Meeting Options (see Figure 12-40) are set up as you 
require. If everyone joins as a presenter, for example, that’s likely to cause a problem during a large 
meeting. Also, be sure the setting for annotations is correct. Those who can annotate can write mes-
sages on the stage during the presentation (more on this topic in “Real-Time Annotation and Demon-
strations,” later in this chapter). Typically, this should be set to Presenters Only.
Upload a PowerPoint Deck
Frequently, PowerPoint decks are used as the core of a presentation. To add a deck, click the Share 
menu option, and then select PowerPoint Presentation. Browse to the deck, and then click Open. 
The deck will be opened and prepared for presentation. The first slide is displayed. You will want to 
manage the display of the slides during the presentation, using the thumbnails of each deck. To show 
the thumbnails, click the Show Thumbnails icon on the lower-right corner of the stage, as shown in 
Figure 12-47.
Figure 12-47 The Show Thumbnails icon.
You can add multiple decks to the presentation and switch between them by using the pull-down 
under You Are Sharing at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 12-48.

	
Meeting Setup and Preparation    323
Figure 12-48 Switching decks. 
Navigate the Deck
During the presentation, with thumbnail view enabled, you just click the slide that you want to show. 
As shown in Figure 12-49, you can easily go back and forth between slides during the presentation.
Figure 12-49 Thumbnail view makes it easy to change slides quickly.
Animated slides should render properly, but they have been known to act differently when dis-
played in the presentation. For slides that require click events, click the slide in the stage area when 
you are ready to start animations. It’s a good idea to test animations before the presentation so that 
you know what to expect.

324   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Polls
You can add simple polls to your Lync Online presentation. To do so, choose Share, and then click Poll. 
The Create A Poll form open, as shown in Figure 12-50. The poll is added to the content that you can 
share.
Figure 12-50 Creating a poll.
When you are ready to take the poll, just select it from the You Are Sharing pull-down (Figure 
12-47). Use the choices at the bottom of the stage to open, close, show results, hide results, edit, clear, 
and save the poll, as shown from left to right in Figure 12-51.
Figure 12-51 Managing the poll during the meeting.
Manage the Meeting
When the time comes for your meeting, people will start to join. 

	
Manage the Meeting    325
Admit People from the Lobby
If you are using the meeting lobby, you need to approve users before they can be admitted, as shown 
in Figure 12-52. With multiple people in the lobby, you can select Admit All.
Figure 12-52 Admitting people from the lobby.
Be mindful of people showing up late to the meeting, because they must be admitted while you 
are presenting. 
Mute Audio
Be alert to audio issues, such as broadcasting chatter to everyone in the group, or having an open 
mike in the audience, which is heard by all. Some very embarrassing and annoying situations can 
occur when personal or inappropriate commentary is sent to the entire meeting without the person 
knowing that there is an open microphone.
When using the Lync Online Voice feature, you can mute the entire audience by using the Mute 
Audience feature, as shown in Figure 12-53.
Figure 12-53 The Mute Audience option.
Keep in mind that if you are using a conference call service that is completely independent of Lync 
Online, clicking Mute Audience has no effect on the audio.
Also, notice the other options on the menu that can be very handy during a meeting. Make 
Everyone An Attendee is the solution if everyone attending the meeting is a presenter and you didn’t 
intend for that to be the case. If this occurs, first select Make Everyone An Attendee. Next, in the 

326   
Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
participant list, select the individuals who should be presenters. (Right-click the entry for each, and 
then select Make Presenter.) 
You can also select individuals in the participant list and mute their microphones. Conversely, if 
everyone but the presenter is muted and you want to grant someone the opportunity to speak, you 
can unmute her while she asks a question or makes a point.
Use Video
During the meeting, you can transmit video to your audience. Video can be very useful when you 
want to provide personal presence or when you want to show the audience an object not well repre-
sented by a picture.
With more than one presenter, Lync Online automatically switches to the speaker. Not only is this a 
lot of fun, but it provides interactive and interesting content during a presentation. 
To start broadcasting, just click the Video button in Lync 2010. 
Real-Time Annotation and Demonstrations
During the meeting, you can use the tools located at the bottom of the stage to interact with the 
stage without modifying the original content. You’ve probably seen something similar to this on 
sports broadcasts where the announcers draw lines on a frozen frame to call out a certain player or 
action. You can do the same with your presentations by using the annotation tools. You can add com-
ments, circle key points, underline, and otherwise interact with the audience as you talk.
A common use of this feature is to place a note on the opening slide if the starting time is delayed. 
A slide that says “The meeting will begin at 10:05,” easily informs all participants.
Annotation Tools
Each of the tools shown in Figure 12-54 has a unique function. 
Figure 12-54 Annotation tools for use during the presentation.
The most commonly used is the laser point tool (selected in Figure 12-54). When selected, click-
ing the slide causes a point to appear momentarily on the shared screen at the location where you 
clicked. You can drag the point around (click and hold down the mouse button) as if you were using 
an actual laser pointer.
You can use the text box tool (second from left) to type on the shared screen.
The blue arrow is the stamp tool that stamps an arrow where you click. Click the down-facing 
triangle next to the stamp tool (or any other tool with that option) to reveal other choices. 

	
Manage the Meeting    327
In the meeting options, note that you can limit the use of these tools to presenters only or allow 
everyone to annotate.
The White Board
Another useful real-time annotation feature is the whiteboard. You insert a whiteboard just like a poll. 
Choose Share | White Board to display a white space on the stage and enable the annotation tools for 
everyone in the meeting. The whiteboard is a great brainstorming tool for small group use. You can 
save the whiteboard by using the save icon (shown in Figure 12-54) for later reference.
Present Demos
Many presentations are accompanied by demonstrations. You can easily switch to showing a live 
demonstration during a presentation by using application sharing, as previously discussed. Just select 
the Share menu option, and then share your desktop or the program you want to show. The stage 
switches from the slide show to the demonstration. During the demonstration, keep in mind that you 
do not want to constantly change your screen because it can take a moment or two for the displayed 
version of your demo to reach all attendees. For example, if you open a Word document and are 
constantly moving up and down in the document as you speak, there might not be enough time for 
the display to catch up with rapid updates. 
Develop the habit of showing a screen and letting it settle for few seconds before moving on. This 
helps to ensure that everyone’s display is fully in sync with your presentation. 
When your demo is finished, close the application or click Stop Sharing at the top of the screen 
(see Figure 12-32). If you want to return to the slide show during the presentation without closing 
your demo, just switch to the Lync meeting window, and then under You Are Sharing, select the con-
tent to share from the stage drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 12-55.

Lync Online Administration
The Office 365 Admin portal contains a few settings that you can manage related to Lync Online. In 
general, the default settings work well for most small businesses. You can modify the features of Lync 
Online service-wide and on a per-user basis, as well as manage additional capabilities such as add-
ing a teleconferencing provider to your service. First, log on to the portal, using your administrator 
credentials. Click the Admin menu at the top of the page, and then under Lync Online, click General 
Settings. You will see the Overview page, as shown in Figure 12-56.
Figure 12-56 The Overview page of the Lync Online Control Panel.
The Lync Online Control Panel overview page shows the status of the settings available in Lync 
Online. Take a look at each of your options.
Users 
When you click Users at the top of the page, you’ll see a list of your users. Select one or more users 
from the list, and then click Edit User to show the Edit User Settings page, as shown in Figure 12-57.

	
Lync Online Administration    329
Figure 12-57 The Edit User Settings page.
Use the settings under IM, Audio/Video, and Conferencing to enable or disable each feature on 
a per-user basis. They are all enabled by default. Note that the ability to communicate with users of 
Windows Live Messenger is dependent on enabling the External Communications feature for the 
service, which is disabled by default. This is discussed in the next section, “Enable or Disable External 
Communications.”
A significant feature that appears here is the ability to add dial-in conferencing service providers 
to Lync Online. You would use a dial-in conference provider to add traditional phone line conference 
call capabilities to your Lync Online meeting requests. This capability is not provided by Microsoft and 
comes with additional fees through service contracts with specific service providers. As of this writing, 
the companies providing this service are as follows:
■
■
PGI: http://www.pgi.com/us/en/conferencing/web-meetings/ms-lync-audio.php
■
■
British Telecom: http://www.btconferencing.com/unified-communications/audio-for-microsoft- 
lync-online/
■
■
InterCall: http://www.intercall.com/services/web-conferencing/lync-online.php
When provisioned, conference call information is included in the Lync Online meeting request. This 
allows users of Lync Web App to participate in the audio portion of a meeting. You can find online help 
for configuring dial-in conferencing at http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-smallbusinesses/
gg591295.aspx.

Working with Microsoft Office 365: Running Your Small Business in the Cloud
Enable or Disable External Communications
The External Communications page shown in Figure 12-58 determines whether your users can con-
nect to those outside of your organization by using the Lync 2010 client.
Figure 12-58 External communications settings in Lync Online.
When this feature is enabled (the default), you can communicate with users outside of your orga-
nization who use Lync Online or Lync Server 2010, presuming they allow connections from outside 
users, as well. In addition, you can instant message users of Windows Live Messenger. 
You can use the Presence And Notifications page (Figure 12-59) to control presence privacy mode 
and mobile phone notifications. When you click the Edit button next to Presence Privacy Mode, you 
are presented with two options, as shown in Figure 12-60.
As you know, by default, Lync Online is set to allow you to communicate with other Lync Online 
users outside of your organization. Conversely, they can also contact you. The first step in this process 
is type your email address in the Lync 2010 client. Lync 2010 then shows your contact card to the 
other users so that they can see your status information before they initiate a conversation with you. 
Some people consider this to be too much information to expose to people whom you don't know or 
didn't authorize. If you enable Display Presence Information Only To User’s Contacts, Lync 2010 shows 
presence only to users who are in your contact list.

ting in Lync 2010. See http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-smallbusinesses/hh831847.aspx 
for more information.

The next setting on the Presence And Notifications page is Mobile Phone Notifications, which con-
trols the behavior of Lync Online with Windows Phones or Apple devices. A “push” occurs when Lync 
Online initiates an update to your mobile device because of an event that occurs online. If the Lync 
2010 Mobile client is not active and someone instant messages you, a push event might be required. 
By default, these settings are enabled.
For More Information
“Working with Lync Online” is a fitting final chapter. It’s the service that most people think will have 
the least impact, but as you can tell, I’m a fan and believe it delivers quite a bit more value than 
people expect. This is based on my personal experience using Lync Online in my own business as well 
as those of businesses I work with. 
Before ending, it should be restated that Office 365 is a continuously updated service. By far, the 
most valuable resource for information about Office 365 is http://community.office365.com. There, 
you can find blogs, wikis, forums, news, and other important details about the services. Often, infor-
mation appears there before it is formalized into help files or white papers. 
On the site, you’ll find a wiki where Microsoft posts its most recent updates to the service at http://
community.office365.com/en-us/w/office_365_service_updates/default.aspx. In addition, there is a forum 
focused on Plan P1 such as plan administration at http://community.office365.com/en-us/f/146.aspx. 
Finally, Appendix A of this book provides a deployment checklist that you might find helpful.
