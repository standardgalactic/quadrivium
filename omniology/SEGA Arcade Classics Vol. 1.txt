Introduction
When I was five years old, I received a Sega Master System from a
relative, and I became a fan for life. In first grade composition class, I
wrote an eight page story on the further adventures of Alex Kidd. Every
assignment I wrote was tied to Sega in some way – there were stories
about Penguin Land and Wonder Boy, and I somehow even connected
Double Dragon to St. Patrick’s Day.
 
In the twenty five-odd years since my days at elementary school,
my obsession hasn’t really died down all that much, as this volume can
attest to. But it’s not due only to mere nostalgia – look over Sega’s
arcade output during the 1980s and 1990s and you’ll find that it reads
like a “best of“ compilation from the era. Many of the games are most
definitely artifacts of the time, with themes based off popular movies
like Aliens, Top Gun, and Conan the Barbarian, yet that in no way
lessens their impact, or even their quality.
 
This volume seeks to explore what makes these games so
fascinating. Games like Space Harrier, After Burner, and OutRun
pushed the boundaries of technology with Sega’s “super scaler“
technology. Shinobi and Golden Axe took ideas from other popular
games – Namco’s Rolling Thunder and Technos’ Double Dragon,
respectively – and refined them into substantially better games.
Fantasy Zone featured some of the most colorful, imaginative
graphics of the time, while Altered Beast, the polar opposite on the
“cute“ spectrum, begged console gamers to upgrade to Sega’s 16-bit
Genesis system.
 
The criteria for the games selected in this volume revolved mostly
around how prolific the games were, based on how many sequels or
ports they received. All of their offshoots are also covered in great
detail, including obscure mobile releases and fan games. All of these
were born in the arcades, with the exception of Alex Kidd, which
began on the Master System (though his arcade game was released
shortly afterward). Obviously, this book only scratches the surface of
Sega’s games. There are many fantastic titles from the company that
will be covered in future volumes, including its earlier arcade games, its
lesser known titles and, of course, its home consoles.
 
At any rate, thank you for purchasing this volume, and please look
forward to more volumes from Hardcore Gaming 101 in the future!

Released by Sega into the arcades
in 1985, and designed by the
legendary Yu Suzuki, Space Harrier
is a shoot-em-up that ditched the
horizontal or vertical views of most
games at the time, and put the
viewpoint right behind the player.
Featuring a flight stick to emulate
piloting a jet fighter, players
take control of the “Harrier“, a
blond guy wearing a red shirt and
blue pants.
Through means left entirely
unexplained, the Harrier can fly
over the landscape at incredible
speed. Armed only with a huge
cannon, he rushes forward,
destroying the bizarre, dangerous
creatures of Dragon Land.  It
wasn’t the first game to use this
technology – Space Harrier is
predated by Sega’s own 1982 3D
shooter Buck Rogers: Planet of
Zoom – but it’s a huge
technological improvement, and
manages to look extremely
impressive even today.
The action is remarkably
simple: just fly, dodge, and shoot
back. Even though there’s no
targeting crosshair, aiming is
remarkably easy, as you only need
to shoot in the general vicinity of a
foe to hit them. Bad guys also
shoot directly at the Harrier, so as
long as you keep moving and don’t
backtrack over your previous
position, you won’t get hit. All the
while, you’ll be maneuvering the
Harrier between stone columns,
stationary poles, and various kinds
of plants. While you’ll usually only
trip over bushes and rocks,
smacking into a tree spells certain
death (the original arcade release
also has a glitch where you’ll
shoot right through bushes, though
most later ports fix this).
The trippy backgrounds are a
trademark of Space Harrier. The
ground consists of a flat
checkerboard which changes color
every stage. The sky switches
between from bright blue to the
yellow of dusk, to the pink
atmosphere of some otherworldly
planet. Across the horizons are
alien buildings and landscapes
which fall and rise after the
completion of each stage. A few
levels even feature a ceiling, giving
a hallucinatory feeling of
claustrophobia. There are 18
stages total.
Creatures of the Land
The enemies in Dragon Land are
extremely creative and distinctive.
The Harrier fights one-eyed
mammoths, bulbous yellow squids,
stone heads, and orbs that
resemble cybernetic peanuts.
Amidst all of the bizarre enemies
are more standard types, like jets
and flying mecha (which are
basically the Doms from Mobile
Suit Gundam), although even these
designs are still incredibly cool
looking. But the most impressive
foes are the dragons, usually
taking the role of the level boss.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Each of these consists of a head
and several segments which, in
motion, gives the appearance of
long, floating Chinese dragons.
Their visage is reminiscent of
Falkor the Luck Dragon from the
movie The Neverending Story.
Keeping control over the
Harrier, all while dodging and firing
amidst the wild colors, is the kind
of glorious chaos that is
representative of the best in
1980s arcade gaming. The stages
have strange names like Moot,
Geeza, Minia, Parm and Absymbel,
that help create a distinctive and
thoroughly memorable game
world. There are also a few bonus
stages, where the Harrier hops on
the back of a white dragon named
Uriah. Although he’s hard to
control, Uriah is invincible, and the
goal is simply to smash as much
of the landscape as possible.
Space Harrier’s theme song is
incredible, composed by famed
Sega musician Hiroshi Kawaguchi,
and easily ranks as one of the
most memorable in gaming. It only
fades out during boss fights or
special stages, but it’s long
enough that it never gets tiring.
There’s also the encouraging voice
over, which yells “Welcome to the
Fantasy Zone! Get Ready!“ or
proclaims “You’re doing great!“
after the end of each level. Even
after dying, as your Harrier
screams in agony and falls to the
ground, a friendly message pops
up that says “Many more battle
scenes will soon be available!“ as
he picks himself off the ground
and returns to battle.
Given its popularity, it’s
natural that Space Harrier would
be ported to every possible
platform. Unfortunately, given the
advanced hardware of Sega’s
bespoke Space Harrier arcade
board, there was no home system
at the time that could pull off the
scaling effects necessary to
replicate the sense of speed found
in the original. Not only that, but
the analog control needed to be
ditched in favor of digital, which
greatly alters the gameplay.
 
The first console port was to
Sega’s own Master System. The
pace had to be stifled quite a bit
for the 8-bit machine to keep up,
and the scrolling is much choppier.
Still, the huge enemies manage to
impress. For the most part, the
enemies and levels are comparable
to the arcade version. Sega added
an additional final boss named
Haya-Oh (named after Hayao
Nakayama, the then-president of
Sega) and a real ending – which is
much better than the arcade
version, which simply showed up
a huge “The End“ sign. Also
hidden in the game is the ability to
play as a jet fighter and a secret
message that urged players to
write to Sega giving their opinions.
 
The Game Gear port is based
on the Master System release.
Due to the smaller screen size
some of the proportions had to be
changed, so the Harrier is much
bigger. The enemy sprites have
been altered to appear more
organic, which at least makes this
version unique. Some of the level
names have been changed as well,
and there are only 12 levels in
total. A password function also
allows players to skip to later
levels. Despite running on the
same hardware as the Sega
Master System, the music has
been rearranged.
 
Takara ported Space Harrier
to the Famicom. While the
scrolling is smoother than the SMS
port, the Harrier moves incredibly
slowly, and there’s a whole bunch
of flicker. Not to mention the fact
that all of the sprites are smaller.
They couldn’t even fit any of the
voices in. The enemy arrangement
is based on the Master System
version, so it has the additional
final boss.
NEC Avenue and Dempa
brought Space Harrier to the
TurboGrafx-16. It’s smoother than
the other 8-bit console ports, but
it still doesn’t feel quite right, and
it both looks and sounds ugly. The
checkerboard floor is also gone.
 
Dempa also took care of the
computer ports in Japan. The
versions on the PC-6001 and the
PC-8801 are the worst looking
iterations out there. While the
Harrier is a low-color sprite (as are
the enemies in the latter version),
everything else, including the
clouds, trees and bullets, are just
featureless colored rectangles.
And yet despite how awful it looks
(or perhaps because of this), it
keeps up the speed, and actually
plays more smoothly than most of
the European computer ports.

The Sharp MZ and X1
conversions are slight steps up,
though most everything still looks
like colored blotches. The Fujitsu
FM-7 version looks decent and
plays alright. The X68000 port is
by far the best of these, with
smooth animation and almost
completely faithful gameplay,
though the checkerboard floor has
been removed in favor of scrolling
bars. All of these computer
versions have slightly different but
excellent soundtracks.
 
Elite handled the home
computer ports for Europe and
North America. The version for the
Commodore 64 is too fast and
choppy, though the music is
decent. The European version is
slightly better, being that the floor
has a scrolling effect, whereas it’s
just a solid color in the American
release. The ZX Spectrum version
is sluggish and hideously colored.
The Amstrad version looks nicer,
though while the Harrier is a
detailed sprite, the enemies and
objects are simple wireframes.
 
The IBM PC version looks
alright, but the animation is still
very choppy, and the speed feels
off. The Amiga and Atari ST
versions are the best of these,
with faithful graphics and good
animation which isn’t quite as
smooth as the arcade version, but
far more playable than its
brethren. However, due to the
size, it had to be split into two
separate games – Space Harrier
and Space Harrier: Return to the
Fantasy Zone.
 
It wasn’t until the 32X in
1992 that Space Harrier finally
came home in nearly arcade
perfect form, but it only runs at
30 FPS. The Saturn version was
released five years later as part of
the Sega Ages line, and is very
nearly arcade perfect. It came out
on a single disc in Japan, and was
bundled together with OutRun and
After Burner II for the Western
release. It includes true analog
control to mimic the original
arcade game.
Space Harrier is also playable
in both Shenmue titles for the
Dreamcast and Xbox. It’s missing
some of the customization options
of the other ports, but if you can
beat the game in one credit, you
get a certificate from the arcade
owner in the first Shenmue.
 
The Game Boy Advance
version was featured as part of
the Sega Arcade Gallery
collection, ported by Bits Studio.
Although it looks fine on the
outset, it’s badly programmed,
and just doesn’t feel right.
Space Harrier saw a remake
on the PlayStation 2 under the
Sega Ages 2500 series. The
entire game has been redone with
polygons, but the whole makeover
looks rather cheap, with jaggy
visuals and low resolution
textures. The redesigned look of
the Harrier is lousy, with his silly
goggles and spiky blond hair. The
graphics lose much of the bright
color that made the original so
attractive, but since the objects
here are actual 3D objects instead
of 2D sprites, it gives a better
impression of depth and scale. In
the original game, all of the boss
dragons were made out of
individual segments that scrolled
in unison, giving the illusion of a
flying beast. Here, they actually
look like dragons. There’s no
option for analog control, sadly.
 
The remixed music tracks are
quite good, and the new
announcer spouts more ridiculous
phrases, like “Get busy, Harrier!
Dragon Land is screaming!“
There’s also now a lock-on laser
similar to Panzer Dragoon, along
with a limited-use rapid fire
button. You can also get bombs to
clear the screen, but these make
the boss battles far too easy.
 
The new “Fractal Mode“
turns off the classic checkerboard
pattern and replaces it with a
texture map, which looks pretty
ugly. It also changes certain parts
of the level so you can’t run on
them and need to fly. Additionally,
there are a few extra tunnel
stages, where you zoom through
an enclosed tube. These would
have been cooler had they not
pasted the same low-res textures
on the walls. Both the PS2 and
the Japan-only Sonic Cafe mobile
releases change the robots to look
less like Doms.
 
There is also an almost
arcade-perfect port of Space
Harrier available on the Space
Harrier II Complete Collection for
the PS2. Since the analog stick on
the Dual Shock is much better
than the Saturn controller, this is
the best way to go. The arcade
version is unlockable in Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for the
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but
the scaling effects are dodgy, and
the audio is too high pitched.
In 2011, a hobbyist
programmer named Chris Hutt
ported Space Harrier to the Atari
8-bit computers. It’s a true work
of art, because it’s better than the
official computer ports that came
out in the 1980s, with excellent
visuals, fast action, and smooth
gameplay. It is free to download.
In 2012, Sega announced
3D Space Harrier for the 3DS, a
remake of the arcade version with
widescreen and 3D graphics.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Space Harrier 3D is not merely a
remake of Space Harrier with 3D
effects, rather it’s a new title
created to take advantage of the
Master System’s 3D shutter
glasses. The effect is pretty
remarkable – although nothing flies
out of the screen, it gives the
playing field a sense of depth that
is incredibly cool.
 
The unfortunate tradeoff is
that the scrolling and movement is
even choppier than it was in the
Master System version of the first
game. Since it’s harder to judge
enemy and projectile motion, it’s
also far more difficult than the
original, and not in a good way.
Subtle Difference
Still, it is an interesting experience,
even if the fundamental gameplay
hasn’t changed all that much.
There’s a whole new array of
monsters, including gigantic mechs
and ferocious flying samurai. There
are a few more obstacles to avoid,
like indestructible bouncing balls
and rods that seem small at a
distance but grow to full length as
you approach them. Some of the
color schemes used in the later
levels (especially the dark red and
pitch black) are a far cry from the
pastels of the original, leading to
an atmosphere that feels more
oppressive than fantastical.
The plot is that Uriah, the
good dragon from the first game,
has been kidnapped, and it’s up to
you to save him. This accounts for
why the bonus stages are gone.
The Space Harrier main theme is
back, along with a handful of new
songs. The Japanese version also
supports FM synth.
 
There is an option to turn off
the 3D functionality, although it
requires that you play the game to
get a high score, then enter a code
to enable the selection. Both the
PlayStation 2 port and certain
emulators allow you to turn off the
3D effect from the beginning, in
addition to viewing the game with
the traditional red-blue glasses
used in other media for years.
Although a lot of the visual impact
is lost, it’s the only way to really
get the experience without shelling
out for the actual hardware.

Space Harrier II
Original Release: 1988
Platforms: GEN, C64, AMI, AST,
ZX, WIN, PS2, WII, IOS
Space Harrier II was one of the
first titles for both the Mega Drive
and Sega Genesis when released
in their respective territories. The
game was planned by Kotaro
Hayashida (creator of Alex Kidd)
rather than Yu Suzuki.
Not much has changed from
its predecessor, other than offering
13 new stages, along with a
handful of new enemies. The
coolest of these are a three-headed
turtle, a winged tiger, and the
penultimate foe, the Dark Harrier.
Boss fights are heralded with a
darkened playing field and some
lightning cracks in the distance –
one of the few new special
effects. You can choose your
starting level at the outset,
although you still need to conquer
all of the stages to beat it.
 
The dragon bonus stages are
gone, and are instead replaced
with levels where you ride on top
of a jet. It’s pretty much like a
regular level (except you’re
invincible), which is under-
whelming. The new main theme,
composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo, is
actually pretty catchy, even
though it doesn’t quite hold a
candle to the original. Some of the
sound effects are also a bit odd, as
if the programmers hadn’t quite
mastered the Genesis’ sound chip.
 
Although the 16-bit hardware
was able to replicate other arcade
titles like Altered Beast, the lack of
any scaling meant that it still
wasn’t quite capable of delivering
an arcade-like experience. The
scrolling is definitely smoother
than the 8-bit ports of the first
game, and the horizon view
actually changes as you move up
and down, but it’s still choppy and
ultimately somewhat clumsy.
When it was released, this was
acceptable, but with the numerous
quality ports of its predecessor
now available, Space Harrier II is
really not up to par.
 
Although Space Harrier II was
originally released on the Mega
Drive, it was ported to numerous
computer platforms in Europe. The
quality of these ports is about the
same as the ones developed for
the original game. The Amstrad
version has filled-in sprites but the
speed is slower. The Atari ST and
Amiga ports are very close to the
Mega Drive version. The music
conversions by Matt Furniss are
quite excellent.

Planet Harriers
Original Release: 2000
Platforms: ARC
In 2000 Sega resurrected Space
Harrier with a completely new
arcade game, Planet Harriers. This
update plays much more similarly
to Panzer Dragoon than any of the
old Space Harrier titles.
 
The stages are fully defined,
rather than blank landscapes,
through the scrolling is rather
slow. The jet-equipped main
character can dash and spin
around the screen, all while aiming
a targeting reticule. Weapons
include both a regular shot and a
lock-on laser. You can earn gold to
buy life replenishments, lock-on
fuel (to increase the number of
enemies you can target at once),
barriers, and additional power
bombs. The game was also
distributed in two-player sit-down
cabinets. If playing with another
person the two players can share
energy and increase each other’s
life meter.
Untapped Potential
Due to technical restraints the
original Space Harrier was reduced
to checkerboard patterns. Now
with more powerful hardware,
Planet Harriers expands
extensively on the universe. The
graphic designs mix futuristic sci-fi
landscapes with gorgeous and
luscious environments, including
forested canyons and ice caverns.
The final stage takes place in
hyperspace, against the backdrop
of several colorful galaxies. It’s
never quite as trippy as the old
games, but it’s still classy.
Unfortunately there are only five
stages in total.
 
It also has a rather strange
sense of humor, which manifests
in the playable characters. The
new Harriers include Cory, a nurse
with a gigantic syringe; Nick, a
baseball player; X, a rock star with
a guitar; and Glenn, the “normal“
guy. Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone
is available as a hidden character,
and he also shows up during
gameplay to resurrect players
when continuing. The exaggerated
running animations while on the
ground are also quite comical.
 
It’s all rather weird, but it
keeps some elements from the
older games, seeing as the first-
level boss is a multi-headed
dragon. The final boss is also
incredibly cool, as it’s composed
from a series of cubes that take on
different forms, similar to Seven
Force in Gunstar Heroes. In
addition to shapes like guns and
grenades, it’ll occasionally turn
into the Dreamcast logo.
Planet Harriers runs on Sega’s
Hikaru board, which also ran Cyber
Troopers Virtual On 4 and Star
Wars Racer Arcade. Most of the
music is, unfortunately, largely
forgettable electronica. It’s a
pretty cool game which, alas,
never saw a home release. There
were rumors of Dreamcast and
Gamecube ports, but unfortunately
nothing ever came to fruition.

Typing Space Harrier
Original Release: 2002
Platforms: PC
Following Sega’s masterpiece
Typing of the Dead, itself a spin-
off from House of the Dead,
someone decided it would be cool
to combine Space Harrier with a
typing tutor. So it’s much like
watching someone play a game of
Space Harrier, except when
enemies pop onto the screen, you
need to type some Japanese
words (in Romaji) to shoot them
down. Type too slowly and you’ll
get killed. Quick single letters will
also occasionally pop up.
Space Harrier in Bayonetta
The 2010 Xbox 360 / PlayStation 3 title Bayonetta,
developed by Platinum Games and published by
Sega, is filled with all manner of classic Sega fan
service throughout.
 
During an early cutscene in a car, one of the
songs from OutRun is played on the radio.
 
Chapter 08 has a section on a motorcycle,
which is tangentially similar to Hang-On, and also
plays a song from After Burner.
 
In Chapter 14, Bayonetta and her crew hop onto
a missile, where you then proceed to play a
minigame which is exactly like Space Harrier. In the
cutscene that introduces this segment, Bayonetta
proclaims, “Welcome to my fantasy zone. Get
ready!“, before taking off over the sea. The enemy
sound effects and patterns should be familiar, and
the music is, of course, an arrangement of the
original Space Harrier theme song. One of the boss
creatures you fight in this section is even a long-
bodied dragon.
Space Harrier Hacks
The X68000 version of Space
Harrier was easily hacked by
amateur gamers, resulting in a
number of variations with different
sprites and sound effects.
 
Some of these include
(clockwise from top-left): Rumic
Harrier, with characters from
Rumiko Takahashi manga like
Urusei Yatsura and Ranma 1/2;
Otaku Harrier, where all sprites are
now mecha from famous anime;
Street Harrier, starring Ryu from
the first Street Fighter but also
featuring lots of other Sega icons
(during bonus stages Ryu does a
handstand on the After Burner jet,
and the spinning diamonds are
now tumbling OutRun cars); and
Harrier Desse, which stars a flying
squirrel, steals many enemies from
Dragon Quest, and is otherwise
cartoonishly bizarre.

OutRun is known as one of the
finest arcade racing games ever
made. Created by Yu Suzuki and
Sega-AM2, it utilizes the “super
scaler“ technology seen in Hang-
On, After Burner and Space
Harrier. It runs on a board built
specifically for the game called the
Sega OutRun Hardware, which is
based on the System 16 board.
The blazing fast scaling of the
sprites and slick 3D motion of the
road created an experience far
smoother than most other arcade
titles around at the time.
 
According to Yu Suzuki,
OutRun was inspired by the 1981
movie The Cannonball Run, which
featured a huge race across Europe
in a variety of fancy cars. In
transferring that concept into a
game, Suzuki put you in the seat
of an expensive sports car, which
looks suspiciously like a Ferrari
Testarossa, as you speed through
a variety of exotic locations. The
race begins on the beach, but
spreads to deserts, canyons,
forests and a diverse selection of
other scenic routes.
 
 The game itself is
uncomplicated – there are no laps
around circuits, no sponsors, no
pit stops, no ramming, and no high
speed chases. Just weaving
through turns, dodging cars, and
shifting gears when appropriate. If
you run off the road and hit an
obstacle you may flip over, but
within a few seconds you’re back
on the road completely unharmed.
The whole experience has a very
laid back feeling; just cruising
along, sunglasses on and hot
blonde girlfriend by your side,
relaxing, and looking forward to
whatever new sights the next
stage will bring.
 
At the end of each stage the
road forks in two directions, each
leading to a different area. A single
game from start to finish only
comprises five stages, but with all
of the branching paths, there are a
total of 15 unique tracks. The
map, laid out like a sideways
pyramid, is displayed at the end of
the game and charts your
progress. There are minor
differences between the circuit
layouts of the “Overseas“ and
“Japanese“ versions.
 
The graphics have that fresh,
clean and bright AM2 style, and
the music tracks, supplied by
Hiroshi Kawaguchi, are classics.
There are three different in-game
songs (“Magical Sound Shower“,
“Splash Wave“ and “Passing
Breeze“), selected via a radio at
the start of the game, and each
has a catchy Latin/Caribbean
influenced melody. Each song also
lasts approximately the duration of
the entire game, about six minutes
or so. Even the game over / high
score theme, entitled “Last Wave“,
relaxes you while you stare at the
sunset and listen to the sound of
waves breaking.
OutRun hit the arcades in
1986 in four different cabinets:

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
two upright ones, a standard sit-
down one, and a deluxe sit-down
cabinet, the latter being equipped
with hydraulics that move the seat
to the sides when you turn. These
cabinets are also equipped with
force feedback motors which
shake the steering wheel as you
turn or crash.
System Ports
Since none of the 8- or 16-bit
systems were as powerful as the
arcade hardware, everything had
to be scaled back. Some of the
computer ports shipped with a
soundtrack tape as a bonus.
 
The Master System is of
reasonable quality given the
technical constraints. The scrolling
is relatively good for an 8-bit
system and the music sounds
decent. Many of the roadside
details are missing, though, along
with the horizon backgrounds.
 
Despite running on nearly
identical hardware, the Game Gear
version, ported by SIMS, is
completely different from the
Master System release. The
sprites are smaller (and uglier) to
compensate for the smaller
screen, but some of the missing
details have returned, like the
backgrounds on the horizon and
various other sprites. However,
the roads feel cramped, and it’s
more difficult. There’s also a
versus mode where you can race
against a CPU opponent or link up
to another player with a Game
Gear and copy of the game.
 
For a long time the Genesis
version, ported by Hertz, was the
best port of OutRun. The system
still isn’t powerful enough to
handle scaling, but it definitely
looks much nicer than any
previous version. It also has an
exclusive fourth selectable song
called “Step on Beat“. There’s an
extra ending screen, as well as
cameos from the After Burner and
Galaxy Force ships, if you manage
to meet certain conditions. The PC
Engine version was only released
in Japan, and was ported by NEC
Avenue. It’s not as nice looking as
the Genesis version, but it plays
just fine.
 
US Gold published the ports
for various home computers, and
most were programmed by Probe
Software. The Atari ST and Amiga
ports are essentially identical,
though the Amiga has the edge on
music. The graphics are more
colorful than the 8-bit ports, but
they still look fairly bad, and the
framerate is not very good.
The Commodore 64 version,
ported by Amazing Products, is a
decent conversion, though the
roads are the same color as the
rest of the ground. It can’t handle
the forked paths either, so instead
you pick from one of five courses
before you begin the game. The
music is decent, but “Passing
Breeze“ is missing. The IBM PC
version was ported by Unlimited
Software, and while it’s stuck
with 16 color EGA graphics and
PC speaker sound, it plays well.
 
The Amstrad version is
terrible. Like the Commodore 64
version, the road is the same color
as the rest of the ground, but it’s
so incredibly slow that it’s a
wonder anyone allowed it to be
published. The ZX Spectrum
version is only slightly better, in
that the speed is slightly faster,
though not by much. The MSX
version is practically identical to
the Spectrum port. An MSX2
version, released in Japan and
ported by Pony Canyon, is roughly
on par with the SMS version.
 
The first arcade perfect port
arrived in 1996 on the Saturn as
part of the Sega Ages collection
(which was compiled with two
other games and published by
Working Designs in North America
and Sega in Europe). Ported by
Rutubo Games, it includes a
hidden option to make the game
run at 60 FPS (the arcade original
only ran at 30 FPS). The Japanese
version also has newly arranged
tracks, but these were excised
from the overseas releases.
OutRun also appeared on the
Dreamcast, compiled in the Yu
Suzuki Game Works Vol. 1 disc,
as well as appearing as playable
minigames in both Shenmue titles.
It runs at a higher resolution than
the arcade game, so there is
slightly more detail in the sprites,
though it’s hard to tell. The music
also sounds a little different.
Perhaps there were also legal
concerns at one point, because
the car has been redrawn to look
less like a Testarossa. It is also
missing the niceties of the Saturn
version. A straight emulation of
the arcade game is available in the
Xbox version of OutRun 2.
OutRun is also included in the
Sega Arcade Gallery for the GBA,
developed by Bits Studios. While
most games on this compilation
suffer from shoddy programming,
OutRun turned out pretty well,
with 60 FPS speed like the Saturn
Top: [ARC] The road map, along with some
of the gorgeous views
Bottom left: The deluxe sit-down cabinet
13

version, though the roadside
objects are missing some details.
 
Sega also released the game
as part of their 3D Ages
collection, redoing the entire game
in 3D. While the gameplay feels
faithful, the car is too large, and
positioned too far up on the
screen, making it difficult to see
into the distance. Like many of the
other Sega Ages titles, the
graphics are ugly, with grainy
textures and interlacing artifacts,
though at least it runs at 60 FPS.
There’s a new “Arrange
Mode“ which is almost a brand
new game, adding in a whole
bunch of new courses that take
advantage of the shift to true 3D.
Whereas the levels in the original
OutRun were mostly flat with
some hills and curves, this mode
adds more mountainous terrain.
The circuit layout is completely
different, and there are now rival
cars to beat. There are also more
brand new remixes of the songs.
This version made it to America
and Europe on the Sega Classics
Collection for the PS2.

Turbo OutRun
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: ARC, GEN, FMT,
AMI, AST, IBM, C64, CPC, ZX
The arcade version of Turbo
OutRun was basically an upgrade
kit; a set of stickers and decals for
the old cabinet plus a circuit board
that could be plugged into the
expansion slot of the original 1986
OutRun, making it cheap and easy
to install. It looks very similar to
the original, although the graphics
are brighter and it throws a lot
more crazy visual effects at you.
 
As the name suggests, Turbo
OutRun comes with a new
addition: a boost button that you
can activate at practically any
time, but overheats the engine if
used too often. Cops will chase
after you occasionally, although
they don’t appear to have any
interest in pulling you over, as they
just try to knock you around a little
bit. A white car will be your
opponent to beat to the finish line,
and at every checkpoint your
girlfriend will leave you and hop
into it if you fail to stay ahead.
Magical Shower
There are a few additions, such as
dynamic weather conditions (rain,
snow, and dust storms), and
certain areas have puddles of
water or ice-coated portions of the
road that can make driving
difficult. There are also oil slicks
on the road that catch fire when
the burning exhaust from the turbo
boost touches them, in addition to
obstacles like traffic barriers, all of
which can slow you down. The car
now looks more like an F40 than a
Testarossa, and it also allows you
to choose between manual or
automatic transmission.
 
Turbo OutRun’s greatest flaw
is that it ditches the multiple
routes, so every time you play it’s
the same trip across the United
States over and over again. There
are 16 stages, beginning in New
York City and ending up in Los
Angeles. Most of the locations
have only tenuous relations to the
area they’re based on, if at all –
Atlanta is nothing but a bunch of
sand dunes, and Pittsburgh is little
more than a long, rainy field. At
least there are a few cool levels,
as you drive through the city
streets of Chicago at night and the
fields of Indianapolis at dusk.
 
To break up the pace, there
are three checkpoints, each
appearing after four stages. Here,
you get to tune up your car with
either more turbo power, a more
powerful engine, or high grip tires.
It’s a nice touch but it tends to
ruin both the pace and simplicity
that the original is known for.
 
You no longer get to choose
your music, as instead it changes
automatically after each
checkpoint. The four tracks
composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi
and Yasuhiro Takagi – “Rush A
Difficulty“, “Keep Your Heart“,
“Shake The Street“ and “Who Are
You?“ – are decent, but they lack
the smooth, laid-back feeling of
the original music.
15

Turbo OutRun was ported to
the Mega Drive. It’s fast and it
plays well, but for some reason,
looks much worse than the port of
the original OutRun. Nearly all of
the spiffy graphical effects from
the arcade version have been
wiped out entirely, and as a result,
it doesn’t feel like there’s any
difference between any of the
levels other than palette swaps.
Two new songs have been added,
but overall the quality of the music
has dropped even further. It’s a
passable port, but not to the level
it should be. This is one of the few
Mega Drive games that was
released in Japan and Europe, but
not America.
 
The best port was released
for the FM Towns, and was
converted by CRI. Though it’s still
missing some background details
and it’s not quite as smooth as the
arcade game, it’s a big step up
from the Mega Drive version. The
brand new, redbook audio,
arranged soundtrack is the best
part of the package, greatly
improving on the songs from the
arcade original.
 
US Gold once again published
the computer ports, with Probe
handling the Amiga, Atari ST and
Commodore 64 versions. The
quality of these are about the
same as the conversions of the
original game.
 
The Amiga and Atari ST
releases are by far the nicest
looking, keeping many of the
background details that were
missing in the Mega Drive and FM
Towns ports, but the animation
and speed is embarrassingly
choppy. The Commodore 64 game
isn’t as visually attractive as either
of these, but it maintains a good
sense of speed, the scrolling is far
smoother and, overall, this version
is the best of the computer ports.
The IBM PC version has a large
display window that takes up a
sizeable chunk of the screen. It’s
smooth but totally missing the
speed of the other versions, plus
there is no in-game music. The
Amstrad and Spectrum versions
are both slow and choppy to the
point of being unplayable.
The Amiga, Atari ST, and
Amstrad soundtracks have
completely new music composed
by David Lowe, which is generally
pretty decent. The Commodore 64
soundtrack was composed by
Jeroen Tel, whose work is a
fantastic rendition of the original
arcade songs. The title theme is a
brand new piece of music which
remixes parts of “Magical Sound
Shower“ from the first OutRun, in
a style consistent with his other
excellent works found in
Cybernoid. The shop theme from
Fantasy Zone also appears during
the tune-up sequences.

OutRun 3D
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: SMS
After OutRun’s success, Sega
released a number of spin-offs for
the home market, created entirely
for Westerners. OutRun 3D is one
of the first of such efforts, which
takes advantage of the shutter
effects of the Sega 3D Glasses.
The game itself is based on the
original Master System version of
OutRun, though the course layouts
have changed, and a few of the
levels are different.
A Little Bit Extra
Additionally, some effects that the
previous release couldn’t replicate
are present, like the ocean on the
side of the road on the shore
tracks, or the overhead clouds in
the plains stage. At a few points,
you even drive into tunnels and
must race in darkness. The radio
allows you to pick from four
songs. “Magical Sound Shower“
makes a return, along with three
new songs: “Midnight Highway“,
“Color Ocean“ and “Shining
Wind“, the last of which sounds a
little bit like the Space Harrier
theme. There are also three
difficulty levels to choose from,
which fill the road with more cars
and even slightly change the
layouts of the courses.
 
While these extra effects are
nice, the animation is choppier
than before, and the sense of
speed is totally gone. Plus, the 3D
effect isn’t too bad, but it’s really
nothing more than a gimmick, and
it doesn’t justify this sloppy piece
of coding. Being one of the later
Master System games, it wasn’t
officially released in North
America, making this a European
and Brazilian exclusive. It also
supports FM synth, despite not
being released in Japan.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Battle OutRun
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: SMS
Classic arcade gamers are most
likely familiar with Chase HQ by
Taito, a good old police-chase
game in which you drive a fast
black Porsche, ramming into
delinquents to take them off the
road. Well, Sega went and copied
that formula and ended up with
Battle OutRun.
 
There’s really none of the
classic OutRun elements here,
other than the game seeming like it
was built on top of the Master
System port of the original game.
Visually it’s very similar, although
the design of the car is different.
At the outset, you’re given a map
of the United States, with seven
different levels to conquer. Most
of the stage is spent dodging cars,
weaving through turns, while
avoiding oil slicks and blockades.
There are also jump ramps,
although functionally they are
completely useless.
 
Assuming you don’t waste
too much time, after a few
minutes you’ll come across the
perpetrator, who you must smash
several times until you can pull
them over. You’re then given a
monetary bonus based on your
performance, and then progress to
the next stage. The money can be
put towards purchasing a number
of upgrades, which are bought
from truck-trailers that pop up
halfway through each stage. In
addition to upgrading tires, the
chassis and the engine, you can
also purchase nitro boosts for
extra bursts of speed.
Not Much There
Battle OutRun still has bright and
vibrant graphics, the Ferrari still
controls well, and the scrolling is
smooth. There are four brand new
pieces of music, although none of
them are named. Unfortunately the
long boring levels, poor music and
backgrounds, plus extremely
annoying CPU cars, make this
rip-off of a game a five minute
curiosity at best.
 
It’s also relatively rare for a
Master System game, having only
been officially released in Europe
and Brazil.
18

OutRun Europa
Original Release: 1991
Platforms: AMI, AST, C64, CPC,
ZX, SMS, GG
OutRun Europa was licensed by
Sega and developed by Probe, the
same folks behind the computer
ports of OutRun and Turbo
OutRun. Out of all the spin-offs,
this one has fallen the farthest
from the tree. You chase criminals
through Europe, switching vehicles
at every stage. On the first you
ride a motorcycle, then hop onto a
jet ski, a Porsche, a motorboat,
and finally you get to drive the
classic OutRun Ferrari.
There’s substantially more car
combat than even Battle OutRun.
In addition to a timer, you also
have a “Shield“ meter that
indicates how much damage has
been done to your vehicle. There
are also numerous “Boost“ items
to obtain.
The motorcycle levels play
like some bad Road Rash clone, in
that you can punch other bikers
and cause them to explode (!) and
the cops will try to pull you over.
The jet ski scenes are even more
action packed, as you attempt to
fight helicopters with rockets. And
then the driving stages are about
what you’d expect, though you do
get involved in a shootout with the
main criminal at the end. It’s quite
long compared to the old games –
a single stage is longer than the
entirety of a game of OutRun.
Surprisingly Good
Perhaps since OutRun Europa
originated on home computers, the
quality of the product is far better
than the ports of the previous
games. Even the Spectrum and
Amstrad versions, while choppy,
are playable, while the Amiga
(pictured above) is by far the best
looking. The Master System
(pictured below right) and Game
Gear games are identical to each
other outside of screen size, with
the latter being the only version
released in North America.
The 8-bit computer ports are
missing the mid-level branching
paths, where you could choose a
longer but easier path, or a shorter
but harder one. The Commodore
64 version (pictured below left)
has music by Jeroen Tel, while the
Amiga, Master System and Game
Gear ports have a completely
different soundtrack by Matt
Furniss. Both are excellent.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
OutRunners
Original Release: 1992
Platforms: ARC, GEN
After a whole slew of
disappointing semi-sequels, AM2
got behind the wheel again and
brought back the graphics, the
music and their characteristic
style. OutRunners was presented
most often in its sitting cabinet
form, usually linked to multiple
machines for a maximum of eight
players. There are eight cars you
can choose from, each with
different attributes and resembling
real life cars like the red sprinter in
the original OutRun. The drivers of
the various cars are also different,
making for additional unique
ending variations.
 
While the previous games
covered North America and
Europe, OutRunners has stages
that cover the entire world. The
game route still has the same
“pyramid“ pattern it did back in
the early days, but there are two
completely different maps. There’s
now an east side and a west side
map, and the very first fork in the
road (right after you start the
game) will let you choose which of
these two layouts you want to
play through. This technically
means there are about 30 stages
total, but a few levels are
duplicated on each side.
 
The game plays pretty much
the same as the original OutRun,
as it loses the turbo button,
weather effects and rivals of Turbo
OutRun. The turning animation for
the cars is more pronounced than
before, but otherwise the game
controls about the same. However,
the game greatly benefits from
Sega’s Multi 32 board, which
allows for even faster driving
action and smooth-as-hell sprite
scaling. For the first time, the road
is actually textured, instead of the
cycling grey/black of the earlier
games. The backgrounds are
incredible and have a lot more
detail than any other game, as well
as huge hills, which makes the
tracks feel less flat. It always
keeps up the pace, because even if
you hit an obstacle and the drivers
fall out, there’s some comical
animation as they somehow fly or
jump back into the car without it
stopping. It’s accompanied by a
laugh track and is quite silly.
 
The stages become
increasingly more gorgeous as you
drive over bridges, near waterfalls,
through dense forests, and even
underwater. Compared to the lame
levels of Turbo OutRun, each
stage has a distinct background,
and you’ll drive past many famous
landmarks. Some of the vehicles
even change depending on the
stage, as you zoom by covered
wagons in the Grand Canyon,
blaze past (or through) cyclists in
China, or weave between double
decker tour buses in Hong Kong.
 
There’s now an in-game radio
station select. You can choose
from the remixes of the four
classic tunes (“Last Wave“
included!), as well as several new
songs. These aren’t quite as good
20

as the originals, but there’s some
decent stuff, like “Looking for the
Rainbow“. The voice effects are
particularly notable as well,
especially Jake Elwood (possibly a
reference to The Blues Brothers?)
as a radio announcer on the car
select screen.
OutRunners is an absolutely
brilliant game, and a fantastic
update of a classic. But sadly, it
never remotely reached the same
level of popularity. Its only home
port was on the Genesis, and it’s
rather badly done. The system
couldn’t handle the special effects
of the original OutRun, let alone
this powerful sequel. The arcade
version featured a fairly impressive
rendition of the Golden Gate
bridge, but in the Genesis version
it looks like any old bridge.
Consequently, the game feels very
scaled back, worse than the
Genesis version of OutRun.
 
The game tries to include a
multiplayer mode by dividing the
screen into two halves, but it
looks so bad it’s just silly. Worse
still is that you always have to
play split-screen, even in single-
player mode, making the view
extremely cramped.
This in itself introduces a
number of illogical technical
conundrums. If the CPU player
advances to another level before
the human player (or vice versa),
the entire backdrop changes for
both players, even if the other is in
a totally different stage. This
bizarre situation is presumably
because the system couldn’t
handle two different sets of
graphics on screen simultaneously.
 
In addition to the regular
“Arcade Mode“, there’s also an
“Original Mode“, which lets you
pick any of the levels and race
against either another player or a
computer controlled opponent.
The Japanese version included a
cheat code where you could play
as the Virtua Formula, the car
from Virtua Racing, but this was
strangely missing from the
American release. Sega didn’t
even bother to publish the game
outside of Japan themselves,
leaving the duties to Data East.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
OutRun 2019
Original Release: 1993
Platforms: GEN
OutRun 2019’s roots are probably
the most curious in the franchise.
The project was originally
conceived in the early 1990s as a
Mega CD racing title under the
name of Cyber Road. Hertz, its
creator, transferred the
development to the Genesis while
at the same time renaming the
game Junker’s High. Sega then
granted them the OutRun brand,
most likely to give Sims’ work the
extra marketing push, resulting in
this Genesis-exclusive futuristic
take on the franchise.
 
Like Turbo OutRun, there’s a
boost option which lets you go
extremely fast. Rather than
triggering it manually, it will
instead activate automatically
when you reach a certain high
speed. The general feel of the
game is a little more somber and
darker than its predecessor’s
breezy worldwide jaunts, making
the tracks rather dull to look at.
The redesigned car isn’t quite as
attractive as the Ferraris of old,
but its design is fairly cool, at
least. The music is a collection of
bad techno songs, composed by
“real“ bands like “Dual Noise“ and
“Hyper Sonic Gang“, which are
likely pseudonyms.
 
Despite feeling more like a
depressing version of F-Zero than
OutRun, at least OutRun 2019 still
succeeds on a technical level.
There are four stages, each divided
into many tracks, which makes the
game slightly longer than the
original. Each stage section has its
own background, and there are
ramps you can use to jump to
other sections of the road. There
are also some nice graphical
effects, like tunnels and
overpasses. It’s extremely easy to
fall off if you’re not paying
attention. Also new (and
unwelcome) is the big tech-y
dashboard on the bottom of the
screen. So while the core of
OutRun games is largely missing,
the game controls well and has a
respectable sense of speed,
making it a decent racing game in
its own right.
 
The regional releases have
different top speeds – 241 km/h in
Japan, 682 km/h in Europe, and
682 mph in America. This only
affects the speedometer, as the
actual speed is identical for all.
OutRun 2019 was also
released in 2005 as a standalone
game system that hooks directly
up to the TV, complete with an
analog “steering wheel“. Why they
went with this game and not the
original OutRun is unknown.

Nearly 10 years after the release
of OutRunners, Sega released
OutRun 2, a marvel of a game.
OutRun 2 looks and sounds so
good, yet in spite of the vastly
upgraded graphics it’s unbelievable
how close to its roots it feels. The
Sega Chihiro board is the new
platform, and it includes a
733MHz Intel Pentium III and
nVidia graphics processor,
approximately the same as the
Xbox, which in turn makes for an
excellent home conversion.
 
 Sega offered three different
cabinets for OutRun 2, the “Twin“
cabinet being the most popular for
linked racing. But the real surprise
is Ferrari finally licensing their
brand to Sega, so in this version
there are eight classic sports cars
from the Italian manufacturer,
which all look fantastic and drive
like a dream.
 
The biggest addition is the
new drift technique. While at a
high speed, by turning the wheel
and tapping the brake, you’ll
activate a drift, which allows you
to take rough corners with ease.
Mastering this ability is the key to
getting the best times.
 
Included are three single-
player modes. “OutRun Mode“ is
the standard arcade mode, as you
race through five out of 15
possible stages. “Heart Attack
Mode“ lets you show off your
driving skills by performing
different tricks and tasks, while
“Time Attack Mode“ is self
explanatory. There’s also a linked
“Multiplayer Mode“ for linked
cabinets like in OutRunners.
 
Breathtaking stages, a silky
smooth 3D engine, and the stars
of the game: the shiny, expensive
Ferraris. Each of the real-world
locations look stunning, as you
drive past the Eiffel Tower at
night, speed along the pyramids of
Egypt, blaze through the flower
gardens of Holland, and along the
classic beachfront just like the
original title. It’s also the only
game to make a rundown industrial
complex look gorgeous. The five
different goofy endings make an
appearance too, depending on
which course you take, just like
old times. There are three different
girls to sit next to you, depending
on which mode you’re playing.
 
In the audio department, the
three classic OutRun tunes return,
again remixed, plus four new
songs – "Risky Ride", "Shiny
World", "Night Flight" and "Life
Was a Bore" – that are actually
pretty good. The cool radio
announcer and roaring of the
crowd from OutRunners is now
gone. Sega added plenty of fan
service too: the horizon shrinks
and grows back when you change
levels, and the voice that yells out
“Checkpoint!“ is the same.
 
Sega put United Kingdom-
based company Sumo Digital in
charge of porting the game to the
Xbox, and they did a spectacular
job. They also added plenty of
23

hidden cars and stages, most
notably some from other Sega
racing games like Daytona USA 2
and SCUD Race. There’s an
expansive mission mode that puts
you through various parts of each
level and has you attempting to
fulfill certain goals like in the Heart
Attack mode. Plus plenty of
additional new tunes, notably
some nice remixes courtesy of
Richard Jacques (known for his
work on Sonic 3D Blast and Jet
Grind Radio), online head-to-head
for up to eight players through
Xbox Live, and finally, the 1986
original arcade gem to unlock.
 
In 2004, Sega released a new
version called OutRun SP.
However, calling it a mere
“upgrade“ isn’t doing the game
any justice. This new entry
includes 15 totally new stages,
tweaked physics, and more tunes,
which is way more than your
average upgrade. In the new levels
you’ll drive across the Golden
Gate bridge, through gigantic
sequoia trees, past an arctic oil
refinery, see the Moai heads of
Easter Island, zoom through a Las
Vegas-style city, and under a
starry night sky next to a space
shuttle launch.
 
New to this edition is the use
of the “slipstream“ technique
during racing, in which you
position yourself right behind an
opponent’s car to reduce wind
resistance and go above your top
speed. Another added feature is
the increased ease of play, as
players receive less speed
reduction when they crash their
car. This makes the experience
extremely easy for regulars, but
friendlier to newcomers. The
cameos between stages have
returned too, including the jet from
After Burner and the dragon from
Panzer Dragoon.
 
Two special-edition cabinets
saw a limited release under the
denomination of “deluxe“ (DX) and
“super deluxe“ (SDX), the first one
supporting four players and the
second up to eight. Strangely, the
exclusive cooperative mode the
24

SDX cabinet was created for,
allows up to four teams of two
players each to alternate control of
the car throughout a race. These
special cabinets house bigger
screens with resolutions of 800 x
480 (using Sega’s Lindbergh
hardware instead of the former
Chihiro), plus an electronic
billboard indicating real-time
ranking of players, CCD cameras
pointed at the players’ faces, and
a “public announcement“ system
for an attendant or race official.
 
The North American and
European console versions of
OutRun 2 SP are called OutRun
2006: Coast to Coast, and were
released for the PC, PS2, Xbox
and PSP. Not only do these
releases feature tracks from both
games (for a total of 30), but they
include a mission mode that
manages to outclass the original:
you now earn points when you
play, which lets you buy different
tracks, cars, songs and other
bonuses. Unlockable music
includes the whole soundtrack
from both the OutRun and Turbo
OutRun arcade games, as well as
more arranged tracks. The Xbox
version has support for custom
soundtracks. The PC version,
which can run at higher
resolutions, is the best of these,
while the Xbox version is
considered the best console port.
The PS2 release is still an
outstanding port, even if you need
to connect to the PSP version to
unlock certain stuff. The PSP
iteration is no slouch either, but it
runs at a lower framerate.
Unfortunately OutRun 2006 is
missing a few features from the
original release, like the Daytona
USA 2 and SCUD Race tracks.
 
A version of OutRun 2 SP
also appeared on XBLA and PSN
as OutRun Online Arcade. This
new port ditches all the extras of
the former console versions, so it
only has the 15 tracks from
OutRun 2 SP, and is missing the
challenge modes and extra music
remixes. However, since Sega’s
license with Ferrari expired, it is
no longer available for purchase.
 
A mobile version of OutRun 2
was also released. Known as
OutRun Mobile, it uses some
graphical assets of the original
arcade game, like the radio, but
otherwise is entirely in 3D. As one
might gather, since this predated
capable gaming phones like the
iPhone, it’s incredibly ugly,
choppy, and not at all faithful to
the original.

Sega’s After Burner, an aerial
combat game released in 1987,
ditches complexity in favor of
straightforward action. Prior to
this, 3D airplane games were all
mind numbing computer flight-sims
and ran at a crappy framerate.
Running on Sega’s “super scaler“
technology, After Burner uses
incredibly smooth pseudo-3D
effects to propel arcade gamers
into the cockpit of a jet similar to
the   F-14 Tomcat. The sole goal is
to blow up as many bad guys as
possible while trying to stay in one
piece, all set to gloriously cheesy
synth rock music. It’s undoubtedly
inspired by Top Gun, just minus
Tom Cruise and all of the
homoerotic undertones (also far
better than any of the actual Top
Gun games, of which there are far,
far too many).
After Burner and After Burner
II are both powered by the Sega
System X board, which is an
improvement over the boards that
ran previous “super scaler“ games
like OutRun and Space Harrier, all
directed by Yu Suzuki. The
controls in the first game are fairly
limited: you can climb, descend,
and rotate your plane. Turning
back and forth rapidly will send
your plane spinning dizzily, which
looks cool but ultimately doesn’t
do much. It’s impossible to crash
into the ground, and for the most
part, you don’t need to worry
about anything but dodging enemy
fire. Your primary weapon is heat-
seeking missiles – just line up an
incoming enemy fighter with your
crosshairs, wait for the “lock-on“
to appear (usually accompanied by
a frantic voice yelling “Fire!“) and
hit the fire button. Unfortunately,
missiles are in limited supply, so
you’ll need to rely on your Vulcan
cannons for easier enemies. Trying
to hit anything with bullets is
nearly impossible unless your
target’s at close range, so
conserving your missiles is
extremely important. Thankfully,
every few stages, a friendly
plane comes by and replenishes
your stock.
 
There’s very little variety;
there are a few stages set in a
canyon, where you need to weave
between the walls, but these are
really just bonus stages. Other
than the color of the sky and the
changing landscapes, the core
game never changes, but that’s
not really important, because After
Burner excels at throwing all kinds
of crazy stuff in your face. At its
best moments, you need to keep
enemy fighters in your targets,
dodge incoming missiles, and
attempt to keep track of your own
airplane amidst the explosions and
smoke trails, all while the scenery
is rocketing by, rotating completely
out of control. The sense of speed
is still unrivaled by most video
games even today.
There are also some damn
nice explosions – get hit by enemy
fire and your engines will smoke as
26

you careen downwards, creating a
line of fire and destruction as you
hit the ground. Later games in the
series had even more impressive
death sequences, with plenty of
seizure-inducing screen flashing.
The soundtrack, per usual protocol
during the mid-1980s, is
absolutely brilliant. The FM synth
of Sega’s arcade boards manages
to produce some incredibly rocking
tunes, and while there are only a
handful of songs, all composed by
Hiroshi Kawaguchi, they are all
quite memorable.
Too Crazy to Handle
Alas, After Burner’s greatest asset
is also its biggest flaw – it’s
ridiculously crazy to play. Since
your movement range is so
limited, and the screen can get
very crowded, it becomes
incredibly difficult to make your
way through later stages without
crashing and burning every few
seconds. Still, this was originally
an arcade game, designed to
provide some impressive thrills for
a few coins, and nowhere was
this more apparent than the
cabinet design.
The first release had a replica
of a flight stick, and the second
game had a model throttle that let
you control you speed. Many sit-
down cabinets even tilted as you
rotated your plane. In this respect,
After Burner is really more of a
ride than a legitimate game, which
is maybe why it doesn’t quite hold
up compared to other Sega arcade
games around the same time. But
taken as what it is, it’s nice,
flashy fun.
 
Strangely enough, there are
very few differences between
After Burner and After Burner II –
in fact, the latter isn’t so much a
sequel as it is a minor upgrade.
After Burner II has a fancier intro
(featuring a series of rotating
spheres), some new enemies, and
a handful of extra levels,
increasing the total number from
18 to 21 missions.
 
Sega also added little
intermissions where your plane
lands to rearm, which include
cameos by the motorcycle from
Hang-On and the Ferrari from
OutRun. The biggest addition is
the throttle control that lets you
speed up or slow down. Enemy
planes will occasionally pop up on
your tail, and using the throttle
can either help blow past them or
have them overshoot you so you
can deliver a killing shot.
 
The only other noticeable
difference is that you’re granted
more missiles, both when you
start and when you refuel. This
makes the game easier, and
overall less frustrating.
 
There are also some minor
differences in the instrumentation
of the music, although the
soundtracks are essentially
identical. Furthermore, there are
also “melody“ versions of three of
the songs – “Maximum Power“,
the title theme, plus “After
Burner“ and “Final Take Off“.
These versions feature an extra
melody track during most of the
song, and greatly enhance them,
to the point that the original
compositions feel rather empty.
While these are not used in-game
for the arcade version, they were
featured on various soundtrack
CDs, and were used as a basis for
some of the console version
soundtracks, including the SMS,
PCE and FM Towns ports.

The Sega Master System was
the first console to be graced with
a port of After Burner, but given
the limitations of the system, it
wasn’t particularly good. It looked
great at the time – Sega hyped it
up as being one of the first “Four
Mega“ cartridges (4 megabits or
512kb). The choppy graphics
made it far too difficult to see
what you were supposed to be
dodging, which essentially ruins
the experience. There’s also a bug
that lets you stay in one corner
and dodge all enemy fire until
about halfway through the game.
On the plus side, you have
unlimited missiles, since hitting
anything with your guns is nearly
impossible. As such, the refueling
segments have been repurposed
into bonus stages, where you try
to hook up with the larger jet’s
fueling hose for extra points.
While the canyon levels have been
removed, Sega added in a final
boss to destroy, which is a flying
fortress that feels somewhat out
of place.
 
An NES version was ported
by Tengen for American release,
but it’s substantially worse than
the Master System version. The
sprites are smaller and there’s tons
of flickering, making it borderline
unplayable. Sunsoft cleaned up
the game to remove the flicker,
enhanced the music, and changed
the color palette around to release
it on the Famicom under the name
After Burner II.
 
When the 16-bit era rolled
around, After Burner II was ported
to the Genesis by the third-party
developer Dempa. The system still
wasn’t strong enough to handle
the scaling effects, and while it
looks relatively decent, many of
the backgrounds have lost a lot of
detail, and the pace isn’t quite as
fast. The horizontal controls also
don’t snap back to a center
position, which makes it hard to
keep the plane level, undoubtedly
a concession to the digital control
pad. By default, the machine gun
is also set to auto-fire, as the
three buttons are used to fire
missiles, speed up and slow down.
There’s plenty of flicker, though
the music is decent enough.
 
Oddly enough, the PC Engine
version – ported by NEC Avenue –
has brighter graphics and
smoother gameplay, though the
background detail has been
reduced even further, and there is
a substantial amount of flicker. It
uses an odd sprite stretching
technique in order to replicate the
scaling effect. It also controls
better than the Genesis version,
and the music, rearranged for the
PC Engine synth, is excellent.
 
The 32X version – dubbed
After Burner Complete, even
though it’s really just After Burner
II – is nearly arcade perfect,
complete with smooth scaling and
faithful music. It even offers
support for the six button pad, so
you can more easily change speed
or even roll. The only noticeable
difference is that it runs at 30 FPS
rather than 60 FPS like the arcade.
 
The Saturn rendition of After
Burner II is even better than the
32X version, offering both analog
and digital control options, as well
as a smooth 60 FPS framerate. It
was released in the Sega Ages
package along with Space Harrier
and OutRun in America and
Europe, though it was a
standalone disc in Japan. The
Japanese release also includes the
“melody“ versions in addition to
the standard music.

After Burner also appears in
emulated form in Shenmue II for
the Dreamcast and Xbox. It plays
well, but lacks options, plus the
upscaled graphics are a bit on the
blurry side.
 
In 2003, Sega published the
Sega Arcade Gallery, which
offered four arcade classics,
ported by Bits Studios, for the
Game Boy Advance. After Burner
is one of the four included, though
it’s an absolutely terrible port.
While the scrolling is smooth, the
sprites are tiny, the background
detail is worse than the Genesis
version, and the controls are
remarkably poor. The Vulcan
cannon in particular has
completely changed, and the
whole game just feels off. Oddly
enough, this version is based on
the original After Burner, rather
than After Burner II.
 
After Burner appeared on
practically every major computer
in the late 1980s. Activision
published many of these versions
in Europe for the Amiga, Atari ST,
Commodore 64, IBM PC, MSX, ZX
Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. None
of these ports are particularly good
– they’re all framed in the same
ugly window, the graphic details
are poor, and the action is choppy.
These problems are
understandable with the ZX
Spectrum and MSX ports, which
are largely identical to each other.
Both feature black outlines for
sprites and incredibly choppy
scrolling. The MSX has a slight
advantage in that it has music, but
neither are particularly good. The
Amstrad CPC release is more
colorful, while the C64 version has
an excellent soundtrack courtesy
of Adam Gilmore.
The crappiness, however, is
far more evident in the Amiga and
Atari ST releases. The sprites look
decent, but it’s lacking in both
speed and smoothness. The IBM
PC version, despite running with
16 colors, is the best looking of
the computer versions, relatively
speaking, though it’s stuck with
awful sound.
 
In North America, though,
the C64 and Amiga versions were
completely redone, and are,
generally, far better efforts. The
C64 version is now full screen,
and while it’s still slow and
choppy it’s not nearly as awful,
and is roughly on the level of the
Sega Master System port. The
only downer is the lack of in-game
music. Similarly, the Amiga
version is comparable to the
Genesis release. There’s a bit
more scenery in the Amiga
version, but the music hasn’t been
terribly well converted.
 
There were two home
computer ports in Japan, for the
FM Towns and Sharp X68000.
The FM Towns conversion was
handled by CRI, who also ported a
number of other Sega games to
Fujitsu’s platform. While the
scaling isn’t quite as smooth as
the arcade version, it is still better
than any of the 8- or 16-bit
console ports, and also includes an
excellent arranged soundtrack,
exclusive to this version of the
game. The Sharp X68000 was
ported by Dempa, who had also
developed the Genesis version.
The scrolling is fairly smooth,
although the number of sprites
have been reduced, and the music
is a close approximation of the
arcade original.
After Burner II was also
ported to the PlayStation 2 in
2004 as part of the Sega Ages
2500 series, which replaced the
sprite-based graphics with
polygonal models. A lot of the
graphical luster displayed by the
original was lost in the translation
to 3D, so much of the game looks
rather ugly. Despite technically
running at a higher resolution and
with more advanced polygonal
models, the overall look is worse
than Sky Target, and that game is
on the Saturn.
Still, the gameplay has held
up almost perfectly, and the sense
of speed is still intact, so it’s not a
complete waste. Unfortunately,
none of the music is arranged, and
just uses tracks straight from the
arcade. There’s also an “Arrange
Mode“ that lets you pilot three
other aircraft, including an AV-8B
Harrier II, the A-10A Thunderbolt II
(a bomber), and the F-117
Nighthawk (a stealth jet), although
the differences between them are
pretty minor. Oddly enough, this
release was excluded from the
Sega Classics Collection that was
brought over to America and
Europe, so the only way to play it
is to snag the Japanese version.
 
That accounts for all of the
official releases but, in 2003, an
Italian development team called
Brodaroda developed their own
homebrew version for Windows
and released it for free. As to be
expected from an amateur
endeavor, it’s not particularly
good, with untextured graphics
that are even worse than the
PlayStation 2 effort, numerous
control glitches, and plane
movement that doesn’t feel right.

Despite the name change, G-LOC
(which stands for “Gravity-induced
Loss of Consciousness“) is pretty
obviously part of the After Burner
series. However, now each level
has a certain goal, usually being
“shoot down X number of
enemies“. You’re also timed, and
clearing each stage will add some
extra seconds to the clock. You
can die as often as you want, but
this naturally wastes a bit of
precious time. The graphics have
improved substantially, as the
landscape is now comprised of
scrolling textures rather than
dozens of scaling sprites pasted
together. The improvements are
due to running on Sega’s System
Y board, which also powered
Galaxy Force and Power Drift.
 
The viewpoint has been
changed to a first-person cockpit
view, although it zooms out
whenever an enemy is on your tail.
The game now focuses less on
dodging enemy fire and more on
shooting enemy planes that
saunter up behind you. You have
greater control over your plane’s
rotation, so you can also fly
completely upside down. There are
also ground based missions, where
you fly low to the ground and
dodge enemy fire as you blow up
installations. There’s now a
“damage“ meter, so you can
survive a bit of gunfire or bumps
against other fighters, but getting
hit by missiles or slamming into
bad guys will still kill you instantly.
Unfortunately, the game is much
slower, both due to its rather
lackadaisical pacing and sluggish
controls. While the original After
Burners were a little too insanely
fast, G-LOC is more relaxed almost
to the point of sedation.
But fast paced action wasn’t
necessarily G-LOC’s goal to begin
with. In the arcades, certain
cabinets (dubbed the R360)
featured a seat that could
physically turn back and forth and
even upside down, greatly
enhancing the immersion. A safety
bar keeps the player in place (like
amusement park rides) and an
emergency stop button would turn
the cockpit to its upright position.
There’s even an option to just sit
back and let the game play itself,
making G-LOC feel more like a
ride. Naturally, this was an
incredibly expensive machine, so it
didn’t exactly see widespread
distribution in arcades.
 
Since this gimmick was the
big draw for G-LOC, all of it was
lost in the home translations,
which weren’t even powerful
enough to recreate the game itself.
The Genesis version, once again,
can’t handle all of the graphics,
but most of the gameplay still
holds up. It’s a longer but easier
game, which makes it less
frustrating too. There’s a bit of
extra window dressing, like the
mission maps between levels and
the wingman who issues your
orders. Also, some levels alternate

between first- and third-person
views. The third-person stages are
a bit strange, since the horizon
doesn’t rotate and your fighter
seems to move along a parabola.
 
The Sega Master System
version completely alters all of the
levels. Half of the screen is taken
up by a HUD and the landscapes
are now rolling colors, but while
the game looks worse than the
SMS After Burner it plays a little
bit better. In addition to the time
limit, you can only die a certain
number of times before needing to
continue. Additionally, since the
after burners are gone, the chase
sequences – done in third-person
like the Genesis version – are
simple annoying sections where
you need to dodge enemy fire for
a certain period of time. Sega also
added strange boss fights to
certain stages. While the original
After Burner titles have some
grasp on reality, these bosses look
like things you’d fight in an
outerspace shoot-em-up and feel
really out of place.
 
The Game Gear version
(available on the 3DS Virtual
Console) goes off in a completely
different direction. You’re given a
choice between several missions,
with the usual goals of blowing up
a certain number of planes or
sinking a certain number of
tankers. Depending on how well
you do, you’ll get points which
can be used to upgrade your
plane. You actually control a
cursor with only limited control
over your plane, making it feel like
a static shooting gallery. The
graphics are worse than the SMS
version, and it doesn’t run
smoothly either. Your fuel meter
also acts as a life gauge, and
when you get blown up it’s game
over. An interesting experiment.
 
The European computer
ports, published by US Gold, are
all based on the arcade version.
The Amiga and ST ports look
much worse than the Genesis
version, since the landscape is
completely barren, but technically
they play alright, and the plane
controls well with the mouse.
 
The other versions, on 8-bit
computers, are wretched – they’re
slow, choppy and ugly. The
Commodore 64 port was so bad
that British magazine Zzap! 64
surmised that G-LOC actually
stood for “Great Load Of Crap”.

Strike Fighter is essentially a
variation on G-LOC, except it’s
more faithful to the original After
Burner. The pace is much faster,
there’s no time limit to worry
about, and the level-based
structure has returned. You also
have unlimited missiles now,
which is quite an improvement.
The graphics engine is practically
the same as G-LOC’s, and the
first-person cockpit view returns,
except for when enemies get on
your tail. There’s a greater visual
variety in levels, and some of them
are excellent, especially the stage
that takes place over lava. While
the gameplay is faster, it still
suffers from the slow turning
speed of G-LOC, and the music is
still fairly forgettable. While it’s a
pretty decent game, it lacks the
intensity of the original After
Burner and its sequel. Strike
Fighter only saw release in
Japanese arcades.
After Burner III is a
bastardized port of Strike Fighter,
ported by CRI. It was originally
released on the FM Towns
computer, before being ported to
the Sega CD. Despite the relative
strengths of both platforms, After
Burner III looks noticeably worse
than the Genesis ports of After
Burner II and G-LOC.
 
There’s barely any detail to
the landscape other than a
handful of tiny sprites which are
spread sparsely throughout, and
it’s totally lacking the energy that
made the previous entries so
chaotically compelling. There are
a couple of impressive visual
tricks, however, like the take-off
sequence and the transitions from
first- to third-person views, both
of which are exactly like the
arcade version of Strike Fighter.
Plus, some of the animation is
quite nice, and the landscape
rotation is the smoothest of any
of the 16-bit versions.
 
The Sega CD release (below)
adds an optional third-person view
to make it feel like the older
games. However, your plane is
gigantic and blocks too much of
the screen. The only real
advantage of the CD format is the
opening cutscene, wherein some
professional announcer rants about
how awesome the F-14 Tomcat is.

laid back for a game about jet

version uses some of these tracks,
most of the in-game music has
been replaced with music from the
FM Towns ports of After Burner II,
which is far, far superior.
 
Although the Sega CD

awful game. After this somewhat
embarrassing release, it’s easy to
see why the public didn’t exactly
have confidence in the power of
the Sega CD.

Released only in the arcades on
the Naomi hardware, Sega Strike
Fighter is only listed here by virtue
of including “Strike Fighter“ in its
title. It actually bears little
resemblance in theme to the older
After Burner games, and instead
plays much closer to a game like
Air Combat – which is to say,
slower and slightly more realistic.
The game is set up similarly to
G-LOC, in that you have a time
limit to destroy a certain number
of bad guys before you can move
on. You can choose your missions
as well. Once again there is a a
life bar, but it’s all too easy to turn
upside down, bang into the
ground and severely damage your
hi-tech fighter.
In addition to the standard
controls, there’s also a pedal that
lets your fighter strafe, although
it’s still rather hard to keep your
plane under control. Sega Strike
Fighter’s big gimmick is the three
screen sit-down cabinet, which
creates a greater sense of
immersion. It’s an okay game, but
taken in the context of After
Burner, it’s clear that the apple
has fallen pretty far from the tree.

Sky Target
Original Release: 1995
Platforms: ARC, SAT, PC
35
Once again, Sega masks its
lineage by giving a completely new
name to what’s obviously a new
installment in the After Burner
series. Sky Target is the first fully
polygonal game in the series,
courtesy of the Model 2 hardware.
While the Vulcan/lock-on missile
set up is the same, the pace is a
bit slower, and the handling is
more comparable to Star Fox 64.
There are four different planes to
pick from: the F-14D, the RAFALE
M, the F-16C, and the F-15S/MTD.
Each has slightly different
movement capabilities and missile
loadouts. Unfortunately the
throttle controls, from previous
games, have been removed.
 
After the first few levels the
game branches off and lets you
take different paths to the final
stage. There are only a few
alternate stages, and there are
only 12 levels in total, but it does
add to the replayablity. At the end
of each stage you’ll encounter
some kind of boss – they range
from gigantic planes to deadly
blimps. These make it feel a bit
more like a Panzer Dragoon game,
especially with the multiple weak
spots you need to hit to take them
down. While these battles are
unlike what you’d find in most of
the other After Burner titles,
they’re less silly than the foes in
the Master System version of G-
LOC. You only get one life per
credit, although now your plane
has a lifebar and can absorb a fair
amount of damage. Unfortunately
the music is the worst kind of
generic butt rock, all done with
very cheesy synth, though the
composers tossed in a (rather limp)
arrangement of the “After Burner”
theme song.
Skies of Saturn
Beyond the arcade release, Sky
Target was also ported to the
Saturn and Windows PCs. The
Windows version is a faithful port,
but the Saturn version (pictured)
isn’t quite as good looking. The
Saturn version also has a “Ranking
Mode“, which lets you replay any
missions you’ve beaten in “Arcade
Mode“ in order to get high scores.
 
Sky Target isn’t bad, but
much like earlier efforts, the lack
of speed makes the action feel
slightly dull. It doesn’t help that
the Saturn port runs at an
inconsistent speed, constantly
shifting gears depending on the
action. Plus, the textures are
painfully low-res and the draw-in is
quite noticeable. The missile trails
also don’t look right. On some
level, it’s actually more playable
since you can see what’s going
on, but it’s also not quite as fun.
 
The manual also elucidates on
the silly plot, where you play as a
pilot from Mad Dog, a secret
military organization, fighting
against the Deldine Corporation,
which has stolen a top-secret
weapon from the military.

After Burner Climax
Original Release: 2006
Platforms: ARC, 360, PS3
Even though After Burner
technically had many follow-ups,
none really captured the style of
the original arcade release. After
Burner Climax, released in arcades
in 2006, is as close to a proper
sequel as possible. Much like
OutRun 2, it takes the basic
concept of its predecessor, and
revamps it for the 21st century,
both from a visual and gameplay
perspective, while still keeping it
faithful in spirit. The result is a
totally brilliant experience.
After Burner Climax runs on
the Sega Lindbergh board, which is
essentially a Pentium 4 computer
with a NVIDIA GeForce 6800
video card. It looks absolutely
gorgeous, totally outclassing the
After Burner PS2 remake and After
Burner Black Falcon, not only in
technical force but artistry. Many
of the levels are the same types
seen in the original arcade game –
oceans, cities, deserts – but now
meticulously rendered with high
definition textures. Several new
areas are immensely impressive as
well, with one taking place over
volcanic islands, and another flying
underneath the aurora borealis.
  
There are a few canyon
stages, and naturally these have
much more detail than the simple
ones found in the original arcade
game, as you dodge between
mountains or underneath rock
formations. Additionally, there are
even a couple of interior levels,
where you fly through factories
and need to avoid smashing into
the walls or scenery – these feel
akin to if Star Fox 64 stabbed
itself in the heart with some
adrenaline. The sense of speed is
perhaps even faster than before,
and maintains 60 frames per
second consistently.
  
The music is, unfortunately,
rather grating, though the original
(and superior) After Burner II
soundtrack is available to listen to
as well. There’s also quite a bit of
radio chatter throughout, mostly
discussing your attempts to attack
the ambiguous nation of Z and its
nuclear arsenal. Most of it is
indecipherable and drowned out by
the music.
Like Before But Better
The core gameplay is much the
same as it was in After Burner II,
though some elements have been
borrowed from Sky Target. You
now have an armor meter allowing
you to take a few hits before
crashing, and missiles slowly
regenerate on their own, so
technically you can never run out.
 
There are three different jet
fighters – F-14D Super Tomcat,
F/A-18E Super Hornet and F-15E
Strike Eagle – though there’s not
much of a difference between
them. The stage route has a few
branching paths, plus a handful of
“secret missions“ that require you
to destroy specific enemies and
can also open up different levels.
36

There are also three different
endings, based on the route you
take as well as how successful
you are with secondary objectives.
There’s also the “Climax“ gauge,
as referenced in the title. As you
destroy enemies, it quickly fills up
– when maxed out, you can use it
to slow down time and target an
unlimited amount of enemies with
an infinite supply of missiles,
making it quite handy for those
moments when dozens of bad
guys appear on the horizon.
  
In the arcades, After Burner
Climax was released using the
same sort of hydraulic motion
cabinets as its predecessors. Four
years after its launch, it was
released on the Xbox Live Arcade
and PlayStation Network as a
downloadable title. It’s a brilliant
port, because not only does it
perfectly replicate the high
definition visuals, but it also
introduces a series of bonuses
called “EX Options“.
When reaching certain
milestones (such as shooting
down enough enemies, playing
through all of the routes, and so
forth), it opens up some in-game
element to tinker with, including
the number of credits, the size of
the lock-on reticule, the armor on
your jet fighter, and so forth.
Beyond posting scores on the
online leaderboards, this provides
an incentive to continually replay
the game, which is especially nice
for a title originally developed for
the arcades.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
This PSP title is often mistaken for
a port of After Burner Climax, but
it’s actually a completely different
game developed by Planet Moon
Studios, previously known for
goofy shooters like Giants: Citizen
Kabuto and Armed and Dangerous.
It’s also technically the first After
Burner title developed specifically
for a home audience.
Portable Strengths
Instead of a 21-stage marathon,
After Burner Black Falcon is
broken down into a huge number
of short missions lasting roughly
five minutes each, where the goal
is simply to get to the end while
destroying as much stuff as
possible along the way. The
graphics aren’t particularly special,
but they move fast and there’s
plenty of variety. Fortunately, the
mechanics feel just about spot on,
with quick movement and smooth
controls. The soundtrack is
supplied by American rock group
Trans Am, most of which lacks the
appeal of the old music.
 
In addition to the standard
Vulcan cannons and heat-seeking
missiles, you also have an air-to-
ground cannon to destroy land
based targets. If you destroy
multiple enemies simultaneously
you’ll get a combo bonus, which
spawns a bonus crate containing
health or ammo replenishments.
You also execute a 360 roll by
pressing the triangle button, which
is practically required to dodge
projectiles. It takes some getting
used to, because it’s hard to see
incoming missiles with all of the
action going on, and trying to
dodge bullets is unnecessarily
difficult. Although you have a
damage meter and multiple lives
per stage, it’s easy to burn
through all of that if you’re not
paying attention. If it becomes too
frustrating, you can always set the
game to Easy, because you can
take plenty of hits.
 
There are usually multiple
objectives in each stage, which
involve killing a certain number of
enemies or completing the
missions quickly. Higher scores
will give you more cash to buy
new aircraft and upgrade your
weapons. There are tons of
licensed craft from Northrop
Grumman, Lockheed Martin and
Boeing, and unlike the extra ships
in the Sega Ages After Burner,
there are huge differences in their
power, speed and handling.
 
The mission structure and
customization add greatly to the
replay value, and allows for
convenient quick play, since the
missions are pretty short.
Unfortunately, the landscapes
usually repeat at least twice over
the course of the level – some kind
of variety would’ve been nice.
Still, the package is pretty good
overall, considering it’s taken an
inherently shallow game and given
it some lasting value.

Master Burner /
Master Burner Climax
Original Release: 2005 / 2009
Platforms: PC
Master Burner isn’t an official
After Burner game, but rather a
Japanese doujin title. Created by
DNA Softwares and released in a
package spoofing the Sega Ages
2500 line (dubbed “Touhou Ages“
here), Master Burner replaces the
F-14 Tomcat with Marisa Kirisame,
the yellow-haired witch from a
variety of Touhou shooters. Many
of the landscapes are similar,
although some take place in unique
locales like libraries. All of the
enemies have been replaced with
fairies and little comets which
have that goofy little grimacing
face that are prevalent on
Japanese message boards.
 
The graphics are almost a
spot-on copy of the style used in
the original arcade After Burner,
although some of the spritework
looks a bit off by comparison. All
of the music consists of modified
versions of the FM tunes from the
arcade game.
 
Things seem to control just a
little bit differently – the controls
are somewhat twitchier, and the
landscape seems to zoom by
slightly faster than it did in After
Burner. While you’ll still rely
heavily on missiles, the standard
Vulcan cannon is far more useful
than it ever was before. Your
missile supply is still limited,
although it partially recharges after
each stage and is fully replenished
every few stages by Reimu
Hakurei, one of the stars from
several Touhou games. There are
also boss battles with assorted
other Touhou characters.
 
In 2009, three developers –
Shooting Area, Aquaelie,
Hexaflange – came together to
create Master Burner Climax
(below). Named and based loosely
on After Burner Climax, this entry
is entirely in 3D. However, it is
much less of a blatant clone than
the original Master Burner.

Shinobi
Original Release: 1987
Platforms: ARC, SMS, PCE, NES,
AMI, AST, CPC, ZX, C64, MSX,
IBM, MOB, PS3, 360, WII
Ninjas were a huge thing,
worldwide, in pop culture media in
the 1980s. Their popularity can be
seen in any number of imported
karate flicks, but perhaps their
biggest influence can be seen on
video games from the time.
Although Sega’s Shinobi (a word
that’s basically a synonym for
“ninja“), initially released in 1987,
was not the first ninja game, it
was one of the most popular ones.
The hero, Joe Musashi, started
slicing up terrorists and created
the path for scores of other
cloaked assassins.
Birth of the Ninja
Beginning life in the arcades,
Shinobi’s gameplay style changed
quite a lot as sequels appears on
consoles and portables. Despite
these alterations, there are
common threads throughout the
games. Taking place in a near
futuristic setting, you’ll fight
against army men and ancient
Japanese demons, as well as
biological monsters and robots.
Almost all of the games arm your
character(s) with swords and
shurikens, as well as ninjitsu magic
to clear the screen of enemies or
grant temporary invulnerability.
Regardless of the style of each
game, most of them range from
good to excellent, with only two
real below par efforts.
 
The original Shinobi, released
on the Sega System 16 board, is a
pretty straightforward arcade
affair, putting you in the shoes of
ace ninja Joe Musashi (who,
lacking a cool mask, doesn’t look
as cool as the iconic title screen
suggests). An evil organization
called Zeed has begun terrorizing
the Oboro ninja clan by kidnapping
their children. The goal of each
level is to find all of the hostages
and escape to the end, although
the kids are never hidden and
finding them is pretty easy. The
basic mechanics borrows heavily
from Namco’s Rolling Thunder
games, mixing strategic gameplay
with fast action. Like Rolling
Thunder, you jump between planes
by holding up or down and hitting
jump. Joe can leap between
rooftops, or behind fences, in dual-
plane level designs that were
pretty original for 1987.
Of course, the relentless
stream of bad guys makes the trek
difficult – some of them mindlessly
charge at you, but others hide
behind boxes or block your attacks
with shields. Even more deadly are
the ninjas, who appear out of
nowhere in large numbers and will
surround Joe if they’re not dealt
with quickly. Sure, you’ll be
hammering that fire button to toss
out as many shurikens as possible,
but you’ll also have to properly
time your assault, hopping on
enemies while they’ve dropped
their defenses. While your primary
weapon is an unlimited supply of
throwing shurikens, getting close
40

to an enemy and attacking will
unleash a melee attack – either a
karate punch or a sword slash,
depending on your power-up –
that will usually break through
their defenses. Joe’s a fragile ninja
and one bullet or stab wound will
kill him, sending him back to the
beginning of the level, but he can
still ram into enemies as long as
no weapons touch him. This is
actually one of the finer strategies
of the game, as it allows you to
stun enemies and deliver a quick
killing blow.
There are plenty of
memorable boss battles too, plus
they will usually make an
appearance in the stages, to taunt
you or get off a few quick shots.
Each boss is introduced with a
document prefacing every level,
showing the route of your attack.
and their portrait, which is
stamped when they are killed. The
first is a hulking armor-clad warrior
named Ken-Oh, who tosses
fireballs from his fists and can only
be damaged with a shuriken right
in the face. The second is Black
Turtle, an entire helicopter, which
sends a flood of soldiers out of its
bay doors until you, a mere human
ninja, can take it down.
The third level has a strange
mechanical face called Mandara,
which is attached to the wall and
shoots bounding fireballs from its
mouth. It’s guarded by a series of
rotating statues that slowly creep
forward and try to crush you
against the wall. The fourth boss,
Lobster, is a large sword-wielding
samurai that, again, can only be
attacked in the head. Finally, the
fifth and ultimate enemy, the
Masked Ninja known as Nakahara,
who is also Joe’s former mentor,
wields the power of lightning.
The game can be tough, but
you get ninja magic to use once
each level, which clears the screen
of enemies or does some cheap
and easy damage to bosses. There
are bonus stages are first-person
shooting galleries, where you
chuck shurikens at an approaching
horse of ninjas. If you miss too
many and they get too close, you
lose. These scenes are extremely
tough but reward the skillful ninja
with extra lives. The arcade game
was originally slated to use a
shuriken-shaped controller, which
was said to work great for the
bonus levels, but since it hindered
the rest of the game it was
changed to a standard joystick.
Overall, Shinobi is still a
damn fine game. It’s tough but
fair, and meticulously designed,
creating a true classic that’s aged
very well.
Ninja In My House!
The first home port of Shinobi was
the Master System version. While
significantly slower paced than the
arcade game, it maintains the
methodical feel of the gameplay,
and is still excellent. There are
noticeable additions too, including
a life bar and several new
weapons you get for rescuing
hostages, including guns, whips
and bombs. Rescuing the hostages
is also no longer mandatory,
although given the power-ups, is a
worthwhile thing to do. However,
the importance of ninja magic is
downplayed, as you only get to
use it after beating one of the
incredibly difficult bonus stages.
 
Much of the music is gone
and replaced with a single tune,
but the huge bosses still remain,
although they don’t taunt you
during the stages anymore.
Despite being a very different
game, it’s still one of the Sega
Master System’s better action
titles, even if they cut the ending:
upon beating Nakahara you get
41

the same “Game Over“ as you
would if you’d run out of lives.
Tengen’s Nintendo
Entertainment System port is
based on the Sega Master System
game, although it suffers from
terrible graphics and shaky
gameplay, like all of their
conversions. The additional close-
ranged weapons are gone, the
vertically scrolling stages have
been redesigned into horizontal
stages, and Joe can only toss a
single projectile at a time. The
ninja on the title screen is also
amusingly cross-eyed.
The PC Engine version,
converted by Asmik, is closer to
the arcade game, with decent (if
somewhat darker) graphics and
similar gameplay. However, all of
the close-up melee attacks are
gone, severely altering the way
the game is played. It’s also
missing the second stage from the
original, and the bonus levels are
completely gone.
There are also a couple of
home computer versions, mostly
for European markets. The Amiga
and Atari ST deliver the most
faithful ports, which only differ
from the arcade version in
resolution, colors and HUD, as
well as some different mechanics.
Since most of these computers
only support 1-button joysticks,
Joe now jumps by pressing up,
while holding the attack button
and tapping either up or down
switches between the planes. All
the 8-bit computers have to live
with even more compromises: the
graphics are redrawn for all, and
they lose the boss title-cards that
used to be shown before each
stage. Because of the not-so-
smooth controls, they’re also a bit
harder than the original.
The C64 also loses the music,
as well as some Spider-Man look-
a-like enemies in the second level.
The same goes for the IBM PC
version, which seems to be based
on the C64 release, but is a rather
shoddy port altogether, with
terrible controls and broken enemy
patterns. The laziest is the MSX
“port“ though, which is just a
conversion from the Spectrum
with the same yellow-dominated
four-color graphics.
The only other nearly-perfect
ports of Shinobi are found as an
unlockable on Sonic’s Ultimate
Genesis Collection for the
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, or as
a separate download on the Xbox
Live Arcade. The latter version has
the Marilyn Monroe pictures that
used to decorate stage 1-2
removed, and the Spider-Man
enemy is now painted green.
Shinobi for mobile phones
appeared in China, dubbed Guiying
Renzhe (“Ghost Ninja Shinobi“).
Western sources refer to it as
“Shinobi Tolerance“. This is a
complete remake rather than a
port, with entirely new graphics
(the hero now looks like Hotsuma
from the PS2 game and rescues
hot ninja chicks) and a second
character to unlock. Joe (or
Hotsuma?) also gets a health bar
with three hit points and three
different ninja spells.
This is no doubt the best
looking version of the game, but
the controls are terrible, as is
typical for mobile phone games.
Planes are switched by holding up
(which is also jump) or down
(duck) for a while, and probably

first stage.
The Marilyn Monroe pictures
are gone here as well, and the
Spidermen are turned into goo-
ninjas similar to the ones in
Shinobi II on the Game Gear.

Shadow Dancer
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: ARC, SMS, AMI,
AST, C64, CPC, ZX
While there were many follow-ups
that came out in quick succession
on various platforms, Shadow
Dancer is the only true sequel to
the original arcade Shinobi, as the
gameplay is pretty much the same.
It runs on Sega’s System 18
board; the major difference is a
considerable graphical upgrade
from its predecessor. This is
especially noticeable for the main
character, who has undergone a
drastic overhaul and now wears a
cool white costume similar to the
one in The Revenge of Shinobi.
This time you play as Hayate,
Joe’s son, as it’s set several years
down the line.
 
New for this game is Hayate’s
canine companion named Yamato,
who follows him throughout the
game and will periodically
incapacitate foes, thus allowing for
an easy takedown. Another visual
treat is that casting ninja magic
shows a cool cinematic close up of
Hayate, with a background of
colored burning flames behind him.
Other than the dog friend, the
changes are minor. The enemy
organization this time is known as
Asian Dawn, who has
commandeered the Space Shuttle
Olympia, and has planned to use it
to launch an attack via satellites.
In order to distract the hero, they
have planted bombs everywhere,
so these need to be defused in
every stage before proceeding.
 
The levels include an airport,
a junkyard, a cave, and final base
at the foot of the space shuttle.
The bonus stages are similar to the
previous game, although now you
toss shurikens upward at ninjas
that are slowly descending a
building. The bosses are not quite
as inspired, though it does include
a slightly silly “man vs. train“ fight
– fundamentally it’s not that much
more ridiculous than the helicopter
from the previous game. While
Shadow Dancer is sometimes
viewed as a step backwards
compared to the advances made
by the almost-simultaneously
released Genesis title, The
Revenge of Shinobi, it still
recaptures the knife-flicking
intensity of its arcade predecessor
and is a fine sequel.
 
Since the Genesis game is
entirely different from the arcade
original, “true“ ports of Shadow
Dancer were mostly available in
Europe. The Sega Master System
version was only released in PAL
territories and Brazil, and the hero
has been renamed Takashi. While
it admirably captures the huge
character graphics, it’s simply too
much for the 8-bit system to
handle, as it controls and plays
horribly. The graphics are
inconsistent, ranging from decent
to awful (many of the bad guys
have green skin) and it flickers
with the intensity of hell. Your dog
friend doesn’t follow you anymore,
but he can be summoned to bite
enemies. It’s missing several levels
too. The soundtrack is all new,

Shadow Dancer: The Secret of
Shinobi
Original Release: 1990
Platforms: GEN, PS2, PSP, WII,
WIN
Much like ESWAT, another Sega
arcade-to-home conversion, the
Genesis version of Shadow Dancer
is completely different from the
arcade game. The story depends
on which version of the game
you’re playing: in Japan, the hero
is Hayate, Joe Musashi’s son,
while in the English version you’re
playing as Joe Musashi himself.
His goal this time is to take down
the absurdly named terrorist
organization Union Lizard.
While the basic mechanics
remain the same as before, the
game consists of five mostly new
levels, though some of them are
reminiscent of stages in the arcade
version. The most memorable new
levels include a burning town
(complete with waving flame
effects and bursts of fire shooting
from the sewers), an urban district
in the midst of an earthquake, and
a battle at the top of the Statue of
Liberty. The soundtrack is also
completely different.
The boss battles are a little
unimpressive compared to the
arcade version (no battles with
trains, unfortunately), but they’re
still well designed. The graphics
are comparable despite the limited
palette of the Genesis, although
the magic attacks are missing the
cool close-ups. The soundtrack is
also new, and more reminiscent of
The Revenge of Shinobi.
You’re still accompanied by
your faithful dog, and this time
you can even directly command
him to attack by holding down the
attack button. The dog can jump
over boxes and otherwise leap up
at enemies that would normally be
out of your range.
 
There are a few other minor
changes as well – you’re back to
rescuing hostages as opposed to
disarming bombs. The bonus
stages have changed drastically
and steer away from the first-
person shooting galleries of the
other games. Instead, the hero
leaps off a gigantic building and
you are instructed to “SHOOT ALL
NINJAS!“ as he hurtles towards
the pavement.
While Shadow Dancer is a bit
easier compared to the other
games, there are several difficulty
levels, including an option to play
without shurikens. Overall, it
stands up respectably to the
arcade version.
Corrupting Germany
This version of Shadow Dancer is
featured on the PS2 and PSP Sega
Genesis Collection, but is missing
from Sonic’s Ultimate Genesis
Collection for the PS3 and X360.
Why? The game is on Germany’s
index of “youth-endangering
media“, and thus cannot be sold
there. Being too cheap to apply for
the game to be taken off the
index, as is done with other games
that used to be considered as
violent in their time, Sega removed
the game from all regions.

The Revenge of Shinobi
AKA: The Super Shinobi (JP)
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: GEN, SCD, DC, PS2,
PSP, 360, PS3, WII, WIN
One of the first titles released in
America for the Genesis, The
Revenge of Shinobi was one of the
strongest Sega had to offer. The
reigns of the series were handed
to a completely different team
than the arcade games, led by
Noriyoshi Ohba, who would later
direct the Streets of Rage series.
In a departure from the rather
straightforward arcade action of its
predecessor, Revenge ditches the
concept of saving hostages and
introduces larger, more open levels
(and eliminates the need to hold
up-and-jump to leap to different
levels). The result are levels and
bosses that aren’t as tightly
designed as before, but at the
same time everything feels less
rigid. Now Joe Musashi must trek
through eight stages to eliminate
the evil Neo Zeed terrorist
organization. He also gets a life
bar, although the amount of
shurikens is limited in return.
 
Thankfully, power-up boxes
are strewn throughout each stage,
granting weapon power-ups and
shuriken refills. Many of them are
filled with bombs though, so it’s
wise to be careful. One particularly
cool move is a midair spinning
somersault, which allows you to
double-jump higher and throw a
powerful barrage of shurikens at
once. You also have a selection of
four different ninja spells which
you can use at any time, including
a screen-clearing fire attack
(Karyu), a lightning barrier
(Ikazuchi), a high jump spell
(Fushin), and a ninjitsu that will
cause Joe to explode (Mijin),
taking away one of his lives, but
doing massive damage to
everything on the screen. The
latter is quite useful, because it
also refills your health after using
it, thereby skirting the level
checkpoint you normally get sent
back to when you die.
 
Otherwise the most valuable
power-up, the POW icon, grants
fiery shurikens, which deal twice
as much damage and gives Joe a
new sword with a longer range,
which he also uses to protect
himself against projectiles when
walking forward. Take one hit and
it’s gone, though. Keeping with its
lineage, The Revenge of Shinobi is
incredibly difficult, although Easy
Mode grants nine lives.
 
While almost quaint now, the
huge character sprites were
remarkable for the time, especially
compared to pretty much any NES
game. Granted, the pacing is a
little bit on the slow side, as Joe
just kind of saunters through each
stage, but the imaginative designs
still hold up well. There are some
spectacularly cool boss battles –
one early battle is against a room
of lasers controlled by a human
brain that’s locked in a machine.
Another is fought in a disco. Some
other particularly memorable levels
include an airborne jet plane (be
careful not to get sucked out the
doors) and battles against fake

nuns, who throw off their habits
to reveal psycho stripper ninja
babes. The entire last level is a
huge maze in a Japanese castle,
and the final boss battle is a race
against time – you fight an evil
kabuki master while your fiance
Naoko is trapped in a cage,
threatened by the rock ceiling
about to crush her if you’re not
fast enough. Depending on how
well you do there are two endings;
rescuing your girl and getting the
good ending is quite tough.
The Revenge of Shinobi is
also renowned for its soundtrack,
created by video game music
legend Yuzo Koshiro. While the
music is possibly a bit overrated
compared to Koshiro’s other
works of the era, like Streets of
Rage and Actraiser, there are a
number of decent tunes, especially
the boss battle “Terrible Beat“.
 
The designers were also
clearly comic book fans. You not
only fight against a muscleman
who lobs cars at you and slowly
turns green as he takes damage,
but later bosses include a dinosaur
that looks suspiciously like
Godzilla, while the most
controversial is a battle against
famous super heroes Spider-Man
and Batman. There are also regular
enemies with military outfits and
Rambo-style bandanas.
 
It seems that at some point
the copyright holders stepped in
and regulated. Even on the
Genesis, alterations have been
made at least twice. In the second
version of the ROM, Batman and
Rambo were changed: the former
was replaced by a more bestial
bat-monster, while the latter all
had their heads shaved. The third
version includes a copyright by
Marvel, indicating that Spider-Man
is an official cameo. The fourth
version strips Godzilla of its skin,
leaving only a skeleton and the
internal organs. Unfortunately, it is
impossible to distinguish the
version by looking at the carts.
The first, unaltered version seems
to be rare, and possibly even
nonexistent outside of Japan.
 
During the 1990s though,
The Revenge of Shinobi saw
several more re-releases. Other
than the budget Sega Classics
release, it was stuck on the 4-in-1
Arcade Classics disc that came
bundled with the Sega CD, and
later packed in a 5-in-1 cartridge.
It was also included on the Sega
Smash Pack Vol. 1 for Dreamcast.
 
After the deal with Marvel
ended, The Revenge of Shinobi
was left out of many Sega
compilations, until it was edited
again for digital download on the
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii,
which recolor the Spider-Man boss
to be pink. These version also
change the look of the iconic
digitized face on the title screen to
make it look less like Sonny Chiba,
the famous Japanese actor who
originally modeled for the shot.

Widely regarded as the best in the
series, Shinobi III: Return of the
Ninja Master takes everything that
made The Revenge of Shinobi
awesome and gives it a karate kick
in the pants. Four long years had
passed since the launch of the
Genesis, and plenty of graphical
evolution had taken place since
then – so Shinobi III looks damn
good. The story is the usual, with
Joe Musashi taking on the newly
resurrected Neo Zeed organization
once more. With the addition of a
dash maneuver (and a running
slash), the gameplay has gotten
quite a bit faster, which was
one of the only real shortcomings
of its predecessor.
There are a few new moves
as well, including a block
maneuver you can use at any time
(as opposed to when powered up
like in The Revenge of Shinobi),
and a jump kick to strike from
midair. In general Joe Musashi has
become much more agile, and he
can now wall-jump and grapple
along ceilings. The difficulty has
also been tuned a bit, although it’s
still no walk in the park, especially
in the final stage, where you need
to put all of your acrobatic skills to
the test to leap between narrow
electrified walls and ceilings.
Shinobi III continues the
series tradition of excellent boss
designs, but the design also seems
influenced by the Contra games,
featuring “vehicle“ stages and
some really cool set-pieces. One
level takes place in a huge cave of
biological goop, with some strange
creature in the background visibly
targeting your ninja. Naturally, you
face this thing at the end, and he’s
one of the most gruesome looking
creations seen on the Genesis.
 
Other notable boss fights
include a mecha-Godzilla type
robot, and a final battle in a
colorful, spacey virtual field,
similar to a battle in Contra: Hard
Corps. One level occurs on
horseback while another takes a
radical page from Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles by giving Joe
Musashi a surfboard. A later level
has you climbing a long vertical
mountain by jumping from falling
bits of debris, although badly
timing your double jumps can send
you to your death. The penultimate
stage is also a tribute to the maze-
like castle in The Revenge of
Shinobi, as well as a take on its
final boss (though there’s no time
limit this time, thankfully). The
design still isn’t as tight as some
of the Konami titles it seems
patterned after, but it’s still one of
the most inspired action games on
the Genesis.
The music is no longer
supplied by Koshiro, and is instead
provided by Hirofumi Murasaki,
Morihiko Akiyama and Masayuki
Nagao. The trio have not really
done any notable works before or
since (though Nagao contributed to
Sonic the Hedgehog 3), but even
so it’s still an excellent

soundtrack, providing more
complex compositions than
typically seen in video game
music. While generally not as
melodic or immediately memorable
as Koshiro’s tracks, it utilizes
digitized samples much better than
most titles on the system, and is
generally in a class of its own.
What is rather confusing is
the naming convention. In Japan,
the title is The Super Shinobi II,
clearly showing that it is the
sequel to the first Mega Drive /
Genesis game, and that the
gameplay should be different to
the arcade titles. However, the
Western releases deemed it
Shinobi III. So which was
supposed to be “Shinobi II“ then?
The Revenge of Shinobi? Shadow
Dancer? Or perhaps the atrocious
The Cyber Shinobi? No one really
knows for sure.
While it was a Genesis
exclusive in its time, Shinobi III
has since been included in both
the Sega Genesis Collection (PS2,
PSP) and Sonic’s Ultimate Genesis
Collection (PS3, X360). It is also
available on Steam for Windows
PCs, and as an iOS app – like this
is the kind of game you would
want to play with touch-screen
controls only!
When Shinobi III was
originally previewed in magazines,
it featured screenshots of areas
and enemies that were totally
different from the final release.
While initially intended to be
published in 1992, it didn’t
actually come out until 1993, so it
seems like Sega changed quite a
bit during the delay. Two beta
ROMs have leaked onto the
internet showing many of the
elements that were altered.
The first beta is almost
entirely different, showing off a
huge number of stages that are
completely unlike the final release.
It’s only barely playable, is full of
glitches and bosses that don’t
attack right, so it serves more to
show off what was changed.
Unused areas include a night-time
stage in a Japanese castle, a
canyon, and a refinery. Previously
unseen enemies include a mid-
boss with a gigantic machine gun,
a muscular dude with an
extending arm and some kind of
mutated tiger. There’s also a fifth
ninjitsu power called Hakuiru,
which uses the power of ice and
freezes everything on the screen,
thereby making all special attacks
analogous to the ninjas in the
Game Gear games. There’s also a
strange hidden puzzle game.
The second beta ROM is
much closer to the final game, but
with several subtle changes
(including enemies which appear
to be riding Return of the Jedi-
style speeders), and a variation on
the labyrinth level that removes
the maze elements.

The Cyber Shinobi (or as noted on
the title screen, Shinobi Part 2)
sounds like it should be an
amazing game, since it combines
two popular subjects, cyborgs and
ninjas, which should result in pure
awesomeness. Yet despite the
great premise, it misses the mark
completely and falls flat on its
face. It doesn’t play anything like
any of the other games in the
series, except inasmuch as it’s a
depressingly pale imitation of The
Revenge of Shinobi.
 
Through six overly long,
boring stages, you take on screen
after screen of mooks working for
Cyber Zeed, the new criminal
organization to be defeated. All of
the enemies in the area must be
killed before you can continue,
similar to beat-em-ups like Double
Dragon. Your cyber ninja,
ostensibly a descendent of Joe
Musashi, can only attack with a
weak upward thrust that has
almost no range, but it doesn’t
really matter all that much,
because the developers failed to
program anything fancy like
“competent hit detection“, so you
can execute crouching attacks and
hit enemies despite not actually
being next to them.
 
Boxes hold extra items, like
shurikens, machine guns (one of
the only true “cyber“ parts on your
ninja) and grenades, all in very
limited quantities and activated by
pressing the up button and attack.
The ninjitsu magic fills the screen
with gigantic, pixelated scrolling
text announcing the attack you are
using. You can actually stock up
to eight magic points (though each
use takes two of them), with the
higher levels offering more
powerful attacks.
 
The game looks and controls
terribly. The animation is choppy,
as is the scrolling. A full third of
the screen is taken up by an
oversized status bar. The
mechanics are clumsy, and the
best you can hope for is to get
near to a bad guy and mash the
attack button until they die, and
hope that maybe your sluggish
jumping is enough to dodge enemy
bullets. It’s not that terribly
difficult, although health items
only restore a single bar, and the
innocuous-seeming platforms that
collapse without warning
immediately grow tiresome.
 
The good aspects include the
enemy deaths, where they either
shrivel into nothingness or burn to
a crisp. Also, many of the bosses
are large vehicles that channel
some of the more memorable
battles in other game, like
bulldozers, helicopters and
submarines. But otherwise it’s a
wretched game, one of the worst
on the platform and undoubtedly
the lowest point in the whole
Shinobi series. It was only
officially released in PAL territories
(Europe, Australia and Brazil), so it
falls outside the larger canon of
the series.

The GG Shinobi (simply referred to
as Shinobi for American and
European releases) is a decent
miniaturization of the Shinobi
series, with gameplay similar to
The Revenge of Shinobi, but with
some new elements to make up
for the inferior tech. The graphics
are still excellent, and the
soundtrack features music from
Yuzo Koshiro, along with a few
chiptune renditions of songs from
The Revenge of Shinobi. Sega
didn’t cut any corners with regards
to presentation, as noted by the
impressive parallax scrolling
backgrounds in some stages.
 
Taking a hint from sentai
shows, The GG Shinobi lets you
play as a group of five ninjas, each
with a different colored uniform.
Each also has a unique weapon,
ninjitsu and skill. You begin with
only the sword-wielding Red Ninja,
whose magic can damage
everything on the screen, but you
choose your levels in a Mega Man
style stage select. There are five in
total: Highway, which has you
jumping between moving cars;
Harbor, with ships and crates;
Wood, which has you swinging
between trees; and Valley, with a
river running through it. Once
you’ve beaten the four main
stages, you can head to Neo City
for the final battle.
 
When you finish a level, you
rescue one of your compatriots
and can switch to them at any
time. Pink Ninja tosses bombs, can
freeze all enemies on the screen
and can climb on the ceiling;
Yellow Ninja attacks with energy
blasts, can walk on water and can
make himself invincible; Blue Ninja
has a grappling hook that can be
used to swing on certain pegs and
can turn himself into a tornado
allowing limited flight; and the
Green Ninja wields shurikens, can
double jump and has a suicide
attack much like the Mijin attack
from The Revenge of Shinobi.
Spreading out the abilities with the
ninjas makes this play somewhat
differently to its bigger brothers.
 
The ninja selection is a great
idea, and it really adds variety to
the gameplay. Unfortunately at the
start of the game, when you’ve
only got the Red Ninja with his
pathetically short attack against
enemies that take two or more
hits, the game can be very tough.
Your short life meter doesn’t help
either, as you can take between
two and four hits before biting the
dust. Other than the cramped
portable display, The GG Shinobi is
still quite enjoyable.

The Game Gear sequel pretty
much follows in its predecessor’s
footsteps, but refines some
elements to make it an even better
game. You’ve got to rescue the
same four ninjas, each with the
same abilities as before. There are
four stages here too – Castle,
Building, Canyon and Factory.
In addition there’s a crystal
hidden in each of the stages.
You’ll need to find all of these
crystals before advancing to the
final stage, but many require
special abilities to reach, meaning
you’ll go through some areas a
second time after rescuing your
uniquely attributed allies.
Bosses are spectacular; you
get to fight a giant armadillo that
shoots out the spikes on his back,
and of course rolls into a ball and
all across the screen, plus a giant
worm that bores out of the floor
and ceiling to attack you. The rest
of the game looks equally
excellent. While the predecessor
took the style of The Revenge of
Shinobi, here the backgrounds look
a bit closer to the later Shinobi III,
with a greater emphasis on
biological and mechanical designs.
The difficulty has been
adjusted – enemies take less hits
to kill, so the earlier stages of the
game aren’t as frustratingly
difficult. With the addition of a
password system, Shinobi II makes
for one of the best 8-bit portable
action games out there.

Shin Shinobi Den (“New Shinobi
Story“), also known as Shinobi
Legions in North America and
Shinobi X in Europe, is an early
Saturn release that uses digitized
graphics for all of the characters. It
was developed by a different team
to the Super Shinobi games.
Taking control of a new ninja
named Sho, the controls and
mechanics are very similar to
Shinobi III, although a little more
sluggish and clumsy.
For the first time there are
separate buttons to use a sword
and throw shurikens. Compared to
the other games there’s a far
bigger emphasis on swordplay,
since the shurikens are slow, even
more limited in number and fairly
weak – though you can now throw
them upwards. You’ll also spend
much more time blocking and
parrying enemy attacks. New
melee moves include a spinning
sword slash, a downward thrust
maneuver, and the ability to reflect
enemy projectiles back with your
sword, though this move is hard to
time effectively. The magic skills
have changed a bit too. The only
one you can store up and use at
any time is the Fire Dragon, which
attacks everything on the screen.
The POW icon has been replaced
with the Bushido Blade, which is
immediately activated and
summons gigantic shadowy
warrior statues every time you
slash. There are also glowing orbs,
which will grant an extra life when
you collect 10 of them. Boxes are
much rarer than before, as most
items are dropped by enemies.
Unfortunately they also drop
bombs, which are even more
numerous and annoying than they
usually are.
 
Even though the core
mechanics are familiar, there’s
something not quite right about
everything. Sho doesn’t control as
tightly as before, and has a
tendency to make extra
movements when executing sword
combos. While the level designs in
the previous Genesis Shinobi
games weren’t exactly the best,
they were at least competent –
here they’re just long and boring,
as each stage is only comprised of
a single elongated area, rather than
two or three smaller areas, before
the boss fight. Many areas are
similar to the ones seen in previous
games: medieval-style Japanese
towns, biological laboratories,
caves (complete with a mine cart
ride), forests, and so forth.
Bosses, meanwhile, are drearily
unremarkable. All in all, Shinobi
Legions can’t help but feel
somewhat uninspired.
 
The worst of it, though, is the
graphics. All of the sprites are
digitized actors in rather goofy
looking costumes. This was at
least a few years after Mortal
Kombat came around, so
theoretically this fascination with
live actor sprites should have worn
off, but apparently the designers

were still enamored with
characters that looked “like real
people“. Except that, in execution,
everything comes off as
remarkably silly, especially the
animation. The backgrounds look
photorealistic (albeit at a low
resolution), but realism is boring
compared to the near-futuristic
levels in the 16-bit titles. Forget
fearsome monsters and
mechanical robots – mostly you’re
fighting other ninjas, birds, and the
occasional supernatural creature,
like the big dinosaur thing, which
looks like a ridiculous toy model.
 
It’s bloodier than before and
it is cool to slice bad guys in half,
with a spurt of blood as their torso
falls off. If that wasn’t laughable
enough, after each level there’s an
FMV cutscene telling the story of
ninja Sho and his quest to rescue
his woman Aya. It’s unclear
whether the developers were
paying homage to cheesy
Saturday afternoon ninja serials, or
they just didn’t have a decent
budget, but this is a C-grade
production with cheap locations,
terrible acting, awful lighting and
some dated 1980s-styled
synthesized music. In the English
versions, the spoken dialogue is
left in Japanese and subtitled.
 
While not an outright terrible
game, Shinobi Legions looks
painfully dated, and the core game
is sloppy and uninspired.
Apparently Sega of America felt
the same way, and opted not to
publish it in America, instead
licensing it to Vic Tokai. Sega of
Europe did publish it in Europe, but
apparently wasn’t happy with the
soundtrack, which is fairly
standard, boring, and completely
unbefitting the Shinobi name. To
fix this, they pulled a situation
similar to what Sega of America
did with Sonic CD, where they
replaced the soundtrack with
music by a Western composer.
The new tunes are provided by
Richard Jacques, also known for
his work on Sonic 3D Blast for the
Saturn and Sonic R. While not
quite up to par with the Genesis
games, it’s still leaps and bounds
better than the Japanese /
American soundtrack, making it
the superior version overall.

Despite sharing a title with the
Genesis game, The Revenge of
Shinobi for the Game Boy Advance
is a totally different bag of
shurikens. Developed by an
American company called 3d6
Games, which also worked on the
GBA Altered Beast title before
going out of business, and
published by THQ, this hackjob
totally misses the point of the
Shinobi series.
 
Taking place in feudal Japan,
the story focuses on a ninja named
Shinobi. His master tells him the
story of a warlord named Ashira-o,
who was destroyed by five shogun
and sealed within five swords.
Those swords eventually corrupted
all of the shogun, each of which is
associated with an element: fire,
wind, water, earth and darkness.
As such, Shinobi must take them
all down.
By Any Other Name
Disregarding nearly every element
of the series that came before it,
the title could very easily have
been “Generic Ninja Action Game“,
and it both looks and feels like a
shoddy Amiga release.
 
In order to complete each of
the many sprawling, non-linear
levels, you need to explore the
stages while rummaging through
all of the nearly identical looking
houses and caverns, in order to
find keys or switches to open up
the exit. You end up doing far
more running around than actual
fighting or platforming.
 
The combat is basic and
shallow, and can be reduced to
two techniques: either slash
mindlessly, or slash, wait a
second, then slash again. It’s a
little sad that the enemy AI of a
1986 arcade game outshines that
of a 2002 portable game. In
addition to your sword, you can
chuck shurikens, but they are so
few in number as to be near
useless. Similarly, there are a
number of magic spells, each
associated with various elements,
but their use is also limited.
 
The animation is bad, the
scrolling is jarring, and the controls
are terrible. The mere act of
walking down steps is incredibly
difficult to execute on the GBA
pad. The background graphics are
colorful, if repetitive, but the
computer rendered sprites are
blurry, indistinct and ugly. The
music, which is comprised of
traditional Japanese instruments,
is a far stretch from the rest of the
series, but the sound quality is
decent for the system, at least.
 
The Revenge of Shinobi for
the Game Boy Advance isn’t
entirely unplayable, like The Cyber
Shinobi on the Sega Master
System is, but it is still shockingly
dull. Instead, try Hudson’s superior
Ninja Five-O on the GBA, which
does a far better job of capturing
the spirit of the series than this
sub-par product.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Shinobi, devoid of any numerals or
subtitles, finally hit the third
dimension with a PlayStation 2
release. Developed by Overworks,
it stars a new ninja named
Hotsuma, who has a wickedly cool
mask and a fancy red scarf that
drifts in the wind as you run.
There is plenty of time wasted on
the plot – something about evil
denizens coming from another
world – and there’s some brotherly
dramatics regarding Hotsuma’s
sibling Moritsune, but it all just
gets in the way of the action.
 
And it’s some damn good
action. This one of the smoothest
controlling 3D games ever made –
Hotsuma runs, jumps, and attacks
swiftly and gracefully, making the
mere act of moving around an
absolute joy. There’s a variety of
standard ninja moves at your
disposal, including the traditional
double jump, although you now
have the ability to grab onto
almost any wall and run across it,
completely giving the middle finger
to that nonsense theory of gravity.
Although you’ll do most of your
fighting with a sword, you have a
small arsenal of shurikens to stun
enemies, and some ninja magic to
use when needed. A handy lock-on
maneuver makes it easy to spot
any oncoming foes, although it’s
sometimes too easy to misdirect
your jumps when you’ve targeted
an enemy, usually ending with a
drop into a pit. Getting the hang of
the controls takes awhile – you
have to constantly use both analog
sticks, the shoulder buttons to
lock-on, and other buttons to dash,
jump and attack, but once you get
into the rhythm, simply playing the
game is like an acrobatic ballet for
your fingers.
 
One of the most important
elements to your victory is learning
how to “tate“ (pronounced in
Japanese like “tah-tay“, not “tate“
like “taters“). If you kill enemies
quickly and build up combos, your
sword gradually becomes more
powerful. It’s necessary to form
huge combos in order to bring
down many of the bosses, but it’s
also fun to do because it looks
badass – kill all of the enemies in
the area quickly enough, and
you’re granted a short cutscene of
Hotsuma posing before all of them,
in a frozen state of death, falling
apart and collapsing in a mess of
blood and otherworldly goo.
 
Of course, Shinobi is damn
hard. Not just “kind of“ difficult, or
“really“ difficult, but rather “face
punchingly“ difficult. The first two
stages are a breeze – then things
go awry when you face enemies
that block frontal attacks, most
notably some damn ninja dogs.
You’re also expected to make
some pretty crazy platforming
maneuvers in the later levels, and
one mistaken button press will
send you falling to your doom.
Additionally, there are no midlevel
checkpoints either, so dying means
starting each level – some of

which are approximately 10
minutes long – from scratch. You
do have unlimited lives, and the
game is generous enough to let
you restart at the beginning of
boss battles, but it’s still incredibly
tough. Also, since Hotsuma is
wielding a cursed blade named
Akujiki, it slowly sucks life away
from him unless he’s constantly
killing enemies, so dawdling will
result in a sad, pathetic death.
 
The bosses, like the rest of
the game, start off simple but
quickly ramp up in difficulty. In an
allusion to the original game, one
of the first bosses is a helicopter.
Later on you fight a blind ninja in a
pool of water – stay off the
ground or he’ll slash you to bits –
and a gigantic four-armed statue
that shoots lightning bolts and will
happily pound you into submission
if you’re not careful.
But worst of all is the final
boss, Hiroko, who floats in the air
out of your reach, and floods the
playing field with so many difficult
enemies that it’s nearly impossible
to get a tate combo to beat him.
He is one of the most infuriating
final bosses in history, and if you
can kill him, hats off to you. While
Shinobi was released first in
America, the later released
Japanese and European editions
included an easy difficulty setting,
although it doesn’t make too much
of a difference.
Tough Enough?
If you’re actually skilled enough to
play through the game multiple
times to find the hidden bonus
coins, and on harder difficulty
levels, you can unlock Hotsuma’s
brother (and nemesis) Moritsune
as a playable character. The older
sibling is stronger than Hotsuma,
but his life is drained even more
quickly. The final playable
character, the legendary Joe
Musashi, doesn’t suffer from a
cursed blade and thus playing as
him the game is much more
forgiving – though you can only
get him after finishing most of the
game with Hotsuma before. The
highest reward for finding all the
coins are additional missions in a
white “VR“ environment, which
just throws the most insane
combat and platforming challenges
at you. There’s also a gallery of
artwork and a cinema mode for
the FMV cutscenes.
 
It’s not just the difficulty that
turned so many people off the
PlayStation 2 update of Shinobi –
the graphics, while running at a
smooth frame rate, are rather
drab, and the level designs are
fairly boring, filled with the same
hallways and large rooms, all
pasted with the same textures.
The hyper-smooth action mostly
makes up for these flaws, but
many people found it to be a
rather plain yet infuriating game.
In spite of its many problems,
Shinobi has the foundations for
one of the best action games of
the PS2 era; a flawed but
underappreciated classic that’s
absolutely worth checking out.

The PS2 Shinobi was off-putting
to many people, but it found its
niche despite not being nearly as
popular as other action games like
Devil May Cry. Its sequel Kunoichi
(cryptically renamed Nightshade
for overseas release) features a
ninja chick named Hibana, clad in a
tight white-and-red sentai-style
outfit, with a cool mask a la
Hotsuma. She’s missing the
snazzy scarf and instead has a
long bandana that trails pink
shadows as she runs. Her goal is
to fight against the evil Nakatomi
Corporation, which has unleashed
demons across Tokyo to find the
shards of Akujiki, the sword from
the previous Shinobi game.
The gameplay has been given
a slight tune-up, fixing some of the
flaws of its predecessor but also
introducing new ones. Most of the
changes revolve around making it
substantially easier; there are
several difficulty levels to chose
from, including a “beginner control
method“ for newbies. There are
also now quite a few mid-level
checkpoints. These make dying
less of an annoyance, but the
stages feel disjointed as a result,
since the game is constantly
fading in and out to load. Since
Hibana does not wield Akujiki, her
health does not deplete like in the
previous game.
Tates are handled a little bit
different now – every time you
finish a combo (or grab power-
ups), a tate meter fills up with
energy. When filled sufficiently, it
allows Hibana to send out a
projectile image of herself, doing
lots of damage when following on
from a high combo. This makes
boss battles much less of a
headache than in the previous
game, as it’s much easier to tate
them. Also new is a jump kick
maneuver, which breaks down
enemy shields and allows for even
more crazy midair dashing action.
 
In spite of the improvements,
Nightshade still carries its fair
share of aggravations. With the
jump kick attack there’s even more
emphasis on floating above empty
space, and thus more opportunities
to fall into pits. The graphics are
still dull and repetitive, arguably
looking worse in spots. And while
the level design has improved,
most areas still consist of the
Nightshade

same tunnels and open rooms as
before. There are a few levels that
take place on vehicles, maintaining
a Shinobi tradition. In the first
stage Hibana rides on top of a jet,
flying through a cityscape while
attacking enemies and deflecting
missiles. And while it’s kinda cool
to jump from boat to boat as
they’re being sunk by torpedoes,
these stages last far too long and
lack any checkpoints.
 
It features even more
unlockables than Shinobi did.
There are now four playable
characters; the first to unlock is
Hisui, another lady ninja and
Hibana’s rival in the story mode,
who fights with an umbrella.
Furthermore, Hotsuma and Joe
Musashi make their return, both
with their individual strengths and
weaknesses from the former
game. The girls also get several
different costumes.
Nightshade is definitely a
more refined game, but it still feels
low budget. The edges that
needed to be smoothed out are
still pretty jagged. Also,
Nightshade came out just a few
weeks before Tecmo’s 3D Ninja
Gaiden for the Xbox, which
trounced it in pretty much every
way. In spite of this schooling,
Nightshade is still rather decent.
 
While you can’t tell from the
in-game screenshots, Hibana’s
character design seems inspired
by Chiaki Kuriyama, most well
known for her role of schoolgirl
Go Go Yubari in Kill Bill Vol. 1, but
also acting in other famous
Japanese movies such as Battle
Royale and Shikoku.

Shinobi 2
AKA: Meiying Renzhe: Yanpiao
Xiang (CH)
Original Release: 2011
Platforms: MOB
The world of Chinese cell phone
games is a curious one, filled with
offshoots of popular properties,
both legitimate and bootlegged.
Shinobi 2 is an officially licensed
Sega product, though its ties to
the Shinobi series proper are
tenuous. The title indicates that
this is probably meant to be the
sequel to the mobile port of the
arcade game released a few years
prior, though it is a wholly original
game. The Chinese title is Meiying
Renzhe: Yanpiao Xiang, which
translates to “Phantom Ninja:
Flame Fragrance“.
 
The game stars a female ninja
named Honoka, both a member of
the Oboro Ninja clan and a CIA
agent. Her mask is a little more
revealing than Hibana’s. Her main
weapon includes three swords
with different abilities: fire, ice,
and poison. Each enemy is also
associated with a different colored
symbol. If they are killed with the
matching sword color, they’ll drop
orbs to strengthen that weapon.
Although Honoka does not wield
shurikens, the swords have
projectile attacks, and she also
brings out a gun for when she’s
hanging on ledges. She can also
run straight up walls and bounce
back and forth, though these
abilities are rarely tested.
 
Some levels simply require
that you get to the exit, others
feature certain tasks, like obtaining
a certain number of key cards,
finding objects to unlock doors, or
just killing all of the enemies. A
few stages are simple shooting
segments, where you control
Honoka on a glider. Every few
stages there are also bonus levels
where Honoka automatically runs
forward, and you must press
colored buttons to defeat
oncoming bad guys.
Not Really Shinobi
In spite of the setting and general
theme, the game doesn’t play like
any of the other Shinobi games,
and feels more like a generic
action-platformer. The graphical
style is much brighter and more
manga influenced than the
previous games. The pixel artwork
is generally attractive, though the
quality of the animation is
inconsistent. The game’s music is
also negligible.
 
As typical of most mobile
titles, the game falters with its
controls. The hit detection never
feels right, and enemies take far
too many hits to kill. Even though
you can double jump, it’s still
difficult to land on platforms,
which is troublesome considering
that you take damage from long
falls. A few areas take place on a
moving train, and the physics
make absolutely no sense.
Shinobi 2 is not particularly
good but, like most of these
obscure Chinese offshoots, it is
amusing for fans purely from a
trivia standpoint.

Shinobi
AKA: Shinobi 3D (JP)
Original Release: 2011
Platforms: 3DS
Seven years after the last proper
installment on the PS2, Shinobi
returned in 2011 on the 3DS. In
Japan appropriately titled
Shinobi 3D, Sega’s Western
divisions apparently decided to
compete with Ninja Gaiden in
naming confusion, so it’s now the
fourth game in the series that’s
just called Shinobi (after the
original, the first Game Gear game
and the PS2 release). This entry
was outsourced to American
company Griptonite, mostly known
for licensed titles on various
handhelds and download services.
Griptonite decided to use
Shinobi III as their role model.
Aside from similar gameplay, you’ll
also see a lot of enemies and
set-pieces taken from both Super
Shinobi games. Like those two,
the new Shinobi opens with a
stage seemingly set in feudal
Japan, before it switches to more
futuristic stuff; only this time, it’s
really set in the 13th century, and
Jiro Musashi is then teleported
through time into the future for
unknown reasons.
Longtime fans will feel right
at home from the start, as all the
abilities from Shinobi III are back.
Walking / running is now
conveniently executed with the
analog nub instead of double-
tapping, making the game feel
faster paced.
There are separate buttons for
the sword and shurikens, and the
throwing daggers are now drawn
from an infinite pool, although Jiro
can only throw five at a time.
Afterwards they recharge slowly,
making their use tactical rather
than a question of resource
management. The four ninja magic
techniques add additional shuriken-
strengthening traits; the suicide
bomb has been replaced by
temporary invincibility and super
strength, which leaves the hero
with just one speck of health.
But Jiro also has a couple of
entirely new tricks up his sleeve,
like a grappling hook that can be
shot straight upward to cling onto
ceilings, and he can also slide to
pass under low passages (unlike
Joe Musashi, Jiro can’t walk in a
crouched position). The rest of the
abilities are all related to sword
fighting: the right shoulder button
can be used to deflect attacks
(similar to Shinobi Legions),
although the timing has to be spot-
on. When an enemy is unaware of
his presence, Jiro can take him out
silently, Tenchu-style. Finally,
melee attacks are now chained
into strings of combos, and there
are several new moves, like a
sliding attack, a slash that lifts
enemies into the air, and a guard-
breaking charge attack.
But don’t worry, Shinobi
doesn’t turn into a Devil May Cry
combo fest. The basic enemies still
go down with a single stroke and
even tougher ones don’t last long
either, but they can be juggled
further to maximize scoring.
62

Blocking an entire machine gun
salve with your sword and then
destroying your foe with a fluid
counterattack just feels great, and
when things go wrong you’ll
always know it’s your fault.
 
The system to determine your
score is quite elaborate. Striking
and killing enemies will grant
points, of course. Blocking attacks
will also raise the score, but
getting hit is punished with a
deduction. A special meter can be
built up with combos for even
higher scores. Each additional level
raises the score multiplier and
makes Jiro’s weapon glow
brighter, but take one hit and it all
goes back to zero immediately.
Finally, at the end of each stage
you are penalized for running over
the par time or using magic.
Faithful Successor
What makes the new Shinobi a
worthy follow-up to the classics is
the brilliant stage design. The once
again awesome bosses range from
old favorites like the helicopter, to
a huge robotic shark. The only
downside is that the levels do tend
to be a bit on the long side. Unlike
the previous games this one is
saved after each stage, and you
also get unlimited credits.
However, lose your last life in the
boss fight and you’re tossed back
the beginning of the stage –
unless you’re playing on the
easiest of the four difficulty levels,
which not only makes the enemies
weaker but also grants unlimited
lives. “Hard“ and especially “Very
Hard“, on the other hand, make
even the original games look like
child’s play.
Griptonite even brought back
the cool shuriken shooting-range
bonus stage from the 1987
classic, although it’s a bit easier to
win here. Only the parts where
Jiro rides various vehicles in an
angled perspective are a bit dull,
but nowhere near as long or
boring as in Nightshade. In a
desperate attempt to use more
functions of the 3DS hardware,
the surfing sequence is controlled
by tilting the handheld. By far the
best is the ride on the After Burner
jet, if only for the awesome use of
that game’s theme music.
Otherwise the music consists
of a much more usual modern
action-game rock / techno
soundtrack, ditching the jazzy vibe
of Shinobi III and the many
different styles from Revenge.
Composed by Norihiko Hibino,
mostly known for his work on the
Metal Gear Solid games, it
contains plenty of “oriental style“
melodies and Chinese flutes,
straight out of martial arts movies.
 
Unfortunately, the 3D is
simply not very good. There is no
angle you can hold the 3DS at to
prevent some object creating faint
duplicate images, and most of the
time one of those is Jiro himself.
In 2D the game looks decent
despite PSOne-era detail levels,
and every area has a particularly
dominant color. So you’ve got
orange stages and blue stages and
white stages, but when a stage is
orange, it’s very orange.
 
The main adventure is only
about as long as Shinobi III, but
Griptonite packed their game with
a ton of replay value, and then
some. Besides the excellent
scoring system, there are dozens
of “achievements“, which unlock
a variety of different extras.
There’s the obligatory artwork and
movie galleries, as well as a music
test, with every single item hidden
behind requirements ranging from
“complete level X“ to “beat the
final boss without taking any
damage“. A neat little extra is the
“history“ menu, which spills trivia
about all the previous games. But
you also get different costumes
and weapon replacements
(including a golden axe, a
chainsaw and a chicken!), and
even cheats for Jiro. All beaten
levels can thankfully be selected
separately to hunt for missed
achievements and higher scores.
 
There are few other classic
game re-imaginings that do such a
great job at modernizing a
franchise while still capturing the
original’s spirit as effectively as
the 3DS Shinobi. It plays in the
same league as Bionic Commando
Rearmed and Contra 4.

Altered Beast – or Jyuuouki
(“Chronicles of the Beast King“ in
Japan) – is something of a Sega
classic, owing mostly to being the
original pack-in for the Genesis.
Ironically the game is one of their
weaker titles, though given the
strength of its visuals, it’s easy to
see why Sega picked it as a
demonstration of the 16-bit
console’s power. The game was
directed by Makoto Uchida and
developed by Team Shinobi, who
worked on several other Sega
brawler games, including Golden
Axe and Alien Storm.
 
At the beginning of Altered
Beast the Greek god Zeus
resurrects a fallen warrior and
commands him to travel through
the underworld – it seems Zeus'
daughter Athena needs rescuing
from the evil lord Neff (why they
chose to make up their own Greek-
like god rather than using Hades is
unclear). It’s up to you, and
potentially a friend in two-player
simultaneous mode, to bash your
way through hordes of demons,
wolves and monsters.
 
The game is basically a
beat-em-up, though unlike Double
Dragon or the later Golden Axe,
the action only takes place on a
single plane. The screen slowly
autoscrolls as enemies lumber
forth, whom you can dismantle
piece-by-piece by smashing them
with your gigantic fists.
 
Throughout the game you’ll
see white wolves, which drop
power orbs when killed. When you
get one you’ll bulk up slightly, an
omniscient voice will announce
“POWER UP“, and your punches
and kicks will be a bit more
powerful. Grab another orb and
your muscles will bulge even
further, completely tearing your
shirt. Get a third and you’re
treated to a thoroughly impressive
full screen transformation
sequence of your human turning
into their beast form.
The Beast Within
Each of the five levels features a
different monster. The Wolf can
throw fireballs and execute a cool
flaming jump kick. The Dragon can
fly, shoot lightning bolts from its
mouth, and surround itself with
blasts of electricity. The Bear
blows petrifying breath and does a
crazy spinning jumping roll. The
Tiger also has fireballs, as well as
a vertical jump kick. In the final
level, you turn into the Gold Wolf,
which is exactly the same as the
first transformation but a little bit
more powerful.
 
One of the most annoying
issues is that it’s far too easy to
let one of the white wolves slip
by, so you lose out on a power-up.
The first few times you run into
Neff, he’s polite enough to refuse
combat if you’re not transformed,
so you get to continue with the
stage for another cycle. If you
mess up too often though, he’ll

fight you anyway, which is a
recipe for guaranteed death if
you’re still a human.
The difficulty is also
incredibly high. Enemies approach
in droves and attack quickly, and
it’s far too easy to get surrounded
or bombarded by cheap hits.
There’s almost no invincibility time
after taking a blow either, which
just results in even more damage.
Your character is so huge that it’s
extremely difficult to dodge
attacks during boss battles
without getting hit. Unfortunately
Altered Beast was originally
designed as something of a credit
feeder, so when translated to the
home consoles, where you’re
given limited continues, it just
becomes obnoxious.
Long in the Tooth
Altered Beast hasn’t aged quite as
well as other Sega properties – it
really is all about the visuals. But
from a certain mindset, it’s still
rather impressive, because the
presentation is damn good.
Various body parts fly out of the
screen when you kill bad guys. Kill
a gargoyle, and its body falls to
the ground while its wings fly
back off into the sky. Kill a
Cyclops and its flesh literally falls
off. It’s almost humorously
grotesque, especially considering
there really isn’t any blood or
similar effects.
 
The voices – whether it be
the opening cry to “Rise from your
grave“ or the nefarious “Welcome
to your doom“ spoken before each
boss – are iconic. The monster
designs are also pretty awesome,
especially the early bosses, like
the huge demon who rips off his
heads and showers his screaming
visages down on the player, or the
plant-thing which attacks with its
innumerable eyes. The Chicken
Leg monsters, also known as
Chicken Stingers, show up in
Golden Axe too. Even though
Altered Beast is somewhat lacking
as a game, it maintains the joyous
excess of 1980s arcade titles
which made them so appealing.
 
Sega also had a weird thing
going on with the endings of some
of their arcade releases. In Altered
Beast, after the game shows you
all of the beast forms, it reveals
that everyone in the game are
merely actors “filming” a “movie”,
who all take off their costumes
and then share a drink.
The Genesis port is the
closest to the arcade version.
Some of the minor graphical
effects have been toned down,
particularly the scaling effects,
though parallax scrolling has been
added. In general it’s a bit easier,
though the music isn’t quite as
powerful. The wacky ending is
also gone. Otherwise it looks and
plays almost exactly the same.
This version is found on the Sega
Smash Pack Vol. 1 for the
Dreamcast, though it suffers from

some unfortunate sound
degradation. It is also available on
the Sega Genesis Collection for
the PS2 and PSP, and Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for the
PS3 and Xbox 360, all of which
feature near perfect emulation.
The arcade version is included as a
bonus, but you must reach a
certain score in the first level of
the Genesis version to unlock it.
 
The Sega Master System
version isn’t nearly as impressive
– it looks okay for the system, but
the movement is extremely
choppy, and there’s plenty of
flickering, resulting in a game
that’s practically unplayable. It’s
also missing a whole level.
Additionally, this and all other
console ports suffer because they
lack the proper number of buttons,
so you need to press up to jump,
which is lame.
 
The PC Engine port has
redrawn backgrounds that look
significantly worse, and ditches all
of the multi-plane scrolling.
Additionally, the controls
(especially the jumping) are less
responsive than before, making
the game considerably more
frustrating. A PC Engine CD
version was also released early in
the system’s life, but is quite a
cheap port job. There’s a new
intro, featuring a narration over
music from the arcade game. The
pictures are merely stills from the
game, combined with some
terribly grainy artwork, and it goes
on for several boring minutes. The
actual game is exactly the same
as the HuCard version – they
didn’t even bother to improve the
music. It’s also incompatible with
the System Card 2.0 and 3.0,
requiring the obsolete 1.0 card to
function properly.
 
The Famicom version was
produced by Asmik, as opposed to
Sunsoft, who handled most of the
Sega-to-Famicom ports. The game
looks awful, with tiny sprites and
ugly colors, but it’s smoother than
the Master System version, even
though the gameplay is still
atrocious. However, Asmik added
three whole new levels, with three
new beast forms (a lion, a shark
and a phoenix), along with some
cool new bosses that actually look
fairly decent. The ending in this
version is even stranger than the
arcade version. After the staff roll,
the curtain goes down, revealing
the screen to be in a movie theater
and… the beast and the princess
are in the audience? How meta.
Beast of a Computer
There are also a variety of
computer ports. The Amiga and
Atari ST versions, ported by
Software Studios, look and sound
the most faithful, although a
quarter of the screen is taken up
by a status bar, and the graphics
are quite dark. It’s also rather
choppy and the collision detection
is somewhat dodgy. The
Commodore 64 version, also
ported by the same company and
rather similar, starts off incredibly
cool, with an excellent replication
of the title screen and decent
rendition of the main theme. But
in-game it’s terrible, with sparse
enemies, regrettably awful
collision detection, and no music.
The PC version, ported by
Unlimited Software Inc, suffers
from low-color graphics even in
VGA mode. The main character
moves too quickly compared to
the enemies, and the animation is
laughable, but in spite of these
issues it plays acceptably. The
AdLib music conversion is okay,
though all of the voices are
obviously gone.
 
All of the above computer
ports pale next to the arcade or
Genesis ports, but they’re still
miles beyond the rest. The
Amstrad version looks okay, but
it’s impossibly slow, incredibly
choppy, and basically unplayable,
although the 8-bit chiptune
rendition of the music isn’t all that
bad. The ZX Spectrum version is
essentially identical play-wise, but
suffers from the usual brightly
miscolored graphics, while the

video game villains, Neff is

Sega entered into a devil’s pact
with THQ regarding their Game
Boy Advance games. A few of
their classic properties were given
to Western developers to “update“
them for the portable format.
 
The GBA version of The
Revenge of Shinobi turned out
nothing like the game it was based
on. Altered Beast: Guardian of the
Realms ended up a little bit better
– at least the developers, a small
company called 3d6 Games,
seemed to be familiar with the
original title, even including
recreations of many famous sound
clips. The result is a game that’s
maybe a little too close to its
source material.
 
Once again, you’re a fallen
soldier who’s been resurrected to
fight evil. This time a dark reaper
named Arcanon has stolen the
keys to “Realm Gates“ in an
attempt to command an undead
army to take over Olympus. The
gameplay is just like the arcade
version, except there are a couple
more power-ups to find, including
health restoratives, power waves,
earthquakes, and a strange item
that temporarily sets your
character ablaze.
Just Too Much
The biggest change – and ultimate
downfall – is that the levels are
way too long. Each stage feels like
it takes forever, with the same
repetitive scenery scrolling over
and over again, and there’s no
way to cut them short like the
arcade game. Plus, there are 15
stages altogether, though you can
save between them.
 
Admittedly, the backgrounds
are pretty cool, and the levels run
the gamut from Ancient Greece
and Egypt to a volcanic land,
underwater stage and some kind
of weird cosmic outerspace level.
Even so, it’s hard for the visuals to
have the same impact as the
arcade original when it’s running
on a tiny screen.
 
The same compliments can’t
be paid to the sprites, which all
have a crappy computer rendered
appearance to them. Many of the
monster forms look really bad,
although there are some
interesting transformations.
 
The returning forms have
been granted new names – the
werewolf is now Canis, the
dragon is now Draco, and the
tiger is now Smilodon. The new
ones include Naga, a serpent;
Terapis, a spiked turtle;
Carcharodon, a shark, borrowing
from the Famicom version
perhaps; Cerathos, a rhinoceros;
Avion, an eagle; Scorpios, a
scorpion; and Chimera, a chimera
of course. You can upgrade each
of these forms by replaying levels
to find special artifacts.
 
Overall, it’s far from being a
remarkable game, but it’s good,
cheap, stupid fun, as long as you
play it in spurts.

Project Altered Beast
Original Release: 2005
Platforms: PS2
Around 2003, Sega started re-
imagining many of their old arcade
games using 3D graphics, and
publishing them on the PS2. The
company decided that Altered
Beast was worthy of a new game,
and so it received a full blown
sequel. It also just so happens to
be one of the worst action games
on the system.
 
The story has moved from
ancient Greece to modern day
America, where a weird “genome
mist“ is polluting the air. Only you
can save the day – a “Genome-
Cyborg“ super soldier named Luke
Custer, who is able to morph into
all kinds of beasts using the power
of science. In the beginning you
can only turn into a werewolf
(with a dash attack and a spinning
jump). Later in the game you gain
the power of the merman, which
results in way too many tedious
underwater segments. In addition
there’s Wendigo, a glorified yeti;
Garuda, an eagle-like being said to
be the mount of Vishnu; Minotaur,
which is self explanatory; U.W.H.,
an alien or “Unidentified
Weightless Human“, that lets you
flip gravity; plus a Dragon, Grizzly,
and Weretiger.
 
When you’re in human form,
you’re practically defenseless, so
it’s in your best interest to keep
the green power meter up so you
can stay transformed. Luckily, the
energy it needs can be harvested
from every enemy, either by killing
them or jamming your fist into
their body and sucking the goo
out. This is all easier said than
done, because Project Altered
Beast has a terribly designed
brawling system. You can’t lock-
on to enemies, and the process of
merely hitting an enemy is far
more difficult than it should be.
Sure, you can upgrade your
monsters and gain more combos,
but you’re mostly just jamming
buttons and hoping they don’t
drain too much of your health.
Even the camera is nearly
impossible to tame.
Body Horror
The graphics are dark and murky,
and while they set the mood,
they’re still horrendously ugly. The
only semi-remarkable aspect of the
game is the overly grotesque
transformation scenes. Every time
you transform, you’re “treated“ to
a movie scene of your character’s
limbs twisting and his flesh falling
off, while his eyes burst and head
practically explodes, as the body
of the chosen beast takes him over
completely. In addition to this,
there’s an extreme amount of
violence, as blood flies and stains
itself on the screen – which,
combined with the English voice
acting, makes it seem like Project
Altered Beast was intended for a
Western audience. While it was
released in Japan and Europe,
someone sensible decided not to
bring the game to America.

The Golden Axe series was
created by Makoto Uchida (Altered
Beast, Dynamite Cop). It’s a
barbarian themed beat-em-up
that’s heavily inspired by the
Conan the Barbarian stories,
featuring buff warriors in tights
and Red Sonja-style warrior
goddesses in bikinis. The series is
also known for its fantastic
artwork which resembles classic
Conan the Barbarian and Frank
Frazetta work, though a lot of
other fantasy action games borrow
from these as well.
 
The whole series tells a tale
about a mythical weapon called
Golden Axe that can grant its user
great power (the Japanese
characters in the Golden Axe logo
roughly translate to “Battle Axe“ –
there’s a sword, a hammer, and an
axe hidden inside the stylized
kanji). The main antagonist is an
evil lord called Death Adder, a
towering monstrosity of a man
who wears a frightening mask just
to let the player know he’s evil. It
started as an arcade game, which
later spawned two sequels for the
Genesis, and another sequel for
the arcade. There are also several
spin-offs outside of the main
series, including two role-playing
games and a 2D fighter.
 
There are three characters to
play as: Ax Battler is a typical
super muscular barbarian, and an
all-round average fighter; Tyris
Flare is the bikini armor-clad
Amazon, the resident hot chick,
princess of the kingdom, and
fantastic magic user; and Gilius
Thunderhead is a dwarf. Despite
his diminutive stature he’s the
strongest, but has the weakest
magic power. Gilius Thunderhead’s
initial attack is also the slowest of
the three characters.
Busting Heads
The gameplay of Golden Axe is
fast paced and typical of most
beat-em-ups. There’s a single
attack button, a jump button, and
a magic button. Repeatedly hitting
an enemy using the attack button
will begin a combo that the player
can end by either throwing the
enemy away from them, or by
hitting them with the blunt end of
their weapon for extra damage.
It’s a particularly brutal animation
(for the time) that keeps the game
true to its barbarian inspiration.

the same time lets you attack
behind you. You can also dash
forward by double tapping the
joystick. Finally, if you run, jump,
and press attack at the peak of
your ascent you’ll do a downward
stab. This is very difficult to hit
anything with, but will kill most
non-boss enemies with a single
strike. The striking nature of the
animation is helped by the fact
that, unlike almost every other
beat-em-up you’ll find, enemy
bodies remain on the screen
forever after being defeated.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
 
Each level is also filled with
little gnomes, which drop magical
pots when they’re hit. Although
the type of magic depends on the
character, the number of pots you
have determines which level of
spell you can cast. All of them will
attack every enemy on the screen,
but the spell level will determine
how much damage it’ll do.
 
Naturally, the stronger the
spell, the cooler the effect. On a
low level, Tyris Flare will summon
flaming ghosts to wail around the
screen. At a higher level, she’ll
summon a dragon to breath fire on
everything. It’s a quick and easy
way to damage bosses, and keep
the crowds of enemies under
control. Between each level, a
bonus round is initiated, where
these same gnomes come and
steal your magic while you’re
camping for the night. You have
the opportunity to get back more
magic than you lost though, by
efficiently beating up the gnomes
for their trouble.
 
After these bonus rounds,
each new level begins with one of
the characters writing in a journal,
describing their adventure into the
lair of Death Adder. The game
world itself is pretty cool and
remarkably well developed – one
village is on the back of a giant
turtle, and at another point you
actually board the back of a
gigantic bird. The stages are filled
with various kinds of barbarians,
including a pair of fat bald-headed
dudes with hammers known as
the Bad Brothers. There are also
animated Ray Harryhausen-style
skeletons, who are some of the
toughest foes in the game.
 
Most beat-em-ups grant you
power-ups in the form of
weapons, effectively doubling your
strength. Since all of the players in
Golden Axe already have
weapons, the game goes one step
further and lets you ride on a
variety of beasts known as
Bizarrians. These include a
cockatrice-like creature (known as
“Chicken Leg“) that whips
enemies with its tail as well as
two different types of dragons.
The first breathes a fiery jet of
flame, the second type only
appears at the beginning of level
three and attacks by spitting a
fireball clear across the screen.

At the end of the game,
you’re also ranked via on obscure
scoring system. The easiest way
to obtain a high score, other than
reducing the number of deaths, is
by slaying an enemy, then
repeatedly killing them with magic
attacks before they hit the ground.
 
The color palette is a bit dull,
mostly consisting of brown,
shades of brown, and more
brown. That’s not to say it looks
bland though – the backgrounds
are well detailed, and the enemies
look pretty cool, even though
they’re limited in number.
The music is composed by
Tohru Nakabayashi (Thunder
Blade) and resembles Conan The
Barbarian in almost every way.
There are also a ton of cool,
cheesy digitized screams lifted
from movies like First Blood and
Conan. The most memorable one
is the “OH GAWD!“ sound clip
from when David Caruso’s
character is attacked in First
Blood. Compare this to Final Fight,
which just had generic grunts and
groans. The Japanese version has
blood dripping from the letters on
the “PLAYER SELECT“ menu, and
a brief demo where Ax Battler
decapitates an enemy and sends
his head flying towards the
screen, which were both removed
from overseas releases.
 
The arcade version has a
totally awesome ending: it begins
with the Golden Axe flying out of
Death Adder’s hands and then
landing in his gut, causing a
bloody shower. After releasing the
King and Queen the scene then
changes to the cast of Golden Axe
busting out of the arcade game
and into the real world. Such
strange endings were not out of
place in some of Sega’s older
arcade games – Altered Beast had
a similarly light-hearted finale.
System Ports
Far and away the best port was
released as part of the Sega
Vintage Collection in 2012, which
is an arcade perfect translation
with numerous graphics options
and tweaks, along with online
play. This version replaces the
earlier XBLA release, which
suffered from muddy upscaled and
filtered graphics.
 
The Genesis port is well
regarded. Everything is scaled
down (immediately noticeable is
that now the bodies disappear and
several voice samples are
missing), but its controls are very
close to the original. An extra final
level has also been added after
defeating Death Adder, which
culminates in a battle against an
extremely aggravating foe known
as Doom Bringer. In addition to
being far more powerful than any
previous boss, he also has two
(nearly) invincible skeletons
assisting him. Furthermore, every
time you get knocked down,
Doom Bringer performs one of
several magical attacks just as
powerful as your own.
 
Some parts are censored. The
intro where you see Alex die was
removed and replaced by the hero
explaining the story, while the
“Sega Beer Barn“ in Turtle Village
was also removed. The few
instances of blood were cut, and
the ending has been changed to
something significantly more
generic. It also adds a mode called
“The Duel“, where you either fight
through stages of increasingly
difficult groups of foes, or engage
another player in one-on-one
combat. This port is two-player
and was re-released on the
Genesis in a package called Sega
6 Pack. The Genesis port also
appears in emulated form on the
Windows and Dreamcast versions
of the Sega Smash Pack, on the
PS2 and PSP releases of the Sega
Genesis Collection, and on Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for the
PS3 and Xbox 360. The
Dreamcast port, like most of the
games on the disc, suffers from
terrible sound emulation.
Golden Axe was also released
on the Sega CD, in a compilation
that came packaged with the
original release of the unit. It’s
basically just like the Genesis
version, except most of the voice
samples have changed, and the
sound effect quality in general is
worse.  However, all of the music
is redbook audio that streams from
the disc, the only game on the
compilation to do so. Oddly
enough, this version is only single-
player even though the version of
Streets of Rage on the disc has
two-player support.

The Sega Master System
version is more or less a tragedy.
You can only play as Ax Battler,
renamed here as Tarik, though you
can choose to use the type of
magic attacks during the game.
Pretty much everything is pathetic
– it has ugly graphics, terribly
choppy animation, and awful
control. It also removes the two-
player option. It does have a new
intro and ending not found in any
other version, at least.
 
The PC Engine port is a
shame, and another disc full of
broken dreams and mediocrity
from the masters at Telenet. It’s
completely horrendous, and almost
as bad as the Master System
version – miscolored graphics, a
lack of background details, plus
awful animation and controls.
There are some poorly animated
cutscenes that introduce each
character’s backstory, along with
some terrible remixed tunes. It’s
only single-player too.
 
The WonderSwan Color
version is fairly reasonable, given
the limited hardware, but it’s more
difficult. Enemies only attack in
pairs but are much, much more
aggressive than in any other
version of the game. It has some
very colorful graphics and okay
sound. Many of the moves look
different cosmetically but are the
same from a gameplay standpoint.
You can still run (and therefore do
the running attack and running
jump attack), but you can now
only attack once in mid-air.
 
The home computer versions
are of varying quality. The
graphics on the Amstrad are
especially blocky and the
character animations are off too.
The Commodore 64 version does
have some excellent music
provided by Jeroen Tel. The IBM
PC version changes the health
icons into gems for some reason,
and also the character icons. The
Amiga and Atari ST versions have
excellent music and graphics that
are roughly on the same level as
the Genesis version.
Golden Axe was also released
on the Game Boy Advance as one
of three games on a Sega Smash
Pack compilation (along with
Sonic Spinball and Ecco the
Dolphin). This version is very
poorly coded, with muddy sound
and only two songs that alternate
from the start to the end. The hit
detection is also very inconsistent,
and the proportions for the
characters were changed to fit the
smaller screen, so it’s quite
cramped. It’s also missing two
player mode for the main game.
Golden Axe was also one of
the first games to be remade as
part of the Sega Ages line for the
PS2. The initial goal of this series
was to produce budget versions of
classic Sega games, but with 3D
graphics. The series received a lot
of flack in its early years, and
most of that is due to the Golden
Axe remake, which is a total
embarrassment. The character
models are terrible and the
backgrounds look worse than the
original game. Even if you don’t
mind the visuals, the game just
doesn’t feel right. Each sword
strike gives off a huge explosion,
which looks cool at first, but also
obscures the action. While being
able to attack vertically is nice,
the combos don’t feel right either.

Plus, the enemies are absurdly
stupid, often just walking around
aimlessly and giving you plenty of
time to damage them.
 
There are now cutscenes,
which mostly just show how ugly
the characters are, while replacing
the little drawn maps and journals
of the original. You still get magic
bottles from beating up thieves,
but you also regenerate magic
automatically by pounding on bad
guys. Enemies also have names
and life bars now, for all the good
that does. Many of the levels have
been expanded, but it mostly just
results in padded, pointlessly long
areas. There are nine levels in
total, with a few extra locations,
including a river area and a
basement underneath Death
Adder’s castle similar to the one in
the Genesis version, filled with
lava pits and teleporting
magicians. The only real plus to
this version is the arranged
soundtrack, which isn’t orchestral
quality, but still sounds fairly cool.

Golden Axe II was developed
solely for the Genesis, bypassing
any arcade release. It’s perhaps a
bit too much like the original in
practically all aspects. Gilius, Tyris
and Ax Battler are back this time
around, to defeat the evil Dark
Guld. The sprites are new, with
Tyris getting a revamped, slightly
less revealing outfit, and some of
the spell effects have been
modified too. Most of the enemies
are the same, though, with a few
additions and changes.
 
Some of the new enemies are
lizardmen, headless knights, and
other man-beasts. The little thieves
have been changed into midget
wizards, who drop spell books
instead of magic potions. The
backgrounds aren’t quite as
interesting as in the first game,
mostly castles and dungeons and
such, though the hall where you
fight Dark Guld is rather cool
looking. However, in general, the
visuals have improved a bit over
the Genesis port of the original
Golden Axe.
 
The movement and combos
are similar to the original, though
they feel a little quicker. The magic
works slightly differently too.
Instead of just blowing all your
spell books to cast whatever level
of magic they equate to, you hold
down the magic button. How long
you hold it down determines how
much power you use up and
therefore the level of the spell
which is activated. The difficulty is
quite easy compared to the first
arcade game; if you put this game
on hard, it approximately matches
up to the previous arcade release
on easy mode.
 
The music is composed by
Naofumi Hataya, who later went
on to more lighthearted fare with
Sonic the Hedgehog and Nights:
Into Dreams. “Ravaged City“, the
first level track, is fantastic, and in
general the soundtrack is catchier
than the original. The awesome
digitized screams are no longer as
cool, as most enemies perish with
the same pitiful “Ugh!“.
 
Overall, Golden Axe II is a
decent game, but it feels
uninspired and ultimately rather
redundant. Some new playable
characters, or at least some new
Bizarrians, would’ve made this a
more worthwhile endeavor.

Golden Axe: The Revenge of
Death Adder
Original Release: 1992
Platforms: ARC
Golden Axe: The Revenge of
Death Adder is undoubtedly the
pinnacle of the series. Released in
1992 in the arcades for Sega’s
System 32 hardware, it improves
on the original in every way, but
apparently was so good they
didn’t even try to port it, which is
truly disappointing.
 
The story is typical: Death
Adder has been revived, and he’s
again trying to enslave the world.
However, there are four
completely new playable
characters this time, allowing up
to four people to play together
simultaneously, depending on the
type of cabinet.
Heroes of the Axe
Stern Blade is essentially an Ax
Battler clone, who has fire magic
that incinerates foes. Little Trix is
an imp with a trident. He uses
some sort of plant magic that
makes trees grow. This is
awesome because it causes apples
to fall to the ground that refill your
life if you collect them.
Dora is a female centaur who
uses earth magic, and has the
lowest magic cost in the game.
Her attacks are faster than
everyone else’s too, except for
Trix, while doing almost as much
damage as Stern Blade. She’s
probably the best character to use
if you’re playing through the game
by yourself. Finally, Dora
somehow grows human legs for
the purpose of riding beasts and
pulling switches.
Goah is a giant who is ridden
by Gilius Thunderhead. Gilius
wields the magic of death and
entropy. Together they form the
most powerful character, both in
strength and magic, which more
than makes up for their low speed.
 
You can now switch
characters when you continue,
which is a very welcome addition.
There are tons of new enemies
too, which include tribal men,
giant squids, Grim Reaper type
enemies, death knights, and ogres.
The graphics and artwork are
fantastic, and completely blow any
other arcade competitors out of
the water. The characters are
huge, and everything is much more
detailed, due to the System 32
hardware. There are gorgeous
waterfalls, giant mushroom
forests, even some scaling effects
in certain segments of the game.
There are plenty of cool
animations for characters being
slain, staggered, and knocked
away, which gives the game a lot
of personality. The best is how
when fighting tree men, a well-
timed heavy strike will cause them
to immediately shatter, their
splinters flying into the screen.
There are quite a few changes
since the previous games. First of
all there are branching paths,
which increases the replay value.
There’s also a diverse variety of
rideable creatures which all control
76

Original Release:

a little bit differently. The two
highlights are a giant mantis that
snaps an enemy’s neck as a
finisher, and an undead dragon
that’s stunningly animated.
There’s another giant mantis that
breaths fire, and a scorpion that
creates an arc of electricity with
its claws.
 
One cool factor is that you
can use mini catapults and
ballistae, which can be mounted
on your rideable creatures and
fired while moving. You can also
destroy projectiles when they are
fired at you. Magic works
differently in this game, as instead
of having different levels, you
have just one awesome spell that
uses a pre-set number of potions.
However, you can collect many
more potions than this cap. When
certain character use their magic,
it cuts to an extremely ruthless
close-up of the faces of your
enemies being incinerated or
turned to stone.
Sharpening the Axe
The basic fighting mechanics are
the same with a few original
additions, such as a new kick
attack which stuns characters.
The awesome running jump
followed by a downwards stab
attack returns, except this time it
can be done even while riding a
beast. There are also crates to
smash that reveal power-ups, and
switches that can be used to free
captured slaves.
The hit detection has also
improved a great deal. Enemies
seem to deal a lot more damage
though, and can stun you with
almost every hit. This can be
frustrating, but thankfully the
game lets you continue as many
times as you want, as long as you
keep pumping in the credits.
The music is composed by
Masanori Takeuchi (After Burner
Climax) and Tomoyuki Kawamura
(Sega Rally 2) and is yet again
inspired by the Conan movies.
Still, despite the higher sound
quality, the overall soundtrack
lacks the punch of the original.
The sound effects are still cheesy
and the “Oh Gawd!!“ sound effect
is still present.
 
The game’s only flaw is that
it’s just too damn long. There are
only a handful of bosses that you
fight over and over again, and
while their palette changes each
time, they’re not even all that
different from each other. They all
utilize the same pattern, though
each has a unique move to
differentiate it from the others.
There’s one boss type that’s
especially interesting, an armored
scarecrow with a scythe, but even
his act gets old after a while.
Regardless, this is still one of
the best arcade beat-em-ups
made, and certainly shows Sega
at the top of their game. It’s
extremely unfortunate that Golden
Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder
has never been ported outside of
arcades and thus largely forgotten.
77

Golden Axe III
Original Release: 1993
Platforms: MD, PS2, PS3, X360,
PS3, WII, WIN, IOS
The third console Golden Axe is
largely considered to be a
disappointment. The biggest
reason is that gamers wanted a
home port of The Revenge of
Death Adder, and they got this
instead. It’s not a terrible game,
but it’s not quite up to par either.
 
Whereas Golden Axe II was
too similar to the original game,
Golden Axe III is too different.
Technically, Gilius Thunderhead is
the only returning hero yet again,
although you don’t play as him.
Instead, he sends a handful of new
characters into battle against the
forces of evil. Kain Grinder is this
game’s Ax Battler clone,
while Sarah Barn is a dancer out
for revenge. Braoude Cragger is
an impossibly strong man
descended from giants, while
Chronos “Evil“ Lait is a cursed
panther man. The antagonist is
the improbably named Damned
Hellstrike, who is also referred to
as the Prince of Darkness.
Not Quite Faithful
The biggest change is that Sega
changed the controls to make it
play like every other console beat-
em-up, instead of like Golden Axe.
The weapon ranges are shorter,
and it’s a bit faster and smoother,
but it’s also lacking in distinction.
 
The graphics are much more
washed out than any of the
previous Golden Axe games.
There’s better use of color, but the
artwork is less defined, giving it a
bit of a grainy feel. There’s some
very nice backgrounds, in concept,
but the overly bright colors kill the
detail and the atmosphere.
 
It has inherited some of the
better aspects from The Revenge
of Death Adder though, such as
the branching paths through the
game. Additionally, you can now
double jump, and each character
has two special moves.
The magic attacks are back to
the original Golden Axe method
wherein you get potions, and use
them to cast spells of a certain
level depending on how many
potions you have. You can now
dismount beasts at any time
instead of having to be hit off
them or completing a level. You
can also gain an extra life by
rescuing slaves scattered about
the levels.
 
The music is pretty amazing.
Songs like “Ancient Mound” and
“Ride the Whirlwind” sound like
they are for a different system.
The music was once again
supplied by Naofumi Hataya, along
with Tatsuyuki Maeda (Dragon
Force). The screams are similar to
the arcade version, but thanks to
the scratchy sound of the Genesis,
they’re not quite as good.
Golden Axe III only saw a
retail release in Japan. It was
translated and published briefly on
the Sega Channel in America,
although it later showed up on
assorted compilations.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Outside of the regular series of
beat-em-ups, Sega also released a
handful of Golden Axe spinoffs.
For the Game Gear, there’s Ax
Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe, a
strange action-RPG hybrid. The
opening text tells us that the gods
created the Golden Axe to bring
prosperity to the land, but all it
does is cause squabbles between
various factions, resulting in war
and death.
 
In order to stop this chaos, a
wise king locks the Golden Axe
away, hoping that no further evil
will come of it. Naturally, some
bad guys break in and steal the
axe anyway. Apparently, the only
person who can save the day is Ax
Battler, who you will remember as
one of the heroes from the original
arcade game. Except now he
resembles the sprite from Dragon
Quest and has a stupid looking
winged helmet. Other than the
name dropping and occasional
appearance of familiar enemies,
there’s little to tie this in with the
arcade game.
 
Much of the game rips from
Enix’s longstanding RPG series.
You walk around the overworld,
looking for towns and dungeons to
progress. It features the same
clunky tile-based movement and
awkward menu system, although
there’s no real equipment or
statistics to speak of. While
venturing across the land random
encounters will pop up, whisking
you to a side-view battle segment.
Here, Ax Battler grows to more
realistic proportions and needs to
take down a single foe. Although
all enemies take multiple strikes to
kill, receiving a single hit will end
the fight for you, removing some
of the life meter and denying you
any victory spoils.
 
There are no experience
points, but you do get magic
vases, which act as a form of
currency. You can find towns and
enter training centers, which will
teach you new skills for the
combat segments and dungeons –
the latter of which usually produce
some kind of item allowing
progress through the story. The
dungeons are also side-scrolling,
although they’re much longer than
a single screen and feature
multiple enemies at once. Plus,
you’re not kicked out immediately
when hit; lose all your life and
you’ll wake up at the local inn to
try again.
 
It’s a novel concept, but it
falls rather short, mostly because
the side-scrolling segments are so
crummy. The characters move
awkwardly and attack sluggishly,
with sometimes questionable hit
detection. Some of the enemies
pounce erratically, making it nearly
impossible to dodge their attacks.
The dungeon sections are worse,
playing out like an inferior version
of Rastan. And the music is
absolutely appalling. Sega gets
points for trying with this one, but
it’s far from ideal.
Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden
Axe
Original Release: 1991
Platforms: GG
79

Golden Axe Warrior is a shockingly
blatant clone of the original The
Legend of Zelda. The graphics are
all extremely similar, although the
expanded color palette makes for a
slightly better looking game. You’ll
fight similar monsters, enter
familiar dungeons, and solve the
same types of puzzles. There are
minor tweaks here and there, of
course. There are 10 dungeons in
total, and the first five must be
completed before the second half
of the map is opened up, allowing
access to the remaining five.
 The status screen is brought
up with Button 2, with attacking
mapped to Button 1. This is
annoying, since you need to
interrupt play to switch to a
secondary weapon, but it’s
preferable to hitting the Pause
Button on the SMS console itself.
You also no longer shoot laser
blades at full health – perhaps that
would have been going too far.
The music is similar in nature, and
quite catchy, although not quite as
heroically endearing.
Improving a Classic
There are now multiple save points
hidden around the overworld, in
addition to actual towns, inns,
shops, and people to talk to,
which is a nice step up from the
crazy hermits in Zelda. There’s a
separate magic meter, so spells
and other special attacks won’t
drain your money. Perhaps most
importantly, you also have an axe
with a wider attack range than
your sword, which can chop down
trees – much better than using a
candle to slowly burn everything in
sight. This really could be like an
alternate Zelda II that adhered
closer to the original.
Just like the subsequent Ax
Battler, there’s very little to tie this
with the Golden Axe series. You
play as some generic little warrior
who looks like a beefy dude on the
title screen, but more closely
resembles the protagonist from
Dragon Quest. You’ll run into
familiar faces in a few spots, like
Gilius Thunderhead (misspelled
here as “Gillian“), who grants you
his thunder magic if you give up a
certain item. These events feature
the classic Golden Axe theme,
which is a nice touch. But other
than the appearance of a handful
of familiar enemies, like some of
the Bizarrians and those huge bald
guys who were prevalent in the
original Golden Axe, these
connections are very loose.
 
Still, it ranks next to Power
Strike II and Ninja Gaiden as one
of the best later SMS releases –
like these, it only received a retail
release in PAL territories, with
limited release in North America –
and it’s worth checking out
despite its shamelessness. The
game shows up as an unlockable
on Sonic’s Ultimate Genesis
Collection on Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
With the looming release of the
32-bit Saturn, Sega fans were
expecting a new Golden Axe game
with even better graphics, or at
least a port of The Revenge of
Death Adder. Instead, Sega
released Golden Axe: The Duel, a
2D versus fighter featuring some
of the characters and themes from
the earlier beat-em-ups.
  
The character selection is an
odd one. You don’t actually get to
play as the protagonists from the
old Golden Axe game, instead you
get to play as their relatives or one
of their descendents.
The hero is ostensibly Kain
Blade, a standard barbarian and a
descendent of Stern Blade from
The Revenge of Death Adder.
Meanwhile, Milan Flare is a female
warrior who’s the relative of Tyris
Flare from the first Golden Axe.
And Gilius Rockhead is an axe-
wielding dwarf who comes from
the same tribe as Gilius
Thunderhead from the original.
The rest of the cast is
generally rather boring too. Zoma
is a creepy green-skinned wizard,
and Keel is a wizard thief who kills
passersby when they come near
the land where he lives. Jamm is a
girl who was apparently raised in
the wilderness by a beast spirit,
and attacks with her giant claws.
Green is the last of a race that’s
part plant and animal, and plays
like your typical heavyweight.
Panchos is an inventor who is
looking for the Golden Axe for
unexplained reasons. He is a
typical heavyweight and fights
with bombs, and seems to be
vaguely patterned after the
laughing bald fat dudes from the
first Golden Axe. Finally Doc is a
ninja with a katana, who otherwise
seems a little out of place
compared to the rest of the
barbarian tropes.
 
The coolest aspect is the
chance to play as Death Adder.
He’s bad and he’s back as one of
the better characters, mostly due
to the long range of his axe. He
also has a fire breathing shield
which will shatter if it takes too
many hits.
 
The action is fairly typical of
versus fighters and it uses a six
button setup similar to Street
Fighter II. This being a weapons-
based fighter, one might be apt to
compare it to Samurai Shodown,
especially since it uses a similar
zooming camera. But it’s actually
pretty fast paced, and it’s much
closer to being “Street Fighter
Alpha with swords“. The gimmick
here is that thieves periodically run
around the arena, much like the
older games. Hitting thieves will
cause them to drop magic potions
– once your magic meter is maxed
out, you can enter a “super“
mode, buffing your strength and
allowing you to execute your
character’s special move for a
limited amount of time. Contrary
to their name, these moves aren’t
actually anything special and pale

when compared to the awesome
screen-clearing magic spells of the
older games. Little green dwarves
will also produce legs of meat,
which will heal you a bit. The
computer AI for the single-player
mode is unfortunately quite
obnoxious, even on the easiest
difficulty setting.
 
The art is brighter than the
previous games, and looks like a
cross between Conan and anime.
The backgrounds occasionally
have some interesting details –
Gilius’ stage has singing dwarfs,
Panchos’ stage has a robot that is
ironing some clothes, and Doc’s
stage has one of those bird-like
Bizarrians in the background. The
music is generally pretty awful and
completely forgettable, while the
announcer sounds like Sega hired
the same lousy voiceover guy
from Super Street Fighter II.
 
Overall, it’s not a complete
disaster – it’s just that it was
designed like Street Fighter II or
Power Instinct, when at the time
people wanted something more. It
didn’t help that it’s completely
generic compared to the harder
hitters from SNK and Capcom.
Furthermore, it alienated Golden
Axe fans, who just wanted
another beat-em-up, so it pleased
no one and failed big time. As
such, it’s often regarded as Sega’s
short-sighted attempt to cash in
on the Street Fighter craze using a
classic property.
 
Given that the arcade version
ran on the ST-V hardware, the
Saturn version is, for all intents
and purposes, identical. There are
some load times but it has
enhanced music – pretty typical of
Saturn releases. It was also one of
the few titles that received a
domestic release in North America
before the Saturn died. Just note
that it doesn’t work at all with the
analog controller – it won’t even
boot up.

Golden Axe: Beast Rider
Original Release: 2008
Platforms: 360, PS3
In 2008 Sega resurrected the
Golden Axe license for the
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
giving it to developer Secret Level.
Their track record was not great,
given that they created the
ghastly-but-bestselling Iron Man
movie tie-in game, and fans
panicked that yet another Western
developer would screw up a
classic Japanese franchise.
 
As it turns out, their fears
were not unfounded. Golden Axe:
Beast Rider is a sub-par hack-and-
slash sharing only the most basic
of elements with its predecessors.
The biggest disappointment is a
complete lack of cooperative play.
The second biggest disappoint-
ment is that only Tyris Flare is
available as a playable character,
though the others take part in the
story. Gilius Thunderhead (whose
best line of dialogue is: “By my
balls, girl, I thought you were
dead!“) and Ax Battler (officially
named “Tarik“, perhaps in a nod to
the Master System conversion) are
only present in cutscenes.
 
Other elements from the 16-
bit games are also present. Death
Adder is the penultimate foe, and
many of the enemies are similar to
the old games. The gnomes also
appear in certain areas, giving up
magic and meat when attacked,
but also poison in later segments.
Enemies also turn stone grey after
being slain, although they
disappear shortly thereafter. The
classic “coin insert“ sound effect
even shows up. But outside of
these references, and some vague
attempts to weave together the
storylines of the previous games –
the main goal is to assemble the
broken Golden Axe – the
connections to the older games are
fairly sparse.
 
The game is divided into
several chapters, most of which
are subdivided into several
“challenges“, which act as
checkpoints. As expected, the
side-scrolling viewpoint has been
replaced with fully 3D action,
putting it more in line with
contemporary games. But unlike
conceptually similar titles such as
Devil May Cry and God of War,
which use fixed camera angles,
Beast Rider primarily relies on a
user-controlled camera, which
never quite feels right. This is a
problem because there’s no ability
to lock on to foes. Tyris simply
chooses a nearby enemy and
attempts to follow it, although
even this is clumsily implemented.
 
The fighting is fairly simple: in
addition to weak and strong
attacks, there is a “knock back“
attack executed by pressing both
buttons. The strikes lack impact,
and everything just feels flimsy.
There are approximately a dozen
weapons, each of which acts the
same way but has different
properties. These are unlocked by
finding “tribute“ throughout the
stages. In addition to Death
Adder’s weapon, dubbed the
83

“Death Reaver“, you can also
obtain the Golden Axe itself in the
later stages of the game.
However, your weapon can only
be switched between the levels.
You also unlock various costumes
for Tyris, including the classic
red/white bikini get-up.
 
The only decent aspect of the
combat is the block/parry system.
Most enemy attacks give off a
faint glow. Orange attacks can be
parried with L1/LB, while blue
attacks can be blocked with
R1/RB. Green attacks can be
either parried or blocked. After
defending against an attack, you
can counterattack with a powerful
blow. This allows for a strong
defensive game, one that’s
actually rather fun when it works.
However, it can also be chaotic,
especially when you’re stuck in a
huge crowd. The window for
blocking is also way too short,
making it hard to execute
effectively, particularly when your
view is hindered by other enemies.
 
As the title suggests, a big
focus is placed on the variety of
beasts you can ride. These include
dragons and other steeds similar
to the Bizarrians from the arcade
game. Sadly, the famous bird
beast Chicken Leg is missing, and
its supposed equivalent looks
almost nothing like it. Some
beasts are found being ridden by
enemies, and others spawn at
summon points, which can be
revisited at any time. There are
only five types, although each has
special powers. One can, for
example, breathe fire, while others
can turn invisible. The problem is,
all of the cool attacks drain the
beasts’ health, so you really can’t
use them too often. And while it’s
fun to run around and stampede
over enemies, trying to control
them in close quarters combat is
incredibly awkward.
 
While Beast Rider has some
excellent concept artwork, very
little of it transfers well into the
actual game. The character
models are alright, but Tyris’
running animation is a bit off. The
environments look good from a
distance, but the level design is
dull. The backgrounds not only
lack detail, but repeat themselves
over and over. Despite this low
quality, the game struggles to
keep up 60 frames per second. It
is, however, far gorier than the
original games ever were.
 
The original arcade game had
some incredibly stirring music
given the tinny FM synth, and it
would’ve been awesome to see it
given the full orchestral treatment.
Instead, we’re given boring
background music. The arcade
game had some of the best sound
effects in a beat-em-up, from the
head clunks to the wailing
screams. Here, everything is dry
and unmemorable. Although there
are two fire-based magic spells
(and one ability to summon the
Golden Axe and chuck it around),
they completely pale compared to
the amazing graphical effects in
the days of old. Forget the flame
demons and fire-breathing dragons
from before – here, you just shoot
some fire around yourself.
 
But most importantly, wailing
on bad guys and knocking their
skulls in was straightforward but
enjoyable fun. Golden Axe: Beast
Rider can’t even handle that
properly. It’s even outclassed by
second string action games like
Conan and Heavenly Sword,
although, to be fair, it’s a bit
better than the PS2 Altered Beast
revival, which is damning it with
faint praise. The game also hints
at a sequel, but after the abysmal
performance of this title, it’s
highly unlikely.

Golden Axe Myth
Original Release: 2011
Platforms: WIN
Developed by a small team of fans
from Argentina, Golden Axe Myth
is a fan-made prequel runs on the
open-source Beats of Rage engine,
the foundation of many homebrew
beat-em-ups. There have been
other fan-made Golden Axe games
using the engine, but this is the
only one to feature totally original
art. In addition to the usual three
heroes from the arcade game, you
can also play as Death Adder,
before his transformation. He’s
slow, wields a huge mace, and
casts dark magic.
 
There’s quite a lot of content
here – there are brief story scenes,
branching paths, bonus unlockable
characters and hidden areas. In
addition to magic jars, you can
also obtain symbols to increase
your strength or defense, and
money to purchase items in the
few areas that have shops.
The mechanics have been
expanded to allow vertical rolls,
blocking, and additional special
movies. After beating up enough
enemies, you can also activate
“Rage Mode“, which increases
your damage.
Maybe it has something to do
with the huge range of your
attacks, or the cheesy blood
splatters, or just the way the
enemies react, but the gameplay
doesn’t feel much like Golden Axe.
This is hardly a huge sin,
considering Golden Axe III didn’t
even feel much like Golden Axe,
but it’s a constant reminder that
this was built using a general
purpose beat-em-up tool.
The visuals more closely
resemble a late SNK release, like
The King of Fighters, rather than
the original arcade games. They’re
much brighter and draw more from
manga than Conan the Barbarian,
even more so than Golden Axe
The Duel – who knew Death
Adder was secretly a long haired
bishounen? The music mostly
consists of remixes of old songs,
many of which are decent, though
their modern sound doesn’t quite
instill the same atmosphere as the
original games.
Due to the change in style
and mechanics, Golden Axe Myth
definitely feels like a fan game.
Still, a decent effort.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Fantasy Zone
Original Release: 1986
Platforms: ARC, SMS, MSX,
NES, MZ, TG16, SAT, WIN,
X68, PS2, MOB, PS3, 360, WII
A substantial number of Japanese
arcade games owe tremendous
debt to their Western forebears.
Sega’s Fantasy Zone, released in
1986 for the Sega System 16
board, is heavily inspired by
Eugene Jarvis’ Defender, although
it provides a unique Japanese take
on the formula, one which not only
refines the controls and
mechanics, but adds a thick layer
of overtly pastel cuteness.
 
The hero of the Fantasy Zone
series is Opa-Opa, a rotund egg-
shaped ship that appears to be
sentient. He has a pair of wings
for flying, and sprouts feet when
necessary. Opa-Opa’s design
shares a lot with Konami’s
Twinbee, and both series helped
define the subgenre affectionately
known as the “cute-em-up“.
 
Unlike many side-scrolling
shooters with auto-scrolling, Opa-
Opa can fly in any direction, and
the stages loop horizontally. The
goal is to fly back and forth
destroying all the enemy
generators. Once you do, you’ll
fight some huge boss character,
then move on to the next stage.
There are eight levels in total, each
with adorably cutesy names:
Plaleaf, Tabas, La Dune,
Dolimicca, Polaria, Mockstar,
Pocarius, and Salfar. The final
stage is a boss rush, which
culminates in the battle against the
final enemy.
 
The controls are initially a bit
tricky to get the hang of, since
your ship has a sense of inertia
and continues to move even after
you take your hand off the
joystick. The camera often has
trouble keeping up, making it
difficult to see what’s in front of
you. Once you get over this initial
hurdle, Fantasy Zone becomes an
absolute blast to play.
Rather than simply collecting
power-ups like most shooters,
Fantasy Zone lets you buy them.
Opa-Opa initially only has a simple
twin gun and bombs, which are
lobbed at a low arc. Every bad guy
drops coins when defeated, which
can be used at a shop, accessed
by flying into a large red balloon.
Inside, you can purchase wings
and engines (speed ups), an
assortment of lasers and spread
guns, more powerful bombs, and
even extra lives.
The primary weapons have
time limits, after which they
disappear, while certain bombs,
like the 16-ton weights, can only
be used a single time. However,
the special bombs are activated
with the regular bomb button, so
they replace other bombs until it’s
used. You’ll also lose all of your
equipped items when you die,
which is a huge pain when fighting
bosses, since you can’t re-equip
yourself after perishing, leaving
you underpowered.
There’s a lot of economic
strategy that comes into this. You
can buy the fastest engine so you
can swipe up all of the coins
86

dropped by bosses, but doing so
will often make the boss battle
more difficult, since your super
fast speed makes it hard to dodge
with precision the many projectiles
spewed out. It’s actually a good
idea to buy multiple weapons –
once you run out of one, a little
“Select“ balloon will pop out,
allowing you to switch to another
weapon. It’s also handy for a
breather, since the later stages
can become filled with enemies
and their numerous projectiles.
Furthermore, each time you
buy something, the price of the
item increases for the next time.
This means you can either blow
your money on weapons all
throughout the game to make
everything easier, or save up your
cash for the final stages, in case
you need it to buy extra lives.
You’ll want to do this, because
there’s no way to continue.
 
Beyond its unique mechanics,
Fantasy Zone creates one of the
most beautiful game worlds ever
known. Its levels are filled with
green meadows, shining rainbows,
bright waterfalls, and enemies
with big goofy grins that only
seem slightly annoyed when you
pelt them out of existence with
your laser guns. Its huge boss
characters possess their own
strange looks and personalities.
The first boss is a giant block of
wood that vomits leaves; the
second can only be described as a
frowning yellow gourd,
surrounded by orbs, which pops
out deadly sprouts from its top.
Later enemies include a legion of
deadly snowmen and a maliciously
grinning brick which disassembles
and reassembles itself around the
screen. At the end, the final
enemy is revealed to be Opa-
Opa’s father, a strange tragic
twist in the otherwise impossibly
peppy game world.
 
The music, reflecting the
colorful visuals, is a selection of
warm, bouncy tracks with a
distinctive Latin flavor.
Aesthetically, it’s almost
impossible to play Fantasy Zone
without feeling a sense of
incredible happiness, which
ironically contrasts against its
rather high difficulty.
Fantasy Zone was quite
popular in Japan, though never
quite garnered the same amount
of respect overseas, with its bright
colors perhaps being too off-
putting. The regional versions are
practically identical – the intro and
ending text is in English in both
releases – though the overseas
release has a different arrange-
ment of the song “Hot Snow“.
System Ports
The Master System port can’t
quite match the arcade graphics,
since it can only handle 32 colors,
rather than the 256 colors of the
arcade version. The parallax
background scrolling is gone, as is
the in-game radar, plus the music
is converted poorly. And yet, it
captures the gameplay fairly well.
Some of the bosses were too
much for the machine to handle;
two of them are changed
completely, including the gigantic
fish and evil turtle. The
background also disappears for
each boss encounter. There are
only six enemy generators in each
level, instead of 10 like in the
arcade version, plus they no longer
change color to reflect their health.
 
There are two Fantasy Zone
adaptations for the Nintendo 8-bit
systems. The Japanese Famicom
version, ported by Sunsoft, is
comparative to the Master System
version, and still succeeds in
looking decent despite being
limited to 16 colors, plus it even
manages to keep the radar. A few
years later, Tengen released their
Above: [ARC] The shop screen, and the sixth
and seventh stages.
Below: [SMS] 8-bit exclusive boss battles
87

own version for the Nintendo
Entertainment System. This
version has completely different
graphics to the Famicom game
and not only looks substantially
worse, but has funky controls and
lots of flickering. The version on
the TurboGrafx-16 comes the
closest to the arcade, but the
parallax scrolling is also absent,
and the music is pretty bad.
 
There were also a few
computer ports in Japan. The
MSX home computer version has
terrible graphics and unbearably
choppy scrolling. The Sharp MZ
version is even cruder, with
colored squares and triangles used
as graphics, though it’s cool in an
abstract art kind of way.
 
The X68000 version,
released in 1989 by Dempa, is
practically arcade perfect, along
with a few bonuses. There’s a
totally new, hidden level based on
Space Harrier called Dragon Land.
 
To reach it, you need to
break the radar down into
numbers. Starting at the right side,
count 1, 2, 3, etc. In each level,
the first pod you need to destroy
corresponds to that numbered pod
on the radar. For the first level,
you have to destroy the #1 pod
first, second level destroy the #2
pod first, etc. Instead of just
dropping a regular coin, they’ll
drop a letter. If you collect all
seven, it’ll spell out HARRIER.
When you beat the seventh stage,
you’ll be taken to Dragon Land.
There’s also a hidden options
screen, which lets you set
“Arrange“ music and uses the
computer’s MIDI instruments
instead of the arcade synth.
 
The first console arcade
perfect port was for the Sega
Saturn, released only in Japan
under the Sega Ages label. It
includes the original soundtrack as
redbook audio, in addition to a
vocal song (along with a karaoke
mode), and a replay mode with an
expert playthrough. There are also
hidden options, including the
ability to continue.
 
The PlayStation 2 version of
Fantasy Zone, released in 2003 as
part of the initial run of the Sega
Ages 2500 budget line (as Vol. 3),
is fairly decent. Opa-Opa, the
enemies and the bosses are
polygonal models, while the
backgrounds are still flat 2D albeit
with some effects to make them
seem 3D. The style faithfully
emulates the 2D original, but the
ugly interlacing artifacts diminish
the appeal. Thankfully, the game
plays almost perfectly regardless.
The music tracks are straight from
the arcade game. In addition to a
fairly faithful “Arcade Mode“,
there’s also an “Original Mode“.
This includes fancy camera pans
at the beginning of each level to
show off the polygonal models, as
well as new post-boss bonus
stages, where the view switches
to a behind-the-back perspective.
Here, the boss explodes and
vomits out bonus coins, which
you try to collect. Each scene
lasts 30 seconds though, so they
quickly grow tiresome.
By far the most interesting
addition is the “Challenge Mode“.
This lets you play individual stages
at your leisure, but allows you to
keep any additional money to buy
an assortment of bonus goodies,
many of which affect the “Original
Mode“. These unlockables include
a variety of super-powered
weapons like the Wild Beam and
14-Way Shot, the ability to
continue from the stage where
you died, an option to enable rapid
fire, another to disable shop
inflation, a Barrier like in Super
Fantasy Zone and, most excitedly,
four brand new stages:
Dawndusk, Apochal, Cavian and
Depooble. These all contain new
enemies, new bosses, and new
music, in a style consistent with
the original arcade version.
Unlocking these stages is
mandatory if you want to get the
good ending – if you play through
the game normally you’re treated
to a real bummer of a finale.
 
The best way to play the
original Fantasy Zone is on the
Fantasy Zone Complete Collection,
released for the PlayStation 2 in
2007, again as part of the Sega
Above: [ARC] More boss battles
Below: [X68] The Dragon Land stage
88

Ages 2500 line. This includes
perfect ports of both the original
arcade version and the SMS port.
The arcade version is also featured
as an unlockable on Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for the
PS3 and Xbox 360.
 
As an additional bonus on the
Fantasy Zone Complete Collection,
the disc includes a game called
Fantasy Zone Neo Classic
(unlocked by opening the menu
screen for the game, selecting the
“Mark III“ version, then holding
right on the d-pad). It’s an
enhanced version of the Famicom
port, but with slightly different
(and better) graphics, different
music synth, and some altered
enemy patterns.
 
Fantasy Zone was also a
hidden game in Arnold Palmer’s
Tournament Golf for the Genesis.
After hitting the ball 100 times on
the first hole without landing on
the green, input the code: Up, Up,
Down, Down, Left, Right, Left,
Right, B, A, and you’ll get to play
a level of Fantasy Zone. The
screen is cramped, and it’s only a
single stage, but it’s a nifty
diversion if you’re bored of golf.
 
For a long time, Opa-Opa was
an official mascot for Sega. He
showed up in the anime Zillion
(along with his brother Upa-Upa),
and ended up in the Sega Master
System game as a power-up item.
He also makes an appearance in
Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars as one
of the treasured items you pursue,
as well as a Mag (a flying robot
helper) in Phantasy Star Online.
The Fantasy Zone theme song,
“Opa Opa“, is featured in the
Dreamcast version of Sega’s
maraca shaking rhythm game,
Samba de Amigo, and as a cheer
song in the soccer game Virtua
Striker 4. He even makes a cameo
appearance in Sonic Riders, and is
a character in Sonic & Sega All
Stars Racing. He is a
downloadable character for the
racing minigame in Sonic
Adventure 2 and appears as a
caddy in the Japanese PC game
Sega Splash Golf.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Fantasy Zone II was designed
specifically for the 8-bit Master
System, and shakes up the
formula in a few ways (its
subtitle, The Tears of Opa-Opa,
was dropped in the Western
releases). There are, once again,
eight stages: Pastaria, Sarcand,
Hiyarika, Bow Bow, Chaprun,
Fuwareak, Sbardian and Wolfin.
 
Each level is broken down
into several subsections that you
switch between by running into
warp points. Once you’ve cleared
all of the bases in the level, you
need to track down the special red
warp point to encounter the boss.
This is all extremely aggravating,
because there’s no radar, so you
tend to wander around until you
find some enemy generators to
kill, and hopefully remember
where the red warp point is to
finish off the level.
 
The shop balloons are gone
too, replaced with stationary
“shop clouds“ located at specific
points in each level. Each shop
also carries different items, with a
few power-ups new to this game,
like the Shield. The upside is that
you can visit the shops any time
you want. The downside is that
when you respawn from a death,
you’ll be extremely underpowered
until you find them. Some special
power-ups are also hidden in the
scenery. Additionally, there’s a
Power Meter, allowing you to
absorb more than one bullet
before dying; directly colliding
with foes will still kill you instantly
though, until you find some items
to extend it.
 
The background designs are
even crazier than before, and
show off some of the most
colorful graphics on the Master
System. Still, while the graphics
are great for the system, it’s a
huge step down from the arcade
version of the first game.
Furthermore, the music is a
chirpy, terrible mess, which is
especially a shame after the
original’s catchy tunes. The FM
synth soundtrack in the Japanese
release is easier on the ear, but
still isn’t very good.
 
Fantasy Zone II was also
released in the arcades on the
System E board, although it’s
practically identical to the SMS
version, with a few changes. It
replaces the “Power“ meter with a
radar. However, even though it
shows the locations of the pods,
it doesn’t highlight where you are.
Each level is also timed, with a
little “life“ indicator that slowly
counts down to zero. You can
only take a single hit before dying,
though any seconds left when
completing a level will generate
extra gold.
 
Fantasy Zone II was also
ported to the Famicom and MSX2.
Both are quite inferior to the SMS
version, with terrible graphics,
even worse music, constant
slowdown, and in the case of the
MSX2 version, choppy scrolling.

Fantasy Zone II DX: The Tears of
Opa-Opa
Original Release: 2008
Platforms: PS2
The fact that Sega designed
Fantasy Zone II for the Master
System rather than the System 16
board was quite a disappointment.
So with the 2008 release of the
Fantasy Zone Complete Collection,
Sega and M2 went the extra mile
to make good on this old mistake,
by creating Fantasy Zone II DX.
 
It’s actually a remake, but not
any old remake – similar to Game
Center CX / Retro Game Challenge
and Mega Man 9, it’s a brand new
game developed using retro-style
graphics. Rather than simply
mimicking the low-res pixel art, the
developers actually programmed it
to be compatible with the System
16 hardware. They created a new
revision of the board, called
System 16C, which has more RAM
than the original A and B revisions,
but is otherwise functionally
similar. They even burnt ROMs for
use at some promotional events in
Japan, and the game is currently
emulated in MAME. As a result, it
features an aesthetic style exactly
like the original, except even more
colorful and surreal.
 
M2 did more than just
upgrade the graphics, as they fixed
up the other missteps. In the
original Fantasy Zone II, each level
consisted of several subsections
each with a unique background,
which you could transport
between via warps. This has been
changed so each level has a
“Bright“ and “Dark“ rendition – the
Bright level is the default version,
but the Dark equivalent has
different graphics and enemy
patterns, and even tougher bosses.
The Dark stages are so scary you
won’t find the standard Shop
balloons either, and need to
scavenge for hidden shops to buy
things. In the Bright levels the
shops pop out at the beginning of
each stage/life as in the other
games, so you don’t need to hunt
them down anymore.
Prince of Darkness
You technically never need to
enter the Dark areas, but enemies
give more money, and completing
these stages is the only way to get
the best ending. There are three
endings in total – in the bad one,
where Opa-Opa turns evil, it even
references the Harrier and Uriah
from Space Harrier as coming to
destroy him, further tying together
the two series. Of course, in
tightening up the levels, a lot of
the crazier backgrounds from the
original Fantasy Zone II
unfortunately had to be ditched,
but the developers picked the best
and used those as a basis.
 
Further tweaks have been
made in other areas. Opa-Opa
controls slightly differently, as
there’s a brief animation of him
turning around when switching
directions. The Power meter is
gone, but if you take a hit with a
special weapon equipped you’ll
lose the weapon though still
91

survive, which makes things a
little bit easier. Usage of super
bombs like 1 Ton weights are now
unlimited, though they need to be
charged for about a second before
they can be dropped. All of the
bosses are taken from the original
Fantasy Zone II; they’re not
exactly new, but their attacks
have been changed so they’re like
older siblings of the bosses from
the first Fantasy Zone. Each stage
opens with a unique Engrish-y
introduction text, similar to the
one that displayed in the first level
of the first game.
 
The soundtrack technically
consists of updated music from
Fantasy Zone II, but it’s all been
so heavily rearranged you can
barely tell. It uses the same FM
synth as the first game, and is
provided by veteran shooter
soundtrack composer Manabu
Namiki (Metal Slug 6, Dodonpachi
Daioujou, the Konami ReBirth
series, many Cave games). There
are more weapons this time
around too, including the
eponymous “Drop Tears“, which
are required for the best ending.
You even get the option to buy
speed enhancements after getting
killed by a boss, fixing one of the
most aggravating aspects of the
series. This might actually be the
best Fantasy Zone yet.

Fantasy Zone: The Maze is a
strange amalgamation of Fantasy
Zone and Pac-Man. It’s a concept
that actually works out quite well.
Each of the game’s seven levels
are patterned after stages from the
original Fantasy Zone, and each
consists of a small number of
single screen mazes.

gobbles up coins, which can be
used to purchase items in the
shops littered about. Although
Opa-Opa is initially defenseless,
you can grab an assortment of
guns and lasers, as well as items
similar to Pac-Man’s power pellets
that make Opa-Opa invulnerable
for a limited amount of time.
Endless Waves
At the center of the screen is an
enemy generator, which will
continuously pump out enemies to
replace any that you kill. Although
these generators cannot be
destroyed, you can glide over to
reset their energy, thereby
preventing further small enemies
from appearing. Various score
power-ups also occasionally
appear, including Flicky, the bird
from the Sega arcade game of the
same name.
The Maze is an interesting
game, but isn’t quite as fun as the
proper entries in the series. The
action isn’t nearly as hectic, and
the panic felt in Pac-Man is mostly
allayed thanks to the prevalence of
weapons. Purely as a score attack
game, though, it’s rather fun to
challenge yourself to beat boards
faster and get more points. The
simultaneous two-player mode is a
welcome addition too. And the
renditions of the famous Fantasy
Zone themes are much better than
the original SMS port.
 
Like Fantasy Zone II, this
game was developed for the
Master System, but also released
in Japan for the Sega System E
arcade board. Other than some
slightly enhanced graphics and
music, and altered stage layouts
(the arcade version fits double the
amount of coins in each level),
they’re mostly the same.

Galactic Protector is another
spin-off that has little to do with
Fantasy Zone, but features
Opa-Opa in the starring role.
 
Your task is to spin around
the planet in the middle of the
screen, firing at the pieces of
debris that come floating across
the screen. It’s a tough job, but
two players can play as once, with
the second player taking on the
role of Opa-Opa’s blue colored
brother Upa-Upa.
 
Your ships can only take one
hit before being destroyed, but you
need to make sure to protect the
planet too. It can only take so
many hits before blowing up,
which instantly ends the game.
The most amusing aspect is the
range of facial expressions on the
planets, which express emotions
from “jolly“ to “angry“ to
“extremely worried“.
It’s a bit simplistic, and some
additional weapons would’ve
greatly added to the variety. It’s
also pretty difficult, especially in
single-player mode, so expect to
see Earth blown up over and over
again. It’s also very light on
content. Even though there are 25
stages, there are only three
different planet graphics. The
shattered wreckage of Opa-Opa on
the Game Over screen is also quite
depressing, though the picture of
him enjoying a tropical vacation at
the victory finale almost negates
this dark image.
This game was only released
in Japan and requires the use of
the analog paddle controller. Some
believe that this was meant to be
released overseas under the name
Cube Zone, given that the
description on some Sega sales
fliers seems to match the
description of this game, but no
other solid evidence has been
found. Perhaps, like Woody Pop, it
was planned but canceled when
Sega decided not to release the
paddle controller outside of Japan.
 Other than hunting down the
extremely rare paddle controller
and buying a Mark III, the best
way to play it is on the Fantasy
Zone Complete Collection for the
PS2. However, the analog control
is still pretty fidgety and not quite
the same thing.

Fantasy Zone
AKA: Fantasy Zone Gear: Opa-
Opa Jr. No Bouken (JP)
Original Release: 1991
Platforms: GG, PS2
Unlike most Game Gear ports,
Fantasy Zone Gear isn’t just a
miniaturized version of the
arcade/SMS game. Rather, it’s a
completely new game. It was
developed by outside company
Sanritsu, who collaborated with
Sega on many other projects
during the era.
Little Things Lost
Since the game was developed
from the tiny Game Gear screen,
Fantasy Zone Gear removes the
status bar from the playing field,
which means there’s no radar, or
even any indicator of your weapon
ammunition. In spite of this, the
game still feels rather cramped.
From a technical standpoint, it
feels poorly programmed, as the
animation and movement is
distressingly choppy. The controls
are also a bit floatier than the
other games, so it’s way too easy
to accidentally stumble straight
into an enemy.
 
There are a handful of new
weapons, like the homing shot, as
well as an auto-fire option. You
can also pause the game and
select between your power-ups,
which is handy. There are seven
levels total, including the usual
final boss rush, though none of
them are named.
 
The visuals are fantastic too.
While not as full of pastel colors as
its predecessors, the backgrounds
are much more detailed than the
Sega Master System games.
Additionally, the soundtrack is also
relatively well done.
 
For what it is – a way to play
a Fantasy Zone game on the go –
Fantasy Zone Gear is decent
enough, but its awkward controls
and cramped screen reduce it to
being one of the lesser titles of
Sega's series.

Fantasy Zone II and Fantasy Zone
Gear weren’t bad by any means,
but they both ran on hardware
quite inferior to the original arcade
game. Released in 1992, Super
Fantasy Zone for the Genesis is
the first true sequel that not only
matches, but surpasses its
predecessor in aesthetics, with
gorgeous graphics and an insanely
catchy soundtrack. It was
developed by Sunsoft, who had
previously worked on the Famicom
port of the first game.
 
During the entire time that
you play, you forget about the
Genesis’ limited 64-color palette
and marvel at the pastel glory. The
music is some of the best
composed for the Genesis. The
opening cinematic story tells a
traumatic story, as Opa-Opa sets
off to destroy the Menon empire to
avenge his father’s death.
 
For the most part, the game is
exactly the same as the original
Fantasy Zone, just with new
enemies and levels. These include
Picknica, Kazarne, Niagro,
Risscave, Grandiuss, Le-Picker,
Aflouricious and Menone. There
are a fair bit more weapons to buy
this time around, including the
incredibly useful four-way homing
missiles. Also, special weapons
(like the classic megaton weight)
now have their own button, so you
can save them for the right
moment. There are certain
“gimmick“ items you can purchase
for some stages. One level is
completely cloaked in darkness, so
you’ll have a much easier time if
you buy the headlights. Another
has electrified floors, requiring that
you purchase boots if you want to
land on the ground.
 
Since this was developed
specifically as a home console
release, the difficulty is tuned so
it’s challenging without being
frustrating, and the rapid fire
option is most definitely welcome.
Even the scrolling has been fixed
so it’s easier to see what’s in front
of your ship.
 
One of the coolest parts of
the game is the tie-in with one of
its Sega arcade brethren –  the
final stage has a checkerboard
pattern on the floors and ceilings,
an homage to Space Harrier. You
can also enter a secret code that
lets you play the game with the
soundtrack from the original
Fantasy Zone.
 
Unfortunately, the biggest
travesty of Super Fantasy Zone is
that it was never released in
America, only in Japan and Europe.
Regardless, the game defaults to
English anyway if you’re playing on
an American Genesis.

Space Fantasy Zone
Original Release: unreleased
Platforms: PCE
Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone
were always sort of related – both
had cracked out character designs,
both referenced the same world
(the “Fantasy Zone“, of course),
even the high-score themes are
similar. So someone took the
natural step and combined them
into one mega game, Space
Fantasy Zone. All of the levels and
bad guys are favorites taken from
both games, and some of the
Space Harrier baddies have been
given cutesy makeovers.
The gameplay is exactly like
Space Harrier, although you have a
shield meter and only one life.
Shooting enemies will give you
gold, while taking out whole
waves yields even more money. In
between stages you can buy tons
of different power-ups at a store
cleverly named “Weponalds“,
including several kinds of speed-
ups, power shots, extra weapons,
shields, bombs, and options. You
can also spend your time poking
the chest of the store clerk, if you
feel so inclined, or order a smile.
 
The graphics capture the
pastels of the original game,
although since the PC Engine can’t
handle scaling, the movement isn’t
as smooth as it could be – it’s
about on par with Space Harrier II
for the Genesis. The main theme is
a combination of the famous songs
from both games, although the
rest of the music, alas, is
disappointingly banal.
Not For Consumption
It’s fun, although a somewhat
short game (only nine short
stages, compared to the 18 of the
Space Harrier). But the biggest
tragedy? The game never saw an
official release – it was on release
lists, it was advertised (with
designs by famous artist Satoshi
Urushihara), but it was ultimately
canned. No one knows why for
sure. Thankfully, a beta version
was leaked to the internet, so it
can easily be played.
However, be careful of
bootlegs being sold online. Some
fans have created replications of
what the package should have
looked like had they been released,
but these are not authentic.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Sega was a rather pitiable entity
when it came to the Master
System. They had no market
share, their advertising was almost
non-existent, and everyone was
busy neglecting homework to play
Nintendo instead. However, those
who stuck with the underdog
console found solace in a few key
franchises. One of these was Alex
Kidd, the closest Sega came to
having a Mario-style mascot until
Sonic the Hedgehog showed up,
years later.
Sega credits Alex Kidd to an
individual name Osahru (Ossale)
Kohta, although that’s actually a
pseudonym for Kotaro Hayashida,
who also worked as a scenario
writer for Phantasy Star and the
Phantasy Star II Text Adventure
games, as well as other Master
System titles like Fushigi no Oshiro
Pit-Pot, Woody Pop, Zillion, and
Fantasy Zone.
Alex’s most prominent
features are his large ears, red
jumpsuit and gigantically enormous
sideburns. He is, in some ways,
designed to look sort of like a
monkey. Although he looked
appealingly cutesy in the original
Japanese artwork, all of the
Western boxes seemed to make
him look like an obnoxious, fat,
freckled third grader, which
probably played a role in dooming
him to obscurity.
Though there are six Alex
Kidd games, they’re almost all
entirely different from each other –
only Miracle World, the first
Master System game, and
Enchanted Castle, the first (and
only) Genesis game, share similar
designs and gameplay.
 
Alex Kidd is often compared
to Mario, since he was the
competitor’s only mascot at the
time, but their games couldn’t be
more different. While Nintendo’s
game is a straight-up platformer
that could feel right at home in the
arcades, Alex Kidd in Miracle
World is a much more ambitious
game. Whereas Super Mario Bros.
was simply about running from left
to right, jumping over things and
occasionally looking out for secret
stuff, Miracle World feels like a
much fuller adventure.
 
Alex’s first adventure takes
place on the planet of Aries where,
as the hero and the lost member of
the Radaxian royal family, he has
spent many years on the top of
Mt. Eternal honing his block-
breaking skills. He halts his studies
to save his brother Egul, who has
been captured by the evil king
Janken. (Alex's brother shares his
name with the hero of Pit-Pot, one
of Hayashida’s previous games,
and is sometimes spelled Egle or
Igul.) There’s actually quite a bit of
backstory laid out with a number
of secondary characters mentioned
in the manual; they only appear
briefly in the game, and are mostly
members of the Radaxian royal
family. There is a surprising
amount of text compared to other
Alex Kidd in Miracle World
Original Release: 1986
Platforms: SMS, PS3, X360, WII
98

games of the time, certainly much
more than “Your Princess is in
Another Castle“, at least.
 
For starters, it breaks free
from the repetitive four-level cycle
of Super Mario Bros. to create a
much more organic experience.
Most levels scroll horizontally, as
is typical, but a handful scroll
vertically downwards, and the few
castle stages actually flip-scroll in
all four directions. Throughout the
adventure you play through
mountains, forests, oceans, towns
and other varied locales. A map
screen at the beginning of each
stage and on the pause screen
shows your progress through the
game’s 17 levels.
 
Alex’s trademark power is the
ability to break rocks with his
enormous fists (dubbed the
“Shellcore“ technique). There are
many “star“ blocks spread within
each stage, most of which contain
bags of money. Cash is not
directly for extra lives, but instead
acts as currency to buy a variety
of power-ups in shops found
around each stage. Certain blocks
marked with question marks also
give specific items, one of the
most important being a bracelet
that lets you shoot power waves.
This is extremely useful, because
Alex’s punches are rather short
ranged and leave him susceptible
to danger. However, these same
blocks can also spawn deadly
magicians, who ruthlessly hunt
Alex down unless he can outwit or
outrun them.
 
Several stages also allow you
to purchase vehicles to make life a
bit easier. These include a
“sukopako“ motorcycle, which can
plow straight through rock; a
“pedicopter“, a small personal
helicopter activated by pedaling;
and a “suisui” speedboat.
Unfortunately, these will explode if
you either take a hit or run into an
obstacle, forcing you to play the
rest of the stage on foot.
Eat Paper, Rock Head!
Major boss battles don’t occur
normally like in other games.
Instead, the big showdown sport
of Miracle World is a match of
rock-paper-scissors (known as
janken in Japan). The ridiculous
looking enemies actually have
hands for heads – their names are
Rock Head, Paper Head and
Scissor Head, obviously. Win, and
you proceed. Lose, and you die.
Actually, even if the bad guys
lose, they’re very sore about it and
tend to attack anyway. When you
first play, winning these battles is
a matter of luck. However, if you
manage to find a certain hidden
item, you can read their minds.
They still try to trick you, of
course, and naturally if you don’t
find this hidden item, you’re kinda
screwed for the remainder of the
game. There are set patterns for
all of them, but they change
unpredictably if you lose, which
can drastically screw you up.
 
While it’s a remarkably
constructed game, Alex Kidd in
Miracle World is brutally difficult.
Alex can only take a single hit
before dying, but that’s the least
of his worries. Some of the later
levels are filled with particularly
nasty platforming challenges,
requiring intense precision to dash
or swim through narrow corridors
without bumping your head on a
bed of spikes. The slippery
controls don’t help matters either.
Thankfully, as long as you have
spare cash, you can continue
through the use of a code. Plus,
the left Button 1 on the controller
jumps, and the right Button 2
attacks, making it the opposite of
the later established norms. Still,
the graphics are colorful and
distinct, and the main theme is
catchy (composed by 1980s Sega
mainstay Tokuhiko Uwabo), even
though it certainly could’ve used
more songs throughout the rather
long adventure. It has all the
makings of a classic, though lacks
the straightforward “pick up and
play“ feel of Nintendo’s more
famous games, making it harder to
get into if the player has little
patience for Alex Kidd’s quirks.
Want Rice With That?
There are minimal differences
between regional versions. At the
end of each level is a rice ball,
which Alex then eats as the map
screen pops up. Also known as
99

“onigiri“ in Japan, these are bits of
rice clumped together and
wrapped in seaweed, usually with
some kind of fish or other filling.
Later revisions of Miracle World,
built into the Sega Master
System II, actually have Alex
eating a hamburger instead. This
version also swaps the buttons to
a normal configuration. On another
note, the currency used in Miracle
World is a U with two lines
through it, called a Baum. The
symbol for Japanese yen is a ¥, or
a Y with two lines in it. This
symbol also shows up the Master
System game Zillion.
 
Despite the numerous Sega
compilations and remakes, Alex
Kidd has barely been featured in
any of them. Outside of a handful
of Virtual Console releases for the
Wii, the only major package comes
in the form of the Sega Vintage
Collection, named Alex Kidd & Co.
The only game in the collection
starring Alex Kidd is the first one,
Miracle World, as the other two
games are Super Hang-On and
Revenge of Shinobi. They’re all
just ROM dumps, but the
emulation, developed by M2, is
excellent, and it includes versions
from all territories.
The Tragic Downfall
Segagaga is a brilliant Japanese
Dreamcast game where you get to
take control of Sega to help it win
the video game war (naturally, this
was before they bowed out of the
console race back in 2001). At
one point, you run into Alex Kidd.
When you meet him, he details the
tragic story of his fall from grace –
at first, he was strong competition
for Nintendo and Mario (both
names bleeped out), but was later
forgotten in favor of Sonic the
Hedgehog. Instead of starring in
video games, he’s now forced to
work retail at one of Sega’s shops.
He gives the player character an
inspirational speech about moving
forward. He also laments that he’s
38 years old and still looks like a
kid. A very sad, but hilariously
tongue-in-cheek look at Alex Kidd.

Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars
Original Release: 1986
Platforms: ARC, SMS, WII
Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars is a bit
of a departure from Miracle World.
Many of the more unique elements
have been ditched in favor of a
more straightforward move-right-
and-jump-over-stuff approach. As
a result, it feels even closer to
Super Mario Bros. than the
original. The game originated in the
arcades on the Sega System 16
board (and was released very
shortly after Miracle World in
Japan) but was later ported to the
Master System.
The goal this time is collect
the 12 Zodiac signs. You can no
longer punch anything, and there
are no rocks to be broken, nor any
cash to grab. It’s actually quite
similar to Westone’s Wonder Boy,
particularly in that there’s a timer
on the screen.
The arcade version keeps
track of lives, making it quite a bit
more difficult compared to the
Master System port. On the
Master System you receive
unlimited lives, but getting hit or
falling down a pit will reduce the
timer or send you back a few
screens. The toughest bits in both
versions are the end-of-level
encounters, requiring that you
make it through a single screen
while various enemies attempt to
screw you up. To make things
easier you’ll find power-ups which
let you jump higher, restore your
timer, or give you a limited amount
of “shadow“ shots to destroy
most enemies with.
The graphics are bright,
colorful, and full of detail, while
the music, provided by another
relatively famous Sega composer,
Hiroshi Kawaguchi, is extremely
catchy. Despite the smaller color
palette, the Master System version
is actually brighter and more
attractive overall.
Other than the issue with the
lives, the biggest difference
between the arcade and Master
System release is that the arcade
version offers two-player
simultaneous play, with the
second player taking on a girl
named Stella, who is otherwise
never seen in any other game in
the series.
The first stage is a land of
toys, set up to look like a kid’s
stage play, complete with a
background that appears to have
been painted on a hanging banner.
Dogs attack by barking out the
letters “BOW WOW“, evil Alice In
Wonderland-style playing cards
march forth, and the landscape is
built of bright play blocks.
The rest of the levels include
a robotics factory, an odd horror-
themed level, a prehistoric area, an
outer space stage, and the innards
of some gigantic creature. It’s a
creative bunch of levels, to say the
least. The single genuine pitfall is
that the game is really only seven
stages long. You have to play
through each of these levels twice
to beat the game entirely, although
the second time things are a bit
101

more difficult. Compared to the 17
stages of its predecessor though,
and it’s kind of a bummer.
Alex Kidd in Miracle World
had some crazy enemies,
especially with the bad guys
shaped like hands, but Lost Stars
actually one-ups it. One of the
bosses is a disembodied bear head
with a party hat, who attacks you
with musical notes from his
trumpet. In the Halloween level
there’s a punk rocker who shoots
skulls out of his ass. If these
things weren’t creepy enough,
Alex lets out a terrible blood-
curdling digitized scream
whenever he gets hit. There’s
other bits of neat digitized speech
too, like the disembodied voice
that starts off each stage saying
“FIND THE MIRACLE BALL“ (one
of the Miracle Balls is actually
Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone). The
arcade version even welcomes
players with “THE CUSTOMER IS
KING!“ when a credit is entered.
The Lost Stars gets a bad
rap because it’s such a huge step
back from the ambitious Miracle
World, but consider it in its
original arcade setting, and its
being positioned as a straight-up
platformer makes perfect sense.
The Lost Stars is full of enough
weird enemies and memorable
landscapes to be quite likeable.

Alex Kidd: High-Tech World
AKA: Anmitsu Hime (JP SMS)
Original Release: 1988
Platforms: SMS
Sega obviously has no shame in
whoring itself out. The plot of
Alex Kidd: High Tech World is to
guide Alex to an arcade called
High Tech World, named after their
own real-life chain, to play the
latest Sega games.
 
This game, the third released
in North America and Europe, is
again entirely different from its
predecessors, being half puzzle-
solving adventure and half action.
It’s also very odd, given that
events take place in a Japanese-
style castle, featuring a totally
different cast of characters
(besides Alex) from before.
 
Throughout the whole game
you’re also on a time limit – if you
don’t reach High Tech World by
17:00, you lose.  Alex spends the
first level exploring the castle,
following vague clues to find eight
map pieces. There is absolutely no
action in these segments, as you
cannot jump or attack, and can
only walk around the castle,
exploring the rooms and solving
puzzles. Some of the map pieces
are easy to find, while others
require obtuse solutions. At one
point you need to take a test given
by your tutor, who quizzes you
about the levels in Space Harrier,
along with history and math
questions. Another map piece
requires that you pay attention to
the in-game clock and visit specific
rooms at specific times.
 
Although there are no
enemies in the castle, per say,
there are a number of incredibly
stupid ways to end the game. If
you try on a cool looking piece of
armor, you’ll become immobilized
and lose. One map piece you find
is burnt – if you grab it without
first spraying on some “restorer
powder“, it’ll crumble and, again,
the game will end. There’s one
particular set of stairs that looks
innocuous, but if you walk down
you quickly discover that it’s
broken, so you’ll fall and, once
again, game over. Although there
are passwords, they only save
progress between the four major
areas, so if you perish in the first
castle segment – by far the
longest part of the game – you
need to restart the whole thing.
 
The second level is a very
poorly implemented action scene.
Ninjas pop up everywhere and you
need to defend yourself with
throwing stars. A single hit will kill
you, but at least this segment is
short. Also useful are gold coins
found throughout, which are used
in the next area.
 
The third level is an
adventure scene similar to the first
area, except much shorter. The
ultimate goal is to get past the
gate guard and leave the town.
There are three ways to
accomplish this – either run a few
errands to raise enough money to
bribe the guard; pray at a temple
100 times (!!) to get a travel pass,
which takes several minutes and is
a very aggravating solution; or
103

simply happen to be at the right
place at the right time for a
random citizen to lend you their
pass. Though there are many
shops and many people to talk to,
they are mostly pointless.
 
The game over sequences
here are even more hilarious than
in the castle. You can actually find
a weapon in town, only to get
arrested as a criminal if you try to
leave. You can try to forge a travel
pass but get busted for
counterfeiting. Or most brilliantly,
you can eat too many hot dogs
and become “dizzy“.
 
Once you’ve finished up all of
that, you’re in for another ninja-
filled action stage, which is just as
bad as the previous one, except
this has some annoying snake and
tanuki enemies.
 
 Although it’s cool that Sega
tried to blend genres with this
entry, both segments are so poorly
done that it’s disappointing.
 
There’s a reason why this is
so completely different (and
terrible) compared to the others –
it wasn’t originally an Alex Kidd
game. In Japan, it’s known as
Anmitsu Hime, and is based on a
mid-1980s anime, which in turn
was based on a manga dating
back to 1949, about a tomboy
princess in feudal Japan. This
makes sense, given that the castle
and town levels are distinctly
Japanese, as are all of the
secondary characters.
 
Instead of adventuring to find
an arcade, Anmitsu is trying to
visit a new bakery. All of the
sprites have been replaced in Alex
Kidd: High Tech World, and some
dialogue rewritten, though the
attempts to westernize it are
sloppy at best. The ramen stall
from Anmitsu Hime has been
changed to a hotdog stall, while
the samurai sword is now the gun
Alex can find. Despite these
changes, High Tech World still has
signs which were left in Japanese.
Apart from these changes, the
games are otherwise identical.

Alex Kidd: BMX Trial
Original Release: 1987
Platforms: SMS
Released between Miracle World
and the Master System version of
The Lost Stars, Alex Kidd BMX
Trial is the only title in the series
to remain exclusively in Japan,
probably because it requires the
Master System’s analog paddle
controller, which was not released
in other territories.
Alex Kidd shifts genres once
again, with this one being a bike
racing game. However, it is rather
unusual, since there’s no ranking
and the only time limit involves
reaching the end within 24 in-
game hours. The goal of each race
is simply to find the exit. Though
the screen scrolls vertically, each
stage is several screens wide, and
loops continuously until you’ve
found a tunnel to the next area.
Most levels have several exits,
each of which will take you to a
different level from the others.
 
There are five stages in total,
and the ultimate goal is to make it
to Radaxian Castle. If you know
what you’re doing, you can
accomplish this in a couple of
minutes. Until you memorize the
proper path, you’ll probably just
end up biking in circles.
 
The stages are filled with
rocks, trees, cactuses, and other
obstacles that will cause Alex to
fall off his bike and lose a little bit
of life. The exception is one level
that takes place atop the ocean
waves, where you ride on some
kind of flotation device and need
to avoid whirlpools.
 
There are several opponents
in the race, but they only exist to
knock Alex out of the way.
Unfortunately they are quite
aggressive, and there’s no direct
way to fight back against them.
When you run out of health you
lose the game. Scattered
throughout the stages are wheelie
ramps, which will grant Alex
invincibility for about a second as
he pops a wheelie, and jump
ramps, allowing Alex to leap briefly
into the sky. Power-ups include
onigiri to restore health, clocks to
reset the timer, and jet packs that
allow you to fly.
 
Alex looks the same as he did
in Miracle World, though the
enemies – including tigers and
kappa imps – are all new. The
background details are amusing,
like the colorful faces on the trees,
and the goofy looking exits.

expensive, while playing the game
on emulators, either using an
analog controller or a mouse,
makes it very difficult to control.

After so many departures, Alex’s
first (and only) Genesis outing
goes back to its roots, with
gameplay similar to Miracle World.
The graphics are more colorful,
although since this was a launch
title for the Genesis it’s still not
too impressive.
 
Alex’s father Thor has been
found alive on the planet of
Paperrock, so Alex attempts to
save him from the evil Ashra.
There are only 11 levels, compared
to the 17 in Miracle World, but
most of them are a bit more
expansive, allowing you to find
alternate routes in the sky, or in
hidden underground areas. The
types of levels are similar to the
original game, although there are
now a few Egyptian influenced
stages. Most of the items and
vehicles are the same, although
there is a new pogo stick.
 
Unlike the original, which
required that you use most items
as soon as you bought them, you
can now access an inventory
screen to use them whenever you
want. Also, when you hit blocks
hovering in midair, it won’t destroy
them, but instead send them flying
across the screen squashing
anything in their path. If the blocks
are next to a solid wall, they’ll
break like normal.
 
Most of these improvements
are for the better, but there have
been some questionable changes.
You can’t just walk into stores and
buy things anymore, you need to
play rock-paper-scissors with the
shopkeepers to get anything, in
addition to paying money. Again,
you can’t see the other character’s
moves unless you have a special
item, which proves most annoying
when your life depends on it.
 
The controls are also even
more slippery than they were in
Miracle World. Not only are Alex’s
punches rather slow, but you can’t
punch in midair. Rather, you’ll
automatically jump kick after
reaching the apex of your jump,
and you need to position him so
his foot makes contact with the
enemy. Trying to hit anything like
this without inadvertently getting
killed is extremely frustrating. It’s
a shame, because Enchanted
Castle comes up the poorer game
compared to Miracle World.
 
There’s some censorship
between regions. At the end of a
rock-paper-scissors battle in the
English release, a large weight falls
on the loser’s head. In the
Japanese version, the loser is
stripped of their clothes, with, in
Alex’s case, a tiny elephant
covering his naughty bits.

For Alex’s last adventure, Sega
tossed him back to the 8-bit
Master System and decided to
fuse him with one of their other
franchises – Shinobi. This game
was only released in North
America and PAL territories (with
the former being quite rare) and
was never released in Japan. In an
opening that seems suspiciously
reminiscent of Sega’s Dynamite
Dux, Alex’s girlfriend is kidnapped
by a demon named Hanzo, and
Alex himself is turned into a ninja
by a deity known as the White
Ninja, in order to go save her.
 
Several of the stages are
reminiscent of levels from Shinobi,
and the bosses take vague
inspiration from them too. Even
the main theme music is derived
from Shinobi, just played at a
faster tempo. However, some
aspects from the Alex Kidd games
remain, like the destructible
blocks, the slippery controls and
the swimming stages.
 
Even though it draws from
both franchises, it’s very much its
own game. Alex attacks with a
sword, which can be strengthened
with a certain power-up. You can
also find ninja throwing knives to
attack foes at a distance, in
addition to ninja magic to turn
temporarily into a whirlwind.
You can climb up ropes,
bounce off walls Ninja Gaiden-
style, or grapple onto pipes and
spin until you become a fireball,
flinging yourself at foes.
This is also the only game in
the series where you have a life
meter. You can take three hits, but
there are numerous health
restoration items, so it’s not too
difficult. You only get a single
continue, but there are only eight
brief stages (plus four boss battles)
so it’s a pretty short game.
 
What’s interesting is that this
was not always intended to be an
Alex Kidd title. A few magazines
revealed an early version of the
game titled Shinobi Kid, starring
some generic boy instead of Alex.
It also reveals, amusingly, that the
first boss was meant to be named
“Mari-Oh“, to make fun of
Nintendo’s famous mascot (he
resembles the first boss of
Shinobi, who is named “Ken-Oh“).
 Even though the sprite was
slightly redrawn for the released
game, it’s easy to see the
resemblance – he shoots fireballs
that bounce like they do in Super
Mario Bros., and once you deplete
his life meter he shrinks and
continues to attack. Pretty clever.

featured in a 1989 issue of
Electronic Gaming Monthly.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Created by a development house
named Escape (later renamed
Westone Bit Entertainment),
Wonder Boy was one of Sega’s
mascot games in the mid-to-late
1980s, alongside Sega favorites
like Alex Kidd. Starting off in the
arcades, its history is actually one
of the most complicated and
baffling in all of video gaming,
involving numerous spin-offs, sub-
series, and licensed variations.
 
The first game, known simply
as Wonder Boy, is a fast paced
side-scrolling platformer, and was
published and distributed by Sega.
Hudson then obtained the rights to
port Wonder Boy, but decided to
replace the main character with a
goofy version of Takahashi Meijin,
a real-life spokesperson for the
company. They rounded out his
face, stuck on a baseball cap, and
gave him the same grass skirt as
Wonder Boy. Developed for the
Famicom and NES, it was known
as Takahashi Meijin no Boukenjima
in Japanese, and Adventure Island
in America.
 
For the sequel, Escape (now
having changed its name to
Westone), took the character of
Wonder Boy and stuck him in a
totally new game. Beginning a new
series dubbed Monster World, it
ditches the prehistoric setting of
the original game for a medieval
world, and introduces some light
RPG elements. There are a total of
four games in the Monster World
series: Wonder Boy in Monster
Land, Wonder Boy III: The
Dragon’s Trap (known as Monster
World II in Japan), Wonder Boy in
Monster World (known as Wonder
Boy V: Monster World III), and
Monster World IV (which ditched
the Wonder Boy title, since it stars
a female protagonist).
 
Between the release of the
second and third games in the
Monster World series, Westone
developed a unique shooter-
platformer called Wonder Boy III:
Monster Lair (this is unrelated to
Wonder Boy III: The Dragon’s
Trap, which was not released in
Japan under that title).
 
Hudson published many of
these games on other platforms,
but much like the Takahashi Meijin
games, Hudson elected to replace
Wonder Boy with different
characters in each installment.
Furthermore, when the Monster
World games were published in
Brazil, all of the characters were
replaced with cast members from
the Portuguese cartoon series
Turma da Mônica.
 
Finally, Hudson took the
original Wonder Boy / Takahashi
Meijin / Adventure Island game
and created its own separate
franchise. Many of these titles
were mostly similar to the first
game, thereby making them more
faithful to the original Wonder Boy
than any of Westone’s later
games. But a few of the entries,
namely the fourth Famicom game
and the second SNES game, cross-

pollinate the series’ DNA even
further by utilizing a non-linear,
exploratory structure similar to
Monster World.
 
The original Wonder Boy was
initially released in the arcades, for
the Sega System 2 board. As
caveboy Tom-Tom (named Boy or
Bocke in Japan), the goal is to
rescue your green haired girlfriend
Tanya (Tina in Japan) from the evil
lord Drancon (“Kings” in Japan).
The gameplay is patterned after
the ever popular Super Mario Bros.
– you run forward, jump over bad
guys, and leap across moving
platforms. There are seven worlds,
each containing four stages, and
each ending with a brief boss
battle against Drancon.
 
The main difference to Super
Mario Bros. is that Wonder Boy is
even faster paced. There is a
power bar at the top of the
screen, but it’s not a life bar.
Rather, it acts as a timer, one that
counts down remarkably quickly.
The only way to refill it is by
grabbing the pieces of fruit that
are sprinkled liberally throughout
each stage.
Taking a single hit will kill
you, though most levels are also
littered with stones. These cause
you to trip and, technically, while
they won’t kill you they will
deplete your power meter, and can
potentially send you into a bad
guy or right into a pit.
 
While you are normally
defenseless against bad guys, you
can crack open eggs to grant
power-ups. Hatchets are your
primary weapon, and are thrown
at an arc, making it good at long
range but difficult to use up close.
You can also find skateboards,
which will let you move faster and
can absorb a single hit, though its
forward momentum makes it hard
to control. Fairies can also grant
invincibility for a limited time.
There are also spotted, rotten
eggs that unleash a little Grim
Reaper, which drains your stamina
more quickly.
While the controls are
slippery, the constant checkpoints
ensure the game doesn’t get too
frustrating. There are also wooden
dolls located in each stage – if you
manage to uncover all of them by
the end, you unlock a hidden
eighth and final world.
 
While Wonder Boy is a solid
game, the level designs are never
quite as clever as the Nintendo
game it’s patterned after. And
although it’s quite attractive, with
lush jungle scenery, and spooky
caverns made of ice or dank rock,
the levels are quite repetitive.
There are only about eight
environments, and many levels are
simply more difficult variations of
previous stages. The fourth stage
of each area is practically
identical, right up to the boss
battles, where you fight the same
fireball-tossing bad guy, albeit
with different faces.
 
The first port of Wonder Boy
was for the SG-1000. This system
was not built with scrolling
backgrounds in mind, so the
action is incredibly choppy, and
the graphics are extraordinarily
simplistic. The levels have also
been cut back, leaving only the
barest of experiences.
 
The most well known version
is the Sega Master System port,
which is enhanced in a number of
ways. It looks excellent, especially
since the status bar has been
removed, with only the vitality
meter remaining at the top. The
controls have been slightly messed
with though. You can only do a
high jump when you hold down
the run button, which makes
certain jumps chaotic. On the
positive side, Tom-Tom is a bit
less slippery and easier to keep
under control.
There are two additional
worlds on the SMS, making for
nine in the main game, as well as
the tenth hidden world for
collecting all of the dolls. There
109

are also a handful of brand new
sub-stages, including a desert, a
waterfall, and an area that takes
place in the clouds. Along with
this is a brand new boss who
throws lightning rather than
fireballs. It has unlimited
continues, too. This version was
used as the basis for a Game Gear
port, which was released in North
America under the name Revenge
of Drancon.
 
In Europe, Wonder Boy was
ported to several home computer
platforms, courtesy of Activision.
On the lower end of the ports is
the ZX Spectrum version, which is
stuck with green monochrome
graphics, choppy scrolling and
slow action. The Amstrad CPC
and Commodore 64 versions are
visually almost identical to each
other, though the C64 version has
a leg-up on speed. However, these
versions only have four stages
that repeat, getting slightly more
difficult each time.
 
The NES port by Hudson,
under the name Takahashi Meijin
no Boukenjima in Japan and
Adventure Island in America, is
fairly faithful, though not nearly as
graphically attractive. In North
America and Europe the
character’s name is changed to
Master Higgins. The other
character names are inconsistent
depending on what you read – in
some versions the female captive
is named Tina, and the antagonist
is King Quiller, while some
advertising copy claims that you
are rescuing Princess Leilani from
the evil Witch Doctor.
 
Since Adventure Island is
based on the original arcade game,
it’s missing the stages added to
the Master System and Game
Gear releases. The dolls have been
replaced with goofy looking pots,
and while they give bonus points,
they are no longer required to
reach the eighth stage, which you
will always play no matter how
well you do. You technically have
unlimited continues, but only if
you manage to find the Hudson
Bee mascot in the first level.
There’s also a new fireball
weapon, which acts much like the
hatchets but can destroy rocks
and other previously invincible
obstacles. The fairies are the
same, but the devils are now evil
flying eggplants.
 
The MSX port by Hudson
was based off the FC/NES
Adventure Island. It’s mostly the
same, though while the FC/NES
version has a new soundtrack, the
MSX version uses the same music
as the arcade game.
Adventure Island was also
ported to cellphone. The revised
graphics are pleasant, though the
bug-eyed Takahashi Meijin looks
quite silly.

Wonder Boy in Monster Land
AKA: Super Wonder Boy
Monster World (JP MK III), etc.
Original Release: 1987
Platforms: AC, SMS, FC, C64,
AMI, AST, PCE, ZX, MOB, WII
A drastic departure from the
original, Wonder Boy in Monster
Land thrusts our hero into a
medieval world, and replaces the
tomahawks and grass skirts with
swords and shields. You now have
a single life and a heart meter,
though at the beginning you are
granted a single-use resurrection
potion. Rather embarrassingly, you
spend the first few levels in the
arcade version fighting monsters
while wearing only underwear. The
hero is nicknamed Book (full name:
Bocke Lee Temjin), though he only
called this in the SMS manual and
arcade ending credits, and usually
just referred to as Wonder Boy.
Monster Land is a unique
game because it combines linear
level-based gameplay with RPG
elements. Each of the 11 stages is
fairly brief, although they are
heavily populated with shops,
bars, and other folks.
 
Conversations are shown in a
first-person view, with the
denizens of Monster Land ranging
from bartender lizards and demonic
fortune tellers to cuddly teddy
bears. You can buy new
equipment – armor to reduce
damage, shields to deflect
projectiles, and boots to run faster
and jump farther – while more
powerful swords are found
through optional boss battles. You
can also spend your hard earned
cash on some booze as well,
which both restores health and
offers some helpful hints. Getting
higher scores will increase the
maximum number of hearts.
Certain enemies also drop a variety
of magic spells, each with a
limited number of uses, which
include fireballs, tornados, and
lightning zaps. However, they are
placed in a queue and
automatically cast by pressing
down on the joystick, so you can’t
choose which one to use. Items
like gauntlets and helmets also
temporarily increase your offense
and defense.
 
Gathering cash is also a bit
unusual. As expected, fallen
enemies yield gold, but only the
first time you kill them – after
respawning, they simply give score
items. This means you can’t just
stand in one place and grind for
money. Instead, most cash is
found in hidden caches sprinkled
throughout each stage (once you
find them, there’s an exploitable
glitch where you can wiggle the
joystick and milk them for
substantially more cash than you
would normally get). Yet the game
actively discourages such
exploration, due to a constantly
ticking timer, which will deplete
one heart from your life meter
unless you can find hourglasses to
reset it.
 
There’s also a fair amount of
hidden and optional stuff. One of
the major stages is a spiked-filled
pyramid. At the end is the Sphinx,
who asks you a randomized
question (some of these are
111

characteristically silly – he likes
salad and his favorite Sega game
is apparently After Burner). If you
don’t know these already, you
need to visit a specific bar earlier
in the stage and obtain the info
from the barkeeper. If you guess
correctly you’ll win the fight
automatically, otherwise it’s quite
a tough battle.
 
Furthermore, if you want to
be properly equipped for the final
battle, you’d best uncover as
much of the game as possible.
The ultimate goal is to find all of
the Legendary equipment.
Throughout the game, there’s a
running subquest as you play
messenger for various people,
most in secret locations. If you
successfully complete it, you’ll be
given the option to pick from two
secret items: a bell and a ruby.
 
The bell will help you
navigate the labyrinthine final
stage; the ruby will make the
incredibly difficult final battle a
little bit easier. But again, the
speedy “rush rush“ feeling of the
action makes it too easy to miss
these quasi-essential items,
because it’s impossible to go back
to completed levels if you miss a
step. Essentially, the game
expects you to have played it
several times, have all of the
secrets and quests memorized,
and have an optimal route planned
beforehand. It’s also an incredibly
tough game. Your sword attacks
are short-ranged and not
particularly fast, while most
enemies are much more agile than
your character and can easily gang
up on you.
 
There are some slightly silly
things, like the ability to explore
underwater areas, walking on the
sea floor, while wearing a full suit
of armor. The finale also takes a
turn for the bizarre. After
completing the final dungeon, you
discover that the penultimate boss
is actually an entity from outer
space: the nefarious robot being,
Meka Dragon. This sudden change
from fantasy to sci-fi became a
hallmark of many of the later
Wonder Boy games.
 
The graphics are repetitive,
which is to be expected in an
arcade game from 1987, but
colorful. Changing pieces of
equipment will affect the look of
your character’s sprite, which is a
nice touch. Many enemies, like the
snakes and octopi, bear some
resemblance to their forms from
the first game, but otherwise the
visual style is entirely new. The
enemies have rather comical
expressions on their faces, with
bulging eyes or contorted features,
which is an amusing recurring
element in the series. Annoyingly,
in the arcade version, a huge
chunk of the screen is taken up by
the status window, which makes
the action feel cramped.
 
The arcade version of Wonder
Boy in Monster Land was officially
only published in Japan, for the
Sega System 2 board. However,
there are two bootleg versions
translated into English that were
distributed around the world. An
English version was originally
made by Westone back in 1987,
but Sega chose not to release it.
This only became available in
2012, when it appeared on the
Wii Virtual Console, XBLA and
PSN as a downloadable title. The
translation is the same one used in
the European computer ports.

Due to the awkward
distribution of the arcade game,
Monster Land is mostly known for
its Sega Master System port. Like
most SMS ports, it keeps much of
the original’s gameplay,
downgrades the graphics only
slightly, and even gets rid of the
obnoxious status window. All vital
data is now at the top of the
screen, with all equipment located
in the pause menu. The artists
were nice enough to give the hero
some clothes at the beginning of
the game.
 The physics have changed
slightly, especially in regards to
taking damage – in the arcade
game, if you are hit multiple times
in succession, it resets the
invulnerability period and allows
you to be juggled, though without
taking any damage. This is not
present in the Master System
version. The multidirectional
screen scrolling in larger levels
is also gone, replaced by
flip-screen movement.
 
In the arcade game, any
enemy that took multiple hits had
a life indicator, but in the SMS
version this is reserved for boss
monsters. Most of the pop-up
text, like the windows describing
enemy names or item pick-ups,
has been removed. However,
unlike so many video games that
have been censored to remove
references to alcohol, you can still
buy pints of ale or mead. The level
order has changed slightly, and
there’s one totally brand new
stage featuring a largely
abandoned town, inhabited by a
couple of new bosses, including a
Wizard and Medusa. Roughly half
of the soundtrack is missing, with
the same two songs used in
multiple areas.
 
The game is technically a bit
easier since there are less enemies
throughout the stages, and the
boss patterns are substantially
simplified, but ultimately it’s more
frustrating because, unlike the
arcade game, you can’t continue.
At all. You get a single revival
potion, and can buy replacements,
but death comes too easily.
Born From Stickers?
The PC Engine version, released
by Hudson only in Japan, is a
pretty faithful port from the
arcade. It was tied in with the
popular 1980s property
Bikkuriman, which was a “sticker
collection“ series. The hero is now
known as “Head Rococo“, and all
of the sprites and shopkeeper
graphics have changed to tie in
with Bikkuriman. Otherwise it is
very close to the arcade game,
missing only minor details, like the
door opening animations and the
post-level bonus screens. You can
also continue through use of a
code. There are several other
Bikkuriman games (ranging from
the Famicom to the Game Boy
Color), although none of them are
related to the Wonder Boy or
Monster World series.
Wonder Boy in Monster Land
was also ported to the Famicom,
though with a totally different title
and altered characters, under the
name Saiyuuki World and
published by Jaleco. Based on the
old Chinese legend, you are the
monkey king Goku, off to save
ancient China.
While the graphics and music
are entirely different, the gameplay
is almost exactly the same. Most
of the enemies are similar,
including the mushrooms and
snakes, though the bosses are
entirely new, and the crabs are
replaced with alligators for some
reason. After many boss battles
you also free a prisoner, who
congratulates you for your efforts.
Some of the level designs have
changed a bit, shortening many of
the areas and adding more shops.
 
Unfortunately, it’s hard to
shake the feeling that it’s a
sloppy, hacked together product.
The new music is atrocious, and
enemies can juggle you infinitely
while still dealing damage, making
one hit kills from bosses
frustratingly common.
 
There was a Saiyuuki World II
released as well, which was
released in America by Jaleco as
Whomp ’Em. In the localized
version the main character was
changed from Goku to an Indian,
and other graphics were altered to
fit the Native American theme.
 
Activision published a number
of computer ports in Europe. All of
these were based on the arcade
version, rather than the Master
System release. The ZX Spectrum
and Amstrad CPC versions are
practically identical, suffering from
113
Above: [ARC] Further adventures of
Wonder Boy
Right: The goofy [AMI] cover
Below: [FC] Unfortunately Saiyuuki World
is not a good conversion

slow action and the usual limited
palette. The C64 version is a
definite step up, although it’s still
a bit slow. However, the Atari ST
and Amiga versions are pretty
decent. The colors are a bit off,
the action is slightly slow, the
scrolling is a bit choppy and the
load times are awful.
 
Perhaps the most bizarre
version out of all of this is the
mobile version, first developed in
2006 by Hudson in English under
the name Super Adventure Island
(no relation to the SNES game of
the same name), and later released
in Japan in 2010 under the name
Shin Takahashi-Meijin no
Boukenjima (not to be confused
with Takahashi-Meijin no Shin
Boukenjima, the PC Engine
semi-sequel to the original
Famicom game). This version
replaces Wonder Boy with Master
Higgins/Takahashi Meijin. The
graphics are all new and pretty
decent too. The swords are now
hammers, though they act the
same, and while the standard
monsters are the same as before,
all of the bosses are brand new, at
least from a visual standpoint. The
shopkeepers are different as well.
In Brazil, many Master System
games were tied in with children’s
programs to make them more
appealing to the masses - some of
these games include Teddy Boy,
Ghost House, and Kung Fu Kid.
Brazilian software publisher TecToy
took three of the Wonder Boy
games – Monster Land, The
Dragon’s Trap and Monster World –
and added in characters of a
massively popular (in Brazil)
comic/cartoon series called Turma
da Mônica. Each game remained
exactly the same, except for
Mônica characters playing the role
of the hero. Mônica uses a blue
rabbit as a sword, which is
somewhat amusing. In Dragon’s
Trap, instead of taking on
different animal forms, you save
your friends, who would then lend
you different powers. The dragon
form has been changed into a guy
with a shotgun. The mouse form
has been changed into a dog. The
bird form has been changed into a
superhero-esque character who
can fly. All of these look like
amateur ROM hacks but they
were commercially released, and
entirely legal.

Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair
AKA: Monster Lair (US TG16)
Original Release: 1988
Platforms: AC, TG16CD, MD,
PS2, WII, WIN
Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a
departure from both the previous
games, but like Monster Land,
blends two seemingly disparate
genres: the platformer and the
shooter. The basic set up is similar
to the first Wonder Boy, in that
you can only take a single hit,
there’s a timer at the top of the
screen, and there’s plenty of fruit
to collect in order to refill it.
However, the screen auto-scrolls
all of the time, similar to certain
stages in Super Mario Bros. 3.
The main characters have
swords, but use them to fire
projectiles. Weapon power-ups are
common, including shurikens that
rotate around your character,
lasers, spread bullets and explosive
rockets. The invincibility fairies and
stamina-sapping reapers from the
first Wonder Boy are also back.
The second part of each level,
where you fight the boss, also
grants you a flying dragon, making
the game feel more like a
traditional shooter. Many of the
enemy’s projectiles in these
segments are beach balls, which
drain stamina rather than killing
you outright.
 
This is the only Wonder Boy
game that offers two-player
simultaneous gameplay. The first
player controls the green-haired
warrior Leo, and the second
controls the pink haired princess
Purapril. Despite the change in
genre, there are plenty of
references to the previous two
titles to maintain some consistency
between them.
The first level is a tropical
stage, similar to the ones found in
the other games, and the tenth
stage looks like the towns in
Monster Land, complete with the
walking mushrooms. The later
stages also veer into sci-fi
territory, with the last area taking
place in outer space as you fight
against UFOs. The final enemy
appears to be the hero from
Monster Land, but is actually
revealed to be an alien entity that
stole the Legendary equipment
from those games and used its
power for evil.
 
While conceptually Monster
Lair is unlike anything else out
there, it’s also really just a slightly
above average game. At 14 stages
it’s too long, and the levels don’t
vary much outside of changing
scenery. At least the game looks
pretty, especially the ridiculous
boss fights, like the giant
mushroom/slot machine mutation.
Monster Lair was initially
released in the arcades for the
Sega System 16 board. There
were two home versions of the
game. The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-
16 release is almost an exact port
of the arcade game, with the usual
CD soundtrack tossed in. The
graphics are basically identical,
although the parallax scrolling was
removed. This is the only time that
the Wonder Boy name was
attached to a game that wasn’t on
115

a Sega platform. The port to the
TurboGrafx-16 was also the only
version of this game released on a
console in North America,
although the Wonder Boy name
was dropped and the game simply
titled Monster Lair.
Sega also ported it to the
Mega Drive for Japan and Europe.
Although the background graphics
look comparable, most of the
sprites had to be redrawn, and all
of them (both the main characters
and bosses) look pretty dorky in
comparison. These versions only

The first Wonder Boy game
created strictly for consoles,
Wonder Boy III: The Dragon’s Trap
focuses on solid action-
adventuring, and the result stands
right next to Phantasy Star as one
of the best games on the Sega
Master System.
In a move that perhaps
inspired the intro to Castlevania:
Symphony of the Night, Wonder
Boy III actually begins at the end
of Wonder Boy in Monster Land,
as you traipse through the castle
(thankfully simplified from the
original maze) and fight the final
boss, the Meka Dragon.
Unfortunately, as you deal the
killing blow, the monster curses
you, turning you into a dragon
humanoid. Once you escape the
collapsing castle you must venture
through the land to find the
Salamander Cross, the only item
that can rid you of this curse.
While you begin the game as
Lizard Man, you will change forms
every time you kill a boss. At the
beginning you’re stuck in your
current form, but as you progress
you can find special rooms that let
you transform at will. Each form
has different skills and attributes.
Lizard Man is the initial form,
and is actually quite powerful.
Rather than wielding a sword, you
shoot out fireballs (though you still
equip swords for attack power
boosts). Though this form lacks a
shield, you can use said fireballs to
block projectiles. You can also
swim harmlessly through lava
without the use of the Dragon
Armor. He is also the only form
that can duck.
Mouse Man is difficult to use
because his sword is so tiny.
However, he can fit through small
openings and climb on
checkerboard bricks. Meanwhile,
Piranha Man lets you swim – being
underwater in most other forms
just slows you down.
Lion/Tiger Man (the form
depends on the version of the
game) is the most physically
powerful. He swings his sword at
an arc, allowing you to attack
above and below. He can also
break bricks without equipping the
Thunder Saber sword. Finally, as
expected, Hawk Man can fly.
However, he is the most
physically fragile, and is actually
damaged by water.
Several different dragons
must be killed throughout your
adventure, each with some sort of
theme: the Egyptian stage has a
mummy dragon, the jungle stage
has a zombie dragon, the
underwater pirate ship level has a
pirate dragon, the Japanese level
has a samurai dragon and so forth.
Wonder Boy III ditches the
level-by-level structure in favor of
a more open world you can freely
explore. The hub is a single central
town, which splinters off in
multiple directions. Much like
Metroid, good chunks are off limits
until you gain the proper animal

form to reach them. While the
route through the game is pretty
explicit – you won’t get lost for
too long – you can explore at your
leisure, revisiting areas with new
skills to find hidden heart
containers and extra equipment.
 
The world structure though is
largely nonsensical. If you fall
down the well, you’ll somehow
end up on a tropical beach, while
if you fly into the sky, you’ll find
the game’s equivalent to Egypt.
It’s one of those “video gamey“
aspects that lends it a surreal
nature. Magic works in much the
same way as in Monster Land,
with fallen monsters randomly
dropping limited use items, though
now you can select them from the
pause screen, and they’re cast by
holding down and jump.
Most of the annoying bits
from Monster Land have been
dealt with: the timer is gone, as is
the score, and you can now save
your progress with passwords.
However, some of the new RPG
mechanics don’t quite work. The
biggest issue has to do with your
Charm Points, or CP. This is
basically the equivalent of the
Charisma stat in tabletop RPGs,
and determines what items the
shopkeepers will sell you.
However, you’re never told what
the requirements are – if your CP
is too low, potential items are
simply shown as inaccessible
question marks.
Your CP is determined by
your equipment, your current
form, and by rare items called
charm stones. The logic behind
this is probably that a shopkeeper
wouldn’t want to sell anything to
a grotesque fish/man thing with
ugly armor, but would be more
willing to part with their goods to
something more adorable with
fancier goods.
You can sort of cheat the
game to find these, but it’s still
needless grinding. The game
doesn’t keep track of opened
treasure chests, so you can find a
hidden cache, get a password,
reset and hunt down the same
chest, repeating this until you’re
powered up.
The only other major issue is
with the rather straightforward
level design. Many stages are just
long, linear paths and repeated
environments, albeit with enemy
variations. Dying on a boss battle
and having to repeat the same
endless corridors quickly grows
tedious. And later levels are
hectic, as the game tosses tons of
bad guys on the screen.
Projectiles inflict a huge
amount of damage regardless of
your defensive stats, so learning
to block them is essential for
survival, but there are many times
where dealing with it all at once is
practically impossible without
taking some damage. The post-
damage invincibility period is
implemented like in the arcade
version of Monster Land,
thankfully, so you can absorb
multiple attacks while only taking
a single hit’s worth of damage.
Still, outside of these issues,
Wonder Boy III: The Dragon’s Trap
is an utterly brilliant game. The
graphics are substantially
improved over even the arcade
version of Monster Land, taking a
cue from the cutesy goofiness
found in Monster Lair. The
characters are large, distinctive,
and strangely adorable, the
monsters actually seem to have
personality, while the locales are
colorful and lively. The music is
also completely fantastic, even if
some themes (particularly the
main dungeon song) get repeated
too often. It’s one of the crowning
jewels of the Sega Master System
for a reason.
The Master System version of
the game was not released in
Japan, remaining a North
American and European exclusive.
Instead, the first version to reach
Japan was Hudson’s PC
Engine/TurboGrafx-16 release,
118

known (confusingly) as Adventure
Island in Japan and Dragon’s
Curse in North America. In any
case, it’s largely identical to the
Master System release.
What little text there is differs
quite a bit from the SMS version
(the opening warns you of bad
guys that can turn you into a
“totally disgusting creature“) and
some of the character sprites have
been changed. The human form
has blond hair, like the previous
games, instead of green hair like
the Sega version’s hero. The
Lizard Man form looks different,
and the lion has been changed into
a tiger. The frame rate is also
smoother. Otherwise, the
improvements are minor. If you
have a Turbo Booster or CD-ROM
system, you can also save your
game, although the password
system is still available.
In Japan, Sega released the
game in 1992 for the Game Gear
under the name Monster World II:
Dragon no Wana. It’s mostly the
same as the Master System
version, through since the view is
zoomed in to make up for the
smaller resolution, many of the
areas have been slightly
redesigned, and some of the larger
rooms have simply been removed.
You can also transport back to the
hub town by using charm stones.
In general the game is slightly
easier too. There’s also a new,
much cooler, title screen and a
new song to go with it.
Wonder Boy in Monster Land
was filled with weird looking
shopkeepers, but the wackiest one
is the password guy from The
Dragon’s Trap. It’s not clear why
he is also in charge of the church,
but obviously the religious folk in
Monster Land have no problem
with a purple chain smoking pirate
pig running their establishments.
Also note how the cigarette and
the crosses of the church shows
Sega’s apathetic nature towards
censorship, compared to
Nintendo’s fervent policies of
protecting American youths during
the olden days. Unfortunately, he
was taken out of the Game Gear
version, replaced by more normal
looking humans.
The Master System version
also has an item called the Hades
Armor, which revives you to full
health when you die. It’s supposed
to be a consumable item, but due
to some glitches, it’s possible to
keep it after regeneration, thereby
basically making you immortal.
This glitch was removed from the
other versions.

Wonder Boy in Monster World
AKA: Wonder Boy V: Monster
World III (JP MD), The Dynastic
Hero (TG16)
Original Release: 1991
Platforms: GEN, TG16, SMS,
360, PS3, WII, WIN
The fifth Wonder Boy title (and
third Monster World game) leaves
behind the tale of Book, and
instead concentrates on a new
hero, a blue-haired boy named
Shion. It’s another action-RPG,
similar in structure to The
Dragon’s Trap, but keeping some
elements closer to the first
Monster Land.
 
Most disappointingly, there
are no longer multiple forms to
change into, as Shion is a human
throughout. He can wield two
types of weapons: swords, which
are short-ranged but can be used
in conjunction with shields, and
spears, which are longer but lack
proper protection. However, many
items let you obtain skills similar to
the ones in the previous game, like
the Poseidon Spear, which lets you
swim, and the pygmy transform-
ation, which lets you squeeze into
small places.
Instead of multiple forms, in
different parts of the game you are
accompanied by a tiny familiar, a
reference to the fairies from the
original Wonder Boy. Priscilla is a
fairy who can heal; Hotta is a
dwarf child who can dig for gold;
Shabo is a tiny Grim Reaper who
can attack with his scythe; and
Rotto is a young dragon child.
They’re adorable, but their use is
limited to specific dungeons.
 
The magic system has been
improved, as you now learn spells
rather than gathering individually
used items. These spells have
limited stocks, but are expanded
as you discover more, and
regenerate when you visit an inn.
You can assign two spells at once,
activated by pressing the A button
and hitting either left or right.
The dungeons also feel like
dungeons now, instead of just
long, linear paths, and the world
design is slightly more cohesive.
There are many more hidden items
compared to The Dragon’s Trap,
where most of the heart containers
were fairly easy to find. The
Charm Points system has been
abolished, and there are multiple
towns rather than just a single
central hub city. The password
system is gone, replaced by a
battery save.
 
Unfortunately, the action
itself isn’t nearly as exciting as
The Dragon’s Trap. Like Monster
Land, your speed is based on the
type of boots you have, but even
at the fastest speed, you move
relatively slowly. Combined with
the short range of both weapon
types, it’s a much more leisurely
paced game, and one that doesn’t
feel as fun to play.
 
The visuals are nice, but not
drastically improved over its
Master System predecessor. Once
again, the status bar is a little too
large, though the life bars for all
enemies are rather handy. The
close-ups of the shopkeepers are
gone, and instead the exterior of
the house becomes transparent
when Shion enters. The music,

while decent, is also a little too
low key in many areas.
 
There are also plenty of
references to the older Wonder
Boy games. The second screen is
practically identical to the opening
of Monster Land. Right at the
beginning, Shion rescues Princess
Purapril, the descendant of the
second player character in
Monster Lair, who in turn gives
her name to the town. Some of
the enemies, like the colorful fish
in Poseidon’s Realm, are taken
from Monster Lair as well.
There’s another encounter
with the Sphinx. She actually
looks like the statue found in The
Dragon’s Trap, and her quiz
questions are now about specific
things from earlier in the game.
Even the finale, where the fantasy
trappings give way to futuristic
technology, is largely the same.
 
There are a few difficulty
tweaks between the regional
versions. In the Japanese release,
dying sends you back to an inn
with some reduced cash, while the
English versions will send you to a
Game Over screen, requiring the
reloading of a save game. The final
boss is also more difficult in the
English release, with buzz saws
having been added to the floor.
 
Initially released on the
Genesis, Wonder Boy in Monster
World was also ported to the
Master System and released in
Europe. While graphically it looks
gorgeous, some technical
problems keep it back. Your sword
has an even shorter range, you
can’t buy spears anymore, and the
hit detection is awfully shady. The
save feature is also gone, replaced
with some very long passwords.
 
The TurboGrafx-16 CD
version, published once again by
Hudson, is known as The Dynastic
Hero. As with the previous games,
the plotline and characters have
been changed completely, as the
hero, now named Dyna, wears an
extremely dorky blue suit of armor
and a beetle shaped helmet. The
rest of the characters follow the
insect theme too, with completely
new familiars and bosses, though
the standard enemies are
unchanged. The dragon village
(and its accompanying familiar)
has also been changed into a bee
village. The CD audio soundtrack
is entirely different to the music in
the Genesis version. The
background graphics are pretty
much the same, although there’s a
nifty animated intro complete with
an incredibly cheesy vocal song.
The translation is also slightly
different, with a bit more
character. The difficulty was not
changed for the localized version,
so it’s easier than the English
release of Monster World.

Monster World IV
Original Release: 1994
Platforms: MD, 360, PS3, WII
Monster World IV is the only
mainline entry in the series without
the “Wonder Boy“ moniker. This
actually makes total sense,
considering the protagonists is
now a green-haired Arabian girl
named Asha. The vaguely generic
fantasy settings of the previous
Monster World games have been
replaced with a fanciful Arabian
setting, making it feel a bit like
Disney’s Aladdin from around the
same era, albeit with a cutesy,
manga flair. The story really hasn’t
changed much though, with Asha
being chosen to leave her village
to rescue some missing spirits and
save the world in the process.
 
With this final entry in the
series, the RPG elements have
been scaled down considerably.
There is only a single city,
Rapadagna, which as usual acts as
the hub for the four sub-worlds,
which take the form of different
temples. However, there’s no real
overworld to explore, as you are
immediately transported to each of
the four sub-worlds through a
central temple in the city. In turn,
these areas are almost entirely
linear, although you can still grab
gold to buy equipment in town, as
well as health replenishments from
the various vending machines
found throughout.
 
While Monster World IV
barely qualifies as an action-RPG
any more, as a trade-off, the
platforming is easily the best it’s
ever been. To aid you in your
quest, Asha finds a cute flying
blob called a Pepelogoo. She can
grab onto it to float, use it to
double jump, or throw it at
switches. It’s also resistant to fire,
so she can carry it on her head as
a shield or toss it on flaming lava
to use as a platform.
 
The dungeon designs are far
more elaborate than the previous
games, largely because they rely
on using your Pepelogoo to
traverse the terrain. Alas, the tasks
presented can only vaguely be
called “puzzles“, as most are quite
simplistic. Perhaps in order to
make up for the lack of exploration
the dungeons are also long, really
long, usually with multiple boss
battles. Unfortunately the game
doesn’t think up enough
interesting things to do to justify
their length, so dungeons begin to
grow tiresome after awhile.
 
Other than slightly hidden
chests and the usual caches of
money, the only optional items to
find are crystal tears spread
throughout each stage. Collect 10
of these and you’ll gain an extra
heart on your second life meter.
This acts as a backup to the main
life meter, which in turn is
expanded by purchasing new
armor. However, very few of these
are actually hidden, so the number
of secrets compared to previous
games is reduced.
 
The combat has been
changed a bit too. Unlike the
previous heroes, who kept their
122

shield out at all times, Asha needs
to press down to pull out her
shield. Magic spells are also gone,
forcing you into melee combat
against everything. You can,
however, jump and thrust
downward, and even bounce on
enemy heads, expanding your
combat strategy slightly.
 
Even though it’s largely a
step back for the series, it’s hard
not to like Monster World IV. Asha
is one of the most adorable
heroines to appear in a video
game, largely thanks to her
expressive and fluid animations.
She runs like a proper little lady,
arms swaying to her side, and
wiggles her butt when opening up
treasure chests. When she jumps,
you can see the wind against her
baggy pants. The rest of the
visuals are similarly gorgeous,
taking advantage of the 16-bit
hardware in ways that Wonder
Boy in Monster World didn’t even
attempt. Every screen is bursting
with vibrant color, side-stepping
the grainy graphics usually seen in
Genesis titles.
This is also the only Monster
World game not composed by
Shinichi Sakamoto, with the duties
passed onto Jin Watanabe. The
title screen theme acts as an
overture, with many of the later
songs offering variations on the
same melody. The entirety of the
soundtrack is definitely quite
catchy, though due to the
recurring motifs, they do tend to
grow a bit repetitive.
 
Despite the change in setting,
the aesthetics are clearly in line
with the other Monster World
games. Furthermore, the four
spirits to be rescued are the same
as the familiars from the previous
game and there’s even a reference
to the fate of Shion.
 
Even though Monster World
IV has gorgeous graphics and solid
gameplay, Sega elected not to
localize it when it was initially
released. Although it was fan
translated by DemiForce and
DeJap in 2002, the game was
officially localized nearly 20 years
after release, in 2012, available
via digital distribution for the Wii,
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The
official translation is more faithful
than the fan translation, and also
uses a nicer font.

Sega or Hudson developed all of
the other ports. The only version
we ported was the Game Gear
version of Monster World II. We
made it more fun, too.
How was the original Wonder Boy
conceived?
I wanted to make an action game
with the feeling of pressure.
Therefore I made a horizontal
scrolling platformer where the
player could not stop moving. It
was too difficult, and I was unable
to play it, so I regretfully had to
change it. That became Wonder
Boy. The skateboarding item is a
remnant of the initial plan.
Was this auto-scrolling idea from
the first Wonder Boy the
inspiration for Wonder Boy III:
Monster Lair?
Your inference is not bad. But, the
answer is no. Because Monster
Lair had two players at the same
time, it was easier to play an
automatically scrolling game.
Can you elaborate on the
relationship between Westone and
Hudson? Did Sega actually own
the Wonder Boy character? Many
of the Wonder Boy games were
released on non-Sega platforms by
Hudson, but starring different
characters, like Takahashi Meijin,
Bikkuriman and the beetle guy in
Dynastic Hero.
“Wonder Boy“ is only a trademark
that Sega owns. My company
owns all of the copyrights.
Therefore, there is no problem in
letting the Wonder Boy character
appear in any game that Hudson
releases. However, Hudson almost
always changed the character...
Why was that? I once politely
asked the staff at Hudson, but
they would not tell me.
Was there any communication
between the Hudson team that
made Takahashi Meijin and
Westone? The later games in that
series (the fourth for the Famicom
series, the second for the Super
Famicom) seem to borrow heavily
from the Monster World structure.
My company was not involved
with the game design for the
Adventure Island series at all. I’m
not really familiar with Adventure
Island 4 and Super Adventure
Island 2 either. Of course, my
company still approves the license.
I did, however, supervise the first
Super Adventure Island. But
otherwise, the staff at Hudson
developed them on their own.
What prompted the switch from
the straight-up platforming of
Wonder Boy to the action-RPG
mechanics of Monster Land?
It’s because I got absorbed in
Wizardry. After Wonder Boy was
Interview with Ryuichi Nishizawa
124

released we played that legendary
game every day while avoiding
work. Therefore, I wanted to
combine RPG elements with an
action game.
Is the character from Wonder Boy
(Tom-Tom), supposed to be the
same character from Wonder Boy
in Monster Land (Bocke)?
I’ll leave it your imagination
whether they are the same
character. By the way, Tom-Tom
and Tanya are not the names that
I originally gave them. They were
initially called Bocke and Tina.
Tom-Tom may be the name given
by Sega for the overseas editions.
What were Monster Land’s
biggest influences? I thought
maybe Tower of Druaga or Dragon
Buster, since they both combine
action and RPG elements in an
arcade setting.
I often played Tower of Druaga
and Dragon Buster, but I don’t like
either of them very much. They
made me irritated, maybe because
in both there is no one to talk to in
the stages. On the other hand,
there was no one to talk to in
Wizardry either. Haha! But, I love
the music of Dragon Buster.
Have you seen the European
console ports? They have some...
interesting artwork. Personally, it
looks more like Wonder Boy is
wearing a diaper than a loincloth.
I did not know there was a version
of Monster Land for the Amiga. I
tried looking at Youtube in order to
verify its quality.  It looks like the
real thing. I was not aware of its
existence. That costume was also
known as a diaper even in Japan.
Because it was so amusing, I was
quite fond of it. I even used it as
my icon on Twitter. On the
Amiga, I must’ve played
F1 World Championship a million
times. Game software back then,
that was the most realistic game
on the Amiga, with beautiful
graphics. Those were the good
old days.
The original Monster Land didn’t
seem to have an official English
arcade release, but there was a
(badly translated into English)
bootleg. Are you familiar with this,
or is there any story behind it that
you’re aware of?
Yes, I am aware of it. It’s in
MAME, isn’t it? Hardware is
always evolving. When I want to
check on a game I developed in
the past, I use MAME. It is a very
convenient program. :-) At that
time, I knew there was an English
version. I did not know whether it
was a pirated edition. Because I
am interested in making new
products, I do not mind these
things from the past.
The recent Virtual Console / XBLA
/ PSN versions of Monster Land
use the same English translation
as the European 8-bit computer
ports from many years before. Do
you know why this was? Was
there originally an official English
translation that just wasn’t
released?
I developed the English version of
Monster Land in 1987. When the
staff of Sega was in charge of the
English translation, I kept a record
of it. In other words, the English
(computer) versions were based
off this translation. But I do not
know whether Sega sold the
English (arcade) version abroad.
The English version delivered this
time is based on the master ROM
from 1987. The producer of this
project found the ROM looking in a
Sega warehouse. Therefore this is
a completely genuine article.
Is there any particular story behind
that smoking, eye-patch wearing
pig in Monster World II who runs a
shop? He’s such a silly character!
One of the designers drew that on
their own. The instructions I gave
her was to create “a character like
an animal but not an animal“.
Thank you for liking the
“one-eyed pig“.
In Japan, Monster World III for the
Mega Drive was technically
released before Monster World II
for the Game Gear. How did this
come to be?
When we were working on
Monster World III and the Game
Gear was released, Sega wanted
to port Monster World II from the
SMS to the GG. However, the GG
is a portable game machine with a
tiny LCD screen, so it was difficult
to port without compromising the
game. It was necessary to remake
the game because of the small
screen. I then decided to develop
the remake myself. This was the
only port developed in-house.
Since I made Monster World II
twice, I was able to perfect it.
Do you know why Monster World
IV was not released outside of
Japan until recently? It’s such a
beautiful game, that it seems odd
Sega would not localize it when it
was initially published.
I do not know the reason. At that
time, Sega of America and Sega
of Europe just decided not to sell
it. They may have thought it
would not have been commercially
successful. Alternatively, there
may have been other big titles at
the time, and they may just have
been too busy.
125

Was there a specific reason behind
moving away from “Wonder Boy“
and putting in Asha, the female
hero, in Monster World IV?
Because of the constantly
changing nature of the series, it
was necessary to come up with
something new and different from
MW3. With good intentions, I
wanted to betray the expectations
of the fans, but in a good way.
About the protagonist becoming
female, there were some pros and
cons, some from within the team,
but I was glad to change it to a
girl. Asha’s running animation is
incredibly adorable.
Was Westone involved in the
recent Sega Vintage Monster
World collection? If so, did
Westone or Sega handle the new
translation of Monster World IV?
My company was not involved in
the development of the Monster
World Vintage Collection, we only
granted the license. We left it to
Yosuke Okunari, a producer at
Sega. He has the nickname “Game
Archaeologist“, as he is a big fan
of retro games. His passion for
retro games is second to none. It’s
no exaggeration to say that the
Monster World Vintage Collection
was born from his obsession. If
you play some of the Sega
Vintage series that have been
released, you will be able to
understand his passion.
The translation of MW4, under his
supervision, was a brand new
product. We have heard that his
translation was completely redone.
His uncompromised enthusiasm is
amazing. I am very grateful to
him. Because of him, you are able
to play the MW series on big
screen televisions.
Have you played Shantae, which
feels to many like a spiritual
successor of Monster World IV? If
so, what are your thoughts on it?
I only found out about Shantae
just recently. It was never released
in Japan. Recently, I downloaded
Shantae: Risky’s Revenge for the
iPhone and played it. There is
indeed a similarity to MW4. The
heroine and the world are all
drawn with beautiful 2D graphics,
and the excellent controls are all
aspects it has in common with the
MW series. My impression is that
Shantae is a very high quality
game. WayForward’s staff are
very talented. In Japan, 2D
graphics designers are becoming
rare. I would like to release 2D
games on a regular basis from
now on.

World game?
Monster World II. I loved it so
much I made it twice.
Are you familiar with how the
series was handled in Brazil? The
games now star characters from
the Monica’s Gang series.
Yes, I am familiar with it. Because
of the popularity of Monica in
Brazil, Wonder Boy was able to
draw fans over there. There is
even a fan page for it on
Facebook, but unfortunately I
cannot read Portuguese. :-(
Is there any chance for a new
Monster World or Wonder Boy
installment in the future?
Yes, I’d like to make one if I have
the opportunity. I have ideas for
both Wonder Boy and Monster
World already in my head. Of
course, I want to make both in
3D. I want to start from creating
an image of the world, but where
to find a good 3D artist?
Where do you think a new
Monster World game would work
best; digital distribution platforms
(such as WiiWare, XBLA and
PSN), handheld consoles or
television consoles?
It is a very puzzling problem.
Because I want the world of
Monster World to be filled with
deep emotion slowly and carefully,
a console game may be better.
But, as for me, a handheld game
may be better because I want
children to play. Please tell me
which game platform is
appropriate for MW.
How do you feel about so many
independent Western developers
taking inspiration from Japanese
games of the 1980s and 1990s?
I was a boy who loved movies. I
was very impressed when
watching Close Encounters of the
Third Kind and Star Wars in the
movie theaters. It was an
opportunity and I came to think
that I wanted to do creative work
such as filmmaking. My production
activity is always affected by
movies, from Hollywood in
particular. In other words, I get
inspiration from Western creators,
too. The game industry has
become huge. Therefore game
developers must make products
for a global market. In the near
future, the developer of various
countries will combine teams and
will come to develop a game.
The PC Engine game Blood Gear is
referred to as “Aurail Scenario 2“
in the credits. Is it meant to be a
sequel to the Sega arcade game?
How did this development come
about? It seems to parallel Wonder
Boy, in that it started out as an
arcade game, then became an
action-RPG for consoles.
That’s an extremely geeky
question (laughs). I didn’t even
126

think Blood Gear or Aurail were
released in foreign countries. I
don’t even think there’s anyone in
Japan who can answer this
question! (laughs)
I think that calling it “Aurail
Scenario 2“ was a joke from the
younger staff members developing
Blood Gear. Aurail was produced
for and known by hardcore
gamers. Did you enjoy it?
In 2006, a soundtrack was
published for an unreleased
Westone game called Tokei Jikake
no Aquario. Unfortunately
information about this game is
scarce. Do you remember anything
about it, or why it was not
released? There’s only one
screenshot currently out there,
and it looks like it has a really cool
visual style similar to the Monster
World games. (On a side note, you
wouldn’t happen to have any more
screenshots or art still remaining
from this game, would you?)
Aquario of the Clockwork was the
last arcade game developed by my
company. I had been working and
suffering for a long time to
complete it, but the location test
results were poor. It was an
eccentric action game with three-
player simultaneous play. The
graphics were quite excellent, but
it was not released, unfortunately.
The program is located in the
archives of my company, so I do
not have any screenshots. If
Aquario of the Clockwork were
released as part of the Sega
Vintage Collection, would people
be interested in buying it? I would
be very interested to know. :-)
After our interview, Nishizawa
searched the company archives to
uncover Aquario of the Clockwork
and attempt to restore it into a
playable state. He was able to
extract the below image of the
player characters, with the
message “Hajimemashite“, or
“Nice to meet you“.
Nishizawa also set up a page on
Facebook to communicate with
fans. It can be found at
http://www.facebook.com/pages/
MW-FAN/465366220145115
If the URL is a bit long, you can
search for it by typing “MW FAN“
into the Facebook search box.
He has posted previously unseen
artwork, including a male player
character originally slated for
Monster World IV that had to be
removed due to ROM constraints.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Quartet seems to have come about
by taking Midway’s Gauntlet and
turning it into a side-scrolling
shooter. While the basics – the
four player simultaneous action,
the draining life-meter, the monster
generators – are all clearly inspired
by it, Quartet drastically reworks
all of these concepts into
something unique.
A Party of Four
There are four different characters,
each with a distinctive weapon –
Lee, clad in blue and sporting a
conspicuously 1980s mustache,
has a wide beam; Joe, wearing
yellow and being the generic good
guy, has a “speed gun“; Mary, the
sole lady and clad in red, has a
bazooka; and Edger, with a bald
head and keen visor, wearing
green, wields the “miracle gun“.
The quartet of warriors has
been sent to a space colony
named Zero-6, which has been
taken over by space pirates. The
goal in each stage is to find the
boss monster, kill it to obtain a key
and unlock the door to the next
area. In the first few stages, the
boss can easily be found hanging
out right by the exit, but in later
areas it usually takes a bit of
searching before you can find the
monster. The levels are fairly small
though, and only scroll
horizontally, so if you stumble
across the exit before the boss,
it’s just a matter of doubling back.
 
The stages are also littered
with power-ups. The most
common allow you to jump higher,
walk faster, or even grant you a jet
pack to fly, but you’ll also
routinely see bouncing colored
balls of energy. As you shoot
them, they’ll cycle through four
colors – if you grab it when it
corresponds to the color of your
player, then your weapon will be
strengthened. It’s best not to get
too attached to these powers,
though, seeing as you’ll drop most
of them any time you take
damage, and you lose them when
you go to the next stage anyway.
 
Beyond the four player
simultaneous action, there are
numerous other traces of
Gauntlet’s inspiration, although
they’ve been tampered with. The
stages are filled with enemy
generators, which constantly pump
out bad guys, but there’s no way
to destroy or even damage them.
Your characters’ health is
determined by a numerical gauge,
starting at 9000, and depletes
slowly over time, as well as when
taking damage. However, the
counter is actually quite slow, and
since Quartet is never as relenting
with its bad guys as Gauntlet, it
doesn’t feel like it was cynically
designed to gobble your quarters
as fast as possible. Ultimately it’s
made redundant because there’s
an invisible timer anyway, which
will send a grim reaper after your
characters if you take too long.

As a single-player game
Quartet is only barely interesting.
Apart from the amount of time it
takes you to recover from a hit
and the need to retrieve any
dropped items, both of which are
annoyances, the game feels rather
rote. On the other hand, these
mechanics make sense when put
in a multiplayer perspective.
 
The dynamic changes
completely when played with two
or more people which, as the
name implies, is the way it was
meant to be played. There’s a
unique cooperative/competitive
dynamic that’s constantly
changing, because while all of the
players have the same goal in
common, they’re also all
competing for score; throughout
each stage there are score items
and multipliers. Furthermore, at
the end of the stage, everyone is
ranked according to performance,
with the player who opened the
door gaining the most points.
While you can’t directly harm
other players, you can bounce off
their heads, potentially screwing
them up just enough so they can
get hit by an enemy and drop their
key, allowing you to grab the glory
for yourself.
 
Visually, Quartet is decent
looking, though the handful of
environments – outer space, cave,
ruins, ducts, and base – are
recycled throughout. The sprites
are small and a bit dorky, but
some of the boss designs are
amusing, especially the one-eyed,
banana-hammock-clad bat
creature. Similarly, the music is
catchy, although with only four or
so tracks played during the whole
game, they can get repetitive. The
punchy FM synth of the Quartet
main theme is on par with other
Sega arcade tracks of the time.
Also notable is the rap theme,
where staticy voice samples
stutter out “S-S-S-S-S-SEGA!“ It’s
not pleasant to listen to, but
remains amusing in that 1980s
“what on earth were they
thinking“ sort of way. A few of
these tracks were also carried over
to Sega’s Spider-Man arcade
game. The soundtrack was
provided by Katsuhiro Hayashi,
who also did the music to SDI,
Gain Ground, Ashura (Rambo First
Blood Part II / Secret Command),
and Hokuto no Ken (Black Belt) for
the Sega Master System.
 
Without the arcade (or online
multiplayer with MAMEHub)
experience, it might be hard to see
what’s so interesting about
Quartet. Four-player games
eventually exploded in popularity
thanks to Konami’s Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, but the
game and its descendants were all
beat-em-ups as opposed to action-
platformers, and none really had
the same competitive thing going
for it. Even now there’s nothing
quite like it; a sort of evolutionary
dead-end that remains an
interesting experiment in
multiplayer gaming.
 
There is also technically a
Quartet 2. In the grand Sega
tradition of releasing “sequels“
that are only minor variations, this
is a conversion kit which is
basically the same, but instead
only allows for two players rather
than four, and each player can
pick their character, as opposed to
being assigned based on which
joystick you pick.
129

 
Quartet was released on the
Commodore 64, Amstrad and
ZX Spectrum, published by
Activision and ported by Core
Design. The Amstrad and
ZX Spectrum versions are similar,
but the ZX Spectrum release is
slightly more colorful.
The Commodore 64 version is
rather slow, and the levels still
suffer from the same rather boring
design. The music is a hacked up
and drastically shortened version
of the theme song, which had the
potential to be decent if it weren’t
so repetitive. Despite the presence
of four status indicators at the top
of the screen, all versions are
simultaneous two-player only.
There are also only fifteen levels in
total. Needless to say, none of
these home computer ports are
particularly worth playing.
Quartet was also kinda-sorta
ported to the Sega Master
System, although it’s really more
of a sequel / spinoff than anything
remotely faithful to the arcade.
Four-player simultaneous play is
impossible on the platform, so the
game’s been scaled back to two
players at the same time. Lee and
Joe are gone, leaving only Mary
(now with a ponytail and a
miniskirt) and Edger.
Master System Oddity
The Japanese version is known as
Double Target: The Sleeping
Cynthia, with the subtitle referring
to the sleeping-in-stasis space
princess your characters are
rescuing. The American and
European versions keep the name
Quartet, making its ties to the
original arcade game more
evident, even though that name
doesn’t suit the conversion at all.
 
There are only six levels, a
massive step back from the 32 of
the arcade game, though most
stages consist of two or three
areas with different background
tiles, as well as unique bosses.
However, you need to find the five
(not quite hidden) stars if you
want to access the final area.
There’s also an actual ending
now, compared to the arcade
game, which looped infinitely. You
now have three lives as opposed
to one, and your energy starts at
10,000, though it counts down
much more quickly. There are also
bottomless pits, which of course
mean instant death. Though there
are a few different weapons, the
bouncing colored power-up orbs
are gone, and many power-ups
have been removed. The monster
generators are also missing, since
now enemies respawn randomly
around the screen.
 
Technically it’s decent
enough. The arcade game just
couldn’t be duplicated given the
hardware, and this just sort of
does its own thing based on the
template of the original. It’s not an
amazing game by any standards –
even as a two-player game it pales
next to something like Contra on
the NES, its closest equivalent –
but it’s more fun as a single-player
game than the arcade version.

Other than the name change,
there’s one other curious alteration
between the regions. In the
Japanese release, Mary looks
similar to the arcade version,
having black hair with bangs, tied
in a ponytail. In the American and
European versions, she has wavy,
medium length brown hair.
Presumably this change was to
make her look more Caucasian,
although even following that line
of logic it’s a bit nonsensical,
because everyone looks like
manga characters anyway.
 
The only arcade perfect
version of Quartet was released in
2005 for the PlayStation 2, as the
21st volume in the Sega Ages
line. Dubbed the Sega System 16
Collection, it’s an extremely
accurate emulation, with
numerous screen display options
to run at 240p, 480p or 480i,
with the ability to add in scanlines.
By default it uses the Quartet 2
ROM set, but if it detects a four-
player adapter, it will run the
original Quartet. Also included is a
bunch of supplemental material,
including a short instruction
manual, as well as both regional
versions of the Master System
port. It’s a nice package, though
some sort of online functionality
would’ve been nice. The disc also
includes SDI (more widely known
for its Master System port, Global
Defense), with all of the same
options as Quartet.
Compared to other
compilations which feature
multiple games, this one feels
scant by only having two,
especially since these two weren’t
particularly popular. Their selection
was the result of an online poll
held by Sega. Around the same
time, a soundtrack CD was also
released containing the music to
both games.
Quartet has not been entirely
forgotten by Sega – the theme
song was remixed, titled Quartet
of Multiple Futures, and included
in the 2010 release Hatsune Miku
Project DIVA Arcade, complete
with vocaloid lyrics.

totally different game

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Thunder Blade
AKA:Super Thunder Blade (GEN)
Original Release: 1987
Platforms: ARC, SMS, GEN,
PCE, IBM, C64, AMI, AST, X68,
CPC, ZX, PS2, PSP, PS3, 360,
WII, WIN
Thunder Blade is one of those mid-
to-late 1980s Sega arcade games
that gets a bad rap. Like many of
its brethren, this was because the
home systems at the time weren’t
nearly powerful enough for faithful
arcade ports. But while After
Burner, Space Harrier, and even
Galaxy Force reaped the benefits
of re-release on 32-bit and later
platforms, Thunder Blade never
got the same treatment.
 
It’s a shame, of course,
because the original arcade game
is actually pretty cool. The concept
was obviously born from one of
Sega’s developers catching Roy
Schneider’s Blue Thunder on TV
late one night and decided to make
a video game loosely based on
helicopters shooting stuff (the title
screen is even a digitized still from
the movie). It runs on the classic
Sega X Board, and uses Sega’s
popular “super scaler“ technique
for some pretty impressive effects.
There are two distinct camera
angles: an overhead, and an over-
the-shoulder viewpoint.
 
The overhead sequences are
impressive; since your helicopter is
angled towards the ground the
view is slightly tilted, which is
unique. Your arsenal includes both
a machine gun and missiles, both
of which have unlimited ammo –
the only difference is their attack
range. In addition to moving left
and right, you can also raise or
lower your altitude, scaling the
ground back and forth with some
impressively smooth animation.
Just watching it in action is
incredibly cool, especially after
you’ve been shot down and take
off back into the skies. The
helicopter has constant momentum
going forward - although
technically you can’t move
forwards and backwards within
the visible playing field, you can
alter your speed, which includes a
super fast turbo mode.
 
There are a number of cool
effects at work here. Other Sega
“super scaler“ games like OutRun
pulled off a bit of visual trickery by
layering several identical tiles one
after another, each positioned and
scaled slightly different from the
last. This gave the impression of a
solid object like, say, a canyon
wall. Obviously the technique
looks a bit cheesy in retrospect,
but it’s remarkable for the time.
Due to its unique perspective,
Thunder Blade does something
different. The buildings and
mountains found throughout the
game are all layered tiles, but each
tile moves at a different speed as
you fly past, which gives the
illusion of depth in a strictly 2D
game, without any fancy use of
polygons. Pretty clever!
 
 A distance meter highlights
your progress through the level.
Partway through the stage the
viewpoint changes to a more
familiar over-the-shoulder
perspective. They’re pretty much
just like the bonus stages of After
132

Burner, in that it’s possible to
crash into the scenery if you’re
not careful. Here, the machine gun
is used to take out airborne
targets, while missiles travel along
the ground.
 
When you reach the end, the
perspective once again switches
to an overhead view, except now
you can’t change you altitude.
Your goal is to conduct a bombing
run on a gigantic tank and/or jet,
taking apart its turrets piece by
piece. The only exception is the
final stage, which ends in the
over-the-shoulder perspective
against a different variety of
gigantic tank.
 
It’s a short game with only
four rounds, consisting of flights
through a city, the wilderness
(complete with a harrowing trip
through some caverns, where you
skillfully need to dodge rock
pillars), a canyon, and an oil
refinery. It’s pretty standard stuff,
but like most Sega games of the
era, the brightly colored pixel art is
attractive, and it can’t be
overemphasized that the scaling
still looks incredible, even decades
later. The music is appropriate
1980s action fare, with a
significant if not overwhelming
amount of cowbell. It’s rather
unmemorable, since the explosions
tend to drown it out, but it works
well enough. Of course, like many
other Sega games, the big draw of
the arcade version was the sit-
down arcade cabinet – the home
versions just don’t have quite the
same appeal.
 
The Master System port
obviously can’t even come close,
and doesn’t even try for the most
part. The overhead scenes have
been changed entirely to 2D,
without the ability to change
altitude or alter your speed, while
all of the 3D effects have been
totally removed. As such it feels
like a really standard, really boring
shooter, especially since your
firepower is so weak and there
aren’t any extra weapons.
Strangely, most of the helicopters
you fight don’t fire any guns, and
are content to fly in the same
handful of formations, ramming
straight through your copter in
countless kamikaze attacks.
 
The over-the-shoulder
segments aren’t much better.
Naturally, they’re pretty choppy,
but the first stage is remarkably
boring because half of the enemies
can’t even damage you – they’re
just there for target practice. It
gets more difficult by the second
stage, where the choppy scrolling
makes flying through the cave and
maneuvering quite difficult. The
levels are essentially the same as
the arcade game, although the
order of the bosses has been
changed. The only positive aspect
is the image of the burning,

wrecked helicopter when you lose
all of your lives. Otherwise, it’s a
total wash. Interestingly enough,
the Japanese version uses a few
different sound effects to the
American/European version, which
is a little less harsh on the ears.
 
There are numerous other
ports, available for home
computers. Far and away the most
accurate is the X68000 version,
ported by SPS and published by
Sharp in 1990. It’s close to arcade
perfect, though the sprites are
smaller and less numerous. But
since this was only released in
Japan, Western gamers had to do
with one of the many conversions
published by US Gold.
Most of these, for the
Commodore 64, Amiga, Amstrad
and PC, are notably impressive,
because they actually contain the
scaling in the overhead stages,
which the console ports never
bothered with. They’re obviously
not quite as smooth, and the tiles
aren’t as detailed – they’re usually
just a single color or two,
depending on the version – but it’s
not bad, despite the huge border
on the top of the screen.
The Amiga and Atari ST
versions look the best, while the
IBM PC release has some notably
downgraded visuals. The problem
lies with the controls – in most of
these, you need to adjust your
speed manually, otherwise you’ll
just hover in midair. In the Amiga
version, for example, you need to
hold down the fire button and
press up to increase speed, then
press down to take off. It’s rather
unintuitive, and can lead to a lot
of cheap deaths. The only version
spared from this is the
Commodore 64 version, which
despite being one of the worst
looking of the bunch, handles
fairly well. The ZX Spectrum
version is monochrome, choppy,
and the worst of the bunch, while
the MSX version is just a quicky
port of the ZX Spectrum version.
 
There are two 16-bit console
ports. The Genesis version was
released around the launch of the
system and is called Super
Thunder Blade, despite there being
nothing “super“ about it. The first
overhead section of each level has
been cut out entirely. Instead,
each stage starts off in the over-
the-shoulder segment. To make up
for this, these stages are longer
and have a new mid-boss, similar
to the one fought at the end of the
arcade version. After defeating
this, you go into an overhead
view, but there’s no scaling at all.
You couldn’t change altitude in
these scenes in the arcade game
either, so they play similarly. Once
again there are only four stages,
with the first, second and fourth
being roughly identical to the
arcade game, and the third being a
brand new level that takes place
over the ocean. There’s also a
new final boss, fought in the
overhead perspective. The
targeting is also simplified, as
missiles now home in on enemies.
 
Regrettably, the hardware still
chokes on the game. The 3D
scrolling is better than any of the
other ports save the X68000
version, but it’s still a far cry from
the arcade game. The multi-
layered buildings are now just a
single layer, and some areas look
embarrassingly bad, like the
caverns in the second stage.
Additionally, there’s a split second
of lag before every movement,
which makes maneuvering through
anything a massive bout of
frustration. You can stop and
hover but otherwise can’t change
speed. Overall, it’s a terrible port.
 
The PC Engine version,
ported by NEC Avenue, actually
keeps all of the overhead sections.
It removes the scaling, but as a
compromise, allows the helicopter
to move up and down the screen,
which you couldn’t do in Super
Thunder Blade. The scrolling is
slow and choppy, but it’s better
than just hacking out these
segments altogether.
 
The animation in the over-the-
shoulder stages is smoother than
the Master System version, but
not quite as good as Super
Thunder Blade. The distance meter
is present – it’s absent from the
other console versions – but you
still can’t change speed. All things
considered, it’s a better port than
any of Sega’s own attempts,
though that’s not saying much.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Galaxy Force / Galaxy Force II
Original Release: 1988
Platforms: ARC, FMT, GEN,
SMS, C64, AMI, AST, CPC, ZX,
SAT, PS2, WII, WIN
Galaxy Force is the ultimate
culmination of Sega’s “super
scaler“ series, developed for their
System Y board in 1988. While
the practice of using 2D bitmaps
to simulate 3D has long become
passe, this game manages to
impress even decades after its
initial release.
 
Not only is Galaxy Force
essentially “After Burner in space“,
but it also bridges the gap
between Sega’s older “super
scaler“ games and later, fully 3D
rail-shooters like Panzer Dragoon
and Rez. Taking control of the
spaceship Try-Z through six levels,
as you fight against an
organization known as The Fourth
Empire, you have two primary
weapons: a rapid fire Vulcan
cannon of limited use, and much
more powerful homing missiles,
which can lock on to enemies if
you target them with your cursor.
 
Beyond that are several other
tweaks to the formula. In After
Burner, your range of motion was
limited to a fairly small box, but in
Galaxy Force your movement is
much less constrained. You’re still
flying forward on a set of rails, but
you can veer off the sides a bit,
plus it’s much easier to dodge. It
feels like you’re more involved
with the piloting of the ship,
instead of just watching scenery
fly by. It’s also paced significantly
slower, so it’s a fair bit less
chaotic. The missiles work
differently too, in that you can
lock onto multiple enemies, and
fire at them all at once. You also
have an unlimited supply of
missiles, making them the go-to
weapon in most cases.
 
Rather than flying over largely
empty expanses of terrain, there’s
also a great focus on level design.
Most stages are divided into two
areas: an outside area, and an
interior “fortress“ stage. In the
latter you fly through caves and
tunnels, an evolution of the
canyon areas from After Burner.
Each stage climaxes with a brief
siege on a central core, which go
down without any major fight. It’s
clear from the first stage that
Galaxy Force was heavily inspired
by the final battle against the
Death Star in Return of the Jedi.
The Force Is With You
There are other subtle Star Wars
references too, which highlight
how impressive this game looked,
especially back in 1988. Shortly
after you’re launched out of your
carrier for the first mission, a
gigantic, long length cruiser sneaks
up from behind. Like everything
else in the “super scaler“ universe,
it’s just the same image stacked
over itself multiple times, but due
to some impressive visual trickery,
it actually looks something like an
Imperial Star Destroyer, albeit on a
smaller scale. Similarly, when you
fly through an asteroid field, the
sprites are layered in a way that it
136

actually looks like a fully 3D
object, even though it isn’t.
 
The visual design, as you’d
expect from Sega, never fails to
impress. Each stage has a unique
theme, ranging from the asteroid
belt in the first stage, the lava and
solar flares in the second, the
jungles and waterfalls of the third,
and the numerous devastating
tornadoes of the forth. The final
level also gets trippy, with tunnels
featuring weaving expanses of
color and other bits of visual
craziness that are meant to
represent hyperspace. The music,
as expected of Sega, is quite
classy. The melodies of most of
the songs aren’t terribly notable,
but they all have really awesome
bass lines, courtesy of some very
high quality guitar samples, which
gives the soundtrack a funkier
texture than most other Sega
arcade games. It was composed
by Funky K.H. (Katsuhiro Hayashi)
and Pretty K.N. (Kouichi Namaki),
who also worked on Thunder
Blade, which has some similarities
to this soundtrack.
 
You can choose which of the
five planets to begin your sortie,
although they play out in a
determined order from there. After
conquering all of them, you can
play the sixth and final stage.
There are no power-ups, except
for an attachment which will
automatically merge with your
fighter partway through the stage,
allowing you to shoot more
missiles at once.
Galaxy Force’s biggest fault,
more than most of Sega’s other
arcade games, is that it presents
itself more as an amusement ride
than a game. Many of the
company’s games featured
cabinets that would sway back
and forth as you pilot the ship,
and Galaxy Force is no different.
However, it is also much more
transparent about milking as much
money from the player as possible,
due to the “ENERGY“ meter at the
bottom of the screen. You begin
with 1200 points, which quickly
counts down from the moment
you launch. Additionally, although
you begin with a shield, it’ll
disappear after a few hits, with all
further damage deducting from the
energy total.
 
There are ways to mitigate
the loss: accelerating in order to
reach the end quicker, or killing as
many enemies as possible to get a
higher energy bonus, rewarded at
various points throughout the
stages. But unless you play a
nearly perfect game, the
countdown is so quick that it’s
incredibly difficult to recoup your
losses, and the net result is a
game that’s limited to a few
minutes of play per credit. In the
overseas release, you can easily
continue from where you left off
by pumping in more credits – at
least, up until the last level – but
the Japanese version forbids
continuing at all. Regardless of
this problem, and even divorced
from the motion-control cabinet it
was meant to be played in, Galaxy
Force is still an incredibly
impressive feat of programming, a
work of art in its own way.
 
Most instances of the game
are known as Galaxy Force II.
Much like After Burner, the
numeral indicates an enhanced
version, rather than a true sequel
– it’s more like Galaxy Force 2.0
than anything, thereby making the
original version redundant. The
first Galaxy Force was only on the
market in Japan for two months
before being superceded by this
conversion kit. The number of
levels was expanded from four to
six, and each level was expanded
and rebalanced. It also lets you
fire all four missiles in a single
button press, rather than firing
individually like After Burner.
 
There are three different
types of cabinet: a standard
upright cabinet, and two full
Top: Cover artwork for the Commodore 64
Bottom: [ARC]  The Star Destroy homage,
and what could be a reference to Cloud City
137

sit-down cabinets that tilt side-to-
side, known as the Deluxe Edition
and Super Deluxe Edition. They
are mightily impressive, especially
the Super Deluxe version, which
could rotate up to 335 degrees
left and right, and tip forwards and
backwards at 15 degrees. The
Super Deluxe cabinets also had
headphone jacks so the player
could get lost in the sights and
sounds of Galaxy Force.
 
Alas, most games are likely
to be more well known for their
home ports rather than arcade
originals, which tends to reflect
badly on Galaxy Force. The
System Y was simply far too
powerful to be even remotely
replicated on any console at the
time, resulting in ports that were
at best heavily compromised and
at worst largely terrible. A major
factor in all of the home versions
though – since they’re naturally
less dependent on squeezing
money from the player – is that
the energy drainage is not as
quick, and you regain substantially
more after each level.
System Ports
For a long time the best version
was the FM Towns computer
release, which was also
compatible with the Marty
console. Both systems were only
available in Japan. Ported by CRI,
it looks and feels reasonably close
to the arcade version, since the
system was much more powerful
than any other console at the
time, but it’s not without some
downgrades. It runs in a window
that takes up about 75% of the
screen, plus the action isn’t quite
as smooth, often slowing down or
causing sprite flickering. Some bits
of detail have been scaled back
too, like the number of robots
found in the second part of the
first stage, which has been greatly
reduced. The branching paths in
the tunnels are also gone. Still, it’s
far better than the other versions
at the time, and includes a
redbook audio soundtrack with
some cool remixed music.
 
CRI also developed the
Genesis version, which is far more
regrettable. The system couldn’t
even replicate other “super scaler“
games like Space Harrier or
OutRun, so what hope could it
have for Galaxy Force II? Since the
system doesn’t support sprite
scaling, it instead uses a set of
sprites, each drawn at specific
distances, which is incredibly
choppy in motion. Most of the
obstacles and enemies have been
removed. The tunnel stages are
done entirely with rolling colors,
and it looks really, really awful.
Due to the lack of buttons, the
guns are on auto-fire by default,
with the remaining buttons used
to control speed and fire missiles.
About the only thing that survived
intact is the soundtrack, otherwise
the game is barely playable.
 
The Master System, being an
8-bit system, obviously had even
less of a chance to replicate the
game, so the developers at Sega
made a wise decision and
redesigned everything to make it
more suitable to the platform. It
was released under the title
Galaxy Force, ditching the numeral
from most other home ports. It did
not receive a Japanese release –
Sega published it in Europe while
Activision handled the duties in
North America.
 
In many ways, this port is
similar to Konami’s 1988 Famicom
Disk System game Falsion. In
general, the game controls a little
more like Space Harrier than After
Burner. Most of the obstacles
have been changed into waves of
enemies that recur through the
stage, until you reach the tunnel
areas. The action is actually quite
fast though the animation is
predictably very choppy. The
interior segments are much more
difficult, since it’s hard to make
turns properly without under- or
over-steering.
 
There are some other
changes and niceties – the
pre-level launch sequences are
now brief cutscenes, which
actually look nicer than most of
the other home ports. The energy
meter is completely gone, meaning
there’s no more timer, and instead
your ship’s integrity is based
entirely on your shield. The speed
controls are gone too, with the
two main buttons used for the gun
and missiles. It is also missing the
fifth stage.
 
The various home computer
ports generally don’t stack up to
the console versions. In addition to
being slower and choppier, they
are played in a small window, with
large status bars taking up most of
the screen. The ZX Spectrum
plays alright, but since the sprites
are all transparent outlines,
everything ends up blending
together. The landscapes are also
rendered as checkerboards, similar
to Space Harrier.
 
The Amstrad version is similar
but much more colorful, and uses
rolling color bands. However,
there’s no music, and enemies

Bottom: [ARC] The many impressive,
otherworldly landscapes
138

have a nasty tendency to bump
right into your back. The C64
version moves way too quickly,
leaving everything as an
incomprehensible mess of color.
The music is decent though, and
the “PENETRATE FORTRESS“ and
“POWER-UP“ messages in gigantic
letters are amusing.
 
The Amiga and Atari ST ports
are comparable to the Genesis
port, except for smaller sprites,
and a window that takes up
roughly 30% of the screen. They
run a little bit faster but are still
fairly choppy. While the floors and
ceilings of the fortresses are
rolling color bands, the walls are
displayed using a sprite stretching
effect, so these areas look a little
less barren. Unfortunately, your
ship controls too slowly, and you
really need to pay attention to the
speed of your ship in order to
make turns.
Galaxy Force II got another
shot on home consoles in 1998,
published as part of the Sega Ages
line for the Saturn in Japan.
Ported by Appaloosa
Entertainment, it’s better than any
of the other previous conversions,
but the frame rate is capped at 30
FPS (rather than the 60 FPS of the
arcade) and it still slows down on
occasion. The only extras are in
the form of some background
story (in Japanese) and the option
to watch a pre-recorded play-
through of the game. The music is
all from the arcade version.
 
In 2007, Galaxy Force II was
ported yet again, this time to the
PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega
Ages 2500 budget line. Its full
title is Galaxy Force II: Special
Extended Edition. Developed by
emulation wizards M2, this
compilation includes a perfect port
of the original arcade game, in
addition to the Genesis and Master
System ports. More importantly,
M2 went above and beyond the
call of duty by adding a new “Neo
Classic” mode, which features
smoothed out graphics,
transparencies, and other graphical
effects. These don’t seem to be
completely redrawn, and they’re
again pixelated, but it’s still
superior to the arcade version,
even though it suffers from the
same pop up due to its erratic
draw distance.
 
The best addition is the
widescreen mode, which makes
the original game seem horribly
cramped by comparison. You’re
also given the option of listening
to the original soundtrack or the
arranged FM Towns soundtrack.
There’s also a brand new
arrangement of the main theme.
“Neo Classic” also has a built-in
cheat menu that lets you tinker
with the amount of energy you
start with, thereby sidestepping
any issues with the difficulty.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Power Drift is a go-kart racing
game, and one of many Sega titles
that emulated 3D effects through
the use of 2D sprites. It was
directed by Yu Suzuki, and it’s
powered by the System Y Board,
which also ran Galaxy Force.
What sets Power Drift apart
from the pack is the way it uses
those sprites. Most other arcade
racing games used flat-shaded
colors to simulate scrolling on the
road. In contrast Power Drift
constructs all of its track layouts
using flat bitmaps, which makes it
look like you’re driving over a
series of Lincoln Logs.
While initially this seems a bit
silly, it allows the tracks to feel
like mini roller coasters, with sharp
inclines, dives, curves, and
occasionally even jumps. There
aren’t any guard rails on the
courses either, making it extremely
easy to fall off the edges. And
compared to most other similar
games, which only stuck the
camera right behind you, Power
Drift introduces each course with a
fly-by, and spins around wildly
whenever you go out of control.
The whole screen also tilts left and
right as you steer, which adds to
the dizzying experience. Like most
games of this type, it’s fascinating
to see how Sega tried to emulate a
wholly 3D space using strictly 2D
technology. Certain cabinets were
sit-down models with hydraulics
that tilted the player left and right
up to 20 degrees.
There are 25 tracks in total,
divided into five sets of five. Each
is short and requires four laps to
complete. If you manage to place
high enough in the given set of
tracks, you get to play a bonus
track, where your car morphs into
either the motorcycle from Hang
On or the jet from After Burner.
The music is upbeat and catchy,
but it tends to get drowned out by
the tire squeals.
A Bit Awkward
While impressive to a certain
degree, the controls are too
touchy, and the action is too
chaotic, especially with all of the
disjointed terrain sprites flying
around. In addition, there are a
dozen drivers, each categorized
with a unique, super deformed
face at the top of the screen,
which makes the races feel
remarkably crowded. There’s also
technically no “drifting“ in the
game, at least in how it’s been
defined in modern racing games.
There was a networked
release of Power Drift which
allowed up to eight cabinets to be
linked together. Known as Power
Drift: Tsuushin Taisen (“Network
Versus Battle“), it lets you play the
first level as a practice run, and
changes up the finishing
requirements. The course layout is
also slightly different.
Power Drift has a fairly
decent reputation in Europe due to

the quality of the home computer
ports. None of them are
particularly faithful to the arcade
version, since the graphical tricks
used by the System Y Board are
totally missing. The roads are gray
or colorless, the screen doesn’t
tilt, and most of the details on the
side of the road are missing.
The most well regarded
version is the Commodore 64
release, which runs quite fast and
even keeps most of the roadside
decorations, including the tunnels.
It also has some excellent music,
though only one song is used
during gameplay.
The Amstrad, MSX and
ZX Spectrum versions are
essentially identical outside of
their color schemes, though
they’re all much slower and
visually more sparse. The IBM PC
version is displayed in VGA so it’s
the most colorful, and it runs very
smoothly, but the amount of detail
on the courses is pathetic.
The Amiga and Atari ST
versions try to replicate the scaled
sprite look of the arcade, and even
have the camera panning/rotating
intro. These versions use sprites
of different sizes rather than
actually scaling them – so it’s not
nearly as smooth – but this allows
for mostly accurate courses.
However, the gaps between the
road blocks are more evident, plus
it’s incredibly choppy and glitchy.
There were plans for Dempa
to port the game to the Mega
Drive, but the project was
ultimately canceled. The only
console port around the time of
release was for the PC Engine,
ported by Copya System and
published by Asmik Ace. The PC
Engine also could not scale
sprites, so it uses a technique
similar to the Amiga/Atari version.
However, in general it’s smoother
and much more playable.
Unfortunately there is plenty of
flicker, plus there are only six
racers at once, half that of the
arcade. It’s also missing quite a bit
of content, with only a single set
of 10 courses.
The two best ports were
released for the Saturn and
Dreamcast. The Saturn version
was ported by Phant and
published in 1996. It’s an
excellent port and includes a
“Grand Prix“ mode, as well as the
option for arranged or arcade
music. The only downside is that
the game runs at 30 frames per
second rather than 60.
The Dreamcast version was
included as a compilation disc
featured in the Yu Suzuki Game
Works Vol. 1 book, released in
2001. It’s a straight port of the
arcade version, so it lacks the
extra tournament mode and
arranged music, but it does run at
a smooth 60 FPS.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Alien Syndrome is pretty clearly a
rip off of the movie Aliens, since
Konami had the actual license to
the movie (and made their own
suitable arcade entry).
 
Although it looks like a
typical overhead, character-based
shooter, Alien Syndrome is a
rather far stretch from linear
games like Commando. Players
can take control of either Ricky or
Mary (outer space commandos
who are absolutely in no way
related to Michael Biehn or
Sigourney Weaver), or both
during simultaneous two-player
action. Each of the stages takes
place on one of seven invaded
colonies, where the aliens have
trapped the humans in cocoons
and biologically contaminated
most of the structures.
 
As an insurance plan in case
Ricky and Mary can’t save the
day, each of the colonies is set to
explode after a certain amount of
time. You’re therefore working
against the clock to find enough
hostages, get to the exit, and kill
the boss. The stages aren’t
particularly complex, but there are
maps posted around that will clue
you in on the locations of your
comrades. In addition to your
clumsy little pea shooter, you can
also find new weapons like lasers
and two different kinds of
flamethrower, in addition to
options that shoot behind your
character. With the constantly
spawning enemies, Alien
Syndrome manages to emulate
the feel of Gauntlet without all
of the clumsiness.
Alien Syndrome has no
tolerance for screw-ups. You
cannot continue, at all. While the
levels don’t pose too much of a
challenge, some of the boss
encounters can be quite difficult,
especially if you get killed and
revert to the default cannon.
You’re even forced to use it during
the final confrontation, regardless
of how well you’ve done.
Absolute Terror
The high difficulty level adds to an
atmosphere of complete terror.
The music is tense, low-key, and
incredibly creepy. A single tap
from an enemy and your player
will cry out a blood-curdling
scream before collapsing. It’s all
rather unnerving.
 
But what really makes the
game memorable are the
awesomely grotesque boss
designs. The first boss is a
gigantic rotund ball with a little
green dude sticking out from
whatever would be classed as its
shoulder. After taking enough hits
the body explodes, leaving behind
a head which morphs into some
kind of twisted thing with an
extended jaw and ugly horns when
it attacks. The second boss
appears to be a pulsating heart
surrounded by blobs. The third
boss is a strange, lumbering,

multi-legged creature with eyes
that detach and float around the
screen, which looks both goofy
and horrific. The sixth boss is an
alien grasshopper with what
appears to be a baby’s head. The
final boss, which hijacks itself
onto your ship a la the finale of
the original Alien, looks like half of
a human face stripped of its skin,
leaving another head dangling
from its nose, and huge distended
ears that fire bullets. The “body
horror“ aspect is still the best part
of this classic.
 
The Famicom / NES version –
published by Sunsoft in Japan and
Tengen in America – is relatively
faithful to the arcade version,
even offering two-player
simultaneous play and a new intro
cinema. The characters walk much
slower, though, and you must
rescue every single prisoner before
you can fight the boss. The
bosses are also pretty similar,
although some of their attacks had
to be scaled down.
More of a Remake
The Sega Master System version
is practically a whole new game.
The scrolling is gone, and instead
it flips screen-by-screen like the
original The Legend of Zelda. All
of the levels are completely
different (although the first stage
is patterned after the second level
of the arcade game), and each
feels more maze-like. Some of the
enemies are the same, but the
vast majority are unique to this
version. On that note, while a few
of the bosses have been carried
over (although slightly altered),
most of them are entirely new,
and manage to be just as
awesome as the arcade bosses,
despite the lower color palette.
The weapons have been cut
down, so there’s only
flamethrower and laser power-ups.
Sadly, there’s no map at all.
 
However, the game is even
more difficult than the arcade
version, impossibly so. Each room
starts out empty and foes slowly
blink onto the screen. It’s way too
easy to accidentally have an
enemy appear beneath you for a
Top: Covers from the [NES] and home
computers versions, and an arcade flier

boss encounters
143

cheap kill. Most of the weapons
have a slow firing rate, so if you
fire before an enemy has
completely appeared it’ll pass
harmlessly through them. This
leaves you defenseless for a
second, which can be the
difference between life and death.
Fight For Your Life
The boss fights are even more
unforgiving, since they have a
tendency to back you into a corner
and use a simple three-way bullet
pattern that’s nearly impossible to
dodge, given the close quarters.
Furthermore, the hit detection is
quite sloppy and striking the
enemy’s weak point seems like a
matter of chance. Again, there are
no continues, and the standard
weapon is useless, so if you get
killed you may as well give up.
The only real high point is the
tremendously scary death
screams, which are even louder
and more disturbing than the
arcade version.
The Game Gear release is,
oddly enough, the best of the 8-bit
home ports. According to the
intro, this version is actually a
sequel set five years after the
original Alien Syndrome. The
gameplay is much like the arcade
version, with many of the same
bosses, although there are four
(mostly) new levels. You can now
access the map screen at any
time, and can power up weapons
by grabbing the same kind twice.
It still suffers from a bit of
slowdown and flicker, but it’s
surprisingly cool, and has some
awesome cover artwork.
 
As far as computer ports go,
all of are based on the arcade
version. The Commodore 64
release is pretty decent, barring
some slow screen-scrolling. The
Amiga, Atari ST and PC versions
are graphically identical, and
feature some redesigned, brighter
visuals. Both suffer from some
jerky scrolling; the Amiga has the
upper hand for sound but is
missing a few levels. Still, they
both play pretty well.
The X68000 version, ported
by Dempa, is practically arcade-
perfect. The only other nearly-
perfect port is found on Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for
PS3 and Xbox 360.
 
After disappearing for
approximately 15 years, Sega
resurrected Alien Syndrome for
their Sega Ages 2500 series,
which appeared in the US in the
Sega Classics Collection, but was
absent from the European release.
The 3D graphics aren’t pretty, and
they’re way too dark, but they do
a decent job of emulating the feel
of the Alien movies.
The biggest change is the
addition of dual analog movement,

so you can move with one stick
and fire with the other as in
Robotron 2084 and Smash TV.
There are a few new
weapons, including some useless
grenades and a spread shot. The
pacing is a bit slower, but feels
more chaotic, with more being
thrown at you at once. However,
you also now have a life bar, along
with unlimited continues, so it’s
not nearly as tense as the original
arcade game, losing some of its
appeal. Sega also increased the
gore quotient by making bad guys
explode in a mess of blood.

Alien Syndrome
Original Release: 2007
Platforms: PSP, WII
Despite the arguable lack of quality
in the GBA versions of The
Revenge of Shinobi and Altered
Beast: Guardian of the Realms,
Sega allowed yet another of their
classic properties to be handled by
a completely unrelated company.
In this case, however, the
developer is Totally Games. The
same company was responsible for
creating each installment of the
venerable X-Wing and TIE Fighter
PC/Mac series as well as the
WWII dogfighter, Secret
Weapons Over Normandy.
 
With this Alien Syndrome
update, available on both the Wii
and PSP, Totally Games set out to
bring the franchise back in the
form of a dungeon hack not
unlike Baldur’s Gate: Dark
Alliance. Up to four players can
cooperate to traverse a massive
interstellar installation infested
with the “Alien Syndrome“.
 
The game is set 100 years
after the original and follows the
adventures of a military officer
named Aileen Harding. She’s sent
to investigate an isolated space
colony whose communications
have been cut off. Obviously the
Alien Syndrome is to blame.
 
Where the game deviates
from the norm is that right from
the outset you need to select a
character class. This determines
what type of weapon you’re most
efficient with as well as what
attribute bonuses you can earn as
you progress.
Earn bonuses? Attributes?
Character classes? Yes, the 2007
iteration of Alien Syndrome will
often have the player spending
more time in a menu distributing
points and crafting weapons than
they will blasting alien creatures.
While it’s a successful hack ’n
slash, it is less successful at
merging dungeon crawling with
the deliberately paced action of
classic Alien Syndrome.
 
The controls are very smooth.
It’s especially effective on the Wii
because you can move your
character with the nunchuk while
selecting, aiming and firing your
chosen weapon with the remote.
This takes some getting used to,
but in the end does a great job of
letting you navigate crowds of
aliens while still being able to slay
them efficiently, as you can easily
move in one direction while firing
in another. Otherwise, in the PSP
version, you can hold down a
button to fire and strafe.
You have a wide variety of
weapons that fall into categories
based on the original Alien
Syndrome’s weapons (flame-
throwers, lasers, explosives, and
so on) in addition to various types
of stat-altering armor to equip as
needed. These are equipped on
one of many menus you must
cycle through to manage your
stats, inventory, arms and armor.
The controls on the Wii
version are also great because you
use the remote as a pointer on all
146

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
of the menus as well as using
motions from the remote as
shortcuts for your various melee
techniques. You can also use the
nunchuk to tilt the camera slightly,
something required far too often
due to the amount of overheard
piping and wreckage the designers
have placed between your eyes
and the action.
 
The Wii version also has a
few other additions. There are
capsules scattered throughout the
area which let you play a mini-
game that can also improve your
character. The mini-games
represent different types of
research and genetic manipulation,
but their rules and structure make
them feel pointless and brazenly
tacked on. The game’s quality
would not change if they were
excised completely.
 
The crafting aspect is handled
by a robotic buddy reminiscent of
a Mag from Phantasy Star Online.
The drone that follows you around
is called a SCARAB: Sentient
Combat And Recycling Assembly
Bot. The recycling part involves
you scrapping unneeded weapons
and items to gain resource points,
which are then used to purchase
newer weapons, armor and items.
There is a constantly expanding
array of goods for you to purchase
as you gain more experience
through combat.
Player Cooperation
The SCARAB makes multiplayer
pretty interesting. Since you can
drop any item on the ground at
any time, it’s very easy for players
to coordinate who should
manufacture what item, so as to
most efficiently equip each other.
This is where the game’s class
and stat system really shines, as
you can work together to build
very different characters that
complement each other.
 
These elements are all
intriguing, but their implementation
in this game is somewhat
unpolished. The biggest offense is
that multiplayer sessions have
terrible pacing, degenerating into
alternating between 10 minute
bursts of action and each player
assigning resource points in their
own set of menus. As a final
reminder of the lack of polish the
cooperative side has received,
each player controls a differently
colored Aileen Harding. Alien
Syndrome is already a dark game,
and while different character
classes do have cosmetically
different appearances, it was a
bad move not to throw in a couple
of extra low-polygon models to
keep players from losing track of
their character.
 
Graphically, while the game is
very effective on the PSP, it’s
embarrassing on the Wii. The
textures used and the polygon
counts for each object are not
irredeemable, but the lighting and
other effects are garish and make
the entire package ugly to behold.
The easiest way to see this is
to play a game with four people at
once. There are so many blinking
reticules, jagged shadows and
small separate explosions
everywhere that it’s almost
impossible to follow the action.
The sound design is totally
unremarkable. The voice acting is
above average but every other
aspect of the sound design is
forgettable and workmanlike.
 
Artistically the game is a
mixed bag. You could criticize the
game for having a bunch of gray
corridors and the same biological
terrors we’ve seen in games and
movies for years, but this IS Alien
Syndrome. On the up side, the
cutscenes are told via very nice
static artwork that’s reminiscent
of the Dark Horse Aliens comics
from the late 1980s while still
having an original style.
The real letdown is that while
many of the stock enemy designs
are clearly inspired by the original
game, the horror vibe is completely
gone. Bosses are simply bigger
aliens rather than the shambling,
gruesome horrors of the original.
This removes one of the things
that set the original apart from the
crowd when it was new.
 
The verdict? Alien Syndrome
is a good game, but it will
probably appeal more to fans of
action RPGs than to fans of the
original Alien Syndrome. It’s also
best enjoyed with multiple players
to keep it from getting too droll.

unoriginal the gaming landscape is,
and how everything is a clone of a
clone. Even though these same
people love to dream about how
much better games were in the old
days, the fact is, there was plenty
of crappy, derivative junk, created
mostly to wow arcade-goers with
some impressive graphics, all while
sucking quarters out of them.
 
Sega’s Gain Ground stood in
opposition to this. There’s some
ridiculous plot about humanity
finally reaching a state of world
peace, but they begin to worry
that they may lose their fighting
instinct. To quell this instinctive
urge, they create a super computer
that simulates warfare from
throughout Earth’s history.
Naturally, the computer goes crazy
and starts killing things for real, so
it’s up to you to put a stop to this
digital insurgence.
You play as an army of
commandos, Vikings, valkyries,
samurai, Native Americans,
knights and robots, as you travel
through different time periods,
ranging from prehistory to the
medieval times to the distant
future, killing anything that tries to
kill you. Tossing all of the
anachronisms into a huge pot and
stirring is an intriguing idea – sort
of a takeoff on Alpha Denshi’s
Time Soldiers – and it’s completely
different to anything on the
market, then or now, even though
it’s hard to see at first.
Gain Ground may look like a
standard overhead action game,
but it’s not a shooter – the pacing
is completely different to a
standard overhead Mercs-style
game. Some people call it a
strategy title, which isn’t accurate
either; it’s absolutely nothing like
Fire Emblem or Command and
Conquer-style games. Sega
themselves call Gain Ground an
“algorithm action“ game, and
while that’s easy to write off as
some kind of crazy Engrish, it
almost kind of fits.
Algorithm Action
In Gain Ground you are given a
single screen, filled with enemies
and obstacles. The arcade game
runs on Sega’s System 24 board,
which results in some incredibly
high-resolution graphics and a
huge playing field. The characters
are tiny, but it gives a lot of room
to move around. In the beginning,
there are three selectable
characters, each with different
abilities. In order to complete each
of the stages, you either have to
kill all of the enemies, or guide
your heroes to the huge block that
says EXIT.
 
When you first play Gain
Ground, you may feel that
something is horribly amiss. None
of the characters move at a quick
pace. Instead, they just kind of
waddle around, strolling through a
battlefield as carnage unfolds
148

around them. Their weapons are
slow, awkward, and often hard to
use properly. There are no screen
clearing bombs. If you play this
like any other run-and-gun
shooter, you’ll get demolished
pretty quickly.
 
But therein lies the puzzle
aspect of Gain Ground, as it
becomes imperative to study
enemy patterns and figure out the
best way to beat them. Some
enemies will only charge at you
when you come close to them – in
which case, lure them out, run
back, and repeat. Most enemies
shoot directly at you, so as long
as you’re fast enough, you can
keep running without getting hit.
Most enemies have behaviors that
are less scripted, but can be
analyzed and exploited This is
where the “algorithm“ part fits in.
 
Most importantly, you need
to look at your characters and
figure out the best, most efficient
way to utilize their unique roles.
Each of the 20 characters has a
variety of strengths and
weaknesses – some are slow but
powerful, while others are needed
to hit enemies at different heights.
 
You begin the game with just
three characters at your disposal,
but pick up more as you go along.
On the battlefield you’ll often
come across little icons of disabled
soldiers. If you pick them up and
reach the exit they’ll become
playable in the next round.
Defying Convention
On a similar note, there are no real
“lives“ in Gain Ground. If your
character dies, they show up as
disabled on the battlefield. If the
dead character can be picked up
and escorted to the next stage,
they’ll be resurrected, good as
new. However, if your next
character dies, or you finish the
level without them, then they’ll be
lost for good. In other words,
building up your ranks and keeping
them alive is one of the biggest
challenges in Gain Ground.
 
This is primarily because the
game is brutally difficult and
unforgiving. It’s all too common
that you’ll start off a level with a
new character, get them killed
before you can figure out what
their strengths are, and never see
them again. Additionally, there are
way too many situations where
you can screw yourself over if you
don’t have the right character.
What if there are enemies on the
rooftops and you don’t have any
characters that can hit them?
Well, ha ha, tough luck. It’s not
always impossible, and it forces
you to improvise if you’re ill-
equipped, but more often than
not, it just leads to some
incredibly cheap deaths.
 
Sometimes the game just
gets too overwhelming for its own
good. The most obnoxious group
of enemies are wizards that
transport to various places around
the screen, toss out some fireballs
directly at your character, and
then disappear to some other
location. None of your characters
are fast enough, nor are your
weapons versatile enough, to deal
with them properly, especially
when they throw some wizards in
a level with no maneuvering room.
 
There are at least a few levels
that seem completely counter
Below: [ARC] The arcade version has huge
battlefields due to the high resolution
Top & Bottom: [ARC] Some of the warriors
149

intuitive to the game’s slow-and-
steady mechanics. Oh, and you’ve
got a time limit to beat each level,
so you’d better hurry up.
 
There’s also another quirk to
keep in mind. Most of your
characters are either left or right
handed. This means that they’ll
shoot off center each time they
fire. This may add realism, and
occasionally lends to the strategy,
but when you’re getting chased in
circles by some bad guy, the last
thing you want to worry about is
adjusting your aim.
 
The developers have stated
that their original inspiration was
Gauntlet. Visually, it’s easy to see
the comparison. Plus, both games
are about sending multiple players
to fight against hordes of bad
guys, finding order amongst
chaos, and using a character’s
skills as efficiently as possible.
 
Beyond those aspects,
however, Gain Ground is a
completely different animal,
adding a bit of brainwork to a
genre mostly known for pure
brawn. Sure, there are more than
a few irritating aspects in it, and
it’s almost shameful that there
was never a true sequel to fix any
of them up. But it certainly gets
points for traveling on the path
less taken, and most dedicated
gamers should be forgiving enough
to put up with some issues in
order to experience something
genuinely unique.
System Ports
There were several ports of Gain
Ground, naturally. The Genesis
version was published in America
by Renovation. Since there was no
way to accurately scale the
playing fields from the arcade
version, this port shrinks the
battlefield considerably. Even
though it feels cramped compared
to the arcade version, it actually
helps the pace of the game quite a
bit, especially when you need to
move multiple characters to the
exit. There are also 10 completely
new levels in the Genesis version
– the added Modern Epoch takes
place in the streets of the city,
with one stage being inside of an
arcade. There is also a “Hard
Mode“ which starts you off with
all twenty characters. The Genesis
version is also included on the
Sega Genesis Collection for the
PS2 and PSP, and Sonic’s
Ultimate Genesis Collection for the
PS3 and Xbox 360.
 
Sega also released a port for
the Master System, which
obviously has some vastly scaled
back graphics and some choppy
animations. However, many of the
levels are unique, and some of the
character abilities have been
changed around, so it’s worth
playing just to see something new.
 
NEC Avenue also ported Gain
Ground to the PC Engine Super CD
under the title Gain Ground SX.
Other than the excellent redbook
audio soundtrack, there’s really
nothing that takes advantage of
the CD format. In spite of this, it’s
probably one of the best ports of
Gain Ground. In order to faithfully
recreate the levels, the action has
been zoomed in, and the screen
now scrolls up and down.
Additionally, all of the
characters seem to move and fire
slightly faster, plus many of the
enemies are a bit easier. While one
can argue that it takes a lot of the
challenge out of the game, it’s also
much more playable – and fun –
than any other version. It also has
some nice sound effects, which
normally isn’t very important, but
they’re very noticeably considering
all of the other versions sound
pretty lame. Unfortunately, most
of the home ports (except for the
PS2 version) are missing the goofy

150

“end of level“ messages, like
“NOW YOU LOOK OUT“, "YOU
ARE BRAVE ONE", and “NEXT
STAGE IS NOT EASY“.
Gain Ground was also
resurrected in 2004 as part of the
Sega Ages series for the Japanese
PlayStation 2. The gameplay is the
same, but it uses all new
polygonal graphics. While some of
the screenshots seem rather ugly,
the game looks decent in motion.
The only real advantage to the 3D
graphics is that you can choose
between three viewpoints –
overhead, slightly skewed, and a
low angle viewpoint, the last of
which looks cool but is actually
rather useless.
Each character has brand
new artwork, most of which is
pretty cool, and for the first time it
displays their name in English
(they were relegated to instruction
manuals before). The characters
themselves look slightly super
deformed, and the goofy egg-
shaped renditions of the captured
units are pretty amusing.
Like the other home ports,
the levels have been shrunken so
everything fits on one screen, and
the three-player mode has been
reduced to two. But otherwise this
is pretty accurate to the arcade
original. There’s even an option to
disable an annoying bug in stage
4-8, which otherwise made it very
difficult to clear. It is, however,
lacking the extra stages from the
Genesis version and the
rebalanced difficulty from the
PC Engine CD version.
 
There’s also an “Extra Mode“
which features some slightly
different graphics tile sets and
altered character abilities.
Unfortunately, accessing this
requires beating the game on the
default difficulty settings (normal
level, 120 seconds time limit).
Gain Ground is 40 stages long,
and gives you unlimited continues
right up until the last stage. But if
you haven’t saved the right
characters, the final boss is
incredibly difficult, so unlocking
this mode is only for the most
hardcore players.
On the plus side, it opens up
what is probably this releases’
greatest asset – the music. The
entire soundtrack has been
provided courtesy of awesome
music artist Saitama Saisyu Heiki
(also known as S.S.H.), who does
some damn amazing stuff with his
synth guitars. All of the arcade
music has been rearranged in this
style, but the Extra Mode features
a whole ton of brand new tracks,
which are all fantastic and totally
makes this version worthwhile.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
Crack Down (no relation to the
2007 Xbox 360 game) is basically
the little brother of Gain Ground.
Both run on Sega’s System 24
board, utilizing high-res (496x384)
graphics. Both are also overhead
action games that emphasize
strategy and cooperation.
 
Your job, as one of two
secret agents named Ben Breaker
and Andy Attacker, is to infiltrate
the headquarters of a mad
scientist, who has created a huge
cybernetic goat demon. Each stage
is sort of a mini-maze, where you
need to plant a number of bombs,
marked with large red Xs, and then
hightail it to the exit. Although
there’s a time limit in each stage,
all of the Xs are clearly marked on
the onscreen map, and you’re
given more than enough time to
plant the bombs and escape.
 
One of the oddest design
choices is making the map take up
the entire top half of the screen,
while the bottom half is divided
even further – player one in the
lower-left window, player two in
the lower-right. In other words, the
action really only takes place in a
quarter of the screen’s real estate,
which makes the game feel
incredibly claustrophobic. And yet,
once you get used to it, this
actually works, since the map also
shows the exact location of every
enemy, as well as any weapon
power-ups. It’s pretty clear that
the game is designed for two-
player co-op, since the separate
screens allow each player to cover
the levels individually, instead of
being confined to the same screen.
 
This in turn creates a whole
bunch of new strategies. Crack
Down is less of a run-and-gun, and
more of a stalk-and-gun. It’s not
exactly a stealth game like Metal
Gear, since the emphasis is clearly
on killing bad guys instead of
avoiding them, but you’re
rewarded for playing it smart,
especially because you don’t get
any hugely powerful weapons. The
obvious strategy is to try to sneak
up on stationary bad guys to avoid
their fire, or simply avoid enemy
patrols, but you can also use a
door to block enemy shots, then
return fire as the door opens. Most
of the action takes place in narrow
corridors, and your characters can
lean against the wall to dodge
bullets, then pop back out and fire
return shots. If you can manage to
get the enemies to shoot each
other, you’ll be awarded double
points. These tactics obviously
work much better when you’re
playing with another person.
 
There are two types of guns –
a standard pistol, and rockets,
which can take out a whole row of
enemies. Although your ammo is
limited, you can use melee attacks
at close range, and there are
several types of bomb to kill all of
the enemies on the screen. Ammo
restocks are heavily distributed
throughout each stage. Most
enemies are simple drones

wielding guns, but eventually you
come across some nasty guys
with flamethrowers, and in one
level, crazed baboons.
 
There aren’t technically any
bosses, but there are a few
“special“ rooms. One includes
endlessly spawning enemies;
another is an electric grid. The
final stage is a series of obstacles
controlled by the mad professor.
This sequence is frustrating
because it requires that you’ve
stockpiled enough ammo.
 
On the surface it might be
hard to appreciate the visuals, but
there are a variety of subtle (and
not so subtle) touches, especially
the awesome intro. The attract
screen is a close up of a hand
spraying the Crack Down logo in
graffiti against a decaying brick
wall. The cinematic when the
game begins, viewed from a
security camera as our heroes
make an explosive entrance, is
equally impressive, even though
the brightly colored spandex worn
by them looks rather lame.
 
At the end of the game your
characters set explosives around
the gigantic goat demon seen in
the intro, and displayed
prominently on some of the
artwork. The thing looks cool, but
it’s disappointing that you don’t
actually get to fight it.
 
The graphics in-game might
be small, but the tilesets are
completely different for each of
the 16 stages, and each stage has
a unifying look and feel. Some
locations include warehouses,
furnaces, junkyards and
laboratories. The close ups
whenever you place a bomb,
complete with the ticking counter,
are remarkably cool. There are
some neat details to make out,
too, like the billboard advertising
for “Prayboy“, which seems like
an Engrish mangling until you see
it’s a religious magazine.
And while there are only a
few songs that repeat over and
over, what’s there is fantastic.
Master maestro Yuzo Koshiro
contributed to the soundtrack, and
the FM synth organs add a
particular sense of foreboding.
System Ports
The Genesis port, released in
North America by Sage’s Creation,
is pretty faithful to the arcade
game, at least from the gameplay
perspective. However, since the
resolution needed to be
downgraded, most of the sprites
end up looking cheap, and
everything is even smaller. At
least the second player window is
now used to detail all of the
enemies in the level when you’re
playing alone, so the space is no
longer wasted.
The characters move faster,
but there’s so much slowdown,
even in single-player, that it
negates any of the benefits.
Whenever you place a bomb you
just get a close up of the ticking
timer, without the animation of
the hand putting it in place. The
map only shows the level layout
and the Xs, while the enemies are
reduced to blips, so you can’t see
which direction they’re facing, and
you can’t see items either.
 
The IBM PC, Amiga, and
Atari ST ports are all pretty
similar. The graphics, while not as
colorful nor as detailed, are closer
to the arcade game, and they play
a bit faster too. The sound isn’t
quite as good as the arcade or
Genesis versions (especially the
IBM PC one), and the cinemas are
no longer animated, but otherwise
these are probably the best of the
bunch. The Commodore 64
version lacks music, and has some
really awkward scrolling making it
hard to see what’s in front of you.
The Amstrad version is a slight
improvement – it’s more colorful
although still ugly, but the
excessive slowdown and iffy
collision detection really hurt it.

Game Title
Original Release:
Platforms:
ESWAT is obviously heavily
influenced by the 1987 action
movie RoboCop. You play as a
police officer who wears a
cybernetic suit dubbed “ICE”. The
game itself is patterned closely
after Sega’s own Shinobi. While
Shinobi was methodical, forcing
you to hide from enemies before
launching a counterattack, ESWAT
encourages faster actions – you
can take several hits before dying,
and there aren’t as many places to
take cover anyway.
Your ammo is limited, forcing
you to resort to kicking criminals if
you run out, but it’s generally in
rich supply. It’s also two-player, so
you can gun down criminals with a
buddy. There are a total of 15
fairly brief stages, each ending
with a quick boss fight. The best
stage is where you fight through
Chinatown and have a showoff
against a gigantic gorilla.
Alas, ESWAT never lives up
to its potential. For starters, the
robotic suit, at least in the arcade
version, is rather bulky and silly
looking. Sure, your character might
be armed with machine guns, but
ultimately it doesn’t look all that
threatening. (Amusingly, according
to the diagrams of the suit in the
intro, the thing has a karaoke mic!)
 
Furthermore, you don’t even
get to control the robot suit in the
first couple of stages. No, you
begin playing as a regular boring
cop. It’s only after completing the
first two stages that you’re
“promoted“ into the cybersuit.
When you do finally get it, it’s not
all that impressive. You get a
machine gun instead of your
regular pistol and there are also a
handful of special weapons which
are fired from a cannon in the back
of the suit. But these are in
extremely short supply, look a bit
silly, and are way too slow to be
used effectively. Also, your life
meter doesn’t increase at all – you
can take four hits before you die,
with or without the suit. When you
take damage, little bits of the suit
fly off, exposing the human
underneath, which looks cool.
 
The concept is really the only
halfway remarkable thing about
the arcade release of ESWAT –
otherwise, it’s just another middle-
of-the-line arcade shooter.
 
The Master System port,
released only in North America and
Europe, is pretty bad. The graphics
are worse than most first
generation titles for the system,
with tiny sprites and terrible
animation. The bosses fall
somewhere between being badly
designed and stupidly hard, often
littering the screen with
unavoidable projectiles.
The levels are all brief and
barely have any obstacles. The
first two stages are more or less
replications of the arcade game,
but it goes in an entirely different
direction after that. The game does
get slightly better once you get the
suit, due to the rapid fire gun, but

154

it’s still poorly designed. This is
also the only version where you
can lose your suit if you take
enough damage. Unlike the other
ports you only have a single life,
but also a much longer life bar. At
least the redesigned suit looks
cool. There’s no more gorilla, but
you do get to fight a loincloth-
bearing barbarian who looks like
he wandered out of Golden Axe.
 
The Genesis version is a
completely different entity, almost
to the point where it feels like a
sequel. All of the levels and most
of the bosses are brand new – the
cyborg duo at the end of the
arcade game are now present in
the second stage of the Genesis
version, but that’s the extent of
the crossover. Most weapons
have unlimited ammo, and there’s
quite a bit more platforming. The
levels are also much longer than
the arcade version, but the two-
player mode is gone.
 
Similarly, the first two stages
are played as a regular human cop,
now given the name Duke Oda. By
the third stage you finally get your
cybersuit, and it’s substantially
cooler this time around. You no
longer have a machine gun as a
default weapon, and instead you
can collect a total of four extra
weapons which can be switched
between at any time. These
include a machine gun, a plasma
cannon, and a rocket launcher.
Even cooler is the Burner, which
allows you to fly.
The suit also allows you to
take a few more hits, although the
pieces no longer break off as you
take damage. The FIRE special
weapon damages everything on
the screen, but it can only be used
once, and it completely drains
your Burner meter.
 
The graphics of the Genesis
port, while grainy compared to the
arcade game, are generally better
designed with much more variety
and style. While some minor
issues are aggravating, such as an
underpowered default weapon, it’s
actually one of the better early
Genesis action titles, and it totally
outclasses the arcade game.
ESWAT was also released on
several computer platforms, all of
which are relatively faithful to the
arcade game, courtesy of US Gold
and Creative Materials. The Amiga
one is the best looking of the
bunch, although it’s rife with
slowdown, with the Atari ST
version looking just a bit worse,
and the Amstrad CPC port a step
down from that. The C64 port is
okay, but the number of enemies
has been cut down drastically, so
it’s not quite as action packed,
and the collision detection is a bit
dodgy. The same goes for the
Spectrum version, while its large
sprites also look awkward on the
small screen.
The cybersuits from ESWAT
(the Genesis variation with the
Burners) also makes a cameo in
the Dreamcast game Segagaga,
where you’ll encounter them worn
by enemy soldiers.

Alien Storm
Original Release: 1990
Platforms: ARC, GEN, SMS AMI,
AST, CPC, C64, ZX, 360, PS3,
WII, WIN
Alien Storm is essentially the
spiritual successor to Golden Axe.
Also directed by Makoto Uchida,
Sega’s expert on scrolling beat-em-
ups, the game switches from the
land of fantasy, swords and
barbarians to one of science-
fiction, lasers and aliens.
  
Mechanically, Alien Storm is
quite similar to its forebear, to the
point where the controls and
combos feel practically identical.
There are three characters: Gordon
is the male who wields a lightning
gun, Karla is a female with a
flamethrower, and Scooter is a
robot with a lightning whip. (They
are named Garth, Karen and
Slammer, respectively, in some
versions.) Similar to magic spells
there is a screen clearing attack,
which eats up a sizeable portion of
the player’s “Energy“ bar. Gordon
summons a helicopter, Karen calls
in a miniature nuke, and Scooter
detonates himself. Also, rather
than a jump button there is a roll
maneuver. In certain versions,
three players can also fight aliens
simultaneously. There are minor
differences between the two- and
three-player versions – Gordon and
Karla wear either red and yellow,
or blue and red, respectively, and
the levels are in a different order.
  
At times the action switches
to a first-person shooting gallery,
where the camera moves back and
forth as you control a targeting
reticule. Most of the scenery can
be destroyed, which in turn reveals
energy charging power-ups. While
mowing down bad guys and
scorching shelves of garbage is
fun, your cursor moves too slowly
to keep up with the enemies.
There are also a few auto-scrolling
running scenes, where your
character charges forward and
shoots bad guys.
  
While as functionally solid as
any other beat-em-up at the time,
Alien Storm is still a lesser game
than Golden Axe in just about
every aspect. There are no other
landscapes other than drably
ruined suburbs, cities and
laboratories. The alien designs are
cool, although not on the level of
Alien Syndrome. Though it runs on
the slightly more powerful System
18, the graphics are only
marginally improved. The music is
unusual, though the “Bad breath,
man!” speech clip is amusing.
  
 Each of your characters has
several weapons, including
grenades and bazookas, but these
cannot be used individually.
Instead, they’re just part of pre-
canned combo animations. Your
guns only shoot projectiles in the
auto-run segments, for example,
and the grenades are only used to
dispose of enemies which are lying
on the ground.
  
Outside of its initial arcade
release, Sega ported Alien Storm
to the Genesis and Master System,
though the latter was only released
in Europe and Brazil. While the
fundamentals are the same in all,
156

the level breakdowns and
backgrounds are different across
all three. The arcade and SMS
versions begin in a city block,
while the Genesis release starts
out on a farm. The SMS port has
an exclusive segment where you
run through the subway, while the
Genesis version also has an
additional level in a laboratory.
Outside of the final boss (a
gigantic brain with a single eye),
there is only one other boss in the
arcade version, which has three
different forms. These were
broken out into separate enemies
for the other versions.
  
While the Genesis release
looks almost identical to the
arcade version, it’s missing
numerous details. The arcade
game opens with our three heroes
working a food truck called “Alien
Burgers“. When the attack begins,
the sign flips over to reveal their
true name as “Alien Busters“,
before they launch into action. A
handful of enemies, including the
slime pools, are missing on the
Genesis. The scaling effects are
gone, and only two players can
play simultaneously.
  
The ending is a bizarre 1980s
music video, complete with
flashing colored lights, quick
flashes of random sprites, and the
three characters in the center of
the screen, goofily marching in
rhythm. In the arcade version,
when your game is over, you are
assigned a rank by a panel of
judges, including Gilius
Thunderhead from Golden Axe.
You are still ranked in the Genesis
version, but the cameos are
missing. If you pay attention, you
can also see references to other
Sega games on the TVs in the
electronics store.
  
The SMS version plays very
differently from the others. It’s
slower paced, enemies are killed in
one hit and characters can no
longer use combo attacks. There
are also only five levels in total,
multiplayer is absent, and
Karla/Karen is nowhere to be seen.
 
None of the home computer
ports are particularly good. The
Amiga and Atari ST versions look
the best of the bunch, though still
worse than the Genesis iteration,
with less colors and lousy
animation. All of them have
choppy, awkward gameplay, but
the Amstrad port is the pits, with
the 3D scenes being so sluggish
that they are essentially
unplayable. All of these versions
have a simultaneous two-player
mode, at least.

Belt-scrolling beat-em-ups are
typically serious business. The
likes of Double Dragon, Final

Despite this, there are a few that
take things in a much sillier
direction, including Sega’s
Dynamite Dux (sometimes spelled
Dynamite Düx, with an umlaut
over the ‘u’). To make an analogy,
Dynamite Dux is to Double Dragon
as Twinbee is to Xevious.
The “men fight to save
kidnapped woman” theme is still
present, although here, the men
are actually pet ducks named Bin
and Pin, who are trying to save
their owner Lucy from the evil
Achacha. The intro, where the
ducks and the girl are playing
around in a meadow before the
main bad guy appears out of
nowhere, was also borrowed for
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World (where
the question of who owns ducks
as pets is never fully addressed).
The stages are a hodgepodge
of barely cohesive themes, starting
off in a city, before warping to
ancient Japan, a jungle, off to
Brooklyn and Texas, and then to
the final lair of Achacha, which is
vaguely Egyptian.
It’s all an impossibly colorful
and silly game. Bin and Pin are
bright blue and red, respectively.
The major enemies are dogs with
gigantic jaws that take up
approximately 80% of their body
mass. Also present are cross-eyed
coyotes decked in army gear and
manning artillery cannons, as well
as rhinoceroses in American
football uniforms. Also running
around are penguins in the middle
of a desert, displaying not only a
total lack of understanding of
American geography, but also
climate zones.
Colonel Sanders, he of
Kentucky Fried Chicken, makes an
appearance right at the beginning,
and makes it his purpose to act as
a referee in the boxing match
bonus rounds. It’s a weird and
wonderfully detailed game,
meshing Warner Bros.-style
slapstick with the randomness of
Japanese humor, rendered in
beautiful late-1980s pixel artwork.
The only major disappointments
are the bosses, which consist of
generic things like rock monsters
and gigantic flames, and are
reused throughout.
Feathered Combat
The mechanics are a bit different
from typical beat-em-ups, in that
most enemies perish after a single
hit, and the game never stops and
waits for you to clear the enemies
before moving on. Most stages
also have a branching path
somewhere near the middle.
Also, since the ducks have
super-deformed proportions, their
limbs barely have any reach, and
combined with the occasionally
Dynamite Dux
Original Release: 1989
Platforms: ARC, AMI, AST, CPC,
C64, ZX, SMS

erratic movements and attacks of
the enemies, the hit detection feel
rather dodgy. You have a super
attack where you hold down the
attack button to wind up your arm
and deliver a knock-out uppercut,
with a super-sized fist, although it
too is slightly awkward to use.
There are numerous weapons
throughout each stage though,
and nearly all of them fire
projectiles, ranging from simple
rocks all the way up to
flamethrowers and bazookas.
 
On a fundamental level
Dynamite Dux isn’t really all that
special, but it’s an attractive game
with catchy music and a generally
goofy atmosphere, so it’s worth a
play through. It was designed by
Sega AM2, which was headed by
Yu Suzuki, although he doesn’t
appear to have actively worked on
this game. The bouncy main
theme was composed by Hiroshi
Kawaguchi, also well known for
composing the Space Harrier
theme and other Sega classics.
System Ports
The original arcade release was
developed for the Sega System 16
board, but Dynamite Dux was also
ported to a number of other
platforms, mostly home
computers. The most visually
faithful are the Amiga and Atari
ST ports, although the speed is a
bit too slow and there are
graphical tiles missing. While the
music made an acceptable
transition, there are no sound
effects. The Amstrad CPC,
Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum
have descending graphical quality
in that order, with no music
whatsoever bar the title screen in
the C64 version; they all play
fairly well, bar the scaling down of
the graphics and lack of two-
player modes. All of these were
developed by Core Design in the
UK and published by Activision.
The Commodore 64 version also
renames the main character Ben.
The only port handled by
Sega themselves is the Master
System version, which was
primarily released in PAL territories
and Brazil, seeing only a very small
distribution in America. Obviously
a scaled down 8-bit version of a
16-bit game isn’t going to look as
pretty, and it especially hurts a
game whose appeal relies heavily
on its visuals.  Still, it looks decent
enough for a Master System game
and plays a bit better than any of
the computer ports. Unfortunately
it’s missing the jungle stage. The
plot has also been altered so Bin is
Lucy’s human boyfriend, who has
been transformed into a duck. Pin
is not present since the two-player
mode is gone.
Sega hasn’t been too keen to
remember Dynamite Dux, having
never ported it anywhere else
outside of its initial releases.
However, Sega created a tribute
character in the 1996 3D fighting
game Sonic the Fighters named
Bean the Dynamite, who also
appears in Fighters Megamix.
Although he’s green rather
than blue (or red), he has the
same distinctive cowlick. Plus,
“Bean” is close to the Japanese
pronunciation of “Bin”, and his
nickname “The Dynamite” clarifies
that the relation to Dynamite Dux
was definitely intentional.

Many of the games covered in this
volume have been rereleased on
assorted compilations. What
follows is a listing of these
compilations, their featured
games, and a short note about
their quality. For more information,
please read the full articles.
Western Collections
Sega Ages Vol. 1 [SAT, NA/EU]
Compiles the Saturn ports of
OutRun, Space Harrier and After
Burner II, which were individual
releases in Japan. OutRun is
missing the extra arranged music,
After Burner II is missing the extra
“melody“ versions of a few tracks,
and Space Harrier is missing a
mostly pointless medley track.
Sega Arcade Gallery [GBA, NA]
Compiles ports of the arcade
versions of Hang-On, Space
Harrier, After Burner and OutRun.
Developed by Bits Studio. The
quality of the ports is generally
sub par.
Sega Smash Pack [GBA, NA]
Compiles ports of the Genesis
versions of Golden Axe, Sonic
Spinball and Ecco the Dolphin.
Developed by Codefire. Also not
very good.
Sega Smash Pack Vol. 1 [PC, NA]
Features emulations of the
Genesis versions of Altered Beast,
Golden Axe, OutRun and The
Revenge of Shinobi, plus Columns,
Phantasy Star II, Sonic Spinball
and Vectorman.

Western Sega Genesis Collections
Created specifically for the
Western market and ported by
Backbone, these compilations
include more games than their
Japanese counterparts, but the
features are not as complete. Only
the North American versions are
included and the galleries are not
nearly as extensive, though there
are several unlockable video
interviews. While you can turn off
the filters or enable progressive
scan, the display options are paltry
compared to M2’s ports, plus the
sound effects can be glitchy. The
music sounds better, however,
due to the audio being streamed
rather than emulated.
Sega Genesis Collection [PS2 /
PSP, NA/EU]
Includes Genesis versions of Alex
Kidd in the Enchanted Castle,
Altered Beast, Gain Ground,
Golden Axe I - III, Shadow Dancer,
Shinobi III, and Super Thunder
Blade, as well as several other
titles. The PS2 version also
includes the arcade version of
Altered Beast. Shadow Dancer is
missing from the EU release.
Sonic’s Ultimate Genesis
Collection / Sega Mega Drive
Ultimate Collection [PS3 / 360,
NA/EU]
Includes Genesis versions of all
games in the prior collection
(except Shadow Dancer), plus
several other titles. Fantasy Zone
(ARC), Space Harrier (ARC),
Altered Beast (ARC), Alien
Syndrome (ARC) and Golden Axe
Warrior (SMS) are unlockables.
Sega Classics Collection [PS2,
NA/EU]
Includes the 3D Sega Ages 2500
remakes of Space Harrier, OutRun,
Golden Axe, and Alien Syndrome
(NA only). Also includes Columns,
Bonanza Bros., Monaco GP and
Virtua Racing. Does not include
the original versions of any games.
Sega Ages 2500 Compilations
Many of the later releases of the
Sega Ages 2500 budget line are
compilations of older Sega games.
These are quite extensive, usually
containing multiple platform
versions of each game, regional
variations, scanned manuals and
assorted documents, plus other
material. There are numerous
display options, including
progressive scan and scanlines.
The emulators, developed by M2,
are generally excellent, though the
music emulation for the Genesis is
slightly off. The Sega Master
System versions let you choose
between PSG and FM synth, if the
option is available.

and Super Fantasy Zone (GEN).
Sega Vintage Collections
Like the Japanese Sega Ages
collections for the PS2, these
were all ported by M2. Again,
there are a variety of display
options included, as well as
several wallpapers. While you can
pick regional variations, it only has
a single platform rather than
multiple ports. However, each
game also has a brand new menu
song done in the style of the
original game.
Sega Vintage Collection: Alex Kidd
& Co [PS3 / X360, NA/EU/JP]
Includes Alex Kidd in Miracle
World (SMS) and The Revenge of

Tiger Electronics
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tiger
Electronics was a prolific toy company that sold
many handheld games. While simplistic
compared to Nintendo’s Game Boy (and roughly
on the same technological level as their Game &
Watch series), Tiger’s games were cheaper,
since they did not require the purchase of a
whole console, and featured many properties
unavailable on Nintendo’s platform. While there
were a good number of generic releases, Tiger
published several based on Sega properties,
including After Burner, Thunder Blade, Altered
Beast, Golden Axe, Space Harrier II, Shinobi,
and OutRun. Altered Beast and Golden Axe
were also released as miniature wristwatches.
 
Additionally, After Burner and OutRun
were released as much larger toys. After
Burner’s model is shaped like a cockpit, with a
throttle and a flight stick (which only moves left
and right). OutRun is shaped after a car
dashboard and includes a steering wheel. The
After Burner model is fairly common and
therefore relatively cheap, but the OutRun toy is
much harder to find.
Alex Kidd the Board Game
A board game based on the first Alex Kidd title
was also released in Japan. Dubbed Alex Kidd
in Miracle World Daibouken, it includes a
roulette wheel device that blurts out a small
handful of digitized speech samples.
164

There are two stories based on Wonder Boy in
Monster World – “Wonder Boy in Demon
World“ and “Wonder Boy in Ghost World“.
They were written by Mark Eyles and drawn by
M DJ Boyann (for Demon World) and Bojan
Djukac (for Ghost World). The story and
characters are based off of Wonder Boy in
Monster World, however loosely. They are
meant to be sequels to the Genesis game, and
have Shion taking off on new adventures. The
Western-style artwork doesn’t really do justice
to the games, being far grittier than the bright
and colorful Japanese style, and the blue-haired
protagonist looks rather out of place.
Shinobi was one of the most prolific, with five
different stories based on the games – “The
Dark Circle“, “Fear Pavilion“, “The Art of War“,
“Way of the Warrior“ and “Power of the
Elements“. They were written by Alan
McKenzie and drawn by Jon Haward. The story
and characters are based off of The Revenge of
Shinobi on the Sega Genesis.
There are two different stories based on Golden
Axe – “Citadel of Dead Souls” and “Plague of
Serpents”. They were written by Mark Eyles
and drawn by Mike White. The storyline takes
place after the end of Golden Axe II. “Plague of
Serpents” focuses almost entirely on Gilius
Thunderhead.
Other series covered in Sonic the Comic include
Decap Attack, Kid Chameleon, Shining Force,
Rocket Knight Adventures, Eternal Champions,
and Streets of Rage.
Unrelated to Sonic the Comic, there was also a
single issue comic published by Dark Horse
Comics based on the PS2 Shinobi, which acted
as a prologue to that game.
There is also a Golden Axe “novel”. Technically
it’s just an 85 page book that was included in
an issue of the British magazine Sega Power. It
was written by Andy Smith, the editor of Sega
Power. It’s sort of like FX Nine’s Worlds of
Power books, narrating the story and events
while offering hints on how to play the game.
Sonic the Comic and Others
Sonic the Comic was a series of comic books published by Fleetway in the United Kingdom between 1993
and 2002. Though the series obviously focused on Sonic, throughout the years there were also stories based
on other Sega properties. The stories were spread over multiple issues, so each month a given series only
had a small handful of pages devoted to it.
165

 
166
TV Shows
The classic cartoon Muppet Babies features a
surprisingly obscure Sega reference. In the episode
“It’s Only Pretendo”, Gonzo gets a video game
system and imagines himself and the rest of his
friends inside a variety of games. Amongst more
popular titles like Donkey Kong and Frogger, they
also end up piloting Opa-Opa in Fantasy Zone. Even
more strangely, they are playing the TurboGrafx-16
version of the game. The episode even features
other relatively obscure games like Keith Courage in
Alpha Zones. Unfortunately due to assorted rights
issues, the series has not been released on DVD.
 
The Spanish show Que Vida Mas Triste is done
in the style of a video blog, starring a young man
named Borja who talks to the camera. He lives a
rather nerdy life, so the show is full of silly
references to video games. In one episode, he
discusses Alex Kidd for the Master System, talking
about how it was one of the most difficult games of
his childhood and how he could never beat it. He
finally overcomes this hurdle and completes the
game, which grants him Alex Kidd’s powers,
including super strength, telekinesis, and
teleportation. It’s a little weird, because these are
skills which Alex doesn’t have.
Famicom Bouken Game Books
In the early 1990s, Scholastic published a series of
books called “Worlds of Power”, which were
novelizations of various Nintendo games. There were
similar publications in Japan, going under the label
“Famicom Bouken Game Book”, published by
Futabasha. Though most of these titles were based
on games for Nintendo systems, there were two
based on Fantasy Zone, and one on Space Harrier.
 
The books are similar to the Fighting Fantasy
book series, where the reader makes decisions at
certain points, which tells them to turn to different
pages. There is also a simple role-playing system
where each of the story’s protagonists have
different skills, and dice rolls are used to resolve
conflicts with enemies or other similar scenarios.
 
The Fantasy Zone books are subtitled “Invader
from Another Planet” and “Journey to Outer Space”,
and are obviously not canon. They star a young boy
named Akira, from Plaleaf, who is joined by
Opa-Opa, the dragon Lavender, and a young girl
named Lilith. During the adventures, they travel to
the planets of the game and encounter the same
enemies. There are numerous illustrations, which are
amusing because, unlike the games, Opa-Opa is
drawn with facial features.
 
The Space Harrier one is subtitled “The White
Dragon Hero”, presumably referring to Uriah. The
hero looks a bit like J.J. from Zillion.

 
Other Cameos
In 2008 Sega released Sega Superstars Tennis,
developed by Sumo Digital, the same team behind
the home ports of OutRun 2. Much like Mario
Tennis, it’s a goofy, lighthearted game loosely based
on the sport, whose main appeal lies in all of the
Sega cameos. Most of the characters and courts are
based on Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as other
assorted post-Genesis properties like NiGHTS into
Dreams, Super Monkey Ball, Samba de Amigo, and
Jet Set Radio.
There are a few references to older games
though – Gilius Thunderhead from Golden Axe, and
Alex Kidd from... well, the Alex Kidd games, both
appear as playable characters. However, their
character models are a bit lame – Gilius seems to
have put on some weight and looks remarkably
lumpy, while Alex has a hugely malformed head.
There is also a bonus minigame based on Space
Harrier, where you need to swat baseballs at famous
enemies from the original arcade game, including
stone heads, bouncing mushrooms, and spaceships.
 
In 2010, Sumo developed Sonic and Sega All-
Stars Racing which, like Super Mario Kart,
assembles various Sega mascots into a racing game.
Again, many of the characters are based on more
recent properties, but a few older characters snuck
in as well. Alex Kidd (now looking much less stupid
than his Sega Superstars Tennis alter ego) rides on
his Sukopako Motorcycle, while Opa-Opa from
Fantasy Zone can fly. Mobo and Robo from Bonanza
Bros. round out the classic Sega roster. The
achievements and trophies are also references to
various Sega games, and include Shadow Dancing,
Gaining Ground, Death Adder, Magical Sound
Shower (a song from OutRun) and Red Out (a song
from After Burner).
 
Gilius Thunderhead was planned for inclusion,
and was meant to ride the Chicken Leg Bizarrian,
although he didn't make the final cut. However, he
was later included in the 2012 sequel, Sonic & All-
Stars Racing Transformed. Joe Musashi from
Shinobi also appears. There are tracks based on
Golden Axe (featuring the skeleton from the player
select screen), After Burner, and OutRun, as well as
numerous remixes of songs by Richard Jacques.
Gunstar Super Heroes, developed by Treasure
and published in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance,
has quite a bit of Sega fan service as well. In one
segment, you ride on top of a ship, wildly rotating
the screen to dodge enemy fire, a reference to
“super scaler” games like After Burner. It’s mightily
impressive because it’s so smooth, but there’s also
plenty of flicker, demonstrating that the portable
machine released in 2001 still can’t match arcade
hardware from 1987. Another stage is similar to
Thunder Blade, though without the forced scrolling.
167

 
168
Segagaga
Segagaga is a late-generation Dreamcast game
released only in Japan that’s filled with Sega fan
service. While previous sections in this book,
including Alex Kidd (pg. 98) and ESWAT (pg. 154)
reference some cameos in this game, there are tons
of other references to Sega’s classic properties. The
most amusing is the section at the end, where the
hero, Tarou Sega, must fly into space while being
joined by other Sega characters. He pilots a ship
called the R720, an advanced version of the R360
arcade cabinet used for G-LOC. The Bad Brothers
from Golden Axe also rise up from beneath a
building, similar to the mechs in Neon Genesis
Evangelion. The ultimate battle is a machine that
transforms into several different Sega machines,
including the SG-1000, Mega Drive, and Saturn,
while it lobs assorted character sprites at you.
