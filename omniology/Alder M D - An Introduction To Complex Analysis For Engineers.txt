Preface
These
notes
are
in
tended
to
b
e
of
use
to
Third
y
ear
Electrical

Elec-

at
the
Univ

There
are
man
y
text
b
o
oks
for
just
this
purp
ose,
and
I
ha
v
e
insucien
t
time
to
write
a
text
b
o
ok,
so
this
is
not
a
substitute
for,
sa
y
,
Matthews
and
Ho
w-
ell's
Complex
A
nalysis
for
Mathematics
and
Engine
ering,[
],
but
p
erhaps
a
complemen
t
to
it.
A
t
the
same
time,
kno
wing
ho
w
reluctan
t
studen
ts
are
to
use
a
textb
o
ok
(except
as
a
talisman
to
w
ard
o
evil)
I
ha
v
e
tried
to
mak
e
these
notes
sucien
t,
in
that
a
studen
t
who
reads
them,
understands
them,
and
do
es
the
exercises
in
them,
will
b
e
able
to
use
the
concepts
and
tec
h-
niques
in
later
y
ears.
It
will
also
get
the
studen
t
comfortably
through
the
examination.
The
shortness
of
the
course,
0
lectures,
for
co
v
ering
Complex
Analysis,
either
presupp
oses
genius
(
	0%
p
erspiration)
on
the
part
of
the
studen
ts
or
material
skipp
ed.
These
notes
are
in
tended
to
ll
in
some
of
the
gaps
that
will
inevitably
o
ccur
in
lectures.
It
is
a
source
of
some
disapp
oin
t-
men
t
to
me
that
I
can
co
v
er
so
little
of
what
is
a
b
eautiful
sub
ject,
ric
h
in
applications
and
connections
with
other
areas
of
mathematics.
This
is,
then,
a
sort
of
sampler,
and
only
touc
hes
the
elemen
ts.
St
yles
of
Mathematical
presen
tation
c
hange
o
v
er
the
y
ears,
and
what
w
as
deemed
acceptable
rigour
b
y
Euler
and
Gauss
fails
to
k
eep
mo
dern
purists
con
ten
t.
McLac
hlan,
[],
clearly
smarted
under
the
criticisms
of
his
presen-
tation,
and
he
go
es
to
some
trouble
to
explain
in
later
editions
that
the
b
o
ok
is
in
tended
for
a
dieren
t
audience
from
the
purists
who
damned
him.
My
exp
erience
leads
me
to
feel
that
the
need
for
rigour
has
b
een
dev
elop
ed
to
the
p
oin
t
where
the
in
tuitiv
e
and
geometric
has
b
een
stun
ted.
Both
ha
v
e
a
part
in
mathematics,
whic
h
gro
ws
out
of
the
conict
b
et
w
een
them.
But
it
seems
to
me
more
imp
ortan
t
to
p
enetrate
to
the
ideas
in
a
slopp
y
,
scruy
but
serviceable
w
a
y
,
than
to
reduce
a
sub
ject
to
predicate
calculus
and
omit
the
whole
reason
for
studying
it.
There
is
no
kno
wn
means
of
p
ersuading
a
hardheaded
engineer
that
a
sub
ject
merits
his
time
and
energy
when
it
has
b
een
turned
in
to
an
elab
orate
game.
He,
or
increasingly
she,
w
an
ts
to
see
t
w
o
elemen
ts
at
an
early
stage:
pro
cedures
for
solving
problems
whic
h
mak
e
a
dierence
and
concepts
whic
h
organise
the
pro
cedures
in
to
something
in
telli-
gible.
Carried
to
excess
this
leads
to
a
v
oidance
of
abstraction
and
consequen
t


loss
of
p
o
w
er
later;
there
is
a
go
o
d
reason
for
the
purist's
desire
for
rigour.
But
it
asks
to
o
m
uc
h
of
a
third
y
ear
studen
t
to
fo
cus
on
the
underlying
logic
and
omit
the
geometry
.
I
ha
v
e
delib
erately
erred
in
the
opp
osite
direction.
It
is
easy
enough
for
the
studen
t
with
a
taste
for
rigour
to
clarify
the
ideas
b
y
consulting
other
b
o
oks,
and
to
wind
up
as
a
logician
if
that
is
his
c
hoice.
But
it
is
hard
to
nd
in
the
literature
an
y
explicit
commitmen
t
to
getting
the
studen
t
to
dra
w
lots
of
pictures.
It
used
to
b
e
tak
en
for
gran
ted
that
a
studen
t
w
ould
do
that
sort
of
thing,
but
no
w
that
the
sc
ho
ol
syllabus
has
had
Euclid
expunged,
the
undergraduates
cannot
b
e
exp
ected
to
see
dra
wing
pictures
or
visualising
sur-
faces
as
a
natural
prelude
to
calculation.
There
is
a
sc
ho
ol
of
though
t
whic
h
considers
geometric
visualisation
as
immoral;
and
another
whic
h
sanctions
it
only
if
done
in
priv
ate
(and
w
ash
y
our
hands
b
efore
and
afterw
ards).
T
o
m
y
mind
this
imp
oses
sterilit
y
,
and
constitutes
an
attempt
b
y
the
bureaucrat
to
strangle
the
artist.

While
I
do
not
w
an
t
to
imp
ose
m
y
informal
images
on
an
yb
o
dy
,
if
no
men
tion
is
made
of
informal,
in
tuitiv
e
ideas,
man
y
studen
ts
nev
er
realise
that
there
are
an
y
.
All
the
go
o
d
mathematicians
I
kno
w
ha
v
e
a
ric
h
supply
of
informal
mo
dels
whic
h
they
use
to
think
ab
out
mathematics,
and
it
w
ere
as
w
ell
to
sho
w
studen
ts
ho
w
this
ma
y
b
e
done.
Since
this
seems
to
b
e
the
resp
ect
in
whic
h
most
of
the
text
b
o
oks
are
w
eak
est,
I
ha
v
e
p
erhaps
gone
to
o
far
in
the
other
direction,
but
then,
I
do
not
oer
this
as
a
text
b
o
ok.
More
of
an
an
tidote
to
some
of
the
others.
I
ha
v
e
talk
ed
to
Electrical
Engineers
ab
out
Mathematics
teac
hing,
and
they
are
strikingly
consisten
t
in
what
they
w
an
t.
Prior
to
talking
to
them,
I
feared
that
I'd
nd
Engineers
sa
ying
things
lik
e
`Don't
b
other
with
the
ideas,
forget
ab
out
the
pictures,
just
train
them
to
do
the
sums'.
There
are,
alas,
Mathematicians
who
are
con
vinced
that
this
is
ho
w
Engineers
see
the
w
orld,
and
I
had
supp
osed
that
there
migh
t
b
e
something
in
this
b
elief.
Silly
me.
In
fact,
it
is
simply
quite
wrong.
The
Engineers
I
sp
ok
e
to
w
an
t
Mathematicians
to
get
across
the
abstract
ideas
in
terms
the
studen
ts
can
grasp
and
use,
so
that
the
Engineers
can
subsequen
tly
rely
on
the
studen
t
ha
ving
those
ideas
as
part
of
his
or
her

The
bureaucratic
temp
er
is
attracted
to
mathematics
while
still
at
sc
ho
ol,
b
ecause
it
app
ears
to
b
e
all
ab
out
follo
wing
rules,
something
the
bureaucrat
c
herishes
as
the
solution
to
the
problems
of
life.
Human
b
eings

the
other
hand
nd
this
sucien
tly
rep
ellan
t
to
b
e
put
o
mathematics
p
ermanen
tly
,
whic
h
is
one
of
the
ironies
of
education.
My
o
wn
attitude
to
the
bureaucratic
temp
er
is
rather
that
of
Da
v
e
Allen's
feelings
ab
out
p
oliticians.
He
has
a
soft
sp
ot
for
them.
It's


thinking.
Ab
o
v
e
all,
they
w
an
t
the
studen
ts
to
ha
v
e
clear
pictures
in
their
heads
of
what
is
happ
ening
in
the
mathematics.
Since
this
is
exactly
what
an
y
comp
eten
t
Mathematician
also
w
an
ts
his
studen
ts
to
ha
v
e,
I
ha
v
en't
felt
an
y
need
to
c
hange
m
y
usual
st
yle
of
presen
tation.
This
is
informal
and
user-friendly
as
far
as
p
ossible,
with
(b
ecause
I
am
a
T
op
ologist
b
y
training
and
w
ork
with
Engineers
b
y
c
hoice)
a
strong
geometric
a
v
our.
I
in
tro
duce
Complex
Num
b
ers
in
a
w
a
y
whic
h
w
as
new
to
me;
I
p
oin
t
out
that
a
certain
subspace
of



matrices
can
b
e
iden
tifed
with
the
plane
R

,
th
us
giving
a
simple
rule
for
m
ultiplying
t
w
o
p
oin
ts
in
R

:
turn
them
in
to
matrices,
m
ultiply
the
matrices,
then
turn
the
answ
er
bac
k
in
to
a
p
oin
t.
I
do
it
this
w
a
y
b
ecause
(a)
it
dem
ysties
the
business
of
imaginary
n
um
b
ers,
(b)
it
giv
es
the
Cauc
h
y-Riemann
conditions
in
a
conceptually
transparen
t
manner,
and
(c)
it
emphasises
that
m
ultiplication
b
y
a
complex
n
um
b
er
is
a
similarit
y
together
with
a
rotation,
a
matter
whic
h
is
at
the
heart
of
m
uc
h
of
the
applicabilit
y
of
the
complex
n
um
b
er
system.
There
are
a
few
other
adv
an
tages
of
this
approac
h,
as
will
b
e
seen
later
on.
After
I
had
done
it
this
w
a
y
,
Malcolm
Ho
o
d
p
oin
ted
out
to
me
that
Copson,
[],
had
tak
en
the
same
approac
h.

Engineering
studen
ts
lead
a
fairly
busy
life
in
general,
and
the
Sparkies
ha
v
e
a
particularly
demanding
load.
They
are
also
v
ery
practical,
righ
tly
so,
and
impatien
t
of
an
ything
whic
h
they
susp
ect
is
academic
windo
w-dressing.
So
far,
I
am
with
them
all
the
w
a
y
.
They
are,
ho
w
ev
er,
the
main
source
of
the
b
elief
among
some
mathematicians
that
p
eddling
recip
es
is
the
only
w
a
y
to
teac
h
them.
They
do
not
feel
comfortable
with
abstractions.
Their
goal
tends
to
b
e
examination
passing.
So
there
is
some
basic
opp
osition
b
et
w
een
the
studen
ts
and
me:
I
w
an
t
them
to
b
e
able
to
use
the
material
in
later
y
ears,
they
w
an
t
to
memorise
the
minim
um
required
to
pass
the
exam
(and
then
forget
it).
I
exaggerate
of
course.
F
or
reasons
o
wing
to
geograph
y
and
history
,
this
Univ
ersit
y
is
particularly
fortunate
in
the
qualit
y
of
its
studen
ts,
and
most
of
them
resp
ond
w
ell
to
the
disco
v
ery
that
Mathematics
mak
es
sense.
I
hop
e
that
these
notes
will
turn
out
to
b
e
enjo
y
able
as
w
ell
as
useful,
at
least
in
retrosp
ect.
But
b
e
w
arned:

I
am
most
grateful
to
Malcolm
for
running
an
editorial
ey
e
o
v
er
these
notes,
but
ev
en
more
grateful
for
b
eing
a
mo
del
of
sanit
y
and
decency
in
a
w
orld
that
sometimes
seems
b
ereft
of
b
oth.

`
W
ell

I

Then

no

than
the

of

Or
t
w

for
that
matter.
All

are
just

Since

Daft,

but
let

b

This
has
b
een
put
in
the
form
of
a
story:
A
(male)
Mathematician
and
a
(male)
Engineer
who
knew
eac

had
b
oth

een
in

They
w

standing
at
one
corner
of

and
ey
eing
a
particularly
attractiv
e
girl
in
the
opp

corner.
`W

said
the
Engineer.
`I
think
I'll
go
o

there
and
try

y
luc
k.'
`Imp
ossible,
and
out
of
the
question!'
said
the
Mathematician,
who
w
as
thinking
m
uc
h
the
same
but
w
asn't
as
forthrigh
t.
`And
wh
y
is
it
imp
ossible?'
ask
ed
the
Engineer
b
elligeren
tly
.
`Because,'
said
the
Mathematician,
thinking
quic
kly
,
`In
order
to
get
to
her,
y
ou
will
rst
ha
v
e
to

And
then
y
ou
will
ha
v
e
to
get
half
of
the
rest
of
the
distance,
and
then
half
of
that.
And
so
on;
in
short,
y
ou
can
nev
er
get
there
in
a
nite
n
um
b
er
of
mo
v
es.'
The
Engineer
ga
v
e
a
c
heerful
grin.
`Ma
yb
e
so,'
he
replied,
`But
in
a
nite
n
um
b
er
of

v
es,
I
can
get
as
close
as
I
need
to

e

And
he
made
his
mo
v

They

It

that

Wh

In

in

b
o
ok,
y
ou
are
going
to
ha
v
e
to
do
a
lot
of
w

This
will
consist
mainly
of
c
hewing
a
p
encil
or
p
en
as
y
ou
struggle
to
do
some
sums.
Maths
is
lik
e
that.
Hours
of
y
our
life
will
pass
doing
this,
when
y
ou
could

whatev
er.
There

e
some
p
oin
t
to
this,

t?
There
is,
but
it
isn't
altogether
easy
to
tell
y
ou
exactly
what
it
is,
b
ecause
y
ou
can
only
really
see
the

Y
ou
are
probably
quite
glad
no

that

ou

y
ou
w

but
it
migh
t
ha

seemed
a
drag
at
the
time.
T
rust
me.
It
will
all
b
e
w
orth
it
in
the
end.
If
this
do
esn't
altogether
con
vince
y
ou,
then
talk
to
the
Engineering
Lec-
turers
ab
out
what
happ
ens
in
their
courses.

the

Whatev

if

Another
reason
for
doing
it
is
that
it

I

W

what

But

Y

So
I

In

I

The

What

are

They
are
t
w
o-dimensional,
whereas
the
Real
n

are
one

they
form
a
line.
The
fact
that
complex

is
probably
the
most
imp

Of

whic

The

is
useful
when

Whic

The
Geometry
of

b

The
rst
thing
to
note
is
that
as
far
as
addition
and
scaling
are
concerned,
w
e
are
in
R

,
so
there
is
nothing
new.

and
if
y
ou
do
this
in
the
p

t
notation,
y
ou
are
just
doing
rst
y
ear
linear
algebra
again.
I
shall
assume
that
y
ou
can
do
this
and
don't
nd
it
v
ery
exciting.
Life
starts
to
get
more
in
teresting
if
w
e
lo
ok
at
the
geometry
of
m
ultiplication.
F
or
this,
the
matrix
form
is
going
to
mak
e
our
life
simpler.
First,
note
that
an
y
complex
n
um
b
er
can
b
e
put
in
the
form
r
(cos

+
i
sin

),
whic
h
is
a
real
n
um
b
er
m
ultiplying
a
complex
n
um
b
er
of
mo
dulus
.
This
means
that
it
is
a
m
ultiple
of
some
p
oin
t
lying
on
the
unit
circle,
if
w
e
think
in
terms
of
p
oin
ts
in
the
plane.
If
w
e
tak
e
r
p
ositiv
e,
then
this
expression
is
unique
up
to
m
ultiples
of

;
if
r
is
zero
then
it
isn't.
I
shall
NEVER
tak
e
r
negativ
e
in
this
course,
and
it
is
b
etter
to
ha
v
e
nothing
to
do
with
those
lo
w-life
who
ha
v
e
b
een
seen
doing
it
after
dark.
If
w
e
write
this
in
matrix
form,
w
e
get
a
m
uc
h
clearer
picture
of
what
is
happ
ening:
the
complex
n
um
b
er
comes
out
as
the
matrix:
r

cos

 sin

sin

cos

If
y
ou
stop
to
think
ab
out
what
this
matrix
do
es,
y
ou
can
see
that
the
r
part
merely
stretc
hes
ev
erything
b
y
a
factor
of
r
.
If
r
=

then
distances
from
the
origin
get
doubled.
Of
course,
if
0
<
r
<

then
the
stretc
h
is
actually
a
compression,
but
I
shall
use
the
w
ord
`stretc

in
general.

b
y
an

in
the
p
ositiv
e
(an

sense.
It
follo
ws
that

b

a

is
a

of

I

quite

Dr
aw
the
fth
r
o
ots
on

e
(or
a
c
opy
of
it).
Example
..
Dr
aw
two
str
aight
lines
at
right
angles
to
e
ach
other
in
the
c
omplex
plane.
Now
cho
ose
a
c
omplex
numb
er,
z
,
not
e
qual
to
zer
o,
and
multiply
every
p
oint
on
e
ach

by

.
I
claim
that
the
r
esult
has
to
b
e
two
str
aight
lines,
stil
l
cutting
at
right
angles.
Solution
The
smart
way
is
to
p
oint
out
that
a
sc
aling
of
the
p
oints
along
a
str
aight
line
by
a
p
ositive
r
e
al
numb
er
takes
it
to
a
str
aight
line
stil
l,
and
r
otating
a
str
aight
line
le
aves
it
as
a
str
aight
line.
So
the
lines
ar
e
stil
l
lines
after
the
tr
ansformation.
A
rigid
r
otation
won
't
change
an
angle,
nor
wil
l
a
uniform
sc
aling.
So
the
claim
has
to
b
e
c
orr
e
ct.
In
fact
multiplic
ation
by
a
non-zer
o
c
omplex
numb
er,
b
eing
just
a
uniform
sc
aling
and
a
r
otation,
must
le
ave
any
angle
b
etwe
en
lines
unchange
d,
not
just
right
angles.
The
dumb
way
is
to
use
algebr
a.
L
et
one
line
b
e
the
set
of
p
oints
L

fw

C

w

R
g
for
w
0
and
w

some
xe
d
c
omplex
numb
ers,
and
t

R
.
Then
tr
ansforming
this
set
by
multiplying
everything
in
it
by
z
gives
z
L
=
fw

C
:
w
=
z
w
0
+
tz
w

;
	t

R

which
is

l
a
str
aight
line
(thr
ough
z
w

in
the

e
ction
of

w

If
the


C
:
w


;
	t

R

then
the
same
applies
to
this
line
to

If
the

L

ar

at

then
the

so
it
is

The
ab
o
v
e
problem
and
the
t
w
o
solutions
that
go
with
it
carry
an
imp
ortan
t
moral.
It
is
this:
If
y
ou
can
see
what
is
going
on,
y
ou
can
solv
e
some
problems
instan
tly
just
b
y
lo
oking
at
them.
And
if
y
ou
can't,
then
y
ou
just
ha
v
e
to
plug
a
w
a
y
doing
algebra,
with
a
serious
risk
of
making
a
slip
and
w
asting
hours
of
y
our
time
as
w
ell
as
getting
the
wrong
answ
er.
Seeing
the
patterns
that
mak
e
things
happ
en
the
w
a
y
they
do
is
quite
in
ter-
esting,
and
it
is
b
oring
to
just
plug
a
w
a
y
at
algebra.
So
it
is
w
orth
a
bit
of
trouble
trying
to
understand
the
stu
as
opp
osed
to
just
memorising
rules
for
doing
the
sums.
If
y
ou
can
c
heerfully
hop
to
the
matrix
represen
tation
of
complex
n
um
b
ers,
some
things
are
blindingly
ob
vious
that
are
completely
obscure
if
y
ou
just
learn
the
rules
for
m
ultiplying
complex
n
um
b
ers
in
the
classical
form.
This
is
generally
true
in
Mathematics,
if
y

then

If

These

and
there's
a

I

v

in

t
b

indeed
a
v

exciting
b

but
rather
densely

The

Kro

P

assume
that
y

extremely

This
ma
y
not

an

The

It

of

Old

still

I
prefer
the
term
shift.
So
an

is
just
a
linear

with
a
shift.
The
terms
`function',
`transformation',
`map',
`mapping'
all
mean
the

I
recommend
map.
It

Wher

do
es

the
p

ar

al

of

If
you

the

is

if

it

Then

When

It

Notice

whic

an

The

sort
of

is
true
for

there

The

This
is
telling
y

that
an

In

Y

This

of
the
claim
that

b

has
precisely
t
w

square
ro

there
is
one,
and
it
is
long
and
subtle,
b
ecause
formalising
our

ab

made

is
quite
tric
ky
.
This
is

the

that

So
ho

dened

from

that

a

In

w

ha

e
that
there

t
w

one

except
when
they
coincide
at

The
square
ro
ot
is
tak
en
to
b
e
the
p
ositiv
e
one.
The
situation
for
the
complex
plane
is
not
nearly
so
neat,
and
the
reason
is
that
as
w
e
go
around
the
circle,
lo
oking
for
square
ro

w
e
go
con
tin
uously
from

Start

and
y
ou
will
surely
agree
that
the
ob

for

Pro

T

a

simply

By
the
time

y

gone
through

and
the
pre-

So
whereas
the

t

in
the
case
of

and
y

for

there
are
con

paths
from

whic
h
can
go
just
ab
out
an

Remem
b

that
a

that

W

insist
that

So
the
complications
I
ha
v
e
outlined
to
force
the
square
ro
ot
to
b
e
a

are
designed
to
mak

our

In

w

can
simply

t

that

w

w

at

when

In

things
are
more
complicated.
The

to
sa

that

W

Y
ou
migh
t
think
that
asking
ab
out
Riemann

is
an
idle
question
prompted
b
y
nothing
more
than
a
desire
to
dra
w
complicated
surfaces,
but
it
turns
out
to
b
e
imp
ortan
t
and
v
ery
practical
to
try
to
construct
these
surfaces.
The
main
reason
is
that
w
e
shall
w
an
t
to
b
e
able
to
in
tegrate
along
curv

in

and
w

don't

The
Riemann

asso

with
the

and

w
as
a

whic
h
w

of

C
,
and
whic
h
pro

do

Then
w
e
split
the
squaring
map
up
so
that
it
w
as
made
up
of
another
map
in
to
the
Riemann
surface
follo
w
ed
b
y
the
pro
jection.
Actually
,
the
Riemann
surface
is
just
the
graph
of
w


,
but
instead
of
trying
to
picture
it
in
four
dimensions,
w
e
put
it
in
three
dimensions
and
tried
not
to
think
ab
out
the
self-in
tersection
this
caused.
W
e
could
construct
the
ab

as
follo

rst
think
of

sa
y
I
start
with
the
ordinary
real

ro

on
the
p
ositiv

This
determines
uniquely
the
v
alue
of
the
square
ro
ot
on
the
sector,
since
w
=
z

is
one-one
here,
so
the
square
ro
ot
is
just
half
the
sector.
I
can
do
the

for
another
sector
on
whic

the
square
is
still
one-one,
sa
y
the

where
the

This

I
disco

so
instead

I
lift

I

When

What

I
do

Now
I

Then

The

that

It

y

There

a

w

y
of

whic

nd
in

but
the
metho
d
is
not
actually
shorter
than
solving
the
linear
equa-
tions
in
general,
so
I
shall
not
burden
y
our
memory
with
it.
It
is
p
ossible,
ho
w
ev
er,
to
use
some
in
telligence
in
selecting
the
p
oin

Example
..
Find
a
M
obius
function
which
takes
the
interior
of
the
unit
disk
to
the
half
plane
with
p
ositive
imaginary
p
art.
Solution
We
have
to
have
the
unit
cir
cle
going
to
the
r
e
al
axis,
so
we
might
as
wel
l
send

to
0.
We
c
an
also
send
 
to
.
Final
ly,
if
we
send
0
to
i
we
have
our
thr
e
e
p

The
 

c

that
we

we
have

b

while

So
a

Could

The
answ

is
that
the

is

as
far

h

b

assuming

ecause
the
incremen
ts
ha
v
e
fallen
b
elo
w
the
precision
of

our
ma-
c
hine.
F
or
this
reason,
it
is
of
v
ery
considerable
practical
imp
ortance
to
b
e
able
to
decide
if
a

con

It

This

The
situation
for

is
fairly
go

the

This

There

a

tigh
ter
denition

whic
h
I
shall
come
to

I

this

and
y

kno
w
it
so
that
y
ou
don't
panic
when
it
is
sprung

V

often
the

tell

ou
an
a

lot
ab
out
it,
and
they
come
up
in
Engineering
and
Ph

rep

.
There
is
another
denition
of
the
term
`analytic'
whic
h
mak
es
sense
for
real
v
alued
functions,
and
is
concerned
with
them
agreeing
with
their
T

at
ev

The
t
w

are
in

v

closely
related,
but
this
is
a
little
to
o
adv

here.
I
men

it
in
case
y
ou

the

denition
and
are
confused.
The
term
`complex
analytic'
is
sometimes
used
for
the
form
I
ha

giv

Some
authors
insist
on
using
`holomorphic'
un
til
they

sho

that
holomorphic

in

analytic
in
the
sense
of
agreeing
with
their
T
a
ylor
expansion
(a
Theorem
of

Then
the
theorem
states
that
holomorphic
complex

are
analytic.
The

it

This

true
for
ev
ery
circle
whic
h
has
f
dened
ev

inside

and
on
its

This
giv
es
a

w

of
solving

for

of

when

All

giv

and
then
go
through

of

with
an
a

of

This
only
giv
es
an
appro
ximation,
but
that
is
all
y
ou
ev
er
get
an
yw
a
y
.
One
of
the
w
a
ys
of
trying
to
understand
functions
from
R

to
R

is
to
think
of
them
as
a
pair
of
functions
from
R

to
R
,
the
rst
giving
the
function
u(x;
y
)
and
the
second
v
(x;
y
).
This
means
that
w
e
can
dra
w
the
graphs
of
eac
h
function.
While
not
en
tirely
useless,
this
is
not
alw
a
ys
illuminating.
It
do
es
ha
v
e
its
merits
ho
w
ev
er,
when
considering
harmonic
functions.
The
reason
is
simple:
if
@
u
=@
x
=
@
v
=@
y
then
@

u=@
x

=
@

v
=@
x@
y
,
whic
h
is
equal
to
@

v
=@
y
@
x
pro
viding
the
mixed
partial
deriv
ativ
es
are
equal.
This
will
b
e
the
case
if
f
is
analytic.
And
if
@
u
=@
y
=
 @
v
=@
x
then
@

u
=@
y

=
 @

v
=@
y
@
x
.
Hence
pro
vided
f
is
analytic
w
e
ha
v
e:
@

u
=@
x

+
@

u=@
y

=
0
whic
h
is
to
sa
y
,
u
is
harmonic.
It
is
trivial
to
c
hec
k
that
v
is
harmonic
b
y
the
same
argumen
t
applied
to
v
.
Not
only
are
b
oth
functions
harmonic,
they
are
said
to
b
e
c
onjugate
har-
monic

b
ecause
they
are
related
b
y
the
CR

F

n

b
er
of
sp
ecial
prop
erties
hold:
for
example,
their
pro
duct,
and
the
dierence
of
their
squares,
are
also
harmonic.
The
argumen
t
is
rather
neat:
If
f
is
analytic,
so
is
f

.
This
follo
ws
b
ecause
the
pro
duct
of
analytic
functions
is
analytic.
If
f
=
u
+
iv
then
f

=
(u

 v

)
+
i(uv
).
Hence
uv
is
harmonic,
and
so
is
an
y
m
ultiple
of
it
for

ob
vious
reasons.
Similarly
u

 v

is
harmonic,
and
so
is
its
negativ
e.
They
are,
of
course,
conjugate.
It
is
not
true
generally
that
the
pro
duct
of

functions
is
harmonic.

Find

gone
on
in
to
w
orking
out
whic
h
functions
are
harmonic
and
whic
h
aren't.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
if

to

then
it

if

There

Moreo
v
er,
although
the
edges
of
the
rectangle
w
ere
sen
t
to
curv
es,
the
curv
es
in
tersected
at
righ
t
angles.
The
only
exception
w
as
the
case
when
f
(z

=


and
the
corner
w
as
at
the

The
question
w
as
ask
ed,
wh
y
is
this
happ
ening
and
wh
y
is
there
an
exception
in
the
one
case?
If
y
ou
are
really
smart
y
ou
will
ha
v
e
seen
the
answ
er:
if
y
ou
tak
e
a
corner
where
the
edges
are
lines
in
tersecting
at
righ
t
angles,
then
if
the

f
is
an-
alytic
at
the
corner,
it
ma
y
b
e
appro
ximated
b
y
its
deriv
ativ
e
there.
And
this
means
that
in
a
sucien
tly
small
neigh
b
ourho
o
d,
the
map
is
appro
ximable
as
an

together
with
a

And
m
ultiplication
b
y
a

is
just
a
rotation
and
a

y
.
None
of
these
will
stop

a

The
only
exception
is
when

when

It

that

an

Discussion
Since
w
e
ha
v
e
discussed
dieren
tiating
complex
functions,
it
is
no
w
natural
to
turn
to
the
problem
of
in
tegrating
them.
Bro
o
ding
on
what
it
migh
t
mean
to
in
tegrate
a
function
f
:
C
 !
C
w
e
migh
t
conclude
that
there
are
t
w
o
factors
whic
h
need
to
b
e
considered.
The
rst
is
that
in
tegration
ough
t
to
still
b
e
a
one-sided
in
v
erse
to
dier-
en
tiation;
dieren
tiating
an
indenite
in
tegral
of
a
complex
function
should
yield
the
function
bac
k
again.
The
second
is
that
in
tegration
ough
t
still
to
b
e
something
to
do
with
adding
up
n
um
b
ers
asso
ciated
with
little
b
o
xes
and
taking
limits
as
the
b
o
xes
get
smaller.
W
e
ha
v
e
just
b
een
discussing
writing
out
a
v
ector
eld
as
the
conjugate
of
a
complex
function,
so
there
is
a
go
o
d
prosp
ect
that
w
e
can
in
tegrate
complex
functions
o
v
er
curv
es,
b
y
thinking
of
them
as
v
ector
elds.
In
second
y
ear
y
ou
managed
to
mak
e
sense
of
in
tegrating
v
ector
elds
o
v
er
curv
es
and
surfaces,
and
should
no
w
feel
c
heerful
ab
out
doing
this
in
the
plane.
So
y
our
exp
erience
of
in
tegration
already
extends
to
t
w
o
and
three
dimensions,
and
y
ou
recall,
I
hop
e,
the
planar
form
of
the
F
undamen
tal
Theorem
of

kno
wn
as
Green's
Theorem.
If
y
ou
don't,
lo
ok
it
up
in
y
our
notes,
y
ou're
going
to
need
it.
On
the
other
hand,
w
e
could
just
tak
e
the
real
and
imaginary
parts
separately
,

and

tegrate
eac
h
of
these
in
the
usual
w
a
y
as
a

of

w
o
v
ariables.
This
w
ould
giv
e
us
some
sort
of
complex
n
um
b
er
asso
ciated
with
a
function
and
a
region
in
C
.
If
w
e
w
ere

try
to
`in

the

to

w
e
w

get
x

y
+
iy

x,
whic
h
is
not
complex
dieren
tiable
except
at
the

If
the
FTC
is
to
hold,
dieren
tiating
an
indenite
in
tegral
ough
t
to
get
us
bac
k
to
the
thing
in

and
here
it
do
es
no
suc
h
thing.
So
w
e
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
particularly
useful
w
a
y
to
dene
a
complex
in
tegral.
No
w
the
deriv
ativ
e
of
a
complex
function
is
a
complex
function,
so
the
in
tegral
of
a
complex
function
should
also
b
e
a
complex
function.
So
in
tegrating
functions
from
C
to
C
to
get
other
functions
from
C
to
C
m
ust
b
e
more
lik
e
in
tegrating
functions
from
R
to
R
than
in
tegrating
or
v
ector
elds.
This
leads
to
the
issue:
what
do
w
e
in
tegrate
o
v
er?
If
w
e
in
tegrate
o
v
er
regions
in
C
,
then
an
y
v
ersion
of
the
F
undamen
tal
Theorem
of
Calculus
has
to
b
e
some
v
arian
t
of
Green's
Theorem,
and
m
ust
b
e
concerned
with
relating
the
in
tegral
o
v
er
the
region
of
one
function
with
the
in
tegral
o
v
er
the
b
oundary
of
another.
So
w
e
seem
to
need
to
in
tegrate
complex
functions
o
v
er
curv
es
if
w
e
need
to
in
tegrate
them
o
v
er
regions.
And
w
e
kno
w
ho
w
to
in
tegrate
along
curv
es,
b
ecause
a
complex
function
f
(z
)
is
a
v
ector
eld
in
an
ob
vious
w
a
y
.
Another
argumen
t
for
thinking
that
curv
es
are
the
things
to
in
tegrate
com-
plex
functions
o
v
er
is
that
if
w
e
ha
v
e
an
expression
lik
e
Z
f
(z

then
the
dz
ough
t
surely
to

,
v
ery

w.
And
not
as
a
v
ery
,
v
ery
small

In
tuitiv
e
argumen
ts
of
this
sort
can
merely
b
e
suggestiv
e,
since
they
are
deriv
ed
from
our
exp
erience
on
a
dieren
t
w
orld,
the
w
orld
of

There
is
a
sc

whic
h
w
ould

h
argumen
ts
on
the
grounds
that
they

it

more

to
go
somewher
e
on

strength
of
a

than
to
go
no

b
ecause
it

safer.
An

it

W

therefore
in

men
tioned

the
imp
ortance
of
innite
series,
particularly
p
o
w
er

in
estimating
v
alues
of
functions.
What
it
comes
do
wn
to
is
that
w
e
can
easily
add,
subtract,
m
ultiply
and
except
in
the
case
of
zero,
divide
real
n
um
b
ers,
and
this
is
essen
tially
all
w
e
can
do
with
them.
The
same
applies
to
complex
n
um
b
ers.
The
only
op
eration
that
mak
es
sense
otherwise
is
taking
limits,
and
again
this
mak
es
sense
for
com-
plex

b
ers
also.
It
follo
ws
that
if

e
w
an

or
some

function

alue,
it
must
b
e
p
ossible
to
compute
the

to
increasing

curacy
,
in

of
some
nite
n
um
b
er
of
rep
eated
additions,
m
ultiplications,
subtractions
and
divisions,
or
there
isn't
an
y
meaning
to
the
expression.
W
e
can
accept
that
w

ma
y
nev
er
get
an
exact
answ
er
in
a

but
if
w

can't
get
an

and
know
the
size
of
the
unc
ertainty
with

if

b

more
simple
arithmetic,
then
sin()
simply
do
esn't

e
an

The

holds
for
all
the
other
functions.

And
the

in

The
idea

Theorem
.
(Dieren

of

The
L
aur
ent

for
a

analytic
in
an
annulus
if
dier
entiate
d
termwise
gives
the
derivative
of
the
function.
No
Pr

of:

Since
the
case
where
all
the
negativ
e
co
ecien
ts
are
zero
reduces
to
the
case
of
the
T
a
ylor
series,
this
is
also
true
for
T
a
ylor
Series.
It
is
not
generally
true
that
if
a
function
is
giv
en
b
y
a
sequence
of
appro
ximating
functions,
the
deriv
ativ
e
is
giv
en
b
y
the
sequence
of
deriv
ativ
es.
After
all,

n
sin
nx
gets
closer
and
closer
to
the
zero
function
as
n
increases.
But
the
deriv
ativ
es
cos
nx
certainly
do
not
get
closer
to
an
ything.
This
tells
us
y

again
that

that

There

is

fa

and
all

whic
h
is
to

y
ou
what
the
rules
are
and
to
insist
that
y
ou
follo
w
them.
The
other
is
fa
v
oured
b
y
engineers,
mathematicians
and
all
those
with
a
bit
of
go
in
them,
and
it
is
to
mak
e
up
a
new
kind

whic
h
b
eha
v
es
the
w
a
y
y
our

think
is
reasonable

.
W
e
therefore
dene
a
new
improp
er
in
tegral
for
the
case
where
the
function
is
b
ounded
and
the

is
the

f

f

This
means
that
C
R
R
x
=
0,
although
R
R

do
es
not

The
C
stands
for
Cauc

y
,
but
I
shan't
call
this
the
Cauc
h
y
In
tegral
b
ecause
that
term
could
cause
confusion.
It
is
often
called
the
Cauchy
Princip
al
V
alue,
but
this
leads
one
to
think
it
is
something
p
ossessed
b
y
an
in
tegral
whic
h
do
es
not

Note
that
if
the

tegral
do
es
exist,
then
so
do
es
the
C
R
and
they
ha
v
e
the
same

The
con
v
erse
is
ob
viously
false.
In
what
follo
ws,
I
shall
just
use
the
in
tegral
sign,
without
stic
king
a
C
in
fron
t
of
it,
to
denote
this
Cauc

W
e
are
using
the
new,
symmetrised
in
tegral
instead
of
the
Riemann
in
tegral:
they
are
the
same
when
the
Riemann
in

is
dened,
but
the
new
symmetrised
in
tegral
exists
for

where
there

The

The

as

the

the

So
for

The

are

Recall
that
f
is
mer
omorphic
if
it
has
only
isolated
p
oles
of
nite
order
and
is
otherwise
analytic.
It
follo
ws
from
classical
real
analysis
that
in
an
y
b
ounded
region
of
C
,
a
meromorphic
function
has
only
a
nite
n
um
b
er
of
p
oles.
The
idea
is
that
an
y
innite
set
of
p

inside
a
b
ounded
region
w
ould
ha
v
e
to

w
ould
also
ha
v
e
to
b
e
a
p
ole,
and
it
w
ouldn't
b
e
isolated.
If
f
is
not
the
zero
function,
then
f
can
ha
v
e
only
isolated
zeros,
since
w
e
can
tak
e
a

a
ylor
expansion
ab
out
an
y

w
,
and
get
an
expression
(z

n

,
where
n
is
the
order
of
the
zero
and
T
is
a

er
series
with
non-zero
leading
term
and
hence
f
is
non
zero
in
some
punctured
disk
cen
tred
on

.
Then
standard
compactness
argumen
ts
giv
e
the
required
result.
It
follo
ws
that
except
for
the
case
where
f
is
the

function,
=f
is
also
meromorphic
when
f

It

The
Hough
T

tak
es
a
p

t

uses
it
to
get
a

c,
b

c
and
dra
ws
the
resulting
curv

actually
a
straigh

in
the
line
(m

space.
It
then
rep
eats
for
ev
ery
other
p

of
the

where
the
curv
es
all
in
tersect
y
ou
ha
v
e
the
m;
c
b

to

The

parametrisation
fails
to

and
there
are
t
w
o
w
a
ys
to
go:
one
is
to
do

wice,
once
with
m;
c
and
once
with
=m;
 c=m,
as
when
x
=

c.
This
tak
es
t
wice
as
long
to
compute,
and
it
is
a
rather
slo
w

an
yw
a
y
.
The
other
w
a

to
go
is

Y

This
handles
the
v
ertical
lines
p
erfectly
w
ell,
but
runs
in
to
trouble
when
the
line
passes
through
the
origin.
So
engineers
and

for
