Switch Users and Sudo Access: 
 
Switch Users: 
 
Following is the user switch command that can be used to switch from one user to another 
 
 
su  - username 
su - invokes a login shell after switching the user. A login shell resets most environment variables, 
providing a clean base. 
 
 
su username 
just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user 
 
Sudo Access: 
 
sudo command-name 
The above command “sudo command-name” will run any command owned and authorized by root account 
as long as that user is authorized to run it in /etc/sudoers file 
 
 
Configuring sudo Access 
1. Log in to the system as the root user.  
2. Create a normal user account using the useradd command. Replace USERNAME with 
the user name that you wish to create.  
# useradd USERNAME 
3. Set a password for the new user using the passwd command.  
4. # passwd USERNAME 
5. Changing password for user USERNAME. 
6. New password:  
7. Retype new password:  
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. 
8. Run the visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file. This file defines the policies applied by 
the sudo command.  
# visudo 
9. Find the lines in the file that grant sudo access to users in the group wheel when enabled.  
10. ## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands 
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL 
11. Remove the comment character (#) at the start of the second line. This enables the 
configuration option.  
12. Save your changes and exit the editor.  
13. Add the user you created to the wheel group using the usermod command.  

# usermod -aG wheel USERNAME 
14. Test that the updated configuration allows the user you created to run commands using 
sudo.  
1. Use the su to switch to the new user account that you created.  
# su USERNAME - 
2. Use the groups to verify that the user is in the wheel group.  
3. $ groups 
USERNAME wheel 
4. Use the sudo command to run the whoami command. As this is the first time you 
have run a command using sudo from this user account the banner message will 
be displayed. You will be also be prompted to enter the password for the user 
account.  
5. $ sudo whoami 
6. We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local 
System 
7. Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things: 
8.  
9.     #1) Respect the privacy of others. 
10. 
    #2) Think before you type. 
11. 
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility. 
12. 
 
13. 
[sudo] password for USERNAME: 
root 
The last line of the output is the user name returned by the whoami command. If 
sudo is configured correctly this value will be root.  
You have successfully configured a user with sudo access. You can now log in to this user 
account and use sudo to run commands as if you were logged in to the account of the root user.
