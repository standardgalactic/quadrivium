Chapter1
FROM
THE
GROUND,
the
bird
was an inﬁnitesimal white speck lost
against the isoluminescent glare of the
midday sky.
From the perspective of
the seagull, however, the ground and
its features were clearly apparent in
all their multiplicity and confusion. Be-
low it now as it circled in its leisurely
bank was the sparkling band of the
Tongue Water, to its right the smoky
bulk of the manufacturing district and

beyond that the widening mainland, to
its left the great city of Peridol.
There was more than just scenery
transpiring
down
there
under
the
bird’s dangling feet, though. The seag-
ull’s unhurried path was carrying it
around a wide coil of dark smoke that
mounted even higher, curling and roil-
ing, until an onshore breeze took it
and shredded it into streamers and
ragged sheets. Following the pillar of
smoke downward took the eye into the
midsection of a tall bridge. The bridge
currently spanned the water less effec-
tively than it likely had even a short
time before.
The center reach of the
roadbed was obscured by steam clouds
that were replacing the dark smoke
with a pufﬁer white. Here and there,
where the steam parted, a few dying
ﬂames could be noted, and in more
numerous other locations the surface

of the water itself was visible through
the bridge ﬂoor, rimmed by jagged
holes and the raw edges of ruptured
steel.
Wedged up against and partially un-
derneath the bridge on its upstream
surface, glinting and glittering, was
a prodigious cliff of ice.
Even to the
seagull’s inexpert eye, it was clear that
the steam clouds had resulted from
the contact, in the not-too-distant past,
of the shorn-off crown of the iceberg
with the incendiary ﬁres.
Since the
center section of the bridge was ex-
hibiting - in addition to the roadbed
damage - a prominent sag and list, of
dire structural import, it was also ap-
parent that the supporting inﬂuence
of the iceberg’s bulk was keeping the
larger part of the bridge from collaps-
ing full-on into the water.
A slender
crag of ice that had not been clipped on

contact with the bridge still towered
over the upstream mass of the iceberg
and loomed at a perilous angle over the
bridge itself. Curiously, the uppermost
section of this ice needle seemed to
bear within it the crushed remains of
what might have been a modest ﬁshing
boat.
Spectacular
though
these
sights
were, the seagull’s interest was not
primarily architectural. Crowds of peo-
ple were apparent on every side; on the
bridge itself, on the river-bank grand-
stands, even a few remaining bobbers
in the water or on small boats being fer-
ried to the shore. Flocks of other birds
wheeled about as well, those of sea
and land keeping largely separate but
all diving periodically to snare some
useful morsel from the water or the
crush on land. With a glance back over
its shoulder the seagull veriﬁed it was

being trailed at a respectful distance
by a congregation of other gulls, pant-
ing and bedraggled from some recent
exertion though they appeared.
A few large sea-creatures were still
visible too, as looming shadows be-
neath the surface or as splashing
wakes of foam. Confused by the abrupt
end to the Running of the Squids but
still attracted by the lures, a school of
leaping marlin were trying to thread
the tight gauntlet beneath the bridge
and break through to the open ocean
downstream.
A lingering leviathan,
wisely deciding against pitting itself
against the bridge, was beating its way
back upstream against the current.
The gull stood on a wingtip and spi-
raled down toward the bridge and the
Peridol shore. From the swirls of sol-
diers, rescuers, gawkers, and hangers-
on an occasional character stood out.

Heading off the bridge into the city
was a man who stood a full head taller
than even the heftiest of the crowd
around him. The man stood out even
further by virtue of the breadth given
him by the people in his immediate
vicinity, even at the expense of hurling
themselves bodily away to either side
or of ﬂinging themselves to the ground.
The bird had descended low enough
to catch the dull glint from the man’s
nicked battle sword, but the glower on
his face would clearly have been sufﬁ-
cient by itself to open the path in front
of him.
The man also had a bundle
slung lightly over one shoulder, some-
thing that was either a six-foot length
of crisped meat fresh from the spit
of a street rotisserie, or, improbable
though it might have been, an actual
still-or-barely living person.
The
gull
cawed
twice
and
then

ﬂapped vigorously,
gaining altitude
again as it launched itself over the city.
Beyond the fashionable estates mount-
ing the slopes of the Crust, on its way
toward the palace complex, the bird
spied a churning mob surging along a
boulevard, howling and hurling offal
and the traditional rotten produce at
something up ahead. As the vantage
point changed, this something resolved
itself ﬁrst into a sizable contingent of
soldiers, and then in their midst a
stout ox-cart. Lashed down to the bed
of the cart and apparently encased in
partial stonework to boot was another
man.
He shared with the berserker
the same expression of grim determi-
nation. It was more difﬁcult to read his
face, however, since his head was all
but obscured behind its bindings and a
mask-like cage. As had happened with
the hulking berserker, several gulls

detached themselves from the trail-
ing ﬂock and began to loop deliberately
above the cart as the lead bird swooped
away.
The great city held far too many ur-
gent sights for the bird to give even
ﬂeeting attention to each one. Accord-
ingly, it passed over without a second
glance another human ﬁgure sprawled
prostrate in the refuse-heaped mud
of a narrow back alley, its eyes ﬁxed
on yet another ﬁre off across the city
up ahead.
In truth, a second glance
would scarcely have revealed more in-
formation concerning this particular
human.
The trash covered the body
so thoroughly that even its sex could
not so easily be determined, and as for
its status among the living or other-
wise, well, certainly no sign of breath
or movement disturbed the stillness of
its repose. But then if the seagull had

chosen to be comprehensive about it, it
would have most likely had no trouble
ﬁnding another dozen or two people
in similar circumstances at that very
moment somewhere in the city.
Was
the city not, after all, Peridol, foremost
in the known world in every leading
category, urban violence not least of
all?
Whether the gull indulged in this
particular depth of reﬂection was ob-
scure. Its purpose, on the other hand,
could scarcely be doubted. As it gained
altitude, the second black cloud-pillar
ahead revealed more of its base be-
hind the intervening structures and
low hills. Where the ﬁre on the bridge
had been dying under the melting ice,
this new one was clearly in the prime
of its life.
Such were the volume of
the leaping ﬂames and rolling ﬁreballs
and shooting pyrotechnic ﬂares that its

source was wholly shrouded. Anything
from a single building to a full block
or more might be in the midst of being
consumed.
Beneath the seagull now, reeling
down the center of a street, was an-
other ragged and disheveled man. He
was both singed and dripping sea wa-
ter, and like the others the bird had sin-
gled out for closer inspection his face
was set in a grim expression of bleak
determination.
As the bird watched,
the man staggered and almost fell on
his face, obviously pushing across the
limit of his endurance.
He managed
not to go down, though, and instead
continued the last vestiges of his dead
run.
Short of exhortation, there was no
purpose to be served by lurking over-
head; either the man would collapse
or he wouldn’t. If he remained on his

feet, it seemed likely to the gull that
the man would ultimately arrive at the
same destination as its own. Although
if he didn’t show up - for whatever
reason - the bird was going to be more
than a little put out. It ﬂapped vigor-
ously again and headed for the ﬁre.
Owing to the precaution of approach-
ing from upwind, it took several min-
utes to reach the scene.
Braving the
unstable updrafts, the seagull side-
slipped its way toward the column of
smoke and executed a careful dive.
One street-facing building was the cen-
terpiece, although at least some of the
adjoining structures were a clear loss
as well.
Whoosh!
- another ﬁreball
rolled out of the smoke and ascended
toward the bird. The gull slid out of the
way, feeling its tail feathers crisp, and
glided toward more stable air.
Had
it heard any cries from the fully en-

gulfed facility below?
- detected any
signs of life? No, it decided, it had not.
As the bird dropped to a perch on a
gable across the street, the remainder
of the roof fell in, sending forth a fresh
shower of embers and ﬂaming sparks.
The front wall leaned over toward the
ﬁre and then blew into vapor, ﬂoor by
ﬂoor, from the uppermost peak straight
down to the foundation.
A civic ﬁreﬁghting team had their
gear spread out on the street in front
of the building.
Their sorcerer was
making futile passes in the air, watch-
ing rain clouds begin to condense and
then get immediately shredded to bits
by the churning hot vapors.
His as-
sociates were wielding a hose leading
back to their water wagon.
The de-
clining trickle from the nozzle, though,
spoke to the imminent depletion of
their supply.

The gull ﬂuffed its feathers and set-
tled down to wait. There was undoubt-
edly more to come.
The Great Karlini lurched through
the streets, hoping it had been just
a delusion, just a fever of his over-
wrought brain, just a sign his mental
house of cards had taken an incon-
venient moment to spring into ruin.
But if there was a sign, it was clearly
not found merely inside his own head.
The evidence was apparent off ahead,
in the column of coiling black smoke
winding and twisting its way above the
rooftops.
And he’d thought he had left pande-
monium behind him at the Tongue Wa-
ter. Or no, he had scarcely thought that
at all. At the instant that horrible, de-
spairing cry had split his head he had
known that no matter the level of dis-
cord at the Running of the Squids, the

true afﬂiction - or at least the afﬂiction
closest to his own interests - would be
found far across town.
The cry still hung in his ears. Lev-
itation, Karlini thought, why didn’t
anyone ever come up with workable
levitation? But he was putting all his
remaining energy into running. Even
if there was levitation he’d have no
reserve to spare to invoke it, or any
other spell-work for that matter - not
that he could think of any spell activ-
ity that would be particularly helpful
just at the moment. Resurrection was
another concept endlessly discussed,
endlessly debated upon, that regard-
less still eluded even the gods, as far
as anyone knew. Whether it existed or
not, though, it was what he’d need.
Bad planning, bad planning and ir-
responsibility, and he had no one but
himself to blame. He’d have no one else

to blame for the rest of his life. If he
hadn’t been so drained and exhausted
from that out-of-control effort against
the ice sorcerer - what was his name,
Dortonn - and then his unexpected
bath in the Tongue Water, perhaps
he’d have still been able to think of
something, to be there when Roni had
needed him –
That shriek, that dying shriek -
Or was it the sign of death? Might
there be hope? Things even less prob-
able had somehow managed to squeak
themselves to an acceptable resolution,
before. But this time? This time?
Then somehow he had arrived. The
whole block seemed to be on ﬁre. His
arms reaching forward, feeling the air,
Karlini plunged toward the ﬂames;
then, as his waterlogged clothes began
to steam and his face began to sear
he came limply to a halt. Maybe she

hadn’t been there. Maybe it was just
Dortonn’s ﬁnal diversion.
In his reverie, he had actually begun
to consider hurling himself to immola-
tion in the ﬂames when he suddenly
felt himself beaten roughly about the
head, and then seized with a sharp
pinch on the shoulder.
“Oh, it’s you again, is it,” said Kar-
lini,
not even bothering to glance
around at the seagull; he knew the
bird far too well by this time, having
been haunted by it since this whole
thing had started, somewhere off in
some desert.
“Thanks for saving my
life, I suppose, not that I’ve done any-
thing with it but screw up when people
needed me.”
People? Karlini thought. Well, yes,
but not just people. They might have
been estranged (another matter that
had clearly been his fault) but she was

still his wife, and the person he’d in-
tended to spend the rest of his life with.
Was his wife? Had been his wife.
Had been his life.
So Karlini continued to stare, sweat
and other ﬂuids running down his face,
his skin blistering from the heat, his
breath coming harsh and twisted, try-
ing still to get his mind back in gear,
as ﬂaming timbers crashed and smoke
billowed and prospects turned to ash;
he failed to notice when the seagull
screeched and ﬂapped off to another
part of the crowd, or when it returned,
bringing others with it.
What does a guy have to do?
Jur-
tan Mont had been wondering as he
and Tildy watched the ﬁre brigade
try to contain the disaster and keep
the entire block from going up, and
hope to stop the ﬂaming embers from
jumping streets and buildings and

leapfrogging across the district.
He
had been through quite a lot in the last
day himself, culminating with his last-
possible-moment nick-of-time arrival
to pull his sister out of the building to
safety on the street. But did his sister
bother to thank him? Did she bother to
notice him? No, all she’d done was keep
edging away from him and staring at
the ﬁre. Of course, he was still covered
with ﬁlth and reeked from his lengthy
encounter with a hill of night soil, but
he had unmistakably saved her life.
What did she want from him?
She wouldn’t answer his questions,
either.
Answer?
Jurtan doubted she
was even listening to him. Her infor-
mation might be important, too. Take
the guy she’d been with.
Who was
he, anyway? Why did Jurtan’s music
sense keep hitting him with warning
slidehorn wails whenever the man was

around? And then what had happened
to the fellow in the Karlini lab? Had
he set the ﬁre? Was he dead, or if not
where was he now?
How could Jurtan protect his sister
if she didn’t even have the good sense
to realize she needed it?
Then all of a sudden she had opened
up. But had it been to tell him what he
needed to know? Hah! “So what hap-
pened to you since yesterday?” she’d
said.
“I was chased. I escaped. I got lost.
I don’t want to talk about it,” he’d con-
cluded.
Okay, so it hadn’t been the smartest
thing to say, even if she did have
him miffed already.
He should have
taken the opening to start engaging
her in conversation, and then steered
things to the topics in which he was
interested. Instead, she’d immediately

tuned him out again. And then, while
he’d been trying to think of a new
wedge to crack open her shell, they’d
been dived on by this crazy seagull;
dived on and virtually shoved down
the street back toward the raging ﬁre.
Ahead of Jurtan, his sister faltered.
“It’s Karlini,” she said uncertainly.
Who do you think it would be, with
that seagull involved? Jurtan thought,
but he was proud of himself that he
hadn’t actually said it out loud. “Well,
maybe he knows what’s going on.”
“He wasn’t here,” said Tildy.
Before Jurtan could say anything
else, the seagull slammed into him
again with its webbed feet extended,
knocking him forward and into his
sister.
The music in his head, which
had been playing a pretty demoraliz-
ing dirge, broke ranks with a mocking
accordion wheeze. Jurtan seized Tildy

around the wrist and yanked her for-
ward. “Come on,” he said, “before that
bird decides to do us in.” She dragged
along behind him in a dazed shamble.
A moment later, Jurtan saw that the
one in the real daze was the Great Kar-
lini. He looked as though he’d just lost
his last friend. His last - so that was
it! His sister had neglected to mention
anything about Ronibet Karlini in her
recent experiences.
Becoming aware of their presence
with him now, Karlini took in the
Monts’ own charred and ash-covered
appearances.
Tildamire’s arms and
face were fried a bright shiny red and
her sleeves were barely more than
clinging soot. “You were here?” Karlini
stated. “What about Roni?”
“Inside,” said Tildy, “I think.”
“What happened?”
With her eyes too wide and her voice

too shrill, and her words, when they
came at all,
trickling out in short
meandering bursts, it was plain that
Tildamire was barely still in this world
herself. “He was different. It was al-
most like he wasn’t the same person
at all. But he threw a ﬁreball at Roni,
and it - she -”
“Who?” said Karlini. “Who threw a
ﬁreball?”
“The guy with no name. The Creep-
ing Sword.”
The air went out of Karlini and he
slumped even further. “Him? Are you
sure? What do you mean he wasn’t like
the same person?”
“There was - I mean, it looked like
light was coming out of his eyes. He
looked crazy, out of his mind, he was
tearing up everything, and then he
threw this ﬁreball and everything went
white, I couldn’t see, and -”

“Excuse me,” said a loud voice. Kar-
lini swung around and saw a hefty man
in heavy padded oilskins and a stout
hard cap with a wide bill brim; an axe
swung at his side in a belt sheath. The
man had sweat running off his burly
mustache. “Fire Chief Cinder. Are you
connected with this building?”
“Damn it, yes,” Karlini said.
“Then what’s inside? Why is it burn-
ing so hot? You been storing anything
toxic we need to worry about?”
Toxic?
Oh, crap.
Karlini gazed
down the block, where the roof of an-
other structure was beginning to show
ﬂames.
“Unfortunately,
I’m afraid
there is.”
“Figured as much,” Fire Chief Cin-
der said with resignation.
“That’s
Wraith District for you.
Something
took out our magic user soon as he
set up.” Cinder gestured with a gloved

hand.
Across the street next to the
water wagon was another man in a
ﬁreﬁghter outﬁt, lying on his back on
the ground staring sightlessly at the
sky, his lips moving feebly.
Karlini sighed. “I’d better see what
I can do,” he said.
Did anyone listen
when I tried to tell them this was a bad
idea? Of course not. He closed his eyes,
raised an exhausted hand, and forced
his ﬁngers into the release template for
a preliminary probe.
Better key it to
the containment ﬁeld on the vats, Kar-
lini thought, start off by making sure
those magical organisms of Roni’s are
still in their cages.
The containment
spells should have been good against
more than a little ﬁre... but where were
they? What had that crazy Creeping
Sword guy been doing here, anyway?
What -
Karlini’s hand jerked. His personal

protection
ﬁeld
clicked
on,
sucked
at his energy reserve as he tried to
cast loose the probe-tether before this
pumped feedback loop got out of con-
trol -
- but he’d already depleted his re-
serve dealing with Dortonn, and he’d
been drained even more than that get-
ting in and out of the Tongue Water
and then launching on his desperate
run across the city, and on top of that
there was the added adrenal draw-
down from the emotional shock –
Karlini knew when he began to keel
over but had no idea if he hit the
ground.

Chapter2
WHEN
KARLINI
FOUND
OUT
WHAT HAD HAPPENED he was
going to want my head. Of course, that
would be his ﬁrst reaction; after he’d
had a chance to think about it he’d
come up with something really nasty.
At the moment, my take on the subject
was that if he wanted my head he was
welcome to it. It sure hadn’t done me
or anyone around me much but lasting
harm.

Well, like the saying goes, I hadn’t
been careful what I’d wished for, so
sure enough that’s what I’d gotten.
Now I might have known who I was,
but I hadn’t really solved anything. As
it had turned out there probably hadn’t
been anything I could have done about
it either. At least I hoped that was the
case. It was one thing if I’d just been
trapped in my body, being dragged
along for the ride.
But if there had really been some-
thing I could have done to prevent it...
“So,” said Gashanatantra.
I opened my eyes and glared at him
across from me in the closed carriage.
“‘So’? That’s all you can say, ‘so’? ‘So,’
what?”
“Getting testy, are you?”
“Oh, testy, is it? You don’t like testy?
You think I should just accept it all
and move along, none the worse for

wear? You ﬁnd out your true identity
is a homicidal maniac and then tell me
about testy.”
“So,” Gash repeated, “now that you
have exposed your spleen, what do you
propose to do about this situation - Isk-
endarian?”
“Don’t call me that.”
“Isn’t it your name?”
“Damned if I know,” I told him.
Damned if I know.
We’d obviously
been occupying the same body, and
the same brain too, him and me, but
that was just the trouble.
Him and
me. I might have been able to dip into
the underlying goo beneath both of us
and return with some learned skill or
the occasional odd fact - and indeed I
had - but that was as close I’d come
to feeling like he was anything more
than the guy in the other room down
the hall. I’d naively ﬁgured that when

I ﬁnally broke through to reveal my
hidden identity, wiped from sight by
the Spell of Namelessness, it would
seem familiar. Sure, I thought maybe
major areas would still turn out to be
gone forever, not merely hidden from
sight but scraped clean. What I hadn’t
anticipated was that “I” still wouldn’t
recall the slightest scrap of memory
that would make me remember being
whoever-I’d-been. “We” were still utter
strangers.
Not strangers like long-lost brothers,
either. We didn’t seem anything alike,
which was ﬁne with me, but didn’t go
any distance toward resolving the ques-
tion of whether I was responsible for
his actions.
On the other hand, another thing
that I’d feared hadn’t happened either.
I hadn’t been merged into him. I hadn’t
ceased to exist as an autonomous be-

ing; my personality hadn’t seemed to
change, my sense of self was intact
- and neither seemed anything at all
like his.
A lot of this could be explained if
he’d told the truth when he’d said he’d
created me. That didn’t make me feel
any better, especially considering the
fact that as soon as he’d ﬁnished say-
ing that he’d done his best to toss me
back into whatever primordial soup he
claimed to have ladled me out of.
Still, it all just didn’t make sense,
not that I was about to tell that to
Gash, of all people.
I mean, sneaky
plots and long-range plans may be a
way of life, but what I’d heard from
Iskendarian didn’t add up.
Even if
my worser half had decided to conceal
himself from his enemies by going un-
derground behind a false front, or he’d
hatched some plot whose resolution

had been a century out but for whose
resolution he still intended to be on
hand, there had to be better ways of
running it than this harebrained con-
trivance.
Of course, given the facts as I knew
them, that same harebrain was also
me.
Gash was regarding me thoughtfully.
He was still covered with ﬁlth and soot
from what he’d referred to in passing
as “that mess at the bridge,” but then I
hadn’t exactly cleaned up either. Actu-
ally, I was in lousier shape than he was,
not only in appearance but in damage,
of which I’d suffered quite a bit while
he showed no evidence of any problem
deeper than approximately the level of
his skin. Other than the problem of the
habitual paths of his mind, which goes
without saying. He’d had his strange
little assistant in the ﬂying brass ball

ﬂag down this carriage for us where
we’d staggered the few blocks away
the burning Karlini place, but then
the assistant had swooped off himself,
leaving the two of us here together this
short while later and none the better
for the experience.
“I seem to recall you were trying
to uncover your identity,” Gash said
ﬁnally. “Are you happy now?”
“Not particularly, no, thank you.”
“Not even when the identity you re-
vealed is a name out of legend, a major
player on the world stage?”
“Especially not.”
“I see,” he said. “But you must have
realized from the outset that innocent
bystanders are rarely subjected to the
Spell of Namelessness. Did you think
you were some purged paladin, some
force for good cast down for your threat
to the powers that be?”

“I don’t know. I’m new around here.
You tell me.”
“Certainly, the number who might be
described by such a noble deﬁnition is
vanishingly few,” he said with an air
of contemplation, “whether among the
ranks of the mighty or those insigniﬁ-
cant others you appear to prefer to seek
yourself among.”
I slumped down further in the seat.
“Good guys or not, I didn’t expect I’d be
a major scourge on the world.”
“Yes. We should clearly discuss that
aspect of the situation. What do you
think he might be doing at the mo-
ment?”
“He’s suppressed, asleep, under con-
trol.”
“Are you certain? The jolt adminis-
tered by Monoch was scarcely enough
to banish him, I’m sure you must
know.”

I thought about it.
Would I know
if he was awake and listening in? At
this point I ﬁgured I would. The rela-
tionship between him and me - leaving
aside for the moment the metaphysics
behind those two referents when both
of us were occupying the same body
and the same brain - was not totally
symmetrical. In the most recent stage
I’d been able to watch him when he’d
been active without causing him to
black out or to know I was there; he’d
thought I’d been eradicated. But could
he be doing the same thing now to
me?
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure,” I lied.
Only even if he was merely suppressed,
what did I do now? What if he woke up
again and tried to come back?
When he woke up again.
“Wait a minute,” I said.
“Why are
you asking about him? Do you want to
know from a concern from public safety

or because you want to recruit him for
some scheme of yours? How much did
you have to do with bringing him out of
hiding in the ﬁrst place?”
He regarded me, and either I knew
him well enough by now, or my in-
sight was being supplemented from
the time we’d shared the metabolic
link that had let me pass myself off in
his identity, or I’d played enough bid-
and-bluff card games over the years,
but I could virtually see the intricate
orreries of his mind whirling in their
epicycles, and then ﬁnally align them-
selves in decision.
“l had my suspi-
cions,” Gash said, “when we met, in
Roosing Oolvaya, that there was more
to you than was apparent on the sur-
face.
As far as l was concerned at
the time, our initial meeting was hap-
penstance.
Subsequently one must
question, as one must always ques-

tion these things, but if a plan existed
to bring us together its subtlety lies
beneath the level of indifferentiable
noise.
“As you know,” he went on, “there
are always people who go about in dis-
guise.
Most often the masquerade is
deliberate, occasionally not. In either
case, being aware that some subterfuge
is in progress is a very clear survival
skill.” Gash leaned back and re-crossed
his legs.
“I fear that much you have
attributed to paranoia or omnipotent
machination is in reality the merely
comprehensive application of princi-
ples of prudence. Omnipotence is all a
matter of mirrors and smoke anyway,
laid atop a mortar of superstition. Are
we not men?”
“I assume you’re speaking rhetori-
cally.”
Gash favored me with an occupation-

ally inscrutable glance. “Don’t become
caught up with labels.
What is the
practical deﬁnition of godhood if not
one of power and demonstrable capa-
bility?”
“Well, you already did away with
omnipotence, I guess, and I suppose by
extension omniscience too, but what
about creating and ruling the world,
supernatural and eternal attributes,
establishing ethical codes and -”
“There you’re mythologizing again.
Your
associate
Maximillian
would
never speak that way, I assure you.
If you examine your abilities as Isk-
endarian, or the history of your ac-
tivities, you would ﬁnd very little to
differentiate yourself from a god, I can
assure you of that as well.”
I pointed a ﬁnger at him.
“You’re
trying to appeal to my reasonability,”
I said.
“You’re trying to humanize

yourself - to demythologize yourself -
so that I’ll agree to do whatever it is
you’re leading up to. You want me to
think I’m not being intimidated into
it.
You want me to feel comfortable
I’m making a decision as one peer to
another instead of being stampeded
into something I’ve got no choice about
anyway. Why? Why are you bothering?
Because of Iskendarian’s power?”
“Would you believe me if I said I
wanted to be your friend?” Gash asked.
“Of course not. Power obviously has a
major role in everything that is hap-
pening, but raw power is scarcely the
whole story. Fortunately it rarely is. At
the -”
“Then why be a god if not for the
power?”
“There’s power and there’s power. At
the moment, as I was saying, the issue
is the power of persuasiveness; in a

word, politics. With the matter of Ab-
dication versus Conservation looking
to come to a resolution once and for all,
things are very tentatively balanced.
It may not be a great exaggeration to
say the world of affairs is poised on
the edge of chaos.
Slightly different
perturbations may send matters off on
wildly different trajectories. “
“Wait a minute.
Weren’t you the
one who just masterminded that lit-
tle eradication of Soaf Pasook down
in Oolsmouth? And what about trap-
ping what’s-his-name in the ring? Pod
Dall? Wasn’t he supposedly the mod-
erating inﬂuence in god-to-god affairs?
If you’re worried about chaos, well,
weren’t you responsible for setting up
the situation in the ﬁrst place?
And
don’t tell me there’s chaos and there’s
chaos.”
Gash closed his mouth and ﬁxed me

with an exasperated glare, implying
that he might have been preparing
to issue just such a pronouncement.
“The situation is much different now
than it was a few weeks ago in Roos-
ing Oolvaya, or even in Oolsmouth.
Who knew that so many gods would
ﬂy at each other’s throats? Who would
have expected that so many indepen-
dent plots would reach their inﬂection
points at so close to the same time?
And your friends, Karlini and Maximil-
lian - what were they working on in
that laboratory we just left?”
“I’m not exactly sure,” I said. “The
second quantum level, I think, and
something having to do with micro-
scopic animalcules.”
He gestured with a waving hand.
“You see? If they had been successful,
Maximillian would have either used
this to jack up his own power and chal-

lenge us directly, or would have set it
loose into the public domain, which
would have been worse.
With gen-
eralized second quantum level direct
access anyone could have wielded the
power of gods. It’s possible civilization
or even life on the planet might not
have survived that exercise.”
Why did I even feel like I might
know what he was talking about? “But
you think things are still that unstable
even though the Karlini lab burned
itself to ash?”
“Yes and no,” Gash said. “The build-
ing didn’t burn itself to ash, now did
it?”
I didn’t like where this was lead-
ing.
My alter ego was the one who’d
destroyed the lab, and I was sure he
hadn’t done it with an eye toward help-
ing the world.
Whatever they’d been
working on in that laboratory was not

unfamiliar to Iskendarian; the Karlini
gang even had his notes on hand with
them. Iskendarian had wanted his pa-
pers back and at least he hadn’t gotten
them - as far as I knew they’d gone to
embers along with everything else in
the place. But how much could he do
on his unaugmented own?
The cautionary comment Gash had
applied to Max could stick to Iskendar-
ian as well.
“You never got around to telling me
what you want Iskendarian for,” I said,
“and what you had to do with waking
him up.”
He launched himself promptly into
it, apparently happy with the direction
I wanted to go. “As I said, I had my
suspicions that there was more to you
than merely the detective.
After our
earliest encounters, I began to think.
Who could you be, I wondered.
I ex-

amined the list of likely candidates.
I established the metabolic link be-
tween us, quite gingerly, you may be
sure, and even so you managed to get
past the cutouts and deliver me some
nasty jolts.
But the data that came
back up the link were not consistent
with a straightforward god-proﬁle. So I
passed along Monoch. Monoch is a very
old construct, you know. In addition to
being a soul-eater, he has experience
in handling -”
“Monoch eats souls?”
“Of course.
I thought you knew.
Can’t you sense it?”
“Monoch hasn’t been out of the cane
too much lately. Did you tell him to eat
my soul?”
Gash gave me a thin but wary smile.
“Shall we say you would clearly be re-
sistant to even a nip, much less a bite?
Monoch did, however, ﬁnally decide

you were someone he had once met.
How much do you really know about
Iskendarian?”
“Why don’t you tell me what you
think I ought to know.”
“Very well.
Iskendarian was never
a god.
He could have been, he just
thought it was a waste of his time.
He was contemptuous of everyone and
everything.
He was extremely clever,
though. He was so blatant about his
ingenuity that it seemed his prime
motivation was to show just how in-
dispensable he was, and how menial
everyone else looked by comparison.
“Iskendarian did do work with the
gods, however.
You know about the
Spell of Namelessness, for example,
and since back then things were some-
what less structured than at present
- less ossiﬁed, some might say - there
was more give-and-take in general.

When he dropped from sight it was
fully in keeping with the way he’d con-
ducted himself all along - high-handed
and unexpected.
“It was thought something had ﬁ-
nally blown apart in his face and taken
him to pieces with it. Iskendarian was
given to riding the edge, after all, and
even with all prudent precautions luck
eventually runs out. Iskendarian was
given more to luck than prudence as a
matter of philosophy, too. Still, since
he was who he was, he’s been consid-
ered missing rather than gone.
Now
that so many years had passed, though,
he had moved out of consideration as a
player likely to be ever seen again.
“And then there you were.”
“You mean it suddenly dawned on
you that Iskendarian had returned?”
“No...” Gash said slowly. “What I was
trying to indicate here is that even af-

ter it was apparent that you were some-
one, it was still a signiﬁcant surprise to
learn that the someone was Iskendar-
ian. Especially when Iskendarian be-
gan asserting himself. It was unclear
what you... he... were up to.”
“‘Was’ unclear?”
He snorted.
“Very well, is unclear.
The clear thing, however, as I said be-
fore, is the highly destabilizing effect of
his reappearance just at this moment.”
“Now come on. Certainly one de-iced
guy can’t be worth all this attention.”
Gash was watching me warily. “You
really don’t know?”
“What? Has he pulled this trick be-
fore?”
“Not this one, no, but others, yes.
Iskendarian was known for wanton ex-
ercise of power. Indiscriminate exper-
imentation.
In the course of reﬁning
the Spell of Namelessness he once left

all the inhabitants of a small city with
no memory and the collective mind of
a gopher. The ends of at least a dozen
gods were linked to him. Towns were
known to vanish from the earth when
he was in the vicinity.”
Great, so this was my life. “Is this
what you meant when you said he
might as well have been a god?”
“The gods have restraint. We know
it’s bad policy to foul your own nest.”
“Are you saying Iskendarian was
known for being out of his mind? Even
by comparison with you nutty gods?”
“That is probably not too strong a
statement.”
I kneaded my temples with my hand.
How much of this could I believe? Af-
ter all, Gash was known as the master
plotter of the gods. Could he be making
all this up? From his reputation, abso-
lutely. But why would he bother? How

dangerous was Iskendarian? How dan-
gerous did that make me?
Dangerous enough that I shouldn’t
want to be alone with myself in a dark
alley, it sounded like. Hell, dangerous
enough not to be alone with myself, pe-
riod. “Sounded like” didn’t even ﬁgure
into it. I’d seen the evidence with my
own eyes.
Except Gash wasn’t telling the truth;
not the whole truth at any rate.
He
never did. So which part was he fudg-
ing on?
Maybe I could ask Monoch.
I’d better wait until I had him alone,
though, and could feel him out a bit
more. He might lie too, but perhaps I
could triangulate on whatever it was
they were trying to keep from me by
coming at from another direction.
It made sense that Gash might be
pulling his punches when illuminating
Iskendarian and his activities. If Isk-

endarian was listening in - and was
as touchy as Gash described - maybe
Gash didn’t want to rub him the wrong
way.
On the other hand, maybe that’s just
what he did want to do -
“Are you trying to decide if it’s me lis-
tening to you here,” I shot at him, “or if
it’s really Iskendarian? You think he
might be awake after all and be using
his puppet as a mask to hide behind?”
“The thought had crossed my mind,”
Gash said.
“Even though Monoch
doubts it. Yet Monoch, of course, could
have been co-opted.”
I glanced at Monoch, an innocuous
walking stick still resting between my
knees.
Right.
I had to keep remem-
bering he was really a spy, and not one
working for me, either. “And what have
you decided?”
“It appears that you and Iskendar-

ian are now, for certain practical pur-
poses, different entities. Yet I am not
convinced he is under your ﬁrm control,
nor that you will be able to accomplish
this.”
“There’s one basic answer to the
problem.
I could get killed,” I sug-
gested.
“Can you think of anything more
likely to wake Iskendarian up again
than attempting to die? He may well
be several hundred years old already -
you think he doesn’t have safeguards?
And do you think if Iskendarian could
be safely wiped from the scene we gods
would not have already brought this
to pass? In a notorious manifesto, Isk-
endarian once declared that the world
as we know it would not survive him.”
“Another reason folks were nervous
when he dropped from the scene?”
“Just so.”

“But you say they won’t be any hap-
pier knowing he’s still around.
No, I
guess not. Doesn’t sound like a good
situation, does it?”
“You begin to perceive the problem.”
“Yeah, right. Wait - how about this?
If I can’t get killed, maybe I could kill
myself.”
“An interesting twist,” Gash said.
“But if you and Iskendarian are indeed
separate intelligences, as you claim,
don’t you think he would have precau-
tions against you as well?”
“Huh.
What about an exorcism?
Maybe he could be driven out of me, so
to speak.”
“This doesn’t appear to be a case of
possession, per se. Of course, it is not
a straightforward matter of multiple
personalities, either. Some sort of ex-
orcism might be something to try. On
the other hand, this is Iskendarian.

He could have contingency planning to
deal with being driven from his body.
Would you like to be responsible for
delivering a free-ﬂoating autonomous
Iskendarian spectre to the world? You
may recall the activities of Pod Dall as
he attempted to recorporate in Roosing
Oolvaya.”
“For someone who may be out of his
mind you sure think he’s ﬁgured all the
angles.”
“Not
necessarily
all,”
said
Gash.
“Even if he intended to insinuate him-
self into the company of gods, I don’t
believe he would have planned for this
level of close scrutiny. Also, judging by
his rampage while he was in control
earlier, subterfuge may no longer have
been his goal.
Of course, his actions
do not quite make sense, either, which
either means we have not yet seen
enough to understand his plan, or,. . . ”

“Or he’s out of his mind.” Our mind.
“Just so.
So I have a proposal.
I
think perhaps you’d better stay with
me.”
“You mean you actually stay some-
where? You don’t just zip off into thin
air between one appearance and the
next?”
Gash sighed and looked at me with
exasperation.
“I mean, more broadly,
that you should remain in my company.
Moves by Iskendarian that you could
not counter on your own should evolve
differently when you and I and Monoch
are present.”
“You and I and Monoch?”
“And possibly others.
To put it
bluntly,
which should not even be
necessary,
you are a walking time
bomb.
Since I’m aware of the dan-
ger, by rights I should be ﬂeeing to the
other side of the world.”

“Then why aren’t you?”
He ﬁxed me with another stare. “If
you detonate and the situation gets out
of hand, the other side of the world may
be far too close. Would you hibernate
for ﬁfty years and then reemerge for
anything less than your major move?”
“Obviously not.” He was right. I was
a public menace, a walking time bomb,
whatever exactly that was.
Only could I trust him?
Of course
not, but that judgment was largely mit-
igated by the fact that I clearly couldn’t
trust myself either. “So,” I said, “where
are we going?”
Gash scowled, an expression I don’t
think I’d ever seen on him before.
“There is someone I believe it is time to
see.”
“An ally? I thought you didn’t need
allies, only tools, and ones to stab in
the back as soon as you were through

with them.” Come to think of it, since
I’d known Gash, every associate of his
I’d been aware of had met a nasty end.
“Misdirection is often the strongest
ally there is. And I didn’t say this per-
son was an ally, either, except poten-
tially of convenience.”
But what choice did I have?
At
the moment, none were apparent.
If
I’d said no to his proposal would he
have let me leave the coach, whatever
his warnings about Iskendarian and
his potential defenses against harm?
Somehow I didn’t think so. And could
I approach any of the Karlini gang at
this point, after exterminating a key
member they were all fond of? No, at
the moment it was time to ride and
think, and hope some additional op-
tions would present themselves some-
where down the line.
Rather than just cruising the streets,

it seemed that the coach had already
been following particular instructions
from Gash.
We had reached a rea-
sonably high-class section of Peridol,
actually one of the streets of the gods
judging by the constant parade of tem-
ples marching past at either hand. If
Gash wanted allies, it seemed like a
reasonable place to look.
Instead of
pulling up in the front somewhere,
though,
the coach stopped midway
between two medium-sized worship
houses just long enough for Gash to
hustle me out of the vehicle and down
the narrow alley that separated the
buildings. I didn’t know if he intended
to insure that I couldn’t make out the
sigils of the owning gods above the
grand entranceways, but the result
was the same; I had a quick glimpse
of a basilica front to the right and
the minarets of a mosque on the left,

and then we were scurrying down the
walk-space brushing the walls with
our shoulders on either side. Truth to
tell, I was feeling less like scurrying
than like falling into a bed and not
emerging for a week. In my recent his-
tory with Iskendarian I’d taken more
damage than I was eager to itemize.
Momentum was probably the thing; all
I needed to do was just keep myself
moving, was the thought on my mind,
when Gash abruptly stopped ahead
of me and I had to pull up sharply to
keep from bowling him over.
“Here,
I believe,” he murmured, passing his
hand lightly over the stones of the
basilica wall, then moving slowly away
from me down the alley.
For a mo-
ment I thought he was working some
magic, as his hand seemed to sink
into a stone, but then I saw that the
stone itself was sinking into the wall

under the pressure of his touch.
He
manipulated several other adjoining
stones similarly. Not surprisingly, this
was followed by a narrow section of
wall swinging silently away from us.
We squeezed into the passage and the
secret door closed behind our backs.
The passage was narrow and twisty
and apparently built within the inter-
nal walls of the building. It was also
apparent that Gash knew where he
was going, but that neither he nor any-
one else had taken this route recently,
judging from the dust and the evidence
of heavy infestation by rodents and
spiders and the other usual tenants
of such places.
Several times Gash
paused
in
consideration
at
branch
points, selecting one path over another
in what I assumed was not a succes-
sion of random hunches. He took none
of the exit doors and utilized none of

the covered peepholes, however, until
ﬁnally he held up a hand. The green
wizard-glow ball that drifted ahead of
him shrunk to a pinpoint and went
out. I could see Gash pulling aside a
wall-hanging curtain, however, in the
glow that came through the silvery
window it revealed in the wall. I had
already begun to think we might not be
expected. “After you,” whispered Gash,
ﬁngering the window and transform-
ing it into a waving sheet of gossamer
eddies. I stretched out my own hand.
Since I felt only a cool whisper as of
the memory of an oil bath, I stepped
through the mirror. Beyond the mirror
was a person, her hands raised in a
complex ward but her mouth open in
surprise. “You! -” she said. “What have
you -”
But her surprise was not yet over; in
fact, knowing her as I did, it was clear

the surprises had just begun. I had to
admire him, even if he had tried hard
to get me killed and hadn’t necessarily
given up yet on that goal. She was look-
ing over my shoulder now, at the ﬁg-
ure emerging behind me, and her eyes
were wide now and her face white, too.
“You! - you? - but I -
you -”
“Hello, Jill-tang,” said Gash, her hus-
band.

Chapter3
“THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,”
said a voice some distance away in
the darkness;
that of the Imperial
Archivist.
“That’s rather a characteristic of my
family, I’m afraid,” Zalzyn Shaa called
back.
As long as any guards weren’t
interfering, why not converse? And if
they did interfere, that could provide
its own entertainment anyway. “What
did you expect?”

“... I’m not sure, really. Torture, I
suppose, possibly rape, more grand-
standing certainly.
I didn’t expect to
be just parked in a dungeon while your
brother left to attend to other busi-
ness.”
“Well, I’m sure he intends to get to
all of that in good time. He’s bound to
be rather stretched thin at the moment,
though, wouldn’t you think? Seeing as
he’s just promoted himself to god, and
all.”
“Right,” said Leen, “so he’s a god now.
When you’ve just become a god what do
you do next?”
“Aside
from
anything
you
want?
When you’re Arznaak, probably the
greatest amount of harm to the great-
est number of people.”
Leen said nothing back to that.
It
was the sort of thought to inspire con-
templation,
not that they had any

shortage of those.
Shaa, in the mo-
mentary reverie that had sustained
him as they were being dragged down
to the subbasement to be dumped in
the dungeon, had amused himself with
the metaphorical image of the lot of
them being swept inexorably into the
maw of a huge maelstrom, the current
at the funnel’s rim being initially so
gentle as to be unrecognized, then the
insistence of the moving water and
its motive force becoming notable and
inescapable at virtually the same mo-
ment.
Now an aerial observer would
ﬁnd them spread out along the fun-
nel’s sloping wall, each individually
thrashing to keep head above water
but simultaneously subsiding toward
the common drain, when they would
presumably all meet again in a com-
mon crashing fate. At the moment, his
fate and that of the Archivist were the

most tightly intertwined, of course, but
Shaa preferred to think globally wher-
ever possible. It was a certainty that,
although presently out of sight, Max,
the Karlinis, the Monts, the Creeping
Sword, his brother Arznaak, his sister
Eden, and who knew how many oth-
ers were bound together in a common
skein.
“You don’t think he’d just let us
starve,” Leen called out suddenly. “Do
you?”
“What fun is there in that? There’s
no entertainment value in starving
someone completely, at any rate.”
“Talking to you doesn’t necessarily
make me feel any better.”
To advise a different choice of part-
ners
next
time
would
be
churlish.
“This is quite a dungeon my brother’s
built for himself,
don’t you think?”
Shaa said instead. “From the look of

the ﬂoor-plan on the way down here
he’s obviously expecting quite a few
more tenants. You’d scarcely expect it,
looking at this place from the street.”
“Looking at this place from the
street I’d have expected almost any-
thing.”
“Yes, I can see your point of view.”
Shaa rattled a chain.
“I might have
thought he’d just hurl us out on the
street too, under the assumption that
we couldn’t do anything more to stop
him, but apparently not. Perhaps he
just wants to keep us around so he can
periodically enjoy a convenient gloat.”
That was not, of course, the only pos-
sibility. But suppose, god or no, there
was something that could be done to
stop him. The ﬁrst step was traditional
but clear. They had to get out of the
dungeon.
As always, there were many conceiv-

able ways to accomplish this.
Given
the dampness in the cell from Peridol’s
high water table, the manacles would
eventually rust, which would be a start.
The time span, however, might be in-
convenient. Anyway, another potential
alternative could be much more produc-
tive, and in more ways than merely get-
ting loose from the chains. Shaa began
to focus on quieting his breathing.
“What do you think’s happened to
Max?” Leen said.
Shaa drew a deep, regular breath.
“By now,
whatever Max’s situation
happens to be, it will keep.” He was
most likely ﬁrmly embedded in some
impregnable dungeon, and if not that,
he’d be out again roaming the streets.
If the case was that of the dungeon,
getting him extracted might take some
doing but was probably not a matter
of extreme urgency. In the other case,

well, if Max wanted more help he could
damn well come and beg for it.
Actually, that could apply to the
case of the dungeon as well.
Shaa
was half-inclined to let him well and
fully rot for a change. Might do Max a
world of good. Of course, all this talk
was somewhat specious considering
his own present situation. But wasn’t
that same situation at least partly
Max’s fault? It was Max’s high-handed
plot to rid Shaa of his brother’s curse
that had led to their current low state,
as well as to Arznaak’s elevated one.
Yes, after the success he’d had with
his machinations the world might be
better off with Max on ice.
“I realize you have certain feelings
for Maximillian,” Shaa told Leen. “So
do I. In many ways he is like a brother
to me.”
“Not at all like your actual brother,

then.”
“Actually, my feelings toward both
of them are often very much the same.
They both inspire a mood of serious
aggravation more often than is healthy
for the digestion.” But then Leen might,
against all good sense, really be in love
with Max.
Shaa spoke softly.
“Don’t
worry about Max.
This place isn’t
shielded that well; if he were dead I
would know.
Even if he were being
badly tortured, I would know.” It was
probably even the truth.
Leen again fell silent. Just as well;
he needed his concentration.
Locks
were a basic exercise, but then Shaa
had been at enforced idleness for far
too long now.
Passive ﬁrst. Just sit back and let
the situation ﬂow to you. Easiest thing
in the world...
and, so.
The lock on
the manacles was nicely shielded, and

at Arznaak’s own hand, but Shaa had
not only learned his earliest lessons
from the same source as his brother,
Shaa had much more often been forced
to consider and react to a situation
of his brother’s creation.
There was
likely to be a scrap of something lying
about the cell... ah, a rat femur, just
the thing. Now coerce the piece of bone
to consider itself a key.
With some
prestidigitational manipulation -
The click from the lock sounded loud
in the subterranean stillness of the
cell, but another expected sound was
absent. Shaa shook the manacle from
his right wrist with a low clatter. In
spite of himself, he felt himself grin-
ning.
The pound of blood in his ears was
soft.
His shortness of breath was no more
than could be accounted for by the ten-

sion of the situation.
The habitual wheeze had deserted
him.
Neither ankle was a soggy morass.
And the expected pain in his chest?
What pain in his chest?
In short, the crushing rejoinder that
had afﬂicted his every attempt to em-
ploy magic since Arznaak’s original
launching of his curse had not arrived.
True, this had been the most modest
sort of magic.
But still Shaa was a
physician, and the patient whose con-
dition was most familiar happened to
be himself. If there had been a back-
lash, however slight, he would have
detected it.
Arznaak had attempted to decoy
him through misdirection.
Neverthe-
less, the possibility had been obvious.
Max had swapped the ring contain-
ing Pod Dall to Jardin, the former

Curse Administrator, in exchange for
Jardin’s lifting of the curse on Shaa.
Although Arznaak, now having over-
thrown Jardin and installed himself
as Curse Administrator in his stead,
had gone through a ritual that he
claimed would reestablish the curse,
it had been a sham.
Arznaak must
have thought his brother would be too
skittish to even test the curse again
after the unpleasantness he’d suffered
before. In every case of god-usurpation
Shaa had heard of, though, it had
taken the newly divine one some time
to fully assume the mantle of ofﬁce
and become fully functional with the
subtleties of their new powers.
Of course, the damage Shaa had
already suffered through past injudi-
cious use of conjuration was probably
permanent;
nevertheless,
one must
look forward, not behind, unless one

wants to do nothing but fall over one’s
feet. And it was a near-certainty that
Arznaak would reinstate the curse
eventually.
However, he might also -
most probably did also - have other
plans that needed prosecution ﬁrst. So
by the time Arznaak got around to
the curse again many things could be
different.
So. Shaa could use magic again with-
out fearing the backlash. This meant
he could most likely escape, and with-
out excessive histrionics. Would it be
best to leave in a subtle and mysterious
manner that might only be discovered
after some extended period of time, or
through the satisfaction of pyrotech-
nics? The decision was not trivial. He
considered the options.
Beyond the skittering of the rats in
the hall and the drip of water, there
was heard unexpectedly a soft click of

metal.
From, perhaps, the next cell?
The click was followed by a creak, as
of a reluctant door carefully eased,
and then a shadow that moved across
the grill in Shaa’s own cell. Subtlety
had it, then, although perhaps the op-
portunity for pyrotechnics would still
present itself. Shaa ﬁnished divesting
himself of the remaining chains and
slid to the door. “May I help you?” he
inquired.
“I think I’ve almost got it,” hissed
Leen from the other side.
Skill in the magical was, of course,
part of her job.
Shaa held his hand
above the lock to feel her work. “Very
adroit,” Shaa murmured. “Quite deft.”
“Thank you,” said Leen, as this door
made its own click. With a louder clack,
she swung back the bolt.
Shaa joined her in the hall. She was
looking down the corridor away from

the door through which they had been
brought. “You don’t think there’s some
secret exit from this place, do you?”
“A dungeon is typically constructed
with as few outlets as possible,” Shaa
reminded her.
“I suppose you’re right. What do we
do, then?”
The ﬁrst thing ahead was obvious.
That is, the ﬁrst thing after escaping
the dungeon and reaching the street.
But perhaps he was getting a bit ahead
of himself. “I don’t particularly feel like
overpowering guards and engaging in
armed combat right at the moment.
What about you?”
“Well, I’d rather not, but what else
can we do? We’ve got to get out of here!
Don’t we?”
“Oh, certainly we do.
Have you
done any cloaking work? Misdirection
spells?”

“In school, but that was a long time
ago.
Now I wouldn’t know where to
start.”
“Hold still, then,” Shaa instructed.
“You are about to become a housecat.”
Leen grasped his arm. “Wait - doesn’t
your curse keep you from doing spell-
work? What if you die - I don’t want
-”
“Things,” said Shaa, “appear to have
changed.
I wouldn’t mind your keep-
ing that to yourself, though, if you
wouldn’t mind?”
“Changed? Oh! Yes, right, of course.”
“Just so.
Let’s return to the hold-
ing still, then, shall we?” His con-
trol over the side-lobe emissions from
the energies involved would be some-
what tricky, since Arznaak did have
magic-release detectors out among his
other alarms, and since Shaa’s practi-
cal skills were sure to be reasonably

rusty after the years of occupying the
sidelines.
Shaa had always been the
family’s real sorcery whiz, though, he
didn’t mind acknowledging, and this
wasn’t the ﬁrst time he’d had to deal
with this style of work from his brother,
either. And the work involved was thor-
oughly trivial to boot...
“There we are,” Shaa announced.
“Already?” said Leen. “I didn’t even
think you’d started.”
“Transforming us into cats would
have taken time.” Actually, even do-
ing this to a ﬁrst-caliber level would
have taken time.
His quick probe of
the building above having revealed
a low count of guards and retainers
hanging about, though, a full-scale
job shouldn’t be necessary.
Accord-
ingly, he’d been more concerned about
someone popping around a corner un-
expectedly and looking right at them.

“Just think of yourself as wearing a
cat-shaped throw rug, and remember
that to anyone more than a foot away
you look to be no more than about six
inches high off the ground. Now, since
there’s no one just beyond the door at
the end of this hall, perhaps you’d be
good enough to open it and we’ll be on
our way.”
It all proved far too easy, but some-
times that’s just the way things go. In
the event they met no one at all on the
way through the building.
Of course,
legions of retainers were immaterial
to a god, especially one as sneaky as
his brother doubtless intended to be.
They did have to wait in an alcove for
a trio of guards possibly on the way
to lunch to pass through the garden
before making their ﬁnal sprint for the
door in the back wall; that passage
too, however, was accomplished with

further incident. They were down the
alley and around the corner and an-
other block away before Shaa called
Leen to a halt. “I’m not used to this,”
was the ﬁrst thing she said, “so I’m not
going to argue with whatever you say.
Just tell me what to do now.”
“I will welcome your input wherever
you wish to make it available,” Shaa
said judiciously. His heart had devel-
oped a pound from the sprinting and
dashing, but no more than the level
to which he had become accustomed.
Still, physical exertion would need to
be planned judiciously.
Which was not the same as avoid-
ing exertion altogether.
“Let’s take a
quick stroll around the neighborhood,”
suggested Shaa. “Shall we?”
“I, ah, stroll?”
“The most important thing to do
right at the moment is to try to ﬁnd

Jardin, wouldn’t you say? The former
Curse Administrator?
Presumably,
he’s been dumped somewhere in an
alley, and from the look of that fellow
my brother sent off to do the job I’d
suspect he didn’t take him far.”
Actually, Shaa reﬂected, he was not
being entirely straightforward with
the Archivist.
Short of combing the
gutters how would they accomplish
this search? Even within a four-block
range there could easily be enough al-
leys and hiding places to keep them
busy the rest of the afternoon. Jardin’s
god-signature was probably gone at
the moment, too, which would leave
them nothing useful to home in on
either.
In any case, running up and
down blocks clawing through garbage
promised to beneﬁt no one but Shaa’s
washerwoman.
There was, of course, a more attrac-

tive alternative to the wielding of their
own ﬁne-tooth comb.
It did present
its own hazards, which were of a dif-
ferent caliber than those posed by a
quest through rubbish.
The perils of
rubbish were those of an esthetic and
public health nature, rather than im-
mediately those of life, limb, and sanity.
Shaa would choose the risk to sanity
any day. With some judicious footwork
it should even be possible to keep se-
cret Max’s involvement, whatever it
had been.
But that could wait a few moments.
There were a few things that needed
to be aired with the Archivist while he
had her preoccupied, hence this entire
exercise.
“What do you think your brother’s
likely to do next?” Leen asked, follow-
ing him.
“The fact that I’m still alive - that

we’re still alive, pardon me - implies
any number of things, all of them nasty
and any of them probably quite big. As
you heard him say, he does like an au-
dience.”
“Aren’t you worried that he’ll. . . ”
“What, reach out and smite us? That
remains a distinct, if somewhat remote,
possibility. Resting in one position par-
alyzed with fear, however, seems like
more a strategy to assure that outcome
than one calculated to fend it off.
If
he wanted to kill us straight out, well,
he’s already had years. He’s trying to
be more diabolical than that, clearly.”
“But you’re his brother.
Don’t you
have any more insight than that?”
“If I were him,” Shaa said, “I’d either
be consolidating my position or using
the element of surprise to propel my
next stage of attacks. He’s more rash
than I am, so he may very likely have

overrun a few more gods since he left
us. Perhaps the Emperor too, for that
matter.”
“You think Arznaak’s going after the
Emperor?”
Shaa raised an eyebrow as they
turned another corner into another
major street. No bodies were obvious
in the ruts, although what about that
sizable mound of dirt?
He led them
ambling toward it.
“I wouldn’t be at
all surprised. I’m rather inclined to let
him.”
“Surely you’d at least warn the Em-
peror. Wouldn’t you?”
“He’s a big boy, or at least he’s sup-
posed to be. In any case, he’s no partic-
ular friend of mine.”
“But if Arznaak, I don’t know, over-
throws him too, won’t that give him so
much power that -”
“What it would give Arznaak is no

shortage of new trouble.” No, the heap
was merely dirt and mud and dung.
The only living things it contained
were small and invertebrate.
“The
power of the Emperor is overrated,
anyway.”
“Trouble? What trouble? Managing
all the new troops and resources he’d
have at his disposal? Deciding who to
launch Peridol into war against?”
“Not at all. By trampling the com-
pact, he’d bring down on his head
the obligated wrath of the other gods.
Whoever he might be allied with, they
couldn’t overlook a blatantly prohib-
ited power grab like that.”
“What if he isn’t allied with anyone?
What if it’s just him?”
“Hmm,” said Shaa.
His brother
clearly had enough gall. Of his nerve
there was no doubt. Could this be his
plan? To run full-tilt through gods and

humans, bowling them over through a
mixture of bravado and accumulated
momentum?
But what other choice did he have?
Being Arznaak, he wouldn’t just stop
now. And if he moved rapidly enough,
even the gods might not realize what
was happening until it was too late. On
the other hand...
If Arznaak was on a course of wiping
out the gods, how was that different
from what Max kept saying he wanted
to do?
The difference, of course, was
Arznaak himself. Arznaak would want
one god left, certainly, and possibly
others to serve him.
Yes, that was a
signiﬁcant difference.
At least when
there were a bunch of gods, they had
to operate within strictures, under a
balance of power.
If there was only
one there would be nothing to stop
him from whatever he wanted. “Very

well,” Shaa declared.
“Luck is where
luck usually is, somewhere else, mak-
ing the enterprise of this search futile.
Before we proceed to the next step, I
must ask you - are you with me? Do
you have any thought of siding with
my brother in the hope you will avert
his wrath?”
“After he kidnapped me off the street
and threw me in his dungeon?”
“With no lasting harm that can be
seen,” observed Shaa. “You will have
noticed that my brother is a master of
second-order plots.”
“Are you implying I’m the same?”
“I don’t know.
We haven’t been ac-
quainted long. Are you?”
“There’s nothing I could say that
would convince you one way or the
other,” said Leen. “Is there? But right
now you don’t have much to lose and
we both have a lot to gain.
What do

you propose to do?
Do you intend to
stop your brother and rescue Max?”
Shaa eyed the Archivist. His ques-
tion had been more misdirection; Arz-
naak wasn’t that charming, especially
after you’d seen his other side, as she
had quite recently.
No, the problem
would be her feelings for Max.
Well,
perhaps she could resolve them before
the question became too important, al-
though if she could successfully resolve
her relationship with Max in a mutu-
ally acceptable manner that would
stand the test of time she’d be the ﬁrst
one. Damn that Maximillian, anyway.
“Both of these are my eventual hope,”
Shaa told her.
Along with whatever
else might need doing as a result.
“What is your plan, then?”
“I am making this up,” Shaa said,
also with less than total candor, “as I
go.”

“I don’t believe you,” Leen said imme-
diately. “But if that’s the line you want
to take I’m willing to play along with
you for the time being. What are you
making up for the next move, then?”
Why were people never willing to
just play their assigned role? “You and
I must part. There is more that needs
doing than a single person can oversee
without destroying its time value.
I
would ask you to recruit your brother.”
“To ﬁnd Jardin?”
“Unless the Crawﬁsh already has
him in claw, don’t bother. I will handle
that.
You ﬁnd out what’s become of
Max - but please, if he is in no imme-
diate danger, don’t run after him to
pull him out. Okay? Thank you. Also,
perhaps your brother, who is, after all,
my sister Eden’s principal agent in
town, would be good enough to relay
the news to her in Yenemsvelt.”

“If the curse is lifted from her too, do
you want her to join you in the city?”
“What I want is likely immaterial. If
the subject comes up, though, I’d rec-
ommend she drop from sight. This also
would be good advice for you.”
“I’ll have Lemon to watch my back.
He knows his way around these things,
but if we just try to hide, sooner or later
Arznaak will be back.”
“This has not escaped my contem-
plation. Especially since whatever my
brother wants from your Archives he
has yet to obtain. You might also con-
sider what that might be.
Ah - you
know what it is?
You are looking at
me in a more than casually speculative
manner.”
“You made me think of something
else.
At least I think it’s something
else. How well do you know those an-
cient languages Max seemed so adept

with?”
“I can get by. There are others who
are better than me, a particular cult
here in the city; the worshipers of what
they choose to think of as the One true
God. Why?”
“Ah, I think it had better wait until
later.”
“With the way events have been
evolving,” Shaa pointed out,
“there
may not be a ‘later,’ at least for some of
us.”
“Don’t you think you’re being a little
histrionic?”
“Do you?”
“I - well, maybe not,” Leen allowed.
“Very well.
I uncovered an ancient
device, Pre-Dislocation, hidden in the
depths of the Archives.
It is still ac-
tive, although its activity is cryptic. I
showed it to Max - don’t ask me for the
full story now, okay? - and it responded

when he spoke to it in one of the old
languages. Then it seemed to ask for
something Max couldn’t give
it - a password of some sort, I expect
- and closed itself down.”
This is not the ﬁrst ancient asso-
ciation recently to arise, Shaa noted.
Perhaps the Iskendarian papers recov-
ered by Max from their hiding place
and now in the capable hands of Roni-
bet Karlini could be brought to bear
on this topic as well.
The One God
cultists had already been consulted
on the Iskendarian material, or to be
more precise, Jurtan Mont had been
dispatched on this errand yesterday
morning and had not yet to Shaa’s
knowledge reported back.
It would
be nice to get Max’s assessment of the
thing, but in the phrase of the ancients,
that was clearly easier said than done.
“Did Max say what he thought this in-

strument was? What about you - what
do you think it is?”
Leen’s mouth twisted. “Max was be-
ing mysterious, and at the same mo-
ment he discovered he had to run out
the door to attend to something else,
which I now suspect was related to his
scheme with Jardin.”
“Yes, that’s Max, all right,” Shaa
murmured. “And your opinion?”
“I think it’s a computer,” she said.
“From the fragmentary sources I’ve
read, I’ve never been entirely sure
what a computer was or what they
were used for.
I’ve always thought
these computers end up sounding too
omnipresent and all-encompassing to
be more than myth, or metaphor per-
haps; something like djinni trapped in-
carnate in mechanical shells. But the
thing in the basement does seem to ﬁt
many of the physical descriptions: ﬂat

glowing lights in regular patterns, an
oracular voice speaking a lost tongue,
more high-grade metal than I’ve ever
seen in one place -”
“And buried in the Archives,” added
Shaa. “A place of prodigious and seam-
less memory.”
“Scarcely seamless, but yes.
I’ve
read about these computer things be-
ing repositories of ancient wisdom too.
What do you think?
Have you ever
seen one of them?”
“A computer?” Shaa said. “No. Some-
thing matching the description you
specify?
No.
However, in the course
of my experiences with Maximillian,
and my own escapades over the years,
I know better than to assume that any-
thing described in association with the
ancients is merely myth. Their trick-
sterism was legion. So beware of this
thing you’ve unearthed.
Its lethality

most likely goes in direct proportion
to its signiﬁcance.
Contact the One
God people.” He gave her instructions.
“Also - this may ultimately be a better
reason to extract Max than anything
else.
But please don’t be precipitate.
Please? Wait for me.”
“I said I would.”
“Very well. Let us be off, then.”
The closest thing to a coach in the
vicinity just then was a garish rick-
shaw. Shaa instructed the driver, gave
a last wave of acknowledgement to
Leen, and let the vehicle clop away.
Shaa had taken the opportunity to
reconnoiter
his
destination
several
days earlier.
The location was not
exactly obscure, and his goal at the mo-
ment was not what you would call clan-
destine, but it never hurt to know the
lay of the land. It would be important
to bring the Karlinis up to date - and

perhaps the Creeping Sword would
have something of value to add too,
you never knew - but the Jardin situ-
ation seemed more urgent. Although
did he remember how to work remote
communications? What was Karlini’s
recipient address key? Shaa sank back
and closed his eyes...
Either he wasn’t doing it right or
Karlini was for some reason off the
line. What about -
The rickshaw lurched forward. “We
here,” the driver announced.
So they were.
Shaa paid off and
crossed the gleaming sidewalk.
The
grand entry ahead above a ﬂight of
wide stairs would lead through a col-
lonaded aisle to the temple proper, a
rectangular building with a broad nave
ending in an apse. He had, after all,
reconnoitered. He would not be going
as far as the apse, though, and even

the nave was in question.
Instead,
he glanced around the lobby, reori-
enting himself, and then approached
the woman who was obviously, from
the number of jewels on her breast-
plate, the senior priest on duty.
She
sat on a well-cushioned chair with a
high, ﬂuted back behind a desk laden
with forms for the requesting of indul-
gences, casting an eagle glare around
the sparse trafﬁc trickling in and out.
“By the look of you you’re here for some-
thing major,” the august one addressed
Shaa.
Yes, Shaa thought, but it’s hardly
what you think.
“I need to see Her
Godship,” he declared, “and don’t tell
me she’s not in town because I know
she is.”
The priest’s gaze hardened.
“My
Lord does not treat with buffoons. You
must perform your supplication in the

traditional manner, and as ardently
as possible.
I advise you to go clean
yourself up before presenting yourself
here again. Only the holiest of human
-”
“If Her Godship ﬁnds out you kept
me waiting she’ll break you back to a
newt.”
She raised her nose and eyed him su-
perciliously along it. “Thoroughly out
of the question. The supplication line
begins down there, in the nave. Either
join it or leave.
Or do you have the
resource for an indulgence?” She had
been joined at either side by a guard
bearing
an
anything-but-ceremonial
pike.
Shaa realized he was rather looking
forward to something like this.
Now
we’ll see about that heart, he thought.
But responsibility still came before
pleasure.
“I have tidings that won’t

wait,
concerning Jardin,
Master of
Curses.”
That did slow her down, at least
until the old girl decided again Shaa
was merely a mad person of the streets.
“Then tell me your words. I will convey
them.”
Shaa released one of his more sar-
donic grins. “Up to you. The news is
he’s been pulverized.”
The priest went white. “He’s been -
how would you -” She released a most
unpriestly imprecation and rose to
her feet. “Follow me – no, wait. You!
Acolyte!”
A pair of matching pimply kids in
low-order robes stood at attention on
either side of the door to the cathe-
dral proper. They were both looking at
Shaa’s priest. The nearer one pointed
uncertainly at his own chest.
The
priest glared at him and made a vio-

lent gesture with her arm.
The kid
scrambled over. “Guide this man down-
stairs as fast as you can.”
The pikemen joined Shaa in a trot
as behind them, the priest he had con-
fronted gathered up the indulgences,
thrust them into a lower drawer, and
took off without another look round in
the other direction, out the exit door
and onto the street.
Perhaps, Shaa
thought, as the lobby disappeared out
of sight around the corner of the stair-
case they were now descending toward
the innards of the temple, she is un-
willing to be associated in even a cir-
cumstantial way with the delivery of
bad news. Of course, if that was the
source of prudence - as there was no
doubt it was - then just what did he
think he was doing?
Unfortunately, what came naturally.
Debarking from the staircase and wan-

dering a short maze of passages, Shaa
and his escorts came upon a tall cham-
ber with a polished obsidian ﬂoor and
twinkly wall hangings. Shaa averted
his eyes as much as possible from the
garish furnishings and ﬁxed his gaze
on the armed priest contingent at the
far end.
Then they had crossed the
room and the acolyte was confronting
his betters, trying to explain the er-
rand that had brought him here.
Shaa considered using another mis-
direction spell. Deploying magic in a
god’s own sanctum was considered one
of the riskier maneuvers, all things
considered, by those who had studied
the issue from afar; the maneuver had
been studied from afar since those who
had attempted it were not generally
available for feedback. But there was
misdirection, and misdirection.
Shaa waited until the assembled ec-

clesiastics had glanced at him again
and then retreated back into their hud-
dle; then he took a half-step back and
edged to the side.
One of his guard-
escorts turned to follow him.
Shaa
rested a gentle hand on the guard’s
pike shaft, but then somehow the butt
of the pike ended up between the fel-
low’s legs with its business end tan-
gling with the tunic of the other escort,
and then both escorts were hanging
onto each other to keep from falling
to the ﬂoor, their feet slipping and
skidding on the slick obsidian surface,
and then they were falling to the ﬂoor
anyway in a mess of ﬂailing arms and
waving staffs.
All eyes turned to the
cascading guards;
all eyes, that is,
except for Shaa’s, which were ﬁxed se-
curely on the door he was approaching
on a rapid lope from a oblique angle.
Then the shouting was suddenly and

obviously directed at him, but by then
he was through the door and shutting
it securely again behind himself.
The room Shaa found himself occu-
pying had the look of a law library.
Bookcases ﬁlled with matched leather-
bound tomes crept up the walls, punc-
tuated by banks of ﬁling cabinets and
several large desks. Even apart from
the furniture, however, Shaa was not
occupying the room alone. Three peo-
ple were facing each other in front of
a tall wall-mirror, their expressions
indicating mutual astonishment.
“We meet again,” Shaa said to the
ﬁrst personage, the woman he’d met
on the dock on his arrival in Peridol,
whom he had subsequently researched,
and whom he had come to her tem-
ple expecting to see.
“As do we,” he
added to the Creeping Sword as well,
although he had surely not expected

him.
And then, to be comprehensive
and to fully observe the social niceties,
he addressed with a courteous bow the
third member of the group, only now
fully emerging from the mirror. “The
pleasure is mine,” proclaimed Shaa.
“The true Gashanatantra, I presume.”

Chapter4
SO IT HAD COME TO THIS. But
what was ‘this,’ really? Other than a
serious overstatement of his reputa-
tion?
His body was strapped rigidly to a
sledge. Pillory blocks had been locked
across his ankles, his legs at mid-calf
and mid-thigh, his lower and upper
body, and the upper arm. Each hand
had been forced into a steely glove, and
then cords had been passed through

the tie-down rings at the end of each
ﬁnger and lashed ﬁrmly to a spread-
eagle frame. The sledge in its turn had
been chained down to the walls of the
dungeon cell with enough footage of
hawser to have moored a good-sized
schooner.
As if that wasn’t enough, a grilled
mask like an animal muzzle covered
his face from the nose on down, and a
carved mouthpiece kept his lips parted
and his tongue mashed uncomfortably
against his lower gums. Did they think
he was going to bite someone’s nose
off unless forcibly restrained? He was
scarcely a homicidal maniac, Max re-
ﬂected; if nothing else he was far too
cultured for that, yet here he was in -
CLASH! CLANG!
Ow!
Mounted somewhere out of
sight just behind his head was some
additional diabolic mechanism whose

only purpose seemed to be the making
of random out-of-tune and extremely
loud noises aimed at driving him out
of his mind. Or if not out of his mind,
then preventing him from putting two
thoughts together endwise. If he had
retained any hope of launching a con-
juration under these circumstances,
suppressor radiators aimed at him
from the corners of the cell projected
a seamless anti-magic ﬁeld across the
entire space.
Well, he was in the soup now, there
was no denying that. The noisemaker
let loose with another cacophonous cat-
erwauling as a different part of the
mechanism whomped enthusiastically
on what sounded to be a large cookpot.
I wonder if they plan to feed me, Max
wondered to himself. If they did how
would they accomplish it?
The drip-
ping of gruel paste over the mask so

it could dribble down into his mouth?
Spray him with water from the door?
If you were going to succumb to a
trap, though, it might as well be a good
one. The one that had landed him here
had certainly been a champion.
Although the architect of the plot
had not formally unveiled him- or her-
self, Shaa’s brother Arznaak would ap-
pear as a leading suspect to be involved
somewhere, at least. The plot-master
had a detailed knowledge of the way
Max’s mind worked; had in fact used
Max’s own methods of plotting to have
Max, himself, help deliver himself into
his hands. Outmaneuvered he clearly
had been. And outsmarted; he didn’t
mind giving appropriate credit when
he was forced to. And taken unawares.
For all of his paranoia, he had never
seen this coming.
He had seen something coming, yes.

All of those attacks by old adversaries
had to have been coordinated for some
purpose. The involvement of the Hand
in lowering the ﬁnal boom demon-
strated that much. And Max had been
looking over his shoulder more than
was even his usual hyper-sensitive
habit.
Arznaak was also ruthless enough
to blow up the Emperor’s own review-
ing stand and a major bridge to boot
just to implicate Max in terrorism of
the most heinous nature. Just? Well,
probably not ‘just’; there had likely
been another goal served simultane-
ously, but damned if he could think
through what it might have been with
that thing next to him pounding away
like a mechanical banshee.
...But even so, there still had to
be more to it than he’d seen himself.
Jardin had the ring containing Pod

Dall. Would he realize Max had booby-
trapped it, anyway, regardless of their
mutual assurances, or would he just
go on to use it? If Jardin was part of
the plot, as seemed more than likely,
then was he in league with Arznaak?
Arznaak knew Max’s habits; he’d real-
ize the ring had to be trapped, so he’d
warn Jardin... unless he didn’t.
Arznaak couldn’t have been after
that - could he?
Of course he could.
Arznaak as a god.
That’s all they
needed.
Maybe it was just as well for Max
to stay wrapped up here in the dun-
geon, spending his time twiddling his
thumbs.
Although that was only a
metaphorical option.
Max couldn’t
even move a thumb, much less twiddle
it.
But he still had responsibilities that

wouldn’t go away. Who had Shaa? And
Leen? Max didn’t know how long it had
been, a few hours at most, but that was
surely long enough for any number of
distressing possibilities to have come
into effect.
Actually, though, the thought that
Arznaak was involved was somewhat
reassuring, in a bizarre sort of back-
handed way. Arznaak’s modus operandi
was to let his victims dangle in contem-
plation of their possible fates, rather
than proceed to their immediate dis-
memberment or outright eradication.
After toying with Shaa all these years
why would he put an abrupt end to
his fun? Even he, Max, could clearly
have been slaughtered by the Hand on
the bridge rather than being trundled
back to the palace complex. And where
there was life, there was... the promise
of further aggravation.

Anyway,
whatever
had
been
in
progress had most likely already played
itself out, at least for the present act.
A single act wasn’t an entire play,
though...
even if the cast of charac-
ters sometimes had a distressing habit
of changing during the interval. Well,
at least there was still Karlini.
And
Roni; especially Roni.
The work she
had been doing had been on the verge
of fruition.
Perhaps the best thing
would be to sit tight and wait for one
of them to come and get him out.
Maybe he’d even make bail.
Well, if nothing else perhaps he’d
be able to catch up on his sleep.
He
could just let the clamor from the
noisemaker wash over him, slide past
him, as he subsided into a meditative
state...
Wait a minute. That clang was dif-
ferent.
It had come from the other

side of the cell, where the door was.
Max opened his eyes.
Standing over
him was a familiar face. “About time
somebody showed up,” Max mumbled
around the mouthpiece.
Max had not been badly injured by
the events on the bridge. He was show-
ing no lasting danger signs from being
hit in the head by ﬂying chunks of
pavement, or almost no danger signs;
the ringing in his ears and the occa-
sional double vision could be explained
by the auditory torture device alone.
The Hand hadn’t roughed him up to
any great extent, either.
Even his
appearance was probably better than
most, due to his momentary bath in
the Tongue Water.
Of course, a dip
in the Tongue was likely to leave you
with its own aftereffects, but at least
it had taken off the surface layer of
grime and soot.

He had been lucky.
Most every-
one present on the scene must have
been worked over to one degree or
another.
Even, apparently, the digni-
taries attending to take part in the
ceremony. But there were dignitaries
and dignitaries.
Max didn’t know if
he’d ever seen a god looking quite so
ill-used. Especially one venturing out
in public with his head swathed in
an oozing linen bandage that drooped
low to cover his left eye, the remain-
ing strands of mustache that had not
been crisped off shooting away in ev-
ery direction like the whiskers of a cat.
Especially one favoring a leg with a
locked knee and leaning on a cane, of
all things.
“So,” said Phlinn Arol ﬁnally, “just
what do you thing you’re doing?”
“What does it look like?” Max said,
less distinctly than he liked.
Damn

that thing in his mouth. “Waiting for
someone to rescue me.
Is that why
you’re here?”
Phlinn
Arol
gave
Max
a
severe
look.
“The very thought of you wait-
ing passively is preposterous.” Then
he widened his glance to include the
rest of the cell, and pursed his lips in
assessment. “Still, preposterous or no,”
he said grudgingly, “this does look to
be an effective pen of conﬁnement.”
“Right, yeah.
If anybody around
here remembered how to do suspended
animation I’m sure I’d be in it, but this
place is a close second. So are you here
to get me out, or what?”
“Unfortunately it’s not nearly that
simple. You don’t have any place to sit
down in here, do you?”
“It hasn’t exactly been me hiding the
furniture.”
“Urr,” grumbled Phlinn Arol.
He

settled for leaning back against one
of the sledge-restraint chains to take
some of weight off his bad leg.
Max
had to crane his eye around to the side
to keep him in view.
“What have you been doing?” the Ad-
venturers’ God asked Max again.
“The last few hours?
Engaging in
thought.”
“Pure thought?”
“When’s the last time you saw purity
in this world?”
“A point well, if sadly, taken.
But
that’s still not the answer I had in
mind.
Typically, you’re spinning the
question the wrong way.”
“So twirl it back at me again. What
are you getting at?”
“What did you say? Oh, yes, I see.
Have -”
“If you want to understand me better
just take off this mask thing.”

Phlinn Arol looked away. “Even that
would scarcely be so simple.”
“What’s not simple?” Max garbled. “I
can feel it latches in the back.”
“You tried to assassinate the Emperor
designate, and me too as well.”
“You don’t actually believe that, do
you? What do I have against the Em-
peror?
What do I have against you?
Somebody wants me on ice, that’s all,
and maybe frozen so solid I’ll never
thaw out. I’ve got a pretty good guess
who, too.”
“And who would that be?”
“Arznaak, who else?”
“Are you certain you’re not letting
longstanding personal animosity get
between you and a reasonable presen-
tation of the truth?”
“What better reason to pull some-
thing like this against me than long-
standing personal animosity?
If it

makes you feel better, I am certain
there’s more to what’s going on than
just landing me on the shelf.”
Phlinn Arol scowled. He was looking
less and less happy all the time. “As
it develops, you happen to be correct.
Yet let us stay with you for the moment.
You are the most radical of radical Ab-
dicationists. You wish to make the gods
abandon humanity to its own indepen-
dent fate, and have been willing to pur-
sue any means to that end.”
“I’ve never assassinated anybody.”
“Tell me of your recent dealings with
Jardin, Administrator of Curses.”
“He was after the Pod Dall ring. I
traded it to him in exchange for lifting
the curse on the Shaas.”
“So you did have the ring,” said
Phlinn darkly.
“I thought as much.
And when Jardin received the ring
from your hand, it was fully opera-

tional? No booby traps?”
“Well, sure.”
“‘Well, sure,’ which?”
Max snorted as well as he could
manage under the circumstances. How
much did Phlinn Arol know?
What
had been happening out there? Phlinn
might be the key to springing him from
this joint - it would be prudent to be
straight with him.
Unless through
being straight he made himself out to
be so dangerous he needed to remain
cooped up. “Of course it was trapped.
You don’t think I’d pass something like
that ring off without some kind of safe-
guard, do you? I wanted to have the
Shaa problem off my back, ﬁnally, but
I didn’t intend to create a bigger mess
while I was doing it. I ﬁgured Jardin’d
detect the trap and have to spend time
disarming it, and that would give me
enough time to catch up with him and

get the thing back.”
“I see. And then once you’d retrieved
the ring Jardin would continue to
honor your agreement?
The Shaas
would remain curse-free? Max, I know
you too well. The only outcome you’d
have been happy with was an incapac-
itated or inept Curse Administrator,
one unable to reinstitute this curse.”
“I thought it was supposed to be a
heroic thing to try to help your friends
against overwhelming odds. I thought
that kind of thing was what you were
there to support.”
“Touché, Maximillian. But I should
not have to remind you that timing is
also crucial, and in this case you were
badly off the mark. Even if you were
merely duped, as seems perfectly plau-
sible to me, what you may have helped
to set loose is of signiﬁcant concern.”
“Anything I may have helped to set

loose I can also help to contain, but I
can’t very well do it pegged down like a
-”
“There are... complications,” Phlinn
Arol said reluctantly, yet again.
“As
you know, I dislike taking an explicit
hand in these things. There are also al-
ready enough destabilizing inﬂuences
in circulation without reinserting you
once again, too.
You may yet have a
further role to play, but there is chaos
enough at the moment without making
the situation yet more complicated.”
What was he really saying?
“Does
this mean you’ve teamed up with the
Hand now?”
“I am open to all those who seek me.
That is part of the job.”
“You’re giving chapter and verse to
me? Who the hell you think you’re kid-
ding? I’ve never met a god who didn’t
play favorites and neither have you. If

you want to simplify things you should
just drag the Hand in here for a change
and ask them what’s going on.
They
didn’t just happen to wander in from
stage right, they were part of whatever
plan was really happening there.
Or
if not then at least tell the Emperor to
watch out for them.”
“Oh? And why is that?”
It was obvious. Phlinn had to know
it was obvious. So why would he ask,
unless - unless – “Why don’t you just
tell whoever it is lurking out there in
the hall to come on in,” Max called in
a voice he hoped would reach the hall
itself.
Phlinn Arol gazed impassively at
Max. After a moment, a shadow dark-
ened the doorway, hesitated, and then
drifted into the cell.
The cell, which
was not large, had suddenly become
crowded. A voice spoke from beneath

the cloak. “So, this is your Maximillian,
up close.”
“That’s him,” said Phlinn Arol.
“So. Maximillian,” said the hooded
man. “You claim it was not your plot
to kill the Emperor-designate? Shall I
put you to the question to know for cer-
tain?”
Why do they always think they can
pull this off? Max thought. These peo-
ple should read more. “There’s no point
in torturing somebody who’s telling the
truth. If they break down all you get
on top of the truth is fabrication. And I
don’t break down.”
“You are quite the notorious fellow.
Your sobriquet scarcely does you jus-
tice.”
“It wasn’t my idea.”
“What?” said the robed ﬁgure. “De-
liberately garbling your speech again?
No, I see, the mouth-manacle remains.

The
Emperor-designate
was
asking
certain...
pointed questions about
you, you know, after your disruptive
performance with the Scapula at the
Initiation Ball.”
“Did the Emperor-designate like the
answers?”
Phlinn Arol cleared his throat. “Max
understands who you are,” he stated
mildly.
“Yes, I suppose he does,” said the
Emperor-designate.
He swept back
the hood of his cloak.
“You wish me
to believe that you are innocent of
the popular sentiment associating you
with the terrorist assassins, and pro-
pose instead that you are the dupe of
a widespread plot. Because this enemy
of yours, this mercenary Hand troop,
is engaged by my guard for additional
support during the Knitting period,
you claim they belong to this plot, and

by extension are traitorously part of
the assassination attempt?”
“That’s right as far as it goes,” Max
said, “Your Highness. If I were you I’d
make inquiries.”
“Oh, I am. I am here, for one.”
“Have you inquired in Arznaak’s di-
rection?”
The eyes in the golden face were
still hooded.
“The Scapula has been
unreachable today.”
“Then you’ve got to ﬁgure he’s cer-
tainly up to something.”
“I have made my own inquiries,” said
Phlinn Arol. “Jardin, Master of Curses,
has dropped from the Net of Gods, yet
the carrier sigil of his ofﬁce remains
alive.
I have traced him last to the
headquarters of the Scapula. One hy-
pothesis is that the Master of Curses
has been usurped.”
“Is this common knowledge?” said

the Emperor.
“No,” Phlinn Arol told him. “My re-
sources are not typical.”
“I’ve faced Arznaak before,” said
Max.
“You’ve got to move fast; you
can’t let him get out in front of you.”
The Emperor-designate favored him
with a small smile. “If the Scapula has
Transcended, he’ll have much larger
matters to concern himself with than
me. Isn’t that so, Phlinn?”
“That may be the case.”
“Arznaak is the brother of my closest
associate,” Max protested. “I know him
pretty well - far too well. One of his
greatest satisfactions in climbing up
the ladder is being able to deal with
the folks he’s left behind. He’s already
moved against you at the bridge. What
do you think’s going to stop him now?”
The Emperor-designate turned away.
“I have heard enough for-”

“Are you afraid of him?” Max called.
The Emperor hesitated.
“Afraid of
Arznaak? Why, should I be?”
“Only if you’re intelligent and awake.”
“I have nothing to fear from the
Scapula. He owes me too much,” the
Emperor-designate
said
expansively,
“although I will admit to certain other
precautions as well.”
“Yeah, well, I thought I’d taken pre-
cautions too, and look at where I am.”
“Surely you don’t expect me to free
you and employ you against him.”
“Only if you’re intelligent and awake.”
“You have not convinced me,” stated
the Emperor.
He raised his head re-
gally and headed for the corridor.
“Who recruited the Hand?” Max re-
peated.
The Emperor was already almost to
the door. He hesitated, then marched
through. Phlinn Arol levered himself

up from his perch on the chain and
eyed Max impassively.
“As a matter
of fact,” he said softly, “you’re right. I
checked that too.
There were inter-
mediaries, but ultimately it was the
Scapula.”
“If I were you I’d get him to put off
the Knitting,” Max said, equally softly,
in return. Anyway, his mouth was by
now so parched it hurt.
He couldn’t
speak much louder if he tried.
Phlinn Arol gazed back. Did he nod,
or was it merely the act of steadying
himself on his cane? Then he turned
and made his own exit.
An unseen guard dogged the heavy
door shut behind them.
In fact, the
two visitors were the only people Max
had seen since he’d been implanted in
the cell.
Did they credit him with a
basilisk stare too?
The ability to im-
part with the merest glance instant

hypnotic commands?
But there were far more important
things to worry about.
What had re-
ally been on Phlinn Arol’s mind?
If
Phlinn knew Max, Max also knew him.
He was badly preoccupied with some-
thing, and Max didn’t think it was
merely whether Max had gotten him-
self hooked up with terrorists. It was
something he obviously didn’t want to
air with the Emperor-designate stand-
ing there listening to the entire ex-
change. They had been focusing on the
action on the bridge, and the role of the
ring, but -
What if Phlinn Arol hadn’t been
just referring to the ring? ‘What you
may have helped to set loose’ - ‘al-
ready enough destabilizing inﬂuences
in circulation’ - what had Phlinn been
thinking of? More than Arznaak?
What was happening at the lab?

Chapter5
A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
STOOD with their mouths open, their
heads bent slightly as they stared
at something on the ground between
them. “There goes another one down,”
said Fire Chief Cinder, nudging the col-
lapsed form of the Great Karlini with
one foot.
He transferred his gaze up
toward Jurtan Mont, and then next to
him at Tildamire Mont.
“Any of you
folks ready to try whatever he was

ﬁxing to do?”
A hot whoosh!
roiled up from the
side. The three of them ignored it; it
was just more of the Karlini laboratory
building falling in on itself. If they had
bothered to spare a glance, however,
they would have noticed a curious spec-
tacle within the smoke and ﬂames. For
a moment the ﬂames and smoke them-
selves seemed to solidify into a regular
gridwork construction, of three double
pincer claws of ﬁre reinforced by gray
restraints of vaporous wire on a tele-
scoping crane-like base, with the claws
clamping themselves shut around the
tallest piece of standing wall and yank-
ing at it until it fell toward them in
cascading fragments that ripped the
claws back into coiling streamers of
disorganized ﬁre and the crane mount
into a curling geyser and then a de-
tached upward-breaking ﬁreball; but

that was clearly impossible, a purely
random illusion of shifting shadow and
light. “Not me,” said Jurtan. “Magic’s
not my thing.”
Magic wasn’t his thing; Jurtan knew
he couldn’t conjure the simplest effect
to save his life. He wouldn’t even know
where to start.
Perhaps if he’d paid
more attention while Tildy had been
doing her exercises under the tutelage
of Karlini’s wife he’d be equipped to
make a try of it.
But on the other
hand...
On the other hand, the way Jurtan’s
music sense operated often seemed like
magic.
What if it wasn’t merely like
magic at all? Max and Shaa had com-
mented that his music sense gave him
capabilities that required the use of
sorcery in others. So maybe there was
something he could do. He’d put people
to sleep before - why not a ﬁre?

Yet there was no need to rush into
the attempt. Quite the contrary. There
were at least two magic-user profes-
sionals lying comatose on the street to
attest to the potential hazards at hand
here. Something was clearly out of the
ordinary about this ﬁre, not that one
would expect anything different from
a disaster associated with the likes of
the Great Karlini. It was not necessar-
ily surprising, therefore, that Jurtan
gradually realized as he listened to
whatever his internal accompaniment
was trying to tell him about the conﬂa-
gration that it also felt like something
in the ﬁre was watching him.
Fire Chief Cinder turned his atten-
tion from the youth staring blank-eyed
at the engulfed building to the girl,
and when she shrugged helplessly and
shook her head he wiped them from
his mind and strode back toward his

forces. Even if he had seen the youth
suddenly fumbling in his pocket, and
then withdrawing with a triumphant
ﬂourish from the pocket a harmon-
ica, it would have meant nothing to
him, other than the fact that the youth
might be yet another one of the breed of
dangerous lunatics who often seemed
to be the principal denizens of the
Wraith District.
It was prudent to
spare enough attention to keep some
track of the lunatics in the immediate
vicinity, though, and Chief Cinder was
nothing if not prudent. As a veteran,
though, this cataloging rarely made
itself felt at a level of full conscious-
ness.
The blond fellow a head taller
than anyone else in sight making his
way up the street at a pace faster than
a trot, if less than a full-out run, and
that with a side of crisped beef slung
over one shoulder, for example, was

worth at least a tick in the mental
notebook. Not far away -
Something glinted in his periph-
eral vision, something fast, something
above - a dull bronze sphere festooned
with ...
stuff, banking around the
ﬂames forty feet over his head but leav-
ing its own trail of puffy smoke behind
it. The ﬂying thing spun around once
on its axis, hesitated in the air, and
swooped toward the ground, trailed by
a squawking seagull. A gout of steam
erupted from the matrix of vents in the
ball’s underside, a set of spidery legs in
a tripod conﬁguration protruded, and
then the machine was squatting on the
pavement next to the fallen Karlini,
temporarily
obscuring
him
beneath
the ﬂowing billows of vapor. “Now this
is what I call a mess,” said the ball.
The top of the vehicle pivoted back
and the pointy-eared head of Favored-

of-the-Gods emerged. “Who’s in charge
here?” he demanded, just as the seag-
ull, approaching from behind, pulled
up sharply and slapped him across the
head with its wing. Favored squawked
in a tone much like the bird’s and
fell abruptly from sight back into his
sphere while the bird executed a much
neater landing on Karlini’s chest and
began fanning the fumes away from
his face.
The clanging and clattering from
within the vehicle subsided, and two
hands’-worth of long spidery ﬁngers
reappeared grasping the lip of the
hatch. They were followed again by the
now considerably more annoyed face
of Favored. “What the hell happened
to him?” he snapped, looking over the
side at Karlini and the gull. Fire Chief
Cinder noted that the gnome, and for
that matter his entire vehicle, smelled

of smoke.
There was a lot of smoke around to-
day in general. “Are you a magician?”
Chief Cinder asked.
“Better than that,” snorted Favored.
“A ﬁre this hot should sterilize any-
thing
biological,
but
something
in
there’s still leaking energy anyway.
What you got to worry about is what-
ever that stuff is dripping into the
water table. Now here’s what the situ-
ation looked like on my overhead pass
just now.”
Jurtan had stepped out of the way of
the seagull and was humming carefully
on the harmonica, trying to feel his
way to the rhythm of the ﬁre. Atop the
ﬁre’s heavy bass roar, though, queru-
lous meandering snatches of melody
kept twisting out of nowhere like a
cloud of darting gnats. They could be
associated with the licks of leaping

ﬂame, but then there was a chance
they might really be related to some-
thing else instead. Roni had had those
vats of magical organisms in the lab;
surely the ﬁre would have sterilized
them to lifeless ash... but it did seem
as though something was surviving
most improbably in the midst of the
furnace. Or beneath it, perhaps, some-
where in the basement?
Then suddenly Jurtan knew what
the ﬁre was playing, atonal and harsh
though it was, and he began to lay his
own groove down around it.
“If you make a drop with the ﬁre-
retardant chemical just as we hit it
with our last water bomb,” Chief Cin-
der was telling Favored, “maybe we
can -”
An insistent beeping erupted from
inside the ball-vehicle. Favored ducked
his head down, muttering. “What the

hell is it this - wait a minute! That’s
not bad, kid.” He popped back up,
eyeing Jurtan across the pavement
furiously jawing away now with his
instrument. “Okay, Cinder, so let’s try
the bomb and the - wait, this is even
better - over here, you idiot!” Favored
yelled down the street, standing up
on the hatch rim and waving his arms
vigorously. “What the hell took you so
long?”
The tall man with the side of beef
loped up and set the meat on the
ground where it rolled about, moan-
ing. “Ice,” said the tall guy.
“Perhaps I will redeploy my forces,”
suggested Fire Chief Cinder under his
breath as he edged back out of the way.
Very well; he was ﬁnally willing to ad-
mit it, it was time to put in for a trans-
fer. Wraith District clearly had the bet-
ter of him. He had lasted longer than

his immediate two predecessors, by at
least two months. That should be good
for something, if not a full month-long
rest cure.
“He doesn’t look real useful to me,”
said Favored, inspecting the charred
yet still-writhing form of their recent
adversary Dortonn.
“We spoke during our journey from
the water,” Svin told him.
“He may
be stronger than he looks.” Svin bent
down and hauled Dortonn effortlessly
to his feet, then shook him out. Dor-
tonn persisted in his moaning.
Svin
brought his own face close and ad-
dressed him with his deepest, most
resonant voice, which was resonant
and deep indeed. “Dortonn, the time to
act is now.”
“Well, I’m gonna do this pass with
the
chemical,”
Favored
announced.
Gears clanked, vapor whooshed, and

the ball lurched again into the air. “Re-
member your master Pod Dall,” Svin
was exhorting Dortonn.
“Screw Pod Dall,” Dortonn mum-
bled through his cracked lips, but he
clenched his teeth and raised his arms
anyway, in a slow sequence of stiff
jerks. The blackened claws at the ends
of his hands began to unknot, showing
raw ﬂesh at the charred joints.
Tildamire Mont drifted aimlessly
back and forth at the far side of the
street. Too much, it was all too much.
Roni was gone, and all her husband
could do was pass out on the ground,
and all her idiot brother could do was
stand there playing his harmonica. It
was like a convention - that creature
ﬂying around in his machine, now with
orange dust cascading out of it above
the ﬁre, the ﬁremen loading a taut
water bladder that must have been

eight feet in diameter onto a winched-
back catapult, even that barbarian fool
Svin steadying that other person who
couldn’t be anything other than dead.
And there was still no sign - and likely
never would be again - of Senor Bal-
lista, who had rescued her from the
bridge and then sacriﬁced himself to
save her from the Creeping Sword. But
of all of them, she was the one left with
nothing to do, however futile, how-
ever insane.
She never should have
left home.
When her father, the for-
mer Lion of the Oolvaan Plain, heard
about this, he’d never take her seri-
ously again.
He’d know; even back
in Roosing Oolvaya, he’d know. She’d
failed when people had been depending
on her. She never should have -
SPROING! The water bomb left the
catapult and arched overhead.
Fa-
vored banked over its landing spot

and dumped the ﬁnal bag of ﬁre re-
tardant over the side, noticing as he
did that a layer of mist seemed to be
spontaneously condensing out of the
air around him.
Then it was more
than mist, it was a cloud, water, rain,
being wrung out of the humid sea at-
mosphere as though it were a mopping
cloth.
A sudden deluge washed over
Flotarobolis,
then
something
more
solid; hail, ice.
The ball shuddered
and Favored felt the craft begin to lose
altitude.
“There, are you satisﬁed?” croaked
Dortonn at Svin, watching his ice sheet
drop toward the ﬁre, already breaking
into steam. “May I die yet?”
“Is not your master Pod Dall a god of
Death? Would you not just be deliver-
ing yourself to him, and with your mis-
sion not accomplished?”
Dortonn grunted. “Are you a barbar-

ian or a lawyer?”
Abruptly Svin picked him up by the
neck and shook him. “Are you perform-
ing sabotage?”
“What?
-” The ﬂying machine was
falling into the steam clouds, tumbling
erratically, most of its vents frozen
closed.
Dortonn made a creaky pass,
easing back on the thermostatic regu-
lator, as the vehicle was lost to sight in
the mist.
Fire Chief Cinder felt increasingly
morose as he watched a new gout of
ﬂame arch up through the huge bil-
lows of steam. A tremendous quantity
of liquid had been thrown at this block,
enough to reduce any normal ﬁre to
soggy mush, yet still it burned; still it
kept ﬂaring. Something had to be leak-
ing energy into it, probably the same
something that had socked those magi-
cians out cold on the ground. So why

was this other magician, the charred
walking cadaver, still functioning? “Ex-
cuse me,” said Chief Cinder, moving
just barely into conversational earshot,
“do you detect a malign inﬂuence keep-
ing this conﬂagration alive?
I would
suggest not probing directly,” he added
hastily.
Only Svin was close enough to hear
Dortonn mutter his usual complaint
before bending himself to the task.
What was he saying now, the best way
to ﬁght ﬁres was to never touch them
directly?
Well, that apparently had
been his strategy; not to probe the ﬁre
at all, merely to drop liquids on it from
above.
“‘Malign inﬂuence,’ he says,”
rasped Dortonn.
“‘Malign inﬂuence’ -
phaugh! Fuzzy-headed thinking, mis-
use of - huh!”
“What?” Svin demanded.
Dortonn
was
concentrating
more

than Svin had seen him since they’d
arrived. “Not ‘malign,’ but indeed an
inﬂuence. Fairly powerful -”
In a rapid fan outward from the ﬁre-
wracked buildings across the street,
the
cobblestones
of
the
pavements
began
rifﬂing
upward
and
hurling
themselves into the air, the ground be-
neath them hissing and lashing. Svin
thought he might have heard Dortonn
change his last remark to “very pow-
erful,” but that could have just been
his own mind’s own reaction to the
latest development.
Perhaps a dozen
feet worth of cobblestones had left the
ground when the prodigy suddenly
ceased; at the same time, in fact, that
some of the airborne stones could be
observed to be coming apart into peb-
bles, gravel, sand; and other stones
were ﬂowing and melting like cobble-
shaped molds of gelatin or perhaps

loosely constituted rubber.
Then the
transﬁgured stones began to rain back
to earth. “I did not cause this,” stated
Dortonn, bending down and covering
his head with his arms.
Everyone in sight was trying to cover
themselves, those who were not ac-
tively ﬂeeing the scene or standing
gape-mouthed frozen in amazement.
Or those who were still playing their
harmonicas.
Maybe the real problem
here isn’t the ﬁre at all, Jurtan Mont
was thinking, doing his best to ignore
the fragments cascading around him,
and especially those few (fortunately
small) pattering onto his head; he had
the ﬁre’s meter and key and didn’t
want to lose them.
But perhaps the
real danger was related to those other
dancing harpsichord runs, the ones
he’d been trying to ignore as a distrac-
tion, the ones that had come to their

most coherent life in a rippling rush
perfectly coordinated with the unusual
behavior of the pavement just now.
Jurtan made his focus shift...
- and suddenly felt as though he’d
tossed his line into a bucket and
hooked a whale! His head shrieked at
him, his vision blurred behind a wash
of smearing green, he felt a knife-stab
pain in ﬁrst one ear and then the other,
the harmonica bashed itself against
his gums like a thing possessed - and
the only thought in his mind was the
irrelevant observation, “You’re in the
big time now, Jurtan.”
But he was, he clearly was, and
damned if he was going to let whatever-
it-was get the better of him.
What is the Mont boy doing?
Svin
wondered, straightening up again and
letting rocks cascade off his back. He
had been sheltering Dortonn with his

body;
the other Mont had unfortu-
nately been too far back for even him
to reach in time, although that had
also put her out of range of the worst
of the sudden downpour of solids. Had
Jurtan been bashed once too many in
the head? He was jittering like one of
those multi-jointed puppets on an elas-
tic string, blood pouring from both ears
and running freely over his shoulders,
still clutching of all things his absurd
instrument. And not merely clutching,
playing, although as with most of the
music he attempted, it sounded (to be
charitable) as though he was merely
following one small part in a large or-
chestral score.
But this time he had
clearly lost his mind.
Svin realized Dortonn was talking
to himself. His voice had not improved
- if anything, it had gotten worse - but
even though the sound was cracked

and distorted and barely audible to
boot, the words could be still be ascer-
tained. “It must be hiding underneath,”
he was saying, “using the power of the
ﬁre to go burrowing into the earth -
intelligent? No, I feel no intelligence -
but instinctual motivation? Yes?”
Should
Dortonn
be
interrupted?
Svin wondered, caught up as Dortonn
clearly was in a professional challenge?
Should or not, he must be dragged
back to the issue at hand - but how
best?
Why not just presume on his
competence?
“Can you kill it?” said
Svin.
“Poison it?
Send it to another
dimension?”
One baleful red eye swung up to
glare at him. “You will owe me more
than you can pay when this is ﬁn-
ished.”
“Just deal with it,” Svin said. “Talk
later.”

Overhead, Favored-of-the-Gods made
another erratic swooping pass in his
ball-vehicle. His scanners showed an-
other upwelling deep beneath the ﬁre.
He’d seen the same indications before
that strange bit with the animated
cobblestones - something putting out
enough thaumaturgical sideband radi-
ation to leave a crater thirty feet deep
if it all let loose at once.
Whatever
was down there was using a pumped-
resonance cycle,
feeding a catalytic
amount of energy to stoke the ﬁre and
then turning on the siphons when the
ﬁre took the bait and exploded.
It
had to have some shield, though; it
couldn’t survive in the middle of those
ﬂames, and it clearly wasn’t a creature
of ﬂames itself, no matter the manifes-
tations its emanations had shaped. So
it must be using a disinclination shield
of some sort, or perhaps a misdirecting

trick... and it bore remembering that
craters, of course, were scarcely the
real danger at hand, nor was energy,
no matter how prodigiously employed.
Did he have any acid bombs left in
this thing?
Jurtan was still ﬁghting the leviathan
but at least he still had it on his line.
He was starting to get a feel for its
jerks and thrashes, though, and even
better was the fact that it didn’t seem
to realize yet that he was playing it. If
he could just hit it with the right out-
of-phase harmonics he might even be
able to do better. He’d try a different
chord progression.
Svin was now watching Jurtan Mont
even more closely than Dortonn. What
if the kid wasn’t insane after all? “Dor-
tonn!” Svin said.
“Pay attention to
Mont, there. What is he doing?”
“Nothing, I’m certain,” growled Dor-

tonn, diverting a crispy hand to wave
indifferently
in
Jurtan’s
direction.
“Stop bothering - wait!
You’re right.”
He cocked his head to the side, lis-
tening with his residual fragment of
earlobe.
“I can only detect his side-
scatter, but yes, yes, if he does that,
than I will do - so!”
The ﬂying machine was making its
steepest approach yet to the center of
the ﬁre in the center of the Karlini
building, Svin noted, coming in almost
straight toward the ground. Had it lost
control again? But then a small egg of
gleaming copper metal emerged from
a protruding tube and disappeared
into the ﬂames as the ball lurched
away in a spasmodic roll that took it
into a leaping curtain of ﬂame... and
through, badly scorched, on the other
side. At Svin’s own side, Dortonn gave
a sudden shudder, his ﬁngers writhing

and his mouth moving without words;
then Dortonn seemed to abruptly lose
ﬁve pounds of his remaining weight in
Svin’s grip, and sagged limply. Jurtan
Mont’s instrument gave a ﬁnal discor-
dant blare and burst into fragments of
reed and horn. Mont took a unsteady
step to the rear, his bloody hands still
held out in front of him, then went over
onto his backside.
Well, that is that, Svin thought. The
last participants were now out of com-
mission, and no further reinforcements
were in sight.
A tall splash of ﬂame
erupted, as though a new barrel of oil
had been added to the wreckage, and
in its wake Svin felt a wind tugging
him toward the building.
Not strong
enough to pull him off his feet, it still
had the force to lift ashes and embers
and some of the scattered small rocks
and twirl them toward the inferno, and

pull over the remaining standing wall,
and suck in at the leaping ﬂames...
but then the wind died, and amazingly
enough the ﬁre seemed to suck in on
itself as well, and puff out.
Fire
Chief
Cinder
was
hollering
again, waving his men in his line of
sight back from their spread-out po-
sitions along the block, where they
had been ﬁghting the secondary blazes
and trying to keep the situation from
spreading too far downwind.
New
streams of water hit the site of the lab
building from several angles at once,
and for the ﬁrst time the bounding
ﬂames and towering gray smoke were
supplanted by steam and a welcome
white smoke. Dortonn was breathing
but unconscious.
Jurtan Mont was
breathing as well, and his eyes were
open, but he seemed more glazed than
truly aware of his surroundings. From

the amount of blood in evidence, that
might be just as well. In tearing itself
apart, his harmonica had ripped its
way across ﬁngers and lips and -
“This time you’ve really done it, you
fool,” Jurtan’s sister, Tildamire, was
saying in a particularly hectoring tone
as she rushed toward him.
Her face,
however, was the white of a grub found
in the lightless hollow under a moss-
encrusted boulder, and her stride was
so wobbly that watching her Svin ex-
pected another comatose body to hit
the ground any instant now.
Dortonn would keep. Svin grabbed
up one of the few water barrels remain-
ing undrained from the ﬁreﬁghters’
wagon and strode toward the Monts.
Tildamire, still unaccountably on her
feet, turned her uncertain gaze on Svin,
said “What -” and then “no! -” as she
saw the barrel raised to the consider-

able height of Svin’s arms outstretched
above his body, and ﬁnally said noth-
ing more as she disappeared beneath
a cascade of water. The water scoured
across Jurtan too, or indeed princi-
pally Jurtan, washing away blood and
grime as well as the scum and stench
still remaining from his recent plunges
into his offal-laden mudbank and the
Tongue Water, which of course wasn’t
much better.
With cleanliness returned attentive-
ness. “Wow!” said Jurtan, followed im-
mediately by “Ow!” as the catalog of his
injuries descended on him at once.
“An
inspiring
performance,”
com-
mented Svin. “The danger has passed?”
“Looks that way,” said Favored-of-
the-Gods, leaning from the open hatch-
way of his once-again-landed vehicle.
“There’s still mopping up the ﬁre, but
at least I think we wiped out all the

nasty stuff.
Better keep an eye on
it just to be -” Something within his
machine began an insistent beeping
sound. Favored ducked from sight but
his voice continued,
although unin-
telligibly.
After another moment he
peeked up again long enough to say,
“Gotta run.” Then the hatch swung
back into place and the sphere wob-
bled into the air with the typical at-
tendant prodigies of brimstone-laden
vapors and strange clanking noises.
The machine swooped off down the
street, barely missing with its retract-
ing landing-gear assembly the remain-
ing Karlini retainers just now striding
up the block.
Haddo gibbered something partic-
ularly unpleasant-sounding from the
depths of his black hood, waving a
gauntleted ﬁst in the air as he did
so.
His companion, Wroclaw, merely

sighed.
“Oh, my,” he said, surveying
the scene.
They both looked about ready to keel
over themselves. Haddo broke off his
imprecations to ask the key question of
the hour. “Under control situation is?”
The dripping, hair-plastered Tildamir
was the one who answered.
She had
just decided to forgive that oaf Svin for
his water treatment, since it clearly
had done her good, not only from a
standpoint of her own level of ash
and grime, but from the way it had
cut through her total mental paraly-
sis. Being reminded of the facts of the
situation, furthermore, might make it
appropriate to have him do it again. “If
you don’t count Roni,” she said heavily,
“I guess it seems to be.”
Svin was watching Wroclaw, so he
was in position to view not only the stiff
backward snap of his head as though

he were recoiling from a sudden blow,
but the brief sharp glare he cast at
Haddo immediately afterward.
What
does he know? Svin wondered, and of
what does he accuse Haddo?
It never stopped, did it? Here they
were, gathered around a scene of devas-
tation, just beginning to acknowledge
and mourn the presumed death of one
of their number; smoke was still in the
air and blood on their faces; yet the
ﬁrst agenda item was one of suspicion
and distrust and the assumption of
some hidden plot.
But on the other hand, that was just
the way the world was.
Could Svin change things on his
own? No, he told himself, clearly not,
and the attempt would only increase
the chance of someone else coming to
grief. This was the game of civilization,
and he had already discovered that

joining it was a one-way trip.
Of course, even as a barbarian, the
freedom of the frozen steppes had been
its own illusion, he understood now,
what with Dortonn exercising domin-
ion over his people in the name of
his master Pod Dall, and Haddo and
his people plotting against Dortonn
in their turn; intrigue and subterfuge
and open warfare. That had been the
game then; that was the game now.
Only who from among them would
be left to reminisce about this install-
ment in another dozen years?

Chapter6
FRADI
HAD
RECENTLY
DIED,
which made it all the more remark-
able for him to realize that he was
once again awake. That is to say, on
the one hand he was rather surprised,
but on the other hand he was scarcely
surprised at all.
He was aware that
“recently” was a relative term under
the circumstances, but - but... wait a
minute. Something wasn’t quite right.
Something -

Something seemed awfully familiar.
If his head didn’t hurt so much Fradi
was sure he’d have no trouble remem-
bering what it was. Why bother being
resurrected if you were merely enter-
ing a life of ongoing pain? The whole
point of being born again was to leave
past baggage behind. This hadn’t hap-
pened last time; last time he’d felt -
Last time. That was it - he had been
through this before. He had died in bed
and had woken up again, the damage
of age and assorted wounds miracu-
lously healed, his thought and memory
restored, eyesight renewed and energy
invigorated. But this time... What did
he remember? There had been a ﬁre,
no, a ﬁre and a ﬁght, against that guy
Spilkas who had been pawn and tool
and then suddenly a raving menace,
who had been enough of a menace to
kill him...

Or had he? Spilkas had been about
to slice his head from his body with
that ﬂaming sword of his when the
sword had turned on its master in-
stead. Fradi’s better instincts had de-
serted him in the heat of the moment,
that’s how the trouble had started. In-
stead of abandoning the girl to her fate
and ﬂeeing, he had turned to ﬁght the
maniac Spilkas; had landed a death
blow dead center, too, only to have his
own sword lash back and then melt
over his hand.
So that was why his
hand hurt so much... But then there
had been Spilkas ﬁghting his own
weapon and going into an epileptic ﬁt,
and Fradi had taken that ﬁnal opportu-
nity to scramble out of the place before
being entombed once and for all under
a building-full of ﬁery rubble.
Out?
Yes, he remembered he had made it to
the outside wall, where he had experi-

enced a momentary collapse, but there
had been no further mortal wounds
that he could recall, nothing but the
collapse and faint...
So why had he required resurrection,
and such an inefﬁcient one as this, too?
Fradjikan opened his eyes.
Above
his head was a ceiling of cunningly
carved stone inset with patterns of
dancing light.
He was resting on
his back in a long cofﬁn-shaped basin
whose sides he could see right through.
The surroundings were familiar.
He
had been here before.
Last time,
though, he had been overtaken with
theosophical awe, for one thing.
He had also been more appropriately
dressed. Instead of the pristine robe of
his previous experience, he was wear-
ing the same torn, burned, blood- and
grime-soaked clothing that had accom-
panied him through those most recent

paroxysmal events.
Recent?
- yes,
clearly, since his clothes were even still
wet, and their odor was much too fresh
to have suffered through signiﬁcant
delay. His hand wasn’t even bandaged;
just a open mass of weeping blisters
and raw red ﬂesh and -
“It is about time you’re awake,” said
a rumbling voice.
If Fradjikan had experienced more
than his share of odd situations during
the many years of his several install-
ments of life, he had also recently
learned quite a bit more than he had
known the last time this particular
situation had arisen; enough not to
grovel beneath the shadow of gods, for
example. There would be none of that
sickly “sing your praises” or “no way
to properly show my abasement” non-
sense this time around. A politic tone
of respect, though, was mere prudence.

Fradi settled for, “Thank you for allow-
ing me the opportunity for repose.”
“Um,” the voice rumbled noncommit-
tally. Last time, this glass resurrection
chamber had lifted Fradi up of its own
accord, but then last time there had
been attendants around as well. This
time he would apparently have to do
the work himself. Fradi got his func-
tional hand behind him, a tight ﬁt in
the narrow cofﬁn, and levered himself
up, trying to catalog the condition of as
many body systems as possible during
the process.
The
familiar
steam-pillar
aspect
of his employer hovered a confusing
distance beyond the end of the bier, be-
hind it the endless steely plain. None
of it might actually be there at all,
Fradi now understood, but it was just
as well to act as though physical real-
ity was the watchword until the need

arose to prove it otherwise.
“You have been very active,” his mas-
ter continued, roiling his vapors in vig-
orous thought. “Activity, though, is not
in itself a goal, and furthermore you
have not been the only active one on
the board.”
Fradi had also learned the advisabil-
ity of making particular preparations.
Had he been searched, or had he re-
tained the amulet? “I was merely at-
tempting to carry out Your will to the
limits of my ability.”
“I
am
not
displeased
with
your
performance,” pronounced the pillar.
“Your primary target has been removed
from the scene without the need for liq-
uidation.
He may be interrogated at
leisure. This is as I willed it. But now
there is more to be done, and quickly.
There is now an opportunity for Me to
become Supreme.”

His boss did like the trappings of
ofﬁce. “Excuse me, Your Preeminence.
May I ask a boon?”
The pillar’s spinning slowed, and it
directed a not-necessarily-favorable at-
tention on him. “What do you want?”
Fradi’s hand felt as though it was
still burning, and being raked through
with steel combs for good measure; his
head was thoroughly throbbing.
“Is
there a possibility of repair?” he asked
judiciously. “I take it I have not actu-
ally been returned to life, per se, but
merely rather transported here for this
audience.”
“In the sense to which you refer, that
is true.
You could have been cloned,
I suppose, but that would have taken
much longer than we have available.
No, for now you must subsist with the
fruits of your own carelessness.”
“My effectiveness would be enhanced

with two operational hands,” Fradi
pointed out.
“The standard-bearer of
the Supreme one should be without
blemish.”
“Do you presume to instruct Me?”
the
steam-pillar
said
forebodingly.
“There are other tools available to Me.”
Fradi’s ally, the Scapula, had coun-
seled him to act preemptively if the
need became apparent.
The Scapula
had also warned him of the cardinal
signs of impending loss of favor, as
he understood them from his own re-
search. The amulet which the Scapula
had helped him develop and obtain
had indeed not left his person; it had
now made its surreptitious way into
his good hand. Fradi raised his dam-
aged hand in obeisance and lowered
his head; as good a misdirection move
as he could manage under the circum-
stances. Only how could you misdirect

omnipotence?
Except omnipotence was not one of
his patron’s virtues. Fradi’s good hand
ﬂicked, the small amulet arched incon-
spicuously across the chamber, barely
even another irrelevant mote, and en-
tered the steam cloud. The pillar made
a horrid grinding sound like a tornado
plowing suddenly into a mountain of
broken glass, stood up straight, and
then fell over stiff as a log.
Once on
its side on the endless plain, the steam
cloud unrolled itself, carpet-like, and
began dissolving quickly into the air.
Left revealed behind it writhing on
the ground was a balding man in a
cut-back tunic, short pants, and san-
dals, wearing wire-rimmed spectacles
looped over his protruding ears, and
mumbling in a voice that was the same
as the Voice of the earlier Presence
stripped back to human or even less-

than-human proportions.
Fradjikan swung himself belly-down
over the side of the glass cofﬁn and
was reaching with his feet for the ﬂoor
when a door behind the cofﬁn’s head
ﬂew open. A nimbus of golden light like
an abruptly exploding sun expanded
through the door toward him, around
him, through him.
The room reeled.
Fradi found himself lying on the ﬂoor,
limp but for an occasional spasmodic
twitch, as something seemed to be
freezing his bones from within.
His head had come to rest on one
cheek, giving his lolling eye a view be-
neath the cofﬁn and across the room
onto the endless plain.
A set of feet
came into view from the now out-of-
sight doorway and hurried quickly to-
ward the incarnate but equally supine
form of Fradi’s master. “He was more
clever than I had expected,” the owner

of the feet was calling, “and so quick!
How can I forgive myself?”
It was a voice Fradi recognized. It
was far more than a casual recognition.
He had spent hours in the presence
of that voice over the past days, plan-
ning, honing, sparring. Now the rest
of the Scapula came into view as well
as he bent over the other man.
“Ap-
palling,” Fradi’s late master croaked.
“He might have eradicated me if not
for your warning. You have nothing to
apologize for.” He coughed weakly. “I
was the fool to have doubted you. Is he
dead?”
The Scapula looked across at Fradi,
his gaze impassive. “Even now his eye
glazes over. Shall I ﬁnish the disposal
for you?”
Fradi’s ex-patron snarled without
power. “Let him lie there and putrefy,
the treacherous dog.
We have more

important matters at hand, and a visit
to conduct.”

Chapter7
“YOUR ASSOCIATE JARDIN HAS
BEEN
ATTACKED,”
Zalzyn
Shaa
said quickly to Jill-tang, hoping to get
enough words in to make her hesi-
tate before carrying through her likely
knee-jerk reaction of eradication ﬁrst,
conversation later.
“Not by me,” he
added, with even more haste.
“Attacked?” she said blankly.
The
door burst open behind Shaa, and in
one of the mirrors across the room he

could see the charging forms of some
of the priests he had just evaded com-
ing through it after his head. “Wait!”
Jill ordered, and then, “Outside!” As
they reluctantly crept back through
the doorway, Jill glanced around the
remaining group still present, wetting
her lips nervously with her tongue.
She was clearly swamped, overcome
by too many unexpected and novel sit-
uations cascading simultaneously on
her head. She was supposed to be in
the elect category of players on the
world stage, too. Of the others in the
room, the Creeping Sword didn’t seem
to be in much better shape, but then
he was an odd one; you could never tell
in exactly what shape he might really
be at a particular moment, anyway.
Only Gashanatantra, by his deliber-
ately raised eyebrow and folded-arm
posture, appeared to appreciate both

the content and the absurdity of the
situation.
Of course, as a master of
counterplots and intrigue he did have
the most practice in these things of
anyone present.
“Yes, unfortunately, but not killed, at
least not outright; he was still breath-
ing the last time I saw him,” contin-
ued Shaa.
He decided that perhaps
it might be better not to mention the
Jardin ﬁnger-amputation at quite this
point in the exposition. “I was under
duress at the moment myself, but it
did seem quite certain that his mantle
of power was also stolen at the same
time, as part of this attack.”
Jill sat down heavily.
Fortunately
a divan was a convenient distance be-
hind her knees; additional provocation
might not sit well right at the moment.
Suddenly she wheeled on the Creeping
Sword.
“You!
You almost eliminated

him once - you decided you had to
ﬁnish the job?”
The Sword was shaking his head.
“No, not me, not this one.
I haven’t
seen Jardin since the two of you left
my room. I certainly didn’t steal any-
body’s mantle of power. I mean, look at
me.”
She was looking at him. Whatever
she saw - or perhaps whatever she re-
membered - made her expression falter
in its rage and certainty, and even ac-
quire - could it be? - more than a tinge
of fear.
Gashanatantra was ignoring the en-
tire exchange as he leaned against the
mirror frame that led to the secret pas-
sage; his eye was ﬁxed only on Shaa.
“Your brother?” he stated.
“You ﬂatter me,” Shaa said, “to know
me that well by reputation. Unfortu-
nately you have the right of it.
My

brother was indeed behind this act.”
He couldn’t help feeling his back crawl
and his neck tense. This was perhaps
the moment of most extreme hazard.
Jill-tang’s attention had suddenly
returned to him; she was rising back
off her couch, her hands were coming
up.
Shaa saw the Creeping Sword
mirroring across the room his own gri-
mace and clenching of teeth. Well, if I
die now, Shaa thought, at least it may
upset Arznaak’s master plan for fullest
enjoyment. What spell-work might he
remember, after the years of enforced
retirement, that might stand a chance
of deﬂecting the forthcoming harsh
decree?
“I would not do that,” said Gashanatan
his concentrated stare now on Jill. “I
would certainly not do that at this
particular time. Whatever has passed
between us does not bear on this point.

Events are spinning too far out of con-
trol to indulge a momentary pique,
which you in any case would soon
surely regret.”
“But by his own admission this bug’s
brother -”
“He is not a bug,” Gash said pa-
tiently, as though reasoning with a
petulant child. “And he has far more
reason to see his own brother humbled
than you do.
In case it has missed
your notice, his brother is Arznaak the
Scapula. Now, Shaa -”
“Not so fast,” said Jill.
“No one in
this room will move until you tell me
why you are all here, and just what is
really going on.”
“If I may be so bold,” inserted Shaa,
“there are likely issues of some urgency
at hand. As I indicated, my brother has
assumed Jardin’s mantle of ofﬁce and
Transcended, ordering the damaged

Jardin to be dumped in a street. It oc-
curred to me that you of anyone would
want to recover him while there is hope
of restoration.”
During Shaa’s statement the color
had
drained
deﬁnitively
and
com-
pletely from Jill-tang’s face.
“Don’t
move,” she repeated. She was almost
running by the time she reached the
door,
ﬂinging it open hard enough
to knock over an adjacent knee-high
glazed pot housing a decorative ﬂower-
ing bush. Hollering for her priests, she
slammed the door shut after her.
Shaa discovered that Gashanatantra
was
again
staring
at
him,
rather
than after the departing Jill.
“Tran-
scended?” Gash questioned. “Are you
sure?”
“That was what he wanted me to be-
lieve,” said Shaa. “It was also consis-
tent with the progression of the situa-

tion as a whole. He’s not one of your
protégés, is he?”
“No,” said Gashanatantra.
“He’s a
bit too dangerous for that, like deciding
to train an asp as a house pet. It can be
done, but why bother? Is this then his
culmination? Have we seen all of his
plan, do you think?”
“Arznaak?
I doubt it.
There’s no
telling what all he has in mind, but I’d
be surprised if this was it. He might
take some time to consolidate his posi-
tion, I suppose.”
“Is that the way you’d bet?”
“Not on your life,” said Shaa, “so to
speak.
And with the Knitting cere-
mony still on for tonight - it is still on,
I assume?
- Arznaak would have an
excellent grand forum for something.
But -”
“Just a second here,” said the Creep-
ing Sword, from the reclining posi-

tion he had assumed on a comfortable-
looking settee. Judging by the careful
shallow pattern of his breathing, Shaa
thought a tentative diagnosis of bro-
ken ribs could be added to his more
visible and stigmatic other wounds. “If
my understanding of this whole thing
between Conservationist gods and Ab-
dicationists
is
up-to-date,
wouldn’t
what your brother did kick the balance
of power all to hell? And then wouldn’t
anyone going after him with the idea of
knocking him back down make things
even worse?”
“I would not put it past him to have
incorporated this into his plan.”
“It sounds like all he does all day is
lurk around and plot,” the Sword mut-
tered.
“That’s about the size of it,” Shaa
agreed. “You should have seen him as
a child.”

“No, thanks.”
“While Jill is out of the room,” said
Gashanatantra, “what is your true as-
sessment of Jardin’s present state?”
“I doubt he’ll be of any use,” Shaa
told him, “or my brother wouldn’t have
left him alive.
As you may have no-
ticed,
my brother is not exactly a
paragon of chivalry. On the other hand,
he has been known to make mistakes.
Regardless, trying to locate Jardin and
save him was an obvious path, and
even if my brother had intended I fol-
low it there were potential spinoffs he
might not have anticipated.
Finding
you so quickly, for example.”
“Finding me?” Gash repeated. “Why
would you want to do that?”
“My brother is using that ring to
power his Transcendence. You trapped
Pod Dall in the ring. You could set him
loose.”

Shaa watched Gashanatantra con-
sider him.
“Neither point is quite
that simple. It is an intriguing coun-
terstroke you present, though.
An
unleashed Pod Dall at the Scapula’s
throat would give him something to
think about.”
“And the sooner it happened the less
prepared he’d be to counteract it,” Shaa
pointed out. “If my brother hasn’t been
able to consolidate his position and se-
cure other sources of power -”
Gash raised his hand. “Enough. If
you have another point to present that
will clinch your argument, say it; if not,
be content that I take the proposal un-
der advisement.”
Shaa shrugged. “You’re the god.”
“How did you know Gash would turn
up here?” asked the Sword. “With all
the scheming he and Jill have been
aiming at each other?”

“Who knew?” Shaa said.
“It was a
reasonable possibility, that’s all. There
were six other plausible means of
reaching him.
Encountering you so
quickly was an unexpected pleasure,”
he added, directly to Gashanatantra.
“You waste your pleasantries on me,”
said Gashanatantra. “I am above ﬂat-
tery.”
“No one is above ﬂattery,” said Shaa,
“especially when it is the same as a
statement of fact.
For example, I re-
spect your prudence.”
“Prudence?”
“Prudence lies in planning ahead,”
Shaa observed.
“It appears you took
the precaution of compiling dossiers on
the players you might have reason to
encounter as long as you were involved
with our enigmatic associate here.”
“And you, I suppose, have done the
same?”

“Well, I’ve had time on my hands.
But you see, ﬂattery is a harmless par-
lor game for even the highest.
You
ﬁnd yourself doing it without half a
thought.”
With a crash, the door was ﬂung
open again,
this time encountering
the tipped-over bush and causing it to
roll slowly onto an embroidered rug,
spilling wet dirt and mulch behind it.
“I can’t detect him,” Jill said, stalking
back into the room. “He’s completely
dropped off the net. Can you do any-
thing else to ﬁnd him or do I have to
wait for my priests to spread out in the
streets?”
“As you know,” said Gashanatantra,
“I still work without an infrastructure.
You’re the one who’s been closest to
him; you would know his signature if
anyone would.
I’d scarcely have the
resolution to locate him where you

cannot.”
Jill swung around. “You,” she said,
addressing the Sword.
“You actually
are what you originally purported to be,
a detective? And nothing else?”
“Well,” said the one in question, “I
guess the answer to that is yes and
no. ‘Yes’ to the detective, ‘not exactly’
to the nothing else.
If you’re asking
me as a detective, though, I’d say the
best chance you’ve got is to turn your
forces loose and blanket the neigh-
borhood around the Scapula’s place,
or wherever else Shaa here was actu-
ally held, and hope the Scapula was
telling the truth when he said they
were just going to dump Jardin in the
street.
If you want something more
active I’d suggest a confrontation with
the Scapula himself. You’re powerful,
which Jardin was too, but you’ve been
warned, which he wasn’t, and you’re

also smarter than Jardin, too. If you’re
careful you might not have much to
worry about. Oh, and don’t even think
about the police or the civil authorities.
After all, the Scapula isn’t just some
guy, he’s some guy somewhere at the
top of their chain of command.”
“Yes,” Jill said. ‘Whatever else you
mayor may not be, you did seem to
have a reasonable claim to competence
as a detective.
I assume the answer
to what you really are, and how much
you are merely my ex-husband’s pup-
pet, lies with him.
Does it not, my
dear?”
Shaa thought the drop in tempera-
ture was not simply one of atmospher-
ics. This could be an interesting one to
witness; even more interesting if they
all survived. “I came here to mend the
fences
between
us,”
Gashanatantra
told Jill.

“I see,” she said. “And why just now,
pray tell? Just how much do you want
from me?”
Gashanatantra clearly was doing
his best not to hesitate, to project his
most forthright and agreeable persona
while banishing all thought of tricki-
ness. He’s good, Shaa observed, he is
very, very good. But then Jill-tang, as
his wife, had presumably lived with
him. Even if she’d been an idiot she’d
have had to pick up something.
“It
is true,” he said, “we have both been
the object of each other’s plots.
It is
true I have employed this singular gen-
tleman as a tool-of-opportunity in an
attempt to elude your grasp and de-
ﬂect your aim. It is true we have been
in competition for certain of the same
prizes and goals. But this sport of ours
has always been just that - a sport, a
game, a luxury. There is a time when

that is good and ﬁne, and a time when
it is merely dangerous indulgence.”
Jill glared at him.
“So what is so
different now?
This Scapula person
may be a murderous nuisance but
how extraordinary a danger could he
present?”
“The Scapula is only the latest in a
series of hazards that together have a
geometrically confounding effect. This
gentleman whom you spent no little
time with is another.”
“Him? Your puppet? Or what is he
really, your catamite?”
“That sort of remark is beneath you,”
Gash said severely. “He is a victim of
the Spell of Namelessness.”
“Is that why you made certain he’d
encounter Jardin?
To get Jardin’s
recognition of who he was?”
“That was one reason, yes.
Jardin
was - is - the leading practitioner of

that spell, after all. But not the only
one. And in fact this man’s curse was
apparently not the casting of Jardin.”
“So whose was it, since you’ve obvi-
ously taken such an interest in deter-
mining his identity?”
Gashanatantra pursed his lips.
“If
we are to believe his own testimony, the
casting was his own.”
“What do you mean?” snarled Jill.
“What the hell are you talking about?”
“You and Jardin clearly encountered
him while he was someone else, when
he struck against you. That someone
else by his own admission is Iskendar-
ian. While in that guise he told the per-
sonality present with us now that he
had cast the Spell of Namelessness on
himself and created this personality as
a concealing subterfuge. What we do
not yet know is why.”
“Anyone who would do that to them-

selves must be out of their mind.”
“That remains a distinct possibility.”
“Jardin and I felt his unleashed
power,” said Jill thoughtfully. “It was
consistent with what I’ve heard about
Iskendarian. I don’t know about this
Scapula, but this man - whoever he is
- is a clear menace. Especially if he’s
walking around as some sort of hidden
weapon from the past or part of an
ancient plot.”
“You begin to appreciate the prob-
lem.”
“And you brought him here?
He
should be destroyed - immediately!”
“You still don’t entirely see the prob-
lem. If he is Iskendarian now emerged
from the past, just how would you
propose to destroy him? And why be
precipitate? Is there a particular rea-
son he has reappeared now?
Since
his emergence - indeed in the last sev-

eral hours - we have seen a dramatic
escalation in incidents.”
“I heard,” she said. “First that squid
business on the water and now this
new report of a disturbance in the
Wraith District. Just what did the two
of you have to do with these things?”
“Why would you think I had any in-
volvement at all?” said Gashanatantra.
“I know you too well. You may recall
we were married.”
“Ah. Yes, indeed. Well, in that case,
my involvement was purely circum-
stantial.”
“Excuse me,” Shaa said. “What dis-
turbance in the Wraith District are
we discussing? I’m afraid my brother
failed to update the news while I was
in his custody.”
Gashanatantra faced him squarely.
“This man, while under the control of
Iskendarian, brutally attacked the fa-

cility of your associates, leaving the
vicinity ablaze.”
“... Is this true?” Shaa said softly.
“... Yeah,” said the Creeping Sword.
“Basically it is. Iskendarian went there
to pick up some of his old papers. When
he got there one thing led to another.”
“And casualties? Just what do you
mean, ‘one thing led to another’?”
Shaa could barely hear the man’s
voice. On the one hand that was just
as well; he didn’t want to hear this.
But hearing or not hearing wouldn’t
change the facts. And in fact the man
was talking. “Roni was there,” he was
saying, “Karlini’s wife.”
“So you - Iskendarian -”
“I was trying to ﬁght back against
him. He thought he’d erased me but I’d
woken up again. I was trying to over-
power him, hold him back, but then he
let loose with the ﬁreballs anyway and

if Gash hadn’t shown up I -”
“So you disclaim responsibility?”
“No,” the Sword said heavily. “How
can I do that? It’s my body too - if you
can say there really is any real me.”
“This scene is touching but immate-
rial,” snapped Jill. “I - where do you
think you’re going?”
Shaa paused in the opening to the
secret passage.
“While you check on
the well-being of your friend, it is only
right that I see to mine. Gashanatantra
- what was the situation when you left
Harrow Street?”
“The main building was a loss and
the conﬂagration was spreading, yet
I thought it most prudent to remove
this one quickly from the scene lest
Iskendarian use the opportunity to
reemerge.”
“You were there,” Shaa muttered.
“I’m sure you could see what needed to

be done.”
“Go now,” directed Gashanatantra,
interposing himself between Shaa and
the gesturing Jill.
In a whisper, he
added, “I will consider your idea for
action,” as Shaa set his path to follow
the footprints in the dust.

Chapter8
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME in the
past several days - Lords, no!
- the
Imperial Archivist was wondering just
what she had found herself enmeshed
within.
She was not paranoid, or de-
voted to theories of the world that
centered on conspiracies vast and ve-
nal in their scope, or on currents deep
as they were powerful and subtle as
their omniscience.
Was not?
Or had
not been?
Indeed, her attitude was

undergoing an evolution, based solely
on empiricism, that last refuge of the
bankrupt philosopher.
Empiricism
was unduly scorned for all that, Leen
had always thought.
And who could
doubt its present relevance? Short of a
vast amusement mounted for her own
mystiﬁcation and with Leen herself
as the object, and populated by a far
too expansive cast of players, no other
explanation ﬁt the observable facts.
Great doings were indeed afoot.
So why should this one small step
alone among them all be the thing that
struck her most jarringly as unnatu-
ral?
Because it was in her own backyard.
Or no, not in the backyard - in her
Archives. The whole idea of visitors in
the Archives was a perversion of her
upbringing, and now here was another
one.
She’d had more people traips-

ing through the sanctum in the last
few days than in the whole preceding
time since she’d taken over from her
grandfather.
Well, maybe not, but it
certainly felt like it.
Which was of course the leading
problem with empiricism.
The inter-
twined relationship between external
reality and its observation - meaning
of course the observer - led inevitably
to the solid knowledge that something
had happened when in fact, judged by
another observer who had no stake
in the matter, or was equipped with
merely a different vantage point, the
interpreter had created one situation
in mind where another had apparently
transpired in the empirical world of
external fact.
When gods were involved it was only
worse; part of the point of being a god
was to play tricks with causality, with

the domain of the senses, with the tan-
gle of the mind - with those very areas,
indeed, which interfered with the abil-
ity to discriminate ﬁction from truth.
When gods were involved? - gods were
always involved, one way or another.
“Um, excuse me, Madame Archivist?”
“Please don’t call me that,” Leen mut-
tered. “I’m not an ancient; you don’t
have to make me into one.”
“Excuse me,
I’m sorry,” said the
young woman at her side. Tarfon? Yes,
that was what Shaa’s contact at the
monotheist cult had called her.
Why
that fellow Aki hadn’t chosen to come
himself had struck Leen as an exam-
ple of poor judgment, to put it mildly;
this was not a situation for delegation
to an apprentice, however gifted.
A
lifetime of experience and the keenest
of honed insights were probably insuf-
ﬁcient. “This is a matter of the utmost

delicacy,” Leen had told him.
“So the affairs of the Shaas always
seem to be,” he had said, “yet with
the fullest justiﬁcation.
I do not at-
tack your assertion to lessen it, by any
means, and your request plainly hon-
ors us.
But the situation is such at
the present to demand my availability
here.” He had indicated with a gesture
of his hand the people lying in the
aisles of his cult’s sanctuary, victims of
the catastrophe at the Running of the
Squids just three short blocks away.
She had tried her trump card. “Don’t
you want to see the Archives?”
Aki’s expression was as pained as
those of the charred, crushed, tram-
pled, and doused casualties on the
ﬂoor. “Books are my life. But do I have
the right to set my preference against
these unfortunates’ need?”
“Are these your people?”

“All people are our people,” Aki had
said resolutely.
“My responsibility is
here. May I have your leave to join you
as soon as possible?”
And that had been that. After leav-
ing Shaa she had half-killed herself
to get over to the cult, too, with the
streets locked into virtual immobility
by the crush of the Knitting crowds
and by the Tongue-side congestion of
the Running and its calamitous de-
nouement.
She had been desperate
enough to consider hijacking a veloci-
pede she had seen wobbling down the
street, and had been brought up short
only by the prospect of then having
to drive it.
Instead, she had made
the journey to her brother’s, with the
hope that he might have better luck
arranging for her transportation, but
of course Lemon had been out some-
where in the mess himself.
Perhaps

he’d receive the message she’d left for
him, perhaps she’d run into him her-
self out on the streets, if synchronicity
continued operating in as hyperactive
a fashion as it had recently adopted
as its wont; perhaps all these exer-
cises would be rendered moot by some
new and even greater cataclysm, such
as perhaps the transformed Scapula
might be preparing to provide.
“What shall I call you instead, then,
ma’am?” Tarfon was asking. Deferen-
tially, but not fawningly, at least. The
girl- woman - seemed conﬁdent enough
of her abilities without being either too
arrogantly inﬂated or too apologetic.
Aki had trained her that well, anyway.
“Leen,” said Leen, “just call me that;
I don’t stand on ceremony.”
Tarfon swallowed. “Thank you, ah,
Leen. What exactly are we going to see,
ma’am?”

“If I knew exactly, we wouldn’t be go-
ing.”
Leen had been resigned to making
the long hike back from the waterfront
once again on foot, but luck incarnate
in the unlikely vehicle of a ﬁshmon-
ger’s cart unburdened by refugees had
intervened.
It had been so unbur-
dened, of course, due to the ﬁshmon-
ger’s extortionist demand for passage
fare, and to the unfortunate miasma
of seafood long gone that attracted a
hearty airborne entourage of hopeful
waterfowl and questing ﬂies. Since the
Scapula had not bothered to relieve her
of her money pouch, an accommoda-
tion based on cash was quickly struck,
hopefully to be reimbursed from the
Archival expense account, but clearly
nothing short of exorcism would sufﬁce
to banish the souls of the departed ﬁsh.
Let it be another sacriﬁce for the

cause, then, and perhaps later she’d
ﬁgure out exactly just what the cause
was.
Without even trying to hijack them
to an adverse fate the ﬁshmonger
dropped them at the palace complex
gate and drove off, happily jingling
his new stock of coins. Tarfon, a bud-
ding bibliophile herself by virtue of
her late father’s library and his own
inculcation, had of course visited the
public stacks on many occasions; Leen
vaguely recalled her presence at the
ends of aisles and deep in the dust.
Tarfon also knew - or had deduced -
enough to suspect the existence of the
concealed store of the true Archive.
Leen had already sworn her to secrecy
but the only way to enforce it without
laying a geas on her would be through
lobotomy. Certain of her predecessors
had employed both;
Leen, however,

thought methods of force a bit extreme.
They’d have to see, though. What was
that expression the ancients used? “I’ll
show you this,” Leen said, “but then I’ll
have to kill you.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Nothing, just a little bibliophilist
humor.” Leen did feel her mood dis-
proportionately
improved,
however.
They now had reached the Reading
Room’s wing. The grand entrance was
visible far down a hall at their side,
but a nearer alcove beckoned.
Like
the Archives below them, the Read-
ing Room had its back entrances. The
Scapula might have set watchers on
the obscure paths as well as anywhere,
Leen supposed, but then that was hope-
fully overkill even for him, given that
she was supposedly still under lock
and bar in the dungeon beneath his
headquarters.

This way they might also avoid the
oversight of her assistant Vellum, re-
duced in her absence to holding down
the reference desk on the Reading
Room ﬂoor. She should have probably
just closed the place down in honor
of the Knitting and today’s particular
highlight of festivities, but it was a lit-
tle late for that now. Maybe next time
around.
The staff entrance let into an ob-
scure section of the stacks not far
from the rear workroom. Even when
the Reading Room was busy, this was
scarcely a frequented area; there were
not many comparative philologists ac-
tive at the present, apparently. So - the
stacks; then, the staff area; then, the
Front Door path. “Follow closely and
step where I step,” Leen instructed.
Was it time for another bout of wish-
ful thinking?
- it was.
Very well -

hopefully the path guardians were still
giving her the leeway they’d extended
after Max’s recent shenanigans; hope-
fully they would still recognize her as
herself.
If not, this might be a very
short trip.
“Is this Creeley’s work?” asked Tar-
fon, looking around her at the simulta-
neous advancing and retreating geome-
tries the Entry Hall had been exhibit-
ing of late. “The Arch-Librarian ?”
“Yes,” said Leen, “that’s right.” Maybe
the girl really did know something.
Old librarians and the history of the
Archives were scarcely garden-variety
studies either, for anyone but their suc-
cessors, at any rate.
Creeley’s work
and the existence of the Archives were
supposed to be secret, too, but as with
so many other secrets word did seem
to get around in interested circles over
the centuries.

The guardians were still benign, still
actually helpful in places, still willing
to accept her authority and extend her
courtesies beyond that. How variable
had the guardians’ attitudes been in
the past? she wondered. Well, if she
ever had time she’d have to go back
through the journals, see if any of her
predecessors had noted mood swings of
the sort she’d been experiencing. The
priority of that research did not exactly
put it at the top of her - oh, here they
were.
Leen conducted Tarfon past her own
desk and work area down the leaning
book rows and through the maze to
the section her nephew Robin had dis-
covered, where she manipulated the
hidden mechanism beneath the lower
shelf. The familiar length of bookcase
swung open. Watching it, she realized
that she no longer got the slightest

twinge of excitement from this, any
sense of mystery having been over-
whelmed by exasperated frustration.
She had never liked puzzles that were
too obviously puzzles, either, whether
rebus or word game or odd crabbed rid-
dle, but those of course typically had
no stakes to them beyond the matter
of gain or loss of self-esteem.
For that matter, Tarfon did not act
overly impressed either, limiting her-
self to a speculative “Hmm” and a brief
query about whether this kind of thing
was
characteristic
of
the
Archives,
which indeed it was not. At the base of
the tight circular stair, she examined
the metal walls, the window of thick
smoked glass, now lacking any light or
motion behind it, and the overall ambi-
ence of the hidden room, then listened
to Leen’s brief history of the discov-
ery of the enigma. “It spoke?” Tarfon

repeated.
“Brieﬂy,” Leen said. “It didn’t use a
language I knew.”
Tarfon looked speculatively at her.
“Someone spoke to it ﬁrst?”
“That’s right.”
“Did this person die in the attempt.”
“No,” Leen told her.
“The thing
hasn’t done anything hostile, just anti-
social.”
“Okay,” said Tarfon. “Let’s give it a
try.”
Leen recognized six of the ﬁrst ten
languages Tarfon ventured, then lost
her way almost completely after that.
Perhaps Aki had selected a qualiﬁed
deputy after all, whatever her age. But
perhaps the problem was just not solv-
able, at least by them, at least not by
anyone other than whoever had set -
wait a second. “That last one - that’s
the same language Max used,” Leen

said.
“Max?” said Tarfon.
“Maximillian
the Vaguely Disreputable?
He’s been
here and he couldn’t decipher this? He
was one of the people who taught me.
If he couldn’t -”
“When Max was here he was in a
hurry.
His attention was on other
things.”
“Why not bring him back?”
“He’s in a dungeon.”
Tarfon drew away.
“I didn’t put him there,” Leen said.
Since leaving Shaa she had also taken
the time to determine Max’s situation.
As the architecture of the palace com-
plex went, he was probably not that far
from this location, physically, but from
the standpoint of access he might as
well have been on the moon. Although
-
But she had promised Shaa.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Tarfon
wanted to know.
“What did Max do?
Is anyone trying to get him out? Why
aren’t you -”
“Dr.
Shaa said he would handle
things,” Leen stated, which of course
was not quite what he had said but
which would hopefully close out this
argument. “Can we get on with this?”
It would be nice to realize more from
this session than the already-clear fact
that Max certainly did get around.
“Well,” Tarfon said reluctantly, “if
that last one was the language Max
tried and got results with, I don’t know
that there’s much point in continu-
ing to try other ones. I’m pretty well
tapped out on spoken tongues, anyway.
How about this -is there anything like
a keyboard around? You know, ancient
rectangular device that sits on a table,
with letters that you press to spell out

words?”
Leen’s mouth dropped. Why hadn’t
she thought of that? “Wait here,” she
told Tarfon, trotting up the stairs. Now
where had she last seen that thing? It
hadn’t been very long...
in fact, now
that she thought about it, she had
found the device buried in its crate of
junk and had cleaned it of the grime of
ages years before, after her accession,
when she had still had the thought
of tidying up the place and putting
things in some proper order, but then
had stumbled across it again still on its
same shelf with her same identifying
tag only a few weeks ago. Had stum-
bled across it, and had played around
with it, too...
and then it had been
less than a week later that Robin had
wandered down one particular aisle
and brought the hidden room to light.
In this time of revealed synchronicity,

was there any reason not to presume
there might be a connection?
She hoped she hadn’t just left the
thing lying around someplace for any-
one to pick up.
But no, here it was, a platinum-
colored plastic box the length of her
forearm, inset with ﬁfty or sixty cun-
ningly fashioned ﬁngertip-sized blocks
bearing black letter-legends.
Leen
hefted it carefully and headed back to
the secret room.
“So this is what they look like,” Tar-
fon murmured, holding the thing gin-
gerly at half-arm’s length. “You read
about something you think can’t possi-
bly exist, and then there it is.” Now she
was studying the back, then the ends.
“There’s no cable. How do we plug it
in?”
“Why not just try it?” suggested
Leen. “The machine in the wall spoke;

perhaps this keyboard will talk to
it for us.” Tarfon looked around for
a surface to place the keyboard on,
then shrugged, sank to the ﬂoor cross-
legged, and rested it on her knees
facing the wall of the oracle.
“These
letters on the keys are from the same
script system as that language you
said Max used. It was very common;
I’m surprised you don’t have anything
on it here.”
“I’m sure we do,” said Leen.
“The
question is ﬁnding it, and ﬁnding the
time to ﬁnd it.” Actually, Leen did
know the script system, she just wasn’t
ﬂuent in the language. “What are you
waiting for?”
“... Nothing but nerves, I guess. Let’s
see ...” Tarfon hunted across the board,
then tapped a key. “Hey, look at that.”
Deep in the wall behind the murky
window, the letter she had typed had

appeared, a brightly glowing green.
As she continued to type, the new let-
ters sprung into life next to the ﬁrst,
spilling their way off to the side. “What
are you telling it?”
“If this is a computer, supposedly
they required very speciﬁc rituals,”
said Tarfon. “Plus identiﬁcation codes,
passwords - see, look, now it’s asking
who we are.” Another line of characters
had appeared beneath the one she had
created. “Who do we tell it we are?”
Who would have? - “Try Byron.”
“Byron?” The name didn’t seem to
mean anything to her. “Okay, I think
this would be how it’s spelled ... “ Tap
tap tap, tap, tap.
“Now what?”
“It wants our password.”
“Does that mean it recognizes the
name?”
Tarfon furrowed her brow. “It could

be waiting until it has both the name
and the password before analyzing
them together, to keep from giving us
any hints...
You know, based on how
you describe it behaving before, if we
give it incorrect information now it’s
possible it would lock us out again.”
“Can we go back and start over?”
“Let’s see...
okay, who are we this
time?”
“Um... Imperial Archivist? Can’t we
just be a browser? A visitor?”
Taptaptaptaptap.
“Hmm.
‘Guest
access not’, uh, ‘authorized.’” Tarfon
shrugged. “Let’s try Imperial Archivist.
What do we have to lose?”
Leen, who had a pretty good idea of
what they might stand to lose if the
thing turned out to be as deadly as the
other Archival snares, said nothing.
She did, however, hold her breath.
Tarfon looked up.
“It wants to see

your sigil. Uh, do you have a sigil?”
Her predecessors had used to ﬂaunt
one, in the old days. Now it was just
part of the accumulated lore.
Where
might her grandfather have stashed
the thing? “Hang on again,” Leen said.
“I’ll be right back.”
A nasty thought occurred to her as
she scurried off toward her desk. What
if Max had stolen that, too? He’d ad-
mitted to the theft of his amulet, the
one that gave him some resistance to
acts of gods, but what if he hadn’t ex-
actly been telling her quite the whole
truth? Had she ever seen the sigil of
ofﬁce during her own tenure?
Then Leen had reached her work
area.
She’d pretty much cleaned out
the big desk. She’d never cared much
for the credenza, though... but hadn’t
her grandfather used that as a dump-
ing ground for all kinds of junk? She

yanked open a drawer, took a deep
breath, and began to dig.
Where did all this stuff come from?
There must be trash here back to Cree-
ley. If - wait. She pulled free a small
mahogany box inlaid with ivory and
popped the catch. Inside lay a signet
ring inscribed with ﬁne tight runes.
Not just runes - the intertwined ﬁrst
characters from a score of major classi-
cal alphabets. Leen clutched it in her
hand - it was too large for any single
ﬁnger - and ran back toward the secret
room.
“Is it still waiting?” she called ahead
of her, down the steps.
“It’s more patient that I am,” Tarfon
told her. “Did you ﬁnd it?”
“Here,” said Leen, sliding to a stop at
the bottom of the staircase. “What do I
do with it?”
“Hold it up to the screen, I suppose.

Here - wait. I guess it’s already seen
it.”
“Why?”
“Look what it’s saying - ‘Librarian ac-
cess authorized.’”

Chapter9
“WE’RE ON THE WAY to see the Pro-
tector of Nature, right?”
Gash actually stumbled as he glanced
over at me. “Why do you think that?”
While Gash had been working on
his ex-wife Jill,
trying to convince
her in the tradition of professional
skullduggery to look past the multi-
level vendetta they had been pursuing
against each other since their breakup
and see her way to a current modus

vivendi,
I had been thinking hard
about the larger state of the game
board. Protector of Nature had offered
to make me head of her cabal if Max
was removed from the scene, but of
course she’d thought I was really Gash.
Or had she? “With the way things are
going,” I said with conscious disingenu-
ity, “if you don’t take Protector of Na-
ture up fast on that deal everything’ll
be off.
I know you were interested,
not that I’m entirely sure why. You’ve
never shown me any sign you wanted
to run anything openly.
Behind the
scenes, that’s where you like to hang
out, right? If anything, it’d only make
you a target for Arznaak.” On the other
hand, it might make Gash someone the
Scapula could cut a deal with.
“The bunch of you have the Scapula
seriously overrated,” Gash said, resum-
ing his stride away from Jill’s temple

down the Boulevard of Gods to wher-
ever else he was leading me, but not
addressing the real issue on the table.
“When a mortal Transcends, they are
quite fragile until they comprehend all
the workings of their new state. Not
only the powers of the ofﬁce, the web of
relationships into which they must ﬁt.
These things cannot be appreciated in
a mere few hours. Even if the Scapula
is a prodigy, there would be nothing
to fear for several days, and even then
nothing more than would be the case
with another existing god.”
“You’re the expert.”
He
cast
another
quick,
sidelong
glance at me, but this time retained
his footing.
“Besides,” he said, “if he
becomes a problem I can always throw
you at him, can’t I?”
“You actually made a joke,” I said.
“I don’t believe it. Unless it wasn’t a

joke.” Great. But then if I had a fate
in store, why not that one? At least I
could go out doing some good for some-
body over something. I liked Shaa; I
wouldn’t mind turning him a last ﬁnal
favor.
Maybe then Shaa would put
in a positive word for me with Kar-
lini; perhaps he could rehabilitate my
posthumous memory if nothing else. I
genuinely believe that the thought of
what the Great Karlini would do when
he discovered I had murdered his wife
had not yet fully occurred to me until
then. That may have been due, how-
ever, to the fact that I kept shying
away from the whole topic. It was just
too big for me to encompass. Too big
and too nasty. I kept ﬁnding myself re-
plumbing the depths of “what’s worse”
- was it worse to have your memory
and personality stolen or to ﬁnd out
they’d never been there at all, that

your entire existence was a fake? - was
it worse to know you’d already killed
one friend without knowing it was com-
ing, or to wait for it to happen again
on a larger scale, knowing there might
be even less you could do to stop it the
next time around? - and so forth.
Oh, my.
But what choices did I have?
I
needed more options than the ones
I’d been working with, that was clear. I
couldn’t just keep running around this
way indeﬁnitely. My cracked ribs were
letting loose a constant patter of pain,
and I hadn’t been able to take a good
deep breath since I’d woken up, and
then of course my whole body felt like
I’d been wrestling with a squid, but if
I tried to rest and fell asleep who was
to say Iskendarian wouldn’t take the
opportunity to spring to life again and
take charge?

Well, at least I’d survived my latest
encounter with Jill. All things consid-
ered she’d accepted the fact that all
her past experience with me was a
matter of mistaken identity, but then
she was being hit by so many other
new developments at the same time
I showed up I could understand if I
wasn’t the exactly the highest priority
question on her mind. Gash had run
interference for me with her, which
was only fair since my problem with
her had been created by him in the
ﬁrst place, but that wasn’t to say that
she still wouldn’t strike back at him
by swatting his pawn, me, especially
since I’d now been revealed to lack
Gash’s deterrent power after all.
Of
course, I had Iskendarian’s deterrent
now instead, which seemed at least
an even trade. “So do you think your
wife’s actually going to help?” I asked.

“What do you need her for anyway?
Or is it just that you don’t want her
activities distracting you right at the
moment?”
“I realize your experiences with her
may not have left you with a particu-
larly positive impression,” said Gash,
“but she does have resources and in-
frastructure where I do not. Also, our
differences are too well known for oth-
ers to give credence to the idea we
might collaborate again.”
“You don’t actually intend to trust
her, do you?”
“Jill is actually quite dependable, for
one of us, and she also has her prin-
ciples.
You always know where you
stand with Jill.”
Was Gash actually getting a bit
dewy-eyed? Or was that only the mist
of remembrance of good times past?
“Why did you break up?”

“Why do you think? She got tired of
me being me.”
“She didn’t try to slide a knife in
your back or something, did she?”
“You have spent time with her, haven’
you.” Gash fell silent for a moment.
“Well, yes.
But I wouldn’t have been
interested in her without an edge. It’s
not as though either of us were known
for laying waste to regions.”
“Right,” I told him. “Good compari-
son. From the interpersonal to the cos-
mic. Great way to show your human-
ity.”
“It’s certainly more humanity than
Iskendarian was known for.
He did
like to lay waste to regions.”
“Thanks a lot. I guess your lot isn’t
exactly a paragon of humane expres-
sion, but then my alter ego obviously
wasn’t, either. We make a great team,
don’t we, buddy-buddy and all that.

Why are you looking at me that way?”
Gash had edged away. His gaze was
narrow and focussed beneath a fur-
rowed brow. “... No,” he said. “From
the manner of your speech I was con-
cerned that Iskendarian was emerging
again. But no.”
“Well, that’s a relief. Where’s Byron
when you need him, right?”
“Byron? Why do you bring him up?
He must be considered a phantasm, at
best.”
“His name seems so thoroughly un-
mentionable among the gods that he
must have done something right. How
well did you actually know him?”
Gash threaded his way across the
crowded boulevard in mid-block. God
or not, his boots and trousers were
still splattered with mud and road dirt,
and trafﬁc didn’t automatically part
before him by mere force of his radiat-

ing divinity. Well, I’d already seen that
the perks of godhood were overrated.
“I never knew him personally,” Gash
said, once we had gained the relative
quiet of the opposite curb.
“He was
in a way my patron, but the relation-
ship was no closer than arm’s length.
You might think of it as a scholarship
arrangement more than one of hands-
on mentoring. By the time I entered
the scene Byron had drawn inwards,
become a thorough recluse.”
“I understand Phlinn Arol knew By-
ron.”
“... Yes, that’s most likely the case.
Have you discussed it with him?”
“I couldn’t make him sit still long
enough.”
“Perhaps I should apply my inﬂu-
ence,” Gash mused. “What tales have
you heard about Byron?”
“He ﬁgured out whatever it was that

made you all gods. Then he had second
thoughts about the whole thing and got
purged for it.”
Gash took a few steps in silent re-
ﬂection. “As I told you I was not there
at the ﬁrst,” he repeated eventually. “I
came in not long afterward, after the
Dislocation, true, but that was still a
time when so much was in ﬂux, when
already the accounts of the formation
were being revised, recast into myth.
Nevertheless, in the true story behind
all the propaganda, I believe Byron
was duped.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Byron was a technologist, a very
clever one, but not as suspicious as
he should have been then, or as he
seems to have become later. It was a
much different world, in many ways,
but some things have always been the
same.
Beings with intelligence will

always scheme and plot against each
other, and take advantage and lay
traps and double-cross their friends.
Perhaps Byron naively thought he was
too important, or that his associates
had only high thoughts and good will.
Perhaps he believed that he was only
conducting an experiment, an intellec-
tual exercise, when in fact his asso-
ciates had all along planned to take his
work and let it loose upon the world.”
My ﬁrst thought was to wonder how
anybody could have been so stupid, but
almost as quickly as that thought had
appeared I realized I knew plenty of
cases where such stupidity had been
the order of the day, and more than
a few where the idiot in question had
been me.
At least I’d never been in-
volved in anything with such long-
range consequences.
“What kind of
technology are we talking about here?

Not the same sort of thing as steam en-
gines or light bulbs or printing presses,
obviously.”
“Cells,” said Gash.
“Microscopic
organisms.
Direct manipulation of
molecules and atoms, that was the sub-
strate. Byron wrote the ﬁrmware and
the operating system and the major
application programming.”
“Say what?” It sure sounded like
magic to me.
I’d never heard any-
thing of the sort before. Except... on
some level I thought I might actually
know what he was talking about, even
though his words had so little mean-
ing to me he might as well have been
speaking some extinct language used
only by clams.
“What are you trying
to do, interest Iskendarian enough to
wake him up?”
“Is that what was happening?” he
said nervously.

“I thought for a second there he
might be stirring, when what you said
started to make some sense.”
“Hmm,” said Gash. “Perhaps if you
work carefully at it you can again tap
into Iskendarian’s knowledge without
rousing his consciousness;
perhaps
that is what you were observing.”
“If you say so,” I said dubiously. “But
how does this organism and atom stuff
relate to magic? Other than sounding
like magic all by itself.”
“The idea of magic had been around
for ages, of course, as something out
of superstition and legend reduced ﬁ-
nally to cheap popular ﬁction.
Over
all that time did it have observable
reality in veriﬁable fact? No, it did not.
But advanced technology is a clever
chameleon.”
“You mean Byron ﬁgured out how to
use this technology to simulate magic?”

“The argument is more subtle than
that. If you can simulate something so
closely that the details all match and
performance is the same, then have
you not created the thing itself?”
Rhetoric be damned, all that matters
is the result? But rhetoric be damned -
none of this lecture was giving me any
more of the facts I really might need
to know. “Whatever,” I said. “You say
you weren’t around when all this actu-
ally happened, so who was? Are any
of these associates of Byron still on the
scene?”
Gash looked up speculatively at the
sky. “Turke was the ﬁrst to go, along
with Ram Chandrasingh. Byron’s clos-
est partner - and the one whose clear
betrayal may have ﬁnally opened his
eyes - was Gold. Typically for your own
experiences as a detective, Gold may
have also been his lover.

She - well, as is the case with so
many of us, her fate is obscure.”
“Did Byron kill her?”
“That is one possibility.
She cer-
tainly has not been seen or her pres-
ence felt in...
oh, a very long time.
But Byron was never known for blood-
thirstiness,
or even that particular
inclination toward violence which so
many of us demonstrate.
Cunning,
and elliptical long-range plans, were
his characteristics; after he decided to
broaden himself beyond his tinkering,
that is. He was rather an inspiration
to me, you know.”
“Sounds like you were interested
enough in him to make quite a study.”
“Byron left more than his share of
secrets. And do we not each of us seek
to understand our origins? As I men-
tioned, I am what I am through the
agency of his intervention.”

“What would you do if he showed up
again, now, then?”
Gash looked off into the distance.
“Try to convince him I could be a valu-
able ally. Demonstrate to him that my
goals and his are largely congruent.
That is, assuming his goals are still
the same.”
“I’ll have to keep that in mind in case
I run into him.”
“Yes, I would appreciate that.”
Was that remark really intended to
be serious? Well, the way things were
going I suppose I did have as much of
a chance of encountering Byron as any
of them did, especially considering the
number of odd characters who’d been
crossing my path or downright seeking
me out. Although - “Did Iskendarian
know him?”
“Circumstantial evidence suggests
it.
After all, Iskendarian did build

on and extend certain concepts Byron
was known to have under development.
Some say Iskendarian was his appren-
tice, although that could have just
been Iskendarian’s own propaganda
talking.”
“But you think if Byron returned
he might be able to settle things?
Straighten out whatever stuff is go-
ing on?”
“Almost assuredly.”
“Does that mean you’ve been tak-
ing all this interest in me because you
think I might be able to help lead to
Byron? Or that Iskendarian might?”
“Iskendarian is a public hazard,” he
temporized.
“But you’re not exactly the most
public-spirited guy I’ve met, now ad-
mit it. Did you think that taking care
of Iskendarian would help you con-
vince Byron you did have the greater

good in mind?”
“There is nothing necessarily prepos-
terous in that reasoning.”
“It all sounds like pretty much of a
longshot to me.”
“Longshots are not preposterous,”
Gash said. “Merely unlikely.”
“And when they pay off you’re a ge-
nius. So do you want me to try to wake
Iskendarian up and ask him?”
“That would seem unwise.”
“Well,
thank you very much for
that, anyway.” If Iskendarian came
out again I wasn’t sure there would be
any way to put him back.
And if he
came out I had a pretty good idea who
he was going to be maddest at ﬁrst.
But there was something else ma-
jor still hanging. “You never ﬁnished
telling me who of Byron’s old pals
are still walking around. What about
Phlinn Arol?”

“I don’t know how far Phlinn goes
back; his origins are also enigmatic.
He has been willing to talk about By-
ron, and it also appears to be true
that they were on cordial terms. With-
out knowing the circumstances under
which they parted, though, one has to
be aware that the true story may be
more complicated.
Byron did vanish,
we know that. Did Phlinn play a role
in that development? Is his talk about
Byron now a cover for his own partic-
ipation in his friend’s disappearance?
Did Byron evaporate to escape Phlinn,
and is Phlinn now casting forth to get
him in his net? You can see he must be
approached with caution.”
I’d been led to believe Jardin had
gotten rid of Byron, but why should
that story be any more accurate than
this?
The different accounts weren’t
necessarily in conﬂict, either.
“Have

you already approached him?”
“In fact, I have. He was inscrutable.
Have you?”
“I -” Gash was right; there had been
something very odd about my last
meeting with Phlinn Arol, when he
had appeared in my room at the Ad-
venturers’ Club. We had been talking,
and then he had appeared to suddenly
notice something that made him ner-
vous - quite nervous, and ﬂustered too
- and then he’d skedaddled so quickly
he’d almost fallen over himself in his
haste to get away.
For that matter,
the ﬁrst time we’d met he’d brought
up Byron himself, and out of the blue
too. Some of his various remarks could
have been considered to mean that he
already knew who I really was, or had
a pretty good idea. If -
“What
are
you
thinking?”
Gash
asked carefully.

I didn’t know if I should be telling
him. On the other hand, what choice
did I really have? “Phlinn also thought
I could lead him to Byron.
Then he
saw Iskendarian start to emerge and
got scared - panicked, really - and
bugged out as fast as he could.” ‘I’m on
your side,’ Phlinn had said at the end,
but he’d sounded particularly plaintive
at the time, as though he was cast-
ing an especially hopeless defense on
the waters.
He’d acted like someone
scrambling to get out of the way of a
lunging sword point.
“He said some-
thing strange about broccoli, too,” I
mumbled.
“Broccoli?”
“He was starting off with some
pretty scatterbrained talk;
he was
probably trying to ﬁgure out how to
lead up to the Byron stuff. I mentioned
that I hated broccoli and he said he

used to know someone who hated broc-
coli. That kind of thing.” Had that been
exactly what Phlinn had said? There
might have been more... But why was
I wasting effort even thinking about
broccoli at a time like this? “I wonder
what his history with Iskendarian was.
I have a feeling we should put Phlinn
Arol on our itinerary. Deﬁnitely.”
“There are dangers.”
“So you said. But there’re also dan-
gers in not going to see him.
There
are dangers just being alive and awake;
look at me. If Byron’s the guy who can
deal with Iskendarian once and for all
I want to get my hands on him as soon
as I can.”
That wasn’t necessarily the whole
truth, but it was as much as I wanted
to reveal to Gash.
I didn’t entirely
know just what to make of this By-
ron connection.
On the one hand, if

I took what Gash said at face value,
Byron could represent some measure
of redemption to me. If Byron was the
key to solving some part of the mess
of the world, and if Iskendarian was
the key to Byron, and if I was the key
to worming the relevant information
from Iskendarian without letting him
loose again, then I could get the fear
of Iskendarian off my back and help
society at the same time.
On the other hand, it was a risky en-
terprise to take anything Gash said at
face value.
But even if Byron wasn’t the hope of
the world, everything I’d heard about
him did imply he might very well be
wizard enough to be able to expunge
Iskendarian. If he was alive, and if he
could be reached, and if he was inter-
ested, and if he wasn’t really aligned
with Iskendarian himself in the same

strange plot, and if Byron wasn’t ac-
tually even more unpleasant than Isk-
endarian to boot. That was a lot of con-
ditional modiﬁers.
Of course, the status quo hadn’t ex-
actly been breaking in my direction
lately, either.
Yet this line of reasoning rested
unpleasantly-much on the words of
Gashanatantra. That brought up the
question that had been dogging my
thoughts to an omnipresent extent
these last few days - how much of what
Gash had said was really the truth?
If I thought of any options better
than stringing along with him maybe
I’d ask him then. “What we’re getting
back to is that Iskendarian may be the
key,” I temporized.
“A key, yes, indeed.”
“So what are we doing spending the
time visiting Protector of Nature?”

“There is more than just one lock in-
volved. This way - I know the secret
path to the Sacred Grove.”
We had arrived at a large block
set in the middle of the Boulevard of
Gods - literally in the middle, with the
road peeling off to encircle it in a long
sweeping detour on both sides.
The
block was occupied by a park. Actually,
“park” would be only the most minimal
word to describe it. Beyond a low wall
separating it from the bustle of trafﬁc
stretched a broad greensward dotted
with the occasional thicket or copse;
here a meandering stream, there a
small pond half-choked with marsh
grass. There were no pathways, only
the luxuriant lawn and rolling mead-
ows.
Gash led me into a ﬁeld of what
looked like wild wheat that started out
knee-high, then mounted slowly to my

chest before bounding suddenly to a
level a good two feet above my head.
When we emerged from the grain we
were abruptly in the midst of a dense
wood,
fully equipped with clinging
mists, dangling creepers, carpets of
pine needles and decaying mulch, and
heaven-scraping trees.
Birds called
exotically overhead, animals slunk in
the underbrush. I wanted to ask Gash
if we’d have to climb but I didn’t really
want to hear the answer.
Instead, I
followed him along a ridgeline that re-
vealed itself two hundred feet further
along to be the broken-backed remnant
of an ancient fallen trunk, food now for
a whole new linear grove whose mem-
bers had to be themselves a hundred
feet tall apiece.
Then the trees parted suddenly.
I
had been hearing the mufﬂed roar of
untamed water for some time in the

forest, but had no idea if the source
was near or far, rapids or channel, or
whether it was all just another trick of
environment sorcery.
I had certainly
not expected the cataract that con-
fronted us now, free-falling down the
face of a cliff that dwarfed the trees
that lay just behind us, at the top a
smooth curve of glass, at the bottom a
jumbled cauldron of thundering white
and a mass of boulders, a small still
pool, and an echoing subterranean exit
that drained the torrent as quickly as
it descended.
A symmetric rainbow
crowned the mist and framed the top
of the waterfall and the summit of the
peak above it. “We should have seen
this from the street,” I said.
“Why
didn’t we see this from the street? This
mountain has to be the tallest thing in
the city.”
Gash shrugged. “She’s a god.”

“Well, is that thing just there for
decor or are we supposed to get our-
selves to the top?”
“We are scarcely run-of-the-mill sup-
plicants.”
“That’s something, I guess, but what
if she’s not around? We didn’t exactly
bring camping supplies.”
“Oh, she’s around, all right.
She
does split consciousness better than
anyone.”
He looked around, then raised his
voice. “Clara? Where are you?”
A cloud passed overhead, a dark
cloud, casting the clearing and the
base of the waterfall into deep shadow.
Thunder rolled. “She’s just keeping us
entertained,” Gash said, I thought a
triﬂe uncertainly.
“Fine,” I told him, “but if we start
taking lightning bolts I’m getting out
of here.”

He opened his mouth to respond - in
fact, he might have actually said some-
thing that was lost behind the latest
peal from the heavens - and we’d just
begun to receive the ﬁrst pelt of hail
when the noise level dropped abruptly.
It took me a moment to identify the
fact that the waterfall had shut itself
off.
The last cascade of falling water
hit the pool and as the spray and mist
cleared a grotto in the cliff face became
visible, along with a path of stepping
stones and slick sections of ledge skirt-
ing the back edge of the lagoon. “You
see?” Gash said.
What I saw didn’t necessarily make
me any happier, but then pursuit of
my happiness was not exactly what
had brought us here. I followed Gash
along the trail, trying not to slip badly
enough to slide off into the water, since
it had occurred to me that nature

clearly included carnivorous ﬁsh, and
then entered through the mouth of the
grotto into a hollowed cavern festooned
with stalagmites and stalactites and
the other traditional furnishings of
natural limestone caves. Hidden light-
ing in bold colors cast the shadows of
the pillars into eerie relief. By now I
was half-expecting one of the pillars
to writhe around and transform itself
into our hostess, but instead there she
suddenly was, in the same normal hu-
man form I’d last seen her wear in the
street next to the Scapula’s headquar-
ters, stepping like a normal human
out from behind an outcropping of rock.
“Gashanatantra. What a surprise,” she
said, not sounding surprised at all.
“Clara,” Gash responded.
“A plea-
sure, as always,” he proceeded, un-
derlining the fact that she had not
referred to her own surprise as pleas-

ant.
“Nice of you to bring the family,” said
Protector of Nature.
“You refer to my associate, and occa-
sional surrogate? If we are to be col-
leagues, it is only appropriate to con-
duct our affairs in an open and above-
board fashion.”
‘Associate,’ was it?
It sounded like
I’d just received a promotion.
Next
he’d be saying the whole thing had re-
ally been my idea. “Yeah, right,” Clara
told him, which is about what I’d have
said too at the moment if anyone had
asked me for a comment.
“Have you
been power-sharing with this guy or is
he some long-lost cousin? I don’t like
being fooled, you know.”
“You approached him, I believe, and
requested no validation.”
“That’s right. I approached him. So
why are you speaking?
Why are you

even here?”
Enough of this. “I wasn’t interested
in your offer,” I said. “I thought Gash
would be, so I told him about it.
I
thought he was probably the one you
intended your message to reach, any-
way.”
“Yes,” said Gash. “I understood there
was a bounty out for the elimination
as an active force of Maximillian the
Vaguely Disreputable; it was a ques-
tion of determining who was offering it.
I have now decided to collect.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Since we have removed from the
scene Maximillian the Vaguely Disrep-
utable -”
“You?” she said. She began to smile.
It was not the sort of smile you saw
when someone was sharing a laugh
with you. It was the sort of expression
you saw when the joke was on you, and

the punch line had claws. “That’s not
the way I hear it. Tell me then, how
did you accomplish this task?”
I wanted to tell him to shut up.
I
didn’t like to see us getting deeper into
something that already clearly wasn’t
good. And us in her territory, too. “The
question of Maximillian is scarcely the
point,” Gash said instead. “My arrange-
ment with my associate is not the point
either. The key is that you came look-
ing for me, as indeed you should have.
Who would be a better candidate for
what you are considering?”
At the moment, Protector of Nature
was reminding me quite a lot of Jill.
But then that’s the way Gash had said
he liked women, hadn’t he? - predatory
and sharp, like him. “Him,” she said.
For a moment I thought she might
still mean me.
Then two new men
strolled out from behind the rock.

“You’re keeping interesting company,” I
said to the ﬁrst one.
“As are you,” said Arznaak,
the
Scapula.
“I hear you’ve been coming up in the
world.”
“That is the way of it,” he agreed.
“As you can see,” said Protector of
Nature gratuitously, “the position is
ﬁlled. If you’d still like to enlist in the
cause there may be something we can
ﬁnd for you to do. Either one of you,”
she added, examining me carefully, ob-
viously trying to decide where I ﬁt into
all this.
“And you, Vladimir,” Gash said to the
other man. “Suffered some recent re-
verse, I see? How unfortunate. Have
you met the Lord of Storms?” he asked
me.
“Haven’t had the pleasure,” I said.
“Charmed.” The Lord of Storms looked

to have been bald even before he’d been
caught in whatever ﬂensing spell had
drained him of enough weight to make
his skin hang loose and baggy, at least
in the sections that weren’t ﬂaking off
in eczematous clumps, and had made
the residual hair in his eyebrows and
over his ears ﬂutter loose in thin white
tufts now littered across his shoulders
and face.
One lens of his gold wire-
rimmed spectacles was fractured and
the twisted frame made the bridge
aim itself strongly downhill toward
the right. If this guy was in charge of
storms the continent had better get set
for a major drought.
“Of course Vladimir was always one
for a winning team,” Gash continued.
“You are certain you’ve picked right
this time, aren’t you?”
The Lord of Storms drew himself up.
“I can’t guess what you’re referring to.”

“I’m sure you know best,” said Gash
solicitously.
“Although don’t I recall
you and Clara in opposition -”
“Do you join us?” Protector of Nature
repeated.
“The common hazard men-
aces you as much as anyone.”
“These are weighty decisions,” Gash
said easily. “Will you be making a for-
mal presentation?”
“Of course,” said the Scapula. “Tra-
dition is important.”
“You’ve been off the net,” Protector
of Nature said. “Will you attend any-
way?”
“Why not?” said Gash.
“And your friend?” added the Scapula
“Who can say? Why not ask him.”
“I’ll think about it,” I said, “see if I
can work it into my schedule. Sounds
like it would be a shame to miss.”
“Just so,” said the Scapula.
“By the way,” Gash said to the

Scapula, as though he was just think-
ing of it for the ﬁrst time, “as our
newest colleague, have you aligned
yourself with Conservation or Abdica-
tion?”
“That should be obvious.
Do you
think I’d go to quite a lot of trouble to
obtain power only to throw it away?”
“That rhetorical statement could ap-
ply to any of us, those advocating Abdi-
cation included.”
“I am here for the concrete exercise
of power,” declaimed the Scapula pre-
cisely, “not an experiment in social jus-
tice.”
“Yes, that certainly clariﬁes it. Well,
I will look forward to your procla-
mation.
I assume that will occur
promptly?”
Arznaak and Protector of Nature ex-
changed glances.
It was Protector of
Nature who nodded once at him, then

answered. “Yes, of course. The commu-
nity will be gathered for the Knitting;
the occasion is already auspicious. Per-
haps you’d choose to wait here for it.”
I thought this might be a good time
to heft Monoch, so I did. Even in his
walking stick concealment, he emitted
enough of a low power hum to cause
the eyes of the three folks opposite us
to ﬂick toward him, then up at me, then
back at Gash. “As my associate men-
tioned,” he stated, “our schedule is de-
manding. So perhaps we will now leave
you to your preparations.”
Several minutes later,
after we’d
recrossed the pool, just ahead of the
reactivation of the waterfall, and were
tromping again through the forest, I
said, “Are we lucky they let us leave?”
“Yes,” said Gashanatantra.
“Dr.
Shaa is correct.
That individual is
dangerous. As is Clara. Vladimir is a

dope but he has an instinct for advan-
tageous alliance.”
“At least we didn’t tell them who I
was.”
“Yes...” he said thoughtfully.
“Al-
though I still wonder what they might
know.”
“Maybe you’ll end up allied to them
and then you can ﬁnd out.”
Gash didn’t say anything to that. In
its way, that may have been the most
unnerving thing that had happened to
me all day.

Chapter10
IT HAD BEEN SOMETHING OF A
TOSS-UP. If the damage at the Kar-
lini lab had been as extensive as the
Creeping Sword had described, though,
amounting to total devastation, then
their backup plan would have gone
into effect. Accordingly, Shaa eyed the
front door of his ﬂat one ﬁnal time and
inserted his key in the lock.
He had apparently guessed right,
Shaa thought sourly.
Seated on a

chair in the entry hall, sword at the
ready though resting across his knees,
relaxed in posture but with the same
coiled-spring tautness he always sported
even during his rare episodes of being
either drunk or asleep, was Svin the
ex-barbarian. As was typical for mem-
bers of Shaa’s extended family as this
day wore on, Svin’s clothes were dis-
tinctly the worse for wear, but Svin
himself was largely unscathed. Indeed,
he seemed freshly laundered.
Shaa
spared a brief prayer for the fate of
his guest towels, nodded to Svin, and
moved along toward the living room,
from whence the clamor of voices that
had assaulted him as he’d opened the
door was emanating.
He stood surveying the scene, real-
izing as he did that he was expecting
a typical shouted greeting, something
along the lines of “Sure is about time

you decided to show up!” or “Who’s
that guy and what’s he doing in his
apartment?” But who would do the
shouting?
Not Karlini, who was in-
stead performing a very effective job of
being comatose on the couch covered
by a light blanket. Not that barbeque-
in-the-shape-of-a-human sprawled on
a sheet on the carpet being ministered
to by the ever-solicitous Wroclaw. Not
Haddo, who was typically sulking on
a divan across from Wroclaw as he
acerbically critiqued his handiwork.
Certainly not the siblings Mont, who
were taking mutual critique to the
depths only capable of being plumbed
by siblings close in age.
And not Roni, who was absent.
I wonder what the Creeping Sword
might have neglected to tell me? Shaa
considered idly.
Shaa had stored most of his medical

instruments in the decorative apothe-
cary cabinet on the wall adjacent to
the entryway. He rummaged through
it for a moment, then crossed to Kar-
lini. First things ﬁrst. I suppose, Shaa
said to himself, however unlikely, and
waved a bottle of concentrated smelling
salts in the midst of Karlini’s face. Kar-
lini’s nose twitched, his face contorted,
he squirmed on the couch, and then
his eyelids drew reluctantly back.
Amateurs.
A whole house full of
them, and he’d instructed them in ba-
sic ﬁrst-aid procedures, too. Ah, well.
Karlini focussed on Shaa, his face
drawn and lined.
“Roni’s dead,” he
said.
“Unequivocally?”
“Sounds that way,” said Karlini, to-
tally without energy.
“The Creeping
Sword killed her.”
Shaa seated himself on the ﬂoor.

“The Creeping Sword may not have
been able to help himself. It appears
he is also Iskendarian.”
Karlini stared blankly at him for a
moment. Then he drew in breath for
a deep shuddering sigh.
“I can see
there’s something here we’re going to
have to think about. Can I get a drink
of water?”
Karlini was not acting in the typical
manner for one who had just required
resuscitation with smelling salts, but
then very little about the situation was
normal.
Shaa was rising to his feet
to fulﬁll the request for water, which
was the ﬁrst traditional move Karlini
had made since reawakening, when
Karlini abruptly said, “I’m going to kill
him anyway, you know.”
Shaa sat back down. “I thought you
might be feeling that way. Don’t think
me callous when I say that might be

precipitate.”
“I wasn’t there to help her when she
needed it. What else’s left for me now?”
“Honoring Roni by acting rashly
would not have impressed her.”
“I’ll just have to be the one to worry
about that.
Are you arguing that be-
cause the personality we know wasn’t
in control and this other personality,
Iskendarian, was, I should hold the one
we know blameless?” Karlini shrugged.
“You kill one, you get the other one for
free. Nothing to do about it.”
Did Karlini want his water or not?
It might cool him off, but on the other
hand there might not be a better time
to try to work this through, and Shaa
didn’t want to lose the ﬂow.
“You
wouldn’t blame someone who was pos-
sessed.
This is not materially differ-
ent.”
“Okay, ﬁne,” said Karlini, “I won’t

blame him if you’d rather I not.
I
wouldn’t blame a rabid dog either. But
I’d still have to kill it.”
“What about the argument for self-
interest? We may yet need the man’s
capabilities.”
“There’s no compromising with evil.”
“Of course there is,” Shaa said, “es-
pecially considering that no one ever
has any idea how to deﬁne it. ‘I know
it when I see it’ is an insufﬁcient stan-
dard for executions.”
Karlini was starting to steam. “Why
are you defending him?
Do you see
Roni here anywhere? Wasn’t she your
friend and partner as much as any of
us?
Or are you just playing the con-
trarian for the hell of it, to drive me to
want to kill you too?”
This was good, in principle. Under
the ancient doctrine of transference,
perhaps Karlini was starting to deﬂect

his antagonism onto Shaa instead. Of
course, it wouldn’t do to let this get
out of hand.
Karlini could be deadly
enough in his own right that Shaa
didn’t want to face him down unless
he absolutely had to. Possibly a stern
glare was what was called for here. “I
seem to recall quite a lot of exertion
on your own behalf when you were
conﬁned to a certain castle recently,”
Shaa said pointedly.
“We all helped
you, at no little sacriﬁce and danger,
you might recall as well, including
the same gentleman you’re so ready
to exterminate.
He turned to us for
help, too, did he not? Quite obviously
we have failed him, or he would not
now be in the situation of a runaway
rogue. Perhaps he should be pressing
his grievances against us rather than
the other way around.”
“Are you out of your mind?
Think

about what you’re saying! These ﬂights
of rhetorical fancy are totally running
away with you.”
Well, perhaps he had gone a bit too
far.
The usual method for managing
such a patient would have been to hu-
mor him in his obsessions, especially
so soon after suffering such a major
shock.
Karlini, however, tended to-
ward the idée ﬁxe.
With him, it was
better to try to head off a bad idea
before it became wedged in his head
than to wait and hope to dislodge it
later. That didn’t mean he had to fall
off the deep end in the process. Shaa
raised his hand to hold back Karlini’s
mad onslaught. “These may be extraor-
dinary times. My major point was the
danger of precipitate action. We may
yet need the talents of every one of us,
what with Max in prison and -”
“What?” said Karlini. “What about

Max? And where have you been, any-
way?
If all else fails, change the subject. “I
too was locked up.
Also, my curse is
lifted.”
“... If that’s true, the bad news that
has to go with it must be pretty bad.”
“My brother is a god.”
“Just like I said.”
“I will get your water,” Shaa stated,
“assuming you still remember asking
for it, and then I suggest we gather the
troops for a brief session of bringing up
to date. Hmm?”
This was accomplished, and remark-
ably quickly too, especially under the
circumstances.
“It is difﬁcult to say
which complication demands the most
urgent response,” said Shaa, watching
Karlini chug down another tumbler
fresh from the jug.
“The situation
at the laboratory may bother me the

most, because of the potential for cat-
aclysm if anything survived the ﬁre
to escape into the environment. Espe-
cially given the manifestations at the
scene. Especially since you, Great One,
were unconscious and unable to make
a hazard assessment before you left.”
“It wasn’t my fault, I was -”
“I didn’t say a thing about fault,”
Shaa said severely, “which is in any
case irrelevant to the central concerns.
Wroclaw?
Haddo?
I know you two
reprobates have expressed your own
misgivings in this matter.”
Haddo was the one who spoke. “Said
Favored vanished hazard was.”
Shaa raised an eyebrow. “Who is Fa-
vored? Perhaps he or she - or it - should
be at this meeting too.”
As much as you could ever tell from
Haddo’s tone of voice, he seemed an-
noyed with himself.
As though he

had let slip something better left un-
said? Any such inference was as usual
helped not at all by a reading of his ex-
pression, which consisted of his typical
cowl-droop and eye-spark drift. “Busy
Favored-of-the-Gods is.
Attends he
meetings not.”
“Edifying,” Shaa said, “as always.
Anyone else have something to say
about this Favored?”
“Was he the one in the ﬂying ball?”
asked Jurtan Mont.
“Little guy with
pointy ears? He was dropping things
on the ﬁre from the air. Seemed like a
friend of Haddo’s.”
“I’ve met him, too,” Karlini said re-
luctantly. “He’s a technologist on call
to the gods. He’s got a nasty attitude.
He thinks everything we’ve been doing
should have been shut down, especially
the work in the lab.
If he’s satisﬁed
that the lab’s been defanged I’d think

that’s pretty solid assurance.”
Am I reassured?
Shaa asked him-
self. No, he was not. There were too
many new facts and new faces being
thrown around here. “I want to meet
this Favored, and I want a comprehen-
sive probe run on the lab. I -”
“Since when are you leader?” said
Karlini. “What happened to decisions
by consensus?”
“You are in my apartment,” Shaa
stated, and, directing his stare fully
at Karlini, added, “plus I may be the
only one of us whose thought processes
at the moment are intact. And before
we degenerate into a tit-for-tat of tort
and retort may I remind you that the
stakes on this are too great for error.”
“I’m getting a new doctor,” Karlini
muttered.
“That is always your prerogative. I’ll
have your records sent over.”

Shaa had had his eye on Tildamire
Mont, who had been looking increas-
ingly like a balloon about to burst.
“What is happening here?” she shouted
suddenly.
“We should be working to-
gether, not going for each other’s throat.
What would Roni think?”
Shaa made one of his ironic faces.
“Roni would probably recall our stan-
dard mode of behavior, that being that
after we have all spent too much time
together we need to retreat to opposite
ends of the continent or tear each oth-
ers’ ears off. But this time that’s not
an option we can afford.
I nominate
my brother for the problem of next
greatest import. Does anyone want to
challenge this assessment?”
“You know what I want,” said Kar-
lini.
“If Iskendarian takes over the city
he’ll be in hunting season faster than

any deer you’ve ever seen. Will you be
satisﬁed with that, at least for now?”
“If Iskendarian takes over and you
hear about it, will you tell me?”
“As I run looking for cover, yes, I
will.”
“All right, then,” Karlini grumbled.
Well, that was something. Of course,
if Iskendarian did take over, Karlini
would have to wait in line while a
ballroom full of gods took their shots
at him ﬁrst, from the tenor of what
Shaa had heard back at Jill’s temple.
“Now,” Shaa said, “to my brother. His
making himself a god does change our
relationship somewhat.”
“You mean now,
when you can’t,
you’re willing to kill him?” Karlini
sneered.
“Who says I can’t?” said Shaa, rather
quietly.
“That’s never been the issue.
But he shouldn’t have to be killed to be

stopped.”
“What if there’s no other way?”
“This time he has to be stopped,”
Shaa said, even more quietly, but with
clear resolve.
“Whatever happens he
has brought down on himself.
What-
ever that takes, it will take. But he has
already left himself open to an obvious
stroke from us.”
“The ring,” said Tildamire Mont.
“Exactly.”
“But -” sputtered Jurtan Mont. “But
wouldn’t your brother have triggered
whatever traps Max had left on the
ring when he put it on? And didn’t you
say it would be too hard to get Max out
of the dungeon anyway?”
“My brother knew Max had had
the ring and had certainly trapped it,”
Shaa told him. “That is one reason he
hid behind Jardin, Master of Curses.
Knowing Max,
his snare would be

optimized around the Curse Admin-
istrator’s capabilities,
as probed by
Max during their earlier negotiations.
I witnessed this ambush activated
by Jardin in my brother’s presence
when Jardin put the ring on.
Now,
it’s possible Max could have created
a second-order delayed-action trap as
well; not likely, but possible. I’m sure
my brother considered that possibility
too. The fact that he proceeded to store
the ring in an ice chest rather than
donning it in my presence argues that
his prudence is at a maximum. Even-
tually, though, he will need its power
boost.”
“So what, then?” asked Jurtan. “You
can’t put a new trap on the ring now,
can you, while it’s in your brother’s pos-
session?”
“Not exactly.” Shaa swiveled his gaze
to the recumbent Dortonn, slavered

against his will with Shaa’s full stock-
on-hand of medicinal ointments and
with a sterile drip-line running ﬂuids
into his arm. “It is time to bring this
gentleman into the discussion. “
The gentleman in question opened
his eyes. “I have been listening,” Dor-
tonn croaked.
“Why should I help
you?”
“Self interest, primarily,” said Shaa.
“It would accomplish your mission.”
“Wait a minute,” Jurtan interrupted
again.
“What are you talking about
here? What did I miss?”
“Dortonn is the disciple of Pod Dall,
who’s stuck in the ring,” his sister said.
“What they seem to be talking about is
that Dortonn knows some way to get
his master out of the ring.”
Jurtan looked confused. “But if Dor-
tonn knew how to awaken Pod Dall,
why hasn’t he done it already?”

Dortonn looked at him as though he
was a moron; perhaps he was. “It was
dangerous,” Dortonn said.
“It is dan-
gerous.”
“And that’s with everything set up
properly, with enough time, in a peace-
ful environment,” Karlini put in. “Even
if the work could be done at a distance,
under battleﬁeld conditions it could be
suicidal.”
“The release spells are that danger-
ous?” asked Tildamire.
“No,” said Karlini, “it’s what you get
after the spells have worked you have
to watch out for. You try being cooped
up in a ring for months and see how
you feel when you get out. You know
what happened the other time Pod
Dall started to come through; Roosing
Oolvaya was your city.”
“You mean he’d lash out at whoever
was helping him?” Jurtan protested.

“That doesn’t make sense.
He’d be
grateful; you’d have rescued him.”
“Yeah,” said Tildamire, “and maybe
he’d think you’d taken your own good
time about it.”
“Ah,” said Shaa, “but what if Pod
Dall had someone else handy against
whom to take out his wrath? Someone
closer to hand. For example, someone
wearing the ring?”

Chapter11
WAS HE DYING? Fradi wondered.
He was in extreme pain, or to be just
as precise the rest of his body had
abruptly caught up with the distress
of his hand.
But dying?
He would
just have to see. There was nothing he
could do about it anyway, since none of
his muscles would move.
But he would be dead now, were it
not for the countermeasure he had de-
ployed when he launched his attack

against his former patron, a defense
which he had somehow never men-
tioned to the Scapula.
The Scapula,
his ally. Were it not for that small fore-
sight he most likely would be moulder-
ing now, rather than trying to under-
stand the menacing twists and turns of
the Scapula’s own treacherous game.
“Treacherous” was the only word for
it, clearly.
As someone with his own
history in that area Fradjikan felt thor-
oughly equipped to recognize the hand
of a master of the ﬁeld. As his ally, the
Scapula had encouraged him in his sus-
picion of his ultimate fate at the hands
of his patron once his task was com-
plete, had counseled him on the key
signs to beware, on tactics of response,
on timing - had even provided him
with a “carefully tuned” weapon for
use at the appropriate moment.
The
weapon had performed the bidding of

its master, but that master was clearly
the Scapula. Instead of paralyzing or
eradicating Fradi’s patron, it had left
him merely weakened, wounded per-
haps, stripped of his mystic mantle of
ofﬁce to be sure, but scarcely out of the
picture.
And then there had been the Scapula
himself, appearing on cue to demon-
strate his utility and perspicacity to
Fradi’s patron, having not only fore-
cast such an attack but now fortu-
itously arrived to nullify the attacker.
But Fradjikan was not dead, only inca-
pacitated and immobilized. Could the
Scapula have erased him on the spot?
Surely, given the power he was now
manifesting.
Which obviously meant
that the Scapula still had some role for
him he was yet to play...
The most frustrating part of being
paralyzed in this particular place was

the restorative machinery that sur-
rounded him. Fradi had beneﬁted from
its benediction before, and perhaps (al-
though it seemed doubtful) had been
subjected to its effects even today. Was
there no way for him to get off the ﬂoor
and activate the equipment himself?
From their conversation as they had
left the room, the Scapula and Fradi’s
former patron, whose name was appar-
ently Vladimir, would not be absent
long. If the Scapula’s parting remark
could be taken at face value, their ab-
sence would however be long enough
that Fradi would never see the end of
it. “You don’t have a dungeon?” he had
responded to Vladimir. “Well, it can’t
be helped. Just lock the doors to this
place, why don’t you, and let the assas-
sin expire at his own pace.” Of course,
the pace Fradi was trying to choose for
his own was extremely slow.

Now, there was the rejuvenation cof-
ﬁn above his head. The ﬁrst time Fradi
had been here he had awakened within
it as well. On that occasion, though, he
seemed to vaguely recall that the thing
had been full of liquid, which had just
been draining away as he had returned
to consciousness. During that visit his
orientation had still been mystical, too.
He had seen the workings of the gods
and had considered them unknowable.
His sophistication in these matters had
advanced considerably over the subse-
quent period.
It was now clear to him that there
was very little in the realm of the
gods that was inherently unknowable
through being beyond the capacity of
human ken. Things might remain un-
known through being secret, but that
was lack of knowledge of a very differ-
ent order, one thoroughly familiar to

any sentient of whatever stature in life.
No, the truth appeared to be quite the
opposite of providing transcendental
infallibility for gods.
From his direct
encounters,
from his research,
and
from the events of this day, Fradi had
come to appreciate that his own former
patron, Vladimir, Lord of Storms, could
scarcely be called infallible or transcen-
dent by any reasonable observer with
a drop of residual sincerity in their
makeup.
Vladimir was close kin to the parlor
prestidigitator who manipulated his
tricks of coin and card and box not
through mystical power but through
skill of hand, or by their mere opera-
tion as appliances.
Both could work
the
hidden
mechanisms
cunningly
wrought by others, but neither was
heir to the secrets of the universe, or
even to the curiosity to seek them out;

they were wielders of the tools crafted
by their betters.
Which
implied
that
Fradi
could
likely run the rejuvenation appara-
tus as well as Vladimir, could he get
himself into place. Was that the role
the Scapula had intended him to play?
Was that why the Scapula had left him
here alive, even if presumably he was
on a fast track toward death?
True,
the Scapula had not known of Fradi’s
additional precautions, those defenses
that had kept him from being killed
outright...
but was even that really
true?
Even if the Scapula had failed
to learn about the speciﬁc countermea-
sure he had employed, the Scapula had
still known him. With that perception
the Scapula would have already under-
stood that he would have something of
the sort up his sleeve.
All of which seemed likely to mean

that he was exactly where the Scapula
wanted him to be in preparation for
whatever he might have planned next.
Of all the conditions the Scapula
could have left him with, he had cho-
sen paralysis. What better to ensure
his continued availability for the next
act?
Which argued that the best thing he
could do was try to escape the paralytic
hold.
But if his course of action was clear,
his tactics were not, since he was still,
needless to say yet still frustratingly
so, paralyzed.
“What about this proclamation?” I
said.
“The Scapula’s proclamation,
you
mean,” said Gash.
“Yeah, that’s right.” We were now on
our way somewhere in a hired cab. I’d
hoped Phlinn Arol would be the next

one to be paid a call, but Gash had said,
rather curtly, that Phlinn seemed to be
making himself unavailable, adding
that he seemed to be taking his civic
duties a bit too much to heart. I was
about ready to cut out on my own, Isk-
endarian or no Iskendarian; I ﬁgured
there was legwork I needed to be doing
myself.
The time I’d been spending
in thought had also been leading me
down some intriguing alleys.
I ﬁg-
ured Gash knew what they were and
didn’t want to bring them up, and I
was damned if I was going to tell him
I knew what I knew yet either. “If you
guys are so independent-minded why’s
there all this bother about proclama-
tions?”
“Yes,” Gash said. “We are creatures
of habit. You will have observed that
what passes for governance among us
is much along the lines of balance-of-

power diplomacy between independent
states occupying intertwining terrain.
What knits us together as much as
anything are traditions. Treaties and
covenants as well, but tradition before
all else. Also, never underestimate the
value of a tray of canapés and a chance
to socialize.”
“But it’s not real food at a conclave, I
thought. Just simulated.”
“Ah, but many will be gathered phys-
ically in the Gods’ Gallery at the Sta-
dium of State. You should understand
by now that we enjoy a good spectacle
as much as the next person.”
“And the Knitting is the one to beat?”
“Just so,” said Gash.
I was thinking back on the conclave
I’d attended, back in Oolsmouth; the
one Gash had stage-managed, purging
one of his adversaries in the process.
I’d actually learned quite a lot there,

and that was when I hadn’t even had
any idea what questions I should be
asking. In many ways I was still work-
ing through the leads I’d gotten then. I
should be in a much better position to
resolve certain things now.
Except what if that was the sort of
opportunity Iskendarian was looking
for? I could be putting him in position
to spread the scope of his damage far
and wide, to hook up with allies, to
cause who knew what kind of trouble.
But if Gash was right, and Byron
was the key to heading off further trou-
ble, and encountering the right person
might be the key to getting the rel-
evant information from the lock that
was Iskendarian - well, I couldn’t think
of an occasion with more potential than
the one Gash had just described.
There was no way around it; there
was just going to have to be risk

involved.
Any direction I turned
promised hazard, and not turning was
no different, either.
But that wasn’t the only thing I’d
had to consider.
Something had been nagging at my
mind since my talk with Gash about
Byron, and I’d ﬁnally ﬁgured out what
it was. Gash had been telling me about
how Byron had created the framework
for operational magic as an intellec-
tual exercise, not as something he’d
expected to put into production, but
that his associates had taken his de-
signs and set them into motion without
telling him. From my time with Shaa
and Max and the Karlinis I had some
idea of how these kinds of folks op-
erated, and indeed this all sounded
plausible, but I was wondering if there
might not be more to the story than
just that. The thing was, these wizzy

types did things differently when they
were just playing with ideas than when
they were locking down some system
that was expected to work. When they
were brainstorming they’d be kicking
around a lot of pretty loopy stuff they
never really intended to have see the
light of day; when they were getting
ready to move something out the door,
on the other hand, they got concerned
to the point of obsession about safe-
guards and testing and making sure
things really worked the way they were
supposed to.
So if Byron hadn’t been thinking
about actual deployment for the mate-
rial he had been developing, if he had
really been in brainstorming and sim-
ulation mode instead- what was built
into the structure of present-day magic
that wasn’t supposed to be there at all?
What hadn’t been tested? What hidden

surprises had he left?
It didn’t end there, either. Who said
Byron’s ability to tinker had gone away
when his partners had let his stuff
loose? He’d certainly have left himself
a back door to get back in and muck
around.
After being double-crossed,
what kind of revenge might he have
been able to plan?
Founding Abdicationism was wholly
consistent with this train of thought,
and it was potentially revealing of By-
ron’s inclination and state of mind as
well.
If he hadn’t wanted his theo-
retical work made concrete but was
willing to live with it after the fact,
you’d have expected he’d have shut
up and gone along. Instead, there he
was, rocking the boat, starting a philo-
sophical gambit that had grown into a
political schism by claiming the whole
idea of gods exercising dominion was

illegitimate.
The maneuver was as-
tute.
Even if Byron could sweep the
basis of the old order away through
some use of force or trick or stratagem,
delegitimizing that order in advance
could help insure against groundswell
counterattack or lingering revanchism.
Such a magnitude of shift in pub-
lic attitude wasn’t about to happen
overnight, though.
To see matters
through to their conclusion it might be
politic to slip out of sight while senti-
ment grew, and only resurface when
things had come to a head... which of
course very likely described now.
So where was he? What was he wait-
ing for? Or was he already back on the
scene?
Could Arznaak be Byron? That was
a particularly nasty thought.
But it was not, I suddenly realized
with an even greater sense of dread,

the only viable scenario.
How many
people on the present stage had been
exhibiting shifts of identity?
I thought I was losing my sense of
what was preposterous.
Max was considering counting to ten
thousand, again.
That would be at
least as useful as any other activity he
could busy himself with, locked in this
dungeon with all the mobility of a cord
of wood, obviously cast adrift and per-
haps even forgotten by his associates
and -
There went the barred door again. If
it was a priest, Max resolved to do his
best to fall asleep. He closed his eyes
and made his breathing shallow.
Unexpectedly, something clanked be-
hind his head, then clicked delicately.
These were not noises he was accus-
tomed to hearing from the banshee
device that was deliberately ruining

his hearing, and setting to work on his
sanity, too. Could that be the sound of
intentional deactivation? Then he felt
someone breathing close to his ear.
“You can’t be serious,” said Phlinn
Arol. “I know you’re not dormant, and
you haven’t been driven out of your
mind.”
Max squinted across at him. “I was
trying to cultivate an attitude of de-
tachment. Seeing how unlikely it is I’ll
see the outside world while there’s still
anything I can do that will affect it.”
“Pouting is beneath you, Maximil-
lian.”
“I would have thought a lot of things
were beneath me, like being strapped
down like a plucked chicken, but I’m
here to learn better, aren’t I? Is the Em-
peror still being a fool?”
“The
Emperor-designate
is
being
insufﬁciently prudent,” Phlinn Arol

temporized. “The Scapula will be stag-
ing the ofﬁcial proclamation of his
assumption of godhood very shortly;
imminently, in fact, during the social
meeting preceding the assembly of
homage for the Knitting of the Corpus.
I would like you to think about how
matters might evolve from there.”
“He’s moving pretty fast, isn’t he?”
“He is,” allowed Phlinn. “His progress
is
not
unprecedented,
but
it
does
demonstrate exceptional self-assurance
and a decisive will to act. These will
impress many of his new peers.”
“I’d think they’d threaten, more.”
“Not when the vacuum of power is so
acute,” Phlinn said. “Realize that there
is a signiﬁcant faction that has agreed
to bind themselves to follow a common
leader if certain conditions are met.”
“A leader? Are you serious? What
conditions?”

“Your being here fulﬁlls one.”
“You are serious.... Arznaak. He put
me here.”
“He
could
convincingly argue
as
much, yes.”
“How much do you know about this?”
Max demanded.
“Could part of his
proclamation be to ﬁnish me off in
front of everybody?”
“I - hmm.”
“I don’t like the sound of that,” said
Max. “I don’t like that at all. Why did
you come back here?”
“I was interested in your advice,”
Phlinn Arol told him.
“As you may
know, the Emperor-designate is per-
mitted to attend a conclave of the gods,
in somewhat of an ex ofﬁcio capacity.”
“Won’t he have to be getting ready
for the Knitting ceremony himself?”
“Certainly, yes, but there is a period
of traditional meditation in the sched-

ule that could allow him to pop in. It
is supposed to be a time for socializing,
after all.”
“Is Arznaak violating some tradition
by taking over this social hour for his
own agenda?”
“Well ...” said Phlinn. “A proclama-
tion of ascendancy does fall under the
category of society-type news. It’s ac-
tually considered at least as appropri-
ate to make such an announcement at
a regularly scheduled public affair as
to show the hubris of holding your own
gloriﬁcation party.”
“Huh,” said Max. “What about you,
then? Are all the gods required to be
there?”
“It is rather a deliberate snub not
to. These galas are supposed to be the
great levelers and mixers.
Of course,
I am the designated representative in-
carnate to the Emperor-elect so I could

claim meditation for my own excuse as
well. However, it is the expected thing
for the liaison representative to mingle
and gain as much advantage as pos-
sible from their temporary status and
visibility. But these social niceties are
not necessarily the point. There is pol-
itics and there is prudence. You know
the Scapula as well as anyone. Where
does prudence lie in this situation?”
“I know a conclave is neutral ground,”
Max said. “It’s deliberately set up so no
one has an advantage of power; all you
can do is talk. Of course we all know
Arznaak can be a pretty convincing
talker. Does he have a patron?”
“It is known that Protector of Na-
ture and Vladimir, the Storm Lord,
have been the active representatives
of this faction I mentioned, those who
would centralize power. I assume they
will present and speak for Arznaak.”

“Huh.
I don’t know,” said Max.
“I
don’t know.
If you go to this thing -
if the Emperor goes - I’d like to think
he’d see once and for all what kind of
plans Arznaak really has, where - if
anywhere - he intends to stop. But I’m
just naturally suspicious of anything
Arznaak’s wrapped up in. From every-
thing I know there’s nothing he should
be able to do there, but I still don’t
trust him.”
“This could be mere paranoia on
your part?” Phlinn probed.
“Exacer-
bated by the recent success of the
Scapula’s plan against you and the
current fact of your conﬁnement?”
“... Yes,” said Max. “Yes it could, of
course it could.”
“I’m glad to see you retaining your
objectivity,” Phlinn Arol said dryly.
“Fine, then.
Here’s something else
objective.
If Arznaak’s plan depends

on me being here, you could derail the
plan by springing me loose.”
“But then the Emperor-designate
would not see him for what he is, would
he?”
“You’re quick as ever, aren’t you.”
Damn him. Or on the other hand, don’t
damn him quite yet - Phlinn was still
standing over the bed of conﬁnement.
“What else you got on your mind?”
“... Your choice of companions,” said
Phlinn Arol. “Speciﬁcally the one un-
der the Spell of Namelessness. Have
you considered he may be a trap?”
“You think I’m an idiot? Of course he
could be a trap. I just thought we’d be
safer having him where we could watch
him and hope to counteract him if he
went off - wait a minute - has he gone
off?”
Phlinn Arol donned what he obvi-
ously intended to serve as an impas-

sive countenance.
Max had seen im-
passive on Phlinn, though, and this
wasn’t it.
“Perhaps that is a matter
of interpretation.
He has manifested
himself as Iskendarian.”
Max was sure Phlinn was about to
say more - surely he had to say more
- but after a moment of contemplative
hesitation he swung quickly around
instead, and was gone. “Phlinn!” Max
shouted, breaking all his rules of self-
possession and decorum. “Phlinn!” But
he was gone.

Chapter12
FOR THE FIRST TIME, Fradjikan
was noting some serious regret at not
have taken spell-work more seriously.
He had never envisioned a case where
the use of magic would be necessary
and a sorcerer would not be available
for convenient hire. He had certainly
not foreseen being himself in a situa-
tion where his own life would depend
on being able to conjure his own way
out from under a malign spell.
Yet

the application of maximum muscular
force had failed to move the most triv-
ial portion of his body, and the most
intense concentration and ﬁercest con-
solidation of will had produced mere
mental exhaustion.
His paralysis re-
mained, and the tantalizing engines
of healing remained an unbridgeable
arm’s-span above his head.
He had lost track of how much
time had passed. More than minutes,
surely; possibly as much as hours. And
then, suddenly, the waiting was over;
the door ﬂung open, the Scapula and
Vladimir returned.
“- don’t under-
stand why we didn’t just remain at
Clara’s,” Vladimir was saying as he
came through the door. As he crossed
the threshold he stumbled, or more
precisely his knees buckled, and he
caught himself by grabbing the door-
frame.
With an air of solicitude the

Scapula helped to steady him. “Her fa-
cilities are more comfortable,” Vladimir
continued, in his weakened voice, “and
we wouldn’t have had to travel all the
way back here, and after the proclama-
tion we would have a much better view
of the Knitting.”
“It would not do to appear to be too
much of a cabal,” said the Scapula. “We
wish to appear a popular groundswell.”
He approached and bent over Fradi, ex-
amining his face searchingly. “This one
is mouldering rapidly,” he called back
over his shoulder, but then did a most
unexpected thing. As he was straight-
ening himself, he glanced back down at
Fradi, and winked.
From the other side of the room
Fradi could hear the sigh of air easing
from soft leather cushions. “I use these
divans while conferencing,” Vladimir
said. “Shall I call for refreshments?”

“No time,” said the Scapula.
“The
schedule is exacting and Clara will
await.” Fradi’s eyes were the largest
bodily feature he had found to remain
under his own voluntary control. For-
tunately, involuntary functions such as
breathing and the beating of his heart
had continued with some regularity as
well. Since he knew of many poisons
that caused death by freezing these ac-
tivities, this had scarcely been assured.
He had even retained some vestige of
decorum with the retention of muscle
tone in assorted sphincters.
But the
eyes were what concerned him at the
moment.
By craning them as far as
possible around to the sides of their or-
bits, and focusing his attention on his
peripheral vision, Fradi could see the
Scapula settling onto a couch placed at
a right angle to that occupied by the re-
clining Lord of Storms. Perhaps it was

the extreme angle, or even an incipient
cataract in his eye, but a small fog-
bank appeared to be condensing over
Vladimir’s head and extending itself
along his body. The Scapula said, “Ev-
erything is ready?” as though he were
asking himself a question, and then
nodded in satisfaction as he answered
himself in the afﬁrmative; “Everything
is ready.” Then the same cloud swirled
out of the air over the Scapula’s head
and spread out across his form like a
caul.
I’d been here before. Not ‘here,’ this
speciﬁc place, and even calling it a
‘place’ was misleading since as far as
I could tell none of this had any basis
in concrete external observable reality,
but for all that it was a place, and was
certainly of the same sort I had visited
before, in Oolsmouth.
These conclaves of the gods, and for

all I knew their whole system of com-
munications, took place on a neutral
common ground of artiﬁcial environ-
ments that existed - dreamlike - solely
by mutual agreement.
Since I still
hadn’t experienced a dream worthy of
the name, I was taking that part of
the description on faith but without
the slightest complaint. If Iskendarian
wanted to monopolize the dreams to
which our jointly held body was enti-
tled, I was with him all the way. The
deeper he chose to retreat into dream-
land the happier I’d be.
That he was still around, however,
was attested to by the fact that I was
able to launch myself into the gods’ con-
sensual fantasy-space, unless of course
he’d abandoned our body while leaving
his store of knowledge and practical
techniques behind, buried somewhere
in our shared unconscious.
I wasn’t

sure what I’d feel if he had cleared out
- I doubted it would be as simple as
noticing I was now rattling around in
the equivalent of a large empty house
formerly shared with a loud and de-
manding roommate - but I did have
the (possibly fatalistic) idea that as
soon as I thought he was gone and
started to relax, that’s when he would
really let me have it once and for all.
Of course, the last time I’d hit the
conclave circuit I’d been going as part
of a group; this time I was solo. I still
didn’t know what Gash intended to
do, which I’m sure wasn’t accidental
on his part, and if anyone knew if I’d
be meeting up with any of my other
pals it sure wasn’t me. If I could have
ﬁgured out how to nose around while
not actually attending - eavesdropping
with one foot out the door, so to speak
- I’d have done that instead, but aside

from the vague assurance in the back
of my mind that I could do that if I was
smart enough I couldn’t dredge up the
information that would tell me how to
bring it about. Instead, I found myself
retracing familiar ground:
the cloud
above my head, the drawing-down ﬁn-
ger motions in front of my face, the
clammy tendrils of fog creeping down
my back and across my body and into
my ears; the feeling that even though
I didn’t consciously know what I was
doing, it was familiar, and I might as
well just give myself up to it and let
whatever was in control have its rein.
I wasn’t sure where Gash had taken
himself off to this time. Jill either, for
that matter.
We’d considered going
back to her place in lieu of the avail-
ability of another base of operations,
but when I’d told him I had it in my
mind to attend the Scapula’s proclama-

tion but wasn’t happy with the idea
of leaving my insensible body lying
around where she’d have easy access
to it he’d reluctantly revealed that,
indeed, he had his own small retreat
down a convenient byway. His retreat
proved in fact to be a walk-up apart-
ment above a laundry and an eggroll
shop in a seedy quarter not far off the
Boulevard of Gods. On unlocking the
door, he’d cast me a severe gaze, as
though daring me ever mention this to
anyone else, before leading the way up
the stairs.
The ﬂat wasn’t shabby, exactly, but
it was clear he hadn’t had anyone in
to pick up for a while. I even consid-
ered - very brieﬂy - suggesting that
perhaps he could set up some arrange-
ment with the laundryman underfoot.
I’d quashed the idea as soon as it had
manifested, though.
Circumstances

had thrown me closely together with
Gash but they hadn’t made us close,
if you follow my meaning, or at least
close enough for me to be giving him
the sort of critique bandied about by
bachelor gentlemen of whatever social
stratum. Perhaps the suggestion that
I raise the topic had ﬂoated up from
Iskendarian, in an attempt to get me
pummeled and thus let him loose, but
I didn’t take that idea too seriously; I
knew full well how creatively I could
get myself in trouble with no need of
external assistance.
In any case, after rummaging around
for a bit Gash had produced a carafe of
iced tea from his chiller, and I’d joined
him in a glass before being shown back
to the armchair in the front room. “Do
you think this is a good idea?” I’d asked
him.
He’d shrugged.
“There are argu-

ments on every side. That is why I am
still considering whether or not to join
you. Are you sure you can handle it?”
“Hell,” I’d said, “I’m not sure of any-
thing. All I know is that I did this be-
fore without our pal popping out, and
there’s nothing else on the schedule
that has the potential of shifting the
rules like this bit with the Scapula.”
So here I was now, in the logical se-
quela to that argument, synchronizing
into the arrival zone of...
the crater
of an active volcano?
I’d never vis-
ited one that I could remember, you
understand, but it still had all the hall-
marks: a wide bubbling lake of glowing
red magma, with burps of semi-solid
rock jetting into the air here and there
across its surface; a sensation of bak-
ing heat billowing from the cauldron
in waves; the scents of brimstone and
rotten eggs; a rumbling and quaking

underfoot; inclined rock walls reach-
ing jaggedly toward the heavens on all
sides, excepting only the large ﬂattish
space I found myself at one edge of;
even the arcs of lightning that sparked
from the molten rock to the low-riding
clouds and back on a continual crack-
ling basis.
Of course, the typical vol-
cano lacked some of the amenities this
one provided: the comfortable loung-
ing chairs and settees arranged in
conversational groupings around the
undulating coffee tables; the strolling
instrumentalists and wait-persons and
-things; and, of course, the crowds of
gaily dressed folks standing around
gossiping while ostentatiously ignor-
ing the spectacular view. I looked for
a ambulating palm tree but instead
spotted a whole grove of them holding
court off at the far side, checked for
the rafﬁsh piratical aspect favored by

Phlinn Arol, but without success, and
ﬁnally decided to make a swing past
the virtual sideboard on my way to
join the hippogriff who was telling ob-
viously hilarious jokes to his audience
of two humans in jewels and ermine,
an ostrich, a toad as tall as the ostrich,
and a cloud of sparkling dust.
I’d had half a thought of mingling
for a bit and then clearing out just
before the Scapula made his spiel,
but apparently I’d dawdled a little
too long with Gash before setting out,
for I had barely reached the sideboard
when Shaa’s brother, resplendent in
his usual jet outﬁt, emerged from the
midst of the palm grove and stood
there waiting to be noticed.
Or per-
haps that wasn’t what he was waiting
for.
With a ripple of fronds, all the
palms simultaneously cast down their
coconuts.
At the large thud/thwock

of several hundred coconuts demolish-
ing themselves against the ﬂoor, every
head swiveled toward the trees, and
even those attendees wearing aspects
that lacked heads (and in several ex-
treme cases, eyes as well) gave the
impression of shifting their attention
to that end of the assembly. Then the
grove said, in the echoing single voice
of the Protector of Nature, “Nice to see
you all here.”
She went into a typical welcome-
guys,
hope-you’re-having-a-good-time
spiel and then moved smoothly on
to the introduction of the new kid in
their midst. The onlookers projected a
mostly pleasant air of patient forbear-
ance, although I did notice a few ner-
vous glances and incredulously raised
eyebrows, but when Protector of Na-
ture made the rapid segue to describe
how the former Scapula had fulﬁlled

the requirements of her search com-
mittee for the god-among-gods a buzz
broke out, rapidly ascending to a hub-
bub of heated debate. For some reason
the whole thing was making me feel
more than a little creepy, as though
ants were marching through my head
and down my back, not at all the sort
of reaction I would have expected from
myself but then what was I supposed
to expect by now, anyway?
Maybe my uneasy feeling came from
watching the Scapula himself.
He
had yet to say a word on his own, yet
the gaze he was casting across the as-
sembly owed only the barest nod to
humility or a sense of place or grati-
tude to the benefactors sponsoring him
in his latest enterprise. For a moment
I considered the idea that this was
the reserve of someone thrust into a
unfamiliar social situation.
But no,

he had the expression I imagined was
typical for him, the look of I-am-lord-
of-creation holiest-of-holies biggest-of-
cheeses; an expression designed to em-
phasize that the only things in sight
were things he owned, or things he
ran. Now that I thought about it, this
probably wasn’t too unfamiliar a social
setting for him either, other than a few
details of place and players and odd
ambience effects. Before his Transcen-
dence he had already been, after all,
at the very summit of the political hi-
erarchy of the greatest empire anyone
had ever seen. You didn’t get there by
nepotism, either. You had to -
I suddenly began to suspect that I
wasn’t the only one watching who was
having that same crawly sensation.
Several celebrants in humanoid guise
were scratching their necks or patting
their hair, over near the edge of the

magma lake a dwarf rhinoceros was
surreptitiously brushing itself against
the side of a coffee table, and even a
few of the palm trees were rattling
their fronds with somewhat excess
vigor.
When you thought about it,
this was extremely odd, since no one
was actually physically present in this
place. Even the place wasn’t physically
real. And all these people were getting
itchy? At the same moment?
It was time to leave, I decided, and
even as I had the thought I moved
it to execution by invoking a quick-
disconnect mechanism that had just
ﬂoated to mind.
At least I thought I’d tripped that
mechanism. I subvocalized the trigger-
word again.
Okay, so Iskendarian was playing
games, so I was still where I’d been.
There was still the traditional way to

disengage and withdraw. All I had to
do was terminate the wideband com-
munications link and the reality ﬁeld
would collapse. I knew how to do that -
I was doing it right.
So why was
nothing happening? Why -
I looked around.
At least a half-
dozen other attendees were muttering
to themselves, their eyes screwed shut
in concentration and ﬁngers making
ﬂuttery contortionist passes. I swung
back to face the Scapula.
Across the
assembly, his smirk was wide and tri-
umphant. As I glared at him, he raised
his hand and began for the ﬁrst time
to speak.
“Thank you,” he declaimed, inter-
rupting the discussion between Pro-
tector of Nature and a trio of furies
who had been yelling back at her palm
grove with a single voice that jumped
back and forth between the three of

them in the midst of sentences and be-
tween words. It had been an amusing
effect; I ﬁgured the three bodies were
animated by one puppeteer splitting
his or her attention between them. But
it wasn’t amusing now - nothing was
amusing now.
“Thank you, my part-
ners, for such a laudatory introduction,
so glowing and yet so trusting.”
A new fusillade of speed-streaked co-
conuts appeared from the midst of the
grove and converged on the Scapula.
Instead of splattering his projected
ﬁgure or beating it to the artiﬁcial
ground, though, they spun into orbit
around him, a brown fuzzy blur mak-
ing the sound of a small tornado, then
faded from sight and vanished.
The
Scapula was revealed again holding a
tall glass of coconut milk, from which
he took a deliberate sip, then pressed
milk and glass into nothingness be-

tween his palms. “As you have been dis-
covering,” he went on, “this is scarcely
a typical proclamation.
Indeed, you
have all become my prisoners.”

Chapter13
“JUST WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
with your brother, anyway?” Jurtan
Mont asked suddenly. “Why is he the
way he is?”
“You’re not the ﬁrst to bring that up,”
said Zalzyn Shaa.
Having reached a
consensus, albeit a forced one, it had
seemed prudent to hit the road again
while Karlini and the remains of Dor-
tonn worked their whiles.
Since the
consensus had been somewhat forced,

however, he had enlisted the watch-
ful Svin to keep them focused on the
task at hand. And Haddo and Wroclaw,
and
Haddo’s
newly-revealed
friend
Favored-of-the-Gods? - well, it was an
unfortunate fact that there were too
many players on the scene, and not
enough trust to go around. Maybe they
could all be sent on the certainly suici-
dal mission of trying to free Max. Even
if sent, of course, they would scarcely
go, but with the attempt would surely
go any residual measure of good will.
There were things to be said for cata-
tonia as a style of life.
But even if there were, his brother
Arznaak would scarcely be the one
saying them. “I believe Arznaak’s be-
havior stems from roots innate,” Shaa
continued.
“Nurtured by the indul-
gence of my parents, to be sure, and
especially by our father’s particular

myopia.
I suppose you might say as
well as anything that my brother lacks
an appreciation for magic.”
“He seems to be pretty effective us-
ing magic as a weapon,” commented
Tildamire. “Wouldn’t you say?”
“That’s not the sort of magic I was
thinking about. There’s magic as a util-
itarian tool, which is the one you were
thinking of, and then there’s magic as a
state of mind, a metaphorical descrip-
tor for an attitude toward the world.
Arznaak is thoroughly utilitarian. It’s
the esthetic appreciation of things as
they are that has always eluded him.
You appear to be wondering what I’m
talking about.”
“Are you talking about the beauty of
nature?” said Jurtan.
“It’s true that a humanizing effect
is often associated with stopping to
smell ﬂowers or leisurely watching the

sun set, and it is equally true that
my brother has never had the slight-
est interest in these things.
There
is a danger in being too resolutely
goal-directed. That’s probably more a
symptom than a root cause, to be sure,
but it is also part of a syndrome.
A
constellation of symptoms often seen
in association,” Shaa added.
Jurtan Mont had his face contorted,
a sign often noted when he was trying
to follow Shaa through some unnec-
essarily abstruse argument.
“Wait a
minute,” he said. “The Scapula’s a vil-
lain, right? He’s evil. Isn’t that all the
explanation you need? He tortured you
and Eden when you were kids, now he
made himself a god because he wants
to run the world - I mean, that makes
him evil. Doesn’t it?”
“You idiot,” said his sister.
“That’s
way too simplistic.
He doesn’t think

of himself as a bad guy, does he?, and
evil’s just a label. Isn’t it?”
Shaa thought that Svin, the new-
born philosopher, should really be at
hand for this. “You tell me,” Shaa tem-
porized. “Arznaak enjoys causing pain.
He enjoys depriving people of what
they love best, using them as tools, im-
posing on them the fates he chooses;
exercising his will as a lash. That is
the way he is. Does that make him evil,
whatever that is?
If he is evil, then
that probably makes me evil as well,
since I failed to annihilate him when
I might have had the chance.” Shaa
shrugged. “I don’t know about labels.
What I do know is that now he’s gone
too far and he has to be stopped. He’s
no longer restricting his wrath to the
family, where it was our business how
we handled him.”
“But isn’t it too late?” said Jurtan.

“Now he’s so powerful, and he seems
to be such a master of magic. I don’t
know,” he went on wistfully.
“Maybe
there’s some piece of forgotten tech-
nology out there that could bring him
down.”
“Could be,” said Shaa. “More likely
you’re falling into the trap of a ro-
mantic mindset.
Magic is practical,
everyday stuff, with nothing mystical
or sentimental about it; just another
tool.
Technology, on the other hand,
makes people go gooey-eyed and misty-
brained with that forbidden allure and
images of an enchanting better world.
The fallacy of that thinking is that if
technology weren’t proscribed it would
just be another tool too.
Tools aren’t
sentimental. People use them all just
the same way.”
“But -”
Shaa held up a ﬁnger.
“We have

arrived.” He inverted the hand and
spread
his
ﬁngers
to
indicate
the
street ahead.
The block held an un-
usual gloom in the declining sun; the
gaslines
to
the
wide-spaced
street-
lights had obviously been breached,
or more hopefully turned off due to
the damage to the neighborhood. The
smell of burning was still intense, and
wisps of smoke were still rising from
the charred ash-heaps of the several
ruined buildings.
Tildamire had begun to weave from
side to side on her feet. Shaa grasped
her shoulder with a steadying grip.
“I’m ﬁne,” she said quaveringly. “I was
just visualizing -”
“Yes,” said Shaa. An incendiary con-
sumption of living ﬂesh. And surpris-
ingly enough, one that was difﬁcult to
tie to his brother.
“Couldn’t she be alive?” Tildamire

added plaintively.
“I didn’t actually
see her burn -” she gulped – “I mean,
I saw Roni, and I saw the ﬁreball, but
I don’t think I really saw the ﬁreball
hit her.
Couldn’t she have had some
last-minute defense, something that
shielded her long enough for her to get
away?”
Interesting, Shaa thought.
That
was not quite exactly the story as
he had been hearing it.
Sometimes
these minor differences could be sig-
niﬁcant. “Ronibet surely had her per-
sonal protection ﬁeld, but likely it was
overwhelmed by the force of the blast;
Iskendarian is a heavyweight. But this
argument has a ﬂaw of logic. If she es-
caped, where is she now? Why hasn’t
she made herself known?”
“Then couldn’t she have teleported
herself or transferred her mind or -
or something? Something that would

make her unreachable for a while?”
“I
suppose
anything
is
possible,”
Shaa said reluctantly. “But I wouldn’t
try to console myself by convincing
myself it was likely, or had actually
happened. Shall we accomplish what
we came here to do, then, which is to
say evaluate what is unfortunately a
much greater and a much less pleasant
probability?”
“... All right,” whispered Tildamire.
“All right, yes, Shaa, let’s do that.”
“Right,” said Shaa. “Now, you were
assisting her on this, so you should be
able to remember the recognition sig-
natures of those organisms she was cre-
ating.
The destruct beacons to track
them down if any got loose? Those.”
“I guess so. Maybe. But I’ve never
run a probe on my own.”
“I will assist you. And Jurtan? - per-
haps you would be good enough to re-

extend your particular talents as well.”
“Yeah, okay, but what am I trying to
ﬁnd?”
“Anything that might have escaped
the destruction, and be ﬂourishing, in
preparation to march out and eat the
rest of the city. Is that enough to start
with?”
If his paralysis had been caused
by a drug, Fradjikan had noted, it
would most likely be wearing off by
now, or he would be dead.
But if he
was afﬂicted by a drug, it was not
one he was familiar with, and he had
thought he had known them all, down
to the rarest trace alkaloid.
Sorcer-
ous delivery methods for traditional
poisons were scarcely unknown either,
of course, and since the Scapula was
clearly the master of magic he, Frad-
jikan, was not, their employment was
obviously within his grasp. Still, when

all the evidence had been considered it
appeared that his downfall had been
accomplished
through
entirely
wiz-
ardly means.
Fradi had been considering the ev-
idence at hand.
Without question,
pondering the etiology of his doom was
a morose way of passing what likely
were his last moments extant, but he
hadn’t exactly been in the mood for
pleasant reminiscences. And perhaps
he could still think of something use-
ful.
Without any need to invoke the
paralysis, his injuries by themselves
had
been
increasingly
sapping
his
strength.
Fradi suspected he had
gone through periods of stupor, and
if his speech mechanisms had been
operational it was likely episodes of
delirium would have revealed them-
selves as well. On top of that, he was

in need of sustenance - he was hungry,
and thirsty, and could probably use
a blood transfusion for good measure
too. Perhaps if the Scapula bothered to
take note of him again he would bring
it up.
Fradjikan had also been watching
the Scapula and Vladimir, for lack of
anything more productive to do. They
had been lying placidly on their divans,
until for some reason, in the last sev-
eral minutes, the Lord of Storms had
begun writhing and thrashing feebly
within his cocoon of fog. Perhaps he has
just encountered the Scapula I know,
Fradi was thinking, when the desper-
ado in question abruptly stripped his
mantle of cloud from around his form,
stretched, and sat up. “Ahh,” he said.
“That was most invigorating.”
At ﬁrst Fradi thought his eyes might
be ﬁnally growing dysfunctional now

too. But, no, the Scapula was glowing.
In fact,
he was positively lumines-
cent.
Could it be that his plans had
reached fruition? Perhaps the contin-
gency for which he, Fradjikan, had
been preserved was no longer prime
to be invoked.
Perhaps the Scapula
would merely leave the room and ad-
vance to other pursuits. There, now he
was getting to his feet ...
And now he was walking unambigu-
ously in Fradi’s direction.
Once their course had been resolved,
it was clearly prudent to move fast. Ini-
tially reluctant, Dortonn had allowed
himself to be convinced that the gam-
bit might as well be tried. The upside
for him was substantial; a grateful and
sated Pod Dall could heal his wounds
and shower him with garlands and re-
turn him to the frozen north, safe at
last from these southern maniacs.
If

things went sour again he could always
give up and die. In the meantime, Shaa
had come through with a nerve block
and the soothing salve made it less ap-
palling to walk around, so why not try?
And he was, as he had been re-
minded, sworn to a mission.
As long as they were going to try it,
there was no point in wasting time.
The Scapula, being a rogue of the
ﬁrst order, was obviously proceeding
with his own plans, and it had to be
assumed he could have some counter-
stroke up his sleeve. But on the other
hand there was no point in launching
themselves unprepared at half-cock. It
was more than just a question of pro-
cedures, there was an uncomfortable
amount of unavoidable improvisation
ahead.
What was Pod Dall’s state of
consciousness in the ring, for exam-
ple?
Did the ravening insanity that

had gripped him in Roosing Oolvaya
still wrap his mind? They had consid-
ered the tradeoff of waiting to move
while seeking out additional expertise.
After all, Max (having spent so much
time probing the ring in the course
of placing his traps) might know and
Gashanatantra (having worked to es-
tablish the ring as a snare for Pod
Dall in the ﬁrst place) certainly must
know how to release Pod Dall from his
conﬁnement, but even they didn’t nec-
essarily know how to restore his sanity
or stabilize his mood once he had been
freed.
So that tradeoff had been re-
jected. With further debate reduced to
a minimum, there was now no excuse
for delay.
Which was not to say there had
not been some hierarchical jostling
between the professionals on hand.
“Are you familiar with the Kringlaffer

hold?” Dortonn had asked Karlini.
“You can’t be serious,” had been Kar-
lini’s retort.
“No one in their right
mind would still use Kringlaffer after
the Dray Kopf counter.”
“I may be from the north but that
doesn’t mean I’m out of touch,” croaked
Dortonn.
“If you anticipate the Dray
Kopf you can build in this.”
“That’s not bad,” was Karlini’s grudg-
ing reply. “But what about...”
And so it had gone.
“Why remain
here we?” Haddo hissed at Wroclaw.
“We gave our word to Dr.
Shaa,”
said Wroclaw, watching the network of
tuning parameters hanging in the air
around Dortonn and Karlini. Svin was
hanging back by the door, ﬁngering his
sword speculatively.
He had earlier
expressed the intention to slash vigor-
ously if anything sorcerous happened
to wander in his direction.

“Pfah!” snorted Haddo. “Owe I Shaa
nothing.”
“That is debatable,” Wroclaw said
severely. “But even if true, Karlini is
still our employer, and Karlini is still
here. Would you leave him alone with
your old compatriot Dortonn?
Even
damaged,
Dortonn is not empty of
tricks.”
“Perhaps time it is to quit. The rev-
olution help will I not if slave remain I
to wages.”
A cloud of ethereal vapor pumped
pinkly across the room; Karlini leaned
into it and made tamping-down mo-
tions. “And what revolution would that
be?” asked Wroclaw.
“Always is there revolution,” pro-
claimed Haddo.
“I see,” Wroclaw said. “That revolu-
tion.”
“Patronize not I,” Haddo warned.

“Farthest thing from my mind.”
“Haddo!” said Karlini, scarcely for
the ﬁrst time, half-enmeshed in the
clinging folds of the marginally-controlle
pink cloud. “You want to give us a hand
over here or not?”
“Hear,” grumbled Haddo,
“I, and
obey.”
The Scapula stood over Fradi, gaz-
ing down.
“So,” he said, “you may
have been wondering why you have
remained alive, and whether this state
of affairs is likely to persist. You are
a clever enough fellow, but you have
lacked important facts. Unfortunately
there is insufﬁcient time to enlighten
you. Perhaps you will appreciate the
sound and fury, at any rate.” He tugged
at a plain gold band on his ﬁnger;
tugged harder. An expression of mild
consternation appeared on his face.
“Damn,” he murmured.
“That was

clever.”
“He has grown aware of us,” Dortonn
said suddenly.
“The binding spell is in place?” asked
Wroclaw. He had lost track of the pro-
gression of the spell-work while Kar-
lini and Haddo were ﬁghting the train
of spell-packets back into line.
“Yes, he’s got the ring on his body,
and the binding spell’s in place,” said
Karlini, who had inherited that part
of the job once they had agreed on the
modiﬁcations to the Kringlaffer.
“It
may even last long enough, too.”
Even if the binding held, Wroclaw
thought, there was an obvious coun-
termove.
But would Shaa’s brother,
unprepared, avail himself of it?
“They will pay,” said the Scapula.
It was those obnoxious friends of his
brother, no doubt. His stroke against

them was apparently not as preemp-
tory as he had intended.
Someone
would hear about that; more than hear,
to be exact - he didn’t employ the fools
to be late, and it wasn’t likely they’d
be able to wring from him a second
chance. Well, at least his brother was
still locked in his cell back at the house;
he was going to need to take this out
on somebody, and minions wouldn’t
be nearly as satisfying. Arznaak went
to his knees, deliberately clenched his
teeth, spread his ﬁngers wide on the
ﬂoor, positioned his dagger grasped
ﬁrmly in the other hand, and leaned
into the stroke. The tip went cleanly
through the bone. His own ﬁnger - still
bound to the Pod Dall ring - came free
and curled up in the sudden rush of
blood.
“Well, he went for the Dray Kopf,”
Karlini said. “Should we abort?”

“The proliferator should still bind to
him,” croaked Dortonn.
“The ring is
still tied to his ﬂesh - it will remain syn-
chronized to his aura.”
And since he’s drawing his god-
power from the ring, Karlini thought,
casting it off would leave the vitality of
his defenses collapsing - “I’m projecting
the disorientation barrage... here goes
the rest of the diversion package.”
“My master is being released,” Dor-
tonn said suddenly.
“What?
We’ve barely launched the
matrix piercer - I thought you said
nothing should be happening for an-
other three minutes!”
“I did say that, and it should have.
He has been released, but not at my
hand.”
“There are troops in the trees and
outside in the street,” Svin said sud-
denly.

The Scapula had shrugged off the
rest of the attack, although the wall
just behind him and an adjoining arc
of ﬂoor were still glowing red and pool-
ing into puddles.
This demonstrated
once again the value of superior plan-
ning, he reﬂected, and of moving fast
enough to stay ahead of the opposition.
If he had still been drawing on the
energy of the ring he would now most
likely be reeling and drained, ready
for Pod Dall to materialize and devour
his soul, or whatever it was about him
that might have attracted Pod Dall’s
interest. As it was instead, there was
no need for him to be interested in Pod
Dall any longer, not to say that such in-
terest as had previously been relevant
had been any wider than questions
of power level and tap schemata; Pod
Dall’s place in the balance of power

would for various reasons be neither
relevant nor important again.
But
of course, thanks to his maneuver at
the conclave the ring and Pod Dall
its contents had served their useful-
ness, and issues of power levels no
longer had any signiﬁcance at all. In
a literal sense, the Scapula now had
more power than he could productively
wield, but not of course more than he
knew what to do with.
Which didn’t mean the power was
worth wasting; he did have a Knitting
to elaborate, after all, and beyond that
other plans. The impending ceremony
of Knitting, however, was not the only
valid reason to abandon this place. His
adversaries might be feeble and cower
in his dust, but they were ahead of the
schedule he had anticipated.
If they
had been a few minutes earlier, in fact,
he might have had a real ﬁght on his

hands.
Moreover the ring was still bound
to his ﬁnger, even if the ﬁnger was
no longer bound to the rest of his
body.
They might think they could
still bridge the gap. If they were adept
enough with voodoo-style similarity
work, perhaps they actually could. The
fact that the ﬁnger was currently in in-
timate contact with the ﬂesh of another
should deﬂect their aim, however, since
contiguity usually trumped similarity,
and in any case once Pod Dall began to
materialize he would lock to whichever
living incarnate was closest to hand.
Fradjikan
was
still
making
gag-
ging sounds there on the ﬂoor as the
Scapula dashed through the door, hold-
ing his good hand tightly over the
small gusher on the other. Fortunately,
the paralysis of Fradjikan’s voluntary
muscles was preventing him from ac-

tually expelling the bolus the Scapula
had just wedged in his throat, and in
another moment or two it shouldn’t
matter.
Pod Dall would materialize,
he would appropriate Fradjikan’s body
as his incarnation vehicle - and then
the weakened Fradjikan, teetering on
the edge of death from his injuries and
the Scapula’s special ﬁeld of sapping
paralysis, would experience the last
of the Scapula’s carefully planned sur-
prises. But as he went over the abyss
to oblivion he would not go alone. The
now-incarnate Pod Dall, just emerged
from his shell, disoriented, and taken
unawares, would be going with him.
Fradjikan saw the Scapula leaving,
but his mind was on other things. He
wasn’t sure what had happened - why
the Scapula had suddenly interrupted
his peroration to perform such a de-
liberate act of auto-mutilation, or why

the Scapula had compounded that re-
pulsive move by jamming his gruesome
trophy into Fradi’s own mouth - but he
knew what was happening.
He was
choking to death.
The ring stuck on the ﬁnger was
ﬁrmly lodged in his throat. He could
feel the hot blood dripping down his
gullet; the ﬁnger itself was still warm.
And he was compounding his own prob-
lems - retching and gagging, his mouth
ﬁlling with bile, his body still on its
side but even more on his back, there
was no way to clean the ghastly mess
out of his windpipe so he could breathe.
His ears were roaring, red was march-
ing in from the corners of his vision;
he was well on the way to panic. But
then he was also in the midst of suffo-
cation. And it didn’t appear likely that
Vladimir, Lord of Storms, would be
available to resurrect him yet another

time.
His mouth was growing warmer, hot,
ﬁery - he barely had consciousness left
to recognize it wasn’t his mouth, it was
that ring, when something sizzled out
of the ring and slid smoothly up into
his head and out into his body, a tingly,
half-orgasmic sensation rather than
one wholly of pain, the narcosis of oxy-
gen deprivation perhaps but still it felt
like more than hallucination, it felt as
though he were being stroked by an
all-encompassing, soothing hand -
What a moment for a transcendental
experience.
But then unexpectedly that wasn’t
his last coherent thought after all.
Somehow he was on his side but now
facing the ﬂoor, and he was still retch-
ing but now enough of the gore had
drained to open a slight air passage,
and most surprisingly he was no longer

in the throes of panic; he now felt fully
narcotized. Although he no longer felt
fully himself, either - he was changing
- he was larger, greater, stronger - he
knew so many things, he knew-
His heart shuddered in his chest,
and stopped beating.
“Now do you see why the Scapula is
so dangerous?” said Gashanatantra.
“He was lucky.”
“Can you think of a worse sort of dan-
ger?”
Jill-tang sat next to him, both of
them on the divan in her reception
room but scarcely reclining in relax-
ation. Their four hands were tangled
in a cat’s-cradle of sparkling force lines,
weaving and tugging and braiding,
while in the midst of the spell ma-
trix an undulating image of the splat-
tered, eye-rolling Fradjikan wavered
beyond a cloud of status indicators.

The cloud was now showing an inky
black shot through with the streaks of
dying comets.
“Try this,” said Gash,
his ﬁngers tangling in the loom, as a
bulbous form the size of two ﬁsts co-
alesced from a converging cluster of
red.
Jill leaned carefully in and grasped
it with both hands. “Heart massage?”
she said.
“Here comes another shock, now!”
Gash muttered. The heart-simulacrum
convulsed, fell silent, then beat once,
forcefully.
“Now compress upward
from the apex, again, again -”
“Does he have enough of an airway?”
“Let me try shaking him again,” said
Gash. “At least we were able to shove
him over enough to drain – augh!”
“What?”
“Feedback, can’t feel my left hand.
Vladimir may be conﬁned but the

shields on his facility are still strong -
I don’t know how much longer I’ll be
able to maintain this connection. I -”
“Hold on anyway, dammit,” snarled
Jill. “I don’t want to lose Pod Dall, not
now!”
“Neither do I,” Gash said, his teeth
gritted.
It had been a lot of trouble
to stabilize Pod Dall to a stable rein-
carnation with his sanity intact. A lot
of trouble with no assurance of a pay-
off, but now - “Not with most everyone
locked in stasis and the Scapula riding
roughshod over the landscape. If -”
The matrix ﬂashed yellow, then blue;
a coruscating light-burst snapped out
from the center and collapsed, drag-
ging the force-lines back with it like a
ﬁshing net caught in a riptide. The suc-
tion yanked Gashanatantra from his
seat toward the imploding core. Matrix
lines wrenched his outstretched hands

like the cords of a mad puppeteer, rak-
ing his ﬂesh, twisting his bones, as
he tried throwing himself to the ﬂoor,
vocalizing the disengagement trigger.
Then the matrix ﬁnished falling into
itself and was gone.
Wisps of discon-
nected matrix hung twinkling in the
air, ﬂickering rapidly out.
“You look pretty well ﬂayed,” said
Jill, eyeing his hands.
“Serves you
right, you bastard.”
“Oh? And why is that?”
“You started this, when you trapped
Pod in that ring.”
“I didn’t start the Scapula,” Gashanat
muttered, levering himself up to ﬂop
back against the base of the couch.
“Would you mind very much lending
me a few bandages?”
“I suppose you’ll be wanting unguents
next, too, huh?
Oh, very well.
Wait
here.”

“You might as least give me some
credit for convincing you not to attend
the conclave.”
“Yes, why did you bother?” said Jill.
“As things worked out you would have
been free of me once and for all.”
“I didn’t know anything would hap-
pen. I was just being prudent.”
“Yes, but why be prudent with me?”
“Affairs are becoming more and more
hazardous, and the roster of potential
allies is diminishing rapidly. You’ve al-
ways been underrated. You’ve always
underrated yourself.”
“Why are you babbling?”
“I am not -”
“Yes, you are. Why?”
Gashanatantra sighed.
“You know
perfectly well why.
No matter how
you’ve treated me I still love you.”
“Are we -” said Tarfon, interrupting
her translation of the ancient words

scrolling behind the thick glass in the
secret room beneath the Archives, “are
we - are they going to let us live?
If
they ﬁnd out we know these things,
are they going to let us live?”
That same concern had already oc-
curred to the Archivist. Except - “Who
is ‘they’?” Leen said.
“The gods, I assume.”
“I thought your sect didn’t believe in
the gods,” Leen said absently.
“We believe in them, all right.
We
just don’t believe they’re gods.”
“If what we’ve seen here is any in-
dication,” said Leen, her distraction if
anything mounting, “your cult is due
for a big boost.”
“That we could live without.” Tarfon
sighed. “Nothing to be done about it,
though.” She turned back to the words,
then paused. How long had they been
here working? What time was it? “Um

- excuse me, but you’re a Nerve of the
Empire or something like that, aren’t
you?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Well, doesn’t that mean you’re sup-
posed to attend the Knitting?”
“Yes,” said Leen, making a sour face.
“One of those obligations of ofﬁce. I -
wait a minute - that’s still tonight, isn’t
it? That’s now.”
“I, ah, I think so.”
“Come along, then.
We’ll have to
continue this later.” The Knitting ...
the Scapula! Wouldn’t he be there? Of
course he would. Perhaps it would be
better not to go...
Well, of course it would be better
not to go.
But if he was there she
could probably elude him, in the press
of thousands, and she might still be
able to learn something of use.
And
it was the Knitting. Even the Scapula

wouldn’t be bold enough to try some-
thing nefarious there.
Would he?
“How the hell much longer we sup-
posed to stay out here diggin’ through
the trash?”
“Didn’t you hear her Godship? Until
we ﬁnd him, or we might as well not
bother coming back.”
The ﬁrst man, a grizzled campaigner
and veteran of more god-squads than
he cared to contemplate, set his feet
and truculently crossed his arms. “This
is it,” he declared. “This is it for me,
and if she wants to turn me into an
axolotl she can go the hell ahead. Be a
damn improvement.”
“Hey, c’mon, sarge,” said the second,
ﬁngering his neck.
“If she does for
you she’ll do more for me too; prob-
ably the whole lot of us by the time
she’s through. You want that on your

conscience, even if you are a newt?”
The older man glared up at his part-
ner, then down the next alley in front
of them.
The alley was little more
than a squeeze-crawl gap between
two buildings that snaked off away
from the street; garbage-choked and
offal-strewn in the same style they’d
waded through in, oh, the last ﬁfty
sites.
“There’s nothing in there alive
except things we’d have to kill,” he
growled.
“The guy’s got to be out here some-
where,” protested the trooper. “He can’t
have been eaten.”
“Why the hell not?
You remember
the size of those rats? Or dropped in
a sewer or slung in the Tongue, or -”
Considering a prayer, or better yet
some way of unambiguously distancing
himself, the younger man took a deep
breath and eased himself sideways

into the alley, probing ahead of him-
self with his sword. They had rousted
a few live scum-denizens already in
their search, and had uncovered two
bodies as well, but all of them, living
and dead, had possessed their full com-
plement of ﬁngers. They had also dealt
with the city’s thriving population of
urban beasts, mostly rats and dogs and
feral cats, but also a few less classiﬁ-
able things. The sword, therefore, was
clearly more than a formality.
It was getting well on into twilight
too. Here in this warren, where mid-
day sun would be an unaccustomed
surprise, it might as well have been
the middle of the night.
The trooper
lifted his lantern and peered ahead.
Had he heard something? Something
rather like a weak groan?
And that
long mound? No different from any of
the others they’d examined, surely, but

what was that gnarled silhouette lying
on top? Could it be a hand?
A hand missing one ﬁnger?
“Sarge, got something here you’re
gonna want to look at.”

Chapter14
THE SCAPULA HAD PULLED AN-
OTHER ONE, all right. He’d started
off by proclaiming that he had made
the entire assembly of gods at the pre-
Knitting conclave his prisoners, and as
I’d discovered myself that was clearly
true, but there was more to it than that.
A lot more.
The traditional uses for
prisoners - as hostages for ransom, say
- did not interest him in the least.
No, he was holding us so he could

drink our power.
How he’d managed it I had no idea.
It was obviously so tricky a move that
no one had ever thought of it before.
Something - obviously leakage from
Iskendarian, my local expert in every-
thing sorcerous - was trying to tell me
about a software virus in the virtual
conferencing code that kept partici-
pants from disengaging, with an auto-
locking vampire tap to drain individual
power into the captive net, but I didn’t
know what he was talking about.
It
was all just word soup to me.
What was self-evident as anything,
though, was that the Scapula had de-
clared war on the community of gods,
had conducted his own preemptive
strike against the majority of the gods
extant - and had already won. He was
the god among gods. This had not come
about under the scenario Protector of

Nature and Vladimir had planned,
of course, and since they had been
present too they were just as caught
as everyone else, but then who should
be surprised?
The Scapula’s favorite
tactic was clearly to make friends with
someone and then stab them as quickly
as possible in the back.
I could see folks around the volcano-
rim ballroom struggling and mutter-
ing and squirming as they tried with
complete lack of success to work them-
selves out of the Scapula’s trap. The
Scapula himself, after his brief mani-
festo, had disappeared to wreak who
knew what new devilment, not that
I could blame him for not wanting to
hang around and ﬁeld the impreca-
tions of his victims. And me? Well, I
was thinking.
My thoughts were not very pleasant.
I didn’t know how many of the others

around me had considered this yet, but
as long as their consciousnesses were
tied up here, their unsuperintended
bodies back in their hidden rooms and
easy chairs were not going to be getting
the care they needed. For one thing, if
this went on long enough they were
going to start dehydrating and might
even last long enough to starve. And
why wouldn’t this go on that long? If
the Scapula let these folks loose you
knew the ﬁrst thing they would head
for would be his throat.
I wasn’t sure I liked the alterna-
tive to that scenario any better. If the
Scapula could immobilize this many
gods, why couldn’t he backtrack down
the communication links to reveal the
location of their bodies, too? Then, if
he wanted, he could have his minions
force-feed them.
Them? Us. Although to be precise

I was something of an innocent by-
stander. I wasn’t a god, which is to say
Iskendarian wasn’t a god, but then it
was also now clear that not much dif-
ferentiated gods from anyone else with
enough power, the right resources, and
the bloody-mindedness to deploy them
at will.
Resources?
If you could use
the gods’ conferencing system, well,
you’d just be counted as a god when
the hammer came down.
I was also wondering who else among
my circle of acquaintances was trapped
here along with me. I hadn’t spotted
anyone obvious, and I didn’t partic-
ularly feel like strolling around the
plain peering into faces and trying to
divine who might be hiding behind
which facade.
Beyond that, I sup-
pose I was still waiting for another
shoe to drop.
I didn’t know whether
folks would start metamorphosing into

horrid tortured writhing shapes, or
whether they’d start popping out like
burst balloons, or whether the entire
environment would warp or explode or
fade, leaving each of us individually in
the Scapula’s private little hell. On the
other hand, however, I didn’t think we
were just going to sit here indeﬁnitely
with nothing happening.
As it was, I would just have to wait.
I didn’t know what else to do. What-
ever his other hazards, if Iskendarian
was awake he might at least have some
ideas, but –
Wait a minute. Iskendarian proba-
bly could be awake. I’d been trying so
hard to make sure he stayed asleep I’d
almost forgotten I could try the alter-
native. And if he were awake...
Well, what did I have to lose?
“Hey, Iskendarian!” I thought. “Isky!
You in there?”

For a moment I lost my train of
thought. I didn’t lose consciousness the
way I had earlier when Iskendarian
had begun to emerge, but my thoughts
were suddenly...
muddled, unclear.
Then I remembered what I was doing.
I had a residual mental image of a
ﬁshing pond containing a striped bass.
It had rippled the surface once; now, if I
cast my line properly and could remem-
ber to keep my grip on the rod -
“Iskendarian!” I hollered in my head.
“Rise and shine!”
Again my thoughts swam. This time,
though, they were being shouldered
aside - I was growing vague, diffuse,
like I’d been on a sudden three-day
bender without the beneﬁt of enjoying
the taste of the brew going down, my
vision was gone, my ears were roaring,
I - where was I? What was going on?
“Ah!” someone said, I seemed to be

overhearing somewhere off in the fog.
“At last, here I - what? What is this? I
-”
There was one thing left in my mind,
a thing I had been repeating over and
over to myself like a mantra, I didn’t
know what it was or who I was or much
of anything, but there was something I
should be doing with this mantra, now
what was it? How about -
Clamps closed on my head and
swung it around, that voice that had
been howling at me abruptly zoomed
off into the distance, growing faint
and echo-y just before it seemed to fall
off a cliff and vanish; it felt as though
something with claws was scooping out
chunks of my ﬂesh and hurling them
over the cliff after it; I could see around
me vaguely now a small reeling room
where I was sitting in an armchair,
or, no, I wasn’t sitting in the chair, I

was falling out of it, falling toward
the ﬂoor but it didn’t look like ﬂoor,
it looked like a deep dark spinning
pit; and while some part of me was
noting I had indeed activated the emer-
gency release mechanism and it had
worked, leaving Iskendarian caught in
the Scapula’s trap, and under cover of
his squirming I had managed to ooze
away myself instead; another part of
me was -
“It’s the Hand,” whispered the Great
Karlini.
“I’ve never run across them
myself, they were always Max’s own
running sore, but he described them
well enough.” He had shimmied his
way along the ﬂoor of Shaa’s second-
story living room and carefully raised
himself to peer over the lower edge of
the window frame without rufﬂing the
curtains.
“They are in the back garden too,”

said Svin, reappearing from the rear of
the ﬂat. “Those crossbow men climbing
the trees may be deploying to cover an
assault from the roof.”
“How many do you ﬁgure there are?”
“I have counted forty-three,” Svin
told him. “It is likely there are more.”
“I have had my ﬁll of you fanatics,”
Dortonn rasped suddenly. “What will
it be next with you, the descent of ﬁery
archangels?”
“Just what do you intend to do in-
stead?” asked Karlini.
“It looks like
they’re gearing up for an assault out
there.
Maybe if we’re lucky they’ll
give us a come-out-with-your-hands-
up ﬁrst.”
“Perhaps a blast-and-run,” said Dor-
tonn belligerently.
“Perhaps I will
merely die and spare myself this fool-
ishness.”
“To die have threatening long been

you,” Haddo croaked, scuttling brieﬂy
out from under an end table. “If to die
want you, to die already please proceed.
Else if, helpful plan you be.”
“Helpful,” Dortonn snorted.
“Very
well.
I will continue attempting to
contact my master. Perhaps he is not
beyond reach or rescue, regardless of
your vast incompetence.”
“Whatever you want,” said Karlini,
“but the Hand are jamming transmis-
sions.
I can’t even raise Shaa.
Max
said their sorcerer was pretty good.”’
“But
prone
to
overreaching,”
re-
minded Wroclaw, “and consequent er-
ror.”
“Did Shaa have a secret exit out of
this place? Anybody know?”
“Rental is it,” said Haddo. “Passage
of secrets is not average lease property
equipped.”
“What about that pal of yours, Haddo?

Karlini asked. “Favored-of-the-Gods.”
Haddo did not sound pleased. “Told
me did Favored unavailable would he
be. Obligations has Favored others to.”
“Great, just great.” The ﬁrst time
Karlini had met Favored he’d gotten
the impression the little green guy
wouldn’t mind seeing the lot of them
dead, with the exception of Haddo; his
inaction might help to win him that
wish. “Anyone else got a helpful plan
in mind, then?”
“Blast,” declared Svin.
“Blast and
ﬁght.”
“Oh, come on, Svin,” said Karlini,
“you can do better than that.
Don’t
give us that simple barbarian junk.
You’re the closest we’ve got to a mili-
tary advisor, right?”
Svin had squirmed forward to join
Karlini at the front window.
“They
do not seem aware we know they are

here,” he observed.
“Do you see that
small group down the block, the three
who appear to be arguing?
Can you
overhear what they are saying?”
“Without tipping them off,” mused
Karlini.
That should be no prob-
lem.
A directional surveillance spell,
low-order, not even affecting the trio
themselves directly,
just amplifying
the sound waves that - okay, let’s see
now... “The one who’s talking is saying
this is a waste of time, they should
be out rounding up the real terror-
ists before they pull some stunt the
Scapula doesn’t know about that comes
back and bites everybody in the - now
he’s just cursing; that one must be
the Hand’s battle commander, Romm
V’Nisa. Now one of the others, I’d imag-
ine the leader, Gadol V’Nora, is trying
to cut him off, saying how many times
does he have to remind him they’ve

been hired, they work for the Scapula,
they’re doing a job, does Romm want
them to go back to starving in the hills
so he can practice his own strategies
again?”
Karlini was getting into their rhythm
“This is Romm: ‘Use your brain then
for a minute, why don’t you?
Why
didn’t the Scapula release extra men
for us to do this job properly? You’ve
seen the way he operates - he’s using
us to tie up his loose end and get our-
selves cut apart at the same time; then
he doesn’t have to worry about us be-
ing a loose end either.’ Gadol: ‘But you
know he’s promised us a long-term en-
gage -’ Romm: ‘You idiot! You’ve heard
the stories coming in.
He treats his
allies worse than his enemies. Even if
we take out Max’s pals and we’re still
standing afterwards, who’s he got to
throw back next? Even if we had Max

on our side again we’d be lucky to get
out of this city alive.’ ‘I won’t tolerate
this kind of -’ ‘Get your head out of your
-’ Oh, now here’s the third one, Chas
V’Halila, the sorcerer:
‘Romm has a
point.
We should think this through
again, before we launch the attack. We
have Max’s friends penned up, they’re
not going anywhere.
Yes, we were
ordered to be standing by for the Knit-
ting, but that still leaves us plenty of
time to resolve the situation here, so
what do we have to lose?’ Gadol: ‘Both
of you, now, questioning my judgment,
undermining my -’ Romm: ‘Absolutely
correct, O illustrious leader.’”
“Gadol is the one stalking away?”
said Svin.
“Yes,” Karlini said, “I think so.”
“You wait here,” Svin told him, “lis-
ten for any more interesting news. Pre-
pare a spell to take down the trees with

the climbers. Do you see the men with
the grappling hooks? They will be the
ones who plan to swing to the roof.”
“And you?”
“I will help the others fortify the
doors.”
“So we are agreed,” Shaa said. “There
are no indications, not even the slight-
est, that any experimental material
has survived the destruction here at
the laboratory.
Yes, Tildamire?
Yes,
Jurtan?”
“Uh, Shaa?” said Jurtan, ﬁghting
a reﬂex to raise his hand ﬁrst; Shaa
always made him feel as though he
was in class.
“What if there’s still
some of these microorganisms left,
only there’re so few of them we can’t
detect them? Couldn’t they still cause
trouble, I mean if they start to multiply
after we leave? If they could really be
all that dangerous wouldn’t it be safer

to...”
“To what?
Cauterize the neighbor-
hood? Evacuate and quarantine?”
“Uh,” Jurtan said. “Oh.”
“Actually, if I could,” said Shaa, “I
would, just to be on the safe side. At
the moment, though, an attempt to
test our good will with the civic author-
ities would be most likely worse than
unsuccessful, and I shy from demol-
ishing a district without removing the
inhabitants ﬁrst. What we can do at
present is mount a watch, and proceed
to the next agenda item.”
Tildamire
had
been
glancing
at
him, then looking away whenever she
thought he might be detecting her
gaze; she had not yet realized Shaa
was the proud owner of the proverbial
eyes in the back of his head. Now she
spoke, albeit with hesitation.
“Aren’t
you pushing too hard?
I mean, your

heart...”
“I am feeling surprisingly ﬁt,” Shaa
told her. “Beyond which, the exhilara-
tion of present freedom is all the impe-
tus I need. Yet even so there is the goad
of responsibility and the lash of duty.”
“You sounded downright grim just
now,” Jurtan volunteered.
“Titanic forces unleashed do that to
me.
This is not all fun and a stroll
in the park.” Was he getting a bit on
edge? Yes, he was. But then the one
he was waiting for was unambiguously
overdue.
“So now what?” said Jurtan.
He would have to speak to Jurtan
about that late-adolescent truculence,
but this was probably not the best
time.
Instead, Shaa said, “I would
recommend the Knitting.”
Tildamire sighed. “I know you mean
well, but I don’t really feel like going

to another big extravaganza right now.
And anyway it isn’t for hours yet -
doesn’t it start at midnight? I -”
“It is a long way from Roosing
Oolvaya,” Shaa stated, “and who knows
when there will be another Knitting?”
If ever, he added to himself; with his
brother involved, anything was possi-
ble. “It is considered one of the won-
ders of organized civilization.”
“Why aren’t you going, then?”
“Did I say that? I wouldn’t miss it for
the world, especially under the present
circumstances. There are certain other
items that should be attended to ﬁrst,
however, and a changing of the guard.”
“You mean that watcher you men-
tioned?”
“Just so. I expected Wroclaw. Unfor-
tunately he seems well overdue.” Per-
haps it was time for a call to Karlini.
He raised his hand for quiet, probed

for Karlini’s recognition signal... huh.
No busy, no carrier - jammed? “Follow
me,” Shaa said, breaking into a jog. “It
seems Karlini may have called down
someone’s wrath upon his head.”
Leen hadn’t even made it as far as
her desk before beginning the list of
questions she should have asked the
oracle but had failed to think of at
a convenient time.
Still, she had re-
solved not to let her thoughts interfere
with her forward momentum, deter-
mined to be on time and fully prepared
for once at some affair of state. Then
just short of the door to the recessional
path her catalog expanded to include
yet another item and she came to an
abrupt halt, her hand raised to deliver
the initiatory command. Tarfon, who
had been lagging warily behind, alert
to any sign of wavering attention that

might rebound against her, stopped as
well, and waited.
She had promised Shaa, Leen was
thinking, but mere gathering of infor-
mation didn’t imply action.
The like-
lihood of pertinent information was
clearly low, too; the computer had most
probably been put into place before the
catacombs of the Archives, so what it
might know about lost secret passages
was presumably small.
But it should be easy enough to ask.
Tarfon found herself being seized by
the arm and dragged back into the
stacks.
“The Knitting? -” she said.
“Plenty of time,” Leen told her.
“I
checked the clock at my desk; plenty of
time.” And there weren’t any forgotten
nephews left behind this go-around to
mess up her plans, either.
A few moments later they were back

in the computer room. “Ask it,” Leen
demanded, “what it knows about the
ﬂoor plan of the palace complex.”
“Okay,” said Tarfon.
She tapped
away on the keyboard. “I - oh, my.”
The entire space behind the thick
window in the wall had come to life.
“That’s not just the palace, that’s this
whole end of the city,” said Leen.
“That’s quite a map - look at all that
detail.”
“Too much detail. Can we focus in on
just the area around the Archives?”
“I think so,” Tarfon ventured.
A
blinking rectangle appeared at the cor-
ner of the map; by touching a group
of keys bearing arrow-icons she was
able to steer the marquee around the
image.
“There,” Leen said.
“No, a little to
the left - now you’re over the Archives.”
And the image was grabbing the near-

est corner of the dungeons too.
The selected area swelled up to ﬁll
the window. “Can we ﬁnd out how re-
cently this information was updated?”
Leen asked.
“It looks fairly recent...”
There were the Front and Back Door
paths with their winding, serpentine
coils; and on the wider overview she
had glimpsed, in dotted lines of a paler
green, the foundations of the new ofﬁce
block even now under construction.
Tarfon looked up. “It says revision
goes on constantly. It must have spies -
sensors - all through the palace.”
“It would have to have its agents in
the air.” What would she and Tarfon
have seen if they’d asked for the entire
city? Or the world?
This oracle was a treasure house
anyone with an
interest in power
would kill to control.
But she had it, and she wasn’t ﬁn-

ished with it, either.
“Can it show
Max’s cell in the dungeon?”
Taptaptaptap.
“...
It says it’s pro-
cessing the request. You know, if this
machine can really deliver this sort of
information -”
“I know.”
“Um, you still wouldn’t kill me for
knowing about this... would you?”
“I doubt it,” said Leen. “If I did that
I’d have to kill myself too, now wouldn’t
I? If -”
One of the tiny green room-outlines
off at the corner of the window had be-
gun a blinking a bright green. “It says
it’s ﬁnished processing,” Tarfon said
superﬂuously, eyeing another box at
the window’s base containing another
sprawl of cryptic text.
I really must learn this thing’s lan-
guage, Leen told herself again.
“Re-
lease him,” she said. “I mean, tell the

computer to release him.”
Tarfon hesitated.
“You mean - are
you sure - I, ah, we don’t know if this
machine can actually do things - how
it might decide to carry out a command
like that even if it could -”
“There’s one good way to ﬁnd out,
isn’t there?”
Taking a deep breath, Tarfon typed
again, slowly and deliberately, then
continued to hold her breath as the
oracle spelled out its response.
“It
says, ‘Librarian access privilege insuf-
ﬁcient’,” she read.
Leen realized she too had been hold-
ing her breath.
She let it out now,
meticulously. “I assume we can infer
from that response that it can take
actions, it just won’t take them for me.
Very well.
Ask it to show any pas-
sages running from the Archives to the
dungeon.”

This
time
the
oracle
responded
quickly.
“I suspected there might be
one or two,” Leen murmured,
“but
this?” She stared at the new tangle of
green spaghetti. “Does it have one it
recommends?”
The snarl was swept away; one puls-
ing jagged trace remained. “It’s warn-
ing of a deadfall, a pit, and three false
turns,” said Tarfon, in some amaze-
ment.
This was important information, re-
alized Leen, critical information, in
fact... but only if she actually intended
to traverse this path.
Did she?
She
had promised Shaa...
But neither of them had anticipated
this stroke of fortune.
“Manifested himself as Iskendarian.”
Max scowled toward the ceiling. Damn
that Phlinn Arol - where was the rest of

the story? He’d tossed Max the tagline
and then bugged out like the cheapest
purveyor of cheap ﬁction.
What had
happened next?
And here he was, to
coin a phrase, still stuck in this dun-
geon.
Max wanted to cross his arms, put
a world-beating scowl on his face, and
sulk.
Or better yet, get out on the
street and start taking an active part
in events. He could wield powers from
the second quantum level, after all,
or he could if he wasn’t under all this
shielding, and even if he couldn’t wield
them he could still deploy his brain.
But here he was instead, not even
able to do that much, what with the
interference from that diabolical mind-
scrambling shrieker,
and a lack of
enough facts from the outside world.
Was it time for the Knitting yet?
There was no day or night here in

this basement cell, of course, but in
the outside world it must be getting
on into evening, at least.
Between
wails from his personal torture system
Max had been reviewing the few facts
at his disposal, and his much wider
knowledge of the Scapula’s past his-
tory and predilections. He would have
happily given more consideration to
the question of the Creeping Sword
and Iskendarian as well, and whatever
might be happening with the Karlinis
and the lab, if his old friend Phlinn
had bothered to give him some ac-
tual useful information on the subjects
rather than a gratuitous half-turn of
additional tension on his current rack
of mental cruciation.
Even so, the
Iskendarian connection could be ﬁg-
ured into the equation. In particular,
the foremost issue that had been oc-
cupying Max’s attention was that of

synchronicity. Why had all these sepa-
rate threads taken the same moment
to come to a head?
Did that mean
that the establishing postulate itself
should be reexamined - the idea that
the threads were indeed separate? The
Scapula was surpassingly clever, that
much was surely a given, but was even
he all-encompassing enough to have
orchestrated half the known world?
That was likely taking things a bit
far. Nevertheless, the Scapula’s timing
was rarely less than impeccable. Since
he had chosen the day of the Knitting
to make his move, one could scarcely
imagine that correspondence to be a co-
incidence.
So what did he have planned for the
Knitting?
Again Max heard the abrupt clank
from the doorway, then felt the rush
of air from the swing of the thick door

itself.
Again Phlinn Arol hove into
his line of sight.
This time, though,
Phlinn wasn’t stalking conﬁdently to-
ward Max, he was virtually backing
into the room,
or so his contorted
posture from craning back over his
shoulder and trying to make forward
progress at the same time made it ap-
pear.
“What’s the matter now,” said
Max, “haunted by your evil ways?
I
think I’ve spent more time with you
and accomplished less in the last day
than in -”
“Shut up, Max,” Phlinn Arol snapped.
“I -”
Okay, so Phlinn was nervous.
But
Max was pretty annoyed, too.
“You
here for me to help you vent your soul
again?
You want me to do anything
but glower, you can start by telling
me the rest of the story behind this
Iskendarian bit.”

“That
doesn’t
matter
now,”
said
Phlinn Arol. “He is out of the picture.
He has been captured by the Scapula.”
“It doesn’t surprise me that the
Scapula is capturing people, but why
him?”
“Him and most everyone else. Some-
thing quite terrible has occurred. Now
sweep that chip off your shoulder and
listen.”
“I -” Then Max took another look at
the expression on Phlinn Arol’s face.
Phlinn wasn’t just nervous, he was
barely one side of panic, and which
side was difﬁcult right at the moment
to tell. “I’m listening.”
Phlinn Arol was running the hand
on his less injured arm through his
hair.
If the disarray inside the head
matched the rat’s-nest on it, Phlinn
was in a very bad way indeed.
“I
don’t understand how he could have

managed it,” said Phlinn. “They can’t
break out of the conclave.
None of
them. They’re all trapped.”
“The Scapula’s got everyone who was
at the conclave trapped?”
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell
you. He’s worse than a menace, he’s -
he’s -”
“He never works small when he can
help it, that’s for sure,” Max said. “I
take it you weren’t in attendance? You
-” The noisemaker behind his head let
loose with another bloodcurdling cater-
wauling ﬁt.
“Look, you want to turn
that thing off, so we can maybe hear
each other speak?”
“What? Oh, yes, of course.”
While Phlinn tinkered with the de-
vice, Max’s mind was still rolling. “You
decided not to go?” he went on. “What
about the Emperor, is he trapped too?
And if you weren’t there how did you

ﬁnd out what had happened?”
“No, I didn’t go, and yes, I’ll give you
some credit, I did take your advice, al-
though I was inclined in that direction
to start with. The Emperor-designate
was a more difﬁcult matter. He is of
the
command-from-the-front
school.
The more potential danger the Scapula
was advertised as presenting, the more
the Emperor desired to confront him
directly to make his own assessment.
But no, he was not in the event present
for the Scapula’s triumph.”
“How did you work that?”
“A sleeping draught,” admitted Phlinn
“I was running out of time and ideas.
He was determined, but he was wrong.”
“Might have served him right,” Max
suggested.
“Do you really think so?
He may
make a good Emperor, once his im-
petuous and pigheaded streaks are

brought under control, but whatever
his qualities I submit that throwing
the succession into confusion would
only accelerate the current slide to-
ward anarchy.
I don’t know that the
Scapula would have taken him hostage
too, but I wouldn’t put it past him to
have had some provision for the Em-
peror in his plan.”
“Neither would I. The Scapula’s been
riding full-tilt across every convention
and treaty the gods have lived by. And
not only the gods - which covenant
does the Emperor ﬁgure most directly
in himself?”
“Just so. But do you think even the
Scapula would dare to proclaim him-
self Emperor? A god-king incarnate vi-
olates every -”
“It sure does,” said Max.
“I don’t
know if he really would or not, but he
sure isn’t sparing much effort to make

us think he would. I suppose it’s still
too much to ask to call off the Knitting;
like you said you’ve got a pigheaded
beneﬁciary and additional destabiliza-
tion to worry about.”
“I’m not convinced I wouldn’t trade
this Emperor for a broken Scapula at
this point, but yes. There. This device
that’s been annoying you is deactivated
forever. Don’t bother to thank -”
“Huh. Just how many of you-all did
escape Arznaak’s trap?”
“Not many,” Phlinn Arol said grimly.
“He still has a standing broadcast on
the network inviting others to the con-
clave, but I don’t think he’ll snare
anyone else; the alert has gone out as
well.” Phlinn shook his head vigorously,
as though trying to dislodge a colony
of moths. “I still don’t understand how
he could have accomplished all this.”
“You got to look at the infrastructure

that allows your telepresence confer-
encing; somehow he got into that and
poisoned it. Look - these god meetings
don’t just happen - there’s some under-
lying carrier mechanism. Right?”
“I - I suppose so,” Phlinn said. “I’ve
never really thought about it.”
“You and most of those other dopes
you call gods, you bet. They just ﬁgure
it’s there, so you use it.
But some-
body thought about how that system
works, all right.
I bet it’s not the
only thing they’ve thought about, ei-
ther.
The intergod communications
network?
You’d better consider that
compromised too. Maybe he can’t lock
you up the same way, but you’d bet-
ter assume he can overhear anything
you’re saying. And let’s see, what other
little toys do you guys use? How about
-”
“Enough for now, Max, please.”

“It’s not enough,” Max said, “there’s
more - there’s another part of the an-
swer to your question; the ‘how did
he do this?’
one.
Arznaak’s not a
deep technical thinker. He’s a master
schemer, no doubt about it, but this
kind of guts-of-the-world engineering
just isn’t the way his mind works. He
either found some old reference that
describes how to do these things or he’s
got a confederate. Who might be able
to do the legwork who’s unaccounted
for?”
“I - I don’t know. I’ll have to give it
some thought. But what does he intend
to do with his hostages?”
“For one thing, they’re not hostages
- you can bet he’s not holding them for
ransom. He can never let them loose
and expect to live, remember?
Let’s
see... here’s some possibilities. Start
off assuming he wants to take over,

wants to be the only god around, or
the supreme god anyway - having the
former big-cheese gods toady to him
would be just his kind of satisfaction.
So, a preemptive strike, obviously, and
now he’s just about won almost before
he’s begun.
But does it end there?”
Max stared into space for a moment.
“Could he be drawing power from the
ones he’s got conﬁned? He is, isn’t he.”
“...Yes,” said Phlinn Arol,
“he is.
That is what he says. I have received
a personal message from him. A mes-
sage of friendship and conciliation. He
invites me to join him as an equal to
help him rule the world.”
“That’s it? Anybody else get one of
these messages?”
“I don’t know, Max. I -”
“Wait a minute. Does he mention me
in this message? He knows you’re as-
sisting the Emperor and he knows the

Emperor’s got me locked up; that was
his plan, right? Does he want you to
deliver me to him?”
“He didn’t mention that,” Phlinn
said.
“He could be trying to disarm
my suspicions and draw me within his
grasp.”
“Damn right,” Max told him. “If he’s
trying to butter you up that means you
could be his next target. You’ve seen
how he operates. So what do you want
to do? What’s your plan?”
“I suppose I could impose a geas
on every adventurer in town,” mused
Phlinn Arol,
the Adventurers’ God,
“set them to storm the Scapula and
bring back his head. Of course all that
would yield is a pile of dead adven-
turers, wouldn’t it, and the Scapula’s
unmistakable enmity. I could send the
Emperor to face the Knitting alone
while I quit Peridol for some sunny

southern climate, but that would only
serve the Emperor up to him while not
making me any less a target. More of a
target, if anything, since demonstrated
cowardice would show I was ready to
be swept from the board.” He shrugged.
“Even if you called it a strategic re-
deployment,
what
advantage
could
regrouping offer?
What other allies
would there be to seek who are not
available now?
What additional re-
sources could I ﬁnd?
“Or I could put you back into play.”
“I thought the Emperor wasn’t going
to like that,” Max said sarcastically.
“At the moment the Emperor is not
my greatest concern.”
“Well, setting me loose is the course
of action I’d recommend. I’ve been sug-
gesting it ever since I got here, if you
recall. At least you’ve ﬁnally come to
your -”

“I’m not turning you free,” stated
Phlinn Arol.
“You will be on a leash.
You will come with me to the Knit-
ting. Afterward we will see where the
situation lies. Will you do this?”
“This may be exactly what Arznaak
is planning on,” said Max.
“Sending
you that message, trying to panic you
into bringing me out where he can pul-
verize me once and for all.”
“Or he could assume you’ll be here
alone in the dungeon during the Knit-
ting, without me to protect you. Will
you do this for me?
Are you ﬁnally
afraid of the Scapula?”
“I’ve always been afraid of the Scapula
Anything else means you’re living in a
dream. Yeah, I’ll back you up. But just
what help do you think I can give you?
How much good you think an expert
consultant on Arznaak is going to be if
he cuts loose?”

Phlinn Arol’s expression of concern
was suddenly broken by a brief and
rather unpleasant grin.
“You have
been very clever, Maximillian, but I
have been watching you for a long time;
more closely even than the Scapula,
perhaps. You have mastered some of
the tricks of the second quantum level,
yes?
You have sought to destroy the
gods, hmm? I offer you Arznaak.”
“He’s in fairly sorry condition,” said
Gashanatantra, gazing down at the co-
matose form of Jardin, just dragged in
by Jill’s troops, “but at least he’s alive;
that’s something. Now all we have to
do is get him in shape to talk.”
“Keep your hands off him,” Jill-tang
spat.
“He’s already been tortured
enough without you using your ‘meth-
ods’ on him too.”
“There may not be many of us not un-
der the Scapula’s claw,” Gash pointed

out. “Those of us left are natural allies.”
He spread his hands. “Very well, I’m
won’t interfere with him...
although
any information he might be able to
provide could help us all . Time may
be critical before the Scapula strikes
at us here.”
Jill snorted. “How could he reach us
here? This is my sanctum, remember?
We’re shielded behind -”
“How could he have done anything
he’s done? It’s prudent to assume every
extra moment puts us in greater haz-
ard. But you have said not to work on
Jardin, so my arms remain folded.”
“If you say you love me, why do you
always act like such a bastard?”
“I treat you the same way I treat ev-
eryone,” said Gashanatantra. “Better,
actually, if you want to know the truth.
I seem to be a little old to change my
nature.”

“You know I’ve been with Jardin,”
Jill said.
“Why have you done even
this much to save him? So you can pull
him to pieces now at your own pace?”
“Perhaps I have been changing my
nature
after
all,”
Gash
murmured.
“You’ve been happy with him, yes?
At least relatively?” He shrugged.
“I
may be jealous, but I’m not a psy-
chopath. I’m glad for you to be happy;
why should I destroy that?
He is an
idiot, and if you come to realize that
too I’ll be ready, but why should I
make you hate me all over again by
- well, enough said, perhaps.” Gash
coughed.
“I’ve also just described to
you where I think our self-interest lies,
as well. Then there is the off-chance
that Jardin has been in some manner
booby-trapped.”
“You can’t be serious,” began Jill. “...
Do you really think so?”

“No, not really; if he was a trap the
Scapula wouldn’t have made it so hard
for us to ﬁnd him, or might even have
have had him dropped off at the door.
Still, we surely haven’t seen the last of
his cleverness.”
“I don’t love him,” Jill said abruptly.
“I don’t think I love you, but I certainly
don’t love Jardin. And he is an idiot.
You’d better do what you can to wake
him up.”

Chapter15
“ARE THE HANDS STILL BICKER-
ING?” asked Svin, insinuating himself
silently back at Karlini’s side at his ob-
servation post at the window of Shaa’s
ﬂat.
“They’re still trying to decide whether
to immolate us or enlist us as allies,”
Karlini told him.
“How are our de-
fenses?”
“Shaa has a well-stocked pantry,”
Svin said. “Wroclaw is boiling his cook-

ing oil in a succession of large pots.
Haddo is smearing toxic ointments
and muttering something about birds.
I have shifted furniture.”
“And Dortonn?”
“He has not died, despite his pro-
nouncements. He claims to be attempt-
ing to raise his god.”
“I guess anything’s possible,” Karlini
grumbled. “There’s no point in a pre-
emptive attack against them, is there?”
“How badly do you want to attend
the Knitting?”
“Not that badly.”
“Then no. Unless you wish to speed
all our deaths.”
“Maybe we’d better ask that of Dor-
tonn,” said Karlini. “Was he like this
when he was running things back at
your home in the north?”
“Dortonn
likes
ruling
people
too
much to give up and die,” Svin told

him.
“He also seems to like revenge.”
“That is true,” said Svin. “Revenge is
a tradition of the north.”
“Why should the north be any differ-
ent?”
“Survival is also a tradition of the
north,” Svin added, ignoring Karlini’s
comment. “Dortonn is smart. He will
not betray us to the Hand. I have made
a bargain with him. I have forsworn
my oath of revenge against him. When
we are ﬁnished in Peridol I will escort
him back to the north. I will speak for
him to our people. I will explain how
he has changed his ways.”
“What
if
he
hasn’t
changed
his
ways?”
“Then I will kill him anyway.” Svin
hesitated. “Perhaps I have been in civ-
ilization too long.
Now I make deals
with the one I was sent to destroy. Now

I even wonder whether the elders sent
me because they thought I was the one
who would ask no questions.
Now I
wonder whether my whole mission was
not just more politics.”
“Politics is the oldest sport there is,”
said Karlini.
“You - wait a minute,
there’s something new happening out-
side.”
“What’s that down there?” said Jur-
tan Mont.
“It appears to be a cordon,” Shaa ob-
served. The three of them had turned
back onto the block containing Shaa’s
ﬂat only to ﬁnd ahead of them block-
ing the street a torch-lit perimeter
of stretched cord backed by a pair of
watchful pikemen. Others garbed for
battle were maneuvering beyond the
barricade. “I wonder what it’s here for,”
he added superﬂuously.
There were still a few neighbors

milling around outside the guarded
area, but it stood to reason that most
of the residents of the district - along
with the larger part of Peridol’s inhab-
itants - were either making their way
toward the giant stadium of the Knit-
ting or otherwise preparing themselves
for behaving riotously on the night of
festivity now beginning. The number
of people on the other side of the bar-
rier, though, signiﬁcantly outweighed
the count of spectators. In addition to
the forces on the ground eyeing his own
building from various positions of con-
cealment, Shaa could pick out a good
half-dozen more perched precariously
in the foliage of trees.
It did not appear, however, that any-
one was gearing themselves for immi-
nent assault. Instead, Shaa observed
what appeared to be a command dis-
cussion, or more accurately argument,

being conducted only a few yards be-
yond the roadblock. “Are you receiving
any messages from the inﬁnite?” Shaa
asked Jurtan Mont.
Mont had been standing in his habit-
ual posture, a sort of eager foxhound
stance with his head cocked slightly to
one side, eyes ﬂoating and vague. He
was listening for his spoor rather than
snifﬁng it out, however, plugged into
who-knew-what currents of the ether.
No god had stepped forward to claim
Jurtan as his oracle, which of course
proved nothing one way or the other,
but whether his talent was a deliber-
ate benison or an ability innate was
thoroughly immaterial to the matter
of its utility.
“Strings,” Jurtan Mont
said, “being plucked and plonked; lots
of strings, with some soft horns in the
back.”
“Tiptoe music,” observed Shaa. “Yet

nothing overtly menacing. Yes?”
“What are you up to?” Tildamire
asked warily.
“What are you plan-
ning?”
“We shall see,” said Shaa.
“Wait
here.”
“Just a -” began Tildy. But Shaa was
gone.
“I thought only Max did those
quick disappearances,” she said, glanc-
ing around.
“Over there,” her brother said, nod-
ding down the cross-boulevard they’d
used for their approach.
The side of
the property whose front extended
ahead of them behind the barricade
was fenced from the thoroughfare by
a brick wall lined with bushes.
Be-
tween two of the gas streetlights that
had ﬂared to life during their dash
back from the laboratory site ﬂick-
ered an ascending shadow, if you were
looking in exactly the right direction.

“With Shaa and Max and those guys I
sometimes wonder who taught whom,”
Jurtan added, obviously concentrating
on matching his tenses up properly,
Tildamire noted.
It was exhilarating, Shaa acknowl-
edged as he dropped to the garden
beyond the wall, to be doing this sort
of stuff again, less uncertain of his
limitations. For the moment, at least,
his limitations were constant, liable if
anything to become less onerous as he
built up his strength; his health and
the status of his heart were unlikely to
spiral down the nearest drain through
his own activities bringing into play
the sting of the curse, at any rate. Did
this mean he no longer had to worry
about that absurdly gratuitous clause
to the curse, that he would only fall in
love while on some adventure?
Well,
he had always considered life in and

of itself to be an adventure, but had
also made a point of refraining from
falling in love out of general principles.
Of course that had been Max’s princi-
ple too and look what had happened
to him, going clearly head-over-heels
for the Archivist, Leen.
And she for
him, which helped, if you were going
to do that sort of thing in the ﬁrst
place; Shaa’s resolve to stay clear of
the application notwithstanding,
he
was clear on the theory.
Shaa won-
dered if Leen had managed to restrain
her inclination to spring Max loose.
Well, they’d know soon enough. With
Max’s instinct for trouble, if he were on
the streets he’d probably be showing
up here at a moment perfectly timed to
gum up the works.
Shaa gazed carefully past another
band of shrubbery and through the
barred gate at the front of the prop-

erty.
The barricade and its guards
were to the right, the three quarreling
commanders were ahead of him, and
he was well within earshot of their
scarcely whispered conference.
So...
they were the Hand, were they. And
their discussion was as relevant as
Shaa had suspected it might be.
He
waited until the three of them had
reached a momentary impasse, and
had drawn back to glare at each other
above belligerently folded arms, then
vaulted lightly over the low gate and
strolled closer. “Gentlemen,” Shaa said,
“I believe I have something worthwhile
to contribute to your deliberations. Es-
pecially seeing as it is my apartment
to which you are laying siege, and my
brother who is your employer.”
“He’s talking to them,” said Tildamire
“He’s crazy - they’re going to kill him!
We have to do something!”

“Let’s wait a minute and see what
happens,” her brother said.
“I don’t
hear any sort of mounting crescendo,
nothing that’d make me think they’re
gonna swing right into action.”
“But look at all those soldiers -
they’re surrounding Shaa’s building!
Who do you think they’re after if not
him? What is he doing, trying to sac-
riﬁce himself to save the rest of them
still in there?”
“You’ve never really seen Shaa with
all his stops pulled out, have you?” Ju-
rtan asked, with a sidelong glance at
his sister. “His deadliest weapon is his
tongue.
When he’s ﬁnished with you
you’re not sure of your own name, or
whether you actually got up that morn-
ing.”
“There’s only one person you could
possibly be describing,” said a new
voice,
behind
them
and
somewhat

above their heads.
It was a voice Jurtan recognized, one
remarkably like Zalzyn Shaa’s, only
pitched an octave or so higher. “Eden!”
he exclaimed,
wheeling around,
al-
ready looking up to search the trees
to discover her lurking-place.
It was
not necessary to bring foliage into ac-
count, however, for the woman who
also looked strikingly like Shaa was in
the act of swinging off her horse. “You
escaped the curse, too!”
“Looks that way,” said Eden, tak-
ing in the barricade and its associated
company of troops, “for now at least.
What’s Zolly gotten himself into this
time?
You guys have been keeping
yourselves pretty busy, haven’t you -
this your sister?”
“You might as well introduce me as
well,” said yet another person, also on
horse, but concealed until now on the

farther side of Eden, “seeing as how we
all may be ﬂinging ourselves forth to
hopeless death any moment now.” He
was capless, and the wavy mop that
omission revealed was so red Jurtan
thought for a moment it was some ﬂu-
orescent mutation. Maybe not, but it
would still make an effective beacon in
the fog.
Eden grinned at him with an ex-
pression of genial familiarity. “This is
Lemon, otherwise known as the Craw-
ﬁsh, for reasons civilized folk can only
guess at in disgust. I understand some-
one from your bunch has been messing
around with his sister.”
“Pay no attention to Eden,” said the
Crawﬁsh, leaning on his pommel. “She
has her family’s gift for innuendo but
hasn’t had an audience to practice on
for years. Now she’ll be cutting loose
with a torrent.” He ts’ked reprovingly

and eyed her back. “The only messing
about that was discussed was on the
part of your brother, and not the one
with the pleasant disposition, either.”
“You’d think as a freelance, currently
beholden to me, you might have a little
more discretion where you sling your
insults.”
The
Crawﬁsh
looked
thoughtful.
“Could that be why I’ve never held
on to a regular job?”
“Freelance?” Tildamire said, feeling
strangely like she was back watching
the Karlinis again, only with the air
of pleasant bantering that had slipped
away from them toward the end here
restored. “Freelance what?”
“Tends to change,” said the Crawﬁsh
laconically.
“Usually without notice,
like the drift of this conversation. So
just what is the situation here?”
Shaa had been keeping a weather

eye peeled on the goings-on around
him, alert for a surreptitious effort
on the part of the Hand to preemp-
tively pounce with the aim of subduing
him, or an initiative from the Monts
designed to save him from himself, or
a sortie from his besieged associates
intended to do who knew what-all,
or indeed any inspirational creative-
ness on the part of the world at large.
The gathering convention around the
Monts had thus not escaped his notice.
Not that he could tell for certain, in
the deepening gloom of evening, ex-
actly who the newcomers were, but
he thought that suspicion and deduc-
tion, not to mention analysis of timing
and circumstance, had brought him
reliably nine-tenths of the way to cer-
titude anyway.
What would they do,
was the real question.
“So you see,”
he continued, addressing (as he had

been) the Hand’s most wavering digit,
Romm V’Nisa, “your employer is in-
deed using you as he has used all his
tools, which is to say with callousness
aforethought and meatgrinder dispen-
sibility. Contrast with that the oppor-
tunity of gaining the undying favor of
those who literally are undying, not to
mention the approbatory eye of forces
temporal including the Emperor and
the ruling hierarchy, whose posteriors
you will have de-slinged.” These were
hard-bitten campaigners, after all; it
was often necessary to employ saucy
language to establish rapport with
such fellows.
“We have a contract,” Gadol V’Nisa
reiterated stubbornly.
“We didn’t sign up to dig our own
grave,” said Romm, not for the ﬁrst
time on his part, either.
“I don’t like this,” said Chas V’Halila,

shaking his head. “I don’t like any part
of this. We’re mixed up in something
way too big for us. I say we get the hell
out quick as we can and dig in long as
it takes till this thing blows over. Max
was one thing, but now we’re talking
serious -”
“Shut up,” Romm and Gadol told
him simultaneously. Then they paused
to glare at each other, a standoff Gadol
broke ﬁrst.
“I won’t say there isn’t
something in what you say,” he ac-
knowledged.
“I am no seeker for im-
molation. But neither do I wish to be
on the losing side. If your brother has
already achieved such a record of suc-
cess, what better chance do we have
through betting against him?”
“Now we’re talking tactics,” Romm
said with satisfaction.
“No, we’re not,” snapped Gadol.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said Shaa,

in his most placating tone of voice. “My
brother thrives on sowing dissension,
and indecision too, for that matter. For
years I refrained from seeking his de-
struction even though I had far better
justiﬁcation even before this than you
will hopefully ever have if you work
for him for a decade.
It is now clear
my reluctance has engendered dire
consequences, beyond even those you
already know - as if those were not
themselves more than enough. I fear
he intends to release a magic-bearing
plague of such malign import as to in-
sure that the world would never again
be as we know it. Sir Chas, here, real-
izes this is possible.”
Chas had gone white. “Zinarctica?”
“Perhaps merely a warm-up,” Shaa
intoned gravely.
Of course that last
was not, strictly speaking, true.
As
far as Shaa knew, his brother was not

about to expunge civilization;
there
would be no one left for him to rule, so
what fun would that be? If anyone was
capable of deliberately releasing such
a scourge, however, Arznaak was the
man.
But that was not the reason for air-
ing the possibility of such a pestilence.
There was still the Karlini lab. If some-
thing had survived destruction and
his most recent attempt at detection,
the hazard might very well ﬁrst reveal
itself through being quite extreme;
through being, indeed, beyond their
own abilities to contain it. Accordingly,
it seemed only prudent to begin lining
up potential allies.
“We don’t break
contracts,” Romm was saying to Gadol,
“but we don’t work for psychotics ei-
ther. We seem to have blundered into
a serious situation here.”
“This could all be a story he’s making

up,” protested Gadol, although some-
what weakly, to Shaa’s ears. “It could
be a diversion to rescue his friends.”
Romm shrugged. “If it is, so what?
How important are these people any-
way? Max is the powerhouse, you know
that.
Now that he’s out of the story
what do we lose? Prudence would dic-
tate we provide ourselves with insur-
ance.”
“This could be a subtle plan for re-
venge,” Gadol ventured.
“Max is not dead,” said Shaa, “merely
sequestered. No torture is involved, I
trust? Then where is the incitement to
revenge?”
“Enough talk,” Romm proclaimed.
“Do we need a vote, or can we deﬁne
what we intend to do for each other?”
“All right,” said Gadol, “all right.
But I warn you, there better not be any
tricks. The ﬁrst sign of anything funny

and your throat is the one running
red.”
“That only seems fair,” murmured
Shaa. “I had best inform my colleagues
of our arrangement. There is an addi-
tional matter to discuss ﬁrst, though;
that of informers.”
Gadol drew back. “Informers?”
“You know my brother.
Don’t you
think he’s planted someone on you
or suborned someone already in your
Hand to report back to him on your
activities?”
“What are they talking about all this
time?” Jurtan Mont asked. “Don’t you
think we’d better rescue him?”
“No,” said Eden Shaa sternly, “that is
exactly what we shouldn’t do. Weren’t
you the one talking about Zolly and his
mouth? As long as they’re still talking
he’s got them under control.”
To be sure, Jurtan’s music sense

wasn’t giving any particular forebod-
ing of alarm, either, and he did feel
like he was learning signiﬁcantly more
about what had been going on.
But
why did they need to just keep stand-
ing here? “Don’t you have forces you
could call in?” he said to the Crawﬁsh.
“Give them standoff for standoff?”
The Crawﬁsh studied a nail.
“I’ve
never much liked ﬂeet actions,” he re-
marked.
“Then what good are you? What do
you do, just hang around?”
The Crawﬁsh glanced at Eden. “You
mean I’m not supposed to just hang
around?”
“Sounds like a ﬁne job description to
me,” said Eden.
Tildamire knew her brother well
enough to realize his next utterance
was likely to be some sort of outburst,
accompanied by a petulant accusation

of being toyed with or taken for a nin-
compoop; of course his tirade would
only underline how appropriate the ac-
cusation was. The way he’d been acting
lately she had half a mind to let him
make a fool of himself again, but there
was still the chance they had some
family honor left to uphold. “It sounds
like you’ve done your share of travel-
ing, Mr. Crawﬁsh,” she inserted, while
Jurtan was still opening his mouth and
drawing air for his eruption. “Did you
ever meet our father? The former Lion
of the Oolvaan Plain?”
The Crawﬁsh directed a pleasant, if
slightly goofy, smile at her. “Lemon’s
actually my name;
you don’t have
to bother with this crustacean non-
sense. Your father’s the one in Roosing
Oolvaya, isn’t that it? It’s possible we
might have crossed paths back in -”
“Something’s
happening,”
Jurtan

said suddenly.
Wroclaw, inspecting the apartment
yet again, concluded that all was in
readiness. They were as prepared as
they could be. The snares, the deadfall
on the stairs, the acids in the cupola,
the pails of bubbling oil kept at a boil
each on its own hotplate or burner, the
mannequins dressed in Shaa’s spare
clothing positioned to draw the ﬁrst
round of ﬁre or the ﬁrst slashing attack
of anyone who achieved the unlikely re-
sult of actually making it into the ﬂat,
Haddo
and
Karlini’s
polychromatic
spell-tangles hovering close to hand,
their trigger-releases at the ready, and
so forth and so on.
Wroclaw had un-
covered a cache of martial materiel
crammed precariously in a rear closet
and had handed around the spoils;
even Haddo had made a war helmet

disappear somehow into the darkness
of his hood. Wroclaw had a mace dan-
gling by its thong from his belt.
He
didn’t expect to use the thing, but why
not? If nothing else it was picturesque.
And Dortonn?
Well, Dortonn was
still surprisingly active for someone
who looked the way he did. Even his
pronouncements on the imminence of
his demise and the extremity of his suf-
fering had begun to seem rather beside
the point; window dressing, so to speak,
while the business of the store within
continued to roll along with scarcely
a waver.
For all his incantation and
contortions and glaring out into space,
though, he had thus far shown no evi-
dence of success in whatever-it-was he
was hoping to accomplish.
Haddo scuttled past again, mutter-
ing as usual under his breath.
“My
friend,” said Wroclaw, “you seem un-

usually preoccupied with birds this
evening. Would you like me to prepare
for you a snack? Dr. Shaa’s larder is
well -”
Haddo broke off and craned his red
eyespots upward.
“Help of lots you
are,” he spat sarcastically. “Forget you
wings of chickens yours, even fried.
Your seagulls, bah! Of use nothing for
seagulls are.”
Wroclaw shrugged. “Who among us
can choose our legacy?” As was the case
for so many of the not-quite-humans,
Wroclaw’s gene pool was quite small,
and inbreeding had not particularly
helped things. He had always consid-
ered his family’s rapport with seagulls
and other waterfowl to be evidence
that the laws of natural selection had
a sense of humor. “They don’t like to
go out past sundown,” Wroclaw added,
“or I would have asked them to come

over here anyway. There are bound to
be good pickings on hand before long.”
“Pickings of carrion will be,” grum-
bled Haddo. “Carrion have your friends
not the taste. Smarter than that are
they.
Even gull of Karlini coop has
ﬂown.”
It was true.
The seagull that had
been trailing Karlini for reasons which
remained its own had refused to en-
ter Shaa’s building with the rest of
them. Wroclaw could still feel it lurk-
ing around, but damned if he could
tell what it was up to. The bird was
having its fun, that much was clear,
swooping silently out of the trees to
make the occasional dive on some un-
suspecting Hand and letting loose at
the last second with one of its special
raise-the-dead screeches, leaving the
fellow making futile hacks at the air,
cursing violently against the appari-

tion from hell and trying to decide if
he was really having a heart attack or
not. Then the gull would mount back
into the sky and loiter about, giving
every impression of waiting for some-
one or something. Come to think of it,
was Haddo protesting a bit too much?
“Haddo,” said Wroclaw, “are you up to
something?”
“Fah,” said Haddo,
with another
furtive upward glance.
“Small birds,
tiny birds, fah! Of use only big birds
are. Trapped are we. Only help now
can I - up with Karlini now is what?”
Karlini had crept back from the win-
dow and was beckoning them closer.
“We have a new plan,” he hissed.
“No tricks,” they had demanded;
indeed, what an interesting, if implau-
sible, world that would be.
No, this
would be tricky enough even with-
out gratuitous shenanigans.
Keep it

simple and hope for the luxury of no
unintended surprises;
that was the
plan.
One option had been to stage a mock
ﬁreﬁght for any observing spies.
It
would have been too difﬁcult to coor-
dinate convincingly, though, especially
considering that causing actual casual-
ties to either side would have scotched
their shaky deal immediately. Another
option would have had the Hand ﬁght-
ing illusions, only to discover after
the fact that their quarry had slipped
away.
Alternatively, Chas V’Halila
could have proclaimed his success in
offensive thaumaturgy,
Karlini and
the others could have feigned paraly-
sis, and the Hand could have mopped
them up and carted them away only
to have them spring to life unexpect-
edly and give their “captors” the slip.
There were the options of surrender

against overwhelming odds, of an an-
nouncement to the troops by Gadol
that they had read the address wrong
and had just discovered themselves to
be besieging the wrong location, and
of a feigned message of recall arriving
unexpectedly from their employer; and
the much ﬂashier one of the staged
demolition of Shaa’s building, with his
associates hiding in the basement.
These options all had drawbacks,
though, either of logistics or plausibil-
ity or excess hazard. They could come
at the problem from the other side and
forge ahead under the Scapula’s own
rules, dashing the consequences of dis-
covered treachery and relying on mo-
mentum to carry them past any coun-
terstrokes. Shaa had also ﬂoated the
possibility of smoking out his brother’s
hypothesized spies through an appro-
priate subterfuge. The leaders of the

Hand, though, displaying their prefer-
ence for the blow direct, had refused
Shaa’s offer to supply them with a
stratagem suitable for the occasion.
With the prospect of their collabora-
tion crashing imminently on the rocks,
then, for lack of a mutually agreeable
ﬁrst step, the unexpected had inserted
itself, as the unexpected in so timely a
manner often did.
The
unexpected
announced
itself
with a sudden disruption in the trees
just in front of Shaa’s address: a crack-
ing of branches, a lashing of leaves,
and a rapid series of thuds and oof!s
and wails, followed by a rain of thrash-
ing men falling ﬁrst from that tree,
then the next - the men of the Hand,
waiting with grappling irons and cross-
bows at the ready for the signal to
storm the building from above. At the
same time a large gray shape passed

overhead above the trees, silently but
for a rufﬂe of air, showing the sug-
gestion of long feathers on its under-
side and wide gliding wings spanning
the street. “Gods damn you,” snarled
Gadol, “a trick!”; and with a powerful
move he drew his knife and turned
to plunge it as he had promised into
Shaa’s neck.
Shaa was scarcely waiting for him,
however. Perhaps later they could dis-
cuss the sarcastic hand of fate; perhaps
later he would discuss this particular
trick with its instigator, as well, as
soon as he discovered who that per-
son was. Not Karlini, probably, since
he had been able to get a message
through to the Great one to hold tight
while he tried to work out a deal; pos-
sibly that fellow Dortonn, who had
been acting the nihilist well enough
to show even Max a new turn or two;

but taking into account his growing
suspicion of what - or whom - was car-
rying on up there in the foliage, and
how they had arrived on site, Haddo
was clearly the leading candidate for
the appropriate recipient of wrath. A
powerful bloodcurdling battle cry that
sounded like the roar of some savage
cat of the savannas with the ululating
trumpet of an enraged elephant tacked
on at the end echoed from the trees as
Shaa, cloaked by the refraction spell
he had kept ready in case of the need
for a quick escape, bent himself double
and slid himself forcefully toward Chas
V’Halila.
Chas was taking his own step for-
ward and waving his hands in the
launching of his own spell-work; sud-
denly, though, he tripped over some-
thing unseen, felt a solid blow to his
belly that threw him energetically up

and forward, and found himself do-
ing an exuberant cartwheel head-over-
heels directly into Romm V’Nisa’s iron
chest.
Romm saw him coming and
tried to throw him past, but in the
event was reduced to futile if ﬂamboy-
ant cursing as they went down in a
heap. Down the block, the forces of the
Hand, who were if nothing else well-
trained,
decided they had received
enough of a go-ahead to begin their
assault.
Down the block and up in Shaa’s
ﬂat, the Great Karlini was staring at
Haddo with a crazed expression on his
face. “You did what?” he howled.
“Thought I help need we would,”
said Haddo, unapologetically.
“Initia-
tive took I.”
“This is it, Haddo! You’re ﬁred!”
“If I were to make a suggestion,” said
Wroclaw, “it would be ﬁght ﬁrst, ﬁre

later. They are breaking down the door
and in another few seconds will be on
the steps.”
Behind the barricade at the end of
the block, Tildamire Mont watched as
her brother Jurtan, muttering “I knew
it!” under his breath, swung himself
over the roadblock and tore down the
street in a ﬂailing run, made erratic
because he was simultaneously fum-
bling out his replacement harmonica
from his inside pocket.
She was still
listening to that savage cry that hung
in the air; listening, and thinking how
strangely familiar a sound it was. “So,
what do you think?” the Crawﬁsh was
saying behind her. “Should I rush in?”
“First thing you do is put these on,”
Eden Shaa told him.
“What’s this? Earplugs?”
“That’s right,” said Eden.
“Here,
Tildamire, these are for you.
Your

brother’s about to play, isn’t he?”
“I’m afraid so,” said Tildamire. “I -”
“Mash them up in your ﬁngers ﬁrst,”
Eden instructed, watching lights ﬂare
down the street. “I’ve got rubber trees
out on the estate - you’d be amazed at
the things you can make out of rubber.
There now mumml mumml mum-”
They were amazing, Tildamire de-
cided, as she wedged the second plug
in her other ear and noticed the level
of sound from outside drop virtually to
nothing. Now had the Hand made the
same sort of preparations?
Philosophically speaking, all battles
involve more than their share of con-
fusion. Still, Shaa had to admit that
this one was shaping up to be excep-
tional in its level of chaos and muddle
per capita.
“Call off the attack!” he
was yelling, in a convincing imitation
of Gadol V’Nora’s own ofﬁcious roar,

as he slipped across the lawn of the
building across the street from his
own, having vaulted its hedge just as
his short-term refraction ﬁeld ﬂickered
and collapsed.
“No!” roared the real Gadol, from
somewhere back in the street. “Attack!
Attack! Kill them all, the lying -”
Ah, there they were. Shaa crammed
his own earplugs into place, feeling
quite satisﬁed that he had had the fore-
sight to have Eden messenger them
over before he’d left for the Running,
settling the second one within his au-
ricle just as the bleat of a insane reed
instrument drifted to him over the
hedge.
His vision fogged and then
settled.
Using a convenient plaster
lawn ﬂamingo as a footstool, he raised
himself to eye-level over the top of
the hedge.
What he saw was Jurtan
Mont, standing in front of the building

containing his ﬂat, tootling on his har-
monicum one of his cockeyed paralytic
airs. Jurtan was weaving from side to
side to avoid being cast asunder by the
crowd of surrounding Hand-thugs who
were tottering, reeling, vomiting, and
heaving themselves at Jurtan in an at-
tempt to bring him down to the ground
with them and crush him beneath their
weight. They were having no success.
Indeed, enough of the Hand members
were already chewing the dust that
Jurtan was doing his dance half on the
ground and half on their backs.
Jurtan’s biggest hazard at the mo-
ment was evading the rain of troopers
who were dropping from the trees and
falling backward from their storming-
ladders.
Even the howling berserker
who had started this mess by anoint-
ing himself a tree-dervish had fallen
silent, and the foliage was no longer

being wracked by the whirling scythe
of his sword - no, wait, there was that
bellow again after all, although quav-
ery this time and without power, more
of a collapsing screech really, and then
the screecher himself made his appear-
ance, launching himself with a mighty-
thewed leap from his tree-perch toward
the upper-ﬂoor front window of Shaa’s
ﬂat. It was amazing he was still even
conscious under the force of Jurtan’s
onslaught - but even though nominally
awake, he was clearly not unaffected,
judging by the weaving stance he took
on the branch prior to leaping out, and
the way he seemed to lose track of
what he was doing halfway through
his trajectory in the air.
Instead of
reaching for the window frame and
using the ﬁnger-hold to ﬂip himself
through the glass into the living room,
he hit the wall below the window head-

ﬁrst and slid down the facade through
the awning above the front door and
thence onto the stoop.
The man was not alone there. Just
before his arrival, a knot of Hand-
folks had come rolling down the inte-
rior stairway and back out onto the
porch themselves, followed closely and
doubtless propelled by Shaa’s long four-
person sofa. Accordingly, the screech-
ing man was fortuitously spared from
splitting his head open against the
slate paving by the cushions of this
same sofa; Shaa could hear the sproing
of its tortured springs across the street
and through his earplugs.
That much was probably empathy,
though. There would need to be plenty
of empathy to go around.
Shaa was
willing to spare an additional helping
for Jurtan Mont, who had followed the
appearance, ﬂight, and downfall of the

maniacal berserker with a gaze of as
much open-mouthed astonishment as
he could muster given that he was still
persistently piping on his instrument.
Jurtan’s expression was not merely one
of surprise, it was one of confounded
recognition, for the psychotic brawler
was clearly, if without obvious explana-
tion for his presence, Jurtan’s father,
the former Lion of the Oolvaan Plain.
Down the block, coming carefully
toward the carnage from the direction
of the barricade, were the fallen Lion’s
other offspring Tildamire, Shaa’s own
sister Eden, and, making a show of es-
corting while leading his horse, Lemon,
the Crawﬁsh. Shaa let himself out of
the garden through the front gate and
approached them. “What do you want
to do now?” the Crawﬁsh lip-spoke at
him.
Shaa shrugged.
“Round them up,

I suppose,” he mouthed back. Jurtan
had now turned around and spotted
them.
Jurtan’s predominant expres-
sion at the moment was one of con-
fusion ﬂoating perhaps atop a sea of
horriﬁed dread. His confusion seemed
to deepen when he saw them all ambu-
latory and apparently none the worse
for wear; no one had informed him
of their experiments with earplugs.
Shaa caught his attention,
pointed
at his own ear and made screwing-in
motions; then, observing Jurtan’s be-
wilderment growing rather than being
relieved, made a wiping-away forget-
it gesture followed by patting the air
downward in an attempt to get him to
reduce the fervor of his playing. Wait a
minute - Jurtan didn’t have earplugs,
he could hear. “Turn it down a little,”
Shaa yelled at him.
Eden had produced a coil of rope;

Eden never went anywhere without
rope.
She and Tildamire had begun
to busy themselves with binding the
moaning, barely sensible Hands.
As
Shaa moved aside to let them work, he
noticed that the Crawﬁsh’s horse, and
Eden’s next to it too for that matter,
were not unoccupied.
The Crawﬁsh’s
steed had two bodies slung across its
back, with a third slumped over Eden’s.
The three leaders of the Hand had al-
ready been wound securely with cable
and apparently bonked over the head
for good measure.
Shaa sidled closer
and ﬁxed the lolling, upside-down eye
of Gadol V’Nora with an affable expres-
sion. “Now,” he said to Gadol, “about
that alliance.”
“Are you really sure you want to do
this?” said Tarfon. “I mean, you said
that Shaa explicitly told you not to
make a move until you’d had a chance

to discuss it with him.”
“He never could have thought I’d
have this chance,” Leen told her, “and
anyway, he’s not my boss, I’m not his
slave.
We were just thrown together,
that’s all, and -”
“But I thought he knew a lot more
about these things than you do, and a
lot more about Max in particular, and
that’s why -”
“I think I see light up ahead,” an-
nounced Leen, in a tone of voice in-
tended to declare deﬁnitively that this
discussion was over and the subject
closed.
She did not want to be re-
minded again that Tarfon was most
probably right, and that she herself
was substantially out of her league and
in the process of doing something quite
unwise. In contrast to the usual state
of the affairs for this sort of thing, her
course of action’s misguided nature

had nothing to do with the outcome.
Well... to be fair, that wasn’t entirely
true. The sheer scope of her folly might
not be known unless she happened to
succeed.
But Max wasn’t a greater hazard to
the general welfare than the Scapula...
was he? Certainly not. Only his good
friends and closest associates, who had
known him for who knew how many
years through situations she didn’t
even want to guess at, thought so. And
she, herself? Clearly what she was do-
ing was absurd, even granted that she
had these unfamiliar... feelings toward
him. Absurd? No, that was really most
unlikely. Leen knew she was the most
rational of persons. Everyone had al-
ways told her so, and they couldn’t all
be wrong, could they? Especially since
she had usually heard the assessment
delivered in despair, just after an ar-

gument where she had been urged to
be more human and less a creature of
cold intellect, and just before the ar-
guee (often a close relative) threw up
their hands and stalked off in disgust
muttering under their breath. It was
not as though her friends and relations
had been appraising her thus in order
to ﬂatter her. If this was as she had
always been, then, surely a few... feel-
ings wouldn’t completely remake her,
couldn’t rob of her capacity for analysis
and her common sense.
No, of course not. So it must be only
a delusion that that was the way she
felt.
In Leen’s favor on the scale of ra-
tionality versus dementia,
she had
given Tarfon the option of excusing
herself from the enterprise. Leen had
to acknowledge that Tarfon had been
quite right to call her on that, though.

“What,” Tarfon had said with resigna-
tion, “wait here in your Archives when
you don’t come back, and starve to
death? At least if I go with you there’s
a chance I’ll end up in a cell some-
where with food, instead of dead out of
hand to serve kids as a nasty bedtime
cautionary tale.”
So here they were instead, far along
the hidden passage the computer had
revealed to them linking the Archives
with the nearby dungeon; a quixotic
librarian and a dragooned innocent.
Squinting ahead past her lantern at
the pale smear of light against the
tunnel wall, Leen stepped carefully
through
another
pair
of
side-path
turnoffs and edged sideways into the
narrow passage, straight into another
tunnel-spanning ﬂoor-to-ceiling tangle
of dusty cobwebs. She swept the stuff
out of her eyes and cleared her nose

and mouth enough to breathe but re-
frained from cursing; it was best to
retain a stoical attitude as an example
to her reluctant accomplice. “We seem
to be on the right path, at least,” Tarfon
muttered, examining the sketch-map
they had drawn from the image of the
computer’s display. “What luck.”
“You were the one who was appalled
that Max was locked up,” Leen hissed
at her.
“That was abstract.”
“Shh!” Stoical;
remember,
stoical.
She could see the source of the light,
now - a sliver at head-height where the
cover had been incompletely replaced
in front of a spy-hole on the blank end
wall. At least the walls expanded out
enough here to let her inhale without
making her back and breasts scrape
against the rock; the space was even
generous enough to turn around or

take a step to the side. Leen hooded
her lantern, slid the cover fully aside
with a low nerve-wracking creak, and
applied her eye to the crevice.
The ﬂickering light was cast by a
torch in a sconce on the wall opposite
the peephole.
Next to the torch was
the sort of thick wooden door stud-
ded with bars and nails and hasps
one expected from a serious dungeon.
Bulking humped and angular in front
of the door was what appeared in the
uncertain light to be some sort of tor-
ture rack, with the shape of a pros-
trate body reclining in limp disarray
along its inclined surface. “Max?” Leen
hissed through the spy-hole.
The body failed to stir. Had the per-
son been ﬂailed?
Knocked insensible
through blows to the head? Passed out
through loss of blood or merely gener-
alized agony? The current government

administration - of which Leen was, to
be frank, a part - held an enlightened
attitude toward the treatment of those
who found themselves within its grasp.
Accordingly, torture was supposed to
be entirely proscribed, but on the other
hand where there were dungeons, and
cells never accountable to the rule of
light, it stood to reason that anything
could happen. “Is there a door here?”
Leen muttered, feeling about the wall.
“Try your other hand,” suggested
Tarfon in a low whisper.
Her other hand? - oh, an interesting
idea.
She was still wearing on that
hand her signet of ofﬁce. As she trans-
ferred the lantern from her ring hand
to the other, one of her ﬁngers brushed
the top of the signet, and she noted
that the ring felt damp; actually more
slimy, really.
When she brought up
the ring, furthermore, she noted in the

thin beam that escaped the lantern’s
hood a thin ﬁlm of some sort of gray
goo covering its surface.
Sorcery she
was used to; goo, on the contrary, was
something to be scrubbed clean, but on
the off chance that the substance had
seeped through some cunning vent
from the ring’s interior, rather than be-
ing something noxious she had scraped
against on the way through the tunnel,
she touched it to the rock wall anyway,
then moved it about on the surface.
She was rewarded by ... nothing. No
rumble of hidden machinery, no spin-
ning of cunning doors, no illuminatory
ﬂash revealing the path to a new exit.
Nothing.
Except...
why did a line
snaking down the wall appear to be
bubbling?
Beneath the foaming trace, a deeper
crevice was now coming into sight, a
crevice outlining what could only be

the shape of a door. Was it too absurd
to hypothesize that the oracle back in
the Archives had relayed a message
to her ring, which was now passing it
in some organic, half-alive fashion to
the rock itself, which was now respond-
ing by recreating for her an ancient
passageway? Surely this was not the
sort of hypothesis in which one would
trafﬁc on a daily basis, but still it did
seem to ﬁt the facts.
Examining the
face of the rock a bit more closely, Leen
now noted how certain patches of moss
or lichen so drab as to have otherwise
escaped the attention of anyone but a
fanatically dedicated naturalist were
squirming in a veritable frenzy them-
selves, exuding from their extended
runners a dull ooze that appeared to
be the source of the ﬁzzling active prin-
ciple.
It did seem like a lot of trouble to

go to, though.
Why not just provide
a standard sort of secret door?
True,
masking the door by making it literally
part of continuous rock was certainly
a permanent way of keeping security
intact and making sure that only some-
one who knew the trick could sneak
through, but - really. Unless -
Who had built these secret passages?
And using what means of construction?
The network of creep-spaces indicated
by the oracular computer was amaz-
ingly extensive, revealing the palace
complex to be a virtual honeycomb of
hidden byways.
How had the oracle
become so knowledgeable about the
tunnel system’s ins and outs?
Leen
had a sudden, mind-boggling vision
of hidden rivers of gray sludge chew-
ing their mysterious way through the
foundations of the city, under the com-
mand and guidance of the enigmatic

machine she had uncovered in her own
lair.
If her vision was authentic, the
potentialities were extensive... and the
power implicitly wielded by the oracle
distressing vast. More, in the ancient
legends of the thinking machines, they
were always represented as the bound
slaves of their greater masters, with no
initiative or capability for independent
volition. If the lore also ran true, then,
to whom did this computer report?
Could anyone with her ring and the
right answers to its questions become
its commander?
It had recognized her as the Archivist
by the ring, Leen recalled.
That im-
plied that the presentation of different
sigils could also result in recognition.
If -
“I think it’s ﬁnished,” Tarfon prod-
ded her.
So it appeared.
Leen pressed ten-

tatively at the newly revealed door.
It slid smoothly away from her on a
concealed pivot. She hesitated, gazing
through the gap into the poorly lit cell,
then straightened her shoulders. What
was she here for, if not to proceed? She
edged through the opening and took
a step beyond, approaching the ﬁgure
bound to the rack of conﬁnement. Be-
hind her, there was a fresh rush of
air, a mufﬂed cry of “Wait!
I can’t -”
that was abruptly shut off with a small
thump, and as Leen turned again she
was already realizing what sight she
was about to see.
A hewn rock wall,
unbroken by the doorway she had just
passed through.
Leen scrutinized the surface.
The
action of the mysterious goo had taken
several minutes, so it seemed unlikely
for the rock to have knit itself again
spontaneously... no, there was the out-

line of the door. Perhaps touching the
correct spot with the ring would allow
her to pass through again... although
it did seem rather odd for the door to
have taken the decision unilaterally
upon itself to close behind her, instead
of waiting for her to retreat through
it again. Perhaps there was some ad-
ditional command she should have
given it to compel it to remain open.
Or could it perhaps have sensed some
untoward situation in the making, and
followed the dictate of preserving any
knowledge of its mere existence from -
The real door to the cell clanked and
then began to slide open with a low
creak.
There was nowhere to hide, nowhere
to retreat, no time even to release Max
and unleash his ﬁghting skills - for the
ﬁrst time Leen took a good look at the
ﬁgure on the rack.

It was not Max.
It was not even
a person.
It was several pillows and
gunny sacks wrapped in a cloak and
trousers and secured to the bed with
the straps and cables provided. A mask
of restraint in the correct location ob-
scured the absence of a face and head
from anyone peeping through the ob-
servation hole in the door.
In either
door.
Leen was joined in her contempla-
tion of this state of affairs by the man
who had just entered the cell. Beneath
a rich cloak of dark velvet could be
glimpsed his robes of state, their hems
of ermine and ﬁligree of gold braid.
“Well,” said the man. “Someone shall
hear of this.”
Except calling him a “man”, though
approximately true, was not strictly
speaking accurate, for was the per-
sonage not in fact his Highness, the

Emperor-designate himself?
It was just as well, Leen reﬂected,
that she had never been one to swoon.
She tried to steady her breathing, and
watched
as
the
Emperor-designate
appeared to consider the question of
whether to strike out in frustration at
the efﬁgy, or merely turn on his heel
and stalk out, calling for the inevitable
guards. It would have been the most
boring alternative for fate and the
most outrageous one for probability,
and was not, in any case, in the cards,
for of course the Emperor turned and
saw her instead.
The Emperor-designate ran a du-
bious eye up and down her form.
Smeared with dust and scraped by
rocks, draped from head to waist with
the remnants of ancient spiderwebs,
holding a hooded lantern, Leen real-
ized she struck a striking image out of

classical mythology. “I know you,” the
Emperor-designate said, “don’t I?”
“All know you, sire,” she told him.
She hadn’t tried to make her voice par-
ticularly sepulchral, it was the dust
and the coughing and the associated
secretions that combined to produce
the effect. For good or ill, it certainly
didn’t sound like her.
The
Emperor-designate
frowned.
“The prisoner Maximillian is no longer
in his cell, yet here you are in his place
instead. What do you have to say about
this?”
She ﬁxed him with a gaze she sin-
cerely hoped was fraught with mytho-
logical import.
“Maximillian has a
larger fate than this.”
“His fate is subject to my will.”
“And is not your will subject to the
will of others?”
“No,” he said impatiently, “of course

not, that’s the whole point of the com-
pact. The Emperor is granted freedom
of action on a level with the gods.”
“Tell that to the Scapula,” Leen in-
toned.
He peered more closely at her. “You’re
the Archivist, aren’t you?
Of course
you are. What is the meaning of this
charade, and what are you doing in
this cell?”
“Whiling away some time before the
Knitting?”
“That,” said the Emperor-designate
imperiously, with the barest hint of a
sniff, “is scarcely appropriate wear for
the Knitting. You should have already
changed.
Perhaps you will allow my
guards to assure it? You will join me
in the box of state, and as time permits
we shall discuss this matter further.”
“Is he dead?” said Jill-tang.
“If he
isn’t dead why isn’t he waking up?”

“He’s not dead, but he’s being quite
persistent about choosing to be uncon-
scious,” Gashanatantra told her. They
had arrayed Jardin on a slab in Jill’s
workroom,
located
conveniently
be-
hind the reception area that had been
the venue for their earlier sparring
bout.
“You wouldn’t have anything
so crude lying about as an injectable
amphetamine, would you?”
“You’ve already seen what’s in the
medical cabinet.”
“Hm, yes.
Do you recall a particu-
lar item of furniture, a decorative mar-
ble pedestal that we kept that globular
light sculpture on? Is that piece still
around?”
“It’s in my dressing room; this way.
Why? Is there something hidden in it?”
“As a matter of fact, yes, there is.”
Gashanatantra followed her down a
hall with a polished parquet ﬂoor, mod-

est gilt and crystal chandeliers, and
matching mirrors atop provincial end-
tables with ﬂuted legs and claw-and-
ball feet. The hall was long enough to
bring a pony to a good canter and back
to a stop without having to navigate a
bend. “You’ve redecorated, I see. Your
count of worshipers is up?”
“I suppose I can’t complain. About
that, at any rate. In here.” The pedestal
in question held a dramatic position in
the middle of a circular settee sur-
rounded by dressing tables and the
doors to tall closets.
A cunning sky-
light directed a wash of soft yellow over
the base and its artwork; considering
the depth of this apartment within the
temple, the simple skylight must have
required a signiﬁcant supporting in-
frastructure of prisms and light guides
and tracking mirrors linking it with
the roof. And an artiﬁcial light source

somewhere along the way, too, since
it was by now unquestionably night.
“Don’t break the sculpture, all right?”
“Why should I break it?” said Gashana
“I was always fond of the thing. I com-
missioned it, if you don’t remember.”
He carefully placed his palms ﬂat
on the curved sides of the pedestal,
pressed, then moved his hands and
caressed again.
As he released his
grip, the cylinder began to rotate with
a soft whirr; rotate, and wind itself
upward. The marble was revealed as
a mere shell atop an interior mech-
anism ﬁtted with a hefty spiraling
screw thread.
After a moment, the
ascending tube slid to a smooth stop
without giving the sculpture the mer-
est jangle. Gashanatantra performed
another cryptic manipulation and an
interior cavity appeared.
Withdraw-
ing a latched box from the recess by

its handle, he remarked, “You see? I
am backing with actions my statement
about the need for mutual collabora-
tion and some modicum of trust. Now
you will undertake a search of the
premises for anything else I might
have left sitting around, yes? Yet if it
were not for me you would be none the
wiser.”
“Just get on with it and wake up
Jardin,” said Jill.
“The longer we go
without hearing from the Scapula the
more nervous I get. We haven’t gotten
anything back from the brother, either,
and it must be almost an hour since I
sent off the messenger.”
This time Gashanatantra led the
way out into the hall,
letting the
pedestal reassemble itself behind him.
“The Scapula is probably preparing
himself for the Knitting.
It is con-
ceivable his preparations include the

recapture or more lasting extermina-
tion of his brother. The Knitting is the
central concern.”
“That’s exactly what’s been on my
mind.
I’ve been thinking about your
friend Iskendarian too. Don’t you think
you should go bring him in before the
Scapula gets hold of him?”
“The Scapula already has hold of
him,” Gashanatantra stated.
“From
what Monoch tells me he is frozen in
a chair no differently from any of the
others we have already heard about.
As far as that goes, he’s likely to be
less of a danger in that condition than
anywhere else.
Even if he somehow
manages to escape there is still no
need to worry. He may know Monoch is
a soul-drinker, but I don’t believe he’s
realized all the implications: Monoch
is keyed to him, and Monoch has his
orders. On the other side, I suspect the

Scapula will wait until he has some
leisure time to review his catches one
by one, and I doubt he’ll discover what
he has until then. Even when and if
that happens, he may ﬁnd himself in a
situation... not to his liking.”
“Tell me about it,” Jill growled. “Isk-
endarian or whoever he is is a walk-
ing disaster. You’re looking for booby-
traps? - he’s the -”
“Now, now, dear, don’t foam at the
mouth.” He could feel Jill glaring at
him behind his back, then thought he
knew when the grudging hint of a grin
ﬂickered through the murderous in-
tent. Just the memory of old times, or
perhaps the glint of something fresh
and closer to hand?
Back in the workroom, Gashanatantr
eyed Jardin carefully, alert to the pos-
sibility he had risen from his coma to
prowl around the place in their absence

with malign intent. No evidence of this
presented itself. The restorative drips
were proceeding, the shock radiator re-
mained where he had left it, the chain
restraints he had insisted on apply-
ing were undisturbed. Gashanatantra
clicked open his box and began sorting
through its contents.
“Where do you think the Scapula is,
physically?” asked Jill.
“In Jardin’s
sanctum?”
“Possibly,” Gashanatantra said. “He
may be on the way to the Knitting, or
he may be planning to execute what-
ever his plan is by remote action. Or
he may be using Protector of Nature’s
lair as a base, or Vladimir’s, or his own
original Scapular facilities.”
“I - that’s not a thumbscrew, is it?”
“Only incidentally. But I prefer to try
this ﬁrst.” He held a vial up to the light
and tapped it to clear air bubbles.

“Is that your amphetamine?”
“No,” said Gashanatantra. “This is
much more powerful, but you would
have been unlikely to have any your-
self; that’s why I asked for the other
instead. This is old, very old. I doubt
anyone is still making it. Now.”
“You’re injecting it into his chest?”
It was a long needle. “Directly into
the heart. The action is not only phar-
maceutical, the formulation contains a
cross-linked spell-skein as well. If he -
ah.”
Jardin’s chest had twitched.
A
low creaking rattle came from some-
where deep within it.
His right arm
jerked; then, his eyes ﬂew open and
his lips drew back and his teeth rat-
tled, his back arched up from the table,
a whiplash wave ran down his body
to his feet, which drummed a brief
rat-a-tat, he gave voice to a guttural

wail that brought with it a thin spray
of greenish bile, he began to draw in
paroxysmal rasping breaths.
“Jardin!” called Jill. “It’s me! Can
you hear me?”
Jardin’s staring eyes were rolling
and red. “That scum bastard,” he was
whispering between wheezes.
“Which one?” Gash murmured ur-
banely. “Now listen closely. It is impor-
tant that we talk.”

Chapter16
ZALZYN SHAA HAD NEVER BEEN
FOND of conventions. Even a family
reunion was edging over the line, but
then with his family any rational ob-
server would feel that that part of his
attitude, at least, was perfectly under-
standable. So when he considered the
fact that he was at least partially re-
sponsible for the present congregation
of disreputable characters spread out
along the street - could even be deﬁned,

in fact, as co-host - it was enough to
make a new identity and a turn to the
open road seem of more than merely
passing appeal. But lurking around on
the other hand was the matter of re-
sponsibility. Who knew what this gag-
gle of loons would do left to their own
devices if he headed off into the sunset?
Still,
matters had clearly passed
smoothly through the absurd and were
charging unwaveringly into the prepos-
terous. Where would it all end? An old
phrase Max had picked up from one of
his researches came to mind, “the heat-
death of the universe.” Max had spent
a few years tossing out this remark
as his contribution whenever a situa-
tion became completely unintelligible,
as an illustration of incomprehensi-
bility that might only be resolved by
one with unknowable knowledge or
an unachievable vantage-station from

which to exercise their point of view.
It was clear the ancients had meant
something by this mysterious “heat-
death”, but for all Max’s exertions it
had remained only a string of cryptic
words.
So as Shaa stood there, surveying
his rabble of compatriots and wonder-
ing where and whether all this would
end, reﬂecting that by now it might
take an apocalypse of legendary pro-
portions to achieve resolution by the
sheer expedient of sweeping all of them
and perhaps even the rest of Peridol
with them into the sea, he felt his
thoughts turning philosophically to -
Someone gave him a hard slap on the
back. Someone? No, that was a smack
he recognized. “I am also pleased to see
you, my sister,” Shaa said, raising an
eyebrow.
“Not a very good time to sink into

reverie, wouldn’t you say?” said Eden
pointedly.
“Yes, I suppose you’re right.” Shaa
considered the problem. “It would be
better to ﬁnd a small coffee shop and
sit on its veranda swapping reminis-
cences and recapitulating hardy mo-
ments from the recent pitched battle.
Or, considering how many invitations
would need to go out to ensure the
attendance of everyone appropriate,
perhaps a ballroom would be better
instead, even if a tea-lounge would
be more atmospheric. Shall I call the
caterer?”
“You’ve been on the road too long,”
Eden told him. “You’ve ﬁnally up and
lost your mind.”
“Certainly I’ve been doing something
too long,” agreed Shaa, putting his
hands in his pockets. “Probably slith-
ering in and out of plots. But I suppose

that’s still the leading matter on the
table now, to sit down and brew up our
next wily scheme, leaving the rest cure
in the country for a later date.”
“I’ve been on a rest cure in the coun-
try for the last - well, you know how
long - and trust me, it doesn’t solve a
thing.”
“That is not,” Shaa said reﬂectively,
“the sort of thing I would choose to take
on trust; one must experience it for one-
self. Although I will accept that it can
probably wait until morning.”
Eden had drawn back to scrutinize
him. “Okay,” she said, “I’ll bite. Why
are you just hanging around and wast-
ing time like this? Are you waiting for
something?”
“Zalzyn Shaa!”
It was a new man on horseback,
wearing livery Shaa had last seen only
a few hours before, in the temple of

Jill-tang.
“Over here!” Shaa called
out, waving his hand above his head.
“You should be more careful when mak-
ing remarks like that,” he added in
an aside to his sister. “You know the
universe’s habit of listening in.”
The rider reigned up, stepping his
horse carefully and glancing curiously
around him at the tidy aftermath of
carnage. He handed an envelope down
and Shaa promptly tore it open.
“What is it now?” Eden demanded.
“More news of our brother,” said
Shaa, still scanning the letter. “- And
Jardin’s been located, rather the worse
for wear.
Are you waiting for a re-
sponse?” he asked the messenger.
“I expect so. Will there be one?”
“A moment for assessment, please.”
Shaa took breath in a last moment
of contemplation, hearing as he did a
snatch of conversation drifting across

the tortured remains of the front-lawn
ﬂowerbeds. It sounded like Tildamire
Mont, in a particularly biting tone of
voice: “So does this resolve everything?
Was that the grand ﬁnale?”
“I wish,” said Jurtan Mont, casting
a glance back over his shoulder at the
Shaas where they stood out in the
street with their new mysterious rider.
This was the ﬁrst time he had actually
seen the two of them together - likely
the ﬁrst time they’d been together in
years and years, from his understand-
ing of the terms of their just-lifted fam-
ily curse. Jurtan’s earlier impression
on meeting Eden seemed even more
true now that he could view them side
to side; they were like one person seen
in a mirror with at most a modest rip-
ple. It was not at all what Jurtan saw
when he looked at his own sister, or

even worse, at the father lying still in
a stupor at their feet.
He hoped the Shaas were at least
having a deep and meaningful con-
versation of reunion. As soon as Dad
regained his senses such an episode
of family bonding would obviously be
the last thing on his family’s mind.
“You think maybe I should just slide off
and get out of town?” Jurtan asked his
sister.
“Might as well hear what he’s doing
here ﬁrst,” Tildamire suggested.
“It
may not be a total loss for you even
after he ﬁnds out what happened.
I
mean, you single-handedly subdued a
major mercenary troop; that should
be good for something with Dad. And
you were already pretty cut up from
this afternoon - I don’t know how you
could even hold that instrument on
your lips.”

“Yeah, but wiping out the mercenar-
ies looks like what he was here for. You
know how he feels about somebody
stealing his fun.”
“You are his son; with you it might
just make him proud.”
Jurtan snorted. “Maybe if I hadn’t
done it by making him ﬂy into a wall.”
“Uhhh!” said the former Lion of the
Oolvaan Plain.
The heads of his off-
spring swiveled down in unison. The
Lion was still reclining on Shaa’s couch,
which had been dragged off the front
stoop to let people get through the door
without stepping on his chest. An ice-
bag slumped comfortingly on his fore-
head, Wroclaw having produced it in
passing with his own inimitable style.
“I think he’s waking up,” said Tildami
“You think I should deck him out
again?” suggested Jurtan.
“Why not give him the beneﬁt of the

doubt? Maybe he’ll surprise you.”
“Thanks
a
lot,”
Jurtan
moaned.
“That’s all I need, more surprises.”
Off across the lawn, next to the
largely demolished hedge separating
the property of Shaa’s residence from
the street, another small group was
deciding whether to continue with ra-
tional conversation, or to have things
out in some form of free-for-all. “With
ancestral breeding grounds ﬁnished
was bird,” Haddo was explaining again.
“To work return thought was bird the
time, so contact did it I. Suggested I
on the way to up reinforcements pick.
Relayed did message seagull.”
“My seagull?” hollered Karlini. “You
used my seagull to tell that oversize
vulture to drop that Lion maniac off
here and let him loose to ﬁght every-
thing in sight?”

“Thought I not liked seagull you,”
muttered Haddo.
“That’s beside the point!
Whether
I like having that seagull around is
-” Karlini stopped and tried to pull
himself together. Above Haddo’s head
and across the lawn he had a remark-
able view of the Lion in question half-
risen from Shaa’s couch, his face an
archetype of incredulity even with an
icebag drooping down past one eye, one
hand supporting him and the other
waving in the air as though seeking
for something yielding to crush; across
from him, his son had one of his hands
half-raised as though to protect his
own throat. Karlini resolutely turned
his back.
He’d had it with carnage,
he’d had it with feuds, he’d had it with
trying to help out everyone else when
he couldn’t keep his own life from sink-
ing ever-deeper into its own mess. “If

you’re working for me, Haddo, you’re
working for me, not off running your
own side games and getting me ground
up in the gears. Now once and for all,
are you working for me?”
“Yes,” said Haddo, “and no.”
“What was that?” croaked Dortonn,
arching his neck to peer across the
lawn in the direction from which the
still-echoing despairing-voiced call of
“ARRGH!” seemed to have emanated.
“As long as no open warfare follows it
is safe to ignore,” Svin told him, thread-
ing his way carefully amidst the wreck-
age and toward the Shaas in the street.
It would be too bad if the Great Kar-
lini succumbed to his own growing ten-
dency toward madness before he had
the chance for a recuperative nap, but
Svin decided that any intervention on
his part would have to wait. Karlini’s
holler had more exasperation than true

loss-of-mind insanity in it, anyway, al-
though he would clearly bear watching.
But Karlini was not the issue at the mo-
ment. “Shaa,” Svin declared, removing
Dortonn from his shoulder and arrang-
ing him on his feet. Or, rather, “Shaas,”
he amended. “Dortonn has news.”
Both Shaas raised their right eye-
brows at an identical angle.
“Yes?”
they said.
Dortonn
shook
himself
out
and
spoke, still looking like the result of
some barely competent necromantic
conjuration and sounding as though
he was unsure whether he was in or
out of the grave. “I have achieved con-
tact with my master. He is free of the
ring.
He is not quite incarnate, but
he is not entirely dead either. I have
done my best to stabilize his condition
but I am too far away to be fully effec-
tive.
I am not in condition to travel

on my own and Pod Dall is unlikely
to appear in this doorway under his
own motivation. Who will assist me?”
He glanced behind him, where Karlini
staring down and his cloaked assis-
tant glaring up were lambasting each
other and waving their ﬁsts in the air.
“Haddo?” he said dubiously.
“I will help you,” said Svin. “You may
need to be dragged. Haddo would not
be of much beneﬁt.”
“Thank you for such an attractive of-
fer,” Dortonn squawked.
“Is that the
best I can do?”
“Be careful what you wish for,” mur-
mured Shaa.
Dortonn followed the
direction of his gaze. Svin, of course,
had detected the ﬂamboyant approach
of the stalking Lion without the need
of turning his back. Actually, Shaa con-
sidered, the two of them made an in-
terestingly didactic comparison: both

ex-barbarians, both appallingly compe-
tent in matters martial, at least on a
tactical scale, but each with an entirely
different demeanor and outlook on life.
To whit:
“Stop looking like somebody died,”
snarled the Lion, casting around him
with a belligerent glare.
“Did some-
body die? It’s amazing any of you are
still alive.”
“Thank you for your motivating re-
marks,” Shaa told him.
“As long as
you’re here, you might as well do some-
thing useful.”
“I’ll go rescue Maximillian. He does
need rescuing, right?”
“That might not be so useful.”
“I thought he was your partner.
Where I come from when your part-
ner’s in trouble you -”
“This has been a long story,” said
Shaa, “of which you have missed the

last several volumes.
Trust me on
this.”
“You’re all a pack of nitwits!” the
Lion bellowed.
This latest outburst
froze his offspring in their tracks. The
next-generation Monts had been edg-
ing tentatively closer to the group, look-
ing somewhat the worse for wear from
their own private reunion with their
sire, and were now clearly reconsider-
ing the idea of remaining anywhere in
the same city with him at the moment.
“That may be true,” Shaa said, con-
sidering the imposition of a curse of his
own, “but is still largely irrelevant. In
any case there is an important mission
at hand for you.”
“I’ll accept no missions from you
while Maximillian rots in the pit!” With
that, the Lion turned on his heel and
stalked off again, with the aggressive
glower of a man looking for someone to

kick.
Shaa gazed after him for a moment,
then turned back to his sister.
Eden
got the conversational jump on him
this time, though.
“You’re not send-
ing me off on some errand so I’ll miss
seeing what happens to our brother,”
she declared. “I’m sure the thought’s
crossed your mind, so just tell it to
head right out again.”
“Are you ﬁnished?” Shaa said.
“Al-
though it is true that a plan of sorts is
consolidating even as we speak, what
you accuse was not one of its features.
Trust,” he told her in an only-between-
us tone of voice, “is a commodity in dan-
ger of short supply.
Among all these
actors who can be depended on implic-
itly?”
“Arznaak?”
“Hm, you have a point. But what we
can trust our brother for is to act as

directly as possible against our inter-
ests. While there may be some use to
be gained there it’s not much to build a
counter-strategy around. Indeed -”
“Why is all we seem to do just stand
around and talk?” ranted the Great
Karlini, from his new position barely
an arm’s-length away.
“Arznaak’s
the only one who’s out accomplishing
things.”
“Thank you for coming over,” Shaa
said mildly, wondering whether to in-
quire after Haddo’s employment sta-
tus, and for that matter health. But no,
there was Haddo lurking along behind
him, doing his imitation of a shadow
draped over an ambulating rock.
“I
was just about to get you, since you
play such a central role in the plan
at hand. My own skill is too rusty to
trust, and someone must ensure that
the experiments in your late facility

remain suppressed.”
Some might deem it cruel to dis-
patch him to the scene of recent trauma.
Shaa, however, had the thin hope some
catharsis might result, in addition to
the satisfaction of the explicit require-
ments of the mission.
Unfortunately,
Karlini was not particularly amenable
to the plan. In his uncharacteristically
belligerent manner, he shoved his face
close to Shaa’s and snarled, “You’re not
going to park me in some corner where
nothing’s happening, so you can just
give up trying. I’m not about to nose
over and fall apart.”
Is there an echo in here? Shaa won-
dered. He seemed to recall hearing a
surprisingly similar statement mere
moments before.
He draped an arm
over Karlini’s shoulder and led him -
dragged him, to be more precise - a few
steps away, while murmuring in his

ear. “The sector of your laboratory is
scarcely a backwater,” Shaa told him.
“You recall my earlier misgivings, I’m
sure, so you will appreciate I do not
proclaim this to everyone, but I am not
conﬁdent that all of your engineered
microbes have been destroyed.
My
own abilities were insufﬁcient to de-
tect residual signs of activity, but con-
sider this - if any of these pets survive
to enter the population, the plague of
unconstrained second-quantum level
effects could wreak untold havoc. Who
else here can I trust to make certain
they are all well and truly dead?
It
may require an extended watch, in
case any of them are lurking below,
waiting for the right moment to es-
cape surveillance and spring again to
action.”
“I’m sure everything’s dead,” Karlini
said morosely, although not, Shaa was

pleased to note, with the same com-
bative anger directed at him.
“Even
if something survived, you’re treating
it like it’s intelligent, like it can plan
ahead.
You’re anthropomorphizing
something you can’t even see.”
“Intelligent or not, the end result
might be the same unfortunate one
either way.
Take an escort with you
just in case.
Perhaps Tildamire and
her untimely father?”
“Urr„” grumbled Karlini, but this
time he didn’t say no. Good, that took
care of one theater of operations, and
three of their players. The other Mont
could go along with Svin and Dortonn.
On to Haddo and Wroclaw, then, or to
be more precise Haddo-and-Wroclaw
together now, followed by a private
word to Wroclaw before they set off.
“I
would
like
some
intelligence,”
Shaa told the pair, “and please be

so kind as to omit the obvious dispar-
agements, hm?
There are questions
on the table concerning the ‘how’ of
my brother’s inexorable ascent.
I be-
lieve your pal Favored has channels
to the gods, yes? Gashanatantra and
Jill-tang have been incompletely forth-
coming, and prudence would dictate
consulting an outside source regard-
less.
Whatever your status at the
moment with the Great one, this is in
your own interest too,” he added.
“Agree do I,” said Haddo, in a note
of compliance astonishing for its con-
tradiction of the current dismal tide.
What nefarious purpose could lie be-
hind his sudden affability? Other than
Shaa’s
growing
feeling,
warranted
though it was by the circumstances,
that they were all out to harass him
to death? But be that as it might, he
was left with Eden, and the crustacean

brother of the Archivist, and for that
matter the Archivist herself. Well, he
would handle that one. If -
Someone he had been trying to ig-
nore pugnaciously cleared his throat.
“Very well,” Shaa told the Jill-tang
agent, impatiently glowering atop his
restive horse, “here is my message for
you. Does anyone have a pen?”

Chapter17
“THANK YOU FOR THE ESCORT,”
Leen told the leader of the troop of
the Emperor’s Own who had accom-
panied her back from the dungeon
to her apartment.
She had always
suspected that the wide-ranging cat-
acombs, of which the dungeons and
the Archives were both prominent con-
stituents, formed a common basement
stretching beneath many of the indi-
vidual above-ground buildings of the

palace complex, but she had never
witnessed the objective evidence until
now.
She had gone underground in
the Hall of Memories which housed
the Archives and had now emerged
into her own residence wing several
ediﬁces to the west.
“You’re quite welcome, mum,” said
the captain.
His courtliness did not
improve her mood; all it underlined
was the elite nature of her chaper-
ones.
These were the dragoons who
appeared when it was necessary to
cart off a member of the elite.
They
were clearly expert in preserving ap-
pearances and the crust of formality,
but there was little doubt in her mind
that their martial skills were not less-
ened by their attention to manners.
Quite the opposite, most logically.
But manners were manners.
The
captain watched as she unlocked the

door, then made to enter just behind
her.
Leen had anticipated the move,
however, and had been considering
how to turn it to her advantage. “Cap-
tain!” she protested.
“I am here to
change clothes, at least those were my
orders.
Surely yours were restricted
to accompanying me from place to
place, not assisting me directly with
my gown.”
The captain scrutinized her for a mo-
ment. “As my orders are to ensure you
arrive in a safe and timely manner at
the Imperial box, appropriately attired
and coiffed, I suppose there is that
room for interpretation. Allow my men
to inspect your rooms ﬁrst, to warrant
against any lurking eventuality that
might interfere.
Following that, we
will remain at your disposal, in case
you need any assistance with hooks
or stays, or in the unlikely event that

our mutual schedule becomes pressed.
In this way decorum may be balanced
against the demands of duty.”
“I quite agree, captain,” Leen said,
awarding him the mild smile appropri-
ate for the situation. “You are a man of
taste and discretion.”
He returned a modest bow. “That is
my job, my lady.”
And just what was a job, these days?
She herself had been spending less
and less of her work day performing
the standard functions of an Archivist,
trading her time instead for intrigues
and exhumations. Yet there was still
no obvious alternative to continuing
along that path; people were depend-
ing on her, not least of all the unfortu-
nate Tarfon, who had been left, to all
evidence, sealed up in a tunnel with no
active exit and no easy route back, and
without a light to boot.
Ignoring her

responsibilities had every promise of
merely making things worse.
Sooner
or later the Scapula would be back,
or Max, or if not them than surely
someone else.
But was this all she could do in the
meantime? Get dressed for a ball?
She could scarcely escape by climb-
ing from her fourth-ﬂoor balcony. There
was the carp pool below to cushion a
drop, but the captain would certainly
station an observer in the gardens. A
chorus of aggrieved shrieking from
within the apartment suggested she
could disguise herself as Florence, her
maid, but when Florence emerged a
moment later under guard and re-
lieved
of
her
hairpin,
that
option
dropped resoundingly from the list. If
she had been thinking ahead instead of
with a mind clouded by eager thoughts
of Max, she could have commanded the

oracle to reveal any secret entrances or
exits in the vicinity of the apartment.
Well, when the time came perhaps she
would be able to think of something.
The captain ushered her into her
own suite, expressing regret at the ad-
visability of retaining Florence outside
under care until she had recovered
from her bout of antisociability. Leen
was more than willing to have the cap-
tain assume the burden. She had in-
herited Florence from her sister, likely
both as a spy on her personal life and a
goad to make that life more interesting
to Susannah; Susannah was not given
to practical jokes or she would have
suspected that as well.
In any case,
Florence in the best of times had an ex-
citable temperament. At the moment -
well, let the captain deal with it.
The captain’s men had searched
her rooms earnestly but without, re-

markably enough,
leaving anything
obviously broken or dramatically out
of place.
She was all the more sur-
prised, then, having locked the front
door behind her and wandered into
the bedroom to check her wardrobe for
the correct formal state-wear, to dis-
cover that the room was not, in fact,
unoccupied.
“The window,” explained
Zalzyn Shaa, seated comfortably at
the foot of the bed, “preceded by the
roof, preceded by an attempt at a more
straightforward entry from the hall.
The hall, however, was invested by
your friends.”
“I didn’t notice you,” Leen said, some-
what dazed.
“I saw Colonel Houda’s
widow peeping around her doorframe
but that was all.”
“Yes, well. Some,” said Shaa incred-
ulously, as though amazed at the very
idea, “have called me surreptitious.”

“But wait a minute - weren’t there
guards outside in the garden too?
Didn’t they see you climbing in the
window?”
“Of course there were guards,” Shaa
said, “it’s scarcely worth doing if there
aren’t guards.” Leen didn’t know him
well enough to be certain when he
was being sarcastic, but then she had
gathered it was safe to assume he was
being sarcastic all the time. “But no,”
he went on. “They didn’t see me. Or
shall we say I would seriously doubt it.
Might I suggest your formal livery as a
Nerve?”
“What? Oh, right. It is a Knitting,
isn’t it.”
“Just so.” Shaa popped from the bed
with a spry bounce and ambled toward
the door. “Perhaps I’ll wait in the sit-
ting room while you attend to your in-
frastructure.”

“Thank you,” said Leen. “Thank you
very much.”
“No problem at all,” he called, now
ﬁrmly out of sight in the other room.
“Did you build these?”
“What, the stuff on the étagère?”
Leen yelled back, trying to decide if
she had time for a shower; trying to de-
cide if there was any chance of avoiding
it. She clenched her teeth and edged
in front of the mirror - a shower, deﬁ-
nitely, without question.
Fortunately
the palace apartments were quite well
appointed in matters of plumbing and
other luxury services, and the central
water pressure was generally more
than adequate. “Uh, yes. Actually, yes
and no. The originals came from the
Archives, books of course. You can see
they’re paper?
I had them copied - I
wouldn’t cut up the old ones, of course.”
“Of course.
These began as ﬂat

sheets of paper with schematic dia-
grams of assembly?”
“Diagrams, yes, but it was as much
just a matter of ﬁtting the symbols to-
gether. An idle diversion, I’m sure, cut-
ting out paper sculptures.”
“There’s no need to apologize for
yourself to me of all people,” Shaa said,
balancing the level of his voice between
that necessary to pierce the patter of
the shower at the low end and that
loud enough to alert the guards out-
side. “I’ve spent far too much of my life
in exactly that position to require it
of others. What a marvelous structure
this one is, this tower.” He stepped back
and contemplated the assemblage for-
mally, as though it were an exhibit in
a gallery. “The open lattice-work sides,
the curves on these four stouter legs
merging into such a graceful upward
thrust.
And judging from the scale

of the windows on this observation
level, it would have been easily, oh, al-
most two hundred person-heights tall.
Imagine that.
One might as well be
stepping backward through time and
standing shoulder to shoulder with the
ancients, although obviously this was
some special monument even for them
or such a model would never have been
commissioned.
And next to it on the
shelf, this ship. Observe how low it sits
to the waterline, the smooth and cun-
ningly sealed deck, this narrow dorsal
ﬁn.”
“I agree,” Leen gurgled. “It appears
to be some species of submersible.”
“Remarkable. I would keep this col-
lection from Maximillian, however. At
least until you’ve made your mind up
about him.”
“Oh? Why is that?”
“He’d fall in love with you over these

alone. Of course,” Shaa added thought-
fully, “he might try to walk off with
them too, but then that’s always the
risk you run with Max.
So did you
make an attempt to rescue him, or is
that escort outside the door just a new
affectation?”
“Yes, I tried.
He was gone.” The
explanation behind that remarkable
fact carried her past the ﬁnale of her
admittedly abbreviated shower and
through a round of vigorous toweling
to boot. “Do you think he escaped?” she
concluded.
“With Max that is always a possi-
bility,” Shaa mused. “I am inclined to
think he did have some active role in
not being there; the efﬁgy on the bed of
restraint in his stead does suggest his
personal touch.”
“But if he didn’t escape on his own,
as I think you seem to be implying, and

you didn’t help him, then who did?”
“The most cost-effective way to get
that answer is to wait until he shows
up, and ask him. I suppose you could
have had that oracle machine of yours
tell you where he went, but you never
made it back there, did you, and when
you set out in the ﬁrst place it was be-
cause it had told you he was in the cell.
Not that I think it was lying, or trying
to get you in trouble, mind you; not nec-
essarily. But you do have to watch your
step around these old machines. Look
at the fate of the unfortunate Tarfon.
Have you given any thought to extract-
ing her before she starves?”
“Yes, right. I’ll ask the Emperor to
turn me loose so I can open up the se-
cret passage into his dungeon. What
about you? Do you have a plan?”
“In fact,” Shaa said, “I do, at least a
tentative one, at least if your brother

can get into your Archives and survive
the experience, and could legitimately
wear your ring of ofﬁce.”
“That could work,” Leen said. “You
want to send him alone? Do you think
you could do anything with the com-
puter?”
“Not I,” said Shaa, shaking his head
regretfully.
“Max would be the one.
Indeed, you could say Max has been
training himself his entire life for this
opportunity, even if he failed to make
much headway the time he was there
with you.
Of course, one has to ask
oneself what Max would do with the
opportunity once it was in his grasp.
But enough speculation in that quar-
ter, I suppose; after all Max’s is not the
only strand in this story. The Hand, for
example, have been heard from again,
and my brother has been up to more
than his share of nastiness. Would you

like to hear about it?”
Shaa’s own subsequent exposition
took Leen into her outﬁt of state,
an
absurdly
gaudy
ensemble
with
its sparkling slouch cap and bright
spinal weave and ﬂashing dendritic
arborizations swooping out across her
back; thank goodness for the hat, at
least, which let her get away with
a minimum of attention to her hair.
She managed to get all the fasten-
ers squared up herself, even without
the nattering help of Florence, then
squared her shoulders and went out
into the sitting room. Shaa had moved
to an assiduous examination of the con-
tents of her own local ﬂoor-to-ceiling
wall of the Archives. “It’s too bad my
lodgings weren’t rendered totally un-
inhabitable,” he added,
scrutinizing
her incunabular Horst Villaments. “I
could move in with you, sleep on this

couch, and have enough reading mate-
rial within reach without setting foot
on the ﬂoor to last for the next ﬁve
years.”
“While I’m on my honeymoon you
can stay up here and watch the place.”
“How about while you’re locked up
at the command of the new Emperor?”
Shaa suggested blandly.
“No, I sup-
pose that wouldn’t do; all your posses-
sions might be forfeit to the state.” He
straightened up and brushed off his
hands.
Leen crossed her arms and stood in
the doorway. “So I see you’re busy and
thanks for coming by, but as long as
you’re here would you mind helping me
escape?”
“Now why would you want to do
something like that? I would think at
the right hand of the Emperor is not a
bad place to be.”

“Ha
ha,”
Leen
said
deliberately.
“Right. Are you saying you can’t help
me, or you won’t?”
“Can’t now, might be able to later.
Did you see those ﬁve ﬁne fellows out-
side with your other friends, the ones
without any weapons except those odd
little daggers, the ones with the light-
ning bolt insignia above their unit
patches?
They’re elite commando
types.
I’d have to use spell-work
to sneak you away, and that’s just
what that squad’s trained for. Unless
their reputation is based totally on air,
which I would certainly not count on,
we wouldn’t get far.”
“But couldn’t I just go out with you
the way you came in? Didn’t you use
magic for that?”
“No magic, just physical condition-
ing and a lack of sound good sense
and the recent rebound boost to my

metabolism you already know about,
and something in my heredity that
makes me comfortable hanging off
ledges and trees.
I am also, as you
see, appropriately cloaked in black. It
wouldn’t be safe, trust me.”
“So I have to go out there and sit in
the very place the Scapula is bound to
see me when he pulls whatever he’s
bound to pull.
And if I survive the
Scapula’s attention there’s always the
Emperor’s.”
“If you survive my brother you can
blame
his
machinations
for
every-
thing,” Shaa pointed out. “You might
want to do that anyway as soon as you
get the Emperor’s ear. Believe me, my
friend, you may ﬁnd yourself the most
strategic asset of all.”
“I’m sure being an asset goes hand-
in-glove with serious hazard,” Leen
said, her expression gloomy.

“You’ve been reading the manual,”
Shaa observed.
“I suppose you know because you
wrote it.”
“That claim is far too generous,” said
Shaa, poo-pooingly. “I could rightfully
claim no more than contributor credit.
Maximillian -”
He was interrupted by a deliberate
rap on the front door. “My lady?” came
the captain’s voice. “Do you require as-
sistance?”
“No, thank you!” Leen called.
She
and
Shaa
had
been
keeping
their
voices low; there was no evidence they
had been overheard.
But it would
clearly be best not to give her escort
the suspicion to come in and check
around again.
“I’ll be ready in a mo-
ment!”
“Very well,” said the captain.
“We
await.”

“I’m sure you do,” murmured Leen.
She swung back to Shaa, then hesi-
tated.
“You look quite striking,” Shaa of-
fered. “All elements of your trousseau
seem in place.”
Leen gave him a dirty look.
“I’ve
been thinking about all this,
your
brother in particular.
Where did he
get all the knowledge he’s needed to
make himself a god, and the rest of
it? He hasn’t been in the Archives - I
don’t think that information is in the
Archives, I’ve certainly never found it,
but you’d think he would have made
the effort... unless there was no need
for it. Is this - is this knowledge part of
your family lore, is that why he didn’t
need to research it? Do you have the
same insight he does?”
“I was wondering if you would pick
up on that question. The proximate an-

swer is no, I am not privy to the in-
ner workings of his behind-the-scenes
machinations, but I have been asking
myself the same questions. I suspect
my brother has cultivated a confeder-
ate. And not the ones we know about,
either, the ones he’s already betrayed.”
It made sense.
It felt right.
But
there was more.
“That might imply
this confederate shares the same goal
as your brother,” Leen thought out loud.
“But which goal? Making the Scapula
master of the world? Dethroning the
other gods?”
“I would think the latter,” said Shaa.
“It would be reasonable to assume this
hidden associate to be closer to the cen-
ter of my brother’s plots, which would
also imply a fuller understanding on
their part of my brother’s carnivorous
habits and past history, which in turn
would imply they would have a plan to

offset Arznaak’s inevitable treachery...
or would think they have such a plan.”
“Maybe this other person really is
clever enough to outwit your brother -
you don’t think so? You wouldn’t bet
against your brother, then?”
“Would you?
When he’s on such a
major roll?
My brother has a regu-
lar diet of appetizers made from peo-
ple who thought they had the drop
on him.
But you’re right, this case
might be different. As you started off,
we’re postulating this compatriot to
have knowledge Arznaak needs but
can’t yet duplicate himself - unless my
brother has already chewed them up
and thrown them away. I don’t think
that’s happened yet, frankly, since I
still seem to feel the whiff of an ad-
ditional motivator behind the scenes.
But unless my brother has fallen in
love with this accomplice - which I

suppose is possible, although where
he’d ﬁnd a puff adder who could give
him this level of assistance I’d never
know - then clearly the way to bet is
against this accomplice being long for
this world.
“So.” Shaa pivoted on his heel and
paced deliberately back in the other
direction along the rug. “Whoever this
hypothetical co-conspirator might be,
my brother would know better than
to trust them, which means he would
do his best not to be dependent on
them, which means he would throw
himself into learning everything he
could about the guts of their contribu-
tion as fast as he could, so as to be
able to do without them when the time
came...
but then again things have
been moving so quickly, he may have
run out of time to learn everything he
needs to know. Or maybe his confrere

really is clever enough to successfully
keep their secrets intact, making their
expectation for longevity greater than
a matter of minutes.”
“But can anyone stand up to your
brother indeﬁnitely?
Wouldn’t your
brother think of a way to outsmart
them and double-cross them eventu-
ally? Wouldn’t that be his priority?”
Shaa faced her with an expression of
pensive intensity. “When we ﬁnd this
confederate,” he said, “we will have to
convince them of just these facts.
If
we want to stop my brother, he may al-
ready be so powerful as to make this
our last remaining chance.”

Chapter18
A WALKING CORPSE and an inhu-
man ﬁghting machine, and him, the
kid, Jurtan Mont thought; a scenario
drawn straight from the ﬂimsy pages
of one of those pulpish romances his
father had kept throwing at him in
the hope he’d absorb their spark and
amount to something. Something vio-
lent, the wilder and more bloodthirsty
the better.
Except now that he had,
more or less, Dad still hated him. And

his sister wasn’t too happy with him
either.
Well, who needed a father like that
anyway?
He would just have to do
what he had to do and let the family
members fall where they may.
After
all, he was surrounded by the object
lessons of families gone bad; all you
had to do was look at the Shaas and
the discussion was over right there. If
you needed an encore there were the
Karlinis, and even -
“Are you paying attention?”
That was Svin.
Now that Jurtan
thought about it, that was probably
not the ﬁrst time he had asked the
question, either. “Of course I am,” said
Jurtan.
“He’s up there.
No question
about it.”
“I already told you that,” croaked
Dortonn.
Why don’t you just go ahead and die,

already? Jurtan thought, but he knew
better than to say something like that
out loud.
Although with the biting
glare Dortonn shot him, perhaps even
thinking it had been too loud; Dortonn
was a master sorcerer, after all, and
one not nearly so benign as the Great
Karlini, even if it was difﬁcult to ﬁg-
ure out how he could possibly still be
alive given the damage he was display-
ing across his body. Even the outline
of Dortonn’s shape beneath the black
cloak he had wrapped loosely around
himself appeared lumpish and gnarled,
with protrusions where none were typ-
ically found, and similarly unexpected
concavities. But not only was Dortonn
alive, but he seemed to have gotten
his second wind, of all things, scuttling
with them step-for-step through the
lamp-lit evening streets toward the
Boulevard of the Gods; scuttling, true,

except for the stretch where Svin had
hoisted him across his shoulder like a
dressed carcass.
They had arrived, now, however, at
the spot along the Boulevard to which
their various instincts and senses had
led them. This location had turned out
to be the edge of a moat, or more of a
small lake, really. Rising straight from
the water in the midst of the lake, with-
out even the beneﬁt of a modest island
for footing, was a tall spindly tower
with a bulbous seedpod-like apartment
swelling from the top. How tall? Ten
stories, at least, had been Svin’s es-
timate, and the professional gaze he
had allotted it before rendering his
assessment had made it clear he had
signiﬁcant experience with this type of
architecture; from scaling and enter-
ing during his more barbaric days, no
doubt. “This god’s not exactly welcom-

ing worshipers, is he?” said Jurtan.
“The Lord of Storms draws his po-
tency in other ways,” Dortonn rasped.
“This is your idea,” Svin reminded
him. “Do you have a plan or should I
look for a boat? I am not prepared to
swim,” he added. In examining the wa-
ter they had seen ﬁns.
“Hang on a minute,” said Jurtan.
The situation was strikingly reminis-
cent of the one with which Jurtan had
begun his career of adventuring, such
as it was, when he had stood with Za-
lzyn Shaa gazing across another body
of water at an island stronghold into
which they had intended to penetrate.
The situation was similar, but then
many signiﬁcant elements were differ-
ent, too. Shaa was somewhere else, for
one, and more importantly he, Jurtan,
had been given trust as a potentially
helpful member of the company.
His

promise, though, had still to be re-
deemed, so he was trying his best to
get to work.
The trick, Jurtan thought, was mak-
ing himself receptive in the same man-
ner as when he’d followed the Intuition
Track with Max, trying to listen for
anything that might be out of place
or didn’t ﬁt the context.
There was
the feel of the breeze from the west,
the lapping sounds of the lake water
against the bank and the splash of
leaping ﬁsh, the cold presence of the
tower... and there had to be a business
entrance somewhere.
They had spot-
ted no boat dock, and the barred door
set in the tower wall a person-height
above the waterline had the braying
clarity of the lure to an obvious trap.
This hypothetical entrance would have
to be concealed well enough so that
the average watcher would not be able

to descry trafﬁckers going in or out,
while being comfortable enough not to
inconvenience the fragile manners of
a visiting god by making them slink
through a mud-bank, for example. In
fact, short of the use of concealing il-
lusion, which of course could scarcely
be ruled out, there was no place along
the bank that seemed to allow for both
the opportunities of access and conceal-
ment. Perhaps they should look for a
camouﬂaged person-carrying ballista?
But no, wait. Jurtan slowly turned
his head. That sloshing of water, that
crack and slap of waves off to their left
along the bank of the moat - there was
something wrong about it. It was out of
proportion, that was it; there was more
sound than the mild motion of the wa-
ter there could account for.
Jurtan unhooded his lantern enough
for a thin beam to escape and led them

toward the spot. As they approached,
they were forced to edge away from
the moat due to the thickening bul-
rushes and the swampy condition of
the ground, but then the swish of the
marsh grass started growing in his
consciousness too, growing and then
abruptly falling off. Did that signal a
path? - yes, there it was, a trail of ﬁrm
ground that twisted behind a shrub
and subsided quickly off a low hill
down toward the lake.
Then, not far
from the water’s formal edge, his inter-
nal orchestra made a suddenly hollow
echo.
Jurtan raised his hand to hold
back the others and knelt carefully
down.
His music was shifting keys and
rhythms in a disconcerting manner;
there was something here now it didn’t
like. The disguised entrance to a tun-
nel under the moat was around here,

you didn’t have to have any special
abilities to recognize that, but it was
only logical to presume that along with
the tunnel came some trap. That was
what the music was trying to tell him...
wasn’t it?
Maybe he should consult
with the others. After all, this wasn’t
explicitly a test, was it?
- although
it might as well be.
Part of the test,
though, could be of his good judgment,
to see whether he knew when to ask
for help and could sublimate his ego
enough to actually do it. Jurtan cast
a quick glance over his shoulder, just
checking his alternatives, really. There
was Svin doing his big-cat imitation,
poised on the balls of his feet with his
eyes scanning and nose snifﬁng and
sword ready to hit dervish-overdrive at
the slightest provocation.
But where
was - “Dortonn?” Jurtan mouthed.
“He is resting back on solid ground,”

hissed Svin.
“He is drinking Shaa’s
restorative concoction. Do you have a
problem?”
“Just checking for traps,” Jurtan
told him. How could Svin quarrel with
that? If it was Max, now, there would
be no question; lack of justiﬁcation
hadn’t stopped Max from his sharp cri-
tique as long as Jurtan had known him,
which felt far too long even if Max was
now being tortured in a dungeon.
If
there was anything to this karma stuff
he had clearly brought it on himself.
So -
So why was he procrastinating? It
had become apparent to Jurtan that
the small hillock in front of him could
be moved, swirls of marsh grass and
all; that it was, in fact, an entrance
to the tunnel. The obvious thing to do
was ﬁnd the trigger for the door and
then enter through it.
Except...
he

was hanging back because something
didn’t ﬁt.
Was it too obvious?
Jur-
tan supposed it was possible that the
true entrance was really found a block
away, in the basement of some appar-
ently unrelated building entirely. His
internal accompaniment didn’t think
much of that idea, though, and try as
he might he could detect no querulous
scent or drifting specter to draw his
attention back across the moor to the
more typical structures that ringed it.
There was another concept to try,
though. Jurtan rose back to a crouch
and edged carefully around the cam-
ouﬂaged door. Chittering away in the
underbrush up ahead was a muskrat
or some such small animal. Not that
Jurtan claimed to know much of any-
thing about small animals, but weren’t
they supposed to quiet down when a
larger animal who might potentially

use their noisemaking to guide itself
toward lunch happened by?
A larger
animal like, say, Jurtan?
He headed
toward the sound of the animal, what-
ever it was.
There was indeed a continuation
of the path.
Around the next stand
of grass and through another patch
of standing water that seemed home
primarily to a horde of hungry gnats,
Jurtan’s music was now picking up
tempo expectantly.
He could almost
hear something sizzling. Sizzling? No,
that much must have been his imagi-
nation, but here on the ground was a
nest, and within the nest, eggs.
The
nest’s guardian was not in evidence.
The subliminal sound of frying did
persist, though, and now with it was
the gentlest whiff of cooked breakfast.
Tentatively, Jurtan reached out for the
nest, rolling ﬁrst one egg, then (at the

urging of his accompaniment) a speciﬁc
second. With only a puff of displaced
air and lacking the slightest sound, a
section of the grassy knoll beyond the
nest dropped smoothly away, revealing
a stairway leading downward.
The
treads glowed faintly past the range of
the lantern.
“There was another entrance?” Svin
asked from behind him. “What was the
problem with the ﬁrst one?”
“It was a decoy,” Jurtan explained.
“It would have led us to ruin.”
“It is good you realized it, then,”
said Svin. “I will fetch Dortonn.” Svin
clapped him lightly on the shoulder.
Jurtan was amazed not to ﬁnd himself
driven into the ground; Svin obviously
did know his strength, and could be
delicate when the need arose. “We will
see the value of your work when we
travel below,” Svin added, then disap-

peared silently back up the path.
Jurtan was still trying to decide if
that remark had been a kudo or a
warning when an equally hushful Svin
made his return, again toting Dortonn.
Jurtan had also used the time for addi-
tional reﬂection, however. “This is the
door,” he reafﬁrmed.
“But should we
be using the door? What about guards
and retainers?”
“For any problems that lie ahead,”
said Svin, “you will detect them, Dor-
tonn will blast them, and I will slice
them. Then there will be no problems.”
“I guess that sounds like a plan,” Ju-
rtan had to acknowledge.
The Emperor-designate’s box of of-
ﬁce occupied an expansive dais atop
an uncomfortably slender pillar at
the stage-edge of the parade ground
of the Stadium of State.
They had

reached its pinnacle using an elevator
lift within the pillar. The elevator’s mo-
tive power had been concealed either
atop or below, but its progress in jerks
and starts, the ferociously thrumming
vibrations of its ﬂoor, and a wholly per-
ceptible lateral swaying behavior made
Leen wish she was taking the service
stairs that wound about the lift’s open
shaft in coil after apparently endless
coil, regardless of the distance to the
zenith.
Still, the Emperor-designate
must have traveled this route him-
self, and even though he was given to
the display of a certain obtuse nature
on occasion, he had never engaged in
out-and-out recklessness or an obvious
bent toward suicide. Furthermore, in
light of the events of the Running of
the Squids - remarkably, that calami-
tous midday was still only hours past
- the Imperial engineers must have

been over the entire vicinity with a
paranoid sieve. Regardless of all this
rationality, however, Leen was might-
ily relieved to disembark, all in one
piece, on the observation gallery level
below the open-air box itself.
The captain of her guard-escort trot-
ted up the grand stair to determine the
Emperor’s proximate pleasure, leaving
Leen, her guardians diligent around
her, to take in the spectacle through
the broad open windows.
The expan-
sive parade-ground was a carpet of
torches and the globes and stream-
ers of wizard lights, illuminating the
throngs of Imperial ofﬁce-holders and
functionaries, Bones and Ligaments
and Muscles, Nerves and Vessels and
Viscera, both Lesser and Greater; con-
stituent parts of the Corpus galore.
It was one measure of them to see
them on a daily basis scurrying around

the palace grounds or executing the
required annual Organ System ma-
neuvers - there were always so many
of them underfoot even as it was -
but to have them all assembling in
a single place for a uniﬁed purpose,
rank upon rank and legion upon le-
gion, was enough to make one consider
just what all these people actually did,
and wonder whether the Empire might
be better served by posting more of its
staff abroad or divesting itself of them
entirely.
Merely thinking those sentiments
now and here, though, was probably
treasonous enough to warrant some
severe and unimaginative decree, and
was plainly out of keeping with the
mood of raucous revelry; better to just
goggle at the spectacle and tip any er-
rant philosopher over the guardrail to
be devoured by the masses below. Al-

though below was not the only option
- the same result could be achieved by
heaving the soothsayer off to the side.
As tall as this pylon was - ﬁve stories?
ten?
- the grandstands surrounding
the ﬁeld mounted even higher.
Tier
upon tier, their stone benches groaning
beneath the stamp of the thronging
spectators still ﬂooding in for this cli-
mactic ofﬁcial ceremony, their waving
banners and frothing kegs at every
hand,
sparklers and small skyrock-
ets waving and arcing in hazardous
deﬁance of all regulation, the bleach-
ers would have unquestionably col-
lapsed at some Knitting long before
this if the entire stadium had not been
built sunken into the ground, with the
grandstands supported on berms of
earth.
Between Knittings the hippodrome
was used for sporting events and the oc-

casional pageant, and Leen was aware
of at least three sorcerous duels in the
last ﬁfty years fought within its con-
ﬁnes (although surprisingly enough
not one had led to its ruin), but the real
reason for its existence, right and truly
enough, was on display all around
her now. Or to be precise in a differ-
ent direction, the reason was walking
around in the crow’s-nest above her
head.
Having been instrumental in
heading off the latest surge toward re-
forming the traditional system of nepo-
tistic succession several years before,
the Emperor-designate (then merely a
Ventricle-in-Waiting rather than the
full Heart he would thereafter assume,
of course) had secured his prospects
of being here today, and had wasted
no time in setting in motion certain
tasteful, if surreptitious, preparations.
But then that was merely traditional

as well. He had not done anything so
blatant as to urge his uncle onward
toward his retirement - in either a
conversational or a more lethal man-
ner - but his uncle had been no fool
either, and had acted to declare him-
self dead-in-state after waiting a de-
cent interval and playing up a series
of small strokes, but before his total
incapacitation or out-and-out demise.
That previous Emperor was now holed
up somewhere on the continent with
his personal troops and his sinecure
and his gradually unspooling memoirs,
and of course his not inconsiderable
residual deterrent capabilities, leaving
behind him the still-circulating spec-
ulations concerning why he broken
with tradition to this extent, leaving
on his own feet rather than with those
extremities preceding him.
Ah, politics. Leen might hate it but

you couldn’t ignore it, because it wasn’t
about to ignore you. And neither was
the Emperor-designate, apparently, for
here came her captain to usher her up
the stair and into the presence of the
great man himself. He was not yet oc-
cupying the central throne on its ﬁnal
sky-reaching spire, but rather circulat-
ing among his intimates and raising
an occasional benedictory hand to the
mob in the stands around them.
To
Leen’s eye he did not look particularly
nervous, which is to say his demeanor
did not reﬂect at the moment an appre-
ciation of the larger hazards at hand.
But then he had come down to the
dungeon to consult Max, of course, and
he had had her brought here as well.
It would be wise, therefore, she had al-
ready decided, to treat him as though
he knew what he was doing.
On the other hand, it would be wiser

not to be here at all, but that didn’t
seem to be an active option. Perhaps
-
The Emperor-designate looked at
her, and past her, at whomever was
coming up the grand stair from the
elevator behind her.
Leen edged off
to the side before casting a glance
back over her shoulder.
She noted
two men, one with a neat, perhaps
affected mustache, a dashing earring
and a plumed hat, and a certain regal
air perhaps shading toward godliness;
she had seen him before, several hours
ago in fact, also in the company of the
Emperor-designate atop the reviewing
stand for the Running of the Squids,
before they had all been blown half to
hell and gone. For all his festive garb,
the fellow looked substantially the
worse for wear, especially considering
his limp and apparently immobilized

arm - but then the same could be said
for many of the others in this august
company, who had been unfortunate
enough to attend the Running in the
sparkling company of the Emperor-
designate and had now been unwise
enough to choose another public cer-
emony so soon afterwards with the
same group.
As she woolgathered, though, the
other newcomer was still in motion, a
dark specter in fulgent armor whose
lacquered ebony curves covered him
from greaves on up to his hardshell
cowl; even eyes were invisible behind
charcoal glass socket-pieces. The fact
that he was somewhat shorter than the
ﬁrst man did not immediately register,
such was the armor’s glowering aura,
although the person inside did wear it
to full effect, passing silently (but for a
small creaking of joints) up the stairs

with a feline glide, all promise of con-
tained energy and ferocious contempt.
Leen had never seen the armor. It
was barely possible, however, that this
was not the ﬁrst time she had wit-
nessed that glide.
“Emperor,” said the one with the
mustache, inclining his head and plac-
ing his hands on his hips as he came to
a halt, effectively drawing the four of
them - the Emperor-designate, the two
just arrived, and Leen herself as well -
into a tidy conversational group.
“So,” said the Emperor-designate.
“Phlinn Arol.
You have decided af-
ter all to grace us with your presence.
Yet that you ﬁnd it appropriate to
accompany yourself with such an ag-
gressively menacing ﬁgure makes one
question the message you mean to
project.”
The menacing ﬁgure executed a pre-

cise bow. Rather than bending toward
the man of the hour, as protocol, good
manners, and a prudent regard for
one’s own health and longevity would
dictate, the genuﬂection was unmis-
takably toward her.
“Honor to you,
my lady,” intoned a voice from beneath
the cowl; a voice not at all like that of
Maximillian, the Vaguely Disreputable.
“And to you, my Emperor.”
“Hmph,” sniffed the Emperor, ignor-
ing the ﬁgure as completely as if it
had been a black lacquered beetle, al-
though the bodyguard at his shoulders
was clearly on alert. On alert, but not
ready to pounce - the person might
be an affront, but it was an affront
mounted by the only dignitary present
who arguably outranked the Emperor-
designate himself. “Surely the Scapula
does not still concern you?”
“Surely,” said Phlinn Arol, “he does,

and more than ever. Have you not no-
ticed the vacancy of the gods’ gallery?
That his cunning has not reached its
culmination is assured.”
“Oh, come come, Phlinn, I already
have a mother.”
“I hope she’s not too attached to
this particular son,” Phlinn Arol said
darkly
“None of that,” the Emperor-designate
told him, raising a reproving ﬁnger but
clearly ﬁghting to keep an expression
of annoyance off his face and his smile
of beneﬁcent welcome tempered by the
weighty responsibilities of impending
ofﬁce in its place instead.
“We are
on showcase.
All auguries must be
favorable.”
“Have you proclaimed that to the
Scapula? You still have a perfect oppor-
tunity to postpone the Knitting until
we know how to deal with him. Declare

a public commemoration of that mess
at the Running of the Squids; host a
municipal banquet.”
The Emperor-designate lowered the
ﬁnger to point between Phlinn’s eyes.
“You are becoming more tiresome than
witty, Phlinn Arol.
When this cere-
mony is over I shall request from the
gods a new liaison.”
“You’re not going to have much to
choose from if you get rid of me, except
for the Scapula.
He’s laid low pretty
much everybody else.”
“That,” declared the Emperor-designa
“is patently impossible. Since you are
clearly descending into fantasies, our
audience is over. Please assume your
place at the designated station.” He
turned away, hesitated, then rounded
again on Phlinn Arol.
“Furthermore,
if you do not follow your role in this
ceremony to the letter you will ﬁnd

yourself discorporated faster than -”
“Very well,” Phlinn Arol snapped,
“you’ve made your point.
Why don’t
you go off and see to your... guests.”
The Emperor-designate glared at
him one last time. Then the Emperor
took a step back, wheeled, and stalked
off, motioning for another supplicant
to approach him.
Said the menacing ﬁgure in the
beetle-like armor: “How did that block-
head ever survive to become Emperor?”
This time his manner of speech did re-
mind one signiﬁcantly more of that of
Maximillian the Vaguely Disreputable.
“If we stick around for this, Phlinn,
we’re gonna be sitting ducks.”
“Quaint,” said Phlinn Arol, “but not
beyond the bounds of possibility. That
is what you are here to prevent. You
are the local expert.”
“The way to prevent it is not to be

here.”
“What the -” began Leen in her own
low hiss. “What is going on here? Is
that you in there, Max?”
“Of course it is,” said the dark ﬁgure,
becoming none the less dark for all of
that. “My good old patron thinks the
best way to deal with Shaa’s brother is
to present him an easy target, in the
hope he’ll be grateful and give every-
body a break.” He ﬁxed Phlinn Arol
with the front of his cowl, the polished
lacquer showing Phlinn’s reﬂection on
its surface. “Maybe he’ll only kill us all
instead of redeploying us in some new
game.”
“You are supposed to be developing a
plan to counter him,” Phlinn Arol said,
in the clipped voice of one whose pa-
tience is chaﬁng thin enough to snap
at any syllable. “That is what you are
good at, plans. Yes? Correct me if I am

wrong.”
“Yeah, I’m so good my last plan
played things just the way he wanted
them. It’s time for me to retire before I
cause more trouble.”
“I think there’s only one way you
retire from this one,” said Leen.
In
the midst of all of this, she felt light-
headed with relief.
The way for her
to play this, though, was clearly to fol-
low their lead. This was scarcely the
moment to explore the nature of any re-
lationship she might contemplate with
Maximillian. Providing motivation, on
the other hand, seemed thoroughly ap-
propriate. “You may have screwed up,
all right, but that means the Scapula
probably thinks he has you beaten. As
far as he’s concerned you’re still in
the dungeon, right?
At least you’re
out now, and in a position to do some-
thing about him, and if that’s still not

anything than at least I’m glad to see
you’re safe.” Well, okay, so she had
tossed in that tidbit at the end, there.
The lords of skullduggery could sue
her.
“I’m not safe,” Max glowered, “none
of us are, but - but thank you. I’m glad
you’re safe too. Only what are you do-
ing here? How did you get away from
Arznaak?”
“That can wait. And if nobody else
cares enough to lay out a plan, you
might as well hear mine. I had a meet-
ing with Shaa.”
Sooner or later, Zalzyn Shaa thought
to himself, he would have to ﬁnish all
this dancing around, dropping sugges-
tive hints and ﬂoating innuendoes, con-
vincing those around him - by the evi-
dence - fairly successfully that he did
know what he was doing, and was oper-

ating on the cryptic gyre of some mas-
ter plan, and actually decide on such a
plan. Truth be told, he was running on
instinct more than conscious device. In
the general order of things this was not
recommended, since the major element
separating the highly crafty from the
brute of force was the multiplier of cun-
ning. On the other hand, when deal-
ing with Arznaak instinct was not nec-
essarily such a bad idea.
His brother had been clearly show-
ing himself to be at the top of his
game, his preferred mode of operation
- and the one that had been carrying
him through his recent string of re-
markable success - being his ability to
anticipate the plans of his opponents,
and to forcibly mutate these plans for
use against them.
Knowing one’s ad-
versaries well enough to predict what
they would do in any given situation

was a tactic often given lip service but
rarely practiced to its fullest extent;
perhaps if he survived Shaa would
write a treatise. Or perhaps Arznaak
would.
Knowing Arznaak subscribed
to the family weakness for cheap the-
atrics he might as soon go for a ghost-
written popular romance instead.
But at the moment that was scarcely
the point. The question was what Arz-
naak would expect him to do, and what
he could do in its place that would be
both unexpected enough and at the
same time useful.
The way Arznaak
had been playing him, he would proba-
bly assume Shaa to be paralyzed by en-
nui or wracked by irresolution of spirit;
not far wrong, in fact, or at least not
until the Running of the Squids and its
aftermath. By now Arznaak must have
learned of his escape.
Would he con-
clude from that that Shaa had become

newly energized? Probably. Would he
postulate that Shaa would wait to put
his preparations in order before strik-
ing back?
For that matter, would he
think that Shaa had ﬁnally overcome
his hand-tied-behind-his-back scruples
and try to strike back in the ﬁrst place,
or would he ﬁgure Shaa as still one
to stay his blow and give action over
to others? Would he conclude he had
paralyzed their operations through in-
stigating the imprisonment of Max?
It was reasonably clear to Shaa that
whatever counter his brother expected,
Arznaak intended to nullify its effect
by forging ahead and continually rear-
ranging the board, causing any plans
in the making to be rendered obsolete
by the time they could be set into force.
The bottom line to all this was
the demonstrated futility of making
rigid plans at all for action against his

brother.
Letting loose as continual a
barrage of skyrockets as possible with
the goal of immediately sending the
reserves through any breech was the
ticket, trying to aim where Arznaak
would be rather than where he had
already showed himself.
And for the
moment, that came down as much as
anything else to instinct.
How absurd.
Well, it wasn’t entirely just the in-
tuition of guts or some brute dumb
hunch, at that. There were things that
were physically possible and things
that weren’t, and even if Arznaak was
now ferociously more powerful than
any single entity had the right to be,
transcendent or not, he still had to live
in the physical world.
Which meant
in turn that for him to pull off major
pyrotechnics at the Knitting he had to
be somewhere in the vicinity, not off

skulking in a hideout or reclining on a
chaise lounge back at home.
Of course, as Shaa stood there at
one of the sixty-ﬁve entrances to the
grandstands, gazing around him at the
assembled multitude - which appeared,
from his present vantage point, to en-
compass a signiﬁcant proportion of the
population of the civilized world - he
was considering the fact that he had
not fully grasped just how big these
Knittings really were.
Even so, that
shouldn’t make a major difference. Arz-
naak, the newly divine, would scarcely
hide himself in the bleachers with the
teeming hordes. It was almost as un-
likely for him to be found among the
elements of the Corpus milling like
ants on the parade ground.
There
were exclusive levels, true, and rows
of private boxes, and the possibility
of a subterranean lair buried beneath

the earthen buttress berm or beneath
the ﬁeld itself could scarcely be ruled
out. Considering the likelihood of ﬁre-
works, an aerial conveyance - whether
balloon, dirigible, tethered kite, or hy-
pertrophic bird - would end up midway
on the scale of probability. It was clear,
though, that without some added in-
tuition Shaa could scarcely run his
brother to ground before he did what-
ever he was going to do to reveal him-
self; some added intuition, or a sudden
cascade of luck, or -
“Here you are,” said a hissing voice
at his shoulder.
“Yes,” Shaa conﬁrmed, glancing over
with a quick eye-dart, “just as we ar-
ranged.” Under the circumstances it
would not do to point out that the
others were late; the snarled trafﬁc
alone could more than account for the
differential. “All three of you?”

“No,” said the cloaked Gashanatantra
with more than a trace of annoyance.
“Jill wanted her own mission,
and
Jardin insisted on revenge at ﬁrst-
hand. We’ll see if he doesn’t fall over
dead all on his own before that.”
The slumped ﬁgure of Jardin stirred.
“There is always enough energy for re-
venge,” came his grim whisper.
At least the two of them had appar-
ently come alone, without Jill’s legion
of warrior priests or errant tagging
acolytes. Even more importantly, they
had tuned down their god-auras, not
that Jardin had much of an aura left
of any sort after his treatment at the
hands of Arznaak. Except for ego, then,
and a certain undisguisable lethality,
there was nothing to stop them from
blending into the mob. The fact that
only
Gashanatantra’s
support
was
keeping the barely conscious Jardin

from slumping to the ground was
scarcely remarkable.
Plenty of those
thronging the stands had wounds or
disabilities or stigmata; that was why
they were here, hoping for the favor-
able benediction of the risen Emperor
incarnate.
Perhaps it had worked in
past years, and had been more than
legend; perhaps it would work tonight.
Or perhaps -
“As long as he chose to be here, then,
perhaps Jardin would be good enough
to get to work,” suggested Shaa.
“If
your
friend
Favored
has,
as
you say,
gone to ground,” Wroclaw
protested, “then what are we doing up
here?”
Ahead of him, Haddo was clinging -
rather grimly, in Wroclaw’s estimation
- to the neck of his other old friend, the
colossal vulture, which had returned
from its sojourn in the ancestral breed-

ing grounds signiﬁcantly invigorated
and - if its current frisky banks, dives,
and the barrel roll from which they
were only now pulling out were any
indication - ready for vigorous adven-
ture. “Rather walk would you?” Haddo
warbled.
“As a matter of fact, yes, I would.”
The naturally greenish pallor of Wro-
claw’s skin was serving him in good
stead at the moment, saving him the
trouble of turning the same color from
conscious volition. “I’ve never enjoyed
ﬂying,” he added, “as you know.”
“Perfectly safe it is,” hollered Haddo,
just as another dramatic maneuver
from the bird ﬂung his cloaked body
straight outward from its neck.
He
squawked frantically at the bird, hang-
ing on convulsively to a ﬂapping wattle,
the vulture cackled its own protest-
ing squawk back, and then a billow

of air washed over them as the crea-
ture luffed its wings and pulled up,
punching Haddo back down into his
perch.
“See you?” Haddo demanded,
just as the bird cast an evil glare back
along its outstretched neck, goggled its
bloodshot eye, yanked its wings in, and
headed beak-ﬁrst for the ground.
How had Shaa talked him into this?
Wroclaw wondered.
Perhaps it was
high time to take a fresh good look at
his policy of being the faithful loyal
retainer who always knew where the
salt shaker had gotten to and could
mix any drink without referring to
the book, not to mention the host of
other grubby tasks that had a talent
of coming his way.
Perhaps more of
a middle ground between scrubbing
out pots and clandestine missions of
hair-raising peril would be -
“To cast loose prepare you!” Haddo

screeched, looking straight down the
bird’s neck at the rapidly expanding
spiral of ground clutter ahead of them.
“So the bird has gone out of its mind,”
Wroclaw
remarked
conversationally,
not caring whether Haddo was listen-
ing or not.
There was not a seagull
in sight, either; they had left the re-
assembled ﬂock behind at some higher
altitude a few gut-wrenching maneu-
vers ago.
At least there were trees
below them, it looked like, and some
sort of body of water sparkling back at
them the night sky, but cartwheeling
there off to the side, lit from within by
its own torches and from the outside by
cunning banks of spotlights - was that
the triumphal pavilion used for the
Knitting kick-off ball several nights
ago? Surely the bird was not making
for the pavilion...
No.
Of course not.
The bird was

heading for the lake.
With a powerful shriek and a cloud
of released feathers, the vulture pulled
out of its dive and leveled off just as
its belly splatted into the water. Spray
sailed everywhere, a bow wake began
at the bird’s breastbone just beneath
Wroclaw’s dangling feet, and then just
as Wroclaw was collecting himself to
wonder how far the creature could hy-
droplane along, its wings spread wide,
without either clipping a wingtip or
running out of moat and skidding up
on the bank into the trees, it suddenly
folded its wings again, pointed its nose
down, and slid under the surface.
Water foamed over Wroclaw’s head -
how deep was this lake? But one way
or the other, this was where he got off.
He ﬂoundered at the buckle and the
seat belt came free, he came out of his
saddle - goodbye and good riddance,

bird! - and then he was thrashing for
the surface. Just as he broke into the
air, a fresh cataract cascaded over him;
out of the falling sheets of water, the
bird could be glimpsed again taking
wing, laying a storm front behind it as
it cleared the trees and vanished into
the night. Wroclaw turned on his back
and coughed ﬂuid out of his lungs.
Two red embers perched on a log
were paddling toward him.
“That
thing has a very nasty sense of hu-
mor,” Wroclaw told Haddo.
“Is there
some purpose in all this?”
“So
crowded
is
Peridol,”
gurgled
Haddo, he of the glowing eyes, “from
when place one to other fast get must,
air must use.”
“Are you trying to justify what we’ve
just gone through?” Shaa had been
questioning how far to trust Haddo; a
reasonable enough suspicion given the

way Haddo had been acting. Of course,
after this most recent display Wroclaw
was more than willing to see Shaa’s
wariness and raise him a few major
doubts of his own. “Next time just let
me know when you intend to get me
killed and we can handle it with much
less inconvenience all around - we’ll
pick a pleasant restaurant and you
can put poison in my wine, how about
that?”
“Finished you are?
Mission ours
is Favored to seek, yes?
Also knows
Favored bird.
Complex is bird.
Like
big vulture looks, but is part eagle,
part owl, part what know I not. Many
senses has it.”
“Part duck? Are you trying to tell me
that bird is a hunter? A tracker?”
“Think you live it could only carrion
on? Fah!”
“Very well,” said Wroclaw. “Fine. So

the bird can somehow detect the pres-
ence of Favored-of-the-Gods’ current
lair, you say.
If it has done so, then
where is this hideout?”
“Perhaps good enough would you be
search help me to,” Haddo muttered.
“Well, I don’t imagine it’s in this
pond.
Favored did not strike me as
the sort to enjoy splashing around in
the water.” Unless - “Can his ﬂoating
module travel submersibly?”
“Not surprised would be I,” said
Haddo, after a moment. “Shack of con-
struction used by Favored right here
around was.”
Wroclaw let another wave roll past
and raised his head. Dark water still
surrounded him, the ripples of their
traumatic entry still rolling to and
fro. The bank still looked to be a good
furlong off, but that was unlikely; in
the midst of Peridol this was more

a stream with ambition than a river
fallen into doubt.
On the other side
from the bank, the curtain wall of the
palace complex loomed tall above the
waters. Overhead, for the sake of com-
pleteness, was the unhelpful starry sky.
And below? How deep was this basin,
anyway?
But no, that was beside the point.
Even if there were some entry on the
bottom to a concealed grotto, lost in
the midst of the water grass and the
silt of river mud and unnoticeable even
if it weren’t already the pitch-dark of
night, how could they ﬁnd it? It was
unlikely Favored would have left some
convenient signpost saying “This Way
to the Secret Lair”; after all, he would
have already gone to some effort to
make the thing impossible to ﬁnd. “If
your friend Favored is indeed down
there,” Wroclaw said, treading water

again, “is there any particular reason
he would want to see you? Any token
he may have given you to attract his
attention in urgent times?”
“Cheap ﬁctions have been reading
you,” grumbled Haddo in return. Was
that actually a log he had found, or did
he have some sort of ﬂotation bladder
concealed beneath his enigmatic cloak?
“Ridiculous is this.
Adepts of sorcery
are we both - skills should we use.”
“‘Ridiculous’ - what a remarkable
conclusion,” said Wroclaw,
consider-
ing whether or not to use his vaunted
status as an adept to swamp Haddo
beneath a fresh surge of water.
Or
perhaps he could pierce the ﬂotation
bladder, or overturn the log.
“What-
ever your bird had spotted, it wouldn’t
have killed it to wait here and point it
out.”
“Skree!” said something above their

heads, followed by “squaw!” and a ﬂop-
per of wings - normal-sized wings, this
time - and then the white ghost-blur of
bird dropped in for a landing.
“Thought I not are nocturnal seag-
ulls,” said Haddo, his eye-sparks cran-
ing upward at the claws scooting for
purchase on his hood.
“Thought I not many things,” Wro-
claw said. “At the moment, might I pro-
pose we merely take this one as a given
and proceed from here? This body of
water is not warm.”
Haddo made growling sounds under
his breath as Wroclaw communed with
the seagull. “Over here,” Wroclaw con-
cluded after a moment.
“Told you that could have I,” snapped
Haddo; the bird had been gesturing so
vigorously in that direction with its
beak that its message had clearly leapt
species barriers.

“At least someone here had the fore-
sight to get the rest of the directions
from your bird,” said Wroclaw, doing
a
very
effective
breaststroke
with
his extra-jointed arms.
From the re-
newed shrieking of the gull he could
tell Haddo was following.
Then the
bird ﬂapped again, sailed overhead,
landed on the water just ahead of him,
and just in case he hadn’t quite gotten
the message, stuck its head under the
water for good measure.
Wroclaw gave a last stroke and ar-
rived at the gull’s location, watching
the creature eyeing him shrewdly and
wishing, no doubt, it had an eyebrow
it could raise over the eye in question
to give the proper counterpoint to its
expression.
“Just so,” said Wroclaw.
He took a deep breath and dove.
One fathom, two, three - how deep
was this thing? - and then ﬁnally the

ﬁrst slimy tendrils of bottom grass;
whatever the birds had spotted was
hopefully right around here, and if this
was all some practical joke they would
ﬁnd out just how ﬂappable he could
be himself under the right provocation.
He clawed his way down through the
grass to the bottom and felt through
the muck.
His eyes had been closed
- if it was dark on the surface, there
surely wouldn’t be any more illumi-
nation down here in the silt,
and
who knew what sorts of ophthalmic
diseases might be added to the un-
escapable scourge of dysentery from
this pleasant evening dip - but just to
be on the safe side he opened them
anyway for a quick peep. Guess what?
Wroclaw thought to himself. Just two
feet from his questing hand a coil of
pale blue phosphorescence made a
bulls-eye around the outlet of a wide

pipe rising an arm’s-span free of the
bottom sludge.
He surfaced. Haddo wisely made no
mention of his increasingly bedraggled
appearance, or the festooning strands
of weed and slime; these were in any
case inconsequential details. Instead,
Haddo cut to the meat: “Passage deep
how you said is this?”
“I did not say,” Wroclaw reminded
him.
“Either your friend Favored-of-
the-Gods intends for any swimming
intruders to asphyxiate before reach-
ing the outlet, or he doesn’t. There is
one principal way to ﬁnd out.”
“Urr,” said Haddo pithily. “Breathing
spells any know you?”
Wroclaw thought he recalled some
sort of apparatus for breathing assis-
tance Maximillian had used back in
Roosing Oolvaya.
He had no idea if
the appliance had arrived with them

in Peridol, though, and even if it had
been in the city it had probably per-
ished with the rest of their equipment
in the laboratory ﬁre. “Either we give
up,” said Wroclaw, “or oxygenate well
and forge ahead. Or I suppose there’s
no need for both of us to perish. One
of us can go ahead and drag a line or
some such.”
“Eh,” Haddo said. “Bother why? Be-
hind you am I. For it, go we must.”
“Are you sure he’s in there?” asked
Jurtan Mont.
“Yes,” rasped Dortonn. “How many
times do I need to repeat it?
He is
there.”
“Then are you sure we should go in?
You weren’t there, but the last time Pod
Dall tried to materialize back in Roos-
ing Oolvaya he devastated -”
“I have heard that story,” Dortonn
snarled, “more times than is at all justi-

ﬁed based on its undistinguished facts.
Ask someone about the year of the
Businiu Ice Age if you care to hear a
genuine tale of godlash. Still,” he went
on, more reﬂectively, “it might not be a
bad idea to announce our presence in
advance.”
“Do you think he already knows
we’re here?
I mean, after what hap-
pened to us on the way in -”
“Nothing happened to us on the way
in,” said Svin.
“Well, yes, I mean that’s my point.
This is the headquarters of a god,
right?
Wouldn’t you think he’d have
more defenses than just a hidden en-
trance and the lock on the summoner
for this - what did you call it, Dortonn?
- this elevator-thing, that you had to
pick apart?” Once into the passage-
way from the secret inlet in the marsh
they had remained alert for trouble,

but (rather to Svin’s disappointment,
Jurtan thought) such trouble had not
been forthcoming.
True, the tunnel
had been dark, but they had had a
lantern; the walls and ceiling where
the walkway passed beneath the moat
had been clammy, but Svin’s recovery
from his case of consumption was ap-
parently complete; Jurtan had three
times detected potential booby traps of
an unknown character, but they had
successfully skirted whatever might
or might not have been lying in wait
none the worse for the experience; and
even the elevator, the only exit from
the tunnel they had been able to ﬁnd,
which held the promise of plunging
them to a concealed pit, dousing them
with astringent gas, or holding them in
place for suffocation or apprehension
by guards who might after all have
only been on their dinner break, had

proved to be nothing but a convenient
mode of transportation to the upper
levels of the tower, in lieu of obvious
stairs. Svin had clearly been disgrun-
tled at not having to scale the outside
of the tower, pound demonic guardians,
wrestle some ferocious beast, or ease
a critical key from the very belt of its
custodians in their well-lit and well-
nigh impregnable chamber, but had
still found it in him to be philosophical
about this state of affairs.
Jurtan’s
own philosophizing had taken a differ-
ent tack. Even if he survived whatever
he was walking into here, there would
still be his father to contend with.
To get back to the here-and-now,
though, there was still the open matter
of what awaited them on the other side
of the closed-door exit to the vestibule
onto which the elevator had discharged
them. “An interesting point,” Dortonn

allowed, casting another glance at the
door.
“Perhaps I should attempt to
contact my master directly.”
“Wait a minute,” said Jurtan.
“I
thought you were in contact with him.
Isn’t that why we’re here?”
“Do not question my methods, boy,”
Dortonn barked. The effect fell short
of what he had obviously intended; due
to his debilitated condition the bark
emerged as more of a yip with aspira-
tions.
“Then I will question your methods,”
intoned Svin.
“I would also like to
know the answer.”
Watching Dortonn think over his re-
sponse, Jurtan (not for the ﬁrst time)
considered how highly evolved Svin’s
personal style was becoming. He might
have started as a barbarian, but he
now had real class.
Svin clearly un-
derstood the effect he could get from a

bald unembellished declaration. There
had not been the slightest of hint of
“call me boy, will you?” in his state-
ments just now, nor had he bothered to
so much as frown at Dortonn. No the-
atrical tricks, beyond making sure his
voice sounded sufﬁciently cavernous
and resonant to support a major into-
nation, no gratuitous swipes with his
sword, no “speak or your life is forfeit”
melodrama. Just -
“I do not have to speak with my mas-
ter to know the state of his health,”
Dortonn said reluctantly.
“Or his ap-
proximate location. This is a power he
awarded me when I became his acolyte.
I -”
“It didn’t work too well when he was
trapped in the ring, did it?” said Jur-
tan. “How do you know it’s any more
accurate now?”
Dortonn went back to glaring.
“It

did work. How would I have succeeded
in tracking the ring without it? And it
works still. Pod Dall is incarnate. He
is in this tower. He is -”
“He is looking forward to seeing us,”
Svin said, “I hope. Would you be good
enough to verify this?”
“He, ah,” said Dortonn, “he may not
be awake. If he is not awake, that may
be in, ah, a somewhat safer condition
overall than if he were awake, and this
is deﬁnitely better than waking him up.
Deﬁnitely. Ah, Pod Dall is normally a
reasonable fellow, for a god, given to
compromise and negotiation at no lit-
tle sacriﬁce to himself. However, as you
know he has been through quite a lot of
difﬁculty lately. In the best of times he
is not sanguine about those who have
done him harm. Knowing him of old, I
am certain he has a list, a list of, well,
ah - a list. While I would surely not

be found on this roster it would be im-
portant to make certain he remembers
this. I would not want my master to
have cause for regret.”
Svin scrutinized him calmly. “Plainly
you are the expert in these matters.
Please lead us to your master, then.
Now.”
“I, ah - yes. Boy - traps? Danger?”
Jurtan said, “I don’t hear any.”
As Dortonn reluctantly reached out
for the door, Jurtan noted Svin ﬂatten-
ing himself against the adjacent wall,
out of the door’s line of sight. Jurtan,
not wanting to challenge his example,
edged up to the wall on the other side.
Dortonn ran his palm over the surface
of the door, his eyes closed, and then
waggled his ﬁngers slightly. The door,
emitting a low hiss, slid to the right
and vanished into the wall.
Light spilled through the doorway

and washed across the dim vestibule,
light from glowing panels in the ceiling
and from powerful discs set into small
cylinders suspended at cunning angles
from the walls. The ﬂoor was set with
wide white tiles, the walls lined with
mysterious machines, except for one
section of wall that appeared to have
recently melted and was still giving
off both a glow of heat and possibly
toxic vapors.
A cofﬁn - that in fact
looked more like a transparent bath-
tub on stilts - was visible to the right.
Dortonn leaned through the doorway
and glanced around, then squared his
shoulders and shufﬂed boldly into the
sanctum.
Svin raised an eyebrow at
Jurtan, who shrugged, indicating no
change in the ambient music, so Svin
hefted his sword and crept through the
doorway himself.
Jurtan followed. Dortonn, obviously

ignoring the banks of strange equip-
ment on hand, had already made it
to the other side of the spacious room,
where a comfortable sitting area of di-
vans and easy chairs around a low ser-
pentine table had been set aside atop
a dais. A human ﬁgure was slumped
in one of the chairs, and another ﬁgure
had keeled over across it.
Dortonn,
looking as always as though he was
about to collapse himself, was gingerly
approaching the both of them. He took
a careful look, then equally carefully
prostrated himself.
“My master,” he
proclaimed.
“Which one?” said Svin, approaching
on his habitually silent feet.
“On the top.”
“You’re sure he’s not dead?”
“Of course not. You see - his chest
rises. True, he may not be pleased with
the body -”

“I wouldn’t be,” Svin said. The body
in question had apparently suffered
recent exposure to ﬁre, explosion, and
from the evidence partial dissection,
was streaked with blood and bile, and
had only one serviceable hand.
The
remains on the bottom, however, were
worse. “However, if it was me I would
be stuck with it,” he continued. “Can
your master pick and choose?”
“Of course. He is, after all, a Death,
and although this is a rude breach of
etiquette -” he indicated the shrunken-
head mummiﬁcation of the lower occu-
pant of the chair, and the positioning
of the upper occupant’s hand on the
lower’s waxy throat “- it is clearly an
emergency.
He is not inhabiting his
original body but one that was con-
veniently close to hand. I believe his
original body to be lost, but he is a god;
he can grow a new one. Tissue samples

will have been kept, and -”
“Look at this,” said Jurtan, coming
up the steps to the dais. He was carry-
ing gingerly, in a cloth, some small par-
cel, a parcel that had stained the white
cloth red. Carefully avoiding crimson
drips onto the carpet, he spread the
bundle out on the coffee table.
“A ﬁnger,” Svin noted.
“Partially
gnawed.”
“Yes,
but the ring,” said Jurtan.
“That’s the ring.”
“Powerless
now,”
proclaimed
Dor-
tonn. “I will keep it as a souvenir of -
what?”
“I don’t think so.” Jurtan had already
whisked the thing away, and was stow-
ing it in his pack. Maybe Max or Shaa
or Karlini would want it, and maybe
he could barter it to them in exchange
for support against his father; plus,
he didn’t trust Dortonn. Not that he

trusted Max or Karlini, or even Shaa,
completely and without question, but
that didn’t mean he couldn’t try to use
them as allies. Wasn’t that what they’d
all been trying to teach him, after all?
“Should he be moved?” asked Svin,
again indicating Dortonn’s master.
“Laying hands on a god is presump-
tuous,” Dortonn muttered, “but these
are special circumstances, and he does
appear to have ﬁnished with his feed-
ing. This other is barely now a husk.”
Jurtan was having his ﬁrst good look
at the person in question. Although he
had yet to glimpse the face, the whole
seemed strangely familiar.
Now, as
they respectfully lifted the incarnate
Pod Dall to transfer him to the ad-
joining sofa, Jurtan realized that his
impression had been founded in fact.
His music chimed in with a belated
conﬁrmation, recapitulating the theme

he had heard when the body’s origi-
nal owner had wooed his sister and
had eluded him in the trafﬁc and had
transported her into near-disaster at
the Karlini conﬂagration. “How much
is left from whoever this guy was be-
fore?” he said.
“Easy to ask,” said Dortonn, “difﬁ-
cult to answer.
If - ah.” He sank to
the ﬂoor in another obeisance.
Svin
and Jurtan joined him. The eyes of the
body on the couch had opened.
“Dortonn?” croaked his master.
“Yes, my lord?” he croaked back.
“Revenge.”
Dortonn sighed. “If that is your will,
my master -”
“Not against you, you idiot. Get me
a drink of water.”
Jurtan leapt up.
He had noted a
well-endowed bar on his way across
the room.
Would Pod Dall want ice?

He splashed water from the decanter
into a goblet and scooped up a load of
ice balls from the freezer into another.
When he scurried back Svin had lifted
Pod Dall so that his head was reclining
on the couch’s plush leather armrest.
With his own hand the god lifted two
ice balls and plopped them into the
water, then after a moment’s delibera-
tion added a third. “Ah,” he said with
satisfaction, after a long closed-eye sip.
“Much better. Thank you.”
Dortonn was wringing his hands.
“May I get you something else, my
master? Would you rest now?”
“There are things that must be
done,” Pod Dall said sternly, sounding
for the ﬁrst time as though he might
actually be a god. “I have had far too
much resting lately.
Although I was
not asleep in the ring, it was rather the
extreme of dissociative states, and in

any case my ability to inﬂuence events
was limited. I may have awakened...”
His voice trailed off. Jurtan thought it
was not as though he had just lost his
strength, but rather had reconsidered
the wisdom of continuing with that par-
ticular revelation. Jurtan had caught
just a hint of another musical motif
that rang familiar, down below the ma-
jestic chords accompanying the words
of the god, as mundane as the words
themselves might be. What motif was
that - or whose?
“As I say,” continued Pod Dall, “I may
have at last awakened fully, into this
trap of a body set for me by Arznaak
the schemer, but his snare has failed
to bring me down. It is instead time
for those who have hounded me to be
brought low.”
Dortonn took a deep breath.
“But
my master - if I make speak freely

- at the moment in this body you are
barely alive, and perhaps not even that
for very long. How do you expect -”
“I am not ready to retire. There is al-
ways enough energy for revenge,” Pod
Dall breathed grimly.
“This is a cen-
tral tenet of godhood. What did you ex-
pect?”
“I thought you were the Conciliator,”
Jurtan blurted out.
The gaze scrutinized him. “In some
circles, yes. In others, no; you are al-
ready aware I employed Dortonn. One
cannot conciliate without strength to
compel respect. Now,” he said, address-
ing them all, “tell me this.”
The Creeping Sword. That was it, Ju-
rtan thought, that was whose melody
he’d heard; the Creeping Sword. Had
Pod Dall awakened Iskendarian from
his hiding place within the Creeping
Sword?
Judging by the trouble that

had caused, it sure didn’t establish
Pod Dall as a player looking to keep
collateral damage to a minimum. And
now they were supposed to help him in
the next stage of his plan?
Suddenly Jurtan was wishing he
had gone with his father after all.
Someone
was
moaning
piteously.
Someone close by sounded absolutely
miserable. From the rank odor, some-
one had recently been sick to their
stomach.
Somebody was still sick to their
stomach.
Then I realized I was feeling the
combined sensations of nausea and
gill-greenishness far too personally for
these to be purely vicarious observa-
tions. My head was pounding; actually,
it felt like it had been pounded out
so much from the inside as to have
inﬂated it to the size of a watermelon,

which was only precariously attached
to the rest of my body. I didn’t want to
look in a mirror, ever. I was afraid that
I’d ﬁnd that my brain-roommate had
punched through my skull and out my
forehead in the process of evacuating
the premises.
Evacuating? Roommate?
Wait;
I’d left Iskendarian behind,
trapped in the Scapula’s web.
But I
was still here, even if at the moment
I didn’t feel like being much of any-
where.
How was that possible?
If
Iskendarian was the real owner of this
brain and body and I was only some
ruse thrown up by him as camouﬂage
how could he be evicted, leaving me in
sole possession?
And he was gone.
How I knew
I wasn’t sure - were my thoughts
clearer?
My head less cramped?
My
vocabulary different?
I didn’t think

so. I thought I felt the way I always
felt, except more physically wretched
at the moment, of course. But still, he
was gone. Maybe there was less chat-
ter in the background, maybe it was
like leaving the city and winding up on
some solitary hillside away from civi-
lization, the only sounds the cheep of
birds and rustle of leaves and gurgling
of brooks.
Whatever the metaphor,
though, Iskendarian was gone.
But how could Iskendarian be gone
when I still didn’t have an identity? I
hadn’t liked having his,in fact being
a wanton mass murderer whose only
principles were those that directly ben-
eﬁted himself was one of the lousiest
fates I’d been able to imagine... but in
a perverse way I had to admit it had
been better than nothing.
No - that was ridiculous.
I’d been
better off with no identity than with

that overheated maniac in the belfry.
If I wanted a new alter ego I could - I
could...
If my head didn’t stop throbbing
I’d never be able to follow a thought
through to its end. What had I been
thinking before I’d gotten lost in the
haze? Iskendarian, that crummy leech
- although if he’d been telling the truth
I was the one who’d been the leech.
Well, what of it? How did I know he’d
been telling the truth?
Suppose he’d
been lying, suppose he was just some
mind parasite and making me feel
like I didn’t belong was a weapon to
help him clear me out of my own body.
Or suppose he’d even been telling the
truth as he knew it, but it was still a lie
- why couldn’t he have been as deluded
as me about what was really going on?
Well, at least I didn’t have to worry
about good old Iskendarian any more;

hopefully Iskendarian was giving the
Scapula at least as much trouble as
he’d given me.
Although I still had
some responsibility for him, I guess. Af-
ter all, I had loosed him on the Scapula
and the web of other trapped gods, and
I did know at ﬁrst-hand just how much
of a rabid animal he really was - but
then on the other hand that kind of
ferocious demolitions expert was just
exactly the sort of fellow the Scapula
needed tearing at his throat. It wasn’t
like Iskendarian could break out and
threaten the general populace.
Unless...
What if Iskendarian won? What if
he succeeded in subjugating Arznaak’s
personality the way he’d done to mine?
Arznaak was out of his mind, of course,
and so was Iskendarian, but at least
Arznaak preferred to scheme where
Iskendarian chose to blast.
It would

be nice if they could just conveniently
destroy each other, which was exactly
why it was hopelessly unlikely that
would ever come to pass. No, Iskendar-
ian in charge of Arznaak’s mind and
wielding his overload of power wasn’t
merely a threat to the general public,
he was - well, yeah.
I was still responsible.
Pain or no
pain, I had to get myself up off the ﬂoor,
pull myself together, and ﬁnd out what
was happening. I had to get to a work-
station. The one in the Archives was
probably closest, but who knew what
shape it was in - plus there were all
those pesky defenses to get past on the
way.
Had there been an access node
in the facility under the moat? What
about the -
Wait a minute.
Iskendarian was
gone but I still had memories I didn’t
recognize. Not the same ones I’d had

ﬁltered through him - this was the ﬁrst
time I’d thought of some underwater
hideout, for example - but that wasn’t
all, either. Things I’d never understood
before were suddenly starting to make
sense. I knew things - but some of the
things I’d known when I’d been Isk-
endarian I now knew had been wrong.
He hadn’t been thinking straight; he’d
warped logic so subtly I’d never noticed
it. . .
and for that matter I had the
sudden suspicion he hadn’t known it
either. Iskendarian had been a walk-
ing thought disorder, that’s why he was
so messed up. But then I guess that
was just the way he’d been built.
Built?
No, that wasn’t just a metaphor. Isk-
endarian had been built.
I knew be-
cause I’d built him.
And that’s when I realized I knew at
last who I really was.

Chapter19
“JUST WHY DID THE EMPEROR
want all of us here?” Leen whispered
to Phlinn Arol. “I mean, I understand
the exercise-of-power-for-its-own-sake
stuff, and the unbridled urge to throw
your weight around, and the putting-
on-the-best-face-and-united-happy-
front for the crowds, and even the idea
of getting people who might be plotting
against you together so you can watch
them all at once, but when it gets right

down to it all he seems to be doing is
acting like a total idiot.”
“Unfortunately, you may have no-
ticed I agree with you,” said Phlinn
Arol.
The two of them were planted
in their seats adjoining the Emperor-
designate’s triumphal dais. Glowering
at them from behind, even though he
had stated his clear preference for a
chair as well, was the black-shelled
Maximillian.
It was not merely for
effect that he had been denied a stool;
also gathered at their backs and sta-
tioned in a winding trail down the
stairwell were the escorting guards of
Leen’s recent acquaintance.
On the ﬁeld beneath them, from
what they could glimpse past the grand
rostrum and the other ceremonial ap-
paratus emplaced round about on the
tower, the preliminary excursions and
evolutions had reached their climax,

the animal acts, historical evocations
of feats of gladiatorial prowess, and
comic relief had similarly run their
course, and the massed bands were
thundering forth their evocation of
the majesty to come.
The Imperial
functionaries were forming up in their
ranks of state - the ramifying Nerves
had already stretched their tendrils
from the digital corners of the ﬁeld into
the twisting central spine and then the
dense tangled mat of brain, and the
Bones and Vessels were doing their
intricate maneuvers to form up around
them; the Vertebrae had just ﬁnished
twirling into place around the spinal
column Nerves, and here came the
ribs and long bones sliding in from the
sides and bubbling out from the pelvis.
All was in order and the signs were
unmistakable.
The Knitting-together
of the Corpus of Empire would soon

be upon them.
And also upon them
at that time, most likely, would be the
crash of whatever hammer the Scapula
had recently been forging. “Of course,
it would be thoroughly anticlimactic if
the Scapula plans to lie low,” Leen ven-
tured. “After all this we’re all geared
up for, and all. Maybe the Emperor’s
right and nothing is going to happen.”
“The only good apocalypse is the one
you avoid,” muttered Max. “I’d be per-
fectly happy to be disappointed, but I
don’t expect it for a minute.”
“Perhaps Dr.
Shaa and his new
friends will succeed in running your
old friend to ground,” Phlinn Arol sug-
gested.
“Or in detecting and tracing
the umbilical power cord linking him
to those he holds in thrall, through the
intermediary of this hypothetical ally.”
“It’s possible,” said Max.
“It could
happen, but there again I’d be sur-

prised. Arznaak’s worked on this for a
long time; he’s not going to let himself
get tripped up on some minor detail.
Shaa and your friends may ﬁnd him,
but I’d bet it won’t until he makes him-
self traceable by letting off an energy
signature that makes him visible - and
if he’s done that it’ll already be too
late.”
“That’s what I like about you,” Leen
said. “You’re such an eternal optimist.”
“I am being optimistic.
I think we
may have a chance of getting through
this alive. Look on the bright side. If
the Emperor sics his assassin guys on
us at least we should be able to handle
them.”
“I’m glad to see you’ve regained your
conﬁdence,” Phlinn Arol said.
“Yeah, well, it’s nice if somebody still
thinks I’m good for something around
here, even if that somebody has to be

me.
All right, damn it, I’ll admit it
again if that’ll make you feel better; I
made a mistake.”
“You’re
being
uncharacteristically
modest, don’t you think?”
“Absolutely, yeah, of course, com-
pletely, I’m the ﬁrst one ever to make a
big mistake on something really impor-
tant. Are you happier now?”
“Without bound,” Leen said unhap-
pily.
“It does make you think, though,”
commented Max.
“Why does it seem
more and more like everybody in the
world is incompetent?”
“Everybody but you, right?”
“Especially me.”
“The Adventurer’s God,” Phlinn Arol
said, staring into space. “What was I
thinking? Why couldn’t I have picked
something like God of Actuaries, say, or
Lord of Ferns and Moss? No, I had to

sign up for Lore and Romance, damn it
all. And here’s where it all might end.”
“Have
another
drink,”
suggested
Leen.
It’s being reactive I hate, thought
Max.
Going deliberately over to de-
fense, placing yourself square-up agains
the bulls-eye because that gave you the
best angle on the bowman, these had
never been his tactics of choice. People
were supposed to dance to his tunes.
But Phlinn Arol had been refusing all
the most reasonable ideas he’d come
up with; after all, if Phlinn wanted he
could single-handedly scotch the Knit-
ting in its tracks by refusing to play
his ceremonial part. True, that would
create its own new set of problems, but
that was pretty much a given for any
course they took.
Phlinn wasn’t lily-livered, not really;
what he was at the moment was even

worse - fatalistic. Their earlier discus-
sion on the way over, between Max’s
comments on which part of his body
the obnoxious armor was chaﬁng now,
had illuminated their best guess at the
most likely medium the Scapula’s inter-
vention would take. Since it involved
a direct strike through Phlinn himself,
you couldn’t very well accuse Phlinn of
personal cowardice; foolhardiness, on
the other hand, was present as a mat-
ter of deﬁnition. And to rely on Max’s
ability to think up a counter on the ﬂy
and deploy it in what might be a win-
dow of milliseconds ...
Well, Phlinn’s
fatalism might be understandable, but
that still didn’t make it healthy. “How
much do you know about the basic
mechanics of the Knitting?” Max had
asked him.
“Probably more than most,” Phlinn
had said dryly, back before his mood

had headed for bottom and hadn’t come
back up.
“You’re there as the liaison god,
right?
How much of what you have
to do is ceremonial and how much is a
physical transfer of power?”
“It’s basically just a sound-and-light
show, you should know that. Just sym-
bolism.”
“But do you establish an actual con-
duit of some sort between you and the
Emperor?”
“... I see what you’re getting at, of
course,” Phlinn had said, his dispo-
sition tilting now over the edge and
starting its nose-dive into the abyss.
“You think whatever the Scapula is
going to try involves inﬁltrating the
link, however limited and tight-band.
I would say that’s impossible...”
“Except the Scapula has been doing
a lot of the impossible today, and that

might not even be too far technique-
wise from what he’s already demon-
strated.”
“You’d better start thinking what
you can do to offset it, then.” And that
had been the last thing Phlinn had said
that was of any practical relevance to
anything at hand.
Max checked around himself again,
they glanced over the side at the drop.
“I just hope they didn’t plant explosives
in this spire too,” he murmured. Then
it occurred to him for the ﬁrst time
just what the tower reminded him of:
a single-branch candelabrum, with a
swelled cup at the top for the ﬂame of
the torch. It was big enough to light a
ﬂare that could be seen for leagues.
“I just thought of something unpleas-
ant,” Max said.
But Leen and Phlinn Arol had given
up paying much attention to him;

Phlinn was all but crying on her shoul-
der. True, Max had resigned himself
to his own conclusion that she was
eminently lovable, not that he had had
the opportunity to seriously pursue the
thought, and true, Phlinn Arol’s job did
not usually bring him into contact with
Leen’s sort of person, since adventur-
ers - male or female, and of whatever
species - tended to be a much more
rough-and-tumble lot, rather than sig-
niﬁcantly bookish.
True, these were
predisposing factors - but still, how
had Leen gotten him to discuss a sub-
ject Max had been trying to pry out of
him for years?
“You see,” said Phlinn Arol, “every-
one knew of Byron but not many knew
him face to face, personally that is, and
of those who were intimate with him
I believe I’m the only one left. That’s
why his personality is so familiar to me,

so familiar in fact that I believe I would
know him again if I saw him, whatever
his disguise of the moment happened
to be.”
“Yes, yes, that’s all very good, but the
point is, have you seen him again?”
“Yes,” said Phlinn Arol, “I believe
I have.
That’s why I was hoping he
might be timely enough to show up
here now.”
Shaa dragged himself up to Gashanat
feeling more than a little askew at the
moment. His outﬁt might not need to
be cast into the rags entirely, but it was
going to require some serious attention
from a cleaner.
He had just ﬁnished
his walk-through of the mob of viscera
on the parade grounds. The idea that
the Scapula might be hiding in plain
sight - among the other Bones, for ex-
ample - had been too Shaa-ish not to
deserve a personal check-out. So there

he had been, forcing and wedging his
way through the tightly packed ranks
of giblets of various sorts, all pursuing
their in-group and intra-society jabs
and shenanigans as they wheeled and
gyrated in their formal exercises.
It
had taken every bit of slipperiness at
his disposal to penetrate the throng at
all, let alone accomplish his mission;
but somewhat to his own surprise, he
had succeeded in making a fairly thor-
ough anatomical sweep, not only of the
skeletal members but other attendant
systems as well. In none of them, of
course, had his brother been found.
Well, it had had to be tried. On to
the next step. Which was –
“Wait a moment,” said Gashanatantra
raising his free hand slightly. “A mes-
sage from Jill.”
Shaa wondered if he should turn
and ﬂee back to the body parts. These

were gods - you couldn’t very well order
them around - but he thought by now
they understood how dangerous it was
to use any of their accustomed accou-
terments of their goddish infrastruc-
ture. They knew the Scapula had cor-
rupted the conferencing architecture;
it was only prudent to assume normal
communications were no longer safe
either, even if they weren’t yet demon-
strably lethal. And there was already
enough bait around to spare.
But if
Gashanatantra wanted to talk to his
inamorata at the risk of his life, well,
the die was cast.
Maybe there would be a bright side.
Maybe she had found a valuable clue or
a hot trail to trace by physically exam-
ining one of Arznaak’s enthralled god-
captives. Maybe it was worth the risk
of telling an eavesdropping Arznaak ex-
actly what they were up to and how far

they’d come. Maybe -
Gashanatantra gave off whispering
to himself and glared back at Shaa.
“You don’t know everything,” he de-
clared.
“Your brother is not the only
one with surprises.” He removed some-
thing that looked like a black button
from his ear, displayed the item, then
replaced it.
“Ah yes, radio,” Shaa said.
“I once
had one of those myself.
Has it oc-
curred to you that perhaps my brother’s
confederate is an Artiﬁcer? An Artiﬁ-
cer might very well have his own radio
too.”
“Hence the utility of a private ver-
bal code. There is value to having once
been married to someone.”
Shaa sighed.
“I apologize.
I know
you know your business.
This whole
thing has clearly been getting under
my skin to a greater degree than I’m

accustomed.”
“Understandable; the adversary is
your brother.”
“Most gracious of you. If -”
“Will you just tell me what the hell
she said?” croaked Jardin.
If Max had been here, Shaa expected
he would have said something like,
“Oh, are you still alive?” But indeed
it was difﬁcult to look at the drooping
energy-drained ﬁgure Gashanatantra
had propped for the moment against
the retaining wall at the base of the
stands and recall it as being any more
ambulatory than a dressmaker’s man-
nequin.
Except for the smoldering
glare of the eyes, which had been closed
but were now again open, at least far
enough to be charitably described as
lolling slits. And for all his desperate
ferocity in the task, Jardin had so far
been unable to detect the slightest in-

timation of the new Curse Master in
the vicinity. Of course, Gashanatantra
hadn’t done any better, and for all the
good Shaa had done himself, he might
as well have been their maitre-d’. So –
what had Jill-tang discovered?
“Jill succeeded in locating two other
divines not snared by the Scapula’s
web who were willing to join her in
a raid on his headquarters.
She and
her soldier-priests and certain forces
of these other two have just completed
their assault.”
“The midtown estate where I was
held captive earlier?” Shaa asked.
“Yes,” said Gashanatantra.
“The
property was not demolished in the
ﬁghting, they are still searching for se-
cret passages and rooms, but aside
from
the
human
legions
from
his
time preceding his Exaltation none
of your brother’s forces were found. No

Transcendent equipment, no pertinent
records, no -”
“No lurking confederate? Nothing of
use, then - not that we expected any-
thing more.”
“Just so,” Gashanatantra conﬁrmed.
“But it has been clear for some time
that his whole strategy is hinged on
never looking back.”
“Maybe we can still trip him from
the rear,” Shaa murmured.
“As you
say, going nose-to-nose is scarcely a
plan for survival where my brother is
concerned. Or for victory, of course.”
“I’d tear his throat out with my teeth
from any side you choose,” croaked
Jardin. “I’m feeling much stronger al-
ready; I don’t mind trying a frontal
attack.”
“Hopefully suicide will not be neces-
sary,” said Gashanatantra. He looked
off down the ﬁeld, past the assembling

ranks of the Corpus, the pageantry of
their processions now all but complete,
to the spire of the Emperor’s tower at
the other end.
Shaa followed his gaze. “You’re not
considering heading down there and
joining Phlinn Ami, are you?”
“Certainly not.
You did hear me
say just now suicide should not be
necessary? Phlinn Arol is likely to be
the center of seriously difﬁcult events
quite soon now. The stroke of midnight
approaches; all is in its appropriate
order. Yes, I think we will know very
shortly just exactly what your brother
has in mind.”
“I’m not too sure anymore this is
such a good idea,” said Eden Shaa.
“Why, what would make you say
that?” The voice of the Crawﬁsh came
to her from somewhere in front, to the
right, and apparently overhead, and

also - if the unreliable testimony of her
ears could be credited - from several
miles off down an echoing canyon. Her
eyes had nothing to contribute on the
subject, since all illumination - both
the lanterns they had brought with
them and the inherent ambient light-
ing of this place - had suddenly and
completely vanished into the palpable
black of an ink bath just a moment
before. Before the lights had gone out,
Lemon had been within arm’s reach;
now - well, all she could say for sure
was that he wasn’t.
“I thought you said you knew how to
do this!”
“Well, sure,” he shouted back.
“At
least in theory. But it has been awhile
since I’ve been through here on my
own.”
Oh, great. For this she’d left her es-
tate? If -

“I think I’ve got it,” Lemon hollered.
“Take two steps forward, then one to
your right, good, now you’re going to
want to jump ahead high enough so
you’d miss, say, a three-foot obstacle,
and come down upside-down on your
hands. Got it?”
“No problem.” At least she hadn’t
gone the puffball route trapped on
the plantation; as a warm-up routine
this stuff wouldn’t even raise a sweat.
Eden sprang forward, ﬂipped, reached
for the landing -
- and then she was back in the
light as though she’d pierced through
a blackout curtain,
but somewhere
along the way gravity appeared to have
ﬂipped too (although it was undoubt-
edly just another one of the Archives’
harebrained tricks of perception) and
instead of coming down on her out-
stretched hands with her feet in the

air the situation was quite exactly the
opposite. Floating off below them sus-
pended from a glowing pink doorframe
in empty space was, well, a door.
“See?” said the Crawﬁsh. “Nothing
to it. I told you the place would recog-
nize me.”
“Plus you do have your sister’s ring.”
“Probably doesn’t hurt. Still, a bit of
fun, rather.”
“If it’s all the same to you, I think
we’ll come out through the dungeon.”
How had she ever let her brother talk
her into this?
Lemon sighed.
“All these years I
thought you were a genuine Shaa, but
clearly I was mistaken. Where is that
reckless
abandon,
that
stylistically
baroque ﬂaunting of facts, that -”
“Any more of that,” she warned, “and
I’m leaving you down here entombed in
the rock.”

“Dad,” said Tildamire Mont, “if you
don’t stop that I’ll drop you in a well.”
“But this is all a waste of my time!”
bellowed the former Lion of the Oolvaan
Plain.
“I didn’t come halfway across
the continent on the back of a smelly,
bad-tempered bird to -”
“What did you come here for, any-
way?” said the Great Karlini, unwisely
inserting himself again into the line of
ﬁre. “Only to make all our lives miser-
able, or was there some deeper consid-
eration than that?”
“Aarrh!” the Lion said, at maximum
volume.
Another window cracked in
the building behind them and went tin-
kling into the street. He went back to
carving off strips from a length of wood
he had found sitting around holding up
the lintel-piece of a townhouse they’d
passed along the way.
There wasn’t much else to do, frankly.

Here they were, once again on the
burned-out site of their former lodging
and workplace, watching while abso-
lutely nothing calamitous happened
whatever.
Cobblestones lay scattered
about, the sole reminder of the extraor-
dinary manifestations of the afternoon.
Since nothing was obviously mutat-
ing, though, or shooting off sparks or
threatening to run amok, Karlini had
persisted in his brooding and the Lion
in his frustrated exuberance. The few
passersby who had entered the block
with the apparent aim of strolling
down it to eye the devastation had
changed their minds on witnessing
the Lion’s casual twirling of his sword
and his eager scrutiny on spying them.
Tildamire couldn’t blame them. Her fa-
ther’s
examination
made
Tildamire
think of a herder looking over his
cows with an eye toward imminent

dinner. But in any case there had been
no pedestrians - whether genuine or
abortive - in some time; word appeared
to be getting around.
“Faugh!” declared the Lion, spring-
ing to his feet.
“Enough of this sit-
ting in place!” He turned his back and
stalked off down the block.
“Be as well to let him go,” said Kar-
lini. “I sure don’t want to jump on him
and try to tie him down.”
“Can’t you zap him and put him to
sleep or something?”
“You want to deal with him if it
didn’t work? Anyway, you need a brain
of a certain size to hit with a soporiﬁc
and I’m not sure he qualiﬁes.
No of-
fense, I hope.”
“He’s been my father for a long time,”
said Tildamire.
“We can go bail him
out later.” She joined Karlini in gazing
back across the street at the skeletal

beams of their building, and the wisps
of steam and smoke still rising as the
rubble continued to cool. “I, ah, I, ah...”
“Yes?”
“I was wondering why we never
found a trace of, ah, of Roni’s body. I
mean, I was there, and I didn’t actually
see her consumed or blown to bits or
anything like that. Couldn’t she have
been thrown back by that ﬁreball blast
and knocked clear out of the building
through the back wall? Or something.”
“Then where is she?
If she was in
shape to walk away by herself then
why is she hiding?
And she wasn’t
then who carried her off?
And why
can’t I hear her at all?” Karlini’s head
drooped lower, into the hands that
were there to receive it.
“I’d like to
believe something like that happened,
but there’s no evidence.”
“Maybe Shaa’s brother has her.”

“We never saw a sign he was inter-
ested in what we were up to here.”
“Maybe - maybe the Creeping Sword
part was ﬁghting the Iskendarian part
like he said, and made Iskendarian
think he’d wiped her out when he re-
ally hadn’t, and then he came back
later and... I mean, the way he told his
story to Shaa, it didn’t sound exactly
like what I saw.”
“All right,” said Karlini, “all right.”
He levered himself to his feet. “Let’s go
back in there and have another look.”
“Would you like to kill your friend Fa-
vored?” Wroclaw inquired, “or should
I?”
Wroclaw and Haddo were stretched
out on a narrow landing, between one
tunnel and the next, their feet barely
out of the water. The pipe whose outlet
they had discovered in the moat had

angled sideways in a smooth curve to
lead clearly under the palace walls and
a lung-crushing distance beyond.
A
minute or so into his frantic sprint, it
had been clear to Wroclaw that if there
were no air-ﬁlled outlet somewhere
quite near he was about to die; he had
passed the distance he could possible
retrace and still escape asphyxiation.
But they had been in luck; perhaps
the reservoir of air in Favored’s ﬂying
vehicle was limited itself, or perhaps
their own lung capacity was greater
than average. In any case, the passage
had tilted back up, and they had bro-
ken through the lapping surface into
an antechamber hung about with light-
globes turned so low their glow was
almost purple. More of them stretched
away down another tunnel, this one
horizontal and ﬁlled only with humid
air.

Urgent mission or not, there was no
way to proceed without a pause for re-
cuperation.
“Think you knows Favored here are
we?” wheezed Haddo.
“Why are you asking me? He’s your
friend. You’re the expert.”
“His own ideas always has he had.”
Water still squelching from his cloak,
he levered himself back to tottering
feet. “On should now we go.”
They trudged down the passage.
There was more than enough clear-
ance for Favored’s vehicle but no sign
of the ﬂoating ball itself. The tunnel
was not long, however, and after a
few snaky bends and a rope-and-belay
across a wide pit they were brought up
short by a massive sealed door studded
with rivets perched darkly across the
entire bore of the passageway.
Haddo stood back and put his hands

on his hips, his eye spots shooting
sparks of red at the barricade. “Know
I in there are you! Door open or wrath
feel!”
A moment passed in silence. Then
a tinny voice echoed from the gloom
of the ceiling in front of the door. “Go
away, Haddo, I’m busy.”
“Fah!” spat Haddo. “Away go I not!
Business of you precisely the problem
is! Warn will I not again!” He shrugged
back his sleeve and extended toward
the door a thoroughly reptilian claw.
“Haddo,” said Favored’s voice, “this
ain’t no game. I’ve got poison gas that
can burn you down where you stand.
Now get out of here - you’ll thank me
when I’m ﬁnished anyway.”
“Traitor are you!” Haddo snarled, on
the verge of total incoherency. “Scapula
help are you, but world rule he would!
All of he destroy he will! Worse than

that are you - us kill now with gas
promise you!”
An ampliﬁed sigh rattled from the
ceiling grate. “All right, you can wait
in the isolation chamber. But no fast
stuff, I’m warning you, Haddo. I’m not
gonna let anything distract me.”
The tall hatch clanked and creaked,
then broke its seal against the wall
with a hiss of escaping air.
A breeze
rufﬂed their clothes.
Beyond was a
smooth chamber, featureless but for
three smaller exit doors and Favored’s
Flotarobolis,
resting on its landing
skids in the middle of the cramped ﬂoor.
Haddo scuttled beneath the exhaust
vanes as Wroclaw edged in around
the now-quiescent side gear-train link-
ages.
The door swung ponderously
shut again behind them.
Wroclaw gazed at the three closed
exit doors.
“A particular old proverb

comes to mind,” he remarked.
Favored’s voice came one more time
from a new grate atop the entrance
hatch.
“Get your hands away from
that, Haddo - you mess with the atti-
tude jets and your cloak is a dishrag.”
“Edge on, you are,” Haddo noted.
“Situation reviewing are you?”
A wheel set in the center of the door
on the left spun and then the door
made its own hiss and creaked open.
Haddo led the way through another
tunnel into a small chamber contain-
ing several chairs facing a wide win-
dow that seemed not only very solid
but very thick.
Visible through the
window was a different room, some-
what larger, lit with a stark white light
by glowing strips in the ceiling and
strange displays on the hulking boxes
that lined the walls.
One panel on
the mechanism across the room from

them showed exceptionally realistic
light-pictures, in over-stimulated col-
ors, of various scenes they had recently
witnessed: the entry hall with its four
doors and the parked Flotarobolis, the
outside tunnel where it approached
the hatch, the pool into which they had
emerged following their underwater
journey; and other locales that were
similarly impossible to immediately
place.
At right angles to their vantage
point, though, was an apparatus that
appeared to be the feature of central
importance.
Another wide picture-
screen cast its radiance over a work-
desk, set into which was an array of
ﬁngertip-sized keys bearing on their
tops unfamiliar runes. Seated at these
controls in a swiveling chair cranked
up to its full height extension - and still
as a result barely having his head clear

the level of the desk - was Favored-
of-the-Gods. Piled around him on the
ﬂoor were boxes and sacks and bundles
he had apparently carted in on his own,
since they were choked with perishable
provisions - potatoes and broccoli and
cabbage, carrots and stoppered ﬂasks
of dark liquids and a wrapped side of
smoked ﬁsh, sourdough bread and a
churn of butter and a good two dozen
sweet rolls.
Perched precariously at
the side of the desk was a half-eaten
ear of corn on a dish and a mug of what
might be orange juice.
“Would you say your friend is prepar-
ing for a siege?” Wroclaw said to Haddo.
Behind Favored’s chair was a cot, too.
It appeared to be part of the origi-
nal furnishings, though, since it was
fastened securely to the ﬂoor by a ro-
tating tilt-mechanism, and as much
of the sleeping-surface as was visible

around the pillow and bedroll spread
out on top was metal, too. Suspended
above the cot by a wire from the ceiling
was a glossy white helmet; Wroclaw
didn’t even want to guess what that
might be for. For that matter, it was
difﬁcult for him to decipher most any
of these bizarre apparatus.
That was not, apparently enough,
Favored’s problem, however. It would
be difﬁcult to learn from his exam-
ple, too, since the message-board he
was observing most closely was almost
edge-on to their observation gallery.
In a panel above the primary screen
was another matrix of views of scenery,
and Wroclaw was pretty sure the vis-
tas that were showing pertained inti-
mately to the environs of the Stadium
of State, where the Knitting ceremony
by now was surely reaching its climax.
At least part of Shaa’s surmise was

presumably thus conﬁrmed. Unless Fa-
vored was working at some cunningly
unlikely cross purpose, the Scapula did
have a confederate, and Favored was
it.
On the other hand, the more specu-
lative part of Shaa’s hypothesis - the
one that had prompted him to slip
into Wroclaw’s ear an additional mes-
sage of watchful wariness - had to be
downgraded in probability, unless the
game had the additional convolutions
required to put him off the pace. From
the way Haddo was sputtering and
growling at Favored through the win-
dow now, and the bright ﬂashes his
eye-sparks kept reﬂecting off the ob-
viously shielded glass, it seemed all
the more unlikely that Haddo was in
league with Favored too. Wroclaw had
been disinclined to view Haddo as a
thoroughgoing traitor, even with his

increasingly craggy behavior of the re-
cent days, so having that theory meet
the dust was all to the good with him.
Of course, that didn’t help at all in
dealing with Favored.
“We don’t know each other all that
well,” Wroclaw said to him, “but I’ll ad-
mit I was taken with your good sense
and judgment, as well as your plainly
brilliant artistic abilities.
Unfortu-
nately, though, I see I was mistaken.
For you to trust Arznaak Shaa enough
to cast your lot with him -”
“You think I trust him?” said Fa-
vored, not removing his attention from
his board. “What the hell kind of idiot
you think I’ve turned into? I’ve got him
where I want him.”
Wroclaw settled himself into one of
the chairs; this promised to be a long
haul. “You’re not the ﬁrst one to think
that about Arznaak.
And he doesn’t

trust you either, that goes without say-
ing. So what mechanisms do you have
in place to assure that neither of you
stabs the other in the back? Just how
far you think common interest is going
to take you?”
“Far enough,” Favored said deﬁni-
tively. “You’ve gotta risk cracking eggs
if you’re gonna have an omelet, am I
right?”
“Crack
you,
would
I,”
muttered
Haddo.
Wroclaw waved him down with a
calming motion. “So you do have some
strategy in mind for parting company
with the Scapula?”
“Who do you think I am?” Favored
said slyly. “You think I’m the kind of
guy doesn’t have a backup drop-dead
plan? Anyway, if the Scapula did man-
age to turn the tables on me, I could al-
ways go running to Max and you guys.”

Wroclaw heard Haddo mumbling in his
ongoing undertone, “If alive still you
are,” while Favored went on with “I’ve
got plenty to barter with.”
“Such as?” said Wroclaw.
“Well,” Favored drawled, “I just may
know a method for pulling the plug on
the gods feeding Arznaak his power.
How about that, huh?”
“If I knew how to do that,” Wroclaw
said severely, “I would have done it im-
mediately. This situation is too danger-
ous to play games with.”
“That may be good enough for you,
but we all know you’re a low-impact
player, the supporting character type,
right?
That loyal subservient crap’s
not for me. And hey, Arznaak’s doing
exactly what we agreed, so far anyway.
He’s wiping the slate clean of every
other god in sight, and -”
“And then he intends to abdicate, I

suppose? And neither of you cares who
gets devastated in the process?”
Favored grinned. “Arznaak cares, all
right. He likes to hurt people. And if
a few humans get plowed under along
the way, who’s gonna miss them, huh?
Even this Emperor guy - especially the
Emperor.”
“You want to destroy the structure of
society?”
“You got it, buster. That’s the only
chance for our folks to break out of
the ghettos and straighten the deck.
It’s about time we were on top for a
change.”
“Of your mind out you are,” Haddo
muttered accusingly.
Favored was being obnoxiously cheer-
ful; something must be going right for
him. “That may be, but whether I am
or not there’s not a damn thing you
can do about it. I can pump gas into

the room where you are now, too, you
know.”
“A pleasant offer,” Wroclaw told him.
“Not terribly consistent with your plan
to come begging to us if you get into
trouble, and hopefully not indicative of
the quality of your thought in general,
but -”
“Now that’s interesting,” said Fa-
vored, examining something off to his
left.
“A lot of those caged gods are
trying stuff, but there’s one of them in
there working to destabilize the ma-
trix who may actually be able to do it;
seems like he really has some idea of
what’s going on at the subcode level.
Let me check the identity tracer. Huh.”
He grimaced at the panel and ﬁddled
with something at its base. “There we
are, recalibrated I think.
You know
somebody called Iskendarian?” he said,
still glowering and tweaking simulta-

neously.
“About what talking is Favored?”
Haddo hissed at Wroclaw.
“He
is
seemingly
the
keeper
of
the Scapula’s trapped gods,” Wroclaw
guessed.
“The vampire’s apprentice,
one might say.”
“Duh,” said Favored. “Wait a minute
here... Well, can you believe that.”
“What?” said Haddo.
“This Iskendarian thing is disincar-
nate; it’s got no body. It’s just sitting
out there subverting the network.
It
even looks like - yeah, it’s already cross-
infected the Scapula’s lower-level func-
tions. I wonder if he realizes it? His
command effectuation is still within
nominal but -”
“Excuse me,” said Wroclaw.
“What
are you babbling about? Are you say-
ing that Iskendarian has somehow
abandoned his body?”

“You do know this Iskendarian? He
really did have a body?”
“To our misfortune and that of our
associates, yes.
Iskendarian was re-
sponsible for the destruction of the
laboratory - you recall? You were there
for a moment trying to put out the
ﬁre? - before you left to plot against us
all again. Iskendarian is also answer-
able for the murder of Madame Karlini.
And do I understand you correctly, that
this disembodied Iskendarian is now
trying to take over the Scapula?”
“Could be, yeah, sort of looks like it.”
Favored began gnawing on a ﬁnger.
“All part of your plan, I’m sure,”
Wroclaw said. “Of course, that’s all the
world needs, Iskendarian in control of
the Scapula’s power. It’s difﬁcult to say
which one of them would be worse. Or
maybe they could join forces; we’d all
like that, wouldn’t we.
It’s clear you

would.
Weren’t you just arguing in
favor of maximizing anarchy?”
Favored stared at his wildly gyrat-
ing instruments.
“So if Iskendarian
started out with a body,
I wonder
where the hell it is now?”
“I’m afraid I can help you with that
one,” said a new voice.
“How the hell did you get in here?”
demanded Favored, craning back over
his neck with his hands still on his
boards. One of the banks of equipment
at the side rear of his control room
had eased silently away from the wall,
revealing behind it a camouﬂaged door,
and within it a familiar ﬁgure. “Don’t
move - you take one step and you’re
toast.”
“Iskendarian?” Haddo croaked.
“Not anymore,” said the man, “which
I suppose is one thing to be happy for.
I -”

“Favored,” said Wroclaw, seeing that
one’s teeth clench as he reached his
decision and sent his hands reaching
for a new conﬁguration of controls, “I
wouldn’t -”
Whereupon the newcomer - whether
Iskendarian, Creeping Sword, name-
less one, or something else entirely -
spoke a single incomprehensible but
immaculately uttered word; another
sourceless voice that was plainly dif-
ferent but still strangely similar to
his own answered; the lights on the
boards around Favored’s controlling
perch chattered and swam; and though
Favored pounded incredulously on the
keys in front of him absolutely nothing
resulted; surely not the sentence of
destruction he had obviously expected.
Favored abruptly gave off his efforts,
directed a ﬁnal stare at his machines,
and then spun on his swiveling chair.

“How the hell did you do that?” he spat.
“Well, you see,” said the man, “this
stuff used to be mine.
I’m sure you
don’t think it all got here on its own.”
“Don’t make me laugh,” said Fa-
vored, not looking as though any out-
burst of the sort was close to hand.
“This place’s been sitting here forever -
if you built it where have you been all
these years? How are you still alive?”
“I’ll grant you I have been indis-
posed, but -”
“You know who you are now, sir,
don’t you,” Wroclaw interrupted. There
was no chance he and Haddo could es-
cape their current cell, much less make
it to the tunnel or whatever other en-
trance the man had used.
Although
the man wasn’t dry, he looked more
as though a bucket of water had been
poured over his head and clothes in
an effort to accomplish a quick bath,

rather than appearing soaked and be-
mossed as swimming the moat and the
length of the underwater shaft would
have left him. Judging from the story
of the destruction of the Karlini labora-
tory, there was similarly little chance
of warding off an attack if that was
what he had in mind. No, if this man
had it in for them they might as well
ﬁnd it out now, and if not -
“Yeah,” the man sighed,
“I’d say
that’s pretty obvious, wouldn’t you?
Now let’s see just what kind of mess
you’ve all gotten up to in here.”

Chapter20
“IT IS A PICTURESQUE SIGHT,”
said Max, “I’ll give them that.” The
maneuvers on the ﬁeld were complete.
Stretched out along the turf with ﬂying
banners and darting wizard-lights, the
details of its anatomy outlined by ﬂoat-
ing strips of cold-ﬁre and accentuated
by the contrasting colors of clothing
and patterns of heraldry in the ranks
of Nerves and Muscles and Bones and
other assorted viscera and glands, was

the grand ﬁgure of a human, its feet
almost at the base of the Emperor’s
tower, its head at the far end of the
ﬁeld, its left hand now raising itself
to its brow in salute.
The Emperor-
designate, mere moments away from
losing his hyphenate status, had risen
from his seat and ascended to the com-
manding top-roost, his arms raised,
garbed now in his robe of white with
ﬂame edgings.
Then the Emperor-designate was
looking back over his shoulder, and
down at them. “Phlinn?” he mouthed.
Phlinn Arol sighed and climbed to
his feet.
“Even if there wasn’t the
Scapula, I’d still hate this,” he mut-
tered. “My lines are so overwritten.”
Max was still standing, too, and as
Phlinn’s head drew level with his own,
Max reminded him, in a low whisper,
“If worse comes to worse, just jump.”

Phlinn said “Urr,” walked around
to the front of the Emperor’s dais, and
planted his hands on his hips. A golden
disk materialized above his head, then
descended over his body, leaving him
radiant and glowing.
“Should we bow?” said Leen.
“Might get you out of the line of ﬁre,
I suppose,” said Max. “Just -”
But now Phlinn Arol had begun to
preach. Through some feat of legerde-
main, his voice was echoing around the
stadium, louder even than the ongoing
roar of the crowd, yet the sound level
of his pronouncement was still not en-
tirely deafening here close to hand. “I
AM PHLINN AROL!” he proclaimed.
“I SPEAK HERE FOR THE GODS!
BY
THE
SACRED
COMPACT
OF
THE AGES, WE HONOR YOUR NEW
MASTER! HERE IS THE SYMBOL
OF OUR GLORY AND OUR FAVOR

VESTED NOW IN THE HANDS OF
YOUR EMPEROR!” Then he turned
and pointed up behind him at the
Emperor-designate.
The golden radi-
ance came off his outstretched ﬁnger
in a stream and showered over the
Emperor, leaving him shimmering as
well.
The Emperor raised his arms in a
wide “V”, basking in the adulation of
the crowd.
“Any idea what kind of
goodies he’s got in mind to give out to
the audience?” Max said to the half-
kneeling Leen.
Cementing the good-
will of the hometown constituency with
large-scale Knitting gifts was another
custom of the ages.
Some poor coun-
try of indentured indigenes in some
remote part of the continent would
pay for it, to be sure, but of course the
Empire was scarcely a believer in full
citizenship, much less suffrage.
Too,

there were always the Living Mines to
help equalize the balance sheets.
“I just hope it’s not books,” she told
him.
The Emperor was now into his own
peroration, a nimbus of lightning bolts
crackling around him amid a stench of
ozone that was causing coughing ﬁts to
break out in several spots around the
platform.
Phlinn Arol, in undoubted
violation of some protocol, was edging
back from the brink, his burnished
aura dulling as he did so to make his
retreat less obvious. He caught Max’s
eye with a quick glance over his shoul-
der, and shrugged; Max jiggled the
pauldron of his plate mail in response.
But indeed, Arznaak had apparently
let the moment pass.
That moment,
anyway.
Now the Emperor was getting around
to his own big payoff, the part where

he’d demonstrate he was really the
chosen of the gods and the elect of
the Empire by performing the tradi-
tional prodigy.
He lowered his arms,
the electricity crackling out along his
skin and balling around his hands,
lowered them until he was encompass-
ing the vast body of the Corpus of the
Empire laid out on the parade ground
ﬂoor, laid out so that if you squinted
at it just right you’d stop seeing thou-
sands of heads in matching costumes
and start to perceive instead the pros-
trate ﬁgure of a perfectly proportioned
colossus...
a colossus that was now
unmistakably starting to glow.
And then even if you stopped squint-
ing, you still might see the same reclin-
ing giant, its eyes closed, its chest ris-
ing and falling a good twenty feet as it
inhaled and expired. And then no one
in the stadium was squinting - or do-

ing anything but putting their full at-
tention on the Corpus - for the person-
mountain’s eyes had now opened.
Twin light beams the equal of any
lighthouse’s beacon stabbed up into the
sky, then swiveled down to ﬁx in their
glare the Emperor’s stand as the ap-
parition raised its head. The Emperor
stared down the ﬁeld at the hugely
magniﬁed reﬂection of his own visage
and proclaimed, “I GIVE YOU THE
LIVING EMPIRE!” and with a rum-
bling THUDD! that shook the stadium,
raised a cloud of dust that obscured
the ﬁeld, and set the reviewing tower
to swaying disconcertingly, the giant
planted a hand behind itself for lever-
age and sat up at the waist.
“I thought this was supposed to be
an apparition,” said Shaa, his voice
totally inaudible beneath the echoes

crashing around the arena and the
avalanche-style collapse of a section
of interior retaining wall not far from
his and the two gods’ current position.
He considered and quickly dismissed
the idea of trying to get himself off the
track and back to his feet; the ground
was still rolling up and down, and
from as much as could be seen through
the rising dust cloud the manifest ﬁg-
ure of the Imperial corpus had not
yet achieved its own standing posture.
Once up and ambulatory, of course,
who knew what the Emperor had in
mind for it.
The Corpus moved again and Shaa
ﬂew into the air, ﬂipped end-over-end
like a fried egg on the receiving end
of an expert skillet-wielding chef play-
ing to an audience, and came down
ﬂat on his back as the earth slammed
up again to meet him.
A shower of

pebbles and small rocks cascaded over
him from above.
Was the adjacent
section of seats seriously considering
collapse?
He could barely even see
Gashanatantra, sprawled in similarly
piscine fashion next to him, much less
the bleachers, but if this latest seismic
shock was the Corpus getting one foot
beneath it, it was clear what would
follow - another foot, and then ambu-
lation.
If there was any doubt about
the structure now, these coming events
would replace that with dead certainty.
Of course, attempting to ﬂee in the
direction away from the potentially
collapsing stands would lead one to
the center of the parade ﬁeld, which
was not unoccupied itself, but then
the Corpus would likely not be par-
ticularly concerned about eradicating
every gnat rushing about beneath its
feet.

He managed to grab Gashanatantra
by the shoulder - a familiarity he hoped
the god would not hold against him,
under the circumstances - hollered,
“Away from the wall!”, and then, with-
out waiting to see whether he was
being followed, set off in a rubber-
legged lope over the bounding ﬁeld.
Shaa ﬁgured he would only be able to
proceed a short distance before run-
ning into the ﬁrst of the massed le-
gions of human corpus-constituents,
no doubt disarranged from their cere-
monial order... but actually, of course,
that represented a larger and scarcely
hypothetical question on its own.
The dust in the air obscured clear
vision all the more so when trying to
view the scene at ground level, but
Shaa had the impression that at the
very least the Bones of the Empire had
been thrown to the dirt themselves. If

the thing now considering its footing,
its head even in its half-kneeling po-
sition at a level with the higher tiers,
actually had mass, though, Shaa had a
pretty good idea just where that mass
had been drawn from. Mass, after all,
could be neither created nor destroyed,
although a clever practitioner could
slip some from place to place behind
his back, so to speak, but this amount
of mass was something for which no
mere prestidigitation could fully ac-
count.
If the Corpus did have mass,
the most prodigious transfer-rate ever
recorded would be insufﬁcient to add
up by several orders of magnitude. No,
if the Corpus had mass it had come
from the bodies of its constituents.
And if that were the case... well, the
Emperor-now-no-longer-designate, for
all of his misguided vexations, had
shown no signs of wanting to grind his

staff and adherents into corn mash.
Which lead one inexorably to the suspi-
cion that if the Corpus did have mass...
...then the Emperor might not be the
one in control.
“Are you seeing what I’m seeing?”
shouted Leen.
What
she
was
referring
to
was
scarcely in doubt.
The looming face
of the Corpus beyond the glare of
its searchlight eye-beams had experi-
enced a transformation that was more
than a matter of a fresh expression.
The features were clearly not those of
the Emperor. They were those of the
Scapula.
The tower was whipsawing back-
and-forth violently enough for its sur-
vival to be in imminent doubt. Most all
of its occupants were sprawled on the
ﬂoor hanging on with breakneck grips
to anything solid, and trying to stay

out of the way of the cascading chairs
and the wreckage of the buffet tables.
Only the Emperor, at the highest point
of the spire, had managed to retain
his feet, and that by dint of a lean-rod
behind him to which he was clutching
with both hands.
Max could see the sweat pouring
from the Emperor’s face.
Even Max,
in his black plate armor, was start-
ing to feel like a boiled lobster, and if
those light rays the Corpus was giving
off were intense enough to do that to
him, a good twenty feet off their focus
point, the Emperor had to be pretty
much melting. Serves him right, Max
thought.
A toppled chair moved aside just
ahead of Max and Leen, and Phlinn
Arol, having entirely shed his aura of
golden radiance, crawled through the
opening.
“I’ve shut down and discon-

nected whatever I can,” he said.
“I
believe I am free of contamination.”
“Arznaak’s after bigger ﬁsh,” Max
stated, “but then we always knew that.
Now -”
The ﬂoor rebounded again.
The
tower leaned far over to the right. They
heard a crash, a hubbub of extensive
breakage, and then a chorus of human
wails, declining in volume as though
the makers of these sounds were disap-
pearing down a shaft. The angle of the
incoming light beams steepened. The
Corpus was on its feet.
Max took the risk of looking up. Its
shoulders topped the level of the high-
est stadium tiers, waving banners and
all.
Its feet had sunk into the thick
earth of the parade ground deeply
enough so that the midpoints of its
ankles were even with the grass.
It
was wearing a toga-like garment that

looped over one shoulder and left the
other bare, and a ﬁery diadem around
its brow. Its hands had been planted
on its hips; now, they were being raised
into the air, where they would no doubt
disrupt migration patterns for birds.
“HEAR, O MY SUBJECTS!” said the
colossus.
“What the hell kind of jury-rig cock-
eyed disaster did you put together
here?” I demanded.
“Now just a damn minute,” began
Favored-of-the-Gods,
about
to
spin
himself out into another aggrieved
tirade, “where do you come off sneak-
ing in from the street, claiming to be
resurrected or some kind of idiot story
no one with half a brain would -”
“Favored,” said Haddo, also for not
nearly the ﬁrst time, “up shut!”
“Fine!” yelled Favored, “ﬁne! Be that
way! Here I am working for the good of

the world and -”
“Put a lid on it,” I told him, “or
I’ll have to blast you or something.”
Of course, blasting folks was the last
thing I wanted to start doing again.
I’d had quite enough of that with Isk-
endarian, thank you. Now that I was
Byron again, more or less, I thought it
was past time to try ﬁxing things for a
change.
Which wasn’t to say I was back to
normal - as if anybody could say at this
point what might be “normal” where
I was concerned.
It did seem that
I’d freed myself of the self-inﬂicted
though inadvertent wound that was
Iskendarian, and I now knew who I’d
been before that, and some things that
had happened in the recent past now
made a lot more sense, but that didn’t
mean all my memories had come back
in an overwhelming ﬂood or that I was

even the same person I’d been when I’d
been Byron before.
I didn’t have the
same body as the original Byron, that
was for certain, or to be more precise
I probably did have the same body - I
hadn’t been regrown from a cell sample
or had my brain transplanted or some-
thing drastic like that - but a crew
of nanoremodelers or nanosurgeons
or whatever they were calling them
these days had been loose sometime in
my Iskendarian-past. Most likely this
had happened when the personality
virus had gone after me; that would
have made the most sense.
I didn’t
remember enough details to remember
if I’d included a shape-change module
in with the virus - as I said, my mem-
ory was still coming back in spots and
chunks - but it would have made sense.
I was pretty sure that was the way my
mind operated.

I’d been working on this personal-
ity virus idea, like I’d said, as one of
several projects aimed in the long run
at getting the world out of the situa-
tion I’d played a key role in getting it
into.
My clean-room technique must
have gone sour on me, though, or per-
haps I’d been the victim of sabotage -
I hadn’t exactly been a ﬁgure of great
veneration by that time - but the bot-
tom line was that my test system had
gotten a jump and infected me.
I hadn’t been left with no recourse,
however. I’d been building in certain
safeguards - that much was only stan-
dard good practice - and if they hadn’t
been enough to totally eradicate the
pest that was Iskendarian and restore
me to full knowledge and function,
they had still managed eventually to
tone him down and put him to sleep.
The battle hadn’t been one-sided, how-

ever. Iskendarian had left me with a
violent antipathy for magic, designed
I suppose to keep me away from tech-
niques that might have healed things
up once and for all. He had also man-
aged somehow to redeploy some of his
own code in the form of the Spell of
Namelessness. So there I’d been, ﬁrst
comatose for who knew how long, be-
ing kept in ﬁghting shape by the tight-
leash nanodocs that were godhood’s
greatest perk, then awake enough to
wander the world but not quite at the
level of consciousness to realize I had
no memory of a past and no identity
but the stream of day-to-day. I didn’t
know where I’d be if I hadn’t ﬁnally
crossed paths with Gashanatantra.
Of course, Gash hadn’t merely started
to wake up me, Byron, but me, Isk-
endarian, too.
There was a lot going
on inside us that Iskendarian couldn’t

explain. In the manner of disoriented
personalities everywhere, he’d started
ﬁlling in back-details to try to make
things make sense.
That story he’d
told me about deliberately imposing
the Spell of Namelessness on himself
to lie low until the fruition of some
unspeciﬁed mysterious plan, for exam-
ple, was cockeyed on its face. Since I
now knew Iskendarian had been much
more unstable in this instantiation
than he’d been the ﬁrst time around,
I might have been able to reduce him
to gibbering insensibility merely by
forcing him face to face with mutually
inconsistent facts... but I hadn’t known
that then, and in any case it hadn’t
been necessary. Byron-instincts ﬁlter-
ing up through the Iskendarian-haze
might have tipped me to that tactic, as
they had apparently guided me to so
much else, but now the problem was

the Scapula’s.
And whose problem was the Scapula?
Well, it was everybody’s, of course,
but I was the one on the spot with the
possibility of doing something about
him, if I could ﬁgure out just what Fa-
vored had pulled together here with his
cross-rigging and counter-forcing and
spaghetti-weaving.
I’d already shut
down the in-room intruder defenses on
the system, true, so Favored couldn’t
be another one to stab me in the back
with my own knife, but I didn’t dare
pull the plug on the Scapula until I
had some idea which plug it was, and
what else might be side-linked and
deadfall booby-trapped to the same
components. The more I tried to trace
his work the more convoluted it be-
came, and me still running more on
instinct than with a ﬁrm grounding
in fact. I did have the advantage that

I knew I had once known everything
about this place. I also knew that an
ideal of any sort of engineering was
that ﬁnal crystalline clarity to any el-
egant design. When you had the key,
everything laid itself out logically and
rationally, in clear order.
Unfortunately, I now knew as well
that Favored-of-the-Gods was a tin-
kerer of the ﬁrst rank. Here he’d been
building on the accretion of the ages
to boot, and on elements he didn’t
fully understand in the ﬁrst place. He
hadn’t been looking for elegance, he’d
been after something that worked. “I
ain’t telling you a thing,” he was spout-
ing now, as he watched me goggle at
the monitoring readouts and try to put
myself in his head.
Then his glance
- which I was watching myself out of
the corner of my eye - slid off me and
roved up to one of the live-video feed

matrices on the panel above our heads.
I looked in that direction myself, and
saw Favored wince as he realized he’d
called my attention to something he’d
rather have left hidden.
So what was it?
The images were
coming from the Stadium of State
where the Knitting was in progress,
that was obvious enough, but then
who was that monstrous and appar-
ently solid ﬁgure planted in the middle
of the parade ground with his hands
raised? The one with -
- with the Scapula’s face.
I grabbed Favored by the collar,
lifted him off the ﬂoor,
and shook
him.
Fortunately my own injuries
were healing themselves more rapidly
than was humanly possible; not sur-
prising, actually, but it was nice to
know my nanodocs were still on the
job.
They hadn’t been able to ﬁx the

residual nausea and more than a touch
of hangover from shedding Iskendar-
ian, but I was happy to have the better
part of my stamina and the use of all
limbs back.
I didn’t bother to let Fa-
vored’s teeth stop clattering against
each other, though, before leaning into
his face and shouting, “This has gone
far enough!
I want him shut down
now! Either you do it, or I’m going to
take down everything I can reach my-
self and damn the consequences! You
hear me?”
But he was gazing past my shoulder
at another panel, which he’d remapped
to show what I’d ﬁgured to be the vital
status indicators of the Scapula’s cap-
tive gods, and the spreading Iskendar-
ian virus within them.
“Hey, will you look at that!” Favored
said. “He’s draining them down to the
dregs - he’s really going for it! There’s

gotta be gods dropping dead from ter-
minal exhaustion all over town.”
“Yeah?” I said.
“Why?
What’s he
need all that power for, that he’s gonna
let it loose all in one binge? He -” He
wouldn’t do that, would he?
But it
was a Knitting, and it was time for
the traditional Emperor’s Gift, and the
manifestation of the Corpus was in the
hands of the Scapula rather than the
Emperor whether or not the people
realized it, and -
“Uh-oh,” said Favored.
“I didn’t
think he’d do that.”
“Of that sound like do I not,” I heard
Haddo mumbling from beyond the
glass. No question, I agreed with him.
“What?” I demanded.
“He’s cast loose,” Favored said. “He
dropped out of the web.”
“Does that mean -”
Favored looked at me, chewing his

lip. “Even if I wanted to, yeah, I don’t
know what I could do any more to shut
him down.”
“Look at that mob,” said Jurtan
Mont.
“How we ever going to get in
there?”
“Leave that to me,” Pod Dall said.
Did you bring a pry-bar?
Jurtan
thought. And it was scarcely clear ei-
ther just what Pod Dall’s goal would
be if they did gain access to the over-
stuffed Stadium of State and its on-
going Knitting.
What his goal would
be - or whom.
Pod Dall had listened
to their recounting of current events
and the active danger posed by the
running-amok Scapula, but had been
noncommittal. He had wanted to know
about Gashanatantra. It was not clear
whether their lack of information on
that score had helped them or merely
placed them on the list of expendables

with no particular reason to live.
Pod Dall had seemed to have some-
thing of a soft spot for Dortonn, though,
even if it hadn’t been soft enough to
help him out when he’d ﬁnally keeled
over in a dead faint as they’d prepared
to leave Vladimir’s lair.
“He is a more hardy ﬁghter than I
had expected,” Svin had said, eyeing
Dortonn’s body where it had slumped
down the stairs from the carpeted dais.
“I expected him to fall down hours ago.”
Pod Dall had made them carry Dor-
tonn back up to the longest couch and
lay him out there, anyway, and indeed
he had still been breathing, although
he had not appeared to be any longer
for this world than at the outset of
the escapade. But Pod Dall’s revenge
would clearly not be stayed, so off they
had gone.
“Who’s that?” Jurtan said now, his

music sense giving him such a sym-
phonic blare of imminent warning that
he could barely hear the outside world.
It had been mounting as they’d ap-
proached the Stadium, but he’d had
the feeling that any danger up ahead
would pale against the hazard rep-
resented by Pod Dall himself if his
immediate wishes were thwarted.
If
this guy was the peacemaker of the
gods, Jurtan already knew he’d sure
hate to meet whoever planned their
ﬁghts.
But perhaps he was about to en-
counter that entity anyway, whatever
his feelings in the matter. Svin and Pod
Dall followed Jurtan’s pointing ﬁnger,
up, up, over the rim of the stadium,
where the head and shoulders and
upraised arms of a ferociously huge
human ﬁgure were clearly visible, lit
from below by torches and spotlights.

Pod Dall’s eyes widened and he be-
gan muttering to himself under his
breath, mutterings that included more
than one discernible reference to the
Scapula. It occurred to Jurtan to won-
der how much of the mind of the orig-
inal occupant of Pod Dall’s current
body was still hanging around; at the
moment he was hearing more than a
trace of the music that had accompa-
nied the guy before, on their several
meetings. What dealings had the man
had with the Scapula, himself?
All told, it was looking like a pretty
good time to get out of the vicinity, a
time that might not last long, either.
Between the giant haranguing the
crowd and the nearer half of the city,
Pod Dall with his steely-eyed glare,
and Svin,
who was simultaneously
examining the colossus with a profes-
sional air, as though looking for critical

points of vulnerability, and ﬁngering
the edge on his sword, Jurtan was
deﬁnitely in the company of a crew
of maniacs whose lunacy was clearly
about to boil over. Then Pod Dall had
him by the arm and was marching him
resolutely forward.
“You,” said Pod
Dall, “will listen, then play.”
The manifestation of his brother had
taken a few steps in the direction of
the Emperor’s tower in the course of
its speech, Shaa noted, picking his way
through the broken-ﬁeld rubble left in
its wake.
That was probably just as
well; Shaa wasn’t sure at all he actu-
ally wanted to catch up with the thing,
or what he would do if he did. Gnaw on
its toe? In any case, the Corpus had to
be a decoy; it would be quite surprising
if Arznaak was actually inside. Parade
around in public where he could be a
target no one could miss? Not Arznaak,

not bloody likely.
But he still had to be close enough
to be controlling the thing.
To keep
leakage and the chance of intercep-
tion to a minimum he was probably
on a tight-link communications setup,
which argued in turn (on the grounds
of greatest security, if nothing else) for
line-of-sight. Now, of course, the thing
had a line of sight to most of the city,
but before, when it had been aggregat-
ing itself out of the assembled Imperial
functionaries, that line would have ter-
minated strictly within the stadium
walls.
Shaa stopped and squinted around
himself again.
The dust was still
swirling, still rising. With the amount
of energy the hypothesized tight-beam
would have to be carrying, and the
amount of dust it would now be having
to push itself through, was it too much

to ask for a trail of scintillation?
Here
came
Gashanatantra
now,
coughing and rubbing his eyes and
splashed to the knees and up to his
shoulder with churned mud, fresh from
not-quite-skirting a loam-caked hollow
where the Corpus had planted its hand
on its way to its feet. “Any ideas?” Shaa
said to him.
“With this prodigious a waste of
power normal rules may not apply,”
Gashanatantra yelled back. “What are
you looking for up there in the sky?”
Shaa quickly explained. Gashanatant
craned his neck back and joined him in
the scan.
Someone new humped their way
up the muddy slope, looking in their
caked-on and oozing demeanor more
large earthworm than humanoid; Jardin
“He is using my power,” Jardin gasped.
“He is readying a curse-based spell.”

“Where?” demanded Gashanatantra.
“Where the head was.”
Shaa took off.
“He’s cut off my links to the stuff
buried under the stadium ﬁeld, too,”
said Favored. “All the capacitors, the
power reservoirs, the precursor vats -”
“To you cross-double is he about,”
spat Haddo.
“There’s no way he could -” Favored
began, wheeling on Haddo.
“Iskendarian,” I said. “How much of
the Iskendarian virus had inﬁltrated
the Scapula before he dropped off the
net?”
“I’m not sure what I was looking
for,” Favored said reluctantly. “Some, I
guess.”
“Do you know how to do a display
rollback?” I said. “Here, look, like this
- now what was your access sequence
for that screen? Okay.” The old status

screen on the Scapula’s thrall-network
came back, I ﬁne-tuned the sieve, and -
there were signature traces of the Isk-
endarian infection wherever I looked.
There - in the Scapula, too. And here
I’d never even thought about network-
wide contagion - I must have been do-
ing something right when I’d designed
that virus-thing. But how long did the
Scapula have left before he realized he
had to ﬁght Iskendarian? Or for that
matter, how long before Iskendarian
was in control?
Now, I knew I must have put some
kind of safeguards in the Iskendarian
code. Hmm - I wondered if the Scapula
had found out anything about the priv-
ileged subcarrier channel. How much
did Favored know? - that might give
me a clue.
“Where did you stick the
communications module?” I asked him.
I let him pick an option from one

of his coded dialog screens and the
second quantum level trunk status dis-
play popped up.
Activity across the
net was lower than I’d ever seen it -
not surprisingly, considering that most
of the high-volume transmitters had
melted down and any remaining oth-
ers were wisely lying low.
And the
subcarrier burst bands, that the mag-
ical nanoeffectors used to talk to each
other themselves?
“The hell is that?” hollered Favored,
as the new splashy readouts stabilized.
“Is that magic we’re looking at?”
“Part of it,” I told him.
‘“Magic’
doesn’t just happen, you know, some-
thing’s got to do the work. Molecular-
scale machines - any advanced-enough
technology is indistinguishable from
magic,
I’m sure you’ve heard that,
haven’t you?
And there’s got to be
a way for the systems to communi-

cate, right?
How else could you han-
dle things like clairvoyance, or even
this workstation being able to monitor
what’s happening clear across the city?
We’re not talking about witchcraft with
this stuff, just cold engineering.
Al-
though I’ll be damned if I know how
they pull some of these new tricks.”
Favored was now sort of shrinking
back against the wall as he watched me
work. “You really did build this stuff,
didn’t you?
I mean - somebody built
it, right?, that’s what you’re saying? I
mean, there’s technology from the past,
sure, but - when you dig down to the
roots magic’s magic, it just is ... isn’t
it?”
“I would have thought you, of any-
one, would be above those old super-
stitions,” I said. “Of course I didn’t do
everything myself; there’s a tremen-
dous amount of work embedded in this

stuff.
But most of it before me was
basic science that got put together into
building blocks. I came in when there
were already blocks to play with. You
might also keep in mind the fact that I
thought it was an abstract exercise. If
I’d ever thought someone would dump
my work directly into implementation
I’d never have fooled around the way I
did. I did things that directly violated
the safeguards designed to keep the
stuff from getting out of control.”
“Like what?” Favored said weakly.
“Mutation, for one.” It was interest-
ing to hear myself talk.
More than
interesting, actually. It was like listen-
ing to someone else give a lecture on
my own life. As these revelations came
reeling out of dead storage and into the
light of day they were also emerging
into a realm where I could actually
know them, rather than their being

latent wisps of potential. “I didn’t do
too much hardware, per se; I was pre-
sented with a hypothetical substrate
that I used as a basis for implementing
an operating system, and then I did a
lot of application programming on top
of that. I did work out a lot of the user
interface material and the spell com-
piler - you know, the way the machines
could respond to incantations and so
forth, translating user commands into
internal reprogramming - but I got to
thinking how interesting it could be if
these programs could evolve. So I put
together a system that treats program
code like genetic code, letting program
fragments
transfer
across
nanoma-
chines, mate, and recombine. Most of
the time you’d get nothing, of course,
but my models showed that there were
enough ‘occasionallys’ that panned out
to make things interesting. But that’s

exactly the sort of interesting stuff you
don’t want going on out in the real
world. In software, anyway. Although
in my defense I have to point out these
concepts were already in the air when
I started tinkering with them.”
“How so?”
“I mean genetic engineering; real ge-
netic engineering. Where do you think
all you humanoids and nonhuman crea-
tures came from?
And why you can
all interbreed, and we can breed with
you too? Most species aren’t more than
few snips and twists away from human
makeup in the ﬁrst place.”
Was I only one in the area who
wasn’t trailing their jaw down around
their ankles?
It was always difﬁcult
to tell with Haddo, but as slack as
his hood looked I ﬁgured it wasn’t too
great a stretch to put his expression
down as “incredulous” as well. To be

truthful, I didn’t know if I was any less
confounded than the others, if perhaps
a little less outraged. I might actually
have gone a bit too far just now, telling
them in such a conversational tone
that they owed their existence to a few
nips and tucks by a harebrained ex-
perimenter. Probably best to turn the
conversation to something else. As it
happened, something else was at hand.
If -
“Why are you telling us this?” said
Favored. “Are you planning to rub us
out?”
“There’s been enough skulking around
in the dark as it’s been,” I said. “I don’t
care who knows any more. Except the
Scapula - now here we go.”
“What?”
I’d ﬁnally managed to trace Isk-
endarian to its Scapula instantiation
using its subcarrier signature. Now I

was inﬁltrating my code patches down
the link - had to use a low-bandwidth
packet to avoid alerting the recipient -
but it shouldn’t be -
“Huh,” I said.
“What?”
I’d never seen anything like it - a hu-
mongous power surge, coming from the
Scapula, no doubt, overloading every-
thing in sight - the emergency cutouts
in this workroom were kicking in but
it was anybody’s guess what his game
was this time, and what would be left
when the dust settled - or whether
there’d be anything left but dust. All I
could say was, “Hang on to your seat.”
“I don’t like the sound of this,” said
Leen. “Is he promising them miracles?”
“The amount of energy he’s slosh-
ing around,” Max muttered, “he may
actually be able to deliver.” The Cor-

pus itself was both source and con-
sumer of more power ﬂux than Max
had ever heard of being deliberately
wielded.
Just producing the appari-
tion of the Corpus - as was the ex-
pected case in your typical Knitting -
was a reasonable feat.
It left the as-
sembled Imperial ofﬁceholders none
the worse for wear, too, and uplifted
through their contribution to the spec-
tacle to boot.
But welding together
their bodies as the scaffolding for this
man-mountain horror, with on top of
them the cloaking illusion that made
the Corpus seem to have one skin, one
ﬂesh, was waste on a massive scale,
even if the Scapula hadn’t been suck-
ing their own life forces for an assist
in their own destruction. Even if you
didn’t like bureaucrats, they weren’t
all useless, and surely no one deserved
such a fate. Max didn’t even want to

think about those at the bottom, being
ground into mush by the weight of the
tons of mass atop them stretching up
into the sky.
The Scapula had been one of them.
To his other accomplishments he could
now add elevating the taking of re-
venge on your coworkers to a wholly
new plane. Presumably the multitudes
on their feet in the stands venting ac-
claimation at full volume had not yet
realized this was anything different
than the run-of-the-mill Knitting; pre-
sumably those who had had friends
or relations on the ﬁeld had no idea
that their intimates had already per-
ished or were likely to ﬁnish doing so
in the next few moments. Presumably
anyone left who understood what was
happening had been standing by with
the same impotent frustration as Max
himself, trying and failing to think of

some way to effectively oppose it.
But Leen was right; now Arznaak
was promising miracles,
too.
The
Corpus gestured, the ground around
its feet heaved, and then the surface
broke open and blasted itself up into
the air. Great gouting geysers spouted
up around the Corpus, as though it
were the centerpiece in some titanic
heroic fountain...
but what was that
material rising above the rim of the
stadium, arcing outward but not even
yet starting to descend? It didn’t look
like oil, or dirt, exactly; it seemed more
gooey and iridescent than either, more
like soap scum, perhaps - but now
the topmost portion of the spout was
churning and roiling, great clumps of
the material separating themselves
off and ﬂoating away as giant bubbles,
others twisting themselves together
and beginning to rain down... as wa-

ter, apparently, but mixed in with this
more typical rain was - stuff?
Leen and Phlinn and Max were al-
ready hiding under the chairs and
staying far enough away from the edge
to avoid being tossed over the side
by another of the platform’s frequent
lurches and tremors, but under cover
was now the right place to be for yet an-
other reason, as the Scapula’s promise
of miracles made solid began pelting
down from the sky - within the steam-
ing rain a hail of coins, small jewels,
chains and trinkets; just in front of
Max a whole cooked turkey impacted
on a soldier who had been crouched
low trying to shield his head. The man
fell over, knocked cold, as drumsticks
ﬂopped off to either side and stufﬁng
cascaded down his back.
Then the decanting cornucopia tilted
on its side and began to vibrate - no,

Max realized, it wasn’t what he was
watching that was shaking, it was him,
he was having some sort of a seizure -
the storm of stuff wasn’t the only thing
Arznaak was sending out, on top of
it was something magic, pure magic, a
sleet of magic like the noise of a million
people shouting at once into his ears -
Max felt his eyes bugging out. His
head felt like it was getting ready to
explode right off his shoulders from the
overload of ﬁrst and second level har-
monics.
Violet induction coils lashed
through
Max’s
personal
protection
ﬁeld, he knew he was gibbering mind-
lessly beneath the widespread roar,
and as his eyes whipped around most
everyone on the platform seemed to be
writhing themselves into a frenzy. Had
the Scapula deliberately hit them up
here with his full force, or was it like
this everywhere across the city?

Not far away, a piano plunged from
the heavens, plowed into a knot of
squirming people, and continued throug
the ﬂoor in a wild clanging clamor of
popping strings.
A pervasive groan-
ing and creaking and cracking became
more apparent. Was the tower ﬁnally
coming apart altogether?
“All right, already, Arznaak,” Max
found himself thinking. “Okay, you’ve
won.”

Chapter21
SHAA COULD DETECT his brother’s
transmission beam; he could almost
see it, even.
The rolling of the earth had subsided
enough, for a moment, that he thought
he might actually be able to reach the
beam’s point of origination, a squat
camouﬂaged pillbox sort of thing that
had popped itself out of the ground to
about knee-high. Then had come the
cavalcade of marvels.

It could have been worse.
If Shaa
had still occupied his location of half-
a-minute before he would have been
directly on top of one of the geysers
gushing precursors and the rest of the
grab-bag of stuff; indeed, he himself
would either have found himself ren-
dered for his constituents, or dropped
whole on some startled housewife or
ﬁshmonger as an offering from the
gods. He was also under the arc of the
fountain, so that virtually all of the
baggage descending from the heavens
was falling no closer than the inner tier
of the stadium, and much appeared to
be descending beyond the stadium and
perhaps even across the city.
Still, the assault of dry-goods was
not the only barrage underway.
The
paroxysmal energy bloom rolled over
him, making it feel like his very hair
follicles were crackling with eldritch

vigor. For whatever reason, though, it
became apparent as he probed the
surge ﬁeld with his suddenly aug-
mented power that he was within
something of a shielded lobe; that most
of this energy push was following the
distribution of the horn of plenty, being
directed outward at the spectators in
the stadium and the city beyond.
All the more reason to presume his
brother was near. Arznaak would nat-
urally guard against some sort of feed-
back overload. His power surge would
be affecting anyone who had any ca-
pability for magic - the more powerful
you were, the more the potential for
traumatic burnout, but there would be
folks around the city whose abilities
had been only latent who’d suddenly
be ﬁnding themselves shooting ﬂames
out of their ﬁngertips before they fell
over in a crisp.
He wouldn’t want to

fricassee himself, though - it appeared
Arznaak wanted to be the only magic
user of any ability whatever still left
standing when he was done, as well as
the only functional god.
But there wasn’t any particular rea-
son his brother should always get his
way.
Shaa’s
own
currently
augmented
energy stores wouldn’t last forever;
might as well use them. He gestured
ahead of him. A cloud of force-lines ap-
peared, spun themselves together into
a gleaming silver discus, and zoomed
off, condensing further and acquiring
the sheen of a perfectly reﬂective mir-
ror, skimming the ground and then
pulling up and virtually screeching to
a halt -
- directly in line with Arznaak’s scin-
tillating beam, an arm’s-length in front
of his pillbox.

Several things happened at more-or-
less the same time.
The beam beyond the mirror winked
out.
Shaa heard a mufﬂed yet nonethe-
less familiar voice cry out from un-
der the small pillbox and beneath the
ground, followed by a zip-zip-CRACK!
sound and a gout of steam from around
the beam’s lens-coupling;
then the
beam died.
Arznaak’s power burst desynchro-
nized and began to rapidly decay. The
rain
of
curry-favor-with-the-masses
trinkets began to lessen as well, al-
though who knew how long it would
take for the stuff already in ﬂight to
ﬁnish pattering down.
The Corpus took a look around, mo-
mentarily at a loss for words.
Then
Shaa could see it ﬁx its gaze on the
tower at the far end of the ﬁeld and

take a deliberate step in that direction,
lowering its arm toward it and open-
ing its ﬁngers as though to grasp the
pinnacle for a ﬁrm handshake.
Well,
it had stood to reason that Arznaak
would have left his golem with instruc-
tions in case communications were
abruptly severed. It would be interest-
ing to see how fast the thing began to
atrophy.
If, that is, Arznaak was actually
out of the picture.
Gashanatantra
had reached Shaa again,
dragging
a scorched-looking Jardin.
For that
matter,
Gashanatantra didn’t seem
particularly healthy himself.
Even
this
side-lobe
radiation
must
have
hit a god’s augmented system with
the same roasting fervor as being on
the receiving end of a bolt of light-
ning. “Did you stop the transmission?”
Gashanatantra gasped.

“Yes,” Shaa said, “at least for the mo-
ment. That would make the next natu-
ral step the storming of the hideout.”
“Shouldn’t someone be going out
there to ﬁght that thing?” Phlinn Arol
said nervously, as the Corpus ﬁxed its
gaze again on their position on the top
of the tower and headed resolutely in
their direction.
“Don’t look at me,” said Max, his
voice rubbery, the rest of him still
twanging like an elastic band.
Was
smoke coming out of his ears? But it
was looking like high time to do some-
thing other than wait around for the
Scapula’s next move, though, even if
that something was to jump.
“What’s that?” said Leen.
She was
gazing off behind them and into the
night sky above the rim of the stadium.
“What’s -” Max began,
wheeling
around to see what she was talking

about; in his obnoxious armor it was
impossible to merely crank his head
over to the side for a quick glance. By
the time he had gotten his ﬁeld of view
over to see what Leen was goggling
at, though, the answer was clear, and
not unfamiliar either - a large black
shadow against the stars,
swelling
rapidly, the ragged outline of feathered
wingtips, a descending wattled claw, a
-
“Hey!
-” Max began again, just as
it became obvious that the claw was
descending straight toward him, and
him alone, but before he could get any
further the foot slugged him in the
chest and his stomach fell out through
his toes as the clawed talons snapped
shut around his back and dragged
him across the tilting ﬂoor and - just
short of the guardrail- yanked him un-
ceremoniously into the air. “You crazy

idiot!-” Max gasped, “what do you think
you’re -”
Then the bird leaned over in a tight
bank, ﬂinging Max out sideways vir-
tually parallel to the ground,
and
Max saw between his feet the hand
of the Corpus, seemingly half as large
as the bird itself, as it mashed its
ﬁngers together on the space it had
obviously thought the bird would be
occupying at that particular moment.
From the block-sized foot sliding by far
below, too, it was obvious that the bird
was not taking their narrow escape
to heart, either; quite the contrary, in
fact, for it was wrapping itself into an
even closer spin around the body of the
Corpus. And here was the hand follow-
ing them, not surprisingly, now trying
to bat them out of the sky with the sort
of ﬂat-palm swat usually reserved by
normal-sized folks for a mosquito.

The bird was the latest player to be
out of its mind - that much was merely
empirical evidence - but it plainly
wasn’t going to do Max any good to
try to cure it, or put it out of its misery,
either. The damn thing was squawking
at him, too, and you didn’t have to be
Haddo and actually be able to hold two-
way conversations with the creature to
have a pretty good idea what it had
in mind. Or how limited your options
were if you wanted to do anything else.
At least Max had a sword, although
he might as well use it to run himself
through for all the good it was going
to do against Arznaak’s runamok Cor-
pus. Arznaak was too smart to leave
the proverbial soft unguarded patch
the size of a grapefruit where a single
sword-stab could hit a vital ganglion
and fell a construct the size of a small
mountain.

So what was the vulture’s plan?
Wait for the thing to decay on its own
and feast on the carrion?
Maybe the
bird did know carrion when it saw it,
but it was not out of the question that
under the circumstances it was plan-
ning for Max to ﬁll that role himself.
The bird was gaining altitude now; it
was still swooping around the Corpus’
trunk as the Corpus kept twisting to
try to keep it in sight. At least the bird
was continually side-slipping out of
the way of the Corpus’ vigorous swipes,
even if it was waiting for the last sec-
ond to actually make its escape, and
in the process it had succeeded - at
least for the moment - in distracting
the Corpus from its probable intent of
tossing the tower over the bleachers
and out of the stadium like a javelin.
Of course, the bird might be straining
for height merely to get the right angle

for lobbing Max into the thing’s mouth.
It did not appear particularly likely
that the Corpus had a gullet behind
its mouth, or indeed anything in the
way of internal structure or traditional
organs, but then again the bird was
crazy. And it was still a bird, after all.
On the other hand,
there didn’t
seem to be much point in continu-
ing the attempt to lie low. Max didn’t
think he could attract any more atten-
tion through a use of second-quantum
level energies than he’d accumulated
already.
Arznaak might have been
trying to burn out his magical abili-
ties through his power pulse, but if
he’d succeeded Max would probably
be dead; time to ﬁnd out how much
residual capacity he had left. The toes
of the bird were still wrapped ﬁrmly
around his body, leaving his arms free,
so he pointed with one of them at the

arm of the Corpus, which happened to
be trailing them astern at present, and
activated a passive probe. Max felt the
probe lock on, and when no retaliatory
spell-forms came barreling down the
line after him he boosted the gain and
added an active interrogator. Diagnos-
tics took shape around him, their level
of detail augmented by proximity, re-
vealing the structure of the animatory
apparatus keeping the Corpus intact.
The Corpus was clever work, with its
mass of captive functionaries trapped
in a supporting matrix that supplied
motive power and the cloak of unity,
clever - but apparently decaying. If he
could desynchronize the timing of the
stabilizer it might pull the ﬁnger out
of the dike, so to speak...
With the bird squawking its enthusi-
astic approval, Max began to tinker. It
was delicate work, not the sort of stuff

you really wanted to be doing while
hanging a few hundred feet in the air
in the foot of a giant vulture while the
object of your puttering tried to bash
you into mush, but there it was; he was,
after all, supposed to be a professional.
It didn’t seem wise to take more than
a few seconds to set up the job, either.
Max had determined that the Corpus
was indeed operating on internal pro-
gramming at the moment, but there
was no telling when Arznaak might
come back on line and deploy some of
the anti-magic defenses Max had thus
far been able to skirt. So - wrap it up
and send it off, Max thought, and he
yanked loose the originator cord and
felt the package slide away.
The giant arm waving after them
paused. The head of the Corpus skid-
ded by, looking thoughtful, and then
a ragged line of piercing silver sparks

ran crossways down its face from its
left eyebrow across the bridge of its
nose past the corner of its mouth and
around the angle of its jaw.
More
sparks burst loose on its chest, it took
one step backward, and then its head
and shoulders slumped downward a
good twenty feet, like a balloon just
getting underway with a solid leak.
That was not, in fact, far from the
case. “Enough, already!” Max yelled at
the bird. “Get us out of here!”
But instead the bird pulled up in the
air, laid its wings back, and dove to-
ward the head of the Corpus, its talons
extended toward the thing’s goggling
eyes.
“Two can play at this game,” I said.
My words were perhaps robbed of their
full impact, though, by the fact that my
face was being ground into the ﬂoor by
the chair that had ended up resting on

my back with one of my arms wound
through its understructure.
One of
my legs was trailing upward and it
felt like my foot had become wedged
somehow into the workstation’s desk
keyboard surface. Someone was moan-
ing, too, but for a change it wasn’t me;
it sounded like a suddenly asthmatic
Favored. When the Scapula’s sorcerous
tidal wave had hit, it had scrambled
me to a fair-thee-well and shot my vol-
untary muscle control out from under
me, but it had slammed into Favored
with the impact of multiple hits from
a rapid-ﬁre crossbow. He’d gone down
in a spasmodic heap and was now hud-
dled under the neural-interface couch.
Come to think of it, I hadn’t seen or
heard anything from Haddo and Wro-
claw, either.
I couldn’t admire the Scapula’s meth-
ods, or Favored’s either, for whatever

contribution to this mess had been his
responsibility. Overloading the subcar-
rier channel through sheer excess was
the solution of a brute with power to
waste; scorching everyone who was ex-
pressing mitochrondial genes for magi-
cal latency was downright genocidal. It
might be literally genocidal in the case
of the nonhuman species, all of whom
had the extra magic organelles woven
into their cellular ultrastructure more
as root constituents than the add-ons
more characteristic of magic-capable
humans. No, there were more reﬁned
ways to pound the world back to its
pre-magical days.
The genetic code
was there to command lysozyme re-
sorption of the magic organelles. For
that matter, there was a targeted onco-
gene, too, and an autoimmune solution
one of my associates had launched by
retrovirus a few hundred years ago; it

should certainly be established in the
population by now. And -
- and I realized I was thinking about
elegant and subtle ways to launch my
own apocalypse that would put the
Scapula’s to shame. That shouldn’t be
necessary, though, at least to target
anyone other than the Scapula himself.
Even in that direction it might not be
necessary. It might have been my imag-
ination, but I’d thought the Scapula’s
pulse was going to keep on building in-
stead of experiencing the abrupt decay
and trough that had sucked me back
into full awareness.
Had my modiﬁ-
cations to the Scapula’s Iskendarian
virus turned him into a living exam-
ple of rigor mortis? Had someone else
with paralytic intent made it to him
ﬁrst?
Was he trying to suck in any
counterattacks?
Had he just burned
out prematurely?

On the other hand, even if it was a
question of choosing between subdu-
ing the Scapula or leaving him free
to rampage again, I didn’t know if I
would try to use any of these tools that
might be available to me.
With the
effect of the Scapula’s blow still rever-
berating through the system who knew
what might go awry; I could set loose a
chain reaction that wouldn’t stop until
it had consumed...
well, a lot, if not
everything.
Even if the infrastructure wasn’t
messed up that could still happen.
But in any case the ﬁrst thing to
do was get my head back on the right
side of my feet, and see if the work-
station systems had come back enough
to tell me what was going on. It was
not quite as easy to do as say, how-
ever, for not only was my arm wound
around the chair, both arm and chair

were entwined with the walking stick
Monoch, whom I was still wearing
slung sidelong down my back. Maybe
Favored would ﬁnish reviving himself
in a timely enough hurry to be able
to give me a hand.
He was seeming
more alive, anyway,even though what
I could see of his skin through the
chair appeared unnaturally wet and
was sporting an unpleasantly green-
ish slime, and he was bubbling bright
red froth through his nose and mouth
during his respiration. He seemed to
be mumbling, “Gotta change my name,
gotta change my name,” too.
“Favored!” I said.
One eye cracked open and swam
blearily in my direction, completely
injected with red. “I don’t want to talk
about it,” he gurgled.
He wasn’t going to be of much use,
that was clear. I didn’t want to try any

sort of conjuration, either, even though
I still felt tingly and invigorated from
the Scapula’s rapid-grow treatment,
since on the one hand I didn’t know
what eddy loops and feedback circuits
might be left in the system, either in-
advertently or as deliberate mop-up
weapons planned by Arznaak, and on
the other hand I hadn’t really shaken
my anti-magic bent, whether it had
been inculcated in me by Iskendarian
or not. I thought it was past time to
be trying things just to see what might
happen.
There was a scrabbling sound be-
hind the viewing-gallery window and
a greenish clawing hand rose into view,
followed by the sagging face of Wro-
claw. If I kept craning my neck around
to see what was going on while my
nose and cheek still remained in inti-
mate contact with the ﬂoor, though, I

might end up frozen in an even more
unnatural position with no one but my-
self to blame for the crowning touch.
I tried again to lever myself up from
the ﬂoor with my free hand, simultane-
ously using my elevated leg as a pivot
point to roll over to the side and tip the
chair away from my back.
This time
I yanked with my entwined arm too,
and between everything the chair slid
free and crashed over onto the ﬂoor.
“Ow!” said the wincing Favored, cov-
ering his ear with his arm.
“Who was that?” I said.
“That was me,” muttered Favored. “I
was -”
“No, I thought I heard somebody new
trying to clear their throat, or maybe
just making one of those rattly noises
down in their chest. There it is again.”
A limp blackish dishrag had joined
the wilted Wroclaw at the viewing win-

dow, but it hadn’t seemed like the kind
of sound Haddo would make, anyway.
“I didn’t hear anything,” Favored
was saying, with surprising sharpness
for all his woebegone appearance.
“Shut up and let me listen,” I told
him. I had gotten my leg free, too, in
the process of relieving myself of the
chair, and was sitting up on the ﬂoor
with my back to the main console while
I tried to get my bearings.
But now
I thought someone was saying, faintly
and in a creaky voice, “Where am I and
what am I doing here?”
“Anybody hear anything that time?”
I said.
They all shook their heads, no. Was
Iskendarian back?
That was clearly
the fear in Wroclaw’s saggy-lidded
eyes, at least, and with the shower of
prodigies abroad in the land right at
the moment the prospect could not be

thoroughly discounted. But I -
Then I realized this voice was not
the only new message impinging on my
senses. There was a band of heat run-
ning diagonally down my back, heat
accompanied by a tingling thrumming
quiver, all these sensations coinciding
with the position Monoch in his walk-
ing stick form currently occupied.
I
reached up and back and pulled him
loose.
“What am I doing here?” said Monoch
now coming through much more clearly
as I grasped his handgrip. “Where am
I?” But - leaving aside for a moment
the fact that the sword had never actu-
ally spoken before - that voice certainly
didn’t sound like any voice I’d have
thought Monoch would use.
It didn’t
sound like the voice of a sword at all;
it was altogether too pleasant, that
and too thoroughly female, too. It was

also quite possibly a voice that was not
exactly unfamiliar to me.
In fact, it
sounded like -
“Damn it,” she said, “I’m in a sword!
What am I doing in a sword?”
Gash had told me Monoch was a
soul-drinker;
he must have sucked
her in while I was distracted and By-
ron and Iskendarian were playing out
their struggle for control of our body.
Now the Scapula’s power surge had
given enough of a jolt to let her emerge
into consciousness.
“It’s sort of a long story,” I said, “and
I doubt you’re going to like it very
much.”
“To who talking you are?” creaked
Haddo.
“Your late boss,” I told him, “Ronibet
Karlini.”
“What was that?” said Tildamire
Mont, ﬂat on her back on the street,

watching a few ﬁnal blue sparks, the
remnants of the brief tempest that
had suddenly engulfed them, trickle
off the tip of her nose and wiggle their
ways footward along her body. Another
small squid dropped out of the sky
and draped its slimy mantle across
her ankle. Next to her and still on his
feet, her father batted another falling
something-or-other out of the way with
the ﬂat of his sword.
“Karlini?” She
raised herself up and looked around
for him.
Karlini was sprawled on the ground
too, but he was unconscious again.
Even with the sickly yellow cast of his
exposed skin and the even brighter
yellow in the white of his lolling eye,
which she pulled back his eyelid to
view in the light of the lantern, he
still seemed happier to be rid of his
sense than he had all day being awake.

Whatever had just transpired surely
had nothing direct to do with them; it
would be as well to let him sleep -
“What’s that?” the Lion said sharply.
Deep in the wreckage they were
guarding, a pearly glow was seeping
up out of the ground, enough of a glow
to cast shadows upward amidst the
remaining scorched beams. The light
was shifting and waving, as though
shining through a pool of rippling wa-
ter, and the ground appeared to be...
bubbling.
Tildamire yanked Karlini forward by
the shoulders and began shaking him
vigorously. “Karlini!” she yelled in his
ear. “You better wake up and see this!”
“Allow me,” said Gashanatantra, and
with a wave of his hand the ground in
front of them exploded into the air in
a shower of churned mud and pulver-

ized stone. Picturesque, thought Shaa
as the mud glopped down around and
on top of them, but the stroke for all its
lack of moderation had been efﬁcacious,
for revealed before them, sunken into
the earth with its hardened ceiling now
peeled back in a large jagged hole, was
what apparently had been his brother’s
hideout.
Arznaak, however, was not
personally in evidence.
With the volume of mud still slump-
ing into the small pillbox, though, Arz-
naak could easily be swimming about
beneath the surface.
On the other
hand, if the backlash from the severing
of Arznaak’s transmission link with
the Corpus had been harsh enough he
could be unconscious somewhere in the
gloop, too, breathing the stuff with ter-
minal intent into his lungs. Of course,
Arznaak might no longer be anywhere
in the vicinity; there must undoubt-

edly be an exit from the facility which
he could have taken, conscious or not.
Arranging for conveyance in the midst
of adversity was characteristic of solid
planning.
Given that Arznaak was still being
as undetectable to Shaa’s tentative
probe as he had proved himself ear-
lier, the manner of resolution for any
of these possibilities was the same. A
morose expression on his face, Shaa
swung himself over the edge and slid
feet-ﬁrst into the bog.
The slime moved up his legs and
past his waist before stopping halfway
up his chest when his soles ﬁnally en-
countered solid ﬂoor. The chamber was
small, perhaps ten feet on a side, and
square, and the surface of the mud
was showing no indication of someone
breast-stroking about beneath it. Mov-
ing as quickly as possible across the

ﬂoor, which considering the adhesive
effect of the sludge was not quickly at
all, Shaa encountered ﬁrst (amidst the
more solid clumps of dirt within the
mud and the rubble from the traumati-
cally ruptured roof) an overturned and
splintered chair, and ﬁnally, set into
the far wall with the curve of its top
edge barely peeping above the mud,
an exit hatch, closed and dogged and
tingling to the touch with guardian
energies.
“Did you ﬁnd the body?” Gashanatant
shouted down at him from his perch on
the ground above.
“I’m afraid not,” said Shaa, backing
away across the ﬂoor from the hatch,
careful to avoid tripping over the sub-
merged chair. “Perhaps you would be
good enough to pry open the door in
that wall, preferable without shred-
ding me in the process.”

Gashanatantra let ﬂy. His effort this
time was rather more modulated, how-
ever, Shaa was pleased to see, and so
rather than ﬁnding himself separated
into an assortment of smaller pieces
(which had of course been a distinct
possibility) he was instead watching
the basin of muck slump away from
him
through
the
punched-through
door into whatever passage lie beyond.
Watching, and feeling the viscous pull
himself, so having little alternative he
let himself be dragged forward.
Ten feet or so into the dark tunnel
beyond the door the mud had subsided
enough for Shaa to easily squelch his
way free of it and continue carefully
ahead. The sides of the passage could
be brushed without fully extending his
arms, and if the low ceiling had not
already been swept free of dangling
cobwebs by someone’s earlier traversal

Shaa knew he would have been well-
festooned in no time at all. The shaft
ran straight back under the stands,
and although it would undoubtedly
angle up at some point to burrow up
from the sunken level of the parade
ground Shaa had not yet reached that
location as he hurried along when he
found himself stiﬂing a yawn, his eye-
lids growing suddenly heavy.
It was
after midnight, and the last days had
been characterized by a frenzy of activ-
ity at all hours and with precious little
diversion for sleep, but still it scarcely
seemed an appropriate moment for a
nap.
Behind the still-cascading roar
of the crowd he suddenly thought he
distinguished the barely musical skirl
of a pipe somewhat closer to hand.
A pipe?
Feeling increasingly sluggish and
clouded of thought, Shaa dug furiously

in his pockets.
Surely he still had
them; surely they had not slipped out
during one mad scramble or another;
surely they were not buried with so
much else beneath the mud of the
parade-ground ﬁeld - ah!
here they
were! - fouled with soggy grime no less
so than the rest of him, but it was not
a moment to stand on fastidious cere-
mony, he thought, cramming the plugs
deep into his ears.
There was light up ahead now, too,
actually in fact ahead and above, spilling
down through a vertical shaft and pick-
ing out a strange latticework of inter-
secting lines; a circular stair, that was
it, coiling itself upward toward the
unquestionable sound of Jurtan Mont.
Shaa began to creep carefully forward
again, then paused, as he heard from
behind him another rapid squelching
of muck-laden footwear, turning from

a deliberate jog to an erratic wobble,
followed by Gashanatantra’s spacy ut-
terance, heard distantly through the
earplugs, of, “What - what is that?”
“Cover
your
ears,”
Shaa
hissed,
watching the shadows shift at the base
of the stair as someone came down
it toward them.
There were at least
two of them moving, the one with the
lantern and another one advancing
below - and now that the light was
becoming more distinct it became clear
that there was another person in sight
as well, this one slumped at the base
of the staircase with his upper body
trailing upward along the lowest curve.
If one of the folks advancing down
the stair was Jurtan Mont, it seemed
likely the other would be Svin, and
- leaving aside totally the matter of
what they were doing here, and what
had become of Dortonn along the way

- it seemed reasonable to hypothesize
that the fallen form at the bottom was
that of his own erstwhile brother.
Shaa edged forward as behind him
Gashanatantra’s efforts to block out
his ears seemed to be proving inade-
quate to the need, judging by the clat-
ter of him sliding limply to the ground.
Shaa was almost at the upward branch
of the tunnel when he realized, virtu-
ally simultaneously, several things.
First, the person reclining on the
stairs was indeed his brother Arznaak;
rather than displaying the usual limp
and splayed posture of someone who
had just encountered the music of Ju-
rtan Mont unprepared,
though,
he
appeared to demonstrate instead the
rigidity of a cataleptic ﬁt, complete to
the rictus of open eyelids and eyeballs
tilted ﬁrmly back. Second, as the peo-
ple above descended the last coil and

drew into sight, the ﬁrst was indeed
revealed to be Svin and the second -
bearing both lantern and ﬂute - was
Jurtan Mont.
There was, however,
following just behind Jurtan Mont, a
third.
“Stop the music,” this man com-
manded, adding a peremptory wave
of his hand.
He pushed past Jurtan
and Svin, sparing barely a glance at
Arznaak and his convincing imitation
(however premature) of rigor mortis,
and gazed instead past Shaa down
the
tunnel,
where
Gashanatantra,
legs splayed on the ﬂoor, was leaning
against the wall with the more charac-
teristically groggy and slack-jawed ex-
pression of the Jurtan Mont-inﬂicted.
A fairly unpleasant grin spreading
across his face, the man advanced to-
ward Gashanatantra and stood over
him, his arms folded across his chest.

“So,” said the man, “Gashanatantra.
I understand I have you to thank for
spending quite an excessive amount of
time inside a ring.”
The bird dove at the Corpus, its
talons outstretched toward the giant
eyes. Max, still grasped ﬁrmly within
the other set of matching claws, pulled
up his legs and tried to brace himself
for impact. The Corpus was watching
them come in with a singularly vague
and disinterested expression.
Its as-
pect was not necessarily so surprising
when you considered that its cloak of
Knitting was in the process of shred-
ding itself apart ever more rapidly,
the gouts of silver sparks chasing up
and down around its skin like seam
lines ripping away on an overstuffed
pillow. Widening gaps were opening up
in some places where the silver lines

were pulling away from each other; in
other spots the silver burnout effect
was licking back along the skin itself,
consuming it in vast sheets of shimmer-
ing ﬂame that left a sparkling residue
swirling like dust in the air. Along the
seams and beneath the swaths could
now be glimpsed the surface layer of
packed bodies, wrapped around each
other in contorted poses, some clearly
in broken postures incompatible with
life, their Knitting ﬁnery now tatters
and rags stained liberally with blood,
others clawing feebly for the open air,
and a few (not yet the full avalanche
that would obviously soon be seen)
falling free of the matrix and beginning
their tumbling trajectories toward the
earth far too far below. With the bird
executing its currently suicidal and un-
necessary mission, Max fully expected
to be joining them within the next few

seconds.
But then the looming right eye fo-
cussed on them. Some residual trace
of its basic operational reﬂexes made
the Corpus take a half-step back; then,
as the bird shrieked at it for good mea-
sure, it lurched away again, its head
rearing back even faster than the body
as it tried to get its face away from the
imminent danger, the vast arms again
coming up behind them and the hands
bending in –
- when all at once the head jerked
back and disappeared.
It had not of course actually dis-
appeared,
Max realized;
what had
happened instead was that the unco-
ordinated Corpus had simultaneously
lost its balance and gone over back-
ward, pulling its head rapidly earth-
ward on its whip-lashing neck, and its
feet (though still embedded to a good

depth in the ground) had slipped out
ahead, where they were now plowing
two huge furrows through the ﬁeld and
sending tons of loam into the already
well-clogged air.
Perhaps some of the captive Im-
perial functionaries making up the
main mass of the Corpus would have
a greater chance of surviving when
the thing hit the ground, compared
to the likely outcome of descending a
hundred feet or so in free-fall, but by
the same token those on the Corpus’
back were about to become nothing but
thin-smeared marmalade.
As for the
stadium itself...
The bird had begun to ﬂatten out
its dive as the Corpus executed its
massive seconds-long topple toward
the ground, but had given off its fe-
rocious squawking, and so Max had
a chance for a quick glance around

without the distraction of having his
ears blown out at close range yet again.
So it was that he caught the sight of
one of the Corpus’ sliding feet, not yet
signiﬁcantly retarded by the ﬁfty-foot
earthen berm it had already shoved
away from it, moving inexorably in a
straight path that would shortly take
it directly through the base of the
Emperor’s observation tower. “BIRD!”
Max yelled, and somehow the creature
seemed this time to hear and agree, for
it stood up on a wing and came out of
its tight wheel driving hard for the end
of the ﬁeld.
Then, with a titanic rumble that
seemed synonymous with the crack
of doom, the remains of the Corpus
slammed into the earth.
The surface of the ﬁeld seemed to
leap straight up in the air as the
shockwave dashed outward toward the

stands. The rising mud and dust did
not completely obscure from view the
network of ﬁssures radiating from the
long canyon the impact of the Corpus’
body had spontaneously hollowed out.
The Corpus was still splitting apart,
too, revealing a dense concoction of
gore and carnage that was already mix-
ing its own cloud of spurting red with
the ﬂying mud. It could not have been
much more than a second after the im-
pact, for all the time-slowing effect of
viewing at ﬁrst hand a great calamity,
before the shockwave reached the front
of the bleachers.
More dust rose.
With the glacially
slow movement that signals the on-
set of a great avalanche, the northern
stands began to crumple toward the
parade ground, ﬁrst the ﬁeld-box tier,
than the middle, and so on up toward
the top, seats and benches and shriek-

ing masses rolling and tumbling until
they were lost beneath the billowing
dust. Perhaps other sections of stands
were going down as well; perhaps the
entire stadium was in the process of
collapsing inward;
but Max’s atten-
tion was now ﬁxed on the tower - or
rather on the remains of the tower, for
although the fall of the Corpus had ar-
rested the slide of the foot at the limit
of its outstretched leg just shy of the
tower’s base, the mass of the hill it had
pushed ahead of itself had been enough
to crack the tower in at least one spot
below the center-point, and as a result
the observation deck (impelled in ad-
dition by the large-amplitude tremors
wracking the ﬁeld) was spinning on its
axis as it crashed down the snapping
length of its ruptured pylon.
Max activated his second-quantum
level vision apparatus as the bird

glided slowly overhead, banking sharply
to avoid the eastern bleachers and
come around again for another pass.
Roughly in the center of the wreck-
age of the observation level spread out
across the top of the Corpus’ substan-
tial hill Max had seen the yellow-green
glow of a fully-activated personal pro-
tection ﬁeld; the Emperor’s, most likely.
Various other colors sparkled around it;
here a cross-hatched pulsing that was
probably some sort of amulet, there
the fading orange of another protec-
tion ﬁeld taxed beyond its limits, but
there - in just about the right place, too
- was the gold radiance of a god.
The bird came in low and slow and
released him.
Max crashed down ﬁf-
teen feet, his usual litheness deserting
him in the ridiculous black armor, but
he managed not to break his ankle or
land on anyone’s head in the process,

or at least not on anyone who was in
a condition to protest. He straightened
up and shoved aside a pile of bashed-in
chairs.
The gold shell revealed under the
rubble contracted and faded out. Phlinn
Arol, in an approximately fetal posi-
tion, looked up at Max over his shoul-
der.
Even with his protection ﬁeld
obviously jacked up to its maximum
level, Phlinn Arol still appeared excep-
tionally haggard, not to mention the
blood running freely from his nose and
ears.
His mouth was a bright frothy
red and the whites of his eyes had gone
entirely crimson. Still, he was clearly
alive, a fact underlined when he sat
up in a slow series of jerks, extending
his hand back down to whoever he had
been further protecting beneath his
body and within the extended cushion
of his shield.
Leen came into sight,

holding her head with her free hand.
Whether the blood on Leen was her
own or Phlinn Arol’s was not immedi-
ately apparent.
“I believe the blood is mine,” Phlinn
Arol gargled to Max. “I didn’t want to
survive all this only to have you hunt
me down and cut off my head.”
“Good thinking,” Max told him. “You
okay?”
Before either of them could answer,
the ground shook again, and a section
of structure not far away detached it-
self and went rolling away down the
side of the hill.
“Down?” Leen said, deciding not to
climb all the way to her feet. “Or up?”
“Let me check out up,” said Max. “Be
right back.” He clambered his way over
a knot of groaning Imperial guards,
that
decaying
greenish-yellow
glow
beckoning the way to the highest point.

Kicking aside an errant banquet table
bearing only the stained remains of
the refreshments it had recently dis-
played, the source of the radiance was
revealed.
The Emperor was lying on his back,
his
arms
outstretched,
thoroughly
dazed.
Max creaked over to him, re-
alizing that his black armor’s chest
plate had been pretty well cracked in
by the grasp of the bird. The Emperor
rolled his eye at Max as he loomed
overhead, and made a gargling sound.
“Yeah,” Max said to him, “so what
about those terrorists?”
That must have been the Corpus,
thought Shaa, watching the wood and
iron scrap that was the remains of the
circular staircase continue collapsing
in front of him down the vertical shaft
that was the exit from the tunnel. The

horizontal section of the underground
passage he had traversed a mere mo-
ment before was clogged with rocks
and earth a few paces back, and for
all anyone knew could have pancaked
the whole way out to its start. It was
quite annoying to have the whole long
business grind to its climax in such a
base manner, lacking all subtlety and
grace, distinguished solely by a surfeit
of mindless action, but there you were;
and on the other hand it was not at all
clear that all the climaxes had already
been performed.
“If anyone has a plan,” said Shaa,
“this would be a reasonable time to
reveal it.”
Actually, the situation might not
be as bad as all that. Svin, who had
been here a moment before, was now
gone, which meant he must have found
a way down into the tunnel, which

meant that the tunnel had not col-
lapsed,
not completely,
anyway,
al-
though sections of the ceiling had
clearly come down when the seismic
shock had rolled through, and other
areas were undoubtedly weakened and
awaiting their chance to do likewise.
Since that had also been the direction
of the earthquake’s epicenter condi-
tions were likely to be worse further
along.
Not as much worse as they were
ahead of him, though, where the cir-
cular staircase had largely fallen in.
It was impossible to worm one’s way
through the mangled wreckage to de-
termine the condition of the vertical
exit shaft itself.
Still, lacking the
always-pending development of a prac-
tical mode of levitation, whose real-
ization seemed all the more distant
given the current state of collapse of

the magical environment, and lacking
as well the services of a professional
mountaineer, even if they could reach
the chimney shaft and even if it did not
immediately afterwards cascade down
around their ears, there wasn’t much
they could do but stand at the bottom
craning their necks up at the sky. And
then, of course, there was also the mat-
ter of the cast of characters they had
here on hand.
This active cast was fewer in number
than it had been even several minutes
ago.
In the brief moment that Shaa
had had to examine his brother before
the earth began to shake and the pre-
monitory rumble of the circular stair-
case pulling itself free of its moorings
in the rocks had led Svin to yank him
clear with one huge grab-and-ﬂing, it
had been apparent that Arznaak was
suffering from insults to multiple sys-

tems.
Arznaak’s skin demonstrated
widespread burns and surface trauma
consistent with backblast from his own
power beam being reﬂected onto him.
The more signiﬁcant afﬂiction, how-
ever, and presumably the one that had
brought him down in a seizure state
alternating between rigor mortis-style
rigidity,
widespread
clonic
tremors,
and primitive reﬂexes of forebrain-
release characteristic, all beneath a
face-full of writhing muscles of ex-
pression and rolling, vacant eyes, was
whatever malign force was wracking
his brain. It was mild to say Arznaak
had no shortage of enemies, though,
especially when one incorporated into
their number not only the full roster
of extant gods, however short that list
might be, but the surviving population
of Peridol to boot. Shaa was perfectly
happy to have yielded the right of coup

de grace to whichever one had laid him
low. Of course, Shaa had been the one
to be standing mere feet away as what-
ever remained of his brother had been
entombed beneath a rain of stair risers
intermixed with what was undoubt-
edly tons of wrought-iron supporting
structure.
For some reason, Shaa could not ﬁnd
it in himself to dig him out. So perishes
another solemn vow, he mused. Yet in
this at least Max had been clearly
right; Shaa’s father had had no busi-
ness demanding such a deathbed oath
in the ﬁrst place. Shaa had been free
to acknowledge that it had not been in-
appropriate for he himself to share the
blame.
Romantic notions of chivalry
totally unreciprocated by their beneﬁ-
ciary had no place in their scurrilous
modern world, replete as it was with
all manner of chicanery, venality, and

downright
backstabbing
cussedness.
But now Arznaak was off the table,
oath or no oath, and even if their fa-
ther had been around to do something
about it, even he might have been
able to see the consequences that had
ﬂowed from his irrational coddling of
his eldest son. In any case, it was not
worth losing sleep over.
Which meant, of course, that Shaa
well knew he had plenty of late nights
and bleary-eyed mornings to which to
look forward, the rightness of the situ-
ation notwithstanding. That would do
for later, however - and would also de-
mand that he get on in the meantime
with the matter of surviving, in order
to have the option of sleepless nights
to come. There was still the business of
the two members of that small band of
god-survivors who happened to be do-
ing their own surviving at the moment

in their midst, and were attempting to
resolve between them the question of
whether their ranks were about to be
reduced by yet another one.
Gashanatantra had shaken off the
aftereffects of Jurtan Mont as well
as a ﬁrst-timer could typically hope,
which meant that even without the
upheaval of the earthquake, the ear-
boggling collapse of the staircase, and
a section of tunnel ceiling just above
his head coming down on top of it,
he would have been somewhat addled
and lethargic for a few moments yet
to come. Instead, Shaa observed him
to have been simultaneously invig-
orated by the adrenaline rush and
scrambled by the environmental con-
vulsions. At least Gashanatantra had
been sufﬁciently oriented to begin dig-
ging his way out, and having been in
the shielded lobe at the time of Arz-

naak’s power pulse he still had the
strength to make a good show of it. Of
course, having Shaa, Svin, and Jurtan
Mont available to shift rocks and earth
from the other end had unquestion-
ably been essential to his escape from
asphyxiation.
Pod Dall, on the other hand, for
all his pointedly menacing remarks
to Gashanatantra seconds before, had
fared in all regards worse.
Whether
due to his traumatic recorporation
in a body near death (more Arznaak
here, without a doubt, from the story
highlights Jurtan Mont had hissed to
him during the moving of earth), his
debilitation from his sojourn in the
ring, the effect of Arznaak’s overload
pulse, some unrevealed chicanery of
Gashanatantra’s (which could scarcely
be ruled out), or any number of fac-
tors together, he had gone down be-

neath the cascade of earth and had not
budged again. Even after he had been
dragged free of the fall by a fortuitously
protruding digit, gasping stentoriously,
he gave every appearance of being out
for a fairly long count.
“Well,” said Gashanatantra, brush-
ing clods of dirt from his hair and
staring down at his fallen colleague, “I
suppose that’s that.”
“Will you kill him now?” Svin asked.
“No,” Gashanatantra said thought-
fully.
“I think there’s been a bit too
much of that lately, don’t you?”
“He seemed ready to kill you!,” Jur-
tan Mont pointed out.
“Yes, well,” said Gashanatantra, “I
think he was only having his fun.
I
could have most likely talked him out
of it.”
There was more to it than that, Shaa
knew. From the available evidence the

two of them might represent a signif-
icant proportion of the gods left alive.
Depending on just how much dam-
age Arznaak had caused, every last
one of them might need to stand to-
gether before too long.
Shaa noted
Gashanatantra now eyeing him, of all
people.
Shaa cocked a noncommittal
eyebrow,
which
Gashanatantra
an-
swered with an almost imperceptible
dip of his head. “Whatever the case,”
Shaa reiterated, “might I propose exit
from this place, before the option is
removed utterly from us?”
“This way?” said Svin, his voice echo-
ing back down the tunnel toward them.
“Is it passable?” Shaa called after
him.
“So far,” shouted Svin.
“Yes?” Shaa said, now addressing Ju-
rtan Mont, who had assumed his accus-
tomed posture of attentive listening.

“What?
Oh, yeah.
The tunnel
sounds best.”
“Hm,” mused Shaa. “More evidence
for a different modality, unmediated by
the standard infrastructure.” Jurtan
had said he was hearing a heavy over-
lay of static, but his music sense all
told was remarkably unaffected by the
disruption to the magical ether.
“Let
us go, then,” he continued, “while the
going is as good as it is likely to get.”
Gashanatantra hefted Pod Dall over
his shoulder in what Shaa deemed a
reasonable act of camaraderie and they
set off down the tunnel, Svin leading
the way from somewhere up ahead
and Jurtan Mont monitoring whatever
extrasensory channels he was prone
to frequent. In the event, the tunnel’s
condition was not too terrible, mean-
ing that although earth and rock-fall
were frequent there was no obstacle

that they could not traverse with rea-
sonable alacrity.
Sooner than Shaa
had expected they had already entered
the region of sludge that implied they
were close to the exit. He even allowed
himself the momentary fantasy that
this might in fact be the ending of
the whole long business, that all that
might remain would be some cleaning
up and sorting out, and perhaps a few
days off in the sun somewhere.
These pleasant reveries accompa-
nied him through the sludge and the
clamber up onto the ﬁeld, where they
passed quickly and ﬁrmly into memory,
as Shaa had expected of them. As they
surveyed the situation, Jurtan Mont
came up beside Shaa, cocking his ear.
Through the static, Jurtan thought
he was hearing another familiar theme.
He squinted off across the ﬁeld, beyond
the mounds of bodies and the lakes of

gore and the writhing injured, to the
heap of wreckage atop an apparently
fresh hill, and the people making their
way down it. “Look!” he said, pointing.
“In that dark armor, with his head free.
Isn’t that Max?”
“This thing has bit the dust,” I said,
sliding my chair back from the work-
station console. Favored had managed
to bypass the cutouts, and in any case
no one had ever anticipated a maneu-
ver such as Arznaak had just pulled;
his power pulse had fried everything
sensitive that was online to any el-
ement of the gods’ infrastructure, a
category that was bound to include a
fair number of brains as well as the
burned-out systems in front of me. If
it hadn’t cut out when it had, proba-
bly because the modiﬁed Iskendarian
virus had shut Arznaak down from
within, there wouldn’t have been a

magic user with any more processing
power in their head than a rabbit any-
where closer than ﬁve hundred miles.
There was still too much noise and
static on the modalities I could access
directly to punch through to anything
with decent information content, or
to retrieve any news that might be
out there either.
Nevertheless, I had
the nasty feeling there could be nasty
things sprouting all over the place; you
don’t spontaneously supercharge ev-
erything in sight and assume they’re
all going to sit there saying “Ooh! How
interesting!” while they wait for the
cows to come home. Potions, for exam-
ple, especially those produced in bulk
plants in industrial quantities, had a
tendency toward instability even un-
der everyday conditions. They could be
blowing their vats sky-high for all we
knew down here, or worse - potentially

much worse - they could be reacting
and recombining and mutating into
stuff that would never consent to see-
ing the inside of a vat again.
Whether there was any chance of
counteracting the situation - or more
precisely the thousand different sit-
uations that were probably evolving
out there even as I sat thinking - was
highly questionable. Even if I had the
superuser equipment to start tinker-
ing with the overrides and common
carrier controls and the general guts
of the system, or triggering the wait-
ing oncogenes or retroviruses or other
biologicals, I might be able to do noth-
ing but make the general predicament
worse.
The system I’d set up all those years
ago wasn’t the only possible modality
that could inﬂuence affairs, either. To
meddle directly by rolling up sleeves

and plunging arms into the guts would
be cruder and rawer and less effective
than working through the transform-
ers and facilitator channels, but the
world out there wouldn’t wait.
Any-
thing that had survived the assault
on the infrastructure would already be
exploiting any alternatives.
For the ﬁrst time since the beginning
I had begun to think seriously about
the autokill self-destruct option.
But
I’d still need to get to an operational
workstation, one that had been off-line
during Arznaak’s pulse and that hadn’t
had its cutouts tampered with. “Any-
body know the fastest way to get to the
Archives from here?” I asked.
Tildamire Mont hadn’t been certain
Karlini was actually going to wake up,
and when he did start to move it was
with his eyes rolled back and his arms
and legs jerking spasmodically, and

when the seizure had stopped and she
and the Lion had gotten him turned
over so he could ﬁnish vomiting with-
out asphyxiation and he opened his
eyes for real, blood still running out of
his ear, and his face and eyes as red
as if he’d been run head-ﬁrst into a
freshly painted wall, well, by then the
reason she’d wanted to so urgently get
him sensible had advanced far beyond
a curiosity into a clearly signiﬁcant
hazard.
She didn’t know if she’d ever been so
aware of the movement of air. There
was a slight breeze, and it was blowing
away from them, which meant that the
material that had come foaming up
from the ground under the wreckage
of the laboratory and was now hav-
ing its top layers wafted away by the
wind in streamers of bubbles was head-
ing in the other direction rather than

settling over their own heads. In the
glow of the streetlights and the illumi-
nation from the Knitting celebration
ﬁreworks that were still occasionally
going off overhead the stuff had an oily
sheen and was a particularly dingy
shade of gray as well; it looked over-
all like the sludge left in the laundry
barrel after the clothes were clean.
Its scummy appearance was not espe-
cially cheerful, but it wasn’t notably
ominous either.
The menacing char-
acter came from what the stuff was
doing: it wasn’t merely coating the sur-
faces of the obstacles it encountered in
its path, it seemed to be sinking into
them, penetrating, being absorbed. It
was unclear what happened to the ob-
stacles next.
It was thoroughly clear
to Tildamire, however, that she didn’t
want that stuff inﬁltrating her.
“That looks bad,” said the Lion.

“Have you ever seen anything like it,
Dad?” Tildamire asked.
“No,” the Lion told her.
“But I
learned a long time ago never to trust
anything escaped from a vat.
Gray
goos are bad business.”
Karlini made a gurgly sort of sound.
Had there been a word in there, per-
haps with the inﬂection of a question?
He was up now on his hands and knees,
his head hanging down toward the
ground, but he was shaking his head
as though trying to clear it, and if his
eye, when he rolled his face far enough
to the side to peer up at Tildamire, was
not completely focussed or any less
bleary, it was still no longer the empty
vacant blank that had been the case a
few moments before. He gargled again,
and this time his utterance sounded
more like “Goo?”
The Lion grabbed him by the scruff

of the neck, hoisted him to his feet,
and pointed him at the mounting foam.
Karlini stared for a moment, at the
mound of ooze in the wreckage, al-
ready easily twice their height, at the
sheen covering the buildings behind
it, and at the waving sheets of foam
sailing off down the alley and over the
tops of the structures and out of sight.
“Damn,” Karlini said.
“Can you stop it?” said Tildamire.
“Or kill it? Or whatever?”
Karlini raised a limp hand, looked
at it, then forced his ﬁngers into some
sort of spell-sign. A sickly green wisp
puffed out of his ﬁngertips and faded
out, and at the same Karlini uttered an
involuntary grunt of pain, as though
someone had punched him in the stom-
ach. “Lemme sit down,” he mumbled at
the Lion.
“No,” the Lion said. “Go ahead and

kill the slime ﬁrst.”
“I can’t,” Karlini said, sagging even
more.
“What the hell kind of talk is that?”
snarled the Lion, with the look of some-
one who is just about to wallop his con-
versational partner over the head.
“Burnout,” mouthed Karlini. “Power
pulse hit hard.
Can’t probe - remote
sensing channels are out.
Can’t call
for help - carriers are down.
Magic’s
useless till things settle down, maybe
longer than that.”
“Arr!” the Lion growled, and shook
Karlini
hard
enough
to
make
his
teeth actually rattle.
So that really
could happen - Tildamire had always
thought it just a colorful turn of phrase.
“Dad,” she said, “that’s not going to
help anything. Karlini, is that bubbly
stuff what I think it is? The material
from Roni’s vats alive and growing

again?”
“Hoped it was all dead,” Karlini
mumbled.
“Couldn’t detect anything.
Must have been almost dead, must
have been only a few drops of it dripped
down into a crack in the ground, saved
it getting sterilized by the ﬁre. Would
have ﬁnished dying if that power pulse
hadn’t come through, give it a major
transfusion.
Burnout for me, energy
to grow for it.
Should have died out
of the vats anyway, lacked essential
nutrients - told Roni not to let them
mutate.”
Magic-generating organisms, Tildami
thought. Magic-using organisms. Each
one of them might be too small to
see, but put enough of them together...
“But Roni was developing them as tools,
right? To respond to your commands,
something you could tell to do spells
on its own instead of having to do it all

yourself, right? So why not command
them, tell them to kill themselves off?”
“They’re not listening.
Must have
mutated, must have gotten rid of the
self-destruct -”
“I don’t know what the hell you’re
talking about,” said the Lion. “They’re
magic.
Magic’s your job.
I can’t cut
it with a sword, it’s goo. So start do-
ing your job. Shaa thought you could
handle it or he wouldn’t have sent you.
You said ﬁre kills it? Then let’s start
lighting off buildings. Somebody’s got
to stop it. That stuff’s got to be danger-
ous.”
Before Karlini was able to respond, a
bat came toward them into the nearest
light, the paper-dry rustle of its wings
erratic and its ﬂight path lurching,
until abruptly it careened head-ﬁrst
into the light standard with an audible
thwack and fell limply to the ground.

The bat’s skin had blotches of an iri-
descent sheen, and through its skin,
the bones seemed to glow a pale yellow.
“Why does that thing still look like it’s
moving?” said Tildamire.
It wasn’t moving, not exactly, but ar-
eas of its skin did appear to be... foam-
ing. “Let’s get out of here,” said Karlini.
“Now.”

Chapter22
“SOMETHING’S HAPPENING OUT
THERE,” said Max, as they jogged
and weaved down the alley, “something
that’s not good. I can feel it.”
“How?” said Leen. “How can you feel
it?”
“Intuition,” Max told her.
“That
pulse of Arznaak’s was bad medicine,
the kind of thing that sets off chain
reactions nobody can see the end of.”
The exit from their current alley

came into view around another twist,
and they saw yet another wider street
ﬁlled with yelling, shrieking, stamped-
ing people. The revelry of the past sev-
eral days had now clearly tilted over
from the riotousness of celebration to
the riot of panic; it was now no news
to anyone in the area that the gods
had been at each others’ throats in
their very midst, and that the general
public had been placed on the playing
ﬁeld themselves. The hysteria was be-
ing spread by the realization that the
imminent fate of the masses was not
merely a matter of the dire threats of
folklore or even the cautionary tales
of ancient history, of the collapse of
empires or the devastation of conti-
nents; no, the casualties in the midst
of the city - at the Knitting itself - were
plainly in the thousands, and blood-
soaked but still ambulatory victims

were spreading the graphic image in
their ﬂight across the city away from
the stadium.
As if that were not message enough,
the rain of prodigies from the sky had
not entirely ceased either, and the evi-
dence of its landing was impossible to
overlook, whether it took the form of
a thirty-foot boulder freshly embedded
in a ripple-edged crater straddling a
boulevard and an adjoining building,
surrounded by what must have been
a lethal spray of cobblestones; or a
ﬁshing net still slick with sea-wrack
and crammed with expiring skipjack;
or the numerous structures along the
streets with their roofs caved in and
ﬂames mounting through the shat-
tered beams; or the rampant evidence
of wild sorceries, uncontained and un-
controlled, their control logics scram-
bled and even the characteristics of

their manifestation transformed. The
wizard lights, for example, so common
a feature of Peridol’s streets as to be
unremarkable, had now become a con-
stellation of miniature suns, comets,
ﬂares, and diving torches, any of which
might unexpectedly swoop down from
the sky and explode into a building
or pounce incidentally on an unlucky
pedestrian, burning their skin or blind-
ing their eyes or - as in several cases
they had passed - immolating the vic-
tim in a spontaneous sooty pyre.
Max and Shaa and Phlinn Arol, each
of whose power was still reasonably in-
tact due to the shielding effect of their
proximity to Arznaak’s inner lobe, and
whose minds had not been reduced to
mush in the manner of so many oth-
ers they had passed, without obvious
wounds yet still crumpled on the pave-
ment or clawing at their eyes or baying

at the sky, drooling with dedication and
incoherence covering their expressions,
had been maintaining a common shield
over the group. This barrier had not
been subjected to direct attack but had
been proving effective in deﬂecting the
swooping passes of errant aerial haz-
ards.
Svin’s sword had been equally
convincing for those hazards of a more
concrete nature.
Svin, in the lead now, slowed at the
alley’s exit and leaned out into the
street. Even in the midst of ﬂight, it
was prudent to look ahead to see if you
were rushing into something worse;
after all, the throng trampling ahead
of them might be in active ﬂight from
some fresh immediate menace.
In-
deed, almost as soon as the two groups
had linked up on the battleground of
the stadium ﬂoor and had launched
their escape from the arena through

a grandstand tunnel now emptied of
spectators still able to walk, they had
suddenly heard again the tumult of
pounding feet and the shriek of voices,
and had seen ahead of them a shifting
light, now gold, now red.
Flattening
themselves against the wall, they had
let the terriﬁed pop-eyed pack swarm
past them without sweeping them off
their feet.
Behind the ragged mob,
though, was the source of the light,
revealed to be a humanoid creature
of ﬂame, accompanied by a smaller
ﬂame-cloaked familiar projecting the
general aspect of a terrier. Within each
could be glimpsed the remnant of a
corporeal form; a sorcerer caught in
the midst of a spell, perhaps, which
had blown back over him and the dog
at his feet.
Max’s ﬁrst thought had
been to try to snuff the ﬁres and see if
the person within could be saved, and

Phlinn Arol and Shaa had similarly
shifted into readiness for some sort of
operation, but - almost faster than the
eye could follow - Svin, in a broad hor-
izontal two-hand sweep followed by a
tight overhand loop that converted his
blade’s trajectory to the vertical, had
rendered the issue moot.
Eyeing the
heatless ﬂames as they churned along
the remains of the carcasses,
Svin
had said, “Emergency conditions ap-
ply. Any questions?” and that, rightly
enough, had been that.
“Isn’t there something you can do to
stop this?” Jurtan Mont gasped now, to
no one of them in particular, as Svin in
his role as spearhead shoved his way
out into the street.
“Nothing to do but stay out of the
way of this stuff until it burns out,”
Max said.
“What if it doesn’t burn out?” said Ju-

rtan. “Some of these things look like
they’re eating, getting stronger. Look! -
like that!”
Ahead of them, three of the leaping
ﬁre-comets, each about the size of a
bushel basket, had suddenly begun
to orbit each other, wrapping them-
selves quickly into an overlapping spi-
ral.
An even more powerful burst of
light strobed out, and when the bright-
ness had died enough a second later
so the thing could be viewed without
squinting, the three had become one.
“That’s not all,” Jurtan went on. “I
keep hearing music...”
“Yeah?” said Max. “What music?”
“The Karlinis’ themes. And things I
used to hear back at their lab.”
Shaa said, “I sent Karlini back there
to keep an eye on things.”
Leen said, “I should check on the
Archives,
and your sister and my

brother and poor Tarfon trapped in
the secret passage.”
Max said, “With things the way they
are we shouldn’t split up.”
Phlinn Arol said, to no one in par-
ticular, “Max has a tendency to overre-
act.”
Max threw up his arms. “Go wher-
ever you want, then, the lot of you!”
He turned and seemed about to plunge
into the crowd on his own, leaving the
rest of them behind.
“Max!”
said
Leen
admonishingly.
“Don’t run amok. Look, the palace com-
plex is just down this street. I know
one of the back ways in.
Come on,
follow me.”
Gashanatantra, who had been keep-
ing pace with them but keeping his
own counsel as well, spoke in Phlinn
Arol’s ear.
“We should talk,” he said.
“Between the three of us,” he shifted

Pod Dall on his shoulder again, “and
Jill-tang, whom I would hope is intact,
and Jardin, if he escaped the stadium,
we represent a large proportion of our
remaining peers. Between us we have
things to discuss.”
“What about Byron?” said Phlinn
Arol.
“If he survived, he could easily
set the agenda.”
“He was led down the path once,”
Gashanatantra said.
“I doubt he’s
evolved enough to escape that happen-
ing again. But on the other hand...”
“Yes?”
“The current situation may be just
the sort of contingency for which he
had prepared some emergency plan.”
“That may be so, but how would you
plan to ﬁnd him in all this mess? I can’t
hear anything through this din.”
They both knew he wasn’t discussing
the noise level of the crowd. “Maximil-

lian is right,” Gashanatantra decided,
“this is no time to be wandering the
streets alone.
This group is rather
clever; perhaps they will lead us to
him.”
Karlini had continued glancing be-
hind him as he and the two Monts
retreated from the bubbling goo, and
had seen something that had made
him more nervous than the obviously
infected and mutating bat.
A line of
insanely hypertrophied wizard lights
had passed them overhead like ﬂaming
beads on a string, heading toward the
wrecked laboratory. Over the mound of
gray, the string of globes had gone into
a downward spiral as though circling a
drain, and then, with a rapid slurping
pop-pop-pop, had dove into the goo and
disappeared...

...
but it hadn’t seemed so much
as though they were diving, as being
sucked.
Clearly this was a problem,
and one for which Karlini felt some re-
sponsibility, although the real predica-
ment had come from an overlapping
cascade of roughly independent events
rather than someone setting out to
have things wind up this way.
And
the Lion was right, someone would
have to try to do something about all
this.
The question was whether any-
thing anyone could do would make any
difference. Hopefully some sort of re-
inforcements would show up soon, and
they would have a better idea how to
proceed.
Karlini and Tildamire had stopped
a block or so upwind, where the Lion,
snarling at their lily-liveredness, had
smashed his way into the corner gen-
eral store in search of the ingredients

for an incendiary device. Now that the
Lion had found his supplies and was
busily hurling ﬁrebombs into the build-
ings up the street, he was still foaming
over with a constant mutter of curses,
most of which were fortunately impos-
sible to clearly discern. The breeze was
now carrying new sheets of ﬂame to-
ward the swelling pillows of goo.
The commotion was also bringing
the few denizens of the neighborhood
who were still on hand, rather than
present at the Knitting or just out
carousing, staggering into the street.
“How long you think it’s going to take
before those people your father’s burn-
ing out of their homes gang up and
try to lynch him?” Karlini said to
Tildamire.
“What father?” said Tildamire. “I’ve
never seen that man before in my life.”

“Okay,”
said
Favored-of-the-Gods
weakly, consulting his tattered map
yet again in the light of Wroclaw’s
lantern. “Looks like we take the next
right, and then there’s some kind of
exit.”
The right turn Favored had men-
tioned was visible just ahead. It was
just as well the light was meager; I
didn’t need to see my companions to be
reminded how dismal the bunch of us
looked. By rights, none of us should be
ambulatory, but then there was very
little right about the situation.
“Found it have I,” said Haddo, scratch
ing his way unevenly around the cor-
ner. A section of the passageway wall
leaned outward, actively creaking. We
wedged our way through it and found
ourselves facing a line of wide tables,
and beyond them, rows and stacks of
books.

“What part of the Archives is this?” I
asked Favored. “It looks like the main
Reading Room, right? How do we get
to the hidden stuff?”
“Let me see,” he said. “I -”
We all froze. We had just heard an-
other door bang open somewhere close
at hand, followed by a clatter of feet
and the sound of a rabble of low voices.
“Retreat?” hissed Haddo.
“No,” I said, “wait.” We were con-
cealed from the main door by the pillar
that also shielded the exit from the
secret passage, but the lanterns car-
ried by the new group were already
lighting up the large room ahead of
them. I peeked around the pillar and
discovered my imagination hadn’t been
playing tricks on me this time, anyway.
I still didn’t particularly want to deal
with Max, but in the scheme of things
I thought I could cope.
I raised my

hand, stepped into the open, and said,
“Hey, there.” They all wheeled toward
my direction, but fortunately no one
moved to attack.
Instead, about a half-dozen voices
said “You!” in tones of varying in-
credulity.
“That’s right,” I told them. “And I bet
we’re all heading for the same place.”
“See?” said the Lion, between pants.
The reason he was panting had a lot to
do with the fact that they had just been
chased headlong down several twisted
streets, only managing to elude their
pursuers by seizing a quick route to the
nearest rooftop after rounding the lat-
est corner. Even the Lion had decided
against making a stand to ﬁght them
all single-handed after the fellow with
the crossbow had appeared, although
they’d surely hear his complaints about
their poor supporting work later.

Now the chase was clattering away
beneath the very tree whose overhang-
ing branches had proved so timely.
“See what?” demanded Karlini.
“I’m
not up to this nonsense any more.”
Indeed, Tildamire didn’t understand
why Karlini wasn’t unconscious again
yet; he was clearly exhausted enough
for it. But her father was looking away
from them, beyond the peak of their
perch’s slightly canted roof and the
low buildings across the next street.
“There,” he said, pointing.
And indeed the lane two streets
over was clearly the site of his recent
rampage;
the twisting avenues had
brought them back around to a close
overlook of the renewed ﬁres. “Yeah?”
said Karlini. “So what? So as an arson-
ist you’re a success.”
The Lion spared him a contemp-
tuous glance.
“Another menace is

crushed. Thanks to direct action, not a
useless magician.”
Karlini sighed. “Okay, so what about
all the screaming coming from that di-
rection?
Don’t tell me it’s all people
you burned out of their houses. Sounds
like it’s extending a pretty good dis-
tance downwind.”
“Perhaps my scourge failed to reach
far enough,” the Lion said thoughtfully.
Off beyond the ﬁres, there was sud-
denly an abrupt ﬂicker of lacy green,
as though a ground-hugging lightning
strike had ramiﬁed its way down a
street. “Are you ready yet to do your
part?”
“I don’t care if you use your scourge
on me,” said Karlini, “I’m still burned
down to a crisp.
What about you,
Tildamire?”
Tildamire shrugged.
“I wish,” she
said.

Karlini glared at the Lion. “Are you
going to hit me with your sword if I tell
you we’d better get out of here and get
hold of some help?”

Chapter23
If Leen hadn’t quite liked the idea
of opening her Archives up to visi-
tors earlier, when each of them could
be evaluated on an individual basis,
she had never considered the idea that
matters could quickly get a lot worse.
There was no point in not admitting
it: she hated having all these unvetted
people tramping through her domain.
But there was no point in dwelling on
the situation either, since it was clearly

far too late to be complaining. But still.
It wasn’t a single guest here and an-
other there. This was an out-and-out
convention.
Even the Archive guardians had
been cooperating, though not neces-
sarily through any voluntary decision
on their own. She’d have thought the
guardians would have just fried the
lot of them and be done with the af-
front.
The guardians, though, had
proved barely in evidence, revealing
their presence only by the barest back-
ground murmur. Aside from randomly
glowing patches of wall and errant
wisps of steam, too, the path into the
Archives - so fraught with danger and
exacting maneuver under normal cir-
cumstances - proved merely a maze of
twisty passages, a coiled slide, and a
short staircase, although the entrances
and exits from the individual chambers

were still as likely to be found in awk-
ward locations halfway up a wall as in
the normal aspect ratio for doorways
or arches.
If this sort of thing was the rule
throughout the city - and there was no
reason to presume it was not, given
the other widespread evidence of the
impact of Arznaak’s attack - then there
would be any number of banks, trea-
sure troves, and strongboxes whose
wards and alarm systems would be
out of order; a paradise for thieves
and reavers, in other words. And the
palaces of the gods! - their masters laid
low, their special defenses disabled,
their
whole
rationale
undermined...
whole wars could be sparked over that
plunder. But then...
The Archives were a treasure house
of the ﬁrst rank, too.
And their de-
fenses, as she had just seen, were at

the moment more hypothetical than
anything else.
Of course, what she did have on
hand, in this motley congregation, was
a resource rich both in cunning and
in serious brawn.
She helped them
sort themselves out and let them set
to work, some on preparing a substi-
tute defense against assault, some on
ministering to the worst-off among the
gang, the rest bent over tasks they set
themselves.
What Leen also had on hand, rather
to her surprise, were her brother and
Shaa’s sister, along with the freshly
extracted Tarfon. The surprising part
was that for once in all this business
someone had decided not to go rushing
madly about, but to wait and assess
the lie of the land ﬁrst. Of course, they
had had the run of the Archives, too,
and no Archivist around to slap their

hands.
Leen,
realizing futility when she
saw it, was also forced to give up on
the idea of rounding up every errant
browser who sidled away down an aisle
or into a side room to check out the
Archival materials stored therein. She
still felt like ﬁnding a reinforced wall
and bouncing her head off it repeatedly.
The Archives were her responsibility,
after all, having been handed over to
her care as the successor to the gen-
erations of Archivists who had come
before, and now she was the ﬁrst to
have betrayed her trust to this grave
an extent,
external events notwith-
standing. There just didn’t seem to be
anything more she could do.
The last days had been too much,
she realized.
She was drifting, in a
numb haze, a state that wasn’t helped
by the level of Arznaak’s punch she

had felt herself. People ﬂoated up and
wafted away, disconnected pieces of
incidents would register while others
had obviously slipped past without
notice.
She wasn’t quite comatose,
however.
She remembered how the
detective fellow - the one who was
apparently Byron - had bolstered his
claim to that identity by ﬁrst leading
her to the secret computer room, and
then by speaking to the display wall
in the language Max had haltingly at-
tempted, although pronounced in his
mouth ﬂuently and ﬂowingly, followed
by the room lighting up around them
from the sudden rush of glowing pic-
tures and overlapping blocks of text.
He had gazed at the images with
puzzlement, followed by a sudden rush
of comprehension. “I don’t know about
this,” he’d said, mostly to himself.
“You created all this?” Leen asked.

“You know how everything really works?
“More or less, I’m afraid.”
“Then isn’t there something simple
you can do? Some way to send the nas-
ties to Zinarctica or something?”
“It’s an interesting thought,” he’d
said. “No, unfortunately things never
work that way when you’d like them
to. Let me see if I can get a handle on
how bad the mess is, and whether I
can come up with any mechanisms of
action that still might work.”
Then he had sent her away, and in
some manner barred the door from
within, to the great frustration and
consternation of those who had been
clustered around the entrance waiting
to force their own way down the stairs.
Particularly and to no one’s surprise,
Max. “Maximillian,” she had told him,
“we desperately need to have a talk.”
But then the next time she looked he

had gone off to work on the defenses,
or something, and in any case she was
scarcely well-constituted at the mo-
ment to discuss anything as serious as
her and Max with anyone as slippery
as Max, anyway.
It was with some surprise sometime
later to walk by the area she had set
aside for their dispensary and realize
she was seeing new and unfamiliar
faces.
The one sprawled on the ﬂoor
with the general pallor and overall
ill-used look so many of them bore,
she was told, was the Great Karlini,
while the reclining fellow arguing with
him and quafﬁng from a foaming mug
fresh from the sack of supplies he had
dragged down the stairs was known,
improbably enough, as the Lion of the
Oolvaan Plain.
No, the former Lion;
fancy that.
What a group.

Their conversation was not without
interest, though. “When I ﬁnd out who
is responsible for all this,” the former
Lion was saying, “I will slice them up
in little ribbons.”
Karlini’s voice was thin but had a
tendency to fade even further in spots,
and his lolling eyes, when their lids
opened, were shot through with red.
“Well, let’s see. There’s Arznaak, that’s
obvious enough, but it’s clearly a sim-
pliﬁcation to say the responsibility was
his alone. If it weren’t for Max, say, and
his ongoing plots and stratagems, Arz-
naak would have had to do things in
an entirely different way; Maximillian
gave Arznaak his major opening, shall
we say.
And then there’s Arznaak’s
brother - he could have killed Arznaak
when he was little, before any of them
knew what a scapula was. That would
have saved everybody some trouble,

you can bet. Roni - can’t forget Roni.
Without her irresponsible experimen-
tation things would have gone so far
and no further, right?
But as long
as we’re talking irresponsible experi-
ments, there’s Byron, or the Creeping
Sword or whoever he is - I guess you’d
have to say he’s responsible because he
helped start the whole system of the
gods in the ﬁrst place.
“And we haven’t even started in on
the gods themselves.
Gashanatantra
with his plots - well, if he hadn’t had
the plan to trap Pod Dall in the ring,
the wheel would have never gotten
rolling, and Arznaak would never have
had the essential step up from us-
ing the ring’s power to smite Jardin.
Jardin, Jill-tang, Vladimir the Storm
Lord and his tool Fradjikan - you want
me to go on? Can’t forget you, either. If
you hadn’t ruined the alliance between

us and the Hand we might have been
able to head off Arznaak before his
master stroke. Right?”
“You mean there’s no one person re-
sponsible? Everyone is responsible - in-
cluding me?”
“Why don’t we just say there’s plenty
of blame to go around,” said Karlini.
“I like to have someone to blame,”
the Lion said ominously.
Karlini might have shrugged, or it
might have been only another spasm.
“What can you do? You want somebody
to blame? If it’ll make you feel better
just pick someone; there’s plenty of sus-
pects around. Why not pick - why not
pick him!” And suddenly Karlini was
on his feet, his eyes open and glaring,
his arms reaching forward like hooks,
as ahead of them at the end of the aisle,
fresh from his session with his oracle,
appeared Byron.

“You!” said the Great Karlini.
In
an instant, all awareness of whatever
he’d been talking about and the peo-
ple around him and the situation still
evolving outside seemed to slip from
him, as he came off the ﬂoor with his
hands clawing up in what was clearly
about to be a mad attack aimed at
separating me from whatever lives I
still possessed. When I had seen him
down the aisle after emerging from the
computer room I had realized this was
not necessarily the smartest thing I
could have done, to have confronted
him directly without ﬁrst preparing
the ground by dispatching an emissary
or making certain he was ﬁrmly immo-
bilized, but on the other hand I rather
thought facing up to actions to whose
responsibility I had fallen heir was
an appropriately self-abasing move,
in the wake of so much trickery and

deception.
Of course, that didn’t mean I had
to just sit back and let him take me
apart, either, and I did have news that
might somewhat mitigate the nastiest
of the things he had to hold against
me. I opened my mouth to speak, but
the sword got there ﬁrst.
“Karlini!”
it said, as usual in my mind but also,
it was reasonable to suppose, in his
as well. And even proceeding directly
to the brain as the utterance did, the
“sound” of the voice was one that was
thoroughly familiar to him.
“What did you say?” Karlini spat. “It
wasn’t enough you murdered her, now
you have to play games with me as -”
“I’m not dead, dear,” said the sword,
at the same moment as I said “She’s
not dead, Karlini!” out loud. “Not ex-
actly, at any rate,” the sword added.
Karlini’s mouth moved but no sound

came out. Then, “Roni?” he squawked,
trying again.
“You’re in his sword?
What are you doing in there?”
“Taking a vacation,” said the sword.
Karlini, in his agitated state, prob-
ably missed it, but to me that re-
mark had sounded less of offhand ﬂip-
pancy than might have been expected.
“That’s great!” said Karlini, teetering
on his feet again with the look of some-
one about to fall on his backside on the
ground. His voice had the character of
someone getting intoxicated as quickly
as possible on whatever was available;
air, in this case. His eyes were glazing.
“That’s great!
- all we have to do is
build you a new body-”
“Cloning may be a possibility,” I in-
serted, in an undertone.
“- a new body, I know you wouldn’t
want to take over somebody else’s, so a
new body, and then we pry you out of

the sword, and, and -”
“I am taking,” the sword repeated,
more ﬁrmly, “a vacation. I ﬁnd I rather
like it in here. It is surprisingly peace-
ful, being separated from one’s auto-
nomic nervous system.”
“Not to mention adrenal hormones,”
Shaa murmured.
I hadn’t seen him
edge up, but he had evidently included
himself in the sword’s conversational
range as well.
“But -” said Karlini.
“But -” His
arms were waving in front of him now,
no longer in readiness for attack, but
as though he was trying to ﬁgure out
how one went about hugging a sword
or throwing oneself at its feet. I was
used to it by now, but of course the
sword was ﬂaming, too, albeit a bit less
ﬂamboyantly than when the Monoch
personality had been the only active
tenant, and was exerting its habitual

torque on my wrist.
“Here,” I told Karlini.
“The two of
you work this out.” I thrust the sword
- calling it Monoch didn’t seem either
appropriate or accurate anymore - to-
ward him, presenting the hilt for him
to grasp. When he had done this, and
had been ﬂung to the ground on his
side as the sword’s bucking-bronco
heft typically tried to establish who
was boss, I moved quickly back out of
range.
Shaa, never to be one to ignore the
actions of others when they smacked of
prudence through foreknowledge, had
retreated with me. “So,” he said. “What
do you think?”
“About the Karlinis? I wouldn’t be-
gin to guess. As far as I know I still
have never been married.”
“Actually,” said Shaa, “while that
matter is clearly of more than passing

interest, I was primarily wondering
about the state of the world outside.”
“Well,” I said.
“For anyone fond of
the old order, or of civic order in gen-
eral I suppose, the situation is fairly
apocalyptic.
I wouldn’t venture to
guess at casualty ﬁgures, and in any
case it would have to be a guess since
the Scapula’s pulse and the stuff that’s
breeding as a result have pretty much
demolished any hope of decent com-
munications. It looks like most of the
gods are gone, and most of the high-
level magic users are gone, and things
magical are just generally out of con-
trol, but a lot of that I imagine will die
down over the next few days or weeks.
Of course, there’s fallout - a bunch
of potion discharges that seem to be
raining sorcerously active byproducts
, some really substantial explosions in
the army weaponry stores, free phan-

tasms and toxic specters wandering
the streets - but the big one is what’s
loose from the Karlini lab, of course.”
A
general
hubbub
broke
out
at
that.
Before things degenerated into
a morass of told-you-so’s, however, I
raised my voice to try to override them
all and keep them focussed.
“Yes,” I
hollered, “it looks like an out-and-out
plague, but leave the recriminations
for later, okay?
There’s already an
outbreak of transﬁguration in Blind
Park just downwind, folks bursting
into ﬂame or melting into goo, strange
discharges -”
“Then why are you here talking?”
shouted the former Lion. “Why aren’t
you stopping this horror?”
“It’s like this,” I told them all. “There’s
not much I can do. There’s not much
anyone can do, things are just too out
of hand, actuation paths are blitzed

and energy levels are scrambled and
frankly, most anything you’d try would
have at least a good of chance of feed-
ing the ﬁre as snufﬁng it out, you see?
As it happens, there are a few addi-
tional tricks I could try, but at this
stage of the game, after everything
that’s already gone on, I’m a little
reluctant to take unilateral action.”
Again, I thought. “So I thought I’d see
if anyone in the group had any ideas
on the subject ﬁrst.”
“What sort of tricks are you dis-
cussing here?” Shaa asked.
“The magic cell-constituents Roni
rediscovered were built with a suicide
gene.
They may not all still possess
it - there’s been a good lot of evolution
going on, so there’s no way of telling
without pinning one of them down long
enough to run it through a sequencer
- and her reengineered free organisms

that are making up the goo out there
have likely had it bred out of them too.
But setting loose the trigger might be
worth a try. Of course, it would mean
a lot of other casualties. Some folks ex-
press the magic genes more centrally
than others.”
“I,” said Haddo, who I now saw had
been lurking off in the shadows behind
a pile of books. “And he,” Haddo added,
pointing at Wroclaw.
“Quite likely,” I agreed.
“Activat-
ing the suicide trigger could be tanta-
mount to genocide.
There are some
other possibilities for things to do -
there’s retroviruses out in the popu-
lation that are inactive now but have
their own trigger cofacters. They’d tar-
get the conversion cascade that powers
the effectors.
Might be safer, might
take longer, might not work as well; no
way to tell in advance. And there’s -”

The Great Karlini had regained his
feet again by dint of plastering the
sword against his chest with both arms
entwined around it. I may have missed
my guess, but I had a feeling whatever
was left of Ronibet Karlini had not
been telling him things to which he
particularly wanted to listen. “I don’t
want to hear any more about this,” he
snapped in my direction. “As far as I’m
concerned it’s the end of history.
We
won and that’s that.”
Shaa gazed after him as he wobbled
away. “The Great one, in his way, just
as Maximillian, in his way, has always
been a creature of habit,” murmured
Shaa.
“Now just a damn minute -” started
Max.
“Creatures of their times,” Shaa con-
tinued, with an arch glare toward his
associate, “to a much greater extent

than either would acknowledge,
or
perhaps even realize.” He raised an
eyebrow in my direction. “Such a new
world order as confronts us now will
demand adjustments many will not be
able to meet.”
“Huh,” I said. “So are you telling me
you, an old aristocrat, don’t want to
step in and be Emperor?”
“Emperor is not a job I would have
coveted at any stage,” Shaa said thought
fully.
“Now, with no central bureau-
cracy, not much in the way of living
leadership, except possibly for the Em-
peror himself, no functional effectors,
and the governing legitimacy rather
much tattered, the ofﬁce seems well
on its way to marginalization, if it
survives the decade. Is that why you
brought it up?”
“No, not really. But describing the
situation as a new world order may not

be far wrong. Whatever we do or don’t
do, things are never going to be the
way they were, and there’s no telling
what the world will end up with. The
only thing that seems certain is death
and devastation. If I don’t do a thing,
that goo of Roni’s is gonna keep spread-
ing and infecting folks and chewing on
them and making more of itself. If we
try to ﬁght it by trying to shut down
the system that still might happen,
and even if it didn’t there’d be plenty
of casualties anyway, plus the loss of a
magic as a tool the way we now know
it.”
“You do paint rather an egalitarian
picture,” Shaa remarked, “if indeed the
old hegemonic order is gone for good.
In some ways magic won’t count for as
much, in some ways it will likely count
for more.”
“Through
democratization?”
said

Phlinn Arol.
“Gods and people and
bacteria all placed on the same playing
ﬁeld together?”
“Yeah,” I said, “but also because any
given magic user’s gonna be a lot less
powerful with the network gone and
the damage the Scapula did still rat-
tling around. There’ll be more chance
the stuff’ll backﬁre and blow your hand
off. And with all these environmental
toxic hazards roaming around, leaving
whatever they don’t kill transformed...
Well, there’s gonna be a lot fewer folks
around to talk about it.”
“It’s a new Dislocation,” said Leen
dully.
“Probably not an exaggeration.” I
eyed the two gods - or former gods -
here at hand.
“One thing will never
change, though, and that’s power by
itself, just plain power.
With all the
holes left in the power structure it’s go-

ing to be a interesting next generation
or two.”
“Yes, well,” Shaa said, “setting pos-
terity aside for the moment, there is
the matter in which you would like
to make us all complicit.
We have
among us representatives of the most
hidebound elements of the status quo
as well as the extreme radical avant-
garde. Everyone here stands to suffer
from the activist intervention you put
forth before us, some to the risk of ex-
tinction. For all the talk of gods, what
we are discussing here is in fact the
very deﬁnition of a god-level decision.
On the one hand we have a world of
chaos, on the other chaos redoubled.
So how do you propose to achieve con-
sensus? And what is the point? One
plague or another, stroke or counter-
stroke, world without end, yes?
For
one way or the other the world will not

actually, or entirely, end; even if the
roof suddenly collapsed and we all died
now, the story would still manage to
continue. Or from another standpoint,
this is as good a stage as any to declare
the existing story is over. Yes?”
“Hold
it
right
there!”
said
Max.
“You’re talking like the issue’s already
been decided.
What happened to
the ﬁghting spirit?
Who says Roni’s
goo can’t be contained?
The thing
to do is get out there and do some-
thing about it, not stand around dis-
cussing hypotheticals.
And who says
Arznaak’s
worked
some
permanent
change either?
Even if the system’s
been damaged I’m sure something can
be patched back together.
One thing
that sure hasn’t changed - you’re a god,
and you’re trying to exert your domi-
nation over the rest of us the way you
gods always have. Change - hah!”

“You’re welcome to your opinion,” I
told him. “You’re free to do what you
want, though, regardless of what you
might think. The last thing I want to
do is dominate anyone. The way I see
it the world’s different already; things
are out of the bottle and the bottle’s
been smashed, but that’s only my opin-
ion. If I wanted to enforce my opinion
I’d be in the back pulling strings and
stuff.”
“I don’t trust you,” muttered Max.
“So go out and see for yourself,” I
said. “Or make some proposal here.”
“All right,” said Max. “I will see for
myself. Anybody coming with me?”
“I might be able to help you ﬁght,”
volunteered Jurtan Mont.
“That’s the spirit, kid,” said Max.
“You would trust my son with this?”
said the Lion. “Not without me around.
I’ll -”

Shaa caught my eye and crooked
a thumb backward over his shoulder.
I eased away from the group and fol-
lowed his own light-footed tread.
“It
continues, or begins anew,” commented
Shaa, as the clamor of the gang be-
hind us continued unabated. “Still, I
submit the greatest hazard is having
the world become an unbroken plain
of gray goo. My suggestion would be
to release whatever agents might effec-
tively detour that outcome.”
Phlinn Arol and Gashanatantra had
joined us. “Are all the options quite as
draconian as you made them out just
now?” said Gashanatantra.
“Well...” I said.
“Maybe not.
If we
could analyze a sample of the goo from
the lab, maybe there’s some feature we
could target directly. No miracles, you
understand, but could be something to
try short of full scale scorched earth.”

“If it’s all the same to you,” stated
Shaa, “personally speaking I would
rather not be the proximate cause of
death to thousands and eradication
of races.
My medical training, you
understand.”
I sighed. “Oh, all right.” For all my
efforts to get the world to move on past
me, to wash my hands of this and all
messes, I could already see myself get-
ting dragged back in, the miasma of
past transgressions notwithstanding.
“Come back here and let’s see what we
can set up.”

Epilogue
SO, ANYWAY, THAT’S THE PART
I SAW, or had some level of direct in-
volvement with. I don’t pretend to be
the last word on the matter. If you’re
interested in what happened you’ll
have no shortage of folks chewing over
it for years, down to the least person
present at the Stadium of State for the
Knitting or brushed by the Scapula’s
burst of magic, and after anyone who
has any claim to personal connection
has gone by the wayside there’ll be the
historians to contend with... but what’s
new? Talking about current events is
always tricky. No matter how much lip
service you give to the ideal of objec-
tivity, if you’ve been there or had some
stake - whether personal or philosoph-
ical or whatever - you’re automatically
shading the facts; the more you think

you’re not, the more so the ﬁrst listener
you’re twisting the evidence on is you.
Still, there’s something to be said
for setting out reminiscences while
things are fresh, not to mention the
consideration that it’s traditional. Of
course, there’s not exactly a mass mar-
ket these days for memoirs, although I
could probably aggravate quite a num-
ber of people I know by having high-
lights distributed on those wall-sized
broadsheet things, or even commission-
ing criers to do public declamations
in the squares.
But when those his-
torians start sharpening their fangs,
it’s primary sources they like to chew
through ﬁrst. So here I am.
I’ve been using the modern-day ver-
nacular for my narration, rather than
one of those stuffy old scholars’ cants
that sounded like vernacular when I
was growing up but are extinct as the

platypus now. I wouldn’t turn up my
nose at the prospect of wide readership,
but even if this tome’s only destination
is a back shelf in the Archives there’s
no point in shoving more stumbling-
blocks under its feet than it’s apt to
encounter anyway.
The potential au-
dience might be reduced somewhat if
it was necessary to learn a defunct
language before you could start on the
ﬁrst page, a language with few native
speakers and no teachers or texts to
boot.
The downside of writing so it could
actually be read, however, has been
coping with criticism as I’ve plowed
through the pages.
Hopefully I’ll get
this little codicil down before Shaa
shows up again. He’s appointed him-
self Guardian of Internal Logic and
Skeptic-at-Large, and has been spend-
ing far too much time skulking behind

my shoulder as I’ve slogged through
the tale. Not that he hasn’t been a help
in places, and at least someone’s been
interested enough to hang around,
and he has been a seemingly objective
correspondent for material I wasn’t
actually present to witness myself (al-
though I’ve been careful to crosscheck
him against the monitoring data down-
loaded to the Archives before Arznaak
crashed the system to hell-and-gone,
apparently for good).
Still, Shaa’s been a fairly severe
editor, too, and even if I locked the
door on him I’d know he’d be sitting
outside it nagging the air.
I hadn’t
wanted an editor, but with his way of
undermining conﬁdence through the
drawn-out silence or the disapproving
droop in the corner of his lip or the dis-
appointed “hmph!”, he’d wormed his
way into my psyche so badly I could

hear him carping even when he wasn’t
around.
I know what he’d say about
this epilogue - if he gets hold of it it’ll
be the void for it for sure - but I ﬁg-
ure if going on at such length about
all these shenanigans wasn’t indul-
gence enough, a little farewell capper
wouldn’t be out of place.
And after
all, the heaviest labor Shaa’s had is
reading - I’ve been the one doing the
legwork.
Not that anyone’s just had time
to lean back and tinker with mem-
oirs.
Even without activating the
retroviruses magic is still in general
collapse. I’ll give Shaa’s brother this;
when he launches a blight there were
no half-measures concerned.
As far
away as there’s been communication,
reports are still coming in of infectious
transﬁgurations and goo-melts,
tar-
geted weapons and countermeasures

notwithstanding. A status quo of strife
and struggle appears unavoidable.
Not that the players seem to have
learned much, either. Max is still out
there scheming and planning, back to
the trough after his own recent tribu-
lations, and if anyone knows when
he and Leen are going to decide what
they’re doing about each other it sure
isn’t me. Maybe we’re all too far gone
to change our ways. Like I said before,
I’ll leave it to others more removed to
say what really happened.
I thought of dating this thing Year
One of the Twilight of the Gods, but
that was far too pretentious and over-
bearing even for me, much less the
editorial eye of the mighty Shaa.
I’d
been there; it had been clear that a
random walk of steps from many inde-
pendent feet and no little dose of fate or
blind chance, depending on your turn

of phrase, had led here; it would be left
to those teeth-sharpening historians
to put things in order and ﬁght over
the meaning of events and ﬁgure out
after we were all gone what we were
really all about. So, ﬁnally, all I could
do was stab toward honesty, whatever
its limitations, and sign these -
The Memoirs of Byron, with Inter-
polations in Divers Voices, of Recent
Events of Interest
- and then I stood up from the key-
board and went out to get back to my
life.
