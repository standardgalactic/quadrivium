About the Authors
Danna Korn is also the author of Living Gluten-Free For Dummies, Wheat-Free,
Worry-Free: The Art of Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Living, and Kids with Celiac
Disease: A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy Gluten-Free Children.
Respected as one of the leading authorities on the gluten-free diet and the
medical conditions that benefit from it, she speaks frequently to health care
professionals, celiacs, parents of celiacs, parents of autistic kids involved in a
gluten-free/casein-free dietary intervention program, and others on or consid-
ering a gluten-free diet. She has been invited twice to be a presenter at the
International Symposium on Celiac Disease.
Danna has been researching celiac disease since her son, Tyler, was diag-
nosed with the condition in 1991. That same year, she founded R.O.C.K.
(Raising Our Celiac Kids), a support group for families of children on a gluten-
free diet. Today, Danna leads more than 100 chapters of R.O.C.K. worldwide.
She is a consultant to retailers, manufacturers, testing companies, dietitians,
nutritionists, and people newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance and celiac
disease. She also coordinates the International Walk/Run for Celiac Disease
each May in San Diego.
Connie Sarros is a pioneer in writing gluten-free cookbooks for celiacs, begin-
ning at a time when few people had even heard of the disease. She has writ-
ten five cookbooks, a “Newly Diagnosed Survivial Kit,” and made a DVD that
covers all you need to know about gluten-free cooking. She writes weekly
menus for people with additional dietary restrictions and puts out two
monthly newsletters. Connie is also a staff writer for other celiac newsletters,
including having a monthly “Ask the Cook” column. 
In addition to being a featured speaker at national celiac conferences, Connie
travels the country speaking to celiac and austistic support groups and often
meets with dietitians to explain the gluten-free diet.

Authors’ Acknowledgements
Danna Korn
Books are interesting. Authors get all the glory; publishers get all the money;
and everyone in between gets forgotten! Well, let it be noted that I haven’t
forgotten anyone who has made this and my other books possible, starting
first and foremost with my family.
After I finished my first book, I swore I’d never do another. And I made -- 
and broke -- that promise three more times. It’s with an immense amount of
gratitude that I applaud my kids, who understand that they are my highest
priorities, even when I have to bury myself in front of a computer for hours
on deadline. To Tyler, who is the reason I felt compelled to help others after 
I found myself treading in the deep end of the gluten-free pool so many years
ago -- and to Kelsie, my constant source of optimism and inspiration -- both of
you fill me with so much pride and joy, and your love and support is truly my
greatest motivator. Bryan, not only are you the love of my life, but you never
let me give up on this book (or anything else), in spite of what seemed to be
insurmountable obstacles this past year.
Without Connie Sarros, a Real Cookbook Author, this book would be little
more than zany concoctions that I made up. So thank you, Connie, not only
for adding substance and validity to this real cookbook, but for your personal
touches that helped make this so much more than just a book of recipes.
I’d like to offer a huge thank you to the amazing team at Wiley Publishing,
starting with Mike Lewis, acquisitions editor, who got this book rolling. To
senior project editor Tim Gallan, who also edited Living Gluten-Free For
Dummies, thank you for bearing with me on yet another For Dummies book,
and for your attention to detail and keeping me on track. To both Tim and
Vicki Adang, copy editor, thank you for putting up with my retuvenantly
quirky sense of humor and the overabundance of made-up words. 
Connie Sarros
In January, 2007, I received a phone call from Danna Korn asking if I would
like to create recipes for a new book, Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies. From
my heart, I thank Danna for this opportunity and for the confidence she had
in me. I would be remiss if I didn’t also thank her for her patience and guid-
ance throughout this entire venture. She is absolutely amazing!

I am still awed that Wiley Publishing chose me to assist Danna with a For
Dummies book. I am sincerely thankful to the publisher and especially to our
editors, Mike Lewis, Tim Gallan, and Vicki Adang for their help and assistance
throughout each phase of the book.  
None of my six books would have been written at all if it hadn’t been for my
father, a celiac, who truly delighted in eating good food. And my dear husband:
He has been so patient and understanding as, night after night, he would be
my official taste-tester. Some nights we had feasts; other nights my good
intentions would end up in the disposal and he would smile as he settled for
eggs or a cup of soup. The support of my family has been unwavering.
A less obvious “thanks” is extended to the celiacs in the support groups
across the nation. Your feedback and your shared stories gave me the needed
encouragement to continue to stretch myself, creating new recipes to respond
to your expressed needs. My part in the writing of this book would not have
been possible without your confidence and support throughout the years.

Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies

Introduction
W
hen I was asked to write Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies, I panicked.
Sure, I know plenty about the gluten-free lifestyle — I’ve been living
(and loving) it since 1991, and am proud to frequently be referred to as “The
Gluten-Free Guru.” I had already written Living Gluten-Free For Dummies, so 
I was familiar with the format of a For Dummies book. So why the panic?
Because although I love to cook, I’m a little — ahem — unconventional in 
my methods. Take measuring, for example. I don’t. Oh, and recipes? Nope. 
I usually can’t get past the list of ingredients before going my own way and
modifying the recipe to suit my needs.
My ideas for recipes in this book went something like this: “Take a bunch 
of chicken and sauté it in butter.” (Oops — forgot to tell you to cut it and heat
the butter — you should have known that.) “Add a dab of whatever spices
sound good to you at the moment — maybe a few globs of diced tomatoes
and some veggies. When it’s done, put it on the gluten-free rice noodles” (that
I forgot to tell you to prepare in advance). “Voilá! You have chicken stir-fry on
noodles!” That didn’t go over too well.
So this book offers you a compromise. I believe in helping people figure out
how to make anything gluten-free — without recipes, complicated terms, or
ingredients you’ll have to fly to Paris to purchase. Chapter 7 shows you how
to do that using simple substitutions that you probably already have on hand.
And for those of you Real Cooks who love recipes, we have Real Recipes 
written by Real Cookbook Author Connie Sarros. Connie specializes in gluten-
free cooking, and her recipes are easy to follow and absolutely amazing. She
tends to emphasize good nutrition, which also is a passion of mine, and she
introduces unique ingredients that are nutritious, delicious, and offer diverse
flavors and consistencies.
Although this book focuses on cooking gluten-free, it also touches on medical
conditions that benefit from a gluten-free lifestyle, nutritional considerations,
and other practical questions and issues that you may face being gluten-free.
This, though, isn’t as much about lifestyle as it is about cooking. If you’re
interested in knowing more about living (and loving) the gluten-free lifestyle,
read Living Gluten-Free For Dummies (Wiley).

Written in the easy-to-follow-and-incredibly-comprehensive For Dummies
style, this book is the reference guide you need to help you create incredible
gluten-free delights.
About This Book
If you’ve ever read a For Dummies book (did we mention Living Gluten-Free
For Dummies?!?), you know they’re divided into parts and chapters. Although
the editors and we authors work hard to make them flow nicely from begin-
ning to end, they’re written so you can skip around if you’d like. If you get
bored reading about nutrition, you can skip to shopping — or you can just
dig into the recipes if you’d like.
If you’re new to gluten-free cooking, I suggest you read the book in order.
There are considerations that you’ll want to know about for gluten-free cook-
ing that don’t relate to regular cooking, such as cross-contamination. To
ensure you’re making a safe gluten-free meal, make sure you read Chapter 5
before you start cooking.
Chapter 1 provides an overview of the book, so if you read nothing else, you
can at least have an intelligent conversation about gluten-free cooking at the
next party you attend. And by golly, won’t you be the life of the party!
For those of you who’ve been cooking gluten-free for years, you’re probably
just dying to dig in and try Connie’s amazing recipes. I encourage you to do
so, but remember that rules have changed and some things that used to be
off-limits on the gluten-free diet no longer are. You may want to take a look at
Chapter 3 to see if something you’ve been avoiding is now considered safe.
By the way, I should mention that the recipes in this book have been tested
by the publisher’s professional recipe tester, so I’m pretty sure they all work
as intended.
Conventions Used in This Book
For Dummies books are known for having consistent ground rules and 
conventions. Some of those used in this book include
 Made-up words are just part of my vocabulary — you’ll get used to it,
and they’re not hard to figure out. For instance, a glutenivore is someone
who eats gluten; glutenated means a product has been contaminated
with gluten. Glutenilicious is a scrumptious gluten-free meal, and 
glutenologism is a made-up word having to do with gluten!
2
Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies 

 When I refer to ingredients throughout this book, you can assume I’m
referring to the gluten-free version. Soy sauce, for example — I don’t 
say “gluten-free soy sauce” in the ingredients list. You can assume you
should use a gluten-free version (please, do I really need to say that?!?).
T Recipes are designated as vegetarian by using a little tomato icon.
 Nutritional facts accompany all the recipes and are based on the actual
ingredients found as the recipes appear in this book. If you make 
substitutions, the facts may not be valid.
 Speaking of substitutions, feel free to make them. Chapter 7 offers lots 
of ideas for being creative when creating your concoctions.
 A mixture of gluten-free flours works best when baking. Check out
Chapter 8 for a gluten-free flour recipe and advice for storing and using
gluten-free flour.
 Milk substitutes can be used in place of milk in most recipes (hence the
clever name milk “substitute”).
 Unless otherwise noted, all eggs are large.
 Butter and margarine are interchangeable.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit.
 When a recipe calls for salt and/or pepper, use regular table salt and
freshly ground black pepper.
 We use 90 percent lean ground beef when a recipe requires that old
standby. It tastes good, has the right amount of fat for our purposes, 
and isn’t hard on the budget.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
And follow these tips to help ensure your recipes come out tasting 
scrumptious:
 Read through the recipe from start to finish before you begin cooking.
That way, you’ll know what tools and pans you need, what ingredients 
to set on the counter, how the steps progress, and how much time 
you’ll need.
 Preheat ovens and broilers at least 15 minutes before you slide the 
dish in.
What You’re Not to Read
Well first of all, I’m impressed that you’re reading this. This is the
Introduction, folks! Aren’t you just dying to dig into the good stuff?!? Because
you’re an introduction reader, you’re likely to read all the stuff you don’t need
to read, but if you want to skip something, feel free to skip the following:
3
Introduction

 Sidebars: Sidebars are extra bits of information you’ll find in shaded
boxes throughout the chapters. I think they’re sometimes more 
interesting than the chapters themselves, but you’re welcome to skip
them if you’d like.
 The Introduction: Too late. You really didn’t need to read it, though.
Foolish Assumptions
When we author types sit down to write a book, we make a bunch of assump-
tions about our readers — at the same time, you make assumptions about
the author. Here are some assumptions I’ve made about you:
 You’re interested in gluten-free cooking (that one was easy).
 You’re interested because you’ve been diagnosed with a condition 
that requires a gluten-free diet, you’re cooking for someone who’s been
diagnosed with a condition that requires a gluten-free diet, or you’re
interested in being gluten-free for personal interest or health reasons.
 You’re most likely interested in the recipes, but you may also be inter-
ested in nutrition, knowing how to make your kitchen as safe as possible
for cooking gluten-free foods, and cooking any food gluten-free without
the aid of recipes.
 You’re either a newbie and know very little about the gluten-free diet, or
you’ve been at this for a while and are looking for new ideas. Either way,
I’ve got you covered.
Likewise, while I’ve made assumptions about you, you can make a couple of
assumptions about me and what you’ll read in this book:
 I’m an expert on the gluten-free diet, and am known to many as “The
Gluten-Free Guru.” I’ve been researching the gluten-free lifestyle since
1991 when my son was diagnosed with celiac disease. With absolutely
no resources available to me, I set out to learn everything I can — 
and to help others live and love the lifestyle.
 Unlike many authors of gluten-free cookbooks or resource materials, 
I do live the lifestyle. Granted, I didn’t go gluten-free back in ’91 when my
son was diagnosed with celiac disease; I didn’t “see the light” until 2002
when I was writing my second book and realized gluten isn’t good for
anyone. I’ve been gluten-free ever since.
 Connie, author of the recipes in this book, is gluten-free as well. She’s
the author of several gluten-free cookbooks and is a sought-after
speaker, as well.

Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies 

 Although this book is loaded with lots of great information about the
medical conditions that benefit from a gluten-free diet, it’s not intended
to serve as medical advice. See your health-care professional for further
guidance if you feel you need it.
How This Book Is Organized
Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies is easy to navigate. All the parts that 
should go together do. The book starts out with general information about
the gluten-free diet and medical conditions that it benefits; it’s an overview 
of why you might be gluten-free or consider going gluten-free. From there, 
it gets into preparing to cook, which leads to the recipes. Gluten-Free Cooking
For Dummies wraps up with the Part of Tens, familiar favorites in all For
Dummies books.
Here’s how the four parts break down:
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free
Cooking Adventures
The seven chapters in this part encompass everything but the recipes.
Chapter 1 is really a brief overview of the entire book, without redundancy in
reference to later chapters. The next six chapters talk about what is and isn’t
gluten-free, nutrition, shopping, setting up your kitchen, and figuring out how
to cook anything gluten-free — without recipes.
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses
Part II dives right in, with recipes for main courses served up by Connie. With
an emphasis on nutrition and unique ingredients, Connie’s recipes are easy 
to follow, yet absolutely amazing.
Part III: Dishes to Enjoy Before, 
After, or Any Time
In this part, you’ll find recipes for appetizers, salads, soups, and snacks.
Desserts and baked goods round out this part, with decadent and delicious
dishes you’d never guess were gluten-free.
5
Introduction

Part IV: The Part of Tens
Without the Part of Tens, a For Dummies book is a For Dum — it’s not 
finished. All For Dummies books finish with a Part of Tens, which in this book
consists of two chapters, each with (get this) ten tips or ideas relating to
gluten-free cooking. You’ll find one chapter with suggestions for gluten-free
comfort foods, and another with ideas for cooking gluten-free with the kids.
Icons Used in This Book
Like all For Dummies books, this book has icons to call out tidbits of informa-
tion. Here’s what the icons mean:
Can you guess what the Tip icon is for? Yep — it’s for calling out tips that will
help you with your gluten-free cooking.
You’ll find friendly reminders throughout this book, marked with a Remember
icon that looks like this. These are pieces of information that are important
enough to have you make note of.
Text flagged with this icon can keep you out of cooking-related or diet-related
trouble.
Where to Go from Here
Where to go from here is completely up to you. Like any For Dummies book,
you can skip around if you’d like. You may want to curl up in a snuggly chair
and read the first part for background information, or you may want to grab
your apron (do people still wear those?) and dive into the recipes for some
gluten-free cookin’, good lookin’!

Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies 

Part I
Preparing for Your
Gluten-Free
Cooking Adventures

In this part . . . 
You’re given all of the preliminary info you need about
gluten-free cooking before you dive in and try the
recipes. We cover what is and isn’t gluten-free, nutrition,
shopping, setting up your kitchen, and figuring out how 
to cook anything gluten-free even when you don’t have
recipes.

Chapter 1
Gluten-Free: Not Just 
a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Making long-term choices
 Getting the goods on gluten
I
f you’ve been eating gluten (technically and in DannaSpeak that would
make you a glutenivore) for a long time — like, oh, say, most of your life —
then giving up foods as you know them like bread, pasta, pizza, cookies,
crackers, and, yes, beer may seem like a tough transition at first.
You may be cooking gluten-free for one of the following reasons:
 You may have been diagnosed with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
 You may be cooking for someone who has been told he has to eliminate
gluten from his diet.
 You may have read the many reasons a gluten-free diet is healthier, and
you’ve decided to give it a try.
 You may have just found this book in the discount aisle of the bookstore
and wondered what it’s all about.
No matter why you’re cooking gluten-free, you’ll find that cooking gluten-free
is an art form, and one that sometimes takes a little retuvenation on your
part to figure out what is and isn’t allowed on the diet.

Did I say diet? Because this is really more than that — it’s a lifestyle. Sure, 
it’s a diet in the sense that it concerns the things you put in your mouth —
but for most people, choosing to be gluten-free is a long-term commitment,
and one that affects every aspect of their lives.
Making lifestyle changes requires conscious changes in your outlook on
eating. It requires long-term commitments and a great deal of education.
Starting with, “What is gluten, anyway?!?”
Defining Gluten in Layman’s Terms
There are a couple of ways to define gluten, and interestingly, the definitions
actually contradict each other a little bit.
One way to define it is the scientific definition, and it involves life-of-the-party
terminology like gliadin, secalin, hordein, and prolamins. This scientific 
definition further explains that gluten is found in all grains — yep, you heard
right. All grains. Rice. Corn. All of ’em. Yet we only eliminate wheat, rye, and
barley on the gluten-free diet. Well, that’s why there’s a layman’s definition.
The layman’s definition of gluten is “a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley.”
Although oats don’t contain gluten in and of themselves, we avoid them on
the gluten-free diet because of cross-contamination issues that may arise
during the production process.
So something that’s gluten-free, by definition, is wheat-free. But it doesn’t
necessarily hold true the other way around.
Wheat worries
Gluten-free means wheat-free, but wheat-free doesn’t necessarily mean
gluten-free.
Something can be wheat-free but still contain gluten if it has, for instance,
malt, which is usually derived from barley. In that case, the food would be
wheat-free but not gluten-free because barley contains gluten.
A lot of confusion is caused by labels claiming to be “wheat-free” when 
the products are not. Spelt and kamut are two examples. They’re definitely
not wheat-free (they’re actually forms of wheat), yet they’re commonly 
marketed as being wheat-free, or being wheat alternatives. Calling spelt a
10
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

wheat alternative is like calling me a human alternative. Last time I checked, 
I was a human, regardless of what some people might think; and spelt is,
regardless of what they call it, wheat. And because spelt and kamut are forms
of wheat, they are not gluten-free, no matter what the package says.
Common foods that contain gluten
Sometimes when I rattle off the foods that commonly contain gluten, people
stare at me as though I’ve just recited War and Peace or something. It’s true,
the list is long. Our society has become accustomed to eating gobs and gobs
of gluten; it’s the most prevalent food type by far.
You can find more detail on the foods and ingredients that are okay and 
those that aren’t in Chapter 3. As a general rule, anything with flour (white or
wheat) is a no-no when you’re avoiding gluten. These are some of the more
obvious offenders:
 Bagels
 Baked goods (cookies, cakes, brownies, and so on)
 Beer
 Bread
 Cereal
 Crackers
 Malt
 Pasta
 Pizza
 Pretzels
 Soy sauce
It’s important to note that there are not-so-obvious offenders, too, like natural
flavorings and licorice. So you’ll have to get comfortable reading labels, 
memorizing ingredients, and calling manufacturers to find out more details
about their ingredients. (Again, Chapter 3 can help you get started.)
Don’t be discouraged. Although the list may appear daunting at first, it’s
important to remember that the list of things you can eat on the gluten-free
diet is a lot longer than the list of things you can’t. Furthermore, for every
product in this list, there’s a delicious gluten-free substitution available. 
I talk more about specialty items and where you can find them in Chapter 6.
11
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free: Not Just a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle

Deciding Whether You 
Should Be Gluten-Free
In the chapter opening, I pointed out that being gluten-free is a lifestyle
change; that means dedication and commitment if you choose to adopt this
lifestyle. So why would you do it?
Many people who go gluten-free do so not because they have any of the 
conditions listed in this section, but because they’re striving for a healthier
lifestyle.
Connie and I believe gluten isn’t good for anyone (more on that in Chapter 2),
especially in the highly refined form that most people know, like bread, bagels,
and pasta. Cutting wheat and other gluten-containing grains out of your diet
certainly isn’t a bad thing and can have significant health benefits if you 
eat a wholesome, diverse diet. Heck, it can even be the key to maintaining
your weight!
Maybe you’ll find it compelling to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle when you 
realize that the gluten-free diet may relieve or even completely alleviate these
health problems (and more):
 Headaches (including migraines)
 Fatigue
 Gastrointestinal distress (including gas, bloating, diarrhea, 
constipation, reflux)
 Depression and anxiety
 Joint pain
 Infertility
 Autistic behaviors
 ADD/ADHD behaviors
Wipe that look off your face; I’ve seen it before. I rattle off all these things 
that a gluten-free diet can help with, and people give me that incredulous 
I’m-gonna-make-her-feel-stupid-now-and-catch-her-in-her-exaggeration look,
and they challenge me, “Reeeaaally? Allll those things can be helped with 
a gluten-free diet?” Yeah. Really.
This isn’t a diet du jour. I realize that new diets pop up faster than celebrity
babies with odd names, and that the diets last about as long as the celebrity
marriages do. This is a lifestyle. It’s a lifestyle that’s perfectly in sync with 
the way our bodies were designed to eat — and that’s why it’s so effective in
improving our health.
12
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Our bodies weren’t designed to eat that junk listed in the “Common foods
that contain gluten” section. Bagels? Cereal? Pasta? I don’t think so! Our
bodies can rebel against those foods in ways that can sometimes severely
compromise our health, and for many people, the gluten-free diet is the 
best — sometimes the only — treatment.
Chapter 2 explains more about gluten’s effect on the body. For extensive,
detailed information about the many medical conditions that benefit from 
a gluten-free diet, see the companion book to this one, Living Gluten-Free 
For Dummies (Wiley).
Doing Gluten-Free Nutritiously
As much as I preach about being gluten-free, I also urge people to eat a
healthy diet — and the two don’t always go together. I’m tempted to say
there’s the “right” way and the “wrong” way to do gluten-free, but that would
sound a tad opinionated (who, me?!?), so I’ll stick to calling them the healthy
and unhealthy ways (no opinionation there, right?).
The easiest way to do gluten-free is also the unhealthiest. I call it the Simple
Substitution method — you stroll through the aisles of your friendly health
food store and find product after product with cute little “gluten-free” logos
that make it oh-so-easy for you to identify those products as being safe on
your gluten-free diet! But being gluten-free doesn’t make it healthy. The fact
that those products are packaged and labeled generally makes them
unhealthy — albeit gluten-free.
The healthiest way to go is to stick to the “If man made it, don’t eat it” rule of
thumb. That means cutely labeled, processed foods aren’t gonna cut it. Don’t
get me wrong — there are some very nutritious packaged products out there.
I’m trying to generalize here, and from a bird’s-eye view, the healthiest way to
be gluten-free is to stick to natural, inherently gluten-free foods.
The healthiest way to eat is to follow the advice: If man made it, don’t eat it.
It’s pretty simple, really. Foods that fall into the “if man made it, don’t eat it”
allowable selections include lean meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruits, veggies,
nuts, and berries.
One pitfall people fall into when they go gluten-free is that they turn to rice,
corn, and potatoes. Those would seem healthy enough, and appear to pass
the “if man made it” criterion — but those foods really offer very little in the
way of nutritional value, and on top of it, they’re high glycemic index foods
that may make you pack on the pounds. (If you didn’t follow that high
glycemic index part, don’t worry — we talk about that more in Chapter 4.)

Chapter 1: Gluten-Free: Not Just a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle

I encourage you to explore unique gluten-free grains-that-aren’t-really-grains-
but-we-call-them-grains like quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and teff. They’re 
nutritional powerhouses loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein —
and they offer unique flavors and diverse consistencies. They’re a great break
from the rice, corn, and potatoes routine and pack a far more powerful nutri-
tional punch. Chapter 3 has a lot more details on these and other gluten-free
alternatives.
Getting Ready to Cook
Well, that’s it. You’re ready. You know why gluten-free’s the way to be, and
you’re either committed to the gluten-free lifestyle, cooking for someone who
is, or just toying with gluten-free recipes. Either way, enough chit-chat: It’s
time to get ready to cook!
“Getting ready to cook” means more than just donning your favorite apron,
especially when you’re cooking gluten-free. It usually involves a little planning,
some shopping, and preparation to make sure your gluten-free food stays
gluten-free.
The gluten-free lifestyle may be restricted, but it’s definitely not restrictive.
Figuring out what to buy 
and where to buy it
I highly recommend planning your meals in advance. Sometimes gluten-free
cooking requires ingredients you might not normally have on-hand, and you
don’t want to get halfway through a recipe to discover you don’t happen to
have any xanthan gum handy.
I also encourage you to experiment with unique, gluten-free alternatives such
as quinoa, millet, buckwheat, teff, sorghum, and wild rice (more on these 
in Chapter 3). They’re loaded with nutrition, and offer you the opportunity to
think outside your usual menu plan and add new flavors, consistencies, and
combinations.
Some of the unusual ingredients you may want to have on hand include 
xanthan gum (be prepared to sell one of your children to afford it), guar gum
(when you try it for the first time, don’t stray far from the potty because it
can cause — ahem — “gastrointestinal distress” in some people), and unique
flours like rice, tapioca, potato, and mesquite.

Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

You can buy these specialty items online or at health food or specialty stores,
co-ops, or farmers’ markets; we talk more about where to find these specialty
ingredients in Chapter 6.
Keep in mind that if you do gluten-free the healthiest way possible, you can
find all the ingredients you need in a regular grocery store — around the
perimeter. You’ll just be shopping for lean meats, poultry, fish, seafood, fruits,
veggies, nuts, and berries. You’ll be happy, healthy, gluten-free, and relieved
that you don’t have to track down tapioca starch at 10 p.m.
Setting up your kitchen
Thankfully, when you decide to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle, reorganizing and
setting up your kitchen is a one-time deal — and you’ll pick up some habits
that you’ll ease into nicely. Oh, and the oven really works in your kitchen!
Setting up your kitchen just means you have to think about cross-contamination.
Cross-contamination is when you accidentally glutenize your perfectly good
gluten-free meal because you toasted your gluten-free bread in a toaster that
has gluten-containing crumbs clinging on for dear life.
Crumbs can kill. Not literally, really, but they’re killer in a kitchen where
gluten-freebies share space with glutenators (people who eat gluten). Using
separate utensils for cooking, and even having a few separate appliances, 
is a good idea. Chapter 5 covers everything you need to know about readying
your kitchen and pantry for gluten-free cooking.
You don’t need completely separate utensils and pots and pans for your
gluten-free cooking. Washing thoroughly between preparations is fine for
removing gluten left over from cooking.
Wiping away crumbs between dish preparations is crucial, and you’ll find
that even the order in which you cook things is altered when you’re cooking
gluten-free. You don’t, for instance, want to fry a gluten-free grilled-cheese
sandwich in the same pan you just cooked a regular sandwich in unless you
thoroughly washed the skillet in between. (The easier solution is to cook the
gluten-free sandwich first.) You’ll get it; it’s not rocket science, but it is crucial
to keeping your kitchen as safe as it can be.
You may find it helpful to have a separate area in your pantry or kitchen to
keep gluten-free products. It makes them easier to find and reduces the
chances that someone’s going to goof.

Chapter 1: Gluten-Free: Not Just a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle

Cooking without Recipes (But You 
Can Use Them if You Like)
Connie and I believe if you give someone a recipe, you feed ’em for a meal.
Teach them to make anything gluten-free, and you feed ’em for a lifetime.
Okay, we kind of borrowed that concept from the Native American saying,
“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a meal. Teach him to fish and you
feed him for a lifetime,” but you probably figured that out.
The point is, you can make anything gluten-free, and you’re not constrained
by recipes or the fact that you can’t use regular flour or bread crumbs. You
only need a little creativity and some basic guidelines for using gluten-free
substitutions, which you’ll find in Chapter 7.
If you’re a die-hard recipe fan, never fear — we have them here. Real
Cookbook Author Connie spent months developing the amazing recipes for
this book. Most of them are super-simple to follow but leave your guests with
the impression that you spent all day in the kitchen (and being thusly
indebted, they’re expected to do the dishes).
But I’m not a Real Cookbook Author. I don’t “do” recipes. I’m more of a 
toss-it-in-and-see-how-it-tastes-then-modify-from-there type of cook. It stinks,
because I can never make the same dish twice. I don’t measure (who has the
patience?), I don’t ever have all of the specified ingredients on hand, nor do 
I know how to pronounce them or where I’d find them if I looked, and “proof-
ing” to me involves finding typos or errors in my writing (turns out, that’s a
bread term that means “to rise”). Suffice it to say that I’m no Julia Child, but 
I don’t have to be, and neither do you.
Connie and I believe that the most important element of cooking gluten-free
is to be creative and think outside the recipe box. So I hand you a pole and
say go forth and fish. May your gluten-free goodies be gastrolicious, and 
your fish be free of bones.
Getting Excited about the 
Gluten-Free Lifestyle
Most people who embark upon a gluten-free lifestyle are doing so because 
of health issues, and that means they have little or no choice in the matter.
When people are forced to make changes in their routine, especially changes
that affect what they can and can’t eat, they’re not always so quick to see 
the joy in the adjustments.
16
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

The truth is, we envision ourselves skipping merrily down a nicely paved road
of life, eating what we want when we want. We don’t envision ourselves having
to dodge cleverly disguised gluten-laden land mines scattered about like
worms after a hard rain (worms are gluten-free, in case you were wondering).
So if you’re a little less than — ahem — excited about being gluten-free, I
understand. But prepare yourself to have that frown turned upside down
because there are lots of reasons to be excited about the gluten-free lifestyle.
Gluten-free doesn’t mean flavor-free
People who are new to the concept of gluten-free sometimes comment that
the diet is boring. When I ask what they’re eating, their cuisine routine 
usually centers around bunny food and rice cakes. Well duh! Who wouldn’t 
be bored with that?!? That type of a diet is appalling, not appealing.
I’ll tell you right now I love food. I love the flavor, the feeling of being full, the
nutritional value it provides — most of all, I love to explore new foods I’ve
never tried before, as long as they’re gluten-free, of course. There’s no way 
I’d encourage you to endure a diet of blandiose foods that could double as
packing materials.
A healthy, gluten-free diet doesn’t have to be boring or restrictive. You’re not
constrained to eating 32 individual portions of fruits and vegetables each day,
like a rabbit nibbling nervously on carrots. If you enjoy bland foods, snaps for
you. But if you think gluten-free has to be flavor-free, you’re in for a pleasant
surprise.
Think about it. Spices are gluten-free. Onions, garlic, peppers, and other
flavor-enhancing foods are gluten-free. There’s really no need to languish
over lackluster flavors just because you’re enjoying the health benefits 
of being gluten-free. So slice, dice, and spice it up for a meal that’s flavorful,
not flavor-free.
Getting out and about
There’s no reason to let the gluten-free lifestyle hold you back from doing
anything you want to do. Well, okay, there are some things you can’t do —
like eat a Domino’s pizza and Krispy Kreme donuts. But as far as your 
activities and lifestyle are concerned, it’s important to get out and about 
as you always have.
17
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free: Not Just a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle

I realize that for the most part it’s not as easy as walking into a restaurant
and asking for the gluten-free menu (a girl can dream). But eating at restau-
rants is definitely doable; you just need to master the art of the special order
and tune in to contamination concerns. Traveling is a breeze after you’re
comfortable eating at restaurants and when you get a handle on language
considerations if you’re traveling abroad. Going to social events just requires
a little advance planning, and holidays will barely faze you — after you get
the hang of getting out and about gluten-free style.
Living your life in a bubble is for helium molecules. The gluten-free lifestyle
shouldn’t hold you back from doing anything (except eating gluten).
Raising kids to love the lifestyle
There are lots of things that are key in raising happy, healthy, gluten-free kids.
Some of the highlights include
 Giving them control of their diet from day one
 Always having yummy gluten-free treats on hand
 Reinforcing the benefits of the gluten-free lifestyle
 Always remembering that they’re learning from you how to feel about
their lifestyle
For more inspiration and practical advice, see my book Kids with Celiac
Disease: A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children.
Kids are flexible and resilient. Adopting a new lifestyle like being gluten-free 
is usually harder for the parents than it is for the child.
Setting realistic expectations
Some people call me PollyDanna because they think I have an unrealistically
optimistic view of the gluten-free lifestyle. It may be optimistic, but it’s not
unrealistic.
It’s important to set reasonable expectations for what things will be like when
you adopt a gluten-free lifestyle, because there will be challenges and you
need to prepare to handle them well. Friends, family, and loved ones may not
understand. They may not accommodate your diet when you hope or expect
they will. You may find social events to be overwhelming at first; or you may
get confused or frustrated and feel like giving up on the diet. There will be
challenges — and you will overcome them.
18
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Arming yourself with good information
The good news is that because the gluten-free diet is exploding in popularity,
there’s lots of information about it. The bad news is there’s lots of informa-
tion about it, and not all of it’s accurate. Be leery of what you hear and read,
and check the reliability of the source on everything. If you find conflicting
information — and I’ll warn you now that you will — dig deeper until you find
out which source is right.
I cite a few good sources of information in Chapter 3, and I’m sure you’ll find
more on your own. Just remember to keep a skeptical eye out for the good,
the bad, and the completely ludicrous.

Chapter 1: Gluten-Free: Not Just a Diet, It’s a Lifestyle
How I got pushed into the deep 
end of the gluten-free pool
Here’s my story about how I joined the ranks of
the gluten-free.
I didn’t aspire to do any of this. I was deeply
involved in a successful career, and a mommy
first and foremost. But today I’m an accidental
author, researcher, and support group founder
who was pushed into the deep end of the 
gluten-free pool and realized I needed to learn
to swim. Fast.
Until 1991, my family and I ate a fairly typical
American diet. Oh, I tried to keep it nutritious
(extra cheese on the spaghetti to add protein),
and I was aware of the need to limit fat and calo-
ries (scratch the extra cheese), but we didn’t
spend a lot of time worrying about what we ate
or the long-term effects food might have on our
bodies. We pretty much took eating for granted.
All of that changed in an instant when my first
child, Tyler, was about 9 months old and devel-
oped what seemed to be chronic diarrhea. The
pediatrician chalked it up to the antibiotics Ty
was taking for ear infections and told me to call
if it hadn’t cleared up in a few weeks. Three
weeks later, I was back in the pediatrician’s
office. “Yep, he still has diarrhea,” the doctor
declared with confidence. “Yeah, I know. That’s
why I’m here,” I mumbled with self-restraint
worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. “Give him foods
that will plug him up like crackers and bread —
and call me if it hasn’t cleared up in a few
weeks.” Huh?!? That’s the best you can do? My
Pampers bill is higher than your paycheck, 
my hands are raw from washing them every six
minutes, and I do eight loads of laundry a 
day because everything we own is covered in
diarrhea, and you want me to “plug him up” and
wait another three weeks? I don’t think so!
I waited. Not patiently (patience isn’t my great-
est strength), but I waited. What choice did I
have? Three weeks later, after another perfunc-
tory examination of his ears, nose, and throat (did
I lead you to believe this problem was above the
waist, Doctor?!?), he made that “mmhhhmmm”
noise that doctors make when they figure out the
problem. Yay! We were finally going to get some
answers! “Yep. He still has diarrhea.” All those
years of medical school had really paid off.
“Don’t worry about it. He’s not dehydrated, and
he’s in the 75th percentile for height and weight.
It’s nothing to be concerned about.” Gee, could
the fact that I practically infuse him with liquids
(continued)

20
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 
have anything to do with the fact that he’s not
dehydrated? And does the fact that he started off
in the 99th percentile and has dropped to the75th
mean anything? Apparently not. I was instructed
not to bring him back for diarrhea, because there
was nothing to be concerned about. If I was
going to insist on bringing him back, I’d be fired
from that pediatric office. I guess they meant it.
Doctor number two agreed with doctor number
one. After a quick look in Ty’s ears, nose, and
throat, he declared that we had a healthy baby
boy. “But what about the diarrhea?” I eeked.
“Really, it’s nothing to worry about. He’s a healthy
height and weight, he’s not dehydrated, and he
looks fine to me,” he chirped as he raced to his
next four-minute appointment. Oh, good. I’m glad
he looks fine to you. I considered offering to give
Doctor Do-Nothing a close look at the 22 diar-
rhea diapers a day that I was changing, but
somehow managed to control myself.
In desperation, we changed doctors again, 
and — long story short — a quick look in the
ears, nose, and throat turned up — you guessed
it — nothing. By this time, Tyler’s belly had grown
hugely distended, his arms and legs were
wasted to skinny little limbs, his hiney had 
disappeared completely, and his personality 
had changed. He had transformed from a lively,
energetic toddler to a listless, irritable, clingy,
and quiet little boy. It had been nearly a year
since the diarrhea first started, and we figured
we were just neurotic first-time parents with a
mellow kid who pooped a lot.
Eventually, we ended up in the hands of doctor
number four. By this time, “realizing” there was
nothing wrong with Tyler, I thought nothing of
dragging a lifeless baby with a Biafra belly into
the pediatrician’s office for a routine visit. After
looking in Tyler’s ears, nose, and throat, he laid
Tyler down on his back and thumped on his belly
like you might thump a honeydew melon to see 
if it’s ripe. “My goodness,” he said with that 
I’m-alarmed-but-I’m-a-doctor-and-don’t-want-to-
freak-you-out-so-I’ll- talk-in-my-pediatrician—
baby-talk-voice-that-will-surely-calm-you tone,
“What’s going on with his belly? It’s very dis-
tended.” I couldn’t answer through the tears 
of relief.
After testing for cystic fibrosis, blood diseases,
and cancer, we finally got the bittersweet diag-
nosis. “Your son has celiac disease.” Huh? Is that
anything like the flu? Surely a few weeks of
antibiotics will wipe it out. “He’ll need to be on a
gluten-free diet for the rest of his life.”
I don’t have room here to give the details of the
rest of the story, but you can read it in my other
books or on my Web sites. Suffice it to say that
the words “for the rest of his life” had a huge
impact, and we realized it was time to step up 
to the plate and do some research and lifestyle
and attitude adjustments to help ourselves —
and others.
When we were told that Tyler would have to
lead a gluten-free lifestyle, we had come to a
fork in the road. At first, we were devastated,
confused, frustrated, and grief-stricken. But 
we knew there was another path we could
choose — a path that would have a more posi-
tive effect on Tyler’s life. As we learned to live
with the diet and its ramifications, we worked
hard to find a way to turn the adversity into a
positive force in our lives. More than a decade
later, I realize that what we once interpreted as
misfortune has actually been a huge blessing in
our lives — and most importantly, Tyler agrees.

what do I know? Well, I know that you’re interested in whipping up some
gluten-free goodies and you’re looking for recipes to steer you in the right
direction.
What I don’t know is why you’re interested in cooking gluten-free, but I can
guess! Maybe you’re new to the gluten-free lifestyle and you want to know
what you can safely eat and how to turn it into a gluten-free gastronomic
delight. Or maybe you’ve been gluten-free and are looking for some spice in
your life and some giddyap in your gluten-free.
Maybe you suspect you have some type of gluten sensitivity, and you’re
trying the gluten-free diet to see if you feel better; or you’re trying the gluten-
free diet to help manage your weight (you’ll find tons of great information
about this in Chapter 4). Or maybe someone you love and cook for (or cook
for and love) is going gluten-free and you’re doing your best to support,
encourage, and nourish your hungry guy or gal.
It doesn’t really matter why you’re cooking gluten-free, because you are. And
that’s awesome. Because the gluten-free diet can be the healthiest diet on the
planet (yep, see Chapter 4 for more on that), it may dramatically improve
your health, both physical and emotional.

For those of you who really want to dig into the details about the health bene-
fits of a gluten-free diet, you may want to consider buying the companion 
to this book, Living Gluten-Free For Dummies. It contains everything you need
to know about the medical conditions, as well as practical and emotional
guidelines for living (and loving) a gluten-free lifestyle.
For now, we cover the basics so you know why your health may dramatically
improve when you go gluten-free.
Too good to be true? Read on, my friends, read on.
Wheat May Not Be Good for Anyone
You’ve probably been raised to believe that wheat — especially whole 
wheat — is really good for you. Although wheat does offer some health 
benefits, the same benefits can easily be found in other foods without the
unpleasant side effects that many, if not most, people experience. But here’s
the bottom line: I believe wheat’s not good for anyone, whether you have
gluten sensitivity or celiac disease or not. Move over, David Letterman —
here’s my top-ten list of the problems with wheat.
1. Humans don’t fully digest wheat
Let’s start with some basic biology. It’s a simple fact that the human stomach
doesn’t fully digest wheat. Cows, sheep, and other ruminant animals do just
fine with wheat because they have more than one stomach to complete the
digestion process. When the partially digested wheat leaves their stomach, 
it goes to another stomach where it is further broken down, then to another
and another until the process is complete.
Unlike our bovine buddies, we humans have only one stomach. When the
wheat leaves our tummies, it’s not fully digested. Those undigested portions
begin to ferment, and do you know what the byproduct of fermentation is?
Gas. Icky, belchable, fart-forming gas. For many people, this accounts for the
gas and bloating they feel after they eat wheat, whether they have gluten 
sensitivity or not.
2. Wheat is a pro-inflammatory agent
Recently, lots of books and articles have been written on the subject of 
pro-inflammatory foods. These foods are rapidly converted to sugar, causing 
a rise in the body’s insulin levels (read more about this in number nine on my
top-ten list), causing a burst of inflammation at the cellular level. Almost
22
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

everyone knows that blood sugar rises from eating sweets (cakes, cookies,
and candy). But lots of foods not considered sweets have pro-inflammatory
effects — foods that have wheat in them, like cereal, pasta, breads, and
bagels. These foods can be high in simple starches; when these are broken
down, they act the same as sweet foods, raising blood sugar levels, releasing
insulin, and causing inflammation. Bear in mind that the inflammation occurs
in all people, not just those with wheat or gluten sensitivities.
It turns out that inflammation, once thought to be limited to “-itis” conditions
like arthritis, may actually be at the root of a number of serious conditions,
including heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and some types of cancer. And if 
vanity is the only way to prove a point, consider this: Dr. Nicholas Perricone,
renowned author of The Wrinkle Cure, considers inflammation to be the
“single most powerful cause of the signs of aging.”
One great tool for identifying pro-inflammatory foods is the glycemic index
(remember this term; I’m going to use it again in number nine). The glycemic
index measures how fast your blood sugar rises after you eat a food that 
contains carbohydrates (like pasta, potatoes, and bread). It rates foods on a
scale from 0 to 100, where water is 0 and table sugar is 100. The lower the
glycemic index rating, the less likely the food is to be pro-inflammatory.
Foods made from wheat, especially refined wheat, have a glycemic index in
the 50 to 80-plus range, putting them on the high side and classifying them 
as pro-inflammatory.
3. Wheat can cause leaky gut syndrome
So what is leaky gut syndrome? Good question — I’m glad you asked. The
simple-and-not-perfectly-correct-but-close-enough answer is that leaky gut
syndrome is a condition whereby stuff is leaking from your gut into your
bloodstream — stuff that shouldn’t be there, like toxins (and large molecules
like gluten!).
So how does it happen? When people eat wheat, their bodies produce extra
amounts of a protein called zonulin.
The lining of the small intestine is basically a wall of cells that most materials
can’t pass through on their own. When important vitamins and minerals are
present, zonulin tells the passageways in the intestinal wall to open so those
nutrients can pass into the bloodstream. The blood then carries the nutrients
to other parts of the body, where they can be used to nourish the body.
But when people eat wheat — not just people with celiac disease, but all
people — their zonulin levels rise too high, and the passageways open too
much and let things into the bloodstream that shouldn’t be there. This
increased permeability of the lining of the small intestine, known as leaky 
gut syndrome, can cause a variety of problems health-wise.
23
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

For people with celiac disease, leaky-gut syndrome starts the cascade of
events that lead to health problems. Gluten is a large molecule that really
shouldn’t be able to get into the bloodstream, but it does because zonulin
levels are too high, and the body allows it in. After it’s in the bloodstream, 
the body sees the gluten molecule as an invader — a toxin — so it launches
an attack, and in doing so, it damages the area around the gluten molecule,
which includes the lining of the small intestine. The villi, which are short
hair-like structures that are designed to increase the surface area of the small
intestine so it can absorb more nutrients, are damaged in the attack. That’s
why people with celiac disease who continue to eat gluten often have serious
nutritional deficiencies.
For a lot more details on how gluten affects a person who can’t tolerate
gluten, grab a copy of my book Living Gluten-Free For Dummies (Wiley).
4. Refined wheat has little 
nutritional value
Most of the wheat people eat is “refined.” That means manufacturers take
perfectly good wheat — which has some nutritional value, especially in the
bran and germ — and they take the good stuff away, leaving “refined” (read
“little nutritional value”) wheat. Sadly, that’s the form that most of our 
wheat-based products use — refined wheat nearly void of nutritional value,
making it a high–glycemic index food that just makes you fat and messes 
with your insulin production.
Did you know that manufacturers actually have to enrich refined wheat
because they’ve taken out all the nutrients? And even then, the wheat’s not
that valuable, nutritionally speaking. Whole wheat provides more nutritional
value than non-whole wheat, but it’s still wheat, and there are more than 
just a few reasons that wheat may not be good for anyone.
5. Wheat may cause wrinkles
Aha! Now that got your attention! Okay, so you can live with the gas, bloating,
and leaky gut syndrome, but wrinkles? I think not! Well then put down that
bagel, or buy stock in Botox, because according to some experts, the inflam-
matory effect of wheat — especially refined wheat — can cause wrinkles 
(see number two in this top-ten list for more on pro-inflammatory foods).
24
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

The most famous of these experts is Dr. Nicholas Perricone, a dermatologist
and adjunct professor of medicine at Michigan State University, who maintains
that inflammation contributes to accelerated aging and that through diet 
(and supplements and creams), you can erase scars and wrinkles, increase
the production of collagen and elastin, enjoy radiance and glow, and develop 
a dewy, supple appearance to your skin.
Of course, this wouldn’t be relevant unless the “diet” he refers to has some-
thing to do with being gluten-free. Although Dr. Perricone doesn’t pinpoint
gluten as a culprit per se, he does say that the pro-inflammatory response
caused by wheat causes the skin to age more quickly, and he maintains that
avoiding foods like wheat may help reverse the aging process.
6. Wheat may contribute 
to menopausal symptoms
Menopause, the time in a woman’s life between about ages 45 and 55 marking
the completion of her childbearing years and the end of her menstrual cycles,
is often a time of marked hormonal changes. Depression, anxiety, headaches,
leg cramps, varicose veins, irritability, and the famous “hot flashes” that 
occur are some of the more common symptoms.
But many doctors believe that lifestyle changes can minimize these symp-
toms, and one of those lifestyle changes is diet. Although there is some 
debate over wheat’s role in these lifestyle changes, many experts, including
Christiane Northrup, MD, author of The Wisdom of Menopause, believe that
eliminating wheat from the diet — especially refined wheat — can help 
relieve menopausal symptoms.
7. Wheat is one of the top-eight allergens
Millions of people are allergic to wheat — so many, in fact, that it has made 
it onto the top-eight allergen list. Keep in mind that an allergy to wheat is 
different from celiac disease or other forms of gluten sensitivity — we’ll talk
more on that later in this chapter.
Allergic reactions to wheat can include gastrointestinal distress (stomach
upset), eczema, hay fever, hives, asthma, and even anaphylaxis (a severe,
whole-body allergic reaction), which is life-threatening.
25
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

Other than the anaphylaxis, these symptoms sound a lot like gluten sensitiv-
ity or celiac disease, don’t they? That’s why sometimes it’s hard to tell the 
difference. That’s also why sometimes people get allergy testing and find out
they’re not allergic to wheat — so they’re told to go back to a normal diet of
pizza, bread, and bagels. Not necessarily good advice, because they could
actually have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. So it’s important to be 
properly tested. (Yep, you guessed it — we’ll talk more about that later in 
this chapter, too.)
8. Wheat can mess up your 
blood sugar levels
Remember in number two when I talked about the glycemic index? Well,
don’t worry — it’s not really that complicated (and there’s no pop quiz). All
you need to know is that some foods cause your blood sugar levels to spike,
which causes your body to produce insulin. That, in turn, causes your blood
sugar to fall dramatically. Basically, your blood sugar levels go from the even
keel they should be on, to being the best roller coaster ride in the park. Easy,
Evil Knievel. That’s not a good thing in this case.
Our bodies are designed to work with stable blood sugar levels. When they’re
up, then down, and all around, it causes a domino effect of not-so-healthy
things to occur. Lots of people talk about hypoglycemia — a weak, shaky feel-
ing that usually goes away after eating, especially after eating sweet foods.
Although most people don’t have “true” hypoglycemia, they may feel hypo-
glycemic when their blood sugar drops too much. The problem with the idea
of “fixing” this feeling with sugary foods is that it just continues this roller
coaster of blood sugar levels that are too high, and then too low. One of the
most serious conditions that can result from blood sugar whiplash is insulin
resistance and diabetes.
9. Wheat can make you fat
I’m not talking about the kind of “make you fat” that you deserve if you sit
around eating donuts all day. I’m talking about the kind that sneaks up on 
you when you think you’re doing everything right, but those getting-tighter-
every-day jeans say otherwise.
It could just be the wheat — especially refined wheat. That’s because of what
it does to your blood sugar — yeah, you can cheat and look back at number
eight if you didn’t read it well enough the first time — but again, it’s not that
26
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

complicated. Refined wheat is a high–glycemic index food that causes your
blood sugar to spike. That makes your body produce insulin, which, by the
way, is often referred to as the “fat-storing hormone.”
Yikes. Just when you thought you were being so good by leaving the cream
cheese off the bagel — you should probably ditch the bagel altogether.
10. Many people have gluten sensitivity 
or celiac disease and don’t know it
I hear things like, “I think I’m allergic to dairy because the cheese on my pizza
makes me bloat.” Oh, really? What makes you think it’s the cheese? Because
more people have heard of lactose intolerance than gluten intolerance, they
figure that must be what’s making them feel icky.
Truth is, most people have no idea that they have a gluten sensitivity or
celiac disease, so they usually start pointing to all the wrong culprits: cheese
(dairy), tomato sauce (acids), or soy. But they’re blaming the wrong foods.
These people have no idea that the typical American diet comprised of
bagels, pasta, pizza, cakes, cookies, and pretzels could be wreaking havoc on
nearly every system in their bodies, so they continue to eat them and wonder
why they don’t feel good.
So how many people fall into this category? No one knows for sure. We do
know that 1 in 100 people has celiac disease — but most don’t know it. No
one knows how many people have gluten sensitivity, but estimates are that it
may be as high as 50 percent, or even 70 percent, of the population. Top that
with those who have a wheat allergy, and — here, let me get my calculator
out — tons of people + gobs more = an astoundingly high percentage of the
population!
Recognizing Different Types 
of Gluten-Related Problems
Lots of people — may I dare to say most people?!? — have some form of
gluten sensitivity (as we assert in number ten of our top-ten list in the 
previous section). But is it sensitivity, allergy, or celiac disease? Sometimes
it’s tough to tell.
27
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

I’ve had thousands of people tell me they’re allergic to gluten. But in actual-
ity, there’s no such a thing as a gluten allergy — someone can have allergies
to the foods that contain gluten: wheat, rye, and barley. In fact, wheat is 
one of the most common allergens, affecting millions of people (see number
seven in the previous section). You could even be allergic to all three 
grains, and I suppose that might almost qualify for an allergy to gluten — 
but not really.
Allergies to gluten-containing foods
There’s really no such thing as an allergy to gluten. If you happen to be 
allergic to all three gluten-containing grains (wheat, rye, and barley), I guess 
I could let it slide if you told me you were allergic to gluten — even though
you’re really allergic to the three grains that fall under the gluten umbrella.
But most people misuse the term and say they’re allergic to gluten when
what they really mean to say is that they have an intolerance or sensitivity to
gluten, or they have full-blown celiac disease.
Allergies to gluten-containing foods are just like other food allergies. They’re
all responses to a food allergen, and the reaction that someone has to those
foods varies from person to person and from one food to another.
Allergic symptoms can be respiratory, causing coughing, nasal congestion,
sneezing, throat tightness, and even asthma. Acute allergic reactions to food
usually start in the mouth, with tingling, itching, a metallic taste, and swelling
of the tongue and throat. Sometimes symptoms are farther down the intesti-
nal tract, causing abdominal pain, muscle spasms, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Any severe and acute allergic reaction also has the potential to cause 
anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock. This life-threatening condition affects 
different organs, and symptoms can include a feeling of agitation, hives,
breathing problems, a drop in blood pressure, and fainting. In some cases, 
an anaphylactic response to an allergen can be fatal unless the person having
the allergic reaction receives an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection.
Distinguishing between gluten 
sensitivity and celiac disease
Gluten sensitivity can mean a lot of different things, and is often misused; it’s 
a very fuzzy term. Basically, it’s a sensitivity to gluten — hence the clever
term, “gluten sensitivity.” Often used interchangeably, the terms sensitivity
and intolerance mean that your body doesn’t react well to a particular food
28
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

and you should avoid it. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity are usually the same
as those of celiac disease, and as with celiac disease, they usually go away on
a gluten-free diet.
Unlike gluten sensitivity, celiac disease is well-defined. It’s a common, yet
often misdiagnosed, genetic intolerance to gluten that can develop at any
age, in people of any ethnicity. When people with celiac disease eat gluten,
their immune systems respond by attacking the gluten molecule, and in so
doing, the immune system also attacks the body itself. This is called an
autoimmune response, and it results in damage to the small intestine, which
can cause poor absorption of nutrients.
Although the damage occurs in the gastrointestinal tract (specifically in the
small intestine), not all symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature. That’s
because celiac disease is multisystemic — the symptoms show up in many 
different ways and can occur in just about every organ of the body. In fact,
symptoms are vast and varied, and they sometimes come and go, which
makes diagnosis difficult.
Does someone who has gluten sensitivity also have celiac disease? Not 
necessarily. Or maybe. How’s that for ambiguity? I told you it was fuzzy! Let
me try to clarify.
You’re told you have gluten sensitivity, 
but you actually have celiac disease
Some people who are told by a health-care professional that they have
“gluten sensitivity” actually have celiac disease, but their testing was done
improperly or was insufficient to yield conclusive results.
Say, for instance, that someone is IgA deficient (IgA is a special type of pro-
tein that the body produces to fight infections), and many people are. Most of
the time it doesn’t cause a problem. But it makes testing for celiac disease
difficult, because most of the celiac tests are based on starting with a normal
level of IgA. If a person doesn’t have enough IgA in his body, that would make
some of the celiac tests appear to be normal when actually the person’s
levels should have been elevated (indicating celiac disease) if he weren’t IgA
deficient. In other words, the person has celiac disease, but because testing
was incomplete (the doctors didn’t test to determine if he was IgA deficient),
the results were interpreted incorrectly.
Another reason you may have celiac disease but be told you have gluten sen-
sitivity is if the type of testing you undergo is specific to gluten sensitivity, not
celiac disease. For instance, a stool test and a few types of saliva tests check
for gluten sensitivity, but if you have celiac disease, they’ll be positive. So you
would, in fact, have celiac disease — but the only test you’re taking in this
case is for gluten sensitivity, so that’s what you’ll be “diagnosed” with.
29
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

If you’re diagnosed as having gluten sensitivity, you may want to ask if any
specific tests were done to test for celiac disease. There are antibody tests
that are more specific for celiac disease, as well as genetic tests. If those tests
weren’t performed, you may want to get them done so you have a more 
definitive diagnosis.
You don’t have celiac disease — YET
Sometimes in the very earliest stages of celiac disease, testing for celiac 
disease will be negative — but the tests for gluten sensitivity may be positive.
In this case, the person has celiac disease, but it’s too early to show on tests.
If that person continues to eat gluten, the testing will eventually be positive
(and damage will be done!).
It’s important to remember that, as far as celiac testing goes, “once tested”
doesn’t mean “forever tested.” In other words, if you’re negative today, it
doesn’t mean you’re negative forever. There’s no timeline to follow in terms
of how often you should have a specific test for celiac disease, but it’s 
important to be aware that it can develop at any time.
You have gluten sensitivity, not celiac disease
Some people do, in fact, have gluten sensitivity that is not celiac disease.
Symptoms are generally the same as those for celiac disease (see the very
next section), and, as with the disease, health improves on a gluten-free diet.
Sorting Out the Symptoms 
of Gluten Intolerance
It’s funny. Ask most people what the most common symptom of celiac 
disease or gluten sensitivity is and, if they know anything about either one
(and don’t look at you and say, “Huh?”), they’ll most likely erupt in a loud,
unabashed, confident chorus of “diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea!”
Yet most people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity don’t have diarrhea.
In fact, they don’t have any gastrointestinal symptoms at all! And if they do
have gastrointestinal symptoms, they’re often constipated, or they suffer
reflux or gas and bloating.
Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease have hundreds of symptoms. The 
following sections list some of the more common ones, starting with the
symptoms that are gastrointestinal in nature.
30
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Pinpointing gastrointestinal symptoms
The gastrointestinal symptoms of gluten sensitivity and celiac disease are
vast. Although most people think diarrhea is the most common symptom,
gastrointestinal symptoms can include constipation, gas, bloating, reflux, 
and even vomiting.
These are some of the “classic” — though not the most common — 
symptoms of celiac disease:
 Abdominal pain and distension
 Acid reflux
 Bloating
 Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Gas and flatulence
 Greasy, foul-smelling, floating stools
 Nausea
 Vomiting
 Weight loss or weight gain
Checking out non-gastrointestinal 
symptoms
Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are gastrointestinal conditions because
the damage is done to the small intestine. But people more commonly have
what are called extraintestinal (outside the intestine) symptoms. These make
up an extensive list of more than 250 symptoms, including the following:
 Fatigue and weakness (due to iron-deficiency anemia)
 Vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies
 Headaches (including migraines)
 Joint or bone pain
 Depression, irritability, listlessness, and mood disorders
 “Fuzzy brain” or an inability to concentrate
31
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

 Infertility
 Abnormal menstrual cycles
 Dental enamel deficiencies and irregularities
 Seizures
 Ataxia (bad balance)
 Nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)
 Respiratory problems
 Canker sores (aphthous ulcers)
 Lactose intolerance
 Eczema/psoriasis
 Rosacea (a skin disorder)
 Acne
 Hashimoto’s disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, lupus erythematosus, and
other autoimmune disorders
 Early onset osteoporosis
 Hair loss (alopecia)
 Bruising easily
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
 Muscle cramping
 Nosebleeds
 Swelling and inflammation
 Night blindness
Watching for symptoms in kids
Kids who have celiac disease tend to have the “classic” gastrointestinal
symptoms of diarrhea or constipation. They may also have some of the 
following symptoms that aren’t gastrointestinal in nature:
 Inability to concentrate.
 Irritability.
 ADD/ADHD or autistic-type behaviors (I go into more detail on these
behaviors and their connection to gluten later in this chapter.)
32
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

 Failure to thrive (in infants and toddlers).
 Short stature or delayed growth.
 Delayed onset of puberty.
 Weak bones or bone pain.
 Abdominal pain and distension.
 Nosebleeds.
Considering Your Options for Testing
With such an overwhelming assortment of symptoms, it’s no wonder people
are often misdiagnosed before finding out that they have celiac disease or
gluten sensitivity. It’s also no wonder so many people go undiagnosed.
A Reader’s Digest article titled “10 Diseases Doctors Miss” cited celiac 
disease one of the top-ten misdiagnosed diseases. In all fairness to the med-
ical community, it can be tough to diagnose celiac disease when you think 
of the myriad symptoms. Headaches, fatigue, infertility, depression — if you
go to your doctor for any of those things, it’s unlikely that he or she is going
to say, “Hmm, you’re depressed. Let’s test you for celiac disease.” No, it’s far
more likely that you’ll be given an antidepressant and sent on your way.
Don’t despair. There are plenty of doctors who are extremely knowledgeable
about these conditions and who will do proper testing. If yours isn’t one of
those, keep looking until you find one who is. There are even some tests that
you can order yourself without a doctor’s intervention.
Looking into tests
It seems like there should be one single test you can take that would defini-
tively determine whether you have gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, or none
of the above. But alas, it’s not that simple.
For one thing, there are different types of tests: blood, stool, saliva, and
intestinal biopsy. In most cases, one type of test may determine whether 
you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity — but most tests don’t discern
between the two or test for both. In other words, one test looks for gluten
sensitivity but not celiac disease; another looks for celiac disease but not
gluten sensitivity. And most people only get one (maybe two) of those tests,
so they’re rarely tested for both conditions.
33
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

So which test is best? Sounds like a simple question, but there’s no simple
answer. The gold standard for testing for celiac disease is a blood test 
followed by an intestinal biopsy. If both tests are positive, you’re deemed to
be confirmed as having celiac disease.
What we can say for certain — or close to it — is that if you test positive for
celiac disease, you have celiac disease. That’s because the tests for celiac 
disease are very specific, highly sensitive, and extremely reliable — especially
when they indicate a positive outcome (diagnosis of celiac disease).
However, if the test is negative and your symptoms go away on a gluten-free
diet, then you probably have some form of gluten sensitivity.
Unfortunately, there are false negatives and occasional false positives. Some
people test negative yet find that they don’t feel right when they eat gluten.
Perhaps it was a false negative — or maybe gluten just doesn’t sit right 
with you.
Bottom line: If it makes you feel bad, don’t eat it!
Sadly, because the protocol for defining and diagnosing gluten sensitivity
isn’t well established and there’s some disagreement about definitions of
gluten sensitivity in the medical community, patients are often told to ignore
inconclusive or confusing test results and to go back to eating their bagels
and pizza. If you aren’t sure you can trust your test results, you may want to
be tested again at a later time.
For more detailed information on testing and interpreting results, see Living
Gluten-Free For Dummies (Wiley), the companion book to this one.
Going gluten-free without testing
You may be tempted to skip the testing and jump right into a gluten-free diet.
If, for instance, you highly suspect you have celiac disease or gluten sensitiv-
ity, it makes sense — going gluten-free will help you start healing the minute
you start the diet. Most people begin feeling better right away, some take
months to improve, but in the long-run, you can look forward to improved
health — sometimes dramatically improved.
But — and I’m waving a great big caution flag here — if you plan to be 
tested, don’t give up your gluten just yet. You have to be eating gluten for an
extended length of time before getting the blood test or the intestinal biopsy.
34
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

If you don’t eat gluten, or haven’t eaten it for long enough, your body may not
produce enough antibodies to show up on the tests, and the results will come
back negative for gluten sensitivity or celiac disease — even if you do have
the condition.
In other words, the gluten-free diet will “heal” you. Your body will no longer
think it has celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. It will stop producing antibod-
ies, and your intestines will heal — so the tests that determine whether you
have the conditions will tell you that you don’t, even if you do.
After you’ve gone gluten-free, you can’t be properly tested for celiac disease.
No one knows for sure exactly how much gluten you need to eat to be 
properly tested, but if you eat the equivalent of one or two pieces of gluten-
containing bread a day for at least three months, you should have enough
gluten in your system to provide a measurable response.
Keep in mind, though, that you may be causing damage to your body by 
continuing to eat gluten! It’s a conundrum, for sure!
If you decide to continue to eat gluten before testing and you have severe
symptoms, talk with your doctor to decide whether you should continue to
eat gluten.
Realizing the Consequences of Cheating
If you actually have gluten sensitivity and not celiac disease, you may 
be able to get away with eating gluten from time to time. Just make sure you
remember those pesky false negatives and misdiagnoses, and make sure
you don’t have celiac disease if you’re going to indulge.
Some people are told they’re gluten sensitive when they really do have celiac
disease. If that scenario applies to you and you continue to eat gluten, even if
it’s just every once in a while, you could do some serious unseen damage, not
to mention you may continue to suffer unpleasant symptoms.
On the other hand, if you do have celiac disease and you want to improve
your health by following a gluten-free diet, you’re going to have to do it 100
percent. A “gluten-free lite” diet won’t get rid of your symptoms, and it will
continue to damage your body. The next few sections explain why.
Going 100 percent gluten-free is not necessarily easy. You might want to refer
to Living Gluten-Free For Dummies (Wiley) for a more detailed manual.
35
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

Compromising your health
If you have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease and you continue to eat gluten,
you are compromising your health, even if you don’t feel any symptoms.
Even the tiniest amount of gluten will cause you problems because you’re
still setting off autoimmune responses and your body is being robbed of
important nutrients that it needs to function properly and stay strong.
When you have celiac disease, every bit of gluten you eat affects your 
intestinal tract adversely and keeps you from making healthy progress. That
means you’ll need to be extremely careful about reading labels, choosing
ingredients, and avoiding contamination while cooking. (See Chapter 5 to 
find out more about containing contamination risks.)
Developing associated conditions
Certain conditions are associated with celiac disease. It’s usually tough 
to tell which one developed first, but because awareness of other conditions
is higher than that of celiac disease, people are usually diagnosed with the
other one first.
It’s important to understand the association between conditions for a 
few reasons:
 Someone who has one condition is more likely to have the other.
 If you don’t give up gluten, your chances of developing an associated
condition may increase.
 An associated condition is a red flag that you may also have gluten 
sensitivity or celiac disease. If you have one of these conditions, you
should be tested for gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
 If people in your family have an associated condition, you may want 
to consider urging them to be tested — and being tested yourself.
Autoimmune diseases
Several autoimmune diseases are associated with celiac disease, including
 Addison’s disease (hypoadrenocorticism)
 Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis
 Crohn’s disease
 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes)
36
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

About 6 percent of people with type 1 diabetes have celiac disease, but many
don’t know it. They often find managing blood sugar levels much easier on a
gluten-free diet!
 Myasthenia gravis
 Raynaud’s phenomenon
 Scleroderma
 Sjögren’s syndrome
 Systemic lupus erythematosus
 Thyroid disease (Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease)
 Ulcerative colitis
Studies have shown that if you have celiac disease, the earlier in life you go
on a gluten-free diet, the lower your risk of developing associated autoim-
mune diseases. And sometimes symptoms of other autoimmune diseases, like
multiple sclerosis, improve on a gluten-free diet.
Mood disorders
Some of the mood disorders associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac 
disease include
 ADD (attention deficit disorder) or ADHD (attention deficit hyperactive
disorder)
 Autism
 Bipolar disease
 Depression
Nutritional deficiencies
Because gluten sensitivity and celiac disease affect the small intestine, 
nutritional deficiencies usually develop. These can include
 Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies
 Anemia
 Osteoporosis
 Osteopenia (low bone mineral density)
 Osteomalacia (soft bones)
37
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

Neurological conditions
Some neurological conditions are associated with gluten sensitivity and
celiac disease, including
 Epilepsy and cerebral calcifications
 Brain and spinal cord defects (in newborns born to mothers with celiac
disease who are eating gluten)
 Neurological problems, such as ataxia, neuropathy, tingling, seizures,
and optic myopathy
Other conditions
Several other conditions are commonly associated with celiac disease,
including
 Cancer (such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma)
 Down syndrome
 Internal hemorrhaging
 Organ disorders (of the gallbladder, liver, spleen, or pancreas)
 Tooth enamel defects
 Cystic fibrosis
Understanding How Gluten 
Affects Behavior
You’re probably not going to get too far in a court of law pleading, “The
wheat bread made me do it!” But gluten is sometimes guilty when it comes to
affecting behavior and moods.
Gluten can affect your behavior in many ways. Some behavioral manifesta-
tions of gluten sensitivity and celiac disease can include
 Inability to concentrate or focus
 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactive 
disorder (ADHD) type behaviors
 Autism
 Depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders
 Irritability
 Lack of motivation
38
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Connecting gluten and autism
Dietary interventions for developmental and behavioral disabilities have
been the topic of many heated discussions for decades. One of the most
remarkable (in my opinion) things about the gluten-free diet is that it seems
to play a role in reversing autistic behaviors — at least in some cases.
Several credible double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are underway at
reputable universities to study the relationship between gluten and autism.
The results of these studies are eagerly anticipated and will most likely have
a dramatic affect on the way pediatricians view the disorder.
For now, I’ll summarize what we know. Gastrointestinal problems seem to be
more prevalent in people with autism than in the general public — do they
have a higher incidence of celiac disease? No one has studied that. Is there a
connection? Maybe.
The scientific community believes that there’s a genetic basis for autism. But
interestingly, there seems to be a nutritional component.
The most popular diet promoted as a “cure” for autism is a gluten-free,
casein-free diet (casein is the protein found in milk). No one claims that this
works in all cases; nor do they say it’s truly a cure. But if a dietary interven-
tion protocol could actually improve autistic behaviors, wouldn’t that be
amazing? Some say it can.
Just a short time ago, the evidence was largely anecdotal, but now the
“Defeat Autism Now!” protocol recommends that every autistic child be
placed on a gluten-free, casein-free diet for at least three months.
In some autistic children, gluten and casein are turned into a sort of drug that
the brain makes, much like morphine. Essentially, many autistic children are
“drugged” on wheat and milk products, as if they were on a morphine drip.
Basically, when people with autism eat gluten and casein, they get a high off
of the foods, and they become addicted. This “high” is similar to the one
experienced by opiate users, and it may account for some of the typical traits
found in autistic kids, such as repetitive movements like head banging and
spinning, being withdrawn, and having a fascination with parts of objects
(like fixating on one part of a toy rather than the toy itself).
Results on the gluten-free, casein-free diet vary. Some see improvement within
a week, some within a year, and others see no improvement at all. Even in
those who report behavioral changes, the changes themselves vary. Some
people with autism are able to sleep through the night, others become more
verbal and interactive, and some are completely “normalized” on the diet.
39
Chapter 2: So Why Cook Gluten-Free, Anyway?

The gluten-free diet can be especially difficult for a person with autism,
because these folks tend to develop food preferences, and these usually
include gluten-containing foods.
Delving into depression and 
other mood disorders
People with celiac disease have a higher incidence of mania, seizures, and
other neurological problems. In addition, clinical depression, bipolar 
disorder, schizophrenia, and a variety of mood disorders can sometimes be
associated with or exacerbated by gluten sensitivity and celiac disease. Some
journal articles even list these disorders as symptoms of celiac disease, and
these conditions sometimes improve on a gluten-free diet.
Schizophrenia has been associated with celiac disease since the 1960s, when
it was first noted that restricting gluten and dairy led to improvement in
some institutionalized patients. Interestingly, the same opiate-like chemicals
found in the urine of autistic people are often found in schizophrenics.
Some investigators have noted that the incidence of schizophrenia is higher
in places where wheat is the staple grain than where people normally eat
non-gluten-containing grains. In one study done in the highlands of Papua,
New Guinea, where little or no grain is consumed, only two people out of
65,000 adults could be identified as chronic schizophrenics. In the coastal
area, where wheat is consumed more, the prevalence of schizophrenia was
about three times higher.

What’s Gluten-Free 
and What Isn’t?
In This Chapter
 Separating the go-ahead foods from the no-nos
 Hunting down hidden gluten
 Checking out the array of gluten-free alternatives
 Ferreting out facts on labels and from manufacturers
W
hen you’re cooking gluten-free meals, it’s crucial to ensure that your
ingredients are 100 percent gluten-free. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t
it? Wheat = gluten; rye = gluten; barley = gluten. So a recipe minus wheat, rye,
or barley is gluten-free, right? Um . . . no. Not necessarily.
Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple to figure out what’s gluten-free and
what’s not. Picture a veggie garden with lots of healthy tomato plants. Well,
gluten can be hidden, like those pesky tomato worms in your veggie garden.
You can look and look; one day your tomato plants may appear to be free of
the disgusting, overgrown amoebas, but when your plants are ruined, you
realize you somehow missed spotting the destroyer.
Gluten can be the same way. It can hide in the ingredients you least suspect.
And one little bit of it will ruin the entire plant — er, I mean meal!
The gluten-free diet may seem cumbersome at first because the derivatives
of gluten-containing grains may contain gluten. As if that’s not complicated
enough, many processed foods — which contain seasonings, additives, and
flavorings — can also contain questionable ingredients.
This chapter helps you find your way through the maze of grains, flours, and
alternatives that you can safely use in gluten-free cooking. You’re about to meet
some foods that may be new to you, with exotic names like quinoa, millet, buck-
wheat, and teff. And you may have some surprising realizations as you discover
that some of these alternatives are far more nutritious than wheat.

To help you ease into what may be unfamiliar territory, I start by separating
foods into those that are definite no-nos and those that are definitely okay.
Then I explain how to search out hidden gluten. Finally, I introduce you to
those incredible gluten-free alternatives.
Keep in mind that the lists of foods that do and don’t contain gluten vary, and
they’re only here to help you get started. You can find up-to-date lists of safe,
forbidden, and questionable foods at www.celiac.com.
Avoiding These Definite No-Nos
I’ll just get to the point. Here are the grains you need to avoid on a gluten-
free diet:
 Wheat and almost anything with the word wheat in its name. Okay, 
we know you’re thinking, “She gets her name on a book to tell me I can’t
eat wheat!?” Okay, smarty pants, I realize that staying away from this
grain may seem obvious. But it’s not that straightforward. Sure, it may
be obvious that you’ll also need to avoid hydrolyzed wheat protein,
wheat starch, wheat germ, and so on, but you may not realize that you
need to beware of aliases like flour, bulgur, semolina, spelt, frumento,
durum (also spelled duram), kamut, graham, einkorn, farina, couscous,
seitan, matzoh, matzah, matzo, and cake flour.
Wheat grass, like all grasses, is gluten-free.
 Wheat starch, which is a wheat that’s had the gluten washed out. In
some countries, a special type of wheat starch called Codex Alimentarius
wheat starch is allowed on the gluten-free diet — but standards vary
from country to country. Codex Alimentarius wheat starch isn’t allowed
in North America because some people question whether the washing
process completely removes all residual gluten.
 Barley and its derivatives. Besides avoiding barley in its pure form, 
you need to avoid malt and malt flavoring, which are usually derived
from malt.
 Triticale, which most people have never heard of. It’s a cross between
wheat and rye, and was developed to combine the productivity of wheat
with the ruggedness of rye.
 Rye. This grain isn’t really hidden in any ingredients, so the pure form 
of rye — usually found in rye bread — is what you need to avoid.

 Derivatives of gluten-containing grains. If you thought you were done
with derivatives when you finished your calculus class, you were wrong.
You need to avoid derivatives of gluten-containing grains, and the most
common one to watch out for is malt, which usually comes from barley.
Malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar are definite no-nos. If malt is
derived from another source, such as corn, it will usually say so on the
label; for instance, “malt (from corn).” That’s not too common, though,
so if the source isn’t specified, don’t eat it.
Here are some foods that usually contain gluten. You’ll need to avoid these 
as well:
 Beer
Some great new gluten-free beers are available. Not only are smaller, spe-
cialty breweries making them, but even the big boys like Budweiser have
come out with a gluten-free beer that you can buy just about anywhere
beer is sold.
 Bread, bread crumbs, biscuits
 Cereal
 Cookies, cakes, cupcakes, doughnuts, muffins, pastries, pie crusts,
brownies, and other baked goods
 Cornbread
 Crackers
 Croutons
 Gravies, sauces, and roux
 Imitation seafood (for example, imitation crab)
 Licorice
 Marinades (such as teriyaki)
 Pasta
 Pizza crust
 Pretzels
 Soy sauce
 Stuffing
Now, that’s not so bad, is it? And I promise you, the list of foods you can eat is
a lot longer than this one!

Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

Getting the Green Light: 
Definitely Okay Foods
Now for the good news! The list of definitely okay foods is impossibly long!
There’s no way we could list all the okay foods, because most natural foods
are inherently gluten-free. So in this section, we talk about grains and starchy
foods because those are the ones you may question. Some of these things
may be strange sounding and new to you, but give ’em a try! You can find
more information about each of the foods listed below later in the chapter.
 Amaranth
 Arrowroot
 Buckwheat/groats/kasha
 Chickpeas
 Garfava
Garfava is actually a nutritious blend of garbanzo and fava flours that
Authentic Foods developed. Because it’s exclusive to that one company,
it’s not found on many gluten-free food lists, but it has become a popular
ingredient in so many cookbooks that we felt compelled to list it here.
 Job’s Tears
 Mesquite (pinole)
 Millet
 Montina (Indian ricegrass)
 Quinoa (hie)
 Ragi
 Rice
 Sorghum
 Soy
 Tapioca (gari, cassava, casaba, manioc, yucca)
 Taro root
 Teff
In addition to the grains and starches listed above, plenty of other foods are
naturally gluten-free. (Note: These refer to plain, unseasoned foods without
additives or processed products.)
44
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

 Beans
Garbanzo beans by any other name are . . . well, they’re still garbanzo
beans. They can be called besan, cici, chana, or gram — not to be 
confused with graham, which does have gluten.
 Corn
 Dairy products
 Eggs
 Fish
 Fruit
 Legumes
 Meat
 Nuts
 Potatoes
 Poultry
 Seafood
 Vegetables
You can also find specialty products like cookies, cakes, brownies, breads,
crackers, pretzels, and other products that have been made with gluten-free
ingredients. Chapter 6 helps you figure out where to buy these sorts of 
goodies.
Snooping for Hidden Gluten
In the “olden days,” the list of questionable foods and ingredients used to be
really long. And it was longer than it needed to be, because it included things
like vinegar, vanilla, almond extract, and sometimes, foods that were just
plain ridiculous to be on the no-no list, like canola oil. For people on a gluten-
free diet, staying away from these so-called questionable foods dramatically
reduced their cooking and dining choices.
In the last several years, we’ve come a long way, baby. Thanks to new labeling
laws and decades of research, there are far fewer “questionable” ingredients
than there used to be. These days, manufacturers have to indicate if a product
has wheat in it, and new labeling laws require manufacturers to clearly define
the gluten-free status of foods. (For more on reading labels, see the section,
“Labeling gluten-free: The law and what it means,” later in this chapter.)
45
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

These new regulations have opened the pantry door to lots of ingredients
that used to be considered off-limits. For example, we now know that regard-
less of the source, the distillation process eliminates all sources of gluten
from vinegar. In other words, even if the vinegar started from wheat (which it
usually doesn’t), all the gluten is gone after distillation.
Distilled vinegar, cider vinegar, and most vinegars are okay — but malt 
vinegar is still off limits.
The publication Gluten-Free Living and its sister Web site, www.glutenfree
living.com, are excellent sources for sorting out fact from fiction on 
questionable ingredients.
Ending the controversy about 
“questionable” ingredients
The debates will never end. You’ll still see ingredients on the no-no list that
shouldn’t be there — and you’ll still see Internet postings from people who
swear grapes have gluten in them because they ate a grape and had an upset
tummy the next day.
Don’t believe everything you read (except in all of my books!). The Internet 
is loaded with bad information, and even some product guides and printed
brochures can’t be trusted.
Fortunately, some of the controversy has been put to rest, thanks to new
labeling laws and more definitive research. The following ingredients used to
be considered questionable, but are now okay on the gluten-free diet:
 Alcohol (distilled)
 Caramel color
 Citric acid
 Dextrin
Technically, dextrin can be made from wheat, but most companies in the
U.S. use corn. Again, because of labeling laws, if it’s made from wheat,
the ingredients list has to say so.
 Flavoring extracts
 Hydrolyzed plant protein (HPP)
 Hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP)
46
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

HVP can be derived from wheat. But because of the new labeling laws, if
it is, the label has to say that. It would most likely appear on the label as
“hydrolyzed wheat protein.”
 Maltodextrin
Maltodextrin confuses people, because of the word malt in the name.
Dextrin can be made from wheat, but maltodextrin is gluten-free unless
it specifically says “wheat maltodextrin” or “maltodextrin (wheat).”
 Modified food starch
 Mono- and diglycerides
 Starch (in food)
 Vanilla and vanilla extract
 Vinegar (except malt vinegar)
 Wheat grass
 Yeast (except brewer’s yeast)
Pharmaceuticals don’t have the same labeling requirements that foods have.
Some ingredients, like starch, for instance, can contain gluten, and it may not
be indicated. For pharmaceuticals that have questionable ingredients listed,
you’ll need to call the manufacturer (I outline how to do this later in the
chapter) or consult a trusted source to know whether it’s gluten-free.
Gluten-free guidelines in North America might be different from those in
other countries. The gluten-free status of ingredients listed in this book refers
to ingredients produced in the U.S. and Canada.
Knowing which foods to question
Someday, all gluten-free foods will be clearly labeled as such, and there won’t
be any “questionable” foods. For now, though, you need to question some
ingredients before deciding if they’re safe for you to eat.
Most of these ingredients rarely contain gluten, but according to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), they can contain
gluten, which means you need to dig a little deeper to know for sure if they’re
okay for you to eat. Some of the ingredients you should question include
 Brown rice syrup
 Fillers
 Flavors and natural flavorings
47
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

 Seasonings and spice blends
 Stabilizers
 Starch (in pharmaceuticals)
 Yeast (it might be brewer’s yeast)
Sometimes brewer’s yeast is a byproduct of beer. In that case, it’s not
considered gluten-free. Nutritional supplements that have brewer’s 
yeast in them, though, are sometimes made from sugar, in which case
they’re okay.
Some foods fall into the questionable category because of contamination
issues. For example, oats don’t have any gluten, but they’re often contami-
nated in the manufacturing process. We recommend that you avoid them
unless you can buy certified contamination-free, gluten-free oats grown in
dedicated facilities with no possible risk of cross-contamination. The label
will actually say “gluten-free oats.” Unfortunately, only a few manufacturers
produce gluten-free oats, so they’re kind of hard to find, and, frankly, a little
pricey. Try your local natural food stores and online sources.
Getting to Know Gluten-Free Alternatives
Even if you weren’t cooking gluten-free, we’d suggest you give these gluten-
free ingredients a go. Not only are they acceptable substitutes for wheat, rye,
and barley, but they also offer unique flavors, textures, colors, and character-
istics that you don’t find in rice, corn, and other flours commonly found in
the typical diet. Furthermore, many of them are loaded with nutrition, and
they fill you up like a starchy wheat product might.
Lots of people call these grains, but most of them aren’t actually grains.
They’re flowers or fruits. The following sections take a closer look at some of
these alternative grains, starches, and cereals. We cover the nutritional
values of these foods in Chapter 4.
Amaranth
A staple of the Aztec culture, this relative of pigweed and cockscomb is
loaded with fiber, iron, calcium, other vitamins and minerals, and amino
acids, including lysine, which isn’t found in most grains. Amaranth is an
excellent source of protein (16 percent) and has a pleasant peppery and
nutty flavor. The beadlike amaranth seeds should always be cooked before
eating. Amaranth can be milled, toasted, popped like popcorn, eaten like hot
cereal, or used in soups and granolas. You also can cook its leaves and eat
them as greens.
48
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Arrowroot
You may remember the name arrowroot from the baby food aisle. Arrowroot
biscuits are one of the first solid foods babies can safely eat (but beware:
manufacturers usually add wheat flour to arrowroot biscuits, so they’re not
gluten-free). With a look and texture similar to cornstarch, arrowroot is an
herb thought to soothe the stomach and have antidiarrheal effects (that’s
music to many people’s ears when they have an intolerance to gluten 
and are used to — ahem — making quick trips to the bathroom). In cooking,
arrowroot makes a great substitute for cornstarch and can be used to 
thicken soups, sauces, and confections.
Buckwheat/groats/kasha
Boy, this one causes me grief. People think I’m off my rocker when I tell them
that buckwheat is gluten-free. Yeah, I know — it has the word wheat in its
name, but buckwheat isn’t even remotely related to wheat. It’s a fruit, high in
B vitamins, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, zinc, and all
eight essential amino acids (amino acids the body doesn’t produce but needs
to keep functioning), making it a more complete protein than many other
plant sources. It’s also a good source of linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid,
and is the only grain known to have high levels of ruti, an antioxidant that
reportedly improves circulation and prevents LDL cholesterol (the bad kind)
from blocking blood vessels.
Also known as kasha and groats, buckwheat boasts a hearty, earthy flavor.
Most of the time it’s ground into a gritty, dark flour, and used to make soba
noodles, pancakes, or other baked goods. Some people cook it like rice, 
boiling 1 cup of buckwheat in 2 cups of water.
49
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?
Separating the wheat from the 
gaffe: You’ll make mistakes!
Because sorting out what’s okay and what’s not
may be more difficult than you may have thought,
you will make mistakes in the process. That’s
okay. You’ll make mistakes from time to time not
because you’re lazy, dumb, or subconsciously
trying to sabotage your intestines — it’s because
you’re human, and figuring out all of the gluten-
free facts can be really tough!
We’re not suggesting that you slip and slide your
way through the diet, but accidentally ingesting
a little glob of gluten is no reason to panic, nor do
you need to call 911. Gluten insensitivity isn’t like
a peanut allergy that can throw you into anaphy-
lactic shock. If you accidentally have a shot of
the wrong soy sauce or piece of pizza crust,
learn from your mistakes and keep practicing
until the diet becomes a way of life.

Although there are pure, gluten-free soba noodles and pancake mixes made
from buckwheat, read the labels! Some forms of these products also contain
wheat flour.
Garfava
Garfava is the name of a commercial blend of flours made by a company
called Authentic Foods. Normally I wouldn’t put a specialty item in a list like
this, but garfava has become such a common gluten-free flour that it’s fea-
tured in many cookbooks. This mixture of chickpea (garbanzo beans) and
fava bean flours is high in protein, low in fat, and rich in fiber. Its unique nutty
taste adds extra flavor to quick breads, muffins, cakes, veggie burgers, and
coatings for chicken and fish.
Job’s Tears
Job’s Tears is also referred to as coix seed, adlay, or adlai — yeah, like that
helps at all! Job’s Tears is a tall, tropical plant that produces a grain that’s
gluten-free.
Popular in Asia, Job’s Tears is often dried and cooked as a grain like rice or
barley, and it has a similar flavor to barley. People in Korea and China use it
to make distilled liquors, or as a tea, sometimes by powdering the grain itself
and mixing it with hot water; other times, the whole grains are simmered in
water and then mixed with sugar. Job’s Tears are said to have medicinal prop-
erties, helping with gastrointestinal disorders, painful joints, rheumatism,
and edema.
Some Asian supermarkets sell Job’s Tears as Chinese pearl barley — but it’s
not. And don’t worry, Job’s Tears isn’t even closely related to barley — if it
were, there might be a question about whether it’s gluten-free, but there’s no
question at all.
Mesquite (pinole)
Mesquite — for me, it conjures images of a barbecued, smoky-sweet flavor.
But it’s also a tree that produces bean pods, which can be dried and ground
into flour. It adds a sweet, nutty taste that bears a hint of molasses, and is
even used to make jelly, wine, and juice. With soluble fibers that slow the
absorption of nutrients and its low glycemic index, mesquite is helpful in con-
trolling blood sugar levels. Its sweet pods and seeds are a good source of
fiber, calcium, manganese, iron, zinc, protein, and lysine.

Millet
Some might say that millet is for the birds — that’s because it’s the grain
found in most bird feeders. But it’s good for humans, too! Millet is actually a
grass — with a small seed that grows in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.
Packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, millet is also loaded
with fiber, protein, and B-complex vitamins. This easily digested, extremely
nutritious seed has been a staple food in Africa and India for thousands of
years. In parts of India today, millet flour is combined with sorghum flour to
make a common bread called bhakri.
Millet is a small, round grain that has a mild, yet nutty flavor, especially if you
toast it in a dry skillet for about three minutes. Add millet to soups for extra
body, or mix it with brown rice or quinoa to add unique flavors and textures.
Millet can be cooked like other grains, using 1 cup of millet to 21⁄2 cups of
water. You can use less water for a crunchier flavor or more for a consistency
more like mashed potatoes.
Montina (Indian ricegrass)
Montina is actually a trademarked name by a company called Amazing
Grains. Montina is a type of flour made from Indian ricegrass, which was a
dietary staple of Native Americans more than 7,000 years ago and today is
native to Montana. Loaded with fiber and protein, this bold-flavored grain
was a good substitute when maize crops failed or game was in short supply.
Because Montina is a brand name, it comes with a recipe booklet. Because it
tastes like wheat and has a hearty texture, it makes a good replacement for
regular flour in baking.
Quinoa (hie)
Pronounced keen-wah, ancient Incas considered quinoa sacred and referred to
it as “the mother of all grains” — but it’s actually a fruit. Unlike other grains
like wheat or rice, quinoa has a balanced set of essential amino acids and is a
complete protein. It’s especially high in lysine, an amino acid that most grains
lack. Also high in phosphorous, calcium, iron, vitamin E, assorted B vitamins,
and fiber, quinoa is exceptionally nutritious. Although quinoa is usually pale
yellow, it also comes in pink, orange, red, purple, and black.
Quinoa can be cooked like rice, using 1 cup of the grain to 2 cups of water.
You can also throw raw quinoa into soups to thicken and add an interesting
texture, or use cooked quinoa under chili or as you would a rice dish. Quinoa
flours and pastas are also available, giving you more options for gluten-free
variations on gluten-containing favorites.
51
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

Quinoa has a coating called saponin, which is bitter. But the quinoa we buy
has been processed, and the coating has been removed. By the way, that
bitter coating may be what makes quinoa such a durable crop. It’s likely that
the birds and insects that can devastate a crop find the coating too bitter and
leave it alone. Attempts to grow quinoa with less of the coating have resulted
in crops that are decimated.
Ragi
Ragi is also referred to as finger millet and is grown as a cereal in the arid
areas of Africa and Asia. It’s especially valuable nutrient-wise, because it has
the amino acid methionine, which is lacking in areas where poverty forces
people to live on starchy staples like cassava, rice, plantain, or corn meal.
Ragi is often ground and cooked into cakes, puddings, or porridge, and is
made into a beer-type drink in many parts of Africa.
Rice
Rice is a common staple in the gluten-free diet because people tend to think
of starches as rice, corn, potatoes, and wheat. With wheat off the menu, 
they turn to rice, corn, and potatoes. Not all rice is created equally, though.
White rice has most of the good stuff (germ and bran), nutritionally speaking,
removed. Brown rice is a whole grain and far more nutritious than white. 
By the way, wild rice isn’t rice at all! It’s the seed of an aquatic grass, grown
primarily in Minnesota.
Contrary to what you might guess, glutinous rice doesn’t have gluten! 
Made from high-starch, short-grain rice, glutinous rice thickens sauces and
desserts in Asian cooking and is the rice most commonly used in sushi.
(Remember, no soy sauce or fake crab in your sushi!)
Sorghum
Also known as milo, this gluten-free insoluble fiber is probably best known
for the syrup that comes from one of its varieties. Because sorghum’s protein
and starch are more slowly digested than that of other cereals, it may be 
beneficial to diabetics. Sorghum’s bland flavor and light color don’t change
the taste or look of foods when it’s used instead of wheat flour.
52
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Soy
Soy is actually a legume, not a grain. It’s commonly used in the gluten-free
diet because people know it’s gluten-free and it’s accessible. Usually, it’s
mixed with other flours — but beware: It has a strong, distinctive flavor.
Either you love it or you don’t, and after you’ve added it, there’s no 
going back.
There are plenty of ways to incorporate soy into your diet. You can use soy
milk or yogurt, flour, or tofu, each of which offers a huge variety of cooking
options. For soy milk and yogurt, you can simply substitute the soy variety
for dairy products. Soy flour can be mixed with other flours and used in
baked goods, and tofu can be fried, baked, or grilled.
Tapioca (gari, cassava, casaba, 
manioc, yucca)
Think there are enough names for tapioca? Well, tapioca by any other name 
is still tapioca. Most people think of tapioca pudding when they think of 
tapioca. And, unless someone gets really freaky with their recipe, tapioca
pudding is gluten-free! But the flour is used in a lot of gluten-free recipes, too.
Basically, it doesn’t have any flavor, which is a good thing sometimes (see the
flavor description for soy!). Because it’s flavorless, tapioca flour or starch
makes a great thickener for sauces, gravies, soups, stews, puddings, and pies.
Tapioca gives a glossy sheen and can tolerate prolonged cooking and freez-
ing. Tapioca is native to South America, so if you visit there, you’ll find lots of
great tapioca (manioc) breads that are gluten-free!
Taro root
Most people know taro as the ingredient in the Hawaiian dish poi. Also called
kalo, taro is a starchy tuber vegetable much like a potato, and it’s rich in 
vitamins and minerals. The leaves are a good source of thiamin, riboflavin,
iron, phosphorus, and zinc — and also vitamin B6, vitamin C, niacin, potas-
sium, copper, and manganese. They’re also a great source of fiber. In its raw
form, taro is toxic because it has calcium oxalate, but cooking destroys the
toxin, so it’s safe for consumption. Like potatoes, taro roots can be fried,
baked, roasted, boiled, or steamed.
53
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

Teff (tef)
This nutritional powerhouse is the smallest of the grains that aren’t true
cereal grains. It’s actually a grass with a seed that looks (and cooks) a lot like
quinoa and millet, but it’s smaller. An important food in Ethiopia, teff is used
to make a common bread called injera (but beware: Most injera has wheat
flour, too). Teff packs a protein content of nearly 12 percent and is five times
richer in calcium, iron, and potassium than any other grain. Its sweet, nutty
flavor makes teff flour a delicious additive to baked goods, or you can cook
the whole grain and serve it with sliced fruit or as a breakfast cereal.
Reading Labels and Getting Answers
(Most of the Time)
It should be so simple — if a product is gluten-free, it should say so, 
right? Sure. It would list the ingredients, and right there in big, bold letters, 
it would say, “This product is 100 percent gluten-free, no ifs, ands, or buts.”
Fortunately, labeling laws are headed that direction, but we’re not quite 
there yet.
The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 required
clear labeling of all foods that contain any of the top eight allergens — wheat,
milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and soybeans. Because of this
act, manufacturers must clearly identify wheat and all of its derivatives on
food labels. With this act in place, knowing which foods are definitely off-
limits because they contain wheat is much easier.
Although wheat and its derivatives are called out on all labels, you still 
need to watch for other gluten-containing grains (barley, rye, and cross-
contaminated oats) and their derivatives, and realize that they can be (but
often aren’t) hidden in flavorings and additives. And remember that you
won’t see “gluten-free” on the label — at least not yet — but you don’t really
need to. (A new law is in the works; you’ll find out more about it in the 
next section.)
Getting the hang of the gluten-free diet means you’ll have to memorize 
ingredients you’ve never heard of. And yes, even though this is a cookbook
and you’ll be working with ingredients rather than prepared foods, you’ll still
have to read the labels on the ingredients you use.
54
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Labeling gluten-free: The law 
and what it means
My friend Cynthia Kupper, Executive Director of the Gluten Intolerance Group
of North America, has helped me write this section explaining the United
States Food and Drug Administration’s new guidelines for labeling food prod-
ucts gluten-free. These guidelines are still being finalized at the time of this
writing and are a welcome advancement in gluten-free labeling for consumers. 
Defining “gluten-free” gives consumers more information and set a standard
that manufacturers will have to meet before they can label their products as
such. Use of the “gluten-free” label will be voluntary, but the FDA will enforce
its requirements on those who choose to use it.
Defining what a “gluten-free” label means
“Gluten-free” will most likely be defined as follows:
 A food cannot contain a prohibited grain (wheat, rye, barely, and
hybrids of these grains)
or
 If a food contains a prohibitive grains, it must show that the grain has
been altered to remove the protein (generally a chemical process to
remove protein and purify the starch or oil)
and
 The finished product (as it will be sold) cannot contain more than 20
ppm (parts per million) of gluten. A company can prove this by testing
for gluten in their products. Other tests can prove the lack of protein in
a food. When there is no protein, there is no gluten.
If a product can meet the above criteria, it can carry the words “gluten-free”
on the label.
Twenty parts per million refers to the level of gluten which is known to 
be very safe for persons with celiac disease. This level is generally set 3 times
lower than what research shows is safe, making it virtually impossible to 
ever consume that amount of gluten daily from products labeled gluten-
free. It is a very small amount. An example of 20 ppm is 1 tsp of cream in 
65 gallons of milk.
“Wheat-free” doesn’t necessarily mean “gluten-free.” Remember that gluten
includes wheat, rye, and barley — so something can be wheat-free and still
contain malt flavoring derived from barley, for instance.
55
Chapter 3: What’s Gluten-Free and What Isn’t?

Labeled requirements
Labeling a product gluten-free is voluntary. No manufacturer will be required
to include the labeling on their products; however, if they do, they must
prove the product meets the definition. The law will also include information
on the following:
 If a ‘naturally gluten-free product,’ such as 100% orange juice, chooses 
to carry a gluten-free label - it must say that all 100% orange juice is
gluten-free.
 Not all oats can be labeled gluten-free. They must be able to prove that
they meet the definition, including containing less than 20 ppm.
Gluten-free certification
A progressive certification program with an easily recognized logo is making
it easier to identify gluten-free foods. The Certified Gluten-Free logo stands
for the independent verification of quality, integrity, and purity of products.
Products carrying the Certified Gluten-Free logo represent unmatched 
reliability for meeting strict gluten-free, science-based standards.
56
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 
Advisory labels: Sometimes more 
(information) is less (helpful)
You’ve seen the advisory labels: “This product
manufactured in a facility that produces wheat”;
it’s right next to the “gluten-free” designation. Or,
“This product made on shared equipment that
also processes wheat ingredients.” What about
the labels that say “gluten-free” and then say
“This product may contain wheat”? Huh?
Companies are trying to be helpful (and to cover
their hineys liability-wise), but sometimes the
extra information adds to the confusion.
So what do you do if a product says it’s gluten-
free but manufactured in a facility that produces
wheat products? There’s not an easy answer.
The truth of the matter is that all manufacturers
in North America have good manufacturing 
policies (GMPs) that require them to thoroughly
clean all equipment between product lines. In
other words, if they make a gluten-containing
product and then the next product on the line is
gluten-free, they have to clean all equipment
really well before making the change.
Is there a chance that a tiny particle of gluten
could get left behind on the manufacturing line?
Yes. Is there a chance that you’ll buy the box of
cereal that contains that little bit of gluten? Sure.
Is there a chance that you, the celiac in the
family, will be the one to eat that little gluten par-
ticle (and the surrounding particles that have
been contaminated)? Yep. Admittedly, those
chances are remote.

Manufacturers requesting this gluten-free certification are inspected by the
Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) (www.gfco.org), the only
gluten-free certification program in the world. The GFCO, a program of the
Gluten Intolerance Group (GIG), was developed in cooperation with Food
Services Inc., a subsidiary of the Orthodox Union (OU), the world’s largest
and oldest kosher certification agency. The OU’s nearly 500 field representa-
tives, proficient in modern food-production techniques and chemical and 
biological processes, conduct plant inspections and review products for 
the GFCO.
Certification is an annual process based on ingredient review, on-site 
inspection, and product testing. Gluten-free certification is established for
each ingredient in the final product, as well as the processing aids. The 
mark assures that the product contains less than 10 parts per million of
gluten and similar proteins from rye and barley.
Contacting manufacturers
“Hello, does your product contain gluten?”
Don’t feel awkward asking that question. Food manufacturers hear it all the
time these days. Many manufacturers often voluntarily identify the ingredi-
ents in their products in very clear terms. For example, instead of saying
“modified food starch,” they’re listing the specific type of starch as “modified
corn starch.” The same is true with vegetable oils. Instead of “hydrolyzed 
vegetable oil,” the packaging now shows the specific type of oil, such as
“hydrolyzed corn oil.” And certainly, because of the Food Allergen Labeling
and Consumer Protection Act of January 2004, if the ingredient is derived
from wheat, it must clearly be identified as such.
However, if you have any doubts, don’t hesitate to call the manufacturer.
People sometimes think that if they read labels they don’t need to call the
manufacturer, but that’s not always true. If you find something questionable
on a product label, or if you just want to be extra-sure that the product is
gluten-free, call a manufacturer and ask. Today’s manufacturers understand
the gluten-free concept, and they know what you’re talking about.
Contacting manufacturers is a lot easier than it used to be. Most packaging
includes the manufacturer’s toll-free number, or if you’re having a hard time
locating a manufacturer’s contact information, you can always look online. Do

O
kay, I realize this is a cookbook, and you just want to dive into the
recipes to start whipping up your soon-to-be-famous gluten-free
gastrolicious goodies. But wouldn’t you feel better about gorging down
the goodies if you knew they were good for you? It’s not too tough to eat a
healthier diet if you know what’s nutritious and what isn’t. The problem is,
even people who think they know often don’t.
Nutritious food is more underappreciated than the parent of a teen. But even
teenagers appreciate parents more than most people appreciate food for 
the value it provides. No, I’m not talking about the so-stuffed-you-can’t-move
feeling you get from pizza and beer. And for those of you who consider 
yourselves to be health food fanatics because you use skim milk on your
frosted flakes, I’m not talking about that, either.
I’m talking about the valuable things food offers — taste, fulfillment, satisfac-
tion, and — oh yeah — nutrients.
Food is obviously essential — without it, we’d starve to death. But the 
types of foods we eat have powerful effects on preventing disease; maintain-
ing proper organ function, energy levels, moods, appearance, and athleticism;
and even influencing our longevity and how we age. Everything about how we
look and feel is directly related to the foods we eat.

You can do the gluten-free diet at least two ways — one is extremely healthy,
and the other isn’t quite as optimal. Either way, you’re cooking gluten-free,
and that’s a good thing — but if you’re interested in taking a more nutritious
approach to being gluten-free, this chapter’s for you.
In this chapter, I take a look at some foods you may have thought were 
nutritious but aren’t — and I explore some foods you may never have heard
of that pack a powerful nutritional punch. I offer tips for weight management
and energy enhancement, and I give an overview of the optimal diet, which
just happens to be entirely gluten-free!
Feeling Optimal Requires 
Optimum Nutrition
Sure, you’ve heard the expression, “you are what you eat.” But what does
that mean, really? I eat a lot of apples, and I’m not an apple. I think it really
should be said that, “your quality of health is dependent upon the quality of
food you eat” — but I realize that’s not so catchy, and it’s tough to grasp.
Few people would argue the fact that you need to eat a nutritious diet — 
the problem is that most people don’t know what that means. And when
you’re eating gluten-free, there are special considerations when striving for
optimal nutrition.
Fueling versus filling
Lots of people have used the car analogy to explain nutrition. They tell you
that to get maximum performance from your vehicle, you have to use high-
quality gas — and to get maximum performance from your body, you have 
to give it high-quality foods.
There are a few problems with that analogy: The first problem is that most
people don’t know what high-quality foods are! How can you put “good fuel”
in your body when you don’t really know what good fuel is? The second 
problem with the car-body analogy is that most people put crummy gas in
their cars and their cars run just fine, so they figure they can get away with
putting crummy gas in their bodies, and they’ll run just fine too — albeit a
little gassy from time to time.
60
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

What they don’t realize is that you can get away with putting crummy gas 
in an average car — but our bodies aren’t your average car. Our bodies are
finely tuned, high-performance vehicles. You put crummy gas into a Ferrari,
and you’re going to find it knocks and pings (gas and bloating), doesn’t start
as easily (tough time getting out of bed?), doesn’t go as fast (lethargic), the
engine doesn’t burn as cleanly (constipation), it shoots out more exhaust
(fartola), and the engine wears out faster (uh oh — need I say more?).
The last problem with the analogy revolves around individual sensitivities.
Imagine now that you do know what good fuel is, and that you have pulled
into an exclusive gas station that brags of having the highest-quality gasoline
from one of the world’s best refineries. It should be free of anything that
might cause harm to your engine, right? Not necessarily. What if you’re 
driving a diesel-powered car? Just a few minutes running with that “high-
quality” gasoline, and your diesel car would be dead. In this case, the gas is
good — it’s just the wrong fuel type for your car.
We should eat to fuel, not to fill.
Getting enough nutrients 
when you’re gluten-free
Over the years, many people have claimed that the gluten-free diet is 
deficient in a variety of nutrients. Their reasoning comes from the fact that
flour is generally enriched with vitamins. When we stop eating flour, we’re
missing that fortification and the supplemental nutrients it provides.
You can probably guess how I feel about that argument. If you follow the
“healthy” approach to the gluten-free diet as described in this chapter, you
get a nutritionally sound diet.
If you go gluten-free the unhealthy way — simply substituting gluten-free
goodies for the breads, bagels, pizzas, pastas, cookies, cakes, and pretzels
that you were eating before — then there’s some merit to the claim that 
the gluten-free diet may have some nutritional deficiencies, because you
won’t have the advantage of the enrichment found in most products made
with flour.
If you want more detail on nutrition, and specifically how it relates to the
gluten-free diet, check out Living Gluten-Free For Dummies (Wiley). In this
book, I just cover the basics — because this is, after all, a cookbook!
61
Chapter 4: Making Nutrition Your Mission When You’re Cooking Gluten-Free

Fiber
Getting enough fiber in your diet can be an issue in gluten-free diets. 
Gluten-free flours, such as rice and tapioca, don’t offer much fiber and can
cause associated problems.
The best source of fiber is fresh fruits and veggies. Broccoli, for instance, pro-
vides 25 percent of your daily fiber needs in just 1 cup. Not to mention it has
200 percent of the daily recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for vitamin
C, 90 percent of the daily RDA for vitamin A in the form of beta carotene, and
lots of niacin, calcium, thiamin, and phosphorus. All this for only 45 calories!
Other nutrients
People who have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease often become sick and
malnourished as a result. They usually have compromised digestion and
absorption that may result in nutritional deficiencies, the most common of
which are iron, essential fatty acids, vitamins D and K, calcium, magnesium,
and folic acid. It may be wise to seek the help of a professional to ensure 
adequate nutrition.
Some people believe that no matter how healthy your diet is, it’s still impor-
tant to take supplements. This reasoning is generally based on the fact that
food isn’t as nutritious as it used to be. Soils are becoming depleted of impor-
tant nutrients, so the crops grown in them are less nutrient-dense than they
once were. Furthermore, chemicals and genetically modified foods are chang-
ing the nutritional composition of even the most wholesome foods. For these
reasons, many people believe that supplementation is key to getting all the
nutrients you need, especially if you take part in athletic endeavors or 
exercise heavily.
If you’re an athlete and are interested in learning about recommended sup-
plementation, I recommend a book by Dr. Michael Colgan called Sports
Nutrition Guide.
Choosing a Healthier Approach 
to the Gluten-Free Diet
Sometimes people do the math wrong. They know that I believe that gluten-
free is the way to be. And they know I have a passion for nutrition. Therefore,
they add it up and conclude, erroneously, that gluten-free must be nutritious.
But that’s not always true.
There are two ways to go on the gluten-free diet: one is ultra-healthy, and the
other is — well, not — and not even close.
62
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

The unhealthy way
For simplicity sake, and to mess with my editors who like things to go in 
the order I’ve referred to them, let’s start with the last category — the gluten-
free diet that isn’t so healthy. This is the version of being gluten-free that
could be called the “substitution diet.” People continue to eat all the normal
foods they ate before — breads, bagels, cookies, cakes, pizza, crackers, and
pretzels — but they eat the gluten-free version. Sometimes people who do
this actually end up eating more junk than they did when they were eating
gluten because they use the gluten-free goodies to help them get over their
“I’m feeling deprived and restricted” thoughts.
Suffice it to say I’m not a fan of this variety of gluten-free eating. As a matter
of fact, it’s not just “not healthy,” but it’s downright unhealthy. Those foods,
with or without gluten, offer very little in the way of nutritional value — 
they do little more than pack on the pounds and wreak havoc with your
blood-sugar levels (which we talk about later in this chapter).
The healthy way
The healthier approach to eating gluten-free is simple: If man made it, 
don’t eat it.
In other words, stick to the natural foods that our bodies were designed to
eat: lean meats, seafood and fish, fruits, veggies, nuts, and berries. These
foods are healthiest for us because our bodies were designed to eat them —
it’s not surprising to me that they’re all naturally gluten-free, as well, because
our bodies weren’t designed to eat gluten. Sticking to natural, healthy foods
is a win-win!
I didn’t “invent” this diet — in fact, there’s a lot of information about this
approach, which is usually referred to as the Paleolithic diet. That’s because
this diet is based on eating the foods that our hunter-gatherer ancestors 
ate in Paleolithic times (before the Agricultural Revolution). They didn’t eat
wheat — there wasn’t any. They didn’t eat grains or dairy — it just didn’t
exist. Our bodies weren’t designed to eat those things, which is why so many
people have intolerances to them.
By the way, it’s pretty easy to see why our Paleolithic ancestors didn’t do
milk. First, picture them catching a wild boar — what then? It begs the 
question, “How many cavemen does it take to milk a wild boar?”
You may be thinking that with some scary (and hairy) exceptions, today’s
humans don’t really resemble cavemen, so this line of reasoning about 
eating what our ancestors ate isn’t relevant — but you’d be mistaken. DNA 
evidence shows that genetically, humans have hardly changed at all in the 
last 40,000 years.
63
Chapter 4: Making Nutrition Your Mission When You’re Cooking Gluten-Free

Watching Your Blood Sugar
Some people figure they don’t need to worry about their blood sugar levels
because they don’t eat sweets. Not true! For one thing, lots of foods that
aren’t in the sweets category at all can mess with your blood sugar levels.
Potatoes, for instance — they’re killers when it comes to blood sugar! We’ll
talk more about specific foods and how they affect your blood sugar levels
later in this section, but first, what does it mean, and why does it matter?
The term blood sugar refers to how much glucose is in the blood. Glucose is
the body’s primary source of energy, so it’s important stuff. But it has to stay
in just the right range — not too high and not too low — or it can cause prob-
lems. The body uses hormones called insulin and glucagon to regulate blood
sugar levels, but sometimes the body just can’t keep up, often because the
foods we’re eating cause blood sugar levels to rise too much. Diabetes melli-
tus is an example of a disease related to the failure of blood sugar regulation.
Blood sugar levels also affect hunger and cravings. Foods that cause your
blood sugar to go up quickly (and then come down quickly) cause you to get
hungry, even when you shouldn’t be. This is only one of the many reasons
high glycemic index foods (I explain exactly what those are in the
“Understanding the glycemic index of foods” section) result in weight gain.
For more detail on how blood sugar affects hunger and weight gain, check
out Living Gluten-Free For Dummies.

A blast from the past for nutrition that lasts
They may have been a little stinky, but our
Paleolithic ancestors were remarkably healthy.
They were lean, fit, and didn’t get the plethora of
diseases that we get today. In fact, anthropolog-
ical studies show they were lean, had good aer-
obic capacity, low cholesterol, low blood
pressure, and better insulin metabolism. Health-
wise, they rank right up there with today’s elite
and highly trained athletes.
In contrast, most of today’s humans are a mess.
We eat too much, we eat the wrong foods, we’re
fat, and we have lots and lots of diseases, some
of which we’re inventing as we go. More people
are overweight than aren’t, and it’s killing us.
Heart and blood-vessel disease is a leading
killer; high blood pressure, high cholesterol, dia-
betes, and obesity are all epidemic.
Tip: You can find lots of detailed information
about the Paleolithic diet on the Internet by
doing a quick search on your favorite search
engine.

Moving beyond rice, corn, and potatoes
When adopting a gluten-free lifestyle, people tend to turn to starchy, 
fill-me-up standbys like rice, corn, and potatoes. People seek these out partly
because they are starchy foods, a replacement of sorts for the bread, pasta,
and bagels we’re accustomed to eating when we eat gluten.
So what’s the problem with substituting these standbys? They’re gluten-free,
so they should be fine, right? Well, they’re fine from a gluten-free standpoint.
But they’re pretty much void of nutrients, at least compared to some of the
nutritional powerhouses that you could be eating.
See, not all carbs are created equal. Fruits and veggies are great. But rice,
corn, potatoes, and refined wheat are all high glycemic load foods. High 
gly-huh? We’ll talk more about what that means in the next section.
For now, all you need to know about high glycemic foods is that they mess
with your blood sugar levels, which is especially dangerous for people with
diabetes. They also can pack on the pounds almost faster than you can eat
them, which is one reason many people who go gluten-free experience weight
gain (to find out how to combat the gluten-free gain, check out the “Managing
Your Weight When You’re Gluten-Free” section later in this chapter).
Understanding the glycemic index of foods
The glycemic index (GI) is a way to measure how much effect a particular
food will have on our blood sugar levels. The higher the glycemic index, the
more quickly that food is broken down during the digestion process, and 
the more quickly blood glucose levels will rise. Carbohydrates that break
down slowly release glucose into the blood stream more gradually and have 
a lower glycemic index.

Chapter 4: Making Nutrition Your Mission When You’re Cooking Gluten-Free
Gluten-free fights Father Time
Can gluten-free make wrinkles flee? Possibly!
According to many experts, gluten-free is the
way to be if you’re trying to turn back the wrin-
kled hands of time or stave off symptoms of
menopause. Anti-aging specialists often tell
patients to avoid wheat, and especially refined
flours, to improve the quality of skin and erase
wrinkles. One of the best known experts in 
his field, Dr. Nicholas Perricone, maintains 
that wheat and other high glycemic load foods
provoke an inflammatory response that causes
our skin to age more quickly. He says that avoid-
ing foods like wheat can actually help reverse
the aging process.
Wheat-based foods are also implicated in symp-
toms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night
sweats, headaches, fatigue, and mood swings.
Patients are often advised to give up wheat to
alleviate menopausal symptoms.

The glycemic index really just concerns foods that are high in carbohydrates.
Foods that are high in fat or protein don’t have as much of an effect on your
blood glucose levels.
The glycemic index is sometimes categorized into three classes: low,
medium, and high. Table 4-1 shows GI ranges and some examples:
Table 4-1
Glycemic Index Ranges
Classification
GI Range
Examples
Low GI
55 or less
Most fruit and vegetables (except potatoes),
quinoa, and most other alternative grains
Medium GI
56–69
Orange juice, some pastas, some brown rices
High GI
70 or more
White bread, baked potato, most white rices,
pizza, crackers, bagels, beer
A food’s glycemic index may change depending on how it’s prepared and
what’s eaten with it.
Unfortunately, a food’s glycemic index won’t be listed on the label. You can
find glycemic index tables for specific foods by searching for “glycemic index
(food name)” on your favorite search engine. Not all foods are listed, but
many are, and it’s a great start for understanding which foods cause your
blood sugar to soar, and which ones don’t.
A great book on the subject of blood sugar and its importance in maintaining
overall health is The New Sugar Busters! by H. Leighton Steward (Ballantine).
66
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 
Higher glycemic index isn’t always a bad thing
Sometimes people want a quick rise in their
blood sugar. Serious athletes often pay close
attention to the glycemic index of foods they eat
so they can have optimal energy available when
they need it.
Usually before a competition they’ll eat foods
with a lower glycemic index so that energy is
released more slowly.
During a competition they may try to eat a bal-
ance of high and low GI foods; the low GI foods
will provide sustained energy, and the high GI
foods will provide a quick burst.
When they’re finished, athletes will often eat
high GI foods to quickly restore depleted energy
stores.

Relating a gluten-free diet 
to the glycemic index
Gluten-containing foods like bread, bagels, pizza, pasta, cookies, cakes, and
pretzels are super-high on the glycemic index. When you cut those things out
of your diet, you’re eliminating high GI foods that offer little in the way of
nutritional value.
Now keep in mind that if you replace those things with their gluten-free 
counterparts — like gluten-free bread, bagels, pizza . . . you get the picture —
then you’re back in the high glycemic ballpark. But if you choose to eat
wholesome foods like those described in this chapter as being optimal, you’ll
be eating gluten-free and healthfully!
People used to think that diabetics should avoid sugar — as in candy bars
and table sugar. But some experts now believe that the sugar isn’t as 
important as the effect that the food has on your blood sugar. In other words,
instead of simply eliminating sugar, some experts recommend that people
with diabetes should stick to a low glycemic index diet. For those people, a
gluten-free diet — the kind that includes healthy meats, seafood, fruits, and
veggies (but without the yummy gluten-free substitutions for the high
glycemic goodies like breads and cookies) — is ideal.
Choosing healthy starches for 
that “fill-me-up” feeling
As we’ve discussed, rice, corn, and potatoes aren’t your most nutritious
choices, even though they are gluten-free. You get lots of calories and little
nutrition — that’s not a good thing for anyone. But let’s face it — there’s
something to be said for that feeling of contentment you get when you eat
starchy foods like that.
So what can you eat for that fill-me-up satisfaction when you’re cooking
gluten-free but you’re focused on a healthier diet? Try these foods on for size.
They’re far more nutritious than rice, corn, and potatoes, and they’re low
glycemic index foods, too.

Chapter 4: Making Nutrition Your Mission When You’re Cooking Gluten-Free

 Sweet potatoes (or yams)
 Teff
Sometimes referred to as alternative grains, they’re not really grains at all. But
they’re delicious, they provide unique flavors and consistencies, and they’re
loaded with fiber, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. In fact, most of them
are complete proteins! (Chapter 3 gives you more information about 
these foods.)
The terms sweet potato and yam are often used interchangeably, yet the two
are very different. It doesn’t matter which one you choose, though, because
both are gluten-free, loaded with nutrients and antioxidants, and quite low 
on the glycemic index. There are even new varieties of sweet potatoes that
have purple skin and flesh! They contain anthocyanins, a powerful antioxidant
found in berries.
In staying consistent with the theme of this book, get creative! Try using 
different vegetables to replace the starchy foods you might ordinarily use.
Spaghetti squash is a great alternative for pasta. You can use strips of 
zucchini or yellow squash instead of lasagna noodles, and you can puree 
cauliflower instead of using mashed potatoes.
Managing Your Weight When 
You’re Gluten-Free
Interestingly, the gluten-free diet — when done properly — can not only 
be your key to better health, but it may also be the key to managing your
weight. In fact, it doesn’t matter if you weigh too much or too little; if you’re
not “just right,” going gluten-free may be the answer you’ve been looking for.
Losing or maintaining weight
For people who need to lose weight, there’s no simpler and more effective
way to do it than to take the Paleolithic approach we’ve been talking about in
this chapter (see the section, “The healthy way,” for more info). Sticking to
lean meats, poultry, seafood, fish, fruits, and veggies will help un-stick those
unwanted pounds.
When you go gluten-free, you eliminate refined-flour products from your 
diet — things like bagels, bread, pasta, and of course the sweet baked 
goods — and that means you’re cutting out high glycemic index foods that
offer very little in the way of nutrition, but offer more than their fair share 
of calories. That’s why people who go gluten-free the healthy way usually 
find their weight easier to maintain at healthy levels.
68
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Dealing with (uh-oh) weight gain
Some people find that they gain weight when they go gluten-free — and it’s
no wonder! Many of them are busy discovering the wonders of the gluten-free
goodie world, including gluten-free brownies, cookies, cakes, pastas, and
crackers. Those are foods that may as well be applied directly to the tummy
or thighs — because that’s where they end up pretty quickly.
These days the gluten-free goodies are delicious — and somewhat irresistible,
I suppose. But for some people, eating them is strictly emotional. They tend to
get carried away with these foods as a way of compensating for feelings of
deprivation or restriction. They believe they’re deprived because they can’t
eat gluten, so they “reward” themselves, or compensate, by eating extras of
the goodies that they can eat. Before they know it, their jeans look like they
belong to the neighbor’s kid.
Still others experience weight gain because of the physiological changes 
that take place when they go gluten-free. This group of people is comprised
of those who go gluten-free because they have celiac disease or gluten 
sensitivity. Most people with celiac disease or gluten-sensitivity don’t absorb
all of their nutrients, at least until they go 100 percent gluten-free. Lots of
these people, while they’re still eating gluten and not absorbing nutrients,
become accustomed to eating far more calories than they should, because
those calories aren’t being absorbed, so they maintain their weight in spite 
of the fact that they eat far too many calories. But it’s payback time after they
go gluten-free. Their gut begins to heal, and they begin absorbing calories —
and before they know it, they’ve packed on a pound (or 20).
Although I like to think of the gluten-free diet as the best diet on the planet,
it’s not actually the gluten-free-ness that gets the credit when we’re talking
about weight management on the gluten-free diet. It’s the fact that you’re
adhering to a high-protein, low glycemic, nutrient-dense diet. And following
this healthy diet provides health benefits that extend far beyond being
gluten-free.
69
Chapter 4: Making Nutrition Your Mission When You’re Cooking Gluten-Free
Syrup the saboteur
High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) may be gluten-
free, but it can sabotage a weight-loss program
faster than a box of old-fashioned gluten-free
glazed donuts. Two main hormones signal
hunger and appetite to your brain. Ghrelin is 
produced in the stomach, and increases your
appetite, while leptin is produced by fat cells and
tells your body it’s full. HFCS, a sugar “substitute”
(it actually is a sugar), inhibits leptin secretion so
you don’t get the “I’m full” message. It also never
shuts off ghrelin, so even if you’re stuffed, you’re
still getting an “I’m hungry” memo from your
stomach. Beware of HFCS in foods you may not
suspect, like ketchup, salad dressings, and lots
of low-fat products.

Adding some pounds if you’re underweight
If you’ve been underweight, you’re likely to find that the gluten-free diet helps
you gain enough to be at a healthy weight. I know, it sounds like I’m talking
out of both sides of my mouth — how can it help some people lose weight,
and help others gain it?
People who are underweight are often that way because they have gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease, and therefore are not absorbing important 
nutrients, including calories. That is, until they go gluten-free. Then their guts
heal, and they begin to absorb those important nutrients again. After they
start absorbing the calories they’re consuming, they usually gain the weight
they need to be at what’s considered a healthy weight.

Gluten-free — indulgently!
All this talk about good nutrition is meant to pro-
vide you with guidelines for a healthy approach
to the gluten-free lifestyle. Having made my point
about the importance of good nutrition, I think it’s
also important to point out that it’s okay to live a
little — indulge from time to time! Not in gluten,
of course — but in something yummy and deca-
dent, whatever that means to you. No matter
which approach you take to the gluten-free
lifestyle, you need to find a balance that works
for you for the long haul.

Chapter 5
Setting Up Your Kitchen 
and Pantry
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether the whole house will be gluten-free
 Preventing cross-contamination
 Filling the pantry with appropriate ingredients
 Relying on the right appliances
I
know you’re the cooking type and you’re eager to get started, and this is 
a cookbook after all, but it’s a good idea to take some time to set up your
kitchen and pantry, just to make things easier (and safer) on yourself down
the road.
If your entire kitchen is already gluten-free, you’re excused to skip to another
chapter. But if you’re going to have a shared kitchen where glutenous and
gluten-free foods coexist, you’ll have to take some important steps to 
eliminate the risk of glutenation (for those of you new to my books, that’s
DannaSpeak for gluten contamination).
Never fear, though. Although eliminating the risk of glutenation isn’t a
“simple” modification, it’s “simply” a modification. In this chapter, I take 
you through the steps to ensuring a safe environment for your gluten-free
cooking. You discover how to set up a shared kitchen for gluten-eaters as 
well as non-gluten-eaters, and how to choose appliances that can simplify
your life.

To Be or Not To Be 100 
Percent Gluten-Free
To clarify, I’m talking about modifying your kitchen, not your lifestyle. 
If you have celiac disease, let me make it clear that I condone a 100 percent
gluten-free lifestyle. Even if you don’t have celiac disease, I still believe that
gluten-free is the way to be — and 100 percent is best of all.
But even if you’re 100 percent gluten-free, it doesn’t mean your kitchen has 
to be. So before you lift that ladle, touch that Tupperware, or start pulling 
the pantry apart, you first need to decide whether it’s going to be some or
none for you and your food. Will your whole house go gluten-free, or will 
you be mixing the fixings and cooking both ways?
In many households, when one person needs or wants to go gluten-free, the
first inclination is to make the whole house gluten-free. In fact, nearly every
cookbook author and expert in this field will tell you that the entire kitchen,
pantry, and household should be gluten-free. With serious and sincere
respect, I disagree with them, at least for the majority of people. Although
going completely gluten-free certainly can make life easier, it’s not only
unnecessary, but sometimes it’s even a bad idea.
It’s pretty rare to find an entire family that needs to be gluten-free. More 
often than not, only one family member needs to stay away from gluten for
health reasons. If you have other children or family members who don’t need
to be gluten-free and you force them to follow the diet anyway, you may
create resentment. Yes, even among adults. I’ve had more than a few e-mails
from despairing dads who stop for pizza and beer on the way home from
work because they know they’re not allowed to indulge in gluten at home.
The next couple of reasons I don’t recommend an entirely gluten-free house-
hold (unless, of course, all family members need to be on a gluten-free diet)
concern kids who are gluten-free.
 Children need to learn how to make the right choices. Kids raised in
an entirely gluten-free household never have to make a choice — which
means they never learn to make a choice: Is this food okay to eat? If all
the food is gluten-free, that thought process — which really needs to
become an unconscious decision later in life — is never required. As the
parent of a gluten-free kid, I speak from experience when I say that I
believe it’s critical for kids to have gluten in the house and know how to
make those decisions for themselves.
 Kids need to learn that the world isn’t a gluten-free place. Children
who grow up in an entirely gluten-free household can develop a false
sense of reality, and may even assume a sense of entitlement. The child
72
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

may believe that everyone else should stock his favorite foods, and
everyone else should be gluten-free, too. Kids need to know that the rest
of the world eats gluten. That doesn’t mean people are trying to hurt
their feelings or leave them out; it’s just the way it is. Isn’t it important
for children to learn these lessons at home, in a loving and caring 
environment? I think so!
Unfortunately, I see the opposite decision made all the time. Someone in 
the family gets diagnosed with a gluten-sensitive medical condition, and the
instant reaction is, “We’ve decided to make our whole family gluten-free!”
Sadly, that decision often leads to a negative dynamic and a resentment that
even adults can feel.
Having read all of this, if you’re still convinced that a gluten-free house 
is the route you’re going to take, you can skip the rest of this chapter and 
go straight to your favorite chapter. On the other hand, if you agree with me
that it makes more sense to have gluten in the house and to prepare both
glutenous and gluten-free meals, then keep on reading because the rest of
this chapter shows you how to simplify the process and make it fun.
Conquering Contamination Concerns
Oh, good, you’re still reading! That means I haven’t scared you away and
you’re ready to get down to business and start thinking about the single most
important challenge to maintaining your shared kitchen: containing contami-
nation risks.
I’m not talking contamination of the my-burger-has-e-coli variety (best to
avoid that, too) — I’m talking about glutenation. You know — when you have
a perfectly good gluten-free meal, and somehow, someway it gets glutenated,
and the entire meal is ruined. Kaput. Off limits. Dog food.
It can happen in the most innocent ways. A loving family member sticks a
knife laden with gluten crumbs into the mayo jar. You accidentally use the
same utensil to toss the gluten-free pasta as you used on the gluten-containing
stuff. Or someone stacks the “regular” sandwiches on top of the gluten-free
ones. Ugh.
When you keep gluten-containing foods in the house, you run the risk of cont-
amination every time you prepare a meal. Contamination issues are crucial to
consider when you’re cooking with gluten.
Even if your house is perfectly gluten-free, remember that guests can,
unknowingly, contaminate the kitchen. If they bring their own sandwich, for
instance, and add it to the stack of gluten-free goodies you’ve prepared, the
entire bunch may be ruined.

Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Kitchen and Pantry

When you’re sharing a kitchen with gluten, it can contaminate your food in
many different ways. Crumbs seem to throw themselves off gluten-containing
breads and foods, turning perfectly good gluten-free zones into danger zones
in the blink of an eye. If not cleaned well, preparation surfaces, cookware,
utensils, and storage containers can all contaminate food as well. Here are
some tips for avoiding cross-contamination by some of the most dangerous
culprits.
Keeping crumbs at bay
In a shared kitchen, crumbs are public enemy numero uno. When you’re
making a sandwich, buttering a piece of toast, or crumbling crackers into
your soup, these tiny little crumb-culprits literally fly off the food and soar
through the air.
Say you’re making a regular sandwich and a gluten-free one. You can’t make
them both at the same time on the same cutting board. Suppose you’ve 
prepared your gluten-free sandwich, and then you set it down on a counter
full of gluten-containing crumbs. What do you get? A contaminated sandwich!
From now on, you need to get into the habit of making the gluten-free version
first, then making the other, and cleaning the crumbs really well in between.
Going on a crumb vendetta is not so crucial if you make the gluten-free 
sandwich first, but it’s certainly a good habit.
Protecting jars from cross-contamination
Jars are some of the most easily contaminated items in the kitchen. Say
you’re making a slice of toast with jelly. You dip a knife into your gluten-free
jelly, then spread it on your gluten-containing toast. Then you dip the knife
back into the jar for more jelly, contaminating the whole jar with those pesky
crumbs. Next time you go to make gluten-free toast, those glutenous crumbs
are just waiting for you.
People frequently ask, “Can I put the knife back into the jar if I used it to
spread something on gluten-free bread?” No, because you’ll not only end up
with crumbs in the jar, but you won’t know whether they were gluten-free or
not and you’ll end up throwing the whole jar away. I can’t tell you how many
times I’ve spent $10 on the 7-gallon size mayonnaise at my local discount
shopping warehouse store and had to toss the whole thing in the trash.
Instead of using jars, I recommend getting squeezable containers for your
mustard, jelly, mayonnaise, honey, and any other condiments.
74
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Using utensils in food preparation
I’ve got a stumper for ya. You’re making two types of peanut butter and 
jelly sandwiches — gluten-free ones and regular ones. How many knives does
it take?
Answer: ten. Okay, I’m exaggerating a little, but if you want to guarantee 
that you won’t cause contamination, you can’t put the same knife back into
the container after the knife has touched the bread. So here’s how to make a
simple peanut butter sandwich:
Dip a knife into the peanut butter and spread it on the bread. Because it
touched the bread, that knife is done. Retire it to the sink. The next knife goes
into the jelly, then spreads the jelly onto the bread. Whoops, you didn’t get
enough jelly. Because that knife also touched the bread, it too must retire to
the sink, and you need yet another knife so you can add more jelly.
Wait! I have a better solution! Do a patented maneuver I call the gob drop!
Instead of using every knife in the house, take a huge gob of your spreadable
condiment and drop it onto the bread without letting the knife touch the 
surface. Flick the knife so it doesn’t touch the bread (or use a second knife to
scrape the first one off). If you don’t get enough the first time, go back for
more before the knife touches the bread. A word of caution: After you get the
hang of this, you’ll find yourself aghast when you see people putting knives
back into jars after they’ve touched food surfaces. Go easy on them; they
don’t know any better . . . yet!
75
Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Kitchen and Pantry
Too many cooks can glutenate a meal
Ah, those wonderful holiday dinners. The house
is full of people, fragrant aromas fill the air, and
then Helpful Helen manages to contaminate
nearly every jar in the kitchen by using the same
spoon to dish up gluten-free and glutenous
sauces, spreads, and condiments. Cousin Clara
puts the croutons in the salad and gives it a thor-
ough toss. Sister Susie surprises you by putting
the stuffing inside the turkey. Aunt Ginny mixes
the crunchy onion rings into the green bean
casserole, and Uncle Sid gets crumbs in the
butter after spreading some onto his roll. Last but
not least, Aunt Mary spoons gravy over her stuff-
ing, pressing down firmly to make a well, and
then sticks the stuffing-crusted spoon back into
the gravy boat. These wonderful, well-meaning
relatives had no idea that you planned to serve
everything on the side, and that they’ve com-
pletely ruined an entire meal for everyone eating
gluten-free.
If you’re having dinner guests or visitors who
insist on helping in the kitchen, my advice is to tell
them how much you appreciate their help, and
remember that their intentions are good. Make
them feel important by giving them jobs that can’t
possibly cause contamination, such as setting the
table, pouring the drinks, and keeping small chil-
dren entertained. And definitely don’t pass up the
opportunity to put them to work on clean-up duty.

Storing food
Some people worry that they can’t store gluten-free foods in the same 
plastic containers that have held glutenous foods. They think that the plastic
absorbs the gluten and will contaminate the gluten-free foods. But you can
rest easy. Gluten doesn’t seep into the pores, and you don’t need separate
containers as long as you wash everything carefully.
Some gluten-free meals are hard to make. Save time and money by making
large batches, and then storing the leftovers in vacuum-sealed bags or plastic
containers. Mark them well, and freeze them for later use. Here are a few tips:
 A permanent marker on aluminum foil works really well.
 If you have a plastic storage container that you don’t want to mark up,
use labels instead.
 You may want to a use color-coded system (red = gluten, green = 
gluten-free).
 Sometimes labels fall off or get dislodged. Be sure to put a label inside
the container, too.
Considering cookware
Some people think they need special pots and pans to create their gluten-free
meals in because they’ve heard that gluten can get embedded into Teflon and
other cookware surfaces. This opinion is widely circulated on the Internet, but
I’m here to tell you that it’s nothing more than an urban legend. Gluten does
not seep into Teflon or other cookware surfaces. However, scratches and
cracks can harbor residue from previous cooking. The key is to thoroughly
wash all cookware and utensils. My rule of thumb is that if you’d let your baby
lick the pan, it’s probably clean enough!
Some people use cast iron pans and “season” them, but don’t wash them. If
you cook gluten in cast iron pans and don’t wash it with soap and water,
don’t use that same pan for your gluten-free cooking.
Sometimes after you drain pasta in a colander, a residue remains. I recom-
mend that you have separate colanders for your gluten-free and glutenous
foods and mark them with a permanent marker so you’ll never get them 
confused. The same applies to those cute pasta servers with the teeth on 
the end (do those have a name? I digress . . .). They’ll have some residue left
that’s iffy to remove, so again, I recommend having separate ones.
76
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Sharing Is Caring When You’re 
Cooking Both Ways
It goes without saying that making separate meals creates extra work for the
cook (and because you’re reading this book, I’m going to assume that’s you!).
For instance, if you’re having a pasta dinner and you want to make one batch
of gluten-free pasta and one regular batch, you’re obviously making more
work for yourself, but I still think it’s the way to go when not everyone in the
house has to be gluten-free.
These days, gluten-free pastas and other gluten-free foods are so delicious
that it’s just as yummy to make the gluten-free version for everyone.
Sometimes, however, you’ll want to make two versions of a meal, whether it’s
to save money or for personal preferences.
Having said that, I want to assure you that cooking two versions of a meal can
be easier than it sounds. Getting back to that pasta dinner, you may want to
make both types of pasta but keep things simple by serving one delicious
gluten-free sauce that can go on both.
As the heading says, sharing is caring when you’re cooking both ways, and
there are plenty of foods the whole family can share. Instead of having two
varieties of everything, use gluten-free versions of shared foods like sauces,
spices, condiments, and salad dressings. This will certainly make your life
easier and save you time in the kitchen and the grocery store.
Planning your menus for easy meal prep
It’s 5 p.m., you just got home from work, and you’re ready to start making
dinner. You were planning to make spaghetti, but you have no gluten-free
pasta in the house. Because gluten-free cooking involves special ingredients
and preparation processes, you have to plan your cooking in advance and
make sure you have all the ingredients on hand.
Gluten-free ingredients aren’t always easy to find. For instance, if you’re going
to make bread and you need xanthan gum, you can’t run down to the corner
store and get it. And if you don’t have it, you’re not making bread (unless you
cheat and use a mix like I do — oh, wait — this is a cookbook!).
Planning your work and working your plan is essential. Make menus and 
lists before you head for the store (Chapter 6 has more info on where to find
the items you need). Make sure you always have appropriate ingredients on
77
Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Kitchen and Pantry

hand. You may have to order some of them online, so give yourself plenty of
lead time. If a holiday is coming, plan the meal several weeks in advance in
case some of the ingredients are only available on the Internet.
Here’s a quick list of basic ingredients to always keep in your pantry:
 All the gluten-free flours.
 Xantham gum.
 Guar gum.
 A premixed batch of the baking mix you’ll find in Chapter 8.
 Quinoa (a personal favorite — great to toss into soups and other foods).
 Rice. (As you’ll see in Chapter 7, brown rice is best.)
 Gluten-free bread crumbs. (You can order them online or save them from
your own breads.)
 Gluten-free crackers. (You can crumble them and use them as coatings
on foods, fillers in meatloaf, and in soups and salads.)
 Gluten-free snacks. (Keep them on a level that kids can easily reach. You
never want to run out or leave them tempted to snack on something
glutenous.)
 Your favorites. (Order a backup so you don’t run out, especially with
foods that are hard to get.)
Using appliances to make cooking easier
Just as you don’t need separate cookware, you won’t need separate appli-
ances for cooking your gluten-free foods — with one exception. I absolutely
recommend that you have two toasters, or better yet, two toaster ovens.
I know I’ve mentioned this before, but I really can’t say it enough — crumbs
literally fly off of bread. No matter how carefully you clean, your toaster 
will always be home to crumbs that can contaminate your gluten-free foods. 
I recommend toaster ovens over toasters because thanks to gravity, the
crumbs fall down (as opposed to getting stuck on the side of the grates in 
a regular toaster), and you can wipe them away or put a piece of aluminum
foil on the bottom of the oven and easily get rid of them.
Toaster bags are another great invention that no shared kitchen should be
without. You just put your bread into the bag, put it into the toaster, and 
cook as usual. You can even take the bags to restaurants with you and ask the
server to toast your bread in them. Use any search engine on the Internet to
find toaster bags online.
78
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Here are four appliances that can make gluten-free cooking a whole lot easier:
 Bread machine: Unless you really love the minutiae of baking, a 
bread machine is a must if you want fresh-baked bread. It makes the job
so much easier. You’ll find delicious recipes for gluten-free breads in
Chapter 9, and some of them can be made in a bread machine. You 
can also buy mixes made especially for use in bread machines (again, 
I realize this is a cookbook and that’s somewhat counter to the essence
of this book). The smell of fresh-baked bread in a gluten-free home is
really awesome. By far, the easiest way to make homemade bread is with
a machine.
Gluten-free dough is really heavy compared to regular dough. You need a
bread machine with a super-strong motor, or you may catch it on fire or
burn it out. (I’ve done both!)
 Mixer: You don’t need a special mixer, but be sure to clean the beaters
and the mixer thoroughly before using this appliance to whip up gluten-
free foods because residuals can hang on. Have you ever noticed that
film of flour on your kitchen counter after mixing up your cookie dough?
That flour floats up as well as down, getting into the underside of your
mixer and just waiting to drop into the next thing you make. Clean the
mixer thoroughly and shake, bang, or brush it if necessary to dislodge
any hidden flour.
 Food processors: These gadgets are great, but they’re really hard to
clean. Be especially careful if you’re mixing glutenous bread crumbs. 
You may want to consider a high-end food-processor that comes with
multiple mixing bowls. You can use one bowl for gluten-free preparation
and the other for everything else.
 Rice cooker: One tool that can be invaluable is an electric rice cooker.
You’ll be cooking a lot of rice, and this just makes it easy.
Changing a few techniques 
in your two-way kitchen
To successfully share your kitchen, you don’t have to change your whole life.
You just have to change a few techniques:
 I’m a sponge person. I wash them in hot water, keep them super clean,
don’t use them very long, and never let them stay wet or moldy. If you
keep clean sponges handy, you’re more apt to wipe up the gluten
crumbs that can contaminate a perfectly good gluten-free meal.
 If you use hand towels and dish towels to wipe up crumbs and clean
countertops, make sure they’re always clean.
79
Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Kitchen and Pantry

 Use parchment paper or aluminum foil to cover cookie sheets, separate
foods, or cover your toaster oven or broiler rack. This is a great way to
make sure your gluten-free foods don’t get contaminated.
 Teach everyone, even the littlest kids, how to do the gob drop (see the
“Using utensils in food preparation” section earlier in this chapter for
the skinny on this).
 Make gluten-free sauces and condiments that everyone can use.
 Dedicate a gluten-free area of the pantry.
 Make sure all of your spices are gluten-free.
 When cooking separate meals, make sure the gluten-free version is at
least as yummy as the other one.
 Cleanliness is next to godliness. Crumbs are a no-no.
 When making two varieties of a meal, make the gluten-free version first.
 Use brightly colored labels to distinguish gluten-free foods. This is espe-
cially helpful when you have baby sitters or other people in the house
who may grab the wrong food.

Chapter 6
Shopping for the Gluten-Free 
Stuff You Need
In This Chapter
 Hunting for special ingredients
 Buying gluten-free affordably
M
y first gluten-free shopping experience was harrowing. It was the
summer of 1991, and my then-toddler son Tyler had just been diag-
nosed with celiac disease. The hospital dietitian was no help at all, sending
me home with a tattered list of 7,498 things that Tyler would never again be
able to eat, and three things he could: rice, corn, and potatoes. Great.
Toddlers love rice, corn, and potatoes.
Keep in mind this was ages ago — there was no Internet; there were no books
on the subject, and there weren’t any support groups. I was on my own to
figure out the intricacies of the gluten-free diet — toddler-style.
Mustering all the strength a good mommy feels she needs to have, I faked a
smile and asked Tyler, “What sounds good for a snack?” “Kwackers,” he said.
I didn’t remember crackers being on the “forbidden” side of the tattered
sheet, so off to our local grocery store we went. That’s where the strong-
mommy act ended and reality set in.
The cracker aisle isn’t the best place to start if you’re gluten-free because it’s
an exercise in futility. Row after row of varieties I had never noticed before
seemed to be screaming a sing-songy taunt, “You can’t eat us, ha ha ha ha ha
ha.” “But you’re whole grain! Aren’t you nutritious?!?” I wondered. The 
crackers didn’t answer. They just continued to mock.

Three hours, five rows, and gallons of tears later, I ended up in the chips
aisle. As I continued to read labels and compare ingredient after ingredient 
to the 7,498 things Tyler couldn’t eat, I stumbled onto a bag of Fritos. You
know — normal-every-day-food-that-comes-in-a-normal-looking-package
Fritos. Normal-looking packages are important to kids. I couldn’t believe my
eyes — I reread the label 14 times, before crying with joy, “You can eat these,
Baby, you can eat them!” People in the store stared. I hugged passersby and
didn’t care. There was something he could eat.
So if you find shopping for gluten-free foods to be a bit of a challenge, 
let me tell you I feel your pain. But thankfully, you shouldn’t have to endure
what I experienced. Today not only are foods labeled “gluten-free,” or at least
“wheat-free,” but some stores conveniently stock all the gluten-free items
together. It’s a whole new world.
In this chapter, I reveal where to find all the ingredients you’ll need for 
gluten-free cooking, whether you’re throwing together a quick gluten-free
snack, or creating gluten-free greatness.
Coming Up with a Shopping Strategy
The grocery store is filled with all kinds of wonderful foods, even for those
who need to live gluten-free. You just have to know what you want to shop 
for and where you need to shop within the store.
I advocate sticking to natural foods as much as possible, as discussed in the
next section. But that doesn’t mean you’re restricted to a diet of plain meats,
fruits, and vegetables for the rest of your life. After all, this is a cookbook, 
and it’s filled with fantastic ideas for turning basic, natural, healthy foods into
culinary delights.
Sticking to natural foods: 
It’s so much easier
Shopping for your gluten-free creations can be just as easy as shopping for
any type of cooking. It’s even easier if you follow my mantra for optimal 
nutrition: If man made it, don’t eat it.
If you think about it, that makes shopping pretty easy. For the most part, if
you avoid packaging, you’re set! The best part about this healthy formula for
eating is that natural foods are generally gluten-free. Foods like plain meats,
82
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

poultry, fish, seafood, fruits, and vegetables — they’re all gluten-free, and in
the long-run, they cost less, too.
From a shopping standpoint, using all-natural ingredients means you get 
to avoid the middle aisles of the grocery store and only shop the perimeter.
That’s because the perimeter is where they keep the good stuff like meats
(keep ’em lean), fish, poultry, fruits, veggies, nuts, berries . . . you get the 
picture. The inner aisles of grocery stores are typically loaded with the
processed stuff stores want you to buy because their profit margins are
higher — foods like cereals, crackers, cookies, chips, breads, and other 
foods that aren’t allowed on the gluten-free diet.
If you want to save time and money and eat more nutritiously, shop the
perimeter of the grocery store.
Buying the occasional man-made item
You’ll have to venture into the center aisles of the grocery store to gather
basic necessities like spices (most are gluten-free) and household products.
You may be lucky enough to have a local grocery store that carries specialty
items, like gluten-free pastas or mixes. They’ll be in the center aisles, too.
I must confess that I think everyone needs to give in to indulgences from 
time to time (not gluten-containing ones, though!). However, if you must buy
man-made foods, read the labels carefully and don’t be taken in by the 
marketing claims on the front of the package.
Words like wholesome, nutritious, and organic don’t mean gluten-free. I have 
a girlfriend who still can’t understand, even after knowing my son for many
years, why it’s not okay to give him certain products when they say organic
on the front. Remember, foods can be organic and still contain gluten.
Before you go shopping and start reading labels, make sure you know which
ingredients are and are not gluten free. You might want to print out a list such
as the one you can find on www.celiac.com. Click on the “Safe Gluten-Free
Food List/Unsafe Foods & Ingredients” link.
Scouting Out the Best Stores
The ingredients you need for your gluten-free goodies can run the gamut
from specialty pastas to gluten-free soy sauce to baking mixes, flours, and
wacky ingredients like xanthan gum. People have told me they refuse to make
83
Chapter 6: Shopping for the Gluten-Free Stuff You Need

gluten-free meals because some of this stuff is just too hard to find. But
you’re in luck, because I have some ideas! And they won’t take a lot of time,
cost a small fortune, or require a trek to the far reaches of the continent.
This section outlines where you’ll have the best luck finding these specialty
ingredients.
Visiting your neighborhood grocery stores
These days, many of the ingredients you need for your gluten-free concoc-
tions can be found at regular grocery stores. You may have to search through
the specialty aisles or the natural foods section, if the store has one, but give
your local grocery store a try before you begin your hunt in other types of
stores. If your grocery store does carry what you need, you’ll save time,
money, and the frustration of driving all around town.
Don’t forget to check out your nearby “superstore.” Although I can’t name
names, the one that rhymes with “hall cart” is so dedicated to the gluten-free
world that it carries more than 1,000 private-label products that are labeled
gluten-free. This is a huge signal to the world that gluten-free living is a very
big deal.
Talk to the store manager
One of the first steps to take when embarking on a gluten-free lifestyle is to
get to know your grocery store manager. In fact, this person should become
your new best friend! Not only can store managers help you find the products
you love, but if you bug them enough, they’ll start carrying more gluten-free
items and maybe even make them easier to find in the store. If you’ve been
mail-ordering these products, you’ll be delighted to save on shipping and let
the store take care of that. The squeaky wheel definitely gets the grease when
it comes to gluten-free shopping.
Your store manager can be one of your best resources for gluten-free foods.
Start by asking a few simple questions, such as
 Does your store have a gluten-free aisle, or do you mix the gluten-free
products in with everything else?
 Would you be willing to start carrying certain products or brands? 
(This simple request can save you from paying for shipping if you’ve
been ordering online.)
 Do you have a list of your gluten-free products and where they can 
be found?
84
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

Years ago, one of my favorite gluten-free product lines was very hard to find
and available only by mail order. I asked the manager of a natural foods store
I frequented to consider carrying the product, and he eagerly said yes. At my
local grocery store, where I’d also shopped for many years, I once mentioned
that it would be really cool if the store would carry some gluten-free products
I wanted. The store manager quickly said, “Just name it and we’ll carry it.”
Today, with gluten-free diets enjoying far more recognition and popularity,
I’m sure almost any store would be happy to oblige.
Look for info within the store
Many stores post specialty product lists, including gluten-free, near the main
entrance. Look around when you walk inside, or ask your new best friend, the
store manager, if he has a gluten-free list. Like fat-free, dairy-free, and other
similar lists, it will tell you which products the store carries and where to 
find them.
Get on the Web
Another excellent source of information is your store’s Web site. While doing
the research for this book, I logged onto the Web sites of several major grocery
chains in various parts of the country. Most offered visitors the ability to
search the site, and when I searched for “gluten-free,” the sites yielded impres-
sive results. I quickly found all sorts of goodies, ranging from bread, brownie,
and pancake mixes to cereals, pizza crusts, tortillas, and seasonings.
Shopping at specialty stores
Specialty stores include natural food stores, gluten-free stores (yep, they
exist!), farmers’ markets, kosher stores, and co-ops. You’ll normally pay more
to shop at these places, but the convenience and the fact that you probably
can pick up everything you need in one spot often makes them worth it.
Here’s a closer look at the different types of specialty stores and what they
have to offer.
 Natural food stores: Growing in popularity, these stores can be found
almost anywhere in the country, and in some areas, they’re everywhere
you look. Some have end-caps or kiosks that showcase their gluten-free
products, and many have developed their own little gluten-free logos
that they put on the products or on the shelf tags. Some of these stores
are so committed to the gluten-free market that they’ve even created
their own line of gluten-free products.
85
Chapter 6: Shopping for the Gluten-Free Stuff You Need

 Gluten-free stores: An online search will reveal any stores in your area
that are dedicated to gluten-free products. Try using key words like
“gluten-free store” and “gluten-free grocery store.” I know of several
throughout the country.
 Farmers’ markets: These markets are not only full of the “If man made 
it, don’t eat it” products I talk so much about, but they often have alter-
native grains like quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and others, and many even
carry gluten-free breads. You can usually find good prices, and you can
even get fresh flowers while you’re there!
 Kosher stores: Kosher stores (or the kosher aisles of your local grocery
store) hold an abundance of gluten-free items. Again, try searching online
for key words like “kosher stores” and “gluten-free kosher.” Now, not all
kosher foods are gluten-free, but some are; you still have to read labels.
It’s important to note that some kosher foods are made differently during
Passover; the Passover versions may not contain gluten when the non-
Passover version does, and vice versa. Again, be sure to read your labels
carefully. Any products that contain cake flour or matzo flour also 
contain gluten because both types of flour have gluten in them.
 Co-ops: Some parts of the country have co-op stores where buyers band
together to take advantage of quantity pricing. An online search for
“gluten-free co-op” revealed many different options, including online 
co-ops with extensive lists of gluten-free products.
Do an online search for “gluten-free coupon” and see what you can find. A lot
of gluten-free manufacturers offer discounts on their products with coupons
you can print at home and take to any store that carries those products.
Buying online
Online gluten-free stores abound. To find a specific product or brand, do an
online search for the product you want, either by brand name or product type
(such as brownies, cake, and so on). To find an online store, try searching for
“gluten-free online shopping” or “gluten-free online store.”
One significant advantage with online shopping is that some online stores
warehouse their products. That’s great news for shoppers because it means
lower shipping costs (because all products come from the same source) and
faster delivery time. The alternative — ordering products from different 
manufacturers — can result in higher shipping costs and a bigger investment
of your time.
International online shopping can add a whole new dimension to your 
gluten-free meals. Some international brands are delicious and easily avail-
able online. Be careful, though. Some European manufacturers use Codex
Alimentarius wheat starch, which is approved as gluten-free in some coun-
tries but not in the United States. Always read the ingredient lists carefully.

Saving Money on Ridiculously 
Expensive Ingredients
If you’re going to buy specialty items, try small quantities first to make sure
you like them. After you find items you like, buy in bulk and freeze what
you’re not going to use right away. If you’re ordering by mail, you’ll save on
both quantity orders and the shipping costs. If you’re ordering from a store,
don’t be afraid to ask for a quantity discount.
Don’t be swindled into buying “specialty” items that are already gluten-free.
Online and specialty stores sometimes sell high-priced gluten-free condi-
ments and spices, but these things are naturally gluten-free, and there’s no
need to spend the extra money for a label. You can pick up these types of
items in your neighborhood grocery store.
People complain about the high cost of eating gluten-free, but those people
usually are eating a lot of the specialty items — breads, crackers, cakes,
cookies, brownies, and pretzels. But you don’t have to buy specialty items.
When you stick with wholesome ingredients like fresh fruits, vegetables,
meats, fish, and poultry, you eat healthier and save money. (See the “Sticking
to natural foods: It’s so much easier” section earlier in the chapter for more
on this.)
Even if you stick to my “if man made it, don’t eat it” philosophy, you’ll still
need to keep some gluten-free products on hand. And when you need them,
you need them badly. One way to save money and always be prepared is to
buy in bulk and freeze items. While you’re at it, you may as well cook in bulk
and freeze the dishes. Ask your store manager if you can get better pricing by
ordering larger quantities (such as by the case).
Buying generic is a money-saver, and lots of generic products are gluten-free.
Most companies’ customer-service representatives can tell you whether the
products contain gluten; just call the toll-free number listed on the packaging,
or visit the company’s Web site to see if you can find a list of generic gluten-
free products. If you can’t, the manufacturer can probably send you one. (See
Chapter 3 for more information about calling manufacturers to get informa-
tion on a product’s gluten content.)

I
’ll let you in on a little secret about me: Patience isn’t my strong suit. So
give me a recipe, and the first thing I do is size up the list of ingredients. 
If there are more than about three things on the list, I’m outta there. It’s not
that I don’t use a lot of ingredients — I do. In fact, I probably use far more
than what a normal recipe calls for because I tend to get carried away once
my creative juices get flowing. But that list can be so daunting, and often, I’ve
never even heard of some of the ingredients — seriously, “tragacanth gum
powder”?!? And then there’s this measuring thing you have to do. Who has all
the fancy spoons and cups — and who has the time? A glob, a dopple, and a
smidge are fine forms of measurement for me.
I know, people love recipes, and this is, after all, a cookbook. You get recipes
in the chapters ahead, and better yet, they’re created by a real live recipe
inventor, so you don’t have to worry that I made them up.
But before we start slicing, dicing, mixing, and measuring, I need to point out
that you don’t always need recipes. With a glob, a dopple, and a smidge of
creativity, you can turn any meal into a gluten-free favorite. That’s right, any
meal. Even flour-filled favorites like pastas, pastries, and Mom’s apple pie.
And you don’t need complicated instructions, tons of time, or hard-to-find
ingredients you have to order from France.
Gluten-free cooking doesn’t have to be complicated. This chapter points you
toward convenient mixes, simple substitutes, and fabulous foods that don’t
require all that mixing, measuring, and sorting of ingredients. And if you have
a gluten-filled recipe to start with, this chapter shows you how to alter it and
make it work so you can still enjoy all your favorite foods.

Transforming Any Meal into 
a Gluten-Free Delight
Transform any meal? That’s a pretty big promise, but that’s exactly what 
I’m talking about doing. Just because a recipe doesn’t say “gluten-free” 
doesn’t mean you can’t use it. I’m going to teach you to make some awesome
alterations!
I always love it when someone tells me they miss their favorite foods. I look
at that as a challenge to find a way to make that food available in a gluten-free
form. And with the tips in this chapter, you discover that there’s nothing 
you can’t make gluten-free and there are no boundaries. At first, it may seem
hard to believe. Like many people, you may be thinking that saying hello to a
gluten-free lifestyle means saying good-bye to rolls, gravies, lasagnas, and
sauces. Well, say hello again because all those foods are back on the menu.
The key to making the transformation is creativity. Forget the ingredients 
list. Forget the measuring spoons and cups. Whether you’re working from a
recipe that isn’t gluten-free and converting it to a gluten-free goodie, or
making it up on the fly, the most important ingredient is creativity. Having
good gluten-free substitutions in mind and on hand is important, too.
Finding fun substitutions
With more and more people adopting wheat-free and gluten-free lifestyles,
and with recent improvements in product labeling laws, it’s easier than ever
to find gluten substitutions. Grocery stores and specialty stores offer a wide
variety of ingredients, from bean flours and xanthan gum (prepare to take 
out a second mortgage when you buy xanthan gum) to buckwheat, quinoa,
and amaranth. Chapter 6 gives you ideas of where to shop and how to save
money on those ingredients, some of which are ridiculously expensive.
As you may already know, a little flexibility goes a long way when you’re
living a gluten-free lifestyle. Start flexing — here are some savvy substitutions
for some of your favorite ingredients:
 Flour: Start with the most obvious and mostly commonly used 
ingredient. If your recipe calls for flour, consider using cornstarch or 
a gluten-free flour or mix. I talk more about buying and making your 
own baking mixes in the “Messing with Mixes” section at the end of this
chapter. Experiment with the many new flours available, like bean 
flours, sorghum, and amaranth. They’re nutritious and add flavor, and
oh yeah — they’re gluten-free!
90
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

 Breading and coatings: If a recipe calls for breading, bread crumbs,
flour coating, or a similar preparation, consider using a wheat- or gluten-
free mix (either homemade or store bought). Bread and muffin mixes
work well for coatings on chicken and other fried goodies. Seasoned
cornmeal or corn flour (masa) and crushed potato chips (my favorite
chips for coatings are barbecue flavor) are also excellent alternatives.
 Thickeners: Cornstarch, arrowroot flour, and tapioca starch make great
substitutes for flour and other thickeners. Dry pudding mix works well
for sweet recipes, and bread or baking mixes work well for just about
anything.
 Binders: Whoa. That’s one of those ingredient categories that would
make me put away the cookbook, and I personally wouldn’t use a recipe
if it called for binders. But if you’re more culinarily courageous, consider
using gelatin, xanthan gum, or guar gum.
 Pie crust: People think that if something calls for a pie crust — say a
quiche or — well, say a pie — then it’s off limits unless they make a really
complicated crust from a really complicated recipe. I say think again!
First, consider making the dish without the crust. Seriously — a quiche
without a crust is still a quiche. And admit it — when you eat a pie, you
just eat the crust to be polite, right? The crust is really just a means to
get to the gushy stuff inside. Okay, if you really want to make a gluten-free
crust without a schmancy recipe, crush a couple of handfuls of gluten-
free cookies or a sugary gluten-free cereal, add some butter or margarine
(a glob or a dopple, whichever you prefer), and press the stuff into a
greased pie pan. Then follow the baking instructions for a regular pie.
You’ll probably just eat the good stuff out of the middle, anyway.
 Bread crumbs: Many gluten-free breads turn to crumbs when you look
at them. And certainly, there are always plenty of crumbs in the bag; just
use them as extras for cooking. Or crumble some bread slices and toast
or broil the crumbs to make them crunch.
 Croutons: Cut fresh, gluten-free bread into cubes, deep fry, and then roll
in Parmesan cheese and spices. Some people suggest letting the bread
get just a tad stale (not moldy) before making croutons this way.
 Granola: If you can find gluten-free oats, you’re set. But if you can’t, you
can still make granola. Toss together toasted nuts and seeds, and then
mix them with gluten-free cereal, honey, vanilla, a tiny bit of oil, and
spices or seasonings. How much spices and seasonings? A smidge or 
so, till it tastes like you like it. Bake at 300 degrees for an hour, stirring
every 15 minutes. Add dried fruit that’s first been soaked in water for 
10 minutes, let cool, and then refrigerate or vacuum seal and freeze.
 Trail mix: Lots of trail mixes that are available at the stores are already
gluten-free, but if you like to make your own, mix some peanuts, raisins,
dried fruit, and gluten-free chocolate candies or chips.
91
Chapter 7: You Don’t Always Need Recipes

Dates and some other dried fruits are often dusted with oat flour. Be
sure to check the labels. If they’ve been dusted with oat flour, the 
ingredients label will say so.
 Oatmeal/hot breakfast: Try corn grits. Prepare them like oatmeal and
top with butter, cinnamon, and sugar, or fry them. Hot cereals also are
available from the producers of gluten-free flours. Some new amaranth
and quinoa hot cereals that are nutritional powerhouses are also 
available.
 Buns and flour tortillas: Substitute lettuce, gluten-free bread, corn 
tortillas, or rice wraps (found in Asian markets and often used in Thai
cooking). If you like nori (the seaweed wrap on sushi), you can use it 
as a wrap with anything stuffed inside.
 Soy and teriyaki sauce: Asian markets carry some absolutely amazing
Asian sauces that are gluten-free, but you have to read labels carefully
(and sometimes that requires a crash course in another language). If 
you can’t find a gluten-free soy sauce, you can substitute Bragg Liquid
Aminos. You can find Bragg in the health-food aisle of your grocery store
or at a natural-foods retailer. To make your own teriyaki, add equal parts
of sugar and wine to your favorite soy sauce substitute.
When in doubt, leave it out. And really, what’s the harm in leaving it out,
anyway? If your soup recipe calls for a tablespoon or two of flour, try leaving
it out and see what you think.
Putting mindless meals on the menu
Sometimes we get so caught up in “how to do the diet” that we forget how
easy cooking can be. I love to experiment and play in the kitchen, but there
are plenty of days when I just don’t have the time. That’s where mindless
meals come in. These are easy meals that don’t require a recipe. Here are
some ideas to get you started.
When starting a gluten-free diet, people often forget they can eat normal,
everyday foods like the ones I list below. Just make sure to read the labels
and use substitutions for specific ingredients, if needed.
Breakfast
Most people start their day with a bowl of cereal, bagel, toast, pancakes, 
or waffles, and those things, unless they’re a special gluten-free variety, are
definitely not allowed on the gluten-free diet. But that’s okay! There are
healthier options for starting your day off gluten-free style, and they’re quick
and easy, too:
92
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

 Yogurt or cottage cheese topped with fruit, trail mix, or cereal
 Corn grits with a glob of butter and a little mix of cinnamon and sugar 
on top
 Eggs, any style, with sausage or bacon
 Fruit and cheese
 Fruit smoothie (I’d add some extra protein powder myself)
 Toast or French toast (made from gluten-free bread, of course)
 Quesadillas on a corn tortilla
 Leftovers from dinner the night before (my personal favorite)
Lunch or dinner
No need to scramble for cookbooks and recipes when you’re putting together
your gluten-free lunch or dinner. You can make plenty of quick and easy
meals using easy-to-find ingredients.
 Hot dogs or burgers, plain or wrapped in a lettuce “bun” or corn tortilla
 Deli meats on a lettuce wrap or corn tortilla, or just plain or rolled up
with condiments
 Caesar salad with chicken
 Roast beef, chicken, or turkey
 Premarinated or grilled chicken or turkey (add veggies and you 
have fajitas!)
 Chili
 Seafood
 Shish kebabs
 Frozen tamales
 Frozen taquitos
Side dishes and snacks
Whether you want simple or snazzy, you can prepare endless gluten-free side
dishes and snacks without a recipe. The key is to think about what you would
eat that has gluten in it, and use the substitution ideas in this book to help
you modify the meal. If you’re out of ideas, use this list as a starter:
 Fruit (fresh or dried)
 Vegetables (fresh or cooked)
93
Chapter 7: You Don’t Always Need Recipes

 Quinoa (you can eat it hot or cold — use it as rice or even tabbouleh)
 Rice (I recommend brown rice if you’re going to eat rice)
 Potatoes (sweet potatoes and yams are far more nutritious than other
types)
 Potato skins (yeah, a little decadent if you goop ’em up with cheese and
sour cream, but yummy nonetheless)
 Deviled or hard-boiled eggs
 Tuna
 Nachos or chips
 Cheese squares (you can get all sorts of gluten-free crackers if you want
cheese and crackers)
 Cream cheese wrapped in ham or salami
 Rice cakes or popcorn
 Nuts
 Baked beans
 Sloppy Joes (on gluten-free bread, of course)
 Soup (you do have to check labels on commercial brands, but you can
find gluten-free soups out there; consider making a super simple version
of your own by using a premade stock and tossing in some veggies and
gluten-free pasta)
 Celery with peanut butter or cream cheese
 Ice cream (stay away from varieties that contain the cookies, brownies,
pretzels, and other gluten-containing treats)
Converting a Gluten-Filled Recipe 
into a Gluten-Free Recipe
Like rules, some recipes are meant to be broken. I know, I know, this is a
recipe book, and you will get your recipes, I promise. But stay with me for a
little bit, and think about breaking a few rules and bending a few recipes.
With gluten-free cooking, it’s especially important to think outside the recipe
box because you may not be able to find recipes for everything you want to
make. You don’t have to follow recipes to a T. With a little creativity and a
94
Part I: Preparing for Your Gluten-Free Cooking Adventures 

willingness to bend, break, or bury the rules, you can transform any recipe
into a gluten-free masterpiece, whether you found it in your great-grandma’s
recipe box, saw it on the hottest new cooking show, or ran across it on 
the Internet.
In this section, I show you exactly how to transform a recipe, or at least 
how I do it.
For this example, I chose a recipe that’s gushing with gluten for dramatic
effect. It’s called “Fried Broccoli Florets with Soy Curry Sauce.” Yikes. The
title alone should sound warning bells in your head because “fried” usually
means breading, and “soy” is usually followed by the word “sauce.”
Here’s the recipe as it appears online:
95
Chapter 7: You Don’t Always Need Recipes
Fried Broccoli Florets 
with Soy Curry Sauce
This dish can be served as an appetizer or a first course.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄4 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄4 cup plus 1 teaspoon beer
1 garlic clove, peeled
1 pinch kosher salt
1 teaspoon butter
1⁄4 teaspoon curry powder
3⁄4 teaspoon dark brown sugar
11⁄2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1⁄2 teaspoon soy sauce
oil (for deep frying)
12 broccoli florets
1 In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and the beer and let the batter stand for 30
minutes.
2 Finely mince the garlic, and on your cutting board, mix in the salt. Mash the garlic and
salt together with the blade of a knife until it’s a paste.
3 In a pan, melt the butter over moderately low heat and cook the curry powder, stirring
for 1 minute.
4 Stir in the garlic paste, brown sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, and soy sauce, and transfer
the sauce to a small dish.

5 In a deep, heavy skillet, heat 1 inch of oil to 375 degrees.
6 Whisk the beer batter, dip the broccoli florets into it, tossing off the excess batter, and
fry them in the oil for 11⁄2 to 2 minutes or until golden.
7 Transfer the broccoli to paper towels to drain, and serve it while warm with the 
curry sauce.

Converting the ingredients
Okay, so we have all-purpose flour, beer, more beer (Why do they do that? Is
that one extra teaspoon really going to make a difference?!? But I digress . . .),
and soy sauce. No go, no go, and no go. Not on a gluten-free diet.
So how do I transform this into a gluten-free goodie? Well, first I get rid of the
measurements, because this is cooking Danna-style. Table 7-1 shows you
what the new ingredients list can look like. (I included the original ingredients
list in the left-hand column of the table so you don’t have to keep flipping
back and forth, only to give up after five or six flips. You’re welcome!)

When you deep-fry glutenous foods, like “regular” breaded items, the oil
becomes contaminated with gluten. You can’t use that same oil for your
gluten-free goodies, or you’re defeating the purpose of cooking gluten-free.
Always use fresh, non-contaminated oil for frying or deep-frying.
Interpreting the instructions
Okay, so now it’s time for the instruction part of the recipe. In the “real”
recipe, the beer and flour have to hang out together for a half hour or so to do
their thing: thicken, bubble, yeastify. That borders on being a little schmancy
for my type of cooking, but I’ll let it slide. Check out Table 7-2 to see how the
original steps compare to what I would do.

Beer is less acidic than wine, vinegar, or citrus juices, so it tenderizes meats
without breaking down the texture as fast. That’s why you can use it to tender-
ize and marinate raw fish, or add it to dishes that call for vinegar. And of
course, I don’t have to remind you to make sure it’s of the gluten-free variety!

Keep in mind that the whole point of this chapter is to be creative and think
outside the recipe box. So the example I’ve given you here is just that — 
an example. Feel free to modify it however you’d like to suit your fancy.
Messing with Mixes
Bear with me while I whine for a moment, will you? When I first started
“doing gluten-free” in 1991, there weren’t any mixes — at least not that I
found. Remember, that was before Al Gore invented the Internet, before there
were any books on the subject, and even before support groups were widely
available.
The first gluten-free mixes to hit the streets were basically a little rice flour
with a lot of sugar. And hey — I’m the first to admit that a little sugar can go
a long way in making up for lost flavor, but they were lacking something.
Flavor . . . nutrition . . . the ability to stick together.
We’ve come a long way, baby. Today you can easily find gluten-free mixes for
brownies, cookies, breads, pizza crust, muffins, cakes — you name it. For
those who don’t want to explore recipes and worry about all the ingredients
they involve, mixes are a great alternative.
Even if you’re a pro in the kitchen, mixes can be a valuable addition to your
pantry shelf. Keep them on hand to use when you’re in a hurry or as a ready-
made substitute for gluten-containing ingredients. For instance, if your recipe
calls for dredging chicken in flour, and you obviously can’t use regular white
flour, just use a gluten-free bread or muffin mix in its place.
One of my favorite mixes is a blend of several different kinds of flour. You can
use flour mixtures like this in recipes that call for regular flour. In Chapter 8, I
give you a recipe you can use to make your own flour mixtures, but you can
buy them premixed, too. The mixes actually work better than individual
flours alone, because each flour adds a cooking characteristic of its own.
When you combine different varieties, such as rice, potato, tapioca, quinoa,
buckwheat, amaranth, and other flours, they rise better, cook better, and
offer more nutritional value than each individual flour alone.
Add some flaxseed to your favorite mix for some extra fiber and omega-3
fatty acids. Omega-3s are important building blocks for our cell membranes,
and are essential for good health. Among other things, they play an impor-
tant role in heart health and in lowering cholesterol.
99
Chapter 7: You Don’t Always Need Recipes

Don’t let the price tag fool you
Besides the obvious convenience factor, one of the best things about mixes is
that although they may seem prohibitively expensive, they can actually save
you money in the long run.
Personally, I’ve spent exorbitant sums of money on ingredients for my home-
made concoctions (seriously, have you priced xanthan gum?), not to mention
hours putting them together, only to end up with inedible bricks of bread, 
or cookies that crumble when you have the audacity to attempt to remove
them from the baking sheet. Sometimes even my dogs couldn’t stomach the
mixture mishaps.
Mixes today are a sure bet. Not only are they edible (a plus for food products),
but they taste great and are often loaded with extra nutrients thanks to the
more widespread use of alternative flours such as amaranth, quinoa, and
buckwheat. Investing in a sure thing can beat experimentation and save you
money in the long run.
They’re easy to find
You can find these incredible mixes in many grocery stores and specialty
stores. Even some of the larger grocery stores have gluten-free sections, 
or they carry these types of products in their health food sections.
You can also find a large assortment of mixes and other products online. 
For a general assortment, search for keywords like “gluten-free products” 
and “gluten-free mixes.” If you know what you’re looking for, make your
search criteria more specific, like “gluten-free brownie mix” or “gluten-free
cookie mix.”

Yes, you are a celiac (or you’ve decided to avoid foods containing gluten).
Yes, you must give up all products containing wheat, rye, and barley.
And yes, you can still enjoy eating all of your favorite foods. If this sounds
contradictory, read on.
This first chapter in the recipe section of this book is devoted to setting 
your mind at ease by explaining how to use alternative flours successfully.
Let’s be honest. We all love bread, cakes, pizza, and pasta. Celiacs, especially
those who are newly diagnosed, have nightmares of never being able to eat
these processed carbohydrates again. None of these foods is traditionally
gluten-free — but they can be!

Baking Decent Bread without 
Wheat Flour: It’s No Joke
If you’re living the gluten-free life, you certainly know that you can’t go to the
store, buy a bag of wheat flour, bring it home, dip your measuring cup into
the bag, and begin baking. The properties in wheat are difficult to duplicate,
so you need a variety of alternative flours to attain the results you would get
from wheat flour. Even then, you’re dealing with gluten-free flours that have
no, well, no gluten. Gluten gives bread its light, spongy consistency and cakes
their airy lift. In a few recipes, you can get away with substituting cornstarch
in place of wheat flour, but those instances are rare.
Don’t despair. There are viable ways to imitate the texture and taste of wheat
flour. When you use the right combination of alternative flours, add some
additional flavoring and include something acidic to help the product rise.
Your cookies, cakes, and pie crusts will taste every bit as good as their wheat
counterparts.
You may have noticed that breads weren’t included in the “. . . will taste every
bit as good as . . .” list above. Breads are some of the most difficult recipes to
convert to gluten-free, and converting them takes a little more understanding.
After you’ve mastered the art of this conversion (I give you some hints a few
paragraphs below), you’ll have a loaf of bread that is gorgeous to look at,
heavenly to smell, and delectable to eat. But it’s not quite as simple as that.

Surviving a gluten-free bread disaster
If you do end up with a disastrous loaf of bread
at some point, do not throw it out! Gluten-free
ingredients are far too expensive to simply toss
in the trash can, and you put too much effort into
your creation. Instead, cut the loaf into slices and
lay them on a baking sheet. Bake the slices at 200
degrees for 1 hour, or until the bread is crisp. (The
baking time will vary considerably depending on
the thickness of the slices and the texture of
bread.) Let the slices cool, and then put them into
a blender with seasonings to make your own
bread crumbs.
If the loaf is semi-salvageable, first cut slices,
and then cut those slices into cubes. Toss the
bread cubes in a bowl with a little oil and sea-
sonings, and then spread the cubes out on a
baking sheet. Bake the cubes at 200 degrees
until they’re crisp (but not jaw-breaker crisp).
Use these cubes as croutons in salads, or
freeze them until you’re ready to make bread
dressing or bread pudding.

The first time you try to convert a wheat yeast bread recipe to gluten-free,
you’ll most likely end up with a glob that is raw in the center, has a crust that
requires a jackhammer to cut through it, and an aftertaste that redefines the
word “bitter.” If the loaf actually bakes all the way through, then the slices
may crumble beyond recognition when you attempt to cut it.
Fortunately, you have this book in your hands. It contains excellent bread
recipes with all the necessary adjustments, so you don’t have to worry about
converting your Grandma’s homemade bread recipe immediately. Be aware
that if you use a different flour mixture with the recipes in this book, you may
get different results.
To create a loaf of gluten-free bread that is a masterpiece, the proportion of
yeast to salt and sugar has to be correct. Adding an extra egg white to the mix
usually results in a lighter texture. Adding a little light flaxseed meal helps the
yeast rise. Adding something acidic (usually cider vinegar) also helps with the
rising. Additional flavoring is beneficial. Again, the recipes in this book have
already had these adjustments made. The finished product may not be as airy
as the commercial, non-nutritional, touch-it-and-it-smooshes white bread, but
the texture will be light and the taste divine. Some of the ready-made loaves of
gluten-free breads that you find at health food stores are edible (that’s a gener-
ous summation), so seriously consider baking some homemade bread. You
deserve to eat a slice of bread that actually tastes great!
A Brief Overview of Alternative Flours
If you tour a health food store, and even some grocery stores, you’ll be amazed
at the variety of alternative flours available. If you’re health-conscious, use
three-fourths of the basic gluten-free flour mixture in a recipe, and add up to
one-fourth of a different kind of flour so the mixture has more fiber and pro-
tein. Experiment with almond flour, light flaxseed meal, light teff, chestnut
flour, mesquite flour, or lentil flour.
Where to purchase your flours may be an issue. You can buy some of these
alternative flours at Asian markets. The advantage to buying them from Asia
is that they are usually less expensive and the flours are ground finer, yield-
ing better baking results. The disadvantage is that you’re rarely able to con-
firm that the flours are processed in a gluten-free facility. If you prefer to stay
away from Asian markets or you don’t have one nearby, alternative flours are
readily available at health food stores, and many mainstream grocery stores
now have gluten-free sections that offer a large variety of flours.

 You can choose between white rice flour and brown rice flour.
• Brown rice flour still has the bran layer, so it offers more vitamins,
minerals, and fiber than its white counterpart, but the finished
product will be slightly darker in color and just a bit nuttier tast-
ing. Even though brown rice flour still has the bran layer, this kind
of bran is gluten-free.
• There is white rice flour and glutinous white rice flour; the two are
not interchangeable. White rice flour is used in the flour mixture
for baking. Glutinous white rice flour is glutinous (sticky) and is
used like cornstarch to thicken gravies. Don’t let the name “gluti-
nous” confuse you. Rice gluten (which is safe for celiacs) is not the
same as wheat gluten (which is not safe for celiacs). If you are a
newbie (an affectionate reference to someone who is newly diag-
nosed), all this flour stuff does make sense after a while.
 Potato starch flour shouldn’t be confused with potato flour. Potato flour
is used as a thickener for gravies; potato starch flour is used as a base
for baked goods. The powdery texture helps keep baked foods light in
texture and helps with the expansion during baking. It also helps main-
tain moisture in baked goods.
 Tapioca (or cassava) flour is a thickening agent that helps prevent
breads and cakes from crumbling. It also lightens baked goods while
adding a chewiness (perfect for cookies), and it helps gluten-free prod-
ucts to brown. It’s very easily digested.
 There are two main bean flours on the market — garbanzo bean (chick-
pea) flour and garfava bean flour (a combination of garbanzo beans
and fava beans). Both of these flours are slightly yellow in color, and
they’re excellent sources of protein. A little more challenging to locate
are lentil, mung bean, and pea flours. The bean flours add extra nutri-
tion to the mix, and they also help make the product lighter, so it’s bene-
ficial to add a little bean flour to your flour mixture. Adding too much
bean flour may give your product a potent aftertaste and may also cause
flatulence (yup — gas).
 Cornstarch, although it has no nutritional value, is used to lighten the
texture of baked goods.
 Sorghum (or milo) flour offers more nutritional value (protein and fiber)
than the rice flours. It’s neutral tasting, and it helps keep your baked
goods from shrinking.
 White sweet potato flour is difficult to find, but it adds a delicious flavor
to cookies and cakes, and is also higher in fiber than most other flours.
106
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 

 Amaranth is sweeter than most alternative flours with an almost nutty
taste. Although the taste is good, the texture tends to be very sticky, so
no more than 10 percent of your flour mixture should be amaranth. The
advantage to including it is that it’s more nutritious than most of the
alternative flours. It’s high in fiber, iron, and calcium.
 Soy flour is an option, but it tends to leave a distinctive aftertaste, as do
teff and buckwheat. (No, buckwheat does not have wheat in it.)
You’ll have a slight glitch if you bake gluten-free products and wheat prod-
ucts in your home (for the celiac and non-celiac members of your family).
You’ll need to bake the gluten-free baked goods first, and then cover them
securely. Flour particles can stay in the air for up to 24 hours, so no matter
how careful you are to clean your mixer, baking sheets, and countertops, the
gluten-free food may still become contaminated with wheat flour if you bake
the wheat product first.
Creating the Gluten-Free Flour Mixture
Setting out all the different alternative flours, the xanthan gum, the corn-
starch . . . this can create quite a mess in your kitchen. You’ll undoubtedly
find flour powder lightly dusting your kitchen counters when you’re through
with the measuring and sifting.
107
Chapter 8: Gluten-Free Flours: Your Foundation for Great Breads and Pastries
Yes, gum is involved
If you are new to gluten-free baking, you may
have panicked when you saw the word xanthan
gum (pronounced zan-thun). It’s just a fancy name
for a gum (sticky stuff) that will help hold your
baked product together. Point of clarification —
the result of using the gum is sticky, not the gum
itself. Xanthan gum is available at most health
food stores and even at some mainline grocery
stores. It’s a cream-colored powder that comes
packaged either in a pouch or a jar. Adding just
a little of this gum to your flour mixture helps
prevent your baked goods from crumbling.
Guar gum is sometimes used in place of xan-
than gum. It accomplishes the same thing as the
xanthan gum (preventing crumbling). Although
guar gum is gluten-free, it may cause distress
of the lower intestinal tract in some people
(that’s the politically correct way to say diar-
rhea). Another alternative to using xanthan gum
is to use twice the amount of unflavored gelatin.
If the recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of xanthan
gum, use 2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin.

Precisely because of the mess that occurs when you assemble the flour mix-
ture, we only use one flour mixture throughout this book. Why? Because you
can measure and sift once, and then spoon the combined flours into a self-
seal plastic bag and freeze it. When you’re ready to bake, you don’t have to
drag out all the different bags of flour — one flour mixture will suffice for all
the recipes in this book. Just take the bag out of the freezer, measure the
amount you need, and begin baking. It doesn’t get much easier than that. It
should be noted that in a few of the bread recipes, sorghum flour or flaxseed
meal is added to the basic flour mixture to get the right consistency.
When making more than one batch of the flour mixture, measure and sift
each batch separately to be certain that the ingredients combine evenly.
After one recipe has been sifted into a bowl, stir the mixture with a whisk to
guarantee that everything is well blended. Place it in a freezer bag, and then
begin mixing up the second batch.
Why should you freeze the flour mixture? The alternative flours don’t have
the shelf life of wheat flour. By keeping the mixture in the freezer, it will stay
fresh for months. After you measure the amount of the gluten-free flour mix-
ture you need for a recipe, let it set out on the kitchen counter for about 15
minutes to reach room temperature before mixing it with other ingredients.

T Gluten-Free Flour Mixture
This recipe is the magical gluten-free flour mixture that is used in the recipes
throughout this book. Although many other suitable combinations of flours are
available, cooking and baking is so much simpler when you use only one flour
mixture. When making a double batch of this flour mixture, sift together one
recipe at a time, and then stir together the batches of flour mixture.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 5 cups
1 Sift all the ingredients into a large bowl, and then stir them together with a whisk.
2 Spoon the mixture into a self-seal freezer bag and freeze until needed.

Recipe for Success: A Few Baking Tips
Baking is just as much a science as it is an art. You can’t play around with a
bread or cake recipe like you can a soup recipe. You have to know what
you’re doing, which takes practice. Here are some general baking tips that
should help as you develop your skills:
 Eggs should be at room temperature when making baked goods. If you
forget to take the eggs out of the refrigerator ahead of time, place the
eggs (still in their shells) in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes. Eggs
that are cracked or leaking should not be used. Because of the risk of
salmonella, none of the recipes in this book contain raw eggs.
 If a recipe calls for softened butter and your butter is still in the refrig-
erator, cut off the needed amount. Cut that block into 1-tablespoon
chunks, set the chunks on a plate, and put the dish in the microwave for
14 seconds to soften.
 If you substitute margarine for butter, only use margarine made with 
80 percent fat. Products with a lower fat content may affect the quality
and texture of the end product.
 Periodically test your cornstarch for freshness by mixing 1 teaspoon of
vinegar with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. The mixture will bubble if the
cornstarch is fresh.
 If sifting is called for in a recipe, instead of sifting, you can place all the
dry ingredients in a bowl and mix them with a wire whisk or mixer. Or
you can place the dry ingredients in the bowl of your food processor
and give them a couple of quick pulses.
 For baked goods that call for oil, you can replace half of the oil with
applesauce to produce a low-fat version of the recipe. You’ll need 
to reduce the baking time just slightly to prevent the product from
becoming too dry.
 When mayonnaise is called for in a cake recipe, use real mayonnaise
(not reduced-calorie, fat-free, or imitation). Anything other than real
mayo will break down under the heat of the oven and leave a metallic
taste.
 When measurements are given, they are level (not heaping) measures.
When measuring honey, molasses, or anything sticky, spray the measur-
ing spoon or measuring cup with nonstick cooking spray first so the
sticky stuff slides out easily.

f you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and wake up at 7 a.m.,
you’ll have fasted for more than 13 hours
before you sit down to breakfast. At that point,
your body’s blood sugar levels are screaming for
nourishment. If you’re weight conscious, eating
breakfast jump-starts your metabolism so it works
harder and more efficiently all day. Simply put,
never skip breakfast.
Forget the excuse, “I don’t have time for break-
fast.” There are foods that you can take in the car
and eat as you commute to work. At the very least,
you can grab a piece of fruit, a container of gluten-
free yogurt, and a gluten-free health bar. Some
foods can be prepared the night before so that, in
the morning, you can put them in the oven while
you shower, and they’re ready by the time you’re
dressed. Now, did that cover all the “I don’t have
time for breakfast” excuses? Besides, after making
the recipes in this chapter, you’ll wake up each
morning anticipating your first meal of the day.

Many of the recipes in this chapter call for a gluten-free flour mixture. See
Chapter 8 for our no-fail recipe.
Starting the Day the Gluten-Free Way
Most people climb out of bed, shuffle into the kitchen, and pop some bread
into the toaster or pour a bowl of cereal — you can too. You just have to
make sure your bread and cereal are gluten-free.
If you have non-celiacs in the house, you need to be certain that your toast is
not contaminated by their toast crumbs. The easiest way to do this is to have
two toasters or to use Toast-It! Bags. With these bags, you insert the bread
into the bag, and then insert the bag into the toaster. The bag allows heat to
penetrate so the bread will toast, but no crumbs or essence of crumbs can
cling to the bread. These bags are great to take with you when you’re travel-
ing so you can have toast on the road without fear of cross-contamination.
But you are about to realize that breakfast is so much more than mere bread
and cereal.

T Homemade Cereal
Make up a big batch of this and keep it stored in self-seal bags or a large plastic con-
tainer. Kids will love to munch on the dry cereal, too. Be very careful to bake it enough
the first time so the cereal is crunchy, and be equally as careful not to over-bake it 
on the second baking or it becomes too hard and won’t soften in milk. After you get 
the timing of the baking down pat, you’ll want to keep an ample supply of this cereal 
on hand.

Yield: 10 cups
Stage 1
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
2 In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, flaxseed meal, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown
sugar, salt, and baking soda.
3 In a small bowl, stir together the buttermilk and vanilla.
4 Stir the wet ingredients into the dry mixture until they’re well blended.
5 Spread the soft, cookie-like dough evenly in the prepared baking sheet.
6 Bake the dough at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, and then turn it over (so both sides
brown evenly). It’s okay if the dough breaks into pieces. Continue to bake the dough for
10 to 15 more minutes until it’s golden brown and crisp.
7 Place the pan on a wire rack to cool. Let the cereal dough stand, uncovered, for several
hours or overnight in a cool place to completely dry out.

Chapter 9: Breakfast: Don’t Leave Home Without It
Stage 2
1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
2 When the cereal dough is dry, break it into small pieces and chop it in a food processor
(a blender works, but not quite as well) until the pieces are the size of dried peas.
3 Spread the cereal on two baking sheets.
4 Bake the cereal at 300 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes until it’s crisp and lightly browned.
Stir the cereal often during baking. Do not over-bake (or the cereal will turn into rocks!)
5 When the cereal has cooled, stir in the almonds and cranberries and store it in a sealed
container.
Tip: This cereal makes an excellent topping for yogurt, frozen yogurt, or ice cream.

Adding Some Sizzle to Your Morning with
Eggs, Omelets, and Breakfast Wraps
It is amazing what a little whipping can do for an egg. I like to think of egg
preparations in terms of the height of the finished product. Here’s what I mean:
 Fried eggs aren’t beaten at all; scrambled eggs are just stirred up. When
cooked, neither rises much at all.
 Omelets, whose eggs are given a quick beating, rise a little bit. 
 Frittatas have even more lift. 
 One step above the frittata is the quiche.
 And the ultimate elevation results in a soufflé.
And you thought cooking eggs for breakfast was going to be simple!
Now take that same egg, scramble it, lay it in a gluten-free flour or corn tor-
tilla, spoon on your choice of toppings, and you’ve just created a breakfast
wrap. Kids love wraps because they’re fun to eat and a welcome reprieve
from the usual bowl of gluten-free cereal.

1 Preheat the broiler. Wrap the handle of a 10-inch skillet with foil.
2 In the skillet, sauté the mushrooms and onions in the butter and oil over medium-high
heat, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender but not browned.
3 Stir in the zucchini; cook the vegetables 2 to 3 minutes until the zucchini is tender.
4 Stir in the ham.
5 In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until the whites and yolk are blended but not foamy.
Stir in the thyme, dill, salt, and pepper. Stir in the cheese.
6 Pour the egg mixture over the ham and vegetables. Cook over medium-low heat, with-
out stirring, until the mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. As the
eggs set, run a rubber spatula around the edge of the skillet, lifting the egg mixture to
allow the uncooked portion to flow underneath. Continue doing this until the eggs are
almost set.
7 Set the skillet under the broiler and broil for 2 minutes, or until the eggs are just set.
8 To serve, cut the omelet in wedges.

Farmer’s Skillet Eggs
Scrambled eggs are fine, but mundane. An omelet takes very little additional effort and
cooking time, yet the final product is so much more rewarding, both to the eye and to
the tummy. Children often won’t eat zucchini — but they won’t even taste it in this gor-
geous omelet.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 green onion, sliced
2 teaspoons butter
1 teaspoon olive oil
1⁄2 small zucchini, finely chopped (about 1⁄3 cup)
3 slices deli ham (sliced, not shaved), cut into
1⁄4-inch cubes
4 large eggs
1⁄8 teaspoon thyme
1⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup (1 ounce) shredded Swiss cheese

Chapter 9: Breakfast: Don’t Leave Home Without It
1 Preheat the broiler. Wrap the handle of a 10-inch nonstick skillet with foil.
2 Heat the oil in the skillet. Add the broccoli, green onion, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning,
thyme, dill, and parsley. Cook the vegetables and seasonings over medium-high heat,
stirring, until the broccoli florets are tender-crisp.
3 In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, cornstarch, and milk until they’re very light.
Pour the mixture over the vegetables.
4 As the eggs begin to set, run a rubber spatula around the edge of the skillet, lifting the
egg mixture to allow the uncooked portions to flow underneath. Continue cooking and
lifting the edges until the eggs are nearly set. (The top surface will still be moist.)
5 Sprinkle the top of the frittata with cheese.
6 Place the skillet under the broiler and broil the frittata for 1 to 2 minutes until the top is
set and the cheese has melted. Cut the frittata into wedges to serve.

Pepperoni Frittata
Think of a frittata as the midpoint between an omelet and a soufflé. Customize this 
masterpiece to your liking. You can use cooked, crumbled sausage in place of the pep-
peroni. Instead of the broccoli, try asparagus tips. You can substitute cheddar or moz-
zarella cheese for the Swiss cheese. Try different combinations — variety is the spice 
of life!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes

Crab Quiche
You can make a gluten-free pie crust for this quiche, but it isn’t needed. The taste, sans
crust, is absolutely exquisite.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
3 eggs
2 green onions, chopped
1⁄4 cup plain low-fat yogurt
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1⁄4 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄2 teaspoon dried dill
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
3⁄4 cup (1⁄2 of a 10-ounce box) chopped 
broccoli, thawed
4.25-ounce can flaked crabmeat, drained
2 tablespoons grated Romano cheese
1⁄4 cup (1 ounce) shredded Swiss cheese
2 plum tomatoes, sliced thin
1⁄4 cup gluten-free bread crumbs
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray.
2 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, green onions, yogurt, cornstarch, basil, dill,
parsley, salt, and pepper until they’re thoroughly blended.
3 Stir in the broccoli, crabmeat, and Romano and Swiss cheeses.
4 Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared pie plate.
5 Lay the tomato slices neatly across the top of the quiche and then sprinkle them with
breadcrumbs.
6 Bake the quiche, uncovered, at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted in
the center comes out clean. Let the quiche stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
Vary It! You can use a 6-ounce can of salmon in place of the crabmeat with equally excel-
lent results.

Egg Burrito
When was the last time you surprised your family by serving them a really fun break-
fast? Kids, as well as adults, will love this burrito. Wrap it in wax paper and you trans-
form the burrito into a to-go breakfast sandwich that you can eat in the car on the way
to work or school. One can of refried beans makes 10 servings.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
10-inch tortilla
2 strips bacon
1 egg
2 tablespoons refried beans
2 tablespoons shredded cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon salsa
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Wrap the tortilla in foil and warm it in the oven for 4 minutes.
3 Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it’s crisp. Remove the bacon
and drain it on a paper towel. Pour out the bacon grease but don’t wipe out the pan.
4 Break the egg into the same skillet and scramble it with a fork as it cooks over medium
heat. Cook the egg until it’s firm but not dry.
5 In a small saucepan, warm the beans.

Rise and Shine! Breads and Bagels
Ah, bread. Bread is probably the most difficult item to convert successfully to
gluten-free. It’s challenging but conquerable! The sweet breads and those that
depend on baking soda and baking powder for leavening aren’t the problem.
They taste every bit as good as their wheat counterparts. The yeast breads,
however, get us exasperated at times. Fortunately, you can play tricks with
the dough to achieve a delicious loaf of bread.

122
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
In Chapter 8, we emphasize that only one gluten-free flour mixture is used
throughout this book to make it easier for the baker. You may notice that the
bread recipes that follow use the gluten-free flour mixture and then call for
additional flours to be used. Here’s the reason: Adding cornstarch and/or
sorghum flour changes the consistency of the bread for the better. Occasionally
coconut flour is used for flavor. You can use just the gluten-free flour mixture,
but your breads won’t turn out as well. Light flaxseed meal is also added 
frequently. Flax not only adds fiber to the bread, but it helps to activate the
yeast so your bread is lighter. The light flaxseed meal has virtually no taste,
so it doesn’t affect the taste of the bread.
Choosing and prepping yeast
Quick-rising yeast is very effective in some instances, but active dry yeast
tends to work better with the alternative flours. Sometimes people proof yeast
(let it rise) in warm water before adding it to other ingredients to make sure it
will work, but most times you can simply mix it in with the dry ingredients.
It’s vital when working with yeast that the water (or other liquid) temperature
be between 110 to 120 degrees. If the liquid is cooler than that, it may not acti-
vate the yeast. If the liquid is warmer than that, it may kill the yeast. When run-
ning warm water on your wrist, 115 degrees feels comfortably warm but not hot.
Make sure that all the ingredients are at room temperature before beginning.
Adding cold eggs or other cold liquid may keep the yeast from fermenting.
Working the dough: You don’t 
need Popeye arms
Kneading is an important step in making bread, but not with gluten-free
breads. The process of turning the dough on a board activates the gluten in
wheat so the bread will rise. Because wheat gluten is absent in the alternative
flours, kneading is only done long enough to form a smooth ball from the
dough. However, many gluten-free bread doughs are more like the consis-
tency of cake batter, so they usually need no kneading at all.
Instead of depending on wheat gluten to help the bread rise, you add addi-
tional ingredients (something acidic like vinegar) to trick the dough into
rising. If you find large holes in the baked loaf of bread, you have added too
much leavening.
In regular bread preparation, you let the bread rise, punch it down, and then
let it rise again. No can-do with gluten-free dough. Because the alternative
flours are heavier than wheat flour, gluten-free bread dough only rises once,

123
Chapter 9: Breakfast: Don’t Leave Home Without It
so after mixing the dough, place it in the container in which you intend to
bake it and let it rise.
As bread rises, it shouldn’t be exposed to drafts. A trick that works well is to
heat your oven to 200 degrees. When it reaches that temperature, turn off the
oven and wait 5 minutes, and then place your bread pans in the oven to rise
and close the oven door. Usually your dough will only need to rise between
30 to 45 minutes with this method, depending on the kind of yeast used and
the size of the loaf.
Creating the crust
You can get the desired type of crust on your bread by doing one of the 
following:
 For a shiny crust, warm 1 tablespoon of sugar with 5 tablespoons of milk
just to a simmer, and then brush the liquid on the hot loaves as soon as
they come out of the oven.
 For a soft crust, brush melted butter on the hot, baked loaves of bread,
and then cover them with a clean towel to retain the heat.
 If you want a thin, light crust, place a pan of hot water on the bottom
rack of your oven to create moist heat as your bread bakes.
 For a medium crust, brush milk over the loaves before placing them in
the oven, and then brush them again with milk when the bread is about
halfway through baking.
 Crunchy crusts are also possible. Whip an egg white with 1 tablespoon
of water until it’s frothy, and then brush this on top of the loaves before
baking.
 Finally, if you like a hard crust on your bread, mix together 1⁄2 cup of
water with 1 teaspoon of salt and brush it on the loaves before placing
them in the oven, and then again about halfway through the baking time.
Troubleshooting breads
It may take several attempts at bread making to get it right, so don’t get dis-
couraged if your first try isn’t perfect. Here are a few troubleshooting points
to keep in mind:
 If your baked loaf of bread isn’t fully cooked inside, the easiest remedy 
is to bake the dough in two smaller pans next time. If your bread is still
mushy inside, often the cause may be due to the oven temperature.
Gluten-free products frequently need to be baked at a lower temperature
for a longer period of time. If you lower the oven temperature by 25

124
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
degrees, that may solve the problem. If the loaf starts to get too dark,
cover it with foil halfway through baking. And don’t use dark or Teflon-
coated baking pans. They may cause the bottom of the bread to burn
before the inside is completely baked.
 Periodically you’ll bake a loaf of bread that may suffer from the crum-
bles. It looks pretty and smells divine, but when you go to cut it, it falls
apart. First, do not throw out the crumbs. Dry them out and add season-
ings to make bread crumbs. The cause of the crumbles may be that the
dough was too dry. Next time, slightly reduce the amount of flour used.
Add a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin to the dry ingredients to help bind
the bread (in addition to the xanthan gum called for in a recipe). Before
even trying to cut the loaf, refrigerate it and then slice it with a serrated
knife while it’s cold.
 Finally, let’s address the taste of the bread. Without some precautions,
gluten-free bread can easily taste like cardboard. Fortunately, you 
can add all sorts of things to the dough to avoid this from happening.
Substitute some of the water with a liquid that has flavor, like cold
brewed coffee, honey, maple syrup, molasses, or fruit juice (pineapple,
lemon, orange, or apple). Add extra flavoring (more vanilla or almond
flavoring, cinnamon, Italian seasoning, Parmesan, or cheddar cheese).
You can add toasted seeds (sesame, poppy, caraway, or sunflower) as
well as toasted nuts of all kinds. Toasted coconut or mini chocolate
chips are also optional stir-ins, as are minced dried fruits. Try using dark
brown sugar in place of granulated sugar. And finally, think about substi-
tuting a portion of the gluten-free flour mixture with a flour that has
more flavor, such as cornmeal, almond flour, coconut flour, or sweet
potato flour.
We’ve made these adjustments to the recipes that follow. When you convert a
wheat bread recipe, experiment several times with the options above until
you get a loaf of bread that rises, tastes fantastic, has the ideal crust, and
doesn’t crumble. You can do it!
T French Baguettes
When was the last time you bit into a piece of really good French bread? We’re talking a
light, soft, airy center and a crunchy crust! This bread is perfect for making French
toast, bread pudding, and stuffing mix because the center is porous. If you like, sprinkle
sesame seeds on top of the dough before baking.

T Bagels (or Pretzels)
How great is this! You can make up one batch of dough, divide it, and then make bagels
from one half and pretzels from the other half! Sprinkle sesame seeds or cinnamon
sugar on the bagels before baking and kosher salt on the pretzels. The dough is the
same but the preparation is just a tad different. For bagels, follow the recipe below. For
pretzels, roll the balls of dough into long, thin ropes, and then fold like a pretzel, sealing
the edges of dough securely, and then continue with the raising, boiling, and baking
directions given below.
Tools: Electric mixer
Preparation time: 15 minutes

Chapter 9: Breakfast: Don’t Leave Home Without It
Rising time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 bagels (or 8 soft pretzels)
2 1⁄3 cups gluten-free flour mixture
3 tablespoons dry milk powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
11⁄2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons granulated
sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 1⁄4 teaspoons (1 packet) instant rise yeast
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
1 egg, at room temperature
2 egg whites, at room temperature, plus 1 egg
white
1⁄2 cup warm water (110 degrees), plus 
1 teaspoon water
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. When the oven reaches that temperature, turn the
oven off.
2 Place the flour mixture, milk powder, salt, 11⁄2 tablespoons of sugar, cinnamon, and yeast
in a medium mixing bowl. With the mixer on low, blend the ingredients.
3 Add the butter, egg, and two egg whites to the dry mixture. Whip on low speed until
blended.
4 Add the water. Beat for 31⁄2 minutes.
5 Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and divide it into 8 balls.
6 Roll each ball into a 7-inch rope and then connect the ends of the rope to form a circle,
sealing the ends securely.
7 Lightly grease a baking sheet with corn or olive oil. Place each bagel on the baking
sheet. Cover the bagels with wax paper that has been lightly oiled.
8 Set the baking sheet in the oven for 40 minutes to allow the dough to rise. (It won’t
double in bulk.)
9 Remove the baking sheet from the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
10 Fill a large saucepan with water (about 4 inches deep) and add the remaining 2 tea-
spoons of sugar. Bring the water to a boil.
11 Place 4 bagels at a time in the boiling water and boil for 1 minute, turning each bagel
over after 30 seconds.
12 Cover the baking sheet with wax paper or parchment paper and spray the paper lightly
with cooking spray. (The bagels tend to brown too much on the bottom without the
paper.)
13 Remove the bagels from the water with a slotted spoon and lay them on the paper.
14 Repeat Steps 11 and 13 with the remaining 4 bagels.

15 In a small bowl, whip the remaining egg white with 1 teaspoon of water until frothy.
Brush the mixture on top of the bagels. If desired, sprinkle tops with cinnamon sugar or
sesame seeds.
16 Bake the bagels for 20 minutes.
Vary it! Customize the flavoring of these bagels or pretzels to your own personal taste. In
place of the cinnamon, add 1⁄2 teaspoon dried onion flakes. Fold raisins into the dough. Or
fold shredded cheese into the dough. Your options are only limited by your imagination!

T Flatbread Wrap
Aren’t you tired of the bland, blah, commercial gluten-free tortilla wraps? Do you miss
pita bread? Although this wrap won’t replace pita bread, it’s so easy to make and it’s pli-
able and tastes wonderful. You can make the wraps ahead and freeze them between
sheets of wax paper. To thaw and reheat, merely place the wraps between sheets of
damp paper towels and microwave them for a few moments. Fold the wrap in half to
create a gyro, or fill and roll for a traditional wrap. This flatbread is very flat so that it
will be pliable.
Tools: Rolling pin
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 wraps
1 cup plus 1 teaspoon gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 (heaping) teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
2⁄3 cup warm water (110 degrees)
Nonstick cooking spray
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the flour mixture, the baking powder, salt,
sugar, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.
2 In a small bowl, dissolve the chicken bouillon in the warm water.
3 With a rubber spatula, blend the water mixture into the flour mixture until a dough
forms.
4 Divide the dough into four sections. Roll each section into a ball.

131
Chapter 9: Breakfast: Don’t Leave Home Without It
5 Sprinkle a sheet of plastic wrap with 1⁄4 teaspoon of the remaining flour mixture, place
one of the balls of dough on the plastic wrap, and cover it with a second sheet of plastic
wrap. Using a rolling pin, roll the ball into a flat, 7-inch round about 1⁄8 inch thick. Repeat
with the remaining balls of dough.
6 Heat an 8-inch skillet over medium heat and spray it very lightly with the cooking spray.
7 Place one of the circles of dough in the pan and cook, turning once, for about 3 minutes
total, or until it just begins to brown on each side. (If you overcook these, they won’t be
pliable.) Repeat with the remaining circles of dough.

What a Sweet Idea! Pastries and Muffins
Nature provides us with fresh fruits and vegetables to keep us healthy. But
pastries and muffins were created to keep us happy.
Because these items are derived primarily from a gluten-free flour base, if you
are converting a wheat recipe, you’ll need to add extra flavoring in the form of
stir-ins (nuts, coconut, fresh, canned, or dried fruit, shredded carrots or zuc-
chini, mashed bananas, applesauce or jars of baby fruit, chocolate chips, or
even liqueurs) or added flavoring (extra vanilla, almond, or other liquid fla-
voring plus additional or increased amounts of spices). Add an extra egg and
1 tablespoon of mayonnaise to help the pastry rise. It also helps to substitute
some of the liquid called for in the recipe with something more flavorful, like
brewed coffee, juice, or sweetened condensed milk. The recipes in this sec-
tion already have these adjustments made, so start baking!
T Breakfast Bread Pudding
Now how great is this? A dessert for breakfast! Try to select porous gluten-free bread
for this recipe. Because of the soaking time required, it’s best to assemble this the night
before. You can use orange juice in place of the rum. This is best served warm from the
oven.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

T Cream Cheese Coffeecake
If you peek through the oven window while this breakfast delight is baking, don’t panic
if you see it rising above the edge of your pan — it will shrink back down to normal size
after you remove it from the oven. Broil the topping until it’s bubbling all over. If you
overbroil it, the topping will burn. If you underbroil it, the topping will be too loose, so
keep a close eye on it.

4 Cream the butter and the remaining 1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar in a large bowl
until it’s fluffy.
5 Add the 2 remaining eggs and the remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the butter mixture.
6 Add the sour cream and the milk, and then blend in the flour mixture.
7 Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the cream cheese mixture over the
batter. Use the back of wet spoon to smooth the filling. Pour the remaining batter over
the filling, using the back of a wet spoon to spread the batter evenly.
8 Bake the batter at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean.

T Cranberry Cornmeal Muffins
These muffins are the perfect breakfast accompaniment to scrambled eggs. They also go
well with salads or warmed for a snack. With wheat flour muffins, the directions usually
say, “Stir the ingredients just until blended.” With the gluten-free flours, it’s advisable to
whip the liquid ingredients first to incorporate air so the finished product will be lighter.
Tools: Electric mixer

Whipping Up Pancakes and Waffles
Nothing warms the tummy on a cold morning like hot pancakes fresh off the
griddle. The next time you mix up a bowl of pancake batter, brainstorm and
add something new. Shredded apples, pears, or zucchini are great add-ins to
the batter, as are chopped walnuts or pecans, mashed bananas, miniature
chocolate chips, or a tablespoon of peanut butter (or all four if you’re
daring). Substitute brown sugar for the white sugar or coconut milk for the

whole milk. If you always serve maple syrup for a topping, surprise your family
with new toppings like cherry or strawberry sauce, cinnamon maple butter,
blueberry syrup, apple cinnamon syrup, or maple rum syrup.
When cooking pancakes, use just enough butter to keep the batter from stick-
ing. Too much butter causes the pancakes to brown before they are cooked
through. Or you can lightly brush the pan with a little bit of corn oil instead
of using butter.
Creating perfect gluten-free waffles is both an art and a science. Resist the
urge to overbeat the batter. Spray both sides of the iron generously with
gluten-free nonstick spray. Batter needs room to expand, so only pour in
enough batter to just cover the lower cooking grid — too much batter will
result in a waffle that has a soggy middle. Cook the waffle at a medium-high
setting; too low of a setting results in moisture condensation, and you’ll end
up with a mushy mess. Despite the temptation, wait at least 3 minutes before
opening the iron to check for doneness. When breakfast is over, wash the iron
grates, and then season them with a very light coat of corn oil.

T Baked Apple Pancake
This definitely is not your traditional pancake. You won’t need syrup — just spoon some
of the apple syrup from the bottom of the pan onto the top of each slice of pancake.
Breakfast was never meant to taste this fantastic. The edges of the pancake will rise
during baking and then sink to the level of the pancake after you remove it from the oven.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
3 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoon butter
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1⁄4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 large McIntosh apple, peeled, cored, and
sliced thin
2 eggs
1⁄3 cup milk
1⁄3 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon vanilla
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray.
2 Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large nonstick skillet.
3 Add 1⁄4 cup of granulated sugar, the brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Stir con-
stantly until the sugars melt.

4 Add the apples and sauté, stirring frequently, until the apples are softened (about 15
minutes).
5 Spoon the apples and sauce into the prepared pie pan.
6 In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until they’re frothy. Add the milk and whisk until
the eggs and milk are blended.
7 Add the flour mixture, the remaining 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, the baking
powder, the remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon of cinnamon, the salt, the remaining 2 tablespoons of
butter, and the vanilla to the egg mixture and continue to whisk until blended.
8 Pour the batter over the apples.
9 Bake the pancake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until the pancake is cooked through.
Cut the pancake into wedges to serve, spooning the sauce and apples over the top of
each individual pancake.

Crepe magic
Crepes are versatile and delicious. A few tips
can help you enjoy them more often:
To cook crepes ahead, layer the unfilled crepes
with wax paper between each crepe. You can
wrap them in plastic wrap or slide them into a
self-seal bag and refrigerate them for up to
three days.
To freeze crepes for up to two months, stack the
unfilled crepes between sheets of wax paper.
Wrap the stack in foil and then place the stack
in a self-seal freezer bag. When you’re ready to
use the crepes, thaw them in the refrigerator
overnight.
To reheat thawed crepes in the oven, remove
the stack of crepes from the freezer bag, and
while they’re still wrapped in foil, place the
stack on a baking sheet. Bake the crepes in a
preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes or
until they’re heated through. To reheat the
crepes in the microwave, remove the crepes
from the freezer bag and foil. Then place a stack
of 4 crepes, separated with wax paper, on a
microwave-safe plate. Cover the stack with a
damp paper towel and heat on a medium setting
for 11⁄2 minutes.
To make dessert crepes, work with the Feather-
Light Crepes recipe in this chapter and use one
or more of the following substitutions or addi-
tions:
 Replace 3⁄4 cup of the milk with coconut milk.
 Replace the granulated sugar with brown
sugar.
 Add 3 tablespoons of chocolate syrup to the
batter.
 Add 1 tablespoon of rum or brandy to the
batter.

1 Preheat the broiler.
2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk (or half-and-half).
3 Add the sugar and whisk to blend it in.
4 Stir in the flour mixture until the batter is smooth.
5 Add the melted butter, vanilla, almond flavoring, and salt, stirring with a whisk just until
blended. The batter should be the consistency of thin cream. If it’s too thick, slowly add
more milk as needed.
6 Wrap the handle of an 8-inch nonstick skillet with heavy-duty foil. Heat the skillet over
medium-low heat on the stove.
7 Holding the stick of butter with a paper towel, rub the butter over the entire surface of
the skillet (do not overgrease the pan).
8 Remove the pan from the stove and pour in about 3 tablespoons of batter (a gravy ladle
usually works perfectly for this).
9 Tilt the pan quickly so the batter is evenly distributed.
10 Return the pan to the stovetop and cook the batter for about 1 minute. Lift the edge of
the crepe with a rubber spatula to see when the underside is just beginning to brown.
11 Place the pan under the broiler for 40 seconds, or until the top of the crepe is just
beginning to brown.
12 Remove the crepe from the pan to wax paper and repeat the process from Step 8 with
the remaining batter. It may be necessary to re-butter the pan after the first four crepes.

T Pumpkin Waffles
The waffles we made using this recipe were made on a 7-inch waffle iron that forms 4
small waffles. One 4-piece, 7-inch waffle determines one serving. You may need to adjust
the serving portions in accordance to the size of your waffle iron. And if you think it’s a
bit odd that the cooking time is listed as 24 minutes, wonder no longer. It takes an aver-
age cooking time of 4 minutes per waffle, or a total of 24 minutes to cook 6 waffles. You
may opt to feed your family in shifts as the waffles come hot off the iron . . . or not. A
better option may be to make the waffles ahead and warm them in the oven or in a
toaster just before you call the family in for breakfast.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 24 minutes (4 minutes per waffle)
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
2 eggs
2 egg whites
3 tablespoons brown sugar
13⁄4 cups milk
1⁄2 cup canned pumpkin
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
11⁄2 teaspoons cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon ginger
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
1⁄3 cup toasted finely chopped walnuts
1 Preheat the waffle iron to the medium-high setting.
2 Spray the waffle iron grates with cooking spray.
3 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg whites.
4 Add the brown sugar, milk, pumpkin, and vanilla, and whisk until the ingredients are
completely blended.
5 Sift the flour mixture, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, 
and cloves over the egg mixture. Whisk the mixture together just until everything is
combined.
6 Stir in the walnuts.

7 Pour 3⁄4 cup of batter onto the waffle iron. Cook for 3 minutes, or until the waffle is
cooked through and the outside is crisp. Repeat with the remaining batter, remember-
ing to spray the waffle iron with cooking spray each time.
Note: The exact number of waffles will depend on the size of your waffle iron.

T Cheese Waffles
Wow! Are these waffles ever versatile! Add some bacon crumbles to the batter and you
have a breakfast. Make them as directed below, and you have the perfect “bed” for
sloppy joes. (This may come as a shock, but sloppy joes don’t have to be served on a
bun.) The cheese, onion, green pepper, and even the cornmeal complement the taste of
sloppy joes. Lay a slice of cheese on top of a waffle and stick it in a toaster oven for a
luscious toasted cheese sandwich. Or add a little cumin and cayenne to the batter, then
spread 1 waffle with refried beans, sprinkle it with a little cheese and a dollop of salsa,
and top with a second waffle — tacos were never like this! Try it, you’ll like it!
Preparation time: 12 minutes
Cooking time: 12 minutes (3 minutes per waffle)
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
2 green onions, minced
3 tablespoons minced green pepper
1⁄4 cup corn oil, plus some for sautéing
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1⁄2 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄3 cup sorghum flour
2 tablespoons cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 Preheat the waffle iron to its medium setting.
2 Spray the waffle iron grates with cooking spray.
3 In a small skillet over medium-high heat, sauté the onion and green pepper in oil until
they’re tender but not browned. Remove the pan from heat and let the vegetables cool
slightly.
(continued)

4 In a medium bowl, whisk together the veggies, 1⁄4 cup of oil, the eggs, and milk. Add the
flour mixture, sorghum flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, salt, and pepper, and
whisk until the ingredients are thoroughly blended. (Add a little more milk if the mixture
is too thick.)
5 Stir in the cheese.
6 Pour 3⁄4 cup of batter onto the waffle iron. Cook for 3 minutes, or until the waffle is
cooked through and the outside is crisp. Repeat with the remaining batter, remember-
ing to spray the waffle iron with cooking spray each time.

T Peachy French Toast
French toast always tastes good, but this version is a real winner. Keep the cap on the
bottle of maple syrup because you won’t need it. The peach syrup that goes over the
French toast is two steps up from sublime! You need to have porous gluten-free bread to
make this recipe. The Breakfast Biscuit Bread in this chapter is ideal.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
15-ounce can sliced peaches with syrup
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon plus 4 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon maple flavoring
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
6 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
3⁄4 cup milk
8 slices white bread
1 Coarsely chop the peaches into a small saucepan. Add the syrup from the peaches to
the pan.
2 Stir in the honey, 1 tablespoon of butter, brown sugar, maple flavoring, and 1⁄4 teaspoon
of cinnamon. Heat over medium heat until the butter has melted.

3 In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and water until the cornstarch is dissolved.
Stir this into the peach mixture.
4 Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens (about 4 to 5
minutes).
5 In a medium shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, 1⁄4 teaspoon of cinnamon,
and milk.
6 Melt 2 teaspoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
7 Dip 4 slices of bread, one slice at a time, into the egg mixture. Drain for a moment, and
then cook the slices in a skillet, turning once, until they’re browned on both sides.
8 Melt the remaining 2 teaspoons of butter in the skillet and repeat Step 7 with the
remaining 4 slices of bread.
9 To serve, spoon the warm peach syrup over slices of French toast.

Brunch is usually a feast of fancy drawn out over a
ridiculously long and relaxing time frame, with far
too many calories for normal human consumption.
Certainly not limited to the Sunday variety, brunch
and its same-idea-but-just-a-little-later cousin, lunch,
present the perfect opportunity to decompress
with a midday meal to give you that boost you
need before launching into the rest of your day.
With just a few tweaks and twists, you can enjoy

aren’t gluten-free.

Breaking for Brunches
Overslept, didja? Or is it just a lazy day and you’re getting a late start? Either
way, you missed breakfast time, and that means it’s not breakfast — it’s not
lunch — it’s cleverly combined to make the word brunch.
Breakfast may consist of a bowl of fruit or gluten-free cereal. But brunch —
ah, that’s so much more. Brunch invokes the anticipation of fancier foods that
will amuse and arouse your appetite. Brunches are for cultivated connois-
seurs and aficionados with refined tastes (that’s us — people who like to eat
good food). Just mentioning brunch denotes a wow factor.
You’re likely to find most any concoction offered at a brunch. Sometimes the
fare consists primarily of breakfast foods, but often there are lunch-type
offerings, such as beef, chicken, or seafood with a side of rice, and even
dessert. The plethora of choices is what makes brunches fun.

Make-Ahead Brunch Casserole
Avoid the hassle of having to make all the food the morning of your brunch. Assemble
this dish the day before, and just pop it in the oven before your friends arrive. Then sit
back and listen to the raves! This recipe is for a 9-x-9-inch dish, but you can easily
double the ingredients to fit a 9-x-13-inch pan for a larger crowd.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
3 large Idaho potatoes, boiled, peeled, 
and diced
5 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced
3⁄4 pound low-salt ham, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes
1⁄4 green pepper, minced
1⁄2 medium onion, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated sharp
cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Filet and Eggs a la Béarnaise
This is the ultimate in brunch offerings. The sauce transforms a piece of beef and an egg
into an elegant presentation and yields a taste sensation that will be savored and long
remembered. If you don’t have poaching rings or a poaching pan, break each egg, one at
a time, into a small dish, and then carefully slide the egg into the boiling water.
Tools: Double boiler
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Four 3-ounce filet mignons
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 green onions, minced
3⁄4 cup sherry
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1⁄4 teaspoon thyme
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 egg yolks
1⁄2 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons white vinegar
4 eggs
1 Preheat the broiler.
2 Lay the filets on a broiler pan. Season both sides with 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and 1⁄4 teaspoon
of pepper. Set the meat aside so it can reach room temperature.
3 In a medium skillet, combine the green onions, sherry, lemon juice, thyme, cayenne
pepper, 1⁄8 teaspoon of salt, and 1⁄8 teaspoon of pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until the liquid is reduced by half (about 7 minutes). Remove the sherry mix-
ture from the heat, pour it into a small bowl, and let it cool. Then strain the mixture into
a small bowl and discard the solids.
4 Put the egg yolks in the top pan of the double boiler. (The water in the bottom pan should
not be touching the top pan.) With a wire whisk, beat the egg yolks over medium heat
until they’re light and lemon colored (about 1 minute). Do not let the eggs begin to cook.
5 While beating the eggs, slowly add the melted butter, and then immediately stir in the
reserved sherry mixture. Continue stirring and cooking the sauce over medium-low
heat until the sauce starts to thicken. Remove from the heat.
6 Broil the filets to the desired doneness (about 7 minutes for medium), turning once.
Remove the filets from the oven and place them on breakfast plates.
7 Fill a 10-inch skillet half full with water. Add the vinegar (this helps cook the egg white
faster so it doesn’t spread). Bring the water to a slow boil.
8 Break one egg at a time into a shallow dish, and then gently slide the egg into the water,
taking care not to break the yolk. (If you do break the yolk, use a spoon to remove the
egg and start over with a fresh egg.) Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook the eggs

3 minutes, or until the egg whites are set but the yolks remain soft. Remove the eggs
with a slotted spoon, allowing the edges to drain.
9 Place 1 poached egg on top of each filet. Spoon béarnaise sauce over the eggs.

Ham with Glazed Bananas
If you like Bananas Foster, you’re going to love this new rendition with ham. Select fairly
firm bananas so they don’t get too soft when cooked. If the ham you select has skin or
rind encircling it, it’s best to cut it off before preparing this dish.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 tablespoons plus 1 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1⁄4 cup dark corn syrup
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon

Potato Tomato Pie
It’s far too messy and time consuming to make hash brown potatoes for a crowd.
Besides, hash browns are ordinary. Not only is this pie delicious, but it looks impres-
sive. You can serve it at a brunch, as a side dish for dinner, and even as a main entrée
with a tossed salad.

Nonstick cooking spray
2 cups firmly packed grated raw potatoes
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1⁄4 cup grated onion
3 or 4 medium tomatoes, sliced 1⁄8-inch thick
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
8 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled
3⁄4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3⁄4 cup mayonnaise
1⁄3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray.

on top of the tomatoes and then spread it carefully to cover the top of the pie.
8 Sprinkle the bread crumbs on top of the pie. Bake the pie uncovered at 350 degrees for
30 minutes, or until the bread crumbs begin to brown.

Potato Nests with Shrimp
We have five senses. Obviously, when we’re hungry, taste is key. However, the sense of
sight also plays a role. If food is presented in an appealing, enticing manner, we begin to
anticipate how absolutely wonderful it will taste. These potato nests are the perfect pre-
sentation for this shrimp dish.

Midday Munchables, Gluten-Free Style
A human being can only consume so many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
before the body screams for something new for lunch. The primary issue for
celiacs is that the bread needed to make sandwiches is often — ahem — less
than adequate in the taste department. (That was as tactful as I could be, con-
sidering many gluten-free breads resemble crumbly cardboard.) Lucky for
you, this book contains recipes for excellent breads (see Chapters 8 and 9).
Gluten-free lunches seem to be a challenge for many people. Rest assured
that your choices are vast.
Variety is the key. Switch foods and alter combinations to make lunch an
event of anticipation. One day add deviled or hard-boiled eggs; the next day
add salsa and gluten-free tortilla chips. Include veggies as often as possible,
whether it’s carrot sticks with dip or celery stuffed with peanut butter. If time
is a factor, add no-fuss items like applesauce, gelatin cups, or flavored yogurt;
or pack a few gluten-free crackers to have with cheese slices or to spread
with hummus. For a treat, take a sandwich made from gluten-free sweet bread
slices spread with cream cheese.
Meals on the move
If you work, you probably have little time in the morning to dawdle in the
kitchen preparing a homemade bag lunch. For kids on a gluten-free diet, the
problem is compounded because many children are picky eaters. But with a
little preplanning and unlimited ingenuity, you can create many viable alter-
natives, even if you’re on the run.
Miracles of the microwave
What did we do without microwaves? Fortunately, most workplaces and even
schools have microwaves that employees or teachers can use. These appli-
ances can be a lifesaver when you’ve made something at home and need to
warm it up for your midday meal.
One idea is to make your own “lunchables” from dinner leftovers. Nearly
every grocery store carries divided, plastic, lidded containers that are ideal
for making these handy lunches. To prevent spoilage, freeze your meal in the
container so you take a frozen package with you in the morning; by
lunchtime, it will be thawed and ready to heat.
Other gluten-free foods conducive to being warmed in a microwave include
pizza, lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, crustless quiche, and twice-baked 
potatoes.

155
Chapter 10: Brilliant Brunches, Luscious Lunches
If you’re making mashed potatoes for dinner, bake the potatoes (instead of
boiling them); remove most of the insides (also referred to as “guts”) to make
the mashed potatoes, and leave the skins intact. Then make your own potato
skins topped with cheddar cheese, sliced green onions, and crumbled bacon
(Chapter 15 has a potato skins recipe if you need a little more direction).
Potato skins make a fun lunch for kids and adults.
Another fun microwavable lunch is a hot dog topped with American cheese
and wrapped in a corn tortilla (wrap it all in waxed paper to heat in the
microwave). Tamales, quesadillas, and Chinese stir-fry add variety to your
lunch and warm easily in the microwave, too.
Think about a thermos
If you think a thermos is just for coffee, think again. Ah, so you think you’re
quite the adventurer because you’ve been brave enough to spoon chili or
stew into a thermos? Now think even further outside the box — be daring!
Pack a gluten-free bun and spoon sloppy joe mix into the insulated container.
By the way, many sloppy joe mixes available at the grocery store — even
generics — are gluten-free.
You can also fill a thermos with boiling water and add corn on the cob, or 
one or two hot dogs. A thermos is great for taco meat (spoon it on top of a
salad at lunchtime), pork and beans, hot dog slices and beans, or sausage in
barbecue sauce. Rice dishes and gluten-free pasta entrees — everything from
Spanish rice and beans, to gluten-free pasta marinara, to fettuccini Alfredo, to
macaroni and cheese — hold well in a thermos.
Quickie cold lunches
If you’re cool with cold, there’s no end to your lunch selections. For entrees,
here are just a few suggestions. Remember, creativity is key:
 Baked or fried chicken or chicken wings
 Cold poached salmon, plain or spread with mayonnaise
 Shrimp with cocktail sauce
 Cold sliced steak, chicken, or sushi
 Tomato stuffed with tuna fish
 Cottage cheese with fruit

Satisfying salads
Salads are gaining popularity as a lunch entrée, whether it’s a (gluten-free, of
course) pasta salad, shrimp or crab salad, chicken Caesar salad, or chicken
pineapple salad. You can also enjoy the traditional potato salad made with
mayonnaise and a hint of mustard, or a Greek potato salad made with green
pepper, onion, olive oil, and cider vinegar. A chef salad is an excellent way to
use up leftovers in the refrigerator. And let’s not forget healthy bean salad.
(Chapter 16 features salad recipes.)
If the salad is your main dish, treat yourself to an antipasto of marinated
cubes of pepperoni, shredded chicken, cheese, olives, tomato wedges, arti-
choke hearts, and pepperoncini.
Craving croutons on your salad? Try tortilla chips instead. You can also
check out several varieties of gluten-free salad toppings in the veggie section
of your grocery store.
Hot or cold sandwiches
Oh, sure, so the days of throwing together a sandwich with cheap and easy-
to-find bread may be a thing of the past — but prepare to be amazed because
you have plenty of sandwich options, even in the gluten-free world.
It’s time to try new innovations with old favorites. The common favorites —
chicken breast sandwich, toasted cheese sandwich, tuna sandwich, and
sloppy joes — have been modified, altered, enhanced, disguised, and trans-
formed into totally new creations of savory sustenance.
If you want something small to have with your sandwich, try coleslaw or mar-
inated vegetables.
If you enjoy sandwiches made on gluten-free bread, break the routine of deli
lunchmeats with meatloaf, egg salad, or Reuben sandwiches.
Okay, I’m the first to admit that gluten-free bread is — ahem — a matter of
taste. Either ya do or ya don’t do gluten-free breads. So if you don’t want the
bread, don’t worry. You can improvise and make a sandwich out of just about
anything else. Try wrapping lunchmeat around a piece of string cheese — or, if
you’re more daring, add a piece or two of marinated asparagus before wrapping.
Make toothpick kabobs of cubes of lunchmeat, cheese, pickles, and olives.

Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwich
You’ve had grilled cheese . . . and grilled cheese with tomato slices . . . and perhaps even
grilled cheese with bacon. But you’ve never had a grilled cheese sandwich like this. We’re
talking real flavor here — new window dressing for an old-time American standby.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 4 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 thin slices olive oil bread
1⁄4 cup prepared pesto
4 slices mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 red peppers, roasted and cut in half (or use
canned, prepared red roasted peppers)
4 slices provolone cheese
4 slices deli ham
2 teaspoons brown mustard
1 Brush 1⁄4 tablespoon of the oil on one side of 2 slices of bread. Place them, oiled side
down, in a large skillet.
2 Spread 1 tablespoon of the pesto on top of each of the two slices of bread in the skillet.
Top each with a slice of mozzarella cheese, and then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of minced
onion over the two slices, dividing evenly.
3 Lay a pepper half on top of the onion. Top each sandwich with a slice of provolone
cheese. Lay a slice of ham on top of the provolone.
4 Spread 1⁄2 teaspoon of mustard on two slices of bread and place, mustard-side down, on
top of the sandwich.
5 Brush 1⁄4 tablespoon of oil on top of the 2 assembled sandwiches.
6 Grill the sandwiches over medium-high heat, 2 minutes per side, or until each side is
golden. Press lightly with a spatula during cooking so the cheese melts completely.
Repeat Steps 1 through 6 to make remaining two sandwiches. Use a griddle if you want
to make all 4 sandwiches at the same time.

Wraps and Other Sandwich Containers
Do you like wraps? If you can’t find a premade loaf of gluten-free bread to
your liking and you haven’t had time to bake your own bread, don’t despair.
There are other viable sandwich “containers.”
If you haven’t tried a peanut butter and jelly sandwich made on gluten-free
waffles, you have a taste-treat awaiting you. Purchase corn tortillas made
from either yellow or white corn. Corn taco shells, precooked of course, are a
crisp, fun holder for a multitude of fillings. Pancakes and crepes make won-
derful wraps. And lettuce leaves are the ideal holders for lunchmeat and
cheese. (If you feel daring, use Belgian endive leaves; they’re shaped like
boats and make a neat container for tuna and chicken salads.)

161
Chapter 10: Brilliant Brunches, Luscious Lunches
If you’d like, avoid the wrap altogether and pack a sandwich filling (like tuna or
egg salad) in a container and take along a gluten-free muffin. Gluten-free crackers
are also an alternative, and they’re now available in many different flavors and
textures. You can probably find them at your neighborhood grocery store.
Corn tortillas are available just about anywhere. Even the new gluten-free
“flour” tortillas are excellent, and you can find them in most health food
stores or online, usually in the frozen-foods section. After you bring them
home, keep them refrigerated if you plan to use them within the week, or
freeze them. To soften the tortillas so they don’t crack when you wrap them,
place them between two sheets of dampened paper towels and microwave
them for a few seconds.
Eata pita
Okay, you won’t find them in every grocery
store, but there are gluten-free pitas available.
If you can’t find them, don’t worry — you can
make a good homemade version. Because the
alternative flours are heavier, you may not
always be able to cut open the pocket of the pita
without destroying the integrity of the bread
(which means it very well may crumble and fall
apart). The good news is that you can make a
marvelous pita flatbread, sans pocket, that is
thin enough so you can place the filling on the
bread, and then fold the bread in half to form a
sandwich (the Mediterranean equivalent of a
taco). Flip to Chapter 9 for a good flatbread recipe.

Reuben Quesadillas
These quesadillas are great eaten fresh off the griddle, but you can also make them
ahead and pack them in a bag for lunchtime. Ideally, you fill the tortilla, and then fold it
in half, but the gluten-free tortillas don’t always cooperate. To avoid having the tortilla
break apart, just cut it in half from the start.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Three 10-inch tortillas, cut in half
11⁄2 teaspoons hot mustard
8 ounces deli corned beef, sliced thin
8-ounce can sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
6 slices low-fat Swiss cheese
1 Spread 3 of the tortilla halves with 1⁄2 teaspoon of mustard.
2 Divide the corned beef in thirds; lay 1 portion on each of 3 halves of the tortilla.
3 Divide the sauerkraut in thirds; lay 1 portion on top of the corned beef on each tortilla.
4 Lay 2 slices of Swiss cheese on top of the sauerkraut on each quesadilla.
5 Cover each quesadilla with the remaining 3 tortilla halves.
6 Cut each tortilla semicircle in half to make a total of 6 halves.
7 Place the quesadillas in a large skillet that has been prewarmed over medium-high heat,
and toast the quesadillas on each side until the tortillas are lightly browned and the
cheese is melted.
Vary It! You can substitute different ingredients for the contents of the quesadilla, using
pastrami in place of the corned beef and/or provolone cheese in place of Swiss.

Turkey Roll-Ups
The beauty of these roll-ups is that each time you make them, you can vary the ingredi-
ents. One time substitute roast beef, American cheese, and watercress, or corned beef
and Swiss cheese with mustard. Use thin tomato slices or banana pepper rings in place
of the roasted peppers, or sliced pepperoncini in place of the banana peppers. Rice
paper wraps are a nice exchange for the tortillas. Oh, so many choices!

Pizza (No Foolin’)
When you first thought of cooking gluten-free, visions of bread and spaghetti
floating away filled your mind. Chances are, the next looming image was
pizza. Dispel those negative thoughts because you can have all three! You can
make gluten-free pizza to your liking with thick or thin crust, but you’ll need
to add extra flavoring, usually in the form of Italian seasoning.
Thin crust? Thick crust? You decide. The recipe below is for a thicker crust. If
you prefer a thinner crust pizza, use a larger pan and roll the dough thinner.
The challenge with gluten-free pizza dough is in the spreading. To get a light
textured crust, the dough must be sticky to work with. You can add extra
flour if you want to roll out the dough, but the baked crust won’t be as light
as one that isn’t rolled. When spreading the crust in the pan, dip your fingers
in warm water to keep the dough from sticking to your hands.

T Three-Cheese Pizza
This pizza is so far beyond the traditional concept. There’s no sauce, but it doesn’t need
any because the cheeses melt and meld and mingle together to form a covering that
surpasses sublime. It’s more than a cheese bread, so the only appropriate name has to
be “cheese pizza.”
Tools: Electric mixer
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 teaspoons sugar
1 packet (2 1⁄2 teaspoons) quick rising yeast
2⁄3 cup warm water (115 degrees)
11⁄3 cup gluten-free flour mixture
3⁄4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons grated 
Romano cheese
1 tablespoon plus 1⁄2 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon cornmeal
4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast in warm water. Set aside for 5 minutes.
3 In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour mixture, milk powder, salt, baking
powder, gelatin, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of the Romano cheese.
4 In another small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the vinegar, and honey.
5 Add the oil mixture to the flour mixture and stir until well blended.
6 Add the yeast water to the flour mixture, and use the electric mixer to beat the mixture
on high speed for 3 minutes. The dough should be very soft and moist.
7 Grease the bottom of a 12-inch pizza pan with 1⁄2 teaspoon of olive oil and then sprinkle
it with cornmeal.
8 With dampened hands, press the dough into the bottom of the pan, building up the
sides a bit to hold in the toppings.
9 Bake the dough at 425 degrees for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven and put
on the toppings.
10 First sprinkle the feta cheese, then the mozzarella, then the remaining 2 tablespoons of
the Romano cheese on top of the crust.
11 Return the pizza to the oven and bake it at 425 degrees for an additional 15 minutes, or
until the top is nicely browned.
Tip: For a pizza with a thinner crust, use a baking sheet; for a deep-dish pizza, use an 
11-x-7-inch pan.
Vary It! This pizza base may be used to make the traditional pizza with tomato sauce,
mozzarella, or provolone cheese, and your favorite toppings. Or you can make your own
calzones by dividing the dough into 4 pieces; pat each piece out on a sheet of wax paper,
place your favorite filling on one half, then fold the other half of the dough over and seal
well (forming a half-moon shape), then bake your calzone at 425 degrees for 20 minutes or
until lightly browned.

As much as Americans enjoy their sandwiches at lunchtime, sometimes you’re
ready for something different. When the hungries hit at noontime, the casserole
recipes in this section can lend variety to your nourishment fare and leave
your tummy feeling full and content.
Casseroles became popular in America during World War I when certain food
items were scarce. Leftovers were chopped up and mixed with whatever else
was available, and then put in a glass or metal pan and baked. The virtues of
these easy-to-prepare meals are many.
You can prepare the ingredients ahead of time and then slide the pan in the
oven just before you’re ready to eat. Casseroles are flexible because they can
encompass leftovers and often use inexpensive meats. And these one-pan
dishes can be anything from a vegetable conglomeration (for example, the
much-overused but still-popular green bean casserole) to main dishes and
even desserts.
Here are some casserole hints that will make your life easier:
 When making a casserole, make two. It’s just as easy to double the ingre-
dients and then freeze half so you have a spare on those days when you
don’t have time to cook. Preferably you’ll have time to let the frozen
casserole thaw in the refrigerator overnight before baking. If you’re
baking the casserole from a frozen state, you may need to almost double
the baking time. And be very careful about freezing casseroles in glass
dishes. If a glass casserole dish is cold and is set on a hot oven rack, the
dish can crack.
 If you’re cooking for a small brood and don’t want to buy a whole head
of cauliflower, broccoli, or whatever because you’ll have too much left
over, pick up just the amount you need from the salad bar available at
most grocery stores.
 Fresh herbs tend to lose their flavor during prolonged baking at high
heat. If your casserole will bake for more than 20 minutes, it may be
better to use dried herbs instead.
 To convert almost any casserole to au gratin, just stir in some shredded
cheese and then mix together some grated cheese, gluten-free bread
crumbs, and a little melted butter to sprinkle on top before baking.
Don’t you hate it when a recipes calls for a 3-quart dish? You know what a 9-x-
9-inch pan looks like, but which of your casserole dishes holds 3 quarts? The
easiest way to find out is to fill a measuring cup with water and pour it into
the most likely pan until you know its capacity.

Pepperoni Squares
Kids love these “nibbles.” A pizza spin-off, these squares can be prepared the night
before, covered, and refrigerated. Just before lunch, pop them in the oven. Or bake
them ahead and then wrap them in foil to reheat in the oven. If you cut the pieces
smaller (24 pieces per pan), you can serve the squares as an appetizer.

S
ome people think fish is fish. But oh, how
wrong they are. Think of the options. Do you
want to cook it with dry heat (baking, barbecuing,
blackening, bronzing, broiling, microwaving), or
use moist heat (steaming, poaching), or fry the
fish (deep-frying, pan-frying)? When you’ve made
up your mind about how to cook it, then you’re
confronted with further queries: Should it be marinated? Stuffed? Breaded?
Basted? Glazed? Served with a sauce?
Before you become totally overwhelmed with choices, take a look at some of
the recipes in this chapter and realize that fish can make a fabulous dish!

Reeling in Compliments with 
Fish and Seafood Dishes
Unlike meat, fish is naturally tender and requires short cooking times at a
high temperature. All fish and seafood are naturally gluten-free. Below are
some general guidelines for cooking fish:
 Measure fish at its thickest part.
 Allow 10 minutes of cooking time per inch of thickness for fresh fish.
 Allow 20 minutes of cooking time per inch of thickness for frozen fish.
 Fish is ready when it’s opaque but still juicy. Sometimes if you cook a
filet until it flakes easily with a fork, it will be overdone and dried out.
Raw fish is translucent, kind of like frosted glass. You certainly can’t look
through it, but it’s not solid either. Cooked fish is opaque and solid,
meaning you can’t see through it at all.
 Baking fish in an aluminum pan can create a chemical reaction that leaves
the fish tasting acidic. It’s best to bake fish in a glass or stainless steel pan.
 Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.
Broiled, Baked, and Poached
Fish is a highly nutritious food commodity. It provides protein, far fewer calories
than meat, and is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. (Isn’t it odd that we’re always
being told to stay away from fatty foods, yet certain fatty acids are good for us?)
Omega-3 has many health benefits including lowering triglycerides and help-
ing to prevent heart disease and blood clots, improving brain function, as
well as helping with high blood pressure, diabetes, strokes, depression,
arthritis, allergies, circulation problems, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease, skin 
disorders, gout, and lowering the risk of osteoporosis in post-menopausal
women. The primary source for this fatty acid is fatty fish such as salmon,
mackerel, sardines, and herring. Opt to buy fish that comes from the deep
sea (as opposed to farm-raised) so it will be as pollutant-free as possible.

1 Preheat the broiler.
2 Using the cooking spray, grease an 8-x-10-inch baking dish. Rinse the filets, pat them
dry, and lay them in a single layer in the baking dish.
3 In a small bowl, stir the butter, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne
pepper, thyme, oregano, and sugar into a paste.
4 Spoon 1⁄4 of the mixture on top of each filet; spread the topping evenly over each piece
of fish.
5 Broil the filets for 7 to 8 minutes or until the fish is baked through.

Grilled Cajun Orange Roughy
This fish dish will definitely awaken your taste buds! The mild flavor of the orange
roughy doesn’t compete with the spicy paste, and the whole combination teases the
tongue just a bit. If you like your foods super-hot, add more cayenne. Do not overcook
the filets, or the fish may become tough.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
Four 5-ounce orange roughy filets
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1⁄8 teaspoon sugar

Sesame Pretzel Fish
The fish may be prepared ahead, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated until
you’re ready to bake it. If bass is not available, you can substitute orange roughy.
Orange roughy is not as thick as bass, so you may have to reduce the baking time. You
can add additional sesame seeds to the crumb mixture if you like.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
Two 2.65-ounce bags sesame pretzel rings
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
3⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3 whole
lemons)
11⁄2 tablespoons brown mustard
Four 5-ounce filets of bass
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a 9-x-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2 Puree 1 bag of pretzels at a time in a blender; empty the crumbs into a gallon-size self-
seal plastic bag.
3 Add the salt, pepper, dill, and garlic powder to the plastic bag; seal the bag and shake
well to mix the ingredients.
4 In a shallow bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and brown mustard.
5 Rinse the filets and pat them dry. Place the filets in the lemon-mustard mixture and let
them marinate for 3 minutes.
6 Remove the bass and place them in the bag with the crumbs. Seal the bag and shake it
to coat the filets evenly.
7 Place each piece of fish in a single layer in the prepared baking dish and bake the filets
at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.
Tip: Ground pretzels, especially ones with sesame seeds, make an excellent coating for
oven-baked chicken, too!

Salmon with Mustard Dill Sauce
Oh, my gosh! This recipe so surpasses “good!” If possible, use wild salmon. It’s deeper in
color and has a much richer taste than farm-raised salmon. Before preparing this dish,
remove the skin from the salmon by using a very sharp, thin knife.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
177
Chapter 11: Something’s Fishy ‘Round Here
1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
Four 5-ounce wild salmon filets with the 
skin removed
1⁄2 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons slivered almonds
2 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1
whole lemon)
1 teaspoon brown mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Lightly oil an 8-x-11-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Rinse and pat the filets
dry, and place the fish in a single layer in the dish.
3 Combine the dill, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, garlic, almonds, onion, lemon juice,
brown mustard, pepper, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a blender. Puree the ingredi-
ents for 10 seconds, scrape down the blender’s sides with a spatula, and then puree for
10 more seconds.
4 Spread the sauce over the fish, dividing evenly.
5 Bake the filets at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes or until a fork inserted in the thick-
est part of the salmon turns easily.

Poached Salmon Piccata
For all of you who are trying to squeeze into a bikini, this dish is low calories and lower
in fat. Plus, it’s simple to prepare and tastes delicious. The benefit of eating salmon is its
high Omega-3 content. You may opt to serve this over a bed of gluten-free noodles or on
a bed of cooked spinach.

2 Reduce the heat to medium and add the salmon. Cover the skillet and simmer the filets
for 7 to 8 minutes (cook 10 minutes per inch of thickness at the thickest part) or until
the fish flakes easily with a fork. (You won’t need to turn the fish over during cooking.)
3 Remove the fish from the skillet with a wide spatula to prevent the salmon from break-
ing apart. Discard the remaining liquid in the pan.

Seafood Crepes and Casseroles
The recipes in this section provide more-creative ways to get fish in your
meals. And more fish is a good thing. Fish and seafood are lower in saturated
fat, total fat, and calories than comparable portions of meat or poultry.
Oysters are the least-consumed seafood even though they are loaded with zinc,
which has been proven to be an aphrodisiac. Rumor has it that Casanova, the
infamous 18th-century lover, ate 50 oysters for breakfast every day!

Seafood Sole
Talk about “sole” food! If you prepare this dish for company, you may opt to stuff each
piece of fish with the seafood mixture, and then roll it up, secure it with a toothpick,
and pour the sauce over the top before baking. It makes a beautiful presentation . . .
especially if you remember to remove the toothpicks before serving it! Be sure to use
lump crabmeat because imitation crabmeat usually isn’t gluten-free.

Salmon Crepes
Stuffed “anything” always makes an impressive presentation, but when you stuff crepes,

Seafood au Gratin
This absolutely delicious combination is perfect for a buffet table. Serve it with rice or
gluten-free noodles to compete the entrée. Don’t substitute milk for the half-and-half, or
the sauce won’t be as thick and rich. Use real crabmeat; the imitation crabmeat may not
be gluten-free.

Tuna Broccoli Casserole
Even people who don’t like broccoli love this casserole. You can assemble this dish
ahead of time, cover and refrigerate it, then bake it at dinnertime. Casseroles don’t get
much easier than this one. Don’t omit the thyme — that’s what gives this dish its spe-
cial flavor. For this recipe, I used Progresso Creamy Mushroom Soup (which is already
diluted). Because companies change their recipes and ingredients regularly, check the
label ingredients to make sure the soup is gluten-free before you purchase it.

 Clucking over poultry casseroles
A
barbecued chicken leg is hot off the grill,
dripping with sauce, and sitting on your
plate. You’re starving, and the aroma is activating
all of your sensory glands. Are you really going to
use your fork and knife? Or are you going to dive
down with both hands and pick it up? According
to Emily Post, “Birds are not eaten with the fingers
in company!” Fortunately, Miss Manners counters
with the advice that hands can definitely be used
in the enjoyment and consumption of said bird.
(Like any of us really cares what either of them has to say!)
Few foods are as versatile as chicken. First, you need to decide what kind of
chicken to buy — free-range or farm-raised, light meat or dark meat, whole
chickens or separate parts, diced or shredded or strips, fresh or frozen, pre-
marinated or plain, bone-in or boned. After you’ve made these decisions,
then you have to figure out how you’re going to prepare the bird. It can be
grilled, stewed, baked, roasted, stuffed, broiled, boiled, oven-fried, deep-fried,
pan-fried, microwaved, or cooked in a slow cooker. With all these choices, it
can be difficult to pick just one.
The recipes in this chapter will come to your rescue. Connie and I have taken
America’s favorite food and dressed it up in new ways. Now the only decision
you have to make is which of these recipes you’re going to make first!

Flocking to Baked, Broiled, 
and Pan-Fried Dishes
Short of the chop-everything-into-one-baking-dish-and-cover-with-gluten-free-cream-of-
mushroom-soup casseroles, the most common ways to prepare chicken are baked,
broiled, and pan-fried. Below are some new ways to re-create the chicken dinner.

Honey Broiled Chicken
It doesn’t seem possible that an entrée as simple to prepare as this one can taste so
great. Your family will think you slaved for hours over a hot stove. (Go ahead, let them
think that.) Use bone-in chicken pieces so the meat stays moist during broiling. If you
opt to put the chicken on the grill, baste frequently with pan juices.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
Four 6-ounce bone-in chicken thighs
Juice from 1 lemon
4 tablespoons butter
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
5 teaspoons sugar
2 tablespoons brown mustard
4 teaspoons honey
1 Preheat the broiler. Spray a 9-x-9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.
2 Place the chicken, skin side up, in the baking dish. Squeeze the lemon juice over the
chicken.
3 Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the
salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Spoon the butter sauce over the chicken thighs.
4 Broil the chicken for 20 minutes, turning once.
5 In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, mustard, and honey. Brush half of the mixture
over the chicken pieces and return to the broiler for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken
pieces over, brush with the remaining sauce, and broil for 5 minutes more.

Corn Chip Chicken
Kids of all ages will love this. The coating stays crisp, and it’s every bit as good as fried
chicken. The breading will stick regardless of whether you keep the skin on the pieces.
For convenience, you can bread the chicken ahead, cover it, and refrigerate it until
baking time. This recipe uses chicken legs, but you can use the pieces your family likes
best. Serve this once, and your family will beg you to make it again!

Chapter 12: Tastes Like Chicken: Poultry Dishes
9.75-ounce bag corn chips
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
4 tablespoons melted butter
5 whole chicken legs (leg and thigh)
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 Pour half of the corn chips into a blender and purée; pour the fine crumbs into a self-
seal plastic bag. Repeat with the second half of corn chips.
3 Add the pepper, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika to the corn chips and mix
well to distribute the spices evenly.
4 Dip one chicken piece into the melted butter, and then place it in the bag. Seal the bag
and shake it to coat the chicken with crumbs. Repeat with the remaining chicken
pieces.
5 Place the chicken in an 8-x-11-inch baking dish.
6 Bake the chicken at 375 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked
through. (You don’t need to turn the chicken pieces during cooking.)

Parmesan Chicken with 
Fresh Tomato Salsa
You may find it a little tricky to get the cheese coating to stick to the chicken. What
works best is to pound the cheese in with the flat side of a meat mallet. Add no salt to
the chicken — the cheese provides all the salt needed.
Tools: Meat mallet
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
188
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
Four 4-ounce boneless skinless chicken
breasts
8 teaspoons sherry
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups coarsely shredded Parmesan cheese
(do not use canned grated cheese)
1⁄3 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 medium onion, chopped
1⁄2 small green pepper, chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
4 plum Roma tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 On a cutting board and using the meat mallet, pound the thicker portion of each
chicken breast to make the thickness of the pieces uniform.
2 Pour the sherry into a shallow bowl.
3 Mix 1⁄4 teaspoon of pepper, the cheese, and bread crumbs together on a sheet of wax
paper.
4 Dip each chicken breast in the sherry, moistening both sides, and then press the
breasts firmly into the cheese mixture, covering both sides of each breast. Use a meat
mallet to help the cheese adhere to the meat.
5 In a medium skillet over medium heat, sauté the onion, green pepper, and garlic in 1
tablespoon of olive oil, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the
Italian seasoning, salt, 1⁄4 teaspoon of pepper, tomatoes, and parsley. Continue cooking
until the mixture is heated through.
6 Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of oil. Set the
breasts in the skillet and cook 5 to 6 minutes per side, until the cheese is light golden
and the chicken is cooked through.
7 Remove the breasts from the skillet and set them on paper toweling to drain the 
excess oil.

8 To serve, place the chicken breasts on a serving platter and spoon the tomato salsa
over the chicken breasts.

Creole Chicken
As the Caribbean song so aptly says, “Hot! Hot! Hot!” I’ve tamed this version of Creole
Chicken somewhat to accommodate most tastes, but if you like really spicy hot food,
add more cayenne pepper.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 ribs celery, thinly sliced
1⁄2 green pepper, finely diced
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
8-ounce can tomato sauce
1 cup water
2 bay leaves
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 rounded teaspoon cayenne pepper
Four 5-ounce bone-in skinless chicken breasts
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a medium skillet over medium heat, sauté the garlic, onion, celery, and green pepper
in oil, stirring frequently, until tender (about 4 minutes).
3 Stir in the parsley flakes, tomato sauce, water, bay leaves, salt, and cayenne pepper.
Simmer 2 more minutes.
4 Place the chicken in a 9-x-9-inch baking dish. Pour the sauce over the chicken.
5 Bake the chicken at 350 degrees for 35 minutes and then cover with foil and bake
another 15 minutes until the chicken is very tender.

Stuffed Rock Cornish Game Hens
Ask the butcher to cut each hen in half. Hens come defeathered, but they tend to have a
few straggling hairs, so clean the hens well before prepping. (How impressive would it
be to set this fancy presentation in front of guests . . . and then they spot hairs protrud-
ing from the carcass? There goes the ambiance!) Soak the rice early in the day.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 11⁄2 hours
Yield: 4 servings
190
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
1 cup rice
2 Rock Cornish game hens, halved
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon plus 2 tablespoons butter
5 cups chicken broth, divided
1⁄2 cup sherry
2 green onions, sliced thin
3 tablespoons slivered almonds
1 large red pepper, roasted and chopped
1⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon dried mint
2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
1⁄2 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons brown mustard
2 ounces (about 1⁄2 cup) shredded Swiss
cheese
1 Early in the day, put the rice in a small bowl and cover it with water. Let it soak for sev-
eral hours, and then rinse the rice in a strainer under cold water until the water runs
clear. Drain.
2 Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
3 Rub the oil over the hens, inside and out. Place the hens in a 9-x-13-inch baking dish, 
cut side down. Sprinkle them with 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and 1⁄4 teaspoon of pepper, and the
paprika. Cut 1 tablespoon of the butter into small pieces and place it on top of the hens.
Pour 2 cups of the chicken broth and the sherry into the pan around the hens.
4 Bake the hens at 500 degrees for 5 minutes, and then lower the heat to 350 degrees and
continue baking for 15 minutes. Cover the hens with foil and bake for 25 minutes more,
or until the leg twists easily.
5 In a medium saucepan, sauté the onion and almonds in 2 tablespoons of butter over
medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened. Add the roasted red
pepper, 1 cup of chicken broth, 1⁄4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, dill, mint, and pars-
ley. Bring to a boil.

6 Lower the heat and stir in the rinsed, drained rice. Cover the pan and cook approxi-
mately 15 minutes, or until the moisture has been absorbed. Remove from the heat.
7 In a small saucepan, stir together 2 cups of chicken broth, the half-and-half, cornstarch,
and mustard. Using a whisk, stir until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the cheese and
cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the sauce thickens.
8 To serve, place a compressed mound of rice on each dish. Place a hen half on top, and
then spoon the sauce over the top.

Poultry Casseroles That 
Will Fly Off the Plate
Think of casseroles as energy conservation. You bake everything in one pot,
so you usually only have to clean one pot after dinner. You don’t have to dish
out a vegetable, a starch, and an entrée — with one large spoon, you can
serve up an entire meal.
Casseroles also fall into the category of food conservation and utilization. Do
you have two carrots at the bottom of your vegetable bin that are starting to
dry out and one last green onion that’s starting to outlive its prime? Chop
them up, sauté them in a little oil until they’re soft, and then add them to any
casserole. It’s a much wiser alternative than waiting two more days and then
throwing them out. Other ingredients that are prime candidates for adding to
casseroles include that partially used bag of peas in the back of your freezer,
the last cube of gluten-free chicken bouillon that’s been sitting in your cup-
board since 1998, and bits of fresh spinach that are left in the bag from that
spinach salad you made four days ago.
If you’re looking for something besides gluten-free breadcrumbs to top your
casseroles, try crushed Funyuns, crushed corn chips or potato chips, crushed
gluten-free cereals, crumbled bacon, shredded cheese (add this toward the
end of the baking time), gluten-free cracker crumbs, or chopped nuts.

Easy Company Chicken
Who really wants to spend all of their time in the kitchen preparing foods the day
before company arrives? Casseroles don’t get much easier than this one. And when
your friends ring your doorbell, do you want to be stuck in the kitchen preparing last-
minute foods, or would you rather be sitting down and enjoying their company? This
casserole fills the bill because you can make it ahead and then bake it while you bond
with your guests. This recipe was made with Progresso Creamy Mushroom Soup. At
time of purchase, read the label to determine whether the soup is still gluten-free. The
crackers used for this recipe were Blue Diamond Nut Thins Country Ranch, though
most any gluten-free cracker works. Again, read the label before purchasing.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

6 large chicken thighs
18-ounce can cream of mushroom soup (not
condensed)
11⁄2 cups plus 1⁄2 cup shredded sharp cheddar
cheese
1.25-ounce package taco seasoning mix
1⁄2 cup milk
2 cups crushed crackers
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 Place the chicken thighs in an 8-x-11-inch baking dish.
3 In a medium bowl, stir together the soup, 11⁄2 cups of cheese, taco seasoning mix, and
milk. Spoon the mixture over the chicken.
4 Sprinkle with crushed crackers.
5 Cover the pan with foil and bake the casserole at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.
6 Remove the foil and sprinkle the casserole with the remaining 1⁄2 cup of cheese. Return
the dish to the oven to bake for 10 minutes more, or until the cheese has melted.

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Sauté the chicken pieces and onions in the butter in a large skillet over medium-high
heat until the chicken is browned on both sides. Transfer the chicken and onions to a
roasting pan.
3 Stir in the tomato sauce, chicken broth, white wine, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Bake
the chicken at 350 degrees for 1 hour, or until the chicken is very tender. (If the chicken
gets too brown before it’s cooked through, cover the pan with foil for the remainder of
the baking time.)
4 Boil the spaghetti in a large saucepan of boiling water until the pasta is just barely
tender, and then drain.
5 When the chicken is tender, stir the spaghetti into the chicken and sauce and return the
pan to the oven for 15 minutes, stirring the spaghetti every 5 minutes. (You may need to
add a little water to the sauce.)
6 Remove the casserole from the oven and sprinkle the top with cheese.

Grecian Chicken with Pasta
You have choices: Are you going to use rice pasta? Corn pasta? Lentil pasta? Each of
these pastas requires a slightly different length of cooking time, so follow the package
directions for cooking. That being said, for this recipe, don’t cook the spaghetti as long
as the package directs because the pasta is also baked after it’s boiled. The gluten-free
pastas tend to get mushy when overcooked.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
Yield: 5 servings
3 tablespoons butter
3 1⁄2-pound chicken, cut into serving pieces
1 onion, chopped
Two 8-ounce cans tomato sauce
2 cups chicken broth
1⁄4 cup white wine
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound spaghetti (or other pasta)
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Chicken Pot Pie
This dish is as Americana as it gets. Almost anything in the vegetable bin in your refrigera-
tor that may be showing signs of age can be chopped up and added to this — asparagus,
mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, tossed salad (Aha! Just kid-
ding about the tossed salad!). You can add the rest of that half-used jar of chopped
pimento or roasted red peppers, too.
Tools: Rolling pin
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Pot Pie Pie Crust (see the following recipe)
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup diced carrots
1⁄2 cup diced celery
4 small red potatoes, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1⁄2 cup frozen peas, thawed
3 cups cooked, cubed chicken
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup cornstarch
1 cup plus 1 cup chicken broth
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons water
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2 Make the Pot Pie Pie Crust.
3 Roll out half of the dough and place it in a 9-inch pie plate that has been sprayed with
cooking spray.
4 Boil the carrots, celery, potatoes, and onions in water in a medium saucepan until
they’re tender. Drain.
5 In a large bowl, stir together the boiled vegetables, peas, chicken, salt, and pepper.
6 Place the cornstarch in a medium saucepan and add 1 cup of broth; whisk until the mix-
ture is smooth. Put the pan on the stove over medium heat.
7 Stir in the remaining chicken broth and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture has
thickened. Remove from the heat.
8 Pour the gravy over the chicken and vegetables in the bowl and mix until the gravy is
evenly distributed.

9 Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined pie plate.
10 Roll out the remaining dough and place it on top of the pie. Seal the edges and flute (see
the Tip paragraph at the end of the recipe for the how-to).
11 In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush on the pie crust.
12 Bake the pot pie at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, or until the crust is baked through.
Tip: To flute the pie crust, tuck the edges of the top crust under the edges of the bottom
crust to assure a firm seal so the filling won’t escape during baking.

Slow Cooker Chicken with 
Spinach and Mushrooms
If you work outside the home, or if you opt to take the kids swimming all day instead of
staying at home to cook in a hot kitchen, then this is the meal for you. In the morning,
dump everything into a slow cooker, put on the lid, and then go enjoy your day. This
meal is excellent served over rice or gluten-free noodles.

f you’re a vegetarian or cooking for one, you
can skip this chapter and head to Chapter 14.
But for those meat-and-potatoes people, or even
those who love a healthy, veggie-filled lifestyle but
enjoy the protein-packed punch of a tasty lean
meat, read on.
The recipes in this chapter delve into the delights of
beef, pork, and lamb. Sorry, but there are no recipes
for buffalo, venison, antelope, wild turkey, or alli-
gator, but being the fan I am of interesting foods,
I’d suggest finding a recipe for your favorite off-beat
meat and modifying it to be gluten-free if you’re 
up for the challenge. If you need help modifying
recipes, take a look at Chapter 7 for some point-
ers. And if you’re looking for seafood and chicken
recipes, see Chapters 11 and 12, respectively.
Gluten-Free . . . If You’re Game
Yes, meat is gluten-free . . . initially. If you buy roasts, chops, or any other
whole piece of meat, there’s nothing to be concerned about from a gluten
standpoint. If, however, you pick up a package of marinated beef kabobs or
preseasoned pork tenderloin, you’ll need to check what ingredients have
been used in the marinade and seasonings.
When you buy meat from the deli department, be careful. Most of the pre-
mium meats sold there are solid meat, but some of the less expensive brands
may use extenders. Extenders are inexpensive fillers and binders that can

include wheat; they can enhance the flavor of processed meats, but they’re
primarily added to expand and extend the product. These fillers must be
listed on the label, and manufacturers must list wheat on the label — so if
you’re reading carefully, you’ll find it.
And then there’s the enigma surrounding ground meats. If you pick up a pack-
age that says “ground beef,” wouldn’t you assume it was just beef that was
ground up? Well, that may not necessarily be so. Some (granted, not many)
meat processors add fillers that contain wheat products to their ground meats.
Again, the ingredients in the fillers must be listed on the package ingredient
label, but you still have to read the label to make sure it’s safe for you to eat.
The Main Attractions: 
Beef, Pork, and Lamb
Three grades of beef are sold in grocery stores: prime, choice, and select.
 Prime is juicier and more tender than the other two grades because it
has the most marbling (a fancy word for “fat specks”).
 Choice beef is moderately marbled and generally slightly more “mature”
than prime beef. It’s the most popular grade purchased because it isn’t
as expensive as prime and it’s more tender than select.
 Select is the leanest, so ultimately it’s the healthiest, but because it has the
least amount of marbling, it’s usually tougher, less juicy, and less flavorful.
Let’s see now . . . On one hand you have tender, juicy, flavorful; on the other
hand you have healthier. And then you have the beef that’s in the middle of
the road. It’s really a matter of preference.
Pork today is 35 percent to 50 percent leaner than it was just 30 years ago.
Unfortunately, pork dries out when it’s overcooked, primarily because of the
lower fat content. You can avoid overcooking pork by paying close attention
to the internal temperature with an accurate instant-read thermometer. Pork
is cooked through when the thermometer registers 160 degrees. Always let the
meat rest (that’s a fancy word for letting it sit for a few minutes after it’s cooked)
before serving or carving so the juices can be reabsorbed into the center.
If you aren’t partial to the taste of lamb, chances are you tasted mutton. Meat
from older sheep is called mutton, and most people think it tastes disgusting,
whereas the taste of spring lamb is succulent, delicious, and moist. When
buying leg of lamb, you may find it challenging to figure out how much you
need because of the bone. You’re safe if you buy 1 pound for every two
people to be served.

3 In the same small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, and wine. Set the mixture aside.
4 Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
5 Melt the butter in the skillet, and then add the steaks. Cook for 1 minute on each side to
brown.
6 Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 minutes.
7 Turn the steaks. Pour the soy mixture over the meat and continue to cook for 3 to 4
more minutes (depending on the thickness of the steaks and the desired doneness).
8 Spoon 1 tablespoon of the blue cheese on top of each steak. Cover the pan with a lid to
seal in the steam until the cheese begins to melt.

Glazed Fillet Mignon 
with Blue Cheese
If you can take a second mortgage out on your home to afford the fillets, this definitely
is the entrée to select when you want to totally impress someone. It takes almost no
time to prepare, looks gorgeous, and tastes divine. To complete the ambiance and plate
presentation, serve the steak on a bed of fresh or sautéed watercress. This recipe calls
for blue cheese. Some blue cheese, like Gorgonzola, is made from mold grown on wheat
bread, but many brands of blue cheese are now made synthetically and contain no
wheat mold. Shropshire, Frigo, and Kraft are just three of the gluten-free blue cheeses
on the market, but still check the ingredient label every time you purchase the cheese
to be sure the product is still gluten-free.

heat and let it stand for 10 minutes.
Asian Chop Suey
Chop suey is a dish that traditionally consists primarily of vegetables, but may also
include meat, poultry, or seafood. Here, it’s served with sticky rice, which is actually a
type of rice, not necessarily the method of cooking. Sticky rice is short-grain rice that is
glutinous and sticky when cooked. (Glutinous doesn’t refer to the gluten found in wheat,
rye, or barley and, when derived from rice, is permissible on a gluten-free diet.)
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours (or overnight) to marinate meat
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

6 In a wok or a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Remove the meat from
the marinade and stir-fry it over high heat until it’s browned on the outside. (Cook for
about 1 minute for medium rare. Don’t overcook the meat or it will become tough.)
Remove the meat to a plate.
7 Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the same skillet or wok. Add the onions, mush-
rooms, celery, broccoli, and carrots. Stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute.
8 Add the corn, bamboo shoots, snow peas, and the remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Continue
to stir-fry for 1 minute more. Add the reserved marinade and cook for 2 minutes.
9 Stir in the meat and heat 30 seconds or until the meat is warmed.
10 Place the cornstarch in a small bowl. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth until the mix-
ture is smooth.
11 Pour the cornstarch mixture over the meat and vegetables and stir constantly over medium
heat until the sauce thickens and the ingredients are evenly coated (about 12 seconds).

The pros of eating plenty of protein
Do you ever wonder what all the hype is about
protein? Well for one thing, cells are made up
mostly of protein. For another, protein helps 
the body resist disease. And we know that
every adult needs a minimum of 9 grams of 
protein for every 9 pounds of body weight to
keep from slowly breaking down our tissues.
And then there’s the fact that protein helps
maintain our energy levels throughout the day.
Okay, so maybe protein is good for us.
Beef, pork, chicken, fish, beans, and other high-
protein foods can help you feel full for a longer
period of time, and the body uses up more
energy to digest these proteins (that’s good).
But just because protein is good for us, doesn’t
mean you should eat unlimited amounts. Too
much protein can weaken our bones and can
sometimes be tough on the kidneys (that’s bad).

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Place the steak cubes in a 9-x-9-inch baking pan. Add 1⁄8 teaspoon of salt, 1⁄4 teaspoon of
pepper, the chopped parsley, onions, soy sauce, water, beef broth, Italian salad dress-
ing, and garlic. Cover the pan securely with heavy-duty foil.
3 Roast the steak at 350 degrees for 3 hours.
4 Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms, 1⁄8 teaspoon of salt, 1⁄8 teaspoon of
pepper, and the minced parsley and sauté on high heat, stirring often, until the mush-
rooms are browned and glazed.
5 To serve, spoon the beef onto a plate, and then spoon the mushrooms on top.
Tip: You can also prepare this meat in a slow cooker — just be sure to reduce the water 
to 1⁄4 cup.

Beef Pot Roast a la Mushrooms
The directions for this recipe tell you to cut the meat into cubes. If you prefer to leave
the roast whole, add a half hour to the roasting time. Let the whole roast cool, and then
cut it into thin slices. (This makes the best cold sandwich!) The beef is excellent served
over gluten-free noodles.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 3 hours
Yield: 4 servings
2 pounds lean chuck steak, cut into 1-inch
cubes
1⁄8 teaspoon plus 1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 green onions, sliced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup water
14.5-ounce can beef broth
2 tablespoons Italian salad dressing
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
16 ounces fresh mushroom slices
1 tablespoon minced parsley

Glazed Corned Beef
Never have you eaten corned beef like this. The mustard and dark corn syrup combine
to create a phenomenal taste that infiltrates every pore of the meat. You’ll definitely
want to make extra so you’ll have leftovers for corned beef sandwiches the next day.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours, 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
203
Chapter 13: Meat Matters
2 1⁄2-pound lean corned beef brisket
2 onions, peeled and quartered
2 bay leaves
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 clove garlic, quartered
3 whole cloves
1⁄2 cup dark corn syrup
1 tablespoon brown mustard
1 Put the corned beef brisket in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover.
2 Add the onion, bay leaves, pepper, garlic, and cloves.
3 Bring to a boil; reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours and 45 minutes, or until
the meat is very tender.
4 In a small saucepan, stir together the corn syrup and mustard. Bring to a boil; reduce
the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the glaze cool.
5 Preheat the broiler.
6 Remove the brisket from the water and discard the water and vegetables.
7 Trim the excess fat from the beef place it in a broiler pan.
8 Spoon the glaze over the top of the meat.
9 Broil the brisket for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the meat is heated through. Watch the meat
closely and remove it from the broiler as soon as it’s glazed.
Tip: If you want to save time at dinnertime, you can simmer the corned beef ahead of time,
and then slice it and set it in a broiler pan that is lined with foil. Shape the foil closely
around the meat slices to keep the slices as close as possible and shaped in a loaf. Just
before serving, spoon the glaze over the meat and broil until the meat has warmed and is
glazed.

Pork Chops with Caramelized Onions
It’s amazing what adding a speck of brown sugar to sliced onions in a skillet will do to
transform these vegetable slivers into delicacies. The caramelized onions give pork
chops an entirely new depth of taste. You definitely want to watch the cooking time
closely with these pork chops so they remain moist and tender.
Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus 2 hours to marinate meat
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Baked Pork Chops
At the beginning of this section I state that if you overcook pork chops, they become
tough. This dish is the exception. The longer you bake this dish, the more tender the
meat becomes, until it gets so tender that it falls off the bone.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours
Yield: 4 servings
Four 3⁄4-inch thick bone-in pork chops
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
8-ounce can tomato sauce
1 cup water
1⁄2 cup chopped celery
1⁄2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Sprinkle both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, brown the
chops in oil over medium-high heat.
3 After the chops are browned, place them in a shallow baking dish.
4 In a small bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, water, celery, onion, brown sugar, and
mustard; pour the mixture over the chops.
5 Cover the pan with foil and bake the chops at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Then uncover
them and continue baking for 45 minutes more, or until the chops are so tender that
they almost fall apart.
Tip: When you serve the pork chops, you should have some sauce in the pan to spoon over
the chops. If, during cooking, you see that the sauce is drying out and being absorbed too
much, you may need to add a little water. Don’t add more than 1 cup of water at a time. If
you are baking in a glass dish, make sure the water being added is very hot because
adding cold water can cause the dish to break.

Best Spare Ribs You’ll Ever Eat!
The “best spare ribs you’ll ever eat” isn’t a guess or a boast — it’s a fact! These are
finger-licking, can’t-get-enough, memory-making spare ribs.
Tools: Dutch oven
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
206
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
5 cups water
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules

2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1⁄8 teaspoon cloves
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 pounds baby back ribs (2 slabs)
1 Early in the day (or the day before), put the sugar and vinegar in a large Dutch oven.
Reduce over medium heat about 8 minutes until the vinegar and sugar form a syrup.
(Watch carefully because the syrup will suddenly darken in color.)
2 Immediately add the water and bouillon granules. Stir in the molasses, ketchup, dry mus-
tard, Worcestershire sauce, cloves, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Bring it to a boil.
3 Cut each slab of ribs into smaller sections. Add them to the saucepan and simmer for 
20 minutes.
4 Remove the pan from the heat. Remove the ribs and place them in a dish. Cover and
refrigerate.
5 Cook the liquid over medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy (about 25 min-
utes), stirring constantly during the last 5 minutes.
6 Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce into a bowl. (Yield will be about 1
cup of basting sauce.) Cool the sauce, then cover and refrigerate it.
7 Before dinner, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
8 Place the ribs on a nonstick baking dish, with the underside facing up.
9 Baste well with the sauce and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Turn the ribs over
and baste generously. Continue to bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Lamb Chops with Tiered Topping
Get out of the mind-set that lamb chops have to be broiled. If you have always broiled
lamb chops before, you’re in for a real treat with this baked version. This relatively
easy-to-assemble entrée is impressive because people never tire of tiered.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 42 minutes

Barbecue Lamb Shanks
You’ve done the barbecue chicken and ribs bit; now it’s time to expand your horizons to
barbecue lamb. Cooking time may vary a bit depending on the size of the shanks. This
succulent meat falls off the bone. Lamb shanks frequently have to be ordered from the
meat department at your grocery store ahead of time.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours
Yield: 4 servings
4 lamb shanks, about 1⁄2 pound each
1⁄4 teaspoon paprika
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 cup ketchup
1⁄2 cup water
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1⁄2 teaspoon dry mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
2 Sprinkle the lamb shanks with paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3 In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown the shanks on all sides in
the oil. Transfer the meat to an 8-x-11-inch baking dish.
4 Stir the ketchup, water, brown sugar, onion, vinegar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce
into the skillet, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Spoon this mix-
ture on top of the lamb shanks and cover the baking dish with foil.
5 Bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

Mixing Up Meals with Ground Meats
Bad news and good news . . . Ground meats have issues that aren’t associated
with whole cuts of meats. In whole cuts, the interior of the meat is essentially
sterile; bacteria are isolated to the surface. When meat is ground, bacterial
contamination from the surface can be distributed throughout the meat.

209
Chapter 13: Meat Matters
Now the good news: Ground meat is now irradiated (zapped with rays), which
kills the bacteria. And if you cook the meat properly as described in the fol-
lowing recipes, you won’t have anything to worry about.
When buying ground meats, ask the butcher if the meat has had fillers added.
Some stores add wheat-based fillers to ground hamburger. Sausage is always
questionable, so read the label ingredients carefully.
Meatballs in Wine Sauce
Put away all of your other meatballs-in-some-kind-of-sauce recipes because you won’t
need them anymore. Whether these are served with toothpicks for a cocktail party or
served over rice for dinner, the taste of these meatballs is remarkable. Use the most
porous gluten-free bread you can find for toasting. This is one recipe where you can’t
take a shortcut by substituting garlic powder for the cloves of garlic.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 slices porous bread, toasted
1 pound lean ground beef
1 egg
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
3 ounces (1⁄2 of a 6-ounce can) tomato paste
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar
1⁄2 cup red wine
11⁄2 cups water
1 Crumble the toast into a medium bowl. Add the ground beef, egg, salt, pepper, and
garlic. Mix thoroughly.
2 Form the meat mixture into small balls, and then roll into football-shaped ovals. You
should have about 24 meatballs.
3 In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the meatballs in butter, turning frequently.
4 Add the tomato paste, sugar, red wine, and water, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes,
adding more water only if needed.

BBQ Meatloaf
The easiest way to crush the crackers for this recipe is to put them in a plastic bag and
use a rolling pin. (This method makes less noise than using a hammer!) A blender is
also effective in crushing the crackers, but then you have a big blender to wash
(whereas the rolling pin stays clean). And if you have any leftover meatloaf, meatloaf
sandwiches are always a big hit!

Marinated Kielbasa
Of course, you should always read the ingredients of any package you buy, but this
holds especially true when buying sausage. Many fillers used in making sausage contain
wheat and wheat byproducts. Fortunately, many brands of gluten-free sausage are avail-
able. You can make this recipe with gluten-free kielbasa, bratwurst, or any of the plain,
hot, or flavored sausages. And just when you thought you didn’t have to make any more
choices . . .
Preparation time: 5 minutes, plus 1 hour to marinate
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 tablespoons dark corn syrup
2 teaspoons olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon powdered ginger
1 teaspoon brown mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 pound kielbasa links
1 Place the corn syrup, oil, ginger, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce in a
gallon-size self-seal bag. Swish it around to blend the ingredients.
2 Add the kielbasa to the bag. Seal the bag and push the sausage around so it’s evenly
covered with marinade.
3 Refrigerate the sausage for at least 1 hour.
4 Preheat the broiler.
5 Remove the kielbasa from the bag and place it on a broiler pan. Drizzle the marinade
over the top of the meat.

Greek Hamburger Vegetable Casserole
This casserole takes a little extra time to prepare, but every moment is worth it. This
goes so beyond eggplant parmigiana! Although this casserole is more than substantial
as an entrée, it doubles as an excellent side dish on a buffet. If you don’t tell the kids
that there’s eggplant in it, they’ll love it, too.
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 pound lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, diced
1⁄4 cup water
1⁄4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 large zucchini, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick
1 large yellow squash, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick
1 medium eggplant, peeled, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick
11⁄2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 egg
1⁄8 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄2 cup small curd cottage cheese
1⁄2 cup bread crumbs, divided
1⁄3 cup grated Romano cheese, divided
1 Preheat broiler. Spray a baking sheet and a 9-x-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2 Add the olive oil to a medium skillet and brown the beef, garlic, and onion, breaking the
meat up with a fork.
3 Add the water, wine, tomato paste, parsley, salt, pepper, oregano, and cinnamon.
Simmer it on low heat, stirring frequently, until all the liquid has been absorbed.
Remove from the heat.
4 Place zucchini, squash, and eggplant on the baking sheet. Spray the tops of the vegeta-
bles with the cooking spray. Broil the vegetables, turning once. Remove the zucchini
and squash when both sides are golden. The eggplant may not brown as much as the
squash, but it’s done baking when it’s tender.
5 In a small saucepan, stir together the milk and cornstarch. Turn on the heat to medium
and warm the milk, stirring constantly with a whisk, until the mixture has thickened.
Stir in the butter until it melts. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.

Chapter 13: Meat Matters
6 Whisk the egg in a small bowl until it’s frothy. Stir in the nutmeg and cottage cheese. Stir
this into the milk mixture.
7 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs on the
bottom of the baking dish.
8 Layer half of the broiled vegetables in the prepared dish. Spoon half of the meat mixture
over the top vegetables. Sprinkle with half of the remaining bread crumbs and half of
the Romano cheese. Repeat the layers. Smooth the cottage cheese mixture over the top.
Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs over the top.
9 Bake the dish at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, or until the topping is golden. Cool slightly
before cutting.

Making Memories with
Meatless Dishes
In This Chapter
 Side dishes for every season
 Mixing and mashing potatoes and pastas
 Making veggies the main course, of course
M
eatless dishes are perceived to be a chal-
lenge on a gluten-free diet because so many
vegetarian or vegan dishes use pasta. The good
news is that lots of really great gluten-free pastas
are available; the other good news is that veggies
are gluten-free! All of them!
So let’s talk veggies, starting with the incredible
side dishes you can make with very little effort.
Veggin’ Out with Side Dishes
Side dishes with veggies add flavor, nutrition, and
color to a dinner plate. For a festive presentation,
sprinkle the dish with minced parsley before
putting the vegetables on the plate. If you want to
get really wild and crazy, add some edible flowers,
like nasturtiums.
Cooking vegetables is somewhat of an art, and Connie and I have some help-
ful hints to help you make the best of your veggies. Here are a few suggestions
to keep in mind:
 All vegetables that grow above ground can start cooking in boiling water.
 For those that grow beneath the ground (beets, turnips, and so on), start
in cold water.

 Many vegetables can be grilled (leeks, onions, asparagus, eggplant, and
so on). Just slather them with a little olive oil and some seasonings
before grilling.
 Salted eggplant absorbs less fat than unsalted eggplant when it’s fried or
sautéed. Sprinkle the slices with salt and place them in a colander in the
sink. Let them set for 30 minutes, and then rinse the slices in cool water
and pat them dry with paper towels.
 Peeled sweet potatoes can be substituted for white potatoes in many
recipes.
 Whether you steam, grill, roast, stir-fry, or pan-fry your veggies, try to
include them in as many meals as possible.
By adding a tossed salad, some of the selections in this section can double as
a meatless entrée.

Broccoli Cauliflower Combo
The topping on this casserole is “fun” — crumbled Funyuns are used. As of the writing
of this book, Funyuns (sold in the chips aisle) are gluten-free. Should the ingredients on
the package change, you can use crushed potato chips instead.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
10-ounce box frozen cauliflower
Two 10-ounce boxes frozen broccoli
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
11⁄2 cups processed cheese
18-ounce can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup plus 1 cup crushed Funyuns
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-x-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2 Place the cauliflower and broccoli in a medium saucepan and cover the vegetables with
water.
3 Bring the water to a boil, and then simmer the vegetables for 2 minutes.
4 Drain the vegetables in a colander, and then transfer them to the prepared baking dish.
5 Sprinkle the almonds over the vegetables.
6 In a small mixing bowl, stir together the cheese, soup, and 1 cup of crushed Funyuns;
pour the mixture over the broccoli and cauliflower.

7 Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of crushed Funyuns on top of the casserole.

Glazed Carrots with Walnuts
Carrots add so much color to a plated dish, and making an impressive side dish simply
doesn’t get any easier than this. You can use pecans in place of the walnuts and pure
maple syrup in place of the brown sugar.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 cups baby carrots
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons chopped walnuts
11⁄2 tablespoons brown sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper

Spinach Pie
If you cut the slices of this pie a bit larger, this dish doubles as a meatless entrée. You
can prepare it ahead, cover and refrigerate it, and then bake it just before dinner. After
removing the dish from the oven, let it set for 10 minutes before cutting.

Stuffed Acorn Squash
The first ingredient in this recipe, 1 large acorn squash, has a qualifier after it — “halved
and seeded.” Sure, that’s easy to write down, but have you ever tried to cut an acorn
squash in half? The shell is harder than titanium! The easiest way to accomplish this
feat is to take a strong, pointed knife and first make jabs that cut through the skin
around the center of the vegetable. Then take a butcher knife and press down along the
“jabbed” line . . . and good luck! This dish makes a beautiful presentation.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 2 servings

Cranberries and Yams
Did you know that yams and sweet potatoes are not related botanically? Yams are the
starchier, but softer, of the two. In the United States, we just think we are buying yams.
They are labeled “yams,” and they may look darker than sweet potatoes, but they are
merely a different variety of sweet potato, one with a softer center than those labeled
“sweet potatoes.”
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
222
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
Nonstick cooking spray
2 large yams
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon cumin
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons dried cranberries
2 teaspoons butter
1 large pear, peeled, cored, and cut into 
1⁄2-inch cubes
1⁄4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1⁄4 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2 Cut each yam in half crosswise, and then into wedges.
3 In a plastic, self-seal bag, combine the cinnamon, 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt, cumin, pepper, and
garlic powder.
4 Add the yams. Seal the bag and shake it until the yams are evenly coated.
5 Lay the yam wedges in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
6 Bake the yams at 450 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the wedges are very tender,
turning the yams once during baking.
7 While the yams bake, place the cranberries in a bowl of hot water to soak and soften for
5 minutes. Drain.
8 Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet.
9 Add the pears and pecans and sauté them over medium heat until the pears are tender
and golden, about 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
10 Stir in the cranberries, ginger, brown sugar, vinegar and remaining 1⁄8 teaspoon of salt,
and heat until the sauce is warmed.
11 To serve, spoon the cranberry sauce over the yams.

Carrot and Zucchini Latkes
The only thing that these latkes are missing is a dollop of sour cream on top. Enjoy
them as a side dish, or serve several as a main entrée. The gluten-free bread crumbs in
the recipe are readily available at most health food stores. The bread crumbs will stay
fresher longer if you keep the unused portion in the freezer.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 latkes
1⁄2 pound carrots
1 medium zucchini
1 small onion
1 egg
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1 tablespoon grated Romano cheese
1⁄4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 Grate the carrots, zucchini, and onion using the large holes of a box grater.
2 Place the vegetables in the center of several thicknesses of paper toweling. Bring up the
ends of the toweling and twist them together to form a pouch. Holding the pouch over
the sink, squeeze out the excess moisture from the vegetables.
3 Place the vegetables in a medium bowl. Add the egg, cornstarch, salt, pepper, dill,
Romano cheese, and bread crumbs, and mix well.
4 Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
5 For each latke, spoon 1 large spoonful of the mixture carefully into the pan. Immediately
use the side and back of the spoon to form the mixture into a flat round. Cook about 4
minutes per side, or until browned.
6 Remove the latke from the skillet; drain on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining
mixture.

Packing Some Punch with 
Pastas and Starches
While veggies may be good for us, let’s face it — nothing beats a great bowl of
pasta or a side of potatoes. We’re talking good, stick-to-your-ribs foods here.
The gluten-free pastas taste every bit as good as traditional wheat pasta if
you take a little care with the preparation. When boiling gluten-free pasta,

add a little oil to the pot of water. Oil helps prevent the pasta from sticking
together. Also add some salt. Salt raises the temperature of the boiling water,
enabling the pasta to cook more quickly without falling apart.
The alternative flour pastas and macaronis become gooey and mushy if you
overcook them. As soon as they’re al dente (a fancy word for “just about
tender”), remove the pan from the stove, drain off the water, and then rinse
the pasta under cold running water (unless a recipe directs otherwise).
To serve the pasta with a sauce, add some sauce to the pot you used to cook
the pasta and bring it to a boil. Add the rinsed and drained pasta, and then
heat, stirring occasionally, just until the strands are hot, and serve immedi-
ately. If you’re going to use the pasta in a casserole that will be baked, you
don’t need to reheat the pasta after you drain it.
The variety of alternative pastas available is increasing almost daily. Corn
and rice are still the mainstays. Corn pasta is a bit coarser and grainier,
takes a little longer to cook, and has a more distinctive taste. It also holds
together better. Rice pasta has no distinctive taste, so it absorbs the sauce’s
flavor. It cooks more quickly than the corn-based products, so you need to
pay close attention when it nears al dente. If it’s overcooked, it can fall
apart — but cooked al dente, it’s fabulous.
Although rice and corn are the most common alternative pastas on the gro-
cery shelves, you can also buy gluten-free pasta that’s made from the follow-
ing flours:
 White sweet potato
 Milo
 Water chestnut
 Arrowroot
 Yam
 Lotus
 Cassava
 Quinoa
 Amaranth
 Buckwheat
 Lentil
After corn and rice pasta, lentil definitely weighs in as the next most popular.
It’s darker in color, but the taste is very good and it resists the mushy factor.
Quinoa pasta is pretty widely available these days, too, and is loaded with
nutrition! (See Chapter 3 for the lowdown on most of these flours.)
225
Chapter 14: Making Memories with Meatless Dishes

Buckwheat pasta often has wheat flour added to it. Don’t assume the buck-
wheat pasta is pure buckwheat. Be sure to read the label!

The Ultimate Macaroni and Cheese
This macaroni and cheese is the most delicious version you’ll ever have the pleasure of
consuming. The culinary gratification borders on the euphoric. You can assemble this
dish ahead and freeze it (thaw it before baking), or you can cover and refrigerate it until
shortly before dinner. Served with a side salad, it can double as an entrée.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 9 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
8-ounce box rice penne pasta
2 cups milk
1⁄2 cup whipping cream
4 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
3⁄4 cup shredded Romano cheese, divided
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-x-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2 In a medium saucepan, cook the pasta as the package directs, boiling only for 6 min-
utes. Rinse and drain the pasta.
3 In the same saucepan, stir together the milk and whipping cream. Remove a 1⁄2 cup of
the milk mixture and set it aside.
4 Bring the remaining milk mixture to a simmer and add the drained pasta.
5 Cook the milk and pasta over medium heat, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes, or
until the mixture thickens and most of the milk is absorbed.
6 Add the butter and salt and stir until the butter melts.
7 In the prepared baking dish, layer half the macaroni, and then half of the cheese. Repeat
the layers.
8 Pour the reserved milk over the top of the pasta.
9 Bake the pasta at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until the top begins to brown around
the edges. Let the dish cool for 10 minutes before slicing.

Spaghetti Marinara
No two people in the world make their marinara sauce quite the same way. This sauce
is thick and will stick to the pasta. Many tomato-based dishes taste better the next day,
and this marinara sauce is no exception. If you have the time, make the sauce the day
before, and cover and refrigerate the pan to allow the flavors to blend before reheating
and spooning it onto your pasta.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Twice-Baked Sweet Potatoes
Is it really worth all the effort to bake, then scoop, then mash, then stuff, then top, then
rebake sweet potatoes? Yes, yes, and yes again! Deep inside of you, you know this is the
perfect side dish for autumn, but you’ll have the urge to make it all year long.
Tools: Electric mixer
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 90 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 Put the halves of the potatoes together to form a whole potato, and wrap each potato in
foil.
3 Bake the potatoes at 375 degrees for about 1 hour until they’re tender but not mushy.
4 Cool the potatoes slightly, and then scoop out the centers, leaving enough potato to
hold the shape of the skin. Place the scooped-out centers in a large mixing bowl.
5 Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees. Spray an 8-x-11-inch baking dish with cook-
ing spray.
6 Using a mixer, whip the potato pulp until it’s smooth. Add the milk, maple syrup, vanilla,
salt, and egg, and continue to whip until the pulp is light and fluffy.
7 Spoon the filling into the potato shells, dividing evenly.
8 Place the shells in the prepared baking dish.
9 In a small bowl, use a fork to blend together the flour mixture and brown sugar. Add 
the butter and continue to blend with the fork until the dry ingredients are evenly
moistened.
10 Stir in the pecans.
11 Crumble sugar mixture over the potatoes. Bake the potatoes at 325 degrees for 
30 minutes.
Tip: Sweet potatoes have a relatively low glycemic index (see Chapter 4 for more on that),
making them far healthier for you than white potatoes.

Mashed Potatoes with 
Caramelized Onions
The caramelized onions and cheese give this creation a unique flavor that dictates you
have a second helping (and sometimes a third)!
Tools: Ricer or electric mixer
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
230
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup sliced onions
1⁄2 teaspoon brown sugar
4 large Idaho potatoes
1⁄4 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
3⁄4 cup milk
2⁄3 cup shredded white sharp cheddar cheese
1 In a large skillet, heat the oil. Stir in the onions and brown sugar, and cook over medium
heat for about 10 minutes, or until the onions are browned and glazed, stirring frequently.
2 Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato in half crosswise, and then cut each half into 
quarters.
3 Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a
boil and boil for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain.
4 Place small batches of potatoes in a ricer and rice the potatoes into a mixing bowl. If
you don’t have a ricer, place the potatoes in the mixing bowl and whip the potatoes
smooth with the mixer. Add the butter, salt, and pepper, and blend well.
5 Add the milk to the potatoes and whip until they’re light and fluffy.
6 Whip in the onions and cheese just until they’re evenly distributed and blended.
7 Either serve the potatoes immediately or transfer the mixture to a casserole dish that
has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, cover, and refrigerate. To reheat the
potatoes, bake the covered casserole at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.
Vary It! If you want even richer potatoes, use half-and-half in place of the milk.

Serving Vegetable Dishes 
as the Main Attraction
Anyone who is vegan or vegetarian has already discovered some of the fasci-
nating and delectable things that can be done with vegetables. A meat-and-
potatoes person may need a little more convincing that it’s possible to fill 
an empty stomach and enjoy the meal with no meat present. This section
includes a few entrees that will convince anyone that meat isn’t needed to
satisfy the tummy at mealtime.
If you’re innovative, select a vegetable large enough to stuff. Hollow it out,
chop up the center, and sauté with onions and green pepper. Add “some-
thing” (rice, pasta, and/or veggies) to the onions and peppers, restuff the veg-
etable, and top it off with gluten-free bread crumbs, shredded cheese, or a
sauce, and then bake. Each time you opt to do this, select a different veggie
for the shell, a different filling, and a different topping.
Gluten-free lasagna noodles are another source for creativity. Parboil (par-
tially cook by boiling) the noodles slightly, and then drain. (If the noodles are
fully cooked, they’ll fall apart when you assemble the casserole.) Don’t rinse
the noodles because they need to keep the starch intact for a cohesive fin-
ished product. If you use enough sauce in the casserole, you don’t even need
to parboil. Simply lay the noodles in a pan, top with a filling of your choice,
repeat the layers, spread with a sauce, and bake.

Quinoa-Stuffed Tomatoes
If you’re wondering what in the heck quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) is, it’s a gluten-free
grain that’s jam-packed with nutrients. The small, beaded form is used in this recipe; it’s
also an excellent substitute for couscous and for use in tabbouleh (a Middle Eastern
salad). For this recipe, the tomatoes, once baked, need to be firm enough to hold their
shape, yet soft enough to cut easily with a fork. Select large, ripe (but not too soft)
tomatoes. You don’t use the tomato pulp in this recipe, so place the pulp in a self-seal
bag to use in a stew or pasta sauce another day.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
4 large tomatoes
1 cup water
2 teaspoons butter
2 teaspoons olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 green onions, minced
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon dried thyme
1⁄4 teaspoon dried mint
2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
14-ounce can chicken broth
1⁄2 cup uncooked quinoa
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
10-ounce box frozen chopped spinach,
thawed and drained well
3 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Cut 1⁄2 inch off the stem side of each tomato and discard the lid. Hollow out the insides.
3 Place the tomato shells in a 9-x-9-inch baking dish, cut side down.
4 Pour the water around the tomatoes, cover the dish with foil, and bake the tomatoes at
350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes until the skins are slightly softened but firm enough to
hold their shape. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and drain off the hot water.

5 In a large nonstick saucepan, sauté the garlic and onions in the butter and oil over
medium-high heat until the onion is tender, stirring frequently.
6 Stir in the salt, pepper, dill, thyme, mint, and parsley.
7 Add the chicken broth and bring it to a boil.
8 Lower the heat to medium-low, stir in the quinoa, cover the pan, and simmer the broth
slowly for 20 minutes, or until the broth has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender.
9 With a fork, stir in the lemon juice and spinach until everything is well combined. Stir in
the feta cheese.
10 Stuff the tomatoes with the quinoa mixture. Cover the pan with foil.
11 Bake the stuffed tomatoes at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

Spinach Lasagna
Very little in life provides the satisfaction of consuming an Italian dinner, and this one
ranks high on the list in the satisfaction department. This entrée is guaranteed to pro-
vide you with genuine gastronomical gratification. Serve it with a tossed salad, and your
dinner is complete. Take care not to overcook the noodles when parboiling them.
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
234
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
1⁄2 cup hot water
1 chicken bouillon cube
8-ounce box lasagna noodles
1 medium onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 1⁄2 cups spaghetti sauce
3⁄4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
11⁄2 cups gluten-free small curd cottage
cheese
1⁄2 cup plain yogurt
1⁄4 cup grated Romano cheese
10-ounce box frozen chopped spinach,
thawed and squeezed dry
11⁄2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, stir together the hot water and bouillon cube until the cube dissolves.
3 In a medium saucepan over medium heat, sauté the onion and garlic in oil until tender,
stirring frequently.
4 Stir in the broth (bouillon cube and water), spaghetti sauce, Italian seasoning, and
pepper; simmer slowly for 15 minutes.
5 In a medium bowl, stir together the cottage cheese, yogurt, Romano cheese, and
spinach.
6 In a medium saucepan, boil the noodles according to the package directions, boiling
only for 10 minutes. Drain the water and rinse the noodles very quickly with cold water
so they’re cool enough to handle (you want them to retain their starch).
7 Spread 1⁄4 of the sauce in an 8-x-11-inch baking dish. Lay 1 layer of noodles on top of the
sauce. Spread 1⁄2 of the spinach mixture over the noodles, and then 1⁄3 of the mozzarella.
Repeat the layers, ending with the sauce and mozzarella.
8 Bake the lasagna uncovered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Let the lasagna set for 10
minutes before cutting.

Cheese-Stuffed Zucchini
This dish blends the tastes from the Mediterranean to make an entrée that you can also
serve as a side dish.
Preparation time: 20 minutes

Nonstick cooking spray
2 medium zucchini, each cut in half
lengthwise
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup finely chopped green pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup finely chopped plum tomatoes
3⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon dried mint
3⁄4 cup crumbled feta cheese
4 teaspoons Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-x-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2 Carefully remove the pulp from each zucchini half, leaving a 1⁄4-inch thick shell. Chop 
the pulp.
3 Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion, green pepper, and garlic. Sauté
over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft (about 5 minutes).
4 Stir the tomatoes, zucchini pulp, oregano, parsley, salt, pepper, dill, and mint into the
onion mixture. Reduce the heat and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove from the heat; cool for 5 minutes.
5 Stir in the cheese.
6 Stuff each zucchini shell with about 1⁄2 cup of the onion mixture. Sprinkle the tops with
bread crumbs.
7 Set the zucchini “boats” in the prepared baking dish.
8 Bake the zucchini at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until the bread crumbs are lightly
browned and the shells are tender.
Vary It! Here’s a novel idea: If you grow your own zucchini, try stuffing the flowers from
the plant before the vegetable begins to develop. Pick the flowers when they are large,
wash them well, and then stuff and bake them.

Italian Stuffed Cabbage
If you’ve ever tried to peel the leaves off of a head of cabbage to make stuffed cabbage
leaves, you know it’s not quite that simple. But it’s not that hard, either. You can
retrieve the leaves from a head of cabbage in two ways. First, though, you have to peel
off and toss out the coarse outer leaves because they’ll be tough and too thick to be pli-
able enough for stuffing.
Method 1: Blanch the head of cabbage in boiling water, and then plunge it into cold
water to stop the cooking. After the head is cool, separate it into leaves. Method 2:
Freeze the head of cabbage. After it thaws, the leaves should peel off nicely.
Long-grain rice works best in these rolls. Pack the cabbage loosely, allowing room for
the rice to expand.
Preparation time: 55 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 8 servings
236
Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
1 large cabbage
1 zucchini
1 carrot
2 1⁄2 cups uncooked rice
2 medium onions, minced
1⁄2 bunch fresh parsley, minced
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 drops hot pepper sauce
3⁄4 cup water
1⁄4 cup olive oil
Two 26-ounce jars spaghetti sauce
1 Cut the core out of the cabbage.
2 Place the cabbage, core down, in a large saucepan. Add about 3 cups of water and
steam the cabbage, covered, until the outer leaves turn bright green. Remove the soft-
ened leaves, and then return the cabbage to the pot and repeat until all the cabbage
leaves have been removed.
3 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
4 Shred the zucchini and carrot into a large bowl.
5 Add the remaining ingredients except the spaghetti sauce and cabbage leaves. Stir to
mix well. Stir 1⁄2 cup of the spaghetti sauce into the rice mixture.
6 Stuff each cabbage leaf with 3 tablespoons of the rice mixture. (Use slightly more rice
mixture for the larger cabbage leaves and slightly less mixture for the small, inside cab-
bage leaves.) Fold in one side of the leaf to cover the filling, and then roll the cabbage.

7 Spread 1 cup of the spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a 9-x-13-inch baking dish.
8 Lay the cabbage rolls in the pan, seam side down.
9 Pour 21⁄2 cups of the spaghetti sauce over the top of the rolls.
10 Cover the pan with foil and bake the rolls at 350 degrees for 1 hour, adding a little water
if needed.
11 Warm the remaining 2 cups of spaghetti sauce to pour over the rolls just before serving.

Artichoke Lasagna
Garlic, fresh mushrooms, artichokes, cheese, wine, and whipping cream — these ingre-
dients combine to form a creation that will tantalize and satisfy any discerning palate.
When you’re making this dish, be very careful not to overboil the noodles; you want
them firm enough to handle. You can assemble this dish ahead of time and either refrig-
erate it or freeze it until you’re ready to bake it. (If you freeze it, thaw it before baking.)
When removing the lasagna from the oven, let it set for 5 minutes before cutting.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 9 servings
Garlic Sauce (see the following recipe)
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
9 rice lasagna noodles
1 tablespoon butter
4 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained and
minced
1⁄2 cup sherry
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
Nonstick cooking spray
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Part II: Mouthwatering Main Courses 
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and the
olive oil. Add the noodles and cook them about 8 minutes, until they’re almost tender.
Drain the water. Return the noodles to the pan and keep them submerged in cold water
until they’re needed.
3 Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and garlic and
sauté them over medium heat for about 6 minutes, stirring frequently.
4 Add the artichokes and sherry and cook the vegetables until the liquid is absorbed.
5 Stir in the remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and the pepper.
6 Spray an 81⁄2-x-61⁄2-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
7 Spoon a small amount of the Garlic Sauce on the bottom of the pan. Lay 3 noodles over
the sauce (not overlapping). Spoon 1⁄3 of the sauce over the noodles. Repeat the layers
two more times.
8 Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top.
9 Bake the lasagna at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until the top is just browning. Cool
for 5 minutes before cutting into squares.
3 cloves garlic, unpeeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sherry
1 cup whipping cream
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese

packet and bake about 30 minutes, or until the garlic is soft. Remove the garlic from the
oven.
2 When the garlic is cool, squeeze it into a small bowl (discarding the skins) and mash it
with a fork.
3 Place the mashed garlic in a small saucepan. Add the sherry, whipping cream, salt, and
pepper. Simmer the sauce slowly, stirring constantly, until the mixture has been
reduced and thickened.
4 Remove the sauce from the heat. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and nutmeg.

beyond the typical dinner. The pages are jammed with
tempting appetizers, salads, soups, snacks, and desserts.

A
ppetizers, hors d’oeuvres, starters,
antipasto, gustus, mezethes, tapas, maza,
mezze, zakuski, dim sum, smorgasbord . . . an
appetizer by any other name is still an appetizer.
It seems a little ironic that we eat to build an
appetite, but that’s the idea. Appetizers are small
servings of foods served before a meal to whet the appetite, or they can be
served alone to enable people to dawdle over small servings of different
dishes. Serving appetizers stretches out a social gathering while guests circu-
late, talk, bond, and mingle.
Choosing the Right Appetizers 
for the Occasion
Conjure up in your mind all those appetizers you’ve been offered at parties
over the years. Celery sticks with plain cream cheese. Crackers with spray
cheese. Chips and dip made from sour cream and onion soup mix. Herring in
dill sauce. Aren’t you tired of these things? Wouldn’t you rather serve some-
thing with more character and spice? Something a bit more memorable?
Bland appetizers merely fill the belly, whereas appetizers with pizzazz actu-
ally assault the senses and get guests craving more.
Be creative in your food choice. Balance hot and cold dishes, rich and mild
foods, and try to include at least one vegetarian offering. Assortment is the key.
Pick foods that are party-friendly — people will most likely be walking around,
so you don’t want to serve foods that are too sticky, messy, or greasy. Better
choices are items that people can pick up easily and eat with two fingers.

Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:
 Consider serving something where people can participate, like assem-
bling their own mini-tacos on corn tortillas or in corn taco shells and
adding their own toppings, fillings, or condiments.
 Rice papers (available at Asian markets), when soaked in water for 2 min-
utes, become very pliable and make the perfect wrapper for appetizers.
You can use these wrappers to make mini-Reuben wraps with pastrami
and Swiss cheese and a dab of gluten-free brown mustard (to be served
hot or cold). Or spread the rice papers with cream cheese, and then top
with gluten-free chunky salsa, shredded lettuce, crisp-cooked bacon, and
some guacamole. Roll these up and you have one delicious appetizer.
 A great assemble-ahead appetizer is Eggplant Pizza. Brown slices of egg-
plant in your broiler, top with a small amount of gluten-free spaghetti
sauce, sprinkle with Italian seasoning, and then top off with a slice of
provolone cheese. Pop it in the microwave to melt the cheese, and it’s
ready to serve.
 In the summertime, make use of your grill. Early in the day, assemble
mini-kabobs (shrimp, chicken, beef, veggies), or wrap mushrooms in
bacon and brush them with gluten-free barbecue sauce. Let your friends
grill their own appetizers.
To add some sanity to the day of the party, choose appetizers that you can
make ahead and store in the refrigerator or freezer until it’s time to serve them.
If guests are coming for dinner, choose lighter appetizers so people don’t fill
up on them, but prepare enough so that your guests stay busy munching and
meandering in the living room or family room (so they’ll stay out of your
kitchen and let you work at plating the dinner). Plan on about four appetizers
per person. If you’re offering two appetizers, that would average two of each
selection per person. If you’re only serving appetizers, then you’d better make
a bit larger quantity of each. Figure on eight to nine pieces per guest.
If you’re hosting a party, chances are that most of your guests aren’t on a
gluten-free diet. But hey, it’s your party! Stop making “their appetizers” and
“your appetizers.” Make gluten-free appetizers that everyone can enjoy!
Taking a Dip with Cold Appetizers
If you’re planning an event that will last an entire afternoon or evening, keep
in mind that some foods shouldn’t remain at room temperature for longer
than two hours at the most. When serving foods that need refrigeration (dips,
deviled eggs, meats or seafood, anything with mayonnaise), put out partial
amounts and refill the platter from the refrigerated stash.
In the case of cold dips, an easy way to keep them cool longer is to set the dip
bowl into a slightly larger bowl that has been filled with ice. Or think outside
242
Part III: Dishes to Enjoy Before, After, or Any Time 

the bowl. Spoon the dip into a hollowed-out small head of cabbage, squash,
or large green or red pepper, and then set this into the bowl with ice.
Although you can’t gauge exactly how much chips and dip your friends will
consume, a pretty good approximation is to have 1⁄4 cup of chip dip per
person when other snacks are also served.

Shrimp Deviled Eggs
Everyone seems to love deviled eggs, and this recipe is an exceptional treat. You proba-
bly have your own recipe for hard-boiled eggs, and if you want to use it, that’s fine. But
if you’ve never boiled eggs before, I include a process that works every time.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 11 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 eggs
1 teaspoon plus dash of salt
8 large cocktail shrimp, cooked and deveined
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1⁄4 teaspoon mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄4 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
Paprika
1 Place the eggs in a single layer in a medium saucepan with enough cold water to cover
them. Add a teaspoon of salt to the pan to help prevent the eggshells from cracking.
Bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water starts to boil, let the eggs
cook for exactly 11 minutes, and then remove the pan from the heat. Set the pan in the
sink and run cold water over the eggs to stop them from further cooking.
2 Dice the shrimp and set them aside.
3 Peel the eggs and cut them in half lengthwise. Carefully remove the yolks and place
them in a medium bowl. Set the egg whites aside.
4 Mash the yolks with the back of a fork. Add the mayonnaise, mustard, dill, lemon juice,
pepper, and a dash of salt and stir until the mixture is smooth.
5 Stir in the shrimp until it’s evenly distributed.
6 With a small spoon, refill the egg white halves, mounding the yolk mixture on top.
7 Sprinkle the tops lightly with paprika, cover, and refrigerate until serving time.

T Feta Supreme Spread
Make this spread ahead so it has plenty of time for the flavors to blend. Slather it on
gluten-free pita wedges or gluten-free crackers to make an easy appetizer. You can also
use it as a sandwich spread or sprinkled over a Greek salad.

Roulade Canapé
Although this concoction makes a great lunch, the directions below call for slicing the
roulades (rolled slices of meat stuffed with filling) to convert them to canapés (another
fancy word for appetizer). This may be one of the simplest recipes you’ll ever make; it’s
also one of the most impressive to look at.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Refrigeration time: 2 hours
Cooking time: None
Yield: 24 pieces
245
Chapter 15: Appetizing Appetizers
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup baby spinach leaves, rinsed
2 whole roasted red peppers, each cut in half
4 slices deli ham
4 slices deli turkey
1 Cut the ham and turkey slices the same sizes (approximately the size of a slice of
bread).
2 Spread cream cheese on each of the ham slices, dividing evenly.
3 Place 1 slice of turkey on top of each ham slice.
4 Spread the spinach leaves on top of the turkey slices, and then place a red pepper half
at one end of each slice.
5 Starting at the narrow end of the meat, roll each into a roulade.
6 Wrap each individual roulade tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 or more hours.
7 To serve, remove the plastic wrap and cut each roulade into 6 rounds with a serrated
knife. Place the pieces, cut side up, on a platter.

T Tortilla Sticks
These sticks are perfect for snacking, but they’re also the perfect accompaniment for
soups or a pasta dinner. They’re even great eaten hot from the oven. Beware . . . you
can’t eat just one! These are also tasty when sprinkled with sesame seeds before baking.

T Hot Taco Bake
When you think of “taco bake,” is soufflé the first thing that pops into your mind? If not,
start making that connection. Whether you serve this with gluten-free crackers or tor-
tilla chips or lots of assorted veggies, this creamy concoction is sure to be a hit with
your friends. Spread any leftover dip on gluten-free corn tortillas and warm them in the
microwave or oven for lunch or a quick snack.
Preparation time: 5 minutes

Baked Potato Skins
You’ve had potato skins before, but not like these! Make plenty of extras because no one
can stop after eating just one! When scooping out the potato center, don’t go all the way
to the skin. Leave an inner lining of potato so it can hold its shape. You won’t need the
pulp, so spoon the scooped-out centers into a self-seal bag to make potato pancakes at
another time.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
249
Chapter 15: Appetizing Appetizers
6 medium russet potatoes
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
4 ounces crumbled blue cheese
3 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled
3 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2 Rinse each potato and then cut it in half. Put the two halves back together and wrap the
potato in foil. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Put them on the oven rack and bake
for 45 minutes. Let the potatoes cool for 15 minutes. (Note: Leave the oven on because
you’ll put the skins back in to reheat them and melt the cheese.)
3 Remove the foil. Using a small spoon, scoop out the centers of each potato half.
4 In a small skillet, melt the butter. Add the garlic and pepper and sauté them in the
butter over medium heat. Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of each potato half
with the butter mixture.
5 Sprinkle the blue cheese inside of each potato half and then top with the bacon crum-
bles.
6 In a small bowl, stir together the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese; sprinkle the mix-
ture on top of the bacon.
7 Place the potato skins on a baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, or until
the skins are hot and crisp.

T Artichoke Squares
Aren’t squares of any kind wonderful? They’re so convenient to serve. You can assem-
ble them ahead of time, they bake by themselves while you prepare for company, and
you usually don’t need forks to enjoy them. Although these squares are listed as an
appetizer, if you cut the pieces a little larger, they can double as a vegetable dish at
dinner. Warning: Don’t buy marinated artichokes or this dish will be too bitter.

 Fruit can be fun, too
 Slipping in some meat
A
dmittedly, this chapter has to be one of the
easiest to write. After all, most salads are nat-
urally gluten-free, aren’t they? Seriously, when was
the last time you shopped for salad-makin’s and
had to read a label — other than croutons and top-
pings, of course. “Ingredients: carrot.” Hmmm,
better look that one up to make sure it’s on the
approved list of gluten-free ingredients. Not!
Best of all, fruits and veggies — aka salad makin’s — are a great source of
nutrition. Loaded with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, they’re also a
great source of fiber and even water.
In this chapter, I show you lots of ways to jazz up a salad with fruits, veggies,
and other ingredients you may not have thought to add to the mix. I also offer
some ideas for making gluten-free salads that would otherwise be on the no-
no list and show you how to incorporate meat into your salads for a little
extra protein and flavor.
If you’re making meatloaf, stuffed peppers, sweet breads, or muffins, shred
some carrots and/or zucchini into them. They’ll add flavor and moisture, and
you’ll be getting more vitamins without much extra effort. Or you can add
chopped green pepper and onion to almost any meat, casserole, or vegetable
dish.
Fruit and Vegetable Options
Before you even begin to create a salad, you have to make choices. What kind
of lettuce will you select? Will it be iceberg (which has almost no nutritional

value), leaf lettuce, spinach, spring field greens, or something more exotic
like watercress or Bibb lettuce? A good rule of thumb to remember is that the
darker the green, the better it is for you.
When making a fruit salad, begin by placing a handful of crisp greens on a
dish, and then use your imagination. Experiment by adding the less common
fruits like pomegranate seeds, sliced dates, black raspberries, grapefruit sec-
tions, sliced persimmons, or mango cubes.
For vegetable salads, you can jazz up a salad by
 Replacing the cucumber with zucchini
 Substituting sliced roasted red peppers for the tomatoes
 Using feta cheese crumbles instead of shredded cheddar or mozzarella
cheese
 Tossing in kalamata olives in place of the ripe olives
Think of some of the alternative options offered at salad bars. Why not
borrow some of these ideas to spruce up your own salads? You can include
 Marinated asparagus tips or artichoke hearts
 Peas or snow pea pods
 Diced beets
 Teeny cubes of ham or shredded tuna
 Marinated beans (green, kidney, black, navy)
 Corn kernels
 Nuts (walnuts, pecans, cashews, almonds)
 Raw cauliflower or broccoli
 Sprouts (alfalfa or bean)
 Seeds (poppy, sesame, sunflower)
Life is full of decisions. When you have your salad assembled, what are you
going to use for dressing? For a fruit salad, whisk 1 tablespoon of jam into
gluten-free Italian dressing and drizzle it over the salad. When tossing a
veggie salad, you can choose from a wide variety of gluten-free salad dress-
ings on the market.
No dressing in the cupboard or refrigerator? Not to worry. One of the best
salad dressings is still a blend of olive oil and vinegar with seasonings.

Combining Greens with Meats
Unadorned, lettuce is just a side dish that periodically appears near your
plate at lunch or dinner. Even though additional ingredients can be added to
the lettuce, some people still relegate salads to summer buffets and lunches
for those on diets. It’s time to reevaluate that thinking. By adding meat and
some fiber (sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, tomatoes, raw
baby zucchini, or even flax seed), a salad suddenly becomes a hearty,
healthy, great-tasting meal in a bowl.

Asian Pork Salad
Pork and soy sauce (gluten-free, of course) are natural go-togethers. Pork tenderloin is a
very tender meat if it’s not overcooked. Because the pieces are cut so small (julienne or
matchstick pieces) in this recipe, they need very little cooking time.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

Marinated Steak Salad
To get the most flavor from this salad, write a note to yourself to marinate the steak
early in the morning or overnight so it will absorb all the essence of the seasonings.
Although this recipe is even better when the steak is grilled over an open fire, using the
broiler is a very good alternative. Gluten-free croutons have not been added to this
salad, but they make an excellent addition.

W
hoever invented soups was a genius. What
other food concoction allows you to dump
almost anything into some water, cover it, and let
it cook all by itself, and then call it a meal?
Soup is the ideal solution for gardeners. In late
summer, when you have more vegetables than you
know what to do with, when you can’t even give
away all that stuff hanging off vines and popping
up through the ground, consider chopping up that
yield and making a huge pot of soup. Soup is a cornucopia of nutrition and
tastes.
No Glutens and Swimming with Flavor
As the old-time theme song from one of the large soup companies used to say
about soup, MMMMM . . . MMMMM . . . GOOD! If you steam vegetables to
serve as a side dish, the water used to steam them (which is overflowing with
nutrients from these veggies) is poured down the drain. With soup, all the
nutrients that these natural foods exude during cooking remain in the broth,
and you just know that has to be healthy and good for you.
If soups have one drawback, it’s that for the broths to be palatable, it seems
like you have to dump in half the salt shaker. Still, you have options. The best

option is to reduce the amount of salt used and use more herbs and spices
for flavoring. Here are some tips for using herbs and spices:
 Fresh herbs are much more potent and impart more flavor than dried
ones, so less is needed. But fresh herbs vary greatly in strength and the
amount of flavor they exude.
 Dominant, strong flavors include cardamom, curry, ginger, hot peppers,
black pepper, mustard, rosemary, cloves, and sage.
 Medium flavors are found in basil, celery seed, cumin, dill, fennel, tar-
ragon, garlic, marjoram, mint, oregano, thyme, and turmeric.
 Then there are herbs that you can use by the bushelful. They add a very
mild flavor, like parsley, chives, and chervil.
 Usually 1⁄4 teaspoon of dried or powdered herbs equals 3⁄4 to 1 teaspoon
of fresh herbs that are cut or crumbled.
The recipes that follow will help you think beyond chicken noodle (albeit
gluten-free noodle) soup. I don’t mean to demean or berate chicken soup. At
the first sign of a sniffle or sneeze, chances are you reach for chicken soup
and hot tea. The medicinal effects of this soup are more than just an old
wives’ tale. Chicken soup has been prescribed for the common cold as far
back as the ancient Egyptians.
If your soup is too thin for your liking, stir in a small amount of gluten-free
instant potato flakes to thicken it up almost instantly. If it’s too greasy, lay a
few lettuce leaves on top of the broth to absorb the fat. And if you plan to
freeze the soup, hold off adding any pasta to it until you thaw and reheat it,
or the gluten-free pasta may get too soft and fall apart.
Broths and Hearty Soups
When you make rice or quinoa, using chicken broth instead of water infuses
it with wonderful flavor. Use a small amount of broth instead of butter or oil
to sauté vegetables. As for that take-home doggie bag from an Asian restau-
rant, adding a little broth is perfect for reheating a stir-fry. Instead of adding
water to casseroles and roasts, use broth. Use broth as a base for gravies and
au jus. Boil your gluten-free pasta in broth instead of water and taste what a
difference it makes. Are you boiling chicken? Or boiling potatoes for a potato
salad? Boiling them in chicken broth increases their flavor quotient. For
added flavor and moisture, replace the water with broth when making your
Thanksgiving stuffing (gluten-free, of course). Don’t forget to use broth to
baste the turkey. And the next time you make muffins, substitute chicken
broth for the milk. Don’t wrinkle up your face. Just try it!

Chapter 17: Slurpilicious Soups
Then there are the “meal-in-a-bowl” soups, the hearty soups that fill your
kitchen with cozy and tantalizing aromas as they cook. Nutritionists believe
that a hot, hearty soup satisfies hunger because it tends to be eaten slowly.
Scientists claim that hearty soups fill you up because they are usually loaded
with fiber, iron, potassium, lots of vitamins and minerals, and often are high
in protein.
Spicy Chicken Soup
This soup is many things, but boring isn’t one of them. You can adjust how hot this
soup is by increasing or decreasing the amount of chili powder and hot pepper sauce
you use. Just before serving, try stirring in 1⁄3 cup of gluten-free sour cream for variety;
this addition adds even more flavor to the soup. Make plenty because your crew will
want second helpings!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1⁄4 cup minced green pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
4-ounce can chopped green chilies, drained
15-ounce can diced tomatoes
Four 10.5-ounce cans chicken broth
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, boiled
until tender
3 ounces processed cheese
1 In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, sauté the onion, garlic, and green pepper in
oil until they’re soft, stirring frequently.
2 Stir in the drained green chilies, tomatoes with their juice, broth, salt, pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin, and hot pepper sauce. Cover the saucepan
and simmer the soup for 20 minutes.
3 Cut the chicken into 1⁄2-inch cubes. Stir them into the soup and simmer for 5 minutes.
4 Stir the cheese into the soup, stirring until it’s melted.

Hearty Chicken Broth
There was a time when you could make this broth and then freeze it in ice cube trays to
have handy to perk up rice, gravy, and so on. But alas, the ice cube tray is fast becom-
ing a relic. However, you can still freeze small portions of this broth in some of the small
plastic containers available. Leave the skin on some of the vegetables for added flavor
and to add a bit of color to the clear broth.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 11⁄2 hours
Yield: 6 servings

Part III: Dishes to Enjoy Before, After, or Any Time 
10 cups water
11⁄2 pounds chicken wings (about 6 wings)
4 thin-skinned potatoes, unpeeled, cut in
quarters
1 medium onion, quartered
8 fresh mushrooms
2 leeks, trimmed and cut into 4 sections
2 carrots, cut in large chunks
2 ribs celery, cut in thirds
2 cloves garlic, cut in half
3 sprigs fresh parsley
1⁄2 teaspoon dried dill weed
11⁄2 teaspoons salt
5 peppercorns
1 bay leaf
1 clove
1 Combine all the ingredients in a large stockpot.
2 Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 11⁄2 hours.
(When the water begins to boil, don’t skim the surface of the broth.)
3 Strain the soup into a large pot or bowl, removing all the solids. Let the broth cool.
4 Keep the broth refrigerated, covered, up to 3 days. Before reheating the broth, skim off
and discard any congealed fat that has collected on top of the broth. You can also freeze
the broth until you’re ready to use it.
Tip: After you strain the soup, pick out the potatoes, cut them up, and make a potato salad
by adding green pepper, onion, salt, pepper, oregano, olive oil, and a dash of cider vine-
gar. You can also pick out the chicken wings, sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and lemon
juice, and enjoy them either warm or cold.

Chapter 17: Slurpilicious Soups
4 teaspoons pesto sauce
1⁄2 pound lean ground beef
1⁄2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄2 cup carrots, sliced thin
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2⁄3 cup spaghetti sauce
Three 14.5-ounce cans chicken broth
1⁄4 pound spaghetti
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 Drain off the oil that has collected at the top of the pesto before measuring the pesto.
Place the pesto in a medium bowl.
2 Add the ground beef to the bowl and mix it with the pesto until the ingredients are com-
pletely blended. Roll the mixture into tiny meatballs (no wider than a nickel). Set aside.
3 In a large saucepan, sauté the meatballs, onion, garlic and carrots in the oil, over
medium-high heat, turning the meat frequently, until the vegetables are tender and the
meat is cooked through.
4 Add the parsley, salt, pepper, and spaghetti sauce; bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Lower heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and gently simmer for 15 minutes.
5 In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil. Break the spaghetti into fourths and
add it to the broth. Cook the spaghetti over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, or just
until the pasta is barely tender.
6 Add the spaghetti and broth to the meatball mixture and simmer for 3 minutes. Spoon
the soup into bowls and sprinkle with the cheese.

Lamb and Rice Soup
You’ve tried beef broth. You’ve tried chicken broth. Now try lamb broth. This isn’t your
ordinary soup! The egg-lemon sauce adds a whole new dimension to the taste sensation
in the broth. Sautéing the vegetables first brings out their full flavor. Add the hot broth
very slowly to the eggs to prevent curdling.
Tools: Electric mixer
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 13⁄4 hours
Yield: 6 servings
272
Part III: Dishes to Enjoy Before, After, or Any Time 
1 tablespoon olive oil
3⁄4 cup chopped celery
1 onion, chopped
11⁄2 pounds lamb bone-in shoulder steak
8 cups water
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 chicken bouillon cubes
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄3 cup uncooked rice
3 eggs, at room temperature
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 In a large saucepan over medium heat, sauté the celery and onion in oil slowly, stirring
often, until the vegetables are softened.
2 Add the lamb, water, parsley, and bouillon cubes.
3 Bring the liquid to a boil, and then lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and
simmer for 11⁄2 hours until the lamb is very tender.
4 Remove the lamb and cut the meat into tiny pieces. Discard the bones and any fat. Add
the lamb to the saucepan.
5 Stir in the salt, pepper, and rice. Cover the pan and simmer the soup for 15 minutes
until the rice is tender.
6 In a large mixing bowl, use the electric mixer to whip the eggs for 3 minutes. Add the
lemon juice.
7 Very gradually, drizzle the hot broth from the soup into the eggs, whipping the mixture
on high to blend. (The easiest way to add the broth to the eggs is to tip the pan slightly
so the broth comes to the top and then dip it out with a soup ladle.) When the bowl
feels warm to the touch, lower the mixer speed to medium and continue slowly adding
most of the broth from the saucepan.
8 Slowly pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the lamb, stirring constantly.
Simmer the soup on low for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Serve immediately.

Italian Beef Vegetable Soup
Nothing warms the tummy on a cold winter evening like a hot bowl of Beef Vegetable
Soup. All that’s missing are some warmed gluten-free rolls as an accompaniment. If you
plan to freeze the soup, don’t add the pasta because it may get mushy when you thaw it.

Meatless Marvels
Anyone who’s ever been on a diet undoubtedly at some point has eaten cab-
bage soup. Although cabbage is certainly a healthy vegetable, don’t neglect
the other great options of vegetable soups available to you. Scientists are
providing us with evidence that consuming a lot of vegetables and beans may
reduce our stress levels, help fight cancer and heart disease, and fight free
radicals. But aside from all this technical stuff, vegetable soups taste great!

T Cream of Mushroom Soup
Everyone on a gluten-free diet seems to be in search of a suitable substitute for con-
densed cream of mushroom soup to use in casseroles. To convert this recipe to a con-
densed version, add an additional 1⁄2 teaspoon cornstarch and use only 1 can of
vegetable broth.
Tools: Blender
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
274
Part III: Dishes to Enjoy Before, After, or Any Time 
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 celery stalk, sliced thin
8-ounce can mushroom stems and pieces
(reserve liquid)
Two 14.5-ounce cans vegetable broth
11⁄2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
11⁄4 cups half-and-half
2 tablespoons sherry
1 In a medium skillet, sauté the onion, garlic, celery, and mushrooms in the butter over
medium heat until the onions are translucent and soft (about 6 minutes), stirring fre-
quently.
2 Add 11⁄2 cups of the broth and simmer until the vegetables are very soft (about 
10 minutes).
3 In a medium bowl, stir the cornstarch into the remaining broth until smooth.
4 Put the vegetable mixture, the remainder of the broth, the cheese, salt, and pepper into
a blender. Cover and puree. (Alternative method: You can blend the mixture with a
wand blender until it’s smooth.) Spoon the mixture into a medium saucepan.
5 Add the reserved mushroom liquid.
6 Heat the soup over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
7 Stir in the half-and-half and simmer until the soup is warmed. Do not allow the mixture
to boil.
8 Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the sherry.

T Three Bean Soup
Beans are high in carbs, but the good kind of carbs, the natural (not processed) carbs.
They also are high in protein and fiber and contain almost no sodium or fat. Now how
good is that? Using canned beans in this recipe cuts down on the preparation time of
this soup without cutting down on taste. By mashing a few of the beans, the soup
becomes thicker.

T Spinach Lentil Soup
This soup makes eating healthy fun and painless. You’ll have to do a lot of searching 
to find a soup that is healthier for you and tastes better than this one. Adding a teeny
amount of cider vinegar makes all the difference in the world in the taste of this creation.
If the tomato sauce and salt are added too early, the lentils may not cook thoroughly.

T Waist-Slimming Cabbage Soup
Make a large pot of this soup because it will keep in the refrigerator for several days.
That’s the bad news because now you don’t have any excuse not to have it for lunch. It
won’t be as easy to say, “Oh, I just ran out of cabbage soup.” The good news is that this
is one terrific-tasting soup. Forget that it’s healthy and just enjoy how good it is.

Chili and Chowders: A More Filling Chow
Did you know (or even care) that the name chowder is French for “cauldron”?
Chowders are soups that are thickened with milk. Although milk is good,
using half-and-half is even better — it makes thicker and richer soups.
As for chili, each part of the country claims to have the best chili — whether
it’s Real Texas Chili, Authentic Cincinnati Chili, West Virginia’s Real McCoy
Chili, or California Turkey Chili (how can Turkey Chili be real chili?). Despite
all these claims, the very best chili recipe doesn’t come from any of these
states or locales. The very best chili is the recipe for Unrivaled Chili below!

Unrivaled Chili
This chili is beyond mouth warming and tongue tingling. It borders on stomach-lining
challenging. After an initial tasting, you can add more chili powder or a few drops of
gluten-free hot pepper sauce if you like your tongue to blister and swell and your throat
to be on fire. (We recommend that you taste this recipe first to be sure you want to add
more hot stuff.) You can adorn your bowl with a dollop of sour cream, chopped green
onions, cheddar cheese, or whatever you like. Serve this chili with gluten-free crackers,
serve it over gluten-free pasta, or just eat it as is for the greatest bowl of chili you’ve
ever tasted!

Stupendous Snacks
In This Chapter
 Gluten-free treats for kids of all ages
 Snacks that are chillin’
 Lovin’ from the oven
A
s “into” nutrition as I am, I’m still a snacker.
Pretty much all day long, I’m eating, so it’s
important to have handy, quick snacks, sans
gluten, of course. Because we live in a society
where snacks usually consist of crackers, cookies,
or pretzels, it may seem at first as though gluten-
free snacks would be hard to come by. But there’s
so much good news to convey about gluten-free
snacking that the only problem is where to begin.
People today lead busy lifestyles, so we’re usually grabbing snack foods to
save time — so snacks-on-the-run are key. But snacking is more than just a
time-saver. And while it sometimes has a bad rap, it turns out snacking may
actually be good for you.
A study done throughout 12 European countries showed that people who eat
more frequently are actually healthier than those who eat three square meals
a day. (Hooray for snacking!) Some elderly people have poor appetites, so
snacking more frequently enables them to get the nutrition they need.
Snackers also tend to eat throughout the day (as opposed to throughout the
evening), so their bodies have time to burn off the calories before bedtime.
And finally, the more you snack, the more your body has to work to digest 
all that food — and that uses up more energy. Aren’t all the health experts
telling us we should expend more energy? So eating must be good for us, 
and eating often must be better. Nibbling between meals lessens the hunger

pangs, preventing gorging at mealtime. (Okay, okay, I know that what you’re
snacking on is an important consideration, but this is the snack chapter, not
the weight-loss chapter.)
Now that I’ve made our case for snacking, let’s get to it!
Snackin’ Healthy
No matter what your age, you should be aware of a couple of rules when it
comes to snacking. Know the ingredients in snacks you buy off the grocery
shelf. For a general healthy rule, try to stay away from Olestra, artificial
sweeteners, and anything hydrogenated (trans fats) or with MSG (those
things don’t have gluten in them; they’re just bad for you).
When you read the list of ingredients, if a word has more than three syllables
and is hard to pronounce, it’s probably not good for you. Most likely it’s a
chemical additive and not something you should eat. You’re better off stick-
ing with natural ingredients.
If you’re watching your weight, beware of bowls and bags. Mindlessly reach-
ing into a large bag of chips or large bowl of popcorn usually ends up in
overindulgence and tight jeans. On the other hand, if you have these snacks
pre-portioned into snack-size self-seal bags or small serving plates, the
degree of debauchery is limited to the amount of goodies you can squeeze
into one little bag or onto one little plate.
One idea for snacking is to make your own gluten-free granola and trail mix.
Have bags of cherries or grapes handy. Gluten-free crackers with cheese are
always good. Keep a supply of gluten-free pretzels for the snack drawer. A
single-serving container of gluten-free yogurt with fruit is a healthy alterna-
tive. You can find several brands of gluten-free tortilla chips in the grocery
stores — add some salsa and you have a terrific snack. And it’s always fun to

Everybody loves to snack, whether it’s to curb the midafternoon grum-bel-
lies, to eat something small to get you through the evening after an early
dinner, or to make car trips or airline flights more pleasant. Snacking for
people on a gluten-free diet, though, requires a bit more planning than for
most people.
Some snacks require advance preparation because they need to be refriger-
ated or frozen. Let’s dig into some of the options.

T South-of-the-Border Cheese Ball
Most cheese balls are rolled in nuts. Nuts to that! This one has a covering in keeping
with the flavoring of the cheese ball. You can make this quick-to-assemble appetizer a
couple of days before company is expected and keep it wrapped in the refrigerator.
Serve it with Homemade Tortilla Chips (you can find the recipe later in this chapter).
Tools: Electric mixer
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Refrigeration time: 2 hours
Cooking time: None
Yield: 8 servings
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons salsa
1⁄3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1⁄2 envelope taco seasoning mix
1⁄3 cup crushed baked tortilla chips
Homemade Tortilla Chips (see recipe later in
this chapter)
1 In a medium mixing bowl, use the mixer to blend together the cream cheese, salsa,
Monterey Jack cheese, and seasoning mix until they’re thoroughly blended (about 30
seconds).
2 Place the crushed chips on a piece of plastic wrap.
3 With a rubber spatula, scoop the cheese onto the crushed chips and smooth it into a
ball. Roll the ball over the chips until it’s covered with chips.
4 Wrap the cheese ball in a fresh piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 2 hours until
it’s firm. Serve with Homemade Tortilla Chips.
Vary It! If you like hot! then use hot salsa and hot taco seasoning in this recipe.

T Tortilla Chips
Sure, you can buy a bag of gluten-free tortilla chips to serve with a cheese ball or chip
dip, but they’ll never measure up to these. Don’t be so eager to eat them that you cut
short the baking time; if you do, they won’t be crisp.

Nonstick cooking spray
Four 6-inch corn tortillas
4 teaspoons olive oil
Salt for seasoning
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2 Lightly brush both sides of each tortilla with the olive oil.
3 With a clean pair of scissors, a knife, or a sharp pizza cutter, cut each tortilla into 8 wedges.
4 Place the wedges in a single layer on the baking sheet.
5 Sprinkle each wedge with a dash of salt.
6 Bake the tortilla wedges at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the chips are crisp
and light golden, turning the chips once halfway through baking.
7 Transfer the chips to paper towels and allow them to cool completely.
8 Store the unused portion at room temperature in an airtight container.
Vary It! Tailor the chips to your liking by adding your favorite spices, like garlic powder,
gluten-free barbecue seasoning, gluten-free Cajun seasoning, or gluten-free taco seasoning.

dients, pureeing until smooth. You may need to scrape down the sides of the blender
during this process. Depending on your personal taste, you may want to add more
lemon juice.
3 Spoon the mixture into a serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate the hummus for several
hours to allow the flavors to blend.

T Caramel Milkshakes
Warning! This milkshake is definitely addictive! It takes moments to prepare and hours to

Fixing Salts and Sweets to 
Satisfy Your Munchies
Two hours after dinner, are you or a member of your family standing in front
of the refrigerator, with the door wide open, trying to figure out what to eat
next? Do you find yourself staring at the fridge for several minutes at a time?
Don’t get depressed; get determined. When you feel a snack attack coming
on, you still have time to prepare a hot snack. Snacking definitely need not be
dreary. You can make some of the selections in this section at the last minute,
when the impulse hits. You can make others ahead and store them so your
cache is always full.

T Honey Cinnamon Grahams
Whether you’re making s’mores, a base for a cheesecake, or just snacking on these
crackers, they are delicious. Watch the crackers closely in the oven. You want to bake
them until the edges are just beginning to show signs of browning. Overbaking causes
these crackers to get too hard. Should that happen, don’t throw them away! Put them in
a blender and puree them to use in a pie crust or as a base for a dessert.
Tools: Electric mixer, rolling pin
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 9 to 11 minutes

3⁄4 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄4 cup coconut flour
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons honey
1⁄3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon milk
Nonstick cooking spray
1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar
1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour mixture, coconut flour, salt, cinnamon, and
baking powder.
3 In a large mixing bowl, use the mixer to whip together the butter, honey, sugar, vanilla,
and milk.
4 Slowly add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture. Mix on medium speed until
blended. (You may have to add a few more drops of milk if the dough won’t hold
together. The dough should be pliable.)
5 Lightly spray 2 baking sheets with the cooking spray.
6 On a sheet of plastic wrap, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to 1⁄4-inch thick. Cut the
dough into 2-inch squares and place the crackers on the prepared baking sheets.
7 Prick the top of each cracker several times with the tines of a fork.
8 Sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar.
9 Bake the crackers at 325 degrees for 9 to 11 minutes until the edges are barely begin-
ning to brown. Remove the crackers to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container.
Tip: If you keep your coconut flour in the freezer, it may pack together. Take it out of the
freezer the night before you plan to use it.

T Trail Mix Bars
If you look at the ingredients for this snack and think, “Hmm, this looks too healthy for
me!” don’t be misled. Oh, it’s healthy alright, but the honey and brown sugar definitely
put these bars in the bet-you-can’t-eat-just-one category. These bars hold for several
days and are a far better alternative than packing cookies in lunchboxes.

1⁄2 cup sesame seeds
1⁄2 cup sunflower seeds
1⁄2 cup coconut
1⁄2 cup slivered almonds
1⁄2 cup raisins
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 1⁄2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
Nonstick cooking spray
1 In a small, dry skillet, heat the sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring often, until
they’re lightly browned. Place the browned seeds in a medium bowl. Repeat with the
sunflower seeds, then the coconut, and then the almonds.
2 Stir the raisins and cinnamon into the seed mixture.
3 In a small saucepan, warm the butter, honey, and brown sugar over medium heat to soft-
ball stage, or 238 degrees on a candy thermometer. At this temperature, a small amount
of this syrup dropped into cold water will form a soft, flexible ball. If you remove the ball
from the water, it will flatten like a pancake after a few moments in your hand.
4 Pour the syrup over the seed mixture. Using a rubber spatula, blend the ingredients
well to coat evenly.
5 Press the mix into a 9-inch-square pan that has been sprayed with cooking spray and let
it cool slightly.
6 Cut the trail mixture into 24 pieces before the bars have completely cooled. Store the
bars in an airtight container.
Vary It! In place of the raisins (or in addition to the raisins), you can use dried cranber-
ries, cut-up dates, or dried apricots.

T Better Than S’mores!
Who doesn’t love s’mores? Be sure to eat this snack as soon as it comes out of the pan
(actually, let it cool just a tad so you don’t burn your tongue). If you reheat this, the tor-
tillas will become like leather. But freshly made, the tortillas are crisp and delicious.
Have a napkin ready because these may be a little messy.

T Cheesy Crisps
Take a cracker, crumble it all up, add one more thing to it, then make a new cracker out
of it. That may not make a lot of sense, but it doesn’t have to because the finished prod-
uct is wonderful. The crackers we used in this recipe were Foods Alive Mexican Harvest
Flax Crackers. You want to use a cracker that has spices and a touch of tangy flavor.
These particular crackers have an advantage because they are made from flax seeds;
you need a cracker with seeds for this recipe. To measure the 11⁄2 cups of crackers,
break the whole crackers into bits and squish them into a measuring cup.

Decadent Desserts
In This Chapter
 Cobbling together perfect pies and fruity desserts
 Creating can’t-pass-up cookies and cakes
 Concocting impressive endings for special occasions
You’ve probably heard the saying “Life is
short. Eat dessert first.” Let’s get real here
and acknowledge that the most important food
group is really dessert. Sure it’s feasible to serve
cheese and grapes for dessert, but that doesn’t
contain nearly the amount of sugar needed to sat-
isfy a genuinely refined sweet tooth. Nor does it
contain nearly enough calories to qualify as deca-
dent. Dessert really should be an indulgence,
something to anticipate, and something that you
certainly don’t have to be hungry to consume and
thoroughly enjoy.
Desserts are a reflection of our society (this is the
philosophical part of the book). Years ago, lime
gelatin infused with crushed pineapple and minia-
ture marshmallows constituted dessert. Today our tastes have become
refined as we enjoy tiramisu, caramel turtle pecan cheesecake, and baklava
sundaes (yeah, even if you’re gluten-free!), just to name a few.
Why is dessert so important? Because dessert makes us happy. That’s the
good news. The bad news is that an odd phenomenon occurs when we con-
sume too many desserts — our jeans shrink.
Let’s contemplate this conundrum and look at the true problems. No one has
totally ruined her health by consuming a bite of a luscious dessert. The real
health culprits are the continual diet of high-fat foods, lack of exercise, and
skipping meals, and then gorging.

Many desserts are made with fats (butters, shortening, oil). Using margarine
as a butter substitute isn’t the solution because margarine contains fat, too. If
you’re health conscious, when baking cakes, you often can replace half of the
fat in a recipe with applesauce or use 3⁄4 cup vegetable or olive oil for each
cup of butter. Olive oil and vegetable oil are fats, but they are a far healthier
choice compared to butter, shortening, or margarine.
Some decadent-tasting desserts are actually quite low in calories and fat. 
The Liqueur Cups in this chapter have only 166 calories per serving with just
5 grams of fat. The Chocolate Cranberry Cookies have 56 calories with 2
grams of fat. And all desserts have fewer calories when you only eat half 
a piece!
Pies and Cobblers You Can’t Resist
Gluten-free pie crusts have been a challenge to many newly diagnosed celiacs.
They needn’t be. They can be easy to make, no matter how flaky you are. First,
you don’t even need a dough pie crust for many recipes. Crushed gluten-free
cookies or nut crusts often work as a viable substitute.
For double-crust fruit pies, you can follow a few tricks for a successful gluten-
free crust:
 Use ice-cold ingredients (butter or shortening, water or milk).
 Roll out the pastry between two sheets of plastic wrap (instead of wax
paper), and sprinkle the plastic wrap with confectioners’ sugar (instead
of gluten-free flour mixture or cornstarch). Roll the dough thin. If the pie
crust is too thick, it may not bake completely on the bottom.
 Moisten the edge of the bottom crust with water before placing the
second crust on top. The moistened edge helps create a good seal after
the two crusts are crimped together.
If you have any dough scraps left over, make a snack out of them — cut the
dough into squares (or any shape you like), lightly butter them, sprinkle
them with cinnamon sugar, and bake until they’re golden.
The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. If you look up the defini-
tion of cobbler, you’ll find it described as “A deep-dish fruit pie with a top
crust.” That’s it? This definition is missing the description of the aroma of the
cobbler as it bakes and the scent drifts through the house. Nowhere in the
definition does it describe how your heart begins to palpitate stronger as
your fork cuts through the crisp crust, anticipating that first bite. Nor does it
take into account the gratification and fulfillment you feel when that first bite
of cobbler tantalizes your taste buds. The definition definitely does not do
justice to the ever-popular cobbler.

Coconut Lemon Chiffon Pie
This is a very light dessert and perfect for summer entertaining. If you feel a real urge to
exhibit domestic exuberance, you can toast the coconut before making the crust. This
lends a different, almost nutty flavor to the crust as the heat releases the natural oils.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Refrigeration time: 2 hours

Chapter 19: Decadent Desserts
11⁄2 cups shredded coconut
1⁄2 cup confectioners’ sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
6-ounce can frozen lemonade, thawed
8 ounces (1 small container) nondairy
whipped topping, thawed
3 tablespoons fudge ice cream topping
8 thin slices fresh lemon
1 In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut and sugar. Gradually stir in the melted
butter. Press the mixture evenly over the bottom and sides of a lightly oiled 9-inch pie
plate. Refrigerate the crust until it’s firm (about 1 hour).
2 In a large bowl, stir together the condensed milk, lemonade, and whipped topping until
no streaks remain. Spoon the filling into the chilled pie crust.
3 Spoon the ice cream topping into a small, microwave-safe bowl, and heat the topping in
the microware until it’s fairly liquid, stirring frequently. Drizzle the topping over the fill-
ing.
4 Refrigerate the pie until the filling thickens, at least 1 hour. Before serving, put the
lemon slices around the edge of the topping.
Vary It! If chocolate isn’t your most favorite thing in life (although how could it not be?),
you can drizzle the top of the pie with whisked raspberry jam instead of the fudge topping.

Peanut Butter Custard Pie
This is unlike anything that has ever touched your palate before. Divine simply doesn’t
encompass the range of taste sensations that await you. If you’re a fan of crunchiness, use
extra-crunchy gluten-free peanut butter in place of creamy style. If you want to show off for
guests, sprinkle a 11⁄2-inch line of crushed peanuts around the edge after frosting the pie.

7.2-ounce box gluten-free shortbread cookies
1⁄4 cup plus 1⁄2 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoons plus 2 1⁄4 teaspoons cornstarch
11⁄2 cups water
14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
1⁄2 of 11.75-ounce jar hot fudge sauce
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray an 8-inch pie plate with cooking spray.
2 Break the cookies into a plastic self-seal bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the cookies until
they’re finely ground. Transfer the cookies to a medium bowl.
3 Add 1⁄4 cup of peanut butter. Using a rubber spatula, mix the cookies and peanut butter
until they’re thoroughly blended.
4 Press the mixture onto the bottom and up sides of the prepared pie plate. The mixture
will be sticky. Use the back of a wet spoon to help spread the crust, or dip your fingers
in confectioners’ sugar to spread the crust with your hands.
5 Bake the crust at 375 degrees for 10 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and cool
completely.
6 In a large mixing bowl, whisk all of the cornstarch into the water until it dissolves.
7 Stir in the condensed milk and egg yolks.
8 Add the remaining 1⁄2 cup of peanut butter, and use the mixer to whip the ingredients on
low speed for 45 seconds.
9 Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring con-
stantly with a whisk. Lower the heat to medium-high and continue cooking and stirring
the mixture until it has thickened. Remove the mixture from the heat.
10 Stir in the butter and vanilla.
11 Cool the filling slightly before pouring it into the pie crust.

Nonstick cooking spray
7 cups peeled, thinly sliced Red or Golden
Delicious apples (6 to 7 apples)
1⁄4 cup plus 1/2 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1⁄4 teaspoon plus 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon plus 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoons bottled lemon juice
1⁄2 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄2 cup almond meal
1 cup chopped pecans
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 10-inch pie plate with cooking spray.
2 Place the apple slices in a medium bowl. Stir in 1⁄4 cup of brown sugar, the granulated
sugar, cornstarch, 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt, 1⁄2 teaspoon of cinnamon, the nutmeg, and lemon
juice.
3 Spoon the mixture into the prepared pie plate.

Crafting Cookies and Cakes from Scratch
Everyone loves cookies of all shapes, sizes, and flavors. Gluten-free cookies
require just a bit more effort, but the results will be every bit as good as their
wheat counterparts. When converting a wheat-based cookie recipe to gluten-
free, you need to increase the leavening agent (usually gluten-free baking
powder or baking soda) and the flavoring (add more vanilla or almond flavor-
ing), and it’s wise to add something that will add flavor; perhaps try toasted
chopped nuts, chocolate pieces, toasted coconut, or dried fruits. You may
want to substitute part of the liquid with juice, brewed coffee, or even a
liqueur. When rolling out dough for cut-out cookies, sprinkle your rolling sur-
face with confectioners’ sugar instead of dusting it with gluten-free flour.
(Using the flour mixture may make the cookies too dry.)
Gluten-free cookies don’t stay fresh as long as wheat-based cookies, so you
should either freeze them until they’re needed, or sit down and eat every last
one of them as soon as they’re removed from the oven!
Here are a few tips for keeping your cookies at their best:
 If you made crispy cookies that are now several days old and are start-
ing to lose their crunch, recrisp them by laying them on a baking sheet
and heating them in a 300-degree oven for 3 to 4 minutes.
 If you made soft cookies that are now drying out, wrap a few in a damp
paper towel and microwave them for a few seconds.
Many of the cookie issues regarding conversions apply to cakes as well. The
alternative flours are heavier than wheat flour so they won’t rise as much
unless you add some extra stuff. As with cookies, you’ll need to increase the
amount of leavening and flavoring. It also helps to add an extra egg (both to
help keep the cake moist and for leavening). Gluten-free pastries in general
turn out better if you use whole milk rather than low-fat or skim milk. But
because you’re lucky enough to have this book, the recipes here already have
all of those adjustments made.
To keep a layer cake in place on the cake plate, place a dab of frosting on the
plate before placing the bottom layer. This holds the cake in place while you
frost it. One more tip: If you plan to adorn your creation with shaved choco-
late curls, white or milk chocolate makes better chocolate shavings because
they’re softer and curl more easily.

Chocolate Cranberry Cookies
If you’ve been dreaming of a cookie that will hold for more than one day and actually
doesn’t taste gluten-free, then your dreams have just been fulfilled. These stay moist
and they freeze well.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Refrigeration time: 2 hours
Cooking time: 12 minutes
Yield: 54 cookies
303
Chapter 19: Decadent Desserts
2 ounces (2 squares) unsweetened chocolate
1⁄4 cup vegetable shortening or butter
1 cup granulated sugar
2 1⁄2 teaspoons vanilla
2 eggs
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1⁄2 cup dried cranberries
1⁄2 cup confectioners’ sugar
Nonstick cooking spray
1 In a medium saucepan, melt the chocolate and shortening over medium-low heat, stir-
ring occasionally.
2 Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the sugar and vanilla. Whisk in the eggs,
one at a time.
3 In a large bowl, sift together the flour mixture, baking powder, and salt.
4 Stir the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Stir in the
chocolate chips and cranberries. Refrigerate the dough for 2 hours.
5 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
6 Roll the dough into 1-inch balls, and then roll the balls in the confectioners’ sugar to
coat. Place the dough balls 2 inches apart on the baking sheets that have been lightly
sprayed with cooking spray. The cookies will spread during baking.
7 Bake the cookies at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. The cookies will be soft; let them rest
on the baking sheets for 2 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool.
Vary It! Forgo rolling the cookies in the confectioners’ sugar before baking, and when the
cookies have cooled, frost them with a chocolate glaze instead.

Whoopie Pies
Whether you’re a kid of 3 or 103, everyone loves Whoopie Pies! We used 6 sections of an
8-ounce dark chocolate candy bar (16 total sections in the bar) for this recipe. Make
plenty of these, and then wrap them individually and freeze them so you’ll always have
a back-up snack on hand.
Tools: Electric mixer

Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄4 cup butter, softened
2⁄3 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons pure cocoa
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
3⁄4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
3 ounces (6 squares) dark chocolate, grated
1⁄2 cup whole milk
Whoopie Pie Filling (see the following recipe)
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray two baking sheets with cooking spray.
2 In a large mixing bowl, use the mixer to cream together the butter, brown sugar, egg,
and vanilla. In another bowl, stir together the cocoa, flour mixture, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt. Stir in the grated chocolate.
3 Add the dry ingredients alternately with milk to the butter mixture, beating until the
mixture is smooth. The batter will become very thick.
4 Drop 2 tablespoons of batter onto the baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon that has
been dipped in hot water, flatten the batter into a thin circle about 11⁄2 inches in diame-
ter. Repeat with the remaining dough. These cookies puff up but won’t spread very
much. You should have a total of 20 rounds.

5 Bake the dough at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, or until the rounds are firm to the touch.
Cool the rounds on a wire rack.
6 Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling (see the following recipe) on half of the rounds,
and then top the filling with the remaining rounds, pressing down gently to distribute
the filling evenly.
Tip: In most recipes where chocolate is used as an ingredient, it lists 1 square of chocolate
as being equal to 1 ounce. In this recipe, 2 squares of chocolate is equivalent to 1 ounce.
The reason is that semisweet or unsweetened chocolate is found in the baking section of
the grocery store, and each square equals 1 ounce. Dark chocolate, however, is not found
in the baking section because it doesn’t come packaged like the other baking chocolates.
You have to buy a large, dark chocolate candy bar where each square is only 1⁄2 of an
ounce. That’s why this recipes lists “3 ounces (6 squares) dark chocolate,” while the other
recipes show 3 ounces as 3 squares.

3⁄4 cup blanched slivered almonds
1 tablespoon plus 2 tablespoons butter,
softened
2⁄3 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1⁄4 teaspoon almond flavoring
11⁄2 cups gluten-free flour mixture
11⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
4 ounces (4 squares) semisweet chocolate
1 teaspoon corn oil
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with wax paper (or parchment
paper).
2 In a small skillet, sauté the almonds in 1 tablespoon of butter until they’re golden, stir-
ring frequently. Remove them from the heat and let cool.
3 In a medium mixing bowl, use the mixer to whip together the remaining 2 tablespoons
of butter, the sugar, and eggs on high speed until the mixture is thick and fluffy (about 2
minutes). Add the vanilla and almond flavorings.

4 In a small bowl, whisk together the flour mixture, baking powder, baking soda, coffee
granules, salt, and cinnamon. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, beating just until
the mixtures are thoroughly combined. Fold in the chocolate chips and almonds.
5 Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. With damp hands, form the dough
into a log about 14 inches long and 2 inches high. (The dough will be somewhat sticky
to work with, but don’t add more flour or your biscotti will turn out dry.)
6 Bake the dough at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until it just begins to brown on the
outside and is firm to the touch.
7 Remove the log from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.
8 Gently slice the log into 1⁄2-inch slices. Stand the slices upright on a baking sheet. Bake
them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes until they’re firm (but not rock hard) and golden.
Remove the biscotti from the oven and cool.
9 Cut the semisweet chocolate into small pieces and place it in a medium skillet with the
oil. Heat the chocolate and oil very slowly over low heat, stirring often, until the choco-
late has melted. (If the heat is too high, the chocolate will burn.)
10 Remove the skillet from the heat and dip the bottoms of the biscotti in the chocolate to
coat. Set each piece on its side on a piece of wax paper to dry.
Vary It! If you want to live life on the wild side, soak some dried cranberries in Kahlua
and then fold them into the batter when you add the chocolate chips and almonds.

Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄4 cup plus 2⁄3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons plus 1⁄4 cup water
1⁄4 cup butter, softened
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
13⁄4 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup milk
Caramel Fondant Frosting (see the following
recipe)
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut a piece of wax paper to fit the bottom of a 9-inch
cake pan. Spray the cake pan with cooking spray, and then insert the wax paper and
spray the top of the wax paper.
2 In a small stainless steel saucepan, stir together 1⁄4 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of
water. Over high heat and stirring constantly, cook the mixture until it’s dark amber and
the sugar has totally melted (about 4 minutes). Remove from the heat.
3 Very slowly, add the remaining 1⁄4 cup of water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Warning: When
you add the first 2 tablespoons, there will be a lot of splattering. Stand back so you
don’t get burned. Let the sizzling subside before adding the next tablespoon of water.
4 Return the pan to the heat. Using a whisk, stir the mixture for 30 seconds. Remove from
the heat and let the syrup cool.
5 In a large mixing bowl, use the mixer to cream the butter. Add the remaining 2⁄3 cup of
sugar and continue whipping until the ingredients are fluffy.
6 Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition.
7 Add the vanilla and mayonnaise.
8 Add the cooled sugar syrup, mixing well.
9 In a small bowl, sift together the flour mixture, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry
ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the milk. Use the mixer to whip the
batter at medium speed until it’s smooth.

10 Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.
11 Bake the batter at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean.
12 Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, and then invert it onto a cooling rack.
13 When the cake is cool, invert it onto a serving platter and frost it with the Caramel
Fondant Frosting.
Tip: The frosting will be fairly fluid when you spread it on the cake, but it thickens as it sets
to form a smooth topping. After you pour the frosting over the top of the cake, use a spoon
to spread it just over the edges of the cake so some of the frosting drips down the sides.

Surprising Guests with Fancy Finales
When you’re preparing a meal for a really special occasion, you want to serve
something that will earn ohhhs and ahhhs. The dessert recipes in this section
will elicit all sorts of praise, but only after your guests get over their delight
at all the trouble you went to for them. (Truthfully, some of these desserts
are surprisingly easy, but no one needs to know that.)
The platter you use to serve the dessert makes a difference. Think about it.
Doesn’t pudding taste better when it’s served in a champagne goblet rather
than out of a plastic bowl? The extra effort you take to add finishing touches
to both the platter and the dessert will enhance the total effect.
Decorate the plate, but also decorate the dessert. Picture a piece of cheese-
cake served on its side on a chipped, everyday dish. Now picture that same
piece of cheesecake set upon an attractive glass dish that has been drizzled
with raspberry syrup and melted white chocolate or dusted with cocoa.
Which presentation is more appealing? If you have a frosted cake, use a damp
paper towel to pick up chopped nuts or coconut and adhere them to the side
of the cake. If you’re serving a chocolate cake, load the top with thickly
shaved chocolate curls. Even before your guests taste the wonderful dessert,
their sense of sight will appreciate the effort you went to and will stimulate
their desire to consume your divine creation.

No-Bake Lemon Squares
These most definitely are not the lemon squares you have eaten in the past. Sometimes
when you’re expecting company, you simply don’t have enough time to make a compli-
cated dessert, yet you want something delicious to serve. These squares take just minutes
to put together. Be sure to allow for chilling time, both for the dessert and for yourself!

1 In a small bowl, use a fork to blend the cookie crumbs, sugar, and butter.
2 Pat the crumbs into a 9-inch square pan, reserving 1⁄4 cup for the topping.
3 Put the frosting, cottage cheese, and sour cream into a large mixing bowl. Use the mixer
to beat the ingredients on high until they’re well blended.
4 Spoon the cream mixture on top of the crust.
5 Sprinkle the reserved crumbs on top of the cream mixture.
6 Cover the pan with foil and freeze for at least 3 hours. Remove the squares from the
freezer 20 minutes before cutting and serving.
Tip: Pamela’s Lemon Shortbread Cookies are perfect for this recipe. There are 9 cookies in
a 7.25 ounce box, so two boxes will be needed . . . and that will leave you with 6 extra
cookies to snack on or pack in lunches.
Vary It! Not crazy about lemon? Use chocolate cookies for the base and gluten-free
canned chocolate frosting in the mix.

Pumpkin Cheesecake
Using premade cookies as the base for this dessert saves you the time of making them
from scratch, and you should be able to find excellent gluten-free, packaged gingersnap
cookies on the market. You can add a simple garnish by putting dollops of sweetened
12⁄3 cups gluten-free lemon cookie crumbs
(about 12 cookies pureed in a blender)
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 1⁄2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 can ready-to-spread lemon frosting
1 cup small-curd cottage cheese
1 cup sour cream

whipped cream or gluten-free nondairy whipped topping around the edges, and then
sprinkling the dollops lightly with cinnamon.

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, mix together the gingersnap crumbs, pecans, and butter with a fork.
Press the crust mixture onto the bottom and 11⁄2 inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform
pan. Bake the crust at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. When the crust is finished baking,
turn the oven temperature down to 325 degrees.
3 In a large mixing bowl, use the mixer to whip together the cream cheese, 1⁄2 cup of sugar,
and vanilla until they’re well blended.
4 Add the eggs, one at a time, until they’re blended into the batter.
5 Reserve 1 cup of the batter and set it aside.
6 To the remaining batter in the bowl, add the remaining 1⁄4 cup of sugar, pumpkin, cinna-
mon, nutmeg, and ginger. Using the mixer, blend well.
7 Spoon the batters alternately on top of the crust. Using a knife, cut through the batter
to marbleize.
8 Bake the batter at 325 degrees for 1 hour, or until the top of the cheesecake is dry and
the edges are just beginning to brown.
9 Run a knife around the edge of pan, and then let the cake cool completely.
10 When the cheesecake is thoroughly cooled, remove the side of the pan and transfer the
cake to a serving dish. Cover and refrigerate.
Tip: Make sure the cheesecake cools completely before refrigerating it to avoid the top
from cracking or getting weepy (where moisture condenses on top of the cheesecake).

Liqueur Cups with Mocha Raspberries
In case the title of the recipe didn’t give it away, this piece of work is impressive.
Instead of making your own chocolate cups, you can pick up a package of one of several
excellent commercial gluten-free chocolate cups on the market.

16 chocolate-covered espresso beans
16 fresh raspberries
1 teaspoon corn oil
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, divided
32 large marshmallows
1⁄2 cup whole milk
3 tablespoons amaretto
3 tablespoons crème de cacao
8-ounce container nondairy whipped topping,
thawed
1 Insert an espresso bean in the center of each raspberry.
2 Melt 1⁄3 cup of chocolate chips with the oil in the top of a double boiler over barely sim-
mering water (do not allow the water to boil or to touch the bottom of the top pan).
3 Roll the stuffed raspberries lightly in the chocolate and set them on wax paper to dry.
4 Melt 1⁄3 cup of chocolate chips in a double boiler over barely simmering water (do not
allow the water to boil or to touch the bottom of the top pan). Dip a new, clean, dry 
1⁄2-inch pastry brush in the melted chocolate. Brush the chocolate on the bottom and
insides of the baking cups, approximately 1⁄8 inch thick, pushing the chocolate into the
ridges and smoothing as much as possible. Place the papers or foil cups into muffin pan
cups. Chill until the chocolate has set.
5 Carefully peel off the paper or foil; set the chocolate cups aside.
6 In a medium saucepan, combine the marshmallows, the remaining 1⁄3 cup of chocolate
chips, and the milk. Stir constantly over low heat until the chocolate melts and the
ingredients are combined. Refrigerate the filling for a few minutes until it thickens.
7 Stir in the amaretto and crème de cacao.
8 Fold in the whipped topping.
9 Carefully spoon the mixture into the chocolate cups. Place a mocha raspberry on top of
each dessert. Refrigerate until serving time.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
E
very For Dummies books concludes with top-ten lists,
and this one is no exception. You’ll find one chapter
with suggestions for gluten-free comfort foods, and
another with ideas for cooking gluten-free with the kids.

Chapter 20
Ten Easy-to-Prepare
Comfort Foods
In This Chapter
 KISS: Keep It Simple, Silly
 Warming you from the inside out
You know what comfort foods are — they’re the foods you turn to when
you’re stressed, sad, depressed, happy, or looking for some nostalgic
association with memories of the past. But we all know what comfort food
really means. It means carbs, and I’m not talking about the kind of carbs
you get from a pile of broccoli. It means gluten, and you know it!
Comfort foods are foods like biscuits, breads, cinnamon rolls, donuts, 
bagels . . . all the stuff that’s off-limits when you’re gluten-free. Without
those foods to turn to, you may feel stranded, deprived, and restricted,
singing, “I can’t get no (uh) sa-tis-FAC-tion . . .”
Nope. No singing, no crying, no feeling like you can’t have those old family
faves. I have some ideas for satisfying those urges while staying 100 percent
gluten-free. I’ll warn you, though, they’re not necessarily calorically correct,
so don’t come cryin’ to me when your jeans don’t fit anymore.
Get Your Kicks with an Easy Mix
Fine. I know this is a cookbook. I know you, being a cookbook reader, love to
search for hard-to-find, ridiculously expensive ingredients. I know you even
don’t mind measuring, and that you have the patience to let something rise.
You might even know what “proofing” is.
Well at the risk of offending those of you Real Cooks, I’m not that. Not any of
it. If I want to satisfy my craving for brownies, cookies, cakes, breads, and
other wumfy comfy foods, I turn to my favorite mix. Add to it a couple of
eggs, a swish of oil, a glob or two of water or milk, and I stick it in the oven,

patting myself on the back like I’m Danna Krocker. And you know what? No
one knows the difference!
Mom’s Old-Fashioned Meatloaf
Nothing says “comfort” like Mom’s meatloaf. Just take ground beef (or turkey
if you’re watching your weight), and add some onion, basil (or any other
spices you’d like), a couple of eggs, and some gluten-free crackers or bread
crumbs. It really doesn’t matter how much of anything you use, so don’t
sweat it. Using your hands, glob it all together until it’s a big ball of — well,
raw meatloaf. Stuff (proper cooks might use the term press) it into a pan — a
bread-loaf pan works well — and bake it at 325 degrees for 45 minutes to an
hour. You’ll know when it’s done when the juices that rise to the top are no
longer red — and when the crowd just can’t wait any longer.
No Woes with Nachos
It’s simple to make great nachos — you start by dumping a pile of chips on a
microwaveable or oven-safe plate and topping them with cheese. But from
there, you really should think outside the typical-nacho-toppin’s box and get
creative. Add some veggies (so you can call it nutritious) — maybe sliced
zucchini or yellow squash — tomatoes, jalapenos, cooked hamburger or ham
slices, chunks of turkey, maybe even anchovies. Okay, I heard a collective
groan of “EWWWWs” out there, but I personally love ’em, so give me a break.
Leave them off yours if you want to be a party pooper. Throw the whole mess
in the microwave or oven until the cheese melts, and you have yourself some
nachos. Remember to top them with guacamole!
Potato Salad with a Past
Whether it was part of the family picnics, or a Saturday night staple, potato
salad definitely makes it into the comfort food compartment. Start with
(please tell me you can guess what I’m going to say next) potatoes. Yes! You
guessed it! Potatoes! Just peel them, and then cook them for a really long
time — until they’re mushy-to-taste (some people like ’em chunky and
crunchy). Then drain and mush ’em up. At this point, you can add pretty
much anything you want and call it potato salad. Mayo, sour cream, hard-
boiled eggs, onion, sweet pickles or relish (ick), salt, pepper, spices . . . you
get the idea. Remember to refrigerate it if it has dairy products in it.
322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Heavenly Homemade Veggie Soup 
(Go Ahead and Add the Pasta!)
Soup is, by definition, a potpourri of yummy stuff all melded together in a big
hodge-podge of warmth and flavor. Cooking-wise, soup is my kind of recipe
rebel — for the most part, no matter what you throw in there, you can’t go
wrong. Shopping-wise, it’s easier yet: A quick stop in the meat aisle (or skip it
if you’re vegetarian), and another in the produce aisle, a quick grab of premade
chicken or beef stock, and you’re outta there. Throw everything into a slow
cooker or Dutch oven, and let it cook slowly, adding spices and extra water or a
little wine as you’d like. About five minutes before you want to eat, add some
gluten-free pasta, if you’d like. By the time you serve it, it should be just right.
Hey Puddin’, How’d Ya Get So Sweet?
Puddings are easy to make, using basic ingredients including milk, sugar,
eggs, fruits, and spices — as well as some kind of thickener such as gluten-
free flour (you may want to use rice or tapioca). Break out your most roman-
tic spices, add a little fruit (canned blueberries are nice), a teaspoon or so of
vanilla, and whip in a touch of cream. Cook the pudding slowly on the stove
in a double boiler, or maybe in a water bath in the oven. Take your time,
though. Puddings need to cook slowly to prevent curdling, and the family will
appreciate the scents that linger longer. Make lots, however, because pudding
is just as good cold as it is warm.
Chow Down New England Style!
Lots of things about clam chowder entitle it to bear the designation of a com-
fort food. It may bring back memories of celebrating the New Year with warm,
creamy white soup topped with paprika or nutmeg. Or maybe you’ve visited
or lived in New England, retaining nostalgic thoughts of the misty New
England coastline, the seafood, frosty winters, shrimp boats, and of course,
New England clam chowder!
The problem with most clam chowders is that the recipes call for flour — but
just a tablespoon or so. I figure, why bother? And, more important, what’s the
point? If you must, use a gluten-free flour to thicken, but note that purists
prefer their chowder un-thickened with plenty of crisp bacon, onion, new
potatoes, and thyme — and lots of fat, fresh-from-the-ocean clams! Not being
323
Chapter 20: Ten Easy-to-Prepare Comfort Foods

a purist or a Real Cook, I use canned minced clams. Serve with some crunchy
gluten-free crackers or bread you’ve made from a recipe in this book.
Quick and Simple “Mac-a-Cheese”
Few foods soothe the soul like creamy, gooey macaroni and cheese. Whipping
up a gluten-free version is quick and easy. There are all types of gluten-free
pastas available — some are made from corn, others from rice or brown rice,
and they come in all shapes and sizes. Best of all, they taste like the real deal!
They’re widely available these days, and even regular grocery stores often
carry them. Pick a pasta shape and taste you like, and cook it al dente (my
Real Cook friends tell me this means “so it’s not cooked all the way”). Add
your favorite kind of cheese (Velveeta works well and has even less fat and
calories than cheddar!), and let it melt. If you want a thinner consistency, add
a little milk and butter. Then dig in and enjoy the “mac-a-cheese” satisfaction.
Chase Away the Winter Blahs 
with a Big Bowl of Chili
There are a bazillion ways to make chili, but no matter how you make it, chili
always gives you that warm-you-from-the-inside comfort-food feeling. My per-
sonal favorite is black-bean chili, with or without meat. If I add meat, I usually
use ground turkey. Brown the meat first (I usually sauté some veggies with
the meat), and then just start adding ingredients. For this version, I use lots
of black beans (hence the clever name “black bean chili”), some diced chilies,
diced tomatoes, and the secrets to success: brown sugar and honey. I realize
that some like it thicker than others — to thin it out you can add some
chicken or beef stock, and then just let it simmer for hours. You can serve it
over brown rice, or if you like Ohio-style chili, you can serve it over pasta
with onions and cheese sprinkled on top.
Cheeseburgers in Paradise
Cheeseburgers are paradise, no matter where you are when you eat ’em. You
can try to find edible gluten-free hamburger buns, but I’ll warn you that they’re
tough to find, and they cost a fortune. Instead, consider wrapping your burger
in a crispy lettuce leaf (I like them chilled). Even most restaurants will serve
them that way, but be careful that they don’t just give you a burger that they’ve
plucked the bun off of, because the burger will be glutenated with bun crumbs.

Chapter 21
Ten Ideas for Cooking Gluten-Free
with the Kids
In This Chapter
 Letting your little helpers give you a hand
 Sneaking in some food facts
 Serving meals in creative settings
P
arents of young children have this June Cleaver fantasy of cooking with
kids. Everyone is wearing aprons (matching and homemade, of course).
The kids are standing on their stepstools (that they made with Dad in the
garage that morning) and politely taking turns measuring and pouring with-
out so much as a drop spilled on the counter. Half an hour later, a beautiful
creation is passed around and hailed as holy, while the children, bursting
with pride, sample their creations.
In reality, kids don’t care whether the electric mixer is still on when they pull
it out of the batter. Nor do they realize that it’s important to hold the cracked
egg over the bowl before breaking it open (but they do know that Mommy
grumbles a lot when she cleans eggs off the kitchen floor). They’re about as
careful at measuring as I am (not very), and although their hand-eye coordi-
nation for video games is exceptional, they can’t seem to pour an ingredient
into a bowl. And as for politely taking turns — yeah, a mom can dream.
But ya know what? It’s still fun. Really fun. And although little helpers are
sometimes far from helpful, getting in the kitchen and cooking something is a
part of life that no child should miss. Furthermore, learning to cook is educa-
tional and will encourage them to eat more nutritiously than if they become
accustomed to turning to processed snack foods.
So don your apron, dig up a makeshift stepstool or two, and keep the broom
and mop handy. It’s time to get cookin’ with the kids!

Have a Lasagna Night
Lasagna is a cinch. You can buy several varieties of gluten-free lasagna noo-
dles in health food stores. Personally, I like the type that doesn’t have to be
cooked first, because — well, I’ve already admitted that patience isn’t my
greatest strength, and using noodles that don’t have to be cooked first allows
me to skip a step. It also prevents me from cooking them too long and ending
up with mush. If you use the kind of lasagna noodles that don’t have to be
cooked first, be sure to make sure the dry noodles are touching sauce so they
become tender while they cook. Then just layer with your favorite ingredi-
ents like you would a “regular” lasagna, bake, and voilá! It’s lasagna night!
Use Cooking to Teach Ingredient Insights
One of the best ways to know whether a prepared food is gluten-free (at a
restaurant, for instance) is to know how it’s usually prepared. For example, if
you know that meatloaf generally has bread crumbs in it, you know that at a
restaurant, social event, friend’s house, or market, the meatloaf available to
the general public is probably off-limits. One of the valuable lessons kids pick
up when cooking with you is what ingredients generally go into what pre-
pared foods. They also start to understand how to make choices, substitu-
tions, and other decisions that are crucial for a gluten-free lifestyle.
Jazz Up Meals with Colorful Vegetables
The healthiest meal is one with a rainbow of colors. Prepare a healthy supply
of veggies, such as red, yellow, and green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers,
radishes, and carrots, and keep them in the refrigerator. Before serving, slice
the veggies thinly — or cut them into different shapes (pointy triangles,
twists, comb shapes, or whatever you can think of).
Throw a Homemade Pizza Party
Nothing is more fun to make together (albeit messy, messy, messy) than
pizza. Everyone can make theirs the way they like it, so you can turn it into a
pizza party and let everyone have it their way. Use a premade gluten-free
crust, or make one from the recipe in Chapter 10. Then set out a bunch of
veggies, remembering to incorporate lots of color, and whatever meats the
326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

kids like (or use the leftover meatloaf from Chapter 20’s recipe). Smear the
crust with a little spaghetti sauce, and then let the kids add the toppings they
like. Top with some grated cheese if you want, and then bake the pizzas at
325 degrees until the cheese starts to melt (about 8 to 10 minutes), and enjoy
the smell as it fills the house with that pizza-to-perfection aroma.
Try Some Herbalicious Preparations
People think children like things plain — and they do — but they also like a
little excitement in their foods. As you’re teaching them to cook, make sure to
introduce them to herbs, which add flavor and nutrients and are always gluten-
free. Let the kids pick out some fresh herbs from the store, or better yet, grow
your own in a windowsill herb garden. Pinch off a leaf every now and then,
squeeze it or rub it, and let the kids enjoy the different herbal fragrances. Let
them suggest recipes that would be good with the various herbs. Here are some
ideas: homemade tomato basil soup, Minty Juleps (using lemonade, Sprite, or
whatever you happen to have on hand), spaghetti, salads, and omelets.
Make It Fancy Schmancy
I know I’m all about simplicity, but everyone enjoys dressing up from time to
time. And what better reason to pull out the fancy duds than for an elegant
dinner that the kids plan. Don’t worry, you may think they’ll plan an all-
dessert-day (okay, those are fun, too!), but they won’t. They know what’s
good, and they’ll probably come up with some great ideas. Use your best
tableware and silverware, and make sure that good conversation is part of
the meal. Maybe play some soft music in the background. Have everyone
dress up! Try to have one of these elegant evenings once a month or so.
Have Fun with Food Facts
It’s never too early to teach children about good nutrition. Take time while
you’re cooking with your kids to talk to them about why they need to eat lots
of protein (it helps their muscles grow) and explain which foods are good
sources of protein. Remind them that fruits and veggies are important for lots
of reasons, and have them think of healthy snacks and meals. The more they
get involved with the decision-making process, the more impact it will have
on their food choices in the future.
327
Chapter 21: Ten Ideas for Cooking Gluten-Free with the Kids

Make Candy
You know those cute candied fruit and flowers that decorate cakes, cookies,
and other treats? They’re really not that hard to make! And kids love making
them — just watch out for curious little fingers wanting to dip into hot syrup!
Start by making sugar syrup (also called simple syrup) by mixing sugar and
water over low heat until it turns clear — then boil it for a minute or two longer.
You can make the syrup as sweet and thick as you want by adding extra sugar.
I’m really not much for measuring, but if you want a starting point, try three
parts water to one part sugar for thin syrup, and then keep adding sugar to
make it thicker. After you have the syrup the consistency you want, dip the fruit
or flowers in it. Set them on wax paper while the syrup cools and hardens.
Emphasize Breakfast by Making It Fun
Everyone knows breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so how do
you get kids to eat in the morning? It’s all about the fun! Try making funny-
face pancakes — just mix an egg, a little apple juice, some butter, and gluten-
free baking mix (sorry, I don’t measure — you know the consistency you’re
looking for!). You might want to add a little cinnamon or nutmeg for a twist.
Whisk it all together, and pour the batter into a lightly oiled frying pan —
make “ears” if you want — and then let the kids decorate the pancakes with
powdered sugar and maple syrup. They can use fruit chunks or slices for the
eyes; mouths can be made from oranges (go ahead and leave the rind on —
it’s edible and healthy!).
Picnic in the Playroom
Picnics are a blast, but sometimes the weather just doesn’t permit. That’s
okay. A picnic is still a picnic as long as some of the important elements are
there: eating with your fingers, sitting on a blanket on the ground, and maybe
even gluten-free s’mores! The important thing is to anticipate the fun of a
picnic, no matter where it is. Plan special foods to eat with your fingers, like
hot dogs, deviled eggs, chicken bites, and fruit chunks.
Oh, and about those s’mores. They’re really easy to make gluten-free style.
Just take your favorite cookie (some companies do make gluten-free
“graham” crackers) and use it for the outside. Roast your marshmallows —
sure, do it over the stove if you want, but be careful — then put part of a
chocolate bar in the middle and squish it all together. Now that’s a picnic!
