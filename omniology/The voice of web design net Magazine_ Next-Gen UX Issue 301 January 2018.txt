 WELCOME
The world of UX changes at such a pace it’s 
hard to keep track of where we’re at. The 
paradigm-shifting touchscreen has been the de facto 
product user interface for over a decade now, but 
we’re moving at full throttle towards a future  
of ‘invisible interfaces’. 
The popularity of Siri, Alexa and Google Home 
point to a more natural way of connecting with 
our devices, and with that brings a host of UX 
problems. How we design for the invisible interface 
revolution will be vastly different. We tasked Hilary 
Stephenson, managing director of digital UX agency 
Sigma, to reveal how we should approach UX design 
with voice-controlled products in mind.
Elsewhere, we dive into the science behind CRO 
and make sure you’re armed with everything you 
need to know about converting visitors to customers. 
There’s money to be made and a loyal following to 
gain. This issue our Projects section is packed with 
practical advice on exciting new technologies, too. 
Hopefully this will be old news by the time you 
read this, but we’re also delighted to announce 
that Generate, the conference for web design and 
development, is coming back to New York on 25-27, 
April 2018. It promises to be yet another amazing few 
days, and one headlined by a star-studded lineup.

ID: Automated tools can certainly go a long way towards helping ensure that your 
site’s code is accessible, although of course, they cannot test for everything. You can 
help improve the quality of your code by integrating automated tools such as Tenon 
(https://tenon.io) and Pa11y (http://pa11y.org) into your build workflow, which can help 
identify potential accessibility issues before something goes live. Ideally, any errors 
that are reported by these tools should block any build from going live. Additionally, 
developers can run these tools locally before they push any code to help identify any 
problems at an earlier stage.
Testing Building automated tools such as Tenon into your workflow can identify potential accessibility issues

Q&As
Outlook 2003, it might take quite a while 
to die out.
However I do have a little project I’m 
working on that uses divs in the HTML, 
which magically convert into tables 
when opened on Outlook. If you’re 
interested it’s up on GitHub at github.
com/M-J-Robbins/get-off-the-table.
ACCESSIBILITY
IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY
What does writing ‘accessible’ HTML and 
JS actually mean? If it’s valid HTML and 
works in all modern browsers, shouldn’t it 
be all good?
Scott Vinkle, Kingston, Ontario, Canada
ID: Working in the browser is too low 
a bar to set for whether something is 
accessible to all. A browser generally 
doesn’t care if you use a <div> instead of 
a <button>, and as long as a click handler 
does something with it, all is good. But 
for things to be keyboard accessible, 
or easier for tools like screen readers 
to interpret your HTML correctly and 
present the interface to users as it 
should be, you have to use the right 
elements for the job. Because these tools 
already know how to interpret these 
elements and how to handle them, and 
operating systems know how to deal 
with them via the keyboard.
EMAIL
FOR THE LOVE OF EMAIL
Can you share any advice on how you 
manage to do your job (in email coding) 
without ripping your hair out? 
Shane Hudson, West Sussex, UK
MR: I get asked that a lot, but I actually 
prefer working with email over web. 
If you want to do something on a 
zhevlwh/#|rx#fdq#Jrrjoh#lw#dqg#Ľqg#
pages of articles telling you how to 
do it. With email, you’re lucky if you 
Ľqg#rqh1#Lw#ihhov#olnh#wkhuh#lv#vwloo#vr#
much to discover with email. Email is 
dovr#ľhhwlqj#lq#lwv#qdwxuh1#\rx#fdq#eh#
experimenting with something new for 
every send if you want; you don’t have to 
maintain code you wrote two years ago, 
you don’t have old CSS styles interfering 
with your new code.
ACCESSIBILITY
AVOID COMMON MISTAKES
What are some accessibility ‘gotchas’ we 
should be looking out for when developing 
single-page applications? 
Zoë Bryant, London, UK
ID: Given the nature of single-page 
applications, things can be updating 
dynamically all the time, and you 
need to ensure accessibility tools are 
made aware of the changes so they can 
present them to the user. This is where 
WAI-ARIA can help a lot, as it provides 
methods such as live regions, which 
developers can take advantage of to 
alert tools to any onscreen changes. 
You may also have to rethink the UI of a 
single-page application and ask yourself 
questions like: ‘Do we really need to 
update the results list every time a new 
Ľowhu#lv#vhohfwhg/#ru#vkrxog#zh#ohw#wkh#
user decide when to apply them?’ Asking 
yourself questions like this can improve 
the experience for everyone.
 3 SIMPLE STEPS
Where do you think 
email will be in another 
10 years? All mobile? 
JavaScript? Decent CSS 
support? Or will it even be 
here at all? 
Steven Mansfield, Manchester, UK
Slack to the future?
A lot of people say email will be 
gone in 10 years, but there is a lot to 
indicate that it will survive. Things like 
Slack and WhatsApp have taken a big 
chunk out of email usage but they won’t 
replace it. Email is an open technology – 
nobody owns it and nobody will suddenly 
start charging you to use it. It’s also great 
for archiving things like receipts, and there 
are no compatibility restrictions.
JavaScript 
I don’t think JavaScript will ever 
come to email, apart from in things 
like Google Actions. Opening up JavaScript 
just leaves too many vulnerabilities. 
 CSS support
Decent CSS support is definitely on 
the cards. Some clients already have 
it, so others could follow. It would be good 
to see more collaboration between email 
clients, perhaps on a shared preprocessor, 
then we could more accurately predict 
what code is supported and what isn’t.

Side project
Tell us a little about Mangomoji… 
It’s an emoji based Spotify-connected search 
where you can find a song based on your emotions. 
Simply combine a maximum of three emojis and a 
song will start playing. 
What’s the inspiration behind Mangomoji?
We all love emojis and we see them being used more 
frequently than ever. Sometimes you might not know 
exactly what you want to listen to, but you know how 
you feel! That’s our inspiration – feelings!  As well  
as knowing that one emoji can say more than a 
thousand words.
Who is this aimed at?
A person who doesn’t care too much about the artist 
or specific lyrics. A person who’s more likely to be 
looking for a specific mood to satisfy. This person is a 
frequent app user and likes to try new stuff and 
explore the www! 
What sort of feedback have you had from users?
We’ve gotten great feedback! People love to be 
interactive, especially when it comes to music. And we 
love how passionate they get when they try the app. 
They come up with new features and really like the 
idea and want us to develop it further! 
Have you experienced any difficulties so far?
It could be difficult to expand our emoji base and 
create even better accuracy. Our goal is that every 
single combination should be SPOT ON. 
How did Mangomoji come about?
We are a group of four people who created this app at 
the Spotify weekend hackathon in Gothenburg, 
Sweden. We are all creative and have decent technical 
experienced. We have a data student, a technical 
designer, a business designer and a full-stack 
developer in the group.  We met randomly at the hack 
and put our heads together and created something we 
think is brilliant… in 48 hours.

Client:  Hi! I’m blown away by your pixel 
art. I have a small project I’d like you to 
help me with. Are you interested?  
Me: Thanks for reaching out! Can you be more 
specific about the scope?
Client: Well it’s one project. I’m sure you’ll find it 
very simple! Basically I want a pixel art portrait 
of me with some speaking animation.
Me: Well, hold on. I’ll draft up an estimate and 
send you a contract that includes timeframe etc. 
Client: Wow, you think it will take a couple of 
hours, huh? I didn’t think it would take that long.  
Me: This is my initial estimate, and I always put 
in a buffer. I’ll only charge you for time worked, 
but I find it’s useful to estimate high. 
Client: I understand you’re over-estimating but I 
can assure you it won’t take that long. So why 
don’t you change the contract to reflect that. 
Me: My estimations come from experience with 
similar projects and this is my professional 
opinion. If my estimation is over the budget, 
then I suggest finding another artist. 
Client: It’s not that I CAN’T pay you. That’s not 
the case AT ALL. Why are you assuming stuff? 
But I honestly do think it’s a bit UNFAIR that you 
would charge that much for such a small project. 
Me: Again, while I appreciate your continued 
interest, I think it best you find another artist. 
Client: Already found one, buddy. All you do is 
PIXEL ART. There are millions of people who can 
do what you do. Don’t think you’re special. Bye.
For the record, I actually do a ton of different 
design work. I have no idea why they thought I 
just did pixel art. I don’t think I’ve had someone 
flip their opinion of my work so quickly.

We asked the @netmag followers 
for their tips on breaking down

COMMUNICATION
Make sure communication is really 
tight: “Designers, go show your 
sketches to the developers,” says 
@netrunnerIT. “Developers, tell 
them what is easy and what is 
hard. It’s easier on the budget.” 
There should be an ongoing 
discussion throughout the project. 
PROCESS
“An integrated process is 
necessary for best results,” says 
@anotheruiguy. “Produce 
collaborative assets that can be 
discussed and have team value.” 
Avoid including features that aren’t 
necessary, advises @_LeonBrown: 
“Conflict never occurs on features 
that don’t exist”. @AshConnnolly 
recommends that you make use of 
a style guide: “Designers and 
developers both working with a 
consistent UI reference leads to a 
better product, better UX and 
cleaner code”.
TOOLS
“As a developer, getting designs 
through @zeplin_io makes things 
a lot easier than getting the raw 
Sketch files,” says @billtechspring. 
@RicusMaximus recommends  
@webflowapp: “It can export

 HOW TO

 PROFILE
Gaelic Football is a team sport played 
throughout the island of Ireland and 
beyond. It is played on a large rectangular field 
where teams of 15 players compete against each 
other. The game is a bit of a cross between soccer 
and Australian rules football, played with a  
round ball and with two ways to achieve scores: 
points and goals.
The sport is strictly amateur and participants 
play for clubs based on where they live. There is a 
real sense of community around the game, with 
strong family connections within each club. Those 
who are good enough will go on to represent their 
county and compete in national competitions.
I’ve been involved with the game from a young 
age and started playing with my local club, 
Clontarf, from the age of six. Based on Dublin’s 
northside, my grandfather helped start the club in 
the sixties and I grew up playing with my siblings 
and friends against different teams throughout 
the county.
As a teenager, I was lucky enough to be picked 
for the Dublin underage teams and I got to play in 
Croke Park a few times, which is Gaelic Football’s 
main stadium. Holding over 80,000, the stadium 
is the jewel in the crown for Gaelic games and 
hosts the national finals every September.
There’s a close connection with Australian rules 
football and I got selected to spend a year in 
Melbourne playing professionally, which was a 
fantastic experience as a young 18 year old. On 
my return, I continued to play Gaelic Football at 
University and for my club.
The game itself can be physical and it requires 
aerobic ability, strength and skill. Training can be 
tough, particularly in the winter months, but there 
is always a great camaraderie with teammates. I 
find it has been a great way to keep fit and see it 
as another creative outlet. It’s also a great way to 
clear the head after a day at the desk. When 
you’re doing sprints in the freezing cold, the last 
thing on your mind is the design critique you had 
earlier that day.
Now in my mid-30s, I’m approaching the end of 
my playing days and I’ll probably look to get 
involved in the coaching side of things. It’s a nice 
way to remain involved in the game and help bring 
along the next generation of players.

Createful as an agency was 
born from opportunity. Back 
in 2010, founder and managing 
director Kriss Bennett spotted an 
opportunity to form a new digital 
creative agency focussed on the 
burgeoning mobile app industry. 
Our first project captured another 
opportunity – a wedding planner 
iPad app where none previously 
existed. Our light and airy 
Bournemouth town centre office 
was yet another opportunity not to 
be missed, and in 2014 we jumped 
at the chance to upscale from our 
previous office, which was based in 
a startup incubator on the campus 
of the local Arts University.
Keeping with the theme of 
opportunity, our comfy sofa (1) 
provides a central breakout area, 
decked out with custom cushions 
(2) picked out by the whole team 
from their favourite themes. We’re 
big fans of classic and modern 
video game consoles (3), but often 
a good old-fashioned game of 
chess is the most effective way of 
clearing your head over lunch (4). 
Our standing desk (5) is an 
opportunity to help promote a 
healthier working environment, 
and there are also gym balls for 
those who prefer to bounce around 
while they work!
We love our ceiling-height 
windows that stretch the full width 
of the office (6). They give us great 
visibility locally, and are perfect 
for a spot of people watching. 
Bournemouth’s seven miles of blue 
flag beaches are only a short walk 
away, so many of us go for a stroll 
or a run during the day. 
We’re passionate about marrying 
elegant and attractive user 
experience with heavyweight 
technical solutions, and we love 
working closely with our clients at 
every point of our mobile and  
web projects. For this reason,  
we’ve covered many of our walls 
with whiteboards (7) and are 
constantly doodling, sketching, 
wireframing and evolving. 
We’ve also got a colouring wall, 
decked out with black-and-white 
wallpaper that we invite all our 
visitors to contribute to.
We’re not just about seizing 
opportunity, though – we also 
offer opportunities to students and 
young people looking to begin a 
career in digital. 
Our internship and placement 
programmes focus on the realistic 
day-to-day skills required in our 
industry, and some of our students’ 
work has ended up being used in 
live client projects.

maintain that shared sense of focus? Here 
are three techniques that I’ve written 
about in my eBook on collaboration at 
collaboratebook.com.
CREATE A SHARED  
VOCABULARY 
Every project participant comes to the 
table (even if it is a virtual one) with a 
different lens; a different perspective on 
a subject, which means they have a 
different language from you. If you’ve 
ever sat at a boardroom table listening to 
a conversation and thought “I don’t 
understand what these people are talking 
about” then you’ve experienced one of 
the main blockers to creating a fruitful 
collaboration, which is not having a 
shared language. 
The more diverse your group members 
are, both culturally, physically, mentally, 
and in terms of their domains of expertise, 
the more potential you have to innovate 
and create something no-one has ever 
seen before. But it requires acknowledging 
that time and effort need to go into the 
language you’re using. 
As part of my work at Clearleft, I 
recently facilitated a workshop with 16 
Artificial Intelligence experts from all 
over the world. In order to create 
divergence in the conversation and reflect 
the diversity in the group, I ran a 
“vocabulary dump”. Every individual took 
15 minutes to write out all the words they 
could think of from their domain on 
sticky notes. We stuck them together 
randomly in a cloud, covering several 
metres of window space. 
We then used our huge vocabulary cloud 
to act as a starting point for discussion; 
allowing people to question what one 
another’s phrases meant, and also pick 
up on nuances in meaning. It was a 
wonderfully collaborative way to spark 
helpful discussion and identify where 
there was convergence and divergence in 
our vocabularies.
ESTABLISH A  
NORTH STAR
A few organisations we work with are now 
using the evocative term “North Star”. 
It’s a short central organising statement 
MAKE A SET OF  
CULTURAL PRINCIPLES
Some organisations like to create sets 
of values, others have rule books, some 
even have manifestos. One set of 
guidelines we’ve enjoyed using is the “It’s 
ok to…” list, inspired by a system used 
by the .gov.uk team (https://gds.blog.gov.
uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/). 
Examples from that list include:
-It’s ok to say ‘I don’t know’
-It’s ok to have a messy desk
-It’s ok to make mistakes
One way to gather these guidelines is 
by asking your team members to 
contribute stories that begin “I liked it 
when…” or “I like the way…” about other 
brands, work experiences, or about your 
working culture. The act of doing this is 
in itself a positive experience that focuses 
the team on the act of collaboration. 
in the form of a proposition or an elevator 
pitch. The act of composing this short 
North Star statement with everyone on 
your project is a surprisingly challenging 
exercise in collaboration, but the major 
benefit of the work is that it draws the 
team together in order to iron out 
inconsistencies in everyone’s perception 
of what they’re doing. It’s not copywriting 
or marketing language, it’s just a plain 
language statement that shows the team 
have consensus around what it is they are 
creating together. 
Try working with your team (whether 
they are near or far) to answer these 
questions about your project:

MANAGING BURNOUT &
GETTING BACK TO WORK
Illustration by Kym Winters
It’s crunchtime. You’re coming in early. Staying 
late. But it’s just until this last deadline. Until we 
deliver this last thing. But looking back, it’s been 
crunchtime for as long as you can remember. There’s 
always one more big project between you and finally 
being able to relax again. What is this high stress, always-
on way of working doing to you? 
Burnout can happen when stress and overwork outpace 
your ability to heal and recuperate. Sufferers report 
difficulty sleeping, emotional and physical exhaustion, 
emotional changes and decreased ability to function in 
both their professional and personal lives. Physical 
symptoms may also include stomach issues, eyestrain 
and persistent headaches. Those impacted often  
report taking months or even years to fully recover. 
While the focus on burnout and its impact on our lives 
may seem new, the concept of occupational burnout dates 
back to the 1970s. 
Unfortunately, the always-on and high demand nature 
of many workplaces in technology places us at a higher 
risk of burning out. So how can we best avoid burning 
out, recover when we are impacted and create healthier 
ways of working overall?
PREVENT BURNOUT
The best way to cope with burnout is to avoid burning 
out in the first place. As the pressures of sustained stress 
and overwork bring burnout, our first line of defence is 
creating a clear separation between work and personal 
lives. Although creating this division can be challenging 
in an industry where email, social media and comms 
tools aim to keep us continually connected to our work. 
For freelancers, this is a matter of pure willpower. 
Begin setting limits on where you work, limiting your 
working activities to your workspace or home office. 
Creating a clear physical space where you work enables 
you to physically leave when you’re done. This should 
help you leave work stresses behind you when you leave 
your workspace. 
Clearly define what counts as work to you. Activities 
like answering emails or chasing invoices are work, but 
often creep into personal time for freelancers. As work 
activities spill into your personal time they bring work 
stress and an increased risk of burnout with them. Once 
you’ve managed to limit all (or more realistically, most) 
of your work activities into a single space, you can work 
to set limits on the amount of time spent on work. 
Remember that longer days don’t result in more or better 
output, with research suggesting that somewhere 
between six and eight hours a day is best for productivity 
and lets you minimise burnout risks.
If you’re not freelance, your ability to create healthy 
working patterns depends on your employer supporting 
and encouraging a non-toxic culture. Your employer’s 
offices can provide a workspace more clearly separate 
from your personal life than a home office, but your 
ability to unplug from work can very much depend on 
employer expectations. 
Setting boundaries like ignoring your emails or 
snoozing Slack can be dangerous in a setting where you’re 
expected to remain connected to your work. Employers 
expecting mandatory overtime or enforcing crunch 
conditions can place you further at risk of burnout. If you 
can’t push back against these expectations to set ways

of working that keep you healthy and productive, looking 
for employers who can help you take care of yourself can 
be a valuable long-term priority. Developing and 
defending healthy working patterns are the key to 
preventing burnout; if your employer isn’t an ally in this 
effort, you may need a better job.
RECOVER FROM BURNOUT
If you can’t prevent burnout, catching it early can help 
you reduce your recovery time. Katie McLaughlin, SRE, 
talks about the ability to “self-identify that I’m feeling 
slightly burnt out, more of a ‘medium rare’” and working 
to adapt her work and life into healthier patterns in 
response. The early stages of burnout can feel like jetlag 
or gentle exhaustion. Many in the ‘medium-rare’ stage 
report being quicker to anger, less patient and having 
trouble getting to sleep at night. 
In the same way that prolonged pressure brings on 
burnout, recovering from early stage burnout requires a 
reduction of pressure and time. Aim to spend less time 
at work, on high pressure tasks and attempt to avoid 
professional conflict while you recover. Look  
critically at your side projects to see which of them may 
be draining you further. As a rule of thumb, try not to 
jump back into the pressures of your life too quickly after 
taking some time out to recover. Taking too little time 
could leave you vulnerable to cooking back up to medium-
rare quickly, while taking extra time to recover is unlikely 
to cause damage.
Catching burnout early is quite difficult, especially for 
those who haven’t been impacted by burnout before. 
Symptoms of more extreme burnout will be more intense. 
Memory issues, insomnia and attention challenges can 
all join and exacerbate the more subtle symptoms of 
early stage burnout. 
People unaware of burnout or too busy to heed  
the warning signs may try to work through burnout, 
stopping only when the symptoms overcome their  
ability to continue. Those suffering from early stage 
burnout can recover by doing less for relatively short 
restorative periods. Recovering from more advanced 
burnout requires stripping your life down to as few 
stressors as possible for stretches that can seem 
impossibly long. 
Docker’s Jérôme Petazzoni took almost two years to 
recognise the increasing impact that burnout was having 
on his work and life. He noticed after a particularly 
stressful period that he was unable to engage in any work 
that required creativity. 
He talks about finding himself “only capable of 
performing what I’d call ‘reactive duties’: I would show 
up in meetings, reply to questions and emails, and I could 
even deliver conference talks when I was familiar enough 
with the content. But my creative process was completely 
stopped.” He’s been carefully working to reduce the 
pressures and may take a long break from work in an 
effort to fully recover. 
To heal from the more advanced stages of burnout 
you’ll need the same time away from the daily pressures 
that less severe burnout requires, just more of it. Taking 
time off work is a critical recovery step for many in the 
critical stages of burnout who are able to afford it. Many 
technologists take months or years off work, some 
returning gradually or in a part-time capacity. 
For those of us unable to take long breaks from work, 
cutting down on hours worked, eliminating side projects 
and reducing the intensity of work duties can be a route 
to relieving some pressure to begin to heal. Dramatically 
cutting down on the hours you work and the pressures 
connected to your workday are vital. 
Trying to work through burnout requires an 
understanding and accommodating working environment 
where your health is being actively supported. The idea 
of switching roles while fried may seem daunting, but 
removing yourself from a toxic workplace or workload 
is an investment in your recovery. Redirecting energy 
away from work and stressors and into calming hobbies 
or activities may help you refocus.
Burnout has been widely studied across the fields of 
psychology, occupational studies and medicine but 
doesn’t exist as a dedicated medical diagnosis. Many 
burnout symptoms overlap with symptoms of depression, 
anxiety disorders or other serious mental or  
physical health concerns. If you have recently been 
impacted by symptoms that sound like those described 
in this article or have had other significant changes  
to your health or mood, please seek advice from a  
medical professional. 
Jessica works to foster more equal access 
to technical education and meaningful work 
in technology. Projects include Open Code 
meetups, Trans*Code and Pursuit Podcast.

For a long time companies forgot to 
think about the needs of their users. 
Companies only focused on their priorities 
and what they wanted to express. That 
changed with user-centred design – people 
started digging into the needs of different 
audiences. But there’s a risk that an 
organisation can lose itself in exclusively 
paying attention to users. Brand and content 
strategist, Margot Bloomstein, is on a mission 
to bring the pendulum back to the middle. 
“If companies within a particular industry 
that speak to the same audience only focus 
on the needs of that audience, it would be a 
yhu|#eodqg#h{shulhqfhĝ/Ĥ#vkh#dujxhv1#ģDluolqhv#
that sell the same product would all look and 
sound the same, and that’s just not right 
because we know that they differ as brands, 
even if they fly the same routes, sometimes 
at the same price point. We know that the 
experiences that JetBlue, Virgin and United 
offer differ wildly, and people have different 
loyalties, proclivities and interests that 
correspond to those brands. I like to work 
with my clients to help them best express 
those differences. If they know who they are, 
then they can better decide what they want 
to communicate and what kind of language, 
content types and platforms are best to 
hqjdjh#wkhlu#dxglhqfhv1Ĥ
Bloomstein, who has worked with clients 
olnh# Wlpehuodqg/# Olqgw/# dqg# Do# Md}hhud#
Dphulfd/#khosv#eudqgv#hqvxuh#wkh#fkrlfhv#
they make are not just right for their audience 
but also right for them as a company; an 
approach she calls brand-appropriate user 
experience. Should a brand be communicating 
in short, truncated sentences, long-form 
copy or in bullet lists, for example? Should 
they be conducting video interviews with 
their stakeholders, or would it be better to 
hear directly from their biggest customers?
The first step, regardless of the client’s 
lqgxvwu|/#vl}h#ru#sureohp#wkh|#duh#wu|lqj#wr#
solve, is always to help them create a message 
architecture. Bloomstein defines this as a 
hierarchy of the communication goals that 
can be used to guide the copy creation as well 
as the visual design. For this purpose she 
tends to facilitate an exercise around 
BrandSort (http://cards.appropriateinc.com), a 
deck of cards that she’s created to help the 
client prioritise and clarify all of those 
important communication goals. 
Bloomstein guides the client through a 
three-step process (first introduced in her 
book, Content Strategy at Work) of sorting 
attribute cards describing who they are, who 
they’d like to be and who they’re not. She 
then analyses which terms are so core and 
important to the brand that they want to 
make sure they hold onto them, while others 
are discarded. 
“Maybe you’ve always been thought of as 
traditional and you realise that’s stodgy and 
boring, but you still want to be seen as 
hvwdeolvkhg/#uhvsrqvleoh#dqg#uholdeoh/ĝĤ#vkh#
explains. “Finally, we figure out the natural 
patterns in those terms and rank them. We 
find out what’s most important to 
communicate – for example, your sense of 
innovation and being a ground-breaking,

Once the message architecture has been 
established, Bloomstein moves into the more 
tactical work. This could be conducting a 
content audit and establishing editorial style 
guidelines. The message architecture is used

to measure the brand’s existing content to 
test it. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve

Bloomstein laughs, “but when I ask them 
what that means and how it differs from how 
they’ve always done things, oftentimes 
people pause and shrug, because who doesn’t 
want to think of their work as modern? We 
have to unpack those terms and go from 
abstract to concrete. The BrandSort tool is a 
way to do that. By the time you get to the 
actual content, whether it’s speccing out 
photography, developing infographics or 
writing copy, it’s real and concrete, and you 
can see how it all goes back to the original 
message architecture. I firmly believe that 
you cannot conduct a content audit that is 
effectively qualitative as well as quantitative 
unless you first understand the message 
dufklwhfwxuh#ri#dq#rujdqlvdwlrq1Ĥ
Bloomstein, who has a background in 
design, first got into the profession when she 
joined a content strategy team at global 
marketing and consulting company, Sapient, 
in 2000. 
Her first client was Lotus, the software 
company that acquired the technology 
behind the first buddy list and instant 
messenger. Bloomstein  
collaborated on the team 
to help figure out how to 
unite two software 
products into a single 
software as a service, 
which included coming 
up with the right tone for 
the branding, major calls 
to action, and taglines on 
the homepage for the new 
product. Content strategy, Bloomstein says, 
gave her the milieu to address some of the 
biggest problems that organisations face. In 
some ways her experience as a content 
strategist has not changed but it has 
substantially evolved.

credibility through choices in content and 
design. She’s also writing a book on how 
organisations and brands establish trust, 
drawing inspiration from the political 
developments in both the 
US and UK.

Patagonia 
commissions a lot of its own content, both

outdoor enthusiasts and athletes who use 
their products sometimes every day, whether 
it’s to scale a mountain or work on a particular 
bouldering problem. RevZilla, meanwhile, 
has an excellent customer service through 
live chat as well as more proactive content 
types such as video reviews of all their new 
products, and the depth that goes into their 
content aligns with their brand and

Bloomstein stresses that longform content 
allows for a slower pace and a slower read, 
which may be a surprising technique to

fast, efficient, easy and orderly. Not all

content can afford readers and customers 
the opportunity to slow down, explore and 
learn on the website in the same way as they 
would in the real world.
There are two major areas of research, as 
Bloomstein points out, that support slow 
content strategy and slower, well-paced user 
experiences: psychology and brick and 
mortar commerce.
“Empiricism teaches us that when people 
have the opportunity to cultivate their 
knowledge of the world through first-hand 
experience, they gain a greater sense of

she argues. “We believe what we see. When 
designers give people the time to slow down, 
dig into the details, and collect more 
information about a camera lens they want 
to buy or candidate they want to support, for 
example, it turns out they feel more confident

Those are slower experiences that pay out in 
dividends, sometimes literally, for the brands 
that encourage them offline, so naturally 
that works pretty well online too. It’s not 
right for every brand and purchase, and if 
someone is interested in a low-price 
purchase, we shouldn’t be putting up 
roadblocks to that. We need to let them hurry 
through. But in other cases, it’s right to help 
people slow down to help support them

media, and politics. “When we look and see 
how they associate text and imagery to allow 
for slower experiences by offering speed 
bumps through either the design, the 
information on the page or the actual content 
of that information, then we can see 
opportunities to help consumers find greater 
courage in their convictions. Sometimes that 
translates to readers having greater faith and 
trust in a particular news outlet, or to people 
returning again and again and again to the 
same retailer, or to people just feeling 
smarter about their choices. When I feel that 
I can see consistency in the content that a 
brand is creating and some transparency and 
insight into their communication goals, then

strategy can help identify and support 
whether the user experience that most fits

that you communicate with your customers 
with consistency and clarity. User needs are 
still important but the brand controls the 
experience, not the other way round.

Q&A
experience matters, too. We recently shipped 
JavaScript Modules support and continue to work on 
improving JS performance so framework code runs as 
fast as it can.
net: Has Chrome released any cool new open-source 
tools recently?
AO: Sure! I’m excited about three open-source tooling 
projects we recently shipped. There’s Lighthouse: a 
web performance and best practice auditing tool. It’s 
useful for learning where you can improve your site. 
Lighthouse powers the new ‘Audits’ panel in Chrome 
DevTools and net’s readers can try it out in Chrome 
stable. Next, there’s Workbox (workboxjs.org), our 
library for offline caching resources. If you have files 
a site needs on repeat visits (eg JavaScript), caching 
improves load performance. Workbox can generate 
Service Workers for you, taking some of the pain 
away from writing them. Companies like Starbucks 
are using Workbox in production.
Finally, we released Puppeteer (github.com/
GoogleChrome/puppeteer), which lets you automate 
headless Chrome: a command-line version of Chrome 
without the overhead of the full browser. Puppeteer 
is useful for generating screenshots of webpages, 
automated testing (eg keyboard input) and for pre-
rendering content. We’re excited to see how these 
projects help developers in practice.
net: When is your YouTube show, Totally Tooling 
Tips (g.co/TotallyToolingTips) returning?
AO: Season 4 just started! Totally Tooling Tips is 
for web developers who build sites and want to 
get more productive. We’ll often hear how hard it 
is to configure Webpack or audit your site for web 
performance issues. Matt Gaunt and I deal with these 
problems every day and share tips on the show to 
save you going through the same pain. I’m surprised 
the show hasn’t been cancelled yet (we’re awful), but 
it’s had over a million views so far. We’re just happy 
to not be writing unit tests with the time, I mean, 
helping. We’re happy to be helping.
net: How do you keep up with all the latest web 
design techniques, tools etc?
AO: I used to carefully curate the RSS feeds I followed 
to stay up to date. That worked a few years ago, but 
I’d miss articles from a lot of great new writers who 
hadn’t gone mainstream yet. I now rely on Nuzzel, an 
app that provides personalised top stories, as well as 
the recommendation engines in Pocket and Medium.
Occasionally, I’ll also read Reddit or Hacker News 
on the odd day when I’m feeling brave. Oh, and I read 
net magazine of course. I get to be on the cover for 
saying that, right? 
ADDY OSMANI
 Q&A 
net: What are the main ways Chrome is trying to 
make developers’ lives easier right now?
AO: We want to help developers ship delightful user 
experiences on desktop and mobile. Sometimes this 
means bringing new capabilities to the browser that 
it hasn’t had before. For example, developers like 
web fonts, but want to avoid the dreaded Flash-of-
unstyled-text (FOUT) we often see on the web. In 
recent versions of Chrome, we’ve given them this 
via the CSS font-display property. font-display:optional 
instructs the browser to say “If this Web Font can’t 
be loaded fast, don’t load it at all. Only show it the 
next time the page is loaded, if it’s cached”. It can 
vastly help improve a user’s experience loading up 
an article page. We’ve had many requests for the 
mobile web to support the same powerful features 
native applications do, too. Over the years, we added 
Push notifications, offline caching and background-
sync to Chrome. New versions support streamlined 
authentication (Credential Management API), photo 
capture controls like zoom (Image Capture API), and 
access to the native share dialog so sites don’t need 
to rely on share buttons (navigator.share()). Developer

One of the tools I use extensively 
throughout the development 
process is Chrome’s Web Inspector. 
It helps me troubleshoot and debug 
on-the-fly. This saves me a lot of 
time. I also do a lot of functional 
tests. Cross-browser testing is the 
most time-consuming part. I try to 
ensure that a website looks and 
performs consistently. For this, I use 
as many real devices as possible; 
otherwise I test in virtual 
environments. I run each website 
through Google’s Lighthouse, which 
provides me with all sorts of useful 
information about the site’s 
performance. The final stage is beta 
testing, where users get to report 
back with their feedback. This is 
where I get the chance to perform 
some final tweaks.

I always test as I go with Chrome. If I come 
across a function or feature I feel could be 
troublesome, I’ll test it with other browsers: IE, 
Firefox, then on some mobile devices as well. I try to 
sort out any issues as soon as I find them, to save 
time later on. Over time you’ll get a good idea of what 
works in a browser, but it helps to keep caniuse.com 
handy for reference. This information is useful when 
deciding what elements to introduce when building a 
page. Also having another set of eyes look over 
everything will help catch things.

A few things to consider include 
device, screen size, browser and 
connection speed. What I generally do 
is test screen size first (resizing 
browser). Then I test on the native 
devices I can (iPhone, two sizes, one 
Android phone, various desktop 
browsers). I’ll use BrowserStack for 
the rest. For other testing, I’ll often 
send the site to friends, and I’ve also 
gone to a local retail store to bring up 
websites on their devices.

Testing is vital to our work at JH, as 
we have a thorough internal sign-off 
process. A client’s priority should be to 
focus on the customer’s experience, and 
not to test. We’re a little biased because 
we created it, but Browsersync is vital. 
One thing we’re known for is great mobile 
experiences, so you’ll often see someone 
connecting multiple devices using 
Browsersync to test. Because the only 
time added with each device is the 
movement of our eyeballs between the 
devices on our desks, we can test our 
front-end code much more effectively.

For me, testing is something that should happen at every stage of the 
design and development process. Sharing work as early and often as 
possible is a great way to ensure you achieve your product goals. I’ll look to 
gather feedback and iterate on content, wireframes, visuals, prototypes and the 
final ready-for-release product to make sure what’s being made is accessible, 
effective and fit for purpose. The feedback can come from people close to the 
design, key stakeholders and SMEs, and external parties too, if it can be shared.

I believe the only reliable test is in 
real conditions. Perceived 
performance, accessibility and general 
usability can only be tested in that way. 
Today, the respect for web standards 
and the progressive enhancing 
approach leave less room for bad 
surprises, so I prefer to focus most of 
my testing efforts on mobile, where 
the diversity of environments is 
greater. If I’m applying new features or 
standards, I test them right away in as 
many browsers and devices I can.

 PROFILE
Neal Thoms examines what the difference is 
between the two and which will work best for you
We’re used to seeing the word ‘cloud’ 
stuck in front of basically every 
technological term out there. And while 
tech-savvy individuals have a decent 
grasp of what ‘the cloud’ is, the same can’t 
be said for all its potential applications.
Cloud hosting, for example, is not 
simply shared hosting with a cloud badge 
stuck on the front of it. Cloud hosting is 
in a league of its own when compared to 
more traditional forms of shared hosting, 
and offers many unique advantages that 
qualify its existence. This article will 
explore these differences.
The critical differentiator of cloud 
hosting is that it draws computing power 
from a pool of dynamically allocated 
resources across a large network of physical 
components, not a fixed set of hardware. 
Shared hosting, on the other hand, is a 
web hosting solution where each customer 
receives a portion of server hardware to 
run their website or application. Shared 
hosting is often the most economical way 
to get online, because the service provider 
houses multiple customers on a single web 
server, resulting in lower costs overall.
While shared hosting can be perfect as a 
cost-effective platform for less demanding 
projects, it has its limits. With several 
customers sharing one set of physical 
hardware, individual users can’t rely on 
a guaranteed level of server performance. 
This might not be an issue for sites and 
applications with minimal requirements 
or low visitor numbers, but when it comes 
to running intensive, business-critical 
processes, many users find that shared 
hosting isn’t up to snuff.
The 
reason 
shared 
hosting 
isn’t 
suitable for intensive applications? In a 
word: contention. The full power of the 
hardware will always be pulled in several 
directions at once, with different websites 
and applications in constant competition 
for processing power.
Imagine one customer on a shared 
platform gets a sudden spike in traffic. 
Luckily, other websites on the same 
server are quiet, so some resources can be 
allocated to cope with the extra visitors. 
But what happens when several websites 
are popular at once? The server only has 
a finite amount of resources to parcel out, 
so intensive applications will regularly 
struggle to get what they need. The end 
result is inconsistent performance, slow 
loading times and a shoddy experience for 
the end-user. If your website is a major 
source of leads or sales, this presents a 
serious shortcoming.
Even with high contention, shared 
hosting can still use sophisticated tech to 
provide decent performance, at least for 
sites with low or medium requirements. 
But the fact remains: demanding sites will 
never get predictable, consistently high 
performance on anything other than a 
dedicated platform.
One major misconception of cloud 
hosting is that it doesn’t offer any 
significant 
performance 
boost.  
This couldn’t be further from the 
truth. With cloud hosting, every single 
resource you configure is dedicated to you  
alone. Processors, RAM and SSD storage 
provide guaranteed performance on cloud 
hosting, exactly the same way they do on 
complete servers. 
Like a shared platform, everything can 
be managed from one central control 
panel, but with the flexibility to also 
manage files via SFTP, install and update 
apps, manage databases and DNS, and 
manipulate source code. 
But of course, as mentioned before, 
the biggest difference is that unlike 
shared hosting, cloud hosting offers fully 
dedicated resources that can be scaled on 
demand for guaranteed performance. A 
kind of ‘dedicated hosting’ option for users 
who want the increased power of their own 
server, but don’t want to deal with server 
management. Hopefully this exploration 
of ‘cloud hosting vs shared hosting’ has 
cleared up some misconceptions!

The design of business
audience passionate about sport, benefitted by 
aligning with a new device that was perfect for 
tracking fitness.
You don’t need to be a multinational business to 
build a successful partnership, however. With a little 
imagination even the smallest of businesses can 
develop a partnership that pays dividends. 
CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS
Partnerships can be an opportunity to tell a 
captivating story, where both partners win. When 
Andy McMillan launched Build – a design festival 
for web designers that ran for five years in Belfast – 
he considered his partnerships as opportunities to 
create something memorable. Sponsors can make or 
break a conference, but sponsors can offer more than 
just money and McMillan seized the opportunity to 
explore his partnership’s potential.
At the second edition of Build, McMillan partnered 
with Campaign Monitor, an email marketing 
company, to create Caffeine Monitor (http://
gofreerange.com/building-caffeine-monitor), “an 
application built to track and display a real time 
visualisation of caffeine consumption during the 
conference.” It was a lovely idea and proved far more 
effective than simply acknowledging Campaign 
Monitor’s support with a brand liberally applied to 
the conference materials. The application, featuring 
data visualisations by Nicholas Felton and designed 
and built by Jason Cale, was a hit. Attendees loved 
the idea and coffee consumption, naturally, became 
the focus of attention. Build won, Campaign Monitor 
won, and everyone was happy.
The key to building a successful partnership is to 
identify businesses that echo your vision. Building 
something together affords an opportunity to 
reach a larger audience by aligning two, or more, 
brands. You’ll give your business a welcome boost by 
establishing partnerships and, especially if you’re in 
a team of one, you’ll enjoy working with other, like-
minded individuals. 
PARTNERS
Running a business can be a lonely affair, 
especially if you’re in a team of one. In this 
month’s article I’ll explore the role that partnerships 
can play, helping you to deliver added brand value 
and, as a result, maximise awareness and drive sales.
Working with other like-minded businesses has 
the potential to widen your reach and, even better, 
deliver a win-win for both parties. The key lies in 
finding partners that share your brand values.
Look closely and you’ll see strategic partnerships 
in play throughout business. Partnerships are 
an incredibly effective strategy when it comes to 
marketing and storytelling. Why? Because the 
partners add up to more than the sum of the parts. 
When Apple launched the Apple Watch, for example, 
it positioned it not just as a wearable computer, but 
also as a luxury fashion item and a sports accessory. 
Partnering with Hermès (tapping into the storied 
world of luxury goods) and Nike (tapping into the 
focused world of fitness) was an inspired decision.
These partnerships ensured that the Apple 
Watch enjoyed the benefits of three companies, not 
just one, helping to promote the product when it 
launched. Hermès, a business with a long history, 
benefited by aligning with a business at the bleeding 
edge of technology. Nike, a business with a loyal

FINANCIAL TIMES
https://ig.ft.com/uber-game
Uber has been in the news for a 
variety of reasons this year, but I 
love this site by the Financial Times as it 
focuses on one aspect of Uber that I 
don’t think has been discussed enough. 
The reality of so many of the big digital 
success stories is that they are built on 
the back of cheap labour. While digital 
companies are valued in the billions and 
their pampered employees have 
stunning offices and always-on food, the 
reality of the life of the people delivering 
the services are very different. 
The deceptively simple gameplay 
and abstract graphic style doesn’t 
prevent this game from packing a real 
emotional punch. It shows the difficult 
choices faced by drivers and the knife-
edge they need to walk every day. The 
game is based on hundreds of hours of 
interviews with real Uber drivers and is a 
companion piece to an FT article on the 
gig economy. It’s a fresh way of telling a 
story and a very exciting direction from 
the FT, who designed and produced the 
game in-house.

ELLEVEST
https://www.ellevest.com
Ellevest is an investment platform set up by Sallie Krawcheck, described 
by Fortune Magazine as the “last honest analyst”. At its heart is an 
algorithm designed for women’s needs – longer lifespans, career breaks for 
family, and different investing style. Surprisingly, nobody had done this before. 
Using a simple mint colour palette and a sophisticated yet readable selection 
of fonts, Ellevest brings clarity to the confusing business of investing with a 
step-by-step guide, focusing on the aim of the investment. The initial screen 
sets the tone, then the process is chunked into an easily digested sequence – 
it’s like having an experienced advisor next to you. It’s possible to get up and 
running in about 15 minutes, but there are also many customisation options to 
explore that help you narrow your choices to a detailed and personalised plan. 
The graphic treatment of the graphs and investment targets brings a 
refreshing clarity to the often overwhelming layout and clutter of financial 
graphs. This clarity carries through to the copy – it’s well written and simple, 
without being patronising, with a light human touch. I have to make a 
confession here – as it’s an American site, I saw all this by sitting with a friend 
as she got set up – I’m not a customer myself but if Ellevest comes here (and if 
I have enough spare cash to invest) then sign me up!

SHEHZIL
http://www.shehzil.com 
I was honoured to be invited to speak recently at the first-

time and was blown away by the quality of the work and the 
speakers, but one person stood out to me – Shehzil Malik.
Shehzil is an unstoppable creative force. She has worked in 
advertising, was an art director, a designer, illustrator, street 
artist and her first fashion collection is about to be launched.  
Her work has a strongly feminist angle and she focuses on 
working for social change.
The culture of Pakistan is a clear influence on her work, using 
traditional script and imagery based on the plants and flowers 
she saw when spending a month among the women of the 
Hunza Valley, and this helps her capture the reality of being a 
young woman in Pakistan. 
Her work is incredibly detailed and on close viewing more 
messages and images distinguish themselves from the riot of 
colour and expression. Her most moving works are a series called 
It’s Not OK, inspired by the renewed security crisis in Pakistan, 
where simply going out and listening to music becomes seen as 
“an act of defiance”.

I know Paper has been out for a wee

team at The Telegraph worked on an

amazing product (I didn’t work on it so 
I’m allowed to say that!)
I can see so many things we learned 
that are in play here. The minimal editing 
interface that gives a real sense of calm, 
the way the document handles anything 
you can throw at it – code snippets, 
images emojis etc – intuitively and 
elegantly, the ability to embed whatever 
you need and the great sharing tools.
Dropbox Paper tops that off with loads 
of great integrations and smart features 
that should see it become a serious rival 
to Google Docs – but I suspect it won’t. 
Google has scale and is so embedded in 
so many organisations I’m not sure even 
something as great as Dropbox Paper will 
pry the company out. 
Nevertheless, Paper has a really  
stylish, clean user interface and has 
clearly done a lot of work to make the

tell this is the result of a great team

KILLING OF A SACRED DEER
http://killingofasacreddeer.movie
I’ve been a huge fan of film websites like this since I saw two 
early pieces of work by Hi-ReS – one a site for Requiem for a 
Dream that managed to evoke the queasy, hallucinatory dread of 
the film while giving away nothing of the plot, and its piece for 
Donnie Darko that was just mind-blowing at the time. Both are 
still on the Hi-ReS archive at http://archive.hi-res.net if you want 
to check them out…
This is another film website classic. I hate film trailers as they 
give too much away, but by spending time on a site like this you 
get a sense of the aesthetic and the atmosphere of a film, and 
often the experience of a film website enhances the film in a 
way a trailer simply doesn’t.
I love the style of this site. It looks like a beautiful old medical 
text book, and this is reflected in the choices of fonts and 
colours. The illustrations are stunning, incredibly detailed, 
and render superbly. The site is fully responsive and works 
brilliantly on a mobile. It has beautiful and subtle interactions, 
such as the flayed man looking down at your thumb as you 
choose where the pain is. A small, subtle site that has whetted 
my appetite for the film.

VISA DESIGN SYSTEM
https://design.visa.com/design-systems.html
At MOO (along with many other companies) we have a design system 
and associated ways of working that we are continually building on. 
We have been discussing about how, and when, we might make this work 
public so I was really excited to see this website from Visa.
I’m excited because even a few years ago nobody would have expected 
a financial services firm to be leading the way like this, and to be doing 
it partially in the open. I know it’s mostly a recruitment site, but it’s a 
statement of intent, too.
On this website Visa says: “When we set out to create a new design 
system, our goal was to unify our products and services. The system had to 
be many things to many people. It had to be fast, smart and reliable. It also 
had to be authentic and iconic to resonate with our global consumer and 
enterprise audiences, across any device or platform. No small task.”
No small task indeed. I know when I’ve worked on vastly smaller projects 
the design inconsistencies reflect the internal structure of a company, and 
much of the design work is done behind the scenes in reconciling different 
aspects of a business, different processes and systems.
I’m awestruck at what Visa has achieved. A cohesive, global design system 
that the company has supported and is now publicly shouting about – having 
design supported inside Visa like this is going to have a great effect on the 
business, not just on brand perceptions but in streamlining how the business 
works. It’s a game changer. I hope this will make more people realise that 
design is not about pretty pictures but about creating change.

THE CAPITAL
Fun photography and a script font are used to convey the casual atmosphere at this space
The Capital is an inviting coworking space 
for creatives who want to get work done in 
a casual environment. The design reflects the 
sleek interior via photography throughout the 
page but is offset by a ‘no stodginess’ 
atmosphere with the use of a handwritten 
typeface, personable photos, artistic textures, 
and a bit of tongue-in-cheek copy. 
The use of colour is kept to a minimum 
with a bold blue, so the visitor is drawn to the 
photography rather than any design aesthetics 
- it’s all about the space! Overall, I wanted 
the tone of The Capital to feel authentic, and 
hopefully that comes across.
In doing so, the goal of The Capital is to 
attract other like-minded creatives who are 
also looking for a casual work environment 
where they can bring their pet dog, display 
their favourite classic comic book figurines with 
pride, and work within a community of inspired 
business owners.
 CLOSE UP
(1) A clean, simple navigation to the main sections of 
the website alongside standard social media links. The 
contact link is highlighted to garner better attention 
from every visitor. (2) An artistic ‘paint’ effect is used on 
the interior shots to give them a little more depth and 
interest, and to create an atmosphere of being a little 
‘rough around the edges’. This is a casual creative space 
and that element needs to come across. (3) Amenities 
are highlighted visually with simple icons and the use of 
the bold blue colouring, enabling visitors to quickly and 
effortlessly scan those crucial features. (4) Although 
most of the photography on the page highlights the 
interior space available, the content is broken up here 
with a personable image alongside a little dose of 
humour. The idea is to give a sense of the space, but also 
of the community within it. (5) The available membership 
plans are laid out clearly with the price and immediate 
sign-up option. (6) Additional photography is brought in 
via Instagram.

RABBLE STUDIO
A bold, black-and-white design for a Cardiff-based space
Rabble Studio is a coworking space located 
within the thriving creative community of 
Cardiff Bay. It is a working base for a mix of 
creative professionals enabling them to work, 
collaborate and hang out.
It was important to implement a modern, 
on-trend design and make full use of the studio 
photography to give a feel of the space and its 
environment. I selected the sturdy and legible 
sans serif typeface, Museo Sans, using its thick 
bold weight for impactful headings.
I chose a black-and-white colour scheme 
to complement the brand logo and enable the 
photography to stand out, giving a colourful 
vision into the workspace. The design layout 
brings together squared panels, which creatively 
overlap and extend beyond the grid. The panels 
are also designed to appear from various sides 
of the screen as the user scrolls down, which is 
achieved using animate.css effects.
 CLOSE UP
(1) The overlapping menu is designed to follow the user 
as they scroll through the website, enabling them to 
click onto other pages easily. (2) As the space is located 
in the capital of Wales, the website can be switched to 
read in Welsh. (3) The top section of the website ‘above 
the fold’ instantly gives users a sense of the studio 
culture, with a collection of transitioning background 
photography. (4) This panel shows a featured blog post 
highlighting the benefits of joining a coworking space. 
Staff are able to change what article is displayed here 
using the CMS. (5) This second feature panel shows 
the next event or workshop being held. By clicking the 
up/down arrows, visitors can click through the list of 
upcoming events without the page reloading. (6) Prices 
are displayed card style, which means the user can 
easily compare the different types of memberships 
available. On mobile, the left/right arrows enable the 
user to click through the cards.

GROUND FLOOR
A logo that reflects the steps of the development of a creative idea
Ground Floor is a hub for entrepreneurs 
that provides a community and 
collaborative environment for individuals or 
small groups looking for a place to work. The 
name ‘Ground Floor’ alludes to the concept that 
someone can come and build their idea from the 
ground up. Located in Madison, Wisconsin, on 
the historical capital square, Ground Floor 
provides a central site for creatives located in 
South Central Wisconsin. With ample nearby 
parking, countless eateries and shops, members 
can take breaks for inspiration just by stepping 
out the door. The interior itself features warm 
textures and colour schemes, and a variety of 
seating areas appealing to all ages. Taking 
advantage of the repurposed architecture, large 
windows and high ceilings keep an open 
environment physically and psychologically. 
The website plays off these features, with white 
space and imagery to match.
 CLOSE UP
(1) The block motif is reflecting the stacked form of 
the Ground Floor logo mark. The logo itself is relying 
on the user’s imagination to visualise steps, taking 
them from the beginning of their idea to the next level 
and bringing it to reality. (2) A large hero image places 
the user directly in the space, helping them picture 
themselves working there. The design of the space is 
the main thing that will sell it to potential members, 
so it is important that this is placed front and centre 
on the site. (3) The site design only uses lowercase 
letterforms to give an inviting and friendly appearance. 
The conversational tone also helps put the user at ease 
about joining the collaborative community. (4) The 
underline symbol used on the button links is a playful 
suggestion of the actual ground. (5) The main points 
of interest are easily recognised on the homepage, and 
help to quickly direct the user exactly to where they 
may need to go.

GEORGE HASTINGS

SurĽoh
New York-based designer and 
developer, George Hastings, came to 
our attention recently as the creator of 
Khroma (khroma.co), a cool online AI tool 
built to help designers find the perfect 
colour combinations to use in their work. 
He’s currently employed as a senior 
interaction designer by IDEO (www.ideo.
com), where he recently worked on a 
platform enabling New Yorkers to 
understand the risks of flooding and to be 
prepared to deal with it in future. We 
caught up with George to find out more 
about his work, his career and his life away 
from the desktop, and, of course, to learn 
more about his amazing machine-learning 
colour tool. Here’s what he had to say…
Hi George, tell us a bit about yourself…
I’m 30 years old and live in Brooklyn, New 
York, where I’ve been in the design 
industry for six years. I’ve worked across 
over a dozen industries, shipped dozens of 
websites, and designed and launched a few 
products myself. I saw on Twitter someone 
use the word ‘devsignloper’ and I think I 
identify with that. 
How did you get into the web business?
As a young child I attended a Montessori 
school in the suburbs of Philadelphia, 
which I believe taught me initiative, 
collaboration, and independence. That’s 
pretty much how I’d describe my creative 
style today. I got my degree in marketing

It’s not all about building websites; George built this striking desk himself using 100-year-old  
salvaged black walnut
Like most of George’s projects, the idea to build 
Khroma came from a desire to learn a skill and also 
fix a problem he encountered 
encountered yesterday, pick a new 
technology (AR/VR, AI, Internet of things, 
etc…), and come up with solutions around 
those constraints. That’s sort of the case 
with Khroma.
For some reason, I’m drawn to creating 
things that surprise me. A year and a half 
ago I was creating a lot of little 
experiments, one of which was a poker 
‘AI’. The problem was that it wasn’t really 
an AI, I hard coded all of the behavioural 
logic. It still acted unexpectedly due to 
some built-in randomness, but I wasn’t 
satisfied. That’s when I discovered 
machine learning – specifically a JavaScript 
library called synaptic.js by Juan Cazala. 
Once I understood it I thought, “What 
should I make with this?” As a designer, I 
thought pretty quickly of something that 
uses a lot of numbers, but is more theory 
than maths – colours.
Finding colour palettes for my designs 
always felt slow and unintuitive for me. It 
was hard to bring a certain rigor to it. So I 
wondered: why painstakingly craft colour 
palettes by hand when I can train an AI to 
do it for me?
I probably spent 100 plus hours of my 
free time over the span of nine months 
building Khroma. The very first prototype 
was in code and that’s primarily how I 
designed it. By designing in the browser I 
could immediately test, click and use it, 
which I think helped me make better 
and studio art in the States but discovered 
UX design at Hyper Island in Stockholm, 
Sweden. There was something very 
satisfying to me about the combination of 
business logic, rationale, and user 
centeredness in the UX field. I also fell in 
love with the web. To me it was the 
ultimate creative medium – the perfect 
confluence of art, design, 
entrepreneurship, and technology. 
Something definitely clicked, and I think 
this came across during my internship 
with AREA 17, where I got my first job in 
the business. 
You’re currently working at IDEO; what 
do you do there?
I’m a senior interaction designer at IDEO. 
My work here ranges from infusing Design 
Thinking practices into organisations, to 
envisioning new ventures, to creating 
detailed, responsive style guides for to-
market website builds. The diversity of 
briefs and industries is exciting and really 
stretches me as a designer. One thing that 
doesn’t change is starting the process with 
people, users, and customers – something 
that definitely resonates with me as a UX 
designer at heart. 
Can you tell us what you’re working on at 
the moment?
I just finished up a project in the 401k 
space. I can’t say much else!
You built an AI colour tool for designers, 
how did that come about?
Khroma was a classic case of taking a pain-
point and combining it with a new 
technology. We did this exercise a lot at 
Hyper Island: Take a problem you 
decisions quicker. I could also get fast 
feedback by trying it out with co-workers 
and friends (some of whom generously 
voted on 800 colours in the early days). I 
was simultaneously iterating on the 
product features, design, build, and 
machine-learning algorithms. At times it 
was pretty tough to manage everything, 
but every little bit of progress I made felt 
like a big accomplishment.
After a while, my friends started to think 
I would never launch it. “When is Khroma 
coming out?” they would ask. “Next 
week,” I would say. Then it wouldn’t. I 
didn’t realise how much work it takes to go 
from a tool that works for me to a product 
that works for everyone. So, I was very 
pleased when I could finally release it. I’ve 
been so pleased by its reception and had a 
lot of fun making it. 
What tools do you prefer to work with?
For design, I use Sketch. It seems to be the 
standard these days. I haven’t yet felt the 
need for collaborative features like those 
offered in Figma, but I like the concept. For 
development, I use Atom – primarily 
because it’s the most aesthetically 
pleasing. That seems trivial to 
development but hey, I’m a designer. 
I also use a tool called CodeKit, which 
takes the pain out of terminal compilers 
for Sass and ES6 JS, JSX, and so on. It has a 
lot of other handy features as well – I think

 SPOTLIGHT
A Gerritsen Beach resident helps George prototype 
the FloodHelpNY platform
Here are some of the final designs for the 
FloodHelpNY scheme 
of it as being like a Swiss Army Knife for 
the lone developer. 
I’ve also made some of my own tools in 
the form of small JS libraries. Using code to 
solve my own problems is very satisfying. 
I’m working on cleaning some of them up 
to open source. 
Can you talk us through your work on 
FloodHelpNY?
FloodHelpNY is a platform we designed 
with the Center for New York City 
Neighborhoods, with funding from the 
Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery, 
which helps New Yorkers understand their 
flood risk and take action to protect their 
homes and finances. The brief was to co-
design the evolution of the platform 
together, making it the most openly 
defined to-market project I’ve worked on.
The site needed to serve a diverse 
audience of people – those who already felt 
the devastating effects of Superstorm 
Sandy, others who were confused about 
the flood insurance programme, and still 
others who were unaware their homes 
were affected by shifting flood zone policy. 
Making sure everyone got the right 
message and relevant information to 
whichever situation they were in was 
tough. Our solution centred around using 
clear language to demystify the complex 
minutia of flood preparedness and help 
people find the most relevant and 
actionable information as quickly as 
possible. Flooding is scary, but we wanted 
to make people feel empowered to be 
resilient, not frightened. We also had the 
opportunity to funnel people in eligible 
neighbourhoods into a programme that 
gave them a free home audit, which has 
been quite successful. 
Whose work do you find inspiring?
I’ve always been a huge fan of the Codrops 
team. They’re always coming out with 
cutting edge UI demos that are super 
polished (and have great colour palettes). I 
also love their collective newsletter, in 
which I’ve been lucky enough to be 
featured a couple of times. I’m also blown 
away by some of the advancements going 
on in machine learning, specifically the 
agentive work at OpenAI and the 
generative models by Mario Klingemann.
You made your own app, Rome, to help 
you quit smoking. How does it work?
Rome works as a support tool for people 
who want to change or pick up a new 
behaviour. If there’s a strong will, Rome 
can reinforce it. The object is to build a city 
by collecting and spending coins, which 
can be earned in two ways. By visiting the 
site, you are given coins for the amount of 
days since you started or abstained from 
the behaviour. As well as being given 
coins, you can also reward yourself with a 
What’s on your  
desktop today? 
Like most days it’s a cosy pile of 
windows from Atom, CodeKit, Hyper, 
Sketch, Chrome, and Spotify. 
Little things that make your 
life worthwhile… 
Websites:
CodePen is the front-end playground for 
my tinkerings.
Twitter/Designer News/Hacker News is 
where all my news and inspiration 
comes from.
I don’t know what I’d do without 
Wikipedia.
Apps:
The New York Times Crossword app 
helps to take the edge off my subway 
commute. 
I’ve also been really hooked on a new 
live gameshow app called HQ.
I check on my cryptocurrencies, too, 
often in Coinbase.
Audio: 
My music taste is very eclectic. I’m big 
on 80’s, jazz, bossa nova, Nu-disco and 
house, and lately classical. I listened to 
almost exclusively classical while 
building Khroma.
As far as podcasts, I’m a huge Stuff you 
Should Know fan. It’s like the audio 
version of Wikipedia but with two great 
personalities. I also dig Planet Money, 
Startup, and How I Built This.

coin if you feel like you’ve done something 
to deserve one. 
As of this writing, I had my last cigarette 
180 days ago. Using Rome helped me get 
through the first week – which was by far 
the most difficult one. It became 
something I could fixate on; a tangible 
representation of a good thing I was 
(actually) building. Due to the reward 
mechanism, the city was slow going in the 
beginning. Eager to see it grow, I was using 
it every day and giving myself rewards for 
getting through tough withdrawal periods. 
I think the day count is something that 
sticks with me the most, it’s a number I 
want to see keep going up!
Are there any web technologies you feel 
you really need to learn?
I’m an avid cryptocurrency guy, so I would 
definitely say blockchain. I don’t think I’ll 
ever want to be developing in Solidity 
myself but I definitely want to get closer to 
the technology conceptually. I’m really 
excited by the innovative applications in 
healthcare, data-storage, commerce etc. 
There are opportunities for design, too. 
EON is an old-school text-based role-
playing game; how did you make it?
EON is an artefact of teaching myself 
JavaScript. My advice to people who want 
to learn how to code is to take something 
you’re passionate about (in my case video 
games), and think of something you want 
to build. The next and last step is to figure 
it out. Once you learn how to ask the right 
questions, you can find all the answers. 
What do you do in your spare time?
If I’m not working on something (which I 
often am), I’m probably having drinks with 
friends, playing Hearthstone, or spending 
quality time with my fiancé. 
What advice would you give to people just 
starting out on the web?
Be fiercely curious, and feed that curiosity 
religiously. All of the answers are already 
out there, you just have to find them. 
What’s the best thing about your job?
I get to use my passion to help solve 
problems that make a difference in 
people’s lives. I think that’s pretty cool.

Where is William Truthsbury? The team from Kota Creative  
explain how they built a good old-fashioned whodunit  
for a venerable perfumer
PENHALIGON’S
MYSTERY MANSION
 HOW WE BUILT
(1) The splash screen to the experience. The 
brand had to be instantly recognisable here 
as well as entice the user to play.
(2) The intro. It was important to explain the 
sequence of events that lead up to William’s 
disappearance, so the team created a 
vintage-book styled intro. The user can also 
interact to read more about each suspect.
(3) The main interactive scene. Here the user 
is prompted with riddles, which act as clues 
to know where to click within the mansion.
(4) Clue and promo screen. When the user 
clicks on the right object, they find a clue card 
hinting at the culprit along with a special offer 
allowing for data capture.
(5) Experience completed screen. Appears 
once you have successfully found all the clues 
and the whereabouts of William. 
 BRIEF
London perfumer, Penhaligon’s, needed a 
shareable, cross-platform interactive marketing 
tool that would advertise the company’s new 
Portraits product range, while introducing the 
new characters created to promote it.
CLOSE UP 

How we built
 january 2018    57
Established in London back 
in the days of Queen Victoria, 
Penhaligon’s (www.penhaligons.com) 
is a perfumer with a long and proud 
heritage, not to mention two coveted 
Royal Warrants. It creates unique 
fragrances, blending the highest quality 
natural ingredients and using the latest 
technologies in fragrance chemistry, all 
the while remaining true to its roots – 
the company still consults its founder’s 
original recipe books, and retains the 
original bottle design used when it was 
supplying perfume to Queen Victoria.
Penhaligon’s 147-year heritage 
continues to inspire its marketing and 
branding, and a strong vintage look 
was key to its latest campaign – a fun 
murder mystery making full use of the 
brand’s roster of quirky characters. 
To create Penhaligon’s Mystery 
Mansion (mysterymansion.penhaligons.
com), the company brought in regular 
collaborators, Kota Creative (www.
kotacreative.co.uk). We spoke to them to 
get the story behind the site. 
Tell us a bit about Penhaligon’s…
JP: Penhaligon’s is a British perfume 
house. It was founded in the late 1860s 
by William Henry Penhaligon, a Cornish 
barber who moved to London and who 
became court barber and perfumer to 
Queen Victoria. 
What’s the thinking behind the 
Mystery Mansion?
JP: We needed to come up with an 
interactive marketing tool that engaged 
the users while promoting Penhaligon’s 
new characters, which represent their 
Portraits product range. It needed to be 
fun, to be shareable, and to work across 
all platforms. 
As Kristjana had already created the 
mansion illustration for Penhaligon’s 
packaging, the murder mystery concept 
came pretty easily. We then adapted it 
to just be a kidnapping so we could use 
William again in the future.
How did Kota get involved with the 
project?
JP: We’ve been working with 
Penhaligon’s alongside their marketing 
team for the past three years, providing 
them with fun, immersive digital 
experiences. Last Valentine’s we created 
‘Language of Flowers’ – a microsite

 EVOLUTION
(1) The first design concepts were very dark until we 
developed it further with Kristjana’s artwork. We found a 
light colour scheme worked better. (2) This was the 
template we provided to Kristjana to create the forest 
scene around. The file was over 17,000 pixels wide! (3) 
Extensive whiteboarding and multiple wireframes were 
made before we started this project. One of the original 
ideas was to have an RPG inventory system where you 
could choose which items you used on the objects in the 
rooms, but we decided the experience would have taken 
too long. (4) When developing the story we had to make a 
character that would fit into the Penhaligon’s world and 
William Truthsbury went through many iterations before 
we got him spot on. (5) One of the preliminary designs 
for a room before we used Kristjana’s illustrations.

was created with WebGL using three.js; 
SVG was used to create some of the flat 
images (the logo, textures and masks); 
and the animation was handled by GSAP. 
The content is pretty static so nearly 
all of it is just written in the HTML 
document, with the exception being the 
riddle answers – they live in a JavaScript 
array of objects. All in all, it is a bunch 
of very simple techniques overlaid on 
top of each other that ended up giving a 
complex feel to the end result.
What feature of the site are you 
proudest of?
PT: One of GSAP’s plugins is Draggable, 
which as the name implies, allows you 
to drag any DOM element. It also lets 
you define the limiting bounds and even 
gives you the option to use momentum-
based movement. 
We created a dummy DOM element on 
top of the WebGL canvas that the user 
can drag around. As the user is moving 
this dummy, we read the direction 
and speed of it and pass those into 
the camera in three.js. When the user 
releases the dummy, it snaps back into its 
original position but the three.js camera 
continues its movement until it comes 
to a rest or the user starts dragging the 
dummy again.
How did you ensure cross-platform 
performance?
PT: We were in a very quick turnaround 
schedule so there wasn’t actually much 
time for testing any bleeding edge 
technology. To make sure the site worked 
in as many devices as possible with the 
minimal use of polyfills, we focused 
on older, more established techniques. 
Sometimes, using yesterday’s 
technologies is the safe route.
Talk us through your testing process; 
did it uncover any major problems that 
needed changing?
PT: We do incremental testing – each 
significant stage of development is 
completed with a round of tests using the 
browser’s development tools… Chrome, 
Firefox, Safari… then at milestones, 
we do a round with as many different 
physical devices as we have available. 
When we get to the final stage, we do 
informal user sessions with one another 
at the agency, as well as with friends and 
relatives, then finally we use an external 
testing service.
Did you learn any useful lessons during 
this build?
PT: Oh yes. A browser in a particular 
operating system might not behave in 
the same manner in another operating 
system. We were tasked to build this 
experience with offline capabilities 
because the client was going to make 
the experience available in their stores, 
but connectivity was not guaranteed. We 
were super excited with that and started 
development with the whole PWA idea 
behind it. 
Everything was working great in 
Chrome. We were aware that Safari 
isn’t supporting most of the PWAs 
championed by Google but what we did 
not know was that Chrome in iOS is as 
limited as Safari in that aspect. That 
caused a last-minute scramble to make 
sure it would also work offline in Safari.
What’s the response been like?
JP: The response has been overwhelming 
on social media with over 20,000 unique 
hits and 6,000 new signups over three 
months. We also have a happy client and 
a great piece of work for our portfolio.

these disparate elements converge, 
in order to provide a more intuitive 
experience for the end user. 
Zero UI introduces us to a new world 
where our natural gestures, voice, glances 
and even our thoughts can be used to 
communicate with our devices in a 
seamless, non-intrusive way – leading us 
towards a user experience that makes us 
feel like we’re communicating not with a 
machine, but rather with another person.
The aim of invisible interfaces is 
to help facilitate a world wherein our 
devices find the balance between 
presence and discretion; always being 
peripherally present and ready to accept 
user input, while never distracting or 
demanding our attention. 
The key change to designing for this 
will be in anticipatory design, the process 
in which a designer - with the help of 
artificial intelligence – anticipates the 
needs and tasks of the user by making 
pre-emptive decisions on their behalf, 
in order to simplify the user journey and 
reduce cognitive load. 
Here, we’ll take a look at the main 
areas that invisible interfaces are poised 
to revolutionise the way we interact 
with our devices, as well as where the 
transition to invisible interfaces could 
take the field of UX design in future.
Conversational interfaces – 
designing for voice 
The most popular invisible interface 
by far is that of voice, with recent 
investment in this area from tech titans 
Apple, Amazon and Google having 
thrust this technology firmly into the 
mainstream. This burgeoning market for 
voice control creates an intriguing new 
challenge for UX designers everywhere. 
In fact, some are already hailing the 
sector as the natural next step forward in 
UX design. 
Celebrated design guru Donald Norman 
put it best in 1990 when he said: “The 
real problem with the interface is that it 
is an interface. Interfaces get in the way. 
I don’t want to focus my energies on an 
interface. I want to focus on the job… I 
don’t want to think of myself as using a 
computer, I want to think of myself as 
doing my job.”
That’s the key. We are moving 
towards a future without any traditional 
interface, where we move away from the 
touchscreen – or any screen at all, in fact. 
As our world fills with more and more 
interconnected devices, so too will 
our day-to-day lives. Because of this, 
the interfaces we use will naturally 
need to develop along with this – 
interfaces which are not fragmented and 
distracting, but rather those that are 
designed to be effective, seamless and 
most importantly of all… invisible. 
The question is how do we make 
interfaces invisible and also begin to 
move beyond the screen? There is no 
doubt that the smartphone is a wondrous 
invention, which has revolutionised the 
way we socialise, work, and live. 
However, we can also agree that this 
24/7 tether to the outside world can 
also occasionally be a distraction at 
best, and downright intrusive at worst. 
The perennial beeps, buzzes, red dots 
and blue ticks serve as – ironically – a 
constant barrier between the world 
around us, taking us away from the tasks 
we’re trying to accomplish. 
This is why the natural next phase 
in UX design will be about moving 
beyond the screen and interfacing with 
the devices around us in more natural 
ways, such as computer vision, artificial 
intelligence (AI), and also voice control. 
The concept behind these invisible 
interfaces – also known as Zero UI – is 
essentially designing for where all of 
The reason so many have adopted voice 
as the de facto standard for invisible 
design is simple. As we’ve moved through 
the different ways of interacting with 
our devices, the common goal has been 
to increase speed and usability while 
reducing user friction. We started 
with complicated strings of keystroke 
commands, then moved on to incorporate 
the mouse, and more recently the rise of 
the smartphone has led to touchscreens 
taking over. As natural as the 
touchscreen is, though, it’s still a screen, 
so the obvious next step is something 
that continues to evolve the user journey, 
being quicker and easier to use while 
further reducing friction. And what could 
be quicker or easier than voice?
In terms of how we implement voice 
in a mainstream capacity, we should 
first cast our minds back. In the 90s, 
"We are moving towards a future without 
any traditional interface, where we move 
away from the touchscreen – or any 
screen at all" 

Banking giant Capital One was looking to 
design an Alexa skill, which enabled its 
customers to manage their finances with 
nothing but their voice and by speaking to 
their Amazon Echo devices. This would let 
customers quickly and conveniently access 
the bank’s services wherever they went. 
This presented a major design challenge 
for the team working on this project, who 
had never taken on anything like this before. 
To begin with, they studied call centre data 
and researched related key search terms 
from Google in order to better understand 
their customers’ transactional needs, as well 
as the natural flow of human conversation. 
Following this, extensive user testing was 
carried out, which exposed the challenges 
the project would pose. One particularly 
tricky example was if a customer wanted to 
hear their balance. What if they held multiple 
accounts? What if they also had credit cards 
with the bank? On the traditional online 
interface the customer would be able to call 
this information up in a few clicks, however 
voice is an entirely different scenario. 
As a result of this user testing, Capital 
One was able to overcome these obstacles 
and create one of the first working use-
cases in the financial sector. The company 
also overcame the barrier of the initially 
rudimentary voice recognition technology 
by creating a four-digit personal key, an 
extra layer of security beyond the traditional 
username/password that users were asked 
for every time they tried to talk to Alexa 
about money.

Left An example of how 
we might have used 
voice assistants up 
until now

A specific sector set to be 
revolutionised by Zero UI is the field 
of online retail. Forward thinking 
companies (such as Ocado) have 
already begun to design for this by 
offering a voice-only search function, 
and this will become the norm as 
consumers and retailers get more 
accustomed to the technology. 
 However, it is crucial that 
consumers are able to intuitively 
search for and purchase products 
by brand if the technology is to be 
a success. For example, imagine a 
situation in which you ask Alexa to 
order more tea bags, and she has to 
sift through the 15 million results 
on Google – it would be both time-
consuming and ineffective. 
 Retailers must also consider how 
invisible interfaces will work from an 
advertising perspective. As devices 
such as smart speakers become 
integrated into consumers' lives, it 
may be seen as intrusive to advertise 
to consumers in this format. Take 
Burger King’s recent disaster with 
Google Home, in which the brand’s 
TV advertising was designed to 
activate a separate advertisement 
on the smart device – a move that 
was universally criticised as being 
“creepy” and “invasive”.
 While it’s likely that many 
eCommerce interfaces will remain 
screen-based for the foreseeable 
future, the introduction and 
mainstream adoption of invisible 
interface devices points to a future 
where we become more comfortable 
with screen-less interactions. This 
means that retail brands, designers 
and consumers alike must begin 
preparing for this future now if they 
are to avoid being left behind.

what drove people to embrace online? 
The availability of internet access on 
our home computers; unified devices we 
could all get behind. 
A decade ago, what drove us to embrace 
touchscreen UI? The iPhone; another 
unified device we could all get behind.
So, what invention is going to be 
the driving force for the mainstream 
adoption of talking to your devices? 
If you were caught talking to your 
computer even a few years ago, you’d 
likely attract more than a few funny 
looks. Now, the explosion in popularity 
of voice-controlled devices such as 
the Amazon Echo and Google Home, 
suggests a future wherein this becomes 
the normal process, and menus, screens, 
pointers and commands are replaced by 
simple spoken language.
Controlling our devices with nothing 
but the spoken word might seem far-
fetched – a pipe dream reserved for 
fanciful sci-fi films. However, this may 
be a reality far sooner than you think. 
The reason this has been a pipe dream 
up until now is because the computing 
power required to process, break down 
and interpret human speech is huge, 
requiring more resources than were 
previously available in a mainstream 
capacity. However, numerous 
breakthroughs were made in this field 
in 2016, and we are now at the point 
where there’s enough computational 
power available to us to make speech 
recognition and interaction a viable 
alternative to visual interfaces.
On top of this, we’re lucky enough to be 
living in a time when around one in three

interfaces are set 
to transform the 
way we shop 

people carries a smartphone – essentially 
a mini computer with a microphone 
attached – around in their pockets; a 
figure that will continue to rise in the 
years to come. 
Designing from a  
technical standpoint
In terms of how we go about designing for 
this, the most fundamental element to 
consider is that because voice-controlled 
interfaces are invisible, users will not 
have the benefit of images, buttons or 
clickable links to guide them. Because 
of this, developers and designers must 
ensure the voice assistant is providing 
users with constant feedback and support 
so they are not left in the dark.
Simplified, brief interactions need to 
be weighed up against people feeling lost 
or not in control. In a traditional screen 
interaction, visual cues such as buttons, 
tick boxes, links, or error messages 
provide a virtual breadcrumb trail for 
users, letting them know exactly where 
they are in a given process. 
Similar to screen-based design 
patterns, it’s important to consider 
that users will need voice patterns 
they are familiar with every time 
they operate a new app or program, in 
order to acclimatise them to the new 
software. Above all, this process must 
be simple and intuitive, using universal 
conversation patterns as a method for 
executing commands. 
It is also important to bear in mind 
that users have to use their short-term 
memory to remember key phrases to 
interact with the device. Therefore 
conversational exchanges need to be kept 
short and sweet to lessen the cognitive 
load and avoid confusing users.
Overall, while voice UIs may be simpler 
on the surface, they require reassurance 
and pacing to be built into the interaction 
if they are to provide the best possible 
user experience, particularly for those 
with cognitive impairments or lower 
levels of confidence. 
Designing for language 
Considering the range of functions that 
voice devices will need to be able to 
accomplish in order to effectively take 
over from the tech we currently use, as 
well as the fact that the end user will be 
working entirely without visual cues, 
language is crucially important.
Natural language, tone of voice, accent 
and tone are all vital. Currently, home 
assistants feel a little pre-programmed 
and artificial (it’s still obvious you’re 
speaking to a robot), so to alleviate that 
we need to look at the language people 
feel comfortable with. 
Overly assertive, imperative language 
can be off-putting, particularly to less 
tech-savvy users. Colloquial terms can 
be more reassuring, however, overly 
quirky communication can be seen as 
condescending. Therefore, there is still

thinking designers to build specifically  
for greater personalisation and also 
customer engagement. 
We hear the phrase ‘tone of voice’ - in 
relation to both a brand’s personality 
and how they communicate with their 
audience and clients – a lot when we’re 
talking about a brand’s communications 
strategy, and this is another area that 
is set to be completely turned on its 
head with the mainstream adoption of 
invisible interfaces.
Whereas previously a brand’s tone of 
voice may have largely been restricted to 
considerable user research and usability 
testing required in this area. 
Another critical design point to 
consider is avoiding bias. In traditional 
UI, and when you come to think of it, 
any software design, there can often be 
a disconnect where the designers are not 
necessarily representative of who will use 
the software.
This is especially important in voice 
UIs because people tend to be sensitive 
to language. For example, the language 
of a white male, graduate software 
developer could be quite different to 
the conversational tone between young 
girls or older adults. Of course, that’s 
not intended as a generalisation about 
developers, but a reminder that as with 
any software, we aren’t always the users 
of our products. Bringing a whole new 
meaning to ‘tone of voice’.
This technology can also be leveraged 
in a positive way, and there is actually a 
fantastic opportunity here for forward-
written communications, conversational 
interfaces provide an entirely new way 
to communicate and shape the overall 
experience a customer has with a brand. 
This, of course, presents a brand new 
set of considerations for UX designers – 
namely the literal tone of voice brands 
choose to employ in these devices, 
including gender, dialect, and expression 
- but also a wealth of new opportunities.

Next-gen UX
In terms of where we’ll see the tech 
take-off, a sector that could benefit 
hugely is digital health products, 
particularly fitness trackers and related 
health monitoring devices. 
Our health sector is currently feeling 
the pressure from rising numbers 
of patients, in addition to an ageing 
population presenting more complex 
cases. Because of this, a greater focus 
has naturally been put on convincing 
people to take a more proactive stance in 
managing their own health.
Invisible interface devices such as 
personal fitness wristbands could be 
key to this, providing people with an 
unobtrusive way to measure their vitals, 
as well as other health related statistics 
such as steps, calorie intake and their 
heart rate. 
Another sector that could be 
transformed by invisible interface 
devices such as the Amazon Echo is 
retail. Voice search in particular could be 
a game-changer; indeed, we’re already 
beginning to see significant pickup in 
this area. A recent study from Google 
revealed that more than half of teens 
(55%) now use voice search on a daily 
basis – a strong statistic that goes some 
way to showcase the current penetration 
of invisible interfaces in everyday life.
This tech looks set to really take off in 
retail as more brands make the leap and 
begin proactively 
making use 
of it to engage 
customers in new 
and exciting ways. 
A great example 
here is Ocado, who 
recently made 
the headlines by 
becoming one of the first retailers to 
offer a dedicated app enabling customers 
to shop using voice commands. 
While this is a tremendously exciting 
time for UX design, we as designers must 
adapt accordingly. Voice interaction 
represents an exhilarating new challenge 
to UX designers, one that we must 
acknowledge and learn quickly from 
if – as a community – we are to take full 
advantage of the opportunities this new, 
seamless technology presents. 
had their own distinct personality and 
voice – perhaps even one which you, the 
user, could control? Such a thing would  
be truly a tone of voice for the digital age 
we live in. 
Which areas of business will 
be most affected?
The early success that Amazon, Apple 
and Google have enjoyed in this area 
has helped to raise consumer awareness 
of just how useful 
these devices could 
be in everyday life. 
It looks as though 
this technology could 
be set to explode 
in popularity in 
2018, with a host 
of innovative new 
software and hardware products coming 
to the market. 
This technology can also be incredibly 
useful from an accessibility standpoint. 
By negating our current reliance on 
screens and creating the ability to control 
devices with nothing but your voice, 
users with visual or physical impairments 
will be able to access and use devices 
completely independently, with no need 
for external assistance – some for the 
first time ever.

What is CRO?
Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) is 
the process of maximising conversions 
from existing traffic. For example, if you 
get 1,000 visitors per day on average, and 
have a 1% conversion rate, that means 
10 of those visitors will convert. CRO is 
the process of trying to optimise your 
site, to improve that rate of conversion to 
20 users (2%) for every 1,000 visitors on 
average, for example. 
CRO also has the added benefit of 
affecting future traffic conversions from 
all sources, such as organic visits, paid 
ads and social media campaigns. If you 
can increase the average conversion from 
1% to 2%, that means all investments of 
campaigns will on average return double 
the results, leading to more efficient 
marketing. A win/win scenario if there 
ever was one.
At its core, CRO is fairly simple. You 
assign a level of baseline performance 
(current conversion rate) and then do

an A/B test to see if you can improve that. 
An A/B test can actually consist of more 
than just two outcomes, but essentially 
it means that you split percentages of 
traffic between a couple of variations to 
see which performs best. For example, 
you could send 50% of your website’s 
users to the current version of a product 
page and then split the remaining 50% 
between two test variations.
From this point you need to monitor 
the conversion rates for each version to 
see which one performs best. Don’t worry 
if the existing version performs best; CRO 
is a learning experience and you’ll likely 
not get it right first time. 
Try another variation and keep 
experimenting until you find what works 
for your website. Remember that what 
works best now might not necessarily 
be best in six months, as trends and UX 
change over time – don’t assume that 
once you have completed a successful 
CRO project on one page, that it will 
continue to perform at that level for 
months and months. Keep reviewing 
performance on a monthly basis to 
identify dips early and keep your website 
a well oiled, converting machine!
Real world example
Imagine that you’re the owner of your 
town’s first supermarket and you notice 
that your large store is selling less 
impulse products (think chocolate and 
soft drinks) per customer than your 
smaller corner shop competitors. This is 
despite your supermarket offering a much 
larger and higher quality selection. Why 
would this be the case?
After examining your competitors, you 
realise that the majority of their impulse 
sales come from displaying their impulse 
products within eyesight of the checkout 
while waiting to pay. As such, you trial 
placing the chocolate near to the cashier 
and notice a major boost in sales. 
Following your first success, you then 
take your improvements one step further 
and trial different chocolate brands, sizes 
of package and flavours at each checkout. 
You monitor which three products sell 
the most so that you eventually place 
the most successful products across all 
cashiers to further increase sales.
This is a real world equivalent of 
Conversion Rate Optimisation and 
supermarkets across the world are still 
trialing new layouts and approaches to 
increase sales of key products all year 
round to maximise profits from their 
existing footfall. You should get in the 
habit of applying the same logic and 
mindset to improving your website and 
attempt to convert more visitors into 
customers. CRO doesn’t just apply to 
eCommerce sites and product sales, but 
also increasing user signups, newsletter 
signups or any other KPI that increases 
revenue, user experience or engagement.
CRO is the future
If you have an existing website, we 
strongly recommend that you consider 
making CRO your main form of website 
development moving forward, rather 
than forking out for a major redesign 
every year or two. Consider assigning a 
percentage of your CRO budget to keep 
the website looking modern and working 
well from a UX point of view. 
Working in this manner leads to more 
consistent conversion rates over time 
rather than the traditional model of a 
full redesign every 12-24 months, which 
boosts conversion performance initially 
but then tails off over time as the site 
becomes dated to the point where a full 
redesign yields big results. 
The costs of such monthly updates 
alongside your CRO will likely work out 
comparatively to a major overhaul in the 
same period of time but can deliver more 
conversion results, leading to more profit.
As mentioned previously, trends and 
UX change more than you’d think over 
time because the web is a constantly 
evolving and improving place. If you have

CRO IN ACTION
After reviewing the homepage of allcarleasing.co.uk and comparing 
to competitors, this author realised the current landing page looked 
great but didn’t show many products or give an easy way to begin 
searching above the fold. The first round of changes focussed on this, 
introducing key offers directly below the menu, making the large 
image a background image and adding a quick search below the main 
navigation, while adding some trust reassurance of a high score from 
Feefo reviews. The second month focussed on the product detail 
page and drew focus to the enquiry section through some simple but 
effective amendments like adding a border around the CTA section 
and adding an informative piece of text above the lease configurator 
to explain how to use it. As you can see in the image, the before and 
after above the fold look starkly different, with the amended version 
focussing on offers and best deals alongside making searching 
for specific vehicles more accessible. This A/B experiment was 
conducted using Optimizely Full Stack to integrate changes within 
the application code and get detailed feedback on performance.
so, you should consider CRO as a never-
ending project. Once you have your site 
converting well, your goal is to try and 
keep them at that level by identifying 
the areas that start to dip and improving 
them as soon as possible.
How to do CRO effectively
There are a large selection of tools to 
choose from to achieve your CRO goals. 
Depending on your technical ability 
and complexity of A/B tests required, 
a simple visual editor to change some 
content, visual styles or CTA (Call To 
Action) elements may be all that is 
required. On the other hand, if you need 
more comprehensive A/B tests that 
justify an integrated service within your 
application, enabling you to A/B test the 
back-end logic or serve totally different 
experiences to your users, then a more 
advanced tool will be needed.
Identify your KPIs
Before you get caught up in deciding 
which CRO tool to use you should clearly 
define the KPIs that you wish to improve. 
For an eCommerce site, these are likely 
to be as simple as more clicks on the Add 
to Cart button, fewer exits from checkout 
pages and more newsletter signups. For 
a SaaS website, the KPIs might be more 
signups or more upgrades to higher

Thrive Themes – Headline 
Optimizer (for bloggers) 
https://thrivethemes.com/headlineoptimizer
One for the bloggers out there. Thrive Themes 
is a WordPress plugin creation company that 
provide plugins with a focus on CRO. The simple 
Headline Optimizer plugin enables you to test 
multiple blog post headlines to see which 
content leads to more clicks to your blog post. 
It’s the ultimate tool to test out linkbait 
headlines or find the right writing style for your 
audience. With this plugin there is no need to 
integrate with a third-party service and is as 
simple to use as any other WordPress plugin. 
The fairly comprehensive analytics also 
enables you to identify time on page, click 
through rate and more so you can identify not 
only the titles leading to the most clicks, but the 
titles leading to the most engagement, too.

membership types, for example. For 
a blog these may be as simple as more 
page views per visit or more clicks on the 
external ads.
Set up analytics tracking  
and identify your baseline
The next step is vital to be able to 
quantify your results. Just checking the 
number of orders or signups over a period 
of time and comparing it to the past 
can give an okay indication, but is not a 
reliable method because traffic and active 
users can fluctuate day by day. 
The easiest way to do this is to set up 
goals and events within Google Analytics. 
Once you have completed this step, you 
will have a firm and reliable baseline 
to evaluate your first round of A/B tests 
against. Another benefit is that it is very 
motivating to know (and brag about) an 
actual percentage increase, thanks to 
your hard work.
Now for the frustrating part. Before 
you start your first round of A/B tests, 
you need to collect enough data from 
analytics to be able to identify if your 
improvements are actually working. If 
you have a busy site you can have this 
data within a day or two but be prepared 
to wait a week or two if you have a new 
website with lower traffic levels. Try to 
wait until you have data from 1,000 visits 
before making any major changes.
Identify weaknesses  
and plan A/B tests
Now that you have reliable baselines 
set up for your KPIs, you have much 
more useful data available to you within 
analytics and may even be able to spot 
major weak points in your site. Is there 
a specific point during the checkout 
that users leave? Are less than 0.2% of 
people viewing the product page clicking 
the Add to Basket button? Is a very low 
percentage of first-time visitors to your 
site failing to click the Register button in 
the top-right corner?
Once you’ve identified your biggest and 
most urgent weak points, evaluate the 
page, try to find the cause of the poor 
performance and plan your A/B tests. 
Is the Add to Basket button the same 
colour as all the other buttons on the 
page and therefore hard to spot? Is it 
below the fold and users have to scroll 
further down to see it? 
Think of A/B testing like a science 
experiment back in school. First you need

Optimizely 
One of the industry leaders in CRO offering 
multiple services based on your needs. It 
provides a similar UI editor to Google Optimize 
if you wish to experiment, but the company’s 
offering is not different enough to warrant a 
paid service over the free Google Optimize.
However, it comes into its own when you 
need application/website level logic changing 
for your A/B tests. If you wish to fundamentally 
change the experience for your users then you 
will need code changes also. 
For example, with the Optimizely Full Stack 
service you can deliver a completely different 
checkout (logic, layout and style) all within your 
website’s code. You create the experiment and 
variations within your Optimizely account and 
then use its SDKs (PHP, JavaScript and more) to 
integrate these experiments into your code. 
As Optimizely is a complete CRO solution and 
does not integrate with Google Analytics like 
Google Optimize, you will need to track your 
events with Optimizely events as well as Google 
Analytics events, so that Optimizely can track 
performance. Using the SDKs the code is very 
simple, as seen below…
$optimizelyClientInstance.track(‘enquiry’, 
$sessionID);
Once you have the events tracking and your 
experiments live, the results update regularly so you 
can check in on your progress whenever you like
Integrating Optimizely directly into your 
application in this way can afford you total 
control over the user experience and create 
really unique and powerful A/B tests to really 
learn all about your website and make some 
major improvements.
Google Optimize
A free and easy-to-use visual editor giving 
you the power to make visual changes to your 
website or webpage. As Google Optimize has 
direct access to your analytics account, you have 
one less step to get ready for your tests. 
Using your newly created Google Analytics 
events and goals as the experiment objective, 
you can get detailed reports about the changes 
you make and how they affect conversions.
With the visual editor, you can change text, 
positioning and even directly edit the HTML of 
an element (adding custom CSS styles etc) to 
make your variations.
Using the UI Editor to create new variations is easy with 
Google Optimize
Create multiple variations, edit the variant 
weights (percentage of traffic sent to each 
variation) and go live. It is that simple.
The reporting is also super detailed and 
easy to understand, making reviewing your 
experiments both easy and interesting. 
to create yourself a hypothesis and then 
get to work proving it wrong or right. 
For example: “I propose that if I make 
my ‘Add to Basket’ button stand out 
more by making it a different colour with 
slightly bigger text and padding, then 
more users will notice it and be persuaded 
to begin their checkout journey”.
Experiment
Now that you have your baseline 
performance established and a 
hypothesis to prove, you’re ready to 
create some A/B tests and put them in 
the wild. We introduce some CRO tools in 
the box on the left if you’d like a starting 
point for available tools.
Just remember to be patient until you 
have enough data to make an informed 
decision. Around 1,000 visits should be 
enough to clearly see the difference in 
performance between them.
Evaluate and repeat
Finally, your first A/B tests are complete! 
Compare your results from the 1,000 (or 
more) visitors to your baseline conversion 
rates and identify the variation with the 
highest conversion rate. Put that version 
permanently live on your website and 
reap the rewards of your hard work. 
Now go back through the process, find 
the next biggest problem within your 
website, ensure your baseline data is 
collected, evaluate the page to see what 
may be the problem, create a hypothesis 
that you anticipate will solve it and then 
experiment with options!
Conclusion
In a world where the internet is growing 
exponentially and competition is 
everywhere, CRO will become vital. 
Optimising your site to reduce cart 
abandonment, increase cross sales and 
improve engagement could make all 
the difference and lead to not only more 
sales, but more loyal customers. 
CRO tools are available for every 
level of website, expertise and skillset. 
Whether a blogger, business owner, 
designer or full stack developer, there is 
a CRO service that will enable you to start 
delving into CRO and improving your 
offering, experiment by experiment.

 SERVICE WORKERS
to deliver your software to users, since they have 
to download a package or visit an app store. It’s not 
surprising, therefore, that there’s been a strong 
focus in recent years both from web standards bodies 
and browser makers to bridge the gap by delivering 
more and more functionality to the web that you 
might normally associate with native apps.
Examples of web APIs that have been introduced 
to support this objective are plentiful: there’s the 
Notifications API to generate push-style notifications 
on a device; Web Bluetooth, which enables sites to 
establish Bluetooth connections; and the Vibration 
API, the purpose of which you can probably guess. 
One of the most interesting technologies, however, is 
service workers.

For many years, there’s been a notable 
distinction between the functionality available 
on the web and in ‘native’ apps, whether on mobile 
or desktop. A native build has always had the upper 
hand in terms of user experience, offering a host of 
advantages: swifter load times and navigation 
responses; closer integration with device functions 
such as touch sensitivity, vibration and push 
notifications; but perhaps most importantly, the 
ability to build software that works both with and 
without an internet connection.
There are problems with native development, 
however. Your code won’t be cross-platform, so 
you may have to code independently for iOS and 
Android, or Windows, Mac and Linux. It’s also harder

Service workers
Lifecycle Each service 
worker has a lifecycle which 
it progresses through a 
number of states. You’ll find 
that you generally perform 
particular actions at each 
stage of its lifecycle
The concept of service workers is very simple. 
Installed by a website, they are stored by the 
browser, and run in the background even when 
the website no longer has focus or has been closed. 
The core function of a service worker is to intercept 
network requests made to a page and decide how to 
handle them. This enables you to choose between 
routing the request to the server, or serving up 
content from a cache, which you control.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the 
development of a simple app – a game of Noughts 
and Crosses - which uses a service worker in order 
to cache its resources for offline use, and renders 
different content depending on whether it is being 
used online or offline.
Before we get started, there are a few basics to 
establish. Service worker support isn’t universal at 
this stage, so we’ll assume you’ll use Chrome during 
development. You’ll also need an HTTP server. If 
you don’t typically use one for development – and 
you generally should - then it’s straightforward to 
set up using npm (Node Package Manager), which 
is available at https://www.npmjs.com. After you’ve 
installed npm, from the console you can run:
npm install -g http-server
This will install the http-server package globally. 
Once done, you can run it from your project folder:
http-server -p 8000 -c-1
This will serve your content at 
(http://127.0.0.1:8000/). We’ve used the -c-1 
parameter to disable HTTP caching (that is, stop 
the browser automatically trying to cache content), 
because this can override the behaviour we build into 
our service worker.
If you were to put your page live at a later stage, 
you’d need to switch from HTTP to HTTPS. Since 
service workers can intercept, modify and even 
fabricate network requests, they are immensely 
powerful and could be open to exploitation. 
Consequently, if you’re using them anywhere other 
than your local machine, HTTPS is mandated to 
ensure that the service worker being installed is a 
genuine one.
Let’s begin by setting up the basics of our site. 
Obviously we need some markup (index.html), and 
we’ll add some styling too (game.css). We’ll split our 
JavaScript into several files: game.js will contain all 
the logic associated with the game itself, and should 
not need to worry about service workers; site.js will be 
our entry point and handle scripts execution when 
the page is loaded; and sw.js will be the code for our 
service worker, which we’ll come back to later. We 
won’t be going into the detail of implementing game.
js within this tutorial, but you can obtain it online 
(https://github.com/simon-a-j/net-magazine).
We’re now ready to start implementing our service 
worker. Before we do so, it’s important to take a 
moment to consider the lifecycle of a service worker. 
A service worker can exist in a number of states, and 
different events are triggered depending on its state. 
You’ll typically want to perform specific actions 
at each state in the lifecycle – this is most easily 
visualised through a diagram (see above).
site.js is where we begin to add our service worker. 
We need to start by checking the browser supports 
them, and if so, registering ours. 
We’ll also include some logging, as the standard 
console feedback from service workers can be a little 
cryptic. The scope parameter refers to the path on 
the site for which the service worker will intercept 
requests; we’ll go for the current directory (root) to 
cover everything.
if (‘serviceWorker’ in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener(‘load’, function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register(‘sw.js’, {scope: ‘./’}).
then(registration => {
      console.log(“Successfully registered service worker.”);
    }, function(error) {
      console.log(“Error registering service worker: “ + error);
    });
  });
}
The syntax above, as with other features of 
service workers, makes use of a JavaScript Promise. 
Promises represent the outcome of an asynchronous 
operation (in this case, registering the service 
worker), and the use of .then() enables us to assign

Internals It is possible

Worker Internals tab.
a function to use this outcome once it is available. 
If you aren’t familiar with Promises, they’re worth 
brushing up on as an increasing number of JavaScript 
APIs rely heavily on them.
If you create a blank sw.js file and load the site in 
Chrome now, you should find that the registration 
of your worker has been logged. You can also visit 
a couple of pages built into Chrome to inspect the 
service worker and see its lifecycle status:
chrome://inspect/#service-workers
And:
chrome://serviceworker-internals/
Next, we can begin implementing the service 
worker’s functionality. This goes in sw.js, which must 
always be placed in the root directory of your site 
(not the JavaScript folder), because a service worker 
is only able to access content in its current directory 
or sub-folders.
The first thing that we do is to define some 
variables identifying the name of the cache we want 
to use and stipulating the content to be cached. 
This content list should always include ‘./’ in order to 
ensure that the base URL is handled correctly as well 
as individual resources.
var CACHE = ‘game-cache-v1’;
var CONTENT_TO_CACHE = [
  ‘./’,
  ‘./index.html’,
  ‘./template.html’,
  ‘./template_offline.html’,
  ‘./game.css’,
  ‘./site.js’,
  ‘./game.js’,
  ‘./sw.js’,
  ‘./cross.png’,
  ‘./tick.png’];
 
We can now use these to tell the service worker 
to actually cache the content by hooking in to its 
‘install’ event. The use of event.waitUntil() here tells the 
service worker to remain in ‘installing’ status until a 
successful Promise is returned from the addition of 
all content to the cache.
self.addEventListener(‘install’, event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE).then(cache => {
      console.log(“Adding content to cache...”);
      return cache.addAll(CONTENT_TO_CACHE);
    })
  );
});
You’ll notice that the name of our cache includes a 
version number. This enables us to manage updates 
to cached content and to purge previous caches 
containing out-of-date content when we make 
changes. We do this by listening for an ‘activate’ event 
from the service worker, upon which we will review 
all offline caches and delete any that do not match 
the current version number of our cache.
self.addEventListener(‘activate’, event => {
  console.log(“Activated service worker. Checking cache is 
up-to-date...”);
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then(keyList => {
      return Promise.all(keyList.map(key => {
        if ([CACHE].indexOf(key) === -1) {
          console.log(“Deleting old cache: “ + key);
          return caches.delete(key);
        }
      }));
    })
  );
});
The nature of service workers and caches can lead 
to confusion when making changes to either the 
service worker itself or the content it’s caching. You 
may frequently find yourself wondering why changes 
aren’t taking effect, or why old content is being 
served. Generally as you make changes, you will 
want to ensure you have done the following:

Service workers
The concept of installable web apps that offer equivalent 
functionality and user experience to their native counterparts 
has been a goal for some time, but in 2015 the term ‘Progressive 
Web Apps’ was coined to refer to it. Google is a leading champion of 
this concept and term, and there’s an emerging specification that 
captures what attributes they should have, which extends beyond 
just working offline. Essentially, advocates of PWAs express that 
they should at a minimum:
1  Offer equivalent speed of rendering and user interaction to 
native apps
2  Integrate with the device through the use of native APIs 
and functionality, and present as if native rather than being 
accessed through the browser
3  Work both online and offline, or work with an unreliable 
network connection
Google’s developer site, (https://developers.google.com/web/
fundamentals), has some great coverage of how to think about 
these areas, and design patterns to solve them. 
Arguably the maturity and widespread adoption of PWAs and 
their underlying technologies (which include service workers 
and a range of other web APIs) will be good news for both app 
developers and consumers. They’ll enable a much wider range of 
functionality on the web to be exposed in a manner that results in 
a faster, slicker user experience, while reducing the complexity and 
cost of managing native functionality across multiple platforms.
There’s still a way to go, both in terms of browser support, app 
maker adoption, and maturity of the specifications themselves. 
You can see many examples of early PWAs at https://pwa.rocks, and 
no doubt this list will continue to grow in the future.
THE FUTURE
IS PROGRESSIVE
 
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS
Early adoption https://pwa.rocks has collated a list of some of the first Progressive 
Web Apps out there, and there are some big names already building them
1  Updated the cache version in your code if any of 
the content changed
2  Unloaded the prior instance of the service worker 
which was running using the Service Worker 
Internals page
3  Double-checked that your HTTP server is running 
to install the new service worker
Now that we have content being cached and the 
cache refreshed when appropriate, we’re ready 
to implement functionality to intercept network 
requests and handle appropriately. An active service 
worker will receive ‘fetch’ requests when the browser 
tries to send a request to the server within its scope. 
We can listen for these, and then have the service 
worker determine how to respond to them.
There are multiple approaches you could take 
to handling these fetch requests. You could default 
to the network, then fall back to the cache if 
unavailable. Alternatively, and more commonly for 
static content, you could default to the cache then 
fall back to the network, which relies on your cache 
versioning to ensure you aren’t serving outdated 
content. We’ll begin with the latter approach, in 
which we use caches.match() to determine whether the 
requested resource is available in the cache.
self.addEventListener(‘fetch’, event => {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
          if (response) {
            console.log(“Retrieving resource from cache: “ + event.
request.url);
            return response;
          }
          console.log(“Retrieving resource from server: “ + event.
request.url);
          return fetch(event.request);
        }
      )
    );
});
You should now find that if you load your page, 
then terminate the web server and reload the URL, 
the site will work offline. You’ll also note that if 
There are multiple 
approaches you could

Browser support http://caniuse.com lets you check on browser support for the 
latest HTML, CSS and JavaScript features
you refresh while the server is still running, it still 
retrieves from the cache (which you can check 
using the console logging), since we have it set up to 
default to cached content.
This is a good start, but what if you want to 
serve up different content depending on whether 
we are online or using the cache? We can do this 
by modifying our response to the fetch event. One 
approach is to cache a completely separate offline 
page and then serve it up as the response when 
we detect a navigation request. We can test for 
navigation using:
if (event.request.mode === ‘navigate’) {
}
However, this limits the functionality we can provide 
and could lead to a lot of code duplication. There’s 
an alternative approach we can use, which takes 
advantage of two other new browser features: HTML 
templates and HTML imports. These are part of the 
Web Components specifications, but essentially 
enable us to build modular HTML code that we can 
dynamically load into our page when required. 
Experimental in nature, currently this will only work 
with Chrome.
Let’s create some separate markup in template.html, 
which will be our first piece of template code:
<template id=”status-template”>
  <p id=”status” class=”online”><img src=’tick.png’ 
class=’connection-symbol’>You are playing the game online.</
p>
</template>
Using an import statement, we can now load this 
into our page from site.js and dynamically add its 
content to the DOM:
var template_import = document.getElementById(‘template-
import’).import;
var template = template_import.getElementById(‘status-

document.getElementById(“connection-status”).
appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
 
You’ll now find that when you load the page, the 
content from your HTML template is injected. So how 
do we modify this when the content is being loaded 
offline? Let’s create a separate template_offline.html file 
for the alternative markup:
<template id=”status-template”>
  <p id=”status” class=”offline”><img src=’cross.png’

HOW WIDELY
SUPPORTED?
 
 COMPATIBILITY
The web is a constantly evolving landscape, and new 
technologies like service workers are being introduced all the 
time. The process by which this happens isn’t straightforward. 
Usually there will be a standards body such as W3C, which defines 
a specification for a new technology. However, it is then down to 
browser makers (primarily Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft) to 
implement the specification in their respective browsers. Only then 
will a technology really be ready for production use. This typically 
happens over a period of time, with Google and Mozilla tending to 
lead the way. Where features are supported by some browsers but 
not others, often JavaScript ‘polyfills’ will be published by third-
party developers to bridge the gap.
At the time of publication, service workers are supported in 
Firefox, Chrome and Opera. You might argue that this means they 
aren’t quite ready for live use. However, since service workers 
shouldn’t affect the core online functionality of a page, there’s 
really no harm implementing them to enable an offline experience 
for users of compatible browsers – the site will still work fine 
online for others. This is referred to as ‘progressive enhancement’.
As you experiment with newer web technologies, an invaluable 
resource is http://caniuse.com, which documents the latest state 
of browser support for all the latest technologies. In this tutorial, 
we’ve also used the Fetch API, Cache API, Promises, HTML Imports 
and HTML Templates, all of which you can check on there.
Another question you might be asking is how well supported 
service workers are by popular front-end frameworks. Angular 
5 will introduce an @angular/service-worker package to replace 
and simplify earlier approaches, and for React you can either 
use vanilla service worker code, or integrate one of a number of 
packages designed for offline support, such as sw-precache, into 
your build pipeline.

</template>
Now we have two different template files to use 
depending on whether the content is being retrieved 
from the server or the cache. This enables us to 
modify the fetch response in our service worker 
to return two different files when template.html is 
requested. In this case, we’ll apply logic to default to 
the server first, and only fall back to the cache if it’s 
unavailable – but most crucially, if we fall back to the 
cache, rather than template.html we’ll respond with 
template_offline.html.
self.addEventListener(‘fetch’, event => {
  if (event.request.url.includes(“template.html”)) {
    event.respondWith(
      fetch(event.request).then(function() {
        console.log(“Retrieving online template from server: “ + 
event.request.url);
        return caches.match(event.request);
      }).catch(function() {
        console.log(“Retrieving offline template from cache: “ + 
event.request.url);
        return caches.match(‘template_offline.html’);
      })
    );
  }
  else {
  // Previous logic to serve remaining content from cache by 
default
  }
});
You also need to remember to add these new 
template files (along with the .png files we are 
using) to the CONTENT_TO_CACHE variable in sw.js 
and increment your cache version so they are stored 
when the page is loaded from the server.
You should now find that your page works both 
online and offline, and will display a different 
templated message depending on which. 
Congratulations on taking your first step into the 
world of service workers.
One thing you might observe is that when you 
reload your page offline, the current state of your 
game is lost. We haven’t implemented any data 
storage to retain this, which would be a useful 
feature for most offline apps. To extend this 
example further, you could consider doing this using 
IndexedDB, another new API that enables client-side 
storage of structured data.
As you look to implement more complex apps 
offline, you may begin to find caching troublesome 
and the API a little too low-level. Fortunately, like 
many such scenarios on the web, there are wrappers 
and libraries that exist to make your life easier. 
Google Workbox, available at https://workboxjs.org, 
is one such project. Workbox is a set of libraries and 
tools to make building offline apps easier, and will 
solve problems such as cache versioning, which 
we encountered while building our game: it will 
automatically update the cache with new or modified 
resources, rather than requiring you to delete and 
rebuild the cache completely. Frameworks such as 
this likely represent the future of service workers, 
and will help bring them into the mainstream.

the HTML <head> element on order to preload a hero 
banner image:
html
<link rel=”preload” href=”/img/logo.svg” as=”image”>
You can also use preload in an HTTP header:
http
Link: </img/logo.svg>; rel=preload; as=image
On the next page, you can see two screenshot rolls 
of the same page loading in Chrome. One scenario 
uses preload to load a hero banner image, while the 
other doesn’t.
In the example with preload, the banner image

BE SELECTIVE AND  
PRELOAD CRITICAL IMAGES
Take a look at your site and identify a critical image 
asset. For most, this would be a logo or hero image 
that you want to have render as soon as possible.
This is where the preload resource hint comes in. 
preload is a way of hinting to the client that an asset 
should be retrieved before the browser parser would 
otherwise discover it. You can use it for pretty much 
anything, but it works splendidly for preloading

PRELOAD CAVEATS
 
 IN-DEPTH
preload is powerful stuff, and can be used to preemptively 
load more than just images. That said, you need to be aware 
of its potential pitfalls:
1 
Don’t forget to signal the asset’s content type in the as 
attribute, or the browser may download the asset twice. For 
images, as should have a value of image. To learn how to signal 
content types for other assets (such as CSS or JavaScript), check 
out https://w3c.github.io/preload/#as-attribute.
2 
Not all browsers support preload. In cases like these, 
preload will confer no performance benefit. Support for 
preload is growing, however, so keep an eye out at http://caniuse.
com/#feat=link-rel-preload so that you always know which 
browsers eventually pick it up!
3 
Finally, if you specify preload as an HTTP header, know that 
it can trigger a server push in some HTTP/2 implementations 
(such as Apache). If you know what you’re getting into, this may 
even confer a performance benefit, but the way server push 
interacts with the browser cache can be rather odd in some 
browsers. If you want to preload something without causing 
an HTTP/2 implementation to push it, add nopush at the end 
of the resource hint. To learn more about the idiosyncrasies of 
server push, check out Jake Archibald’s excellent article at https://
jakearchibald.com/2017/h2-push-tougher-than-i-thought/.
All because of a quick one-liner that gave the 
browser a head start.
 
AUTOMATICALLY SIMPLIFY  
YOUR SVG ARTWORK
Optimising SVGs is different than with other image 
types, because unlike JPEGs or PNGs, SVGs are 
comprised of text, specifically XML markup. This 
means that typical optimisations you would apply to 
text-based assets (for example, minification, gzip/
Brotli compression) can and should also be applied to 
SVGs. Beyond that, you can use an optimiser such as 
SVGO to tamp down the size of SVGs.
But what if you’re not merely consuming vector 
artwork, but creating it? If you’re an Illustrator user, 
you can automatically simplify your artwork to 
reduce the amount of anchor points in paths via the 
Simplify dialog window.
This dialog can be found in Illustrator’s menu by 
going to Object>Path>Simplify. By reducing Curve 
Precision (and optionally adjusting Angle Threshold), 
it is possible to remove extra path points in your 
artwork. In this instance, you’ll note that a reduction

CONVERT ANIMATED GIFS TO VIDEO 
We all love a good animated GIF. They effectively 
convey nearly any sentiment, but they can be really 
huge. Image optimisers such as gifsicle can help 
shave off excess kilobytes, but the ticket is to convert 
those GIFs into videos and embed them in the HTML5 
<video> tag. The ffmpeg command line utility is well 
suited for this task:
shell
ffmpeg -i animated.gif -b:v 512K animated.webm
ffmpeg -i animated.gif -b:v 512K animated.ogv
ffmpeg -i animated.gif -b:v 512K animated.mp4
The commands above take a source GIF (animated.
gif) as input in the -i argument, and output videos 
with a variable bitrate maximum of 512Kbps. In a test 
of our own, we were able to take a 989Kb animated 
GIF and reduce it to a 155Kb MP4, a 109Kb OGV, and 
a 85Kb WebM. All video files were comparable in 
quality to the source GIF. Because of the ubiquity of 
<video> tag support in browsers, these three video 
formats can be used like so:
<video preload=”none”>
  <source src=”/videos/animated.webm” type=”video/webm”>
  <source src=”/videos/animated.ogv” type=”video/ogg”>
  <source src=”/videos/animated.mp4” type=”video/mp4”>
</video>
If you decide to go this route, be sure to order your 
<source> tags so that the most optimal format is 
specified first, and the least optimal is specified last. 
In most cases, this means you’ll start with WebM 
videos first, but check the output file size of each 
video and go with whatever is smallest first, and end 
with whatever is largest.
If you don’t have FFmpeg or don’t know what it 
is, check it out at https://www.ffmpeg.org. It’s easy 
to install through most operating system package 
managers, such as Homebrew or Chocolatey.
LAZY LOAD WITH 
INTERSECTIONOBSERVER
Lazy loading images is something you might already 
be doing, but many lazy loading scripts use CPU-

intensive scroll event handlers. Such methods 
contribute to sluggish interactions on a page. Older 
hardware with less processing power is even more 
prone to the ill effects of this type of code. Execution 
throttling does help to a degree, but it’s still a messy 
and rather inefficient workaround for determining 
when elements are in the viewport.
Thankfully, the Intersection Observer API gives 
us a simpler and far more efficient way to determine 
when elements are in the viewport. Here’s an 
example of some basic lazy loading image markup:
<img class=”lazy” data-src=”/images/lazy-loaded-image.
jpg” src=”/images/placeholder.jpg” alt=”I’m lazy.” width=”320” 
height=”240”>
Here, we load a placeholder image in the src  
attribute, and then store the URL for the image we 
want to lazily load in the data-src attribute. To top 
it all off, we give the <img> element a class of lazy 
for easy access with querySelectorAll. From there, we 
simply use this code:
document.addEventListener(“DOMContentLoaded”, function()
{
  if(“IntersectionObserver” in window && 
“IntersectionObserverEntry” in window && 
“intersectionRatio” in  window.IntersectionObserverEntry.
prototype){
    elements = document.querySelectorAll(“img.lazy”);
    var imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver(function(en
tries, observer){
      entries.forEach(function(entry){
        if(entry.isIntersecting){
          entry.target.setAttribute(“src”, entry.target.
getAttribute(“data-src”));
          entry.target.classList.remove(“lazy”);
          imageObserver.unobserve(entry.target);
        }
      });
    });
    elements.forEach(function(image){
      imageObserver.observe(image);
    });
  }
});
Here, we bind code to the document object’s 
DOMContentLoaded event. This code checks to see if 
Intersection Observer is supported by the current 
browser. If it turns out that it is, we grab all img 
elements with a class of lazy with querySelectorAll and 
then attach observers to them.
The observer contains references to the elements 
we’re observing (entries) and the observer itself 
(observer). This code hinges on each observer entry’s 
isIntersecting value. While the observed element is 
out of the viewport, isIntersecting returns 0. As the 
element enters the viewport, though, it will return 
a value greater than 0. It’s at this point that we swap 
the content of the image’s data-src attribute into the 
src attribute, and remove its lazy class. After a given 
image lazy loads, the observer is removed from it 
with the observer’s unobserve method.
This process is much easier than mucking around 
with scroll handlers, but since Intersection Observer 
doesn’t enjoy universal support, you may have to fall 
back on them. If you’re the sort to grab a script and 
go, we’ve written a lazy loader that uses Intersection 
Observer, but also falls back to the methods of 
yesteryear. You can grab it from https://github.com/
malchata/yall.js/.

 PROFILE
Google released AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) 
just over two years ago with a promise of making 
the web faster. Instead of trying to draw a comparison 
to Apple News or Facebook Instant Articles, as many 
do, it is perhaps more appropriate to compare it to the 
HTML/CSS/JS stack.
The web platform is made of technologies that are 
ghĽqhg#e|#whdpv#ri#shrsoh#zkr#duh#qrw#ehkroghq#
to one company. The W3C has patent policies and 
experts, not to mention broad industry participation. 
Sometimes browser makers introduce a technology 
that becomes part of a standards document, and 
sometimes those technologies die a slow death in the 
outskirts of the land of zombie browsers.
Jrrjoh#DPS#lv#glļhuhqw1#Lw#lv#qrw#surgxfhg#e|#
a standards body. It is a Google product. Google 
AMP has Google resources and Google employees. 
Employees who are not encoding what standards 
bodies have learned from past mistakes. Mistakes 
such as allowing zoom to be disabled, or taking the 
XHTML approach and failing to render pages with 
code errors, or allowing page sources to be obfuscated 
under the Google.com domain.
These are just three examples. People who have 
been extolling the value of web standards since the 
early days of Internet Explorer (and earlier) have been 
udlvlqj#dodupv#dqg#ľdjjlqj#lvvxhv#vlqfh#DPS#Ľuvw#
appeared. People without that history, but with an eye 
to the future, have done it as well.
For the most part, they continue to remind us 
that AMP is not a sub-set of HTML, nor is it a set 
of guidelines to use HTML for the fastest possible 
rendering. AMP isn’t even a tool that evaluates a page 
dqg#ľdjv#lvvxhv1#DPS#lv#hvvhqwldoo|#d#irun#ri#KWPO1
Even when we look at custom elements, as allowed 
by HTML, we still have to consider the needless re-
creation of existing elements for what is supposed to 
be a simpler, faster output.
Those who work in standards already spend a good 
deal of time working to keep HTML current with 
needs and resisting hip trends, while following an 
open process, working toward cross-browser support, 
and encoding accessibility. Many of these people are 
supported by their employers, many are not.
We can’t ignore that the only reason AMP is even on

up AMP. Getting to the top of the search engine 
results page (SERP) is the SEO marketer’s dream. It’s 
also an easy pitch for an SEO marketer – make AMP 
pages and you’ll see your listing at the top.
Google may downplay the role of SERP position, 
even at the AMP Conf in March a panel agreed that the 
carousel placement was the biggest reason for AMP 
uptake, not performance. The Guardian’s own pages 
outperformed the AMP version, but that alone was not 
enough to get those pages into the coveted carousel.

and the project’s technical lead. Those are Google 
employees. In contrast, consider all the people who 
contribute to the W3C process. They are already 
committing time to an open standard. They already 
have their focus. They may struggle to be motivated 
to commit yet more time to yet another standard that 
is not open and is retreading issues that have been 
solved elsewhere.
Putting a project on GitHub, asking for contributors, 
and using your own syntax for your own opaque 
platform is not open. It’s a barrier to entry hiding 
under the signals of open source software.

 TEXT RENDERING
If you don’t have your site’s content yet (tsk!), 
give Tim Brown’s Web Font Specimen (http://
webfontspecimen.com) a spin. It sets content at  
several text sizes and with different background 
colours. It’s no replacement for real content, but it’ll 
do in a pinch.
Sometimes you get lucky, and the font you have 
chosen is designed explicitly for screens: Hoefler 
& Co’s ScreenSmart, Monotype’s eText, and Font 
Bureau’s Reading Edge are examples of collections 
specifically designed with screens in mind and 
should look beautiful everywhere. Of course, it pays 
to double-check the text rendering, regardless of the 
origins of the font.
But exactly why does text look different from one 
browser to the next? To answer that question, we’re 
going to have to take a quick detour into the nitty 
gritty details of text rendering.

Selecting a beautiful typeface is useless if it 
looks ugly on your screen. To avoid hideous, or 
worse, illegible text, you should always test if the 
font works well on the devices your visitors are 
using. You might be surprised; most of your visitors 
are probably not using the same device you use to 
design and develop. In fact, the vast majority of 
people surfing the internet are using Android and 
Windows machines (Fig 1).
The best way to test how a font behaves is to 
set a sample text in the font and try it out on all 
devices that you target. Bad rendering is especially 
noticeable on thin weights. 
For example, a font that renders well on macOS 
may appear fragile on Windows (Fig 2). It’s important 
to use real devices, because online browser-testing 
tools and virtual machines are often inaccurate 
(more on that later).

RASTERIZING AND ANTIALIASING
The process of transforming font outlines into pixels 
is called rasterization. The operating system’s text-
rendering engine places the outline (ie the shape) of 
each character at the desired font size on a pixel grid. 
Next, it colours all the pixels whose centre is inside 
the outline (Fig 3).
In this example, a pixel is either on or off, no 
matter how much of the outline is present in the 
pixel. This approximation of mathematically perfect 
outlines is called aliasing; antialiasing attempts 
to mitigate the coarse staircase-like appearances 
caused by the limited resolution of screens.
The idea behind antialiasing is to figure out how 
much of the outline is present in each pixel and 
represent that with a greyscale value. In other 
words, if the outline covers 50% of a pixel, it uses 
50% of black to colour that pixel. If the pixel is 
entirely within the outline, 100% black is used, and 
so on. This leads to an antialiased rendering that 
reduces the aliasing (Fig 4). You’ll often see the term 
‘greyscale antialiasing’ used to describe this effect.
While antialiasing improves the quality of text 
rendering, it’s possible to improve the result further 
using subpixel antialiasing. Subpixel antialiasing

ANTIALIASING
 
 IN-DEPTH
You can change antialiasing settings through the non-
standard -webkit-font-smoothing and -moz-osx-font-
smoothing CSS properties. Unfortunately, many CSS frameworks 
and libraries use the antialiased and grayscale values to make the 
text appear lighter on macOS. However, most developers and 
designers don’t realise this disables subpixel antialiasing and 
makes text appear blurrier, thereby hurting legibility. 
Changing someone else’s preferred text rendering to be less 
legible is very inconsiderate. If you must have lighter text, use a 
lighter weight instead of disabling subpixel rendering.

pixel whose centre is inside the outline is turned on. On the right is the resulting rasterization
TEXT-RENDERING ENGINES
Most operating systems use their own proprietary 
text-rendering engine, while others use the same 
open-source engine (though not necessarily with the 
same configuration). However, all of them support 
antialiasing and subpixel antialiasing but differ 
slightly in their implementation. In many operating 
systems, the choice of antialiasing method is user-
selectable. On Windows, for example, subpixel 
antialiasing is called ClearType; on macOS, it is called 
LCD Font Smoothing.
There are currently four major text-rendering 
engines: the Graphics Device Interface (also known 
as GDI) and DirectWrite on Windows; Core Graphics 
on macOS and iOS; and the open-source FreeType on 
Linux, Chrome OS, and Android. 
Generally speaking, a browser will use the text-
rendering engine that’s native to the operating 
system it is running on. Chrome, for example, uses 
DirectWrite on Windows, Core Graphics on macOS, 
and FreeType on Android. Windows is unique in 
that it offers two text rendering engines: GDI and 
the newer DirectWrite. All modern browsers use 
DirectWrite, so you don’t need to worry about GDI 
save for one exception: some browsers fall back 
on the inferior GDI rendering if the machine has 
no dedicated graphics hardware. Online browser-
testing tools and virtual machines often do not have 
dedicated graphics hardware, so text-rendering on 
these tools is not accurate.
Ideally, all text is rendered using subpixel 
antialiasing because it creates the most legible text. 
Unfortunately, that is not always possible – for 
example, subpixel antialiasing is often disabled 
on devices that can be rotated, such as tablets and 
phones. When you turn the screen of these devices, 
makes use of the characteristics of screens to 
increase the resolution of rasterized text. Each pixel 
in a display is made up of three oblong subpixels: 
red, green, and blue (other configurations exist, but 
the same principles apply). The operating system 
can control these subpixels individually; subpixel 
antialiasing exploits that by applying the coverage 
calculation to each subpixel (Fig 5).
The difference between these text-rendering 
options becomes evident when you start working at 
smaller text sizes. Without antialiasing, characters 
quickly lose their distinctive outlines. Greyscale 
antialiasing makes characters blurry but maintains 
their shape. Subpixel antialiasing renders sharp 
characters but also introduces some colour fringing 
around the character’s edges.

Above Fig 5: By targeting 
individual subpixels, 
subpixel antialiasing 
effectively increases the 
resolution of rendered 
text. The colours the 
naked eye perceives (left) 
are the result of setting 
individual coverage values 
for each subpixel (right); 
the subpixels for red, green, 
and blue combine to form a 
single perceptible colour
“The rules browsers use 
to select the antialiasing 
method are constantly 
being updated”
the subpixels are no longer arranged in the pattern 
expected by the rasterizer and will cause subpixel 
antialiasing to look ugly.
Browsers also disable subpixel antialiasing in 
similar situations, for example when text is rotated 
or animated. In this case, the rasterized text no 
longer matches the subpixel layout of the text’s 
original position and would need to be rasterized 
again. This is expensive, especially for animations, 
so most browsers fall back on greyscale antialiasing, 
which doesn’t suffer from the same problem and 
works in any orientation. 
Some browsers – Chrome on macOS, for instance – 
also disable subpixel antialiasing on high-resolution 
screens to provide a more consistent user experience. 
Other browsers only enable subpixel antialiasing on 
small text, because minor changes in text rendering 
are less visible at larger sizes.
There are several other cases where browsers 
disable subpixel antialiasing. The rules browsers 
use to select the antialiasing method are constantly 
updated as new corner cases, and problems, are 
found (https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/
internals/antialiasing-101/). These frequent changes 
make it very hard to keep track of what is going on 
with your text rendering. What once used subpixel 
antialiasing may fall back to greyscale with the next 
browser update. The only way to know for sure how 
your text renders is to test on actual devices.
You’re probably used to testing your site in 
several browsers. Testing text rendering increases 
the amount of testing you need to do manifold. 
Not only do you need to check all combinations 
of operating systems and browsers, but also all 
common text rendering settings. Some devices 
may be preconfigured to use greyscale antialiasing 
while others use a mix of greyscale and subpixel 
antialiasing. To make it even harder, it is not possible 
to use online-browser testing tools or virtual 
machines, because the text rendering often differs 
from that of real devices.
When testing, always use a representative sample 
of your content. A pattern library is ideally suited 
for testing type rendering because it includes 
a broad sample of your content: headers, body 
text, labels, background colours, and animation. 
Having examples of your content on a single page 
enables you to check all combinations of styles 
and background colours quickly. Be on the lookout 
for text that is not legible or appears thin on some 
operating systems. If you find an issue, change to a 
different weight in the same font family, make the 
text darker, or pick a different typeface. Good luck!

With a shorter learning curve than InVision 
App, and brand new design handoff tools for 
enterprise teams, there’s no better time to explore 
how Marvel can be a swift and effortless solution for 
prototyping web and mobile applications in teams.
Marvel helps teams take their designs (made 
either in Sketch or Marvel itself) from sketched idea 
to initial concept to tested concept. Its collaborative 
tools encourage stakeholders not only to have their 
say, but to be a part of the design workflow.
In-between design sprints, bouts of feedback and 
multiple reiterations, facilitated by commenting and 
annotating features that help even the largest of 
teams communicate productively, there’s also an iOS 
app that does a lot more than live preview.
With the iOS app, teams can convert static designs 
to dynamic prototypes as easily on mobile as they 
can on desktop, so nobody is ever left out of a 
design sprint when they’re without their desktop 
computer. But what’s even better is that it can help 
non-designers convert their sketched ideas to digital 
prototypes with ease. 
In this tutorial we’ll learn how Marvel helps to 
establish a collaborative team culture where design 
is a democracy; where absolutely everyone has a 
say regardless of their proficiency with a design 
application like Sketch. 
We’ll explore a workflow that involves easy-to-
use prototyping features, and then, to wrap up, we’ll 
learn about the design handoff features that help 
savvy developers turn interactive prototypes into 
real apps. Brace yourselves!
CREATE YOUR FIRST MARVEL PROJECT
Sign up at Marvel to begin, where only your name 
and email address are required. It’s really nice that 
you’re encouraged to create your first design project 
right off the bat (although you can still click the 
Skip Tour button in the top-right corner if you’re not 
ready to do that yet).

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

job: Editor of design at 
SitePoint 
areas of expertise:  
Interface design, UX, Sketch

Marvel
If not, start with step one and choose either Design 
Project or Prototype Project. A Prototype Project 
is when you upload screens that you’ve already 
designed (usually in Sketch), and a Design Project is 
when you’re starting from scratch, and you’d like to 
use Marvel’s own design tools to create a low-fidelity 
mockup (this is an amazing option for rapid iteration 
and brainstorming).
Choose Design Project, then give it a name, then 
choose iPhone X and click the Create Project button. 
From here (we’ll call this the project dashboard from 
here on out), click the Design button on the left-hand 
side, or the Start designing button in the middle of 
the window.
DESIGN LOW-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES
Our core aim here is to visualise our ideas quickly 
without wasting too much time worrying about what 
the final outcome will look like. From here we’re 
able to create shapes, images, text, ready-made 
components like tab bars, and even entire full-
screen components like this camera screen (which 
was selected from the left-hand sidebar and restyled 
using the right-hand sidebar).
Drawing shapes, creating text layers and making 
simple visual changes is fairly easy even for a non-
designer, although seasoned designers will love how 
quickly they’re able to throw an idea together and 
click the Add to Project button.
Although you can’t expect vector drawing, 
masking and other complex design tools, this 
interface will nonetheless feel quite familiar if 
you’re a Sketch, Adobe XD or Figma user (in fact, 
we’ll discuss importing higher-fidelity designs 
from Sketch in a moment). What you can expect is 
zooming, aligning, grouping, basic visual design 
tools, mouse controls such as dragging, resizing and 
rotating, and a few handy keyboard shortcuts.
However, Marvel isn’t only for designers. While it 
may require a designer to create the final design in 
an industry-standard design app, ideas should (and 
do) come from all kinds of stakeholders (managers, 
clients, developers, and so on).
No matter what your primary role is in a team, it 
should be super-easy to say: “Hey, could this be an 
idea?”, and then demonstrate that visually. Marvel’s 
POP (https://marvelapp.com/pop/) mobile app reduces 
the barrier of entry even further by bringing these 
simplified design tools to mobile devices, because 
let’s face it, ideas can come to us at the strangest 
of times. Ideas sketched on paper can be converted 
to an interactive Marvel screen using the device 
camera. Design needs to be a democratised, where 
anybody can have a say without being restricted to 
using complex design applications.
INTEGRATE MARVEL WITH SKETCH
After productively brainstorming low-fidelity ideas 
with your team, you’ll want to mock up the first 
iteration in your design app of choice. While you 
can totally upload exported PNG screens from any 
design app, Sketch is the recommended app because 
there’s a dedicated Sketch Plugin that automates the 
process (and even readies the design so that it can be 
inspected by developers later on). Photoshop support 
for design handoff will come later, however Adobe 
isn’t touting Photoshop for user interface design 
anymore, since it created Adobe XD.
From the dashboard, click Settings>Integrations> 
Sketch Plugin, then Download Plugin. Once you have

from the Start screen
Middle Once you’ve picked 
your project, click one of 
two buttons to start the

it installed, and your design file open, hit the Sync 
Selected or Sync All buttons in the Marvel bar (this 
appears above the layer list) to begin choosing a 
Marvel Project to sync the screens into.
You can hit those sync buttons whenever you make 
a change to the design in Sketch and want to sync 
them into Marvel and, when you start to make your 
prototype interactive in Marvel, you can hit the Play 
icon to test your prototype directly in Sketch!
Note: in the examples shown here, we’re using a 
sample Sketch file (https://marvelapp.com/sketch/) that 
comes from Marvel.
PROTOTYPING INTERACTIONS
But of course we can’t test prototypes if we haven’t 
added any interactions to them, so let’s do that now. 
Moving back to the Marvel dashboard, where you’ll 
see the screens that we synced, click View on any one 
of the screens to enter screen mode.
From here we can still navigate through the 
screens using the left and right arrows on either 
side of the window, click Timer to have Marvel cycle 
through the screens after [x] amount of seconds 
(useful for presentations!), or click No Comments to 
add your first comment or annotation on the screen.
Just FYI: it’s highly-recommended that teams 
use this comment system (especially during the 
low-fidelity brainstorming stage) to discuss ideas 
and offer feedback, as this will improve the user 
experience of the final outcome exponentially. 
Making a comment in Marvel is as easy as making a 
comment on Facebook, enabling designers to collect 
feedback from virtually anyone.
Probably the first thing you’ll notice is the Fixed 
Header and Fixed Footer buttons that appear near 
the top-left and bottom-left corners of the screen 
respectively. These buttons are draggable, and they 
can also be moved to mark the cutoff region of a 
header section that is to stay fixed to the top of a 
scrollable viewport. You can also use the text fields 
in the top-right and bottom-right corner to specify 
this value manually.
But how do we actually link one screen to another? 
Simple; with the mouse, drag-select a region on the 
screen that is to link to another screen (this is called 
a ‘hotspot’). Once you’ve done that, an interface will 
appear at the bottom of the window that enables 
you to customise where the user is taken to, any 
transition that happens during the interaction, and 
what gesture is required to activate that interaction 
(tap, swipe etc).
And of course, we can use these prototyping 
tools even on low-fidelity mockups. In fact, it’s 
recommended that you do, all the while using the 
commenting features to discuss and reiterate.
HANDING OFF DESIGNS TO DEVELOPERS
When your team retains full confidence in the 
final design, validated using the commenting and 
user testing tools, it’s time to hand it over to the 
developers who can then inspect and code. It’s 
important to remember that a designer isn’t ‘done’ 
once the design is handed over, and that designers 
and developers should always communicate in 
harmony to oversee the development until its 
completion. The developer may also have some 
questions, so those commenting features should still 
be very much active.
Hit the Play button, then click Handoff in the 
bottom-left corner to open the design handoff 
interface. From here, developers will be able to click 
on the design elements and inspect the individual

styles that make them what they are, using the 
sidebar on the right-hand side (much like the 
inspector interface in Sketch, Figma or Adobe XD). 
The only difference here is that developers are able 
to click on the Copy button to copy the styles as code 
to the clipboard!
When not focused on any specific element, the 
developer is able to clearly see an overview of all 
colours and assets used in the design; assets that can 
be exported and used in the codebase of the website 
or app that’s being designed, without developers 
having to open up a design application like Sketch, 
and without designers needing to send over these 
assets old-school style.
Design handoff bridges the gap between designer 
and developer, where the styles can be extracted as 
CSS code (for web), Swift code (for iOS), and Android 
code (for, well, Android!). Better yet, developers 
can measure the distance between two objects to 
eliminate the need for guesswork. With handoff, 
absolutely everything is implemented right down 
to the very last detail. Design handoff is a feature 
awarded to enterprise teams, along with unlimited 
users, advanced security, Single Sign-On (SSO), 
priority support and a dedicated account manager.
If you’re ever offline and you want to test your 
prototype (or send it to a stakeholder who is neither 
a Sketch or Marvel user), click the Download button 
in the Marvel dashboard to install it on iOS, Android, 
desktop computers, or even as a PDF.
If you want to make the app design even more 
realistic, click the App icon screen in the dashboard 
to upload an icon that will be viewable on the home 
screen of the tester’s device.
Even though you can test interactions in Sketch, 
you’ll find it far more convenient to test them 
where you make them. You just have to hit the Play 
button anytime and anywhere to open up the app in 
a ‘mockup’ device frame, although you might find 
that the Marvel iOS application is better for testing 
because you’ll be able to navigate the screens using 
thumbs and gestures. This essentially makes it 
possible for you to test the user experience in a more 
realistic environment.
You’ll want to request feedback every step of the 
way. Click Share from the dashboard to invite others 
to comment on designs (even if they don’t have a 
Marvel account), or click People from the menu to 
invite stakeholders to collaborate.
From the Share interface you can share via email/
SMS, create a sharelink, or embed the prototype in a 
website as an iframe, or you can even connect Marvel 
to Lookback (https://lookback.io/) to set up a rather 
elaborate user testing workflow.

Accessibility
Building blocks of artificial intelligence, 
powered by machine learning and neural 
networks, are changing the way people with 
disabilities go about their lives. It changes how they 
communicate and interact with the world around 
them. Because we integrate these bricks, we have the 
power to improve the experience people have, using 
our sites and applications.
As we’re jumping on the AI bandwagon, how can 
we leverage the technology to ease the development 
of the next generation of products? And in doing so, 
how can we ensure no prejudice is caused to those 
who use the web differently? Visual information not 
described in text is perhaps the most commonly 
reported type of issue a blind person can run into on 
the web. But what if we no longer needed to bother? 
What if the technology handled it on its own?
Consider Facebook’s implementation of DeepMask, 
for instance. These building blocks of artificial 
intelligence are trained to be able to recognise 
composition of images. They generate alt text 
attributes that read “image may contain”ĝ, along with 
a series of keywords based on what the AI recognises 
in the images. Facebook has been using it for over 18 
months now, and with good results. Facebook’s AI 
research division open sourced its image recognition 
software soon after, so that others could contribute 
to advancing the technology as well. All the time 
the accuracy of the AI improves, we can imagine 
the need of planning for alt text to become less of a 
concern over time.
Likewise, OpenFace is a joint effort to provide 
open-source facial recognition with deep neural 
networks. Designed to address the challenge of 
password recollection, this technology relies on 
pictures of a person’s face to recognise the same 
face in a variety of contexts, settings and lighting 
conditions. Of all the implementations that were 
recently advertised, the two most popular probably 
are Apple’s Face ID and Windows’ Hello. As 
AI-powered facial recognition begins to weed out 
bots, another notorious barrier to accessibility will 
disappear from your products. Facial recognition 
might be the CAPTCHA killer we’ve been waiting for.
These examples are the tip of the AI iceberg. 
Artificial intelligence will never fully replace the 
need to care about accessibility, but it will handle 
some of the work. It will make our jobs building 
accessible products easier. It will help move the web 
towards more digital inclusion.
