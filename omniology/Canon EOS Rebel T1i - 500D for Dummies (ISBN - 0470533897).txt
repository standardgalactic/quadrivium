Introduction
I
n 2003, when Canon introduced the very first under-$1,000 digital SLR 
camera, the EOS Digital Rebel/300D, it revolutionized the camera scene. 
For the first time, photography enthusiasts could enjoy the benefits of digital 
SLR photography without breaking the bank. And even at the then-unheard-
of price, the camera delivered exceptional performance and picture quality, 
earning it rave reviews and multiple industry awards. No wonder it quickly 
became a best seller.
That tradition of excellence and value lives on in the EOS Rebel T1i/500D. 
Like its ancestors, this baby offers the range of advanced controls that 
experienced photographers demand plus an assortment of tools designed to 
help beginners to be successful as well. Adding to the fun, this camera also 
brings a brand new feature to the Rebel line: the option to record short, high-
definition digital movies.
This Rebel is so feature-packed, in fact, that it can be a challenge to sort 
everything out, especially if you’re new to digital photography, SLR photo-
graphy, or both. For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR means or 
how it affects your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the other 
techie terms you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aperture, 
white balance, format, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may 
be so overwhelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet 
ventured beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. And that’s a shame 
because it’s sort of like buying a Porsche and never actually taking it on 
the road.
Therein lies the point of Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D For Dummies. Through 
this book, you can discover not just what each bell and whistle on your 
camera does, but also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. 
Unlike many photography books, this one doesn’t require any previous 
knowledge of photography or digital imaging to make sense of things, either. 
In classic For Dummies style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand 
language, with lots of illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Canon picture-taking 
powerhouse. Whether your interests lie in taking family photos, exploring 
nature and travel photography, or snapping product shots for your business, 
you’ll get the information you need to capture the images you envision.

Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D For Dummies 
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your 
Rebel T1i/500D:
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to 
get the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure 
modes, including Portrait, Sports, and Landscape modes. It also features 
the new Creative Auto mode, which makes it easy for you to take a little 
more artistic control over your photos.
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality,” introduces you to one setting 
that’s critical whether you shoot in automatic or manual mode: the 
Quality setting, which affects resolution (pixel count), file format, file 
size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie 
Mode” explains how to review your pictures on the camera monitor, 
delete unwanted images, and protect your favorites from accidental era-
sure. In addition, this chapter introduces you to Live View shooting, in 
which you can use your monitor as a viewfinder, and explains your cam-
era’s movie-recording features.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your camera 
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three 
critical exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This 

3
 Introduction
chapter also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, 
Av, M, and A-DEP), explains exposure options such as metering mode 
and exposure compensation, and offers tips for using the built-in flash.
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Look here for information about 
your camera’s automatic and manual focusing features as well as 
details about color controls such as white balance and the Picture Style 
options.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes, 
close-ups, and more.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your 
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage 
device. Just as important, this chapter explains how to organize and 
safeguard your photo files. 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Photos,” helps you turn your digi-
tal files into “hard copies,” covering both retail and do-it-yourself print-
ing options. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for 
online sharing and, for times when you have the neighbors over, how to 
display your pictures on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks,” shows you how to fix less-
than-perfect images using the free software provided with your camera. 
You can find out how to remove red-eye, adjust color and exposure, 
crop your photos, and more.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” 
presents information about some camera features that, while not found 
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My Rebel T1i/500D” lists, are none-
theless interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.

Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D For Dummies 
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring:
 
I apply this icon either to introduce information that’s especially worth 
storing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that may 
have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
 
When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone that 
can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
 
Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photo-
graphy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful 
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.
 
A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or some 
other valuable resource, including your sanity.
Additionally, I need to point out a few other details that will help you use this 
book:
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons and 
onscreen graphics also appear in the margins of some paragraphs and in 
some tables. I include these to provide a quick reminder of the appear-
ance of the button or option being discussed.
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose 
File➪Print,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the Print com-
mand on the menu.
 
✓ Camera firmware: Firmware is the internal software that controls many 
of your camera’s operations. This book was written using version 1.0.9 
of the firmware, which was the most current at the time of publication.
 
 Occasionally, Canon releases firmware updates, and it’s a good idea to 
check the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) periodically to find out 
whether any updates are available. (Chapter 1 tells you how to deter-
mine which firmware version your camera is running.) Firmware updates 
typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re mostly used to 
solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you do download an 
update, be sure to read the accompanying description of what it accom-
plishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary.

 Introduction
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and edit-
ing tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover 
file downloading, organizing, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Canon 
EOS Utility along with Canon ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows users) and 
ImageBrowser (for Mac users). These programs are part of the free software 
suite that ships with your camera.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in these programs work very 
similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the steps 
to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your software 
manual for details, of course.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire.
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book.

Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D For Dummies 

Part I
Fast Track to 
Super Snaps

In this part . . .
M
aking sense of all the controls on your 
Rebel T1i/500D isn’t something you can do 
in an afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even 
a month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t 
take great pictures today. By using your camera’s 
point-and-shoot automatic modes, you can cap-
ture terriﬁ c images with very little effort. All you 
do is compose the scene, and the camera takes 
care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage 
of your camera’s automatic features and also 
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁ nder to your eyesight and getting 
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and 
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain 
how to obtain the very best picture quality, 
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual 
mode, how to review your photos, and how to use 
your camera’s Live View and movie-making 
features.

▶ Customizing basic camera operations
I
 still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my point-and-shoot camera, but I 
was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy sported several 
unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the explanations in the 
camera manual clearly were written for someone with an 
engineering degree. And there was the whole business 
of attaching the lens to the camera, an entirely new 
task for me. I saved my pennies a long time for that 
camera — what if my inexperience caused me to 
damage the thing before I even shot my first 
pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Rebel 
T1i/500D is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve 
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. 
If your Rebel is both your first SLR and first digital 
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated 
as its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of 
this chapter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly 
become as comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are 
with the ones on your car’s dashboard.

10
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using an 
SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, and navigating your camera’s 
internal menus. Finally, the end of the chapter walks you through options 
that enable you to customize many aspects of your camera’s basic operation.
 
Before you start exploring this chapter, be sure that you fully charge your 
camera battery and then install it into the battery chamber on the bottom of 
the camera. I’m guessing that you already took this step, but if not and you 
need help, the front part of the camera manual provides details.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to 
a super-long telephoto, for example. Additionally, an SLR lens has a movable 
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying 
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism. 
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background 
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next three 
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical 
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Your camera can accept two categories of Canon lenses: those with an EF-S 
design and those with a plain-old EF design.
 
The EF stands for electro focus; the S, for short back focus. And no, you don’t 
need to remember what the abbreviation stands for — just make sure that if 
you buy a Canon lens other than the one sold with the camera, it carries 
either the EF or EF-S specification. (The letters are part of the lens name; for 
example, the kit lens name is EF-S 18-55mm IS, with the IS standing for image 
stabilization, a feature explained later in this chapter.) If you want to buy a 
non-Canon lens, check the lens manufacturer’s Web site to find out which 
lenses work with the Rebel T1i/500D.
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Remove the cap at covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
3. Locate the proper lens mounting index on the camera body.
 
 A mounting index is simply a marker that tells you where to align the 
lens with the camera body when connecting the two. Your camera has 
two of these markers, one red and one white, as shown in Figure 1-1.
 
 Which marker you use to align your lens depends on the lens type:
 
• Canon EF-S lens: The white square is the mounting index.
 
• Canon EF lens: The red dot is the mounting index.
 
 If you buy a non-Canon lens, check the lens manual for help with this 
step.
 
4. Align the mounting index on the lens with the correct one on the 
camera body.
 
 The lens also has a mounting index; Figure 1-2 shows the one that 
appears on the so-called “kit lens” — the EF-S 18–55mm IS (image stabi-
lizer) zoom lens that Canon sells as a unit with the Rebel T1i/500D. If you 
buy a different lens, the index marker may be red or some other color, 
so again, check the lens instruction manual.

lens type.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
5. Keeping the mounting 
indexes aligned, position 
the lens on the camera’s 
lens mount.
 
 When you do so, grip the 
lens by its back collar as 
shown in the figure.
 
6. Turn the lens in a clockwise 
direction until the lens 
clicks into place.
 
 In other words, turn the 
lens toward the lens-release 
button (see Figure 1-1), as 
indicated by the red arrow 
in Figure 1-2.
 
Always attach (or switch) lenses 
in a clean environment to reduce 
the risk of getting dust, dirt, and 
other contaminants inside the 
camera or lens. Changing lenses 
on a sandy beach, for example, 
isn’t a good idea. For added safety, 
point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver, as 
shown in the figure. Doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being 
drawn into the camera by gravity.
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Locate the lens-release button on the front of the camera.
 
 I labeled the button in Figure 1-1.
 
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
 
 In other words, hold onto the stationary part of the lens that’s closest to 
the camera body.
 
3. Press the lens-release button while turning the lens away from the 
lens-release button.
 
 You should feel the lens release from the mount at this point. Lift the 
lens off the mount to remove it.
 
4. Place the rear protective cap onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount 
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.

the mounting indexes aligned.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Using an IS (image stabilizer) lens
The 18–55mm lens sold with the Rebel T1i/500D camera offers image stabiliza-
tion. On Canon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials IS in the lens name.
Image stabilization attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and 
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. Camera 
shake is a problem because it can result in blurry images, even when your 
focus is dead-on. Although image stabilization can’t work miracles, it does 
enable most people to capture sharper handheld shots in many situations 
than they otherwise could.
 
However, when you use a tripod, image stabilization can have detrimental 
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually 
occurring. Although this problem shouldn’t be an issue with most Canon IS 
lenses, if you do see blurry images while using a tripod, try setting the 
Stabilizer switch (shown in Figure 1-3) to Off. You also can save battery 
power by turning off image stabilization when you use a tripod.

14
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
If you use a non-Canon lens, the image stabilization feature may go by 
another name: anti-shake, vibration compensation, and so on. In some cases, 
the manufacturers may recommend that you leave the system turned on or 
select a special setting when you use a tripod, so be sure to check the lens 
manual for information.
 
Whatever type of lens you use, note that image stabilization isn’t meant to 
eliminate the blur that can occur when your subject moves during the expo-
sure. That problem is related to shutter speed, a topic you can explore in 
Chapter 5. Chapter 6 offers more tips for blur-free shots and explains focal 
length and its effect on your pictures.
Shifting from autofocus to manual focus
Like any modern camera, yours offers autofocusing capabilities. Your Rebel 
T1i/500D offers an excellent autofocusing system, which you can find out 
how to exploit to its best advantage in Chapter 6. With some subjects, how-
ever, autofocusing can be slow or impossible, which is why your camera also 
offers manual focusing.
You make the shift from auto to manual focus as follows:
 
1. Locate the AF/MF switch on the side of the lens.
 
 This switch sets the focus operation to either auto (AF) or manual (MF). 
Figure 1-3 shows you the switch as it appears on the Rebel T1i/500D kit 
lens. The switch should be in a similar location on other Canon lenses. 
If you use a lens from another manufacturer, check the lens instruction 
manual.
 
2. Set the switch to the MF position, as shown in the figure.
 
3. Look through the viewfinder and twist the focusing ring until your 
subject comes into focus.
 
 On the kit lens, the focusing ring is at the far end of the lens barrel, as 
indicated in Figure 1-3. If you use another lens, the focusing ring may be 
located elsewhere, so check your lens manual.
 
 If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. (For the kit lens, the minimum 
close-focus range is about 10 inches; for other lenses, check the specifi-
cations in the lens manual.) You also may need to adjust the viewfinder 
to accommodate your eyesight; see the next section for details.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
Some lenses enable you to use autofocusing to set the initial focusing point 
and then fine-tune focus manually. Check your lens manual for information 
on how to use this option, if available. (It’s not offered on the kit lens.)
Zooming in and out
If you bought a zoom lens, it sports a movable zoom barrel. On the kit 
lens, the barrel is just behind the focusing ring, as shown in Figure 1-3, but 
again, the relative positioning of the two components depends on your lens. 
Whatever the lens model, though, you rotate the lens barrel to zoom.
The numbers around the edge of the zoom barrel, by the way, represent 
focal lengths. I explain focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note 
that when the lens is mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with 
the white focal-length indicator, labeled in Figure 1-3, represents the current 
focal length. In Figure 1-3, for example, the focal length is 55mm.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Perched on the top-right edge of the viewfinder is a tiny black knob, labeled 
in Figure 1-4. Officially known as a dioptric adjustment control, this knob 
enables you to adjust the magnification of the viewfinder to mesh with your 
eyesight.

16
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight is critical: If you don’t, scenes that 
appear out-of-focus through the viewfinder may actually be sharply focused 
through the lens, and vice versa.
Follow these steps to adjust your viewfinder:
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the focusing screen 
shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
 
 The focusing screen is the collective name assigned to the group of nine 
autofocus points that appears in the viewfinder — the little squares with 
the dots inside. I labeled one of the little guys in Figure 1-4. (The circle 
that surrounds the center autofocus point is related to exposure meter-
ing, a subject you can explore in Chapter 5.)
 
3. Rotate the viewfinder adjustment knob until the autofocus points 
appear to be in focus.
 
 Don’t worry about focusing the actual picture now; just pay attention to 
the sharpness of the autofocus points.
 
If your eyesight is such that you can’t get the autofocus points to appear 
sharp by using the dioptric adjustment control, you can buy an additional 
eyepiece adapter. This accessory, which you pop onto the eyepiece, enables 
further adjustment of the viewfinder display. Prices range from about $15–$30 
depending on the magnification you need. Look for an adapter called an 
E-series dioptric adjustment lens.
One other note about the viewfinder: See that little black window underneath 
the viewfinder — the one labeled Display Off sensor in Figure 1-4? When you 
put your eye up to the viewfinder, the sensor tells the camera to turn off the 
monitor display, saving you the trouble of doing the job yourself. If the moni-
tor doesn’t turn off automatically, the upcoming section “Setup Menu 1” tells 
you how to fix things; see the information related to the LCD Auto Off feature.
 
Keep in mind, too, that with the T1i/500D, you can opt to use the monitor 
instead of the viewfinder to frame and preview your shots. This feature is 
called Live View shooting. Because many of the functions connected with 
Live View shooting are similar to those you use during picture playback, I 
cover both uses of your monitor together in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 and 6 
spell out some additional details of setting exposure and focus in Live 
View mode.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on 
memory cards. Your Rebel T1i/500D uses a specific type of memory card 
called an SD card (for Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. You can 
also use high-capacity SD cards, which carry the label SDHC. (The high-
capacity part just means that you can store more files on these cards than 
on regular SD cards.)
 
For movie recording, Canon recommends that you purchase a high-capacity 
card that carries an SD speed class rating of 6 or higher. This number refers 
to how quickly data can be written to and read from the card. A higher-speed 
card helps ensure the smoothest movie recording and playback.
Whatever the speed or capacity, safeguarding your memory cards — and the 
images on them — requires a few precautions:
 
✓ Inserting a card: Turn the 
camera off and then put the 
card in the card slot with the 
label facing the back of the 
camera, as shown in Figure 1-5. 
Push the card into the slot until 
it clicks into place.
 
✓ Formatting a card: The first 
time you use a new memory 
card, take a few seconds to 
format it by choosing the Format 
option on Setup Menu 1. This 
step ensures that the card is 
properly prepared to record 
your pictures. See the upcoming 
section “Setup Menu 1” for 
details.
 
✓ Removing a card: First, check 
the status of the memory card 
access light, labeled in Figure 
1-5. After making sure that the 
light is off, indicating that the 
camera has finished recording 
your most recent photo, turn the camera off. Open the memory card 
door, as shown in Figure 1-5. Depress the memory card slightly until you 
hear a little click and then let go. The card should pop halfway out of the 
slot, enabling you to grab it by the tail and remove it.

facing the camera back.

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Handling cards: Don’t touch 
the gold contacts on the back 
of the card. (See the left card in 
Figure 1-6.) When cards aren’t 
in use, store them in the protec-
tive cases they came in or in a 
memory card wallet. Keep cards 
away from extreme heat and 
cold as well.
 
✓ Locking cards: The tiny switch 
on the left side of the card, 
labeled lock switch in Figure 
1-6, enables you to lock your 
card, which prevents any data 
from being erased or recorded 
to the card. Press the switch 
toward the bottom of the card 
to lock the card contents; press 
it toward the top of the card to 
unlock the data.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and 
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your 
photos, and perform various other operations. 
Later chapters discuss all of your camera’s functions in detail and provide 
the exact steps to follow to access those functions. The next three sections 
provide a basic road map to the external controls plus a quick introduction 
to each.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins on the top-right side of the camera, shown in 
Figure 1-7. 
The items of note here are
 
✓ On/Off switch: Okay, I’m pretty sure you already figured this one out, 
but just move the switch to On to fire up the camera and then back to 
Off to shut it down.

Paws off!

on the card.

19
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 By default, the camera 
automatically shuts itself 
off after 30 seconds of 
inactivity to save battery 
power. To wake up the 
camera, press the shutter 
button halfway or press 
the Menu, DISP, or Play-
back buttons. You can 
adjust the auto shutdown 
timing via Setup Menu 1, 
covered later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Mode dial: Rotate this 
dial to select an exposure 
mode, which determines 
whether the camera oper-
ates in fully automatic, 
semi-automatic, or manual 
exposure mode when you 
take still pictures. To shoot 
a movie, you set the dial to 
Movie mode.
 
 Canon categorizes the various modes into zones:
 
• Image Zone: The camera offers six Image Zone settings designed to 
make it easy to automatically capture specific types of scenes — 
Portrait mode for people pics, Sports mode for action shots, and 
so on. (Chapter 2 explains all six.)
 
• Basic Zone: The Basic Zone category includes the six Image Zone 
settings plus Full Auto mode and Creative Auto mode, also covered 
in Chapter 2.
 
• Creative Zone: The Creative Zone category includes the advanced 
exposure modes, (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP), which I introduce in 
Chapter 5.
 
 Movie mode is apparently outside the zoning limits, as it stands on its 
own, with no zone moniker.
 
 If you ask me, keeping track of all these zones is a little confusing, 
especially because the modes in the Image Zone category are often 
referred to generically in photography discussions as creative scene 
modes or creative modes. So, to keep things a little simpler, I use the 
generic terms fully automatic exposure modes to refer to all the Basic 
Zone modes and advanced exposure modes to refer to the Creative 
Mode dial
Shutter button
Main dial
ISO button
Red-eye reduction/
self-timer lamp
Figure 1-7: The tiny pictures on the Mode dial 
represent special automatic shooting modes.

20
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Zone modes. For Creative Auto mode, which straddles the line between 
fully automatic and advanced, I use its full name to avoid inserting my 
own bit of confusion into the mix.
 
✓ Main dial: Just forward of the Mode dial, you see a black dial that has 
the official name Main dial. You use this dial when selecting many 
camera settings (specifics are provided throughout the book). In fact, it 
plays such an important role that you’d think it might have a more aus-
picious name, but Main dial it is.
 
✓ ISO button: During normal, still photography, this button provides one 
way to access the camera’s ISO speed setting, which determines how 
sensitive the camera is to light. Chapter 5 details this critical exposure 
setting. When you’re shooting movies, pressing the button instead initi-
ates AE Lock, a feature that locks autoexposure at its current setting. 
Check out Chapter 4 for details.
 
✓ Shutter button: You probably already understand the function of this 
button, too. But see Chapter 2 to discover the proper shutter-button-
pressing technique — you’d be surprised how many people mess up 
their pictures because they press that button incorrectly.
 
✓ Red-Eye Reduction/Self-Timer Lamp: When you set your flash to Red-
Eye Reduction mode, this little lamp emits a brief burst of light prior to 
the real flash — the idea being that your subjects’ pupils will constrict 
in response to the light, thus lessening the chances of red-eye. If you use 
the camera’s self-timer feature, the lamp blinks to provide you with a 
visual countdown to the moment at which the picture will be recorded. 
See Chapter 2 for more details about Red-Eye Reduction flash mode and 
the self-timer function.
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back, you encounter a smorgas-
bord of buttons — 13, in fact, not including the viewfinder adjustment knob, 
discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 1-8 gives you a look at the layout of 
backside controls.
 
Don’t let the abundance of buttons intimidate you. Having all of those exter-
nal controls actually makes operating your camera easier. On cameras that 
have only a few buttons, you have to dig through menus to access the 
camera features, which is a pain. But you can access almost every critical 
shooting setting on your camera via external buttons, which is much more 
convenient.

21
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
Set button and
cross keys
 
Figure 1-8: Having lots of external buttons makes accessing the camera’s 
 
functions easier.
Throughout this book, pictures of some of these buttons appear in the mar-
gins to help you locate the button being discussed. So even though I provide 
the official control names in the following list, don’t worry about getting all of 
those straight right now. The list I provide here is just to get you acquainted 
with the possibility of what you can accomplish with all of these features.
 
Do note, however, that many of the buttons have multiple names because 
they serve multiple purposes depending on whether you’re taking pictures, 
reviewing images, or performing some other function. In this book, I refer to 
these buttons by the first label you see in the following list to simplify things. 
For example, I refer to the AF Point Selection/Magnify button as the AF Point 
Selection button. Again, though, the margin icons help you know exactly 
which button I’m describing.
And here’s another tip: If the label or icon for a button is blue, it indicates a 
function related to viewing, printing, or downloading images. Labels that indi-
cate a shooting-related function are white, and the sole red label indicates a 
button purpose related to Live View and movie shooting.

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
With that preamble out of the way, journey with me now over the camera 
back, starting at the top-right corner and working westward (well, assuming 
that your lens is pointing north, anyway):
 
 
✓ AF Point Selection/Magnify button: When you use certain advanced 
shooting modes, you press this button to specify which of the nine auto-
focus points you want the camera to use when establishing focus. Chapter 
6 tells you more. In Playback, Live View, and Movie mode, you use the 
button to magnify the image display (thus the plus sign in the button’s 
magnifying glass icon). See Chapter 4 for help with that function.
 
 
✓ AE Lock/FE Lock/Index/Reduce button: As you can guess from the 
official name of this button, it serves many purposes. The first two are 
related to still-image capture functions: You use the button to lock in the 
autoexposure (AE) settings and to lock flash exposure (FE). Chapter 5 
details both issues. When using Live View and Movie modes, the button 
serves as the autofocus and autoexposure trigger.
 
 The button also serves two image-viewing functions: It switches the 
display to Index mode, enabling you to see multiple image thumbnails at 
once, and it reduces the magnification of images when displayed one at 
a time. Chapter 4 explains Playback, Live View, and Movie modes.
 
 
✓ Exposure Compensation/Aperture button: When you work in M 
(manual) exposure mode, you press this button and rotate the Main dial 
to choose the aperture setting, better known as the f-stop. In the other 
advanced exposure modes, you instead use the button and dial to apply 
Exposure Compensation, a feature that enables you to adjust the expo-
sure selected by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. Chapter 5 dis-
cusses both issues.
 
 
✓ Live View/Movie/Print/Share button: You press this button to shift the 
camera into Live View mode and, when shooting movies, to start and 
stop recording. (For the latter, you must first set the Mode dial to Movie 
mode.) Chapter 4 offers the pertinent details. This button is also 
involved when you transfer images to your computer or print pictures 
directly from the camera; check out Chapters 8 and 9 for information 
about those topics.
 
✓ Set button and cross keys: Figure 1-8 points out the Set button and the 
four surrounding buttons, known as cross keys. These buttons team 
up to perform several functions, including choosing options from the 
camera menus. You use the cross keys to navigate through menus and 
then press the Set button to select a specific menu setting. You can find 
out more about ordering from menus later in this chapter.
 
 In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” means to press 
the one that sports the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up cross key” 
means to press the one with the up-pointing arrowhead, and so on. 

23
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 The cross keys and the Set button also have non-menu responsibilities, 
as follows: 
 
• After displaying the Shooting Settings screen, press the Set button to 
shift to the Quick Control screen. The Quick Control screen is just 
one option for adjusting picture-taking settings; get the full story 
in the upcoming section “Taking Advantage of the Quick Control 
screen.”
 
• Press the right cross key to adjust the AF mode. This option controls 
the camera’s autofocus behavior, as outlined in Chapter 6.
 
• Press the left cross key to change the Drive mode. The Drive mode 
settings enable you to switch the camera from single-frame shoot-
ing to continuous capture or self-timer/remote-control shooting. 
See Chapter 2 for details.
 
• Press the down cross key to change the Picture Style. Chapter 6 
explains Picture Styles, which you can use to adjust color, con-
trast, and sharpness of your pictures.
 
• Press the up cross key to change the White Balance setting. The 
White Balance control, explained near the end of Chapter 6, 
enables you to ensure that your photo colors are accurate and not 
biased by the color of the light source.
 
 You can customize the function of the Set button; Chapter 11 explains 
how. But while you’re working with this book, stick with the default 
setup, just described. Otherwise, the instructions I give won’t work.
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture-
review mode. Chapter 4 details playback features.
 
 
✓ Erase button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for delete, 
this button lets you erase pictures from your memory card. Chapter 4 
has specifics. In Live View and Movie mode, also covered in Chapter 4, 
this button is involved in the focusing process.
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to access the camera menus. See the 
next section for details on navigating menus.
 
✓ DISP button: The Shooting Settings display, covered later in this chap-
ter, appears automatically on the monitor when you turn on the camera. 
The screen shuts off after a period of inactivity, after which you can 
bring it back to life by either pressing the DISP button or pressing the 
shutter button halfway and then releasing it.
 
 But that’s just the start of the DISP button’s tricks. If the camera menus 
are displayed, pressing the button takes you to the Camera Settings dis-
play, explained in the upcoming section “Viewing and Adjusting Camera 
Settings.” In Playback, Live View, and Movie modes, pressing the button 
changes the picture-display style, as outlined in Chapter 4.

Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, you find three more buttons, all 
labeled in Figure 1-9. This trio works as follows:
 
 
✓ Flash button: Press this button to 
bring the camera’s built-in flash out 
of hiding when you use the advanced 
exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP). See Chapter 2 for help with 
using flash in the other exposure 
modes and flip to Chapters 5 and 7 
for more tips on flash photography.
 
✓ Lens-release button: Press this 
button to disengage the lens from 
the lens mount so that you can 
remove it from the camera. See the 
first part of this chapter for details 
on mounting and removing lenses.
 
✓ Depth-of-Field Preview button: 
When you press this button, the 
image in the viewfinder offers an 
approximation of the depth of field 
that will result from your selected 
aperture setting, or f-stop. Depth of 
field refers to how much of the scene 
will be in sharp focus. Chapter 6 pro-
vides details on depth of field, which 
is an important aspect of your pic-
ture composition. Chapter 5 explains 
aperture and other exposure settings.
Viewing and Adjusting Camera Settings
You’ve no doubt already deduced that your Rebel T1i/500D is loaded with 
options. It also gives you several ways to monitor the current settings and 
to adjust them if needed. The next sections provide just a quick introduction 
to viewing and changing settings; in later chapters, I explain and illustrate 
exactly how and where to access individual options. (Note, too, that the 
information here relates to regular shooting modes — if you switch to Live 
View or Movie mode, things work differently. You can get the scoop on those 
two modes in Chapter 4.)

Ordering from menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, con-
veniently enough, appear on the monitor when you press the Menu button, 
located atop the upper-left corner of the camera back. Features are grouped 
into nine menus, described briefly in Table 1-1. 
 
In case you didn’t notice, the icons that represent the menus are color coded. 
Shooting Menus 1 and 2 have red icons, as does the Movie menu; Setup 
Menus 1, 2, and 3 sport yellow icons; the Playback menus have a blue 
symbol; and the My Menu icon is green. (Chapter 11 explains the My Menu 
feature, through which you can create your own, custom menu.)

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
After you press the Menu button, a screen similar to the one shown on the 
left in Figure 1-10 appears. Along the top of the screen, you see the icons 
shown in Table 1-1, each representing a menu. (Remember that which icons 
appear depends on the setting of the Mode dial.)
The highlighted icon marks the active menu; options on that menu automati-
cally appear on the main part of the screen. In the figure, Shooting Menu 1 is 
active, for example.
 
 
Figure 1-10: Use the cross keys to navigate menus; press Set to access available settings.
 
Shooting Menu 2, Setup Menu 3, and My Menu appear in the menu display 
only when you set the Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, 
Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). Some menu items on Setup Menu 2 are hidden as well 
in the fully automatic exposure modes. The Movie menu appears only when 
you set the Mode dial to the Movie setting.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options. After pressing the Menu button to display the menus, use these 
techniques: 
 
✓ To select a different menu: Press the right or left cross keys or rotate 
the Main dial to cycle through the available menus.
 
✓ To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Press the up or 
down cross key to highlight the feature you want to adjust. On the left 
side of Figure 1-10, the Quality option is highlighted, for example. Next, 
press the Set button. Settings available for the selected item then appear 
either right next to the menu item or on a separate screen, as shown on 
the right side of the figure. Either way, use the cross keys to highlight 
your preferred setting and then press Set again to lock in your choice.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Using the Shooting Settings display
Shown in Figure 1-11, the Shooting Settings display contains the most impor-
tant critical photography settings — aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and the 
like. Note that the display is relevant only to regular still-photography shoot-
ing, though. When you switch to Live View mode or Movie mode, you can 
choose to see some settings superimposed over your image in the monitor, 
but the process of adjusting settings and customizing the display is different. 
(See Chapter 4 for details.)
The types of data shown in the 
Shooting Settings display depend on 
the exposure mode you select. The 
figure shows data that’s included 
when you work in one of the advanced 
modes, such as Tv (shutter-priority 
autoexposure). In the fully automatic 
modes as well as in Creative Auto 
mode, you see far fewer settings 
because you can control fewer set-
tings in those modes. The figure does 
label two key points of data that are 
helpful in any mode, though: how 
many more pictures can fit on your 
memory card at the current settings 
and the status of the battery. A 
“full” battery icon like the one in the 
figure shows that the battery is fully 
charged. If the icon appears empty, go 
look for your battery charger.
You can use the Shooting Settings display to both view and adjust certain 
picture-taking settings. Here’s what you need to know:
 
✓ Turning on the Shooting Settings display: The display appears briefly 
when you turn on the camera. After the display shuts off, you can turn it 
on again by pressing the DISP button or by pressing the shutter button 
halfway and then releasing it. Or, if menus are on the screen, you can use 
only the shutter-button technique to go back to the Shooting Settings dis-
play. (Pressing the DISP button in that scenario has a different result.)
 
✓ Turning off the Shooting Settings display: As soon as you put your eye 
to the viewfinder, the display turns off automatically, and the viewfinder 
display becomes active. You can also press DISP to turn the display off 
if needed. If you use the button to turn off the display, press the button 
again to bring the display back to life; pressing the shutter button half-
way doesn’t do the trick.

Figure 1-11: The Shooting Settings display 
gives you an easy way to monitor current 
picture settings.

28
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Adjusting settings: While the Shooting Settings display is active, you 
can change some shooting settings by rotating the Main dial alone or by 
using the dial in combination with one of the camera buttons.
 
 For example, in the shutter-priority autoexposure mode (Tv, on the 
Mode dial), rotating the Main dial changes the shutter speed. And if 
you press and hold the Exposure Compensation button, the Exposure 
Compensation meter becomes highlighted, as shown on the left in Figure 
1-12, and you can rotate the Main dial to adjust the setting. Release the 
button to continue shooting.
 
 Notice the tinted background and tiny curved arrows that surround the 
shutter speed value in Figure 1-11 and the Exposure Compensation 
meter in Figure 1-12? The tint indicates the active option; the curved 
arrows remind you to use the Main dial to adjust the setting.
 
 In some cases, the camera displays a screen full of options instead of the 
curved arrows when you press a control button. Pressing the ISO button 
in the advanced exposure modes, for example, takes you to the screen 
you see on the right in Figure 1-12. You can then release the button and 
either rotate the Main dial or use the cross keys to select the setting you 
want to use. Press the Set button to lock in your choice and bring back 
the full Shooting Settings display.
 
 
Figure 1-12: Pressing a control button either activates the highlighted setting (left) or takes 
 
you to a screen of available settings (right).
Taking advantage of the Quick Control screen
New to the Rebel T1i/500D is a feature called the Quick Control screen, which 
was previously offered only on Canon’s higher-end pro cameras. This feature 
enables you to change certain shooting settings without using the control 
buttons (ISO button, the Exposure Compensation button, and so on) or 
menus.

29
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
You can use this technique to adjust settings in any exposure mode, but the 
settings that are accessible depend on the mode you select. To try it out, set 
the Mode dial to Tv so that what you see on your screen will look like what 
you see in the upcoming figures. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Shooting Settings screen.
 
 Either press the shutter button halfway and then release it or press the 
DISP button.
 
2. Press the Set button.
 
 The screen now shifts into Quick Control mode, and one of the options 
on the screen becomes highlighted. The option name also appears at the 
bottom of the screen, as shown on the left in Figure 1-13. In the figure, 
the Flash Exposure Compensation setting is selected. (This particular 
option doesn’t appear on the screen until after you enter Quick Control 
mode unless you’ve previously enabled the function. See Chapter 5 for 
the full scoop.)
 
 
 
Figure 1-13: Press Set to shift to Quick Control mode; the active option appears highlighted.
 
3. Press the cross keys to move the highlight over the setting you want to 
adjust.
 
 Again, the available options depend on the exposure mode, and the 
figure shows options presented in the Tv (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure) mode.
 
4. Adjust the setting.
 
 In general, you can use either of these two techniques:
 
• Rotate the Main dial to scroll through the possible settings.

30
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
• Press Set to display a screen that contains all the possible settings. 
In some cases, the screen contains a brief explanation or note 
about the option, as shown on the right in Figure 1-13. You then 
can choose between rotating the Main dial or pressing the cross 
keys to highlight the setting you want to use. Then press Set again 
to return to the Quick Control screen.
 
 A few controls require a slightly different approach, but don’t worry — I 
spell out all the needed steps throughout the book.
 
5. To exit Quick Control mode, press the shutter button halfway and 
release it.
 
 You’re returned to the normal Shooting Settings display.
Decoding viewfinder data
When the camera is turned on, you can view critical exposure settings and 
a few other pieces of information in the viewfinder. Just put your eye to the 
viewfinder and press the shutter button halfway to activate the display. (I’m 
assuming that Live View mode, in which you use the monitor as viewfinder, 
is disabled, as it is by default. Ditto for Movie mode. See Chapter 4 for details 
about both.)
The viewfinder data changes depending on what action you’re undertaking 
and what exposure mode you’re using. For example, if you set the Mode dial 
to P (for programmed autoexposure), you see the basic set of data shown in 
Figure 1-14: shutter speed, f-stop (aperture setting), Exposure Compensation 
setting, and ISO setting. Additional data is displayed when you enable certain 
features, such as Flash Exposure Compensation.
 
Again, I detail each viewfinder readout as I explain your camera options 
throughout the book. But I want to point out now one often-confused value 
you may see: The value at the far right end of the viewfinder (9, in the 
figure) shows you the number of maximum burst frames. This number 
relates to shooting in the Continuous capture mode, where the camera fires 
off multiple shots in rapid succession as long as you hold down the shutter 
button. (Chapter 2 has details on this mode.) Note that although the high-
est number that the viewfinder can display is 9, the actual number of maxi-
mum burst frames may be higher. At any rate, you don’t really need to pay 
attention to the number until it starts dropping toward 0, which indicates 
that the camera’s memory buffer (its temporary internal data-storage tank) 
is filling up. If that happens, just give the camera a moment to catch up with 
your shutter-button finger.
While you’re looking through the viewfinder, you can adjust some shoot-
ing settings by using the Main dial alone or in conjunction with the function 
buttons, as you do with the Shooting Settings screen. For example, if you’re 

31
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
working in one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP) and 
press the ISO button, all data but the current ISO setting dims, and you can 
then rotate the Main dial to change the setting. Press the shutter button half-
way to return to the normal viewfinder display after changing the setting.

Checking the Camera Settings display
In addition to the Shooting Settings display, you can view a collection of addi-
tional settings data via the Camera Settings display, shown in Figure 1-15. This 
screen is purely an informational tool, however; you can’t actually adjust any 
of the reported settings from this screen.
To display the Camera Settings screen, first display the camera menus by 
pressing the Menu button. Then press the DISP button.
Figure 1-15 shows the settings that you can monitor when shooting in the 
advanced exposure modes. Again, that’s P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. Here are 
the details you can glean from the display, with settings listed in the order 
they appear on the screen.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Freespace: This value indicates 
how much storage space is left 
on your camera memory card. 
How many pictures you can 
fit into that space depends on 
the Quality setting you select. 
Chapter 3 explains this issue.
 
✓ Color Space: This value tells you 
whether the camera is capturing 
images in the sRGB or Adobe 
RGB color space, an advanced 
option that you can investigate 
in Chapter 6.
 
✓ White Balance Shift/Bracketing: 
Add this to the list of advanced color options covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Live View Shooting: Chapter 4 details this feature, which enables you to 
use your monitor instead of the viewfinder to compose your shots.
 
✓ Auto Sensor Cleaning and Red-Eye Reduction flash mode: (These two 
functions share a line in the screen.) See “Setup Menu 2,” later in this 
chapter, for more about automatic sensor cleaning; check out Chapter 2 
for information about Red-Eye Reduction flash mode.
 
✓ Auto Power Off and Auto Rotate: For information on these two set-
tings, which also live together on the display, see the upcoming section, 
“Setup Menu 1.”
 
✓ Beep and LCD Auto Off: The first setting determines whether the 
camera beeps after certain operations; you can adjust the setting via 
Shooting Menu 1, as explained later in this chapter. The second setting, 
covered in the section “Setup Menu 1,” controls whether the Shooting 
Settings display turns off automatically when you put your eye to the 
viewfinder.
 
✓ Date/Time: The section “Setup Menu 2” also explains how to adjust the 
date and time.
 
In the fully automatic and Creative Auto exposure modes, the Color Space, 
White Balance Shift/Bracketing, and Live View Shooting status information 
doesn’t appear in the Camera Settings display because you can’t use those 
features in those exposure modes.
Of course, with the exception of the free card space value, you also can 
simply go to the menu that contains the option in question to check its 
status. The Camera Settings display just gives you a quick way to monitor 
some of the critical functions without hunting through menus.
Figure 1-15: Press the DISP button when the 
menus are active to view this screen.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Reviewing Basic Setup Options
One of the many advantages of investing in the Rebel T1i/500D is that you 
can customize its performance to suit the way you like to shoot. Later chap-
ters explain options related to actual picture taking, such as those that affect 
flash behavior and autofocusing. The rest of this chapter details options 
related to initial camera setup, explaining how to accomplish such things as 
setting the date and time, setting up the camera’s file-numbering system, and 
adjusting monitor brightness.
Setup Menu 1
 
 At the risk of being labeled conventional, I suggest that you start your camera 
customization by opening Setup Menu 1, shown in Figure 1-16.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu item:
 
✓ Auto Power Off: To help save battery power, your camera automatically 
powers down after a certain period of inactivity. By default, the shut-
down happens after 30 seconds, but you can change the shutdown delay 
to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 15 minutes. Or you can disable auto shutdown altogether 
by selecting the Off setting.
 
✓ File Numbering: This option controls how the camera names your 
picture files. 
 
• Continuous: This is the default; the camera numbers your files 
sequentially, from 0001 to 9999, and places all images in the same 
folder. The initial folder name is 100Canon; when you reach image 
9999, the camera creates a new folder, named 101Canon, for your 
next 9,999 photos. This numbering sequence is retained even if you 
change memory cards, which helps to ensure that you don’t wind 
up with multiple images that have the same filename.
 
• Auto Reset: If you switch to this option, the camera restarts file 
numbering at 0001 each time you put in a different memory card. I 
discourage the use of this option, for the reason already stated.
 
 Whichever option you choose, beware one gotcha: If you swap out 
memory cards and the new card already contains images, the 
camera may pick up numbering from the last image on the new 
card, which throws a monkey wrench into things. To avoid this 
problem, format the new card before putting it into the camera. 
(See the upcoming Format bullet point for details.)
 
• Manual Reset: Select this setting if you want the camera to begin 
a new numbering sequence, starting at 0001, for your next shot.
The camera then returns to whichever mode you previously used 
(Continuous or Auto Reset).

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Auto Rotate: If you enable this 
feature, your picture files include 
a piece of data that indicates 
whether the camera was oriented 
in the vertical or horizontal posi-
tion when you shot the frame. 
Then, when you view the picture 
on the camera monitor or on 
your computer, the image is auto-
matically rotated to the correct 
orientation.
 
 To automatically rotate images 
both in the camera monitor and 
on your computer monitor, stick 
with the default setting. In the 
menu, this setting is represented by On followed by a camera icon and a 
monitor icon, as shown in Figure 1-16. If you want the rotation to occur 
just on your computer and not on the camera, select the second On set-
ting, which is marked with the computer monitor symbol but not the 
camera symbol. To disable rotation for both devices, choose the Off 
setting.
 
 Note, though, that the camera may record the wrong orientation data 
for pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up or down. 
Also, whether your computer can read the rotation data in the picture 
file depends on the software you use; the programs bundled with the 
camera can perform the auto rotation.
 
✓ Format: The first time you insert a new memory card, use this option to 
format the card, a maintenance function that wipes out any existing data 
on the card and prepares it for use by the camera.
 
 If you previously used your card in another device, such as a digital 
music player, be sure to copy those files to your computer before you 
format the card. You lose all data on the card when you format it, not 
just picture files.
 
 When you choose the Format option from the menu, you can opt to 
perform a normal card formatting process or a low-level formatting. The 
latter gives your memory card a deeper level of cleansing than ordinary 
formatting and thus takes longer to perform. Normally, a regular format-
ting will do.
 
✓ LCD Auto Off: When the Enable setting is selected, as it is by default, 
the camera automatically turns off the camera monitor if the Shooting 
Settings screen is displayed and you put your eye up to the camera view-
finder. (The little sensor underneath the viewfinder notes the presence 
of your eye and signals the camera to turn off the monitor.) You can 
Figure 1-16: Options on Setup Menu 1 deal 
mainly with basic camera behavior.

35
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
deactivate this feature by choosing the Disable setting if you prefer. The 
monitor is one of the biggest battery drains on the camera, however, so 
in my opinion, the auto shutoff feature is a good thing.
 
 The eye-detection thing only works when the Shooting Settings screen is 
active. So if the monitor is displaying menus or the Quick Control 
screen, press the shutter button halfway and release it to return to the 
Shooting Settings display. You then can either press DISP or put your 
eye to the viewfinder to turn off the monitor.
 
✓ Screen Color: If you don’t like the default color scheme of the Shooting 
Settings display, which is the one used for the screens shown in this 
book, you can choose from three other schemes via this menu option.
Setup Menu 2
 
 Setup Menu 2, shown in Figure 1-17, 
offers an additional batch of customi-
zation options:
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option 
enables you to make the camera 
monitor brighter or darker. After 
highlighting the option on the 
menu, as shown in Figure 1-17, 
press Set to display a screen 
similar to what you see in Figure 
1-18. The camera displays a 
picture from your memory 
card; if the card is empty, you 
see a black box instead. Press 
the right and left cross keys to 
adjust the brightness setting. 
Press Set to finish the job and 
return to the menu.
 
 If you take this step, keep in 
mind that what you see on the 
display may not be an accurate 
rendition of the actual exposure 
of your image. Crank up the 
monitor brightness, for example, 
and an underexposed photo may 
look just fine. So I recommend 
that you keep the brightness at 
the default setting, which places 
the brightness marker at dead 
Figure 1-17: Setup Menu 2 offers more ways 
to customize basic operations.
Figure 1-18: You can adjust the brightness of 
the camera monitor.

36
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
center on the little brightness scale, as shown in Figure 1-18. As an alter-
native, you can gauge exposure by displaying a tool called the histogram, 
explained in Chapter 4, when reviewing your images.
 
✓ Date/Time: When you turn on your camera for the very first time, it 
automatically displays this option and asks you to set the date and time.
 
 Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that information is 
recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, you can then 
see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for images by 
the date they were taken. Chapter 8 shows you where to locate the date/
time data when browsing your picture files.
 
✓ Language: This option determines the language of any text displayed on 
the camera monitor. Screens in this book display the English language, 
but I find it entertaining on occasion to hand my camera to a friend after 
changing the language to, say, Swedish. I’m a real yokester, yah?
 
✓ Video System: This option is related to viewing your images and movies 
on a television, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in 
North America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 
✓ Sensor Cleaning: Highlight this option and press Set to access some 
options related to the camera’s internal sensor-cleaning mechanism. 
These work like so:
 
• Auto Cleaning: By default, the camera’s sensor-cleaning mechanism 
activates each time you turn the camera on and off. This process 
helps keep the image sensor — which is the part of the camera 
that captures the image — free of dust and other particles that can 
mar your photos. You can disable this option, but I can’t imagine 
why you would choose to do so.
 
• Clean Now: Select this option and press Set to initiate a cleaning 
cycle.
 
• Clean Manually: In the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP), you can access this third option, which prepares the 
camera for manual cleaning of the sensor. I don’t recommend this 
practice; sensors are delicate, and you’re really better off taking 
the camera to a good service center for cleaning. 
 
✓ Live View Functions: This part of the menu also is available only in the 
advanced exposure modes. As the name implies, options here relate to 
Live View shooting, in which you can preview your shots in the monitor. 
Chapter 4 explains your options. 

37
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Setup Menu 3
 
 Setup Menu 3, shown in Figure 1-19, contains the following offerings, which 
you can access only in the advanced exposure modes. Again, those modes 
are P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. Chapter 5 introduces you to each mode.
 
✓ Custom Functions: Selecting this 
option opens the door to cus-
tomizing 13 camera functions, 
known as Custom Functions in 
Canon lingo. These functions 
either relate to advanced expo-
sure options or are otherwise 
designed for people with some 
photography experience. Check 
the index to find out where to 
locate details about the various 
functions.
 
✓ Clear Settings: Via this menu 
option, you can restore the 
default shooting settings. You 
also can reset all the Custom 
Functions settings to their defaults through this option. Additionally, if 
you use the provided EOS Utility software to automatically add copy-
right information to all your picture files — a topic you can explore in 
Chapter 11 — you can clear the copyright notice.
 
✓ Firmware Ver.: This screen tells you the version number of the camera 
firmware (internal operating software). At the time of publication, the 
current firmware version was 1.0.9.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Canon Web site (www.canon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. Follow the instructions given on the 
Web site to download and install updated firmware if needed.
Three more customization options
 
 Shooting Menu 1, shown in Figure 1-20, offers two more basic setup options — 
at least, these options fall into that category if you share my logic, which some 
may consider a frightening prospect. 
At any rate, these two options work as follows:
Figure 1-19: To display Setup Menu 3, you 
must set the Mode dial to an advanced 
exposure mode.

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera 
beeps after certain operations, 
such as after it sets focus when 
you use autofocusing. If you’re 
doing top-secret surveillance 
and need the camera to hush up, 
set this option to Off.
 
✓ Release Shutter without Card: 
Setting this option to Disable 
prevents shutter-button release 
when no memory card is in the 
camera. If you turn the option 
on, you can take a picture and 
then review the results for a few 
seconds in the camera monitor. 
The image isn’t stored anywhere, however; it’s temporary.
 
 If you’re wondering about the point of this option, it’s designed for use 
in camera stores, enabling salespeople to demonstrate cameras without 
having to keep a memory card in every model. Unless that feature some-
how suits your purposes, keep this option set to Disable.
 
 Adding a final level of customization choices, the My Menu feature does just 
what its name implies: You can create a personalized menu that contains up 
to six functions from the existing menus. Then, instead of hunting through all 
the other menus to find settings that you use frequently, you can access the 
settings quickly just by displaying My Menu. Chapter 11 shows you how to 
take advantage of this feature, which I happen to love a lot. Unfortunately, 
you can take advantage of My Menu only in the advanced exposure modes 
(P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP).

Shooting Menu 1.
Why does this camera have two names?
You may notice that your camera manual, as 
well as this book, refers to your camera by two 
different names— EOS Rebel T1i and EOS 500D. 
What gives? The answer is that Canon assigns 
different names to a single camera model 
depending on the part of the world where it’s 
sold.
The EOS part, by the way, stands for Electro 
Optical System, the core technology used in 
Canon’s autofocus SLR (single-lens reflex) 
cameras. According to Canon, the proper pro-
nunciation is ee-ohs, which is also how you 
pronounce the name Eos, the goddess of dawn 
in Greek mythology. 
With apologies to the goddess, I save a little 
room in this book by shortening the camera 
name to simply Rebel T1i/500D, which is already 
long enough.

A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television com-
mercials from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” 
declared one actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. 
Then a narrator declared the debate a tie and spoke 
the famous catchphrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in 
one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Rebel T1i/500D. 
On one hand, it provides a full range of powerful 
controls, offering just about every feature a serious 
photographer could want. On the other, it also offers 
fully automated exposure modes that enable people 
with absolutely no experience to capture beautiful 
images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” “It’s as 
simple as ‘point and shoot’!” “It’s two, two, two cameras 
in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with your 
camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters cover. This chapter, 
however, is devoted to your camera’s point-and-shoot side, explaining how 
to get the best results from the fully automatic exposure modes. You can also 
find details about the new Creative Auto mode in this chapter. Sort of like 
“fully automatic plus,” this mode handles most duties for you but enables 

40
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
you to control a few aspects of your pictures, such as whether flash is used 
and whether the background is softly focused or as sharp as your subject.
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
 
Your camera offers several automatic, point-and-shoot exposure modes, all of 
which I explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to 
good photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Full Auto, as shown 
in the left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the 
AF (autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. (The figure 
features the lens that is bundled with the Rebel T1i/500D. If you own a differ-
ent lens, the switch may look and operate differently; check your lens manual 
for details.)
 
Full Auto mode

Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.
 
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the Stabilizer switch to the On setting, 
as shown in Figure 2-1. This setting turns on the Image Stabilizer feature, 
which is designed to produce sharper images by compensating for camera 
movement that can occur when you handhold the camera. Again, if you use a 
lens other than the kit lens, check your lens manual for details about using its 
stabilization feature, if provided.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic 
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture:
 
1. Looking through the viewfinder, frame the image so that your subject 
appears under an autofocus point.
 
 The autofocus points are those nine tiny rectangles clustered in the 
center of the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
 
 
Figure 2-2: The tiny rectangles in the viewfinder indicate autofocus 
 
 
points.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter button halfway down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus and autoexposure meters begin to do their 
thing. In dim light, the flash may pop up if the camera thinks additional 
light is needed. Additionally, the flash may emit an AF-assist beam, a few 
rapid pulses of light designed to help the autofocusing mechanism find 
its target. (The AF stands for autofocus.)
 
 At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects 
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two criti-
cal exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; in 
Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/200 second and the f-stop is f/5.6. You 
also see the current ISO setting and the maximum burst rate. (Chapter 
5 details shutter speed, f-stops, and ISO; see Chapter 1 for information 
about the maximum burst rate.)

42
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 When focus is established, the camera beeps at you, assuming that you 
didn’t silence its voice via Shooting Menu 1, as discussed at the end of 
Chapter 1. Additionally, the focus indicator in the viewfinder lights, as 
shown in Figure 2-3, and the dot inside an autofocus point briefly turns 
red. That red dot indicates which autofocus point the camera used to 
establish focus. Sometimes multiple dots turn red, as in Figure 2-3, 
which simply tells you that all the objects within those autofocus areas 
are now in focus. The autoexposure meter continues monitoring the 
light up to the time you take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed 
values in the viewfinder may change if the light shifts. 
 
Focus light
 
 
Figure 2-3: The green light indicates that the camera has locked focus.
 
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
 
 While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, the 
memory card access lamp lights, as shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off 
the camera or remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may 
damage both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is finished, the picture appears briefly on 
the camera monitor. By default, the review period is two seconds. See 
Chapter 4 to find out how to adjust or disable the instant review and 
how to switch to Playback mode and take a longer look at your image.

43
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
I need to add a couple important notes about this process, especially related 
to Step 2:
 
✓ Solving autofocus problems: 
When you shoot in the fully 
automatic modes as well as in 
Creative Auto mode, the camera 
typically focuses on the closest 
object. If the camera insists on 
selecting an autofocus point that 
isn’t appropriate for your subject, 
the easiest solution is to switch 
to manual focusing and be done 
with it. Chapter 1 shows you how. 
Or you can use the advanced 
exposure modes, which enable 
you to select a specific autofocus 
point. Chapter 6 explains that 
option plus a few other tips for 
getting good autofocus results.
 
✓ Shooting moving subjects: If the 
focus indicator doesn’t light but 
you hear a continuous series of beeps, the camera detected motion in 
the scene and shifted to an autofocusing mode called AI Servo. (The AI 
stands for artificial intelligence.) In this mode, the camera focuses con-
tinually after you press the shutter button halfway to try to maintain 
focus on the subject. As long as you keep the subject within one of the 
autofocus points, focus should be correct. However, continuous auto-
focusing is possible only in the Full Auto, Flash Off, Creative Auto, and 
Sports modes. In the other fully automatic modes, focus is locked when 
you press the shutter button halfway. See Chapter 6 for more tips about 
this and other autofocus modes.
 
✓ Locking exposure: By default, pressing the shutter button halfway does 
not lock exposure along with focus. Your camera instead continues 
metering and adjusting exposure until you fully press the shutter button. 
If you want to lock exposure, you must use an advanced exposure mode 
and rely on the AE (autoexposure) Lock button. You also can simply 
switch the camera’s Mode dial to M, which shifts the camera to manual 
exposure mode, and then set your desired exposure settings (aperture, 
shutter speed, and ISO). Chapter 5 discusses these and other exposure 
issues.
 
✓ Changing the Drive mode setting: In most of the automatic exposure 
modes, your camera automatically sets the Drive mode to Single, which 
records a single image with each press of the shutter button. But in 
Portrait and Sports modes, the camera instead selects Continuous 
mode, which records pictures as long as you hold down the shutter 
Memory card access light

while the camera sends the picture data 
to the card.

44
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
button. Creative Auto gives you the choice of both Drive modes. And 
you can also set the Drive mode to a Self-Timer or Remote Control set-
ting for any exposure mode. See the end of this chapter for details.
 
✓ Shooting in Live View mode: You can’t use Live View mode, which 
enables you to frame your image using the camera monitor instead of the 
viewfinder, in the fully automatic modes or the Creative Auto mode. If 
you want to take advantage of Live View, you must switch to an advanced 
exposure mode (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). See Chapter 5 for details on 
those modes; Chapter 4 provides a primer on Live View shooting.
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, in either autofocus 
or manual focus mode, you determine only the 
point of sharpest focus. The distance to which 
the sharp-focus zone extends from that point — 
what photographers call the depth of field — 
depends in part on the aperture setting, or 
f-stop, which is an exposure control. Some of 
your camera’s fully automatic exposure modes 
are designed to choose aperture settings that 
produce a certain depth of field.
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — 
an artistic choice that most people prefer 
for portraits. On the flip side of the coin, the 
Landscape setting selects an aperture that pro-
duces a large depth of field so that both fore-
ground and background objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your camera, 
the Sports shooting mode automatically selects 
a high shutter speed to help you “stop” action, 
producing blur-free shots of the subject.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The 
faster the shutter speed, the shorter the expo-
sure time, which reduces the time that you 
need to keep the camera absolutely still. If 
you’re using the Rebel T1i/500D kit lens, you 
can also improve your odds of shake-free shots 
by enabling the Image Stabilizer (IS) feature 
(set the Stabilizer switch on the lens to the On 
position). For a very slow shutter speed, using a 
tripod is the best way to avoid camera shake.
Creative Auto mode, explained later in this 
chapter, gives you a little input over f-stop. But 
in this mode or any of the fully auto modes, the 
range of f-stops and shutter speeds the camera 
can select depends on the lighting conditions. 
When you’re shooting at night, for example, 
the camera may not be able to select a shutter 
speed fast enough to stop action even in Sports 
mode.
If you want more control over focus and depth 
of field, you need to switch to an advanced 
exposure mode. Chapters 5 and 6 show you 
how to use those modes and explain all these 
concepts fully. 

45
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Exploring Basic Flash Options
Your built-in flash has three basic modes of operation, which are represented 
by the icons shown in the margin:
 
 
✓ Auto flash: The camera decides when to fire the flash, basing its deci-
sion on the lighting conditions.
 
 
✓ On: The flash fires regardless of the lighting conditions. You may hear 
this flash mode referred to as force flash, because the camera is forced 
to trigger the flash even if its exposure brain says there’s plenty of ambi-
ent light. It’s sometimes also called fill flash because it’s designed to fill 
in shadows that can occur even in bright light.
 
 
✓ Off: The flash does not fire, no way, no how.
As with most everything else on your camera, which settings are available to 
you depends on the exposure mode you choose. Here’s how things shake out: 
 
✓ Full Auto, Portrait, Close-Up, and Night Portrait: In these modes, Auto 
flash is used; you cannot control whether the flash fires. However, you 
can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction flash mode if you want. See the 
next section for the pros and cons of Red-Eye Reduction flash.
 
✓ Landscape, Sports, and Flash Off exposure modes: Flash is disabled.
 
 Disabling flash in the Flash Off mode makes sense, of course. But why no 
flash in Sports and Landscape mode, you ask? Well, Sports mode is 
designed to enable you to capture moving subjects, and the flash can 
make that more difficult because it needs time to recycle between shots. 
On top of that, the maximum shutter speed that’s possible with the 
built-in flash is 1/200 second, which often isn’t fast enough to ensure a 
blur-free subject. Finally, action photos usually aren’t taken at a range 
close enough for the flash to reach the subject, which is also the reason 
why flash is disabled for Landscape mode.
 
✓ Creative Auto: In this mode, you can choose from all three flash set-
tings, and you can enable Red-Eye Reduction flash as well. See the 
upcoming section “Gaining More Control with Creative Auto” for details 
on how to select the flash mode you want to use.
 
✓ P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP: In these modes, you don’t actually choose a 
flash mode. Instead, you simply press the Flash button on the side of 
the camera to pop up the built-in flash when you want that extra burst 
of light and close the flash unit when you want to go flash free. You also 
have access to some advanced flash options, such as Flash Exposure 
Compensation, which enables you to vary the flash intensity. See Chapter 
5 for the complete story on using flash in these exposure modes.

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
The viewfinder displays the following symbols to alert you to the flash status:
 
✓ Flash On: A little lightning bolt like the one you see in the highlighted 
area of Figure 2-5 tells you that the flash is enabled.
 
✓ Flash Recycling: If you see the word Busy along with the lightning bolt, 
as shown in Figure 2-5, the flash needs a few moments to recharge. 
When the flash is ready to go, the Busy message disappears.
 
Flash status indicators
 
Figure 2-5: A Busy signal means that the flash is recharging.
Using Red-Eye Reduction Flash
For any exposure mode that permits flash, you can enable a feature called 
Red-Eye Reduction. When you turn on this feature, the Red-Eye Reduction 
lamp on the front of the camera lights up when you press the shutter button 
halfway. The purpose of this light is to attempt to shrink the subject’s pupils, 
which helps reduce the chances of red-eye. The flash itself fires when you 
press the shutter button the rest of the way.
To enable Red-Eye Reduction, head for Shooting Menu 1. Select Red-Eye On/
Off, as shown on the left in Figure 2-6, and press the Set button to display the 
second screen in the figure. Highlight On and press Set again. To turn off Red-
Eye Reduction, just return to the menu and set the option to Off.

47
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 
Figure 2-6: Turn Red-Eye Reduction flash mode on and off via Shooting Menu 1.
The viewfinder and Shooting Settings 
display don’t offer any indication that 
Red-Eye Reduction is enabled. But 
you can check the setting by pressing 
the Menu button and then the DISP 
button. The Camera Settings display 
appears; look for the little eyeball icon 
and the word On or Off, as shown in 
Figure 2-7.
 
After you press the shutter button 
halfway in Red-Eye Reduction flash 
mode, a row of vertical bars appears 
in the center of the viewfinder display, 
just to the left of the ISO value. A few 
instants later, the bars turn off one by 
one. For best results, wait until all the bars are off to take the picture. (The 
delay gives the subject’s pupils time to constrict in response to the Red-Eye 
Reduction lamp.)
Shooting in the Fully Automatic Modes
You can choose from seven fully automatic exposure modes, highlighted in 
Figure 2-8. The next sections provide details on each mode.
 
As you explore these modes — or any exposure mode, for that matter — 
remember that you can use manual or autofocus as you see fit. If you opt for 
autofocus, the camera locks the autofocus point differently depending on the 
exposure mode, however. 
Red-eye reduction status
Figure 2-7: You can check the Red-Eye 
Reduction status in the Camera Settings 
screen as well as in the menu.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Full Auto mode
 
 In Full Auto mode, represented on 
the Mode dial by the rectangle you 
see in the margin, the camera selects 
all settings based on the scene that it 
detects in front of the lens. Your only 
job is to lock in focus, using the two-
stage autofocus technique I outline 
at the beginning of the chapter, or by 
setting the lens to manual focus mode 
and using the focus ring on the lens, 
as explained in Chapter 1.
Full Auto mode is great for casual, 
quick snapshooting. But keep these 
limitations in mind:
 
✓ Picture Style: Full Auto mode 
records your photo using the Standard Picture Style setting. The aim of 
this mode is to produce a crisp, vivid image. You can get more details 
about how Picture Styles affect your photos in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Drive mode: The camera selects the Single setting automatically, so you 
record one image for every press of the shutter button. For information 
on how to change the setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode, 
see the last section in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: Auto flash is used. That is, the camera fires the flash automati-
cally if the available light is too dim to otherwise expose the picture. 
You can enable Red-Eye Reduction mode; see the preceding section for 
details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: In most cases, the camera focuses the closest object that 
falls under one of the autofocus points. To focus on a different area, the 
easiest option is to switch to manual focusing.
 
 If you stick with autofocus, note that the camera adjusts its autofocus-
ing behavior depending on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still or 
moving subject. For still subjects, the camera locks focus when you 
press the shutter halfway. But if the camera senses motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus from the time you press the shutter button halfway. 
You must reframe your shot as necessary to keep the subject within 
one of the nine autofocus points to ensure sharp focus.
Fully automatic exposure modes
Figure 2-8: Set the dial to the exposure mode 
you want to use.

49
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 See Chapter 6 for additional information on getting good autofocus 
results.
 
✓ Color: Color decisions are also handled for you automatically. Normally, 
the camera’s color brain does a good job of rendering the scene, but if 
you do want to tweak color, you must switch to an advanced exposure 
mode. You can then manipulate color via the White Balance controls 
and Picture Style options, all covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Exposure: You also give up total control over exposure to the camera. 
Chapter 5 shows you what you’re missing.
 
✓ Quality: You can choose any Quality setting. Chapter 3 discusses this 
setting, which determines both the image resolution, or pixel count, and 
the file format (JPEG or Raw).
 
I decided not to include an example of a photo taken in Full Auto mode 
because, frankly, the results that this setting create vary widely depending on 
the available light and how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to 
shoot a portrait, landscape, action shot, or whatever. But the bottom line is 
that Full Auto is a one-size-fits-all approach that may not take best advantage 
of your camera’s capabilities. So if you want to more consistently take great 
pictures instead of good ones, I encourage you to explore the exposure, 
focus, and color information found in Part II so that you can abandon this 
exposure mode in favor of ones that put more photographic decisions in 
your hands.
Automatic scene modes (a.k.a. Image Zone modes)
In Full Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you 
want to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to 
rely on the camera to make that judgment, your camera offers six other fully 
automatic modes that are specifically designed for taking popular catego-
ries of pictures. For example, most people prefer portraits that have softly 
focused backgrounds. So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that 
can produce that type of background. 
 
These six automatic modes — the ones represented by the little pictographs 
highlighted in Figure 2-8 — are officially known as Image Zone modes in 
Canon lingo and in your camera manual. For reasons I state in Chapter 1, I 
avoid using the whole “zone” moniker system in this book and instead refer 
to the six Image Zone modes as fully automatic scene modes. But if you should 
seek information about these modes elsewhere, whether online or in your 
manual, be sure to search for the topic under its official name. 

50
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Whatever you call them, all six modes share a couple of limitations — or 
benefits, depending on how you look at things: 
 
✓ Color: As with Full Auto mode, you can’t tweak color. Some modes 
manipulate colors in ways that you may or may not appreciate, and 
you’re stuck if you have a color cast problem.
 
✓ Exposure: The camera makes all exposure decisions, too, including 
whether the flash fires or not.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the 
scene modes.
Portrait mode
 
 Portrait mode attempts to select an aperture (f-stop) setting that results in a 
short depth of field, which blurs the background and puts the visual empha-
sis on your subject. Figure 2-9 offers an example. Keep in mind, though, that 
the short depth of field produced by Portrait mode may result in softer focus 
on objects set in front of your subject, not just those behind it. Either way, 
the extent to which the depth of field is reduced depends on the current 
lighting conditions (which affect the range of f-stops the camera can use), the 
distance between your subject and those foreground or background objects, 
and a couple of other factors that I discuss in Chapter 6.
 
 
Figure 2-9: Portrait setting produces a softly focused background.

51
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Along with favoring an f-stop that produces a shorter depth of field, the 
camera selects these settings in Portrait mode:
 
✓ Picture Style: Logically enough, the camera automatically sets the 
Picture Style option to Portrait. As detailed in Chapter 6, this Picture 
Style results in a slightly less sharp image, the idea being to keep skin 
texture nice and soft. Colors are also adjusted subtly to enhance skin 
tones.
 
✓ Drive mode: Contrary to what you may expect, the Drive mode is set 
to Continuous, which means that the camera records a series of images 
in rapid succession as long as you hold down the shutter button. This 
technique can come in especially handy if your portrait subject can’t be 
counted on to remain still for very long — a toddler or pet, for example.
 
 Should you want to include yourself in the portrait, you can switch the 
Drive mode setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode. See the end 
of this chapter for details.
 
✓ Flash: Auto flash is used; the camera decides whether you need flash 
or not. For outdoor portraits, this can pose a problem: A flash generally 
improves outdoor portraits, and if the ambient light is very bright, the 
camera doesn’t give you access to the flash. For an illustration of the dif-
ference a flash can make, see Chapter 7. That chapter also contains tips 
on using flash in nighttime and indoor portraits.
 
 Although you can’t control whether the flash fires, you can choose to 
enable or disable Red-Eye Reduction flash, explained a little earlier in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Autofocusing: Portrait mode employs the One-Shot AF (autofocus) 
mode. This is one of three AF modes available on your camera, all 
detailed in Chapter 6. In One-Shot mode, the camera locks focus when 
you press the shutter button halfway. Typically, the camera locks focus 
on the closest object that falls under one of the nine autofocus points. 
If your subject moves out of the selected autofocus point, the camera 
doesn’t adjust focus to compensate.
Landscape mode
 
 Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of 
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas, 
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, produces a large depth of field. 
As a result, objects both close to the camera and at a distance appear 
sharply focused, as shown in Figure 2-10.

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Like Portrait mode, Landscape mode 
achieves the greater depth of field by 
manipulating the exposure settings — 
specifically, the aperture, or f-stop set-
ting. So the extent to which the camera 
can succeed in keeping everything in 
sharp focus depends on the available 
light. To fully understand this issue, see 
Chapters 5 and 6. And in the meantime, 
know that you also can extend depth 
of field by zooming out, if you’re using 
a zoom lens, and moving farther from 
your subject.
As for other camera settings, Landscape 
mode results in the following options:
 
✓ Picture Style: The camera automat-
ically sets the Picture Style option 
to Landscape, which produces a 
sharper image, with well-defined 
“edges” — the borders between 
areas of contrast or color change. 
The Picture Style setting also pro-
duces more vivid blues and greens, 
which is what most people prefer 
from their landscape photos. You 
can read more about Picture Styles 
in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Drive mode: The camera selects the Single option, which records one 
image for each press of the shutter button. As with the other scene 
modes, you can switch to a Self-Timer or Remote Control setting by fol-
lowing the steps laid out at the end of this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: 
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting 
most landscapes anyway.
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF (autofocus) mode is set to One-Shot, which means 
that focus is locked when you press the shutter button halfway. (See 
Chapter 6 for details.) Focus usually is set on the nearest object that 
falls under one of the nine autofocus points, but remember that because 
of the large depth of field that the Landscape mode produces, both far 
and near objects may appear equally sharp, depending on their distance 
from the lens.
Figure 2-10: Landscape mode produces a 
large zone of sharp focus and intensifies 
blues and greens.

53
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Close-Up mode
 
 Switching to Close-Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance 
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you use.
But choosing Close-Up mode does tell the camera to try to select an aperture 
(f-stop) setting that results in a short depth of field, which blurs background 
objects so that they don’t compete for attention with your main subject. I 
used this setting to capture the orchid in Figure 2-11, for example. As with 
Portrait mode, though, how much the background blurs varies depending 
on the distance between your subject and the background as well as on the 
lighting conditions (which determine the range of f-stops that will produce a 
good exposure), your camera-to-subject distance, and the lens focal length. 
(Chapter 6 explains all these issues.)
 
 
Figure 2-11: Close-Up mode also produces short depth of field.
Other settings selected for you in Close-Up mode are as follows:
 
✓ Picture Style: Close-Up mode uses the Standard picture style, just like 
Full Auto. The resulting image features crisp edges and vivid colors.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Drive mode: The Drive mode is set to Single, so you record one photo 
each time you fully press the shutter button. However, you can select a 
Self-Timer or Remote Control mode if needed.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is set to Auto, so the camera decides whether the picture 
needs the extra pop of light from the built-in flash. For times when 
the camera enables the flash, you have the option of using Red-Eye 
Reduction mode.
 
 Whether or not you enable Red-Eye Reduction, watch your subject-to-
camera distance if you’re shooting a living subject; a burst of flash light 
at close range can be damaging to the subject’s eyes. A better choice in 
this scenario is to switch to the Creative Auto mode, which lets you dis-
able the flash as well as request a shallow depth of field. 
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot mode; again, that simply 
means that when you press the shutter button halfway, the camera 
locks focus, usually on the nearest object that falls under one of the nine 
autofocus points.
See Chapter 6 for more details about AF modes and other focusing issues. 
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Sports mode
 
 Sports mode results in a number of settings that can help you photograph 
moving subjects, such as the soccer player in Figure 2-12. First, the camera 
selects a fast shutter speed, which is needed to “stop motion.” Shutter speed 
is an exposure control that you can explore in Chapter 5.
Also, keep these Sports mode settings in mind:
 
✓ Picture Style: The camera automatically sets the Picture Style option to 
Standard, which is designed to produce sharp images with bold colors.
 
✓ Drive mode: To enable rapid-fire image capture, the Drive mode is set 
to Continuous. This mode enables you to record multiple frames with a 
single press of the shutter button. You also have the option of switching 
to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode. Check out the end of this 
chapter for details on Drive mode settings.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is disabled, which can be a problem in low-light situations, 
but it also enables you to shoot successive images more quickly because 
the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. In addition, 
disabling the flash permits a faster shutter speed; when the flash is on, 
the maximum shutter speed is 1/200 second. (See Chapter 5 for details 
about flash and shutter speeds.)

55
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to AI Servo. In this mode, the camera 
establishes focus initially when you press the shutter button halfway. 
But if the subject moves, the camera attempts to refocus.
 
 For this feature to work correctly, you must adjust framing so that your 
subject remains within one of the autofocus points. You may find it 
easier to simply switch to manual focusing and twist the focusing ring as 
needed to track the subject’s movement yourself.
 
 
Figure 2-12: To capture moving subjects 
 
without blur, try Sports mode.
The other critical thing to understand about Sports mode is that whether the 
camera can select a shutter speed fast enough to stop motion depends on the 
available light and the speed of the subject itself. In dim lighting, a subject 
that’s moving at a rapid pace may appear blurry even when photographed in 
Sports mode. 
To fully understand shutter speed, visit Chapter 5. And for more tips on 
action photography, check out Chapter 7.
Night Portrait mode
 
 As its name implies, Night Portrait mode is designed to deliver a better-
looking portrait at night (or in any dimly lit environment). It does so by 
combining flash with a slow shutter speed. That slow shutter speed 

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
produces a longer exposure time, which enables the camera to rely more 
on ambient light and less on the flash to expose the picture. The result is a 
brighter background and softer, more even lighting.
 
I cover the issue of using a slow shutter speed in detail in Chapter 5; Chapter 
7 has some additional nighttime photography tips. For now, the important 
thing to know is that the slower shutter speed means that you probably need 
a tripod. If you try to handhold the camera, you run the risk of moving the 
camera during the long exposure, resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the 
Image Stabilizer (IS) feature of your lens, if available, can help, but for night-
time shooting, even that may not permit successful handheld shooting. Your 
subjects also must stay perfectly still during the exposure, which can also be 
a challenge.
If you do try Night Portrait mode, be aware of these other settings that are 
automatically selected by the camera:
 
✓ Picture Style: The Standard setting, designed to deliver sharp, bold 
photos, is selected. See Chapter 6 for more about Picture Styles.
 
✓ Drive mode: The default setting is Single, but you also can choose a Self-
Timer or Remote Control mode. Check out the end of this chapter for 
details.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks more light is needed — 
which, assuming that you’re actually shooting at night, should be most 
of the time. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode if you 
prefer. See the section “Using Red-Eye Reduction Flash,” earlier in this 
chapter, for details. 
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which locks focus when 
you depress the shutter button halfway.
Flash Off mode
 
 The Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Full Auto mode but ensures 
that the flash doesn’t fire, even in dim lighting. This mode provides an easy 
way to ensure that you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that 
don’t permit flash: museums, churches, and so on. But it can also come in 
handy any time you prefer not to use flash. See Chapters 5 and 7 for informa-
tion about flash photography.
Gaining More Control with Creative Auto
Creative Auto mode might be better named “Full Auto Plus.” This mode is 
set up initially to work the same way as Full Auto, explained earlier in this 
chapter. But if you don’t like the results you get, you can make the following 
adjustments for your next shot:

57
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Enable or disable the flash.
 
✓ Make the picture brighter or darker.
 
✓ Soften or sharpen the apparent focus of the picture background.
 
✓ Select from four Picture Styles, which affect the color and sharpness of 
the image. One of the four options creates a black-and-white photo.
 
Although it’s great for beginners to have an easy way to have a little more 
input on their pictures, Creative Auto still doesn’t give you anywhere near 
the level of creative control you get in the advanced exposure modes. For 
example, you can decide whether you want the flash to fire in Creative Auto 
mode, but you can’t adjust flash power or change the way the camera calcu-
lates the flash exposure, as you can in the P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP modes. 
That said, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by all the new stuff that comes with 
digital SLR photography and you’re not ready to dive into the more advanced 
exposure modes covered in Chapters 5 and 6, then by all means, Creative 
Auto is a better choice than the other modes covered in this chapter. Here’s 
how to use it:
 
 
1. Set the Mode dial on top of the camera to the CA setting.
 
 The Creative Auto version of the Shooting Settings screen, shown in 
Figure 2-13, appears on the monitor. (If you don’t see the screen, press 
the DISP button or press the shutter button halfway and then release it.) 
The six settings you can adjust in this mode are labeled in the figure.

Background (blur/sharpen)
Exposure
Picture Style

Figure 2-13: In Creative Auto mode, the Shooting Settings screen 
 
 
displays these controls.

58
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
2. Press Set.
 
 Pressing Set shifts the screen into Quick Control mode. One of the six 
adjustable settings is highlighted, and a text label appears at the bottom 
of the screen to remind you what the highlighted setting does. In Figure 
2-14, for example, the Flash setting is highlighted. 
 
3. Press the cross keys to move the highlight over the setting you want to 
adjust.
 
4. Adjust the highlighted setting by rotating the Main dial.
 
 See the upcoming list for some advice about each of the options.
 
 For the Quality and Drive mode options, you also can press Set to dis-
play a screen containing all possible settings. After you get to the 
options screen, rotate the Main dial or use the right and left cross keys 
to highlight the setting you want to use. Then press Set to return to the 
Quick Control screen.
 
5. To adjust another setting, press the cross keys to highlight it.
 
6. After you select all the settings you want to change, press the shutter 
button halfway and release it.
 
 The monitor returns to the normal Shooting Settings display, and you’re 
ready to take your picture.
 
The settings you choose remain in effect from shot to shot. But if you turn 
the camera off or switch to a different exposure mode, the settings return to 
their defaults. (The default settings are shown in Figure 2-13.)
Now for the promised explanations 
of how the six Creative Auto options 
work: 
 
✓ Flash: You can choose from 
three flash settings, which are 
represented on the Shooting 
Settings screen by the icons you 
see in the margin:
 
 
• Auto: The camera fires the 
flash automatically if it 
thinks extra light is needed 
to expose the picture.
 
 
• On: The flash fires regard-
less of the ambient light.
 
 
• Off: The flash does not fire.
Selected option
Figure 2-14: Press Set to enter Quick Control 
mode and adjust the Creative Auto options.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 For the Auto and On settings, you can use the Red-Eye Reduction 
flash feature. See “Exploring Basic Flash Options” and “Using Red-Eye 
Reduction Flash,” earlier in this chapter, for more information about 
flash photography.
 
✓ Background (blur/sharpen): The topmost of the two slider bars on the 
Creative Auto screen gives you some control over depth of field, or the 
distance over which objects in the scene remain sharply focused.
 
 Unfortunately, this feature doesn’t play nice with the flash. If you set the 
flash mode to On, the bar becomes dimmed and out of your reach. Ditto 
if you set the flash mode to Auto and the camera sees a need for flash.
 
 Assuming that the flash doesn’t get in your way, move the little indica-
tor on the bar to the left to shorten depth of field, which makes distant 
objects appear blurrier. (Remember, after highlighting the bar, you just 
rotate the Main dial to move the indicator.) Shift the indicator to the 
right to make distant objects appear sharper.
 
 The camera creates this shift in depth of field by adjusting the aperture 
setting (f-stop). A lower f-stop number produces a more shallow depth 
of field, for a blurrier background; a higher f-stop setting produces a 
greater depth of field, for a sharper background. However, because aper-
ture also plays a critical role in exposure, the range of f-stops the 
camera can choose — and, therefore, the extent of focus shift you can 
achieve with this setting — depends on the available light. The camera 
gives priority to getting a good exposure, assuming that you’d prefer a 
well-exposed photo to one that has the background blur you want but is 
too dark or too light. Understand, too, that when the aperture changes, 
the camera also must change the shutter speed, ISO (light sensitivity 
setting), or both to maintain a good exposure.
 
 You can view the shutter speed and aperture settings that the camera 
has in mind by pressing the shutter button halfway, which kicks the 
autoexposure system into gear. The shutter speed and f-stop then 
appear in the areas labeled in Figure 2-15. In the left half of the figure, 
you see the settings the camera chose with the Background slider indi-
cator at the center position. When I moved the slider to the left, the 
camera selected a lower f-stop, as shown in the second screen in the 
figure. That lower f-stop decreases depth of field, blurring the back-
ground more. But it also lets more light into the camera, so the shutter 
speed (exposure time) increased to compensate. In some cases, the 
camera may also adjust ISO (light sensitivity) to improve exposure.
 
✓ At very slow shutter speeds, camera shake can blur the image. A 
blinking shutter speed value alerts you to the potential for this problem; 
put your camera on a tripod to avoid the risk of camera shake. Also 
remember that moving objects appear blurry at slow shutter speeds.

 To find out more about depth of field, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and 
exposure, start with the sidebar “More Focus Factors to Consider,” ear-
lier in this chapter, then see Chapters 5 and 6 for the complete story.
 
✓ Exposure: If your picture is underexposed, select this second slider and 
then move the indicator bar to the right before your next shot. Move the 
slider to the left to reduce the brightness of your next shot. To produce 
the exposure shift, the camera may adjust aperture, shutter speed, ISO, 
or all three.
 
 Again, if the shutter speed blinks after you adjust the Exposure slider, it 
means that the camera had to select a slow shutter speed and is sug-
gesting that you use a tripod to avoid camera shake.
 
✓ Picture Styles: Picture Styles apply certain adjustments to color, sharp-
ness, and contrast to your pictures. You can select from four Picture 
Styles in Creative Auto mode: Standard, Portrait, Landscape, and 
Monochrome (black and white). To see examples of each style and 
learn more about how your picture will be affected, check out the end of 
Chapter 6.
 
✓ Drive mode: You can choose from all but one of the Drive mode options, 
explained in the next section. The 2-Second Self-Timer mode is off limits, 
as it is in the fully automatic exposure modes.
 
✓ Quality: You get access to the full range of Quality options. Chapter 3 
helps you understand these settings.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Changing the Drive Mode
The Drive mode enables you to tell the camera what to do when you press 
the shutter button: record a single frame, a series of frames, or record one or 
more shots after a short delay.
Your camera offers the following Drive mode settings, which are represented 
by the symbols you see in the margin:
 
 
✓ Single: This setting, which is the default for Creative Auto and all fully 
automatic modes except Portrait and Sports, records a single image 
each time you press the shutter button. In other words, this is normal-
photography mode.
 
 
✓ Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this setting records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button. 
On the Rebel T1i/500D, you can capture just about 3.4 shots per second. 
Obviously, this mode is great for capturing fast-paced subjects, which is 
why it’s the default setting for Sports mode. It’s also selected for Portrait 
mode, which is a great benefit if your subject is the fidgety type.
 
 Keep in mind that some camera functions can slow down the continu-
ous capture rate. For example, when you use flash or enable the High 
ISO Noise Reduction feature (explained in Chapter 5), you typically can’t 
achieve the highest burst rate. The speed of your memory card also 
plays a role in how fast the camera can capture images. In other words, 
consider 3.4 shots per second a best-case scenario.
 
 
✓ Self-Timer/Remote Control: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select 
this mode and then press the shutter button and run into the frame. You 
have about 10 seconds to get yourself in place and pose before the 
image is recorded.
 
 I also often use the self-timer function when I want to avoid any possibil-
ity of camera shake. The mere motion of pressing the shutter button can 
cause slight camera movement, which can blur an image. So I put the 
camera on a tripod and then activate the self-timer function. This 
enables “hands-free” — and therefore motion-free — picture taking.
 
 As another alternative, you can purchase one of the optional remote-
control units sold by Canon. You can opt for either a wireless unit 
or one that plugs into the remote-control terminal on the left side of 
the camera. Either way, set the Drive mode to the Self-Timer/Remote 
Control option when you want to trigger the shutter release button with 
the remote control.

62
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps

✓ 2-Second Self-Timer: This mode works just like the regular self-timer 
mode, but the capture happens just two seconds after you fully press 
the shutter button. Unfortunately, this mode isn’t available to you in the 
fully automatic exposure modes or Creative Auto mode; you can choose 
this option only in P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP modes.
 
c
 
✓ Self-Timer Continuous: With this option, the camera waits 10 seconds 
after you press the shutter button and then captures a continuous series 
of images. You can record as 
many as 10 continuous images.
To check the current Drive mode, 
display the Shooting Settings screen. 
The Drive mode icon appears in the 
area labeled in Figure 2-16. 
If you want to use a different mode, 
you have two options:
 
✓ Use the Quick Control screen. 
First, display the Shooting 
Settings screen; either press the 
DISP button or press the shutter 
button halfway and then release 
it. Now press Set to shift to 
Quick Control mode and use the 
cross keys to highlight the Drive mode icon, as shown on the left in 
Figure 2-17. The name of the current setting appears at the bottom of the 
screen. Rotate the Main dial to cycle through the available Drive mode 
options.
 
 As an alternative, highlight the Drive mode icon and then press Set. 
You then see a screen showing all the possible settings, as shown on 
the right in Figure 2-17. Press the right or left cross key or rotate the 
Main dial to highlight your Drive mode of choice. For the Self-Timer 
Continuous mode, press the up or down cross key to set the number 
of continuous shots you want the camera to capture, as shown in the 
figure. Finally, press the Set button to lock in the setting. (This second 
method is the only way to adjust the frame-count for the Self-Timer 
Continuous option.)
 
 Again, you can access all five Drive mode options only in the advanced 
exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). In Creative Auto mode, you 
lose the 2-Second Self-Timer mode. And in all the fully auto modes, you 
see only the default Drive mode — either Single or Continuous — plus 
the Self-Timer/Remote Control and the Self-Timer Continuous options.
Drive mode

represents the Drive mode.

✓ Press the left cross key. It’s marked by three little Drive mode icons to 
help you remember its function. After you press the cross key, you see 
the screen shown on the right in Figure 2-17. Highlight your choice and 
press Set. Again, you can press the up or down cross key to change the 
number of frames to be captured in the Self-Timer Continuous mode.
 
Your selected Drive mode remains in force until you change it or switch to an 
exposure mode for which the selected Drive mode isn’t available.

Controlling Picture Quality
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing factors that lead to poor photo quality
▶ Exploring resolution, pixels, and ppi
▶ Calculating the right resolution for traditional print sizes
▶ Understanding the tradeoff between picture quality and file size
▶ Deciding on the best file format: JPEG or Raw?
▶ Picking the right JPEG quality level
A
lmost every review of the Rebel T1i/500D contains glowing reports 
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve no doubt dis-
covered for yourself, those claims are true, too: This baby can create large, 
beautiful images.
Getting the maximum output from your camera, how-
ever, depends on choosing the right capture settings. 
Chief among them, and the topic of this chapter, is 
the appropriately named Quality setting. This criti-
cal control determines two important aspects of 
your pictures: resolution, or pixel count; and file 
format, which refers to the type of computer file the 
camera uses to store your picture data.
Resolution and file format both play a large role 
in the quality of your photos, so selecting from the 
eight Quality settings on your camera is an important 
decision. Why not just dial in the setting that produces 
the maximum quality level and be done with it? Well, 
that’s the right choice for some photographers. But because 
choosing that maximum setting has some disadvantages, you 
may find that stepping down a notch or two on the quality scale is a 
better option, at least for some pictures.

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To help you figure out which Quality setting meets your needs, this chapter 
explains exactly how resolution and file format affect your pictures. Just in 
case you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first 
section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.

67
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only two are affected 
by the Quality setting. So if you aren’t happy with your image quality, first 
compare your photos to those in the figure to properly diagnose the prob-
lem. Then try these remedies:
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles 
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which 
you do via the Quality setting. See the upcoming section, “Considering 
Resolution: Large, Medium, or Small?” for details.
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that 
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the 
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as 
JPEG artifacts. This defect is also related to the Quality setting; see the 
“Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)” section, later in this chapter, 
to find out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise is most often related to a very 
long exposure time (that is, a very slow shutter speed) or to an exposure 
control called ISO, which you can explore in Chapter 5. To adjust shutter 
speed or ISO, you must switch to one of the advanced exposure modes 
(P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White 
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. 
Note, though, that you also must use an advanced exposure mode to 
adjust white balance.
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of 
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the 
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,” else-
where in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor cleaning. 
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in your 
photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. Some defects, espe-
cially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appearance until you see 
them at a magnified view.
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your Rebel is 
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the 
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you 
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Decoding the Quality Options
 
Your camera’s Quality setting determines both the image resolution and file 
format of the pictures you shoot. To access the control, you can go two 
routes:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: After displaying the Shooting Settings screen, 
press Set to shift to Quick Control mode and use the cross keys to high-
light the Quality icon, as shown on the left screen in Figure 3-2. You can 
then rotate the Main dial to cycle through the available Quality settings. 
Or, if you prefer, press Set to display the screen shown on the right in 
the figure, which contains all the possible Quality options. This time, use 
either the Main dial or the right or left cross key to highlight the setting 
you want to use. Press Set to wrap things up.
 
✓ Shooting Menu 1: Press the Menu button and then display Shooting 
Menu 1, shown on the left in Figure 3-3. Highlight Quality and press the 
Set button to display the screen you see on the right in the figure. Use 
the right or left cross key to highlight the option you want to use and 
then press Set.

If you’re new to digital photography, the Quality settings won’t make much 
sense to you until you read the rest of this chapter, which explains format 
and resolution in detail. But even if you are schooled in those topics, you 
may need some help deciphering the way that the settings are represented 
on your camera. As you can see from Figures 3-2 and 3-3, the options are pre-
sented in rather cryptic fashion, so here’s your decoder ring:
 
✓ At the bottom of the Quick Settings screen, you see three bits of informa-
tion about the currently selected Quality setting: the resolution, or total 
pixel count (measured in megapixels), the horizontal and vertical pixel 
count, and the number of subsequent shots you can fit on your current 
memory card if you select that Quality setting. I labeled the different 
values in Figure 3-2. The next section explains pixels and megapixels, if 
you’re new to the game.
 
✓ This same informational bar appears at the top of the screen that 
appears when you change the setting via Shooting Menu 1 or press Set 
after highlighting the Quality option on the Quick Settings screen. (See 
the right screens in Figures 3-2 and 3-3.) The next two rows of both 
screens show icons representing the eight Quality settings.
 
 
✓ Settings on the middle row of these screens capture images in the JPEG 
(jay-peg) file format. The little arc-like icons represent the level of JPEG 
compression, which affects picture quality and file size. You get two 
JPEG options: Fine and Normal. The smooth arcs represent the Fine 
setting; the jagged arcs represent the Normal setting. Check out the 
upcoming section “JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard” for details.
 
✓ Within the JPEG category, you can choose from three resolution settings, 
represented by L, M, and S (large, medium, and small). See the next sec-
tion for information that will help you select the right resolution.

70
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ The Quality settings in the third row enable you to capture images in the 
Raw file format. All Raw files are created at the Large resolution setting, 
giving you the maximum pixel count. One of the two Raw settings also 
records a JPEG Fine version of the image, also at the maximum resolu-
tion. The upcoming section “Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice” explains 
the benefits and downsides to using the Raw format.
Which Quality option is best depends on several factors including how you 
plan to use your pictures and how much time you care to spend processing 
your images on your computer. The rest of this chapter explains these and 
other issues related to the Quality settings. 
Considering Resolution: Large, 
Medium, or Small?
To decide upon a Quality setting, the first decision you need to make is how 
many pixels you want your image to contain. Pixels are the little square tiles 
from which all digital images are made; the word pixel is short for picture ele-
ment. You can see some pixels close up in the right image in Figure 3-4, which 
shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area in the left image.
 
 
Figure 3-4: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.

71
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
The number of pixels in an image is referred to as resolution. Your camera 
offers you three resolution levels, which are assigned the generic labels 
Large, Medium, and Small and are represented on the list of Quality settings 
by the initials L, M, and S. Table 3-1 shows you the pixel count that results 
from each option. (If you select Raw as your Quality setting, images are 
always captured at the Large resolution value.)
Table 3-1 
The Resolution Side of the Quality Settings
Symbol
Setting
Pixel Count
L
Large
4752 x 3168 (15.1 MP)
M
Medium
3456 x 2304 (8 MP)
S
Small
2352 x 1568 (3.7 MP)
 
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the 
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the 
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values. 
This number is usually stated in megapixels, or MP for short. The camera dis-
plays the resolution value using only one letter M, however (refer to Figures 
3-2 and 3-3). Either way, one megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off 
the megapixel values in the table.)
To figure out how many pixels are enough, you need to understand how 
resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sections 
explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-4.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 300 
pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8 × 10 print at 200 ppi, 
for example, you need a pixel count of 1600 × 2000.

72

Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes 
at 200 ppi and 300 ppi. Again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. 
(And note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of 
printer resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay 
down per inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)

Even though many photo-editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
 
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device the way it does on printed photos. Instead, it 
determines the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography, 
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need 
way fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For 
example, Figure 3-5 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
 
For e-mail images, I usually stick with a maximum horizontal pixel count of 
450 and a maximum vertical size of 400 pixels, depending on whether the pic-
ture is oriented horizontally, as in the figure, or vertically. If your image is 
much larger, the recipient may not be able to view the entire picture without 
scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use one of the Small Quality settings on your Rebel 
T1i/500D, which produce images that contain 2352 x 1568 pixels, you’ll have 
more than enough pixels for most onscreen uses. The only exception might

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
be an image that you want to display via a digital projector that has a very 
high screen resolution. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue and shows you 
how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
 
 
Figure 3-5: A 450-x-300-pixel image is plenty large for sharing via e-mail.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.

74
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But note 
that file format, which is the other half of the Quality equation on your Canon, 
also affects file size. See the upcoming section “Understanding File Type (JPEG 
or Raw)” for more on that topic. The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures 
fit on my memory card?” provides details on the file-storage issue.
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new 
camera owners — and it’s an important one 
because you don’t want to run out of space on 
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the discussions in this chapter, 
image resolution (pixel count) and file format 
(JPEG or Raw) together contribute to the size of 
the picture file which, in turn, determines how 
many photos fit in a given amount of camera 
memory.
The table below shows you the approximate 
size of the files, in megabytes (MB), that are 
generated at each of the possible resolution/
format combinations on your Rebel T1i/500D. 
(The actual file size of any image also depends 
on other factors, such as the subject, ISO set-
ting, and Picture Style setting.) In the Image 
Capacity column, you see approximately how 
many pictures you can store at the setting on a 
2GB (gigabyte) memory card.

Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 
I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the following recom-
mendations about whether to choose Large, Medium, or Small when you 
select a Quality setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday snapshots, the Medium setting (8 MP) is probably suf-
ficient. I find 15.1 MP, which is what you get from the Large setting, to 
be overkill for most casual snapshots, which means that you’re creating 
huge files for no good reason. So I stick with Medium unless I’m shooting 
critical images.
 
✓ Jump to Large (15.1 MP) if you plan to crop your photos or make huge 
prints. Always use the maximum resolution if you think you may want to 
crop your photo and enlarge the remaining image. For example, when I 
shot the left photo in Figure 3-6, I wanted to fill the frame with the but-
terfly, but I couldn’t do so without getting so close that I risked scaring it 
away. So I kept my distance and took the picture at the Large setting, 
which enabled me to crop the photo and still have enough pixels left to 
produce a great print, as you see in the right image.
 
✓ Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting 
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that 
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you 
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Lower resolution 
produces smaller files, and the smaller the file, the less time the camera 
needs to record the image to your memory card. Also see Chapter 7 for 
other tips on action photography.

Figure 3-6: Capture images that you plan to crop and enlarge at the highest possible resolution (Large).
Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)
In addition to establishing the resolution of your photos, the Quality setting 
determines the file format. The file format simply refers to the type of image 
file that the camera produces.
Your Rebel offers two file formats, JPEG and Raw, with a couple variations of 
each. The next sections explain the pros and cons of each setting.
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format option on Setup Menu 1. That 
option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your camera, as it is 
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 
✓ Immediate usability: JPEG is a longtime standard format for digital 
photos. All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display JPEG files, 
so you can share them online immediately after you shoot them. You 
also can get JPEG photos printed at any retail outlet, whether it’s an 
online or local printer. Additionally, any program that has photo capa-
bilities, from photo-editing programs to word-processing programs, can 
handle your files.

77
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are smaller than Raw files. And smaller files means 
that your pictures consume less room on your camera memory card and 
in your computer’s storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1, near the start of this chapter.
On your camera, the amount of compression that is applied depends on 
whether you choose a Quality setting that carries the label Fine or Normal. 
The difference between the two breaks down as follows:
 
 
✓ Fine: At this setting, represented by the symbol you see in the margin, 
very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many compres-
sion artifacts, if any.
 
 
✓ Normal: Switch to Normal, and the compression amount rises, as does 
the chance of seeing some artifacting. Notice the jaggedy-ness of the 
Normal icon, shown in the margin? That’s your reminder that all may 
not be “smooth” sailing when you choose a Normal setting.
Note, though, that even the Normal setting doesn’t result in anywhere near 
the level of artifacting that you see in my example in Figure 3-1. Again, that 
example is exaggerated to help you recognize artifacting defects and under-
stand how they differ from other image-quality issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print or display size small, you aren’t likely to 
notice a great deal of quality difference between the Fine and Normal com-
pression levels. The differences become apparent only when you greatly 
enlarge a photo.
Take a look at Figure 3-7, for example, which shows the same subject captured 
at the Large/Fine and Large/Normal settings, along with the respective file 
sizes that each option produces. I captured each image at the same resolu-
tion so that file type is the only variable. To my eye, at least, there’s no clear-
cut difference in quality when the photos are printed at this size. However, 
in Figure 3-8, which shows a greatly enlarged view of a portion of one of the 
playing cards — the red K from the King of Hearts card — you can detect the 
impact of the greater compression level applied at the Normal setting.
Understand something important about these examples: At this magnifica-
tion, you can see some pixelation as well as some compression artifacts. 
The ragged edge of the letter K is because of pixelation, so that aspect of the 
photo is the same for both the Normal and Fine examples. The splotchiness 
between the edges of the letter as well as in the white background is the com-
pression defect. And here, the Fine example exhibits less of that particular 
defect than the Normal example.

Figure 3-8: Greatly enlarging an image brings compression defects into view.
Given that the differences between Fine and Normal aren’t all that easy to 
spot until you really enlarge the photo, is it okay to shift to Normal and enjoy 
the benefits of smaller files? Well, only you can decide what level of quality 
your pictures demand. For me, the added file sizes produced by the Fine 
setting aren’t a huge concern, given that the prices of memory cards are so 
low right now that it’s easy to stock up on as many as I need. Long-term 

79
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
storage is more of an issue; the larger your files, the faster you fill your 
computer’s hard drive and the more DVDs or CDs you need for archiving 
purposes. But in the end, I’m willing to take the storage hit in exchange for 
the lower compression level of the Fine setting. You never know when a 
casual snapshot is going to be so great that you want to print or display it 
large enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And of all the 
defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of the hard-
est to remove. So I stick with Fine if I shoot in the JPEG format.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the 
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level 
of artifacting you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when 
you view images onscreen. It’s difficult to reproduce artifacting here in 
print because the print process obscures some of the tiny defects caused 
by compression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change the 
file type to Raw (CR2). Or consider your other option, which is to record two 
versions of each file, one Raw and one JPEG. The next section offers details.
 
Whichever format you select, be aware of one more important rule for pre-
serving the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your photo soft-
ware, don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time you alter 
and save an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of lossy com-
pression. And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you can eventu-
ally get to the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG example in 
Figure 3-1, at the start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the file 
does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a nondestructive format. TIFF, pro-
nounced tiff, is a good choice and is a file-saving option available in most 
photo-editing programs. Should you want to share the edited image online, 
create a JPEG copy of the TIFF file when you finish making all your changes. 
That way, you always retain one copy of the photo at the original quality 
captured by the camera. You can read more about TIFF in Chapter 8, in the 
section related to processing Raw images. Chapter 9 explains how to create a 
JPEG copy of a photo for online sharing.
Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice
The other picture-file type that you can create on your Rebel is Camera Raw, 
or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw files; Canon’s are called CR2 
files (or, on some older cameras, CRW). If you use a Windows computer, you 
see that three-letter designation at the end of your picture filenames.

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for two 
reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks 
your images, adjusting color, exposure, and sharpness as needed to pro-
duce the results that Canon believes its customers prefer. With Raw, the 
camera simply records the original, unprocessed image data. The pho-
tographer then copies the image file to the computer and uses special 
software known as a raw converter to produce the actual image, making 
decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point. The upshot is 
that “shooting Raw” enables you, not the camera, to have the final say 
on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Higher bit depth: Bit depth is a measure of how many distinct color 
values an image file can contain. JPEG files restricts you to 8 bits each 
for the red, blue, and green color components, or channels, that make up 
a digital image, for a total of 24 bits. That translates to roughly 16.7 mil-
lion possible colors. On the Rebel T1i/500D, a Raw file delivers a higher 
bit count, collecting 14 bits per channel. (Chapter 6 provides more infor-
mation about the red-green-blue makeup of digital images.)
 
 Although jumping from 8 to 14 bits sounds like a huge difference, you 
may not really ever notice any difference in your photos — that 8-bit 
palette of 16.7 million values is more than enough for superb images. 
Where having the extra bits can come in handy is if you really need to 
adjust exposure, contrast, or color after the shot in your photo-editing 
program. In cases where you apply extreme adjustments, having the 
extra original bits sometimes helps avoid a problem known as banding 
or posterization, which creates abrupt color breaks where you should 
see smooth, seamless transitions. (A higher bit depth doesn’t always 
prevent the problem, however, so don’t expect miracles.)
 
✓ Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting 
that can occur with JPEG.
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages. 
To wit:
 
✓ You can’t do much with your pictures until you process them in a Raw 
converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or put them into 
a text document or multimedia presentation. You can print them imme-
diately if you use the Canon-provided software, but most other photo 
programs require you to convert the Raw files to a standard format 
first. Ditto for retail photo printing. So when you shoot Raw, you add to 
the time you must spend in front of the computer instead of behind the 
camera lens. Chapter 8 shows you how to process your Raw files using 
your Canon software.

81
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ Raw files are larger than JPEGs. Unlike JPEG, Raw doesn’t apply lossy 
compression to shrink files. In addition, Raw files are always captured 
at the maximum resolution available on your camera, even if you don’t 
really need all those pixels. For both reasons, Raw files are significantly 
larger than JPEGs, so they take up more room on your memory card and 
on your computer’s hard drive or other picture-storage device.
Whether the upside of Raw outweighs the down is a decision that you need 
to ponder based on your photographic needs, your schedule, and your 
computer-comfort level. But before you make up your mind, compare the 
Large/Fine JPEG image in Figure 3-8 with its Raw counterpart, shown in 
Figure 3-9. I included the enlarged area from the JPEG Fine example here to 
make it easier to compare it with the Raw version. Yes, you can detect some 
subtle quality differences in the enlarged view, but most people would be 
hard pressed to distinguish between the two otherwise. And JPEG certainly 
wins out in terms of convenience, time savings, and smaller file size. (Note 
that during the Raw conversion process, I tried to use settings that kept the 
Raw image as close as possible to its JPEG cousin in all aspects but quality. 
But any variations in exposure, color, and contrast are a result of the con-
version process, not of the format per se.)

JPEG/Fine, 5.0MB
 
Figure 3-9: The difference between Raw and Large/Fine images typically is noticeable only 
 
when images are greatly enlarged.

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which 
can limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your photo editor 
later. And the extra bits in a Raw file offer an additional safety net because I 
usually can push the exposure adjustments a little further in my photo editor 
if necessary without introducing banding.
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But 
keep in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and 
I don’t really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw 
images.
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from the following two 
Quality options:
 
✓ RAW: This setting produces a single Raw file at the maximum resolution 
(15.1 megapixels).
 
✓ RAW+Large/Fine: This setting produces two files: the standard Raw file 
plus a JPEG file captured at the Large/Fine setting. At first glance, this 
option sounds great: You can share the JPEG online or get prints made 
and then process your Raw files when you have time.
 
 The problem is that, like the Raw file, the JPEG image is captured at the 
maximum pixel count — which is too large for onscreen viewing. That 
means that you have to edit the JPEG file anyway to trim down the pixel 
count before online sharing, although you can produce great prints right 
away. In addition, creating two files for every image eats up substantially 
more memory card space. I leave it up to you to decide whether the 
pluses outweigh the minuses.
My take: Choose Fine or Raw
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you. 
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of 
JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the Raw conversion process, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 for 
more information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
one of the Fine settings (Large/Fine, Medium/Fine, or Small/Fine). 

83
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ If you want to enjoy the best of both worlds, consider Raw+Large/Fine — 
assuming, of course, that you have an abundance of space on your 
memory card and your hard drive. Otherwise, creating two files for 
every photo on a regular basis isn’t really practical. 
 
✓ Select JPEG Normal if you’re not shooting pictures that demand the 
highest quality level and you won’t be printing or displaying the photos 
at large sizes. The smaller file sizes also makes JPEG Normal the way to 
go if you’re running seriously low on memory card space during a shoot. 
 
✓ Finally, remember that the format and resolution together determine the 
ultimate picture quality. So be sure that you select the Quality setting 
that offers both the appropriate number of pixels and format for how 
you plan to use your image. If you capture an image at the Small/Normal 
setting, for example, and then print the photo at a large size, the combi-
nation of a lower pixel count and a higher level of JPEG compression 
may produce a disappointing picture quality.
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo 
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation, 
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust 
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what 
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to 
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens. 
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a 
regular basis, using one of the specialized 
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly 
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last 
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty 
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera 
that does the actual image capture — the 
digital equivalent of a film negative, if you will. 
By default, your camera performs an internal 
sensor cleaning every time you turn it on and 
off; you can also run the cleaning process at 
any time you want by opening Setup Menu 2, 
choosing the Sensor Cleaning option, and then 
selecting Clean Now.
Especially if you frequently change lenses in a 
dirty environment, however, this internal clean-
ing mechanism may not be able to fully remove 
all specks from the sensor. In that case, you 
need a more thorough cleaning, which is done 
by actually opening up the camera and using 
special sensor-cleaning tools. You can do this 
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. An 
image sensor is pretty delicate, and you can 
easily damage it or other parts of your camera 
if you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local camera 
store that offers this service. In my area (cen-
tral Indiana), sensor cleaning costs about $30 to 
$50. If you bought your camera at a traditional 
camera store, the store may even provide free 
sensor cleaning as a way to keep your busi-
ness.
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean 
never — try to clean any part of your camera 
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can 
not only damage the interior of your camera, 
blowing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be 
removed, but also, it can crack the monitor.

W
ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photogra-
phy is being able to view my pictures the instant after 
I shoot them. No more guessing whether I captured the 
image I wanted or need to try again; no more wasting 
money on developing and printing pictures that stink. 
In fact, this feature alone was reason enough for 
me to turn my back forever on my closetful of film 
photography hardware.
Of course, with the Rebel T1i/500D, you can use the 
monitor not only to review your photos, but also to 
preview them. That is, if you turn on the Live View 
feature, you can use the monitor instead of the view-
finder to compose your shots. And not just still shots: 
You can record short digital movies, too, complete with 
sound.
Because all these functions involve some of the same buttons, 
bells, and whistles, I cover them together in this chapter. Additionally, 
this chapter explains how to delete pictures that you don’t like and protect 
the ones you love from accidental erasure. (Be sure also to visit Chapter 9, 

86
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
which covers some additional ways to view your images, including how 
to create in-camera slide shows and display your photos and movies on a 
television.)
Disabling and Adjusting Instant Review
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. By default, the instant-review period lasts just two seconds. But you can 
customize this behavior via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1, as 
shown in Figure 4-1.
 
 
Figure 4-1: You can extend or disable automatic picture review.
Your choices are as follows:
 
✓ Select one of three specific review periods: 2, 4, or 8 seconds.
 
✓ Select Off to disable the automatic instant review altogether. Turning 
off the monitor saves battery power, so keep this option in mind if the 
battery is running low. You can still view your pictures by pressing the 
Playback button. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Select Hold to display the current image indefinitely — or at least 
until the camera automatically shuts off to save power. (See the 
Chapter 1 section about Setup Menu 1 to find out about the auto 
shutdown feature.)
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To switch your camera to Playback mode and view the images on your 
memory card, take these steps:

1. Press the Playback button, shown in Figure 4-2 and in the margin.
 
 
 At the default settings, the camera displays a single picture at a time, 
with a row of picture data at the top of the frame, as shown in Figure 4-2. 
You can also display multiple images at a time; the next section tells all.

Figure 4-2: The default Playback mode displays one picture at a 
 
 
time, with minimal picture data.
 
 To find out how to interpret the picture data and specify what data you 
want to see, see the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.”
 
2. Press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
 
• Press the right cross key to view images starting with the oldest 
one on the card.
 
• Press the left cross key to view images in reverse order, starting 
with the most recent picture.
 
 Just keep pressing either key to browse through all of your images. 
 
3. To return to picture-taking mode, press the Playback button or press 
the shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera exits Playback mode and the Shooting Settings display 
appears on the monitor. Chapter 1 introduces you to that display.
Viewing multiple images at a time
 
 If you want to quickly review and compare several photos, you can set the 
camera to Index display mode and view thumbnails of either four or nine 
images at a time, as shown in Figure 4-3. Just press the AE Lock button, 
found on the upper-right corner of the camera back and shown in the margin. 
Press once to display four thumbnails at a time; press again to display nine 
thumbnails.

88
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Note the little blue checkerboard and magnifying glass icons under the 
button — they’re reminders of the function the button serves in Playback 
mode. The checkerboard indicates the Index function, and the minus sign 
in the magnifying glass tells you that pressing the button reduces the size of 
the image thumbnail. (The silver label above the button indicates a function 
related to picture taking.)

screen in Figure 4-3, the upper-right photo is selected. 
 
✓ Use the cross keys to select a different image. Press the up cross key to 
shift the selection box up, the right cross key to move it right, and so on.
 
✓ Rotate the Main dial to scroll through screens of thumbnails. Rotate 
right to shift to the next screen; rotate left to go back one screen.
 
 
✓ Press the AF Point Selection button to reduce the number of thumb-
nails. This button lives right next door to the AE Lock button. It, too, has 
a blue magnifying glass icon, this time with a plus sign in the center to 
indicate that pressing the button enlarges the thumbnail size. Press 
once to go from nine thumbnails to four; press again to go from four 
thumbnails to singe-image view, filling the screen with the selected 
image. To return to Index display mode, press the AE Lock button again.
Jumping through images
If your memory card contains scads of images, here’s a trick you’ll love: 
By using the Jump feature, you can rotate the Main dial to leapfrog through 

89
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
pictures instead of pressing the right or left cross key a bazillion times to get 
to the picture you want to see. You also can search for the first image shot on 
a specific date or tell the camera to display only movies or only still shots.
Set up your initial Jump mode by displaying Playback Menu 2 and highlight-
ing Image Jump, as shown on the left in Figure 4-4. (The little symbol at the 
end of the option name represents the Main dial, in case you care.)
 
 
Figure 4-4: You can specify a Jump mode from Playback Menu 2.
Press Set to display the right screen in Figure 4-4, where you can see all six 
jump-mode settings. They work as follows:
 
✓ 1 Image: This option, in effect, disables jumping, restricting you to 
browsing pictures one at a time. So what’s the point? It’s provided to 
enable you to scroll through pictures using the Main dial instead of the 
right and left cross keys if you prefer.
 
✓ 10 Images: Select this option to advance 10 images at a time.
 
✓ 100 Images: Select this option to advance 100 images at a time.
 
✓ Date: If your card contains images shot on different dates, you can jump 
between dates with this option. For example, if you’re looking at the first 
of 30 pictures taken on June 1, you can jump past all the others from 
that day to the first image taken on, say, June 5.
 
✓ Movies: Does your memory card contain both still photos and movies? 
If you want to view only the movie files, select this option. Then you can 
rotate the Main dial to jump from one movie to the next without seeing 
any still photos.
 
✓ Stills: This one is the opposite of the Movies option: Your movie files 
are hidden from view when you use the Main dial to scroll through your 
photos. You scroll one picture at a time, just as when you use the 1 
Image option.

90
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Select the Jump mode you want to use and press Set. Then take these steps 
to jump through your photos:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button to put the camera into Playback mode.
 
 
2. Set the camera to display a single photo.
 
 You can use jumping only when viewing a single photo at a time because 
the Main dial serves another function in Index playback. To get out of 
Index mode, press the AF Point Selection button (the one marked with 
the blue “zoom out” magnifying glass) until you see only one image on 
the monitor.
 
3. Rotate the Main dial.
 
 The camera jumps to the next image. How many images you advance, 
and whether you see movies as well as still photos, depends on the 
Jump mode you select.
 
 If you select any Jump setting 
but 1 Image, a jump bar appears 
at the bottom of the monitor, as 
shown in Figure 4-5, indicating 
the current Jump setting. If you 
want to view the bar in 1 Image 
mode, press the up cross key.
 
 After the bar appears, you can 
change the Jump setting without 
having to return to Playback 
Menu 2. Instead, just press the 
up or down cross key to cycle 
through the six Jump settings. 
Rotate the Main dial to start 
jumping again.
 
4. To exit Jump mode, press the right or left cross key.
 
 Now you’re back to regular Playback mode, in which each press of the 
right or left cross key advances through your pictures one at a time. You 
can return to your selected Jump mode by rotating the Main dial at any 
time.
Rotating vertical pictures
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — 
whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file. Then when you view the 
Figure 4-5: You also can press the up cross 
key to cycle through the Jump mode options.

91
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
picture, the camera reads the data and rotates the image so that it appears 
upright in the monitor, as shown on the left in Figure 4-6. The image is also 
rotated automatically when you view it in the photo software that shipped 
with your camera.
 
 
Figure 4-6: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
 
sideways (right).
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.
By default, automatic picture rotation is enabled for you. If you want to turn 
it off, you can do so through the Auto Rotate option on Setup Menu 1, as 
shown in Figure 4-7. You also can specify that you want the picture to be 
rotated just on your computer monitor by choosing the second of the two On 
settings (the one that doesn’t sport the little camera icon).
 
 
Figure 4-7: Go to Setup Menu 1 to disable or adjust automatic image rotation.

92
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
If you turn off automatic rotation, you can rotate images during playback by 
taking these steps:
 
1. Display Playback Menu 1 and highlight Rotate, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
 
Figure 4-8: You also can rotate individual images from Playback Menu 1.
 
2. Press the Set button.
 
 An image appears on the monitor, as shown on the right in Figure 4-8.
 
3. Navigate to the photo that you want to rotate.
 
 If you’re viewing pictures one at a time, just press the right and left 
cross keys to scroll to the photo that needs rotating. In Index display 
mode, press the cross keys to put the highlight box around the photo.
 
4. Press the Set button to rotate the image.
 
 Press once to rotate the image 90 degrees; press again to rotate 270 
degrees; and once more to return to 0 degrees.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to rotate additional photos.
 
6. Press Menu to exit Rotate mode and return to Playback Menu 1.
 
These steps apply only to still photos; you can’t rotate movies during play-
back. See the section “Recording movies,” later in this chapter, for more 
about movie playback.
Zooming in for a closer view
 
 By pressing the AF Point Selection button, posing here in the margin, you can 
more closely inspect a portion of a photo. This feature is especially handy for 
checking small details, such as whether anyone’s eyes are closed in a group 
portrait.

93
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
As with image rotating, zooming works only for still photos and only when 
you’re displaying photos one at a time. So if you’re viewing pictures in Index 
display mode, press the AF Point Selection button as many times as needed 
to display a single image on the monitor. Then use these techniques to adjust 
the image magnification:
 
✓ Zoom in. Press and hold the AF Point Selection button until you reach 
the magnification you want. You can enlarge the image up to ten times 
its normal display size.
 
✓ View another part of the picture. Whenever the image is magnified, a 
little thumbnail representing the entire image appears in the lower-right 
corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-9. The white box indicates 
the area of the image that’s visible. In the figure, for example, you see the 
top-central portion of the lorikeet 
photo that first chirped onto the 
scene in Figure 4-2.
 
 Use the cross keys to scroll the 
display to view a different por-
tion of the image.
 
✓ View more images at the same 
magnification. Here’s an espe-
cially neat trick: While the dis-
play is zoomed, you can rotate 
the Main dial to display the 
same area of the next photo at 
the same magnification. So, for 
example, if you shot that group 
portrait several times, you can 
easily check each one for shut-
eye problems.
 
 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the AE Lock 
button. Continue holding the button down until you reach the magnifica-
tion you want.
 
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the AE Lock button 
until you’re zoomed out all the way. Instead, press the Playback button, 
which quickly returns you to the full-frame view.
Viewing Picture Data
 
When you review still photos, you can press the DISP button to change the 
type and amount of shooting data that appears with the photo in the monitor. 
The next several sections offer a guide to the data-display options, starting 
with the most basic and working up to the most complex. See the upcoming 
Magnified area
Figure 4-9: Press the cross keys to scroll the 
display of the magnified image.

94
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
section “Recording Movies” for information about what’s displayed during 
movie playback.
Basic information display modes
In the simplest display mode, officially called Single Image display, your 
photo appears as shown in Figure 4-10. 
Along the top of the screen, you see 
the following bits of information, 
labeled in the figure:
 
✓ Shutter speed and f-stop (aper-
ture): Chapter 5 explains these 
two exposure settings.
 
✓ Exposure Compensation value: 
This option, also detailed in 
Chapter 5, enables you to pro-
duce a brighter or darker image 
than the camera’s autoexposure 
meter thinks appropriate. If you 
applied exposure compensation 
when you take a picture, the 
compensation amount appears 
to the right of the f-stop during 
playback. Otherwise, this area of 
the display is empty.
 
✓ Protect: Using the Protect 
feature, described later in this chapter, you can “lock” an image to pre-
vent it from being erased when you use the camera’s Erase function. 
(Formatting the memory card does delete the picture, however, so use 
caution.) If you protect the photo, a little key icon appears next to the 
Exposure Compensation value.
 
✓ Folder number and last four digits of file number: See Chapter 1 for 
information about how the camera assigns folder and file numbers.
From Single Image mode, press the DISP button again to shift to a mode 
called Single Image Plus Quality. 
Now you get two additional pieces of information, as shown in Figure 4-11:
 
✓ Image number/total images: This pair of values shows you the current 
image number and the total number of images on the memory card. For 
example, in Figure 4-11, you see picture 16 out of 38. (Don’t confuse the 
Shutter

image number with the actual 
file number; again, the last four 
digits of the file number appear 
in the top-right corner of the 
display, along with the folder 
number.)
 
✓ Quality setting: This setting, 
covered in Chapter 3, deter-
mines the image resolution 
(pixel count) and file format 
(JPEG or Raw).
 
 The Quality symbols shown 
during playback are the same 
ones used to indicate the 
Quality setting on the camera 
menus and Shooting Settings 
screen. Figure 4-11 shows the 
symbol that represents the 
Large/Fine setting. Chapter 3 
has a chart to help you decode 
the other symbols.
To view additional details about the settings you used to take a picture, 
switch to Shooting Information display mode or Histogram display mode. 
The next sections explain how to interpret the data that appears in these two 
modes.
Shooting Information display
In the Shooting Information display 
mode, the camera presents a thumb-
nail of your image along with scads 
of shooting data, as shown in Figure 
4-12. To get to this screen, first dis-
play your photo in full-frame view. 
The Shooting Information display isn’t 
available in Index display (when four 
or nine thumbnails are displayed at 
a time). Then press the DISP button 
as many times as needed to cycle 
through the four information-display 
options until you see the one shown 
in the figure.
The chartlike thingy on the right side 
of the screen is an exposure-evaluation tool known as a histogram. You get 
schooled in the art of reading histograms in the next section.

setting information to the basic display.
Figure 4-12: You can view more data in 
Shooting Information Playback mode.

96
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
If any areas of the image thumbnail are blinking, you don’t need a histogram 
to know that you may have an exposure problem. Those blinking spots 
indicate pixels that are completely white. An abundance of blinking spots 
can indicate a problem known as blown or clipped highlights, where areas 
that should contain a range of light shades are so overexposed that they are 
instead a solid blob of white. Depending on where in the image those areas 
occur, you may or may not want to retake the photo. For example, if some-
one’s face contains the blinking spots, you should take steps to correct the 
problem. But if the blinking occurs in, say, a bright window behind the sub-
ject, and the subject looks fine, you may choose to just ignore the alert.
To sort out the maze of other data, it helps to break the display down into 
five rows of information — the row along the top of the screen and the four 
rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histogram, as follows:
 
✓ Row 1 data: Here you see the same data that appears in the two basic 
display modes, explained in the preceding section.
 
✓ Row 2 data: Shift your attention now to the row of symbols just under-
neath the thumbnail and histogram. Labeled in Figure 4-13, these sym-
bols indicate the following:
 
Metering mode
Highlight Tone Priority
Exposure
mode
Flash
Compensation
ISO speed
 
Figure 4-13: This row contains additional exposure information.
 
• Exposure mode: This symbol indicates which of the camera’s 
exposure modes you used — Full Auto, Av (aperture-priority auto-
exposure), Portrait, and so on. The symbols mirror what you see 
on the camera Mode dial. You can find details about all the modes 
in Chapters 2 and 5.
 
• Metering mode: This symbol represents the metering mode, which 
determines which part of the frame the camera uses when calculat-
ing exposure. Chapter 5 explains.
 
• Flash Compensation amount: Here you can see whether you 
adjusted flash power using the Flash Compensation feature, 
detailed in Chapter 5.

97
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
• ISO speed: Chapter 5 also explains this option, which controls the 
light sensitivity of the camera’s image sensor.
 
• Highlight Tone Priority: If you enabled this exposure feature for the 
shot, you see the little D+ symbol. See Chapter 5 to find out how 
Highlight Tone Priority affects your photos.
 
✓ Row 3 data: Information on this row of the display, labeled in Figure 4-14, 
mostly relates to color settings. Here’s the scoop:
 
White balance
White Balance correction
Picture Style
 
Figure 4-14: Look to this row for details about advanced color settings.
 
• White Balance setting: Chapter 6 has details on this option, which 
helps ensure accurate photo colors. The setting shown in the 
figure, AWB, stands for Auto White Balance. See the table in 
Chapter 6 for a look at the symbols representing other White 
Balance settings.
 
• White Balance correction: This collection of data tells you whether 
you applied any adjustment to the White Balance setting you used. 
Chapter 6 explains this advanced color option.
 
• Picture Style: Notice that the symbol shown here looks similar to 
the one on the bottom cross key on the camera back. You can use 
that cross key to access Picture Styles, which enable you to tweak 
image color, contrast, and sharpness. In the playback display, 
you see the same symbol plus a letter that indicates the Picture 
Style you used for the photo. The S in Figure 4-14 represents the 
Standard Picture Style, for example. The values to the right relate 
to four characteristics that you can adjust for each Picture Style. 
Chapter 6 explains how each Picture Style affects your image.
 
✓ Row 4 data: Shown at the top of Figure 4-15, this row tells you the fol-
lowing tidbits of information:
 
• Quality and file size: For details on the Quality setting and its affect 
on file size and picture quality, see Chapter 3. File size is shown in 
megabytes (MB).

98
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Color space
File size
Original decision data
Quality
Date/time
Image number/
total images
 
Figure 4-15: The bottom two rows of the display offer this data.
 
• Original Decision Data: The Rebel T1i/500D enables you to tag an 
image file with a code that indicates that the image is original — 
meaning that it hasn’t been altered in a photo program or other-
wise tampered with after it was captured. To check the code, you 
need a separate product called the Original Data Verification Kit, 
which retails for about $700, unfortunately. If you do enable the 
feature on the camera, which I explain how to do in Chapter 11, a 
lock icon appears in this area of the playback screen.
 
• Color space: Your camera can capture images in two color spaces, 
sRGB and Adobe RGB. A color space is a definition of the spectrum 
of colors that an image can contain. You can change color spaces 
only in advanced exposure modes; Chapter 6 has details about 
how and why to do so.
 
✓ Row 5 data: Wrapping up the smorgasbord of shooting data, the bottom 
row of the playback screen holds two more pieces of information, as 
shown in Figure 4-15:
 
• Image number/total images recorded: Again, this pair of numbers 
indicates the current image number with respect to the total 
number of images on the current memory card. 
 
• Date and time: These values show you the exact moment that the 
image was recorded. Of course, you must first set the camera date 
and time, as Chapter 1 explains.
 
One note about Figures 4-12 through 4-15: I included all possible symbols, 
values, and other shooting data just for the purposes of illustration. If any of 
the data items don’t appear on your monitor, it simply means that the feature 
wasn’t enabled when you captured the photo.

99
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
Understanding Histogram display mode
A variation of the Shooting Information display, Histogram display offers the 
data you see in Figure 4-16. Again, you get the thumbnail view of your image, 
but this time some of the extensive 
shooting data is replaced by a second 
histogram.
The next two sections explain what 
information you can glean from the 
histograms. See the preceding sec-
tions for a map to the other shooting 
data on the screen.
 
 As with the Shooting Information dis-
play, this one is only available when 
you’re viewing photos one at a time. 
If your monitor is showing four or 
nine thumbnails, press the AF Point 
Selection button to get to full-frame 
view. Then press DISP as needed to 
get to the Histogram display.
Interpreting a brightness histogram
 
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo-editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in 
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include 
a variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud 
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white because of 
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Shooting Information display mode, areas that fall into this category blink 
in the image thumbnail. This warning is a great feature because simply view-
ing the image on the camera monitor isn’t always a reliable way to gauge 
exposure. The relative brightness of the monitor and the ambient light in 
which you view it affect the appearance of the image onscreen. 
For a detailed analysis of the image exposure, check the Brightness histogram, 
which is a little graph that indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights, 
and midtones (areas of medium brightness) in your image, as shown in Figure 
4-17. Photographers use the term tonal range to describe this aspect of their 
pictures. The Brightness histogram appears to the right of the image thumb-
nail in Shooting Information display mode and in the lower-right corner in 
Histogram display mode.
RGB Histogram
Figure 4-16: Histogram display mode replaces 
some shooting data with an RGB histogram.

100
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The horizontal axis of the graph 
represents the possible picture 
brightness values, from the darkest 
shadows on the left to the bright-
est highlights on the right. And the 
vertical axis shows you how many 
pixels fall at a particular brightness 
value. A spike indicates a heavy con-
centration of pixels. For example, in 
Figure 4-17, which shows the histo-
gram for the lily image in Figure 4-16, 
the histogram indicates a broad 
range of brightness values, but with 
the majority of pixels falling between 
medium and maximum brightness. 
 
Keep in mind that there is no one 
“perfect” histogram that you should 
try to achieve. Instead, you need to 
interpret the histogram with respect 
to the amount of shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your sub-
ject. For example, the histogram in Figures 4-16 and 4-17 makes sense for this 
particular image because the subject contains mostly light colors, with only a 
few dark ones. Pay attention, however, if you see a very high concentration of 
pixels at the far right or left end of the histogram, which can indicate a seri-
ously overexposed or underexposed image, respectively.
Reading an RGB histogram
When you view your images in 
Histogram display mode, you see 
two histograms: the Brightness histo-
gram, covered in the preceding sec-
tion, and an RGB histogram, shown in 
Figure 4-18.
To make sense of the RGB histo-
gram, you first need to know that 
digital images are called RGB images 
because they are created out of 
three primary colors of light: red, 
green, and blue. The RGB histogram 
shows you the brightness values for 
each of those primary colors.
By checking the brightness levels 
of the individual color components, 
sometimes referred to as color chan-
nels, you can assess the picture’s 
Shadows
Highlights
Figure 4-17: The Brightness histogram indicates 
the tonal range of your image.
Less saturated
More saturated
Figure 4-18: The RGB histogram can indicate 
problems with color saturation.

101
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
color saturation levels. If most of the pixels for one or more channels 
are clustered toward the right end of the histogram, colors may be over-
saturated, which destroys detail. On the flip side, a heavy concentration 
of pixels at the left end of the histogram indicates an image that may be 
undersaturated.
A savvy RGB histogram reader can also spot color balance issues by look-
ing at the pixel values. But frankly, color balance problems are fairly easy 
to notice just by looking at the image on the camera monitor. And under-
standing how to translate the histogram data for this purpose requires more 
knowledge about RGB color theory than I have room to present in this book.
 
If you are a fan of RGB histograms, however, you may be interested in 
another possibility: You can swap the standard Brightness histogram that 
appears in Shooting Information playback mode with the RGB histogram. Just 
visit Playback Menu 2, highlight the Histogram option, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-19, and press the Set button to display the right screen in the figure. 
Select RGB instead of Brightness and press the Set button again.
 
 
Figure 4-19: You can change the histogram type that appears in Shooting Information 
 
display mode.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Deleting Photos
When you spot a clunker during your picture review, you can erase it from 
your memory card in a couple of ways, as outlined in the next three sections.

102
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Erasing single images
To delete photos one at a time, take these steps:
 
1. Select the image that you want to delete.
 
 If you are viewing images in sin-
gle-frame mode, just display the 
image on the monitor. In Index 
display mode, use the cross keys 
to move the highlight box over 
the image thumbnail.
 
 
2. Press the Erase button, shown in 
the margin here.
 
 The words Cancel and Erase 
appear at the bottom of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 4-20.
 
3. Press the right cross key to 
highlight Erase and then press 
the Set button.
 
 Your picture is zapped into digital oblivion.
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore 
it by using data-restoration software. One memory card manufacturer, 
SanDisk, even provides this type of software free with some of its memory 
cards. You also can buy stand-alone programs such as MediaRecover ($30, 
www.mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also $30, www.lexar.com). 
But to have a chance at recovering deleted data, you must not take any more 
pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the current 
memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture data for 
good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Erasing all images on your memory card
To dump all pictures on the memory card, take this approach:
 
1. Display Playback Menu 1 and highlight Erase Images, as shown on the 
left in Figure 4-21.
 
2. Press the Set button to display the right screen in Figure 4-21.
 
3. Highlight All Images on Card and press the Set button.
 
 After you press Set, you see a confirmation screen asking whether you 
really want to delete all of your pictures.
Figure 4-20: Highlight Erase and press Set to 
delete the current image.

103
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
 
Figure 4-21: Use the Erase option on Playback Menu 1 to delete multiple images quickly.
 
4. Select OK and press Set to go ahead and dump the photos.
 
 Note, though, that pictures that you have protected, a step discussed 
two sections from now, are left intact.
 
5. Press Menu to return to Playback Menu 1.
 
 Or press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting pictures.
Erasing selected images
If you want to erase many, but not all, images on your memory card, you can 
save time by using this deleting option:
 
1. On Playback Menu 1, highlight Erase Images, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-22, and press Set.
 
 You see the main Erase Images screen, shown on the right in Figure 4-22.
 
 
Figure 4-22: You can delete multiple selected images at once.

104
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
2. Highlight Select and Erase Images and press the Set button.
 
 You see the current image in the monitor. At the top of the screen, a 
little check box appears, as shown on the left in Figure 4-23.
 
Marked for deletion
 
Figure 4-23: Use the up and down cross keys to check the box for images you want to delete.
 
3. Press the up or down cross key to put a check mark in the box and tag 
the image for deletion.
 
 If you change your mind, press the cross key again to remove the check 
mark.
 
4. Press the left or right cross keys to view the next image.
 
5. Keep repeating Steps 3 and 4 until you mark all of the images that you 
want to trash.
 
 
 If you don’t need to inspect each image closely, you can display up to 
three thumbnails per screen, as shown in the right image in Figure 4-23. 
Just press the AE Lock button, shown in the margin, to shift into this dis-
play. Again, just use the up and down cross keys to mark images for 
deletion, and use the right and left cross keys to advance through your 
images.
 
 
 To return to full-frame view, press the AF Point Selection button, shown 
in the margin. And if you need an even closer look, keep pressing the 
button to switch from full-frame view to a magnified view. Use the tech-
niques outlined earlier in this chapter, in the section “Zooming in for a 
closer view,” to adjust the magnification power and scroll the display to 
view other areas of the image.
 
 
6. Press the Erase button.
 
 You see a confirmation screen asking whether you really want to get rid 
of the selected images.

105
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
7. Highlight OK and press Set.
 
 The selected images are deleted, and you return to the Erase Images 
menu.
 
8. Press Menu to return to Playback Menu 1.
 
 Or, to continue shooting, press the shutter button halfway.
Protecting Photos
You can protect pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to delete a pic-
ture from your memory card, whether you press the Erase button or use the 
Erase Images option on Playback Menu 1.
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures. 
See the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature is especially handy if you share a camera with 
other people. You can protect pictures so that those other people know that 
they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make room on the memory 
card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This step isn’t foolproof, 
though, because anyone can remove the protected status from an image.)
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format com-
mand, which lives on Setup Menu 1 and erases 
everything on your memory card. What’s the 
difference between erasing photos by format-
ting and by using the Erase Images option on 
Playback Menu 1 to delete all your pictures?
Well, in terms of pictures taken with your 
Rebel, none. But if you happen to have stored 
other data on the card, such as a music file or 
a picture taken on another type of camera, you 
need to format the card to erase everything on 
it. You can’t view those files on the monitor, so 
you can’t use the Erase Images feature to get 
rid of them.
One final — and important — note: Although 
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere 
in this chapter) prevents the Erase function from 
erasing a picture, formatting erases all pictures, 
protected or not. Formatting also ensures that 
the card is properly prepared to store any new 
images you may take.

Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a 
“read-only” file when you transfer it to a computer. Files that have that 
read-only status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy 
can remove the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing 
around with your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system.
Of course, you have to know how to remove the read-only status if you plan 
to edit your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Canon ZoomBrowser EX, 
the free Windows-based software that ships with your camera, you can do this 
by clicking the image thumbnail and choosing File➪Protect. That command 
toggles image protection on and off. In ImageBrowser, the Mac version of the 
Canon software, set the thumbnail display to List Mode and click the photo 
thumbnail. Then choose File➪Get Info and then click the Lock box to toggle file 
protection on and off. See Chapter 8 for help with using these programs.)
Anyway, protecting a picture on the camera is easy. Just take these steps:
 
1. Display Playback Menu 1 and highlight Protect Images, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-24.
 
 
Figure 4-24: Apply Protect status to prevent accidental erasure of important images.
 
2. Press Set.
 
 An image appears on the monitor, along with a little key icon in the 
upper-left corner, as shown on the right in Figure 4-24.
 
3. Navigate to the picture that you want to protect.
 
 Just press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
 
4. Press Set to lock the picture.
 
 Now a key icon appears with the data at the top of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 4-25.

107
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
5. To lock more pictures, repeat 
Steps 3 and 4.
 
6. Press the Menu button to exit 
the protection process.
To remove picture protection while 
the picture card is still in the camera, 
follow these same steps. When you 
display the locked picture, just press 
Set to turn the protection off. The 
little key icon disappears from the 
top of the screen to let you know 
that the picture is no longer 
protected.
Using Your Monitor as a Viewfinder
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot digital camera, you may be used 
to composing your pictures on the camera monitor rather than by looking 
through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact cameras no longer even offer 
a viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my opinion. Why? Because when you 
use the monitor to frame the image, you must hold the camera away from 
your body, a shooting posture that increases the likelihood of blurry images 
caused by camera shake. When you use the viewfinder, you can brace the 
camera against your face, creating a much steadier shooting stance.
Because of some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, most digi-
tal SLR cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your 
T1i/500D, however, does offer that feature, known as Live View. But using 
your monitor as a viewfinder on your camera isn’t quite as simple as when 
you use a point-and-shoot, non-SLR model — again, the difference is because 
of the more involved design of an SLR camera.
 
Here are the important points to know before you experiment with Live View 
shooting:
 
✓ Live View is available only in advanced exposure modes. That is, you 
must set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
 
✓ Manual focusing is recommended. You can use autofocusing, but 
manual focusing usually offers faster, more precise results. If you want 
to try autofocusing anyway, Chapter 6 tells you what you need to know.
 
✓ Enabling the Auto Lighting Optimizer function may produce an over-
exposed photo. For best exposure results, disable the option. Visit 
Setup Menu 3 and set Custom Function 7 to the Off setting. (Chapter 5 
Protected icon
Figure 4-25: The key icon indicates that the 
picture is protected.

108
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
explains Auto Lighting Optimizer in more detail; Chapter 11 discusses 
more Custom Functions.)
 
✓ Some functions are disabled or limited in Live View mode. Here’s the 
list of affected features:
 
• Flash: Flash Exposure lock, covered in Chapter 5, is disabled. 
Additionally, non-Canon flash units will not work in Live View 
mode. And here’s one more quirk: When you take a flash shot in 
Live View mode, the camera’s shutter sound leads you to believe 
that two shots have been recorded; in reality, though, only one 
photo is captured.
 
• A-DEP mode: This mode functions the same as P (programmed 
autoexposure), meaning that it no longer tries to achieve a depth 
of field that keeps all objects in the frame in sharp focus. Chapter 
5 explains more about these two modes; Chapter 6 details depth of 
field and its creative impact on your pictures.
 
• Continuous shooting: You can use the Continuous Drive mode, 
introduced in Chapter 2, but the camera will use the exposure set-
tings chosen for the first frame for all the images. And as with flash 
shots, you hear two shutter sounds for the first frame in your con-
tinuous sequence.
 
• Metering mode: You cannot use Center-Weighted Average, Partial, 
or Spot exposure metering; the camera always uses Evaluative 
metering in Live View mode. Chapter 5 explains metering modes.
 
 
• AE Lock: During normal photography, pressing the AE Lock button 
(shown in the margin) locks the current autoexposure settings. So, 
for example, if you set exposure on your subject, apply AE Lock, 
and then reframe the shot, the camera doesn’t adjust exposure for 
the new framing. But during Live View shooting, the AE Lock 
button is used to initiate autofocusing. So you have to use a little 
workaround: Open Setup Menu 3, select Custom Functions, and 
then set Custom Function 10 to option 1, AE lock/AF. At this set-
ting, pressing the shutter button halfway locks the autoexposure 
settings until you take the picture. The AE Lock button then 
initiates autofocus both during Live View shooting and normal 
photography. 
 
 To find out more about locking exposure when you’re not using 
Live View mode, check out Chapter 5; Chapter 11 covers the 
AE Lock Custom Function in detail. I don’t recommend that you 
change the setting while you’re learning the camera, however, 
because the buttons won’t function as they’re described in this 
book if you do.

109
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
• Mirror Lock-Up and Set button functions: You can’t enable mirror 
lock-up (Custom Function 9) in Live View mode. Also, any custom 
settings that you apply to the Set button (Custom Function 11) 
don’t work in Live View mode. Instead, the Set button switches the 
Live View display into Quick Control mode, as it does during regu-
lar shooting, so that you can adjust certain picture settings easily.
 
✓ You must be extra careful to keep the camera steady. Just as with a 
point-and-shoot camera, holding the camera out in front of you to cap-
ture the image can cause slight camera shake that can blur your image. 
But with an SLR, the risk is greater because of the added weight of the 
camera and lens. And if you use a so-called long lens — a telephoto or 
zoom lens that extends to a long focal length — the potential for camera 
shake is compounded. So for best results, mount the camera on a tripod 
when you use Live View.
 
✓ Using Live View for an extended period can reduce picture quality 
and harm your camera. When you work in Live View mode, the cam-
era’s innards heat up more than usual, and that extra heat can create 
the right electronic conditions for noise, a defect that gives your pic-
tures a speckled look. (Chapter 5 offers more information.) Perhaps 
more critically, the increased temperatures can damage the camera.
 
 
 If the symbol shown in the margin appears on the monitor, the camera is 
warning you that it’s getting too hot. If you continue shooting and the 
temperature continues to increase, the camera will automatically shut 
off to prevent further damage. But don’t let things get to that point: Your 
pictures will probably be noisy and you risk permanently harming the 
camera. So when you see the symbol, turn the camera off or at least exit 
Live View mode for a few minutes. You can then return to Live View 
mode and capture the image. Keep in mind that in extremely warm envi-
ronments, you may not be able to use Live View mode for very long 
before the system shuts down. 
 
✓ Aiming the lens at the sun or other bright lights also can damage the 
camera. Of course, you can cause problems doing this even during 
normal shooting, but the potential risk increases when you use Live 
View. You not only can harm the camera’s internal components but also 
the monitor.
Live View also has the same two other disadvantages that you get when you 
frame with the monitor on a point-and-shoot camera: 
 
✓ Any time you use the camera monitor, whether it’s for composing a 
shot or reviewing your images, you put extra strain on the battery. So 
keep an eye on the battery status icon to avoid running out of juice at a 
critical moment. 
 
✓ The monitor display can wash out in bright sunlight. You may find it 
difficult to compose outdoor shots in Live View mode.

110
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
This laundry list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m advising you not to use Live 
View, however — just that you shouldn’t envision it as a full-time alternative 
to your viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can help in 
shooting situations where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome.
 
I find Live View most helpful for still life, tabletop photography, especially in 
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I 
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a 
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, set 
up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then there’s 
a period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If I’m shoot-
ing from a high angle, requiring a camera position above the table and point-
ing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a stepladder to check 
things out through the viewfinder between each compositional or lighting 
change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop height or below, I have 
to either bend over or kneel to look through the viewfinder, causing no end of 
later aches in my back and knees. With Live View, I can alleviate much of that 
bothersome routine (and pain) because I can usually see how things look in 
the monitor no matter the camera position.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the next few sections show you 
how to enable Live View and briefly introduce the process of Live View 
shooting. Also see Chapter 5 for details about monitoring and adjusting 
exposure in Live View mode; check out Chapter 6 for Live View autofocusing 
options.
Enabling Live View
Before you can use Live View, you must take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
 You can use Live View only in these exposure modes. Chapter 5 explains 
them all; for now, choose P (programmed autoexposure) if you’re not 
familiar with the other modes and you want to experiment with Live 
View.
 
2. Press the Menu button and display Setup Menu 2.
 
3. Highlight Live View Function Settings, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-26.
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 4-26.
 
5. Highlight Live View Shoot and press the Set button.
 
 Now you see the screen shown in Figure 4-27.

111
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
 
Figure 4-26: You must enable Live View through Setup Menu 2.
 
6. Select Enable and press Set.
 
 The Live View Function Settings 
screen reappears
 
7. Adjust the metering timing 
(optional).
 
 When you press the shutter button 
halfway, the camera’s exposure 
meter comes to life and displays 
the current aperture and shutter 
speed on the monitor. By default, 
the exposure meter and the display 
turn off after 16 seconds of inactiv-
ity to conserve battery power. You 
can adjust this timing through the 
Metering Timer option, shown on the right in Figure 4-26. Highlight the 
option, press Set, and then select a time option. Your choices range from 
4 seconds to 30 minutes. Press Set once more after making your selection. 
Chapter 5 explains aperture, shutter speed, and other exposure matters in 
detail.
 
8. Press the Menu button to return to Setup Menu 2.
 
 You’re now ready for Live View shooting; see the next section for help 
taking your first picture.
Taking a shot in Live View mode
After you enable Live View through Setup Menu 2, follow these steps to take 
a picture. 
Figure 4-27: Highlight Enable and press the 
Set button.

112
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
1. Check the setting on the Mode dial on top of the camera.
 
 Remember, you must set the dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP to use Live 
View.
 
2. Set the focus switch on your lens to MF (for manual focus).
 
 For reasons explained in the preceding introduction to Live View shoot-
ing, I (and Canon) recommend manual focusing. If you want to use auto-
focus, Chapter 6 spells out how to do so. For now, just keep in mind that 
when autofocusing is enabled, the screen you see on your monitor will 
look a little different from those you see in this chapter.
 
 If you use a lens other than the kit lens sold with the Rebel T1i/500D, the 
switch that shifts you to manual focus may sport a label other than MF. 
Consult the lens manual for specifics.
 
3. If the camera is mounted on a tripod, turn off the Image Stabilizer 
feature.
 
 Image stabilization isn’t necessary when you shoot with a tripod. And 
because it consumes extra battery power, turning it off is a good idea for 
Live View tripod shooting with most lenses. However, check your lens 
manual just to be sure: Some lens manufacturers vary in their recom-
mendations on this issue.
 
 
4. Press the Live View button to switch from normal viewfinder opera-
tion to the Live View preview.
 
 Now your scene appears in the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-28. (If 
nothing happens when you press the button, you need to return to the 
preceding section and follow the steps to enable Live View.)
 
 Four different display options 
are available during Live View 
shooting, so don’t panic if your 
screen contains either more 
onscreen data than the one in 
the figure or no data at all. The 
next section explains the dis-
play options and how to inter-
pret everything you see. For 
now, just press the DISP button 
to cycle through the display 
modes.
 
5. Frame the shot as desired.
 
6. Press the cross keys to move 
the focusing frame over the 
spot where you want to focus.
Focusing frame
Figure 4-28: Place the center square over the 
point where you want to establish focus.

113
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
 The focusing frame is that rectangle in the center of the screen, labeled 
in Figure 4-28.
 
 To put the focusing frame smack in the middle of the screen, press the 
Erase button (the one that sports the trash can symbol).
 
7. Turn the focusing ring to set initial focus.
 
 On the kit lens, the focusing ring is at the far end of the lens. (See 
Chapter 1 if you need help.)
 
 
8. To magnify the view and verify focus, press the AF Point Selection 
button (optional).
 
 
 By pressing the button, you magnify the area within the focusing frame. 
Your first press of the button magnifies the view by 5, as shown on the 
left in Figure 4-29. The second press zooms to 10 times magnification, as 
shown on the right. Press again to return to the normal view. 
 
Magnified image area
 
Figure 4-29: Magnify the preview to double-check focus.
 
 In the lower-right corner of the monitor, you see a label showing the cur-
rent magnification level. Underneath that label, the box inside the small 
rectangle indicates the portion of the overall frame that’s currently vis-
ible. If needed, you can reposition the focusing frame to check another 
part of the image by using the cross keys.
 
 If focus passes inspection, move on; if not, keep adjusting the focusing 
ring until things look good.
 
9. Press the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure metering.
 
 If needed, you can adjust exposure by using the options covered in 
Chapter 5, keeping in mind the restrictions pointed out at the start of 
the Live View discussion. (For example, you can’t select a metering 
mode other than Evaluative.)

114
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
10. Press the shutter button fully to take the shot.
 
 You see your just-captured image on the monitor for a few seconds 
before the Live View preview returns.
 
 11. To exit the Live View preview, press the Live View button.
 
 
 You return to the standard Shooting Settings screen. You can then 
return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
 
Note that turning the monitor preview off via the Live View button does not 
officially disable Live View functionality; you must revisit the Live View Shoot 
option on Setup Menu 2 to do that.
Customizing Live View shooting data
When you first use Live View mode, you see your subject and the basic 
shot settings shown in Figure 4-28. From that screen, you can press DISP to 
display a second assortment of settings. A third press of the button adds a 
brightness histogram into the mix, and a fourth hides all shooting data, leav-
ing just your image and the focusing frame on the screen. Press DISP again to 
return to the default display.
Figure 4-30 serves as your road map to the maxed-out data display; the fol-
lowing list gives you the guided tour:
 
✓ Data along the bottom of the screen is similar to what you nor-
mally see in the viewfinder display. With the exception of the Shots 
Remaining value and Battery status symbol, these settings relate to 
exposure issues you can explore in Chapter 5. The Flash Compensation 
and Highlight Tone Priority symbols appear only if you enable those 
features.
 
✓ The Autofocus mode symbol appears regardless of whether you have 
your lens set to manual or autofocus. The symbol tells you which of the 
three possible Autofocus options is selected; Chapter 6 discusses the 
options and explains Live View autofocusing.
 
✓ Some of the other symbols on the left side of the screen are the same 
as when you view shooting information in Playback mode. I discuss 
this topic earlier in the chapter; here’s a quick reminder:
 
• Picture Style: Chapter 6 details Picture Styles, which affect picture 
color, contrast, and sharpness. The symbol you see in Figure 4-30 
represents the Standard style.
 
• White Balance: The initials AWB, shown in the figure, represent 
Auto White Balance. To see what icons for other settings look 
like and find out what white balance does in the first place, visit 
Chapter 6.

shutter button. See the end of Chapter 2 for information about 
other Drive modes.
 
• Quality: This icon tells you the selected Quality setting, which 
Chapter 3 explains. The symbol shown in the figure represents the 
Large/Fine Quality setting.
 
• AE (autoexposure) lock and flash status: The asterisk tells you that 
autoexposure lock is in force; a steady flash symbol tells you that 
the flash is ready to fire. Neither symbol appears if you don’t use 
these features, both of which you can read about in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Symbols in the lower-right corner indicate the following: 
 
• AEB and FEB: The first symbol appears when you enable automatic 
exposure bracketing (AEB), an exposure tool I cover in Chapter 5. 
The second symbol stands for flash exposure bracketing (FEB), a 
function that’s possible only when you shoot with a compatible 
Canon Speedlite external flash; see the flash unit’s manual for help 
with this option.

116
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
• Exp.SIM: This symbol, which stands for Exposure Simulation, indi-
cates whether the image brightness you see on the monitor is 
simulating the actual exposure that you will record. If the symbol 
blinks or is dimmed, the camera can’t provide an accurate expo-
sure preview, which can occur if the ambient light is either very 
bright or very dim. Exposure Simulation is also disabled when you 
use flash in Live View mode.
 
✓ The brightness histogram is another tool you can use to gauge 
whether your current settings will produce a good exposure. See the 
section “Interpreting a brightness histogram,” earlier in this chapter, 
to find out how to make sense of what you see. When you use flash, 
however, the histogram is dimmed (and what you can see isn’t accurate 
because it doesn’t reflect the exposure as it will be when the flash is 
used).
Using the Quick Control screen in Live View mode
 
Chapter 1 explains how you can use the Quick Control screen to adjust 
certain camera settings. In Live View mode, you can use the Quick Control 
method to adjust the Picture Style, White Balance, Drive mode, and Quality 
settings. If you opt for Live View autofocusing, you also can adjust the autofo-
cusing mode. (Chapter 6 explains autofocusing.)
To use this feature, press the Set 
button to activate the strip of icons 
on the left side of the screen. Then 
use the cross keys to highlight the 
option you want to adjust. Text 
appears at the bottom of the screen 
to show you the current setting. For 
example, in Figure 4-31, the Quality 
option is highlighted; the text label 
shows the Large/Fine setting is 
selected and the values that repre-
sent that setting: total megapixels, 
horizontal and vertical pixel count, 
and the number of shots that will fit 
on the memory card at this setting. 
(See Chapter 3 for the full story on 
the Quality setting and how to inter-
pret the data you see in the figure.)
After you highlight an icon on the left side of the screen, rotate the Main 
dial to cycle through the available settings. Press Set again to return to the 
normal Live View display and take the picture.

To adjust other picture-taking settings, you can use the standard menu or 
button/dial operations. For example, to adjust ISO, press the ISO button and 
rotate the Main dial.
Displaying an alignment grid
When you’re doing the kind of work 
for which Live View is best suited, 
such as taking product shots or cap-
turing other still-life subjects, the 
exact placement of objects in the 
frame can sometimes be important. 
To assist you in that regard, the 
camera can display a grid on the mon-
itor, as shown in Figure 4-32. 
To set the grid display, visit Setup 
Menu 2, highlight Live View Function 
Settings, and press the Set button. 
Then highlight Grid Display, as shown 
on the left in Figure 4-33, press the Set 
button, highlight Grid 1 or Grid 2, as 
shown on the right in the figure, and press Set again. Grid 1 gives you the 
loosely spaced gridlines shown in Figure 4-32; for a tighter grid, choose Grid 
2. Repeat the menu process and choose Off to lose the grid.
 
 
Figure 4-33: Enable the grid via the Live View Function Settings option on Setup Menu 2.
Recording Movies
Your camera offers a first for the Digital Rebel line: the ability to record digi-
tal movies. Although you experience a few more limitations recording live 
action with the T1i/500D than with a real video camera, it’s a fun option to 
have onboard nonetheless.
Figure 4-32: For help aligning objects in the 
frame, display the grid.

118
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Before I give you the specifics, here’s the broad overview of movie making:
 
✓ Movie quality: You can record movies at three different quality levels. 
The setting you choose determines the frame size and aspect ratio of 
the movie: 1920 x 1080, known as Full High-Definition; 1280 x 720, which 
qualifies as plain ol’ High Def; and 640 x 480, which gives you standard 
definition. The two higher-quality settings produce movies that have a 
16:0 aspect ratio, which is found on many new TV sets and computer 
monitors. The 640 x 480 setting delivers a 4:3 format, which fits old 
monitors and TVs like the ones in my house.
 
 The higher the Quality setting, the larger the size of the file needed to 
store the movie. At the highest setting, you can fit about 12 minutes of 
movie on a 4GB memory card; drop the setting to 640 x 480, and you can 
double the length of the movie. The Quality setting also determines the 
frame rate, explained next.
 
✓ Frame rate: The frame rate determines the smoothness of the playback. 
At the top Quality setting, the frame rate is 20 frames per second (fps). 
At the other two settings, the frame rate is 30 fps, which is the standard 
frame rate for television-quality video. In other words, movies shot at 
the super-duper high-def mode may play a little choppier than those at 
the two lower-quality settings.
 
✓ Maximum file size: The maximum file size for a movie is 4GB, regardless 
of the capacity of your memory card. When you reach that 4GB limit, 
the camera automatically stops recording. You can always start a new 
recording, however, and you can join the segments in a movie-editing 
program later if you want.
 
✓ Sound recording: You can record 
sound or shoot a silent movie. If you 
enable sound, note the position of the 
microphone: It’s the little four-holed 
area on the front of the camera, just 
above the EOS label, as shown in 
Figure 4-34. Make sure that you don’t 
inadvertently cover up the micro-
phone with your finger. And keep in 
mind that anything you say will be 
picked up by the mic along with any 
other audio present in the scene. I’m 
notorious for muttering various com-
ments and “actor” instructions during 
my movies; I’m sure that one day film 
students everywhere will write papers 
about this aspect of my oeuvre.
 
✓ Video format: Movies are created in 
the MOV format, which means you 
Microphone

camera’s internal microphone.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
can play them on your computer with most movie-playback programs. 
If you want to view your movies on a TV, you can connect the camera 
to the TV, as explained in Chapter 9. Or if you have the necessary com-
puter software, you can convert the MOV file to a format that a standard 
DVD player can recognize and then burn the converted file to a DVD. 
You also can edit your movie in a program that can work with MOV files.
 
✓ Still picture capture: You can snap a still shot during a movie record-
ing session. See the upcoming section “Shooting your first movie” for 
details.
So far, so good. None of the aforementioned details is terribly unusual or 
complicated. Where things get a little tricky for the would-be filmmaker are in 
the areas of focus and exposure:
 
✓ Focus: As with regular Live View photography, you can use autofocus-
ing to establish initial focus on your subject before you begin recording. 
You can choose from the same three autofocusing options available for 
Live View shooting, which I explain in Chapter 6. But after recording 
begins, the autofocus system lays down for a nap — it doesn’t automati-
cally adjust to keep your subject in focus. You can initiate autofocusing 
again during the recording, but the focus mechanism tends to “hunt” for 
the focus point, going in and out of focus until it locks onto something. 
So unless you’re recording a static subject — say, a guitar player sitting 
on a stool or a speaker at a lectern — opt for manual focusing. You can 
then adjust focus manually any time during the recording. 
 
 If you plan to zoom in and out, practice before the big event. It’s a bit of 
a challenge to zoom and focus at the same time, especially while hold-
ing the camera in front of you so that you can see the monitor. (A tripod 
makes the maneuver slightly easier.)
 
✓ Exposure: The camera automatically sets exposure based on the 
light throughout the entire scene. However, you can apply Exposure 
Compensation, which gives you some control over the autoexposure 
result, and you can apply AE Lock (autoexposure lock) to force the 
camera to stick with a certain set of exposure settings even if the light in 
the scene changes. See the next section to find out how to use these two 
features during movie recording.
Finally, all the precautions mentioned earlier in this chapter related to Live 
View — including the information about the camera’s internal temperature — 
apply to movie recording as well. (Flip to the first part of the section “Using 
Your Monitor as a Viewfinder” for details.)
With those bits and pieces of information in mind, the rest of this chapter 
explains how to set up, record, and play movies.

Changing the information display
 
 After you set the Mode dial to Movie mode, the viewfinder turns off, and you 
see your scene on the monitor. Initially, the screen looks like the one you see 
in Figure 4-35. The same focusing frame you get in Live View mode appears, 
and the bottom of the screen shows the exposure meter, battery status icon, 
and shots remaining value. If you press the shutter button halfway to engage 
the autoexposure meter, you also see the camera’s selected aperture (f-stop) 
and shutter speed, as shown in the figure.

Figure 4-35: The default Movie display contains only a few pieces of 
 
shooting data plus the focusing frame. 
 
As with Live View mode, you can press the DISP button to change the display 
mode. But this time, you get only three options: You can display the limited 
data shown in Figure 4-35, opt for the expanded data readout shown in Figure 
4-36, or hide all data, leaving just the focusing frame. 
A couple of items in these two figures warrant a little further explanation:
 
✓ The shutter speed, ISO, and shots remaining values relate only to any 
still shots that you may capture during a recording session. (See the 
upcoming section “Shooting your first movie” for details on that trick.) 
For movie recording, the camera controls the aperture and ISO settings 
for you, and shutter speed is irrelevant.

✓ The Picture Style and White Balance options work as they do for 
normal photography. Picture Style affects color, contrast, and sharp-
ness; White Balance enables you to deal with lighting conditions that 
may create an unwanted tint or color cast. Chapter 6 explains both 
features.
 
✓ The exposure meter works as it does when you take still pictures in 
the P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP modes, which is to say that it indicates the 
amount of Exposure Compensation that’s applied. This feature enables 
you to request that the camera adjust the brightness of your next 
recording. It will also affect any still shots that you take. If the little white 
bar under the meter is at the center position, as in the figures, no com-
pensation has been applied. See the section “Shooting your first movie” 
for help with this setting.
 
✓ The Movie Size/Time Remaining value shows you the recording size 
you selected along with the length of the movie that will fit on your 
memory card if you stick with that size.
 
✓ The Still Quality setting indicates the Quality option that will be used 
if you take a still photo. Chapter 3 explains the Quality option, which 
controls resolution and format (JPEG or Raw).
 
✓ The Exposure Simulation icon works the same way as in Live View 
mode, although the little symbol is different. If it appears white, as in 
the figure, you can expect your movie to be about as bright as what you 
see in the monitor. In very dim or very bright light, the monitor may 
not be able to provide an accurate representation of the movie bright-
ness and lets you know by dimming the Exposure Simulation symbol. 
The movie will still record at the best exposure settings the camera can 
select, however.

Setting basic recording options
Before you begin shooting your first movie, it’s a good idea to review the 
basic recording settings. You adjust some settings via the Movie menu; for 
others, you can either visit menus or, for faster results, use the Quick Control 
method.
The next three sections provide some details on the recording settings; Table 
4-1 offers a quick reminder of where you can find the various movie settings.

Reviewing options on the Movie menu
 
 The Movie menu contains several 
recording options, including the one 
that enables or disables sound. Before 
you can access the Movie menu, 
shown in Figure 4-37, you must set the 
camera’s Mode dial to the Movie set-
ting. After your image appears on the 
monitor, press the Menu button and 
then find your way to the Movie menu. 
Here’s a rundown of the menu 
options:
 
✓ Grid display: As with Live View 
shooting, you can display two dif-
ferent styles of grids to help keep 
your shots aligned properly. Choose Grid 1 for a loosely spaced grid 
(refer to Figure 4-32); choose Grid 2 for a more tightly spaced grid. For 
no grid, leave the option set to the default, Off.
 
✓ Metering timer: This option works exactly as it does for regular Live 
View shooting. To recap: When you press the shutter button halfway, 
the exposure meter comes to life, and the camera then establishes the 
autoexposure settings needed to produce a good exposure. To save 
battery power, the meter goes to sleep after 16 seconds, but you can 
Figure 4-37: Turn sound recording on or off 
via the Movie menu.

123
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
request a shorter or longer delay through the Metering Timer menu 
option. (See Chapter 5 for a thorough explanation of the meter and 
exposure in general.)
 
✓ Movie Rec. Size: Use this option to specify the movie quality setting. See 
the preceding section for details that will help you choose.
 
✓ AF Mode: If you decide to try autofocusing, you can choose from three 
different autofocus methods. Chapter 6 spells out how these options 
work. (Again, though, manual focusing is recommended.)
 
✓ Sound Recording: Set this option to On if you want the camera to record 
sound. You can’t adjust the recording volume or attach an external 
microphone, unfortunately.
 
✓ Remote control: If you want to use the optional remote control unit to 
start and stop recording by, set this menu option to On. (For the RC-1 
remote unit, you also must set the timing switch to the 2-second delay to 
use it for movie recording.)
 
You also can adjust the recording size and AF mode through the Quick 
Control screen, which I find to be faster than going through the Movie menu. 
See the next section for details.
Adjusting settings through the Quick Control screen
 
As you can during Live View shooting, you can adjust some movie-recording 
settings by using the Quick Control technique. Follow these steps to use this 
method of adjusting recording settings:
 
1. Press Set to enter Quick 
Control mode.
 
 You see a column of control 
icons running down the left 
side of the screen. One of the 
icons is highlighted, as shown 
in Figure 4-37, and the bottom 
of the screen tells you the cur-
rent setting for that option. In 
Figure 4-38, the White Balance 
setting is highlighted, for exam-
ple, and Auto White Balance is 
in force.
 
2. Press the up or down cross 
keys to highlight the icon that 
represents the option you 
want to change.
Current setting

option
Figure 4-38: Press Set to shift to Quick Control 
mode and then use the Main dial to adjust the 
highlighted option.

124
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 As a reminder, from top to bottom, the icons enable you 
to adjust these settings:
 
• Autofocus mode
 
• Picture Style
 
• White Balance
 
• Movie size
 
• Still picture quality
 
 The earlier section “Changing the information display” provides some 
insight on these settings.
 
3. Rotate the Main dial to change the setting. 
 
4. Press Set again to exit Quick Control mode and return to the normal 
display.
Shooting your first movie
When you’re ready to try your hand at movie making, take these steps:
 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to the Movie setting.
 
 
 As soon as you select Movie mode, you can preview your shot on the 
monitor. You also see various bits of recording data on the screen; 
remember, you can press the DISP button to cycle through the different 
data display modes if you want more or less screen clutter.
 
2. Review and select the movie Quality, sound recording, and other 
options as explained in the preceding sections.
 
 If the Quality setting appears red, your memory card doesn’t have suf-
ficient free space to store your movie. You can try lowering the Quality 
setting; if that doesn’t work, you need to free some card space by delet-
ing pictures. (Refer to Figure 4-36 for a look at the icon that represents 
the Quality setting; again, you may need to press the DISP button to get 
to this display mode.)
 
3. Compose your shot.
 
4. Set focus.
 
 As in Live View mode, manual focusing is the best way to go, for all the 
reasons covered earlier in this chapter. So set the lens switch to MF and 
twist the focusing ring on the lens to bring your subject into focus.

125
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
 
 To double-check focus, you can use the same techniques as in Live View 
mode: 
 
 
• Use the cross keys to move the focusing frame over the area you 
want to inspect. Then press the AF Point Selection button once to 
zoom to a 5-times magnification; press again to zoom to 10 times 
magnification. Press the button once more to return to normal 
magnification.
 
 
• To return the focusing frame to dead center of the screen, press 
the Erase button.
 
5. Apply Exposure Compensation if desired. 
 
 You don’t really have much control over exposure during movie 
recording; the camera automatically sets all exposure options for you. 
However, you can tell the camera that you think that it’s over- or under-
exposing your movie and request that your next recording be a little 
darker or lighter.
 
 
 To apply this exposure shift, set the display to one of the two modes 
that reveals the exposure meter at the bottom of the screen. (Press DISP 
to change the display mode.) Then press and hold the Exposure 
Compensation button, shown in the margin. Rotate the dial to move the 
bar under the meter to the right for a brighter picture; move the indica-
tor left for a darker picture. Release the Exposure Compensation button 
when you finish.
 
 
6. Press the Live View button to 
start recording.
 
 A red “recording” symbol 
appears on the monitor, as 
shown in Figure 4-39.
 
 In the full-data display 
mode — the one where all the 
setting icons appear on the 
left side of the screen — all 
the icons except the movie 
recording Quality symbol 
disappear, as shown in the 
figure. Next to the icon, you 
no longer see the length of the 
recording that will fit on your 
memory card. Instead, the 
value represents the elapsed 
recording time.
 
7. To stop recording, press the Live View button.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
That’s all there is to the basic movie-shooting process. But I need to point 
out a few additional details — some minor, some not:
 
 
✓ Using AE Lock: Normally, the camera adjusts exposure during the 
recording as needed. If you prefer to lock in the exposure settings, you 
can do so through AE (autoexposure) Lock. But during movie recording, 
you initiate AE Lock by pressing the ISO button rather than the AE Lock 
button. After you begin recording, press and release the button. To 
cancel AE Lock, press the AF Point Selection button.
 
✓ Snapping a still photo during movie recording: You can interrupt your 
recording to take a still photo without actually exiting Movie mode. Just 
press the shutter button as usual to take the shot. The camera records 
the still photo as a regular image file, using the same Picture Style and 
White Balance setting you set for your movie. The Still Quality setting 
determines the picture resolution and file format.
 
 Here are a few drawbacks to capturing a still photo in Movie recording 
mode:
 
• If you’re shooting a movie at one of the two highest size settings, 
which capture a movie in the 16:9 aspect ratio, the area included in 
your still photo is different from what’s in the movie shots. All still 
photos have an aspect ratio of 3:2, so you gain some image area at 
the top and bottom and lose it from the sides. If the movie size is 
set to 640 x 480, the capture area is the same for the still photo and 
the recording.
 
• You can’t use flash, and you’re limited to the single Drive mode, 
recording one shot with each press of the shutter button. (Chapter 
2 explains Drive modes.)
 
• Perhaps most important, your movie will contain a still frame at 
the point you took the photo; the frame lasts about one second.
 
✓ Using the right memory 
cards: I mention this tip in 
Chapter 1, but it’s important 
enough to repeat: For the best 
movie recording and playback 
performance, use memory 
cards that have a speed rating 
of 6 or higher. And keep an 
eye out for the little data 
recording indicator you see 
in Figure 4-40. The indicator 
shows you how much movie 
data the camera has in its 
buffer — a temporary data 
storage tank — awaiting 
transfer to the memory card. 
Data-transfer alert
Figure 4-40: If the recording progress indicator 
keeps hitting the limit, buy a faster memory card.

127
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Mode
If the indicator level reaches the top, the camera will stop recording new 
data so that it can finish sending the existing data to the card. You can 
also try reducing the movie size setting to improve the transfer speed.
 
✓ Turning off Image Stabilization: If possible, turn off Image Stabilization 
to save battery power. On the kit lens, set the Stabilizer switch to the Off 
position.
 
 
✓ Paying attention to camera temperature: As in Live View mode, the 
camera’s internal temperature may increase significantly during movie 
recording, especially if you’re shooting in hot weather. The little ther-
mometer symbol on the screen is your cue to stop recording and turn 
off the camera to allow it to cool. If you ignore the warning, the camera 
will stop recording and prevent you from doing any more shooting until 
it cools.
Playing movies
Chapter 9 explains how to connect your camera to a television set for big-
screen movie playback. To view your movies on the camera monitor, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Press the Playback button and then locate the movie file.
 
 When reviewing pictures in 
full-frame view, you can spot a 
movie file by looking for the little 
movie camera icon in the top-left 
corner of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 4-41. 
 
 
 In Index playback, you see little 
“film sprocket” holes along the 
left edges of movie files. You can’t 
play movies in Index mode, so use 
the cross keys to high light the file 
you want to view and press the 
AF Point Selection button to get 
to full-frame view.
 
2. Press the Set button.
 
 Now you see a strip of playback controls at the bottom of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 4-42.
 
3. Use the cross keys to highlight the Play button and then press Set.
 
 The control strip disappears and your movie begins playing.
Figure 4-41: The little movie camera symbol 
tells you you’re looking at a movie file.

128
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
4. To adjust the volume, rotate the 
Main dial.
 
 Note the little white wheel in 
the volume display area of the 
screen — that icon reminds 
you to use the Main dial to 
adjust a setting. Rotating the 
dial controls only the camera 
speaker’s volume; if you connect 
the camera to a TV, control the 
volume on the TV instead. 
 
During playback, you can pause the 
movie and redisplay the control strip 
at any time by pressing Set. Here’s a 
look at what the various controls do:
 
✓ Play in slow motion: Highlight 
the Slow Motion button and 
press Set. Press the right cross 
key to increase the slow motion 
speed; press the left cross key 
to reduce it. (A little scale appears in the top-right corner of the screen 
to indicate where the current setting falls within the range of available 
slow motion speeds.) To exit slow motion playback, press Set. The con-
trol strip reappears; highlight the Play button and press Set to view the 
movie at normal speed.
 
✓ Display the first/last frame of the movie: Highlight the respective frame 
button, labeled in the figure, and press Set.
 
✓ Display the previous frame: Highlight the Previous button and press 
Set. Each press of the button takes you back a single frame.
 
✓ Display the next frame: Highlight the Next Frame button and press Set. 
Press repeatedly to keep advancing frame by frame.
 
✓ Fast forward or rewind: Highlight the Next Frame button and hold down 
the Set button to fast forward (although “fast” is a relative term here). 
Highlight the Previous Frame button and hold down Set to rewind.
 
✓ Exit movie playback: Highlight the Exit symbol and press Set.

Taking Creative Control

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your camera 
to automatic mode and let it handle most of 
the photographic decisions, I encourage you to 
also explore the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, 
Av, M, and A-DEP). In these modes, you can make 
your own decisions about the exposure, focus, 
and color characteristics of your photo, which is 
key to capturing an image as you see it in your 
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a 
genius or spend years to be successful — adding 
just a few simple techniques to your photographic 
repertoire can make a huge difference in how 
happy you are with the pictures you take. 
The ﬁ rst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing 
some necessary photography fundamentals and 
details about using the advanced exposure modes. 
Following that, Chapter 7 helps you draw together 
all the information presented earlier in the book, 
summarizing the best camera settings and other 
tactics to use when capturing portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-up shots.

y using the simple exposure modes covered in 
Chapter 2, you can take great pictures with your 
Rebel T1i/500D. But to really exploit your camera’s 
capabilities — and, more important, to exploit your 
creative capabilities — you need to explore your 
camera’s five advanced exposure modes, repre-
sented on the Mode dial by the letters P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP. 
This chapter explains everything you need to know 
to start taking advantage of these five modes. First, 
you get an introduction to three critical exposure con-
trols, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Adjusting these set-
tings enables you to not only fine-tune image exposure but 
also affect other aspects of your image, such as depth of field 
(the zone of sharp focus) and motion blur. In addition, this chapter 

132
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
explains other advanced exposure features, such as exposure compensation 
and metering modes, and discusses the flash options available to you in the 
advanced exposure modes. 
If you’re worried that this stuff is too complicated for you, by the way, don’t 
be. Even in these advanced exposure modes, the camera provides you with 
enough feedback that you’re never truly flying without a net. Between the 
in-camera support and the information in this chapter, you can easily master 
aperture, shutter speed, and all the other exposure features — an important 
step in making the shift from picture-taker to photographer.
Kicking Your Camera into Advanced Gear
In the Creative Auto mode, covered in Chapter 2, you can affect picture 
brightness and depth of field to some extent by using the Exposure and 
Background sliders. But you don’t have full control over either aspect of your 
images, and you don’t have any access to some camera options that can help 
you solve tough exposure problems. 
 
The moral of the story is that if you want to take full advantage of your cam-
era’s exposure tools, set the Mode dial to one of the five exposure modes 
highlighted in Figure 5-1: P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
Each of these modes offers a different level of control over two critical expo-
sure settings, aperture and shutter speed. Later in this chapter, I explain these 
controls fully, but here’s a quick 
introduction:
 
✓ P (programmed autoexpo-
sure): In this mode, the camera 
selects both the aperture and 
shutter speed for you, but you 
can choose from different 
combinations of the two. 
 
✓ Tv (shutter-priority autoex-
posure): In this mode, you 
select a shutter speed, and the 
camera chooses the aperture 
setting that produces a good 
exposure.
 
 Why Tv? Well, shutter speed 
controls exposure time; Tv 
stands for time value. 
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-1: To fully control exposure and 
other picture properties, choose one of these 
exposure modes.

133
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority 
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting — thus 
Av, for aperture value. The camera then selects the appropriate shutter 
speed to properly expose the picture.
 
✓ A-DEP (auto depth of field): Depth of field refers to the extent to which 
objects at a distance from your subject appear sharply focused. One 
way to control depth of field is to adjust the aperture setting. In A-DEP 
mode, the camera assesses the distance between the lens and major 
objects in the frame and tries to choose an aperture setting that keeps 
all those objects within the zone of sharp focus. Then the camera sets 
the shutter speed appropriate for the aperture it selected.
 
 Although this mode is a nice feature for photographers not yet schooled 
in manipulating depth of field, it provides the least amount of photo-
graphic control of all the advanced exposure modes because you’re stuck 
with whatever aperture and shutter speed the camera selects. In addition, 
when you use flash or enable Live View shooting, you lose the automatic 
depth-of-field feature, and A-DEP mode works just like P mode — but with-
out giving you the benefit of being able to select from different combina-
tions of aperture and shutter speed. So after you digest the depth-of-field 
discussion in Chapter 6, I suggest that you practice using Av mode 
instead, where you can select the aperture yourself.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. But even in M mode, the camera assists you by displaying a 
meter that tells you whether your exposure settings are on target.
Again, I realize that the descriptions of these modes won’t make much sense 
to you if you aren’t schooled in the basics of exposure. To that end, the next 
several sections provide a quick lesson in this critical photography subject. 
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by 
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a 
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, it’s 
the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are two barriers, the aperture and shutter, 
which together control how much light makes its way to the sensor. The 
actual design and arrangement of the aperture, shutter, and sensor vary 
depending on the camera, but Figure 5-2 offers an illustration of the basic 
concept.

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The aperture and shutter, along with a third feature, ISO, determine 
exposure — what most of us would describe as the picture’s overall bright-
ness and contrast. This three-part exposure formula works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount 
of light): The aperture is an 
adjustable hole in a diaphragm 
set just behind the lens. By 
changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of 
the light beam that can enter 
the camera. Aperture settings 
are stated as f-stop numbers, 
or simply f-stops, and are 
expressed with the letter f fol-
lowed by a number: f/2, f/5.6, 
f/16, and so on. The lower the 
f-stop number, the larger the 
aperture, as illustrated by 
Figure 5-3.
 
 The range of possible f-stops 
depends on your lens and, if 
you use a zoom lens, on the 
zoom position (focal length) of the lens. For the kit lens sold with the 
Rebel T1i/500D, you can select apertures from f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed 
all the way out to the shortest focal length (18mm). When you zoom in 
to the maximum focal length (55mm), the aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. 
(See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal lengths.)

135
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor. When you press the shutter button, 
the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture 
to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is the shutter speed and is 
measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so on. 
Shutter speeds on the Rebel T1i/500D range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 
second when you shoot without flash. Should you want a shutter speed 
longer than 30 seconds, manual exposure mode also provides a feature 
called bulb exposure. At this setting, the shutter stays open indefinitely 
as long as you press the shutter button.
 
 If you use the built-in flash, the fastest available shutter speed is 1/200 
second; the slowest ranges from 1/60 second to 30 seconds, depending 
on the exposure mode. See the section “Understanding your camera’s 
approach to flash,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each 
film stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 
800, and so on. Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light 
sensitivity, which means that less light is needed to produce the image, 
enabling you to use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
 
 On your camera, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to a whop-
ping 12800 when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. (You’re 
restricted to an ISO range of 200 to 3200, however, if you enable the 
Highlight Tone Priority function, which you can explore later in this 
chapter.) For the fully automatic modes, you’re limited to ISO speeds 
from 100 to 1600, and the camera chooses the setting for you automati-
cally. (Highlight Tone Priority isn’t available in those modes.)
 
Distilled to its essence, the image-exposure formula is this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that 
strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with different combinations of aperture, 
shutter speed, and ISO, which Figure 5-4 illustrates. Although the figure shows 
only two variations of settings, your choices are pretty much endless — you’re 
limited only by the aperture range the lens allows and the shutter speeds and 
ISO settings the camera offers. 
 
f/13, 1/25 second, ISO 200
f/5.6, 1/125 second, ISO 200
 
Figure 5-4: Aperture and shutter speed affect depth of field and motion blur.
But the settings you select affect your image beyond exposure, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects 
depth of field, or the distance over which sharp focus is maintained. 
I introduce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With 
a shallow depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused 
than faraway objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone 
spreads over a greater distance.
 
 When you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in 
photo lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth 
of field. For example, notice that the background in the left image in 
Figure 5-4, taken at f/13, appears sharper than the right image, taken at 
f/5.6. Aperture is just one contributor to depth of field, however; see 
Chapter 6 for the complete story.

137
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Shutter speed affects motion blur. 
At a slow shutter speed, moving 
objects appear blurry, whereas a 
fast shutter speed captures motion 
cleanly. Compare the fountain 
spray in the photos in Figure 5-4, 
for example. At a shutter speed 
of 1/25 second (left photo), the 
water blurs, giving it a misty look. 
At 1/125 second (right photo), 
the droplets appear more sharply 
focused. How high a shutter speed 
you need to freeze action depends 
on the speed of your subject.
 
 If your picture suffers from overall 
image blur like you see in Figure 
5-5, where even stationary objects 
appear out of focus, the camera 
moved during the exposure — 
which is always a danger when you 
handhold the camera at slow shut-
ter speeds. The longer the expo-
sure time, the longer you have to 
hold the camera still to avoid the 
blur caused by camera shake.
 
 How slow is too slow? It depends 
on your physical capabilities and 
your lens. For reasons that are too technical to get into, camera shake 
affects your picture more when you shoot with a lens that has a long 
focal length. For example, you may be able to use a much slower shut-
ter speed when you shoot with a lens that has a maximum focal length 
of 55mm, like the kit lens, than if you switch to a 200mm telephoto lens. 
My abilities vary depending on the day and my caffeine intake; I was able 
to snap the first example in Figure 5-4 at 1/25 second, but frankly, that 
was a lucky accident. At the 1/5 second shutter speed used in Figure 5-5, 
camera shake was almost inevitable.
 
 The best idea is to do your own tests to see where your handholding 
limit lies. Start with a slow shutter speed — say, in the 1/40 second 
neighborhood, and then click off multiple shots, increasing the shutter 
speed for each picture. If you have a zoom lens, run the test first at the 
minimum focal length (widest angle) and then zoom to the maximum 
focal length for another series of shots. Then it’s simply a matter of com-
paring the images in your photo-editing program. (You may not be able 
to accurately judge the amount of blur on the camera monitor.) Check 
out Chapter 8 to find out how to see each picture’s shutter speed when 
you view your images.

Figure 5-5: Slow shutter speeds increase 
the risk of all-over blur caused by camera 
shake.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 To avoid the issue altogether, the best answer is to use a tripod or oth-
erwise steady the camera. If you do need to handhold — and let’s face it, 
no one can carry a tripod all the time — improve your odds of a sharp 
photo by turning on image stabilization, if your lens offers it. (On the kit 
lens, turn the Stabilizer switch on the side of the lens to On to enable 
this feature.) See Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and 
Chapter 7 for more help with action photography.
 
✓ ISO affects image noise. When you select a higher ISO setting, making 
the image sensor more reactive to light, you risk a defect called noise. 
Noise looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to film 
grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO film.
 
 Ideally, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your camera — 
ISO 100 — to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting con-
ditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture and 
shutter speeds you need.
 
 For example, consider the floral close-ups in Figure 5-6. For this shot, 
I wanted the background to be blurry but I also wanted the petals to 
be about as sharp as the stamen and the pistil (the spindly things that 
protrude from the center of the flower). An f-stop of f/13 produced the 
depth of field I wanted. But because it was early morning and the light 
was still pretty dim, I needed a shutter speed of 1/25 second to expose 
the picture at that f-stop when ISO was set to 100. I usually can’t hand-
hold the camera successfully at that slow of a shutter speed, and that 
was certainly the case on this day. Additionally, a very light breeze 
was blowing, causing just the slightest flutter of the flower. Those two 
challenges combined to produce the blurry photo on the left. To fix 
the problem, I raised the ISO to 400, which enabled me to use a shutter 
speed of 1/80 second, which was within my handholding comfort zone 
and also enough to compensate for the breeze.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the distance over 
which focus remains sharp, is simply to think of 
the f as focus: The higher the f-stop number, the 
larger the zone of sharp focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s helpful to 
know if you aren’t an optical engineer. (Chapter 6 
explains focal length, which is helpful to know.)

139
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
ISO 100, f/13, 1/25 second
ISO 400, f/13, 1/80 second
 
Figure 5-6: Raising the ISO enabled me to raise the shutter speed enough to ensure a blur-free 
 
shot while handholding the camera.
 
 Fortunately, you usually don’t encounter serious noise with the Rebel 
T1i/500D until you really crank up the ISO. It’s difficult to detect any 
noise in the ISO 400 image in Figure 5-6, for example. In fact, you may get 
away with the next step up, ISO 800, if you keep the print or display size 
of the picture small. As with other image defects, noise becomes more 
apparent when you enlarge the photo. Noise also is more problematic in 
areas of flat color.
 
 Just to give you a better look at how ISO affects noise, Figure 5-7 offers 
magnified views of an area of my lily photo captured at each of the cam-
era’s ISO settings. (The two highest settings are disabled by default, and 
this example makes it clear why — the noise level clearly makes these 
ultra-high ISO settings “emergency only” options.)
 
 One more important note about noise: A long exposure time — say, 1 
second or more — also can produce this defect. Your camera offers 
built-in noise-reduction filters that aim to compensate for both high 
ISO noise and long-exposure noise; see the sidebar “Dampening noise”

sarily the best solution to the problem. For my example shot, both 
noise-reduction filters were turned off.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect 
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look 
of your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of 
your images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)
Doing the exposure balancing act
 
When you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter 
speed, and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift to maintain the 
same image brightness. 
Say you’re shooting a soccer game, for example, and you notice that although 
the overall exposure looks great, the players appear slightly blurry at the 
current shutter speed. If you raise the shutter speed, you have to compen-
sate with either a larger aperture, to allow in more light during the shorter 
exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the camera more sensitive to the 
light. Which way should you go? Well, it depends on whether you prefer the 
shorter depth of field that comes with a larger aperture or the increased risk 
of noise that accompanies a higher ISO. Of course, you can also adjust both 
settings if you choose to get the exposure results you need.
All photographers have their own approaches to finding the right combina-
tion of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your 
own system when you become more practiced at using the advanced expo-
sure modes. In the meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want 
without raising the ISO.
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
excited dog), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my expo-
sure decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free 
photo or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that 
moving object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. 
When shooting waterfalls, for example, I sometimes use a slow shutter 
to give the water that blurry, romantic look.
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shut-
ter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in 
mind. For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low f-stop 
number) so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft back-
ground for my subject.
Keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the more you 
work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation will make 
sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for specific 
types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for details 
on how to monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Monitoring Exposure Settings
When you press the shutter button halfway, the current f-stop, shutter speed, 
and ISO speed appear in the viewfinder display, as shown in Figure 5-8. Or, if 
you’re looking at the Shooting Settings display, the settings appear as shown 
in Figure 5-9. In Live View mode, the exposure data appears at the bottom 
of the monitor and takes a form similar to what you see in the viewfinder. 
(The upcoming sidebar provides information about other exposure-related 
aspects of shooting in Live View mode, which I introduce in Chapter 4.)
 
In the viewfinder and on the monitor in Live View mode, shutter speeds are 
presented as whole numbers, even if the shutter speed is set to a fraction of a 
second. For example, for a shutter speed of 1/1000 second, you see just the 
number 1000 in the display, as shown in Figure 5-8. When the shutter speed 
slows to 1 second or more, you see quote marks after the number in both 
displays — 1" indicates a shutter speed of 1 second, 4" means 4 seconds, 
and so on.
 
Shutter speed
Meter
f-stop
ISO
 
Figure 5-8: The shutter speed, f-stop, and ISO speed appear in the viewfinder.
The viewfinder, Shooting Settings display, and Live View display also offer an 
exposure meter, labeled in Figures 5-8 and 5-9. This little graphic serves two 
different purposes, depending on which of the advanced exposure modes 
you’re using:

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ In manual exposure (M) 
mode, the meter acts in 
its traditional role, which 
is to indicate whether 
your settings will prop-
erly expose the image. 
Figure 5-10 gives you three 
examples. When the expo-
sure indicator aligns with 
the center point, as in the 
middle example, the cur-
rent settings will produce 
a proper exposure. If the 
indicator moves to the 
left of center, toward the 
minus side of the scale, 
as in the left example in 
the figure, the camera 
is alerting you that the 
image will be under-
exposed. If the indicator 
moves to the right of center, as in the right example, the image will be 
overexposed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus or minus 
sign, the greater the potential exposure problem.
 
✓ In the other modes (P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP), the meter displays the cur-
rent Exposure Compensation setting. Exposure Compensation is a fea-
ture that enables you to tell the camera to produce a brighter or darker 
exposure than its autoexposure brain thinks is correct. When the expo-
sure indicator is at 0, as in Figures 5-8 and 5-9, no compensation is being 
applied. See the upcoming section “Overriding autoexposure results 
with Exposure Compensation” for details.
   
Underexposed

 Figure 5-10: In manual exposure (M) mode, the meter indicates whether exposure settings are on target.
 
Because the meter is designated as an exposure compensation guide when 
you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the camera alerts you to expo-
sure problems in those modes as follows:
Shutter speed
Meter
f-stop
ISO speed
Figure 5-9: You also can view the settings in the 
Shooting Settings display.

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Av mode (aperture-priority autoexposure): The shutter speed value 
blinks to let you know that the camera can’t select a shutter speed that 
will produce a good exposure at the aperture you selected. You need to 
choose a different f-stop or adjust ISO.
 
✓ Tv mode (shutter-priority autoexposure): The aperture value blinks 
instead of the shutter speed. That’s your notification that the camera 
can’t open or stop down the aperture enough to expose the image at 
your selected shutter speed. Your options are to change the shutter 
speed or ISO.
 
✓ P mode (programmed autoexposure): In P mode, both the aperture and 
shutter speed values blink if the camera can’t select a combination that 
will properly expose the image. Your only recourse is to either adjust 
the lighting or change the ISO setting.
 
✓ A-DEP mode (auto depth of field): Either the aperture or the shutter 
speed value may blink. If the shutter speed value blinks 30" (for 30 sec-
onds) or 4000 (for 1/4000 second), the light is too dark or too bright, 
respectively, for the camera to expose the image properly at any com-
bination of aperture and shutter speed. To compensate for dim lighting, 
you can raise the ISO or add flash. In too-bright light, lower the ISO if 
possible — otherwise, find a way to shade or relocate the subject.
 
 If the aperture setting blinks, the exposure will be okay, but the f-stop 
won’t produce the depth of field needed to keep everything in the frame 
in sharp focus. (See Chapter 6 for complete details on depth of field and 
the A-DEP mode.)
 
Keep in mind that the camera’s take on exposure may not always be the one 
you want to follow. First, the camera bases its exposure decisions on the cur-
rent exposure metering mode. As covered next, you can choose four different 
metering modes, and each one calculates exposure on a different area of the 
frame. Second, you may want to purposely choose exposure settings that 
leave parts of the image very dark or parts very light for creative reasons. In 
other words, the meter and the blinking alerts are guides, not dictators.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
The metering mode determines which part of the frame the camera analyzes 
to calculate the proper exposure. Your Rebel T1i/500D offers four metering 
modes, described in the following list and represented in the Shooting 
Settings display by the icons you see in the margins. However, you can 
access all four modes only in the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP), and only during regular, through-the-viewfinder shooting. In Live 
View mode, as well as in the fully automatic exposure modes, you’re 
restricted to the first of the four modes, Evaluative metering.

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
✓ Evaluative metering: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then 
selects an exposure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure. 
 
 
✓ Partial metering: The camera bases exposure only on the light that falls 
in the center 9 percent of the frame. The left image in Figure 5-11 pro-
vides a rough approximation of the area that factors into the exposure 
equation.
 
 
✓ Spot metering: This mode works like Partial metering but uses a smaller 
region of the frame to calculate exposure. For Spot metering, exposure is 
based on just the center 4 percent of the frame, as indicated by the illus-
tration on the right in Figure 5-11.
 
 
✓ Center-Weighted Average metering: The camera bases exposure on the 
entire frame but puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center.
Exposure and Live View shooting
Your camera’s Live View mode, detailed at the 
end of Chapter 4, enables you to use your moni-
tor instead of the viewfinder to compose your 
images. If you do switch to Live View mode, 
keep these exposure-related tips in mind:
 ✓ Your camera strap sports a little rubber view-
finder cover that you should place over the 
viewfinder when you’re shooting in Live View 
mode. Otherwise, light can seep in through 
the viewfinder and affect exposure.
 ✓ Several exposure functions described in 
this chapter are disabled in Live View mode. 
You can’t use flash exposure lock; you’re 
limited to Evaluative metering mode; and 
you can apply AE Lock (autoexposure lock) 
only by assigning that function to the shut-
ter button, via Custom Function 10 (Chapter 
11 has details). In addition, the A-DEP 
exposure mode works the same as P mode 
during Live View shooting.
 ✓ A non-Canon external flash won’t fire in Live 
View mode.
 ✓ Image noise may increase if you engage Live 
View shooting for a long period because 
Live View heats up the camera more than 
usual; you can help matters by composing 
the shot, powering off the camera for a few 
minutes, and then turning the camera back 
on to take the picture.
 ✓ You can display certain exposure settings 
as well as a histogram along with your 
image in the monitor. Chapter 4 tells you 
how and explains histograms.
 ✓ If the Exposure Simulation symbol on the 
monitor is white, the image brightness will 
be approximately the same as what you 
see on the monitor. But if the symbol blinks 
or is dimmed, don’t rely on the monitor for 
an exposure preview. In extreme lighting 
conditions, the camera may not be able to 
simulate exposure properly. And if you use 
flash, Exposure Simulation is automatically 
disabled.

Partial metering area
Spot metering area
 
Figure 5-11: The spotlights indicate the metered area for Partial metering and Spot metering.
In most cases, Evaluative metering does a good job of calculating exposure. 
But it can get thrown off when a dark subject is set against a bright back-
ground or vice versa. For example, in the left image in Figure 5-12, the amount 
of bright background caused the camera to select an exposure that left the 
statue too dark. So I switched to Partial metering, which properly exposed 
the statue. (Spot metering would produce a similar result with this particular 
subject.)
 
Evaluative
Partial
 
Figure 5-12: In Evaluative mode, the camera underexposed the statue; 
 
switching to Partial metering produced a better result.

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
Of course, if your background is very bright and the subject is very dark, the 
exposure that does the best job on the subject typically overexposes the back-
ground. You may be able to reclaim some of the lost highlights by turning on 
Highlight Tone Priority, a Custom Function explored later in this chapter.
Use either of these two options to change the metering mode:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: First, display the Shooting Settings screen by 
pressing the shutter button halfway and then releasing it. Then press 
Set to shift into Quick Control mode and use the cross keys to highlight 
the Metering mode icon, as shown on the left in Figure 5-13. The selected 
setting appears in the label at the bottom of the screen. Rotate the Main 
dial to cycle through the four modes or press Set to display a list of all 
four modes, as shown on the right in the figure. If you go the second 
route, use the cross keys or Main dial to highlight the icon for the mode 
you want to use and then press Set to lock in your decision. 
 
✓ Shooting Menu 2: Display Shooting Menu 2, highlight Metering mode, as 
shown on the left in Figure 5-14, and press Set. You then see the screen 
shown on the right. Highlight your choice and press Set again to return 
to the menu.
 
In theory, the best practice is to check the metering mode before each shot 
and choose the mode that best matches your exposure goals. But in practice, 
that’s a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one more capture set-
ting but also in terms of having to remember to adjust one more capture 
setting.

Figure 5-14: You also can access the Metering mode on Shooting Menu 2.
So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other con-
trols on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is Evaluative 
metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after 
all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera 
metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the expo-
sure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole meter-
ing mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one scenario that might warrant an exception to this advice is if you 
want to capture a series of images of a subject that’s significantly darker or 
brighter than its background, as in my examples. Then, switching to Partial, 
Spot, or Center-Weighted Average metering may save you the time of having 
to adjust the exposure for each image.
Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed
 
If you want to control ISO, aperture (f-stop), or shutter speed, set the camera 
to one of the five advanced exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP. Then 
check out the next several sections to find the exact steps to follow in each of 
these modes.
Controlling ISO
To recap the ISO information presented at the start of this chapter: Your 
camera’s ISO setting controls how sensitive the image sensor is to light. At 
higher ISO values, you need less light to expose an image.
 
Remember the downside to raising ISO, however: The higher the ISO, the 
greater the possibility of noisy images. See Figure 5-7 for a reminder of what 
that defect looks like.

149
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera selects an ISO from 100 to 
1600, depending on the available light and whether you use flash. You have 
no control over ISO in those exposure modes.
In the advanced exposure modes, you have the following ISO choices:
 
✓ Let the camera choose (Auto ISO). You can still rely on the camera to 
adjust ISO for you in the advanced exposure modes if you prefer. As it 
does when you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera 
chooses an ISO setting from 100 to 1600, depending on the available light 
and whether you use flash. However, if you set the Mode dial to M, for 
manual exposure mode, ISO is always set to 400. (That’s a good thing 
because when you want firm control over exposure, you don’t want the 
camera adjusting light sensitivity behind your back.)
 
✓ Select a specific ISO setting. Normally, you can choose ISO 100, 200, 
400, 800, 1600, or 3200. A Custom Function called ISO Expansion enables 
you to push the ISO to 6400 or yet one step higher, to a setting simply 
labeled H (for super-duper High, I suppose), which Canon says is equiva-
lent to ISO 12800. Figure 5-7 shows that the H and ISO 6400 settings are 
also equivalent to a pretty noisy photo, which is likely the reason why 
these two settings aren’t available by default.
 
 To expand the ISO range, go to Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom 
Functions, and press Set. Use the cross keys to bring up Custom 
Function 2, as shown on the left in Figure 5-15. (The function number 
appears in the top-right corner of the screen.) Press Set to activate the 
options, as shown on the right. Highlight On and press Set again.
 
 
Figure 5-15: Custom Function 2 enables you to push the available ISO range to 12800.
 
 A little aside about Custom Functions may be of help here. They’re 
grouped into four categories that are assigned Roman numerals, as in 
Custom Function I, II, and so on. The category number appears in the 
top-left corner of the screen. Group I, of which ISO Expansion is a 

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
member, contains Custom Functions related to exposure. Knowing the 
group number isn’t important; just don’t confuse that number with the 
actual number of the individual Custom Function, which lives in the 
upper-right corner.
 
 One more complication to note: Another of the exposure-related Custom 
Functions, Highlight Tone Priority, affects the range of available ISO set-
tings. If you enable that feature, you lose the option of using ISO 100 as 
well as the two expanded ISO settings (6400 and H, or 12800). Highlight 
Tone Priority is covered later in this chapter.
You can view the ISO setting in the upper-right corner of the Shooting 
Settings screen, as shown on the left in Figure 5-16. You can also monitor the 
ISO in the viewfinder display and in the Live View display.
 
ISO speed
 
Figure 5-16: Press the ISO button on top of the camera to access the ISO setting.
To adjust the setting, you have the following two options:
 
 
✓ Press the ISO button. It’s located just behind the Main dial, on top of the 
camera. After you press the button, you see the screen shown on the 
right in Figure 5-16. Use the cross keys or rotate the Main dial to high-
light your choice and then press Set.
 
✓ Use the Quick Control screen. After displaying the Shooting Settings 
screen, press Set to shift to Quick Control mode and then highlight the 
ISO setting. Then either rotate the Main dial to cycle through the avail-
able ISO settings or press Set to display the same screen you see on the 
right in Figure 5-16. If you take the second approach, highlight your ISO 
setting and press Set again. 

151
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures 
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-7), can occur 
for two reasons: a long exposure time and a 
high ISO setting.
The Rebel T1i/500D offers two noise-removal fil-
ters, one to address each cause of noise. Both 
filters are provided through Custom Functions, 
which means that you can control whether 
and how they are applied only in the advanced 
exposure modes.
To control long-exposure noise reduction, visit 
Setup Menu 3, select Custom Functions, press 
Set, and then use the right or left cross key to 
select Custom Function 4, as shown in the left 
figure. Press Set to access the options, high-
light your choice, and then press Set again. The 
three settings work as follows: 
 ✓ Off: No noise reduction is applied. This is 
the default setting.
 ✓ Auto: Noise reduction is applied when you 
use a shutter speed of 1 second or longer, 
but only if the camera detects the type of 
noise that’s caused by long exposures.
 ✓ On: Noise reduction is always applied at 
exposures of 1 second or longer. (Note: 
Canon suggests that this setting may actually 
result in more noise than either Off or Auto 
when the ISO setting is 1600 or higher.)
For high ISO noise removal, move to Custom 
Function 5. This filter offers four settings, as 
shown in the right figure:
 ✓ Standard: The default setting
 ✓ Low: Applies a little noise removal
 ✓ Strong: Goes after noise in a more dramatic 
way
 ✓ Disable: Turns the filter off
Although noise reduction is a great thing in 
theory, both filters have a few disadvantages. 
First, they’re applied after you take the picture, 
when the camera processes the image data and 
records it to your memory card, which slows 
your shooting speed. In fact, using the Strong 
setting for High ISO noise removal reduces the 
maximum frame rate (shots per second) that 
you can click off.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primar-
ily by applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t 
expect this process to eliminate noise entirely, 
and do expect some resulting image softness. 
You may be able to get better results by using 
the blur tools or noise-removal filters found in 
many photo editors because then you can blur 
just the parts of the image where noise is most 
noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or 
little detail, such as skies.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
In Auto ISO mode, the Shooting Settings display and Live View display ini-
tially show Auto as the ISO value, as you would expect. But when you press 
the shutter button halfway, which initiates exposure metering, the value 
changes to show you the ISO setting the camera has selected. You also see 
the selected value rather than Auto in the viewfinder. Note: When you view 
shooting data during playback, you may see a value reported that’s not on 
the list of “official” ISO settings — ISO 320, for example. This happens 
because in Auto mode, the camera can select values all along the available 
ISO range, whereas if you select a specific ISO setting, you’re restricted to 
specific notches within the range.
Although the camera choosing ISO with a little more precision in Auto mode 
is a good thing, I still can’t recommend Auto ISO. Unless you’re shooting in 
manual exposure (M) mode, in which case Auto ISO means ISO 400, you’re 
allowing the camera to ramp ISO as high as 1600, which can produce sig-
nificant noise in certain conditions. I want to decide when and if I make that 
noise tradeoff, so I stick with manual ISO control.
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
 
You can adjust aperture and shutter speed only in P, Tv, Av, and M exposure 
modes. In A-DEP mode, the camera forces you to use its selected exposure 
settings. (However, you can tweak the exposure by using the Exposure 
Compensation feature discussed in the next section.)
To see the current exposure settings, start by pressing the shutter button 
halfway. The following things then take place:
 
✓ The exposure meter comes to life. If autofocus is enabled, focus is also 
set at this point.
 
✓ The aperture and shutter speed appear in the viewfinder or the Shooting 
Settings display, if you have it enabled. In Live View mode, the settings 
appear under the image preview on the monitor.
 
✓ In manual exposure (M) mode, the exposure meter also lets you know 
whether the current settings will expose the image properly. In the 
other advanced exposure modes — Tv, Av, P, and A-DEP — the camera 
doesn’t indicate an exposure problem by using the meter, but by 
flashing either the shutter speed or the f-stop value. (See the section 
“Monitoring Exposure Settings,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
The technique you use to change the exposure settings depends on the 
exposure mode, as outlined in the following list: 
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera initially displays its 
recommended combination of aperture and shutter speed. To select a 
different combination, rotate the Main dial.

153
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
• To select a lower f-stop number (larger aperture) and faster shut-
ter speed, rotate the dial to the right.
 
• To select a higher f-stop number (smaller aperture) and slower 
shutter speed, rotate the dial to the left.
 
✓ Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right for 
a faster shutter speed; nudge it to the left for a slower speed. When you 
change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the aperture 
as needed to maintain the proper exposure.
 
 Changing the aperture also changes depth of field. So even though 
you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop, too, if 
depth of field is important to your photo. Note: In extreme lighting con-
ditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture enough to 
produce a good exposure at the current shutter speed — again, possible 
aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need to compromise 
on shutter speed (or, in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
 
✓ Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right 
to stop down the aperture to a higher f-stop number. Rotate the dial to 
the left to open the aperture to a lower f-stop number. When you do, 
the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to maintain the 
exposure.
 
 If you’re handholding the camera, be careful that the shutter speed 
doesn’t drop so low when you stop down the aperture that you run the 
risk of camera shake. And if your scene contains moving objects, make 
sure that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that 
the camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur 
it, if that’s your creative goal).
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Main dial to the right for a faster 
shutter speed; rotate left for a slower shutter. 
 
• To adjust aperture: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation 
button, shown in Figure 5-17, while you rotate the Main dial.
 
 See the Av label next to the button? That’s your clue to the 
aperture-related function of the button — Av stands for aperture 
value.
 
 Rotate the dial to the right for a higher f-stop (smaller aperture); 
rotate left to select a lower f-stop. Don’t let up on the button when 
you rotate the Main dial — if you do, you instead adjust the shutter 
speed.

Aperture setting
Exposure Compensation button
 
Figure 5-17: To set aperture in M mode, press the Exposure 
 
Compensation button while you rotate the Main dial.
In M, Tv, and Av modes, the setting currently available for adjustment 
appears in the Shooting Settings display in purple, with little arrows at each 
side. Your camera manual refers to this display as the Main dial pointer, and 
it’s provided as a reminder that you use the Main dial to change the setting. 
For example, in M mode, the shutter speed appears purple until you hold 
down the Exposure Compensation button, at which point the marker shifts to 
the aperture (f-stop) value, as shown in Figure 5-17.
 
You also can use the Quick Control 
method of adjusting the settings in 
the M, Tv, and Av modes. This trick 
is especially helpful for M mode 
because you can adjust the f-stop 
setting without having to remember 
what button to push to do the job. 
Try it out. After displaying the 
Shooting Settings screen, press Set 
to shift to Quick Control mode and 
then use the cross keys to highlight 
the setting you want to change. For 
example, in Figure 5-18, the aperture 
setting is highlighted, and a text label 
offers a helpful reminder with the 
name of the option at the bottom of 
the screen. Now, rotate the Main dial 
to adjust the setting, press the shutter button halfway, and release it to exit 
Quick Control mode.
Keep in mind that when you use P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the settings 
that the camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. 
If you don’t agree with the camera, you have two options. You can switch 
Figure 5-18: You can also use the Quick 
Control screen to adjust aperture and shutter 
speed in the M, Tv, and Av exposure modes. 

155
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
to manual exposure (M) mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter 
speed that deliver the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, Tv, Av, 
or A-DEP mode, you can tweak the autoexposure settings by using Exposure 
Compensation, one of the exposure-correction tools described in the next 
section.
Sorting through Your Camera’s 
Exposure-Correction Tools
In addition to the normal controls over aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, 
your Rebel offers a collection of tools that enable you to solve tricky expo-
sure problems. The next four sections give you the lowdown on these 
features.
Overriding autoexposure results 
with Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP exposure modes, you 
can enjoy the benefits of autoexposure support but retain some control over 
the final exposure. If you think that the image the camera produced is too dark 
or too light, you can use a feature known as Exposure Compensation, which is 
sometimes also called EV Compensation. (The EV stands for exposure value.)
Whatever you call it, this feature enables you to tell the camera to produce 
a darker or lighter exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks 
is appropriate. Best of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the 
camera to understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure compensation is stated in EV values, as in +2.0 EV. Possible 
values range from +2.0 EV to –2.0 EV.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment. 
 
✓ For a brighter image, you raise the EV value. The higher you go, the 
brighter the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, you lower the EV value. The picture becomes pro-
gressively darker with each step down the EV scale.
 
Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one full stop. 
In plain English, that means that if you change the Exposure Compensation 
setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the camera adjusts either the aperture or the 
shutter speed to allow half as much light into the camera as you would get at 
the current setting. If you instead raise the value to EV +1.0, the settings are 
adjusted to double the light.

156
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
By default, the exposure is adjusted in 1/3-stop increments. In other words, 
you can shift from EV 0.0 to EV +0.3, +0.7, +1.0, and so on. But you can change 
the adjustment to 1/2-stop increments if you want to shift the exposure in 
larger jumps — from EV 0.0 to EV +0.5, +1.0, and so on. To do so, display 
Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set. Then select Custom 
Function 1, press Set, and press the up or down cross key to change the set-
ting. Press Set again to lock in the new setting. If you make this change, the 
meter will appear slightly different in the Shooting Settings display and Live 
View display than you see it in this book. (There will be only one intermedi-
ate notch between each number on the meter instead of the usual two.) The 
viewfinder meter does not change, but the exposure indicator bar appears as 
a double line if you set the Exposure Compensation value to a half-step value 
(+0.5, +1.5, and so on). 
 
Exposure compensation is especially helpful when your subject and back-
ground are significantly different in brightness. For example, take a look at 
the first image in Figure 5-19. Because of the very bright sky in the back-
ground, the camera chose an exposure that left the palm tree too dark.
 
EV 0.0
EV +1.0
 
Figure 5-19: For a brighter exposure than the autoexposure mechanism chooses, 
 
dial in a positive Exposure Compensation value.
One way to cope with this situation is to adjust the Metering mode setting, as 
discussed earlier in this chapter. I took the images in Figure 5-19 in Evaluative 
mode, for example, which meters exposure on the entire frame. Switching to 

157
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Partial metering might have done the trick, but frankly, I find it easier to use 
exposure compensation than to fool with metering mode adjustments in most 
situations. So I left the Metering mode alone and just amped the Exposure 
Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced the brighter exposure on 
the right.
You can take three roads to applying exposure compensation:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: When the Shooting Settings screen is displayed, 
press Set to shift to Quick Control mode. Then use the cross keys to 
highlight the exposure meter, as shown in Figure 5-20, and rotate the 
Main dial to move the exposure indicator left or right along the meter. 
 
• Rotate the dial to the left to lower the Exposure Compensation 
value and produce a darker exposure.
 
• Rotate the dial to the right to raise the value and produce a 
brighter exposure.
 
• To return to no adjustment, rotate the dial until the exposure indi-
cator is back at the center position on the meter.
 
 Press the shutter button halfway to exit the Quick Control screen.
 
 Alternately, you can press the Set button while in Quick Control mode to 
display the screen you see on the right in Figure 5-20. But be careful: 
Through this screen, you can enable both automatic exposure bracketing 
(AEB) and exposure compensation. To apply exposure compensation, you 
must use the left and right cross keys to move the exposure indicator. If 
you rotate the Main dial, you adjust the AEB setting instead. Press Set to 
exit the screen after you make your exposure compensation adjustment.

158
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
✓ Exposure Compensation button: You also can press and hold down the 
button (shown in the margin) while rotating the Main dial to adjust the 
Exposure Compensation setting. 
 
 
✓ Shooting Menu 2: Visit this menu and select the Expo. Comp/AEB 
option. Press Set to display the same controls you see on the right in 
Figure 5-20. Use the right and left cross keys to adjust the setting and 
press Set to exit.
 
How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request depends 
on the exposure mode:
 
✓ In Av (aperture-priority) mode, the camera adjusts the shutter speed but 
leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure to check the resulting shut-
ter speed to make sure that it isn’t so slow that camera shake or blur 
from moving objects is problematic. 
 
✓ In Tv (shutter-priority) mode, the opposite occurs: The camera opens or 
stops down the aperture, leaving your selected shutter speed alone.
 
✓ In P (programmed autoexposure) and A-DEP modes, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both to accommodate the 
Exposure Compensation setting.
These explanations assume that you have a specific ISO setting selected 
rather than Auto ISO. If you do use Auto ISO, the camera may adjust that 
value instead.
Keep in mind, too, that the camera can adjust the aperture only so much, 
according to the aperture range of your lens. The range of shutter speeds is 
limited by the camera. So if you reach the end of those ranges, you have to 
compromise on either shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO.
 
One final, and critical point about exposure compensation: When you power 
off the camera, it doesn’t return you to a neutral setting (EV 0.0). The setting 
you last used remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP exposure modes 
until you change it.
Improving high-contrast shots 
with Highlight Tone Priority
When a scene contains both very dark and very bright areas, achieving a 
good exposure can be difficult. If you choose exposure settings that render 
the shadows properly, the highlights are often overexposed, as in the left 
image in Figure 5-21. Although the dark lamppost in the foreground looks 
fine, the white building behind it has become so bright that all detail has 
been lost. The same thing occurred in the highlight areas of the green church 
steeple.

159
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
Highlight Tone Priority off
Highlight Tone Priority on
 
Figure 5-21: The Highlight Tone Priority feature can help prevent overexposed highlights.
Your camera offers an option that can help produce a better image in this 
situation — Highlight Tone Priority — which I used to produce the second 
image in Figure 5-21. The difference is subtle, but if you look at that white 
building and steeple, you can see that the effect does make a difference. Now 
the windows in the building are at least visible, the steeple has regained 
some of its color, and the sky, too, has a bit more blue.
 
This feature is turned off by default, which may seem like an odd choice after 
looking at the improvement it made to the scene in Figure 5-21. So what 
gives? The answer is that to do its thing, Highlight Tone Priority needs to 
limit your choice of ISO settings. Instead of the ISO 100–12800 range that’s 
possible without Highlight Tone Priority, you’re restricted to ISO 200–3200. 
This occurs because part of the way the camera favors highlights is to actu-
ally process the image at an ISO value one step below your selected setting 
by applying exposure compensation and other adjustments.
Losing the high end of the range is no big deal — the noise levels at those 
high settings make them pretty unattractive anyway. But in bright light, you 
may miss the option of lowering the ISO to 100 because you may be forced to 

160
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
use a smaller aperture or a faster shutter speed than you like. Additionally, 
you can wind up with slightly more noise in the shadows of your photo when 
you use Highlight Tone Priority.
If you want to enable the feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes.
 
 You can take advantage of the Highlight Tone Priority feature only in the 
P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3.
 
3. Highlight Custom Functions, as shown on the left in Figure 5-22, and 
press Set.
 
 You’re taken to command central for accessing custom functions.
 
4. Press the right or left cross key as needed to display Custom Function 6.
 
 Look for the Custom Function number in the upper-right corner of the 
screen. 
 
 
Figure 5-22: Enable Highlight Tone Priority through Custom Function 6 on Setup Menu 3.
 
5. Press Set and then press the up or down cross key to highlight the 
Enable option, as shown in Figure 5-22.
 
6. Press Set.
 
 Highlight Tone Priority is now enabled and remains on until you visit the 
Custom Functions playground again to turn it off.
As a reminder that Highlight Tone Priority is enabled, a D+ symbol appears 
near the ISO value in the Shooting Settings display, as shown in Figure 5-23. 
This same symbol appears with the ISO setting in the viewfinder and in the 
shooting data that appears onscreen in Live View mode and Playback mode. 
(See Chapter 4 to find out more about picture playback and Live View.)

Experimenting with Auto Lighting Optimization
When you select a Quality setting that results in a JPEG image file — that 
is, any setting but Raw — the camera tries to enhance your photo while it’s 
processing the picture. As part of this post-capture work, the camera checks 
each picture for two potential exposure problems: a too-dark subject and a 
lack of contrast. If the camera detects either, it applies a subtle corrective 
tweak that Canon calls Auto Lighting Optimization. 
In the fully automatic exposure modes as well as Creative Auto, you have no 
control over how much adjustment is made. And in manual exposure (M) mode, 
the feature is not available. But in the other four exposure modes — P, Tv, Av, 
and A-DEP — you can decide whether to enable Auto Lighting Optimization. 
You also can request a stronger or lighter application of the effect than the 
default setting. Figure 5-24 offers an example of the type of impact that each 
Auto Lighting Optimization setting can make on a low-contrast photo. 
Given the level of improvement that the Auto Lighting Optimizer correction 
made to the photo in Figure 5-24, you may be thinking that you’d be crazy to 
ever disable the feature. But it’s important to note a few points:
 
✓ The level of shift that occurs between each Auto Lighting Optimization set-
ting varies dramatically depending on the subject. This particular example 
shows a fairly noticeable difference between the Strong and Off settings. 
But you won’t always get this much impact from the filter. Even in this 
example, it’s difficult to detect much difference between Off and Low.
 
✓ Although the filter improved this particular scene, there are times when 
you may not find it beneficial. For example, maybe you’re purposely 
trying to shoot a backlit subject in silhouette or produce a low-contrast 
image. Either way, you don’t want the camera to insert its opinions on 
the exposure or contrast you’re trying to achieve.

162
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Because the filter is applied after you capture the photo, while the 
camera is writing the data to the memory card, it can slow your shooting 
rate, just like the Highlight Tone Priority feature.
 
✓ In some lighting conditions, the Auto Lighting Optimizer can produce an 
increase in image noise.
 
Off
Standard
Low
Strong
 
Figure 5-24: For this image, Auto Lighting Optimization provided a 
 
beneficial boost in contrast.

163
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ The corrective action taken by Auto Lighting Optimization can make some 
other exposure-adjustment features less effective. So turn it off if you 
don’t get the results you expect when you’re using the following features:
 
• Exposure compensation, discussed earlier in this chapter
 
• Flash compensation, discussed later in this chapter
 
• Automatic exposure bracketing, also discussed later in this chapter
By default, the camera applies Auto 
Lighting Optimization at the Standard 
level. If you want to experiment with 
other settings, visit Setup Menu 3, 
select Custom Functions, and press 
Set. Then press the right or left cross 
keys to hunt down Custom Function 
7, and press Set. You have four 
choices, as shown in Figure 5-25: 
Standard, which is the default level of 
correction, Strong, Low, and Disable. 
Highlight your preference and press 
Set again to lock the setting. The 
adjustment remains in force until you 
revisit the Custom Functions menu to 
change the setting. Again, you have this 
control only in P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes; in the fully automatic exposure 
modes, the filter is always applied at the Standard level.
 
If you’re not sure what level of Auto Lighting Optimization might work best or 
you’re concerned about the other drawbacks of enabling the filter, consider 
shooting the picture in the Raw file format. For Raw pictures, the camera 
applies no post-capture tweaking, regardless of whether this or any other 
filter is enabled. Then, by using Canon Digital Photo Professional, the soft-
ware provided free with the camera, you could apply the Auto Lighting 
Optimization effect when you convert your Raw images to a standard file 
format. (See Chapter 8 for details about processing Raw files.)
Correcting lens vignetting with Peripheral 
Illumination Correction
Because of some optical science principles that are too boring and too 
deadly to explore, some lenses produce pictures that appear darker around 
the edges of the frame than in the center, even when the lighting is con-
sistent throughout. This phenomenon goes by several names, but the 
two heard most often are vignetting and light fall-off. How much vignetting 
occurs depends on the lens, your aperture setting, and the lens focal length. 
(Chapter 6 explains focal length.)
Figure 5-25: Set the level of Auto Lighting 
Optimization through Custom Function 7.

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The Rebel T1i/500D offers a feature called Peripheral Illumination 
Correction that’s designed to compensate for vignetting by adjusting the 
light around the edges of the frame. Figure 5-26 shows an example. In the 
left image, there’s just a slight amount of light fall-off at the corners, most 
noticeable at the top of the image. The right image shows the same scene 
with Peripheral Illumination Correction enabled. 
 
Peripheral Illumination Correction off
Peripheral Illumination Correction on
 
Figure 5-26: Peripheral Illumination Correction tries to correct the corner darkening that can 
 
occur with some lenses.
I should point out that my “before” example hardly exhibits serious 
vignetting — I’m betting that most people wouldn’t even notice if it weren’t 
shown next to the “after” example. And, in my experience, you’re not likely 
to notice significant vignetting with the 18-55mm kit lens bundled with the 
camera, either. But if your lens suffers from stronger vignetting, it’s worth 
trying the Peripheral Illumination Correction filter.

165
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Peripheral Illumination Correction is available in all your camera’s exposure 
modes, including all the fully automatic modes. But a few factoids need 
spelling out, however:
 
✓ The correction is available only for photos captured in the JPEG file 
format. For Raw photos, you can choose to apply the correction and 
vary its strength if you use Canon Digital Photo Professional to process 
your Raw images. Chapter 8 talks more about Raw processing. Space 
limitations prevent me from covering this software fully, but you can 
find details in the software manual (provided in electronic form on the 
CD that ships with the camera).
 
✓ For the camera to apply the proper correction, data about the specific 
lens has to be included in the camera’s firmware, which is the inter-
nal software that runs the digital part of the show. You can determine 
whether your lens is supported by opening Shooting Menu 1 and select-
ing the Peripheral Illumination Correction option, as shown on the 
right in Figure 5-27. Press Set to display the right screen in the figure. If 
the screen reports that correction data is available, as in the figure, the 
feature is enabled by default.
 
 If your lens is not supported, you may be able to add its information to 
the camera; Canon calls this step registering your lens. You do this by 
cabling the camera to your computer and then using some tools included 
with the free EOS Utility software, also provided with your camera. (You 
use this same software when you choose to download photos by cabling 
the camera to the computer instead of using a memory-card reader.) 
Again, I must refer you to the manual for help on this bit of business 
because of the limited number of words that can fit in these pages.
 
✓ If you’re using a third-party lens rather than a Canon lens, Canon 
recommends that you not enable Peripheral Illumination Correction 
even if the camera reports that correction data is available. (You can 
still apply the correction in Digital Photo Professional when you shoot in 
the Raw format.) To turn off the feature, select the Disable setting from 
the screen shown on the right in Figure 5-27.
 
✓ In some circumstances, you may see increased noise at the corners of 
the photo because of the correction. (The exposure adjustment can 
make noise more apparent.) Also, at high ISO settings, the camera 
applies the filter at a lesser strength — presumably to avoid adding even 
more noise to the picture. (See the first part of this chapter for an under-
standing of noise and its relationship to ISO.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
Figure 5-27: If the camera has information about your lens, you can enable the feature.
Locking Autoexposure Settings
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
until the moment you press the shutter button fully to shoot the picture. In 
autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps adjusting 
exposure settings as needed.
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right settings 
for the light that’s striking your subject when you capture the image. But on 
occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of exposure settings. 
Here’s one such scenario: Suppose that you’re shooting several images of a 
large landscape that you want to join into a panorama in your photo editor. 
Unless the lighting is even across the entire landscape, the camera’s auto-
exposure brain will select different exposure settings for each shot, depend-
ing on which part of the scene is currently in the frame. That can lead to 
weird breaks in the brightness and contrast of the image when you seam 
the image together. And if it’s the f-stop that’s adjusted, which is what could 
happen in P or Tv exposure modes, you may notice shifts in depth of field as 
well because the aperture setting affects that aspect of your pictures.
 
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual expo-
sure) mode and use the same f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings for each 
shot. In manual exposure mode, the camera never overrides your exposure 
decisions; they’re locked until you change them.
But if you prefer to stay in P, Tv, or Av mode, you can lock the current auto-
exposure settings. Here’s how to do it for still photography; Chapter 4 details 
how to use the feature during Live View shooting:

167
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
1. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 If you’re using autofocusing, focus is locked at this point.
 
 
2. Press the AE Lock button, shown in Figure 5-28.
 
 
 AE stands for autoexposure, in case you weren’t sure.
 
 
 Exposure is now locked and remains locked for four seconds, even if 
you release the AE Lock button and the shutter button. To remind you 
that AE Lock is in force, the camera displays a little asterisk in the view-
finder. If you need to relock exposure, just press the AE Lock button 
again.
Note: If your goal is to use the same exposure settings for multiple shots, you 
must keep the AE Lock button pressed during the entire series of pictures. 
Every time you let up on the button and press it again, you lock exposure 
anew based on the light currently in the frame.
 
One other critical point to remember about using AE Lock: The camera estab-
lishes and locks exposure differently depending on the metering mode, the 
focusing mode (automatic or manual), and on an autofocusing setting called 
AF Point Selection mode. (Chapter 6 explains this option thoroughly.) Here’s 
the scoop:
 
✓ Evaluative metering and 
automatic AF Point Selection: 
Exposure is locked on the focus-
ing point that achieved focus.
 
✓ Evaluative metering and

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
By combining autoexposure lock with Spot metering, you can ensure a good 
exposure for photographs in which you want your subject to be off-center, 
and that subject is significantly darker or lighter than the background. 
Imagine, for example, a dark statue set against a light blue sky. First, select 
Spot metering, so that the camera only considers the object located in the 
very center of the frame. Frame the scene initially so that your statue is 
located in the center of the viewfinder. Press and hold the shutter button 
halfway to establish focus and then lock exposure by pressing the AE Lock 
button. Now reframe the shot to your desired composition and take the pic-
ture. (See Chapter 6 for details on selecting an autofocus point.)
These bits of advice assume that you haven’t altered the function of the AE 
Lock button, which you can do via a Custom Function. You can swap the 
tasks of the shutter button and AE Lock button, for example, so that pressing 
the shutter button halfway locks exposure and pressing the AE Lock button 
locks focus. Chapter 11 offers details on the relevant Custom Function.
Bracketing Exposures Automatically
 
One of my favorite exposure features on the Rebel T1i/500D is automatic 
exposure bracketing, or AEB for short. This feature makes it easy to bracket 
exposures — which simply means to take the same shot using several exposure 
settings to up the odds that you come away with a perfectly exposed image.
When you enable AEB, your first shot is recorded at the current exposure set-
tings; the second, with settings that produce a darker image; and the third, 
with settings that produce a brighter image. You can specify how much change 
in exposure you want in the three images when you turn on the feature.
 
You can take advantage of AEB in any of the advanced exposure modes. 
However, the feature isn’t available when you use flash. If you want to 
bracket exposures when using flash, you have to do it, either by using expo-
sure compensation or, in manual exposure mode, by changing the aperture 
and shutter speed directly.
Speaking of exposure compensation, you can combine that feature with AEB 
if you want. The camera simply applies the compensation amount when it 
calculates the exposure for the three bracketed images.
 
One feature you may want to disable when you use AEB, however, is the Auto 
Lighting Optimizer option. Because that feature is designed to automatically 
adjust images that are underexposed or lacking in contrast, it can render AEB 
ineffective. See the section “Experimenting with Auto Lighting Optimization,” 
earlier in this chapter, for information on where to find and turn off the feature.

169
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
With that preamble out of the way, the following steps show you how to turn 
on AEB via Shooting Menu 2. (More about another option for enabling the 
feature momentarily.)
 
1. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Expo. Comp./AEB, as shown on 
the left in Figure 5-29.
 
 
Figure 5-29: Auto exposure bracketing records your image at three exposure settings.
 
2. Press Set.
 
 You see a screen similar to the one shown on the right in Figure 5-29. 
This is the same dual-natured screen that appears when you apply expo-
sure compensation through the menu, as explained earlier in the chap-
ter. When the screen first appears, it’s in Exposure Compensation mode, 
so the meter reflects the possible settings for that feature, –2 to +2.
 
3. Rotate the Main dial to establish the amount of exposure change you 
want between images.
 
 As soon as you rotate the dial, the meter expands, giving you a broader 
range of adjustment than the Exposure Compensation feature.
 
 In addition to the extra stops on the meter, you see three red exposure 
indicators under the meter. These indicators show you the amount of 
exposure shift that will occur in the three shots the camera will record.
 
 Each whole number represents one stop. For example, if you use the set-
ting shown in Figure 5-29, the camera shoots one image at the actual 
exposure settings, and it then takes the second image one stop down 
(using settings that allow half as much light into the camera). The third 
image is recorded one stop brighter (using settings that allow twice as 
much light).
 
 Keep rotating the dial until you get the exposure indicators to reflect the 
amount of adjustment you want between each bracketed shot.

170
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Be careful not to try to use the cross keys instead of the Main dial to 
set the AEB amount. If you do, you enable the Exposure Compensation 
feature. You’re probably more careful, but I’ve done this on more than 
one occasion.
 
4. Press Set.
 
 AEB is now enabled. To remind 
you of that fact, the exposure 
meter in the Shooting Settings 
display shows the three exposure 
indicators to represent the 
exposure shift you established in 
Step 3, as shown in Figure 5-30. 
You see the same markers in the 
viewfinder.
If you prefer, you can also enable AEB 
through the Quick Control screen. With 
the Shooting Settings screen displayed, 
press Set and then use the cross keys 
to highlight the exposure meter. Press 
Set again to display a screen that works 
just like the one you get through the menus. Again, rotate the Main dial to set 
the bracketing amount and then press Set to wrap things up.
How you actually record your trio of exposures depends on whether you 
set the Drive mode to Single or Continuous. The Drive mode, which I intro-
duce in Chapter 2, determines whether the camera records a single image 
or multiple images with each press of the shutter button. (Press the left 
cross key to access the screen that enables you to change this setting.)
 
✓ AEB in Single mode: You take each exposure separately, pressing the 
shutter button fully three times to record your trio of images. 
 
 If you forget which exposure you’re taking, look at the exposure meter. 
After you press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, the meter 
shows just a single indicator bar instead of three. If the bar is at 0, you’re 
ready to take the first capture. If it’s to the left of 0, you’re on capture 
two, which creates the darker exposure. If it’s to the right of 0, you’re on 
capture three, which produces the brightest image. This assumes that 
you haven’t also applied exposure compensation, in which case your 
starting point will be at a notch other than zero. (Whew, I’m getting a 
headache just contemplating all the possibilities.)
Auto Exposure Bracketing indicators
Figure 5-30: The three bars under the meter 
remind you that automatic exposure 
bracketing is enabled.

171
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ AEB in Continuous mode: The camera records all three exposures with 
one press of the shutter button. To record another series, release and 
then press the shutter button again. In other words, when AEB is turned 
on, the camera doesn’t keep recording images until you release the shut-
ter button as it normally does in Continuous mode — you can take only 
three images with one press of the shutter button.
 
✓ Self-Timer/Remote modes: All three exposures are recorded with a 
single press of the shutter button, as with Continuous mode.
To turn off auto exposure bracketing, just revisit Shooting Menu 2 or the Quick 
Control screen and use the Main dial to change the AEB setting back to 0.
 
AEB is also turned off when you power down the camera, enable the flash, 
replace the camera battery, or replace the memory card. You also can’t use 
the feature in manual exposure (M) mode if you set the shutter speed to the 
Bulb option. (At that setting, the camera keeps the shutter open as long as 
you press the shutter button.)
Using Flash in Advanced Exposure Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 
produces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to 
add more light. The built-in flash on your camera offers the most convenient 
solution.
 
In the automatic exposure modes covered in Chapter 2, the camera decides 
when flash is needed. In Creative Auto mode, also discussed in Chapter 2, 
you can either let the camera retain flash control or set the flash to always 
fire or never fire. (You make that selection via the Quick Control screen.)
 
 The advanced exposure modes leave the flash decisions entirely up to you; 
no Auto mode will hand the reins over to the camera. Instead, when you want 
to use flash, just press the Flash button on the side of the camera, highlighted 
in Figure 5-31. The flash pops up and fires on your next shot. To turn off the 
flash, just press down on the flash assembly to close it.
As you can in the fully automatic modes, you also can set the flash to Red-Eye 
Reduction mode. Just display Shooting Menu 1 and turn the Red-Eye option 
on or off. When you take a picture with the feature enabled, the camera lights 
the Red-Eye Reduction lamp on the front of the camera for a brief time before 
the flash goes off in an effort to constrict the subject’s pupils and thereby 
lessen the chances of red-eye.

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The next section goes into a little 
background detail about how the 
camera calculates the flash power 
that’s needed to expose the image. 
This stuff is a little technical, but it 
will help you to better understand 
how to get the results you want 
because the flash performance varies 
depending on the exposure mode.
Following that discussion, the rest of 
the chapter covers advanced flash 
features, including flash exposure 
compensation and flash exposure 
lock (FE Lock). You’ll find some tips 
on getting better results in your 
flash pictures as well. For details on 
using Red-Eye Reduction flash, flip to 
Chapter 2, which spells everything 
out. Be sure also to visit Chapter 7, 
where you can find additional flash 
and lighting tips related to specific types of photographs.
Understanding your camera’s approach to flash
 
When you use flash, your camera automatically calculates the flash power 
needed to illuminate the subject. This process is sometimes referred to as 
flash metering. Your Rebel T1i/500D uses a flash-metering system that Canon 
calls E-TTL II. The E stands for evaluative, TTL stands for through the lens, and 
II refers to the fact that this system is an update to the first version of the 
system.
It isn’t important that you remember what the initials stand for or even the 
flash system’s official name. But what is helpful to keep in mind is how the 
system is designed to work.
First, you need to know that a flash can be used in two basic ways: as the 
primary light source or as a fill flash. When flash is the primary light source, 
both the subject and background are lit by the flash. In dim lighting, this typi-
cally results in a brightly lit subject and a dark background, as shown on the 
left in Figure 5-32.
With fill flash, the background is exposed primarily by ambient light, and the 
flash adds a little extra illumination to the subject. Fill flash typically pro-
duces brighter backgrounds and, often, softer lighting of the subject because 
not as much flash power is needed. The downside is that if the ambient light 
is dim, as in my nighttime photo, you need a slow shutter speed to properly 
Flash button

button, and you’re set to go. 

173
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
expose the image, and both the camera and the subject must remain very 
still to avoid blurring. The shutter speed for my fill-flash image, shown on the 
right in Figure 5-32, was 1/30 second, for example. Fortunately, I had a tripod, 
and the deer didn’t seem inclined to move.
 
Flash as primary light source
Fill flash
 
Figure 5-32: Fill flash produces brighter backgrounds.
Neither choice is necessarily right or wrong. Whether you want a dark back-
ground depends on the scene and your artistic interpretation. If you want 
to diminish the background, you may prefer the darker background you get 
when you use flash as your primary light source. But if the background is 
important to the context of the shot, allowing the camera to absorb more 
ambient light and adding just a small bit of fill flash may be more to your 
liking.
 
One more note on flash: Although most people think of flash as a tool for 
nighttime and low-light photography, most outdoor daytime pictures, espe-
cially portraits, also benefit from a little fill flash. Figure 5-33 shows you the 
same scene, shot at a farmer’s market on a sunny morning, captured with and 
without fill flash, for example.

174
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Without flash
With flash
 
Figure 5-33: Flash often improves daytime pictures outdoors.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as 
Figure 5-33 illustrates, giving colors a subtle reddish-yellowish tint. This color 
shift occurs because when you enable the flash, the camera’s white balanc-
ing mechanism warms color slightly to compensate for the bluish light of a 
flash. But because your scene is actually lit primarily by sunlight, which is not 
as cool as flash light, the white balance adjustment takes the image colors a 
step warmer than neutral. If you don’t want this warming effect, see Chapter 
6 to find out how to make a manual white balance adjustment.
So how does this little flash lesson relate to your camera? Well, the exposure 
mode you use (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP) determines whether the flash operates 
as a fill flash or as the primary light source. The exposure mode also controls 
the extent to which the camera adjusts the aperture and shutter speed in 
response to the ambient light in the scene.
 
In all modes, the camera analyzes the light both in the background and on 
the subject. Then it calculates the exposure and flash output as follows: 
 
✓ P: In this mode, the shutter speed is automatically set between 1/60 and 
1/200 second. If the ambient light is sufficient, the flash output is geared 
to providing fill-flash lighting. Otherwise, the flash is determined to be 

175
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
the primary light source, and the output is adjusted accordingly. In the 
latter event, the image background may be dark, as in the left example in 
Figure 5-32.
 
✓ Tv: In this mode, the flash defaults to fill-flash behavior. After you select 
a shutter speed, the camera determines the proper aperture to expose 
the background with ambient light. Then it sets the flash power to pro-
vide fill-flash lighting to the subject.
 
 You can select a shutter speed between 30 seconds and 1/200 second. 
If the aperture (f-stop) setting blinks, the camera can’t expose the 
background properly at the shutter speed you selected. You can adjust 
either the shutter speed or ISO to correct the problem.
 
✓ Av: Again, the flash is designed to serve as fill-flash lighting. After you 
set the f-stop, the camera selects the shutter speed needed to expose 
the background using only ambient light. The flash power is then geared 
to fill in shadows on the subject.
 
 Depending on the ambient light and your selected f-stop, the camera 
sets the shutter speed at anywhere from 30 seconds to 1/200 second. So 
be sure to note the shutter speed before you shoot — at slow shutter 
speeds, you may need a tripod to avoid camera shake. Your subject also 
must stay very still to avoid blurring.
 
 If you want to avoid the possi-
bility of a slow shutter alto-
gether, you can. Display Setup 
Menu 3, select Custom 
Functions, and press Set. Then 
select Custom Function 3, as 
shown in Figure 5-34. At the 
default setting, the camera 
operates as just described. If 
you instead select the second 
option, the camera sticks with a 
shutter-speed range of 1/60 to 
1/200 second. And with the third 
option, the shutter speed is 
always set to 1/200 second when 
you use flash.
 
 The latter two options both ensure that you can handhold the camera 
without blur, but obviously, in dim lighting, it can result in a dark back-
ground because the camera doesn’t have time to soak up much ambient 
light. At the 1/60 to 1/200 setting, the backgrounds are usually brighter 
than the 1/200 fixed setting, of course, because the camera at least has 
the latitude to slow the shutter to 1/60 second.
Figure 5-34: You can limit the camera to a 
fast shutter when using Av mode with flash.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ M: In this mode, the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO setting you select 
determine how brightly the background will be exposed. The camera 
takes care of illuminating the subject with fill flash. The maximum shut-
ter speed you can select is 1/200 second; the slowest normal shutter 
speed is 1/30 second.
 
 You also can set the shutter speed to the Bulb setting — which keeps 
the shutter open as long as you keep the shutter button pressed, how-
ever. In Bulb mode, the flash fires at the beginning of the exposure if 
the Shutter Sync setting is set to the 1st Curtain setting; with the 2nd 
Curtain setting, the flash fires at the beginning of the exposure and again 
at the end. See the upcoming section “Exploring more flash options” for 
details about the Shutter Sync setting. 
 
✓ A-DEP: You can use flash in this mode, but doing so disables the auto-
matic depth-of-field feature. The flash and exposure systems then oper-
ate as described for P mode. However, you can’t choose from multiple 
combinations of aperture and shutter speed as you can in that mode; 
you’re stuck with the combination that the camera selects.
If the flash output in any mode isn’t to your liking, you can adjust it by using 
flash exposure compensation, explained next. Also check out the upcoming 
section “Locking the flash exposure” for another trick to manipulate flash 
results. In any auto-exposure mode, you can also use exposure compensation, 
discussed earlier, to tweak the ambient exposure — that is, the brightness of 
your background. So you have multiple points of control: exposure compensa-
tion to manipulate the background brightness, and flash compensation and 
flash exposure lock to adjust the flash output.
One final point: These guidelines apply to the camera’s built-in-flash. If you 
use certain Canon external flash units, you not only have more flash control, 
but can select a faster shutter speed than the built-in flash permits.
Adjusting flash power with Flash 
Exposure Compensation
 
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the 
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure in the current lighting 
conditions. On some occasions, you may find that you want a little more or 
less light than the camera thinks is appropriate.
You can adjust the flash output by using a feature called Flash Exposure 
Compensation. Similar to exposure compensation, discussed earlier in this 
chapter, flash exposure compensation affects the output level of the flash 
unit, whereas exposure compensation affects the brightness of the back-
ground in your flash photos. As with exposure compensation, flash exposure 
compensation is stated in terms of EV (exposure value) numbers. A setting of 
0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the flash power to +2.0 or 
decrease it to –2.0.

177
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Figure 5-35 shows an example of the benefit of this feature — again, available 
only when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. I snapped these toma-
toes during bright daylight, but a tent awning shaded them. The first image 
shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a little more light, but at normal 
flash power, the flash was too strong, blowing out the highlights in some 
areas, as shown in the middle image. By reducing the flash power to EV –1.3, 
I got a softer flash that straddled the line perfectly between no flash and too 
much flash.
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV –1.3
Figure 5-35: When normal flash output is too strong, lower your flash exposure compensation.
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a flash 
exposure compensation of +2.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and 
you simply can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other 
words, don’t even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from 
your seat in the balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
Whichever direction you want to go with flash power, you have two ways to 
do so:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: This path is by far the easiest way to travel. After 
displaying the Shooting Settings screen, press Set to shift to the Quick 
Control display. Then use the cross keys to highlight the Flash Exposure 

178
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Compensation value, as shown on the left in Figure 5-36. Rotate the Main 
dial to raise or lower the amount of flash adjustment. Or, if you need 
more help, press Set to display the second screen in the figure, which 
reminds you that the setting has no impact when you use an external 
flash. (You set the flash power on the external flash unit instead.) You 
can use the Main dial or cross keys to adjust the flash power on this 
screen; press Set when you finish.
 
✓ Shooting Menu 2: The menu route to flash power is a little more 
tedious. Display Shooting Menu 1, select Flash Control, and press Set. 
You then see the left screen in Figure 5-37. Highlight the Built-in Flash 
Func. Setting and press Set to display the right screen. Now highlight 
Flash Exp. Comp. and press Set again. The little flash power meter 
becomes activated, and you can then use the right or left cross keys to 
adjust the setting. Press Set when you finish. (In other words, learn the 
Quick Control method and save yourself a bunch of button presses!)
 
 
Figure 5-36: The quickest way to adjust flash power is via the Quick Control screen.
 
 
Figure 5-37: You can also change flash power with the menus, but it’s a tedious task.

179
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
You also have the option of customizing the Set button so that it displays the 
flash-power screen you see in Figure 5-36. (Chapter 11 shows you how.) The 
problem is that you then lose access to the Quick Control method of chang-
ing other camera settings because the Set button normally shifts the Shooting 
Settings display to the Quick Control display. So I don’t recommend that 
option.
When flash compensation is in effect, 
the value appears in the Shooting 
Settings screen, as shown in Figure 
5-38. You see the same plus/minus 
flash symbol in the viewfinder and 
Live View display, although in both 
cases without the actual Flash 
Exposure Compensation value. If 
you change the Flash Exposure 
Compensation value to zero, the flash-
power icon disappears from all the 
displays.
 
As with exposure compensation, any 
flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force until you reset the 
control, even if you turn off the camera. 
So be sure to check the setting before using your flash. Additionally, the Auto 
Lighting Optimizer feature, covered earlier in this chapter, can interfere with 
the effect produced by flash exposure compensation, so you may want to 
disable it.
Locking the flash exposure
You might never notice it, but when you press the shutter button to take 
a picture with flash enabled, the camera emits a very brief preflash before 
the actual flash. This preflash is used to determine the proper flash power 
needed to expose the image.
 
Occasionally, the information that the camera collects from the preflash can 
be off-target because of the assumptions the system makes about what area 
of the frame is likely to contain your subject. To address this problem, your 
camera has a feature called Flash Exposure Lock, or FE Lock. This tool 
enables you to set the flash power based on only the center of the frame.
 
Unfortunately, FE Lock is not available in Live View mode. So if you want to 
use this feature, you must abandon Live View and use the viewfinder to frame 
your images. 
Flash Compensation amount
Figure 5-38: The flash value appears only 
when flash compensation is in effect.

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Follow these steps to use FE Lock:
 
1. Frame your photo so that your subject falls under the center autofocus 
point.
 
 You want your subject smack in the middle of the frame. You can 
reframe the shot after locking the flash exposure if you want.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera meters the light in the scene. If you’re using autofocusing, 
focus is set on your subject, and the green focus confirmation dot 
appears in the viewfinder. (If focus is set at another spot in the frame, 
see Chapter 6 to find out how to select the center autofocus point.) 
You can now lift your finger off the shutter button if you want. If you’re 
using autofocusing, focus is set on your subject, and the green focus 
confirmation dot appears in the viewfinder. You can now lift your finger 
off the shutter button if you want.
 
 
3. While the subject is still under the center autofocus point, press and 
release the AE Lock button.
 
 
 You can see the button in the margin here. The camera emits the pre-
flash, and the letters FEL display for a second in the viewfinder. (FEL 
stands for flash exposure lock.) You also see the asterisk symbol — the 
one that appears above the AE Lock button on the camera body — next 
to the flash icon in the viewfinder. 
 
4. If needed, re-establish focus on your subject.
 
 In autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button halfway. (You need 
to take this step only if you released the shutter button after Step 2.) In 
manual focus mode, twist the focusing ring on the lens to establish focus.
 
5. Reframe the image to your desired composition.
 
 While you do, keep the shutter button pressed halfway to maintain focus 
if you’re using autofocusing.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
 
 The image is captured using the flash output setting you established in 
Step 3.
 
Flash exposure lock is also helpful when you’re shooting portraits. The pre-
flash sometimes causes people to blink, which means that with normal flash 
shooting, in which the actual flash and exposure occur immediately after the 
preflash, their eyes are closed at the exact moment of the exposure. With 
flash exposure lock, you can fire the preflash and then wait a second or two 
for the subject’s eyes to recover before you take the actual picture.
Better yet, the flash exposure setting remains in force for about 16 seconds, 
meaning that you can shoot a series of images using the same flash setting 
without firing another preflash at all. 

181
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Exploring more flash options
When you set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP, Shooting Menu 1 
offers an option called Flash Control. Through this menu item, you can 
adjust flash power, as explained a couple of sections ago (although using 
the Quick Control screen is easier). The Flash Control option also enables 
you to customize a few other aspects of the built-in flash as well as an 
external flash head.
To explore your options, highlight Flash Control, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-39, and press Set. You then see the screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Here’s the rundown of the available options:
 
 
Figure 5-39: You can customize additional flash options via Setup Menu 1.
 
✓ Flash Firing: Normally, this option is set to Enable. If you want to dis-
able the flash, you can choose Disable instead. However, you don’t have 
to take this step in most cases — just close the pop-up flash head on top 
of the camera if you don’t want to use flash.
 
 What’s the point of this option, then? Well, if you use autofocusing in 
dim lighting, the camera may need some help finding its target. To that 
end, it sometimes emits an AF-assist beam from the flash head — the 
beam is actually a series of rapid pulses of light. If you want the benefit 
of the AF-assist beam but you don’t want the flash to actually fire, you 
can disable flash firing. Remember that you do have to pop up the flash 
unit to expose the lamp that emits the beam. You also can take advan-
tage of this option when you attach an external flash head.
 
✓ Built-In Flash Function Setting: If you highlight this option and press Set, 
you display the screen shown in Figure 5-40. The first option is unavail-
able for the built-in flash. The other three affect the flash as follows:

182
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
• Shutter Sync: By default, the 
flash fires at the beginning 
of the exposure. This flash 
timing, known as 1st curtain 
sync, is the best choice for 
most subjects. However, if 
you use a very slow shutter 
speed and you’re photo-
graphing a moving object, 
1st curtain sync causes the 
blur that results from the 
motion to appear in front of 
the object, which doesn’t 
make much visual sense. 
 
 To solve this problem, you can change the Shutter Sync option to 
2nd curtain sync, also known as rear-curtain sync. In this flash mode, 
the motion trails appear behind the moving object. The flash actu-
ally fires twice in this mode: once when you press the shutter 
button and again at the end of the exposure.
 
• Flash Exposure Compensation: This setting adjusts the power of the 
built-in flash; again, see the earlier section “Adjusting flash power 
with Flash Exposure Compensation” for details.
 
• E-TTL II: This option enables you to switch from the default flash 
metering approach, called Evaluative. In this mode, the camera 
operates as described in the earlier section, “Understanding your 
camera’s approach to flash.” That is, it exposes the background 
using ambient light when possible and then sets the flash power to 
serve as fill light on the subject.
 
 If you instead select the Average option, the flash is used as the 
primary light source, meaning that the flash power is set to expose 
the entire scene without relying on ambient light. Typically, this 
results in a more powerful (and possibly harsh) flash lighting and 
dark backgrounds.
 
✓ External Flash controls: The final three options on the Flash Control list 
(refer to the right screen in Figure 5-39) relate to external flash heads; 
they don’t affect the performance of the built-in flash. However, they 
apply only to Canon EX-series Speedlites that enable you to control 
the flash through the camera. If you own such a flash, refer to the flash 
manual for details.
You can probably discern from these descriptions that most of these features 
are designed for photographers schooled in flash photography who want to 
mess around with advanced flash options. If that doesn’t describe you, don’t 
Figure 5-40: These advanced flash options 
affect only the built-in flash.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
worry about it. The default settings selected by Canon will serve you well in 
most every situation — the exception being flash exposure compensation, 
which you can just as easily adjust via Shooting Menu 2.
Using an external flash unit
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external 
flash head like the one shown in Figure 5-41. The figure features the Canon 
Speedlite 580EX II, which currently retails for right around $350.
Although certainly not the cheapest of camera 
accessories, an external flash may be a worth-
while investment if you do a lot of flash pho-
tography, especially portraits. For one thing, 
an external flash offers greater power, enabling 
you to illuminate a larger area than you can 
with a built-in flash. And with flash units like 
the one in Figure 5-41, you can rotate the 
flash head so that the flash light bounces off a 
wall or ceiling instead of hitting your subject 
directly. This results in softer lighting and can 
eliminate the harsh shadows often caused by 
the strong, narrowly focused light of a built-in 
flash. (Chapter 7 offers an example of the 
difference this lighting technique can make 
in portraits.) Additionally, certain Canon flash 
units permit you to use a shutter speed faster 
than the 1/200-second limit imposed by the 
built-in flash.
Whether the investment in an external flash 
will be worthwhile depends on the kind of photography you want to do. If 
you decide to purchase an external flash, I strongly recommend that you 
shop at a reputable camera store where the personnel can help you match 
the flash unit to your shooting needs. You don’t have to buy a Canon flash, 
but be aware that non-Canon flash units do not operate in Live View mode.
You may also want to dig into some of the many books that concentrate 
solely on flash photography. There’s a lot more to that game than you may 
imagine, and you’ll no doubt discover some great ideas about lighting your 
pictures with flash. You can start with Chapter 7, which provides some spe-
cific examples of how to get better flash results when you shoot portraits, 
whether you go with the built-in flash, an external flash, or, my favorite, 
no flash.

a rotating head offers greater 
lighting flexibility.

▶ Understanding focal lengths, depth of field, and other focus factors
▶ Exploring white balance and other color options
T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied 
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. But an artful 
photographer knows that there’s more to focus than simply getting a sharp 
image of a subject. You also need to consider depth of field, or the distance 
over which objects remain sharply focused. This chapter explains all 
the ways to control depth of field and also discusses how to use 
your Rebel’s advanced autofocus options.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of color, 
explaining such concepts as White Balance (a feature 
that compensates for the varying color casts cre-
ated by different light sources), and color space (an 
option that determines the spectrum of colors your 
camera can capture).
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. 
But just in case you’re not reading this book from front to 
back, the following steps provide a recap of the basic process 
of focusing with your Rebel T1i/500D.
 
These steps relate only to regular, still photography. You can find details on 
autofocusing in Live View mode and Movie mode later in this chapter and get 
a thorough introduction to those modes in Chapter 4.

186
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight.
 
 Chapter 1 explains how to take this critical step.
 
2. Set the focusing switch on the lens to manual or automatic focusing.
 
 To focus manually, set the switch 
to the MF position. For autofo-
cusing, set the switch to the AF 
position, as in Figure 6-1. (These 
directions are specific to the kit 
lens sold with the Rebel T1i/500D, 
as shown in the figure. If you use 
another lens, the switch may look 
or operate differently, so check 
the product manual.)
 
3. For handheld shooting, turn on 
Image Stabilization.
 
 For sharper handheld shots, set 
the Stabilizer switch on the kit 
lens to On, as shown in Figure 6-1. 
If you use another lens that offers 
image stabilization (it may go by 
a different name, depending upon 
the manufacturer), check the lens 
manual to find out how to turn on 
the feature.
 
 For tripod-mounted shooting with a non-Canon lens, the manufacturer 
may suggest turning stabilization off, so again, check the lens manual. 
You don’t need to turn the feature off for most Canon IS lenses, but you 
can save battery power by doing so.
 
4. Set your focus:
 
• For autofocusing: Frame your subject so that it appears under one of 
the nine autofocus points. Then press and hold the shutter button 
halfway down.
 
 In Portrait, Landscape, Close Up, Night Portrait, and A-DEP modes,  
the focus lamp in the viewfinder lights, and one or more of the auto-
focus points turns red, as shown in Figure 6-2. A red dot indicates an 
active autofocus point and tells you that the area under the dot is in 
focus. Focus is maintained as long as you continue to hold the shut-
ter button down halfway.
 
 If you shoot in Sports mode, the focus indicators don’t appear. Instead,
focus is continuously adjusted as needed to track a moving subject 
until you snap the picture. The same thing occurs in Full Auto, Flash 
Off, and Creative Auto modes if the camera senses motion in front of 
the lens; otherwise focus is locked and you see the indicator lights.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 In P, Tv, Av, and M modes, you can choose which autofocusing 
behavior you prefer and also select which of the nine autofocus 
you want to use when establishing autofocus. See the next section 
for the complete scoop on autofocusing options.
 
• For manual focus: Twist the focusing ring on the lens. 
 
 Even in manual mode, you can confirm focus by pressing the shutter 
button halfway. The autofocus point or points that achieved focus 
flash for a second or two, and the viewfinder’s focus lamp lights up.
 
Never twist the lens focusing ring on the kit lens without first setting the lens 
switch to the MF position. You can damage the lens by doing so! If you use 
another lens, check your lens manual for advice. Some lenses enable you to 
set focus initially using autofocus and then fine-tune focus by twisting the 
focusing ring without officially setting the lens to manual-focusing mode.

Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to 
the issues discussed in this chapter. Any move-
ment of the camera or subject can also cause 
blur. Both of these problems are actually related 
to shutter speed, an exposure control that I 
cover in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 
7, which provides some additional tips for cap-
turing moving objects without blur.

188
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your Rebel T1i/500D’s autofocusing system: 
which autofocus points are used to establish focus, and the AF (autofocus) 
mode. The next two sections explain these features.
Selecting an autofocus point
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes (Full Auto, 
Portrait, Landscape, and so on) as well as in Creative Auto and A-DEP mode, 
all nine of your camera’s autofocus points are active. That means that the 
camera’s autofocusing system looks at all the points when trying to establish 
focus. Typically, the camera sets focus on the point that falls over the object 
closest to the lens. If that focusing decision doesn’t suit your needs, you have 
two options:
 
✓ Focus manually.
 
✓ Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In those modes, you 
can tell the camera to base focus on a specific autofocus point.
Chapter 1 explains how to adjust focus manually. If you want to use autofocus-
ing and specify an autofocus point, the following steps spell out the process.
 
Again, these steps assume that you are not shooting in Live View mode or 
recording a movie. I explain the intricacies of Live View and Movie mode 
autofocusing a little later in this chapter, in the section cleverly named 
“Autofocusing in Live View and Movie Modes.” However, some of the autofo-
cusing concepts involved in normal shooting also come into play for Live 
View and movie autofocusing, so familiarize yourself with these steps before 
you jump to that discussion.
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, or M.
 
 Again, you can specify an autofocus point only in these exposure modes.
 
 
2. Press and release the AF Point Selection button, highlighted in 
Figure 6-3.
 
 When you do, you see the AF Point Selection screen on the monitor. In 
Automatic AF Point Selection mode, all the autofocus points appear in 
color, as shown in Figure 6-4. In Manual AF Point Selection mode, only 
one point is selected and appears in color, as shown in Figure 6-5. In the 
figure, the center AF point is selected.

189
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 You can check the current 
mode by looking through the 
viewfinder, too. When you 
press and release the AF Point 
Selection button, all nine auto-
focus points turn red if you’re 
in Automatic AF Point Selection 
mode. A single point turns red 
if you’re in Manual AF Point 
Selection mode.
 
3. To choose a single autofo-
cus point, set the camera to 
Manual AF Point Selection 
mode.
 
 You can do this in two ways:
 
• Rotate the Main dial. This 
option is easiest when 
your eye is up to the 
viewfinder.
 
• Press the Set button. 
Pressing the button 
toggles you between 
Automatic AF Point 
Selection and Manual AF 
Point Selection with the 
center point activated.
 
4. Specify which AF Point you want 
to use.
 
 You can either rotate the Main 
dial or press the cross keys to 
select a point. When all autofo-
cus points again turn red, you’ve 
cycled back to automatic AF Point 
Selection mode. Rotate 
the dial or press a cross key to 
switch back to single-point 
selection. 
That’s all there is to it. After you select the autofocus point, just frame your 
shot so that your subject falls under that point and then press the shutter 
button halfway to focus.

Selection button to select an autofocus point.

autofocus points are active.

190
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
If you want the benefits of autofocus 
but find it bothersome to have to 
worry about selecting an autofocus 
point, try this approach: Set the 
camera to Manual AF Point Selection 
and select the center point as the 
active point. Now the camera will 
always set focus based on whatever is 
at the center of the frame. If you want 
your subject to appear off-center, you 
still can: Just frame the picture initially 
so that the subject is centered, press 
the shutter button halfway to establish 
focus, and then reframe the image 
before pressing the shutter button the 
rest of the way.
Do be careful about exposure if you use this technique, however. If the expo-
sure metering mode is set to Partial, Spot, or Center-Weighted Average meter-
ing and you reframe the image so that your subject isn’t at the center of the 
frame, exposure may be off. To compensate, you may need to lock exposure 
(using the AE Lock button) before you reframe. In Evaluative metering mode, 
this issue shouldn’t be a big problem because exposure is based on the entire 
frame. Chapter 5 provides details about metering modes, autoexposure lock, 
and other exposure issues.
Changing the AF (autofocus) mode
Your camera offers three different autofocusing schemes, which you select 
through a control called AF mode. The three choices work like so:
 
✓ One-Shot: In this mode, which is geared to shooting stationary subjects, 
the camera locks focus when you press the shutter button halfway. 
Focus remains locked as long as you hold the shutter button at that half-
way position.
 
✓ AI Servo: In this mode, the camera adjusts focus continually as needed 
from when you press the shutter button halfway to the time you take 
the picture. This mode is designed to make focusing on moving objects 
easier.
 
 For AI Servo to work properly, you must reframe as needed to keep your 
subject under the active autofocus point if you’re working in Manual AF 
Point Selection mode. If the camera is set to Automatic AF Point Selection, 
the camera initially bases focus on the center focus point. If the subject 
moves away from that point, focus should still be okay as long as you 
keep the subject within the area covered by one of the other autofocus 
points. (The preceding section explains these two modes.)
Figure 6-5: You also can base autofocus 
on a single point; here, the center point is 
selected.

191
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 In either case, the green focus dot in the viewfinder blinks rapidly if the 
camera isn’t tracking focus successfully. If all is going well, the focus dot 
doesn’t light up at all, nor do you hear the beep that normally sounds 
when focus is achieved. (You can hear the autofocus motor whirring a 
little when the camera adjusts focus.)
 
✓ AI Focus: This mode automatically switches the camera from One-Shot 
to AI Servo as needed. When you first press the shutter button halfway, 
focus is locked on the active autofocus point (or points), as usual in 
One-Shot mode. But if the subject moves, the camera shifts into AI Servo 
mode and adjusts focus as it thinks is warranted.
Which of these three autofocus modes are available to you, however, 
depends on the exposure mode, as follows:
 
✓ P, Tv, Av, and M modes: You can select any of the three AF mode 
options.
 
✓ A-DEP, Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, and Close-Up modes: The 
camera restricts you to One-Shot mode.
 
✓ Sports mode: The camera always uses AI Servo autofocus.
 
✓ Full Auto, Creative Auto, and No Flash modes: These modes always use 
AI Focus.
 
 AI stands for artificial intelligence, if that helps.
So, assuming that you’re using an exposure mode that enables you to choose 
from all three AF modes, which one is best? Here’s my take: One-Shot mode 
works best for shooting still subjects, and AI Servo is the right choice for 
moving subjects. But frankly, AI Focus does a good job in most cases of 
making that shift for you and saves you the trouble of having to change the 
mode each time you go from shooting still to moving subjects. So, in my 
mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting unless you’re shooting 
moving objects and want to be able to lock focus at a specific position — in 
which case, my recommendation would be to simply switch to manual focus-
ing anyway.
Whatever your decision, you can set the AF mode in two ways:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: Display the Shooting Settings screen (just press 
the shutter button halfway and release it). Then press Set and use the 
cross keys to highlight the icon shown in Figure 6-6. The selected AF 
mode setting appears at the bottom of the screen. Rotate the Main dial 
to cycle through the three mode options.

192
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 If you prefer, you can press Set after highlighting the AF mode icon to 
display the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-6, where all the mode 
choices appear. Then use the cross keys or Main dial to highlight your 
choice and press Set again.
 
✓ AF button (right cross key): Press this button to go directly to the 
screen shown on the right in Figure 6-6. Select your choice and 
press Set.

Autofocusing in Live View and Movie Modes
Chapter 4 covers the basics of shooting in Live View mode and Movie mode, 
both of which require you to compose your shots by using the camera moni-
tor instead of the viewfinder. I mention in that discussion that the simplest 
and most reliable focusing choice is to do the job manually rather than rely-
ing on autofocus, and Chapter 4 explains the steps involved in doing just that.
 
If you do want to try autofocusing, the next four sections walk you through 
the process. Before you move on, though, note the following limitations with 
all the autofocusing methods:
 
✓ Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. You can set the AF mode to AI 
Servo, but even if you do, the camera behaves as if you instead selected 
the One-Shot option. In other words, the camera won’t track focus on a 
moving subject. 

193
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 During movie recording, you might be tempted to reset autofocus if 
your subject moves. Typically, however, the autofocus system has to 
“hunt” for the subject a little, causing the shot to go in and out of focus 
a couple of times before focus is set. Sometimes, the image brightness 
may change a little as well. So unless this “special effect” is a creative 
choice that interests you, I recommend focusing manually if you think 
you’ll need to adjust focus during the recording.
 
✓ Autoexposure and autofocus are set and locked together. When you 
autofocus in Live View mode, you don’t press the shutter button halfway 
to establish focus as you normally do. Instead, you focus by pressing 
the AE Lock button — which also locks autoexposure. Chapter 5 covers 
autoexposure (AE) locking. If you want to lock exposure and focus sepa-
rately, you have to reset the function of the AE Lock button.
 
 You do this through Custom Function 10, which you can explore fully in 
Chapter 11. For the purpose of Live View and movie autofocusing, select 
option 1, AE Lock/AF. After you do, you lock autoexposure by using 
the shutter button and lock autofocus by pressing the AE Lock button. 
(Trust me, however, that simply focusing manually is much simpler than 
this convoluted process. And don’t make this change to the button func-
tions while using this book, or things won’t work as described.)
 
✓ Autofocusing isn’t possible with remote-control shooting. If you want 
to control the camera with a remote unit, you must switch to manual 
focusing.
Choosing the Live View or Movie 
mode autofocusing method
You can choose from the following three different modes of Live View and 
movie-recording autofocusing, represented by the symbols you see in the 
margins:
 
QUICK
AF
 
✓ Quick mode: The live preview briefly shuts off after you initiate autofo-
cusing and then reappears when focus is set. As its name implies, this is 
the fastest option.
 
Live
AF
 
✓ Live mode: The preview doesn’t go dark, and you can see your subject 
in the monitor during the entire focusing process. However, this is the 
slowest and least reliable of the three modes.
 
AF
 
✓ Live mode with face detection: This mode works the same as Live 
mode, but the camera automatically locks focus on a face in the scene if 
it can find one. When the conditions are just right in terms of lighting, 
composition, and phase of the moon, this setup works fairly well. 
However, a number of issues can trip it up. For example, the camera may 

194
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
mistakenly focus on an object that has a similar shape, color, and con-
trast to a face. It also won’t work if the face isn’t just the right size with 
respect to the background, is tilted at an angle, is too bright or dark, or 
partly obscured. And, like regular Live mode autofocus, it’s slower than 
Quick mode. 
To select the mode you want to use, use either of these techniques:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: After switching to Live View or Movie mode, 
press Set to display a stack of control icons on the left side of the 
screen, as shown on the left in Figure 6-7. The symbol representing the 
current autofocusing method appears at the top of that stack of icons.
 
Autofocus mode
 
 
Figure 6-7: During Live View or movie shooting, press Set to enter Quick Control mode and 
 
 
adjust the autofocusing method.
 
 Next, use the cross keys to highlight the autofocus option, as shown on 
the right in the figure and then rotate the Main dial to change the set-
ting. (If you select Quick mode, you also see nine small autofocus points 
in the center of the screen; more about that in the next section.) Press 
the shutter button halfway and release it to exit the Quick Control 
display.
 
✓ Setup Menu 2/Movie mode: For Live View shooting, you also can 
choose the autofocus option through Setup Menu 2. Highlight Live View 
Function Settings, as shown on the left in Figure 6-8 and then press Set 
to get to the second screen in the figure. Highlight AF mode, as shown 
on the right in the figure. Press Set again to display the three autofocus 
options, highlight your choice, and press Set to exit the menu. In Movie 
mode, you can access the options through the AF Mode setting on the 
Movie menu.

195
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
You could use a slightly different technique to set focus in each mode, so the 
next three sections spell out the details.
 
 
Figure 6-8: You can also change the Live View autofocus setting via Setup Menu 2.
Quick mode autofocusing
As its name implies, Quick mode offers the fastest autofocusing during Live 
View or movie shooting. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Set the lens switch to the AF position.
 
 Or if you use a lens other than the kit lens, select whatever switch posi-
tion enables autofocusing.
 
2. Engage the Live View or Movie display.
 
 
• For Live View: Set the Mode dial to the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode 
and then press the Live View button, shown in the margin.
 
 
• For Movie recording: Turn the Mode dial to the little movie-camera 
icon, and the live preview appears without further ado.
 
 Either way, the camera initially displays a brief text message that 
reminds you to use the AE Lock button to set focus. You can either 
wait out the message — it disappears in a few seconds — or move right 
ahead to Step 3.
 
3. Press Set, highlight the Autofocus mode icon, and rotate the Main dial 
to set the mode to Quick.
 
 Rectangles representing the nine autofocus points appear in the center 
of the screen.

196
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
4. Select the autofocus point you want the camera to use to establish 
focus.
 
 First press the right cross key to highlight the autofocus points, as 
shown on the left in Figure 6-9. (If the Quick Control screen disappears 
before you take this step, just press Set to bring it back.) Now you have 
the same options as when you set the AF Point Selection mode during 
normal shooting: 
 
• Automatic focus point selection: All nine autofocus points are active, 
and the camera decides which one to use when setting the focus 
distance.
 
• Manual focus point selection: You select which of the nine focusing 
points you want the camera to use.
 
 When all nine points are highlighted, as on the left in Figure 6-9, auto-
matic focus point selection is in force. Rotate the Main dial to shift to 
manual point selection; keep rotating the dial until the point you want 
to use is highlighted. In the right screen on Figure 6-9, for example, the 
center point is active.
 
Active autofocus points
 
 
Figure 6-9: In Quick Mode, these small rectangles represent autofocus points.
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway and release it to return to shooting 
mode.
 
 Now you see an additional large rectangle along with your single 
selected point, as shown in Figure 6-10, or with all nine points, if you 
opted for automatic focus-point selection. That large rectangle is the 
focusing frame and comes into play later, in Step 9.

197
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
6. Frame your shot so that your 
subject falls under your 
selected autofocus point.
 
 Or, if you set the camera to 
automatic focus-point selection 
(meaning all nine points are 
active), just make sure that one 
of the small rectangles falls over 
your subject.
 
 
7. Press and hold the AE Lock 
button until you hear a beep.
 
 As soon as you press the button, 
the monitor turns black, and the 
autofocusing mechanism kicks 
into gear. Keep pressing the 
button until the camera beeps. 
The beep signals you that focus 
is set.
 
 In P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode, the autoexposure system fires up and 
establishes exposure settings along with focus.
 
8. When focus is set, release the AE Lock button.
 
 The live preview reappears on the monitor.
 
9. Verify focus (optional).
 
 
 You can magnify the display to double-check focus if you want. First 
press the cross keys to move the large focusing frame (refer to Figure 
6-10) over the area of interest. Then press the AF Point Selection button 
to magnify the area inside the frame. Your first press displays a 5-times 
magnified view; press again for a 10-times magnification. When you’re 
satisfied with focus, press the AF Point Selection button again to return 
to the normal display magnification.
 
 If focus is off, you can try reframing the scene and repeating Step 7 — 
that is, press and hold the AE Lock button until you hear the beep that 
indicates that focus has been reestablished. You can’t, however, select a 
different AF point without pressing Set to shift back to the Quick Control 
screen. You then can repeat Step 4 to change the AF point.
After focus is established, press the shutter button all the way to take your 
picture. Or, to start recording a movie, press the Live View button. See 
Chapter 4 for all the pertinent details.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Using Live mode autofocusing
Live mode autofocusing enables you to set focus without temporarily losing 
the monitor preview during Live View or movie shooting. Additionally, you 
don’t have to fiddle with choosing an autofocusing point — instead, you just 
move a single focusing frame over your subject. In short, this autofocusing 
method is probably more intuitive to use than Quick mode.
 
On the very significant downside, however, Live mode autofocusing is notice-
ably slower than Quick mode, and the camera may have more trouble locking 
focus than in Quick mode. (The difference is due to the autofocusing system 
that the camera employs.)
To try it out for yourself, first set the lens switch to the AF position. Then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Live View or Movie mode.
 
 Again, for Live View, you set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP and 
then press the Live View button. For movie recording, spin the Mode 
dial to the Movie setting. In both cases, you see the screen reminding 
you to use the AE Lock button to focus; give it a few seconds to disap-
pear or just move on to Step 2.
 
2. Set the autofocus mode to Live.
 
 You can do this by pressing Set, highlighting the autofocus option (refer 
to Figure 6-7), and then rotating the Main dial to cycle through the three 
settings. Press the shutter button halfway and release it when you’re 
done.
 
 A rectangular focusing frame 
appears in the center of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
3. Use the cross keys to move the 
focusing frame over the area on 
which you want to focus.
 
 
4. Press and hold the AE Lock 
button.
 
 The camera attempts to 
establish focus and also sets 
exposure, if you’re using any 
exposure mode but M (manual).
 
5. When the focusing frame turns 
green and you hear a beep, 
release the AE Lock button.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 These signals tell you focus has been established — and, in autoexpo-
sure modes, that exposure has been set as well.
 
 If the focusing frame instead turns red, the camera can’t establish focus. 
The best option here is to switch to manual focusing.
 
6. Verify focus (optional).
 
 
 To zoom in on the area inside the focusing frame and check focus, press 
the AF Selection Point button. Press once to zoom to a 5-times magnifi-
cation; press again to display the scene at 10-times magnification. You 
can press the cross keys to shift the position of the focusing frame to 
inspect another area.
 
 If focus appears off, you can press the AE Lock button again to restart 
autofocusing. Again, wait for the beep and green focusing frame indica-
tor to release the button.
 
 When you’re happy with focus, press the AF Point Selection button once 
more to return to normal, non-magnified view.

Using Live mode autofocus with face detection
In Live Mode with face detection, the camera searches for a face in your 
scene. If the camera thinks it found a face, it automatically places a focusing 
frame over the face and sets focus at that spot.
To use this autofocusing option, use the same steps to set up the camera as 
in the preceding section, but in Step 2, set the autofocus mode to the Face 
Detection setting.
After you set the autofocus mode, the 
camera goes to work tracking down 
possible faces in the scene. If it finds 
one face, you see the small focusing 
frame over the person. Figure 6-12 
shows how this looks in Movie mode, 
for example. If the camera detects 
more than one face, little triangles 
appear on the left and right side of 
the focusing frame. That’s your cue 
to use the right or the left cross key 
to move the frame over the person 
who is most likely to yell at you if 
they’re out of focus in the picture. 
Face-detection frame

to pick out a face on which to set focus.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you don’t see the little box, the camera can’t detect any faces; it’s best to 
switch to either Live or Quick mode to autofocus if that happens. Otherwise, 
the camera will set focus on the center of the screen, as if you had selected 
the center autofocus point in Quick mode.
From here on out, things work as spelled out in Steps 4–7 of the Live mode 
steps.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps 
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to 
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer 
home the lesson. Depth of field simply refers to the distance over which 
objects in a photograph appear sharply focused.
 
✓ With a shallow (small) depth of field: Only your subject and objects 
very close to it appear sharp. Objects at a distance from the subject 
appear blurry.
 
✓ With a large depth of field: The zone of sharp focus extends to include 
distant objects.
Which arrangement works best 
depends entirely upon your creative 
vision and your subject. In portraits, 
for example, a classic technique is 
to use a shallow depth of field, as in 
Figure 6-13. This approach increases 
emphasis on the subject while 
diminishing the impact of the back-
ground. But for the photo shown in 
Figure 6-14, I wanted the historical 
marker, the lighthouse, and the cot-
tage behind to have equal weight 
in the scene, so I used settings that 
produced a large depth of field, 
keeping them all in sharp focus.
Note, though, that with a shallow 
depth of field, which part of the 
scene appears blurry depends on 
the spot at which you establish 
focus. In the lighthouse scene, for 
example, if I had used settings that 
produced a short depth of field and 
I set focus on the lighthouse, the 
Shallow depth of field

background and draws added attention to 
the subject.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
historical marker in the foreground and the 
cottage in the background both might be 
outside the zone of sharp focus.
So how do you adjust depth of field? You 
have three points of control, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): The aperture 
is one of three exposure settings, all 
explained fully in Chapter 5. Depth of 
field increases as you stop down the 
aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop 
number). For shallow depth of field, 
open the aperture (by choosing a lower 
f-stop number).
 
 Figure 6-15 offers an example. Notice 
that the trees in the background are 
much more softly focused in the f/5.6 
example than in the f/11 version. Of 
course, changing the aperture requires 
adjusting the shutter speed or ISO to 
maintain the equivalent exposure; for 
these images, I adjusted shutter speed.
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal 
length, which is measured in millime-
ters, determines what the lens “sees.” As you increase focal length 
(use a “longer” lens, in photography speak) the angle of view narrows, 
objects appear larger in the frame, and — the important point for this 
discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, the spatial rela-
tionship of objects changes as you adjust focal length.
 
 For example, Figure 6-16 compares the same scene shot at focal lengths 
of 138mm and 255mm. I used the same aperture, f/22, for both examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal-length flexibility depends on your lens: If 
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length by zooming in or 
out. (The Rebel T1i/500D kit lens, for example, offers a focal-length range 
of 18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens and also can’t switch to a 
lens with a different focal length, scratch this means of manipulating 
depth of field.
 
 For more technical details about focal length and your camera, see the 
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: When you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
Large depth of field

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust depth of field 
also is affected by the distance between the subject and the background. 
For increased background blurring, move the subject farther in front of the 
background.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-17 
and summed up in the following list:
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (select the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum 
focal length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop setting, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
 
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
 
Figure 6-17: Aperture, focal length, and your shooting distance determine depth 
 
of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure (Av) mode: When depth of field is a 
primary concern, try using aperture-priority autoexposure (Av). In this 
mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the f-stop, and then the camera 
selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce a good exposure. The 
range of aperture settings you can access depends upon your lens.

204
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Creative Auto mode: Creative Auto mode also gives you some control 
over depth of field. In that mode, you can use the Background slider to 
request a greater or smaller depth of field, as outlined in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Fully automatic scene modes: Some of the fully automatic scene modes 
are also designed with depth of field in mind. Portrait and Close-Up 
modes produce shortened depth of field; Landscape mode produces a 
greater depth of field. You can’t adjust aperture in these modes, how-
ever, so you’re limited to the setting the camera chooses. And in certain 
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to choose an aperture 
that produces the depth of field you expect from the selected mode.
 
✓ A-DEP mode: The Rebel T1i/500D also offers a special autoexposure 
mode called A-DEP, which stands for automatic depth of field. In this 
mode, the camera selects the aperture setting that it thinks will keep all 
objects in the frame within the zone of sharp focus. You can read more 
about this mode in the next section.
 
✓ Depth of field preview: Not sure which aperture setting you need to 
produce the depth of field you want? Good news: Your camera offers 
depth of field preview, which enables you to see in advance how the 
aperture affects the focus zone. See the section labeled “Checking depth 
of field” for details on how to use this feature.
 
✓ Shutter speed: If you adjust aperture to affect depth of field, be sure to 
always keep an eye on shutter speed as well. To maintain the same expo-
sure, shutter speed must change in tandem with aperture, and you may 
encounter a situation where the shutter speed is too slow to permit 
hand-holding a camera. Lenses that offer optical image stabilization do 
enable most people to handhold the camera at slower shutter speeds 
than nonstabilized lenses, but double-check your results just to be sure. 
You can also consider raising the ISO setting to make the image sensor 
more reactive to light, but remember that higher ISO settings can pro-
duce noise. (Chapter 5 has details.)
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal 
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range of 
focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters, 
focal length determines the camera’s angle of 
view, the apparent size and distance of objects 
in the scene, and depth of field. According to 
photography tradition, a focal length of about 
50mm is a “normal” lens. Most point-and-shoot 
cameras feature this focal length, which is a 
medium-range lens that works well for the type 
of snapshots that users of those kinds of cam-
eras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length less than 35mm is typi-
cally known as a wide angle lens because at 
that focal length, the camera has a wide angle 
of view and produces a long depth of field, 

205
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Using A-DEP mode
In addition to the four advanced exposure modes found on most digital SLR 
cameras, your Rebel T1i/500D offers a fifth mode called A-DEP, as shown in 
Figure 6-18. The initials stand for automatic depth of field.
This mode is designed to assist you in producing photos that have a depth 
of field sufficient to keep all objects in the frame in sharp focus. The camera 
accomplishes this by analyzing the lens-to-subject distance for all those 
objects and then selecting the aperture that results in the appropriate depth 
of field. After choosing the aperture, the camera then selects the necessary 
shutter speed to properly expose the image at the selected f-stop.
making it good for landscape photography. A 
short focal length also has the effect of making 
objects seem smaller and farther away. At the 
other end of the spectrum, a lens with a focal 
length longer than about 80mm is considered a 
telephoto lens (often referred to as a long lens). 
With a long lens, angle of view narrows, depth 
of field decreases, and faraway subjects appear 
closer and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and 
sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated 
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called 
“35mm equivalent” focal lengths. Here’s the 
deal: For reasons that aren’t really important, 
when you put a standard lens on most digital 
cameras, including your Rebel T1i/500D, the 
available frame area is reduced, as if you took 
a picture on a camera that uses 35mm film (the 
kind you’ve probably been using for years) and 
then cropped it.
This so-called crop factor (sometimes called the 
magnification factor) varies depending on the 
digital camera, which is why the photo industry 
adopted the 35mm-equivalent measuring stick 
as a standard. With your camera, the crop-
ping factor is roughly 1.6. So the 18–55mm kit 
lens sold with the Rebel T1i/500D, for example, 
actually captures the approximate area you 
would get from a 27–82mm lens on a 35mm film 
camera. In the figure here, for example, the red 
outline indicates the image area that results 
from the 1.6 crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a 
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of 
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when 
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal 
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is 
required.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
A-DEP mode isn’t a surefire bet, 
however, and it does have some 
restrictions that may make it unsuit-
able for your subject. Here’s what you 
need to know:
 
✓ In very dim lighting, the shutter 
speed the camera selects may be 
too slow to allow you to hand-
hold the camera without risking 
camera shake. So check the shut-
ter speed in the viewfinder after 
you press the shutter button 
halfway to meter and focus the 
image.
 
✓ If the aperture value blinks in the 
viewfinder, the camera can’t set the f-stop so that you get both a good 
exposure and the depth of field necessary to keep all objects in the 
frame in sharp focus. In this situation, the camera assumes that your 
primary goal is a good exposure and adjusts the aperture as needed 
based on the available light.
 
✓ If the shutter speed blinks in the viewfinder, the light is either too 
bright or too dim for the camera to properly expose the image at any 
combination of aperture and shutter speed. In bright light, you can 
lower the ISO, if it isn’t already at 100, or reposition or shade your sub-
ject. In dim lighting, raise the ISO or add artificial light.
 
✓ You can use flash with A-DEP mode, but the minute you turn on the 
flash, the camera no longer does its automatic depth of field calcu-
lation. The same thing occurs if you switch to Live View shooting. In 
either case, the camera simply presents you with a fixed combination 
of aperture and shutter speed that will properly expose the image. The 
depth of field may or may not be what you want.
Given these limitations, my recommendation is that as soon as you fully 
understand the impact of aperture on depth of field, politely decline the 
option of using A-DEP mode and work in aperture-priority autoexposure 
mode (Av) instead. Then you can simply match the f-stop to the depth of field 
you have in mind, without giving up the option of using flash or Live View 
shooting.
Figure 6-18: A-DEP stands for automatic 
depth of field.

207
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Checking depth of field
When you look through your viewfinder and press the shutter button half-
way, you can get only a partial indication of the depth of field that your cur-
rent camera settings will produce. You can see the effect of focal length and 
the camera-to-subject distance, but because the aperture doesn’t actually 
open to your selected f-stop until you take the picture, the viewfinder doesn’t 
show you how that setting will affect depth of field.
By using the Depth-of-Field Preview button on your camera, however, you 
can do just that when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. Almost 
hidden away on the front of your camera, the button is labeled in Figure 6-19.
To use this feature, just press and hold the shutter button halfway down and 
then press and hold the Depth-of-Field Preview button with the other hand. 
Depending on the selected f-stop, the scene in the viewfinder may then get 
darker. Or in Live View mode, the same thing happens in the monitor preview. 
Either way, this effect doesn’t mean that your picture will be darker; it’s just 
a function of how the preview works.
 
Note that the preview doesn’t engage in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode if your 
aperture and shutter speed aren’t adequate to expose the image properly. 
You have to solve the exposure issue 
before you can use the preview.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some 
aspects of digital photography — 
resolution, aperture, shutter speed, 
depth of field, and so on — making 
sense of your camera’s color 
options is easy-breezy. First, color 
problems aren’t all that common, 
and when they are, they’re usually 
simple to fix with a quick shift of 
your camera’s White Balance con-
trol. Second, getting a grip on color 
requires learning only a couple 
of new terms, an unusual state of 
affairs for an endeavor that often 
seems more like high-tech 
science than art.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The rest of this chapter explains the White Balance control, plus a couple 
of other options that enable you to fine-tune the way your camera renders 
colors. For information on how to alter colors of existing pictures by using 
the software that shipped with your camera, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluores-
cent lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-
greenish light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms 
always look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially 
attractive by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a 
warm, yellow-red glow that’s flattering to the skin.
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, officially known as color tempera-
ture, on the Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. You can see an 
illustration of the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-20.
When photographers talk about “warm light” 
and “cool light,” though, they aren’t refer-
ring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or 
at least not in the way we usually think of 
temperatures, with a higher number meaning 
hotter. Instead, the terms describe the visual 
appearance of the light. Warm light, produced 
by candles and incandescent lights, falls in the 
red-yellow spectrum you see at the bottom of 
the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-20; cool light, in the 
blue-green spectrum, appears at the top of the 
scale.
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these 
fluctuating colors of light because our eyes 
automatically compensate for them. Except 
in very extreme lighting conditions, a white 
tablecloth appears white to us no matter 
whether we view it by candlelight, fluorescent 
light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through 
a feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes 
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors 
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors 
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts 
colors the opposite direction.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
The good news is that your camera’s Automatic White Balance setting, which 
carries the label AWB, tackles this process remarkably well in most situa-
tions. In some lighting conditions, though, the AWB adjustment doesn’t quite 
do the trick, resulting in an unwanted color cast like the one you see in the 
left image in Figure 6-21.
 
 
Figure 6-21: Multiple light sources can result in a color cast in Auto White 
 
Balance mode (left); try switching to manual White Balance control to solve 
 
the problem (right).
Serious AWB problems most often occur when your subject is lit by a variety 
of light sources. For example, I shot the figurine in Figure 6-21 in my home 
studio, where I use a couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten 
bulbs, which produce light with a color temperature similar to regular house-
hold incandescent bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also 
permit some pretty strong daylight to filter through. In Automatic White 
Balance mode (left), the camera reacted to that daylight — which has a cool 
color cast — and applied too much warming, giving my original image a 
yellow tint. No problem: I just switched the white balance mode from AWB 
to the Tungsten Light setting. The right image in Figure 6-21 shows the cor-
rected colors.

210
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Unfortunately, you can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection if 
you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes. So, if you spy color prob-
lems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP mode. (Chapter 5 details all five exposure modes.) You also can select 
White Balance setting in Movie mode.
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance cor-
rection; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance features.
Changing the white balance setting
You can select a specific white balance setting only in the advance exposure 
modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). To adjust the setting, you can use either of 
the following two methods:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: From the Shooting Settings screen, press Set to 
bring up the Quick Control screen. Then highlight the White Balance 
icon, found at the spot shown in Figure 6-22. The selected setting 
appears at the bottom of the screen, and you can then rotate the Main 
dial to cycle through the various options.
 
 If you want to see all the settings at once, press Set again instead of rotat-
ing the Main dial. Then you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 
6-22, and you can use the Main dial or cross keys to select your choice.
 
 On this screen, as in the Shooting Settings and Quick Control displays, 
the various White Balance settings are represented by the icons listed 
in Table 6-1. You really don’t need to memorize them, however, because 
as you scroll through the list of options, the name of the selected set-
ting appears on the screen. For some settings, the camera also displays 
the approximate Kelvin temperature (K) of the selected light source, as 
shown in the figure. (Refer to Figure 6-20 for a look at the Kelvin scale.) 
Press Set once more after you select the option you want to use.
 
 If the scene is lit by several sources, choose the setting that corre-
sponds to the strongest one. The Tungsten Light setting is usually best 
for regular incandescent household bulbs, by the way. Selecting the 
right setting for the new energy-saving CFL (compact fluorescent) bulbs 
can be a little tricky because the color temperature varies depending 
on the bulb you buy. If you have trouble, your best bet is to create a 
custom White Balance setting that’s precisely tuned to the light. See the 
next section for details.
 
✓ WB button (top cross key): Give the WB button a press to go directly to 
the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-22. Then highlight the setting 
you want to use and press Set.

Your selected White Balance setting remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, M, and 
A-DEP exposure modes until you change it again. To avoid accidentally using 
an incorrect setting later, you may want to get in the habit of resetting the 
option to the automatic setting (AWB) after you finish shooting whatever 
subject it was that caused you to switch to manual White Balance mode.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Creating a custom white balance setting
If none of the preset white balance options produces the right amount of 
color correction, you can create your own custom setting. To use this tech-
nique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral gray or absolute 
white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-but-not-perfect 
white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this purpose in many 
camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
 You can’t create a custom setting in any of the fully automatic modes. 
You can, however, select the custom setting you create when you record 
movies.
 
2. Set the white balance setting to Auto.
 
 The preceding section shows you how.
 
3. Set the camera to manual focusing and then focus on your 
reference card.
 
 Chapter 1 has details on manual focusing if you need help.
 
4. Frame the shot so that your reference card fills the center area of the 
viewfinder.
 
 In other words, make sure that at least the center autofocus point and 
the six surrounding points fall over the reference card.
 
5. Make sure that the exposure settings are correct.
 
 Just press the shutter button halfway to check exposure. In M mode, 
make sure that the exposure indicator is at the midway point of the 
exposure meter. In other modes, a blinking aperture or shutter speed 
value indicates an exposure problem. If necessary, adjust ISO, aperture, 
or shutter speed to fix the problem; Chapter 5 explains how.
 
6. Take the picture of your reference card.
 
 The camera will use this picture to establish your custom white balance 
setting.
 
7. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Custom WB, as shown on the 
left in Figure 6-23.
 
8. Press Set.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-23. The image you 
just captured should appear in the display. (The figure shows the pic-
ture I took of a gray reference card.) If not, press the right or left cross 
key to scroll to the image.

Figure 6-23: You can create a custom white balance setting through Shooting Menu 2. 
 
9. Press Set to select the displayed image as the basis for your custom 
white balance reference.
 
 You see the message shown on the left in Figure 6-24, asking you to con-
firm that you want the camera to use the image to create the custom 
white balance setting.
 
10. Press the right or left cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-24. This message 
tells you that the White Balance setting is now stored. The little icon in 
the message area represents the custom setting.
 
11. Press Set one more time to finalize the custom setting.
Your custom white balance setting remains stored until the next time you 
work your way through these steps. Anytime you’re shooting in the same 
lighting conditions and want to apply the same white balance correction, just 
press the WB button or use the Quick Control screen to access the White 
Balance settings and then select the Custom option.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Fine-tuning white balance settings
As yet another alternative for manipulating colors, your Rebel T1i/500D 
enables you to tweak white balancing in a way that shifts all colors toward a 
particular part of the color spectrum. The end result is similar to applying a 
traditional color filter to your lens.
To access this option, called White Balance Correction, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
 You can take advantage of White Balance Correction only in these 
modes.
 
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB Shift/Bkt, as shown on the 
left in Figure 6-25.
 
3. Press Set to display the screen you see on the right in Figure 6-25.
 
 The screen contains a grid that is oriented around two main color pairs: 
green and magenta (represented by the G and M labels) and blue and 
amber (represented by B and A). The little white square indicates the 
amount of white balance correction, or shift. When the square is dead 
center in the grid, as in the figure, no shift is applied.
 
 
 
Figure 6-25: White Balance Correction offers one more way to control colors.
 
4. Use the cross keys to move the square marker in the direction of the 
shift you want to achieve.
 
 As you do, the Shift area of the display tells the amount of color bias 
that you’ve selected. For example, in Figure 6-26, I shifted three levels 
toward amber and one toward magenta.

215
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 If you’re familiar with tradi-
tional lens filters, you may 
know that the density of a filter, 
which determines the degree of 
color correction it provides, is 
measured in mireds (pro-
nounced my-redds). The white 
balance grid is designed around 
this system: Moving the marker 
one level is the equivalent of 
adding a filter with a density of 
5 mireds.
 
5. Press Set to apply the change 
and return to the menu.
 
 After you apply white balance 
correction, a +/– sign appears 
next to the White Balance symbol in the Shooting Settings display, as 
shown on the left in Figure 6-27. That’s your reminder that white balance 
shift is being applied. The same symbol appears in the viewfinder, right 
next to the ISO value.
 
 You can see the exact shift values in Shooting Menu 2, as shown on the 
right in Figure 6-27, and also in the Camera Settings display. (Remember, 
to activate that display, first display any menu and then press the DISP 
button. Chapter 1 provides more details.)

 Your adjustment remains in force for all the advanced exposure modes 
until you change it. And the correction is applied no matter what White 
Balance setting you choose. Check the monitor or viewfinder before 
your next shoot; otherwise, you may forget to adjust the white balance 
for the current light.
 
6. To cancel White Balance Correction, repeat Steps 1–3, set the marker 
back to the center of the grid, and then press Set.
 
 Use the cross keys to move the marker back to the center of the grid. Be 
sure that values in the Shift area of the display are both set to 0.
 
 As an alternative, you can press the DISP button after you get to the grid 
display. However, doing so also cancels white balance bracketing, which 
I explain in the next section. After you press DISP, be sure to press Set to 
lock in your decision.
 
Many film photography enthusiasts place colored filters on their lenses to 
either warm or cool their images. Portrait photographers, for example, often 
add a warming filter to give skin tones a healthy, golden glow. You can mimic 
the effects of such filters by simply fine-tuning your camera’s White Balance 
settings as just described. Experiment with shifting the white balance a tad 
toward amber and magenta for a warming effect or toward blue and green for 
a cooling effect.
Bracketing shots with white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic exposure bracketing, 
which enables you to easily record the same image at three different expo-
sure settings. Similarly, you can take advantage of automatic White Balance 
Bracketing. With this feature, the camera records the same image three 
times, using a slightly different white balance adjustment for each.
This feature is especially helpful when you’re shooting in varying light 
sources — for example, a mix of fluorescent light, daylight, and flash. 
Bracketing the shots increases the odds that the color renditions of at least 
one of the shots will be to your liking.
 
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 
✓ Because the camera records three images each time you press the shut-
ter button, white balance bracketing reduces the maximum capture 
speed that is possible when you use the Continuous shooting mode. See 
Chapter 2 for more about Continuous mode. Of course, recording three 
images instead of one also eats up more space on your memory card.

217
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ The White Balance Bracketing feature is designed around the same grid 
used for White Balance Correction, explained in the preceding section. 
As a reminder, the grid is based on two color pairs: green/magenta and 
blue/amber.
 
✓ When White Balance Bracketing is enabled, the camera always records 
the first of the three bracketed shots using a neutral white balance set-
ting — or, at least, what it considers to be neutral, given its own mea-
surement of the light. The second and third shots are then recorded 
using the specified shift along either the green/magenta or blue/amber 
axis of the color grid.
If all that is as clear as mud, just take a look at Figure 6-28 for an example. I 
captured these images using a single tungsten studio light and the candle-
light. I set up White Balance Bracketing to work along the blue/amber color 
axis. The camera recorded the first image at neutral, the second with a 
slightly blue color bias, and the third with an amber bias.

+3 Blue bias
+3 Amber bias
Figure 6-28: I captured one neutral image, one with a blue bias, and one with an amber bias.
To enable White Balance Bracketing, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP).
 
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB/Shift Bkt.

218
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
3. Press Set to display the grid shown in Figure 6-29.
 
 The screen is the same one you see when you use the White Balance 
Correction feature, explained in the preceding section.
 
4. Rotate the Main dial to set the amount and direction of the bracketing 
shift.
 
 Rotate the dial as follows to specify whether you want the bracketing to 
be applied across the horizontal axis (blue to amber) or the vertical axis 
(green to magenta).
 
• Blue to amber bracketing: Rotate the dial right.
 
• Green to magenta bracketing: Rotate the dial left.
 
 As you rotate the dial, three markers appear on the grid, indicating the 
amount of shift that will be applied to your trio of bracketed images. You 
can apply a maximum shift of plus or minus three levels of adjustment.
 
 The BKT area of the screen also 
indicates the shift; for example, 
in Figure 6-29, the display shows 
a bracketing amount of plus and 
minus three levels on the blue/
amber axis. I used the settings 
shown in Figure 6-29 to record 
the example images in Figure 
6-28. As you can see, even at the 
maximum shift (+/– 3), the differ-
ence to the colors is subtle.
 
 If you want to get really fancy, 
you can combine White Balance 
Bracketing with White Balance 
Shift. To set the amount of White 
Balance Shift, press the cross 
keys to move the square markers 
around the grid. Then use the 
Main dial to adjust the bracketing 
setting.
 
5. Press Set to apply your changes 
and return to the menu.
 
 The bracketing symbol shown 
in Figure 6-30 appears in the 
Shooting Settings display. 
The Camera Settings display, 
which you bring up by pressing 
DISP when any menu is visible, 
also reports the bracketing 
setting.
Figure 6-29: I used these settings to capture 
the bracketed candle images.
Figure 6-30: This symbol indicates that White 
Balance Bracketing is turned on.

219
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
Your bracketing setting remains in effect until you turn off the camera. You 
can also cancel bracketing by revisiting the grid screen shown in Figure 6-29 
and either rotating the Main dial until you see only a single grid marker or 
pressing the DISP button. Either way, press Set to officially turn off bracketing.
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
Normally, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and RGB is for Red, Green, Blue, which are the primary colors in the dig-
ital imaging color world.) This color mode was created to help ensure color 
consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor and 
printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these devices 
can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger gamut (spectrum) of colors. Figure 6-31 offers an illustration 
of the two spectrums.
 
Visible Spectrum

Figure 6-31: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the
 
sRGB spectrum.

220
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Which option is right for you depends on what you plan to do with your 
photos. If you’re going to print your pictures without doing any editing to 
them, sRGB is probably the best choice because it typically results in the 
“punchy” colors that most people like. Some Internet printing services also 
request sRGB images.
On the other hand, if you’re a color purist, will be editing your photos, 
making your own prints, or all three, experiment with Adobe RGB. For the 
record, this is the route that I go because I see no reason to limit myself to 
a smaller spectrum from the get-go. However, do note that some colors in 
Adobe RGB can’t be reproduced in print; the printer substitutes the closest 
available color when necessary. Additionally, you’ll need photo software 
that offers support for Adobe RGB as well as some basic color management 
controls, which ensure that your image colors are properly handled when you 
open, print, edit, and save your files. You should plan to spend a little time 
educating yourself about color management, too, because you can muck up 
the works if you don’t set all the color-management options correctly. Long 
story short: If you’re brand new to digital imaging, this option may be one 
you explore after you get more comfortable with the whole topic.
If you do want to capture images in Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit 
Shooting Menu 2 and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-32. Press Set to display the screen shown on the right in the figure. 
Press the up or down cross key to highlight Adobe RGB and press Set again.
 
Remember that this color mode choice applies only when you shoot in the 
advanced exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. In all other modes, the 
camera automatically selects sRGB as the color space.
 
After you transfer pictures to your computer, you can tell whether you cap-
tured an image in the Adobe RGB color space by looking at its filename: 
Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in _MG_0627.jpg. Pictures 
captured in the sRGB color space start with the letter I, as in IMG_0627.jpg.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Taking a Quick Look at Picture Styles
In addition to all the focus and color features already covered in this chapter, 
your Rebel T1i/500D offers Picture Styles. Through Picture Styles, you can fur-
ther tweak color as well as saturation, contrast, and image sharpening.
 
Sharpening is a software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates 
the illusion of slightly sharper focus. I explain sharpening fully in Chapter 
10, but the important thing to note for now is that sharpening cannot 
remedy poor focus, but instead produces a subtle tweak to this aspect of 
your pictures.
The camera offers the following six basic Picture Styles:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting, this option captures the image using the 
characteristics that Canon offers as suitable for the majority of subjects. 
 
✓ Portrait: This mode reduces sharpening slightly from the amount that’s 
applied in Standard mode, with the goal of keeping skin texture soft. 
Color saturation, on the other hand, is slightly increased. If you shoot in 
the Portrait autoexposure mode, the camera automatically applies this 
Picture Style for you.
 
✓ Landscape: In a nod to traditions of landscape photography, this Picture 
Style emphasizes greens and blues and amps up color saturation and 
sharpness, resulting in bolder images. The camera automatically applies 
this Picture Style if you set the Mode dial to the Landscape autoexposure 
mode.
 
✓ Neutral: This setting reduces saturation and contrast slightly compared 
to how the camera renders images when the Standard option is selected. 
 
✓ Faithful: The Faithful style is designed to render colors as closely as 
possible to how your eye perceives them.
 
✓ Monochrome: This setting produces black-and-white photos, or, to be 
more precise, grayscale images. Technically speaking, a true black-and-
white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
 
 If you set the Quality option on Shooting Menu 1 to Raw (or Raw + Large/
Fine), the camera displays your image on the monitor in black and white 
during playback. But during the Raw converter process, you can either 
choose to go with your grayscale version or view and save a full-color 
version. Or, even better, you can process and save the image once as a 
grayscale photo and again as a color image.
 
 If you don’t capture the image in the Raw format, you can’t access the 
original image colors later. 

222
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The extent to which Picture Controls affect your image depends on the sub-
ject as well as the exposure settings you choose and the lighting conditions. 
But Figure 6-33 offers a test subject shot at each setting to give you a general 
idea of what to expect. As you can see, the differences are pretty subtle, with 
the exception of the Monochrome option, of course.

Figure 6-33: Each Picture Control produces a slightly different take on the scene.

223
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
The level of control you have over Picture Styles, like most other settings in 
this chapter, depends on your exposure mode:
 
✓ In Full Auto and the six automatic scene modes (Portrait, Landscape, 
and so on): The camera sets the Picture Style for you. (See the preced-
ing list to find out which scene mode gets which Picture Style.)
 
✓ In Creative Auto mode: You can select from four styles: Standard, 
Portrait, Landscape, and Monochrome.
 
✓ In the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP): You not 
only can select any of the six preset Picture Styles but also tweak each 
style to your liking and create up to three of your very own, customized 
styles.
 
✓ Movie mode: You can select any Picture Style, including any custom 
styles you create. (Want to shoot a black-and-white movie? Set the 
Picture Style to Monochrome before you start recording.)
For still photography you can select a Picture Style in three ways:
 
✓ Quick Control screen: Press Set to shift from the regular Shooting 
Settings display to the Quick Control screen and then highlight the 
Picture Style icon, as shown on the left in Figure 6-34. Rotate the Main 
dial to cycle through the available styles.
 
 The numbers you see along with the style name at the bottom of the 
screen represent the four characteristics applied by the style: 
Sharpness, Contrast, Saturation, and Color Tone. Sharpness values 
range from 0 to 7; the higher the value, the more sharpening is applied. 
At 0, no sharpening is applied. The other values, however, are all set to 
0, which represents the default setting for the selected Picture Style. 
(Through some advanced options, you can adjust all four settings; more 
on that momentarily.)
 
 If you want to see all the available styles, just press Set to display the 
screen you see on the right in Figure 6-34. Highlight the style you want 
to use, and the four style values appear along with the style name, as 
shown in the figure. Press Set to finish up.
 
✓ Picture Style button (bottom cross key): Press the key to display the 
same screen shown on the right in Figure 6-34. Again, just highlight your 
choice and press Set.
 
✓ Shooting Menu 2: Select the Picture Style option and press Set to display 
a menu full of all the styles. Highlight your choice and press Set again.
For movie recording, you can select a Picture Style either through Shooting 
Menu 2 or by using the Quick Control method. See Chapter 4 for help with 
the second option; it works a little differently than when you’re shooting still 
photos.

Figure 6-34: You can quickly select a Picture Style through the Quick Control screen or by 
 
pressing the bottom cross key.
This discussion of Picture Styles touches on just the very basics. Your 
camera also enables you to modify each style, varying the amount of sharp-
ness, contrast, saturation, and color tone adjustment that results from each 
style. And you can create three of your own Picture Style presets if you like.
 
Frankly, however, I recommend that you stick with the default Picture Style, 
Standard, and be done with it. First off, you have way more important camera 
settings to worry about — aperture, shutter speed, autofocus, and all the rest. 
Why add one more setting to your list, especially when the impact of changing 
it is minimal? Second, if you really want to mess with the characteristics that 
the Picture Style options affect, you’re much better off shooting in the Raw 
(CR2) format and then making those adjustments on a picture-by-picture basis 
in your Raw converter. In Canon Digital Photo Professional, which comes free 
with the camera, you can even assign any of the existing Picture Styles to your 
Raw files and then compare how each one affects the image. The camera does 
tag your Raw file with whatever Picture Style is active at the time you take the 
shot, but the image adjustments are in no way set in stone or even in sand — 
you can tweak your photo at will. (The selected Picture Style does affect the 
JPEG preview that’s used to display the Raw image thumbnails in Digital Photo 
Professional and other photo software.)
For these reasons, I’m opting in this book to present you with just this brief 
introduction to Picture Styles so that I can go into more detail about func-
tions that I see as more useful (such as the white balance customization 
options presented earlier). But if you’re intrigued, the camera manual walks 
you step by step through all the various Picture Style options.

▶ Dialing in the right settings to capture landscapes and other scenic vistas
▶ Capturing close-up views of your subject
▶ Shooting through glass, capturing fireworks, and conquering other special challenges
E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your Rebel T1i/500D, describing in detail how the various con-
trols affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter 
pulls all that information together to help you set up your camera 
for specific types of photography.
The first few pages offer a quick summary of critical 
picture-taking settings that should serve you well no 
matter what your subject. Following that, I offer my 
advice on which settings to use for portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-ups. To wrap things 
up, the end of the chapter includes some miscel-
laneous tips for dealing with special shooting situa-
tions and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as 
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or 
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own, 
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus con-
trol, to discover your own creative vision. Experimentation is 
part of the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera 
monitor and the Erase button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which set-
tings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and 
shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But 
for the many basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every 
shooting scenario. Table 7-1 shows you those recommendations and lists the 
chapter where you can find details about each setting.
 
Whether you get any say-so over these settings depends on your chosen 
exposure mode. You must use P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode if you want to 
change the White Balance setting, for example. You can find details about 
which modes let you do what in the chapters that explain each function.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically 
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the 
way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for 
every so-called rule, plenty of great images prove the exception.

227
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Shooting still portraits
By “still portrait,” I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who 
aren’t keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, 
pets, and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and 
use the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus, as shown in the examples in this section. This artistic 
choice emphasizes the subject and helps diminish the impact of any distract-
ing background objects in cases where you can’t control the setting. The fol-
lowing steps show you how to achieve this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to Av (aperture-priority autoexposure) and then 
select the lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop number opens the aperture, which 
shortens depth of field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low 
f-stop value is the first step in softening your portrait background. (The 
f-stop range available to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind 
that the farther your subject is from the background, the more back-
ground blurring you can achieve.
 
 
I recommend aperture-priority autoexposure when depth of field is a 
primary concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on 
the camera to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the 
image. Just rotate the Main dial to select your desired f-stop. But if you 
aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, give Creative 
Auto a whirl and follow the steps in Chapter 2 to request a soft-focus 
background. (You do this through the top slider that appears on the 
Shooting Settings display in Creative Auto mode.) Portrait mode also 
results in a more open aperture, although the exact f-stop setting is out 
of your control and lighting conditions will dictate how wide an aperture 
the camera will use. Chapter 2 details Portrait mode.
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current aperture and 
shutter speed both in the Shooting Settings display, as shown on the left 
in Figure 7-1, and in the viewfinder display, as shown on the right.
 
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
 
 
Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how 
people look when you view them through a security peephole in a door.

3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light rather than flash produces softer illumina-
tion and avoids the problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-
free, turn on room lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a 
sunny window.
 
 
In the Av exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed 
disables the flash. In Creative Auto mode, choose the Flash Off setting. 
(Chapter 2 shows you how.) With Portrait mode, unfortunately, you 
can’t disable the flash if the camera thinks more light is needed. Your 
only option is to change the exposure mode to No Flash, in which case 
the camera may or may not choose an aperture setting that throws the 
background into soft focus.
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to 
get better results.
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash.
 
 Even in bright daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’ 
faces, as discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated here in Figure 7-2.
 
 Unfortunately, the camera doesn’t let you use flash in Portrait mode if 
the light is very bright. In the Av exposure mode, just press the Flash 
button on the side of the camera to enable the flash. In Creative Auto 
mode, set the flash to the Flash On (fill flash) setting; again, see Chapter 
2 for a reminder of how to do so.

229
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
No flash
With flash
Figure 7-2: To properly illuminate the face in outdoor portraits, use fill flash.
 
 
In dim lighting, the camera may select a shutter speed as slow as 30 sec-
onds when you enable the built-in flash in Av mode, so keep an eye on 
that value and use a tripod if necessary to avoid blurring from camera 
shake. On the flip side of the coin, the fastest shutter speed you can use 
with the built-in flash is 1/200 second, and in extremely bright condi-
tions, that may be too slow to avoid overexposing the image. If neces-
sary, move your subject into the shade. (With some external Canon 
flashes, you can select a faster shutter speed than 1/200 second; see 
your flash manual for details.)
 
5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to engage exposure meter-
ing and, in autofocus mode, to lock in focus.
 
 Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. (In the 
viewfinder, active autofocus points turn red.) For best results, try to set 
focus on your subject’s eyes.
 
 Chapter 6 explains more about using autofocus, but if you have trouble, 
simply set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing 
ring to set focus.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.

230
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 
✓ Before pressing the shutter button, do a quick background check. 
Scan the entire frame looking for intrusive objects that may distract the 
eye from the subject. If necessary, reposition the subject against a more 
flattering backdrop if possible. Inside, a softly textured wall works well; 
outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide nice backdrops as long as they 
aren’t so ornate or colorful that they diminish the subject (for example, 
a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of 
frame sizes. Your camera produces images that have an aspect ratio of 
3:2. That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but 
will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 8 
x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and 
ambient light. If you set the White Balance setting to automatic (AWB), 
as I recommend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm 
colors to compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also 
lit by room lights or daylight, the result may be colors that are slightly 
warmer than neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in por-
traits, giving the skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the 
result or want even more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-
tune white balance. Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, Tv, 
Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient 
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing 
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning, 
however.)
 
• Try setting the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode for nighttime and 
indoor portraits. Warn your subject to expect both a light coming 
from the Red-Eye Reduction lamp, which constricts pupils, and the 
actual flash. See Chapter 2 for details about using this flash mode, 
which you enable through Shooting Menu 1.
 
• For nighttime pictures, try Night Portrait mode. In this autoexposure 
mode, the camera automatically selects a slower shutter speed 
than normal. This enables the camera to soak up more ambient 
light, producing a brighter background and reducing the flash 
power that’s needed to light the subject. A slow shutter, however, 
means that you need to use a tripod to avoid camera shake, which 
can blur the photo. You also need to warn your subjects to remain 
very still during the exposure.

231
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. 
An external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase 
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two por-
traits in Figure 7-3 for an illustration. In the first example, the 
built-in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and 
harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on the 
right, I used the Canon Speedlite 580EX II and bounced the light off 
the ceiling.
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from 
the background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure 
7-3. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also 
softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of 
field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.

• Study the flash information in Chapter 5, and practice before you 
need to take important portraits. How the camera calculates the 
aperture, shutter speed, and flash power needed to expose your 
subject and background varies depending on the exposure mode 
you use. So to fully understand how to get the flash results you 
want, it pays to experiment with each of the advanced exposure 
modes, all covered in Chapter 5.
 
 
For the maximum control over aperture, shutter speed, and flash 
power, try working in Manual exposure mode and make friends 
with the Flash Compensation and FE Lock (flash exposure lock) 
features.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s a spinning Ferris wheel, a butterfly flitting from flower 
to flower, or in the case of Figures 7-4 and 7-5, a hockey-playing teen. In the 
first image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow to catch the sub-
ject without blur. For this subject, who was moving at a fairly rapid speed, I 
needed to bump the shutter speed all the way up to 1/1000 second to freeze 
the action cleanly, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 
Figure 7-4: A too-slow shutter speed (1/125 second) causes the skater to 
 
appear blurry.

233
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 
Figure 7-5: Raising the shutter speed to 1/1000 second “froze” the action.
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, I use the tech-
niques in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care 
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
 
 If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced autoexposure mode, 
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But 
be aware that you have no control over any other aspects of your pic-
ture (such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.
 
2. Rotate the Main dial to select the shutter speed.
 
 
In the Shooting Settings display, the option that appears highlighted, 
with the little arrow pointers at each side, is the one that you can adjust 
with the Main dial. In Tv mode, the shutter speed is the active option. 
After you select the shutter speed, the camera selects the aperture 
(f-stop) necessary to produce a good exposure.
 
 What shutter speed you need depends on how fast your subject is 
moving, so some experimentation is needed. But generally speaking, 
1/500 second should be plenty for all but the fastest subjects — speed-
ing hockey players like my subject, race cars, boats, and so on. For 
slower subjects, you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.

234
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 If the aperture value blinks after you set the shutter speed, the camera 
can’t select an f-stop that will properly expose the photo at that shutter 
speed. See Chapter 5 for more details about how the camera notifies you 
of potential exposure problems.
 
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure if 
needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure at your 
chosen shutter speed without taking this step. Raising the ISO does 
increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a blurry 
shot. (The current ISO setting appears in the upper right corner of the 
Shooting Settings display, as shown in Figure 7-6; press the ISO button or 
use the Quick Control screen to adjust the setting.)
 
 Note that in Sports mode, the camera automatically overrides your ISO 
setting if it deems necessary, but it can go only as high as ISO 1600. If you 
stick with Tv mode and raise the ISO above 800 or so, you may want to 
enable High ISO Speed Noise Reduction to help alleviate noise. However, 
doing so can slow down the speed at which you can capture images, so 
it’s a bit of a tradeoff. For more on all these ISO issues, see Chapter 5.
 
 
Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash 
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited 
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And 
third, remember that the fastest possible shutter speed when you 
enable the built-in flash is 1/200 second, which may not be fast enough 
to capture a quickly moving subject without blur. (You can use a faster 
shutter speed with some Canon external flash units.) For more on this 
issue, check out Chapter 5.
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode; it 
doesn’t permit you to use flash.
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, 
set the Drive mode to 
Continuous.
 
 In this mode, you can take 
a little more than three pic-
tures per second. The camera 
continues to record images 
as long as the shutter button 
is pressed. You can switch 
the Drive mode by pressing 
the left cross key or using 
the Quick Control screen. 
The icon representing the 
current mode appears in the 
Shooting Settings display, as 
labeled in Figure 7-6.

Figure 7-6: Changing the Drive mode to

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 You then eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in autofocus 
mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you need help.
 
 If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
 
 
• Set the AF Point Selection mode to Automatic. Press the button 
shown in the margin to adjust this setting.
 
 
• Set the AF (autofocus) mode to AI Servo (continuous-servo autofo-
cus). Press the right cross key or use the Quick Control screen to 
access this setting. The name of the current setting in the Shooting 
Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
 Chapter 6 details these autofocus options.
 
6. Turn off automatic image review to speed up the camera even more.
 
 You do this via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1. Turning 
the option off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover 
between shots.
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 You can always crop the photo later to a tighter composition. (I did 
so for my example images, which originally contained quite a bit more 
background than you see in the book.) Chapter 10 shows you how to 
crop pictures.
 
8. Lock in autofocus (if used) in advance.
 
 Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the action occurs, 
just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your image-capture 
time is faster because the camera has already done the work of estab-
lishing focus. Remember that in AI Servo mode, you must keep the 
subject under the active autofocus point (or points) for the camera to 
maintain focus. Again, Chapter 6 details this feature.
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting 
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change 
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set 
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast as 
you can.

236
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of 
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for 
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to 
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while 
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority autoexpo-
sure mode (Av) so that you can control 
depth of field. If you want extreme 
depth of field, so that both near and 
distant objects are sharply focused, as 
in Figure 7-7, select a high f-stop value. I 
used an aperture of f/16 for this shot.
 
 As an alternative to Av mode, you can 
try Creative Auto mode and then use 
the slider on the Quick Control screen 
to request an aperture that will pro-
duce a larger depth of field. Landscape 
mode also tries to produce a large 
depth of field by selecting a high f-stop 
number, but you have no control over 
the exact value (or any other picture-
taking settings). 
 
 Of course, if the light is dim, the 
camera may be forced to open the 
aperture in either Creative Auto or 
Landscape mode, reducing depth of 
field, to properly expose the image. 
(Don’t confuse Landscape autoexpo-
sure mode with the Landscape Picture 
Style, by the way; the Landscape exposure mode you want is the one 
you select from the Mode dial on top of the camera. See Chapter 6 for 
more details about Picture Styles.)
Figure 7-7: Use a high f-stop value (or 
Landscape mode) to keep foreground 
and background sharply focused.

237
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow shutter, use a tripod to avoid blurring. 
The downside to a high f-stop is that you need a slower shutter speed 
to produce a good exposure. If the shutter speed drops below what you 
can comfortably handhold, use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring camera 
shake. No tripod handy? Look for any solid surface on which you can 
steady the camera. You can always increase the ISO setting to increase 
light sensitivity, which in turn allows a faster shutter speed, too, but that 
option brings with it the chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 
5 for details. Also see Chapter 1 for details about image stabilization, 
which can help you get sharper handheld shots at slow shutter speeds.
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall and foun- 
tain shots, consider using a slow 
shutter to create that “misty” look. 
The slow shutter blurs the water, 
giving it a soft, romantic appearance. 
Figure 7-8 shows a close-up of this 
effect. Again, use a tripod to ensure 
that the rest of the scene doesn’t 
also blur due to camera shake.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base exposure 
on the sky. The foreground will be 
dark, but you can usually brighten 
it in a photo editor if needed. If you 
base exposure on the foreground, on 
the other hand, the sky will become 
so bright that all the color will be 
washed out — a problem you usu-
ally can’t fix after the fact.
 
 
This tip doesn’t apply, of course, 
if your sunrise or sunset is merely 
serving as a gorgeous backdrop for 
a portrait. In that case, you should 
enable your flash and expose for the 
subject.
  
 In the advanced exposure modes, you also can experiment with enabling 
the Highlight Tone Priority option, which you do via Custom Function 
6, on Setup Menu 3. This feature can help you retain some additional 
shadow detail without blowing out highlights. Chapter 5 offers more 
information.
Figure 7-8: For misty waterfalls, use a 
slow shutter speed (and tripod).

238
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experi-
ment with slow shutter. Assuming 
cars or other vehicles are moving 
through the scene, the result is neon 
trails of light like those you see in 
Figure 7-9. Shutter speed for this 
image was 10 seconds. The longer 
your shutter speed, the blurrier the 
motion trails become.
 
 
Instead of changing the shutter speed 
manually between each shot, try set-
ting the speed to Bulb. Available only 
in M (manual) exposure mode, this 
option records an image for as long as 
you hold down the shutter button. So 
just take a series of images, holding 
the button down for different lengths 
of time for each shot. In Bulb mode, 
you also can exceed the minimum 
(slowest) shutter speed of 30 seconds. 
Note that in Bulb mode, the camera 
displays the elapsed capture time on 
the monitor. (The viewfinder is dark 
while the shutter is open.)
 
 Because long exposures can produce 
image noise, you also may want to 
enable the Long Exposure Noise 
Reduction feature. You access this option via the Custom Function 
option on Setup Menu 3; select Custom Function 4 and change the set-
ting from Off to Auto or On. Chapter 5 discusses this option in more 
detail.
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term 
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light 
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently 
warmed look.
 
 
Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s white balance set-
ting, using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour 
light.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket shots. Bracketing simply means to take the same 
picture at several different exposures to increase the odds that at least 
one of them captures the scene the way you envision. Bracketing is 
especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such as sunrise and 
sunset.
Figure 7-9: A slow shutter also creates 
neon light trails in city-street scenes.

239
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 
Your camera offers automatic exposure bracketing when you shoot in 
the advanced exposure modes. See Chapter 5 to find out how to take 
advantage of this feature.
 
 Also experiment with the Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone 
Priority options; capture some images with the features enabled and 
then take the same shots with the features turned off. You control both 
options through the Custom Functions options on Setup Menu 3; see 
Chapter 5 for details.
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, start with the basic capture settings outlined in 
Table 7-1. Then try the following additional settings and techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your lens. How “up close and personal” you can get to your 
subject depends on your lens, not the camera body. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of field 
by setting the camera mode to Av 
(aperture-priority autoexposure) 
mode. Whether you want a shal-
low, medium, or extreme depth of 
field depends on the point of your 
photo. For the romantic scene 
shown in Figure 7-10, for example, 
I wanted to blur the background to 
help the subjects stand out more, 
so I set the aperture to f/5.6. But if 
you want the viewer to clearly see 
all details throughout the frame — 
for example, if you’re shooting a 
product shot for your company’s 
sales catalog — you need to go the 
other direction, stopping down the 
aperture as far as possible.
 
 
Not ready for the advanced expo-
sure modes yet? Try Creative Auto 
mode and follow the directions in 
Chapter 2 to set the Background 
slider to the “blurry” end of the 
scale. You also can try the Close-Up 
scene mode instead. (It’s the one 
marked with the little flower on your Mode dial.) In this mode, the 
camera automatically opens the aperture to achieve a short depth of 
field and bases focus on the center of the frame. Creative Auto, however, 
enables you to control a few aspects of your photo that you can’t adjust 
in Close-Up mode, the most important of which is whether the flash fires.
Figure 7-10: Shallow depth of field helps 
set the subject apart from the similarly 
colored background.

240
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Remember that both zooming in and getting close to your subject 
decreases depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth 
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may 
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image 
to show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject 
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. (Chapter 5 offers some 
examples that illustrate this issue.)
 
✓ Use fill flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny bit 
of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary light 
source. You may need to reduce the flash output slightly, via the camera’s 
Flash Exposure Compensation control. Chapter 5 offers details about 
using flash.
 
 Also keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed possible when you use 
the built-in flash is 1/200 second. So in very bright light, you may need to 
use a high f-stop setting to avoid overexposing the picture. You also can 
lower the ISO speed setting, if it’s not already all the way down to ISO 100.
 
 
You can’t control whether the flash fires in Close-Up mode, so if flash is 
an issue, use either Av or Creative Auto mode.
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light 
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your 
flash may be too harsh even at a low Flash Exposure Compensation set-
ting. If flash is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to 
reduce the flash power that’s needed — even a hardware store shop 
light can do in a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have 
multiple light sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance 
setting.)
 
 Again, if you don’t want to use one of the advanced exposure modes, 
Creative Auto lets you determine whether the flash fires. See Chapter 2 
for the lowdown.
 
✓ To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of 
diopters. A true macro lens, which enables you to get really, really close 
to your subjects, is an expensive proposition; expect to pay around $200 
or more. But if you enjoy capturing the tiny details in life, it’s worth the 
investment. 
 
 For a less expensive way to go, you can spend about $40 for a set of 
diopters, which are sort of like reading glasses that you screw onto your 
existing lens. Diopters come in several strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number indicating a greater magnifying power. I took 
this approach to capture the rose in Figure 7-11. The left image shows you 
the closest I could get to the subject with my regular lens; to produce the 
right image, I attached a +6 diopter. The downfall of diopters, sadly, is that 
they typically produce images that are very soft around the edges, as in 
Figure 7-11 — a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.

Figure 7-11: To extend your lens’s close-focus ability, you can add magnifying diopters.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not 
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick 
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To 
capture subjects that are 
behind glass, try putting your 
lens flat against the glass. Use 
manual focusing; the glass 
barrier can give the autofocus 
mechanism fits. Disable your 
flash to avoid creating any 
unwanted reflections, too. I 
used this technique to capture 
the image of the turtle sticking 
his neck out in Figure 7-12.
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: 
Set the camera to shutter-
priority autoexposure or 
manual mode and dial in a fast 
shutter speed to compensate 
for the movement of the car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your camera. 
Figure 7-12: To shoot through glass, place your 
lens flat against the glass.

242
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Shooting in strong backlighting: When the light behind your subject 
is very strong and illuminating the subject with flash isn’t an option, 
you can expose the image with the subject in mind, in which case the 
background may be overexposed. (Turning on Highlight Tone Priority, 
an advanced exposure option discussed in Chapter 5, may enable you to 
keep some highlights from blowing out, however.)
 
 As an alternative, you can expose for the background, and purposely 
underexpose the subject to create a silhouette effect. I opted for this 
technique when capturing the image in Figure 7-13, which shows a 
young friend standing mesmerized in front of an aquarium. Be sure to 
disable your flash, Highlight Tone Priority, and Auto Lighting Optimizer 
when trying to shoot silhouettes. (You need to shoot in an advanced 
mode to control these options.)
 
Figure 7-13: Experiment with shooting backlit subjects in silhouette.
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. 
If using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. Switch to 
manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point possi-
ble on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, choose a relatively 
high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start with a shutter speed of 
1 to 3 seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with 
different shutter speeds.
 
 
Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very 
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur 
the image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your 
camera, this is a good situation in which to use it.

243
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 You also may want to enable your camera’s Long Exposure Noise 
Reduction feature because a long exposure also increases the chances 
of noise defects. See Chapter 5 for details. (Keep the ISO setting low to 
further dampen noise.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, 
you can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal 
by using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $60. A 
polarizing filter can also help when you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and your 
camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a certain 
angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must also reflect 
off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, a polarizing 
filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, which may or may 
not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing filter isn’t a surefire 
cure-all.
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent, such as the ones shown in Figure 7-14, from 
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com), 
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and 
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a 
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200, 
depending on size and features.

You have a memory card full of pictures. Now 
what? Now you turn to the ﬁ rst chapter in 
this part, which explains how to get those pictures 
out of your camera and onto your computer and, 
just as important, how to safeguard them from

Archiving Your Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using the free Canon software to download and organize photos
▶ Processing Raw (CR2) files
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping 
track of all those image files is one of the more confusing aspects of the 
art form. In fact, students in my classes have more questions 
about this subject than just about anything else.
Frankly, writing about the download and organizing 
process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!) 
The problem is that providing you with detailed 
instructions is pretty much impossible because the 
steps you need to take vary widely depending upon 
what software you have installed on your computer 
and whether you use a Windows or Macintosh 
operating system.
To give you as much help as possible, however, 
this chapter shows you how to transfer and organize 
pictures using the free software that came with your 
camera. After exploring these discussions, you should be 
able to adapt the steps to any other photo program you may 
prefer.
This chapter also covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files, 
including converting pictures taken in the Raw format to a standard image 
format. Finally — and perhaps most importantly — this chapter explains how 
to ensure that your digital images stay safe after they leave the camera.

248
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, 
you need to dig out the USB 
cable that came with your 
camera. (Your camera manual 
refers to this cable as the inter-
face cable.) The cable has a reg-
ular USB plug like the one shown 
in Figure 8-1 at one end and a 
tiny, camera-specific plug at the 
other. Your computer must also 
have a free USB slot, or port, in 
techie talk. If you aren’t sure 
what these gadgets look like, 
Figure 8-1 gives you a look.
 
 
The little three-pronged icon 
you see on the plug and to the 
left of the two ports in Figure 8-1 
is the universal symbol for USB. 
Be sure to check for this symbol because a different type of slot — a 
FireWire slot — looks very similar to a USB slot, and your USB cable can 
even seem to fit (sort of) into a FireWire slot.
 
✓ Transfer images via memory card reader. Many computers now also 
have built-in memory card readers. If yours has one that accepts a 
Secure Digital (SD) card, you can simply pop the memory card out of 
your camera and into the card reader instead of hooking the camera 
up to the computer. Note: If you’re using the new SDHC (high capacity) 
cards, the reader must specifically support that type.
 
 As another option, you can buy stand-alone card readers, such as the 
SanDisk model shown in Figure 8-2. Card readers range anywhere from 
$5 to $35, depending on whether they accept only a single type of card 
or, as with this SanDisk model, a variety of memory cards. Check your 
photo printer, too; many printers now have card readers that accept the 
most popular types of memory cards.
 
I prefer to use a card reader instead of via the camera, for three reasons:
 
✓ With a card reader, I don’t waste camera battery power. (For camera trans-
fers, the camera must be powered up during the entire download process.)
 
✓ I don’t have to keep track of that elusive USB camera cable.
USB symbol

computer with the supplied USB cable.

249
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
✓ I don’t have to get down on 
all fours to plug the camera 
cable into the computer’s 
USB slot, which is (of course) 
located in the least convenient 
spot possible.
 
 The card reader, by con-
trast, stays perched on my 
desk, connected to my com-
puter at all times, so there’s 
very little physical activity 
involved in transferring pic-
tures, which is how I prefer 
to live my life.
If you want to transfer directly 
from the camera, however, the 
next section explains some 
important steps you need to take 
to make that option work. If you 
choose to use a card reader, skip 
ahead to the section “Starting the 
transfer process” for an overview 
of what happens after you insert 
the card into the reader.
Connecting camera and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that for the process to work smoothly, Canon suggests that your 
computer is running one of the following operating systems:
 
✓ Windows Vista
 
✓ Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2)
 
✓ Mac OS X 10.4 and higher
If you use another OS (operating system, in case you’re a non-geek), check 
the support pages on the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) for the latest 
news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always simply 
transfer images with a card reader, too.

With that preamble out of the way, the next steps show you how to get your 
camera to talk to your computer:
 
1. Assess the level of the camera battery.
 
 
Just look at the little battery-status indicator at the bottom of the Shooting 
Settings display. If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running 
out of battery power during the transfer process can cause problems, 
including lost picture data. Alternatively, if you have an optional AC 
adapter, use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. If your computer isn’t already on, turn it on and give it time to finish 
its normal startup routine.
 
3. Make sure that the camera is turned off.
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two 
plugs on the USB cable into 
the A/V Out/Digital port on the 
side of the camera.
 
 This port is hidden under a little 
rubber door, just around the 
corner from the buttons that 
flank the left side of the monitor, 
as shown in Figure 8-3. Gently 
pry open the little door and 
insert the cable end into the 
slot.
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable 
into the computer’s USB port.
 
 
It’s best to plug the cable into a 
port that’s actually built into the 
computer, as opposed to one 
that’s on your keyboard or part 
of an external USB hub. Those 
accessory-type connections can 
sometimes foul up the transfer 
process.
 
6. Set the Mode dial on top of the 
camera to any exposure mode 
but Movie mode.
 
 
This step is essential; otherwise, 
the download process won’t 
work.
 
7. Turn on the camera.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
 The Shooting Settings screen appears briefly on the camera monitor, 
displaying a “Busy” message. Then the monitor goes black, and the card 
access lamp (just to the right of the Erase button) begins flickering, let-
ting you know that the camera is communicating with the computer. 
After a few moments, a Direct Transfer screen appears on the camera 
monitor (you can just ignore it) and the center of the Print/Share light, 
better known as the Live View button, glows blue.
 
 For details about the next step in the downloading routine, move on to 
the next section.
 
The options you see on the Direct Transfer screen relate to a method of 
image downloading that requires you to handle everything through the 
camera menus. I don’t cover this download technique because I think most 
people will find the alternative methods I discuss here easier and more user-
friendly. Nor do I cover the Transfer Order item on the Playback menu, which 
is related to the process. Your camera manual also includes specifics about 
the other download technique.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on 
the software installed on your computer 
and the OS (operating system) it runs.
Here are the most common possibilities 
and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, a 
Windows dialog box (like the one 
in Figure 8-4) appears. (The figure 
features the Windows Vista version of 
the dialog box.) This dialog box sug-
gests different programs that you can 
use to download your picture files. 
Which programs appear depends 
upon what you have installed on your 
system; if you installed the Canon 
software, for example, one or more of 
those programs should appear in the 
list. To proceed, just click the trans-
fer program that you want to use.
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this 
initial boxful of transfer options.

252
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a long, 
healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 ✓ Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive 
for long-term, archival storage. Hard drives 
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in 
the process. This warning applies to both 
internal and external hard drives. At the 
very least, having a dual-drive backup is in 
order — you might keep one copy of your 
photos on your computer’s internal drive 
and another on an external drive. If one 
breaks, you still have all your goodies on 
the other one. Also try to use that second 
drive only for image storage; assuming that 
you’re not accessing the files every day, 
this minimizes the run time of the hard drive, 
which should translate to a longer life span 
(although it’s not guaranteed). Don’t forget 
that if your computer is a portable one, you 
have to consider the extra risk of theft of 
your images as well.
 ✓ Camera memory cards, flash memory 
keys, and other portable storage devices 
are similarly risky. All are easily damaged 
if dropped or otherwise mishandled. And 
being of diminutive stature, these portable 
storage options also are easily lost.
 ✓ The best way to store important files is 
to copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The 
label should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look 
for brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing and are advertised as archival quality, 
which offers a higher level of security than 
other coatings.
 ✓ Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of 
holding lots more data than a CD. However, 
as of today, the industry still hasn’t settled 
on a single, standard DVD format, and the 
archival-level gold coating isn’t available 
for all those formats. For those reasons, I’m 
not quite as comfortable with DVDs as I am 
with CDs. So I use DVDs only for noncritical 
images; precious family photos go on CDs.
 ✓ For a double backup, you may want to check 
into online storage services, such as Mozy 
(www.mozy.com) and IDrive (www.idrive.
com). You pay a monthly subscription fee 
to back up your important files to the site’s 
servers. 
 
 Note, though, the critical phrase here: 
double backup. Online storage sites have 
a troubling history of closing down sud-
denly, taking all their customers’ data with 
them. (One extremely alarming case in point 
was the closure of a photography-oriented 
storage site called Digital Railroad, which 
gave clients a mere 24-hours notice before 
destroying their files.) So anything you store 
online should be also stored on DVD or CD 
and kept in your home or office. Also note 
that photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, 
Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t designed 
to be long-term storage tanks for your 
images. Usually, you get access to only a 
small amount of file storage space, and the 
site may require you to purchase prints or 
other photo products periodically to main-
tain your account.
 
 If you want to use the same program for all your transfers, select the 
Always Do This for This Device check box, as I did in Figure 8-4. (The 
check box has a slightly different name in other versions of Windows.) 
The next time you connect your camera or insert a memory card, 

253
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Windows automatically launches your program of choice instead of dis-
playing the dialog box with the choices.
 
✓ An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download 
wizard. For example, if you installed the Canon software, the EOS Utility 
window or MemoryCard Utility window may leap to the forefront. Or, 
if you installed some other program, such as Photoshop Elements, its 
downloader may pop up instead. On a Mac, the built-in iPhoto software 
may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.apple.com, 
offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
 
 Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software 
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your 
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from 
the previous program.
 
 
If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn off that feature. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or 
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone — maybe 
even you — simply may have disabled all the automatic downloaders 
on your system. Just launch your photo software and then transfer your 
pictures using whatever command starts that process. (I show you how 
to do it with the Canon software tools later in the chapter; for other pro-
grams, consult the software manual.)
 
 As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to 
simply drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s 
hard drive. The process is exactly the same as when you move any other 
file from a CD, DVD, or other storage device onto your hard drive.
As I say in the introduction to this chapter, it’s impossible to give step-by-
step instructions for using all the various photo downloaders that may be 
sprinkled over your hard drive. So in the next sections, I provide details on 
using Canon software to download and organize your files.
If you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply opening the Help menu.
Downloading images with Canon tools
 
The software CD that shipped with your Rebel T1i/500D includes several pro-
grams for transferring, organizing, and editing your photos. For downloading 
images, I suggest that you use the tools discussed in the next two sections.

254
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Before you try the download steps, however, you may want to visit the Canon 
Web site and download the latest versions of the software in the suite. Even if 
you recently bought your camera, the shipping CD may be a little out of date. 
Just go to www.canon.com and follow the links to locate the software for 
your camera. (You can also download updated manuals.)
 
In this book, the steps relate to version 2.6.1 of the EOS Utility and version 6.3 
for ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). As I write this, 
those versions are the most recent available.
After taking care of the software download and installation chores, see the 
next two sections for details on how to transfer your images.
Using EOS Utility to transfer images from your camera
Follow these steps to transfer images directly from your camera to the com-
puter using the Canon EOS Utility software:
 
1. Connect your camera (turned off) to the computer.
 
 See the first part of this chapter for specifics.
 
2. Turn on the camera.
 
 After a few moments, the EOS Utility window should appear automati-
cally. If it doesn’t, just launch the program as you would any other on 
your system. Figure 8-5 shows the Windows Vista version of the screen; 
the Mac version looks pretty much the same.
 
 
 Figure 8-5: EOS Utility is designed for sending pictures from 
the camera to the computer.

255
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
3. Click the Lets You Select and Download Images option, as shown in 
the figure.
 
 With this option, you can specify which pictures you want to download 
from the camera. After you click the option, you see a browser window 
that looks similar to the one in Figure 8-6, with thumbnails of the images 
currently on your card. The figure shows the Windows version, but the 
Mac version contains the same components. Click the magnifying glass 
icons in the lower-right corner of the window to enlarge or reduce the 
thumbnail size.
 
4. Select the images that you want to copy to the computer.
 
 In Windows, each thumbnail contains a check box in its lower-left corner. 
To select an image for downloading, click the box to put a check mark in 
it. On the Mac, there are no check boxes; instead, click the image 
thumbnail to highlight it.
 
 
For a quick way to select all images, press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A 
(Mac). Or choose Edit➪Select Image➪Select All.
 
5. Click the Download button at the bottom of the window.
 
 A screen appears that tells you where the program wants to store your 
downloaded pictures. Figure 8-7 shows the Windows version of this 
notice; the Mac version contains the same options.
 
 
Figure 8-6: Select the thumbnails of the images you want to transfer.

256
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 8-7: You can specify where you want to store 
 
the photos.
 
 
By default, pictures are stored in the Pictures or My Pictures folder in 
Windows (depending on the version of Windows you use) and in the 
Pictures folder on a Mac. You can put your images anywhere you like; 
however, most photo editing programs look first for photos in those 
folders, so sticking with this universally accepted setup makes some 
sense.
 
6. Verify or change the storage location for your pictures.
 
 If you want to put the pictures in a location different from what the 
program suggests, click the Destination Folder button and specify the 
storage location and folder name you prefer. You also can choose to 
have the picture files renamed when they’re copied; click the File Name 
button to access the renaming options.
 
7. Click OK to begin the download.
 
 A progress window appears, showing you the status of the download.
 
8. When the download is complete, turn off the camera.
 
 You can safely remove the cable connecting it to the computer.
That’s the basic process, but I need to share a couple of fine points:
 
✓ Setting download preferences: While the camera is still connected and 
turned on, you can click the Preferences button at the bottom of the 
EOS Utility browser (refer to Figure 8-6) to open a dialog box where you 
can specify many aspects of how the transfer program works. Figure 8-8 
shows the Windows version; Figure 8-9, the Mac version.
 
 In Windows, click the tabs at the top of the Preferences dialog box to 
reveal all your options. (You may need to use the scroll arrows at the 
right side of the tabs to access hidden tabs.) On a Mac, display the vari-
ous panels by choosing them from the drop-down list at the top of the 
dialog box.

257
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
 
 Figure 8-8: In Windows, click the tabs at the top of the window 
to access download options.
 
 
 Figure 8-9: On a Mac, select a panel of options from the 
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box.
 
✓ Auto-launching the other Canon programs: After the download is com-
plete, the EOS Utility may automatically launch Canon Digital Photo 
Professional or ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) so 
that you can immediately start working with your pictures. (You must 
have installed the programs for this to occur.)

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 If you want to change the program that’s launched, visit the Linked 
Software panel of the EOS Utility’s Preferences dialog box. You then can 
select the program that you want to use or choose None to disable auto-
launch altogether.
 
✓ Closing the EOS Utility: The utility browser window doesn’t close auto-
matically after the download is complete. So you must return to it and 
click the Quit button to shut it down. (Refer to Figure 8-6.)
Using MemoryCard Utility for card-to-computer transfers
Transferring images from a memory card reader involves a different Canon 
tool, MemoryCard Utility. This tool is actually a component of ZoomBrowser 
EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). To try it out, take these steps:
 
1. Put your card in your card reader.
 
 If all the planets are aligned — meaning that the Canon software was the 
last photo software you installed, and some other program doesn’t try 
to handle the job for you — the MemoryCard Utility window shown in 
Figure 8-10 appears automatically when you put your memory card into 
the card reader. The figure shows the Windows version of the window; 
the Mac version is identical except that the top of the window refers to 
ImageBrowser, which is the Mac version of ZoomBrowser EX.
 
 
 Figure 8-10: MemoryCard Utility enables you to transfer 
pictures using a card reader.
 
 If the window doesn’t appear, you can access it as follows:
 
• Windows: Open the program called ZoomBrowser EX MemoryCard 
Utility, using the steps you usually take to start a program.
 
• Mac: Start the program called Canon Camera Window. The 
program should detect your memory card and display the 
MemoryCard Utility window.

259
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
2. Click the Lets You Select and Download Images option.
 
 You then see the browser window shown in Figure 8-11. The figure shows 
the Windows version; the Mac version contains the same basic components 
but follows conventional Mac design rules. Either way, thumbnails of the 
images on your memory card are displayed in the window.
 
 
Figure 8-11: Select images to download from the browser window.
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
• To select the first photo, click its thumbnail.
 
• To select additional pictures, Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click (Mac) 
their thumbnails.
 
• To quickly select all images, press Ctrl+A in Windows or Ô+A on a 
Mac. Or, depending on your OS, do the following:
 
 Windows: Choose Select All from the Select drop-down list, 
located on the toolbar near the top of the window.
 
 Mac: Choose Select All from the Select Image list, located at the 
bottom of the window.
 
4. Click the Image Download button.
 
 In Windows, the button is near the top-left corner of the browser 
window. On a Mac, it’s in the bottom-left corner (and for whatever 
reason, named Download Images instead of Image Download).
 
 Either way, a new window appears to show you where the downloader 
wants to put your files and the name it plans to assign the storage folder, 
as shown in Figure 8-12.

260
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 If you’re not happy with the 
program’s choices, click the 
Change Settings button to open 
a dialog box where you can 
select a different storage loca-
tion. In the same dialog box, 
you can also choose to have 
the files renamed when they’re 
copied. Click OK to close the 
Change Settings dialog box 
when you finish.
 
 
Most programs look first for 
photos stored in the loca-
tion suggested initially by 
the downloader. In Windows, 
that folder is either Pictures 
or My Pictures, depending on 
what version of Windows you 
use. On a Mac, the folder is 
Pictures. Sticking with these 
default storage locations can simplify your life down the road, but of 
course, you’re free to set up whatever image-organization system works 
best for you.
 
5. Click the Starts Download button.
 
 Your files start making their way to your computer. When the down-
load is finished, the MemoryCard Utility window closes, and either 
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) appears, display-
ing your downloaded files. See the next section for details on using that 
program.
Using ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
In addition to the aforementioned software tools, your Canon CD contains two 
additional programs: ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac), 
plus Digital Photo Professional. In this section, you find out how to organize 
your photos using the ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser tool. The upcoming sec-
tion, “Processing Raw (CR2) Files,” introduces you to Digital Photo Professional, 
which you can use to process photos you shoot in the Raw format. You can 
also browse and organize your photos in that program if you prefer. However, I 
think that most beginners will find ZoomBrowser and ImageBrowser easier to 
use. These programs also offer the simple photo-editing tools that I cover in 
Chapter 10.
The next sections give you the most basic of introductions to ZoomBrowser 
EX/ImageBrowser, which, in the interest of saving type, I may refer to from 
Figure 8-12: Click the Change Settings button 
to specify a different download folder.

261
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
here on in as just “the browser.” If you want more details, the CD that ships 
with the program offers a very good online manual.
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use Canon’s software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, 
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your 
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file 
that you put on your system.
Getting acquainted with the program
Figure 8-13 offers a look at the ZoomBrowser EX window; Figure 8-14 shows the 
ImageBrowser window. As you can see, both windows contain most of the same 
basic components although the Mac version of the browser is lacking the 
row of task buttons found in the upper-left corner of the Windows version. 
The two versions also offer a different set of image-viewing modes — Zoom, 
Scroll, and Preview modes in Windows; Preview and List modes on the Mac.

Figure 8-14: Click a thumbnail to view that image in the main preview area.
Whichever version you use, you can customize the window layout via the 
View menu. The arrangement you see in the figures is the Preview mode 
setup. I prefer this mode because it provides easy access not just to your 
images, but also to details about the camera settings you used to shoot the 
picture. Note that in Windows, you can display and hide the Explore and 
Information panels by clicking the little vertical buttons that border the 
preview area (the “Information panel” label in Figure 8-13 points to one of 
the little guys). On a Mac, choose View➪View Settings to display a submenu 
where you can toggle the panels on and off.
Here’s a quick guide to viewing your photos in Preview mode:
 
✓ Select the folder you want to view. Click the folder’s icon in the Explore 
panel, found on the left side of the window and labeled in Figures 8-13 
and 8-14. If you click the Favorite Folders tab, you see only the Pictures 
or My Pictures folders (Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac) along with 
any custom Favorites folders that you create, a topic that you can visit 

263
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
in the upcoming section “Organizing your photos.” By default, picture 
files that you transfer from your camera or memory card using the 
Canon software go into these folders. To view all folders on your 
computer, click the All Folders button.
 
✓ Preview the images in the selected folder. In Preview mode, the cur-
rent image appears at a large size in the middle of the window, as shown 
in the figures, and a filmstrip of smaller thumbnails appears beneath.
 
 To view the next image in the filmstrip, click its thumbnail. On a Mac, 
you then can press the right- and left-arrow keys on your keyboard to 
view your photos one by one. In Windows, the same technique works 
on some keyboards; if not, click the Next and Previous buttons (under 
the large preview) instead. Drag the scroll bar under the thumbnails to 
scroll the thumbnail display as needed.
 
✓ View an image in full-screen mode. For a larger view of a photo, double-
click its thumbnail. (You must double-click the thumbnail, not the larger 
preview image.) Doing so opens the image in its own browser window, 
displaying the image as large as possible to fit the available screen 
space. This full-screen window is the Viewer window. The next section 
explains more about the controls therein. To exit the Viewer window 
and return to the main browser, just click the window’s Close button.
 
✓ View shooting information. Check out the Information panel, located 
on the right side of the window. If you click the Shooting Information 
button, you display all the settings that you used to capture the selected 
image, as shown in Figures 8-13 and 8-14. Reviewing this data — known 
as metadata — is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just get-
ting up to speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all 
the other digital photography basics. Note: You may need to scroll the 
Information panel display to access the Shooting Information button, 
depending on the size of the program window.
Those are the basics of navigating through your images. In the next section, 
you can find some hints about viewing your photos in full-screen mode, 
inside the Viewer window. After that, the section “Organizing your photos” 
explains how to customize the folder setup that the Canon software creates 
for you.
Viewing photos in full-screen mode
Double-clicking a thumbnail in the main browser window displays the image 
inside the Viewer window. Figure 8-15 shows the Windows version of the 
Viewer window; Figure 8-16 shows the Mac alternative.

After opening an image in the Viewer window, use these tricks to inspect it 
more closely:
 
✓ Magnify the image. You can zoom in on your image for a closer look by 
using these techniques:
 
• In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows): Drag the Zoom slider or click the 
preview with the Zoom In tool, both labeled in Figure 8-15.
 
• In ImageBrowser (Mac): Choose a specific magnification level from 
the Display Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 8-16.

Figure 8-16: The Mac version of the Viewer window looks like this.
 
✓ Scroll a magnified image. After you magnify the photo, a tiny Navigator 
window appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown in the 
figures. The little red triangles in the Navigator window indicate the area 
that you’re viewing in the main preview. To scroll the display to see 
another portion of the image, put your cursor in the Navigator window, 
within the area bounded by those little red triangles, and drag.
 
 In Windows, you also can click the Hand tool, labeled in Figure 8-15, and 
drag in the preview. On a Mac, just drag in the preview; your cursor 
automatically sets itself to Hand-tool mode as soon as you enlarge the 
image display.
 
✓ Reduce the view size. In Windows, click the preview with the Zoom Out 
tool or use the Zoom slider. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) On a Mac, choose a 
smaller zoom size from the Display Size drop-down list.
 
 To zoom out so that you can see the entire image, click the Fit to 
Window button in Windows. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) On a Mac, choose Fit 
to Window from the Display Size list instead.

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ View the next image in the folder. If you want to inspect more images 
in the Viewer window, just click the Previous and Next buttons, labeled 
in Figure 8-15, if you use Windows. On a Mac, click the Back or Next 
button located under the preview.
 
✓ Edit the photo. To use the editing tools provided with the program, 
open the Edit drop-down list, found above the preview in Windows and 
beneath it on a Mac. Then select the editing task you want to perform. 
Chapter 10 provides more details about shifting into Editing mode and 
using the available tools.
Keep in mind that the preceding tidbits just give you the basics of using the 
Viewer window; for additional tips, check out the program manual.
Organizing your photos
By default, the Canon download software 
puts your picture files into either the 
Pictures or My Pictures folder in Windows 
or in the Pictures folder on a Mac. Within 
that folder, the downloading tools orga-
nize the images by their shooting dates, 
creating a new folder for each date found 
on the memory card, as shown in Figure 
8-17. Each folder contains only the images 
shot on that particular day.
If you don’t like this organizational struc-
ture, you can change it. For example, 
maybe you prefer to organize photos 
according to the date you downloaded 
them to your computer. Or you may 
want to organize images by category — 
family, travel, work, and so on. I took this 
approach to customize my folder collec-
tion in Figure 8-17. 
To keep things simple, I suggest that 
you add these custom folders within the 
Pictures or My Pictures folder (Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac). That way, 
you’ll always know where to look for images on your computer’s hard drive. 
And programs that default to looking to those folders for photos will be able 
to find them as well. The next two sections show you the basics you need to 
create custom folders and then organize images in them.
Figure 8-17: You can create custom 
folders to organize images by category.

267
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Creating custom folders
Take these steps to add a folder to the My Pictures or Pictures list. Again, 
which folder is the default image-storage tank depends on your computer’s 
OS (operating system).
 
1. Click the Favorite Folders tab of the Explore panel, if it isn’t already 
visible.
 
2. Click My Pictures or Pictures.
 
 The folder should appear highlighted.
 
3. Choose File➪New Folder.
 
 The New Folder dialog box appears.
 
4. Type the name of the folder in the text box and then click OK.
 
 Your folder appears as a subfolder under the My Pictures or Pictures 
folder.
To create a subfolder within your new folder, follow the same process, but 
click the new folder in Step 2.
Managing your image collection
After you create your folders, you can place images into them in two ways:
 
✓ Move an image from one folder to another. Display the image thumb-
nail and then drag it to the desired folder. The program moves the image 
file to the new folder and removes it from the old one.
 
✓ Download new images directly to your desired folder. You can specify 
a custom folder as the download destination when you use the EOS 
Utility and MemoryCard Utility software to transfer images. See the ear-
lier sections of this chapter for details.
Use these techniques to maintain and further organize your image collection:
 
✓ Delete a folder. First, click the folder name to select it. Then, in 
Windows, choose File➪Delete. On a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. In 
both cases, when the program displays a message asking you to confirm 
that you want to get rid of the folder, click Yes to proceed.
 
 
Be careful: This step deletes both the folder and all images inside it!
 
✓ Rename a folder. Click the folder and choose File➪Rename. In the 
dialog box that appears, type the new folder name and then click OK.
 
✓ Rename a picture file. Click the image thumbnail and choose File➪
Rename. Type the new name in the dialog box that appears and then 
click OK. Note: Do not type the three-letter file extension (.jpg or .CR2) 
at the end of the new filename. The program adds that data automatically 
to the filename for you.

268
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Delete a picture. Click the image thumbnail to select it. Then, in 
Windows, choose File➪Delete; on a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. 
Like with deleting a folder, you’re presented with a dialog box asking 
you whether you really, really want to dump that image. Respond in the 
affirmative to do so.
Processing Raw (CR2) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you 
to capture images as raw data. One advantage of capturing Raw files, which 
are called CR2 files on your Rebel T1i/500D, is that you make the decisions 
about how to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can 
specify attributes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and 
so on — all of which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its 
other file format, JPEG.
 
The bad news: You have to specify attributes, such as color intensity, image 
sharpening, contrast, and so on before you can do anything with your pic-
tures. Although you can print them immediately if you use the Canon soft-
ware, you can’t take them to a photo lab for printing, share them online, or 
edit them in your photo software until you process them using a tool known 
as a raw converter. At the end of the process, you save the finished file in a 
standard file format, such as JPEG or TIFF.
Using your mouse as a shutter button
Along with providing a convenient way for you 
to download images, the EOS Utility software 
enables you to use your computer to actually 
shoot pictures.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, clicking the Camera Settings/Remote 
Shooting button in the main EOS Utility window 
displays a panel containing clickable controls 
for adjusting the major camera settings, such 
as aperture, white balance, ISO, and metering 
mode. After you establish those settings, you 
click another button to record whatever scene 
is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, this feature is great 
in scenarios that make having a live photog-
rapher close to the subject either difficult or 
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot 
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or cap-
ture an image of an animal that’s shy around 
humans. Additionally, the software enables 
easy time-lapse photography, enabling you to 
set the camera to take pictures automatically 
at specified intervals over a period of minutes, 
hours, or even days.

269
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
If you decide to shoot in the Raw format, you can process your images with 
the free Canon software provided with your camera. For this task, you can 
start the job in ZoomBrowser (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). But to 
actually process your files, you must call on a second program, Digital Photo 
Professional, from within the browser program. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the image thumbnail in the ZoomBrowser or ImageBrowser 
window.
 
2. In Windows, choose Tools➪Process RAW Images by Digital Photo 
Professional. On a Mac, choose File➪Process RAW Images by Digital 
Photo Professional.
 
 Be sure to choose this specific command and not Processing RAW 
Image. That feature doesn’t work with Raw files produced by your 
camera.
 
 The Digital Photo Professional window appears, displaying thumbnails 
of your photos. 
 
3. Inside Digital Photo Professional, click your image thumbnail and 
then choose View➪Edit in Edit Image Window.
 
 Now your photo appears inside an editing window, as shown in Figure 8-18. 
The exact appearance of the window may vary depending on your pro-
gram settings. If you don’t see the tool palette on the right side of the 
window, choose View➪Tool Palette to display it. (Other View menu 
options enable you to customize the window display.)
 
 The Tool Palette offers three tabs full of controls for adjusting your 
photo. You can find complete details in the program’s Help system, but I 
want to highlight a couple of the available options:
 
• Raw tab: On this tab, shown in Figure 8-18, you find controls for 
tweaking exposure, white balance, and color. For white balance, 
you can choose a specific setting, as shown in the figure (I selected 
Cloudy), or click the little eyedropper and then click an area of the 
image that should be white, black, or gray to remove any color cast.
 
 Through the Picture Style option, you can actually apply one of the 
camera’s Picture Style options to the photo. Or you can customize 
the style by dragging the Sharpness, Contrast, Color Saturation, 
and Color Tone sliders. (If you select Monochrome as the Picture 
Style, the Color Saturation and Color Tone sliders are replaced by 
the Filter Effect and Toning Effect sliders.) Chapter 6 talks about 
Picture Styles.
 
• RGB tab: This tab enables you to adjust exposure further by using a 
Tone Curve adjustment similar to the one that I cover in Chapter 10. 
You can make additional color and sharpness adjustments here as 
well, but it’s best to make those changes using the controls on the 
Raw tab instead. (The RGB tab options are provided primarily for 
manipulating JPEG and TIFF photos and not for Raw conversion).

270
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 8-18: You can convert Raw images using Digital Photo Professional.
 
• NR/Lens/ALO tab: On this tab, shown in Figure 8-19, you can apply 
noise removal and correct certain lens distortion problems. You 
can even apply Peripheral Illumination Correction and the Auto 
Lighting Optimizer effects here instead of through the in-camera 
correction (which I cover in Chapter 5). Click the Tune button to 
access the lens correction options.
 
 At any time, you can revert the image to the original settings by choosing 
Adjustment — Revert to Shot Settings.
 
4. Choose File➪Convert and Save.
 
 You see the standard file-saving dialog box with a few additional controls, 
as shown in Figure 8-20. The figure features the Windows Vista version of 
the dialog box, but the critical controls are the same no matter what type 
of computer you use.
 
5. Set the save options.
 
 Here’s the rundown of the critical options:
 
• File Type: Choose EXIF-Tiff (8 bits/channel). This saves your image 
in the TIFF file format, which preserves all image data. Don’t choose 
the JPEG format; doing so is destructive to the photo because of the 
lossy compression that is applied. Chapter 3 has details.

271
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
 A bit is a unit of computer data; 
the more bits you have, the more 
colors your image can contain. 
Many photo editing programs can’t 
open 16-bit files, or they limit you 
to a few editing tools, so I suggest 
you stick with the standard, 8-bit 
image option unless you know 
your software can handle the 
higher bit depth. If you do prefer 
16-bit files, you can select TIFF 
16bit as your file type.
 
• Output Resolution: This option does 
not adjust the pixel count of your 
image, as you might imagine. It only 
sets the default output resolution 
that will be used if you send the 
photo to a printer. Most photo-
editing programs enable you to 
adjust this value before printing. 
The Canon software does not, how-
ever, so if you plan to print through 
the browser, I suggest you set this 
value to 300. Chapter 9 talks more 
about printing.
 
• Embed ICC Profile in Image: On your 
Rebel T1i/500D, you can shoot in 
either the sRGB or Adobe RGB color 
space; Chapter 6 has details. Select this check box when saving 
your processed Raw file to include the color-space data in the file. 
If you then open the photo in a program that supports color pro-
files, the colors are rendered more accurately. (ICC refers to the 
International Color Consortium, the group that created color-space 
standards.)
 
• Resize: Uncheck this box so that your processed file contains all its 
original pixels.
 
6. Enter a filename, select the folder and browse where you want to 
store the image, and then click Save.
 
 A progress box appears, letting you know that the conversion and file-
saving is going forward. Click the Exit button (Windows) or the Terminate 
button (Mac) to close the progress box when the process is complete.
 
7. Close the Edit window to return to the Digital Photo Professional 
browser.
Figure 8-19: You can apply 
Peripheral Illumination Correction 
here as well as in the camera.

272
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
8. Close Digital Photo Professional.
 
 You see a dialog box that tells you that your Raw file was edited and 
asks whether you want to save the changes. 
 
9. Click Yes to store your raw-processing “recipe” with the Raw file.
 
The Raw settings you used are then kept with the original image so that 
you can create additional copies of the Raw file easily without having to 
make all your adjustments again.
Again, these steps give you only a basic overview of the process. If you 
regularly shoot in the Raw format, take the time to explore the Digital Photo 
Professional Help system so that you can take advantage of its other features. 
If you prefer, you can choose to use that program to do your photo down-
loading and organizing as well instead of ZoomBrowser or ImageBrowser.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was good, not great. Making a print was a 
pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-
high prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, 
retail photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, and online 
printing services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least 
in the case of digital photo printing, to a very good 
outcome. Your Rebel T1i/500D can help you pro-
duce dynamic prints even at large sizes, and getting 
those prints made is easy and economical, thanks 
to an abundance of digital printing services now in 
stores and online. For home printing, today’s print-
ers are better and less expensive than ever, too.

274
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
That said, getting the best prints from your picture files still requires a little 
bit of knowledge and prep work on your part. To that end, this chapter tells 
you exactly how to ensure that your pictures will look as good on paper as 
they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter shows you how to prepare your picture for e-mail 
sharing — an important step if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by 
cluttering their inboxes with ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following 
that, you can find out how to create a digital slide show, view your pictures 
on a television, and more.
Avoiding Printing Problems
Although digital printing has come a long way in the past couple of years, 
a few issues still can cause hiccups in the process. Before you print your 
photos, whether on your own printer or through a lab, read through the 
next three sections, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble 
spots.
Check the pixel count before you print
Resolution — the number of pixels in your digital image — plays a huge role 
in how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture qual-
ity. You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a 
quick recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ Choose the right resolution before you shoot: On your Rebel T1i/500D, 
you set picture resolution via the Quality option, found on Shooting 
Menu 1, or through the Quick Control display.
 
 
You must select this option before you capture an image, which means 
that you need some idea of your ultimate print size before you shoot. 
And remember that if you crop your image, you eliminate some pixels, 
so take that factor into account when you do the resolution math.
 
✓ Aim for a minimum of 200 pixels per inch (ppi): For good print quality, 
the minimum pixel count (in my experience, anyway) is 200 pixels per 
linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you want a 4-x-6-inch print, 
you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
 Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably, 
Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, going 
higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.

275
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right pixel 
level is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. Dots per inch (dpi) refers to 
how many dots of color the printer can lay down per inch; many print-
ers use multiple dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 
 If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the 
software that you use to order your prints should determine the resolu-
tion of your files and then suggest appropriate print sizes. If you’re print-
ing on a home printer, though, you need to be the resolution cop.
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important — 
print size or print quality.
If your print size exceeds your pixel supply, you have the following two 
choices, neither of which provides a good outcome:
 
✓ Keep the existing pixel count and accept lowered photo quality. In 
this case, your pixels simply grow in size to fill the requested print 
size. When pixels get too large, you get a defect known as pixelation. 
The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairstepped, along curved or 
digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually make out the individual 
pixels, and your photo begins to look more like a mosaic than, well, a 
photograph.
 
✓ Add more pixels and accept lowered photo quality. In some photo 
programs, you can add pixels to an existing image, a process called 
resampling. Some other photo programs even resample the photo 
automatically for you, depending on the print settings you choose. 
 
 
Although this option might sound good, it really doesn’t solve your 
problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo information out 
of thin air, and the resulting image usually looks worse than the origi-
nal. You don’t get pixelation, but details turn muddy, giving the image a 
blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 show you the same image as 
it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of this book), 
at 50 ppi, and then resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, there’s 
just no way around the rule: If you want the best-quality prints, you need the 
right pixel count from the get-go.

276

Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, yours produces images that have an aspect 
ratio of 3:2. That is, images are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just like 35mm 
film — which means that they translate perfectly to the standard 4-x-6-inch 
print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, which means the pic-
tures must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 
8 x 10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those pro-
portions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an 
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.

277
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
As a point of reference, both images in Figure 9-3 are original, 3:2 images. 
The blue outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 5-x-7-inch 
frame and an 8-x-10-inch frame, respectively.
Chapter 10 shows you how to crop your image using the free Canon software 
that ships with your camera. You also can usually crop your photo using the 
software provided at online printing sites and at retail print kiosks. If you 
plan to simply drop off your memory card for printing at a lab, be sure to find 
out whether the printer automatically crops the image without your input. 
If so, use your photo software to crop the photo, save the cropped image to 
your memory card, and deliver that version of the file to the printer.
 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as I did for the example in 
Figure 9-3. That way, you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter 
what print size you choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as 
head room, especially when describing portrait composition.)

Get print and monitor colors in sync
Ah, your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your monitor, the most likely culprit is actually the 
monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately calibrated, the 
colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image colors. The 
same caveat applies with regard to monitor brightness: You can’t accu-
rately gauge the exposure of a photo if the brightness of the monitor is 
cranked way up or down.

279
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, 
you can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a 
small program that guides you through the process of adjusting your 
monitor. The program displays various color swatches and other graph-
ics and then asks you to provide feedback about what you see onscreen.
 
 If you use a Mac, its operating software (or OS) offers a built-in cali-
bration utility, the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-4 shows the 
welcome screen that appears when you run the program. (Access it by 
opening the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, 
clicking the Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate button.) You 
also can find free calibration software for both Mac and Windows sys-
tems online; just enter the term free monitor calibration software into 
your favorite search engine.
 
 
 Figure 9-4: Mac users can take advantage of the operating system’s built-in 
calibration tool.
 
 Software-based tools, though, depend on your eyes to make decisions 
during the calibration process. For a more reliable calibration, you may 
want to invest in a hardware solution, such as the Pantone Huey ($90, 
www.pantone.com) or the ColorVision Spyder2express ($80, www. 
datacolor.com). These products use a device known as a colorimeter 
to accurately measure your display colors.

280
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so because monitor colors do drift over time.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that 
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the 
truth is that a printer that doesn’t use multiple black or gray cartridges 
will always have a slight color tint. Why? Because in order to create 
gray, the printer instead has to mix yellow, magenta, and cyan in per-
fectly equal amounts, and that’s a difficult feat for the typical inkjet 
printer to pull off. If your black-and-white prints have a strong color tint, 
however, it could be that one of your color cartridges is empty, and 
replacing it may help somewhat. Long story short: Unless you have a 
printer that’s marketed for producing good black-and-white prints, you’ll 
probably save yourself some grief by simply having your black-and-
whites printed at a retail lab.
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands (although may be cheaper) may not deliver the perfor-
mance you get from cartridges from your printer manufacturer. A lot 
of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the printer’s ink-
delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously knows most 
about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper 
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: Cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color management 
duties. Some photo programs offer color management tools, which 
enable you to control how colors are handled as an image passes from 
camera to monitor to printer. Most printer software also offers color 
management features. The problem is, if you enable color management 
controls both in your photo software and your printer software, you can 

281
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
create conflicts that lead to wacky colors. Check your photo software 
and printer manuals to find out what color management options are 
available and how to turn them on and off.
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t repro-
duce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition, 
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated 
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see. Also allow your prints to dry for 
15 minutes or so before you make any final judgments.
Printing Online or In-Store
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own 
tire pressure, and hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. 
Unless, that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time 
and for less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digi-
tal photo printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine art 
images I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local 
retail photo lab.
 
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I 
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with 
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the 
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out 
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options:
 
✓ Drop-off printing services: Just like you used to leave a roll of film at the 
photo lab of your corner drugstore or camera store, you can drop off 
your memory card, order your prints, and then pick them up in as little 
as an hour.
 
✓ Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail 
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card 
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for 
your prints to slide out the print chute.
 
✓ Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to 
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house. 
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are 
well-known players in this market. Many national retail chains (Ritz 
Camera, Wal-Mart, and others) also offer this service.

282
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national 
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering, and 
then you can pick up your prints locally.
 
 
This service is a great way to share prints with friends and family 
who don’t live nearby. I can upload and order prints from my desk in 
Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed at a store located a few 
miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
Printing from ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
If you prefer to print your own pictures on a home or office printer, the pro-
cess is much the same as printing anything from your computer: You open 
the picture file in your photo software of choice; choose File➪Print; and 
specify the print size, paper size, paper type, and so on, as usual.
The following steps show you how to get the job done using Canon 
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Chapter 8 introduces 
you to this free software, so you may want to pop over to that chapter to find 
out how to browse your images using the program, if you haven’t already 
done so. Then walk this way:
 
1. Click the thumbnail for the image that you want to print.
 
2. Choose File➪Print➪Photo Print.
 
 Your image then appears inside the Photo Print window, as shown in 
Figure 9-5. The figure shows the Windows Vista version of the Photo 
Print features. If you’re a Mac user, your window lacks the gray task 
panel that appears on the left in Windows, but don’t fret: The critical 
printing settings remain the same, albeit with a slightly different look.
 
3. Select a printer.
 
 In Windows, choose the printer from the Name drop-down list. On a 
Mac, select your printer from the Printer drop-down list.
 
4. Specify your printer settings.
 
• Windows: Click the Properties button.
 
• Mac: Click the Page Setup button.
 
 Either way, you’re taken to the standard print-setup dialog box for your 
printer. The options therein depend on your printer, so check your 
manual for guidance. But be sure to specify the following settings:
 
• Paper size
 
• Paper type (glossy, plain paper, and so on)
 
• Borderless printing on or off (if your printer offers this feature)

283
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Figure 9-5: Your first step is to select a printer and paper size.
 
 The browser software automatically chooses the print orientation (por-
trait or landscape) that best fits the image on the page. Even though you 
can select an orientation option in your printer setup dialog box, the 
program overrides you later if it deems necessary.
 
 When you finish establishing the printer settings, click OK to return to 
the Photo Print window.
 
5. Adjust the image cropping as necessary.
 
 By default, the browser automatically enlarges and/or crops your image 
to fit your chosen paper size if necessary. To see exactly what has been 
cropped in Windows, click the Trim Image button. On a Mac, click the 
Remove Unwanted Regions of Your Photo button.
 
 In both cases, your image opens in the Trim Image editing window, as 
shown in Figure 9-6, which contains some of the controls that you see 
when you use the program’s editing functions.

Figure 9-6: You can adjust the image cropping if needed.
 
 Chapter 10 details the Trim Image editing controls, but here’s the short 
story:
 
• The box with the little white squares around it indicates the crop 
box. Anything outside the box isn’t printed.
 
• Drag any of those squares to adjust the size of the crop box. You’re 
limited to setting the box to the same proportions as your selected 
paper size.
 
• Drag inside the box to move it over a different part of the photo.
 
• Click the Orientation icons (Windows) or Trimming Frame buttons 
(Mac) if you want to change the layout of the cropping box (hori-
zontal or vertical).
 
• Click OK to apply the new cropping and return to the Photo Print 
window.

285
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 
If you don’t want your photo to be cropped or enlarged, you need to exit 
the printing process and adjust a program preference. See the end of 
these steps for details.
 
6. Add the shooting date/time (optional).
 
 You can print the date and time when the photo was taken by choosing 
an option from the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list in the Photo Print 
window (refer to Figure 9-5). The program determines the date and time 
from data in the image file.
 
 If you choose to print the date and time, click the Properties button that 
appears underneath the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list to set the 
font, size, and placement of the type.
 
7. Add a caption to the photo (optional).
 
 To add a caption to your photo, click the Insert Text button (Windows, 
upper-right corner of the screen) or the Add or Modify Text to Print with 
This Photo button (Mac). Either way, you’re taken to the Insert Text 
window, which offers most of the same text tools as the regular Insert 
Text window, which I cover at the end of Chapter 10. If you add text, 
click OK to close the Insert Text window and return to the Photo Print 
window when you’re finished.
 
8. Click the Print button.
 
 Your photo file is shipped to the printer.
As I mention in Step 5, you can choose to turn off the automatic cropping that 
occurs by default. First, close the Photo Print window if it’s open. Then take 
these steps:
 
✓ Windows: Choose Tools➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog 
box. Click the Printing tab and select the Do Not Allow Trimming of the 
Image option. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
✓ Mac: Choose ImageBrowser➪Preferences. Select Photo Print from the 
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box that appears. Then select Do 
Not Trim and click OK.
 
If you take this step, the Trim function inside the Photo Print dialog box 
becomes disabled, so you must do any cropping before you print.
Although it’s fine for casual printing, Photo Print lacks some features that 
are typically found in most photo editors and even in the software that ships 
with most photo printers. You can’t print multiple images on the same page, 
for example, or even multiple copies of the same photo. So if you own other 
software, you may find it more convenient than using the browser’s print 
functions.

286
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
Whatever software you use, be sure to follow the resolution guidelines set 
out near the beginning of this chapter. And note that the Photo Print window 
doesn’t warn you if your image doesn’t contain enough pixels to produce a 
good print at the size you select. So before you begin printing, check that 
pixel count by displaying the Shooting Information panel in the main browser 
window. The Image Size listing, highlighted in Figure 9-7, shows you the pixel 
count.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your Rebel T1i/500D offers two features that 
enable you to print directly from your camera or 
memory card — without using the computer as 
middle-machine — assuming that your printer 
offers the required options.
The first of these features is DPOF (Digital Print 
Order Format). With this option, accessed via the 
Print Order option on your camera’s Playback 
menu, you select the pictures on your memory 
card that you want to print, and you specify how 
many copies you want of each image. Then, if 
your photo printer has a Secure Digital (SD) 
memory card slot (or SDHC slot, if you use these 
new high-capacity cards) and supports DPOF, 
you just pop the memory card into that slot. The 
printer reads your “print order” and outputs just 
the requested copies of your selected images. 
(You use the printer’s own controls to set paper 
size, print orientation, and other print settings.)
A second direct-printing feature, PictBridge, 
works a little differently. If you have a 
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
when you need fast printing. For example, if you 
shoot pictures at a party and want to deliver 
prints to guests before they go home, DPOF 
offers a quicker option than firing up your com-
puter, downloading pictures, and so on. And 
if you invest in one of the tiny portable photo 
printers on the market today, you can easily 
make prints away from your home or office — 
you can take both your portable printer and 
camera along to your regional sales meeting, 
for example.
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, 
the camera must be turned on for the whole 
printing process, wasting battery power. If 
you’re interested in exploring either printing 
feature, your camera manual provides complete 
details.

Figure 9-7: Make sure that the pixel count is adequate for the print size.
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail and Online Sharing
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one 
in Figure 9-8? Some well-meaning friend or relative sent you a digital photo 
that’s so large you can’t to view the whole thing on your monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 450 pixels at its lon-
gest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture with-
out scrolling, as in Figure 9-9. This image measures 450 x 300 pixels.

288
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
This recommendation means that even if you shoot at your camera’s lowest-
resolution setting (2352 x 1568), you need to dump pixels from your images 
before sending them to the cyber post office. If you’re posting to an online 
photo sharing site, you may be able to upload all your original pixels, but 
many sites do have resolution limits.
 
 
Figure 9-8: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
 
In addition to resizing your originals, you also need to check their file type; 
if the photos are in the Raw (CR2) or TIFF format, you need to create a JPEG 
copy for online use. Web browsers and e-mail programs can’t display Raw or 
TIFF files.
Fortunately, you can tackle both bits of photo prep pretty easily in 
ZoomBrowser or ImageBrowser. Click this way:
 
1. For Raw files, follow the steps in Chapter 8 to convert the photo to the 
TIFF format.
 
 You use Canon Digital Photo Professional to do the conversion. After 
you finish the process, close that program and return to ZoomBrowser 
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac).

289
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 
Given that you then need to make a JPEG copy of your TIFF file for online 
sharing, why not just save your converted raw files as JPEG images at 
the processing stage? Because JPEG is a destructive format, eliminating 
some image data as a tradeoff for producing smaller file sizes. You want 
to create the original Raw conversion in the TIFF format, which retains 
top image quality.
 
 
Figure 9-9: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 450 pixels wide or tall.
 
2. In the image browser, click the thumbnail of the photo you want to 
e-mail.
 
 The photo can be in JPEG or TIFF format.
 
3. Choose File➪Export➪Export Still Images (Windows) or File➪Export 
Image (Mac).
 
 
Export is the geekspeak way of saying “save this file in a different format.”
 
 In Windows, you next see a window that contains the file-saving options, 
as shown in Figure 9-10. On a Mac, you see the Write a Still Image box 
instead; click Edit and Save Image and then click the Next button to get 
to the file-saving options. They’re arranged a little differently on the Mac 
than in Figure 9-10, but the basic controls are the same.

290
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 9-10: Use the Export command to create a JPEG copy of a TIFF photo.
 
4. Set the image size.
 
 To keep the original pixel count, deselect the Resize Images During 
Export check box (Windows) or Resize the Image box (Mac). If you want 
to resample the image (trim the pixel count), select the box, as shown 
in the figure. Then click the Long Side option (Windows) or Specify the 
Length Dimension (Mac) and type a value in the neighboring box. The 
value you enter determines the number of pixels the image contains 
along its longest side. The program automatically sets the pixel count of 
the shortest side to retain the original image proportions.
 
 
For e-mail images, I suggest setting the long side of the image to 450 
pixels or less. This ensures that the recipient can view the entire image 
without scrolling the e-mail window. If you’re posting to an online photo 
sharing site, check the site guidelines about picture dimensions. Some 
sites enable you to upload high-resolution photos so that people who 

291
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
view them can order prints. Usually, the main photo page contains small 
thumbnails that people can click to view the larger version of the image.
 
5. Select the Change Image Type check box.
 
 For JPEG originals, you aren’t actually changing the file type, but you 
need to check the box anyway to be able to access the file-saving option 
used later, in Step 7.
 
6. Select the JPEG format from the drop-down list under the check box.
 
 This setting should already be selected for you if your original is a JPEG 
file.
 
7. Use the Quality (Windows) or Image Quality (Mac) slider to set the 
desired image quality.
 
 At the highest Quality setting, the program applies the least amount 
of JPEG compression, which is the process that reduces file sizes by 
dumping image data. For the best image quality, set the slider to either 
Highest or High. (Your file size is already pretty small because of the 
reduced pixel count.)
 
 
By clicking the Calculate button, you can see the approximate file size 
of your JPEG copy, which is determined by the dimensions (pixel count) 
and quality level you choose. If you’re sending the photo to someone 
who is forced to still use a dial-up Internet connection, you may want to 
notch the quality level down a bit so the picture can download faster. 
 
8. Specify a filename.
 
 You have two options:
 
• Accept the program’s filename. If you deselect the Add a Prefix 
check box (Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac), the pro-
gram gives your JPEG copy the same name as the original — for 
example, IMG_7813.TIF becomes IMG_7813.JPG. For JPEG photos, 
the program tags a number onto the end of the filename so that 
you don’t overwrite your original file. IMG_7813.jpg becomes 
IMG_7813_2.jpg, for example.
 
• Create a new filename: You also can assign a new filename to 
your e-mail–sized copy. First, select the Add a Prefix check box 
(Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac). Then type the text 
in the adjacent text box. Note that the program automatically 
appends the numbers 0001 to whatever text you enter. For exam-
ple, if you type Web in the box, the filename of your JPEG copy will 
be Web0001.jpg. 

292
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
9. Choose the folder where you want to store the JPEG file.
 
• Windows: You specify the folder by using the Save to Folder option. 
Click Current Folder to put the copy in the same folder as the origi-
nal. Click Pictures (or My Pictures, depending on the version of 
Windows you use) to put the copy in that folder instead, or click 
Browse to select another folder.
 
 
Depending on the size of the program window, you may need to 
scroll the window display to be able to see the Save to Folder 
option.
 
• Mac: On a Mac, the current folder destination appears at the 
bottom of the dialog box; click the Browse button to select a differ-
ent storage bin.
 
10. Click Finish to save the copy.
After creating your Web-ready image, you can attach it to an e-mail message 
just as you do any file.
 
If you need to prepare a photograph for use on a Web page, you can use 
these same steps. Just ask the Web site designer what dimensions to use in 
Step 4. Also find out whether the site has any maximum file size limits and, if 
so, adjust the quality level in Step 7 until you get the picture file within those 
guidelines. (Click the Calculate button after each adjustment to see the new 
file size.)
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of 
photos, consider posting your images at an 
online photo album site instead of attaching 
them to e-mail messages. Photo sharing sites 
(such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa) 
all allow you to create digital photo albums and 
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture sharing is free, but your 
albums and images are deleted if you don’t 
order prints or make some other purchase 
from the site within a specified amount of time. 
Additionally, although many free sites enable 
you to upload high-resolution files for print-
ing, they don’t let you retrieve those files from 
the site. (In other words, don’t think of album 
sites as archival storage solutions.) And here’s 
another little bit of fine print to investigate: The 
membership agreement at some sites states 
that you agree to let the site use your photos, 
for free, for any purpose that it sees fit. I never 
use this type of site, but it’s up to you to decide 
what you think is safe and fair.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Creating an In-Camera Slide Show
Many photo editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or (if copied to DVD) on a DVD 
player. You can even add music, special transition effects, and the like to jazz 
up your presentations.
If you just want a simple slide show — that is, one that just displays all the 
photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a com-
puter or any photo software. You can create and run the slide show right on 
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in 
the next section, you can present your show to a whole roomful of people.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Display Playback Menu 2 and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-11.
 
 
 Figure 9-11: Choose Slide Show and then use the options to customize a few aspects 
of the playback.
 
2. Press Set.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure. The thumbnail 
shows the first image that will appear in the slide show.
 
 In the neighboring box, you see the total number of images currently 
slated for inclusion in the show. On your first trip to this menu screen, 
all images on the card are selected for the show.
 
3. Select which files you want to include in the slide show.
 
 To do this, highlight the second box to the right of the thumbnail — it 
says All Images in Figure 9-11. Then press Set to activate the option 
box, as shown in the figure. (The little up and down arrows indicate the 
option’s active and ready to be adjusted.)

294
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Now use the up and down cross keys to scroll through your four play-
back options and select your choice, as follows:
 
• All Images: Choose this setting and then press Set to include all 
files, whether they’re still photos or movies.
 
• Date: With this option, you can play only pictures or movies taken 
on a single date. As soon as you select the option, the screen 
changes to show you the thumbnail of the first photo you took on 
the most recent shooting data, along with the number of pictures 
taken on the same day (see the figure on the left in Figure 9-12). To 
select a different date, press the DISP button to bring up a screen 
similar to the one shown on the right in Figure 9-12. The list on the 
left shows you the shooting dates of all the files on the memory 
card. Use the up and down cross keys to scroll to the date you 
want to use and then press Set.
 
 
 Figure 9-12: With the Date option, you can limit the show to photos or movies shot on a 
specific day.
 
• Movies: Select this option and press Set to include only movies in 
your show.
 
• Stills: Select this option and press Set to include only still photos in 
the show.
 
4. Highlight Set Up, as shown on the left in Figure 9-13, and press Set.
 
 You cruise to the right screen in the figure.
 
5. Set the still photo playback time.
 
 By default, all still photos appear for one second. If you want a longer 
display time, highlight the Play Time option, as shown on the right in 
the figure, and press Set. You’re presented with a menu that offers four 
timing options, ranging from one second to five seconds. Highlight your 
choice and press Set.

295
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 
Figure 9-13: You can specify how long you want each still photo to be displayed.
 
 Movies are played in their entirety, regardless of the option you choose 
here.
 
6. Specify whether you want the slide show to “loop” continuously.
 
 That is, do you want the camera to cease playback when it reaches 
the last photo (not loop) or movie or start the show over again (loop)? 
Here’s how to make the call:
 
a. Highlight the Repeat option on the Slide Show screen (right image in 
Figure 9-13).
 
b. Press Set to activate the option.
 
c. Highlight On for continuous looping, or highlight Off for a one-time 
playback.
 
d. Press Set again.
 
7. Press Menu to return to the main Slide Show screen.
 
 This is the one shown on the left in Figure 9-13.
 
8. Highlight Start and press Set.
 
 Your slide show begins playing.
During the show, you can control the display as follows:
 
✓ Pause playback. Press the Set button. While the show is paused, you 
can press the right or left cross key to view the next or previous photo. 
Press Set again to restart playback.
 
✓ Change the information display style. Press the DISP button. (See 
Chapter 4 for details about the available display styles.)
 
✓ Adjust sound volume for movies. Rotate the Main dial.
 
✓ Exit the slide show. Press the Menu button twice to return to Playback 
Menu 2. Or press the Playback button to return to normal photo playback.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Your camera is equipped with a feature that allows you to play your pictures 
and movies on a television screen. In fact, you get two playback options:
 
✓ HDTV playback: If you have a high-definition television, you can set the 
camera to high-def playback. However, you need to purchase an HDMI 
cable to connect the camera and television; the Canon part number you 
need is HDMI Cable HTC-100.
 
✓ Regular video playback: Haven’t made the leap yet to HDTV? (Join the 
crowd — or, at least, join me.) No worries: You can set the camera to 
send a regular, standard definition audio and video signal to the TV. And 
for this option, no added cable investment is needed because the cable 
you need is included with the camera. It’s the one that has two plugs 
(one yellow and one black) at one end.
With the right cable in hand and the camera turned off, open the little rubber 
door on the left side of the camera. There you find two ports (connection 
slots): one for a standard audio/video (A/V) signal and one for the HDMI 
signal. The A/V port is the same one you use to connect the camera via USB 
for picture download, as explained in Chapter 9. Figure 9-14 labels the two 
ports.
Standard video
HD video
Figure 9-14: You can connect your camera to 
a television, VCR, or DVD player.

297
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
The smaller plug on the cable attaches to the camera. For A/V playback, your 
cable has two plugs at the other end: The yellow one goes into your TV’s 
video jack; the black one goes into the audio jack. For HDMI playback, there’s 
just a single plug that goes to the TV.
At this point, I need to point you to your specific TV manual to find out 
exactly which jacks to use to connect your camera. You also need to consult 
your manual to find out what channel to select for playback of signals from 
auxiliary input devices.
After you sort out that issue, turn on your camera to send the signal to the 
TV set. You can control playback using the same camera controls as you nor-
mally do to view pictures on your camera monitor. (See Chapter 4 for help.) 
You can also run a slide show by following the steps outlined in the preced-
ing section.
 
Note that you may need to adjust one camera setting, Video System, which is 
found on Setup Menu 2. You get just two options here: NTSC and PAL. Select 
the video mode that’s used by your part of the world. (In the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits of 
information presented in the always popular “Top 
Ten” list format.
Chapter 10 shows you how to do some minor 
picture touchups, such as cropping and adjusting 
exposure, by using the free software that shipped 
with your camera. Following that, Chapter 11 
introduces you to ten camera functions that I 
consider specialty tools — bonus options that, 
while not at the top of the list of the features I sug-
gest you study, are nonetheless interesting to 
explore when you have a free moment or two.

Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
E
very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it 
happens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Erase button on your 
camera. Many common problems are surprisingly easy to fix using the tools 
found in most photo-editing programs.
In fact, you can perform many common retouching tasks using one of the free 
programs provided with your camera. Called ZoomBrowser EX in Windows 
and ImageBrowser on the Mac, this software offers tools for removing red-
eye, adjusting exposure, tweaking colors, sharpening focus, and more.
Chapter 8 introduces you to these programs, showing you how to use them 
to download, view, and organize your pictures. This chapter lays out the 
step-by-step instructions for using the editing tools to repair and enhance 
your photos.
 
A few other notes before you start:
 
✓ If you shot your pictures using the Raw file format, 
you must process them using the raw-conversion 
instructions laid out in Chapter 8 before you can 
edit them.
 
✓ Although the tools provided in the free soft-
ware are pretty good, they don’t allow selec-
tive editing. That is, you can’t apply them just 
to the part of your photo that needs help. For 
that kind of retouching work, you need a more 
sophisticated photo editor. One inexpensive 
pick to consider is Adobe Photoshop Elements 
(www.adobe.com), which retails for under $100 
and contains all the tools most digital photographers 
need.
 
✓ Most figures in this chapter feature the Windows versions 
of the Canon software. Although the Mac version looks different, the 
retouching steps are the same unless I state otherwise.
 
✓ For simplicity’s sake, I refer to ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser 
generically in the instructions here as just “the browser.”

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Finally, Canon occasionally posts updates to its software on its Web 
site (www.canon.com). So if you’ve owned your camera for a while, 
check the Web site to make sure that you’re using the most current 
versions of the available programs. This book features version 6.3.1 of 
ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser.
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the Rebel T1i/500D. 
But if you spot red-eye in your flash pictures, take these steps to fix the 
problem:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Again, Chapter 8 shows you how to get your images into the browser 
and keep track of your picture files.
 
 After you double-click a thumbnail, the picture opens in its own 
Viewer window. Figure 10-1 offers a look at how the window appears in 
Windows; Figure 10-2 shows the Mac version.
 
2. Open the Edit drop-down list, as shown in Figures 10-1 and 10-2.
 
 
Figure 10-1: In Windows, click the Edit list above the preview to access 
 
retouching tools.

303
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-2: On a Mac, the Edit list appears at the bottom of the window.
 
3. Choose Red Eye Correction from the Edit list.
 
 Your photo appears in the Red Eye Correction retouching window. 
Figure 10-3 shows the Windows version; Figure 10-4, the Mac version.
 
4. Zoom in on your photo so that you can get a good view of the eyes.
 
• In Windows: Zoom and scroll the display using the controls labeled 
in Figure 10-3, which work the same way as they do when you view 
your photo in the initial Viewer window. Chapter 8 details all the 
controls, but here’s a quick reminder: The fastest way to zoom 
in and out is to drag the Zoom slider; to scroll the display, just 
drag in the Navigator window, which appears whenever the entire 
image isn’t visible at the current preview size. Or click the Hand 
tool, labeled in Figure 10-3, and drag in the preview.
 
• On a Mac: Zoom by choosing a magnification level from the Display 
Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 10-4, or by clicking the Zoom 
In and Zoom Out buttons. The Mac version of the retouching 
window does not sport a Navigator window — instead, you use the 
scroll bars to scroll the display.
 
5. Click the Manual Mode option.
 
 In Auto mode, the red-eye correction tool can sometimes trip up, “cor-
recting” red pixels that aren’t actually in the eye, so stick with Manual 
mode, which enables you to specify exactly where you want the pro-
gram to do its retouching work.

6. In Windows, select the Red Eye tool, labeled in Figure 10-5.
 
 The tool is ready to go if it appears highlighted, as in the figure. If not, 
click the tool icon. Mac users can ignore this step.
 
7. Position your mouse cursor over one of the red eyes.
 
 If the program detects fixable red pixels, a green circle appears, as 
shown in Figure 10-5. The circle indicates the area that the tool will try 
to correct. As you move your cursor around the eye, the circle may 
change size as the program searches for pixels that meet its red-eye 
criteria.

Figure 10-5: The little green circle indicates the eye area that will be replaced.
 
8. Click to initiate the repair.
 
 If you like what you see, move on to the next eye. Or click Undo to get 
rid of the correction and then try again.
 
9. After you finish all eye repairs, click OK.
 
 The Red Eye Correction window closes, and your repaired photo 
appears in the Viewer window.
 
10. Save your picture in the TIFF file format.
 
 The last section of this chapter provides details.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Like most red-eye removal tools, the Canon version can do a good job in the 
right circumstances. But if the eyes are very bright, the tool may not be able 
to make the repair. In addition, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes; 
red-eye tools detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes typi-
cally turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The best solution is 
to simply paint in the correct eye colors.
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Removing 
excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my original 
frog scene, shown on the left in Figure 10-6, and its cropped cousin, shown on 
the right. In the original image, there’s just too much going on — the eye has 
a hard time figuring out what’s important. Eliminating all but a little of the 
surrounding foliage returned emphasis to the subject and created a stronger 
composition.
Figure 10-6: Cropping creates a better composition, eliminating background clutter.
 
You may also want to crop an image so that it fits a specific frame size. As 
Chapter 8 explains, the original images from your camera fit perfectly in 4-x-6-
inch frames, but if you want a 5 x 7, 8 x 10, or other standard print size, you 
need to crop your image to those new proportions. (If you don’t, the photo 
printer software or retail print lab will crop for you, and the result may not 
be the composition that you’d choose.)

 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
Follow these steps to get the job done:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Your photo appears all by its lonesome in a new Viewer window.
 
2. Choose Trim from the Edit drop-down list.
 
 Refer to Figures 10-1 and 10-2, in the preceding section, if you need 
help finding the list. Your image appears in the Trim Image retouching 
window, and a dotted outline, called a crop box, appears around your 
photo, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
3. Click the Advanced Options button to display all the crop-size controls.
 
 Figure 10-7 labels the button and shows the controls that appear when 
you click it. (On a Mac, the panel that contains the controls pops out of 
the side of the dialog box instead of appearing within it.)

4. Choose an option from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list.
 
 Your selection determines the proportions of the cropped image. You 
can go in three directions:
 
• Manual: This option enables you to crop the image to any propor-
tions. I chose this setting for my frog photo.
 
• Maintain Original: The program restricts you to cropping to the 
same proportions as your original, which is 3:2.
 
• Specific Aspect Ratios: You also can select from six specific aspect 
ratios: 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, and 16:9. The first number in the pair 
indicates the width, and the second indicates the height.
 
5. In Windows, make sure that the Trim button is selected (refer to 
Figure 10-7).
 
 It should be selected already unless you used the adjacent controls to 
zoom or scroll the preview. Just click the button to select it if needed. 
Mac users can skip this step.
 
6. Adjust the size and position of the crop box as needed.
 
 Use these techniques:
 
• Move the crop box. Drag inside the box.
 
• Resize the crop box. Drag any of the handles — those little squares 
around the perimeter of the crop box. I labeled one of the handles 
in Figure 10-7.
 
 
As you drag the handles, the W and H boxes in the Size of 
Trimming Area portion of the dialog box reflect the new dimen-
sions of the crop box, with the measurement shown in pixels. Keep 
in mind that pixel count is critical to print quality. Chapters 3 and 
9 provide details, but the short story is that you need roughly 200 
to 300 pixels per linear inch of your print. So if you have a finished 
print size in mind, monitor the W and H values as you adjust the 
crop box size to make sure that you aren’t clipping away too many 
pixels.
 
• Set a specific crop size. You also can enter specific pixel dimen-
sions in the W and H boxes. The crop box automatically adjusts to 
the dimensions you enter.
 
 
Using the third option is the easiest way to crop your photo to a size 
that doesn’t mesh with any of the specific aspect ratio choices. Say that 
you want to produce a 5-x-7-inch print from your cropped photo, and 
you want an image resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Just multiply the 
print dimensions by the desired resolution and then enter those values 
into the W and H boxes. For the 5 x 7 at 300 ppi example, the W and H 
values are 1500 and 2100, respectively. If the resulting crop boundary 
encompasses too much or too little of your photo, just keep adjusting 
the W and H values, making sure to always keep the two at the same pro-
portions you originally entered.

309
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
7. Turn on the Use the Rule of Thirds gridlines (optional).
 
 A classic composition rule is to imagine that your image is divided into 
thirds vertically and horizontally and then position the subject at a spot 
where two dividing lines intersect. To help you visualize that concept, 
the Trim box can display those horizontal and vertical grid lines, as 
shown in Figure 10-8. Just click the Use the Rule of Thirds check box to 
toggle the grid on and off.

Figure 10-8: The Rule of Thirds gridlines offer a compositional guide.
 
8. When you’re happy with the crop box, click the Trim Image button.
 
 The cropped photo appears in the preview. If you don’t like the results, 
click the Undo button and try again.
 
9. Click OK to close the retouching window.
 
10. Choose File➪Save As to save your cropped image.
 
 The last section of this chapter has details.
Adjusting Color Saturation
Saturation refers to the intensity and purity of color. A fully saturated color 
contains no black, white, or gray. In other words, saturated colors are deep, 
rich, and bold.
On occasion, an image can benefit from a little saturation bump. Figure 10-9 
offers an example. I was drawn to this scene by the mix of colors, and the 
original photo, shown on the left, seemed a little lackluster in that regard. So 
I increased the saturation ever so slightly to produce the image shown on the 
right.

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Original
Increased saturation
 
Figure 10-9: I slightly increased saturation to make the colors pop a little more.
Follow these steps to adjust saturation:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Your photo opens inside its own Viewer window.
 
2. Click the Edit drop-down list.
 
 The list appears above the image preview in Windows; it appears below 
the preview on a Mac.
 
3. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the list.
 
 Your image appears in the Color/Brightness Adjustment retouching 
window. The window contents vary depending whether you’re using the 
Windows or Mac version of the program; Figures 10-10 and 10-11 show 
you both versions.
 
4. Set the Retouching mode to Color Adjustment.
 
• In Windows: Select Color Adjustment from the drop-down list at 
the top of the window (refer to Figure 10-10). After you do so, the 
window offers three sliders: Brightness, Saturation, and Contrast.
 
• On a Mac: Click the Color Adjustment tab. The Mac version of the 
tool offers just Saturation and Brightness sliders.

311

Figure 10-10: In Windows, select Color Adjustment from the top drop-down list.
 
 
Figure 10-11: On a Mac, click the Color Adjustment tab to display these options.
 
 
One note about the Brightness and Contrast controls: These tools 
aren’t the best options for adjusting exposure and contrast. You can 
get much better results by using the Level Adjustment and Tone Curve 
Adjustment tools, both explained later in this chapter.

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
5. Drag the Saturation slider to adjust the image as desired.
 
 
Be careful about increasing saturation too much. Doing so actually can 
destroy picture detail because areas that previously contained a range 
of saturation levels all shift to the fully saturated state, giving you a solid 
blob of color.
 
6. Click OK to apply the change and close the retouching window.
 
7. Save the edited image, following the steps provided at the end of this 
chapter.
Tweaking Color Balance
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance and Picture 
Style controls to manipulate the colors in your pictures. If you can’t get the 
results you want by using those features, you may be able to do the job using 
the RGB Adjustment filter offered by the Canon browser. In Figure 10-12, for 
example, I used the filter to tone down the amount of blue in the image and 
bring out the warm yellow tones of the building instead.
 
Original

313
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
Follow these steps to use the filter:
 
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
 
 You do this by double-clicking the image thumbnail in the main browser 
window.
 
2. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list.
 
 Look for the list above the image preview if you’re a Windows user; on a 
Mac, the list is below the preview. After you choose the command, your 
photo appears in a retouching window. Figure 10-13 shows you both the 
Windows and Mac versions of the window.
 
3. Choose RGB Adjustment.
 
 In Windows, choose the option from the drop-down list at the top of the 
window, as shown in the top image in Figure 10-13. On a Mac, just click 
the RGB Adjustment tab, as shown in the lower image. Either way, you 
gain access to three sliders: Red, Green, and Blue.
 
4. Drag the sliders to adjust image colors.
 
 
The filter is based on three color pairs: red-cyan; green-magenta; and 
blue-yellow. (Those six colors happen to be the primary and second-
ary colors of the RGB color world, which is the one in which all digital 
images reside.) When you move the sliders, you affect both the primary 
color and its secondary opposite, as follows:
 
• Red slider: As you drag the slider to the right, you increase red 
and decrease cyan. Drag the slider to the left to diminish reds and 
embolden cyans.
 
• Green slider: Drag this slider to the right to add green and reduce 
magenta. Drag to the left to produce the opposite result.
 
• Blue slider: Drag this slider to the right to increase the amount of 
blue and reduce the amount of yellow. Drag left to increase yellow 
and tone down blues.
 
 In imaging lingo, tools of this type are color balancing filters because 
they shift the balance between the two opposite colors.
 
 I used the slider settings shown in the figure for my photo.
 
5. Click OK to apply the change and close the retouching window.
 
6. Save your work in the TIFF format, as explained in the last section of 
this chapter.

Figure 10-13: Select RGB Adjustment to tweak color balance.
Adjusting Exposure
Getting exposure just right is one of the trickiest aspects of photogra-
phy. Fortunately, the Canon software gives you several tools for tweaking 
exposure. The next sections introduce the two most capable: the Level 
Adjustment filter and the Tone Curve Adjustment filter.
 
Stay away from the exposure options that appear when you open the Color 
Adjustment filter (shown in Figures 10-10 and 10-11). In Windows, the filter 
offers a Brightness and Contrast slider; on a Mac, you get just the Brightness 
slider. The problem is that both sliders affect all pixels in your image; you 
can’t brighten just the shadows, for example, without also brightening the 
midtones (areas of medium brightness) and highlights. For that reason, these 
sliders rarely produce good results.
Three-point exposure control with the 
Level Adjustment filter
With the Level Adjustment filter, you can adjust shadows, midtones, and 
highlights individually. Figure 10-14 shows the filter as it appears in Windows; 
the Mac version contains the same options in a slightly different layout.

315
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-14: The Level Adjustment tool isn’t nearly as difficult to use as it appears.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Wow, that looks way too complicated 
for me.” Trust me, though, that this filter is actually pretty easy to use. First, 
ignore everything but the graph in the middle of the box, known as a his-
togram, and the three sliders underneath, labeled Shadows, Midtones, and 
Highlights in Figure 10-15. See? Easier already.
 
Shadows
Midtones
Highlights
 
Figure 10-15: All you need to worry about are these 
 
three sliders.

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The histogram works just like the Brightness histogram that you can display 
while reviewing your images on your camera monitor, a topic that I discuss 
in Chapter 4. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible bright-
ness values in an image, ranging from black on the left side to white on the 
right. The vertical axis shows how many pixels fall at a particular brightness 
value. So if you have a tall spike, you have lots of pixels at that brightness 
value.
To adjust exposure, drag the three sliders underneath the histogram, 
depending on whether you want to shift shadows, midtones, or highlights. 
Follow these steps to try it out:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail to 
open it in a new Viewer window.
 
2. Open the Level Adjustment retouching window.
 
• In Windows: Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit 
drop-down list, found above the image preview. Then select Level 
Adjustment from the drop-down list at the top of the retouching 
window, as shown in Figure 10-14.
 
• On a Mac: Choose Level Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list, 
which appears underneath the image preview.
 
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
 
 On a Mac, the option is unlabeled; it’s the pop-up list above the 
histogram.
 
4. Drag the sliders underneath the histogram to adjust exposure.
 
• To darken shadows: Drag the Shadows slider to the right.
 
• To adjust midtones: Drag the middle slider to the right to darken 
midtones; drag it to the left to brighten them.
 
• To brighten highlights: Drag the Highlights slider to the left.
 
 When you drag the Shadows or Highlights slider, the Midtones slider 
moves in tandem. So you may need to readjust that slider after you set 
the other two.
 
 You can compare your original image with the adjusted one by toggling 
the dialog box preview on and off. In Windows, click the Show Original 
Image box to turn off the preview; click again to return to the preview. 
On a Mac, click the Preview box.
 
 I dragged the sliders to the positions shown in Figure 10-16 to produce 
the results you see in the preview.
 
5. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
 
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format.
 
 See the last section of this chapter to find out how.

 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-16: I brightened highlights and midtones but darkened shadows slightly.
Gaining more control with the 
Tone Curve Adjustment filter
With the Level Adjustment filter, you get three points of exposure-correction 
control — highlights, shadows, and midtones. The Tone Curve Adjustment 
filter takes things a step further, enabling you to manipulate specific values 
along the entire brightness spectrum.
Figure 10-17 offers a look at the Windows version of the Tone Curve 
Adjustment retouching window. The Mac version is slightly different in 
appearance, but it contains the same main components.
Again, the controls inside the window seem mighty perplexing at first. But 
here’s all you need to know to take advantage of the filter:
 
✓ See that line that runs diagonally through the white grid? That’s just 
another representation of the possible brightness values in a digital 
image. Black falls at the lower end of the line; white, at the top. (The 
shaded bars that run alongside the left and lower edges of the grid 
remind you of that orientation.) Medium brightness falls dead center on 
the line.
 
✓ To adjust exposure, click and drag at the spot on the line that corre-
sponds to the brightness value you want to change. Drag up to brighten 
the image; drag down to darken it. For example, in Figure 10-18, I dragged 
the center of the line up. The resulting curve — tone curve, in imaging 
parlance — produced the exposure change shown in the preview.

control.

319
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
✓ After a drag, a control point appears at the spot on the line you dragged 
to anchor that part of the tone curve, as shown in Figure 10-18.
 
✓ You can bend the tone curve as much as you want, in any direction you 
want. Just keep clicking and dragging to add control points. But be care-
ful — extreme curves or curves with tons of points can produce really 
ugly results and odd breaks in color and brightness. I usually aim for a 
gentle curve that has no more than six points, including the ones that 
are provided automatically at the black and white ends of the curve.
 
✓ To increase contrast, create an s-shaped curve; to decrease contrast, 
create a reverse-s shape. I used the gentle s-shaped curve, shown in 
Figure 10-19, to produce the finished mushroom photo that you see in 
the preview. The curve resulted in a slight bump in exposure to medium 
and medium bright pixels and a slight darkening of medium dark and 
dark pixels. The white and black areas of the image remain unchanged.
 
 
 
Figure 10-19: An s-shaped curve boosts contrast.
The best way to understand this filter is to try it. So take these steps:
 
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
 
 You know the drill: Just double-click the thumbnail in the main browser 
window. (See Chapter 8 if you need help.)

320
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Open the Tone Curve Adjustment retouching window.
 
• In Windows: Click the Edit drop-down list at the top of the browser 
window and choose Adjust Color/Brightness. When the retouching 
window appears, select Tone Curve Adjustment from the drop-
down list at the top.
 
• On a Mac: Click the Edit drop-down list underneath the image pre-
view and choose Tone Curve Adjustment.
 
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
 
 On a Mac, the option is the unlabeled pop-up list just above the grid.
 
4. Bend the tone curve by adding and dragging control points.
 
 See the preceding list for details on this step. If you need to delete a 
point, click it to select it and then press Delete. (The selected control 
point appears black.)
 
 
If your image doesn’t appear to change in the preview, check the status 
of the Show Original Image box. Deselect the box to turn on the dialog 
box preview.
 
5. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the retouching window.
 
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format, following the steps at the end 
of this chapter.
Sharpening Focus (Sort Of)
Have you ever seen one of those spy-movie thrillers where the good guys 
capture a photo of the villain’s face — only the picture is so blurry that it 
could just as easily be a picture of pudding? The heroes ask the photo-lab 
experts to enhance the picture, and within seconds, it’s transformed into an 
image so clear you can make out individual hairs in the villain’s mustache.
It is with heavy heart that I tell you that this kind of image rescue is pure 
Hollywood fantasy. You simply can’t take a blurry image and turn it into a 
sharply focused photo, even with the most sophisticated photo software on 
the market. There is, however, a digital process called sharpening that can 
slightly improve the apparent focus of pictures that are slightly blurry, as 
illustrated by the before and after images in Figure 10-20. Notice that I say 
“apparent” focus: Sharpening doesn’t really adjust focus but instead creates 
the illusion of sharper focus by increasing contrast in a special way.
Here’s how it works: Wherever pixels of different colors come together, the 
sharpening process boosts contrast along the border between them. The 
light side of the border gets lighter; the dark side gets darker. Photography 
experts refer to those light and dark strips as sharpening halos. You can get 
a close-up look at the halos in the right, sharpened example in Figure 10-21, 

321
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
which shows a tiny portion of the pencil image from Figure 10-20. Notice that 
in the sharpened example, the yellow side of the boundary between the pen-
cils received a light halo, and the blue side received a dark halo.

Figure 10-21: Sharpening adds light and dark halos along color boundaries.

322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
A little sharpening can go a long way toward improving a slightly soft image. 
But too much sharpening does more damage than good. The halos become 
so strong that they’re clearly visible, and the image takes on a sandpaper-like 
texture. And again, no amount of sharpening can repair a truly out-of-focus 
image, so all you do when you crank up sharpening is make matters worse.
Both the Windows and Mac versions of the Canon software offer a simple 
Sharpening tool, but the Windows version offers a second sharpening filter as 
well. First, the rudimentary sharpener, shown in its Mac incarnation in Figure 
10-22. To use this tool, just follow the usual steps: Double-click the image 
thumbnail to open it in its own Viewer window and then choose Sharpness 
from the Edit drop-down list. (See Figures 10-1 and 10-2 if you have trouble 
finding the list.) Drag the slider to the right to add sharpening and then click 
OK to finish the job.
 
 
Figure 10-22: The Mac version of the browser offers only a simple sharpening slider.
 
Windows users, however, have the option of using a more flexible sharpening 
tool, an Unsharp Mask filter. To switch to this filter, just click the Unsharp 
Mask tab at the top of the Sharpness retouching window, as shown in 
Figure 10-23.
The three sliders provided for the Unsharp Mask filter enable you to control 
where and how the sharpening halos are applied, as follows:
 
✓ Amount: This slider adjusts the intensity of the sharpening halos.
 
✓ Radius: This slider adjusts the width of the halos. Don’t go too high, or 
else the sharpening halos will become very noticeable.

323
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
✓ Threshold: With this slider, you can limit the sharpening effect just to 
high-contrast color boundaries. Try raising the value a few notches up 
from 0 when sharpening portraits to sharpen the image without adding 
unwanted texture to the skin. I used this technique to keep the surface 
of the pencils smooth in my photo while sharpening the edges between 
them.
 
Whichever sharpening filter you use, don’t forget to save the altered image in 
the TIFF file format. The last section of this chapter explains this critical part 
of the retouching process.
 
 
Figure 10-23: The Unsharp Mask filter provides three levels of sharpening control.
Shifting to AutoPilot
You may have noticed as you explored the Edit drop-down list the Auto 
Adjustment option. If you select this option, the program opens your image 
in a retouching window, as usual. Figure 10-24 shows the Windows flavor of 
the window; the Mac version is virtually identical. After the window opens, 

324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
click the Auto Adjust Image button and sit back and wait. The program ana-
lyzes your image and then makes whatever changes it deems necessary. You 
can compare the “before” and “after” views of your photo by clicking the 
Show Original Image box on and off.
 
 
Figure 10-24: Click Auto Adjust Image to see what changes the program 
 
thinks are needed.
As a rule, I don’t recommend this type of automatic image correction tool 
because it so often doesn’t produce results as good as what you can do by 
using the manual filter controls. That said, if you aren’t working on important 
images or you just don’t have the time or interest in using the more sophis-
ticated tools, go ahead and give that Auto Adjust Image button a click. If you 
don’t like what you see, click the Cancel button and do the job yourself, using 
the tricks laid out elsewhere in this chapter.
Adding Text
You know that saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Well, you can 
increase that count by adding text to your photo. You can do so as follows:
 
1. Open your photo in its own Viewer window by double-clicking the 
image thumbnail in the main browser window.
 
2. Choose Insert Text from the Edit drop-down list.

325
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 Look for the list at the top of the window if you use the Windows version 
of the program and at the bottom if you’re a Mac user. Either way, you 
see your photo in the Insert Text retouching window. Figure 10-25 gives 
you a look at the Windows version of the window. (Again, the Mac ver-
sion is virtually identical.)
 
 
Figure 10-25: You can add captions and other text information.
 
3. Click in the preview at the spot you want to add the text.
 
 In Windows, be sure that the Text tool, located under the preview, next 
to the Zoom tools, is selected before you click. After you click, a text box 
appears, as shown in the figure. At any time, you can resize the box as 
needed by dragging the little boxes that appear around its perimeter. To 
move the box (and any text inside), just drag inside the box.
 
4. Type your text.
 
 The text appears both in the image preview and in the Text area on the 
right side of the window.
 
 
To add the date and time you shot the picture, click the Import Shooting 
Date/Time button. Similarly, if you added comment text when organizing 
your pictures, clicking the Import Comment button enters that text for 
you. (You can add comments via the Comment pane that appears when 
you browse images in Preview display mode. Chapter 8 explains the 
basics of browsing images.)

326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 You can specify a font (type design), size, and color and add bold, 
underline, or italic formatting. The Antialias option smoothes the jagged 
edges that can occur when letters contain diagonal or curved lines. As a 
rule, keeping this option enabled is a good idea.
 
5. Click OK and save your edited photo as explained in the next section.
Saving Your Edited Files
Whatever retouching task you do, the last step is to save your edited picture 
file. After you click OK to close the retouching window and return to the 
Viewer window, choose File➪Save. You then see the standard Windows or 
Mac file-saving dialog box that appears when you save any type of file.
You need to take two critical steps inside the dialog box:
 
✓ Select TIFF as the file type. TIFF is an image file format that produces 
the best picture quality for saved images.
 
 Do not use JPEG as the file type. Every time you edit and save a picture 
in the JPEG format, you damage the picture quality slightly. Chapter 3 
has details on this issue. Should you need a JPEG version of your edited 
photo for online use, save it first as a TIFF file and then follow the steps 
provided in Chapter 9 to create a copy in the JPEG format.
 
✓ Type a name for the picture in the File Name box (Windows) or the 
Save As box (Mac). The filename of the original image appears automati-
cally in the box. You don’t have to change the filename — you won’t 
overwrite the original file when you save because you aren’t saving it in 
the JPEG format (and you can’t save in the Raw format). But I like to add 
a tag to the filename that indicates the status of the image — for example, 
IMG_7582 retouched, or PencilsSharpened, or the like.
After taking care of those two pieces of business, specify where you want to 
store the file as you usually do. Then click the Save button to save the file 
and close the dialog box.

Ten Special-Purpose Features 
to Explore on a Rainy Day
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of those 
late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host exclaims, “But 
wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the category of “interesting 
bonus.” They aren’t the sort of features that drive people to choose one 
camera over another, and they may come in handy only for certain users, on 
certain occasions. Still, they’re included at no extra charge with your camera, 
so check ’em out when you have a few spare moments. Who knows; you may 
discover that one of these bonus features is actually a hidden gem that pro-
vides just the solution you need for one of your photography problems.
 
Many of the features I discuss here involve Custom Functions, 
a group of 13 advanced options that you access via Setup 
Menu 3. If you’re not familiar with how to navigate the 
Custom Functions, the next section spells things out.
Changing the Function 
of the Set Button
Normally, the Set button serves a couple of func-
tions on the Rebel T1i/D500: 
 
✓ When a menu is displayed, you press the button to 
lock in menu selections.
 
✓ When the Shooting Settings screen is displayed, you press 
Set to shift to the Quick Control screen, where you can quickly 
adjust certain critical picture-taking settings. (See Chapter 1 for details 
on that technique.) 

328
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
This setup makes the most sense to me, but I would be remiss if I didn’t tell 
you that you do have the option to use the Set button for something other 
than accessing the Quick Control screen. You can use it to display the Quality 
settings, for example, or the Flash Exposure Compensation setting.
To customize the button, take these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP).
 
 You can’t adjust the performance of the Set button in the fully automatic 
exposure modes. Nor does the button perform whatever alternative 
function you may assign when the camera is set to those modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-1.
 
 This menu item enables you to customize 13 aspects of the camera’s 
performance.
 
3. Press Set.
 
 The screen should look something like the one on the right in Figure 11-1, 
at least along the bottom of the screen. What appears in the rest of the 
screen depends on which Custom Function is selected.
 
 
The Custom Functions are grouped into four categories. The category 
number and name appear in the top-left corner of the screen; the 
number of the selected function appears in the top-right corner and is 
marked with a bar at the bottom of the screen. And the blue text indi-
cates the current setting of the selected Custom Function. You also can 
see the number of the option that’s selected at the bottom of the screen, 
underneath the Custom Function number. A zero represents the default 
setting.

4. If needed, press the right or left cross key to display Custom 
Function 11.
 
 Now you should definitely see the options shown on the right in 
Figure 11-1.
 
5. Press the Set button.
 
 Now the list of options for Custom Function 11 becomes accessible, 
and a yellow highlight box appears around one of the options, as shown 
in Figure 11-2. Again, the option that appears in blue is the selected 
setting; 0 represents the default setting.
 
 If you select option 1, pressing the Set button whisks you to the screen 
where you can change the 
Image Quality setting. Option 2 
enables you to access the Flash 
Exposure Compensation screen 
instead. If you choose option 
3, pressing Set turns the moni-
tor off. Option 4 enables the Set 
button to display menus and 
option 5 disables the Set button 
altogether when no menus are 
active — but again, only for the 
advanced exposure modes.
 
6. Press the up or down cross 
keys to highlight your choice.
 
 I highlighted the Flash Exposure 
Compensation option in Figure 
11-2.
 
7. Press the Set button.
Now whenever you shoot in the advanced exposure modes and press Set 
while no menus are displayed, the button takes on the function you just 
assigned to it. To go back to the default setting, repeat these steps, and select 
option 0 in Step 6. The button then reverts to its original purpose, which is 
to bring up the Quick Control screen when the Shooting Settings screen is 
displayed.
 
In case I didn’t already make my opinion clear of which setting to use, I want 
to stress that if you choose any Set button function except the default, lots of 
instructions in this book aren’t going to work correctly.

to access Flash Exposure Compensation 
settings — but I’m not sure why you would.

Customizing Exposure and Focus Lock Options
By default, pressing your shutter 
button halfway establishes and 
locks focus when you use auto-
focusing. When you shoot in the 
advanced autoexposure modes, you 
also can lock in the exposure set-
tings the camera selects by pressing 
and holding the AE (autoexposure) 
Lock button, labeled in Figure 11-3.
You can customize the locking 
behaviors of the two buttons via 
Custom Function 10. Here’s how:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an 
advanced exposure setting.
 
 
As with all Custom Functions, 
you can take advantage of this 
option only in the P, Tv, Av, 
M, or A-DEP exposure mode. 
Additionally, the locking setup 
you specify applies only to 
those modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, high-
light Custom Functions, and 
press Set.
 
3. Select Custom Function 10.
 
 Press the right or left cross key 
to scroll through the Custom 
Functions.
 
4. Press Set to activate the list 
of settings, as shown in 
Figure 11-4.
 
 
A highlight box appears, as 
shown in the figure. The option 
that appears in blue text is the 
current setting; option 0 repre-
sents the default setting.
 
5. Press the up and down cross keys to highlight the option you want to use.
 
 You have the following four choices. (The first part of the setting name 
indicates what happens with a half-press of the shutter button; the 
second part indicates the function of the AE Lock button.)

 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
• AF/AE Lock: This is the default setting. Pressing the shutter button 
halfway establishes and locks autofocus; pressing the AE Lock 
button locks autoexposure.
 
• AE Lock/AF: With this option, pressing the shutter button halfway 
locks autoexposure instead of focus. To initiate autofocusing, you 
instead press the AE Lock button. In other words, this mode is the 
exact opposite of the default setup.
 
 
If you want to lock exposure when shooting in Live View mode, this 
is the only way to make it possible. During Live View shooting, the 
AE Lock button is normally used to autofocus, disabling the normal 
exposure-lock function. With this setting selected, you can press 
the shutter button to lock exposure and use the AE Lock button to 
set focus.
 
• AF/AF Lock, no AE Lock: This mode is designed to prevent focusing 
mishaps when you use AI Servo autofocusing, explained in Chapter 6. 
Here’s the deal: In the AI Servo mode, the autofocus motor continu-
ally adjusts focus from the time you press the shutter button half-
way until the time you actually take the image. This feature helps 
you keep moving objects sharply focused. But if something moves 
in front of your subject, the camera may mistakenly focus on that 
object, which may leave your subject blurry.
 
 To cope with that possibility, this locking option enables you to 
initiate autofocusing as usual, by pressing the shutter button half-
way. But at any time before you take the picture, you can press 
the AE Lock button to temporarily stop the autofocusing motor 
from adjusting focus if an intruder moves into the frame. When you 
release the button, the autofocusing mechanism starts up again.
 
 If you choose this option, autoexposure is set when you press the 
shutter button all the way. You can’t lock autoexposure.
 
• AE/AF, no AE Lock: Similar to the preceding mode, this one also 
is designed to help you capture moving subjects in the AI Servo 
mode. Pressing the shutter button halfway initiates autoexposure 
metering, which is adjusted continuously as needed until the time 
you snap the picture. Pressing the AE Lock button starts the auto-
focusing servo system; releasing the button stops it. You cannot 
lock autoexposure in this mode.
 
6. Press the Set button to finalize your choice.
 
 Now when you shoot in an advanced exposure mode, the camera locks 
focus and exposure according to the option you selected. In the fully 
automatic modes, the settings have no effect; you still press the shutter 
button halfway to focus, and you can’t lock autoexposure.

332
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Disabling the AF-Assist Beam
In dim lighting, your camera may emit an AF (autofocus)-assist beam from 
the built-in flash when you press the shutter button halfway — assuming that 
the flash unit is open, of course. This pulse of light helps the camera “see” its 
target better, improving the performance of the autofocusing system.
If you’re shooting in a situation where the AF-assist beam may be distracting 
to your subject or to others in the room, you can disable it. Take these steps 
to control this aspect of your camera:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
 As with the other customization options discussed in preceding sec-
tions, this one is available only in these advanced exposure modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
 
 You’re taken to the main launching pad for adjusting all the Custom 
Functions.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key as needed to select Custom Function 8.
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 Now the options shown in Figure 
11-5 become accessible.
 
5. Press the up or down cross 
key to highlight your desired 
setting.
 
 Setting 1 disables the AF-assist 
beam of both the built-in flash 
and compatible Canon EX-series 
Speedlite external flash units. 
Setting 2 disables the beam of 
the built-in flash while allow-
ing the beam of a compatible 
EX-series Speedlite to function 
normally.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
 Your chosen setting affects all the advanced exposure modes. In fully 
automatic modes, the autofocus assist beam continues to light from the 
built-in flash when the camera deems it necessary.
 
Without the aid of the assist beam, the camera may have trouble autofocus-
ing in dim lighting. The easiest solution is to simply focus manually; Chapter 1 
shows you how.
Figure 11-5: You can disable the autofocus-
assist beam.

 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Enabling Mirror Lockup
One of the components involved in the optical system of an SLR camera is a 
tiny mirror that moves when you press the shutter button. The small vibra-
tion caused by the movement of the mirror can result in slight blurring of 
the image when you use a very slow shutter speed, shoot with a long tele-
photo lens, or take extreme close-up shots. To eliminate the possibility, your 
camera offers a feature called mirror lockup. When you enable this feature, 
the mirror movement is completed well before the shot is recorded, thus pre-
venting any camera shake.
To try out this feature, take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode.
 
 Mirror lockup isn’t available in 
the fully automatic exposure 
modes. So set that dial to P, Tv, 
Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight 
Custom Functions, and press 
Set.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key 
to scroll to Custom Function 9.
 
4. Press Set to access the options 
shown in Figure 11-6.
 
5. Press the up or down cross key 
to highlight the Enable option, 
as shown in the figure.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
After you enable mirror lockup, you take a slightly different approach to 
picture-taking than usual. Use this technique:
 
1. Frame your shot.
 
2. If you’re using autofocus, press and hold the shutter button halfway to 
lock focus.
 
 Or, if you prefer manual focusing, twist the focusing ring as needed to 
focus the image.
 
3. Press the shutter button all the way down to lock up the mirror. Then 
release the button.
Figure 11-6: Mirror lockup prevents camera 
shake caused by the movement of the optical 
system’s mirror.

334
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 
At this point, you can no longer see anything through the viewfinder. 
Don’t panic — that’s normal. The mirror’s function is to enable you to 
see in the viewfinder the scene that the lens will capture, and mirror 
lockup prevents it from serving that purpose.
 
4. Press the shutter button all the way again.
 
 The camera then takes the picture.
 
Using a tripod or other support is critical to getting a shake-free shot in situ-
ations that call for mirror lockup. For even more protection, set your camera 
to the 2-second self-timer mode, introduced in Chapter 2, and take your 
hands completely off the camera after you press the shutter button in Step 3. 
The picture is taken two seconds after the mirror lockup occurs. If you pur-
chased the remote-control unit for your camera, you instead can trigger the 
shutter button using it.
Adding Cleaning Instructions to Images
You’ve no doubt noticed that your camera displays a message that says 
“Sensor Cleaning” every time you turn off the camera. And when you turn on 
the camera, a little “cleaning” icon flickers in the lower-right corner of the 
Shooting Settings display. These alerts tell you that the camera is performing 
a self-maintenance step that is designed to remove from the sensor any dust 
particles that may have made their way into the camera interior.
 
If you don’t see these alerts, open Setup Menu 2, choose the Sensor Cleaning 
option, and then press Set. Next, set the Auto Cleaning option to Enable. 
(There’s really no reason to disable this feature, although Canon gives you 
the choice to do so.)
The automated sensor cleaning normally is all that’s necessary to keep the 
sensor dust-free. But if you notice that small spots are appearing consistently 
on your images, you may need to step in and take action on your own.
The best solution, of course, is to take your camera to a good repair shop 
and have the sensor professionally cleaned. I do not recommend that you 
take on this job yourself; it’s a delicate procedure, and you can easily ruin 
your camera.
Until you can have the camera cleaned, however, you can use a feature on 
Shooting Menu 2 to create a custom dust-removal filter that you can apply in 
Digital Photo Professional, which is one of the free programs that ships with 
your camera.

335
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
The first step in creating the filter is to record a data file that maps the location 
of the dust spots on the sensor. To do this, you need a white piece of paper 
or other white surface and a lens that can achieve a focal length of 55mm or 
greater. (The kit lens sold with your camera qualifies.) Then take these steps:
 
1. Set the lens focal length at 55mm or longer.
 
 If you own the kit lens, just zoom in as far as possible, which sets the 
focal length at 55mm.
 
2. Switch the camera to manual focusing.
 
 On the kit lens, move the focus switch on the lens from AF to MF.
 
3. Set focus at infinity.
 
 Some lenses have a marking that indicates the infinity position — the 
symbol looks like a number 8 lying on its side. If your lens doesn’t have 
the marking, hold the camera so that the lens is facing you and then turn 
the lens focusing ring clockwise until it stops.
 
4. Set the camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP).
 
 You can create the dust data file only in these modes.
 
5. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Dust Delete Data, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-7.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
 Now you see the Dust Delete Data message shown on the right in 
Figure 11-7.
 
 
Figure 11-7: You can record dust-removal data that can be read by Digital Photo Professional.
 
7. Press the right cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.

336
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 The camera performs its normal automatic sensor-cleaning ritual, which 
takes a second or two. Then you see the instruction screen shown on 
the left in Figure 11-8.
 
 
Figure 11-8: The Dust Delete Data is recorded when you press the shutter button all the way.
 
8. Position the camera so that it’s about 8 to 12 inches from your white 
card or piece of paper.
 
 Your card or paper needs to be large enough to completely fill the view-
finder at this distance.
 
9. Press the shutter button all the way to record the Dust Delete Data.
 
 No picture is taken; the camera just records the Dust Delete Data in its 
internal memory. If the process was successful, you see the message 
shown on the right in Figure 11-8.
 
 
If the camera tells you that it couldn’t record the data, the lighting con-
ditions are likely to blame. Make sure that the lighting is even across 
the entire surface of your white card or paper and that the paper is suf-
ficiently illuminated and then try again.
 
10. Press the Set button.
 
 The current date now appears on the initial Dust Delete Data screen 
(shown on the right in Figure 11-7).
After you create your Dust Delete Data file, the camera attaches the data to 
every subsequent image, regardless of whether you shoot in the fully auto-
matic or advanced exposure modes.
To clean a photo, open it in Digital Photo Professional and choose Tools➪
Start Stamp Tool. Your photo then appears in an editing window; click the 
Apply Dust Delete Data button to start the automated dust-busting feature. 
The program’s manual and Help system offer details about this process; look 
for the Help entry related to using the Copy Stamp tool.

Turning Off the Shooting Settings Screen
When you turn on your camera, the monitor automatically turns on and 
displays the Shooting Settings screen. At least, it does if you stick with the 
default setting selected for Custom Function 12, which bears the lengthy 
name LCD Display When Power On.
You can prevent the monitor from displaying the screen every time you 
power up the camera, if you choose. The monitor is one of the biggest drains 
on the camera battery, so limiting it to displaying information only when you 
need it can extend the time between battery charges.
 
As with other Custom Functions, this option works only when the camera is 
set to one of the advanced exposure modes — in other modes, the screen 
still appears automatically. Still, any battery savings can be helpful when 
you’re running low on juice.
To take advantage of this feature, take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP mode.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight 
Custom Functions, and press 
Set.
 
3. Use the cross keys to select 
Custom Function 12 and then 
press Set.
 
 You see the screen shown in 
Figure 11-9.
 
4. Press the up or down cross key 
to highlight Retain Power OFF 
Status.
 
5. Press Set.
 
6. Press the shutter button halfway and release it to temporarily display 
the Shooting Settings screen.
 
7. Press the DISP button to turn off the monitor.
 
8. Turn off the camera.
 
When you turn on the camera again, the monitor doesn’t automatically dis-
play the Shooting Settings screen — as long as the Mode dial is set to an 
advanced shooting mode, that is. To view the screen, press the DISP button; 
press the button again to return to monitor-off status.
Figure 11-9: You can prevent the monitor from 
turning on automatically when you power up 
the camera.

338
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Note that if you turn off the camera while the Shooting Settings screen is 
displayed, it appears again automatically the next time you power up the 
camera. So if you really want the monitor to retain its “power off status,” be 
sure to press DISP to shut off the monitor before you turn off the camera. 
Adding Original Decision Data
Now that photo editing has gone 
mainstream, determining whether a 
digital photo has been altered from 
its original state is difficult. However, 
through Custom Function 13, you 
now have a way to prove that a pic-
ture file hasn’t been edited.
If you enable this Custom Function, 
as shown in Figure 11-10, the camera 
adds to the image file a tag that veri-
fies the photo as original. There’s a 
catch, though: To make use of that 
tag when the file is opened on your 
computer, you must use a special 
piece of software, the Original Data 
Decision Security Kit OSK-E3. You can buy that product for about $650.
If you want to know more about the whole issue, visit the Canon Web site.
Creating Your Very Own Camera Menu
Canon does a good job of making it easy to change the most commonly used 
camera settings. You can access many critical options by pressing the but-
tons on the camera body, and others require only a quick trip to the camera 
menus.
To make things even simpler for you, the Rebel T1i/500D enables you to 
create your own custom menu containing up to six items from the camera’s 
other six menus. For example, I created a custom menu that contains the 
options shown in Figure 11-11. (The last item, My Menu Settings, is always on 
the menu; more about that later.) Logically enough, the custom menu goes 
by the name My Menu and is represented by the green star icon, as shown in 
the figure.
Figure 11-10: This Custom Function is relevant 
only if you buy a $650 accessory software kit.

339
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
To create your menu, take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera Mode dial to an 
advanced exposure mode.
 
 Sadly, you can create and order 
from your custom menu only in 
P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP expo-
sure modes.
 
2. Press the Menu button and dis-
play the My Menu screen.
 
 Initially, your screen shows only 
a single item, as shown on the 
left in Figure 11-12.
 
3. Highlight My Menu Settings and 
press Set.
 
 Now you see the right screen in 
Figure 11-12.
 
 
Figure 11-12: To add items to your menu, select Register and press Set.
 
4. Highlight Register and press Set.
 
 You’re presented with a scrolling list that contains each and every 
item found on the camera’s other six menus, as shown on the left in 
Figure 11-13.
 
5. Highlight the first item that you want to include on your custom menu.
 
 
If you want to add a specific Custom Function to your menu, scroll past 
the item named Custom Functions to find and highlight the individual 
function. (The item named Custom Functions simply puts the Custom 
Functions menu item on your menu, and you still have to wade through 
the multiple levels of steps to get to your function.)

menu.
 
9. Press the Menu button.
 
 You then see the My Menu screen, where the items you added to the 
menu should appear.
After creating your menu, you can further customize and manage it as 
follows:
 
✓ Give your menu priority. You can tell the camera that you want it to 
automatically display your menu anytime you press the Menu button. 
To do so, select My Menu Settings on the main My Menu screen and 
then press Set. You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-12. 
Highlight Display from My Menu and press Set. Highlight Enable and 
press Set again.
 
✓ Change the order of the list of menu items. Once again, highlight My 
Menu Settings and press Set. Then highlight the Sort option (refer to 
the right screen in Figure 11-12) and press Set. Highlight a menu item, 
press Set, and then use the up or down cross keys to move the item up 
or down in the list. Press Set to glue the menu item in its new position. 
Press Menu to return to the My Menu Settings screen; press Menu again 
to return to your custom menu.

341

✓ Delete menu items. Display your menu, highlight My Menu Settings, 
and press Set. Then, to delete a single item, highlight Delete and press 
Set. Highlight the menu item you want to remove and press Set again. 
Highlight OK and press Set again to confirm your decision. To remove 
all items from your custom menu, choose Delete All Items (on the screen 
shown on the right in Figure 11-12), press Set, highlight OK, and press 
Set again.
Tagging Files with Your Copyright Claim
 
By using the EOS Utility software that ships with your camera, you can load 
your personal copyright data into the camera’s brain. Then, whenever you 
shoot a picture, your copyright information is recorded as part of the file’s 
metadata — the extra data that records information about your picture-
taking settings, the date, time, and so on. Chapter 8 shows you how to view 
metadata for pictures in Canon ZoomBrowser (Windows) and ImageBrowser 
(Mac); Figure 11-14 shows you where to look for the copyright information.
 
Copyright information
 
 Figure 11-14: Tagging your files with your copyright notice lets people know who owns the 
rights to the picture.

342
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
What’s the point, exactly? Well, including a copyright notice is a reasonable 
first step to take if you want to prevent anyone from using your pictures 
without your permission. Anyone who views your picture in a program that 
can display metadata will see your copyright notice and know who owns the 
rights to the picture. Obviously, that won’t be enough to completely prevent 
unauthorized use of your images. And technically speaking, you hold the 
copyright to your photo whether you take any steps to mark it with your 
name. But if you ever come to the point of pressing legal action against the 
perpetrator, you can at least show that you did your due diligence in letting 
people know that you hold the copyright.
The process of creating and downloading your copyright data from the EOS 
Utility software to your camera isn’t complicated, but it does involve more 
steps than I have room to cover here. So if you’re intrigued, dig through 
your camera box and dig out the CD titled “EOS Digital Software Instruction 
Manual” and then pop it into your computer’s CD or DVD drive. The CD con-
tains electronic versions of the manuals for all the programs shipped with 
your camera; look for the file that begins with the letters “EU2.” After open-
ing that file, navigate to the manual’s Chapter 2 for information about the 
copyright function. (The manuals are provided in the PDF format; if you don’t 
already have a PDF viewer on your computer, you can download a free one, 
Adobe Acrobat Reader, from www.adobe.com.)
If you tag your files with copyright data, you can later disable the tagging, if 
necessary, through the Clear Settings option on Setup Menu 3. Your camera 
manual has details on that part of the process.
Getting Free Help and Creative Ideas
Okay, so this last tip is a bit of a cheat: It isn’t actually found on your camera, 
but it will help you better understand the features that are. I speak of the 
Canon Web site, which you can access at www.canon.com.
If you haven’t yet visited the site, I encourage you to do so. In the Support 
section of the site, you can get free technical support for camera problems 
and even download an electronic copy of your camera manual, should you 
happen to misplace the one that came with your camera. Most importantly, 
check periodically to make sure that your camera is running the latest firm-
ware, which is the geekspeak term for the camera’s internal software.
Be sure to also check out the Learning Center section of the site. There, you 
can find loads of tutorials and other great instructional offerings not only 
about your camera but also about the software that ships with it
