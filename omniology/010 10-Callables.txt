What are callables?
any object that can be called using the () operator
like functions and methods
but it goes beyond just those two…
many other objects in Python are also callable
To see if an object is callable, we can use the built-in function: callable
callable(print) →True
callable('abc'.upper) →True
callable(callable) →True
callable(str.upper) →True
callables always return a value
callable(10) →False

Different Types of Callables
built-in functions
print
len
callable
built-in methods
a_str.upper
a_list.append
user-defined functions
created using def or lambda expressions
methods
functions bound to an object
classes
MyClass(x, y, z)
→
__new__(x, y, z)
→
__init__(self, x, y, z)
→returns the object (reference)
→creates the new object
class instances
if the class implements __call__ method
generators, coroutines, asynchronous generators
