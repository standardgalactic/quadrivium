Preface
Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Simple Diﬀerential Equations I, cf. also Calculus 1a,
Functions of One Variable. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution strategy I have
as far as possible structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Some theorems constantly applied in the following

Some theorems constantly applied in the following
Theorem 1.1 Solution by separation. Consider a diﬀerential equation of the form
(1) dx
dt = f(t)g(x),
(t, x) ∈I1 × I2,
where f : I1 →R and g : I2 →R are both continuous functions, and where g(x) ̸= 0 for every x ∈I2.
The complete solution of (1) is given by

dx
g(x) =

f(t) dt + c,
where c ∈R is some en arbitrary constant.
Informally we write (1) in the following form (divide by g(x) ̸= 0 and “multiply” by dt)
dx
g(x) = f(t) dt.
Here, x and dx only occur on the left hand side, while t and dt only occur on the right hand side. For
that reason we say that the variables can be separated.
Theorem 1.2 Solution of a linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order. Consider an equation of the
form
(2) dx
dt + p(t) x = q(t),
t ∈I,
where the functions p(t) and q(t) are both continuous in the interval I.
The complete solution of the diﬀerential equation (2) is given by
(3) x(t) = e−P (t)

eP (t)q(t) dt + c

,
t ∈I, and where c ∈R are arbitrary
Here we have put
P(t) =

p(t) dt.
When q(t) = 0 in (2), the diﬀerential equation is called homogeneous. When q(t) ̸= 0 in (2), the
diﬀerential equation is called inhomogeneous. Homogeneous equations are usually easier to solve than
inhomogeneous ones. Therefore, one often starts by ﬁrst solving the homogeneous equation, e.g. by
(3),
x(t) = c · e−P (t),
t ∈I,
c ∈R arbitrary,
where as before P(t) =

p(t) dt.
The following theorem follows from the linearity:
Theorem 1.3 The complete solution of (2) is obtained by adding all the solutions of the corresponding
homogeneous equation to any solution of the inhomogeneous equation.

Separation of the variables
Example 2.1 Find ths solution x = f(t) of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = 5t
x ,
x > 0,
t ∈R,
for which f(0) = 1.
A. The equation is a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, in which the variables can be separated:
dx
dt = ϕ(t) ψ(t),
x > 0,
t ∈R,
where
ϕ(t) = 5t
and
ψ(x) = 1
x,
and where the initial value is f(0) = 1.
D. The equation is solved by separation of the variables, e.g. by an application of theorem 1.1. I shall
here give two variants of solution. They both start by determining the complete solution.
I. First solution. Here we apply theorem 1.1.
Since ψ(x) = 1
x ̸= 0 for every x > 0, we get

The complete solution is given by
x2
2 = 5
2 t2 + c,
x > 0,
c ∈R,
t ∈Ic,
where the condition x > 0 implies that every t ∈Ic must satisfy
5
2 t2 + c > 0.
Hence, the solutions can also be written in the form
x2 = 5t2 + 2c,
x > 0,
c ∈R,
t ∈Ic,
where c ∈R is an arbitrary constant, and Ic is the corresponding domain.

Figure 1: The solution for which f(0) = 1, including its asymptotes.
For t = 0 we get x = 1, i.e. c = 1
2, and this particular solution is given by
x2 = 5t2 + 1,
x > 0,
t ∈R.
When we rewrite this as
x2 −

2
= 1,
x > 0,
t ∈R,
we see that its graph is an hyperbolic branch in the upper half plan with the asymptotes
x = ±
√
5 t. The solution is also written
x = f(t) =

5t2 + 1,
t ∈R,
where we exploit that x > 0.
Second solution. A small rearrangement of the equation. When we multiply the equation by
2x, we get by the rules of calculation that

hence by an integration,
x2 = 5t2 + c,
x > 0,
c ∈R,
t ∈Ic,
where c ∈R is an arbitrary constant, and where every t ∈Ic satisﬁes the condition 5t2 + c > 0.
For the particular solution we get c = 1, when t = 0. Thus we get x2 = 5t2 + 1 under the
constraint that x > 0, i.e. an hyperbolic branch in the upper half plane, cf. the ﬁgure. Since
x > 0, we also have
x = f(t) =

5t2 + 1,
t ∈R.
C. Test: When x = f(t) =
√
5t2 + 1, t ∈R, it is obvious that
f(0) =

5 · 02 + 1 = 1,
so the initial condition is satisﬁed.
Furthermore
dx
dt = 1

and we have checked the solution.
Finally, x = f(t) ≥1 > 0 for every t ∈R, and we have proved all conditions in the example.
Example 2.2 . Find the solution x = f(t) of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = 4t √x,
x > 0,
t ∈R,
for which f(2) = 1. Find in particular the domain of the solution.
A. The equation is a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation in which the variables can be separated:
dx
dt = ϕ(t) ψ(x),
x > 0,
t ∈R,
where
ϕ(t) = 2r
and
ψ(x) = 2√x,
and where the initial condition is f(2) = 1.
D. The equation can either be solved by the method of separation of the variables, e.g. by applying
theorem 1.1, or by a small trick. The constant follows from the initial condition. Finally, discuss
the domain.

When (t, x) = (2, 1), we get c =

from which by an integration
√x = t2 + c,
t ∈Ic,
where the interval Ic is determined by t2 + c > 0 (because x > 0) and 2 ∈Ic. The rest is done
like in the First solution.
C. Now let
x =

Then we get in this interval that
√x = |t2 −3| = t2 −3 > 0.

Example 2.3 . Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = 4t√x,
x > 0,
t ∈R.
Indicate in particular those functions which are solutions for every t ∈R. Draw in a (t, x) coordinate
system the solution curves which go through the following points:
(1)
(t, x) = (0, 1),
(2)
(t, x) = (1, 1),
(3)
(t, x) = (
√
2, 1).
A. The diﬀerential equation is the same as the diﬀerential equation in Example 2.2, so we can reuse
the former solution. Here we shall discuss the domain.
D. Either retrieve the complete solution of Example 2.2, or repeat one of the variants from I. in
Example 2.2. Then ﬁnd the constants c ∈R, for which Ic = R.
I. We choose of course here to reuse the complete solution from Example 2.2, i.e.
√x = t2 + c,
t ∈Ic,
x > 0,
where Ic is a connected subset of the set of points t, for which t2 + c > 0. Therefore, if Ic = R, we
must have t2 + c > 0 for every t ∈R, i.e. c > 0.
When this is the case, we get
x =

t2 + c

t ∈R,
c > 0.

Example 2.4 . Find the solution x = f(t) of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = x
2
3 sin t,
t ∈R,
x ∈R,
for which f(0) = 1.
A. The equation is a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, in which the variables can be separated,
dx
dt = ϕ(t) ψ(x),
t ∈R,
x ∈R,
where
ϕ(t) = sin t
and
ψ(x) = x
2
3 ,
and where the initial condition is f(0) = 1.
Now, ψ(x) = x
2
3 is 0 for x = 0, so we must assume that x ̸= 0, which shows that there is a latent
possibility of an unpleasant discussion of the domain.
D. We solve the equation by the method of separation of the variables, either by means of theorem 1.1
or by some manipulation. The constant is then determined from the initial condition. Finally we
must go through the discussion of the domain.
I. First solution. Application of theorem 1.1.
Since ψ(x) = x

F(t) =

ϕ(t) dt =

sin t dt = −cos t.
The solution is then implicitly given by
3 x
1
3 = −cos t + c,
x ̸= 0,
supplied with the trivial solution x = 0, and strictly speaking, also every diﬀerentiable compo-
sitions of such solutions for x = 0, if such compositions exist. This is, however, a very diﬃcult
discussion, which I shall leave out here.
When (t, x) = (0, 1), we get 3 = −1 + c, i.e. c = 4, and the solution is determined by
3 x
1
3 = 4 −cos t > 0,
t ∈R,
because the right hand side clearly is positive for every t ∈R. This will give us the solution
x =

t ∈R,
which immediately is seen to be periodic of period 2π.

e−x = t2 + c

c ∈R,
t ∈Ic,
where each t ∈Ic must satisfy the condition t2 + c > 0.
When (t, x) = (2, −ln 3), we get c = −1, i.e. the solution is implicitly given by
e−x = t2 −1

By taking the logarithm and changing the sign we get the explicit solution

When t = 2 is put into the expression of x, we get
x(2) = −ln(22 −1) = −ln 3,
and we see that the initial condition is also satisﬁed.
We have checked our solution.
Example 2.8 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
dx

t ∈

.
A. The equation can either be solved by separating the variables, or as a linear equation of ﬁrst order,
where we have a solution formula. Finally it can be solved by the nasty trick of ﬁrst dividing by
cos t and then manipulate the result in a clever way.
D. Choose one of the solution methods mentioned above.
I. First solution. Separation and theorem 1.1.
Rewrite the equation in the following way
dx
dt = −x tan t = ϕ(t) ψ(x),
where
ϕ(t) = −tan t
and
ψ(x) = x.
Then x = 0 is trivially a solution, and we see that when x ̸= 0, then ψ(x) ̸= 0.
For x ̸= 0 we get

According to theorem 1.1 the complete solution is for x ̸= 0 given by
ln |x| = ln cos t + k,
x ̸= 0,
k ∈R,
t ∈Ik,
hence
|x| = ek cos t > 0,

None of these solutions takes on the value 0, so we have no composition problems. Since x = 0,
corresponding to c = 0, is also a solution, the complete solution is given by
x = c · cos t,
c ∈R,
t ∈

−π

Second solution. Reformulation followed by an integration.
It follows trivially from
dx

that x = 0 is a solution.
Now, cos t > 0 for t ∈

Hence by an integration,
ln |x| = ln cos t + k,
i.e. by the exponential function
|x| = ek cos t,
or
x = ±ek cos t.
Since every real number c can either be written as ±ek for some k ∈R or as 0, and since c = 0
corresponds to the solution x = 0, the complete solution must be given by
x = c · cos t,
c ∈R,
t ∈

hence by integration,

The requirement of the domain is that

Linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order
Example 3.1 . Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt + x = t,
t ∈R.
A. The equation is a linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
D. The equation can either be solved by the formulæ in theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3, or by a
multiplication by an “integrating factor” et followed by an integration.
I. First solution. Application of theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3.
Since p(t) = 1, we get
P(t) =

p(t) dt = t,
and hence the complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation becomes
x = c · e−t,
t ∈R,
c ∈R.
Since q(t) = t, a particular solution is given by
x
=
e−P (t)

eP (t) q(t) dt = e−t

et · t dt
=
e−t

et · t −

et dt


et · t −et
= t −1.
Variant. If we guess the structure x = at + b of the solution, we get by insertion (i.e. by
testing) that
dx
dt + x = a + (at + b) = at + (a + b) = t,
which is fulﬁlled for a = 1 and b = −1. Thus a particular solution is given by x = t −1.
According to theorem 1.3 the complete solution is then
x = t −1 + c · e−t,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.
Second solution. When the equation is multiplied by et and the result is read from the right
towards the left, we get by a small reformulation that
t et = et dx
dt + etx = et dx
dt + d
dt

et
· x = d

where we apply the rule of diﬀerentiation of a product. The equation

x et
= t et
is then solved by an integration:
x et =

t et dt = t et −

et dt = (t −1)et + c,
hence
x = t −1 + c · e−t,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.

Example 3.2 Find the solution x = f(t) of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt + 1
t x = −2t2,
t > 0,
for which f(1) = −1.
A. A linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
D. The equation can either be solved by using theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3, or by a small trick where
one multiplies by t and reformulates the equation to a form which can be directly integrated.
I. First solution. Application of theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3.
From p(t) = 1
t , t > 0, and q(t) = −2t2, we get
P(t) =
 1
t dt = ln t,
t > 0,
hence the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c · e−ln t = c
t ,
c ∈R,
t > 0.
A particular solution is given by
x

t

t · (−2t2) dt

t · 1
4 t4 = −1
2 t3.
Then according theorem 1.3 the complete solution is
x = −1
2 t3 + c
t ,
c ∈R,
t > 0.
Alternatively we know that both diﬀerentiation and division by t > 0 will lower the degree
of a polynomial without a constant term by 1. In order to ﬁnd a particular solution it will
therefore be reasonable to guess a polynomial of degree 2+1 = 3. Therefore, let x = a t3. Then
dx
dt + 1
t x = 3a t2 + a t2 = 4a t2 = −2t2,
from which a = −1
2, and x = −1
2 t3 is a particular solution.

by a small reformulation that

t dx

A. A non-normed linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order. Notice that t < 0.
D. Here we have several possible methods of solution:
1) Norm the equation and solve by means of the formula in theorem 1.2.

Third solution. Guess a polynomial.
If x is a non-constant polynomial then both t dx
dt and 2x are polynomials of the same degree.
It is therefore quite reasonable to guess a solution of the form

x = 1
3 t5 + c · t2,
c ∈R,
t < 0,
are solutions, and according to theorem 1.3 we have at the same time found the complete
solution, because the structure of the solution is the correct one.

D. Here we have several possibilities of solution:

Example 3.6 Given the diﬀerential equation

t ∈R.
1) Does the diﬀerential equation have a solution of the form x = a cos t?
2) Does the diﬀerential equation have a solution of the form x = a cos t + b sin t?
3) Find the complete solution of the equation.
A. A linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order. One is implicitly requested to guess a
particular solution followed by at determination of the complete solution.
D. Insert the given functions into the left hand side of the diﬀerential equation and analyze the
results. Alternatively one may use the solution formula.
I. 1) By insertion of x = a cos t into the left hand side of the diﬀerential equation we get
dx
dt + x = −a sint + a cos t.
If this expression should be equal to cos t, we necessarily must have that both a = 0 and a = 1,
which is not possible. Therefore, we cannot have a solution of the suggested structure a cos t.
2) By insertion of x = a cos t + b sin t into the left hand side of the diﬀerential equation we get
dx
dt + x
=
−a sin t + b cos t + a cos t + b sin t
=
(−a + b) sin t + (a + t) cos t,
which is equal to cos t for a = b = 1
2. Therefore, a particular solution is given by
x = 1
2 (cos t + sin t)

.
3) We now guess that x = e−t is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. It is
immediately seen that this is true.
Alternatively we have p(t) = 1, hence P(t) = t, and thus
x = c · e−P (t) = c · e−t.
According to theorem 1.3, the complete solution is
x = 1
2 (cos t + sin t) + c · e−t,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.
Alternatively (sketch only) we get when the equation i multiplied by et that

and the solution can then be found directly by an integration.

A. A linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order where the variables also can be sepa-
rated.
Existence and uniqueness problem.
Sketches of curves.
D. There are several possibilities of solutions:
1) Application of theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3 where one may guess a particular solution.
2) Multiplication by an integrating factor exp

−t2
followed by an integration.
3) Separation of the variables.
Investigate in particular the existence and the uniqueness.
Sketch the three graphs of solution.
I. First solution. Application of theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3.
We ﬁrst get from p(t) = −2t and q(t) = 2t that
P(t) =

p(t) dt = −

2t dt = −t2.
Thus the corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c · exp(−P(t)) = c · exp

t2
.
Then use theorem 1.2 in order to obtain a particular solution,
f(t)
=
e−P (t)

eP (t) q(t) dt = et2 
e−t2 · 2t dt
=
et2 
e−t2 d

t2
= −et2 · e−t2 = −1.
Alternatively it is immediately seen by inspection that x = −1 is a solution.
According to theorem 1.3 the complete solution is then given by
x = −1 + c · exp

t2
,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.

Second solution. When the equation is multiplied by the integrating factor exp

−t2
, we get
by the rule of diﬀerentiation of a product that
2t e−t2
=
e−t2 dx
dt −2t e−t2 x
=
e−t2 dx
dt + d
dt

e−t2
· x = d
dt

x e−t2
.
Then by an integration,
x e−t2 =

2t e−t2 dt + c = −e−t2 + c,
hence by a multiplication by et2 ̸= 0,
x = −1 + c · et2,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.
Third solution. Separation of the variables.
It follows from
dx
dt = 2tx + 2t = 2t(x + 1)
that the variables can be separated. Then it follows immediately that x = −1 is a solution.
When x ̸= −1 we can divide the equation by x + 1, whence
1
x + 1
dx
dt = d
dt ln |x + 1| = 2t.
Then an integration gives
ln |x + 1| = t2 + k,
k ∈R,
i.e. |x + 1| = ek et2, k ∈R. Then note that the sign of x + 1 can be built into the constant
c = ±ek, and that c = 0 corresponds to the solution x = −1, so we conclude that the complete
solution is
x = −1 + c et2,
c ∈R,
t ∈R.
C. Putting x = −1 + c et2, we get
dx
dt −2tx = 2txet2 + 2t −2tcet2 = 2t,
and we have checked our solution.
I. Let us now turn to the question of existence and uniqueness. We shall then get a new series
of (local) A., D., and I. (ﬁrst analysis, then choice of method of solution, and ﬁnally the
implementation of the solution):
I A. Let x = −1 + c · et2, c ∈R, t ∈R. The task is to show that there to any (t, x) = (a, b)
exists precisely one c ∈R, such that b = −1 + c · ea2.
I D. Solve the equation b = −1 + c · ea2 with respect to c for given (a, b).

I I. From b = −1 + c · ea2 we get
c = e−a2(b + 1),
which shows that the solution c exists and is uniquely determined.
I. Sketches of curves for x = −1 + c · et2 through chosen points.
1) When (a, b) = (3, −1), it follows from the above that
c = e−a2(b + 1) = e−9(−1 + 1) = 0.
Hence the solution is x = −1.

A. A linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order. Find the complete solution.
D. 1) Check if a polynomial (it suﬃces by degree 2) is a solution.
2) Apply theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3.

hence by an integration,
x
t = c + ln t,
and the complete solution is
x = t · ln t + c · t,
t > 0,
c ∈R.
Third variant. Euler diﬀerential equation. When we multiply the equation by t > 0 we obtain
an inhomogeneous Euler diﬀerential equation,
t dx
dt −x = t.
Remark. The characterization of an Euler diﬀerential equation is that any j-th derivative of
x is multiplied by a constant times tj. ♦
The trick used on this type of equation is to guess a solution of the form x = tn and then solve
with respect to n. In the present case we get
t dx
dt −x = t · n tn−1 −tn = (n −1)tn,
since the structure of an Euler diﬀerential equation secures that the result becomes a constant
times tn.
It follows that for n = 1 we get a solution of the homogeneous equation, c · t.
Now the right hand side has the same form as a solution of the homogeneous equation. For
Euler equations the trick is to multiply by ln t, i.e. one guesses that a solution is x = c · t · ln t.
We get by insertion
dx
dt −1
t x = c · ln t + c −c · ln t = c = 1.
It is seen that we get a particular solution for c = 1, and then we conclude from theorem 1.3
that the complete solution is given by
x = t · ln t + c · t,
t > 0,
c ∈R.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Example 3.22 Prove that there exist no polynomial which is a solution of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt + x t = t2,
t ∈R.
Is it possible to ﬁnd a solution of the diﬀerential equation by applying the known solution methods?
A. A linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
What does the complete solution look like?
D. Insert a polynomial and see what happens.
Then apply theorem 1.2.
I. When x is a polynomial of degree n in t, then dx
dt is either 0 (for n = 0) or of degree n −1, and t x
is of degree n + 1. Consequently the term t x can only be balanced by a term on the right hand
side t2, when the polynomial x is of ﬁrst degree. We therefore put
x = a t + b
into the left hand side of the diﬀerential equation. Then
dx
dt + xt = a + a t2 + bt = a

t2 + 1

+ b t.
By setting the coeﬃcients of t2, resp. t, equal to each other we get a = 1 and b = 0. Unfortunately
the test
dx
dt + x t = t2 + 1 ̸= t2
shows that this expression is never equal to t2.

The functions x = h(t) and x = 0 are both solutions of the diﬀerential equation, and they both take
on the value 0 for t = 1. Why is this not a contradiction to the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem?
A. We shall prove that a diﬀerential equation may have two diﬀerent solutions going through the
same point without violating the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem.
D. Check the diﬀerentiability of h(t).
Check the diﬀerential equation.

Figure 30: The graph of the derivative h′(t).
When Δt →0 through either positive or negative numbers, we get the same limit 0 in both cases.
This means that h′(0) exists and it value is h′(0) = 0. Therefore,
h′(t) =
 2(t −1),
t ≥1,
0,
t < 1,
and it is obvious that both h(t) and h′(t) are continuous.
Since h(t) ≥0 and

for t ≥1,
0,

= 1
2 h′(t),
it follows that x = h(t) is a solution of
(8) dx
dt = 2√x,
x ≥0,
t ∈R.
On the other hand it is also obvious that x = 0 is a solution of (8) and that x = 0 trivially is 0 for
t = 1.
The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem is describing the conditions for existence and uniqueness
of solutions of diﬀerential equations of the form
dx
dt = ϕ(t) ψ(x),
t ∈J1,
x ∈J2.
The assuption in the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem is that
ψ(x) ̸= 0
for every x ∈J2.
In the case under consideration we have
ϕ(t) = 1
and
ψ(x) = 2√x.
Therefore, since ψ(x) = 2√x = 0 for x = 0, we cannot conclude that we have existence and
uniqueness when x = 0.

When the assumption of some theorem (here the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem) is not ful-
ﬁlled, it is not possible to conclude anything from this theorem, and hence it is no contradiction
that we have two solution curves going through the same point.
Remark. Arguments of the type above are in general considered as diﬃcult, and even professional
mathematicians may sometimes make an error in them. I have found a very well hidden example
in Andersen, Bohr & Petersen, Matematisk Analyse, (a famous Danish textbook) where one would
not expect to ﬁnd such a fallacy. ♦
Example 4.2 Consider the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = g −k xn,
where g and k are positive real numbers, and n is a natural number. Show that there exists a constant
solution x = K of the diﬀerential equation, and show that the graph of any other solution either lies
above or below the straight line x = K.
A. A nonlinear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order, where the variables can be separated. Are there
any constant solutions? Where are the graphs of the other solutions?
D. Put x = K and then solve with respect to K. Divide into the two cases of n even and n odd.
Apply the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem in order to conclude how the other solutions behave
compared with the constant solution.
I. Remark. When x satisﬁes g −k · x2 ̸= 0, we get by a separation of the variables that
1
g −k · xn
dx
dt = 1,
hence by an integration,

dx
g −k · xn = t + c.
When g and k and n are given numbers, we can er in principle calculate the integral by ﬁrst
decomposing the integrand. Unfortunately, we get by this procedure the inverse function, i.e. we
get t as a function of x. It is not a simple task afterwards to ﬁnd x as a function of t, when n ̸= 1.
This is the reason why one is not asked to ﬁnd the complete solution, and the example should
rather demonstrate how one by some theoretical theorems is able to conclude something about the
structure of the solutions. ♦
When we put x = K into the diﬀerential equation we get 0 = g −k · Kn, hence
Kn = g
k > 0.
Then we split the investigation into the cases of n even/odd.
1) When n = 2m + 1 is odd, we get one solution,

In both cases we have dx
dt = 0.
Obviously f(x) = g −k · xn is continuous, so we have to go through the following discussion of the
slopes of the solution curves. Again we shall split into n odd/even.

Is the following claim correct or wrong: Whenever x1(t) and x2(t), t ∈R are any two solutions of

A. Linear homogeneous/inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
D. It is possible to set up a solution formula for the complete solution. However, the integrations can-
not be carried out, so the solutions cannot be expressed by known elementary functions. This does
not matter here, because this is not what the task is about. We shall instead argue theoretically
on the expression of the solution.

et2 = 1

hence by an integration,
ln |x| = k +

et2 dt,
and the complete solution is therefore then

et2 dt

c ∈R,
with only one parameter c ∈R.
Alternatively we apply the solution formula which of course will give the same expression.
It can be proved that the integral

et2 dt cannot be expressed by known elementary functions.
However, an exact expression of the function is not necessary for the following discussion.
Since the equation is homogeneous, we obviously ﬁnd that if
x1(t) = c1 · exp

et2 dt


x2(t) = c2 · exp

et2 dt

are solutions, then
x(t) = x1(t) + x2(t) = (c1 + c2) · exp

et2 dt

is also a solution of the homogeneous equation, so the claim is correct.

which cannot either be expressed by means of known elementary functions.
The complete
solution again only depends on one parameter c ∈R.
Since the equation is inhomogeneous, the latter claim is wrong. Just let x1(t) and x2(t) be
solutions of the equation, which here is written in the equivalent form
dx
dt −et2 x = 1.
Then by an insertion of x(t) = x1(t) + x2(t) we get that

Since x1 and x2 were any solutions of the inhomogeneous equation it follows that the claim is
not true for any pair of solutions (x1, x2).

and we have proved the ﬁrst claim.
Of course we have not given a new proof of theorem 1.2. We have only shown that (12) describes
some solutions of (11). We are still missing the proof of that we get all solutions in this way. This
requires another argument.
Example 4.5 Does there exist a diﬀerential equation of the form
(13) dx
dt + p(t) x = q(t),
t ∈I,
which has the functions
x = t2,
t ∈R,
and
x = t3,
t ∈R,
as two of its solutions?
A. Given solutions of an unknown linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Insert the two given functions into (13), i.e.
dx
dt + p(t) x = q(t),
and try to identify p(t) and q(t).
I. When we insert x = t2, resp. x = t3, into the diﬀerential equation we get
x = t2 :
2t + t2 p(t) = q(t),
i.e.
2t2 + t3p(t) = t q(t),
x = t3 :
3t2 + t3p(t) = q(t),
i.e.
3t2 + t3p(t) = q(t),
hence by a subtraction, t2 = (1 −t)q(t), so
q(t) =
t2
1 −t,
t ̸= 1,
and 3t2 −2t + (t3 −t2)p(t) = 0, thus
p(t) = 2t −3t2
t3 −t2 = t(2 −3t)
t2(t −1) = 2 −3t
t(t −1),
for t ̸= 0, 1.
We derive that a candidate of the unknown diﬀerential equation is
dx
dt + 2 −3t
t(t −1) x =
t2
1 −t,
for t ̸= 0, 1.

It follows from this that there does not exist any equation of the form (13) for t ∈R, because
we must assume that t ̸= 0 and t ̸= 1. On the other hand, we obtain something acceptable if we
multiply the equation by t(t −1). Then
t(t −1) dx
dt + (2 −3t) x = −t3,
t ∈R,
which is deﬁned in the whole of R.
If we have “solved” the problem can only be decided by the
C. Test. If x = t2, then the left hand side is
t(t −1) dx
dt + (2 −3t) x
= t(t −1) · 2t + (2 −3t) · t2 = 2t3 −2t2 + 2t2 −3t3 = −t3,
and we see that x = t2 is a solution of the found diﬀerential equation.
When x = t3 we get for the left hand side
t(t −1) dx
dt + (2 −3t) x
= t(t −1) · 3t2 + (2 −3t) · t3 = 3t4 −3t3 + 2t3 −3t4 = −t4,
so x = t3 is also a solution of the modiﬁed equation.
Conclusion: There exists no equation of the form (13), deﬁned for every t ∈R, such that x = t2
and x = t3 both are solutions.
However, if we exclude the two points t = 0 and t = 1, or
alternatively multiply the candidate by t(t−1), then we get a modiﬁed equation which has the
two solutions for t ̸= 0 og t ̸= 1.

The complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous y-equation is seen by inspection to
be c · et. Another simple inspection gives that y = 1 is a particular solution. According to
theorem 1.3 the complete solution of the y-equation is given by
y = 1 + c · et,
c ∈R,
y > 0,
t ∈Ic,
where every t ∈Ic satisﬁes the condition 1 + c · et > 0.

Since c = 0 corresponds to the trivial solution x = 1, we can allow c ∈R.

i.e.

Example 5.3 Consider a diﬀerential equation of the form
(14) dx
dt + p(t) x = q(t) xα,
x > 0,
t ∈R,
where α is a real constant. Show that if we put y = x1−α, then (14) is transferred into a linear
diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order in the unknown function y, and specify this equation.
A. Solution formula for a general Bernoulli diﬀerential equation. A method of solution is sketched.
This method does not work for α = 1, because then y ≡1. But when α = 1, we see that (14) is
linear, so it is possible to apply another and simpler method.
Note also that when α = 0 we can either use the method indicated above, or we can consider
the equation as a linear and inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order, i.e. we can use the
usual solution formula. When α = 0 we therefore can choose between two methods, of which the
latter is the easiest one to apply.
D. Follow the sketched method under the condition that α ̸= 1.
I. Let α ∈R \ {1}. If x > 0, then
y = x1−α > 0
and
x = y
1
1−α .
By insertion into (14) we get after a rearrangement,

Since

we see that (5.3) is equivalent to the linear and inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order
(15) dy
dt + (1 −α) p(t) y = (1 −α) q(t),
y > 0,
y = x1−α.
♦
Remark. In practice it is easiest to solve (14) by ﬁrst dividing by the unpleasant expression xα
and then reduce. It follows from
1

dx
dt =

that y = x1−α is a very natural new variable, so in this case we do not have to remember the

2) Find the complete solution of(17) in each of the intervals t ∈] −∞, 0[ and t ∈]0, +∞[.

g(−2) = 2. Specify in particular the deﬁnition intervals of the solutions.
4) Does (16) have any solution, which is deﬁned in a neighbourhood of t = 0?
5) Show that for every point (t0, x0) with t0 ̸= 0 there exists precisely one solution x = ϕ(t) of (16),
for which ϕ(t0) = x0.
A. A nonlinear equation of ﬁrst order of the type
a(t) dx
dt + b(t) x = c(t) xα.
When α = 0 or 1, then the equation is linear. When α ̸= 0, 1, it is called a Bernoulli diﬀerential
equation. Such an equation can always be solved. There is here indicated a solution procedure. In
the general method, which is not described explicitly, we divide by xα for x ̸= 0 and then rewrite
the equation to a diﬀerential equation in y = x1−α.

5) Show the existence and uniqueness of the solution through any point (t0, x0), where t0 ̸= 0 and

When x = g(t) where g(−2) = 2, we get
{g(−2)}2 = 4 = (−2)2 + 2c = 4 + 2c,

Therefore, any such solution curve has a vertical half tangent, when t →0 in the domain, so it

hence these solutions cannot be extended either across the vertical line t = 0.
We conclude that no composition of solutions is possible across t = 0, so no solution can be
extended across the x-axis.

The setup of model equations
Example 6.1 A thermometer has for some time been in a room of the temperature 21◦. The ther-
mometer is then taken outside, where the temperature is 3◦. After 3 minutes the thermometer shows
8◦. We assume that the speed by which the temperature of the thermometer is proportional to the
diﬀerence between the temperature of the environment and the temperature of the thermometer.
Find the temperature of the thermometer as a function of time.
For how long shall one wait until the thermometer only deviates by 1
2
◦
from the true temperature?
A. Setup of a mathematical model followed by an application of this model.
D. Analyze the text and then setup the model. Solve the model equation in the given case.
I. Let x = f(t) denote the temperature and let t denote the time measured in minutes. Thus we put
f(0) = 21,
(The thermometer is taken outside to time t = 0)
f(3) = 8,
(the thermometer is read to the time t = 3).
The velocity f ′(t), by which the temperature of the thermometer is changed is proportional (pro-
portional factor k) to the diﬀerence between the temperature of the environment, 3◦, and the
temperature of the thermometer f(t) itself, i.e. f ′(t) is proportional to 3 −f(t). This shows that
the model can be described by the diﬀerential equation
f ′(t) = k · {3 −f(t)}.
The task is now to ﬁnd the constant k and the solution x = f(t), t ≥0, where
⎧
⎪
⎨

⎩
dx
dt = −k x + 3k,
f(0) = 21,
f(3) = 8.
Since the constant k is unknown we must require two (boundary) conditions.
We ﬁrst solve the linear equation
dx
dt + k · x = 3k,
t ≥0.
We just guess x = e−k t as a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation and x = 3 as a
particular solution. (This should not be too surprising.)
By theorem 1.3 the complete solution is then
(18) x = f(t) = 3 + c · e−k t,
t ≥0.
The two constants c and e−k are then found from:
21 = f(0) = 3 + c,
8 = f(3) = 3 + c · e−3k.

which is precisely the diﬀerential equation of the model.
Thus our solution is correct.
Example 6.2 Let x(t) denote the population of a country at time t. We assume that the population
increase Δx in a short interval of time is (approximately) proportional to the length of this interval
of time Δt as well as to the population x(t) by the start of this short interval of time,
Δx = k · x(t) · Δt,
where k is some given factor of proportionality.
1) Set up a diﬀerential equation which describes x(t).
2) Assume that the population is doubled in 50 years. When will the population be tripled?
A. 1) Setting up a mathematical model.
2) Apply the model in a speciﬁc given situation.
D. 1) Analyze the text in order to set up the diﬀerential equation.
2) Find the constant from the given addition condition and then solve the solution with respect
to time.
I. 1) Let f(t) denote the number of inhabitants to time t. Then the increase of population
Δf(t) = f(t + Δt) −f(t)
in a small interval of time of length Δt > 0 is proportional (with some unknown factor k) to
the length Δt of the time interval and the number f(t) of inhabitants, i.e.
f(t + Δt) −f(t) ≈k · Δt · f(t),
where we can replace ≈by =, if we add a term of the type o(Δt) on the right hand side.
A division by Δt > 0 followed by taking the limit Δt →0 then gives
lim
Δt→0
f(t + Δt) −f(t)
Δt
= f ′(t) = k · f(t),
which means that the model of the increase of the population under the given circumstances can
be described by the linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order (we write x = f(t))
with constant coeﬃcients,
dx
dt = k · x,
x > 0,
t ∈R.
The complete solution of this equation is
x = c · ek t,
c > 0,
t ∈R.

2) Let c > 0 be the number of inhabitants at time t = 0 years. The assumption that the population
is doubled in 50 years can then be written
f(50) = c · e50 k = 2c,
hence
k = 1
50 ln 2
(≈0, 0139).
By choosing this k in the following, we then want to ﬁnd t, such that
f(t) = c ek t = 3c.
This is easy. We ﬁnd k t = ln 3, i.e.
t = 1
k ln 3 = 50 · ln 3

Example 6.3 A vertical cylindric tank of radius R and height h0 is ﬁlled with water. At time t = 0
a circular hole of radius r is opened in the bottom of the tank, and the water pours out under the
gravitational pull. If h(t) denotes the height of the water inside the tank at time t, then we can derive

A. In this case the diﬀerential equation is given so we shall not derive it. It is a nonlinear equation
of the type, where we can separate the variables.
D. Solve the diﬀerential equation by separation for the initial condition h(0) = h0.
I. Let x = h(t) ≥0 denote the height of the water column to time t ≥0, measured from the bottom.

Example 6.4 A rope is wound round a tree. The ends of the rope are aﬀected by the two forces S1
and S2. We shall in the following assume that S1 is a constant and that the rope is at rest and that the
slightest increase of S2 will make the rope slide. The corresponding force S2 is an increasing function
of the angle θ, by which the rope is wound round the tree, S2 = S2(θ). It can be shown that S2 is
determined by the diﬀerential equation
dS2
dθ = μ S2,
where μ is a constant, which is determined by the pair of materials (rope,tree). We shall assume that
μ = 0, 2 rad−1. How much of the rope must be wound round the tree, if S1 is in equilibrium with a
force S2 which is 100 times as big?
A. We have given a diﬀerential equation with an initial condition. One shall ﬁnd
θ
2π ≥0 (where 1
winding around the tree is put equal to 2π rad), such that S(θ) = S2, where S2 = 100 S1.
D. Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation and then solve the equation
S(θ) = S2 = 100 S1
with respect to θ. The number of windings is then θ

I. The solution of

is by inspection
S(θ) = S1 eμ θ.
Then we shall solve the equation
S1 eμ θ = S2 = 100 S1
with respect to θ, i.e.
θ = 1
μ ln 100 = 5 · 2 ln 10 = 10 ln 10 rad.
Since 1 winding round the tree corresponds to 2π radians, we shall wind the rope

Example 6.5 When one inﬂates a tyre of an automobile the valve of the tyre is connected with a
container which contains compressed air. We shall in the following assume that the pressure in the
container is constant during the inﬂation.
The pressure of the tyre p measured in kPa is described as a function in time t, measured in seconds.
During the inﬂation, the pressure of the tyre increases in such a way that the velocity by which it
increases is proportional to the diﬀerence of the pressures of the container and the tyre. Assume that
the factor of proportionality is 0.02 (in general this constant depends among other things of the volume
of the tyre and of the air resistance in the valve), and that the pressure in the container is 1000 kPa.
1) Formulate the assumption above concerning the increase of the pressure of the tyre p(t) by means
of p′(t), and derive a diﬀerential equation for p(t).
2) How long time will it take to inﬂate a ﬂat tyre, i.e. a tyre in which the pressure is 1 atm. = 101
kPa, until the pressure is 190 kPa?
A. 1) Set up a model.
2) Solve the found diﬀerential equation in a special case.
D. 1) Analyze the text above in order to formulate a diﬀerential equation for the pressure of the tyre
p(t). Since we later shall solve (2) we shall ﬁnd the complete solution.
2) In the given case one shall set up the initial condition for the diﬀerential equation. Solve the
initial value problem and ﬁnd t for the ﬁnal condition.

I. 1) The change p′(t) of the pressure of the tyre is assumed to be proportional (with the factor

In other words:
p′(t) = 0, 02 · {1000 −p(t)} = 20 −1
50 p(t),
which can be written as the linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order with constant coeﬃcients,

Example 6.6 Consider an ideal gas in a container of ﬁxed volume v0. (For an ideal gas we have that
the pressure = volume × temperature).
(A) The gas is heated in such a way that the increase of the temperature in a small time interval
is proportional to the length of the time interval and to the temperature at the start of the time
interval.
1) Set up a diﬀerential equation for the temperature T(t) to any time t. We denote the proportional
factor by k and it will here be considered as known.
2) Assume that the pressure of the gas by this heating is doubled in 5 minutes. How many minutes
will it take to treble the pressure? (Start by ﬁnding k).
(B) Then assume that the gas is heated in such a way that the increase of the temperature in a small
time interval is proportional to the length of the time interval and to the square of the temperature
at the start of the time interval.
3. Assume that the pressure of the gas in this heating to the time t = 0 is p = 1 atm., and to the
time t = 5 minutes is p = 6 atm. Assuming the present model, when will the container surely
have been blown up, no matter haw big v0 is?
A. Two separate tasks A and B, of which A contains two questions and B one.
(A) 1) Set up of a mathematical model.
2) Use the ideal gas equation to ﬁnd the time, when the pressure is trebled.
(B) A latent new setup of a model (one may expect a nonlinear diﬀerential equation).
3. One should be surprised the ﬁrst time one reads the claim, until one notices that the equation
is nonlinear. We may expect a vertical asymptote for the solution p(t) for some ﬁnite t = t0,
for which the container certainly has blown up.
D. (A) 1) Analyze the text in order to set up a diﬀerential equation for T(t).
2) Exploit p(t) = v0 · T(t) to set up an equation in p(t). The constant is found by means of
an additional condition. Finally, solve the new equation, this time with respect to t.
(B) 3. Analyze the text in order to set up a diﬀerential equation for T(t). Apply the same method
as in (2), and check the domain of the solution p(t).
I. Let p(t) > 0 denote the pressure and T(t) > 0 the absolute temperature to time t. By the equation
of an ideal gas we get
p(t) = v0 · T(t),
v0 > 0 constant.
(A) 1) The increase of the temperature T(t + Δt) −T(t) is proportional (factor k) to the length
of the time interval Δt > 0 and to the temperature T(t) at the start of the time interval,
i.e.
T(t + Δt) −T(t) ≈k · Δt · T(t).
Dividing by Δt ̸= 0 followed by the limit Δt →0+ we get
lim
Δt→0+
T(t + Δt) −T(t)
Δt
= T ′(t) = k · T(t).

Therefore, the diﬀerential equation becomes
T ′(t) = k · T(t)
with the complete solution
T(t) = c · ekt,
t ∈R,
c > 0.
2) Since T(t) = 1
v0
· p(t), the corresponding diﬀerential equation of p(t) is
p′(t) = k · p(t)
with the complete solution
p(t) = cv0 · ekt,
t ∈R,
c > 0.
The time is measured in minutes, so the conditions become
p(0) = cv0,
p(5) = 2p(0),
i.e.
cv0 · e5k = 2cv0,
thus e5k = 2, and we get k = 1
5 ln 2.
The next task is to use this k to ﬁnd t of the equation
p(t) = cv0 · exp
1
5 ln 2 · t

= 3p(0+) = ccv0.
It is immediately seen that exp
1
5 ln 2 · t

= 3 has the solution
t = 5 · ln 3
ln 2 ≈8 minutes.
(B) The setup of the model is done in precisely the same way as in (1). The only diﬀerence is that
T(t) on the right hand side is replaced by {T(t)}2. Therefore, the model equation becomes in
this case
T ′(t) = k · {T(t)}2.
3. When T(t) = 1

p′(t) = k

Thus the general solution is

Since obviously p(t) →+∞for t →6−, we conclude under the assumption that the model
is correct that the container has exploded earlier than the time t = 6 minutes.

Example 6.7 Consider a ball shaped lump of ice, which is melting with a velocity which is proportional
to the area of the surface of the ball. (The proportional factor is denoted by −k, k > 0, and we assume
here that k is known). We assume that the lump of ice is ball shaped through the whole of the melting
process. Let V (t) denote the volume of the lump of ice at time t.
1) Find the surface area of a ball as a function of its volume V . (The surface area is 4πr2, and the
volume is 4
3 πr3, where r denotes the radius).
2) Set up a diﬀerential equation for V (t).
3) Find V (t), t ≥0, when the radius r = 2 cm to time t = 0.
A. Setup of a mathematical model, and an application of this model.
D. 1) Eliminate r from the two equations.
2) Set up a mathematical model by analyzing the text.
3) Apply the model in a special case. (NB. Notice that we cannot ﬁnd the value of k.)
I. 1) Let A denote the surface area. Then
A = 4πr2
and
V = 4
3 πr3.
It follows from the latter equation that
r =

which put into the former equation gives
A = 4π

2) The velocity V ′(t) of the melting is proportional (factor k < 0) to the surface area A =

36π · V 2/3. Then we conclude that the mathematical model is described by the diﬀerential
equation
V ′(t) = k

Putting c = 1

V > 0.
Since the volume decreases by the melting, we have V ′(t) < 0, thus x < 0.

Then by an integration

Example 6.8 It starts to snow on a winter day early in the morning, and the snow continues to fall
through the whole day. The snow is falling with a constant intensity, i.e. there falls a constant amount
of snow per area unite and per time unit.
1) Describe the thickness h(t) of the layer of snow as a function of the time t, assuming that this
thickness is 0 at time t = t0, when it starts snowing.
2) The speed by which a snow plough can remove the snow is inversely proportional to the thickness
of the layer of snow. Let x(t) denote the distance which the snow plough has cleared to time t.
Give the expression of x(t). (We assume that the snow plough starts at time t1 > t0).
3) A snow plough starts at 11 AM and has cleared 4 km at 2 PM, further 2 km at 5 PM on the same
day. When did it start to snow?
A. We shall set up two mathematical models, one for the thickness of the layer of snow (ﬁrst question),
and one for how much a snow plough can clear (second question). Finally we are given three
conditions which should enable us to calculate when it started to snow.
D. 1) Set up a mathematical model for the thickness of the layer of snow.
2) Set up a mathematical model (a diﬀerential equation) for how much, x(t), the snow plough has
cleared.
3) Solve the diﬀerential equation in (2), and exploit the additional conditions in order to ﬁnd the
unknown constants which are occurring in the complete solution. Hereby ﬁnd t0.

I. 1) Obviously,
h(t) = μ · (t −t0),
t ≥t0,
where μ > 0 is a constant.
2) We get immediately that
(21) x′(t) = k1
h(t) =
k
t −t0
,
t > t0,
where k = k1
μ , i.e. the expected diﬀerential equation is reduced to the most simple case, namely
that of an integration problem.
3) From (21) we get
x(t) = k · ln(t −t0) + c,
t > t0.
We see that we have three unknown constants, k, t0 and c. Therefore, we can expect three
additional conditions:
11 AM
x(11) = 0 = k · ln(11 −t0) + c,
11 > t0;
2 PM,
x(14) = 4 = k · ln(14 −t0) + c,
5 PM,
x(17) = 4 + 2 = 6 = k · ln(17 −t0) + c.
Thus we get three nonlinear equations
⎧
⎨
⎩
k · ln(11 −t0) + c = 0,
k · ln(14 −t0) + c = 4,
k · ln(17 −t0) + c = 6,
for the three constants. When the ﬁrst one is subtracted from the latter two we get
k · ln
14 −t0
11 −t0

= 4,
k · ln
17 −t0

,
and thus

11 −t0
3
=

11 −t0
2
.
When this is multiplied by (11 −t0)3 it is transferred into
(14 −t0)3 = (17 −t0)2(11 −t0).
This equation is by a small calculation reduced to
t2
0 −25t0 + 145 = 0,
the solutions of which are
t0 = 1
2 {25 ±

45} ≈
 15.85,
9.15.
Since it started to snow before 11 AM, we have t0 = 1
2{25 −
√
45}, i.e. t0 ≈9.15 which
corresponds to the time appr. 909, when it started to snow, and where we have used that 0.15
hour is appr. 9 minutes.

1) Determine the constants α and β such that
V (t) = α cos 2t + β sin 2t
is a solution of (22).
2) Find the complete solution of (22).
3) What information should be at hand in order to obtain a given voltage V (t)?
A. Given a linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order with constant coeﬃcients. Solve the equation,

have to consider the constant k ∈R. Since exp

Example 6.10 Consider a particle of mass m, which is moving in a straight motion. The position
of the particle to time t is denoted by x(t) where we measure the distance from a ﬁxed initial point 0.
During the motion the particle is only subjected to one force f(x), which only depends on the position
x. We assume that f(x) is continuous and that f(x) ̸= 0 for every x.
According to Newton’s second law we get for the velocity v(t) = x′(t) that
m dv
dt = f(x),
hence
(24) mv dv
dt = f(x) · x′(t).
1. Show that if V (x) is an integral of f(x), then we get by an integration of (24) with respect to t that
1
2 mv2 −V (x) = konstant.
We shall only consider that situation, in which a bullet of mass m is shot into the space in a direction
vertically on the surface of the earth. The initial velocity is v0, and we assume that the bullet is only
inﬂuenced by the gravity f(x) = −k
x2 , where k is some positive constant. Here x denotes the distance
to the centre of the earth. When the radius of the earth is denoted by R, we get v(R) = v0.
2. Find the velocity of the bullet v as a function of the distance x.
3. Find the smallest initial velocity v0, for which the bullet can go to inﬁnity from the earth.
4. When the initial speed is less that the v0 found in (3), how far in the space will the bullet particle
go?
A. The ﬁrst question is purely theoretical. The following three problems refer to a given situation.
We can assume the given mathematical model of Newton’s second law.
D. 1) Integrate (24).
2) Set up the equation in the special case of an initial condition and solve the equation.
3) Find the smallest v0, for which the solution goes to inﬁnity.
4) Find the domain and range, when v is smaller than the velocity of evasion.

Example 6.11 The following example is the ﬁrst one of two examples in which we show that the
possible motions of a planet can be found from two basic laws. We consider a particle P, which is
moving in a plane, in which we have given an (x, y) coordinate system. To any time t the position of
the particle is given by its coordinates x(t) and y(t).

.
We can also in another way determine the coordinates, namely by determining the two variables r(t)
and θ(t) given on the ﬁgure (polar coordinates). Here r(t) indicates the usual distance from 0 to P,
and θ(t) is the angle from the x axis to the line OP chosen in such a way that θ(t) becomes continuous.
We assume that x(t), y(t), r(t) and θ(t) are twice diﬀerentiable functions. In the following we shall
often neglect t and just write x, y, r, θ.
Let us assume that the sun is situated at 0 and that the planet P during its motion is only inﬂuenced
by the mass attraction of the sun F(t). Since a1 = (cos θ, sin θ), a2 = (−sin θ, cos θ), we see that F(t)
is determined by
F(t) = −
k
r2(t) a1(t),
where k is a constant. Then by Newton’s second law we get
F(t) = m · (x′′(t), y′′(t)) ,
where m denotes the mass of the planet.

whence by an integration
r2 dθ
dt = c.
When c ̸= 0, then θ
dt ̸= 0, and θ(t) has an inverse function t(θ). It is seen by composition that
r = r(t(θ)) can be considered as a function in θ. Then we get by an integration

r2(θ) dθ =

c dt = ct + k.
The integral

r2(θ) dθ can be interpreted as the area of the domain which the radius vector
r(θ) sweeps over. If k = 0 from the beginning, then this area is proportional to the time t.
Example 6.12 This example is a continuation of Example 6.11. When we put ω = dθ
dt , we get the
following two diﬀerential equations for the motion
(26) d2r
dt2 −rω2 = −k
mr2 ,
(27) 2ω dr
dt + r dω
dt = 0.
1) Prove from (27) that there is a constant c, such that we during the motion have
r2(t) ω(t) = c.
2) What kind of motion do we get when c = 0?
3) We then assume that c ̸= 0. Prove that θ(t) has an inverse function t = g(θ). Prove also that if
we introduce the function u by
u(t) =
1
r(t),
then
dr
dt = −c du
dθ ,
d2r
dt2 = −c2 u2 d2u
dθ2 .
4) The point is now that one from (26) can ﬁnd a fairly simple diﬀerential equation for u as a function
in θ. Hint: Show that
d2u
dθ2 + u = K
for some constant K.
A. Continuation of Example 6.11, with very strong guidelines.
D. 1) Multiply (27) by r > 0 and integrate.

2) Consider the case c = 0.
3) Show that when c ̸= 0, then t(θ) is deﬁned, and express dr
dt and d2r
dt2 by a diﬀerentiation with
respect to θ.
4) Derive a diﬀerential equation of second order with constant coeﬃcients r.
I. 1) We must for physical reasons have r > 0, so when (27) is multiplied by x, we obtain the
equivalent equation
0 = ω · 2r dr
dt + r2 dω
dt = ω d
dt

r2
+ r2 dω
dt = d

,
hence by an integration
r(t)2ω(t) = c.
2) When c = 0, then ω = θ
dt = 0, because r > 0. This means that θ = k. Then the motion is
radial, i.e. it is bound to a half line from the centre.
3) When c ̸= 0, then ω(t) = dθ
dt =
c
r(t)2 ̸= 0, and dθ
dt has the same sign as c. Consequently the
inverse function of θ(t) exists, t = g(θ).

MAPLE programmes
Example 7.1 Write a MAPLE programme, which sketches the graph of one of the solutions of the
diﬀerential equation
dx
dt + 2t x = t2,
t ∈[−2, 2].
A. MAPLE programme for a solution of a linear and inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst
order.
D. First set up the solution formula: Notice that the integral is of a type which cannot be expressed
by elementary functions. The MAPLE programme is of course not unique. I shall below indicate
the commands which were used by the ﬁgure.

Remark 1. We thus perform a partial integration in order to get a simpler integrand. Even if
the MAPLE programme should be able directly to calculate the ﬁrst integral, it of course allowed
also to make the calculations easier for MAPLE, hence increase the speed of the calculations. ♦

We only want to sketch the graph of one solution, so we choose c = 0, in which case we get the
solution
x0(t) = 1
2 t −1
2 e−t2  t

ex2 dx.
A MAPLE programme for drawing this graph in the interval [−2, 2] is e.g. given by
plot([t,t/2-exp(-t^2)/2∗int(exp(x^2),x=0..t),t=-2..2],
scaling=constrained,color=black);
There are of course other possibilities.
Remark 2. In cases like this where one cannot ﬁnd the exact expression of the solution by ele-
mentary functions, we can see that MAPLE is really of great help. However, in other cases it is
actually easier not to use MAPLE, which should only be considered as an useful tool. ♦
