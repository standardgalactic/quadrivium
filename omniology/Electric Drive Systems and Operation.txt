Be careful in driving
Charles Chaplin
An electric drive is the electromechanical system that converts electrical energy to mechanical motion. Being a part of 
automatic equipment, it acts together with the driven object, such as a machine tool, metallurgical, chemical, or flying 
apparatus, domestic or medical device. Electric drives area includes applications in computers and peripherals, motor 
starters, transportation (electric and hybrid electric vehicles, subway, etc.), home appliances, textile and paper mills, wind 
generation systems, air-conditioning and heat pumps, compressors and fans, rolling and cement mills, and robotics.
This book is intended primarily for the secondary-level and university-level learners of an electromechanical profile, 
including the bachelor and master students majored in electrical engineering and mechatronics. It will help also technicians 
and engineers of respective specialities.
Contemporary applications make high demands of modern drive technology with regard to dynamic performance, speed 
and positioning accuracy, control range, torque stability, and overload capacity. Control of electrical motors always was in 
the highlight of inventers and designers of mechanisms, machines, and transport equipment. As a rule, any mechanism 
is infinitely complex. Often, its behavior is vague, and its reaction on influences and disturbances is unforeseen. To a 
considerable degree, this concerns the electric drive. Nevertheless, a specialist should take into account the main laws 
and regularities of both the driving and the driven objects during maintenance design, and study his applications. To this 
aim, we pick out the traditional approach at which a complex system is divided in simple portions. Then, we examine the 
basic elements of the driving system, the typical models and features of its components, starting from the conditionally 
rigid and ideally linear details and finishing by the elastic distributed, non-linear, and non-stationary ones. 
If you have completed the basics of electricity, electronics, mechanics, and computer science, you are welcome to these 
pages. The book will guide you in appreciation of applications built on the basis of electrical motors. In addition, you will 
know many electromechanical products and determine their important differences. 
I believe in your success in learning electric drives.
I wish you many happy minutes, hours and years in your professional activities.

 Fig. 1.1 Electric drive in the frame of other sciences
It reflects the mutual penetration of the three fundamental directions of the natural thought, named computer science, 
power engineering, and mechanics. Computer science studies the nature of data acquisition, storage, processing, and 
transmitting, thus it serves as a basis of informational technology. Power engineering envelops the sphere of nature 
resources, such as output, conversion, transportation, and application of different kinds of energy. In this way, many 
electrical technologies are developed, particularly electromechanics related to the mechanisms that use electrical energy. 
Further synthesis of energies of the mechanical motion and the intellect movement is a guarantee of progress and the 
source of new scientific directions. Thanks to this synthesis, the new research area, mechatronics was born which manages 
an intellectual control of the mechanical motion. The mechatronics states the laws of energy transformation upon data 
converting in computer-mechanical systems. The electric drive comprises the branch of mechatronics. 
Definition and composition. An electric drive is the electromechanical system that converts electrical energy to mechanical 
energy of the driven machine. In Fig. 1.2 the functional diagram of the electric drive is presented.

 Fig. 1.2 Functional diagram of electric drive
It includes a motor M (or several ones), a mechanical transmission (gear, gearbox), an optional power converter, and a 
control system (controller). The power converter transforms electrical energy W0 of the grid (mains) to motor supply 
energy W1 in response to the set-point speed or path command. The motor is an electromechanical converter, which 
initially converts W1 to electromagnetic energy W12 of the air gap between the stator and the rotor and then turns W12 to 
mechanical work W on the motor shaft. The gear transforms mechanical energy to the load work WL in accordance with 
the requirements of the driven machine (actuator). The controller (regulator) compares the set-point y* with outputs y 
and disturbances χ, and generates the references δ on its inputs. The part of electric drive, which involves the mechanical 
transmission and the motor rotor, is called a mechanical system. 
The grid-operated constant-speed and the converter-fed adjustable electric drives are distinguished. 
At present, the vast majority of applications exploits the general purpose electric drives of low and mean accuracy which 
constitute approximately 80 % of the word driving complexes. They are usually presented by the mains-operated open-
ended mechanisms consisting of the motor, mechanical transmission, and a control system which provides commutation 
and protection operations only. They have neither the power converter nor the feedbacks.
The accurate variable-speed electric drives that comprise the rest drive area are the converter-operated close loop systems 
built on the microprocessor controllers. Their small group presents the high performance drives of the very broad speed 
range and positioning requirements.

Introduction
Application. Developments in power electronics and microelectronics in the last decades resulted in an unprecedented 
growth of adjustable speed drives offering a wide range of advantages from process performance improvement to comfort 
and power savings. Nowadays electric drives can be found nearly everywhere, in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, 
compressors, washing machines, elevators, cranes, water pumping stations and wastewater processing plants, conveyors 
and monorails, centrifuges, agitators, and this list could continue on and on. Electric drives use approximately 70 % of 
generated electrical energy. It is more than 100000 billions kilowatt-hours per year. It was reported that currently 75 % of 
these operate at pump, fan, and compressor applications 97 % of which work at fixed speeds, where flow is controlled by 
mechanical methods. Only 3 to 5 % of these drives are operated at variable-speed control systems. Electric drive systems 
make up about one-third of overall automation equipment. The cost of the informational and electrical parts takes more 
than half of the overall drives value. 
The leading companies in the world market of electric drive engineering are now as follows: American General Electric, 
Maxon Motors, Gould, Reliance Electric, LabVolt, Robicon, and Inland; Canadian Allen Bradley; German Telefunken, 
Siemens, Bosh, AED, Schneider Group, Sew Eurodrive, and Indramat; Danish Danfoss; Finnish Stromberg as a part of the 
ABB Brown Bowery, Int., Japanese Fanuc, Omron, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi; French CEM; Swiss Rockwell Automation, 
etc. They have the wide range of products and the broad service spectrum for solution of demanding automation tasks.

Electromechanical processes
Energy and power. The electric drive converts electrical energy of the supply grid to mechanical energy of the load. It can 
be recalled from the energy conservation law that conversion of kinetic energy Wd into potential energy WL and backwards 
provides the energy balance. Particularly, on the motor shaft 
W = Wd + WL = const.
Along with the energy balance, the balance of powers is supported,
P = Pd + PL.

The motion of the driven object is described by the angular speed ω (angular frequency) or by the linear velocity v. The 
angular speed of a rotating object determines how long it takes for an object to rotate a specified angular distance. An 
angular speed is calculated in rad/s.

occurs only when there is a change in the force acting upon the object. An object can also change from a higher to a

Mechanical systems are subject to the law of inertia, which states that an object will tend to remain in its current state 
of rest or motion unless acted upon by an external force. This property of resistance to acceleration or deceleration is 
referred to as the moment of inertia J. At rotation,

is called a major equation of the torque equilibrium of an electric drive. As (1.1) shows, to move the driven mechanism 
with the constant speed, an electric drive has to develop the motoring torque equal to the counter-torque. To accelerate 
or decelerate the load, the drive has to develop an additional dynamic torque. The solution of this differential equation 
relative to the speed depends on the torque matter. As the torque is the fundamental variable for the speed and position 
adjustment, to control an electric drive, it is required to produce the necessary input impacts that change the motoring 
torque. The major equation explains the operation principle of many mechanisms.
Electromagnetic torque. Electromagnetism is the basic principle behind motor operation. In the sketch of Fig. 1.3, a 
motor as the source of the electromagnetic torque T12 and magnetomotive force (MMF) F12 has a couple of assemblies on 
the common axis, the stationary stator and revolving rotor. Being an electromechanical object, the motor consists of an 
inductor supplying the field and an armature inducing the current in the electrical conductors named windings. Depending 
on a design, the inductor may be placed on the stator or rotor and the same the armature is concerned. The inductor 
excites an electromagnetic flux Φ. In the case of a single turn, the flux feeds the magnetic field of density (induction)

where Q = lr is the turn area that the flux crosses, ψ is an alternating flux linkage, which depends on the turn 
position in the inductor field, l is the turn length, and r is the turn radius. In accordance with the Ampere’s law, in the turn 
supplied by the current I and placed into the magnetic field of induction B the MMF F12 = BlI is generated. The strength 
of the MMF is proportional to the amount of current and its direction is perpendicular to the directions of both I and B. 
In turn, in accordance with the Faraday’s law, if the short-circuiting turn crosses the magnetic field, a voltage is induced 
there known as an electromotive force (EMF) or an induced voltage which is a source of current I and, hence, the MMF.

 Fig. 1.3 The sketch of a motor
where θ is an electrical angle between the flux ψ and the current I vectors called a load angle. Therefore, electromagnetic 
torque results from the interaction of the electrical current and the magnetic flux. 
The torque of the electrical motor is produced by an effective flux linkage ψ12 in the air gap between the stator and rotor 
m-phase multi-turn windings turned around p pole pairs. Both the flux lincage and the current have two components: 
the stator flux linkage ψ1 coupled with the stator current I1, and the rotor flux linkage ψ2 coupled with the rotor current I2. 
Therefore, (1.2) can be resolved for the motor in different ways, like these vector equations:

The developed mechanical torque on the motor shaft differs from the electromagnetic torque due to the friction and 
windage motor losses δT known as a no-load torque as follows:
T = T12 – δT.
Friction occurs when objects contact one another. It is one of the most significant causes of energy loss in a machine.
Control possibilities. For the torque to be produced, the magnetic fields of the stator and rotor must be stationary with 
respect to each other. To control the speed and torque, the mutual orientation and angular speed of the flux and current 
should by adjusted in accordance with (1.2).
Three types of electrical motors exist: dc motors, synchronous motors, and induction (asynchronous) motors. Their difference 
results from a method used to acquire the right load angle by rotation either the rotor with the flux speed or the flux 
with the rotor frequency.

Introduction
Dependently on the stator and rotor supply method, all motors may be subdivided into the machines with the single-side 
and double-side excitation. Both have as minimum one ac fed winding. At the double-side excitation, the second winding 
may be both the ac excitation winding and the dc excitation winding, or by permanent magnets (PM).

 Fig. 1.4 Motor classification
In the dc motor, the stator serves as an inductor whereas the ac in the rotor results from the mechanical commutator 
which fixes positioning the flux and the armature MMF. Using the appropriate commutator brushes disposition, the flux 
is oriented along the stator pole axes upon the orthogonal current vector. Hence, to control the torque, the armature 
current has to be adjusted. As both the load angle θ and the magnetic flux Φ are kept fixed, the dc motor torque follows 
the current and (1.2) is simplified as follows:

where kT is called a dc motor torque construction factor. 
Alternatively, in the synchronous motors, the dc voltage supplies the rotor whereas the stator is excited by the ac current. 
Here, the flux and the spatial angle of the torque require external control without which the angles between the stator 
and rotor fields change with the load yielding an unwanted oscillating dynamic response. In the synchronous servomotors, 
a built-in rotor-position sensor (encoder) provides the right angle between the field and current vectors similarly to a dc 
motor giving rise to (1.4).
However, in the induction motor voltage is induced across the rotor by merely moving it through the stator magnetic 
field. Because the stator windings are connected to an ac source, the current induced in the rotor continuously changes 
and the rotor becomes an electromagnet with alternating poles. Here, the flux and the spatial angle of the torque need in 
external control as well. As there is no autonomous channel to stabilize the flux linkage, the specific control systems are 
required to adjust the torque. While the rotating windings are supplied by ac, the load angle and the flux linkage change 
along with rotation.

Introduction
As ψ = LI, where L is the winding inductance, the electromagnetic torque is expressed by the product of a flux-producing 
current component and a torque-producing component of the same current. Particularly, the torque control can be achieved 
by varying the torque-producing current, and to obtain the quick torque response the current needs in fast changing at 
the previously fixed field flux
To implement the torque, speed, and path control in the motor drives of any type, the power converters and electronic 
controllers have to supply the motor with the energy and control signals, whereas to conform these quantities to the load 
parameters different mechanical transmissions are to be connected to the motor shaft.

Efficiency of electric drive
Definition. The product of rms voltage U0 and current I0 of the supply lines gives the amount of work per unit time called 
apparent power, or total power, P0, which can be equally well expressed in terms of the material resistance and measured 
in volt-amperes (VA):
P0 = U0I0 = I0

Power conversion is accompanied by losses,

 Fig. 1.5 Losses and efficiency of electric drive
Thus, efficiency of the electric drive may be expresses as follows:
ηΣ = ηC ηM ηG
Energy efficiency is a factor that manufacturers are greatly interested in improving. 
Power converter efficiency. Efficiency of the power converter is usually 95 to 99 %. It is proportional to ohmic losses that 
depend on the circuit and operation conditions. Efficiency is reduced along with the speed reduction due to the voltage 
pulsating, discontinuous currents, and cooling problems.
The power converter supplies the motor by the real power (effective power or average power) P1 having units of watts. The 
rest part of the apparent power is the reactive power P01, having units of reactive volt-amperes (VAR). A power factor is a 
figure of merit that measures how effectively energy is transmitted between a source and load network. It is the ratio of 
the real power and apparent power. In the case of sinusoidal supply, 
P1 = P0 cos φ0 , P01 = P0 sin φ0.
The power factor cos φ0 is determined here by the phase displacement angle φ0 between the supply ac current and voltage. 
Being the load dependent, the power factor grows along with the load growth, but falls to 0.1…0.7 at idling.

Introduction
These definitions are not adequate when considering the reactive power of converters. Most power converters produce 
a non-sinusoidal current waveform on the ac side whose fundamental component lags the voltage. In the case of such 
supply source and non-linear load, the power factor is expressed as a product of two terms, one resulting from the phase 
shift of the voltage and current fundamental components (effect of displacement, namely displacement factor) and the 
other resulting from the current harmonics (effect of distortion), namely the distortion factor. Only the fundamental 
frequency component of the current contributes to the active power. Due to harmonics, the apparent power is greater 
than the minimum amount necessary to transmit the average power. 
Motor efficiency. The motor as the core of an electric drive converts the real power P1 to the mechanical power P. Motor 
efficiency affects efficiency of the overall electromechanical transformation,
P = P1ηM
It is the fraction or percentage of energy supplied to the motor that is converted into mechanical energy at the motor 
shaft when the motor is continuously operating at full load with the rated voltage applied. The most usual values of ηM are 
in the range of 40 to 95 %. As Fig. 1.5 (b) Illustrates, actual efficiency alters with the motor utilization i.e. with the ratio 
of the actual power P to the rated power PM given in the manufacturer’s datasheet. Upon the partial loading the motors 
become less favorable. For larger motors efficiency is higher than for small motors.
Motor efficiency is a subject of increasing importance, especially for ac motors because they are widely applied and account 
for a significant percentage of energy used in industrial facilities.
Gear efficiency. The power loss in the mechanical transmission,
δG = P – PL
is mainly provoked by friction and is measured by transmission efficiency

This term allows evaluating that part of the power, which passes to the motor from the load. When ηGR > 0, the torque 
becomes negative thus resulting in the adjustment problems of the active-loading mechanisms. To avoid such situations, 
mechanical brakes and self-braking transmissions are required. 
At loading, transmission efficiency changes similarly to the motor efficiency. Overall efficiency of k sequentially connected 
transmissions is equal to

Table 2.1 Properties of converter-fed electric drives
The least expensive and complex are the induction drives whereas the most accurate are the dc and PM excited electric 
drives. 
In the field of the converter-fed ac drives two directions are emphasized, the common-mode variable-speed induction 
drives of the low and mean speed range (D = 10...100) and the high performance accurate drives, the speed range of 
which approaches tenths of thousands. The last ones are known as the servo drives.
To adjust the ac motors, the frequency converters are included between the mains and the motor. Along with the frequency, 
the voltage, current, slip, or EMF are usually changed. The frequency control, the slip control, and the mutual voltage-
frequency, current-frequency, and flux-frequency controls are called the scalar controls because they use the rms (static) 
motor description to distinguish them from the vector controls, such as the field-oriented control and the direct torque 
control, which requires the intellectual approach with the motor model in the control loop.
Power converters. Power converters are supplied from the single-phase or three-phase mains. To decrease the non-
sinusoidal current with high harmonics they generate, the converters are often connected to the mains through the chokes, 
EMC filters, isolating transformers or auto transformers which limit supply sags and spikes and improve power factor. 
Based on the principle of electrical motor operation, some prevailing directions to influence on the motor mechanical 
energy may be distinguished. In the completely adjustable electric drive the control of the magnitude, frequency, shape, 
and phase of the motor current, voltage, flux, torque, and speed should be processed. To this aim, the following power 
converters are used in electric drives:
--
ac/dc converters known as rectifiers that convert the input ac voltage U0 to dc with controlled or uncontrolled 
output voltage U1 and current I1 (Fig. 2.2 (a));

shape (Fig. 2.2 (c))

 Fig. 2.2 Classes of power converters
Supply topologies. The supply topology of the squirrel-cage and wound-rotor induction motor drives is shown in Fig. 
2.3 (a). Here, the stator circuit is fed by the ac/ac converter. The ac/ac power converter is driven by the mains voltage U0 of 
the power leads (often through the mains transformers). Energy from the converter of the demanded frequency, magnitude, 
phase, and shape (U1) supplies the motor stator.The frequency and magnitude of the stator voltage or current are adjusted by 
the control system, which sets the demanded drive characteristics by online calculations or using information from sensors.
Practically the same supply topology the PMSM has (Fig. 2.3 (b)). To adjust the frequency and voltage by the stator 
converter, the built-in motor encoder senses the shaft position here.

 Fig. 2.3 Power topologies of converter-fed electric drives
To excite the rotor circuit of the wound rotor machine, so-called rectifying cascades are sometimes applied (Fig. 2.3 (c)). 
In such topology the naturally-commutated (direct) inverters are used which regenerate the slip energy to the mains thus 
introducing an additional EMF to the rotor. Another method is based on the double fed converters, operated in both the 
motoring and the generator modes.
Figure 2.3 (d) presents the topology of the completely controlled electric drive in which both the stator and the rotor 
circuitry of the motor are excited by the separate stator- and rotor-feeding ac/ac converters. This organization can be applied 
in the variable-speed wound rotor induction drive. Energy from the converter of the demanded frequency, magnitude, 
phase, and shape supplies the motor rotor (U2) and stator (U1) circuits.
The power topology of the wound rotor field excited synchronous motor drives is shown in Fig. 2.3 (e). To adjust the 
speed and voltage the ac/ac stator converter is used. The rotor circuit is excited through the separate rectifier.
The voltage and the flux are adjusted in the dc electric drive as well. Here, the mechanical commutator plays the inverter 
functions whereas an excitation is provided by the PM (Fig. 2.3 (f)) or by the separate excitation circuit (Fig. 2.3 (g)).
2.2	
Control topologies of electric drives
Control system. A drive system solves the problem of the most accurate implementation of the demanded impacts by the 
driven machine which is the control object of the electric drive. For simple applications where speed and path accuracy 
is not required, an open-ended control may be sufficient. An open-ended drive is one in which the signal goes from the 
controller to the actuator only. There is no signal returning from the load to inform the controller that the motion has 
occurred.

Common Properties of Electric drives
However, the object of management is usually unstable, non-linear and encumbrance-affected therefore the set-points are 
executed with errors. Applications that require the control over a variety of complex motion profiles use the closed loop 
technique. These may involve the control of either velocity or position, high resolution and accuracy, very slow or very high 
speeds; high torques in a small package size, etc. Because of additional components such as the feedback device, complexity 
is considered by some to be a weakness of the closed loop approach. These additional components do add to initial cost.
Behaviour of the electric drive is described (Fig. 2.4) by some control variables y (the speed, torque, flux, or machine 
position), disturbances χ (moments of inertia, counter-torques, and encumbrances), set-points y*, intermediate variables 
y′ (voltages and currents). The control errors δ are just usual here like in any automatic system. Commonly the set-points 
are time-changing therefore for their reproduction the adjustable and automatic control systems are used. In some cases 
an electric drive plays a role of the stabilizing system with the time-constant set-points.
Variable data pass across the direct channels and feedbacks. They are processed by the controllers (regulators) − information 
converters that generate the references using the error signals δ with the help of filters − information converters that select 
the useful particle of the sensor signals y, y′. The set-points are generated by different set-point devices. The feedback 
is the property of the dynamic electric drive operated in the close loop system. In a servo drive the feedback loops the 
position, path, flux, torque, current, etc. 
Feedback and feedforward loops. The feedback looping of the control object (Fig. 2.4 (a)) weakens an impact of the 
external variables χ on the system performing accuracy therefore as a rule the feedbacks loop the unstable and inertial 
units. Such system consists of objects (O), regulators (Reg) and loops with summers and fork nodes. The negative feedback 
provides boosting before the set-point approaching. Such boosting evidently appears in the linear area of the system 
operation, comes down upon the influence of the non-linear factors, and disappears at saturation. The positive feedback 
brings down the system quick action.
Stability of the close loop system is of the first importance. Yet, stability is the mandatory, but insufficient, condition of the 
satisfactory management. The sufficient condition requires compensating of disturbances. The regulators, which design 
does not meet these rules should be considered as improper. 
In the control topology two ways are combined commonly – the deflection control by looping the components with 
feedbacks, and the load-responsive control by arrangement the feedforward loops. 
Cascading. Multi-loop (cascade) systems with outer and inner loops change significantly the properties of the components 
they envelop. They provide stability of the unstable loop, decrease its lag effect, or encourage its integrating or differentiate 
properties. Unlike the single-loop systems shown in Fig. 2.4 (a), in the inner loops of the cascade systems (Fig. 2.4 (b)) 
the additional impacts is produced. The inner loops promote effective compensation of the system disturbance because 
they feel disturbances faster as compared with the major outer loop. Particularly, the predictive control with a feedforward 
brings the reference closer to the control object thus specifying the value of y by the signal of the error δ (Fig. 2.4 (c)). 
The so-called compound systems (Fig. 2.4 (d)) provide an indirect measurement and compensation of the disturbances 
and errors. The equipment to measure and derive the signals in these systems forms an observer, that is the regulator of 
the state controller class The systems with observers are applied when variables are untraceable for the direct measurement 
and the reference presents the calculated function.

Characteristics of Electric drives
3	 Characteristics of Electric Drives
3.1	
Dynamic characteristics
Definition. In order for the driven machine to produce good, accurate speeds and parts, it must operate in two distinct 
modes: transient and steady state. The first mode of operation, the transient state, occurs when the input command changes. 
This causes the load to accelerate and decelerate i.e. change the speed. During this time period, there is an associated time 
required for the load to reach a final speed or position (rise time), a time for the load to settle, and a certain acceptable 
overshoot. The second mode of operation, steady state, occurs when the load has reached the final speed, i. e. continuous 
operation. During this time, there is an associated tracking accuracy typically called a steady state error. The machine 
must be capable of operating in these modes to handle the variety of operations required for prescribed performance.
Demands in the dynamic properties of a drive arise as a result of even faster machining processes, increases in automation 
cycles, and associated production efficiency. Dynamic characteristics, called also the time responses, reflect an electric drive 
behavior in transients, such as start-up (starting), braking, set-point switching, load applying and fault. Any transient is the 
assembly of a pair of motions - a free motion with the disturbed equilibrium and a motion forced by the applied impact.
A dynamic diagram (trace) shows the changing in time of the output control variables y like linear and angular speeds (v, 
ω) and paths (l, φ), torques (T), currents (I), fluxes (ψ), and powers (P). They reflect the system respond to the set-points 
y* and disturbances χ upon the counter-torque TL, voltage U, and parameters oscillations.
Step response. The system dynamic quality is usually evaluated by the deterministic transients. The most typical of them 
are the steps (step responses). In some applications the trapezoidal and more complex inputs are used to test the drive 
dynamics. Fig. 3.1 shows conventional transients excited by the step arising of the reference or the disturbance at the 
zero instant. Basing on these curves, a system may be evaluated using such quality factors as the response property, quick 
action, overshoot, oscillation, stability, and the steady-state mode.

The response properties are subdivided into oscillation-free monotonous, oscillation-free exponential, and oscillating processes 
plotted by the traces 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 3.1 (a).
Quick action. The quick action known also as the speed of response or the transient response is measured by the first-matching 
time td1 and the overall startup time td. In Fig. 3.1 (b), td1 and td are the minimum and the maximum time intervals, after 
the expiry of which the following inequality is met:

where y and yL are the current and the steady-state outputs and δL is the permissible accuracy range (tolerance) known also 
as the irregularity factor. Normally, δL ≤ 0.05, i.e. the transients are considered as completed when y differs from yL no more 
than 5 %. In the case of oscillation-free exponential modes of operation, td = td1 = 3τ, where τ is the system time constant. 
Time constants. The time constants describe the rate of the heating, mechanical, and electrical processes in electric drive. 
Every time constant is the ratio of energy stored during the transient (power consumption) and the returned power 
(power conductivity):

describes the speed-up rate of the driven mechanism. It defines the time required to run the motor of the moment of

speed the motor develops the rated power at rated voltage and frequency. Is serves as an indication of how fast the output

Characteristics of Electric drives
In the systems of high speed and torque stability, the transient errors caused by the load disturbance (TL), by the reference 
change (y*), or by the braking influence restrict the quick action. An increase of the speed of response is limited also by the 
motor overload capacity, the current rate of the power converter, and permissible mechanical accelerations. On the other 
hand, in the percussion-type machines (punches, presses, pile-drivers, etc.) the speed of response is lowered forethought.
Overshoot. An overshoot is the ratio of the difference between maximum and the steady-state values of the output signal 
to its steady-state value:

Typically, the overshoot is to be less than 0.15 to 0.50. In the machine-tool systems it is restricted by 0.10, whereas in 
some drives it is prohibited. As well, the oscillation magnitude ymax is limited by the commutation, durability conditions, 
etc. At last, the oscillation-free exponential processes have never overshoot.
Oscillation and attenuation. Oscillation is described by the number of alternations (unidirectional transitions) of the 
output value y through the steady value yL per the transient time td. Usually, 3 to 5 oscillations are permissible. An interval 
between the neighbor amplitudes

 is known as the free 
oscillation frequency. It is assumed that the system senses the oscillations, which frequency is less than fc. The rate of the 
oscillation attenuation is measured by the damping factor, known also as an attenuation factor:

Damping indicates the rate of system stability. In the stable system the first overshoot has the highest magnitude, that is  
δy = δy1. When the magnitude has no damping and raises with time, we say about an unstable system with sustained oscillation. 
Steady-state mode. Gradually, the free component in the transient is damped, and the system works in the steady mode of 
the forced oscillation. The features of the steady-state mode are described by the steady or periodic processes dependently 
on the applied influences. To evaluate the first, the static characteristics are used, and in the last case the dynamic traces 
are popular. 
In electrical converters, the steady processes are accompanied by ripples, which are distinguished as the harmonic and 
sub-harmonic ones. In motors, the steady-state mode is accompanied by pulsations. The pulsation caused by the converter 
ripples should not destroy the motor dynamics. In mechanical system, the steady state is described by the load diagrams that 
reflect the periodic load time-changing, and by the travel diagrams that illustrate the speed-time trajectories of a machine.

Static characteristics
Definition. The static characteristics describe the system in the steady-state modes while the counter-forces and counter-
torques are considered as constant or weakly changed ones. These characteristics may be discussed as the particular cases 
of the transients supposing the smallest input deviation in the referred time interval. Usually, the static curve represents 
the trace of the control variable y (I, T, F, ω, v, φ, l, etc.) forced by some main disturbance χ (U, TL, FL, etc.) upon the fixed 
set-point y*. The influence of other disturbances is displayed as the drift, which distorts the diagram shape.
External characteristics (output characteristics) and control characteristics describe the operation of power converters 
in the steady-state mode. Examples are: U1(I), U1(χ). The main static characteristics of motors are an electromechanical 
characteristic (a speed-current characteristic ω(I)) and a mechanical characteristic (a speed-torque characteristic ω(T)). The 
typical static characteristics of the load are the counter-force and counter-torque diagrams as the functions of speeds and 
paths, TL(ω), FL(l), etc.
Universal diagram. As a rule, the static characteristics are represented in the universal diagrams that combine the motor 
and the load curves, and, sometimes, the power converter curves. In their intersection the operating point of an electric 
drive is placed. For example, Fig. 3.2 (a) illustrates the speed-torque characteristic curves of the motor ω(T) and the 
mechanism TL(ω).

 Fig. 3.2 Examples of speed-torque characteristics
At start-up, the motor runs from the zero speed and follows its speed-torque characteristic until reaching the stable 
operating point T = TL where the load characteristic and the motor characteristic intersect. This stable operating point 
will be reached if the load torque is smaller than the motor maximum torque.
To evaluate the system on the basis of the static characteristic, the following quality indexes are used: an overload capacity 
λ, a speed range D, rigidity β, linearity, and the steady-state errors.
Overload capacity. An overload capacity is the ratio of the inrush value of a disturbance χmax to its rated value χn:
n
χ
χ

max
In power converters, the overload capacity is restricted by their heat dissipation features. Typically, for the semiconductor 
devices it is relatively small, but for the magnetic devices and electrical machines it is enough significant. The overload 
capacity of motors presents the ratio of their maximum and rated torques,

which is true in the full range of the disturbance drift. Particularly, to measure the speed adjustment range, the drift of the 
load torque δT should be limited by the permissible values TL min and TL max or by the constant range ±0.2TL. An example 
is given in Fig. 3.2 (b). Usually, the speed adjustment range of the simple electromechanical systems is equal 2 to 5. The 
close loop automotive electric drives implement ranges that are of 1 to 3 orders more. The full speed adjustment range 
of the auxiliary electric drive of the precision milling machine, lathe, or turned lathe reaches 102 to 105. The theoretical 
speed range of the feed drive for the contour machining using the computer numerical control is infinite. In practice, the 
minimum auxiliary value is restricted by the sensitivity to the supply voltage and frequency deviations. Their permissible 
ranges are -15 to +10 % and 2 % accordantly. The speed range of the machine-tool main electric drive riches typically 
200, 500, or 1000.

are of tenths and hundreds. Such characteristics are called the rigid curves or flat characteristics in distinct from the 
soft, or drooping, characteristics that depend on the disturbances. Examples of absolutely rigid (1), rigid (2), and soft 
(3) characteristics are given in Fig. 3.2 (c). Absolutely rigid are the synchronous motor characteristics, whereas the 
characteristics of the series dc motor are mostly soft. Rigidity relates to the speed range as follows:

is called a viscous friction factor or the inner friction factor. The ratio of motor rigidity β to the mechanism rigidity βL 
treats the condition of the drive stability. We call the system as stable when an adjusted variable decreases while the 
disturbance increases. In a stable system, an adjusted variable decreases while the disturbance increases (curve 1 in Fig. 
3.2 (d)) whereas it increases in a non-stable system (curve 2 in Fig. 3.2 (d)). Consequently, the stability condition is β < βL 
that is the closer is the angle between ω(T) and ω(TL) to 90˚, the higher is the stability of the process. In other words, if, 
after the speed rising, the load trace TL is placed to the right of the motor trace T, the motor will not develop the torque 
to return the speed to the previous state. Therefore, this drive system has the necessary stability. And vice versa, if, after 
the speed rising, the trace of the counter-torque TL is placed to the left of the trace of the motor torque T, the developed 
wasted torque will accelerate the motor. Examples of the stable (1) and unstable (2) systems are given in Fig. 3.2 (e).
Linearity and steady-state errors. From the linearity point of view, the systems with constant rigidity are called linear 
systems, whereas any variability of rigidity is the feature of a non-linear system. Characteristics examples of the linear (1) 
and non-linear (2) systems are given in Fig. 3.2 (f).
The steady-state errors describe the deviation of the system motion from the constant or smoothly changed reference upon 
the constant or smoothly changed disturbances.
Usually, the external characteristics of power converters are evaluated by the same features as the motor and the load static 
characteristics. As the control curves are concerned, normally they are not restricted by overloading capabilities, rigidity, 
or the steady-state errors, though the control range and linearity are their important properties.

Characteristics of Electric drives
Correlation of dynamic and static characteristics. Earlier the time constants of the electric drive were introduced. To 
associate the mechanical time constant τT from (3.1) with the moments of inertia and the load torque, introduce the 
following equation:

is called a motor overtorque. Usually TL @ TM, therefore the 
motor overtorque lT is defined by its overload capacity l. The equation is used to calculate the systems at the alternate 
load. It shows that the less is the machine inertia and load, the higher is the quick action. Any increasing of these items 
decreases the speed of response. The load inertia ratio changes within the broad range in the rolling mills, sluices, and 
machine-tools to 20 and more in the paper machines and excavators.

Load characteristics
Passive and active loads. The electrical motor is the reversible electrical machine capable to perform in the motoring 
and generator modes dependently of the load features. The load forces and counter-torques which are independent on 
the sign of the motion speed are called reactive or passive forces and torques. They are typical for the machine-tools and 
conveyers where the weight and cutting forces prevent the motion and change their sign along with the change of the 
machine direction (Fig. 3.3 (a)). In the hoists and weights, the active forces and torques are presented. Their sources are 
gravity and deformation therefore they keep direction when the load direction changes. These forces may both prevent 
and contribute to the motion. The hoists usually require some specific control methods for the vertical motion.

Characteristics of Electric drives
Motoring and regeneration. Figures 3.4 (a) present possible variants of applying of the work forces to the motor shaft for 
the four-quadrant operation. The first and the third quadrants illustrate the motoring mode of the drive performance. The 
second quadrant shows the generator mode of regeneration where energy of the load motion returns to the motor. The forth 
quadrant displays the generator mode of the counter-motion. In the motoring mode, the motor torque contributes to the 
mechanism motion whereas in the generator modes, the motor develops the torque, which prevents the mechanism motion.

 Fig. 3.4 Modes of drive operation and restrictions of the speed-torque characteristics
The reversing drive operates within four quadrants with a clockwise/counterclockwise (CW/CCW) rotation of the motor and 
an excursion motion of the load. In the other cases the direction change of the load is prohibited or impermissible thus 
the non-reversing drive is required. The specific means for prevention of reverse rotation are developed in some of cases.
Load profiles. The four most popular load profile types are as follows:
--
torque independent of speed (constant torque)
--
torque proportional to the square of the shaft speed (variable torque)
--
torque linearly proportional to speed (linear torque)
--
torque inversely proportional to speed (inverse torque)
Fig. 3.3 (a) shows the active and reactive load torque diagrams (TL = const) of some machine-tools, conveyers, and traction 
equipment. The load can be considered to be constant if the torque remains the same over the operating speed range. 
Typical constant torque loads are lathes, axial and centrifugal pumps and ventilators, screw and centrifugal compressors, 
and agitators. 
Extruders, draw benches, paper and printing machines, conveyers, and lifts have the linear torque, whereas the rolling 
mills, winders, wire drawers, and some lifts have the inverse torque. The loading generators usually have the linear static 
characteristics plotted in Fig. 3.3 (b)):
TL = k0 + k1ω
Other applications have a variable torque characteristic that is their torque increases with the speed. Centrifugal pump 
characteristic is described by the quadratic pump and fan characteristic (Fig. 3.3 (c)) like this one:

Characteristics of Electric drives
TL = kω2
As the torque of pumps and fans, stirrers and mixers is proportional to the square of the speed, their power is proportional 
to the cube of the speed. This means that at reduced speeds there is a great reduction in power and therefore energy 
saving. Because the power is greatly reduced, the voltage applied to the drive can also be reduced and additional energy 
saving is thus achieved. 
The vacuum cleaner motion is described by a cubical low, and some extruders, mixers, and robots have more complex 
model of operation. (Fig. 3.3 (d)), for example,
TL = k0 + k1ω + k2ω2 + …
Restrictions of speed-torque characteristics. Figure 3.4 (b) shows the typical limitations of the modes of the electric 
drive operation. In the nominal operation points the rated torque Tn is developed within the rated speed range ωn. At 
the torques equal and below the rated value, an electric drive power varies proportionally to the speed, P = Tω. This area 
provides the ability of the drive constant torque operation. To exceed the rated speed, the torque should be decreased to 
save the constant output power in the high speed operation mode beyond the rated speed. This area provides the ability 
of the drive constant power operation. The drive override ωmax is restricted by the mechanical durability and, as a rule, 
cannot exceed the double rated speed. In the range of the low speeds due to the cooling deterioration, the load derating 
is recommended up to 15…30 %. This motor derating is essentially independent of the drive type, thus the constant 
torque ability is declined.
The maximum torque of the dc and servomotor is limited, among other factors, by the load capacity of the permanent 
magnets. The rms torque must be smaller than the torque at zero speed. If a motor is too heavily loaded and the current 
increases to an excessive value, the magnets will become demagnetized and the motor will “lose the torque”. To avoid 
demagnetization, the currents of the motor and power converter must be agreed. Additionally, if the thermal limiting rate 
is exceeded, this also will result in demagnetization of the magnets or damage of the winding insulation.
Torque restriction in the upper speed range depends on the supply voltage and the voltage drop in the cables. Due to the 
counter-EMF (voltage induced in the motor) the maximum current can no longer be injected. This results in a reduced 
torque.
The permissible torque Tmax is restricted by the motor inrush current. All motors work continuously within the rated 
current (full-load current) range. Their short-time run-up locked-rotor currents overcome the rated value 2 to 10 times. 
Mechanical systems, such as bearings, shafts, and gearboxes have the limited overload capacity as well. Typically, within 
the speed range from ωM to 0.5ωM the 1.5-times overload is possible up to 60 seconds and the 2 to 3-times short-term 
overload in 0.2 to 3.0 seconds. Within the speed range from 0.5ωM to 0.25ωM, the 3 to 4-times overload limit is possible 
in milliseconds, and in the case of very low speeds, the 4 to 6-times overload electronic trip may occur.

Park’s machine
Orthogonal reference frames. To describe any rotational machine, R. H. Park have introduced the orthogonal reference 
frames, which interpret a multiphase multi-pole system as an equivalent double-phase bipolar (p = 1) machine. The aim 
of the Park’s transformation is to simplify the analysis of multi-phase circuits by reduction of many ac quantities to the 
pair of dc variables. Simplified calculations can be carried out on these imaginary dc quantities resulting, if required, in 
the following inverse transformation to recover the actual multi-phase ac results.
An elementary Park’s machine has two identical stator coils (m1 = 2) located such that their axes are shifted by 90°, 
and two rotor coils (m2 = 2) disposed in the similar way. The air gap between the stator and the rotor is assumed to be 
constant and independent of the rotor position. In the winding diagram shown in Fig. 4.1 (a), three orthogonal winding 
systems are represented. The lengthwise and the transversal stator windings

 are placed along the axes which are 
denoted as an orthogonal stator reference frame (α, β). The orthogonal reference frame for the rotor windings, 
q

, 
is denoted as (d, q). The lengthwise axis d is superposed with the positive direction of the rotor MMF. Any arbitrary frame 
of references is denoted as (x, y). Normally, the stator frame is fixed in space whereas the rotor frame and other arbitrary 
frames can rotate in space with some angular frequencies. The counter-clockwise rotation is considered as positive and 
clockwise rotation as negative. Angles are counted in the positive direction of the rotor rotation. The positive directions 
of the β, q and y axes are selected in advance with α, d and x.

Here, the stator frequency ω1 is the frequency of the voltage and current in the stator circuit whereas the slip frequency 
determines the induced voltage and current in the rotor circuit. In the induction machines both the stator and the rotor 
are excited by ac (Fig. 4.1 (b)). In the synchronous machines the rotor is excited by dc, that is ω2 = 0 and ω1 = ω12 (Fig. 
4.1 (c)). In the dc machines the stator is excited by dc, that is ω1 = 0, therefore ω2 = −ω12 (Fig. 4.1 (d)). 
Electrical equilibrium. The model of the Park’s machine in the arbitrary reference frame (x, y) rotated with the frequency 
ωk depicts the electrical equilibrium of the stator and rotor winding voltages by the following Kirhchoff’s equations:

As follows from (4.2), the supply voltages are distributed between three components. The first component (RiIi) describes 
the ohmic voltage drop in the stator and rotor windings caused by the Joule’s power loss. The second one, the flux linkage 
derivation (sψi), is caused by the voltage drop in the winding leakage reactance. It is called a transformer EMF, or a self-
induction EMF. The mutual motion of the windings results in a back, or rotation EMF, known also as the counter-EMF, 
Ei = ψjω. In (4.2) rotation EMF exists in both the stator and the rotor.
Flux equilibrium. In the orthogonal reference frame (x, y) the flux linkage results from two components. As the phase 
winding resistances R1, R2 are symmetrically distributed along the rotor circle, the following equations unify the motor 
fluxes, inductances, and currents:

Electromechanical equilibrium. Unlike the ideal Park’s machine, in the real 2p-pole machine the angular frequency ω0 
of the stator magnetic field (a motor synchronous speed or an ideal no-load speed), the motor shaft angle φ and frequency 
ω called simply a motor speed are as follows:

Thus, (4.5) determines the relationship between the electrical and mechanical angles and speeds through the number of 
the machine pole pairs p.
Recall the vector product (1.2) of the current and the flux linkage that originates the motor electromagnetic torque T12. 
Assuming T ≈ T12 and taking into account (1.3) and (4.3), the motoring torque can be presented by the following equations:

Thus, the motor torque is defined by the values of the following variables: the stator flux linkage ψ1, the rotor flux linkage 
ψ2, the effective flux linkage ψ12, the stator current I1, the rotor current I2 as well as their phase displacements. The torque 
does not depend of the reference frame selected for calculation, whether (x, y), (d, q) or (α, β). The last expression in (4.6) 
is the major equation (1.1) of the torque equilibrium which determines the motor speed ω through the motor torque T, 
the counter-torque TL, and the moment of inertia J.

Coordinate transformation
Transformation of (L1, L2, L3) to (α, β). This transformation can be thought of in geometric terms as the projection of 
the three phase quantities onto two stationary axes, the α axis and the β axis. To proceed from the balanced natural three-
phase current system IL1, IL2, IL3 where IL1 + IL2+ IL3 = 0 to the orthogonal reference frame (α, β), the following equations 
are applied:

Transformation of (L1, L2, L3) to (d, q). This transformation is conceptually similar to the previous transformation. It 
can be thought of as the projection of the three separate sinusoidal phase quantities onto two axes rotating with the same 
angular frequency as the sinusoidal phase quantities. The two axes are called a direct, or d, axis and a quadrature, or q, axis 
respectively. To convert the natural frame (L1, L2, L3) to the orthogonal frame (d, q), the following equation system is used:

DC motor 
Design. A dc motor is the example of the electrical machine in which solely the dc signals provide direct torque and speed 
control. When comparing the dc motor with an ac machine, the former represents the best control plant because the main 
flux and the armature current distribution here are fixed in space and can be directly and independently controlled while 
with an ac machine these quantities are strongly interacting and move with respect to the stator, the rotor, and each other. 
To implement the same control in other types of machines, their control systems convert the ac variables to the dc ones 
using electrical or mechanical Park’s transformations. This is the reason why the dc motor properties serve as the sample 
of the reachable control possibilities for all kinds of drives. 
Mathematical model. The dc motor has two separate sources that interact to develop the torque. These are the stator 
field and the rotor circuit. To build the dc motor model in the fixed frame (α, β) shown above in Fig. 4.1 (d), the β axis 
is placed along the pole axis, which commutates during the motor operation therefore the sole stator winding is fixed 
along β. The α axis is superposed with the brush axis and with an equivalent (substitution) rotor winding. The following 
designations are used in the dc machines:

Torque and voltage equations. As well as in other types of motors, the current vector consists of two components. But in 
the dc motor, both the current components are structurally disconnected and can be adjusted independently. The load-

The characteristics of (4.17) built in Fig. 4.2 (b) are slightly twisted due to the instability of Φ called an armature reaction. 
This reaction is usually compensated by additional construction means. In the case of the overall compensation the static 
traces became linear as the dotted line in Fig. 4.2 (b) shows. Using the armature current instead of the torque, the speed-
current curves may be built in the same way (the dash-dot line in Fig. 4.2 (b)):

In accordance with the speed-torque and speed-current characteristics of the dc motors described by (4.17) and (4.18), 
the speed of the dc motor drops at loading being at full load about 90 to 95 % of the no-load speed ω0. The voltage drop 
across the armature resistance and the armature reaction are responsible for this.

Synchronous Motor Drives
5	 Synchronous Motor Drives
5.1	
Field-excited synchronous motor drive
Design. An ac machine whose rotor is supplied from the dc source or by the PM is referred to as a synchronous motor. 
In the synchronous motor, when the stator and the rotor are energized, a rotating magnetic field is established in the rotor 
that interacts with the stator rotating magnetic field. The term synchronous means that the rotor rotation is synchronized 
with the stator magnetic field, and the rotor speed is the same as the motor synchronous speed.
To run the wound rotor synchronous motor, the ac power is first applied to the stator, and the synchronous motor starts 
like a squirrel cage machine. As the stator is energized, the ac current I1 flows across the stator windings and an MMF 
revolves at the angular frequency ω1 which initialises the rotor current I2. After the motor has accelerated, the dc power 
is applied to the rotor coils. The synchronous motors with a PM do not need a dc power source to magnetize the rotor 
therefore their stator and rotor are excited simultaneously. 
A heavy permanent rotor magnetic field locks the rotor in step with the rotating stator magnetic field. In this way, the 
rotor turns at the permanent synchronous speed (4.5)

where f1 is the frequency of the applied voltage and p is the stator pole pair number. 
As the rotor is excited by dc, the slip speed ω2 = 0 and the slip (6.1) is absent. Thanks to the spatial arrangement of the 
stator coils and the chronological sequence of the supply current, this current generates a rotating permanent magnetic 
flux Φ in the air gap superposed with the axis of the rotor winding. The flux Φ produced by the rotor winding or by the 
PM intersects the stator windings and generates the back EMF, which makes the synchronous motor significantly different 
from the induction motor.
Vector diagram and replacement circuit. The synchronous motor design is usually described by the Park’s model in 
the rotational rotor-linked reference frame (d, q) at ωk = ω12 shown above in Fig. 4.1 (c) where the stator and the rotor 
rotating fields run synchronously with the angular frequency ω = ω0 or ω1 = ω12, as (4.1) implies. Voltages, currents and 
flux linkages of the model can be resolved on the orthogonal components (d, q).

 Fig. 5.1 Vector, replacement, and angle diagrams of synchronous motor
In Fig. 5.1 (a), the vector diagram of the synchronous motor is presented, in which the reference frame (x, y) shown in 
Fig. 4.1 (c) is superposed with the rotor frame (d, q) and ψ1 = ψ12 = Φ = const. The d axis superposes with the axis of the 
rotor poles and excitation winding wΦ whereas the q axis is perpendicular. Herein, the voltage and the permanent flux 
linkage of the rotor excitation flows along the d axis only, thus

The stator current I1 has two components responsible for developing MMF E2 and E1 along the d and q rotor axes, that is the 
flux-producing current I1d and the torque-producing current I1q. In the stator reference frame (α, β) these representations 
are the sinusoidal quantities of the stator frequency. The components of the supply voltages in (4.2) are described as follows:

The rotor current I2 = IΦ of the synchronous machine is defined by the excitation flux Φ only and does not depend on the 
load and the stator current I1. The rotor EMF E2 is determined by the rotation speed ω = ω0 which, according to (4.5), is

where φ1 is the phase angle between the phase voltage and current. An important property of the dc excited synchronous 
motor is the possibility to control the consumed reactive power by affecting the excitation current. By increasing IΦ, the flux 
can be regulated in the rotor, thus reaching the disappearance of the current reactive component. Further rise of excitation 
will cause the stator demagnetizing. Eo ipso, energy losses in the supply grid are minimized. Assuming negligible power 
loss in the rotor resistance, the mechanical power may be considered the same as the consumed power.

As (5.1) shows, the torque is proportional to the sine of the load angle, the effective flux, and the stator current remaining 
independent of the speed. 
While the motor is unloaded, the stator MMF superposes the induced rotor MMF and the load angle θ is zero. If the load 
torque is applied to the shaft, the machine will momentary slow down causing the rotor rotating field ψ2 to lag in relation 
to the stator rotating field, thus producing the rotor displacement angle θ12. Accordingly, the load angle θ shown in Fig. 
1.3 and Fig. 5.1 appears between the rotor field and the stator current. The load angle will adjust to match the applied 
load torque, and the machine continues to spin at the synchronous speed.
The greater the load angle, the more the torque increases in (1.2) and (5.1), as shown in the angle diagram of Fig. 5.1 (c). 
The stator pole leading the rotor pole “pulls” the rotor and the lagging stator pole “pushes” it, producing the described 
effect. When θ reaches 90˚ electrical, i.e. the rotor poles dispose precisely between the stator poles, the force acting on the 
rotor reaches its maximum and the stator current will be in phase with the back EMF, as Fig. 5.1 (d) shows. The amplitude 
of the stator current now fully determines the torque. If the load angle θ further rises causing the motor overloading, the 
torque will fall again, and the motor will reach an unstable operating position, thus it can stall and come to a standstill.
To develop the maximal torque at all speeds the motor is to be driven by the inverter capable to keep the voltage-frequency 
ratio constant. Nevertheless, the maximal torque that the motor can develop diminishes at low speed because of the 
voltage drop across the stator resistance. This obstacle can be avoided by boosting the input voltage. At the same time, 
the synchronous motor dynamics is complicated also due to the problems of the torque swinging.
5.2	
Synchronous servo drive
Benefits of servomotors. Since the synchronous motor spins at the synchronous speed at all loads, an open-ended speed 
control scheme may suffice for some applications, such as fans, compressors, etc.
Unlike the common-mode FESM, the PMSM have numerous advantages, like best efficiency and compact design due to 
the use of rare-earth magnetic system. They are widely used in high performance variable-speed close loop servo drives. 
To provide these benefits, the servo drive is composed by the PMSM with the built-in position encoder, external inverter 
and controller that jointly support the load angle

 between the stator current vector and the rotor flux linkage vector 
similarly to the dc motor as shown before in Fig. 5.1 (d).

Following (5.1), an electromagnetic torque of the synchronous motor is defined as the product of the effective flux and

 Fig. 5.2 Functional circuit and performance diagrams of synchronous servo drive
The stator supply of the servomotor is similar to that of the induction machine, therefore the uniform power converters 
are designed often for both kinds of ac motors. The dc supplied typical three-phase VSI includes the power switches VT1…
VT6 and the freewheeling diodes which sinusoidal signals initialize the motor phase currents of the required frequency. 
The negative feedbacks of the momentary stator currents are arranged. The set-points IL1*, IL2*, IL3* are compared with 
the actual currents IL1, IL2, IL3 measured by the current sensors. Their differences enter the hysteresis current regulators, 
the outputs of which may obtain just two logical states, 1 or 0. The active state (1) switches the corresponding forward 
transistor on and the reverse transistor off, whereas at the passive state (0) switches the forward transistor off and the 
reverse transistor on. While the forward transistor is off, the phase current falls. Since the current riches the minimum 
permissible level, the hysteresis current regulator will change its state and switches the forward transistor on while the 
reverse transistor becomes off. As a result, the phase current starts to grow. Since the current riches up the maximum 
possible level, the hysteresis regulator changes the state again and switches the forward transistor off while the reverse 
transistor is on, causing the phase current to decrease. Using this sliding control mode, the cycle repeats and the phase 
current follows the reference signal with a delay dependent on the hysteresis width.
The aim of the control system is to derive the current torque of the motor. This means the stator field must always lead by 
90˚ when the drive is motoring and lag by 90˚ when it is regenerating. Herewith, the stator field is to be forward shifted in 
the motoring mode or backward shifted in the regeneration mode with respect to the rotor position. To be able to drive a 
servomotor with a maximum possible torque and to hold the load angle θ near 90˚ electrical, the control system adds 90˚ 
to or subtracts 90˚ from the value of the position angle, according to the direction of rotation and the direction of torque 
and calculates the associated torque. To this aim, the rotor of the motor М is coupled with the rotor position encoder BQ 
fitted on the motor shaft in such a way that the starting lag angle between the stator and the rotor MMF is 120˚ and the 
ending lag angle is 60˚. Therefore, the rotor position encoder senses the rotor displacement angle.
To “rotate” the stator field by assigning its magnitude and direction, the corresponding position of the stator rotating 
field is determined for each rotor position as following. The rotor position encoder generates the signals BQ1…BQ6 as the 
timing diagram in Fig. 5.2 (b) shows.

These signals arrange a three-phase system of rectangle pulses within the period 2π. The sequence order of these pulses 
depends on the required rotational direction. To determine the rotation angle precisely, a “home” pulse (z-phase pulse), 
that is the pulse generated once per the encoder turn, provides the zero crossing presented as a reference point. Further, 
continuously measured rotor position θ is used as the torque feedback signal shown in the circuit diagram in Fig. 5.2 (a). 
Switching algorithm. The switching algorithm may be different, for example the traditional six-step scheme is popular, 
in which case the transition occurs every 60° of the shaft turn, or the more sophisticated SVM algorithms can be used. At 
that, the torque rises from θ = 60° to θ = 90° and then drops until θ = 120°. Then, the switching occurs and the process 
repeats. As a result, the average load angle is

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Synchronous Motor Drives
To provide the current flow in the stator according to the torque requirements, the control signals are then multiplied by 
the signal of the speed regulator. Thus, using the high resolution signals from the encoder the sine-shape motor currents 
are generated by electronic arrangement. This results in a very smooth, precise running of the motor and in a high quality 
control. 
Operating speeds of up to 50000 rpm are possible. In the case of multi-pole motors the electronic components can limit 
the speed, since more commutation cycles must be run through per motor revolution. The maximum speed is selected 
with service life considerations of the ball bearings at the maximum permissible residual unbalance of the rotor. Together 
with the electronic components, the servomotor achieves service life of several tens of thousands of hours.

Step motor drive 
Application area. A step motor, or stepper, is the synchronous small power machine destined for the tracing and 
positioning. This electromechanical actuator converts digital inputs to analog motion through the controller electronics. 
There are various types of step motors such as solenoid activated, variable reluctance, PM and synchronous inductor. Step 
motor normal operation consists of discrete angular motions of uniform magnitude rather than continuous motion. It 
is particularly well suited to applications where the controller signals appear as pulse trains. One pulse causes the motor 
to increment one angle of motion. The normal steppers have an accuracy of 3 to 5 % of the step value without error 
accumulation. Most step motors are used in an open-ended system configuration, which can result in oscillations. To 
overcome this, either complex circuits or feedback is employed thus resulting in a close loop system. 
As compared with other electric drives, the step drive is possessed the structural simplicity, the broad speed range, and 
the small static error within the single step. Because of the sensorless, gearless, and brushless construction, this drive is 
of high reliability. Other advantages concern the possibility of the very low speed development upon the loads directly 
connected to the motor shaft because, unlike the collector motors, the step motors produce the maximum torque at the 
low speeds and do not operate at overspeeds. Its energy consumption does not depend on the load.
At the same time, the stepper open-ended system speed of response is limited because of possible stability lost in transients. 
Such drive has high sensitivity to oscillations of the moment of inertia and the static torque. It undergoes the resonance 
and can lose the position control without the feedback. Its application area is limited by the small power systems of mean 
accuracy, usually about one kilowatt.
Commutation. The stepper rotor rotates in the strong concordance with the number of the set-point pulses and stops at 
overtorque. The sketch of the stepper design is shown in Fig. 5.3 (a). Its toothed rotor of the variable magnetic resistance 
is manufactured from the soft electrotechnical steel without magnetization. The stator pole endings are also toothed. The 
ratio between the step and the teeth numbers are selected in the way that the small shift occurs between the stator teeth 
and the non-excited pole teeth. As the voltage is applied to the winding, the rotor seeks the closed flux position and its 
teeth stops opposite the current-flowing poles. Therefore, to rotate the rotor the motor phases must be switched alternately.

The 2-, 3- and 4-phase steppers are supplied from the pulse controller which includes the pulse commutator and the winding 
power amplifiers. The resulting rotor angle corresponds to the number of commutations of the stator winding whereas 
the rotation direction is defined by the commutation order, and the angular speed depends on the switching frequency. 
Thanks to the commutator, each control pulse dislocates the corresponding pole thus exiting the synchronisation torque 
which rotates the rotor to the position of the maximum flux linkage.
The pulse commutator can operate at different algorithms, such as alternate, pair, or synchronous switching. The alternate 
switching (Fig. 5.3 (b)) produces the minimum consumed power. At pair commutation (Fig. 5.3 (c)) as the regular pulse 
comes, one of the windings is switched off but the adjacent winding is switched on. This is the most popular mode which 
provides higher efficiency, better damps the transients, and has the simpler control architecture. The synchronous tapping 
of the three adjacent windings (Fig. 5.3 (d)) provides an effective stepper operation at the inertial load thanks to the 
improved stability in the resonant frequency band.

Models of induction motor
Passport data. AC motors are used worldwide in many applications. There are many types of AC motors, but this chapter 
focuses on induction motors, the most common type of motor used in industrial applications. The motors of this type may 
be part of a pump or fan or connected to some other form of mechanical equipment such as winders, conveyors, or mixers.
The specific data of a squirrel-cage motor are the frame size, rated power, cyclic duration factor, rated speed, current and 
voltage, power factor, enclosure, mass, and thermal class. This information is given on the motor rating plate and is relates 
to an ambient temperature of 40˚C and an installation altitude of at most 1000 meters above sea level.
As given by (4.5), the synchronous speed of ac motors depends on the pole numbers and for f1 = 50 Hz the speeds are 
listed in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Synchronous speeds of ac motors
The squirrel-cage motors with one fixed speed are generally designed as 4-pole machines as the 2-pole motors produce 
excessive noise and reduce the service life of the gear unit. The motors with higher pole number of the same power are 
of a larger volume and, due to unfavorable efficiency and power factor as well as the higher price, are not as economical.
Slip. At any given point in time, the magnetic field for the induction motor stator windings is exerting forces of attraction 
and repulsion against the rotor bars. This causes the rotor to rotate, but not exactly at the synchronous speed. After (4.5), 
the rated speeds of the synchronous motor nM, ωM at the rated power PM in the motoring mode are always less than the 
synchronous speeds n0, ω0. The difference between the synchronous and actual speeds is called a slip, which is defined as

Thus, the slip is expressed through the slip speed as a fraction of the synchronous speed, often presented in percent. The 
slip is zero at the synchronous speed and unity at zero speed. With small drive systems, less that of 0.5 kW output power, 
the rated slip is approximately of 10 %, while the larger drives have the slip of 2…5 %.

 – the power factor which defines the mutual disposition of U1 and I1 for the complex stator reactance Z1;
θ – the load angle;
θ12 – the angle between the stator and rotor fluxes.
Here, an applied voltage U1 excites both the stator current I1 and the rotor current I2. Each current has two components. 
Their real (active, β) components are defined by the load. These components participate in the torque T and EMF E1 and 
E2 producing. Vector E1 of the stator EMF follows U1. Vector E2 of the rotor EMF has the opposite direction and the rotor 
current I2 follows E2. The imaginary (reactive, α) component of the magnetization current I12 = I1 + I2 creates an effective 
flux linkage ψ12 in phase with I12 along the α direction. This reactive flux-producing component enlarges the full current 
and heats the induction motor, especially at low speeds. The stator and rotor flux linkages ψ1 and ψ2 differ from ψ12 by the 
leakage flows ψ1σ = L1σI1 and ψ2σ = L2σI2. The induced EMF in the stator phase E1 leads the flux vector by 90°. The rotor 
current I2 lags the EMF by the phase angle φ2. The stator phase current I1 is the vector sum of I2 and I12. All the rotor 
quantities shown in the vector diagram are referred to the stator.
The vectors rotate in time and the vector model describes this rotation. In transients, the vector magnitudes and their 
mutual disposition change. Actually, the stator of the induction motor plays the role of both the armature and the inductor. 
As both the current components intercommunicate, the change of one of them changes another component.

Because the motor torque varies with speed, the speed-torque relationship is usually shown in a speed-torque curve which 
shows the motor torque as a fraction or percentage of the full-load torque over the motor full speed range. The speed-
torque diagram plotted in Fig. 6.4 (b) depicts the following:
	
d
T  – run-up torque at S = 1;
	
b
T  – breakdown torque, called also a pull-out torque;
	
b
S  – breakdown slip;
	
b
ω  – breakdown speed.
The run-up torque, also referred to as the starting torque or the locked rotor torque, is the torque the motor develops 
each time it starts at the rated voltage and frequency. When the voltage is initially applied to the motor stator there is an 
instant before the rotor turns. At this instant, the motor develops a starting torque Td. As the motor picks up the speed, 
the torque decreases slightly until the pull-up value this is slightly lower than the starting torque, but greater than the full-
load torque. As the speed continues to increase, the torque will increase to a maximum value of the full-load torque. This 
maximum value of torque is referred to as the breakdown torque Tb. Then the torque drops rapidly as the speed grows 
beyond the breakdown torque until it reaches the full-load level TL at a speed ωL slightly less than 100 % of synchronous 
speed ω0. The full-load torque is developed with the motor operating at the rated voltage UM, frequency f1, and load TM.
The run-up and breakdown torques are approximately equal to

The torque is zero at zero slip, that is, at the synchronous speed, and increases approximately linearly with slip until the 
maximum torque is reached. Once the torque reaches its breakdown value, it decreases with the increase in slip despite 
an increase of the rotor current due to reduction of the air gap flux.

This is true for both the motoring and the generating modes of operation. When the motor overcomes the breakdown, it 
stalls and the overload protection must immediately disconnect the supply to prevent damage due to overheating.
Motors are designed with speed-torque characteristics that match the requirements of common applications. Various 
motor designs have different characteristics.

Classification. When slowing down, the electrical motor enters the generator mode and its power flow is reversed. As 
soon as the supply of an induction motor is switched off, the friction forces TL cause the freewheel stop, or coasting. As

To speed-up braking, different braking modes were developed including mechanical braking, counter-force braking 
(counter-current or reversing), dynamic braking called also a dc injection braking, and regenerative braking. 
Mechanical braking. For many applications where relatively fast positioning is required, the motor is equipped with a 
mechanical brake (YB in Fig. 6.6 (a)). The brake is manufactured on the basis of the electromagnet which presses the rotated 
motor or mechanism shaft by the chocks. Switching of the brake is usually very fast. Thanks to mechanical braking, the 
mechanism stops even if the motor continuous its rotation. This is important, particularly, for the active loaded hoists, lifts, 
traction, and conveyer systems. The drawbacks of mechanical braking are the requirements on the permanent maintenance 
and improvement of the chocks, difficulty in modernisation, and heat emission at braking. Therefore, in many cases the 
brake is applied not for stop but for holding the mechanism fixedly.

Besides the applications, in which the mechanical brake is used as working brake, the brake motors are also used, if 
safety is the decisive factor. For example in hoisting applications, where the motor is brought to a standstill electrically 
in a specific position, the “holding brake” engages in order to secure the position. Similar safety requirements apply on 
the mains interruption failure where the mechanical brakes on the motors guarantee emergency stops. When the supply 
voltage is applied, the brakes release electrically. When switching off the supply voltage, the brakes engage automatically 
by spring force. In addition, the brake can be released mechanically. For mechanical release, a releasing level or a screw 
for fixing the brake is supplied.
Regenerative braking. Being the reversible machine, the induction motor turns its direction upon the change of the 
magnetic field polarity (phase order). As a convertible device, an induction machine can be employed both in the motoring 
and in the braking generator modes. In the regenerative braking mode, (II quadrant of the speed-torque characteristic in 
Fig. 3.4 and Fig. 6.4) it works at the negative slip.
Herewith the rotor turns in the same direction with the stator field but its speed exceeds the rotation speed of the magnetic 
field. To jump to this mode, an active load must be applied to the motor shaft. The regenerative mode is broadly used 
in the hoist electrical motors which speed, at the load lowering, can overcome the field rotation speed due to potential 
energy. The regenerative breakdown torque overcomes the motoring breakdown torque though the breakdown slip value 
remains the same.

Counter-force braking. More often, a counter-force braking is applied called also a counter-current braking or a plugging 
in which the motor jumps to the IV quadrant of the speed-torque characteristic in Fig. 3.4 and Fig. 6.4 upon the significant 
increase of the loading torque or at reverse. Herewith, the direction of the rotor rotation is opposite to the stator field 
direction though, like in the motoring mode, the machine generates the counter-torque for the load. The slip exceeds 
1, the current is above the run-up value, and energy is dissipated as heat. In the particular case, at 
1
=
S
, the induction 
machine keeps the transformer locked-rotor mode. This braking method is known also as a counter-feed braking or reversing 
because the polarity inversion of the running motor constitutes high mechanical and thermal loading of the machine and 
the connected transmission units. It is the generator mode in which the direction of the motor shaft rotation is opposite 
to the demanded one. To jump to this mode, the stator phases must be commutated from line 1 to line 2 in Fig. 6.6 (b) 
resulting in change of the torque sign and the power return to the mains (Fig. 6.6 (c)). The same effect may be obtained 
in the hoists when the pulled-over weight reverses the speed thus directing both the net and the motor energies to the 
load. Similarly to the starting, the optimal breakdown slip value may be found for this mode to provide the fastest braking. 
The optimal line 3 in Fig. 6.6 (b) is described as follows:

This is the suitable mode for the wound rotor motors. As this condition cannot be met in the common-mode squirrel-
cage induction motors, their counter-current braking is not time-optimal.
The counter-current braking is cheap and fast. Nevertheless, the significant drawback of this mode is high energy losses,

, 2...3 times overcoming the starting loss. Therefore, the counter-current braking is considered as one of the 
heavy modes of induction drive. Additionally, it is unreliable because since the stop point is missed, the motor runs in 
the reverse direction, causing the mechanism damage. At the same time, the braking torque, current and rate are heavy 
adjustable.
The dynamics of the motor disconnection and the following switching on the voltage of reverse phase consecution 
major depends on the motor commutation ability and the damping rate of the air gap magnetic field. The shorter is the 
commutation time, the higher are the shock currents and torques. Additional problems appear at re-switching that causes 
the reactive power to generate the motor fields and the active power to run the inertial masses. This obstacle limits the 
number of commutations per hour permissible for induction motor. 
DC injection braking. To proceed to another braking method, connect the pair of the motor phases through the brake 
resistor afterwards the motor disconnection from the mains. This dynamic braking results in mechanical energy dissipation 
in the resistor and in other winding and steel resistances (line 4 in Fig. 6.6 (b)).

More popular is a dc injection braking mode implemented in the following way. To avoid the drop of the magnetic field 
at the motor disconnection, it is excited by the external dc source 
qI  in braking (Fig. 6.6 (d)). The dc source generates 
the permanent magnetic field in the stator which creates an EMF in the windings of the rotated rotor causing the braking 
current. Interaction of the permanent stator flux and the rotor current produces the braking torque. The motor operates as 
the reversible synchronous generator in which the stator serves as the field winding and the rotor is the ac EMF-producing 
winding. The stator resistance R1 is usually low therefore the source voltage does not overcome 10...12 VDC. It is difficult 
to obtain the symmetrical stator winding connection to the dc source thus one of the typical circuits shown in Fig. 6.7 is 
used, usually the first or the third one.

Unlike the counter-feed braking, there is no danger of self-reversing in this mode. It is easy in maintenance, tuning, 
servicing, and the braking rate control. Nevertheless, the dc source increases the drive mass and weight, whereas the 
braking effect fails as the speed drops. Besides, as the motor overheating is possible, it is prohibited more than 4…6 stops 
per hour in some machines.
In power converters from Siemens this method is combined with regeneration resulting in so-called compound braking 
for small power systems with low motor efficiency.

Capacitor braking. An additional dc source for dc braking can be replaced with the capacitor battery (Fig. 6.8 (c)). Since 
the capacitors are connected, the resonance arises along with intensive self-exciting and EMF growing. As the accompany 
current demagnetizes the motor, an initially intensive braking gradually fails (Fig. 6.8 (d)). This mode of the capacitor 
braking is considered as more reliable than the dc injection braking. Nevertheless, it can be employed only if the rotor 
moment of inertia overreaches the mechanism inertia. Additionally, it is difficult to control the braking torque here, and 
the limited capacity prevents its use in applications above 5…15 kW. Therefore, in practice, for example in ALTIVAR, the 
combined capacitor-dc braking systems are used where the braking starts in the capacitor mode and completes at the dc 
supply. This approach increases efficiency and lowers losses.
In adjustable converter-fed drives, the programmable controlled stop is applied. The braking program sets the slow coasting, 
fast stop with mechanical braking, or smooth deceleration at multiple laws. The reduced adjustable frequency produces 
regeneration in the second quadrant of the mechanical characteristic with energy reimbursement to the supply network.

Pole-changing
Pole-changing motor. A pole-changing motor called also a multispeed motor or a change-speed motor is the proper solution 
of the cheap variable speed drive systems. These motors are frequently used as travel and hoist drives where the high 
speed is used as rapid traverse whereas the low speed is applied for positioning.
Using the known equation (4.5) 
p
f1

2π
=
ω
 the speed ω may be controlled by adjustment of the pole pair number p. The 
pole-changing motors are manufactured with consequent poles, of two-, three- and four speeds. In order to switch the 
pole pairs in the ratio of 1:2, the winding of each phase is divided by two sections (Fig. 7.1 (a), star and delta connections, 
4
=
p
). By changing the current direction in a section, the pole number changes. Usually two-speed motors have one 
such winding, three-speed machines have two windings one of which allows switching, and four-speed motors have two 
switching windings. As the pole-changing motors have the squirrel-cage construction, the poles are commutated in the 
stator.

Complicated structures, significant mass and size, commutations in power circuits, and the step character of the speed 
control are the drawbacks of these machines that restrict their application area.
Braking methods. For the pole-changing motors the same braking methods are used as for the common-mode squirrel-
cage motors. Besides, in electric drives built on these motors the regenerative braking is often applied to return energy to 
the mains. The most effective instant for regeneration is the pole number increasing because the braking torque promotes 
fast transition to the lowering speed. Nevertheless, for at all, this mode does not provide the overall motor stop. Therefore 
many companies, to decrease the torque inrush at pole commutation, use electronic soft-switching devices which disconnect 
a phase before commutation and connect it again after switching.
Example. In Fig. 7.2 the circuit diagram of the hoist mechanism with a pole-changing motor is presented. The circuit 
includes the normally pressed break YB, the linear contactor KM1, two direction contactors KM2 and KM3, the speed 
commutation contactor KM4, the time delay relay KT, two stroke-end switches SQ1 and SQ2, two direction buttons SB1 
and SB2, and two speed commutation buttons SB11 and SB21. The low speed motor winding is supplied through the 
contacts KM1…KM4 as soon as one of the buttons SB1 or SB2 is pressed. Contactor KM4 is supplied through SB11 or 
SB21. At staring it changes the low speed by the high speed upon the control of the relay KT.

Wound rotor induction motor drive
Rheostat control. The description to this point has been centered on the squirrel cage induction motors. Another type 
of the three-phase induction motor is the wound rotor machine. A major difference between the wound rotor motor and 
the squirrel cage motor is that the conductors of the wound rotor consist of wound coils instead of bars. These coils are 
connected through slip rings and brushes to external variable resistors or rheostats. The rotating magnetic field induces 
a voltage in the rotor windings. These machines are more expensive and bulky and less economical as compared with 
the squirrel-cage motors.
As soon as an increase of the rotor resistance 
2
R  results in the increase of the breakdown slip without b
T  and 
0
ω  change 
as (6.11) shows, addition of resistors to the rotor circuit may be used to adjust the normal operating speed called a rheostat 
control or a secondary speed control. An increase of the rotor resistance causes less current to flow in the rotor windings, 
thus decreasing the rotor speed. A decrease of the resistance causes more current to flow, thus increasing the rotor speed. 
The speed lowering from some level

The drawbacks of the rheostat speed adjustment first of all concern of wasteful power dissipation in a rotor circuit and 
the stepped control character. In addition, unstable operation at low speeds restricts the speed range by 2…4.
Starting and braking. For the rheostat starting of the wound rotor induction motor drives the specific accelerating resistors 
are required. They restrict the run-up current, increase the run-up torque, protect the driven machine against blows in 
transmissions at starting and protect the motor from overheating in the repeated starting and braking modes.
Both the counter-force and the dc injection braking of the wound rotor motor are more effective than those for the 
squirrel-cage machine. 
Example. In Fig. 7.3 (a) an induction motor М is connected to the three-phase mains through the switch QF and the 
contactor КМ1В or КМ2В. Contactors КМ5В, КМ6В and the relay KV1 give an opportunity to exclude gradually the 
steps R21 and R22 of the accelerating rheostat from the rotor circuit. The contactor KM4Q, the resistor RQ and the voltage 
relay KV2 form the counter-force circuit. The contactor KM3Q provides injection of dc for braking.
The button Forward switches on the contactor KM1B, which connects its main contacts in the stator circuit, shunts the 
button Forward by the blocking contacts, and supplies the relay KV1. The contact of this relay supplies the contactor KM4Q 
to exclude the counter-force step from the rotor circuit. The motor runs along the rheostat speed-torque characteristic of 
the first running step. As soon as the first time delay is completed, the KM4Q contact in the KM5B circuit is closed. The 
contactor KM5B shunts the step R21 of the accelerating rheostat resulting in motor running along the rheostat curve of 
the second starting step. As the second time delay is completed, the motor moves up to the natural characteristic thanks 
to the R22 exclusion by KM6B. Here the motor completes its acceleration to the steady-state speed ωL of the appropriate 
load torque TL and the starting completes.
To reverse, the button Reverse is pressed. The contactor KM1B is switched off and the relay KV1 along with the contactors 
KM4Q, KM5B, KM6B lose their supply. Now, the resistors R21, R22, and RQ are introduced into the rotor circuit. In turn, 
the button Reverse switches on the contactor KM2B the main contacts of which connect the motor stator to the reverse 
voltage. The motor comes to the counter-force mode of operation. Herein the relay KV2 actuates unplugging the contact 
in the circuits KM4Q, KM5B, KM6B and providing an operation with the maximal rotor resistance. While braking, as 
given by (6.7),

 this relay will proceed to the off state and 
the contactor KM4Q will receive the supply. The motor runs backward along the starting rheostat characteristic. Being 
pressed again, the button Forward initialises the repeated reverse.

The button Stop disconnects the contactor KM1B (or KM2B) and adds the resistors to the rotor circuit. The closing contact 
of the button Stop loops the circuit of KM3Q the main contacts of which connect two stator phases to the dc circuit. The 
motor comes to the dc injection braking. As the time delay is completed, the contactor KM3Q is switched off.

Double-phasing mode. The particular case of the asymmetrical motor supply is the event of a phase disconnection or 
break. In this single-phasing mode the stator voltage system is again resolved upon the two components, forward and inverse. 
It is assumed two identical MMF in the motor which try to rotate the rotor in opposed directions. Each MMF creates its 
own magnetic flux that induces the EMF in the rotor winding with corresponding current system. The forward magnetic 
flux interacts with the rotor currents of the forward phase consecution thus creating the forward torque. Reciprocally, the 
inverse magnetic flux and corresponding rotor current system create the inverse torque.

High losses in the motor copper and steel heat the windings thus restricting an application of the single-phasing mode 
by the low power systems.
Capacitor-run motors. As well, in the low power systems the capacitor-run motor circuits are broadly used to connect 
the three-phase motors to the single-phase circuit (Fig. 7.5). As a rule, these circuits include the work capacitor C and 
the running capacitor C0. For reverse, the running winding changes the polarity. The rated voltage and current of the 
capacitor circuit are their phase values. For example, if the motor is counted on 127/220 V and 7.3/4.2 A, its ratings are 
assumed as 127 V and 4.2 A. The required work capacitor for the circuit in Fig. 7.5 (a) is equal

At high powers these circuits are not used. The capacitor for the former two circuits is counted to the network voltage, 
for the third circuit the twofold voltage is required, and for the latter one is 15 % above the mains supply. This circuit is 
considered the most preferable. At low loading the voltage raises whereas idling is not recommended at all.

Double-phase motors. To operate in the single-phase circuits, the specific double-phase motors are manufactured which 
have two windings, the field winding L1 and the control winding L2 (Fig. 7.6 (a)). To adjust the motor, the control 
winding is affected whereas the field winding is supplied permanently. As far as the control is executed, the winding MMF 
asymmetry may result in the elliptical field shape instead of the circular one. Herewith, along with the forward voltage

The control voltage magnitude and phase as well as the space angle between the windings define the angular frequency 
and the power of these motors. Due to the rotor high resistance, the breakdown slip reaches 3…4 and the speed-torque 
characteristics of such machines are soft and non-linear (Fig. 7.6 (b)). The equation of the speed-torque characteristic of 
the double-phase motor is similar to the same equation of the three-phase motor at the asymmetrical supply.

these motors are rear used above 200 W. Their typical application area includes the refrigerator compressors and some

Voltage-frequency control
Frequency control. At the scalar control, the control variables are the dc quantities those magnitudes are adjusted. There 
are several scalar methods of the induction motor speed adjustment. 
Accordingly (4.5), to adjust the speed of an ac motor the supply frequency must be changed. Thus, in the simplest case 
the speed adjustment is made by varying the inverter frequency, thereby affecting the synchronous speed of the machine. 
There will be a small variation of the speed under the loaded conditions because of the slip which may be corrected if 
necessary. However, the sole control of the inverter frequency is unsatisfactory and rarely used for the following reasons.
As (4.1) shows, along with the frequency drop at the fixed EMF, the flux will rise and it may bring the magnetic circuit 
to saturation. Herewith, after (1.3), (6.7) and (6.9), the torque, including the breakdown torque and the run-up torque, 
will increase (Fig. 8.1 (a)). While the flux rises, the magnetizing current given by (6.4) will increase as well, resulting 
in additional motor heating. And conversely, if the frequency increases, the flux will decrease. The weakened flux will 
adversely affect the ability of the machine to develop the torque.

motor, until the rated torque is reached. In this way, to provide the start-up and overload operations the torque above the 
steady-state value is available. This is suitable for the centrifugal pumps, compressors, and fans those losses pull down 
proportionally to the speed cube. As Siemens Company calculated, at the 10 % speed drop this method saves up to 35 % 
of the consumed power. Therefore some vendors embed the frequency converters directly into the motor-gear units.
Operation above the rated voltage and frequency. As follows from 
ı


Ȧ /
;  
 an increase of the applied frequency 
results in the stator reactance growing. In order to compensate for this, the drive must simultaneously increase the voltage. 
Otherwise, the stator current, flux, and torque would decrease. Nevertheless, the voltage level above the rated value is 
usually prohibited because the motor magnetic circuit is saturated in the rated mode. Thence, when the voltage reaches 
the maximum value and the frequency is increased further, the flux and thus also the torque should be dropped in inverse 
proportion. In this range, the breakdown torque decreases quadratically below the rated torque.
Meanwhile, some applications require the motor to be operated above the rated speed. As the applied voltage may not 
exceed the rated voltage, the torque drops along with the speed rise. This is referred to as the constant power range or 
the field-weakening mode because any change in torque is compensated by the opposite change in speed. Therefore, to 
cover both the constant torque region and the constant power region, the VFC is maintained only below 50 Hz. Above 
this frequency, the voltage-frequency ratio decreases, with a corresponding decrease in torque. 
As a further alternative, the drive must be dimensioning larger to operate with the voltage and frequency above the rated 
values, for example, the motor of 230 V/50 Hz may be supplied by the inverter of 400 V at 400/230·50 = 87 Hz. The motor 
would develop 
3  times the rated power by increasing the frequency. As opposed to the operation with a non-weakened 
field, the breakdown torque in this mode of operation remains at the same level as in the mains operation. The inverter 
must be also dimensioned for the higher output.
A prerequisite for the constant torque is a steady uniform cooling of the motor, also in the lower speed range. However, 
this is impossible with fan-cooled motors since the ventilation also decreases with the decreasing speed. Thus the forced 
ventilation cooling is required. Forced cooling can be omitted at constant torque if the motor is over-dimensioned as the 
torque must therefore be reduced. 
Implementation of VFC. A variable ac voltage can be readily realized using the direct frequency converters or the dc 
link ac/ac converters, which operate in the voltage source inverting (VSI) mode and produce the required motor voltage 
waveform at all speeds. In all types of ac/ac converters, as the frequency is changed, the voltage amplitude is proportionally 
modified as Fig. 8.2 (a) shows. The corresponding circuit diagram is presented in Fig. 8.2 (b). Among the two control 
“handles”, frequency and voltage, the frequency control is by far the most critical, as small variations in frequency produce 
large changes of slip frequency and, hence, significant changes in current and torque. Thus, it is customary to slave the 
frequency to the voltage to prevent the motor from receiving an inappropriate value of the voltage-frequency ratio. The 
standard way is to place the front-end limiter (particularly a first-order filter) shown in Fig. 8.2 (b), which restricts the 
frequency change to a value which the motor can respond without drawing an excessive current or without regenerating.

Soft starters. The important application area of the open ended scalar control concerns the soft starting. Recall that 
when a motor is started at full voltage, it develops approximately 150 % starting torque and 600 % starting current. Using 
the soft starters, the motor can be started at the reduced voltage and frequency. For example, the motor may start with 
approximately 150 % torque, but only 150 % of full load current. As the motor is brought up to speed, the voltage and 
frequency are increased, and this has the effect of shifting the motor speed-torque curve. The soft starters accelerate the 
motor smoothly as the frequency and the voltage are gradually increased to the desired speed.
Examples are the multifunction microprocessor soft starters ALTISTART and TESYS from Schneider Electric which 
decrease the run-up current and prevent the shock loading by the accurate tuning of the starting torque. This equipment 
provides the adjusted starting ramps with smooth voltage rise at the S-shape and U-shape curves. To prevent the starting 
oscillation, many of them implement the duple run-up thanks to the preliminary dc excitation of the induction machine. 
Since the stator flux linkage approaches the rated level, the power inverter will switch to the normal mode.
Soft starters protect machines and cables from over-temperature at the lingering running. They prohibit the running even 
if the separate supply phase is broken or has a voltage drop. Often, they also execute the motor restart at the short-term 
supply dips and winding drying in the case of the isolation resistance decrease, etc.
Some applications need the starting torque above 150 % of the rated value. A conveyor, for example, may require 200 % 
of the rated torque for starting. To provide it, both the soft starter and the motor are to be appropriately dimensioned.
In electric drive on the basis of power converters the “start on the fly” may be applied. To this aim, the motor preliminary 
raced to some speed is smoothly accelerated by a control system to the demanded speed. In particular, electric drives 
from Omron provide automatic search the speed with a minimum current derivative corresponding to coincidence of 
the converter and stator frequencies. Some Siemens electric drives “start on the fly” even if the shaft rotates in opposite 
direction that is very effective for the fan control.

Flux-frequency control
Stabilization of stator flux. According to (4.1), the motors running on an ac line operate with a constant flux because 
voltage and frequency are keeping constant. Motors operated at the constant flux are said to have the constant torque.
Following (1.3), as long as a constant voltage-frequency ratio is maintained, the motor will expect constant torque 
characteristics. An actual torque produced, however, is dependent upon the speed and load.
At the VFC, the resistance

 Fig. 8.3 Control and mechanical characteristics and circuit diagrams of the flux-frequency control

Scalar Control of Induction Motors
Actually, the EMF calculation is rather complicated because of the R1 dependence on the temperature. In electric drives 
of some manufacturers the specific mode is introduced for the actual 
1
R  measuring and recalculation along with the 
wires heating therefore 
1
E  is counting quite accurately. Particularly, in ALTIVAR of Schneider Electric and VLT from 
Danfoss, the range of the IR-compensation reaches 30…80 V.
The discussed stator flux-frequency control supports the demanded overload capacity though at this control the induction 
motor keeps the usual drooping mechanical characteristic therefore the speed range remains moderate, D = 50…100.
Stabilization of effective flux. To compensate the stator resistance drop and the magnetization reluctance, stabilization 
of the effective flux, ψ12 = const, is to be employed. This approach is known as an effective flux-frequency control or boost 
compensation, boosting. Herewith, the additional voltage enters the system at low speeds and in the starting position. 
Thanks to the boosting unit plotted by the dotted lines in Fig. 8.3 (c), the voltage reference has a zero-frequency bias 
starting from some additional non-zero value. Particularly, the boosting voltage of MOVITRAC may reach up to 70 V at 
0
1 =
ω
. In the converters MICROMASTER from Siemens, boosting follows all the run-up and braking modes. The lines 
ψ12 in Fig. 8.3 (a, b) illustrate the boosting mode.
Slip compensation. Slip compensation yields further dynamics improvement. This method is adopted in high performance 
induction motor drives where speed regulation is of concern. Better adjustment is obtained here by changing the frequency 
as a function of the loading level, thereby controlling the slip frequency while keeping the rotor speed roughly constant. 
The angular frequency of the rotor EMF ω2 is defined from (4.5) and (6.1). Also, the slip frequency may be controlled 
directly by a speed sensor fitted to the motor shaft. The inverter frequency can then be generated by the digital summing 
of the shaft speed and the slip frequency signals as Fig. 8.3 (d) shows. Thus, the slip-control loop here is actually the torque 
control loop because the torque is practically proportional to the slip in the control range involved as follows from the 
motor speed-torque characteristic in Fig. 6.4 (b). 
As the slip compensation is based on the positive feedback (increasing load increases the output frequency), an addition 
of too much compensation may cause the drive instability.
Though the slip compensation does not provide the strong constancy of the effective flux linkage, its benefit is the linear 
control. Particularly in the drives MOVITRAC the slip compensation range reaches of 10 Hz. In the Siemens electric drives 
the same compensation provides the slip stabilizing up to 1 %. In the ALTIVAR systems the non-linear slip compensation 
known as the profile mode is implemented.
8.3	
Current-frequency control
Principle of CFC. According to (1.3), a suitable method to affect the induction motor torque and speed is to adjust 
the stator current at the stabilized rotor flux or the rotor current at the stabilized effective flux. An adjustment of the 
induction motor by changing the supply frequency along with the current control is called a current-frequency control 
(CFC). Unlike VFC, this approach requires an implementation of the current source inverter (CSI) instead of the VSI. The 
use of CSI excludes the overcurrents, even if the motor is stalled owing to the excessive load torque because the current 
is automatically limited by the inverter.

Circuit diagram of CFC. Figure 8.4 explains the method of the CFC. The circuit diagram is based on the cascade principle 
presented above in Fig. 2.4 (b). The outer loop stabilizes the speed ω measured by the speed sensor and compared with 
the set-point ω0*. The output of the speed regulator is proportional to the speed error ω2 and, accordingly (6.1), to the 
slip fraction Sω0*. As follows from (4.5), the sum of ω2 and pω represents the set-point stator frequency ω1* therefore the 
CSI will set the required speed. 
Since the slip is stabilized by the speed regulator (ω2 Ł S), the rotor flux linkage ψ2 which is inversely proportional to the 
slip can also be considered as stabilized and independent of the supply frequency. The stator current is readily accessible 
as compared to the rotor current, therefore the torque after (6.6) at I12 = const may be suitably adjusted proportionally to 
the quadrant of the stator current I1,

To control the stator current, the circuit includes an inner loop which follows the quadratic function generator I1*(ω2) and 
involves a current regulator, a feedback, and a comparator. The function generator derives the demanded stator current I1* 
dependently of the slip frequency. The current control system compares the set-point current I1* with the actual sensed 
current I1 to find the set-point δI1* of the CSI.

 Fig. 8.4 Circuit diagram of the current-frequency control
The CSI are intended for such electrical equipment that needs the control of the current value, particularly in controlled-
torque drives. Usually, these inverters are less sensitive to the parameter instability than the VSI. As compared with the 
VSI, they are not so popular because of the large input inductor and the requirement in a resistive-capacitive load. The 
switching frequency of CSI is lower, so the load current waveform is distorted, leading to larger derating of the load motor 
to avoid overheating. Thereat, this inverter is replaced usually by the traditional dc link VSI with the current feedback 
shown above in Fig. 5.2 (a). Whereas the three regulators perform independently, the transition of each leg affects both 
other phases. This may cause unnecessary switching combinations and, as a result, oscillations in the load as well as low-
order harmonics. To increase accuracy, the non-linear function generators shown in Fig. 8.4 are usually introduced into 
the CFC circuits, which compensate the quadratic current-frequency relation (6.6). This results in the stabilizing of ψ1, 
ψ12, or ψ2 similarly to VFC.

Vector Control of Induction Motors

Field-oriented control
Vector control vs. scalar control. The above discussed control methods refer to the scalar class because they are based 
on the rms (static) motor models. Nevertheless, when the currents, voltages and flux linkages of the induction motor 
change frequently, their scalar control keeps out the high dynamics. This is the reason why the accurate and quick-acting 
systems require the vector control. The primary objective of the vector control is to achieve good performance when speed 
and torque conditions change periodically or randomly. The underlying principle of the vector control is to separate out 
the component of the motor current responsible for the torque producing and the component responsible for the flux 
producing in such a way that they are magnetically decoupled, and then to control each independently. This principle 
is implemented by orientation of the arbitrary orthogonal reference frame (x, y) along one of the vectors defined the 
electromagnetic torque in (1.3) − ψ1, ψ2, ψ12, I1 or I2. Hence, the projection of this vector on the other axis equals zero. In 
this way, both the magnitude and the phase of the drive variables are controlled like in the dc motor. The chosen adjusted 
vector defines the method of the vector control.
According (1.3), accurate spatial positioning either the stator current with respect to the rotor flux linkage or the rotor current 
with respect to the effective flux linkage provides precise torque regulation. The first approach to make it is a field-oriented 
control (FOC) called also a trans-vector control. FOC is the vector method of the separate torque and flux linkage management 
in the inverter-fed electric drive systems. So far as the current is the regulation object, the CSI is required for this purpose. As 
discussed above, in practice the CSI is usually replaced by the VSI enveloped by the deep current feedbacks.
To comply the vector principle, the FOC method does not affect the actual machine variables in the phase axes (L1, L2, 
L3) but the orthogonal (x, y) variables one of which is oriented along the flux linkage vector wherefore the actual signals 
are converted and delivered to the (x, y) motor model by the forward Park’s transformer. Thanks to this approach, all the 
model variables are considered as the dc signals suitable for the control. After the calculation, the obtained control signals 
are again converted to the phase axes by the reverse Park’s transformer to supply the inverter. 
Vector diagram of FOC. Figure 9.1 shows the vector diagram of the FOC which aligns the stator current I1 with respect 
to the rotor flux linkage ψ2. The first function of the control system is to turn the reference frame (x, y) at the field 
frequency ω1. By rotation I1 relatively ψ2, the control system at all times keeps the constant projection I1x thus providing 
the constancy of ψ2 and, at the same time, adjusts the projection I1y according to the demanded torque value. As ωk = ω1, 
(4.2) transforms as follows:

Further, |ψ2| is compared with the required flux linkage |ψ2*| and their difference enters the flux regulator. Thus, the rotor 
flux is stabilized by the close loop system. Next, the fixed flux generates the commanded flux-producing component of the 
stator current I1x*. This component is compared with the actual value of I1x and the error enters the appropriate current 
regulator. After the scaling by the current regulator, the signal enters the reverse Park’s transformer.

 thus the rotor frequency can be controlled through the y-projection 
of the stator current. To this aim, another reference signal ω0* is compared with the actual motor angular frequency ω 
and their difference supplies the speed regulator. As follows from (6.1), the output of the speed regulator is proportional 
to the speed error ω2, i.e. the slip fraction Sω0* and appropriate torque-producing component of the stator current I1y*. 
This component is compared with the actual value of I1y and the error enters the appropriate current regulator. After the 
scaling in the current regulator, the signal also reaches the reverse Park’s transformer. To get ω1 for θ1 calculation in (9.2), 
the sum of ω2 and pω is derived and integrated.
The reverse Park’s transformer converts the amplitudes of the reference currents I1x*, I1y* from the (x, y) coordinate frame 
to the (α, β) frame using (4.9) and (9.2), and then to the (L1, L2, L3) reference frame using (4.8). The resulting set-point 
currents IL1*, IL2*, IL3* specify the frequency and the amplitude of the inverter output. Here, both the CSI and the current 
controlled VSI shown above in Fig. 5.2 (a) can be applied. 
As the system provides the constancy of |ψ2| and ω2, the resulting motor torque is also constant and does not depend on 
ω. That is, the stator frequency changes along with the alternating ω according (4.1) thus providing

Sensorless control. During the last decades, a variety of sensorless control systems have been investigated aiming to replace 
the speed and position sensors. For the equipment with the modest speed regulation requirements (1...2 % or more), costly 
tachometers and associated hardware can be removed from the drive. Different sensorless control systems are successfully 
used in industry. In the drives where the tachometers are omitted, the motor model unit shown in Fig. 9.2 calculates the 
angular frequency in addition to the flux linkages referring to (4.3), (4.4), and (4.6) as follows:

At the low-speed operation or standstill, however, the limitations of speed and position measurement can be found. Due 
to the drive system nonlinearity and difficulties in proper parameter identification, linear control theory is not always 
helpful. Besides, the drive dynamics usually changes with the operating point and some parameters drift in a wide range, 
depending on the system performance mode. For electric drives this problem arises especially when the rotor inertia 
changes significantly during operation. Therefore, the FOC performance, design, and implementation depend strongly on 
the accuracy of the motor parameter estimation as well as on the load, frequency, temperature variations, etc. 
9.2	
Direct torque control
DTC vs. FOC. In the systems built using the FOC principle, the frequency converter has the CSI properties thus the 
consumed current is defined only by the current control signals independently of the motor mode of operation and 
supply voltage 
1
U . Such PWM-based close loop systems control the torque indirectly through the instant stator currents. 
Oppositely, the direct torque control (DTC) implies the VSI for which the control system processes directly the stator flux 
and torque signals without having the need for inner loops with current regulators. 
In order to realize the DTC, the motor model has to provide the flux and torque estimations, quite similar to FOC. The 
motor model of DTC aims to derive the flux using available measured signals, currents and voltages in this case. Following 
the flux determination, also the motor torque and speed are computed in the motor model. Additionally, the DTC system 
includes a voltage switching unit, which implements the SVM instead of the sinusoidal PWM used in FOC. The important 
point of SVM is the proper selection of the stator voltage vector in order to maintain the flux and torque within the limits 
of two hysteresis bands. For this purpose, the control system should be able to generate the set-point voltage space vector 
treated directly at fixed sample frequency.
Circuit diagram of DTC. The scheme of induction motor DTC shown in Fig. 9.3 aligns the stator current I1 with respect 
to the stator flux linkage ψ1. Here, the Park’s transformer converts the motor currents IL1, IL2, IL3 and voltages UL1, UL2, 
UL3 obtained by sensors from the natural coordinate frame (L1, L2, L3) to the immovable orthogonal frame (α, β) using 
(4.7) and (4.10). An equivalent model of the standard induction motor (4.2)…(4.6) can be used to calculate the machine 
variables in the stationary (α, β) frame at ωk = 0 as follows:

Functional circuit of the direct torque control
Meaning enough high rotor time constant of the induction motor as compared to the calculation time of the DTC motor 
model, consider ψ2 = const within the calculation interval. Therefore, skipping the rotor parameters, the torque can be 
adjusted by the only control of ψ1 through the stator voltage. Using this assumption, the motor model unit performs the 
following online computing:

The output magnitude |ψ1| is compared with the required flux linkage |ψ1*| and their difference enters the flux hysteresis 
regulator. The output of the flux regulator takes one of the two values, 1 or 0. If the flux linkage ψ1 is less than the reference 
flux linkage ψ1*, the flux will be stepped up that corresponds to the regulator output 1. If the flux linkage ψ1 exceeds the 
reference flux ψ1*, the flux that corresponds to the regulator output 0 will be stepped down.
The speed regulator generates the slip frequency proportional to the electromagnetic torque. An electromagnetic torque 
error T12 Ł ω2 comes to the torque hysteresis regulator. The output of the torque regulator takes one of the three values, 
1, –1, or 0. The first value steps up the frequency, the second value steps it down, and zero never changes.

Switching unit for DTC. To describe the voltage switching unit, a switching model of the three-phase inverter shown 
earlier in Fig. 5.2 (a) is presented in Fig. 9.4 (a). Here, each load terminal assumes a potential defined by the control. The 
leg short-circuiting is avoided since the terminals are connected to either the positive or negative supply bus. In other 
words, the state of the single switch in a leg is off while another is conductive, except for the short protective intervals, 
when both of switch contacts are broken.

 Fig. 9.4 Switching model of the three-phase VSI
Designate the switches by the binary variables, which indicate whether the switch is in the top (1) or bottom (0) position. 
Accordingly, a three-bit binary word with eight different codes defines all possible switching states of the converter, 100, 
110, 010, 011, 001, 101, 111, and 000. These states are shown in Fig. 9.4 (b).
To proceed from the switching model to SVM, associate each binary word of Fig. 9.4 (b) with a particular space vector 
and describe the switching states of the converter by eight space vectors U0...U7.

This vector set includes six active voltage space vectors U1 to U6 corresponding to the switching states 100, 110, 010, 011, 
001, 101, and two zero voltage space vectors U0, U7 keeping with 111 and 000. On the plane shown in Fig. 9.4 (c) (known 
also as the Concordia graph), six active space vectors are situated 60° apart, segmenting the plane by equal sectors. Voltage 
vectors U1, U3, U5 are oriented along the axes of L1, L2, and L3 phases. Supply dc voltage Ud specifies the amplitudes of the 
space vectors. The demanded reference vector is determined by its module u* and phase θ*. Allowable magnitude of the

The switching unit aims to approximate the line-modulated signal with one of the eight space vectors available in VSI thus 
providing high drive performance in terms of minimizing unwanted harmonics and reducing the switching frequency. 
For this purpose, the switching unit, as the SVM modulator implies, has two integer entries, the reference voltage signal 
u* and the reference frequency signal f*. The first signal changes the time duration of the zero space vectors in the full 
modulation period, which decreases if u* = 1 and increases in the case of u* = 0. The second signal defines the number of 
carrier periods in each modulation period of the generated voltage. It decreases if f* = 1, increases in the case of f* = –1, 
and keeps the state if f* = 0. The additional input θ1 indicates the sector of the current space vector. 
Table 9.1 implements a possible commutation DTC algorithm. It shows how, dependently of u* and f*, the positions of 
the voltage vectors are selected. Among the two allowable zero vectors, that is selected which requires the minimum 
switching number.

Tracking and positioning
Path control. Vector control is the compulsory operation of the electric drives provided the path control that ensures a 
match between the currently measured positions and a target position of the driven mechanism. Position data are usually 
obtained from position encoders and path regulators, which are used to perform the proper path control. The higher 
the number of pulses of the incremental position sensor, the better path jerk-free operation can be achieved, especially 
at low speeds. To generate the pulses, optical sensors and resolvers are mounted on the driven machine and adjusted by 
different ways. Typically, all path sensors distinguish between the rising and falling pulse edges. 
The tracking and the positioning path electric drives are discerned. The former ones control the path all round the operation 
whereas the latter manage only the required final and intermediate positions of the mechanism route. The main feature 
of the tracking drive is a tracking accuracy measured by a tracking error which must be as low as possible at the highest 
permissible motion speed along the tracking contour. The major characteristic of the positioning drive is a positioning 
accuracy measured by a position error (called also a droop) in the demanded points which must again be minimal at the 
highest permissible motion speed between the target points.
Tracking. The main tracking modes are the hold, the permanent speed, the permanent acceleration, and the harmonic 
oscillation tracking. 
In the first mode, at 
0

, the tracking error is caused by the load disturbance 
L
T . The hold error

is defined by the torque quality factor kδφ which describes the ratio of the load torque to the induced error (Fig. 9.5 (a)). 
When the low inertial ratio (3.5) exists between the motor and the mechanism, the slight vibration arises at standstill. At 
some cases, an elasticity of the mechanical gears and improper lubrication cause jerking at standstill as well. To prevent 
these shortcomings, different damping measures are applied.

is usually evaluated in the harmonic oscillation mode (Fig. 9.5 (c)). This error includes also the instrumental errors from 
the set-point devices and sensors, gear kinematic errors, their backlashes and gaps, control system errors, etc.
Positioning. Unlike the tracking, the positioning mode relates to the load moving from some fixed point to another one in a 
minimal time. Three kinds of this mode can be distinguished. At the small relocations, the regulators and converters operate 
within the linear zone of their characteristics. At the middle motions, the motor and converter currents are restricted.

On the long paths, the motor speed is also limited in addition to the current restriction. In any case, the load motion 
must be finished by the accurate stopping within the minimal coasting distance and the position lock in the demanded 
point. The electric drives from Omron and Mitsubishi, for example, are served with the special functions to provide the 
machine locking by automatic gain changing and suppression of slight vibrations within the separate step.
So called homing known also as a home position return represents the particular case of positioning. It is the process of 
the machine tool fitting in the starting working position. To make it, the working process begins usually with zeroing i.e. 
with the search of the coordinate zero point. 
To perform positioning, the stroke-end and the strokeless position systems are used (Fig. 9.6) dependently of the presence of 
the mechanical path limiters. As well, the incremental and the absolute position systems are distinguished. The incremental 
system built on the basis of the pulse position sensors starts its operation by homing and calculates each pulse throughout 
the motion until the final position. Such system loses the path information in the case of the supply switching off. The 
absolute systems are built on the absolute encoders which memorize the starting base. At the supply disconnection they 
reproduce the home position and, thus, are able to continue operation. Usually they involve the backup batteries or the 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

 Fig. 9.6 Positioning systems and methods
Positioning accuracy at small relocations is defined mainly by the static error 
ϕ
δ , thus, the higher is the system torque 
quality factor, the more accurate will be the low-speed positioning. However, at the middle and large scale movement, the 
high quality factor results in transient deterioration. To process the middle-distance paths, the best is the triangular speed 
diagram which involves the linear acceleration following the linear deceleration. To perform the large-distance motion, the 
best is the trapezoidal speed diagram with the linear acceleration following the permanent speed motion and the linear 
deceleration at the end. One peculiarity of the positioning systems is the need in the quality factor variation during the 
operation therefore some manufacturers provide the specific gain search function for this purpose.

Homing. Multiple homing algorithms have been developed by different drive vendors. 
The simplest is the situation in which the homing starts in the drive switching-on position with the data setting homing 
when the operator sets manually the zero of the count system. The stopper type homing expects the stopping upon the 
collide on the mechanical stopper mounted on the bench and assumes the definite machine durability.
Other homing methods apply the signals of the proximity dogs which are mounted in front of the home position address. 
At the instant of the proximity dog collision, the electric drive begins to slow down its motion from the fast feed (rapid 
freerate) to the creep speed, known also as a settling speed. The acceleration and deceleration rates of the positioning 
electric drive are usually defined by the appropriate time constants τd and τq counted at the rated motor speed 
M
ω
 (Fig. 
9.7 (a)). Due to the up-to-speed errors and smoothing near the demanded point 
*
ω , the actual run-up td and braking 
tq times differ from the appropriate expected times td* and tq*. The full positioning cycle includes the running time td, the 
rapid freerate time tL, the braking time tq, the home position shift distance time called the settling time ts at the settling speed 
s
ω , and the dwell time t0 of the in-position range.

At the count type front end reference homing, after the acquiring of the front end of the proximity dog signal, the system 
calculates the required braking and settling paths before running to the home position address (Fig. 9.7 (b)).
At the dog type rear end reference homing , after the speed lowering to the settling level, the system “waits” the rear end 
of the proximity dog and then goes along the settling path to the home position (Fig. 9.7 (c)).
At the dog cradle type homing, after the acquiring the proximity dog signal, the system “waits” the z-phase pulse of the 
position encoder. The z-phase pulse generated once per the encoder turn provides the system to go along the settling 
path to the home position (Fig. 9.7 (d)).
At the count type homing, after the acquiring the proximity dog signal, the system goes along the counted braking path, then 
“waits” the z-phase pulse of the position encoder and then runs along the settling path to the home position (Fig. 9.7 (e)).
At the dog type homing, after the braking, the system “waits” the rear front of the proximity dog and the z-phase pulse of 
the position encoder, and then runs along the settling path to the home position (Fig. 9.7 (f)).
As the gear backlashes and gaps decrease the positioning quality, some accurate electric drives, particularly from Siemens, 
include additional function of the backlash compensation which corrects the positioning program at the reverse operations.
