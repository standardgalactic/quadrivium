Cinema's transformation over the course of the last century, from a sideshow 
curiosity to a vast global industry, witnessed the release of hundreds, then 
thousands of films with each passing year. It is impossible to calculate 
how many films have been produced since the Lumieres' collection of 
shorts premiered at Le Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris on December 
28, 1895. Many of them will have faded into obscurity, rarely seen by more 
than a small group of people beyond those who were involved in their 
production. The films featured in this book not only represent a drop in a 
vast cinematic ocean, they aim to cover the breadth of choice that has been 
available to audiences since the early days of feature filmmaking—from the 
films made to entertain, to those with more aspirational aims.
1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was never intended as a "best 
of" collection—although a brief scan through the contents finds the 
majority of titles featured in Sight and Sound's Critics Top 250 and Directors' 
Top 100 greatest films poll present here. There are likely to be films here 
that you hate as much as you love. You may consider some entries to be 
insufficiently artful or far too rarefied for mass appeal, depending on your 
taste. Yet every film chosen will provoke a reaction, either good or bad, but 
never indifferent. 
The last decade has seen increased focus and activity in both the 
preservation and rediscovery of films. In some cases, unearthed footage has 
offered a chance to re-view an already established classic. The discovery of 
a complete print of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, previously thought lost forever, 
in a museum in Buenos Aires has allowed audiences the opportunity to 
enjoy the film in the way that Lang himself envisaged it. (One can only wish 
the same for Erich von Stroheim's Greed, Orson Welles's The Magnificent 
Ambersons, or Sam Peckinpah's Major Dundee.) The work of organizations 
like The World Cinema Fund has also enabled audiences to see a wealth 
of cinema that had only existed in a precarious state. We can now watch 
such films as Ahamed El Maanouri's Trances, Kim Ki-Young's The Housemaid, 
Ritwik Ghatak's Titash Ekti Nadir Naam, and Mário Peixoto's Limite in the way 
their makers would have wished.
Peixoto's sublime 1931 film is one of the new additions to this edition, 
which is the first extended revision of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You 
Die since its original publication in 2003. Although the majority of films 
have remained, fifty titles have been added. Some, like Lang's Metropolis, 
have been unearthed. Others have seen their stock rise and more emphasis 
placed on their importance in world cinema history. They include Yonggang 
Wu's The Goddess, Kent McKenzie's The Exiles, Franz Osten's A Throw of Dice, 
Ted Kotcheff's Wake in Fright, or Herbert Ponting's The Great White Silence. 
Hopefully, audiences unfamiliar with these films will seek them out and 
enjoy them just as much as better-known titles. 
There is also the issue of changing trends and tastes. Not all films 
survive the test of time. In some cases they have been removed to make

way for another title from the same era or by the same director, one which 
might deserve greater recognition or is simply a better example of a 
filmmaker's work. Such is the case with Hitchcock's Sabotage and The Lady 
Vanishes, Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light and Summer with Monika, Luis 
Buñuel's The Young One and The Exterminating Angel, Orson Welles's The 
Stranger and F for Fake, Rogers and Hammerstein's Seven Brides for Seven 
Brothers and Oklahoma, Bill Forsythe's Housekeeping and Local Hero, and 
David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch and Dead Ringers. In other instances, films 
have been included because their initial omission might now seem odd. 
Who could begrudge Rudolf Valentino in The Eagle, The Adventures of Prince 
Achmed, Mrs Minniver, Some Came Running, Mary Poppins, Diva, Hana-bi, or 
even The Towering Inferno being brought into the fold?
In attempting to balance the survey across the entire spectrum 
of cinema's history, acknowledging the important impact of certain 
individuals, as well as the films they made or appeared in, it was occasionally 
necessary to trim the presence of certain figures. I Walked with a Zombie is a 
fine film, but Val Lewton's 1940s productions are already well represented. 
As for Alfred Hitchcock, there is so much material already available on him, 
it was decided to reduce his presence slightly. (I hope no one will resent the 
removal of Hitchcock's flawed psychological thriller Spellbound in favor of 
Henry Hathaway's ludicrously entertaining and under-appreciated drama 
Peter Ibbertson, which André Breton himself described as a "triumph of 
surrealist thought.")
Some removals were tough. One Eyed Jacks, The Man From Laramie, 
Angel Face, and Utu are fine films. The inclusion of The Devils, The Hired 
Hand, Distant Voices, Still Lives, and Sleeping Dogs is not meant to suggest 
they are better. Their addition, like all the other titles in this book, both new 
and old, are a provocation—throwing down the gauntlet for you to choose 
your own movies to die for.

1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is, as the title suggests, a book that 
seeks not just to inform and to prescribe, but also to motivate—to turn its 
curious readers into ardent viewers and to make it obvious that the pressure 
is on, that time is short, and that the number of films eminently worth 
watching has become very long indeed.
Nowadays, "Top 10 Movie" lists survive almost exclusively as annual 
critics' polls; and talk of "The 100 Greatest Films" tends to be restricted either 
to specific genres, such as comedy, horror, sci-fi, romance, or the Western, or 
to particular national cinemas, such as France, China, Italy, Japan, the U.K, or 
the U.S. All of this points to the impossibility, or at least the irresponsibility, 
of selecting a number less than (oh let's just say) a grand to work with when 
it comes to preparing a list of "best," or most valuable, or most important, or 
most unforgettable movies—a list that aims to do justice and give coverage 
to the entire history of the medium.
With this latter goal in mind, even 1001 can quickly start to seem like 
way too small a number. Maybe not so small if silent movies were kept off 
the list; or avant-garde films; or Middle Eastern films; or animated movies; 
or documentaries; or shorts. . . . But these strategies of exclusion are in 
the end all just ways of taking the pressure off, of drawing arbitrary lines 
in the cinematic sand and refusing to make the heap of difficult decisions 
necessary to end up with a limited selection of films that treats all the 
heterogeneous types and traditions comprising motion picture art with 
equal and all due respect. The book you are holding in your hands takes a 
great risk in offering up an all-time, all-genre, all-world, must-see films list. 
But it is a risk well worth taking, and if you make the effort to go and see the 
films discussed herein, you can be sure to die a happy moviegoer. In short: 
The more you see, the better off you'll be.
So how to determine which 1001 movies must be seen before dying? 
How much easier (and less controversial) it would be to come up with 1001 
movies that should be avoided at all costs! It is no surprise to learn that 
film criticism hardly qualifies as an exact science—Roger Ebert's infamous 
formula "Two thumbs up, way, way up!" notwithstanding—and it is hardly 
an exaggeration to claim that one person's Midnight Cowboy may well be 
another one's Ishtar. Perhaps there are ways of objectively comparing, 
even ranking, highly codified and historically specific cycles, movements, 
or subgenres, such as the 1970s Italian thriller—in this case on the basis of 
the form's aestheticized violence, labyrinthine narratives, and psychological 
resonance. And maybe it really is legitimate to separate out Hitchcock's 
indisputable classics (North By Northwest, Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho, 
The Birds, and so on) from what are often held to be the director's weaker 
efforts (Torn Curtain, Family Plot, Topaz, The Paradine Case). But what basis 
could there possibly be for deciding between Tsai Ming-liang's What Time Is 
It There? and Robert Aldrich's What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Or between 
George Méliès's A Trip to the Moon and Marleen Gorris's A Question of Silence? 
If the goal of this book is indeed to include a little bit of everything, then

Introduction  By Steven Jay Schneider

what is to prevent the resulting list of 1001 films from being just a cinematic 
smorgasbord—a case of mere variety taking precedence over true value?
Good questions all. The first step in determining the 1001 movies to be 
included here involved taking a close look at a number of existing "greatest," 
"top," "favorite," and "best" film lists, and prioritizing titles based on the 
frequency with which they appeared. This allowed us to identify something 
like a canon of classics (including modern and contemporary films) that we 
felt confident warranted a spot in this book on the joint basis of quality and 
reputation. By no means did every film that turned up on these shorter, 
occasionally idiosyncratic lists make our cut of 1001, but the exercise 
at least gave us some key reference points and significantly reduced the 
unavoidably subjective nature of the selection process.
After we tentatively settled on an initial batch of around 1,300 titles, 
we proceeded to go through the list again (and again, and again, and 
again) with the dual—and conflicting—aim of reducing the overall number 
while still achieving sufficient coverage of the medium's various periods, 
national cinemas, genres, movements, traditions, and notable auteurs. 
With respect to the latter, we took the notion of an "auteur" in the loosest 
possible sense to include not only directors (Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, 
John Cassavetes, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Abbas Kiarostami, 
Satyajit Ray, among others), but also actors (Humphrey Bogart, Marlene 
Dietrich, Toshiro Mifune), producers (David O. Selznick, Sam Spiegel, Irving 
Thalberg), screenwriters (Ernest Lehman, Preston Sturges, Cesare Zavattini), 
cinematographers (Gregg Toland, Gordon Willis, Freddie Young), composers 
(Bernard Herrmann, Ennio Morricone, Nino Rota), and others.
9

We were also mindful of not giving automatic preference—free passes, 
as it were—to self-consciously "quality" productions or high cinematic art 
(historical epics, Shakespeare adaptations, Russian formalist experiments) at 
the expense of ignoring the so-called "low" genres (slapstick comedy, 1930s 
gangster films, blaxploitation cinema), or even movies that are of somewhat 
questionable aesthetic merit (Pink Flamingos, Saturday Night Fever, The Blair 
Witch Project), wholeheartedly populist appeal (Top Gun, Rain Man, Big, E.T.: 
The Extra-Terrestrial), or dubious ideological or ethical value (The Birth of a 
Nation, Freaks, Triumph of the Will, Salò or The 120 Days of Sodom). Instead 
we endeavored to adjudge each of our candidate selections on their own 
terms, which meant first figuring out as best we could just what the "terms" 
in question consisted of—not always an easy or obvious task, as in the 
case of Pink Flamingos, whose infamous tagline read, "An exercise in poor 
taste"—and then coming up with ways of separating the wheat from the 
chaff (even when the difference between the two might seem so slight as 
to be indiscernible or irrelevant).
What's that old saying, something along the lines of "Even if you could 
have filet mignon every single day, once in a while you're bound to crave a 
hamburger." The point here is, even if your filmgoing preferences lie heavily 
on the side of acknowledged world classics (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, 
Raging Bull, Battleship Potemkin) or the treasures of European art cinema 
(L'Avventura, Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Tango in Paris), there is sure to 
come a time when you long to see a movie with a wholly different agenda, 
whether it's a Hollywood blockbuster (Jurassic Park, The Empire Strikes Back, 
Titanic), an underground oddity (Scorpio Rising, Flaming Creatures, Hold Me 
While I'm Naked), or a cult curiosity piece (El Topo, Seconds, Slacker, Mondo 
Cane, Tetsuo). As we envisioned it, our main task was to make sure that 
whatever your cinematic tastes—in general, or on those days when you 
feel like trying something new—this book would be a menu where every 
dish is a winner.
Finally, after making the last agonizing cuts that were required to 
bring the list down to a "mere" 1001, the remaining step was for us 
to tweak the results based on the feedback and suggestions offered 
by our esteemed group of contributors, whose collective experience, 
expertise, and passion for watching, discussing, and writing about 
motion pictures has ensured that, while no list of all-time-greatest 
anythings can possibly be perfect (whatever that means) or utterly 
uncontroversial (and wouldn't that be dull?), the one you have 
before you is, to be sure, as good as it gets. But it isn't just the list itself 
that makes this book so special: It is also the specially commissioned entries 
that accompany each of the 1001 movies included on that list—concise, 
thoughtful, stimulating essays that seamlessly combine important plot 
details, insightful commentary, cultural and historical context, and a fair 
share of trivia besides. (George Lucas was originally set to direct Apocalypse 
Now? Who knew?) Don't be fooled by the ease with which these essays are 
10

digested. There is a definite skill—one might even say an art—to writing 
a profound, engaging piece of only 500 words on a film like Casablanca, 
The Searchers, or The Rules of the Game, much less 350 words on Boogie 
Nights, Cries and Whispers, or The Night of the Hunter, or (gasp!) 200 words 
on Marketa Lazarova, The Pianist, or Cleo from 5 to 7. Somehow, with great 
aplomb, these authors have managed to pull it off, and brilliantly.
As for my own experience working on this book, I can only say that the 
pain of having to cross several personal favorites off the list was more than 
made up for by the pleasures of admiring the resulting medley, of reading 
so many wonderful film entries by so many wonderful writers on film, and 
of finding out so much about the history, traditions, and secret treasures 
of the cinema that I never knew before. Even if you have already seen all 
1001 movies discussed and paid tribute to in these pages (congratulations, 
though I seriously doubt it), I'm sure you will benefit tremendously from 
reading about them here.
But the clock continues to tick away. . . . So start reading already,
 and keep watching!

Le voyage dans la lune  Georges Méliès, 1902
A Trip to the Moon
When thinking about A Trip to the Moon, one's mind is quickly captured 
by the original and mythic idea of early filmmaking as an art whose "rules" 
were established in the very process of its production. This French movie 
was released in 1902 and represents a revolution for the time, given its 
length (around fourteen minutes), as compared to the more common 
two-minute short films then being produced. 
A Trip to the Moon directly reflects the theatrical personality of its 
director, Georges Méliès, whose past as a theater actor and magician 
influenced the making of the movie. The film boldly experiments 
with some of the most famous cinematic techniques, such as 
superimpositions, dissolves, and editing practices that would be widely 
used later on. Despite the simplicity of its special effects, the film is 
generally considered the first example of science-fiction cinema. It offers 
many elements characteristic of the genre—a spaceship, the discovery 
of a new frontier—and establishes most of its conventions.
The movie opens with a Scientific Congress in which Professor 
Barbenfouillis (played by Méliès himself) tries to convince his colleagues 
to take part in a trip to explore the moon. Once his plan is accepted, the 
expedition is organized and the scientists embark in a space ship. The 
missile-like vessel lands right in the eye of the moon, which is represented 
as an anthropomorphic being. Once on the surface, the scientists soon 
meet the hostile inhabitants, the Selenites, who take them to their King. 
After discovering that the enemies easily disappear in a cloud of smoke 
with the simple touch of an umbrella, the French men manage to escape 
and return to Earth. They fall into the ocean and explore the abyss until 
they are finally rescued and honored in Paris as heroes.
Méliès's movie deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in 
world cinema history. Despite its surreal look, A Trip to the Moon is an 
entertaining and groundbreaking film able to combine the tricks of the 
theater with the infinite possibilities of the cinematic medium. Méliès 
was an orchestrator more than a director; he also contributed to the 
movie as a writer, actor, producer, set and costume designer, and 
cinematographer, creating special effects that were considered 
spectacular at the time. The first true science-fiction film cannot be 
missed by a spectator looking for the origin of those conventions that 
would later influence the entire genre and its most famous entries.
In a more general sense, A Trip to the Moon can be regarded as the 
movie that established the major difference between cinematic fiction 
and nonfiction. At a time when filmmaking mostly portrayed daily life 
(such as in the films of the Lumière brothers at the end of the 19th century), 
Méliès was able to offer a fantasy constructed for pure entertainment. 
He opened the doors to future film artists by visually expressing his 
creativity in a way utterly uncommon to movies of the time.  CFe

The Great Train Robbery  Edwin S. Porter, 1903
Most historians regard The Great Train Robbery as the first Western, 
initiating a genre that, in a few short years, became the most popular 
in American cinema. Made by the Edison Company in November 
1903, The Great Train Robbery was the most commercially successful 
film of the pre-Griffith period of American cinema and spawned a 
host of imitations.
What is exceptional about Edwin S. Porter's film is the degree of 
narrative sophistication, given the early date. There are over a dozen 
separate scenes, each further developing the story. In the opening 
scene, two masked robbers force a telegraph operator to send a false 
message so that the train will make an unscheduled stop. In the next 
scene, bandits board the train. The robbers enter the mail car, and, 
after a fight, open the safe. In the following scene, two robbers 
overpower the driver and fireman of the train and throw one of them 
off. Next, the robbers stop the train and hold up the passengers. One 
runs away and is shot. The robbers then escape aboard the engine, 
and in the subsequent scene we see them mount horses and ride off. 
Meanwhile, the telegraph operator on the train sends a message 
calling for assistance. In a saloon, a newcomer is being forced to 
dance at gunpoint, but when the message arrives everyone grabs 
their rifles and exits. Cut to the robbers pursued by a posse. There is a 
shoot-out, and the robbers are killed.
There's one extra shot, the best known in the film, showing one of 
the robbers firing point blank out of the screen. This was, it seems, 
sometimes shown at the start of the film, sometimes at the end. Either 
way, it gave the spectator a sense of being directly in the line of fire.
One actor in The Great Train Robbery was G.M. Anderson (real name 
Max Aronson). Among other parts, he played the passenger who is 
shot. Anderson was shortly to become the first star of Westerns, 
appearing as Bronco Billy in over a hundred films, beginning in 1907.
In later years some have challenged the claim of The Great Train 
Robbery to be regarded as the first Western, on the grounds that it is 
not the first or not a Western. It is certainly true that there are earlier 
films with a Western theme, such as Thomas Edison's Cripple Creek 
Bar-Room Scene (1899), but they do not have the fully developed 
narrative of Porter's film. It's also true that it has its roots both in stage 
plays incorporating spectacular railroad scenes, and in other films 
of daring robberies that weren't Westerns. Nor can its claim to being 
a true Western be based on authentic locations, because The Great 
Train Robbery was shot on the Delaware and Lackawanna Railroad in 
New Jersey. But train robberies, since the days of Jesse James, had 
been part of Western lore, and other iconic elements such as six-
shooters, cowboy hats, and horses all serve to give the film a genuine 
Western feel.  EB

The Birth of a Nation  D.W. Griffith, 1915
Simultaneously one of the most revered and most reviled films ever 
made, D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation is important for the very 
reasons that prompt both of those divergent reactions. In fact, rarely has 
a film so equally deserved such praise and scorn, which in many ways 
raises the film's estimation not just in the annals of cinema but as an 
essential historic artifact (some might say relic).
Though it was based on Thomas Dixon's explicitly racist play The 
Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan, by many accounts 
Griffith was indifferent to the racist bent of the subject matter. Just how 
complicit that makes him in delivering its ugly message has been cause 
for almost a century of debate. However, there has been no debate 
concerning the film's technical and artistic merits. Griffith was, as usual, 
more interested in the possibilities of the medium than the message, 
and in this regard he set the standards for modern Hollywood. 
Most overtly, The Birth of a Nation was the first real historical epic, 
proving that even in the silent era audiences were willing to sit through 
a nearly three-hour drama. But with countless artistic innovations, Griffith 
essentially created contemporary film language, and although elements 
of The Birth of a Nation may now seem quaint or dated, virtually every 
film is beholden to it in one way, shape, or form. Griffith introduced the 
use of dramatic close-ups, tracking shots, and other expressive camera 
movements; parallel action sequences, crosscutting, and other editing 
techniques; and even the first orchestral score. It's a shame all these 
groundbreaking elements were attached to a story of such dubious value.
The first half of the film begins before the Civil War, explaining the 
introduction of slavery to America before jumping into battle. Two 
families, the northern Stonemans and the southern Camerons, are 
introduced. The story is told through these two families and often their 
servants, epitomizing the worst racial stereotypes. As the nation is torn 
apart by war, the slaves and their abolitionist supporters are seen as the 
destructive force behind it all. The film's racism grows even worse in its 
second half, set during Reconstruction and featuring the rise of the Ku 
Klux Klan, introduced as the picture's would-be heroes. The fact that 
Griffith jammed a love story in the midst of his recreated race war is 
absolutely audacious. It's thrilling and disturbing, often at the same time.
The Birth of a Nation is no doubt a powerful piece of propaganda, 
albeit one with a stomach-churning political message. Only the puritanical 
Ku Klux Klan can maintain the unity of the nation, it seems to be saying, 
so is it any wonder that even at the time the film was met with outrage? 
It was protested by the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP), sparked riots, and later forced Griffith himself 
to answer criticisms with his even more ambitious Intolerance (1916). 
Still, the fact that The Birth of a Nation remains respected and studied to 
this day—despite its subject matter—reveals its lasting importance.  JKl

Les vampires  Louis Feuillade, 1915
Louis Feuillade's legendary opus has been cited as a landmark movie 
serial, a precursor of the deep-focus aesthetic later advanced by Jean 
Renoir and Orson Welles, and a close cousin to the surrealist movement, 
but its strongest relationship is to the development of the movie thriller. 
Segmented into ten loosely connected parts that lack cliffhanger 
endings, vary widely in length, and were released at irregular intervals, 
Les vampires falls somewhere between a film series and a film serial. The 
convoluted, often inconsistent plot centers on a flamboyant gang of 
Parisian criminals, the Vampires, and their dauntless opponent, the 
reporter Philippe Guérande (Edouard Mathé).
The Vampires, masters of disguise who often dress in black hoods 
and leotards while carrying out their crimes, are led by four successive 
"Grand Vampires," each killed off in turn, each faithfully served by the 
vampish Irma Vep (her name an anagram of Vampire), who constitutes the 
heart and soul not only of the Vampires but also of Les vampires itself. 
Portrayed with voluptuous vitality by Musidora, who became a star as a 
result, Irma is the film's most attractive character, clearly surpassing the 
pallid hero Guérande and his hammy comic sidekick Mazamette (Marcel 
Lévesque). Her charisma undercuts the film's good-versus-evil theme 
and contributes to its somewhat amoral tone, reinforced by the way the 
good guys and the bad guys often use the same duplicitous methods 
and by the disturbingly ferocious slaughter of the Vampires at the end.
Much like the detective story and the haunted-house thriller, Les 
vampires creates a sturdy-looking world of bourgeois order while also 
undermining it. The thick floors and walls of each château and hotel 
become porous with trap doors and secret panels. Massive fireplaces 
serve as thoroughfares for assassins and thieves, who scurry over Paris 
rooftops and shimmy up and down drainpipes like monkeys. Taxicabs 
bristle with stowaways on their roofs and disclose false floors to eject 
fugitives into convenient manholes. At one point, the hero unsuspectingly 
sticks his head out the window of his upper-story apartment, only to be 
looped around the neck by a wire snare wielded from below; he is yanked 
down to the street, bundled into a large basket, and whisked off by a 
taxi. In another scene, a wall with a fireplace opens up to disgorge a 
cannon, which slides to the window and lobs shells into a nearby cabaret.
Reinforcing this atmosphere of capricious stability, the plot is built 
around a series of tour de force reversals, involving deceptive appearances 
on both sides of the law: "dead" characters come to life, pillars of society 
(a priest, a judge, a policeman) turn out to be Vampires, and Vampires 
are revealed to be law enforcers operating in disguise. It is Feuillade's 
ability to create, on an extensive and imaginative scale, a double world—
at once weighty and dreamlike, recognizably familiar and excitingly 
strange—that is of central importance to the evolution of the movie 
thriller and marks him as a major pioneer of the form.  MR

Intolerance  D.W. Griffith, 1916
Perhaps in part a retort to those who found fault with the racial politics 
in The Birth of a Nation (1915), D.W. Griffith was equally concerned to 
argue against film censorship. This was addressed more directly in the 
pamphlet issued at the time of Intolerance's exhibition, The Rise and Fall 
of Free Speech in America. Griffith's design for this film, which he finalized 
in the weeks following the release of his earlier epic production, is to 
juxtapose four stories from different periods of history that illustrate 
"love's struggle throughout the ages." These include a selection of 
events from the life of Jesus; a tale from ancient Babylon, whose king is 
betrayed by those who resent his rejection of religious sectarianism; the 
story of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of French Protestants by King 
Charles  IX of France on the perfidious advice of his mother; and a 
modern story in which a young boy, wrongly convicted of the murder 
of a companion, is rescued from execution at the last minute by the 
intervention of his beloved, who gains a pardon from the governor. These 
stories are not presented in series. Instead, Griffith cuts from one to 
another and often introduces suspenseful crosscutting within the stories 
as well. This revolutionary structure proved too difficult for most filmgoers 
at the time, who may also have been put off by Intolerance's length. 
Griffith may have invested as much as $2 million in the project, but the 
film never came close to making back its costs, even when recut and 
released as two features, The Fall of Babylon and The Mother and the Law.
The enormous sets for the Babylon story, which long afterward 
remained a Hollywood landmark, were dressed with 3,000 extras. These 
production values were equaled by the sumptuous costumes and 
elaborate crowd scenes of the French story. Though others wrote some 
title cards, Griffith himself was responsible for the complicated script, 
which he continued to work on as production progressed. His stock 
company of actors performed admirably in the various roles. Constance 
Talmadge is particularly effective as the "Mountain Girl" in love with the 
ill-fated Prince Belshazzar (Alfred Paget) in the Babylon story, as are Mae 
Marsh and Bobby Harron as the reunited lovers in the modern story.
As in The Birth of a Nation, Griffith uses the structures of Victorian 
melodrama to make his political points. Intolerance is examined through 
the lens of tragic love, which lends emotional energy and pathos to the 
narratives. In the Babylonian story, Belshazzar and his beloved Attarea 
(Seena Owen) commit suicide rather than fall into the hands of the 
victorious Cyrus the Persian (George Siegmann); in the French story, a young 
couple, he Catholic and she Protestant, are unable to escape the massacre.
Intolerance is a monument to Griffith's talent for screenwriting, 
directing actors, designing shots, and editing—a one-of-a-kind 
masterpiece on a scope and scale never equaled. Meant to persuade, this 
film exerted more influence on the Soviet revolutionary cinema of Sergei 
Eisenstein and others than on Griffith's American contemporaries.  RBP

Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari  
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  Robert Wiene, 1919
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is the keystone of a strain of bizarre, fantastical 
cinema that flourished in Germany in the 1920s and was linked, somewhat 
spuriously, with the Expressionist art movement. If much of the 
development of the movies in the medium's first two decades was 
directed toward the Lumière-style "window on the world," with fictional 
or documentary stories presented in an emotionally stirring manner 
designed to make audiences forget they were watching a film, Caligari 
returns to the mode of Georges Méliès by presenting magical, theatrical 
effects that exaggerate or caricature reality. Officials perch on ridiculously 
high stools, shadows are painted on walls and faces, and unrealistic 
backdrops and performances are stylized to the point of hysteria.
Writers Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz conceived the film as taking 
place in its own out-of-joint world, and director Robert Wiene and set 
designers Hermann Warm, Walter Roehrig, and Walter Reimann put a twist 
on every scene and even intertitle to insist on this. Controversially, Fritz 
Lang—at an early stage attached as director—suggested that Caligari's 
radical style would be too much for audiences to take without "explanation." 
Lang devised a frame story in which hero Francis (Friedrich Feher) 
recounts the story—of sinister mesmerist charlatan Dr. Caligari (Werner 
Krauss), his zombielike somnambulist slave Cesare (Conrad Veidt), and a 
series of murders in the rickety small town of Holstenwall—and is finally 
revealed to be an asylum inmate who, in The Wizard of Oz (1939) style, has 
imagined a narrative that incorporates various people in his daily life. 
This undercuts the antiauthoritarian tone of the film as Dr. Caligari, in the 
main story an asylum director who has become demented, is revealed as 
a decent man out to help the hero. However, the asylum set in the frame 
story is the same "unreal" one seen in the flashback, making the whole film 
and not just Francis's bracketed story somehow unreliable. Indeed, by 
revealing its expressionist vision to be that of a madman, the film could 
even appeal to conservatives who deemed all modernist art as demented.
Wiene, less innovative than most of his collaborators, makes little use of 
cinematic technique, with the exception of the flashback-within-a-
flashback as Krauss is driven mad by superimposed instructions that he 
"must become Caligari." The film relies on theatrical devices, the camera 
fixed center stage as the sets are displayed and the actors (especially 
Veidt) providing any movement or impact. Lang's input served to make 
the movie a strange species of amphibian: It plays as an art movie to the 
high-class crowds who appreciate its innovations, but it's also a horror 
movie with a gimmick. With its sideshow ambience, hypnotic mad 
scientist villain, and leotard-clad, heroine-abducting monster, The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a major early entry in the horror genre, introducing 
images, themes, and characters that became fundamental to the likes of 
Tod Browning's Dracula and James Whale's Frankenstein (both 1931).  KN

The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance are, rightly, Griffith's most renowned 
films, remembered for their remarkable manipulations of story and 
editing. But another of his films, 1919's Broken Blossoms, has always 
stood out as among his very best, and it is surely his most beautiful.
Along with William Beaudine's glorious Mary Pickford vehicle 
Sparrows, Broken Blossoms exemplifies what was known in Hollywood 
as the "soft style." This was the ultimate in glamour photography: 
Cinematographers used every available device—powder makeup, 
specialized lighting instruments, oil smeared on the lens, even immense 
sheets of diaphanous gauze hanging from the studio ceiling—to soften, 
highlight, and otherwise accentuate the beauty of their stars. In Broken 
Blossoms, the face of the immortal Lillian Gish literally glows with a lovely, 
unearthly luminescence, outshining all other elements on the screen.
The beauty of Broken Blossoms must be experienced, for it is truly 
stunning. Gish and her costar, the excellent Richard Barthelmess, glide 
hauntedly through a London landscape defined by fog, eerie alleyway 
lights, and arcane, "Orientalist" sets. The film's simple story of forbidden 
love is complemented perfectly by the gorgeous, mysterious production 
design, created by Joseph Stringer. No other film looks like Broken Blossoms.
The collaboration between Griffith and Gish is one of American 
cinema's most fruitful: the two also worked together on Intolerance, The 
Birth of a Nation, Orphans of the Storm, and Way Down East, in addition 
to dozens of shorts. Surely this director-actor collaboration ranks with 
Scorsese-De Niro, Kurosawa-Mifune, and Leone-Eastwood; indeed, it is 
the standard by which all others should be judged. Griffith finds a perfect 
balance between the story's mundanity and the production's seedy 
lavishness (much of the film takes place in opium dens and dockside 
dives). It is the tension between the everyday and the extraordinary that 
drives on Broken Blossoms, securing its place in film history.  EdeS

Within Our Gates  Oscar Micheaux, 1920
Successful author, publisher, homesteader, and filmmaker Oscar Micheaux 
is widely considered the father of African American cinema; only his 
second effort, Within Our Gates is one of forty films Micheaux wrote, 
directed, and independently produced between 1919 and 1948. Besides 
its gripping narrative and artistic merits, Within Our Gates has immense 
historical value as the earliest surviving feature by an African American 
director. Powerful, controversial, and still haunting in its depiction of the 
atrocities committed by white Americans against blacks during this era, 
the film remains, in the words of one critic, "a powerful and enlightening 
cultural document [that] is no less relevant today than it was in 1920."
Within Our Gates follows Sylvia Landry (Evelyn Preer), a Southern black 
teacher who travels north in an effort to raise money for her school. But this 
is only one of several stories that Micheaux weaves together in his gripping 
look at the physical, psychological, and economic repression of African 
Americans. The film was repeatedly edited by the censors, who found the 
rape and lynching scenes too provocative after the 1919 Chicago race riots. 
Lost for seventy years, Within Our Gates was rediscovered at the Filmoteca 
Española in Madrid and restored soon after.  SJS

The last of D.W. Griffith's sweeping historical melodramas, Orphans of the 
Storm tells the story of two young girls caught in the turmoil of the 
French Revolution. Lillian and Dorothy Gish are Henriette and Louise 
Girard, two babies who become "sisters" when Henriette's impoverished 
father, thinking of abandoning his daughter in a church, finds Louise 
and, moved by pity, brings both girls home to raise. Unfortunately, they 
are left orphaned at an early age when their parents die of the plague. 
Louise is left blind by the disease, and so the girls make their way to Paris 
in search of a cure. There they are separated. Henriette, kidnapped by 
the henchmen of an evil aristocrat, is befriended by a handsome 
nobleman, Vaudrey (Joseph Schildkraut). Louise is rescued by a kind 
young man after she falls into the River Seine but, brought to his house, 
she is put to work by the man's cruel brother. Adventures follow, 
including imprisonment in the Bastille, being condemned to death 
during the Reign of Terror, and being saved from the guillotine by the 
politician Danton (Monte Blue), whose speech advocating the end of 
such bloodshed is one of the film's most impassioned moments.
Although Orphans of the Storm is based on a play that had been 
successful in the preceding decade, Griffith wrote the script during 
shooting. Despite the resulting complications, the film is a masterpiece 
of beautiful staging and acting, with the Gish sisters giving what are 
perhaps the finest performances of their careers.  RBP

Orphans of the Storm  D.W. Griffith, 1921

The Phantom Carriage not only cemented the fame of director-
screenwriter-actor Victor Sjöström and Swedish silent cinema, but also 
had a well-documented, artistic influence on many great directors and 
producers. The best-known element of the film is the representation of the 
spiritual world as a tormented limbo between heaven and earth. The scene 
in which the protagonist—the hateful and self-destructive alcoholic 
David Holm (Sjöström)—wakes up at the chime of midnight on New 
Year's Eve only to stare at his own corpse, knowing that he is condemned 
to hell, is one of the most quoted scenes in cinema history.
Made in a simple but time-consuming and meticulously staged 
series of double exposures, the filmmaker, his photographer, and a lab 
manager created a three-dimensional illusion of a ghostly world that 
went beyond anything previously seen at the cinema. More important, 
perhaps, was the film's complex but readily accessible narration via a 
series of flashbacks—and even flashbacks within flashbacks—that 
elevated this gritty tale of poverty and degradation to poetic excellence.
Looking back at Sjöström's career, The Phantom Carriage is a 
theological and philosophical extension of the social themes introduced 
in his controversial breakthrough Ingeborg Holm (1913). Both films 
depict the step-by-step destruction of human dignity in a cold and 
heartless society, driving its victims into brutality and insanity. The 
connection is stressed by the presence of Hilda Borgström, unforgettable 
as Ingeborg Holm and now in the role of a tortured wife—another 
desperate Mrs. Holm. She is yet again playing a compassionate but poor 
mother on her way to suicide or a life in the mental asylum.
The religious naïveté at the heart of Selma Lagerlöf's faithfully adapted 
novel might draw occasional laughter from a secular audience some 
eighty years later, but the subdued, "realist" acting and the dark fate of 
the main characters—which almost comes to its logical conclusion, save 
for a melodramatic finale—never fails to impress.  MT

Germaine Dulac's celebrated film is one of the earliest examples of both 
feminist and experimental cinema. The plot depicts the life of a bored 
housewife trapped in a bourgeois marriage. The most captivating aspect 
of The Smiling Madame Beudet, however, is composed of elaborate 
dream sequences in which the eponymous housewife (Germaine 
Dermoz) fantasizes a life outside her monotonous existence. Using radical 
special effects and editing techniques, Dulac incorporates early avant-
garde aesthetics to offset the vivid feminine power of Madame Beudet's 
imaginary life against the dullness of the one she shares with her 
husband (Alexandre Arquillière). When the complex visual elaboration of 
her potential liberation through fantasy—the only thing that can put a 
smile on her face—is cut short by the appearance of her husband in her 
daydreams, she is left with only one possible solution: kill him.
Dulac not only addresses the oppressive alienation of women within 
patriarchy but, more importantly, uses the medium of film to offer viewers 
a radical and subjective female perspective. This led to her picture's 
inclusion in the first Festival of Women's Films in New York in 1972.  CO

A major commercial success in Germany in 1922, Dr. Mabuse was intended 
not merely as flamboyant thriller but as pointed editorial, using the figure 
of the master-of-disguise supercriminal to embody the real evils of its era.
The subtitles of each of the film's two parts, harping on about "our 
time," underline the point made obvious in the opening act, in which 
Mabuse's gang steals a Swiss-Dutch trade agreement—not to make use 
of the secret information, but to create a momentary stock market panic 
that allows Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), in disguise as a cartoon plutocrat 
with top hat and fur coat, to make a fast fortune. He also employs a 
band of blind men as forgers, contributing to the feeling that German 
audiences at the time had that money was worthless.
The film's eponymous villain shuffles photographs as if they were a 
deck of cards, selecting his identity for the day from various disguises, 
but it is nearly two hours before his "real" name is confirmed. In Part II, 
he appears as a one-armed stage illusionist and finally loses his grip on 
the fragile core of his identity to become a ranting madman, tormented 
by the hollow-cheeked specters of those he has killed and, in a moment 
that still startles, by the creaking-to-life of vast, grotesque statues and 
bits of machinery in his final lair. Director Fritz Lang, and others, would 
return to Mabuse, still embodying the ills of the age—notably in the 
early talkie Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (1933) and the 1961 high-tech 
surveillance melodrama The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse.  KN

Nanook of the North  Robert J. Flaherty, 1922
The history of "documentary" filmmaking—an approach generally thought 
to involve a filmmaker's recording of an unmediated reality—begins 
really with the invention of the cinema itself, but for better or worse the 
nickname "father of the documentary" has generally been bestowed on 
Robert J. Flaherty. Raised near the U.S.-Canadian border, Flaherty loved 
exploring the far-off wilderness from an early age, and after his studies 
went to work as a mineral prospector in Canada's Far North. Before one of 
his trips, someone suggested he bring along a movie camera; over the 
next few years, Flaherty would film hours of material of both the land and 
its inhabitants, which in 1916 he began showing in private screenings in 
Toronto. The response was enthusiastic, but just as he was about to ship 
his footage to the United States, he dropped a cigarette ash and his entire 
negative—30,000 feet—burst into flames. Flaherty took years to raise 
enough money to go back north and shoot again; when he finally 
succeeded (thanks to Revillon Frères, a French furrier), he decided to 
focus his efforts on filming one Nanook, a celebrated Inuit hunter. Based 
on his memory of the best of what he had shot before, Flaherty fashioned 
the events to be included in the new film, including things Nanook 
commonly did, some things he never did, and some things he used to do 
but hadn't done in a while. The result was the deeply influential, but 
endlessly debated, Nanook of the North.
A series of vignettes that detail the life of Nanook and his family over 
a few weeks, Flaherty's film is a kind of romantic ode to human courage 
and fortitude in the face of an overwhelming and essentially hostile 
Nature. Despite Nanook getting pride of place in the title, many audiences 
are left with the memory of the arbitrary fury of the arctic landscape. 
Indeed, the film received a powerful (if tragic) publicity boost when it was 
revealed that Nanook and his family had indeed perished in a raging 
snowstorm not long after the film was completed, giving Nanook of the 
North's extraordinary and already powerful final sequence—in which the 
family looks for shelter from a storm—a terrible poignancy.
Many contemporary film students are critical of the picture because 
so much of it seems staged for the camera—several times you can 
practically hear Flaherty barking out directions to Nanook and the 
others—but the film's many defenders over the years, such as André 
Bazin, wisely pointed out that Flaherty's most remarkable achievement 
here is the way he seemed to capture the texture of their daily lives. The 
details of the walrus hunt, such as whether or when a gun was used, 
seem less important than Flaherty's decision to simply follow in long 
shot Nanook's slow crawl toward his prey; if Nanook's beaming face as 
he warms his son's hands is part of an act, then he was simply one of the 
great screen performers in history. Call it what you will—documentary, 
fiction, or some hybrid—Nanook of the North remains one of the few 
films that completely deserves its description as a classic.  RP

Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens  
Nosferatu, a Symphony of Terror  F.W. Murnau, 1922
Bram Stoker's Dracula inspired one of the most impressive of all silent 
features. The source material and the medium seem almost eerily meant 
for each other. Stoker's novel, largely written in the form of a series of 
letters, is light on traditional dialogue and heavy on description, perfect 
for the primarily visual storytelling of silent films. It is fitting that a 
story of the eternal conflict between light and darkness should be 
matched to a format consisting almost entirely of the interplay of light 
and darkness.
Director F.W. Murnau had already established himself as a star of 
the German Expressionist movement when he decided to adapt the 
Stoker novel, renamed Nosferatu after legal threats from Stoker's estate. 
In fact, the finished film barely evaded a court order that all copies 
be destroyed, but in the end little of Stoker's novel was ultimately 
altered, save the names of the characters, and indeed the success of 
Nosferatu led to dozens of subsequent (and mostly officially sanctioned) 
Dracula adaptations.
Yet Nosferatu, even so many years later, stands apart from most 
Dracula films. One key difference is the striking presence of star Max 
Schreck, whose surname translates to "fear." Schreck plays the 
eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity. His rodent-like, 
sinister creature of the night is little different from the rats at his 
command, lurching instinctively toward any sight of blood with barely 
disguised lust.
This explains the terror of Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim), who 
has traveled to the isolated castle of Count Orlok (Schreck) high in 
the Carpathian Mountains to help the strange man settle some legal 
matters. The mere mention of Orlok silences the townsfolk with fear, and 
Hutter's suspicions deepen when he discovers that the stagecoach 
taking him to the castle has no driver. Orlok himself offers little solace. 
He keeps odd hours and leaves Hutter locked in a tower. Fearing for 
his life—and specifically the bloodlust of his captor—he escapes and 
returns to Bremen, Germany. But Orlok follows, setting his sights not on 
Hutter but on his innocent wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder): "Your wife has a 
beautiful neck," comments Orlok to Hutter. Just as her connection with 
Hutter helps rescue him from Orlok's clutches, Ellen discovers that it is 
also up to her to lure the demonic creature to his (permanent) demise: 
to be vaporized by the rays of the morning sun.
With Nosferatu, Murnau created some of cinema's most lasting and 
haunting imagery: Count Orlok creeping through his castle, striking 
chilling shadows while he's stalking Hutter; Orlok rising stiffly from his 
coffin; the Count, caught in a beam of sunlight, cringing in terror before 
fading from view. He also introduced several vampire myths that fill not 
just other Dracula films but permeate popular culture as well.  JKl

Häxan  Benjamin Christensen, 1923
Pioneering Danish filmmaker Benjamin Christensen's notorious 1922 
"documentary" Häxan is a bizarre silent-film oddity that explores the 
nature of witchcraft and diabolism from ancient Persia through then-
modern times using various cinematic approaches, from still images 
to models to vivid, dramatic reenactments. It is a hard film to pin 
down, and it defies any boundaries of genre, especially those of the 
documentary film, which in the early 1920s was still amorphous and 
undefined. Part earnest academic exercise in correlating ancient fears 
with misunderstandings about mental illness and part salacious horror 
movie, Häxan is a truly unique work that still holds the power to 
unnerve, even in today's jaded era.
To visualize his subject matter, Christensen fills the frames with every 
frightening image he can conjure out of the historical records, often 
freely blending fact and fantasy. We see a haggard old witch pull a 
severed, decomposing hand out of a bundle of sticks. There are shocking 
moments in which we witness a woman give birth to two enormous 
demons, see a witches' sabbath, and endure tortures by inquisition 
judges. We watch an endless parade of demons of all shapes and sizes, 
some of whom look more or less human, whereas others are almost 
fully animal—pigs, twisted birds, cats, and the like.
Christensen was certainly a cinematic visionary, and he had a keen 
notion of the powerful effects of mise-en-scène. Although Häxan is 
often cited as a key forerunner of such modern devil-possession films as 
The Exorcist (1973), it also brings to mind Tobe Hooper's effective use of 
props and background detail in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) to 
create an enveloping atmosphere of potential violence. Häxan is a film 
that needs to be viewed more than once to gain a full appreciation of 
the set design and decoration—the eerie use of props, claustrophobic 
sets, and chiaroscuro lighting to set the tone. It is no surprise that the 
Surrealists were so fond of the film and that its life was extended in the 
late 1960s, when it was reissued as a midnight movie with narration by 
none other than William S. Burroughs.  JKe

Greed is Stroheim's most famous film, but Foolish Wives is his masterpiece. 
Like Greed, it was heavily reedited, but what remains (especially after a 
major 1972 restoration) is a more accomplished work. He himself stars as 
the unscrupulous Count Karamzin, a Monte Carlo-based pseudoaristocrat 
who sets out to seduce the neglected wife of an American diplomat.
This witty, ruthlessly objective film confirms its director as the cinema's 
first great ironist. Karamzin is skewered with sardonic relish—brazenly 
insincere, thoroughly indiscriminate in his taste in women, and, when 
the chips are down, contemptibly cowardly—but he and his decadent 
colleagues are so much more entertaining than the virtuous American 
hubby and his commonplace spouse. The film's tone of cool, lively 
detachment is enhanced by its exhaustive elaboration of the world 
around the characters, articulating space through visual strategies (such 
as layered depth, peripheral motions, and multiple setups) that make us 
intensely aware of the entire 360-degree field of each scene. Stroheim 
stacks the deck by placing his dull, flat Americans in dull, flat spaces; 
otherwise, there's hardly a shot that doesn't dazzle the eye with rich, 
shimmering interplay of detail, lighting, gesture, and movement.  MR

Arguably as great a film as the better-known The General (1927), Our 
Hospitality—Buster Keaton's masterly satire of traditional Southern 
manners—kicks off with a beautifully staged dramatic prologue that 
establishes the absurdly murderous parameters of the age-old feud 
between two families. By the time the main story takes over, Buster's 
Willie McKay is a twenty-something innocent, raised in New York but 
returning (thanks to a wondrously funny odyssey involving a primitive 
train) to his familial town, where his courtship of a girl met en route—
the daughter, as it happens, of the clan still sworn to spilling his blood—
places him in deadly peril, even though Southern hospitality dictates 
his enemies treat him properly as long as he's in their home.
Much of the humor thereafter derives from a darkly ironic situation 
whereby Willie determines to remain a guest of his would-be killers 
while they smilingly try to ensure his departure. Keaton's wit relies not 
on individual gags but on a firm grasp of character, predicament, 
period, place, and camera framing (see how he keeps the camera 
moving after he's fallen off the ludicrous bicycle it has been tracking 
alongside); the result is not only very funny, but also dramatically 
substantial and suspenseful—nowhere more so than the justly celebrated 
sequence when Willie saves his beloved from plunging over a waterfall. 
Never was Keaton's sense of timing so miraculous, and his ability to 
elicit laughter and excitement simultaneously so gloriously evident.  GA

Despite a ludicrously unconvincing happy ending grafted on at the 
insistence of UFA, F.W. Murnau's The Last Laugh remains a very impressive 
attempt to tell a story without the use of intertitles. The plot itself is 
nothing special—a hotel doorman, humiliated by his loss in status when 
he is demoted to bathroom attendant because of his advancing years, 
sinks so low that he is tempted to steal back his beloved uniform (the 
symbol of his professional pride). In some respects the film is merely a 
vehicle for one of Emil Jannings's typically grandstand performances.
Above and beyond this somewhat pathetic parable exists one of 
Murnau's typically eloquent explorations of cinematic space: the camera 
prowls around with astonishing fluidity, articulating the protagonist's 
relationship with the world as it follows him around the hotel, the city 
streets, and his home in the slums. Some of the camera work is "subjective‚" 
as when his drunken perceptions are rendered by optical distortion; at 
other times, it is the camera's mobility that is evocative, as when it passes 
through the revolving doors that serve as a symbol of destiny. The 
dazzling technique on display may, in fact, be rather too grand for the 
simple story of one old man, yet there is no denying the virtuosity either 
of Murnau's mise-en-scène or of Karl Freund's camera work.  GA

station in 1895. Railwayman Sisif (Severin-Mars) saves Norma (Ivy Close) 
from the crash and brings her up as his daughter. Both he and his son 
Elie (Gabriel de Gravone) fall in love with her, so Sisif marries her off to a 
rich man. She and Elie eventually fall in love; both her husband and Elie 
die after a struggle. Sisif goes blind and dies, after being tended by Norma.
The Wheel's melodramatic plot was combined with wide-ranging 
literary references, including Greek tragedy, as is suggested by Sisif's 
name (Sisyphus) and his blindness associated with incestuous desire 
(Oedipus). These "pretensions" were seen by intellectuals to conflict with 
the film's extraordinary cinematographic techniques (such as the 
accelerating montage sequences based on musical rhythms), which 
related the film to avant-garde preoccupations with a "pure" cinema and 
Cubist concerns with machines as the emblem of modernity. The film's 
contradictions are admirably brought together in the central metaphor 
of the title: the wheel of fate (Sisif/Sisyphus ends up driving the funicular 
railway up and down Mont Blanc), the wheel of desire, and the wheel of 
the film itself with its many cyclical patterns.  PP

Eisenstein was a revolutionary in every sense, forging a radical new breed 
of montage-based cinema from an unprecedented merger of Marxist 
philosophy, Constructivist aesthetics, and his fascination with the visual 
contrasts, conflicts, and contradictions built into the dynamics of film itself.
Strike was intended as one installment in a series of works about the 
rise of Marxist-Leninist rule. Censorship by the new Soviet government 
thwarted many of Eisenstein's dreams in ensuing years, and this series 
never got beyond its initial production. Nonetheless, the feverishly 
energetic Strike stands on its own as a tour de force of expressive 
propaganda and the laboratory in which seminal ideas for his later 
silent masterpieces—The Battleship Potemkin (1925), October (1927), and 
Old and New (1928)—were first tested and refined.
Strike depicts a labor uprising in a Russian factory, where workers are 
goaded toward rebellion by the owners' greed and dishonesty. We see 
simmering unrest among the laborers, an act of treachery that pushes 
them into action, the excitement of their mutiny followed by the 
hardships of prolonged unemployment, and finally the counterstrike of 
the factory owners, abetted by troops. The film ends with an electrifying 
example of what Eisenstein called "intellectual montage," intercutting the 
massacre of strikers with images of animals being slain in a slaughterhouse.
The acting in Strike is as unconventional as its editing techniques, 
mixing naturalistic portrayals of the workers with stylized portrayals of 
the owners and their spies. The film illustrates Soviet theories of "typage," 
calling for actors who physically resemble the character types they play, 
and the "collective hero," whereby a story's protagonist is not a single 
individual but rather all the people standing on the correct side of history.
Strike's political imperatives have dated; its visual power has not. "I don't 
believe in the kino-eye," Eisenstein once remarked, referring to a catchword 
of colleague and rival Dziga Vertov. "I believe in the kino-fist." That hard-
hitting philosophy galvanizes every sequence of this unique film.  DS

Sherlock, Jr.  Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle & Buster Keaton, 1924
Sherlock, Jr. is Buster Keaton's shortest feature film, yet it is a remarkable 
achievement, possessing a tightly integrated plot, stunning athleticism 
(Keaton did all his own stunts, unknowingly breaking his neck during 
one of them), artistic virtuosity, and an avant-garde exploration of the 
dichotomy of reality versus illusion. He plays a projectionist and  detective 
wannabe falsely accused of stealing from his girlfriend's father. Framed 
by a rival suitor (Ward Crane), the young man is banished from the 
girl's home. Dejected, he falls asleep on the job. In his dream state, he 
transcends into the screen (in a brilliant sequence of optical effects), where 
he is the dapper Sherlock, Jr.—the world's second greatest detective.
Unbelievable stunts and complicated gags move this 44-minute film 
along at a fever pitch. At first, the cinematic reality refuses to accept 
this new protagonist and the tension between the two worlds is 
magnificently presented via a montage of spatial shifts that land our 
bewildered hero in a lion's den, amid roaring waves, and in a snowdrift. 
Gradually, he assimilates fully into the film world. In the mise-en-abyme 
storyline, the villain (also played by Ward Crane) is trying to kill the hero 
in vain, before Sherlock, Jr. solves the mystery of the stolen pearls.
Sherlock, Jr. not only features the stunts for which Keaton is famous, 
but also poses a number of issues. From a social perspective, it is a 
commentary on the fantasies about upward mobility in American 
society. On a psychological plane, it introduces the motif of the double 
striving for fulfillment in imaginary spaces, as the protagonist is unable 
to achieve it in reality. Above all, the film is a reflection on the nature of 
art, a theme that resurfaces in The Cameraman (1928), when Keaton's 
focus shifts from medium to spectator.
Keaton's films remain interesting today, in part due to the director-
star's almost otherworldly stoicism (compared to Chaplin's pathos), and 
in part due to their occasionally surreal nature (admired by Luis Buñuel 
and Federico García Lorca) and their delving into the nature of cinema 
and existence. Chuck Jones, Woody Allen, Wes Craven, and Steven 
Spielberg are among the filmmakers to pay tribute to his mischief.  RDe
"[Keaton] kind of said, 
'Never play a crazy 
scene with anything 
but reality.' He was 
always intensely and 
desperately true."

1924

Herbert Ponting's footage of Captain Scott's ill-fated attempt to lead the 
first team to the South Pole was never intended as a film. It was the 
director's skill as a photographer that guaranteed him passage on the 
Terra Nova. His images were to be the centerpiece of Scott's lecture series, 
which would travel the world and recoup some costs from the expedition. 
But with the death of Scott and his team, Ponting returned to Britain and 
devoted the rest of his life to celebrating the heroism of these pioneers.
The director had assembled a detailed record of daily life on the ship, 
as Scott—a fleeting presence throughout the film—and his men 
prepared for their epic journey. With time to kill during preparations, 
Ponting filmed Ross Island, the mission's base camp, often going to 
extraordinary lengths—and great personal danger—to capture the most 
arresting images. Once Scott embarked on his mission, which dominates 
the last section of the film, Ponting blends life as it continues on Ross 
Island with animated sequences, mapping the group's final journey. 
The completed film was unsuccessful commercially, even when 
released with a soundtrack, as 90° South (1933). In 2011, the British Film 
Institute released a restoration of the film, featuring an atmospheric score 
by Simon Fisher Turner. This pristine version highlights Ponting's 
incredible achievement in capturing the glory and the danger of those 
individuals who defined the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration."  IHS

Greed  Erich von Stroheim, 1924
The first movie ever shot entirely on location, Greed is notorious as much 
for the story behind its making as for its considerable artistic power. 
Director Erich von Stroheim wanted to make the most realistic movie 
possible with his adaptation of Frank Norris's novel McTeague, about the 
rise and violently murderous fall of working-class San Francisco dentist 
John "Mac" McTeague. But his creation, originally commissioned by the 
director-friendly Goldwyn Company, was destroyed when the studio 
became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), with Stroheim's nemesis, Irving 
Thalberg, as the new General Manager.
MGM wanted a commercial film, and Stroheim wanted an 
experiment in cinematic realism. During the two-year shoot, he rented 
an apartment on Laguna Street in San Francisco that became the set for 
Mac's (Gibson Gowland) dental parlors. Many of the scenes there were 
shot entirely with natural light. Stroheim also insisted that his actors live 
in the apartment to help them get into character. When it came time to 
shoot the film's final climactic moments in Death Valley, Stroheim 
shipped his whole crew out to the 120°F desert location, where the 
cameras became so overheated they had to be wrapped with iced towels.
The director's first cut was nearly nine hours long. It was a painstaking 
reenactment of Norris's novel, which itself was a recreation of an actual 
crime that took place during the early 1880s. After a quack doctor helps 
Mac escape the Northern California mining town of his childhood, he 
becomes a dentist in San Francisco. There he meets Trina (Zasu Pitts), 
who he falls in love with during a memorably creepy tooth-drilling 
scene. His best friend and rival for Trina's affections is Marcus (Jean 
Hersholt), who grants Mac permission to marry Trina but changes his 
mind after she wins a lottery. Using his connections in local government, 
Marcus manages to put Mac out of business and send his former friend 
into a freefall of back-breaking day labor, drunkenness, and wife beating. 
Trina turns to her lottery winnings as a source of satisfaction, hoarding 
her thousands in gold coins while she and Mac starve. One of Greed's 
most famous scenes has Trina climbing into bed with her money, 
caressing it, and rolling around with erotic abandon. Shortly thereafter 
Mac murders her, steals the money, and heads out to Death Valley where 
his life comes to a bitter end when Marcus hunts him down.
Only a small handful of people ever saw the original nine-hour 
version of Greed. After a friend helped Stroheim cut the picture down to 
eighteen reels, or about four hours, the studios took it away from him and 
handed it over to a low-ranking editor who reduced it to 140 minutes. 
This version of the film, which Stroheim called "a mutilation of my sincere 
work at the hands of the MGM executives," is nevertheless stark, 
captivating, and genuinely disturbing. In 1999, film restorer Rick 
Schmidlin released a four-hour version of Greed that was reconstructed 
from original production stills and Stroheim's shooting script.  AN

The Thief of Bagdad marked the culmination of Douglas Fairbanks's 
career as the ultimate hero of swashbuckling costume spectacles. It is 
also one of the most visually breathtaking movies ever made, a unique 
and integral conception by a genius of film design, William Cameron 
Menzies. Building his mythical Bagdad on a six-and-a-half-acre site 
(the biggest in Hollywood history), Menzies created a shimmering, 
magical world, as insubstantial yet as real and haunting as a dream, 
with its reflective floors, soaring minarets, flying carpets, ferocious 
dragons, and winged horses.
As Ahmed the Thief in quest of his Princess, Fairbanks—bare chested 
and with clinging silken garments—explored a new sensuous eroticism 
in his screen persona and found an appropriate costar in Anna May 
Wong, as the Mongol slave girl. Although the nominal director was the 
gifted and able Raoul Walsh, the overall concept for The Thief of Bagdad 
was Fairbanks's own, as producer, writer, star, stuntman, and showman 
of unbounded ambition. (Side note: the uncredited Persian Prince in the 
film is played by a woman, Mathilde Comont.)  DR

Rudolph Valentino will best be remembered as one of cinema's first 
heartthrobs. His swarthy looks seduced millions and his premature death, 
at the age of thirty-one, prompted scenes of pandemonium. He is 
perhaps less remembered for his comic skills, which are on display in The 
Eagle. In the place of brooding romance is an engaging romp, often 
parodying the star's persona, with Valentino game enough to play along. 
He plays Vladimir Dobrovsky, a Cossack serving in the Russian army, 
whose act of bravery in stopping a runaway carriage and saving its pretty 
occupant (Vilma Bánky) attracts the attention of the ageing Czarina 
(Louise Dresser). She attempts to seduce Dobrovsky, who runs away, 
escaping to his country home only to discover it has been overrun by a 
villainous braggart. The man's daughter is the very woman Dobrovsky 
had saved. Donning the disguise of the Black Eagle in order to terrorize 
the man who took his father's land, and a French tutor so that he can be 
close to the villain's daughter, Dobrovsky finds himself torn between his 
heart and his family's honor. 
Director Clarence Brown employs a number of visual flourishes, 
including an elegant tracking shot over a vast banquet of food, which 
elevates the quality of the film. Although the narrative is uneven—the 
family's honor is never really restored and the Czarina is perhaps a little 
too forgiving—The Eagle is nevertheless a light-hearted frolic whose 
balance of comedy and drama foreshadows later action films such as 
The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Mark of Zorro (1940).  IHS

This 1925 silent remains the closest adaption of Gaston Leroux's trash 
masterpiece of the same name, a novel that has a terrific setting and a 
great central figure but a plot that creaks at every turn. The film is a 
strange combination of plodding direction (mostly from Rupert Julian, 
though other hands intervened) and incredible Universal Pictures set 
design, so that stick-figure characters—weedy hero Norman Kerry is 
especially annoying—pose in front of incredibly impressive tableaux.
The Phantom of the Opera delivers a series of masterly moments 
that cover up its rickety structure: the masked ball (a brief Technicolor 
sequence), where the Phantom shows up dressed as Edgar Allan Poe's 
Red Death; the chandelier dropping, where the Phantom lets the 
audience know what he thinks of the current diva; various trips into the 
magical underworld beneath the Paris Opera House; and—best of all—
the unmasking, in which the tragic villain's disfigured skullface is first seen 
(so shocking that even the camera is terrified, going briefly out of focus). 
The reason this film is a classic is that it enshrines one of the 
greatest bits of melodramatic acting in the silent cinema—Lon 
Chaney's impeccably dressed, lovelorn, violent ghoul genius. Favorite

Bronenosets Potyomkin  
The Battleship Potemkin
Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1925
The Battleship Potemkin—such a famous film! Sergei Eisenstein's 
legendary second feature was to become not just a point of ideological 
conflict between the East and the West, the Left and the Right, but a 
must-see film for every cinema lover. Decades of censorship and 
militant support, countless words analyzing its structure, its symbolism, 
its sources and effects, and thousands of visual quotations have all 
served to make it very difficult for us to see the story behind the film. 
Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin may not be historically accurate, 
but his legendary vision of oppression and rebellion, individual and 
collective action, and its artistic ambition to work simultaneously with 
bodies, light, trivial objects, symbols, faces, movement, geometrical 
forms, and more is a unique keyboard. As a true artist of film, Eisenstein 
manages to elaborate a magnificent and touching myth.
It should be kept in mind, however, that this aesthetic sensibility 
was endowed with political significance as well: the "changing of the 
world by conscious men" that had been dreamed of in those times and 
was known by the term "Revolution." But even without an awareness of 
what it meant, or—better—without a precise awareness of what it 
eventually turned into, the wind of an epic adventure still blows on the 
screen here and makes it move. Whatever else one chooses to call it, 
this adventure is the unique impulse that drives the people of Odessa 
toward liberty, the sailors of the eponymous battleship to battle against 
hunger and humiliation, and the filmmaker himself to invent new 
cinematic forms and rhythms.
The Battleship Potemkin has been seen too often in excerpted form, 
or on the basis of its most famous scenes and sequences. It may come 
as somewhat of a surprise to find how powerful it is to see the film in 
its entirety—that is, as a dramatic and touching story—rather than 
treating it as a priceless jewelry box from which to remove individual 
pieces on occasion.
Such a renewed, innocent approach to the film will bring back a real 
sense of being to those icons that have become familiar to us all: the 
out of control baby carriage on the steps; the face of the dead sailor 
under the tent at the end of the pier; the worm-ridden meat in the 
sailors' rations; the leather boots; the iron guns pointed toward bodies 
and faces; the glasses of a blind political, military, and religious power 
waiting in the void. Then, before it all becomes ideological 
interpretation, the stone lion coming alive to roar with anger and a 
desire to live will become a metaphor for the film itself—and for the 
high and daring idea of cinema it was bearing—escaping from its 
monumental status to be found, alive and fresh once again, by every 
new pair of eyes that looks upon it.  J-MF

The Gold Rush affirmed Charles Chaplin's belief that tragedy and comedy 
are never far apart. His unlikely dual inspiration came from viewing some 
stereoscope slides of the privations of prospectors in the Klondyke Gold 
Rush of 1896-98, and reading a book about the Donner Party Disaster of 
1846, when a party of immigrants, snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, 
were reduced to eating their own moccasins and the corpses of their 
dead comrades. Out of these grim and unlikely themes, Chaplin created 
high comedy. The familiar Little Tramp becomes a gold prospector, 
joining the mass of brave optimists to face all the hazards of cold, 
starvation, solitude, and the occasional incursion of a grizzly bear.
The film was in every respect the most elaborate undertaking of 
Chaplin's career. For two weeks the unit shot on location at Truckee in 
the snow country of the Sierra Nevada. Here Chaplin faithfully recreated 
the historic image of the prospectors struggling up the Chilkoot Pass. 
Some 600 extras, many drawn from the vagrants and derelicts of 
Sacramento, were brought by train to clamber up the 2,300-foot pass 
dug through the mountain snow. For the main shooting, the unit 
returned to the Hollywood studio, where a remarkably convincing 
miniature mountain range was created out of timber, chicken wire, 
burlap, plaster, salt, and flour. In addition, the studio technicians devised 
exquisite models to produce the special effects that Chaplin required, 
like the miners' hut, which is blown by the tempest to teeter on the 
edge of a precipice, for one of cinema's most sustained sequences of 
comic suspense. Often it is impossible to detect the shifts in the film 
from model to full-size set.
The Gold Rush abounds with now-classic comedy scenes. The 
historic horrors of the starving 19th-century pioneers inspired the 
sequence in which the Little Tramp and his partner Big Jim (Mack 
Swain) are snowbound and ravenous. The Little Tramp cooks his boot, 
with all the airs of a gourmet. In the eyes of the delirious Big Jim, he is 
intermittently transformed into an oven-worthy chicken—a triumph 
both for the cameramen, who had to effect the elaborate trick work 
entirely in the camera, and for Chaplin, who magically assumes the 
characteristics of a bird.
The lone prospector's dream of hosting a New Year's dinner for the 
beautiful dance-hall girl (Georgia Hale, who replaced sixteen-year-old 
Lita Grey when Lita became pregnant and married Chaplin) provides 
the opportunity for another famous Chaplin set piece: the dance of the 
rolls. The gag had been seen in films before, but Chaplin gives unique 
personality to the dancing legs created out of forks and bread rolls.
Today, The Gold Rush appears as one of Chaplin's most perfectly 
accomplished films. Though his affections for his own work changed 
over time, to the end of his life he would frequently declare that this film 
was the one by which he would most wish to be remembered.  DR

Based on a story by Laurence Stallings, who wrote the Broadway smash 
What Price Glory?, King Vidor's epic film about the American experience 
of World War I traces the adventures of three soldiers from different 
backgrounds who find themselves in France. Rich boy Jim (John Gilbert), 
whose fiancée had encouraged him to enlist, meets a beautiful French 
woman (Renée Adorée) in the village where their unit has been assigned 
lodging. In one of The Big Parade's most tender scenes, she clutches the 
boot he has left with her as the soldiers make their way to the front. 
Once they arrive at the trenches, the battle of Belleau Wood commences. 
Attacking a machine gun nest, Jim's two buddies are killed and he is 
wounded. Seeking refuge in a shell hole, he discovers a dying German 
soldier already occupying it, and the two share a cigarette. Eventually, 
he is found and then taken to a field hospital. His attempts to reach the 
farmhouse fail as he falls unconscious.
Back in America, Jim is reunited with his family but is bitterly 
unhappy because he has lost a leg. His fiancée, in any case, has now 
fallen in love with his brother. Finally, Jim accepts his mother's advice 
and returns to France, where in the film's most moving scene he locates 
his lost love as she is helping her mother plow the fields. With its expert 
mixture of physical comedy (particularly in the French farmhouse 
scenes) and well-staged action, The Big Parade proved an immense 
success—a testimony to producer Irving Thalberg's oversight of the 
project—and counts as one of the triumphs of the late silent era.
Gilbert gives a fine performance as Jim, showing the box-office appeal 
that made him one of the era's biggest stars, and Adorée is appropriately 
appealing as his love interest. Because it shows the horrors of war, The Big 
Parade has often been thought of as a pacifist tract, but in truth its politics 
are muted. As Thalberg wanted, the film is much more of a comedy 
romance, with the war serving as the means through which Jim becomes 
a man and discovers the kind of life he really wants to live.  RBP

Lotte Reiniger's enchanting The Adventures of Prince Achmed is often cited 
as the first feature-length animation. The film weaves together tales from 
The Arabian Nights, following Prince Achmed as he sets out on a perilous 
journey on a magical flying horse. He eventually lands on the islands of 
Waq Waq, where he falls in love with the beautiful fairy Princess Peri Banu. 
Reiniger's characters move gracefully in and out of the shadows, 
magically disappearing and morphing shape through her skilled stop-
time animation. The detail of the cutouts is beautifully complemented 
by the Islamic patterns on the inter-title cards, designed by Edmund 
Dulac, and the shimmering backgrounds by Walter Ruttmann. Its dizzying 
action sequences and romantic sensibility give the film a colorful 
rhythmic style, influenced by Reiniger's circle of avant-garde artist friends.
Reiniger's use of silhouette is as magical as her world of sorcerers, 
genies, and fairies. Produced over an arduous three years, the film 
resulted in the invention of many new techniques, including a multi-
plane animation stand, which gives the illusion of depth to images. It is 
a method whose creation is often mistakenly attributed to Walt Disney. 
A popular film that imaginatively retells a classic fairytale, The 
Adventures of Prince Achmed is nevertheless firmly entrenched in the 
avant-garde. It is, in every way, a pioneering work whose timelessness 
lies in its skill and achievement.  LK

Originally clocking in at over two hours, Fritz Lang's Metropolis is the 
first science-fiction epic, with huge sets, thousands of extras, then-
state-of-the-art special effects, lots of sex and violence, a heavy-handed 
moral, big acting, a streak of Germanic gothicism, and groundbreaking 
fantasy sequences. Funded by UFA, Germany's giant film studio, it was 
controversial in its day and proved a box-office disaster that nearly 
ruined the studio.
The plot is simple, with Freder Fredersen (Gustav Fröhlich), pampered 
son of the Master of Metropolis (Alfred Abel), learning of the wretched 
lives of the multitude of workers who keep the super-city going. Freder 
comes to understand the way things work by the saintly Maria (Brigitte 
Helm), a pacifist who constantly preaches mediation in industrial 
disputes, as well as by secretly working a hellish ten-hour shift at one of 
the grinding machines. The Master consults with mad engineer Rotwang 
(Rudolf Klein-Rogge), who has created a feminoid robot he reshapes to 
be an evil double of Maria and unleashes on the city. The robotrix goes 
from dancing naked in a decadent nightspot to inciting a destructive 
riot, which allows Lang to get the most value out of the huge factory sets 
by blowing them up and/or flooding them, but Freder and the real Maria 
save the day by rescuing the city's children from a flood. Society is 
reunited when Maria decrees that the heart (Freder) must mediate 
between the brain (the Master) and the hands (the workers).
Shortly after its premiere, the film was pulled from distribution and 
reedited against Lang's wishes: this truncated, simplified form remained 
best known, even in the colorized Giorgio Moroder remix of the 1980s, 
until the twenty-first century, when a partial restoration—with tactful 
linking titles to fill in the scenes that remain irretrievably missing—made 
it much closer to Lang's original vision. This version not only adds many 
scenes that went unseen for decades, but also restores their original 
order and puts in the proper intertitles. Previously rated as a spectacular 
but simplistic science-fiction film, this new-old version reveals that the 
futuristic setting isn't intended as prophetic but mythical, with elements 
of 1920s architecture, industry, design, and politics mingled with the 
medieval and the Biblical to produce images of striking strangeness: a 
futuristic robot burned at the stake, a steel-handed mad scientist who is 
also a fifteenth-century alchemist, the trudging workers of a vast factory 
plodding into the jaws of a machine that is also the ancient god Moloch. 
Fröhlich's performance as the hero who represents the heart is still 
wildly overdone, but Klein-Rogge's engineer Rotwang, Abel's Master of 
Metropolis, and especially Helm in the dual role of saintly savior and 
metal femme fatale are astonishing. By restoring a great deal of story 
delving into the mixed motivations of the characters, the wild plot now 
makes more sense, and we can see it is as much a twisted family drama 
as an epic of repression, revolution, and reconciliation.  KN

Sunrise  F.W. Murnau, 1927
Trivia buffs might note that, although many history books often cite 
Wings (1927) as the first Best Picture recipient at the Academy Awards, 
the honor actually went to two films: William Wellman's Wings, for 
"production," and F.W. Murnau's Sunrise, for "unique and artistic 
production." If the latter category sounds more impressive than the 
former, that explains (in part at least) why Sunrise, and not Wings, remains 
one of the most revered films of all time. William Fox initially drew 
Murnau to America with the promise of a big budget and total creative 
freedom, and the fact that Murnau made the most of it with this stunning 
masterpiece ratified his peerless reputation as a cinematic genius.
Sunrise itself is deceptively simple. Subtitled somewhat enigmatically 
A Song of Two Humans, the film focuses on a country-dwelling married 
couple whose lives are disrupted by a temptress from the city. But 
Murnau draws waves of emotion from what could have been a rote 
melodrama, further enhanced by a bevy of groundbreaking filmmaking 
techniques. Most notable is the use of sound effects, pushing silent 
cinema one step closer to the talkie era—an achievement unfairly 
overshadowed by The Jazz Singer, released later in 1927. Murnau also 
creatively manipulates the use and effect of title cards (three years 
earlier, he had directed the title-free The Last Laugh).
The most striking aspect of Sunrise is its camera work. Working with 
a pair of cinematographers, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, Murnau 
borrowed from his own experience in the German Expressionist 
movement as well as from the pastoral portraits of the Dutch masters, 
particularly Jan Vermeer. Linked with graceful and inventive camera 
movements and accented with in-camera tricks (such as multiple 
exposures), each scene of Sunrise looks like a masterful still photograph.
The simplicity of its story lends Sunrise a formidable dramatic weight. 
George O'Brien, pondering the murder of his wife, Janet Gaynor, is 
racked with guilt, and his wife responds with appropriate terror once his 
intentions become obvious. The boat trip leading to her intended 
demise is fraught with both suspense and an odd sense of sadness, as 
the good O'Brien struggles to bring his monstrous thoughts to their 
fruition. Margaret Livingston, as the urban seductress, in many ways 
seems like the feminine equivalent of Murnau's vampire Count Orlok 
(from the 1922 film Nosferatu), relentlessly preying on poor O'Brien's 
soul. In one scene he is even beset by spectral images of her, surrounding 
him, clutching at him, and provoking him with her murderous desires.
Alas, the film was a box-office flop, and Murnau died in a car accident 
a few years later. But Sunrise remains a benchmark by which all other 
films should be measured, a pinnacle of craft whose sophistication belies 
the resources at the time. Its shadow looms over several great works, 
from Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) to Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the 
Beast (1946), yet at the same time its own brilliance is inimitable.  JKl

Keaton made several films that may be counted among the finest (and 
funniest) in cinema's entire comic output, but none is as strong a 
contender to the title of the greatest comedy ever made as this timeless 
masterpiece. It isn't merely the constant stream of great gags, nor 
the way they derive wholly from situation and character rather than 
existing in isolation from the film's drama. What makes The General so 
extraordinary is that it is superlative on every level: in terms of its humor, 
suspense, historical reconstruction, character study, visual beauty, and 
technical precision. One might even argue that it comes as close to 
flawless perfection as any feature ever made, comic or otherwise.
Much of the pleasure derives from the narrative itself, inspired by a 
book about the real-life exploits of a group of Northern soldiers who, 
during the Civil War, disguised themselves as Southerners to steal a 
train, which they drove north to rejoin their Unionist comrades until 
they were caught and executed. Keaton, understandably given that he 
was making a comedy, dropped the executions and changed the heroic 
perspective to that of a Southerner, Johnny Gray, a railway driver who 
stoically, if somewhat absurdly, goes in solo pursuit of Unionist spies 
when they steal both his engine—"The General"—and, inside it, 
Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), the other love of his life. The film's first 
half follows Johnny's rejection by the army with his chase after the train, 
which he recaptures behind enemy lines; the second half depicts his 
flight (with Annabelle) from the Union troops to his hometown, where—
after handing over the Girl, The General, and a real Northern army general 
inadvertently brought along for the ride—he is acclaimed as a hero.
This symmetrical story line is both formally pleasing and the source 
of suspense and gags; but the voyage also lends the film an epic tone 
that, combined with Keaton's meticulous historical detail, transforms it 
into perhaps the finest Civil War movie ever made. Then, finally, there is 
Buster's Johnny: unsmiling yet beautiful in his brave, faintly ridiculous 
determination—the epitome of this serio-comic masterpiece, and as 
deeply human a hero as the cinema has given us.  GA

"No other comedian 
could do as much with 
the deadpan."
James Agee, 
LIFE magazine, 1966

Best known for directing Bela Lugosi in the 1931 Universal horror classic 
Dracula, and most notorious for his 1932 oddity Freaks, circus performer-
turned-filmmaker Tod Browning's all-around greatest film is The 
Unknown. It is an under-appreciated silent-era gem starring the writer-
director's favorite actor and "Man of a Thousand Faces," Lon Chaney.
Greatly admired for the pain he would endure playing physically 
disabled antagonists, Chaney here outdoes himself as Alonzo, a criminal 
with an extra thumb on one hand who seeks to avoid capture by 
pretending to be an armless knife thrower in a circus. The armless gig at 
first has an additional benefit, as Alonzo's beautiful assistant, Nanon 
(Joan Crawford in one of her earliest leads), daughter of the circus owner, 
cannot stand being embraced by men—in particular Alonzo's main rival 
for her affections, strongman Malabar the Mighty (Norman Kerry).
After Nanon's father accidentally sees his arms, Alonzo murders him 
in order to keep the secret from getting out. Nanon, meanwhile, catches 
a glimpse of the killer's double thumb without seeing his face. Obsessed 
with Nanon, and distraught over the possibility that she will discover his 
true identity, Alonzo has his arms surgically amputated. But in one of 
The Unknown's most delicious and disturbing ironies, when Alonzo 
returns to the circus he finds that Nanon has gotten over her phobia of 
being held and has fallen head over heels for Malabar.
Seeking poetic justice (or just plain revenge) for this cruel twist of 
fate, the now truly armless Alonzo attempts to rig Malabar's latest circus 
act—in which the strongman ties his arms to a pair of horses, each one 
pulling in the opposite direction—so that his rival will end up armless 
as well. However, his scheme is foiled, and Alonzo himself gets killed 
saving Nanon from being trampled by one of the horses.
Drawing a remarkable and haunting performance from Chaney and 
filling the plot with twists and unforgettable characters, Browning here 
creates a chilling masterpiece of psychological (and psychosexual) 
drama. As Michael Koller writes, "The Unknown is a truly horrifying film 
that takes us into the darkest recesses of the human psyche."  SJS

Oktyabr  Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1927
October
In 1926, Sergei M. Eisenstein went to Germany to present his new film, 
The Battleship Potemkin. He left a promising young filmmaker, but he 
came back an international cultural superstar. A series of major film 
productions was being planned to commemorate the tenth anniversary 
of the Bolshevik victory. Eisenstein eagerly accepted the challenge of 
presenting on-screen the revolutionary process in Russia—literally, how 
the country went from the Czar's abdication and Aleksandr Kerensky's 
"Provisional Government" to the first victories of Lenin and his followers.
No expense was spared. Massive crowd scenes were organized, and 
city traffic was diverted so Eisenstein could shoot in the very sites where 
the depicted incident occurred. Contrary to popular belief, the film 
contains not one meter of documentary footage. Every shot was a 
re-creation. Working feverishly, Eisenstein finished just in time for the 
anniversary celebrations, but the reactions, official and otherwise, were 
less than enthusiastic. Many found the film confusing and difficult to 
follow. Others wondered why the role of Lenin was so greatly reduced. 
(The actor playing him, Vasili Nikandrov, appears only a handful of times 
on-screen.) Several critics who had supported Potemkin suggested that 
Eisenstein go back to the editing room and keep working.
There is no denying that October is a masterpiece, but figuring out 
what kind is a real challenge. As a means of "explaining" the revolution, 
the film is simply ineffective. For many audiences, sitting through it is a 
real chore. The characterizations are all paper thin, and anyone with a 
smattering of historical knowledge can see right through its propaganda. 
Yet what is perhaps most powerful and touching about October is simply 
its level of ambition. Eisenstein was surely the cinema's most remarkable 
personality for the first fifty years of its existence, impossibly erudite, 
with an unlimited belief in cinema's potential. He imagined that cinema 
could represent "visual thinking"—not just arguments, but the process 
by which the mind constructs arguments. Photographic images, the raw 
material of cinema, had to be "neutralized" into sensations and stimuli 
so that a film could reveal concepts and not just people or things. The 
real engine that would drive the cinema machine as Eisenstein saw it 
was montage, editing—the "mystical" interaction that occurs when two 
separate pieces of film are joined together.
October is the purest, most cogent example of Eisenstein's theory and 
practice of cinema. There are several absolutely breathtaking sequences: 
the toppling of the Czar's statue, the raising of the bridge, and especially 
the "For God and Country" sequence. Evidence of the cold engineer that 
Eisenstein originally trained to be might be found in the cathedral-like 
intricacy of its editing. However, scratch below the film's surface and you 
can feel the exhilaration—and the touch of madness—of an artist on 
the threshold of what he believes will be a brave new world.  RP

Throughout film history, certain movies have been the center of special 
attention, if not for their aesthetics, then for their role in the development 
of cinema as we know it. Alan Crosland's The Jazz Singer is undoubtedly 
one of the films that has marked the path of motion pictures as both an 
art form and a profitable industry. Released in 1927 by Warner Brothers 
and starring Al Jolson, one of the best-known vocal artists at the time, 
The Jazz Singer is unanimously considered the first feature-length 
sound movie. Although limited to musical performances and a few 
dialogues following and preceding such performances, the use of 
sound introduced innovative changes in the industry, destined to 
revolutionize Hollywood as hardly any other movie has done.
In its blend of vaudeville and melodrama, the plot is relatively simple. 
Jakie (Jolson) is the only teenage son of the devoted Cantor Rabinowitz 
(Warner Oland), who encourages his child to follow the same path of 
generations of Cantors in the family. Although profoundly influenced by 
his Jewish roots, Jakie's passion is jazz and he dreams about an audience 
inspired by his voice. After a family friend confesses to Cantor Rabinowitz 
to having seen Jakie singing in a café, the furious father punishes his son, 
causing him to run away from the family house and from his heartbroken 
mother, Sara (Eugenie Besserer). Years later Jakie, aka Jack Robin, comes 
back as an affirmed jazz singer looking for reconciliation. Finding his 
father still harsh and now sick, Jack is forced to make a decision between 
his career as a blackface entertainer and his Jewish identity.
A milestone in film history representing a decisive step toward a 
new type of cinema and a new type of entertainment, The Jazz Singer is 
more than just the first "talkie." As Michael Rogin, the famed political 
scientist, has argued, The Jazz Singer can be cited as a typical example of 
Jewish transformation in U.S. society: the racial assimilation into white 
America, the religious conversion to less strict spiritual dogma, and the 
entrepreneurial integration into the American motion picture industry 
during the time of the coming of sound.  CFe

At 333 minutes in its longest extant version, Abel Gance's 1927 biopic is 
an epic on a scale to satisfy its subject. Although it follows Bonaparte 
from his school days in 1780 through to his triumphant Italian campaign 
of 1796, by contemporary standards the film lacks depth. For Gance, 
Napoléon (played by the appropriately named Albert Dieudonné) was 
a "man of destiny," not pyschology. His paean to the French Emperor has 
something in common with Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky (1938), 
both thrilling pieces of cinema in the service of nationalist propaganda.
If Gance is more of an innovator than an artist, it's a measure of his 
brilliance that Napoléon still brims with energy and invention today. 
None of his contemporaries—not even Murnau—used the camera with 
such inspiration. Gance thought nothing of strapping cameramen to 
horses; he even mounted a camera on the guillotine. In one brilliant 
sequence, he captures the revolutionary spirit of a rousing (silent) rendition 
of "La Marseilles" by swinging the camera above the set as if it were on 
a trapeze. His most spectacular coup, though, is "Polyvision," a split-
screen effect that called for three projectors to create a triptych—nearly 
three decades before the advent of Cinerama.  TCh

Harold Lloyd is often regarded as the "third genius" of silent American 
comedy, his 1920s' work often more successful with the public than that 
of Buster Keaton, and even Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's screen persona is 
routinely noted for its "speedy," can-do optimism and his films singled 
out for the audacious, often dangerous stunts and acrobatic feats that 
they contain. The Kid Brother, Lloyd's second feature for Paramount, is 
often considered to be the bespectacled comic's best and most holistic 
film. In many ways it deliberately turns its back on the 1920s, returning 
somewhat to the rural "idyll" of the 1922 film Grandma's Boy. 
The film's two most startling sequences illustrate the combination of 
delicate and rugged athleticism that marks Lloyd's best work. In the first 
scene, Lloyd is shown climbing a tall tree to attain a slightly longer look 
at the woman he has just met (and fallen for). This sequence shows the 
meticulous and technically adventurous aspects of Lloyd's cinema—an 
elevator was built to accommodate the ascending camera—and the 
ways they are intricately connected to elements of character and 
situation (also demonstrating Lloyd's masterly use of props). The second 
sequence features a fight between Lloyd and his chief antagonist, and 
is remarkable for its sustained ferocity and precise staging. Both 
sequences show Lloyd's character transcending his seeming limitations, 
moving beyond appearances, and traveling that common trajectory 
from mama's boy to triumphant "average" American.  AD

"You've got to be good in that town if you want to beat the crowd." 
So says young John on his first sight of New York City, the thrilling 
metropolis where he's sure his special qualities will raise him high above 
the common herd.
Things work out differently for the hero of The Crowd, who shouldn't 
really be called a hero, because director King Vidor's intention was to 
portray a man so painfully ordinary that he could seem a randomly 
selected sample from the movie's eponymous urban multitude. He 
begins the story as a newborn baby indistinguishable from any other, 
and ends it as a New York bourgeois man indistinguishable from any 
other. In between, he undergoes experiences so humdrum that only a 
studio as adventurous as MGM under Irving G. Thalberg's regime would 
have considered it the stuff of Hollywood drama at all.
Nor would it have been if Vidor hadn't given it such stunningly 
imaginative treatment. From the stylized scene where John learns of his 
father's untimely death—filmed in a stairwell with forced perspective, 
borrowing from German film expressionism—to the closing shot of John 
and his wife, Mary, the generically named protagonists of this generically 
titled film, engulfed in an unthinking throng of moviegoers who mirror 
their herdlike selves, as unerringly as they mirror our own.
Vidor was riding high in Hollywood when he made The Crowd, fresh 
from the success of The Big Parade two years earlier. To play Mary he 
chose the attractive star Eleanor Boardman, who also happened to be 
his wife; but for John he took a chance on the little-tested James Murray, 
whose erratic career ended in suicide less than a decade later.
Although both are brilliant, Murray shines brightest under Vidor's 
expert guidance; for evidence, see the sequence when an unthinkable 
tragedy strikes the couple before their horrified eyes, uniting inspired 
acting with split-second editing and absolutely perfect camera work to 
produce one of the most unforgettable moments in all of silent cinema. 
It's a scene that stands leagues above the crowd in a movie that does 
the same from start to finish.  DS

The last full year of Hollywood's silent era, 1928, produced some of its 
greatest masterpieces. Like other movies from that year, Josef von 
Sternberg's The Docks of New York is a film of consummate economy and 
refinement. The plot is minimal and the characters few, leaving more 
room for the film's maximal elaboration of atmosphere and gesture.
Sternberg's waterfront romance contains two main sections: night 
and morning. Night is a luminous shadowland of mist, smoke, pools of 
light, and rippling reflections. In this enchanted realm, hulking stoker 
Bill (George Bancroft) fishes suicidal tramp Mae (Betty Compson) out of 
the drink. The couple end up at a saloon where they talk each other into 
a spur-of-the-moment marriage. The cold, clear light of morning brings 
desertion, disillusion, and a change of heart, as Bill impulsively jumps 
ship and returns to take the rap for a stolen dress he had given to Mae.
The restraint and care of the performances—Bancroft's guarded 
nonchalance, the deliberate grace with which he moves his massive 
body, and Compson's languid weariness and the delicate balance 
between hurt and hope in her upturned eyes—maintain a constantly 
rippling veil of speculation over the main characters' inner thoughts and 
feelings. Sternberg, by all accounts (including his own) was the iciest of 
directors, yet he created several of the cinema's most moving testaments 
to the power of love to make fools of us all. The Docks of New York is one 
of them, made all the more convincing by the self-deprecating reticence 
with which it reveals its foolish heart.  MR

Carl Dreyer's 1928 masterpiece—his last silent film, and the greatest of 
all Joan of Arc films—is the work of his that brought him worldwide 
fame, although, like the majority of his later pictures, it was strictly 
a succès d'estime and fared poorly at the box office. A print of the 
original version—lost for half a century—was rediscovered in a 
Norwegian mental asylum in the 1980s. Other prints had perished in a 
warehouse fire, and the two versions subsequently circulated consisted 
of outtakes.
All of Dreyer's films were based on works of fiction or plays, with the 
exception of The Passion of Joan of Arc, which was essentially based on 
the official transcripts of the proceedings of Joan's trial—albeit highly 
selective and radically compressed portions of that trial. It was made 
only eight years after Joan was canonized in France and ten years after 
the end of World War I, both of which were central to Dreyer's 
interpretation. The helmets worn by the occupying British in 1431 
resemble those in the recent war, and 1928 audiences saw the film as a 
historical "documentary" rather like the later films of Peter Watkins.
Joan is played by Renée Falconetti, a stage actress Dreyer 
discovered in a boulevard comedy, and following his instructions, she 
played the part without makeup. She and her interlocutors are filmed 
almost exclusively in close-ups. Though hers is one of the key 
performances in the history of movies, she never made another film. 
Antonin Artaud also appears in his most memorable screen role, as the 
sympathetic brother Jean Massieu.
Dreyer's radical approach to constructing space and the slow 
intensity of his mobile camera style make this a "difficult" film in the 
sense that, like all great films, it reinvents the world from the ground 
up. The Passion of Joan of Arc is also painful in a way that all Dreyer's 
tragedies are, but it will continue to live long after most commercial 
movies have vanished from memory.  JRos

The directorial debut of Luis Buñuel, collaborating with artist Salvador 
Dalí, is etched into our consciousness of film history because of one 
image above all: a razor slicing open an eyeball. What is this: shock 
tactic, symbol of a modernist "vision," male aggression toward woman? 
For Jean Vigo—who hailed An Andalusian Dog for its "social 
consciousness"—Buñuel's associative montage raised a philosophical 
query: "Is it more dreadful than the spectacle of a cloud veiling a full 
moon?" One thing is certain: The image kicks off a classic surrealist 
parable of Eros ever denied, ever frustrated by institutions and mores.
Too often—because of its heavy influence on rock video—An 
Andalusian Dog has been reduced to, and recycled as, a collection of 
disconnected, striking, incongruous images: dead horse on a piano, ants in 
a hand. But this overlooks what gives the work its cohering force: the fact 
that, in many ways, Buñuel scrupulously respects certain conventions of 
classical continuity and linkage, creating a certain disquieting narrative 
sense among these fragments from the unconscious. This is a dialectic of 
surface rationality versus deep, churning forces from the Id that Buñuel 
would continue exploring to the very end of his career.  AM

Steamboat Bill, Jr.  Charles Reisner & Buster Keaton, 1928
Even more than the formally experimental Sherlock, Jr. (1924), this film, 
along with Our Hospitality (1923) and The General (1927), reveals just 
how great a director Buster Keaton was, over and above his 
considerable talents as a comedian. In Steamboat Bill, Jr., by means of 
his customarily unintrusive but always expert placing of the camera, 
we get a real feeling for the small Mississippi riverside town where city 
slicker and college graduate Willie turns up to see his beleaguered 
steamboat-proprietor father. Dad, a rough-and-ready type, is dismayed 
by his son's somewhat foolish ways and is even less happy when the 
boy falls for the daughter of a wealthy rival determined to blow Bill, Sr., 
out of the water.
Needless to say, Willie finally gets to prove his mettle during a 
climactic typhoon that destroys the town in an extended sequence of 
virtuoso stunts, meticulously staged action sequences, and superbly 
paced suspense, but not before much fun has been had with notions of 
acceptable/unacceptable masculine behavior. One scene in particular, 
in which father and son shop for hats (played straight to camera as if it 
were a mirror), is not only hilarious but a prime example of Keaton's 
very "modern" and playful awareness of his comic persona. Magic.  GA
Potomok Chingis-Khana  Vsevolod Pudovkin, 1928
Storm Over Asia
Within a month of completing 1927: The End of St. Petersburg, Vsevolod 
Pudovkin was at work on this epic fable, apparently inspired both by I. 
Novokshonov's original story of a herdsman who will rise to become a 
great leader, and by the prospect of shooting in virgin territory, exotic 
Outer Mongolia. Pudovkin's State Film School classmate Valéry Inkijinoff 
plays the unnamed hero, a Mongol who learns to distrust capitalists 
when a Western fur trader cheats him out of a rare silver fox pelt. The 
year is 1918, and the Mongol falls in with Socialist partisans fighting 
against the imperialist British occupying army. Captured, he is 
condemned to be shot (for recognizing the word "Moscow"), but his life 
is saved when an ancient talisman is found on his person, a document 
that proclaims the bearer to be a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. 
The British install him as a puppet king, but he escapes to lead his 
people to a fantastic victory.
A curious mix of rip-roaring adventure filmmaking, Soviet socialist 
propaganda, and ethnographic documentary, Storm Over Asia is never 
less than entertaining. It is distinguished by Pudovkin's epic compositional 
sense, evident in the cavalry column fanning out to fill the horizon and 
some striking, cubist-like montage sequences—as well as for its sardonic 
satire of Buddhist ritual and Western betrayal of faith.  TCh

A German production in collaboration with the actor-producer Himansu 
Rai, filmed entirely on location in India and based on an episode from 
the Mahabharata, A Throw of Dice is a magnificent and alluring epic. 
Osten's most critically acclaimed film, it was his third collaboration with 
Rai, after The Light of Asia (1925), about the life of Buddha, and Shiraz 
(1928), which dramatizes events around the building of the Taj Mahal.
Two kings vie for the hand of young Sunita (Seeta Devi). She is 
enamored of Ranjit (Charu Roy), who is no less besotted with her. Sohan 
(Himansu Rai) sees her as a way to gain more power. Knowing Ranjit to 
be addicted to gambling, Sohan uses a set of loaded dice to win Sunita's 
hand and, eventually, his rival's kingdom. Only when Sunita discovers 
the dice is Ranjit able to muster the forces to overthrow Sohan.
One of A Throw of the Dice's most striking elements is the naturalism 
of the performances, particularly compared with the declamatory style 
of much Western acting at that time. Also noteworthy are Osten and 
cinematographer Emil Schünemann's stunning visuals, which capture 
the beauty of India's landscape and its grand palaces along the Ganges.
The film was restored in time for the sixtieth anniversary of India's 
independence. Featuring an atmospheric score by Nitin Sawhney, 
accentuating the unbridled romanticism of Osten's drama, it now ranks 
as one of the pinnacles of early cinema.  IHS

Chelovek s kinoapparatom  Dziga Vertov, 1929
The Man with a Movie Camera 
Dziga Vertov (Denis Kaufman) began his career with newsreels, filming 
the Red Army as it fought during the Russian Civil War (1918-21) and 
screening the footage for audiences in villages and towns who boarded 
the "agit-trains." The experience helped Vertov formulate his ideas about 
cinema, ideas shared by a group of like-minded young filmmakers who 
called themselves Kino-glaz (Cine-Eye). The group's principles—the 
"honesty" of documentary as compared with fiction film, the "perfection" 
of the cinematic eye compared with the human eye—inform Vertov's 
most extraordinary picture, the dazzling The Man with a Movie Camera.
In this film Vertov combines radical politics with revolutionary 
aesthetics to exhilarating, even giddy effect. The two components of 
filmmaking—camera and editing—function as equal (and gendered) 
partners. Vertov's male cameraman (his brother Mikhail Kaufman) 
records a day in the life of the modern city—what Vertov called "life 
caught unawares"—while his female editor (wife Elizaveta Svilova) cuts 
and splices the footage, thus reformulating that life. By the end, Vertov 
has exploited every available device of filming and editing—slow 
motion, animation, multiple images, split-screen, zooms and reverse 
zooms, blurring focus, and freeze-frames—to create a textbook of film 
technique as well as a hymn to the new Soviet state. 
The camera begins to roll as the city gradually awakens, its buses and 
trams emerging from their night-hangars and its empty streets gradually 
filling, and continues by tracking denizens of the city (mostly Moscow 
but with extensive footage shot in Kiev, Yalta, and Odessa) through their 
routines of work and play. A lifetime is compressed into that day, as the 
camera peers between a woman's legs to watch a baby emerge, espies 
children entranced by a street conjuror, and tracks an ambulance 
carrying an accident victim. New rituals supplant old as couples marry, 
separate, and divorce in a registry office instead of a church.
Vertov gives visual form to Marxist principles in a stunning montage 
that follows the transformation of handwork into mechanized labor and 
that lauds the speed, efficiency, and the joy of assembly-line labor. 
Workers use their new-found leisure to socialize in state-subsidized 
clubs and beer halls, to play music and chess, to swim and sunbathe, 
pole-vault and kick soccer balls. Moscow's "ordinary people" become 
stars of their own lives as they see themselves on-screen. By the time 
Vertov bids an explosive farewell to the old by splitting the Bolshoi 
Theater in half, he has made his case for the revolutionary potential 
of cinema.
Ultimately, Vertov could not accommodate to Socialist Realism, and 
his career faltered. With The Man with a Movie Camera, however, he 
achieved his goal: a non-linear narrative form for cinema, a glorious 
tribute to everything that moviemaking can be.  JW

Die Büchse der Pandora  Georg Wilhelm Pabst, 1929
Pandora's Box 
A lasting masterpiece from G.W. Pabst, adapted from Frank Wedekind's 
"Lulu" plays, Pandora's Box is remembered for the creation of an 
archetypal character in Lulu (Louise Brooks), an innocent temptress 
whose forthright sexuality winds up ruining the lives of everyone 
around her. Though Pabst was criticized for casting a foreigner in a role 
that was considered emblematically German, the main reason the film 
is remembered is the performance of American star Brooks. So powerful 
and sexual a presence that she never managed to make a transition 
from silent flapper parts to the talkie roles she deserved in a Hollywood 
dominated by Shirley Temple, Brooks is the definitive gamine vamp.
Presented in distinct theatrical "acts," the story picks up Lulu in a 
bourgeois Berlin drawing room, where she is the adored mistress of 
widowed newspaper publisher Peter Schön (Fritz Kortner), friendly with 
her lover's grown-up son Alwa (Franz Lederer) and even with the 
gnomish pimp Schigolch (Carl Goetz), who is either her father or her first 
lover. When Schön announces that he is remarrying, Lulu seems to be 
passed on to a nightclub strongman (Krafft-Raschig) but, provoked 
when Schön tells his son that "one does not marry" a woman like her, 
sets up an incident backstage at the music hall where she is dancing 
that breaks off the editor's engagement and prompts her lover to marry 
her, though he knows that it will be the death of him.
Though her husband in effect commits suicide, Lulu is convicted of 
his murder. On the run with Alwa, Schigolch, and her lesbian admirer 
Countess Geschwitz (Alice Roberts), she makes it to an opium-hazed 
gambling boat on the Seine—where she is almost sold to an Egyptian 
brothel and Alwa is humiliatingly caught cheating—then finally to a 
Christmassy London, where she is stalked by Jack the Ripper (Gustav 
Diessl). Pabst surrounds Brooks with startling secondary characters and 
dizzying settings, but it is the actress's vibrant, erotic, scary, and 
heartbreaking personality that resonates with modern audiences. Her 
mix of image and attitude is so strong and fresh that she makes 
Madonna look like Phyllis Diller, and her acting style is strikingly 
unmannered for the silent era. Her performance is also remarkably 
honest: never playing for easy sentiment, the audience is forced to 
recognize how destructive Lulu is even as we fall under her spell.
The original plays are set in 1888, the year of the Ripper murders, yet 
Pabst imagines a fantastical but contemporary setting, which seems to 
begin with the 1920s modernity of Berlin and then travels back in time 
to a foggy London for a death scene that is the cinema's first great 
insight into the mind-set of a serial killer. Lulu, turned streetwalker so 
that Schigolch can afford a last Christmas pudding, charms the reticent 
Jack, who throws aside his knife and genuinely tries not to kill again but 
is ultimately overwhelmed by the urge to stab.  KN

1929
Though Alfred Hitchcock laid down many of the themes he would later 
return to and staked his claim as master of the suspense genre with the 
silent The Lodger (1927), this 1929 picture sealed his reputation and set 
him on the road to a remarkable career. Blackmail began as a silent 
movie but was rethought in midshoot as Britain's first all-talkie; that this 
decision was made shows how ambitious Hitchcock was, but also that 
his talents were obvious enough for paymaster producers to fund 
technical innovations. One of Hitchcock's greatest tricks was to be both 
avant-garde and commercial at the same time: here he uses newfangled 
technology in the service of a melodrama that may be psychologically 
acute but still succeeds in delivering thrills (and titillation).
Alice White (Anny Ondra) quarrels with her policeman boyfriend 
Frank (John Longden) and impulsively accompanies a lecherous artist 
(Cyril Ritchard) to his apartment. When the heel tries to rape her, she 
stabs him in self-defense and gets away, though a breakfast-table 
conversation with her family becomes a reminder of the trauma as the 
word "knife" keeps stabbing at her and the sight of a bread knife nearly 
sends her into hysterics. Whereas other directors converting to talkies 
were working hard to ensure that every line of dialogue was perfectly 
crisp, Hitchcock monkeys around with the soundtrack in this scene so 
that most of the conversation becomes an inaudible babble—the 
better to highlight the crystal-clear key word. This may be the moment 
when the talkies stopped just talking and singing and the real potential 
of sound as an addition to the director's arsenal became apparent.
Stuck with an already-cast Czech actress whose English wasn't up to 
standard, Hitchcock also experimented with dubbing, having Joan 
Barry off-camera reading the lines as Ondra mouthed them, an unusual 
(and rarely repeated) approach that allows for a successful synthesis of 
performance. Ondra is a remarkably fresh, engaging presence and turns 
the trick of making her innocent killer sympathetic while the slimy 
creep who blackmails her is painted as the real villain.  KN

1930
Genre can be used to read history and interpret moments in time. 
Accordingly, Mervyn LeRoy's Little Caesar helped to define the gangster 
movie while serving as an allegory of production circumstances because 
it was produced during the Great Depression. Within the film is inscribed 
a wholesale paranoia about individual achievement in the face of 
economic devastation. Leavening this theme alongside the demands of 
social conformity during the early 1930s means that LeRoy's screen 
classic is far more than the simple sum of its parts.
Caesar "Rico" Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) is a small-stakes thief 
with a partner named Joe (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). Recognizing a dead-
end future, they move to the heart of Chicago, where Joe becomes an 
entertainer and falls in love with a dancer named Olga (Glenda Farrell). 
In contrast, Rico gets a taste of the "life" and enjoys it. Possessing a 
psychotic ruthlessness, he gradually looms as the new power on-scene 
before finally succumbing to an ill-tempered ego and the police. Gut 
shot and dying beneath an ad for Joe and Olga's dinner act, Rico sputters 
some final words of self-determination, underlining how he won't ever 
be caught because he lived according to the terms of his own ambition.
For audiences, Rico's killer was undoubtedly a clear call of recent 
tensions about the state of the world at the time. Limited by the feature 
film's structure, but not dulled by censorial practice in the days before 
the Production Code Administration, Little Caesar offers a scornful look 
at free enterprise taken to an extreme. Seen through the long view of 
history and the focus on ill-gotten gains, it's a perfect corollary for Wall 
Street's collapse, itself the result of poor regulation, mass speculation, 
and hysteria manipulated to benefit the few at the expense of the many.
Acting out to get a bigger piece of the pie, Rico expresses the wish for 
acceptance and the drive toward success in an otherwise indifferent 
world. Simultaneously terrorizing innocents and devastating the society 
he desires to control, he ends up illuminating the demands of power with 
homicidal shadows in this, a seminal film of the early sound era.  GC-Q

Der Blaue Engel  Josef von Sternberg, 1930
The Blue Angel
How appropriate that the film that launched Marlene Dietrich's stardom 
(although it was far from her first role) should begin with a woman 
cleaning a window behind which is Dietrich's poster as Lola Lola—and 
then measuring herself up against this idealized image. In this equation, 
it is the unglamorous reality of the street (or later, the stage) that is more 
on the mind of director Josef von Sternberg than that illusory ideal—
setting the pattern for the pitiless logic of The Blue Angel.
The films Sternberg would go on to make with Dietrich in Hollywood are 
lush, baroque, often camp affairs. The Blue Angel—filmed simultaneously 
in somewhat different English- and German-language versions—shows 
the director still in his Expressionist phase, tailoring a dark, heavy style 
to emphasize Emil Jannings's powerful histrionics. Jannings plays 
Professor Immanuel Rath, a respected schoolteacher who falls under the 
spell of Lola after he goes into the den of iniquity known as "The Blue 
Angel" to investigate the unhealthy obsession of his male students.
Taken from Heinrich Mann's novel, it is a tale of decline, of downward 
mobility. In the course of the story, Rath will be reduced to a barely 
human clown—echoing the previous clown who functions as one of 
several ironic doubles for the doomed hero. Sternberg stresses, with 
exemplary and systematic rigor, the verticality of the film's spatial 
relations: Rath is always in a low position looking up at the image of Lola 
(as when she throws her underpants down on his head), unless—in a 
parody of his authoritative position—he is put on display in the highest, 
cheapest seats by the theater's sinister manager.
Lola is a classic femme fatale in so far as she lures men and then 
moves on when she tires of them—and, along the way, enjoys treating 
them like slaves. Yet there is also, for a time, a tender, loyal side in her 
relationship with Rath; when she reprises the famous "Falling in Love 
Again" we can almost accept her passive acceptance of her vagabond 
romantic destiny ("I know I'm not to blame").  AM

Undiminished by time (and restored in 1998), this classic antiwar film, 
adapted from Erich Maria Remarque's novel, is a landmark for its vivid 
depiction of the tragedy of World War I from a German soldier's point of 
view, for its technically inventive, spectacular battle scenes (at the dawn 
of sound in film), and for its prescient denunciation of fanatic 
nationalism and militarism. Lew Ayres, only twenty-one years old, 
became an international star for his beautifully natural performance as 
the schoolboy eager to serve but disillusioned by the futility and horror 
of war. The final shot—a close-up of his hand reaching out to a 
butterfly, quivering as a gunshot cracks and falling still in death—is an 
amazingly poignant image.
All Quiet on the Western Front was only the third film to win the 
Academy Award for Best Picture, and war veteran Lewis Milestone 
received his second Oscar for direction. Interestingly, German censors 
passed the film despite violent protests by Nazi groups. In a cruel irony, 
Ayers's career was all but ruined by public condemnation of his stand 
as a conscientious objector in World War II, despite his heroic service as 
a medic rather than a combatant. A 1979 TV remake was strong, if far 
less remarkable than the original.  AE

L'âge d'or  Luis Buñuel, 1930
The Age of Gold
In 1928, two young Spaniards in Paris—twenty-eight-year-old Luis 
Buñuel and twenty-four-year-old Salvador Dalí—conceived an 
authentically Surrealist short film, Un Chien Andalou. Shot in two weeks, 
the film shocked, startled, and delighted the intelligentsia; and it 
encouraged the Vicomte de Noailles to give them the money to finance 
a feature film. Dalí, however, quickly left the project (though his name 
remains on the credit titles), and the resulting film, The Age of Gold, must 
be assumed to be Buñuel's alone. 
The Age of Gold is driven by the Surrealist notion of l'amour fou, and—
somewhat denying Surrealist principles—has its own episodic story 
progression. It opens with a documentary on scorpions—actually a 1912 
film to which Buñuel has added a scientific commentary. A group of 
starving bandits struggle out of their hut while four bishops perform 
strange rituals on a beach. A fade returns to the bishops now reduced 
to skeletons. Boats bring a crowd of distinguished individuals to honor 
the bishops' memory, but their ceremony is interrupted by sexual cries 
from a man and a woman. The man is arrested and dragged through the 
streets. Subsequent sequences are set in the home of the woman and 
at an elegant party in the grounds of a villa, where their amours are 
resumed but variously interrupted. Scenes of Surrealist frenzy lead into 
the final sequence as the Marquis de Sade's libertines depart from their 
orgies at the Château de Sellini. Their leader is clearly portrayed as Jesus.
Not surprisingly, the film aroused ferocious emotions between the 
Surrealists and right-wing organizations; the League of Patriots and the 
Anti-Jewish League organized demonstrations that resulted in serious 
damage to the theater, police prohibition of further shows, and violent 
political and critical polemics. Notably, Henry Miller wrote extensively 
on the film and its creator: "Either you are made like the rest of civilized 
humanity, or you are proud and whole like Buñuel. And if you are whole 
and proud, then you are an anarchist, and throw bombs."
Following Surrealist tenets of "not making art," Buñuel demanded 
from his gifted cameraman Albert Duverger plain, simply lit visuals. He 
also rejected de Noailles's request that Stravinsky should compose the 
music, instead creating mischievous juxtapositions of his scabrous 
images, romantic symphonies (Wagner, Schubert, Debussy), and the 
harsh ceremonial drums of his native Calanda, Spain.
The Age of Gold has bequeathed some of the cinema's most 
unforgettable images: the mummified bishops; the painter Max Ernst as 
a frail, dying bandit; the cow on the bed of an elegant haute bourgeois 
villa; Lya Lys sucking the toe of a statue; the manic face of Gaston Modot; 
and the angelic Jesus and his gleefully exhausted fellow libertines on 
the castle drawbridge. It is a film that exists out of time, retaining its 
power to stir and shock into the twenty-first century and beyond.  DR

and the sense of death

Aleksandr Dovzhenko's Earth is arguably the single greatest achievement 
of the ever-more-impressive Soviet silent cinema. A modernist who 
drew deep inspiration from folk art—not unlike his contemporaries Marc 
Chagall and Sholem Aleichem—Dovzhenko's ode to the beginning of 
collectivization in the Ukraine is a riot of delirious imagery of swaying 
wheat fields, ripening fruits, and stampeding horses. The arrival of a tractor 
is greeted with joy by the peasants, who begin to imagine new lives for 
themselves, but surviving kulaks (landowners) conspire to assassinate the 
inspiring young head of the Party's village committee. His death, though, 
only makes the villagers stronger in their resolve; in a mind-boggling finale 
Dovzhenko brings together themes of birth, death, harvest, progress, 
and solidarity as the dead man is reunited with the land he loved so well.
No summary, however, can really do justice to the extraordinary 
sensuality of the film, a quality not much appreciated by the Soviet 
censors. Among the choice bits removed from earlier released versions

À nous la liberté  René Clair, 1931
Freedom for Us
83
Two conmen, Louis (Raymond Cordy) and Emile (Henri Marchand), plan 
their escape from prison. Upon breaking out, Emile is recaptured but 
Louis runs free and builds an empire on the assembly-line principle. 
Eventually Emile is paroled and heads to Louis's factory. Within its walls 
he becomes smitten with a secretary named Jeanne (Rolla France) and 
asks his old friend for help. According to the rules of comeuppance, 
Louis is then threatened with discovery as an escaped felon, after which 
the two men earn lasting freedom as hobos on the road.
Unlike Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times, a film later sued for plagiarism 
by Tobis, the production company of À Nous la Liberté, Rene Clair's film 
is an exaltation of industrial society. Opening on an assembly line and 
closing in a mechanized factory, the fears often associated with 
modernization are wholly absent here. Instead, these are substituted 
with values of loyalty and the comedy of circumstance.
Interestingly, much of the humor in À Nous la Liberté stems from 
carefully manipulated screen space and sequence. First the assembly 
line hiccups. Then a worker forgets his place, disrupts another worker, 
angers his boss, and so on. It's a formula freed from dialogue and 
adopted directly from the silent cinema as a transitional vehicle into 
the talkies.  GC-Q

David Bowie chose it as one of his favorite films. Orson Welles watched 
it in the 1940s. And it was screened for Marie Falconetti, Carl Theodor 
Dreyer's Joan of Arc. Limite is a cult film, but how and why?
The conventional wisdom is that Brazilian cinema started in the 1950s. 
But two decades earlier, in 1930, aged just twenty-one, Mario Peixoto 
made this extraordinary film. A man and a woman are handcuffed 
together—shades of Alfred Hitchcock. But where Hitch would race such 
a couple through a thriller story, Peixoto, woozy with the influence of the 
French Avant-Garde, makes something more dreamlike. 
The whole film seems to drift, languorously. Special camera mounts 
were made so that ropes could haul the image into the air to make it 
soar. Peixoto talked about the "camera-brain," and it's hard not to connect 
some of his visual ideas to the literary ideas of Virginia Woolf or the 
movies of French impressionist Germaine Dulac. Past mixes with present. 
The people, whose clothes are ragged and who seem immensely sad, 
remember recent events. Story is downplayed, but feeling, perception, 
looking, and subjectivity animate this film. Limite was restored by Martin 
Scorsese's World Cinema Foundation and, when the restoration was 
shown in Cannes, its slow rhythms seemed like an elegy, or Derek 
Jarman's The Angelic Conversation (1987).  MC

Tabu is the last film of F.W. Murnau, who was probably the greatest of all 
silent directors. He didn't live long enough to make sound films, dying 
in an auto accident a few days after work on the musical score for this 
masterpiece was completed and a week before the film's New York 
premiere. Filmed entirely in the South Seas in 1929 with a nonprofessional 
cast and gorgeous cinematography by Floyd Crosby, Tabu began as a 
collaboration with the great documentarist Robert Flaherty, who still 
rightly shares credit for the story. Clearly, though, the German romanticism 
of Murnau predominates, above all in the heroic poses of the islanders 
and the fateful diagonals in the compositions. As we now know, Flaherty 
was ultimately squeezed out of the project because Murnau, who had 
all the financial control, was not temperamentally suited to sharing 
directorial credit. This unfortunately has not prevented many 
commentators from continuing to miscredit Flaherty as a codirector.
Part of Murnau's greatness was his capacity to encompass studio 
artifice—in such large productions as The Last Laugh (1924), Faust (1926), 
and Sunrise (1927)—as well as documentary naturalism in Burning Soil 
(1922), Nosferatu (1922), and Tabu. This versatility bridges both his 
German and American work. Tabu, shot in natural locations and strictly 
speaking neither German nor American, exhibits facets of both of these 
talents. The simple plot—the two "chapters" of the film are titled 
"Paradise" and "Paradise Lost"—is an erotic love story involving a young 
woman who becomes sexually taboo when she is selected by an elder, 
one of Murnau's most chilling harbingers of doom, to replace a sacred 
maiden who has just died. An additional theme is the corrupting power 
of "civilization"—money in particular—on the innocent hedonism of the 
islanders. Murnau himself was in flight from the Hollywood studios when 
he made the picture, although Paramount wound up releasing it in 1931. 
However dated some of Tabu's ethnographic idealism may seem 
today, the film's breathtaking beauty and artistry make it indispensable 
viewing, and the exquisite tragic ending—conceived musically and 
rhythmically as a gradually decelerating diminuendo—is one of the 
pinnacles of silent cinema.  JRos

City Lights  Charles Chaplin, 1931
Convinced that speech would mar the beauty of cinema, its greatest 
mime exponent, Charlie Chaplin, agonized over the introduction of 
sound technology and determined to ignore it, against all advice. 
Presented as "a comedy romance in pantomime," his defiantly silent 1931 
film City Lights was in every way a triumph, its heartrending melodrama 
and hilarity withstanding audiences' craving for talkies. Nevertheless, 
after shooting the film, Chaplin incorporated sound effects and 
composed and conducted his own score, as he would continue to do in 
his later pictures.
The Little Tramp is touched by a blind flower seller (graceful Virginia 
Cherrill) and saves an eccentric millionaire from suicide. His gentle 
wooing of the girl and his determination to restore her sight propel him 
into a variety of jobs that go awry—like the memorable "fixed" boxing 
bout—while his on-off relationship with the drunken, unpredictable 
tycoon provides a parallel string of zany situations. As ever in Chaplin's 
silent films, there is a deftly choreographed comedic eating scene—here 
a party streamer entwined in the oblivious Charlie's spaghetti—and a 
slapstick misadventure with the law. Beautifully acted, this quite perfect 
balancing act between laughter and eloquent pathos culminates in a 
deeply moving finish. One of the real, landmark greats.  AE

Dracula  Tod Browning, 1931
Although Bram Stoker's seminal 1897 vampire novel had been filmed by 
F.W. Murnau in 1922 as Nosferatu and director Tod Browning had cast 
Lon Chaney as a bogus vampire in the silent London After Midnight, this 
early talkie was the true beginning of the horror film as a distinct genre 
and the vampire movie as its most popular subgenre.
Cinematographer Karl Freund had a solid grounding in German 
Expressionist shadowmaking, whereas Browning was the carnival barker 
king of American grotesquerie, so the film represents a synthesis of the 
two major strains of silent chills. Like such major American horror 
properties as The Cat and the Canary and The Bat, this Dracula comes to 
the screen not from the pages of classic gothic literature but directly 
from the stage: the primary sources of the screenplay are a pair of 
theatrical takes on Stoker's novel, from Hamilton Deane and John L. 
Balderston. The break-out star of the new genre was Bela Lugosi, who 
had played Dracula on Broadway and was finally cast in the film after the 
early death of Browning's favored star, Chaney. It may be that the loss of 
Chaney took some of the spark out of Browning's direction, which is 
actually less inspired than George Melford's work on the simultaneously 
shot (on the same sets, no less) Spanish version—though the latter 
suffers from the lack of an iconic Dracula and the fact that it represents 
exactly the shooting script, whereas the English-language Dracula was 
considerably tightened by an edit that took out twenty minutes of flab.
Prehistoric in technique and stuck with a drawing-room-centered 
script, Browning's film nevertheless retains much of its creaky, sinister 
power, spotlighting (literally, via tiny pinlights aimed at his evil eyes) 
Lugosi's star-making turn as the vampire, squeezing Hungarian menace 
out of every syllable of phrases such as "Cheeldren of the naight, leesten 
to thaim" or "I nevair dreenk vine!" The film opens magnificently, with a 
snatch of Swan Lake and a rickety stagecoach taking us and estate agent 
Renfield (Dwight Frye) to Lugosi's cobwebbed and vermin-haunted 
castle. Dracula strides through a curtain of cobwebs, the vampire 
twitching with bloodlust as his guest cuts his finger while carving bread, 
and three soulless vampire brides descend upon the unwary visitor.
Once the story hops disappointingly over a dangerous sea voyage 
and the Count relocates to London, Lugosi calms down. But Edward Van 
Sloan is staunch as the vampire-killing Professor Abraham Van Helsing, 
the forgotten Helen Chandler is frailly charming as the bled-dry and 
semivampirized heroine Mina, and Frye steals every scene that isn't 
nailed down when Renfield transforms into a fly-eating, giggling maniac. 
Castle Dracula, with its five-story Gothic windows, is the art direction 
highlight, but the London scenes offer an impressive staircase and 
catacombs for Dracula's English lair. Browning falters at the last, however, 
with a weak climax in which the Count is defeated far too easily, his 
death conveyed by an offscreen groan as he is impaled.  KN

Frankenstein is the single most important horror film ever made. James 
Whale hacked out of Mary Shelley's unwieldy novel a fable of an 
overreaching scientist and his abused, childlike outcast of a monster. 
Though Colin Clive's neurotic Frankenstein and Dwight Frye's 
hunchbacked dwarf assistant are definitive, the career breakout of the 
film is William Henry Pratt, a forty-two-year-old Englishman who turned 
his back on a privileged upbringing and emigrated to become a truck 
driver in Canada and a small-time actor in the United States. 
Universal's makeup genius Jack Pierce devised the flattop, the neck 
terminals, the heavy eyelids, and the elongated, scarred hands, while 
Whale outfitted the creature with a shabby suit like those worn by the 
ex-soldier hoboes then riding the rails and added the clumping asphalt-
spreader's boots. But it was Pratt who turned the Monster from a snarling 
bogeyman into a yearning, sympathetic, classic character whose 
misdeeds are accidental (drowning a little girl) or justified (hanging the 
dwarf who has tortured him with fire). In the opening credits, the 
Monster is billed as being played by "?"; only at the end of the film were 
audiences told it was a fellow by the name of Boris Karloff—Pratt's stage 
handle—who had terrified, moved, and inspired them.
Frankenstein claims a number of wondrous theatrical set pieces: the 
"creation," with lightning crackling around the tower and the Monster 
raised to the angry heavens on an operating table; the Monster's first 
appearance (seen from behind, he turns to show us his face and the 
camera stutters toward him); the heartbreaking sequence with the little 
girl who doesn't float; the primal attack on the heroine in her boudoir on 
her wedding day (a rare bit taken from the book); and the pursuit of the 
Monster by a mob of peasants with flaming torches, winding up in the old 
mill where creator and creation confront each other in one of the earliest 
horror movie inferno finales. The Universal horror cycle runs the gamut 
from perfection through pastiche and pulp to parody, but Frankenstein 
remains chilly and invigorating, the cornerstone of its entire genre.  KN

William Wellman's melodramatic chronicle of the rise and fall of gangster 
Tom Powers (James Cagney) is the greatest of the early 1930s gangster 
films. The genre's sometime sympathetic portrayal of ruthless criminals 
eager for the American dream of success at the deliberate and unlawful 
cost of others prompted the institution of the Production Code 
Administration to supervise the dubious moral value in Hollywood films. 
Raised in Chicago slums, Powers turns to crime at an early age, 
graduating as a young man to armed robbery and the murder of a 
policeman. Later, he becomes involved in bootlegging, making real 
money for the first time. Though his brother and mother plead with him 
to go straight, Tom rises in the gang, but after being wounded in a battle 
with rivals, he agrees to rejoin his family. He is taken from the hospital 
and murdered, his body dumped on the doorstep of his family home.
With its simplistic moralism, the plot of The Public Enemy has dated 
poorly. But Cagney remains powerful and energetic as Powers, 
dominating the screen in every scene and setting the pattern for all 
gangster films to come, including The Godfather series. Wellman directs 
the film with a strong visual sense, designing memorable scenes such 
as one in which Powers, in a sudden fit of anger, shoves a grapefruit into 
girlfriend Kitty's face.  RBP

M  Fritz Lang, 1931
In the early 1930s, MGM's production genius Irving Thalberg assembled 
all his writers and directors for a screening of Fritz Lang's thriller M, then 
criticized them en masse for not making films as innovative, exciting, 
profound, and commercial as this. Of course, Thalberg admitted, if 
anyone had pitched a story about a serial killer of children who is 
ultimately a tragic victim and accuses all strata of society of a corruption 
deeper than his psychosis, they would have been kicked off the lot.
Whereas Hollywood first saw sound pictures as best suited to all-
singing musicals and all-talking theatrical adaptations, a generation of 
European filmmakers understood their potential for thrills and 
psychological effects. Inspired perhaps by the theme of Alfred Hitchcock's 
1927 silent The Lodger and the techniques of his 1929 talkie Blackmail, 
Lang—who had ended his silent film career with Metropolis (1927) and 
Woman in the Moon (1929), both at the time considered costly flops—set 
out to reestablish himself as a popular artist. Nevertheless, M is an 
unusual piece of storytelling, presenting a series of montage-like scenes 
(often with voice-over narration, a new device) that add up to a portrait 
of a German city in terror. The cause of the uproar is Franz Becker (Peter 
Lorre), a pudgy young man who compulsively whistles an air from Edvard 
Grieg's "Hall of the Mountain King" as he approaches the children he 
murders (and, it is implied, molests). His crimes are conveyed by striking, 
pathetic images like a lost balloon floating against telephone wires or 
an abandoned ball. Establishing conventions still being used by serial-
killer movies, Lang and scenarist Thea von Harbou intercut the pathetic 
life of the murderer with the frenzy of the police investigation into the 
outrageous crimes, and pay attention to such side issues as press 
coverage of the killings, vigilante action, and the political pressure that 
comes down from the politicians and hinders as much as encourages 
the police. In a cynical touch, the police crack down on all criminal 
activities in order to catch the killer, prompting the shadow society of 
professional crooks to track him down themselves.
In the powerful finale, Becker is put on trial by the underworld and 
pleads his case on the surprisingly moving grounds that his accusers 
have only chosen to commit crimes, whereas he is compelled to commit 
them. Though the film establishes Inspector Karl "Fatty" Lohmann (Otto 
Wernicke)—who would return to take on Lang's eponymous archfiend 
(Rudolf Klein-Rogge) in The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933)—and black-
gloved criminal kingpin Schranker (Gustaf Gründgens) as traditional 
cop-and-crook antagonists, Lorre's desperate, clear-eyed, animal-like 
impulse murderer is the final voice of M, forcing his persecutors (and us) 
to look into themselves for the seeds of a psychosis that equals his own. 
Creatively emphasizing the technological developments in film sound, 
Lang has the killer heard before he is seen (allegedly, the director dubbed 
Lorre's whistling) and identified by a blind witness.  KN

The greatness of Carl Theodor Dreyer's first sound film derives partly 
from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism, 
and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has 
something to do with the director's radical recasting of narrative form. 
Synopsizing the film not only betrays but also misrepresents it: While 
never less than mesmerizing, it confounds conventions for establishing 
point of view and continuity and invents a narrative language all its own. 
Some of the moods and images conveyed by this language are truly 
uncanny: the long voyage of a coffin from the apparent viewpoint of the 
corpse inside; a dance of ghostly shadows inside a barn; a female 
vampire's expression of carnal desire for her fragile sister; an evil doctor's 
mysterious death by suffocation in a flour mill; and a protracted dream 
sequence that manages to dovetail eerily into the narrative proper.
Financed and produced by a Dutch cinephile, Baron Nicolas de 
Gunzburg—who was cast in the leading role of David Gray under the 
pseudonym of Julian West—Vampyr was freely adapted from a short 
story by Sheridan Le Fanu, "Carmilla," that appeared in his collection 
Through a Glass Darkly (not a novel, as stated erroneously in the film's 
credits). Like most of Dreyer's other sound features, it flopped 
commercially when it came out, then went on to become somewhat of 
a horror and fantasy (as well as art movie) staple, despite never fitting 
snugly or unambiguously in any of these generic categories.
The remarkable soundtrack, created entirely in a studio, in contrast 
to the images, which were all filmed on location, is an essential part of 
the film's voluptuous and haunting otherworldliness. Vampyr was 
originally released by Dreyer in four separate versions—French, English, 
German, and Danish. Most circulating prints now contain portions of 
two or three of these versions, although the dialogue is pretty sparse. If 
you've never seen a Dreyer film and wonder why many critics regard him 
as possibly the greatest of all filmmakers, this chilling horror fantasy is 
the perfect place to begin to understand.  JRos

I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang  
Mervyn LeRoy, 1932
93
The grandpappy of prison movies, Mervyn LeRoy's searing indictment 
of penal practices common in its day was, with its titanic performance 
from Paul Muni (in a neat reversal from his thuggish role as Scarface the 
same year), arguably the finest of the hard-hitting social-protest dramas 
Warner Brothers specialized in during the 1930s. 
Based on an autobiographical story by Robert E. Burns, I Am a Fugitive 
from a Chain Gang vividly depicts an innocent man brutalized and 
criminalized as a down-on-his-luck World War I veteran who is railroaded 
into shackles and hard labor in the Deep South. Having broken out once 
to make a decent new life, he is betrayed, escapes again, and is 
condemned to life as a broken fugitive. Rock splitting, sadistic guards, 
escapes (including the seminal pursuit by baying bloodhounds through 
a swamp), solitary confinement—the vocabulary of the behind-bars 
genre was laid down here. Worth seeing just to appreciate how often it 
has been referenced, the film is dated but still powerfully disturbing 
down to the famously haunting last line. As Muni's fugitive, Jim, slips 
away into the night, his lover plaintively calls out, "How do you live?" 
From the darkness comes the tragically ironic whisper, "I steal."  AE
Boudu sauvé des eaux  Jean Renoir, 1932
Boudu Saved from Drowning
Renoir had already made eleven films before being selected to direct 
Boudu Saved from Drowning by Michel Simon, who had decided to 
produce this adaptation of a play by René Fauchois. The pair had worked 
together three times previously and were both rising personalities with 
a sense of freedom and a desire to explore unknown territories.
So, like a monstrous Aphrodite, Simon's Boudu the tramp was reborn 
from the water, brought back to a life he wanted to leave by the kindness 
and generosity of the Lestingois family. Of course, comparisons with 
Charlie Chaplin's character come to mind here, and the two tramps have 
a lot in common—the survivor's sense of life, the amoral relationship 
with society's rules, the focus on rich versus poor, and the urge for sex. 
But it is the differences between the two that reveal the power of the 
recipe above, about the film's connection and rupture with vaudeville, 
and about the body and diction of Simon.
As Boudu, Simon's voice and physical presence work together as an 
eruption of carnality, a dissonant yet mesmerizing cello disturbing the 
happy quartet of the nice home filled with nice people. Boudu's ultimate 
return to the archaic spring is not only the smiling twist of an epicurean 
tale but also a troubling assessment of the hypothesis of a continuity 
between the oldest past and a future toward which the river flows.  J-MF

As with so many of the sadly underrated Rouben Mamoulian's finest 
films, the delightful thing about this variation on the romantic Ruritanian 
musical is the way he manages to debunk, through a combination of 
irreverent humor and technical innovation, the traditions of the very 
genre he is simultaneously helping to establish and expand. Here he 
contrives to outstrip the achievements of the then-widely-acclaimed 
masters of the form—Ernst Lubitsch and René Clair—without seeming 
to make an effort; he makes the whole thing feel wonderfully relaxed, 
good-natured, and somehow perfect. True, he is helped to no end by 
having Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's witty yet melodious songs to 
work with; but it's the unforced sense of sophisticated fun coexisting 
with real cinematic invention that reveal the Mamoulian touch.
Jeannette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier must also take credit 
for playing their respective romantic leads—the haughty but bored (and, 
let it be said, sexually frustrated) princess holed up in a musty chateau, 
and the visiting tailor ("the best in Paris") sufficiently aroused by her to 
forget his lowly status—with emotional commitment and an engagingly 
delicate parodic irony. The supporting cast is top-notch, too: Myrna Loy, 
Charles Ruggles, Charles Butterworth, and the inimitable Sir C. Aubrey 
Smith (the last three especially delightful when improbably enlisted to 
sing, solo, verses of "Mimi") are merely the most memorable. But what is 
really impressive about Love Me Tonight is how music, dance, dialogue, 
performance, decor, lighting, camera work, editing, and special effects 
are all combined to create a cogent whole in which each element serves 
narrative, characterization, and theme. The "Isn't It Romantic?" sequence, 
for example, which starts with Chevalier and a client in Paris, and 
proceeds with the song being passed via various minor characters 
(including, at one point, a whole platoon of soldiers!) to arrive finally at 
the lonely MacDonald's boudoir—the first link between the future lovers, 
who have yet to meet—is impressive; so, too, is the final, climactic chase 
sequence (as exhilaratingly constructed as anything by the Soviets and 
with far more wit). In short, an enormously entertaining masterpiece.  GA

In the seven films he made with her, Josef von Sternberg took his 
obsession with Marlene Dietrich to ever more extreme lengths of 
intensity and stylization, until both star and story were all but subsumed 
in a welter of spectacle and design. Coming at the midpoint of the cycle, 
Shanghai Express holds the elements in near-perfect balance.
Sternberg loved to treat his films as controlled experiments in the 
play of light and shadow, so a plot whose action is largely confined to 
the eponymous train suited him perfectly. The story, such as it is, 
concerns a train journey from Peking to Shanghai, interrupted by a 
bandit attack. But the subject of the film is Dietrich's face, on which it 
plays an endless series of variations: veiled, shadowed, wreathed with 
smoke, nestling in furs or feathers, framed in intricate patterns of black 
on white. Dietrich herself, as the "notorious China coaster," Shanghai Lily, 
remains enigmatic, her eyes hooded and watchful, as Sternberg—and 
his regular cinematographer, Lee Garmes—use her face as an exquisite 
screen on which to project the appropriate emotions.
The setting of Shanghai Express, constructed in the studio artifice that 
Sternberg always preferred, is an elaborately conceived and utterly 
fictitious China, embodied in the film's opening sequence: a huge, 
dazzlingly white locomotive steams out of Peking Station and straight 
down the middle of a narrow street seething with lampshade-hatted 
coolies, street vendors, children, and animals. Years later, Sternberg 
visited China for the first time and was gratified to discover that the 
reality differed completely. 
Clive Brook as Lily's ex-lover, a British army captain, plays the kind of 
staunchly traditional Englishman beside whose stiff upper lip steel-
reinforced concrete would seem flabby, and Anna May Wong is no less 
enjoyably cartoonish as the embodiment of feline Eastern guile. But the 
film belongs to Sternberg and Dietrich, and the strange fetishistic 
chemistry between them. Together they created something deliriously 
unique in cinema; apart they were never quite able to recapture the 
same magic.  PK

Trouble in Paradise  Ernst Lubitsch, 1932
After his emigration from Europe and arrival in Hollywood at the tail end 
of the silent era, Ernst Lubitsch quickly established himself as a master 
of the technical with an ear for comedic pacing. Admirers called his 
particular talents the "Lubitsch Touch," but Lubitsch didn't work with any 
set formula or system. Rather, he brought from Europe a sophisticated 
sensibility that sent gentle shock waves through Hollywood, changing 
the tone of American comedies and leading to the rise of the "screwball" 
antics of Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder, both of whom revered him.
But that same sophistication kept Lubitsch from veering precipitously 
toward slapstick or more overt physical humor. That famed "Lubitsch 
Touch" indicated his deft method of delivering sexual politics with a 
barely discernible wink, and that meant a clever way with words and 
stories to subvert, surmount, or gently prod the relatively prudish 
(though still pre-Hays Code) American standards.
The most carnal and clever aspects of the "Lubitsch Touch" are firmly 
on display from the first frame of Trouble in Paradise, one of the director's 
first sound features. The title appears initially only in parts, so that for a 
moment the words "Trouble in . . ." linger over a shot of a bed. By the time 
the word ". . . Paradise" finally pops up, Lubitsch has already made clear 
what he meant by "Trouble in Paradise": The film may as well be titled 
"Trouble in Bed." Of course, Trouble in Paradise is only indirectly about 
sex, but that is typically the case with romantic comedies, of which 
Lubitsch was a significant pioneer.
Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins are a match made in heaven. 
Playing expert thieves and con artists Lily (Hopkins) and Gaston Monescu 
(Marshall), their courtship consists of robbing each other blind one 
fateful night in Venice. Over dinner they trade tentative praise, revealing 
stolen personal items in lieu of more traditional flirtation. Theirs is a 
romance built on deception, an ironic aphrodisiac, and they don't think 
anything of the other's chosen profession. "Baron, you are a crook," asserts 
Lily, "May I have the salt?" Life is good until the pair set their eyes on 
heiress Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis). Lily sees a big bank account, 
but Gaston sees more. He tries to seduce his way into her safe, but finds 
his feelings for the heiress keep getting in the way.
The film's plot machinations are needed to toss the characters 
together, but Trouble in Paradise is less concerned with the big con than 
it is with companionship. Gaston initially wants Madame Colet's money, 
but all the lonely heiress wants is Gaston, and soon the two become 
lovers, much to Lily's chagrin. But Trouble in Paradise is nowhere near as 
predictable as it seems. Love is something that can't be stolen or bought, 
which explains the quandary of Lubitsch's compulsively criminal lead 
characters. As much as Gaston and Lily covet Madame Colet's fortune, 
even at the cost of their relationship, they realize their uniquely larcenous 
dispositions make them particularly well suited for one another.  JKl

Introducing one of cinema history's most notorious, Machiavellian 
monsters in the perverted Horatio Alger myth that lies at the heart of 
every gangster film, Scarface: The Shame of a Nation stands as the peak 
of its genre. And it's a telling sign that Brian De Palma's 1983 version of 
the film, despite all the accolades accorded it, does nothing to diminish 
the power of Howard Hawks's original. On the contrary, like Shakespeare 
at his best, the film's seductive combination of fascination and revulsion 
with its corrupted protagonist and his equally corrupted world makes 
up the very fabric of the drama.
Completed before Hollywood's conservative Production Code 
became more rigidly enforced in 1934, ex-journalist Ben Hecht's 
screenplay uses the Al Capone legend as source material—staging 
recreations of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and the murder of Big Jim 
Colosimo—to show Prohibition-era Chicago as a modern-day Sodom 
and Gomorrah. Amorality is rampant: Cops are brutal and on the take, 
journalists are cynical muckrakers. In contrast, the Capone-like 
protagonist Tony "Scarface" Camonte (Paul Muni) is at least frank in his 
greedy quest for power and the almighty dollar.
The ultimate irony of Scarface is that everything goes well as long as 
Tony treats his killing spree as purely business. The moment his emotions 
come into play, he's doomed. Much can be made of the strange twist in 
the plot when Tony starts losing control because of his violent jealousy 
concerning the love affair between his sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak) and his 
best friend, Guino Rinaldo (George Raft). This could stem from incestuous 
feelings for his sister, or indicate a repressed homosexual bond with his 
friend. Hawks effectively underlines Tony's road to ruin with heavy 
symbolism, achieved via expressive lighting and street signs. The 
gangster is initially seen as a Nosferatu-like silhouette on the wall as he 
commits his first murder. At the end, his final showdown is marked by 
cross-shaped shadows and his dead body lying in the gutter under a 
travel sign that reads, ironically, "The world is yours."  MT

From its beginning as a horror movie exceeding all expectations 
(via Dwain Esper's exploitation of it under such dubious and misleading 
titles as Forbidden Love, Monster Show, and Nature's Mistakes), to its 
revival as an avant-garde film in the tradition of Luis Buñuel and Alain 
Robbe-Grillet, Tod Browning's Freaks has been classed as everything 
from horror to art house to documentary (because of the movie's use of 
"real freaks"). Nevertheless, despite its originality of conception and 
design, and its startling ability to both move and frighten audiences, 
Freaks has remained to this day an underappreciated film.
Freaks opens with a carnival barker addressing some curious 
spectators. After the crowd catches sight of the female sideshow freak 
nearby, several women scream and the barker starts telling her story. 
Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), a beautiful trapeze artist with the carnival, 
is adored by a midget named Hans (Harry Earles). But Cleopatra is having 
an affair with Hercules (Henry Victor), the Strong Man, and the couple 
devise a plot to get their hands on Hans's recently inherited fortune: 
Cleopatra will marry the midget she despises and then poison him. 
During an unforgettable wedding ceremony-cum-initiation ritual, 
Cleopatra rebuffs the assembled freaks, teasing them mercilessly and 
calling them "dirty" and "slimy." Back in her wagon she poisons Hans's 
drink, but her plan is foiled and she is attacked by the freaks, who have 
banded together to exact a brutal revenge. Finally returning to the 
carnival barker in the present, we now see the result of the freaks' attack 
on Cleopatra: she has been turned into a legless, half-blind stump—a 
squawking chicken woman. A final scene, tacked on later as the studio 
insisted on a happy ending, shows Hans living like a millionaire, 
reconciled with his midget ex-girlfriend Frieda (Daisy Earles).
But no mere plot summary can do justice to this alarming yet 
profound movie, which truly must be seen to be believed. It is a supreme 
oddity (freak?) of world cinema considered by many to be the most 
remarkable film in the career of a director whose credits include the 
original version of Dracula (1931).  BH

42nd Street  Lloyd Bacon, 1933
"Sawyer, you're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a 
star!" The grandmother of backstage musicals is still a tuneful charmer 
(verified by its adaptation into a Broadway hit fifty years later), but it also 
occupies a special place in film history, for several appealing reasons.
42nd Street's plot became one of the best-loved bores of showbiz lore. 
Fresh-faced dancer Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler), newly arrived in New York 
during the Depression, lands a job in the chorus of a musical called Pretty 
Lady. The show's temperamental star, Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels), 
injures her ankle the night before the show opens, so "real little trouper" 
Peggy steps into the lead and, with the fate of the company riding on 
her, bravely goes out there and wows 'em. The script is a cherishable and 
disarming mix of naïveté, smart toughness, and sassy repartee.
Fleshing out the drama is a cast of characters who became archetypes: 
the stressed and ailing director (Warner Baxter, whose bullying and pep 
talks to his company are classic); the harassed dance director (George E. 
Stone); the saucy, wisecracking chorus girls (Una Merkel and Ginger 
Rogers); the puppyish juvenile (Dick Powell); and the well-heeled, 
lecherous backer (Guy Kibbee) with designs on the leading lady, who 
strings him along while conducting a clandestine romance with a down-
on-his-luck vaudevillian (George Brent). The winning cast is a remarkable 
ensemble. The wonderful Baxter had won the Best Actor Oscar for In Old 
Arizona's dashing bandito hero, The Cisco Kid. Daniels was a top star of 
silent pictures who could also sing. Brent was another established 
romantic lead. Billed beneath them, half a dozen actors were already 
popular faces, including Rogers, soon to be teamed with Fred Astaire. 
Dick Powell, baby-faced and peppy, was among those whose careers 
were launched by 42nd Street. The big discovery in her film debut was 
Ruby Keeler, Broadway darling and wife of Al Jolson. She wasn't much 
of a singer but was adorable, sweetly vivacious, and a tap-dancing treat.
Generally, Warner Brothers films were renowned for realism. But to 
boost their musical fortunes, Mervyn LeRoy (who developed this project 
before illness made him defer directing to Lloyd Bacon) brought in 
songwriters Al Dubin and Harry Warren, who became chief tunesmiths for 
Warner Brothers. LeRoy also insisted on inventive dance director Busby 
Berkeley, who had enlivened several musical comedies for Sam Goldwyn. 
He made much out of the snappy songs, including "Shuffle off to Buffalo," 
"Young and Healthy," and "You're Beginning to be a Habit with Me." For the 
show-stopping title song finale, Berkeley created an immortal production 
number in which Ruby—dancing atop a taxi—swaying Manhattan 
skyscrapers, and scantily clad beauties arranged in geometric patterns 
shot from high overhead form a sensational rhythmic kaleidoscope. After 
seeing what he was up to, Warner Brothers contracted Berkeley and gave 
him carte blanche, initiating a long run of dazzling dance confections that 
brightened the decade and remain a highlight in screen musicals.  AE

Footlight Parade  Lloyd Bacon, 1933
The greatest of all Depression-era musicals, Footlight Parade is really two 
films in one. The first is a fast, funny backstage story about frantic efforts 
to stage live musical interludes at movie houses, with James Cagney in 
top form as a hard-driving producer too preoccupied to appreciate his 
adoring secretary (Joan Blondell). The second is a climactic juggernaut 
of three consecutive Busby Berkeley spectacles, the rigor of whose 
design is matched by their uninhibited imagery.
I will pass too quickly over "Honeymoon Hotel," which takes a 
wholesomely naughty tour through an establishment devoted to conjugal 
bliss, and "Shanghai Lil," which transforms rakish oriental decadence into 
rousing New Deal morale boosting, in order to concentrate on "By a 
Waterfall." This aquatic rhapsody, featuring the glistening bodies and 
geometric group formations displayed by a bevy of water nymphs, 
pushes its central tension between form and flesh further and further 
until it reaches an abstract outer space where depth collapses. The 
distinction between air and water dissolves and human bodies mutate 
into elemental cell-like units. You can have the "Star Gate" climax of 2001: 
A Space Odyssey; when it comes to consciousness-expanding cinematic 
trips, I'll take a plunge into Berkeley's "Waterfall."  MR
Frank Capra's atypical melodrama concerns an American missionary 
(Barbara Stanwyck) in Shanghai—a prim New England type named Megan 
Davis, engaged to another missionary, her childhood sweetheart. During 
an outbreak of civil war, she's taken prisoner by a Chinese warlord named 
Yen (Nils Asther). The unlikely love story that ensues is not only Capra's 
unsung masterpiece but also one of the great Hollywood love stories of 
the 1930s: subtle, delicate, moody, mystical, and passionate. Joseph 
Walker shot it through filters and with textured shadows that suggest 
the work of Josef von Sternberg; Edward Paramore wrote the script, 
adapted from a story by Grace Zaring Stone. Oddly enough, this perverse 
and beautiful film was chosen to open Radio City Music Hall in 1933. It 
was not one of Capra's commercial successes, but it arguably beats the 
rest of his films by miles, and both Stanwyck and Asther are extraordinary.
Among the film's highlights is a remarkable dream sequence in which 
Megan's bedroom is broken into by a Yellow Peril monster whom one 
assumes is Yen, and then Megan is saved by a masked man in western 
clothes, whom one assumes is her fiancé. But when she removes the 
mask, it turns out to be Yen, who is standing beside her when she wakes. 
No less memorable is the exquisite final sequence—which might be 
interpreted as a Hollywood brand of pop Buddhism, though it's rendered 
with sweetness and delicacy.  JRos

The Bitter Tea of General Yen  Frank Capra, 1933

She Done Him Wrong remains the 
shortest picture to be nominated for 
a Best Picture Academy Award.
"Listen, when women 
go wrong, men go right 
after them."
Lady Lou (Mae West)
1933
i
In the early 1930s, Hollywood—beset with financial difficulties and 
production problems related to the conversion to sound cinema—
turned to stage performers of proven popularity to lure customers back 
to the theaters. Among the most notable of these was Mae West, whose 
play Diamond Lil (which she wrote as a kind of showcase of her several 
talents) was immensely successful on Broadway and elsewhere. West 
proved a happy choice for Paramount because her unique brand of 
sophisticated if bawdy humor easily translated on screen; her first film, 
Night After Night (1932), was a big hit with audiences. West's antics, 
especially her famous double entendres and sleazy style, offended 
religious conservatives of the time and hastened the foundation of the 
Breen Office in 1934 to enforce the Production Code (promulgated, but 
widely ignored, in the early 1930s). West's post-1934 films, although 
interesting, never recaptured the appeal of her earlier work, of which She 
Done Him Wrong—the screen adaptation of Diamond Lil—is the most 
notable example, even garnering an Academy Award nomination.
West plays a "saloon keeper" in New York's Bowery who is involved 
with  various criminals in the neighborhood. As Lady Lou, West is pursued 
by two local entrepreneurs and her fiancé is just released from jail, but 
she is hardly in need of a man as she inhabits lavish quarters above her 
establishment, replete with servants and an impressive collection of 
diamond jewelry. Lou, however, is smitten by her new neighbor, the 
head of the Salvation Army mission (Cary Grant). Her initial appraisal of 
the younger man's attractiveness is part of Hollywood legend. To Grant 
she utters the famous line "Why don't you come up sometime, see me." 
As a demonstration of her affection (and power), she uses some of her 
considerable hoard of diamonds to purchase his mission and make him 
a present of it. In the end, Grant is revealed as a detective who promptly 
takes all the crooks into custody, but "imprisons" Lou quite differently—
with a wedding ring. A classic Hollywood comedy, full of naughtiness 
and good humor.  RBP

Duck Soup  Leo McCarey, 1933
Released in 1933, this madcap comedy is the crowning glory of the 
comic team of the Marx Brothers, a New York phenomenon who honed 
their performing skills through vaudeville and went on to take Broadway 
with a series of comedies including The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers. 
More than original performers, their timing was perfect in more ways 
than one: sound technology was taking over films just as they peaked 
on the stages of New York and looked for new audiences to conquer.
Among the five films made in Paramount's New York studios by the 
brothers—Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo—Duck Soup is the last to 
feature all of them (Zeppo, the youngest brother and the group's straight 
man, went on to be an agent and inventor). It's crammed with visual and 
verbal gags, most of which are as fresh and funny today as they were in 
1933. As with so many classics, Duck Soup enjoyed less-than-vigorous box-
office traffic. In fact, Paramount canceled the Marx Brothers' contract soon 
afterward, causing them to head west to Hollywood and MGM, where 
A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races were made.
Duck Soup is only 70 minutes long, but it packs in a seemingly endless 
string of virtually anything that might get a laugh, from jabs at Paul 
Revere and snide asides about then-current musicals to unexpected use 
of stock footage and astonishingly inventive physical sketches like the 
"three-hat routine," perfected by the brothers on stage over the years, 
and the famous mirror sequence. This routine—imitated by comics ever 
since—features Groucho, dressed in nightgown, nightcap, mustache, 
and cigar, meeting "himself' (Harpo as an identical image) in a doorway.
The plot, as such, involves Groucho as the dictator of the state of 
Freedonia—Rufus T. Firefly. His patron is the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale, 
played with ineffable dignity and grace under pressure by Margaret 
Dumont, the perfect outrageous foil and the subject of most of Groucho's 
forcefully memorable putdowns. If the physical gags and Groucho's 
dialogue style were their own, the scripts had expert input from many 
terrific comedy writers, among them S.J. Perelman. More than a great 
physical comedy act, the Marx Brothers were comedians lucky enough to 
have witty dialogue and keen observation, another reason why Duck Soup 
has survived whereas the films of, say, the Ritz Brothers remain unrevered.
Sylvanian Ambassador Trintino (Louis Calhern) wants Freedonia for 
his own and so pays Harpo and Chico to be his intelligence agents. This 
slender plot line is strong enough to support some of the best comedy 
sequences ever filmed, and offensive enough to some to count as 
Surrealist satire. Benito Mussolini banned the film in Italy because he 
took Groucho's role as a personal attack; nothing could have pleased the 
brothers more. Again, before the film's release, a small city in New York 
called Fredonia complained about the use of its name as well as the 
additional "e"; the response from the Marx Brothers camp was reassuringly 
predictable: "Change the name of your town, it's hurting our picture."  KK

Zéro de conduite  Jean Vigo, 1933
Zero for Conduct
"Young Devils at College," the subtitle of Zero for Conduct, suggests a mild 
romp in the Carry On vein, but Jean Vigo's classic short film means 
business. At stake in this vignette of childhood rebellion against an 
oppressive school institution is nothing less than a veritable Surrealist 
manifesto—one whose cosmic dimension is assured by the final shot in 
which its young devils, triumphant on a rooftop, appear ready to take flight.
This is a terrific movie to spring on students unprepared for what 
they will see: full frontal nudity, scatological and body-obsessed humor, 
antireligious blasphemy, and insistent homoeroticism. But it transcends 
the simple duality of youth versus authority (unlike its loose remake, the 
1968 film If....) via its vision of inescapable, polymorphous perversity: 
Even the stuffiest teachers here are twisted, secretly wild at heart.
The hearty provocation happens as much on the level of form as 
content: the experiments with slow-motion, animation, and trick 
photography are prodigious and wondrous. Vigo had absorbed the 
avant-gardism of Luis Buñuel and René Clair, but he also invented a 
unique aesthetic form: the "aquarium shot," a claustrophobic space in 
which strange apparitions are produced from every available corner and 
pocket—cinema as a magic act.  AM
Gold Diggers of 1933  Mervyn LeRoy, 1933
Of the series of classic early 1930s Warner Brothers musicals featuring 
numbers by Busby Berkeley, Gold Diggers of 1933 is the one that most 
strongly evokes the Great Depression. The bawdy, wisecracking screenplay 
centers on struggling Broadway showgirls who do what's necessary—
including the use of "gold-digging" techniques on rich suckers—to keep 
the wolf from the door. The film's latter stages are dominated by three 
spectacular Berkeley numbers: the racy "Pettin' in the Park," elegant 
"Shadow Waltz," and topical "Remember My Forgotten Man."
An ironic disparity between onstage opulence and offstage 
economic crisis is established in the "We're in the Money" curtain-raiser, 
when a peppy paean to prosperity being rehearsed by coin-covered 
chorines is broken up by the show's creditors. The opening number's 
correlation of sex and money foreshadows the climactic "Remember My 
Forgotten Man," in which a streetwalker (Joan Blondell) laments the 
common man's closely linked losses of earning power and sexual virility, 
in poignant contrast to his forgotten World War I military glory. With its 
partisan references to the controversial 1932 Bonus March of jobless

Kong's roar was created by 
combining the roars of a lion and 
tiger, then running them backward.
"Taxi! Follow that ape!"
Jack Driscoll 
(Bruce Cabot)
1933
i
The undisputed champ of all monster movies—and an early Hollywood 
high-water mark for special effects work—King Kong remains one of the 
most lasting and beloved motion picture masterpieces. Essentially a 
simian take on the Beauty and the Beast fable, told without the 
transformative happy ending and on a gargantuan scale, Merian C. 
Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's film fuses groundbreaking model 
work and emotional resonance to a degree rarely replicated by the 
literally hundreds of imitators that inevitably followed in its wake.
The story essentially plays out like that age-old conflict between city 
and nature. An expedition team arrives on the ominously named Skull 
Island, attracted by the promise that a giant prehistoric gorilla, feared 
and worshipped by the natives, might be brought home to New York and 
exploited as a must-see attraction. But mighty Kong doesn't take well to 
being caged and escapes on a destructive spree through the Big Apple.
The scenes set on Skull Island remain impressive even to this day, 
from Kong's magnificent first appearance to the number of other 
prehistoric creatures he and the expedition face in protecting or seeking, 
respectively, the abducted Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). Indeed, Kong is 
intimidated by Ann's beauty, and when he inevitably flees captivity and 
roams through New York City, the first thing he does is capture the young 
woman and retain her as his prisoner of love. Straddling the Empire State 
Building and swatting away pesky airplanes, King would ultimately rather 
sacrifice his own life than hurt Ann, which gives the film its famous, 
touching sign-off: "'Twas beauty killed the beast."
That the giant ape shifts from feared antagonist to sympathetic 
protagonist, with the former of course the perspective of his pursuers, 
shows the success of Willis O'Brian's intricate and expressive stop-
animation work (future stop-animation savant Ray Harryhausen worked 
as his assistant). Although it is a B-movie at heart, King Kong set Hollywood's 
special effects fetish on fast forward, and a case could be made that thanks 
to Kong, many of today's films focus far more on flash than story. But unlike 
contemporary special effects exercises, the majesty of Kong is destined to 
endure, thanks in no small part to the "performance" of its giant lead.  JKl

King Kong  Merian C. Cooper & Ernest B. Schoedsack, 1933

An extraordinarily powerful yet wholly unsentimental account of 
poverty, disease, malnutrition, and ignorance allowed to exist in a 
supposedly civilized Christian nation, Luis Buñuel's documentary Land 
Without Bread was shot in the remote mountainous region of Las 
Hurdes—a small area just north of Extremadura, less than 60 miles 
(100 kilometers) south of the glories of the university city of Salamanca—
in 1932. Physical, psychic, and social ills are all calmly observed by a 
dispassionate camera, Buñuel realizing that the images would speak 
volumes for themselves. Nonetheless, he juxtaposed shots of the riches 
to be found in Catholic churches and, it was learned later, was not above 
shooting a goat or smearing an ailing ass with honey (to attract a lethal 
swarm of bees) to emphasize his argument.
But what does all this have to do with a Surrealist? The horrors are 
not only on view, but they're also the stuff of nightmare; Buñuel also 
seems all too aware that the only true release from the Hurdanos's 
cruel sufferings (unless State and Church intervene, at least) is death 
itself, and certainly many of the actions taken to alleviate their hunger 
and pain seem informed by a perverse desire for extinction. Cruel, cool, 
strangely beautiful, and as pungent as sulfur.  GA

Sons of the Desert  William A. Seiter, 1933
109
Essentially a remake of the duo's 1930 film Be Big, this full-length Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Hardy comedy was their fourth feature, and arguably 
their best. Although other Laurel and Hardy films are, subjectively at 
least, equal to this one, they tend to inhabit atypical worlds—the fairyland 
of Babes in Toyland (1934), for example, or the western fantasy of Way Out 
West (1937). Although Sons of the Desert may be one of Laurel and Hardy's 
most conventional comedies, it best represents the strange domestic hell 
the duo inhabit in their finest work, a childlike world full of domineering 
wives, clandestine fun sessions, and illicit smoking and drinking.
Centering around a trip to Hawaii with the Freemason-like fraternity 
of the title, and Stan and Ollie's attempts to conceal this jaunt from 
their wives, Sons of the Desert takes a basic farce plot and turns it into a 
vehicle for motion picture comedy's greatest double act. Superb 
supporting performances, most notably from Mae Busch as Mrs. Hardy 
and comedian-director Charley Chase as a drunken version of himself, 
along with capable direction from William A. Seiter (whose other notable 
comedy was the Marx Brothers' workmanlike Room Service in 1938), 
also make Sons of the Desert—unusually for an eighty-year-old film 
comedy—utterly watchable today.  KK
Queen Christina  Rouben Mamoulian, 1933
Rouben Mamoulian's re-creation of the seventeenth-century Swedish 
court provides Greta Garbo with a perfect vehicle to dominate the 
screen. The historical Christina, daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, was a 
reclusive aesthete who eventually abdicated in order to have a life of her 
own and change her Lutheranism for Catholicism. Garbo's version, by 
way of contrast, is an alluring mixture of masculine and feminine 
qualities. Learned and resolute, she is also sexually experienced, even 
aggressive, yet committed to her independence.
The plot (which seems to have borrowed a good deal from screen 
versions of England's Elizabeth I) centers on her counselors' demand that 
she marry Charles of France, which angers her and her "consort," the burly 
Count Magnus (Ian Keith). Fleeing the court—and the restrictions placed 
on her as a woman—Christina dresses like a man and encounters, by 
chance, the Spanish ambassador, Antonio (John Gilbert, whom Garbo was 
romancing at the time). What follows are comic scenes of sexual disguise, 
as Christina begins to fall deeply in love with Antonio, and deep eroticism. 
When Antonio is killed protecting her honor, Christina abdicates, achieving 
the solitude that, because of her rank and personal qualities, seems her fate 
from the beginning. Garbo's performance in the role is inspired, helped by 
the glamorizing touch of Mamoulian's camera. Well-conceived art design, 
editing, and music make Queen Christina sensational viewing.  RBP

Triumph des Willens  Leni Riefenstahl, 1934
Triumph of the Will
It was Adolf Hitler himself who commissioned dancer and actress-turned-
filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl to make a grand, celebratory record of the 
sixth Nazi Party Congress held in September 1934 at Nuremberg—the 
medieval Bavarian showplace where, with deliberate irony, a court of 
Allied victors would convene in 1945-46 to judge war criminals of the 
Third Reich. Hitler also gave her the film's title. Riefenstahl was a careerist 
as well as a creative talent and, her postwar protestations to the contrary, 
there is evidence (not only here but in her photojournalistic coverage of 
the invasion of Poland and in her later use of concentration camp inmates 
as "extras") that her enthusiasm for fascism was crafty, if debatably, naïve. 
But any discussion of motivation cannot diminish the devastating impact 
of Triumph of the Will. This is an awesome spectacle, vulgar but mythic, 
and technically an overwhelming, assured accomplishment.
Nuremberg was as carefully prepared as if it were a massive soundstage 
housing a series of elaborate sets. Riefenstahl ordered new bridges and 
accesses constructed in the city center, and lighting towers and camera 
tracks built, all of which was carried out to her exact specifications. 
Deploying thirty cameras and 120 technicians, Riefenstahl brilliantly fulfilled 
her Nuremberg brief—to glorify the might of the Nazi state and tighten its 
grip on the hearts and minds of Germany—with breathtaking imagery on 
a spectacularly sinister, epic scale, creating an infamous masterpiece still 
regarded as the most powerful propaganda film ever made.
The documentary—which after six months' editing into a carefully 
selected two hours represents about three percent of the footage shot—
opens with Hitler's arrival by plane, his descent from the clouds given 
the character of a Wagnerian hero's entrance, with his head in a halo of 
sunlight. The Führer's acclamation by saluting multitudes is central to 
this presentation of his political philosophy as world theater, lending 
him a disturbing charisma despite the posturing and stridency so familiar 
from news archives, historical drama, and masterly parody, like Charlie 
Chaplin's in The Great Dictator (1940). Setting him off are a kaleidoscope of 
astonishing images: vigorous young men disporting, torchlit processions, 
swastika-brandishing ritual, militaristic display, thousands of well-drilled 
children pledging themselves to the Movement, and a continuous 
folkloric parade concluding with the Nazi anthem, the Horst Wessel Song.
Triumph of the Will is an unsubtle but innovative demonstration of 
technique, from ingenious camera angles and striking composition to 
the relentless pace of its canny editing. After World War II, Riefenstahl 
was imprisoned for four years by the Americans and the French for her 
role in the Nazi propaganda machine over her insistence that she made 
"pure historical film, film vérité." Repeated attempts to revive her career 
were unsuccessful. Later she discovered underwater photography and 
demonstrated that she still had an artist's eye.  AE

Undoubtedly the finest of all of W.C. Fields's comedies, It's a Gift may not 
offer the inspired insanity of such waywardly surreal gems as Never 
Give a Sucker an Even Break (1941) or the unforgettable short The Fatal 
Glass of Beer (1933), but it is certainly the most coherent and most 
consistently funny of his features.
Despite having been cobbled together from old revue sketches and 
scenes from earlier movies like It's the Old Army Game (1926), Norman Z. 
McLeod's It's a Gift actually provides something resembling a proper 
story. Harold Bissonette (Fields) is so tired of the constant pressures of 
family life and running a general store that he secretly buys, with his 
hard-earned savings, the Californian orange grove of his dreams, and 
sets off with his family (all vocally horrified by what he's done, naturally), 
only to discover that their purchase is nothing like the palace pictured 
in the advertisement. That said, of course, this "plot" is simply an excuse 
for another of Fields's marvelously misanthropic essays on the perils and 
pitfalls of parenthood, marriage, neighbors, and Prohibition, allowing 
him free rein to court our sympathy for an old curmudgeon who feels 
himself maltreated by virtually the entire world.
It is particularly difficult to select highlights from such a supremely even 
series of set pieces, but the catastrophically destructive visit to Fields's shop 
paid by the feeble, deaf, blind, and uncommonly belligerent Mr. Muckle 
(Charles Sellon) must rank as some kind of peak in politically incorrect 
hilarity. The protagonist's forlorn attempt to sleep on the porch—despite 
noisy neighbors, a nagging wife (the inimitable Kathleen Howard), a 
murderous screwdriver wielded by Baby LeRoy, a rolling coconut, a broken 
hammock, a rifle, and a quite crazily cheery insurance salesman in search 
of one Karl LaFong ("Capital K, small A, small R")—is quite simply as 
brilliant and nightmarish a portrait of ordinary life as deadpan Hollywood 
comedy ever got. Mind you, the shaving sequence is pretty great, too. 
Oh, and then there's the dinner with the family. Sheer genius.  GA

Who is the greatest actor of the 1930s? Katherine Hepburn? James 
Cagney? How about a less well-known name, Ruan Lingyu? Here she is 
in The Goddess, a silent Chinese film made in Shanghai. In such a golden 
decade for cinema, why should we be interested in Ruan and this film? 
Because each opens up a world of cinema with which we're unfamiliar. 
The Goddess is probably the first sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute 
in cinema. Ruan plays her with weary body language. She sells herself 
to pay for her son's education, but the school finds out and she's shunned. 
Director Wu Yonggang uses a beautiful tracking shot along a long row 
of other mothers to show how they whisper their disapproval from one 
to another. This was typical of Shanghaiese cinema of the 1930s: 
innovative, humanistic, leftist, female-centered, and subtly realist, more 
than a decade before Italian Neorealism. 
Such films were hugely popular; Ruan became "the Chinese Greta 
Garbo," a name that captures her mystery but not her believability. 
Ordinary women loved her. But tabloid gossip hounded her, and she 
committed suicide at the age of twenty-four. Her funeral made news 
around the world. And then she, like poetic, realist Chinese cinema of 
the 1930s, was quietly forgotten, at least in the West. In our Lazarus era, 
when old movies are coming back to life, The Goddess is a must-see.  MC

It Happened One Night  Frank Capra, 1934
Peter (Clark Gable) is a tough-talking journalist; Ellie (Claudette Colbert) 
is a "dizzy dame" on the run from home and her father. The two meet 
while on the road and are forced, reluctantly, to collaborate. He's the salt 
of the earth, she's a rich kid, and each exploits the other—for him, she 
means a big newspaper story, for her, he's a way to help her get to New 
York and a forbidden fiancé. In the course of the story, they move from 
antagonism to love. It could be one of a hundred routine, American 
romantic comedies of the 1930s or 1940s.
But, make no mistake, Frank Capra's It Happened One Night—the first 
of only three movies to win all five major Academy Awards, preceding 
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Silence of the Lambs (1991)—
is movie magic. This has something to do with how it conjures an entire 
milieu: a "people's America" filled with unlikely rogues and soft-hearted 
citizens, always ready to share a story and a song, or simply exhibit their 
lovable eccentricities. But the film is also careful to explore exceptions 
to its basic rule: Ellie's father, Andrews (Walter Connolly), turns out to 
be a pretty swell chap, just as the talkative bus passenger Shapeley 
(Roscoe Karns) ends up a weasel.
Capra was expert at cleverly weaving a story from altogether familiar 
and ordinary motifs: eating, verbal slang ("ah, nuts"), snoring, washing, 
dressing and undressing. True to the romantic comedy formula, identities 
are momentarily dissolved whenever a masquerade is necessary or able 
to be exploited for secret entertainment—although, whenever Peter and 
Ellie pretend to be husband and wife, more serious possibilities and 
destinies do suggest themselves.
It Happened One Night is a distant predecessor of today's "trash 
comedies," such as those by the Farrelly Brothers. Ass jokes abound and 
the pretensions and privileges of the wealthy are mercilessly mocked, 
while Colbert's famous, bare legs stop traffic. And then there is the sexual 
tension angle: Working patiently through four nights of Peter and Ellie 
together, the entire film hinges on the symbolism of the "walls of Jericho" 
finally toppling—the ridding of the blanket that stands, weakly and 
tremblingly, as the barrier to the consummation of their growing love.
Critics can't rhapsodize over Capra's powers of montage or mise-en-
scène; style was a functional, conventional matter for him. But he did 
have a perfect sense of script (in both overall structure and small details), 
and a brilliant rapport with his charismatic actors. Gable and Colbert 
help to truly equalize this one-upmanship battle of the sexes, diluting 
that ideological thrust of the script that suggests that proletarian guys 
should teach spoiled gals a thing or two about real life. In the infectious 
interplay of these stars—in their mutual willingness to play, to laugh, 
to be vulnerable, to take a joke as good they give it—we encounter an 
ideal that has been well and truly lost in contemporary, mainstream 
cinema: fighting reciprocity between the sexes.  AM

L'Atalante  Jean Vigo, 1934
Heretical as it may be to say it in these enlightened times of gender 
politics, Jean Vigo's masterpiece L'Atalante is the cinema's greatest ode 
to heterosexual passion. One simply cannot enter into its rapturous 
poetry without surrendering to the romantic series of oppositions 
between the sexes, comparisons rigorously installed at every possible 
level—spiritual, physical, erotic, and emotional. It is only this thrill of 
absolute "otherness" that can allow both the agony of nonalignment 
between lovers and the sublimity of their eventual fusion.
This is far removed from the typical romance of the time. As Vigo once 
memorably complained, it takes "two pairs of lips and three thousand 
meters of film to come together, and almost as many to come unstuck 
again." Like Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (1999), L'Atalante casts the 
immortal love story within an adventure tale: man (Jean Dasté as Jean) 
the seafaring adventurer, woman (Dita Parlo as Juliette) the city-craving 
settler. The seductive temptations and drifts that temporarily split them 
up are forecast in a charged moment of almost metaphysical agony: In 
thick fog, Jean stumbles blindly over the boat's barge until he finds his 
bride and envelops her in an embrace at once angry and relieved, 
inspiring them instantly to head below deck to make love.
Between these poles of man and woman, however, there is Père 
Jules (Michel Simon), master of the boat. It is surely the mark of Vigo's 
greatness as an artist that his imagination could project itself fully into 
both the heterosexual ideal and the fluid identity of this inspired 
madman. Jules is a multiple being, man and woman, child and adult, 
friend and lover, without boundaries—at one point even visually 
doubled as he wrestles himself. He is a living text covered with 
extravagant tattoos; he is the cinematic apparatus itself, able to 
produce sound from records with his magically electrified finger. Jules 
is Vigo's Surrealist sensibility incarnated by Simon, an astonishingly 
anarchic, instinctual performer.
Vigo develops and deepens the formal explorations of his previous 
film Zero for Conduct (1933). From silent, burlesque cinema and René 
Clair he borrows a parade gag for his prologue: stuffed shirts at the 
couple's funeral filing past the camera, gradually becoming faster until 
they are an unruly, disheveled mob. Aboard the boat, Vigo finds his 
beloved "aquarium spaces": enclosed rooms filled with cats, oddities, 
and wonders (as in Jules's cabin devoted to exotic bric-a-brac). On deck, 
he uses ghostly, nocturnal lighting. Unifying the film is a superb rhythmic 
and expressive tone.
Vigo's death at the age of twenty-nine was a tragic loss. But L'Atalante 
crowns his legacy—and is there any scene in cinema sexier than the 
magnificent, Eisensteinian montage of Jean's and Juliette's bodies, far 
apart, matched in postures of mutual arousal, an act of love made 
possible only through the soulful language of film?  AM

"As Truffaut has said, 
in filming prosaic words 
and acts, Vigo effortlessly 
achieved poetry."

The first screen teaming of the great monster stars of the 1930s, Boris 
Karloff (top-billed simply as "KARLOFF") and Bela Lugosi, The Black Cat is 
at once the most perverse and the artiest of the original run of Universal 
horror pictures, informed by the strange sensibilities of director Edgar 
G. Ulmer—beginning to seesaw between high art and poverty row—
and poetic pulp screenwriter Peter Ruric.
Based on Edgar Allan Poe's story only in concept, The Black Cat feels 
like the last German Expressionist horror film, with a tale of diabolism, 
revenge, necrophilia, betrayal, and bad manners set in a modernist 
castle (a rare instance of up-to-date Gothic) built by widow's-peaked 
Satanist-cum-architect Hjalmar Poelzig (Karloff) atop the mass grave 
of the soldiers he betrayed to the enemy during World War I. Horror-
style honeymooners David Manners and Jacqueline Wells are almost 
comically out of their depth, the templates for Brad and Janet in The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), as unwilling houseguests caught 
between Poelzig, who has his mistresses preserved like waxworks in 
cases in the cellar, and the vengeance-obsessed Vitus Werdegast 
(Lugosi), who winds up the odd chess-game plot by skinning the villain 
alive before the castle is blown up. Deliberately outrageous but also a 
tease, Karloff's elegantly delivered rituals are all commonplace clichés 
("cum granulo salis") delivered in a lisping Latin.  KN

1934
The chemistry between Myrna Loy and William Powell was so potent in 
the 1934 film Manhattan Melodrama that its director, W.S. Van Dyke, cast 
the two again in the same year. As Nick and Nora Charles, they are unique 
in the history of cinema. The first popular husband-and-wife detective 
team, they not only love each other, but they like each other, too, without 
being insipid, disrespectful, or dull.
The Thin Man's plot is a messy one. Nick Charles is officially a retired 
detective, but he takes a personal interest in the disappearance of a 
crotchety inventor—the "thin man" of the title—whose daughter 
(Maureen O'Sullivan) is Nick's long-time acquaintance. The inventor's 
safety is thrown into further doubt when complications arise involving 
his suspicious mistress, grasping ex-wife, and her money-hungry 
husband (Cesar Romero). With the addition of multifarious mobsters, 
cops, and molls, it seems the whole criminal world turns up at the 
Charles's luxurious hotel suite at one time or another.
Trying to make sense of the story gets in the way of what is genuinely 
important—the snappy banter full of covetable lines between the rich, 
sophisticated Nora and her sharp lush of a husband. Nick disarms an 
unwanted guest one night; the incident is reported in the morning news. 
"I was shot twice in the Tribune," says Nick. "I read you were shot five times 
in the tabloids," says Nora. "It's not true. He didn't come anywhere near 
my tabloids." Nick may seem like an alcoholic, but he springs back and 
forth from relaxed giddiness to active sobriety in the wink of an eye. 
The couple's prodigious boozing seems to have little effect on their 
actions; it's more of an elegant prop—a vital element for a country just 
coming out of the Great Depression.
Taken from a novel written in the same year by Dashiell Hammett, 
Nick and Nora were supposedly modeled on Hammett's relationship 
with playwright Lillian Hellman. Shot in fourteen days, this sparkling 
screwball detective story earned over $2 million and was nominated for 
four Academy Awards. Not surprisingly, popularity spawned four more 
movies as well as a radio and television series, and was the inspiration 
behind TV shows such as McMillian & Wife and Hart to Hart.  KK

Epitomizing the classic Hollywood spirit, Frank Lloyd's Mutiny on the 
Bounty is a masterwork of studio moviemaking. The film's spare-no-
expense canvas, travelogue quality, and moral center result in an 
adventure tale of remarkable beauty. Of course this overlooks an acting 
style long since left behind. Then there's an American cast imbuing this 
British cautionary tale with Depression-era optimism. Still, these minor 
criticisms serve to support how well produced the film is when 
considering MGM's house style that simultaneously emphasized profits, 
escapism, and the broadest possible entertainment.
Set in the late eighteenth century, when the British Empire crested 
across the decks of its navy, the crew of the ship Bounty mutinies after 
months of mistreatment. Led by Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), they put 
their cruel captain, Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton), to sea, only for him 
to find his way back to port in an effort nothing short of amazing. Into his 
wake sails the Bounty for the South Pacific, beset by various complications.
Gable appears without his mustache, and Laughton's bee-stung lips 
flutter with harsh discipline. In between are a number of nominal 
subplots, though in the end the film is perhaps most memorable as an 
early high-water mark for the art of production design.  GC-Q

After several tentative early steps and a few small breakthroughs, The 
39 Steps was the first clear creative peak in Alfred Hitchcock's British 
period and arguably marked the first fully successful film in the 
director's rapidly deepening oeuvre—starting at the end of the silent 
era, by the time of The 39 Steps he had already directed eighteen films. 
After the picture's financial and critical success, Hitchcock further 
solidified his reputation as a master filmmaker by embarking on a 
nearly unparalleled streak of compelling and entertaining thrillers that 
would stretch for several decades. And, indeed, many of his most 
popular films—North by Northwest (1959), for one—clearly have their 
roots in this early highlight.
Among its many noteworthy achievements, The 39 Steps introduced 
one key Hitchcock first: the notion of the innocent bystander accused, 
pursued, or punished for a crime he didn't commit. (The theme was one 
the director would return to again and again, most overtly in his 1956 
film The Wrong Man.) Richard Hannay (Robert Donat), a Canadian on 
vacation in England, meets a woman who is later murdered under 
mysterious circumstances. It seems he has stumbled into a spy plot 
involving something called "the 39 Steps," and he feels that with this 
knowledge only he can save the day. Handcuffed to an unwilling female 
accomplice (Madeleine Carroll), Hannay must simultaneously evade 
capture by the police and an archvillain with a missing finger in hot 
pursuit and reveal the titular mystery before it's too late.
In traditional Hitchcock fashion, the revelation of what "the 39 Steps" 
actually are—and indeed the entire spy plot—is almost peripheral to 
the flirtatious interplay between the two leads. Literally chained to one 
another in a teasing mockery of marriage, Donat and Carroll pack their 
quarrelsome exchanges with little innuendoes—when the chase leaves 
time for a breather, of course—morphing the espionage thriller into the 
unlikeliest of love stories. The film, like their relationship, plays out in a 
rush, a nonstop string of action sequences and chase scenes punctuated 
by witty dialogue and riveting suspense.  JKl

I was very young, not much more than ten years old, when I walked into 
a cinema in France to watch A Night at The Opera—or, more precisely, 
was sent there by some adult who knew as little as I did about the Marx 
Brothers. At my age, reading the subtitles was still rather difficult, 
especially when this jumping character with a mustache and a cigar was 
shouting words to the audience like a crazy machine gun. Since then I 
have had the pleasure of seeing A Night at the Opera again, several times, 
along with the rest of the Marx Brothers' work. I am aware of both the 
continuity and the variations in their movies, and have been amazed by 
the brilliance of their performances. But I still feel the incredible power 
of invention and transgression conveyed by this particular film.
More than the central scenes, like the crowd gathering in the ship 
cabin, A Night at the Opera remains such a strong and dazzling comedy 
thanks to its most elementary moments—a single word or gesture 
performed with an incredible sense of rhythm. There is much to say 
about the way the transgressive weapons of the three brothers initiate 
a crisis in the spectacle of an opera. Groucho's overflow of words and 
distortion of his body, Harpo's unnatural silence and childlike power of 
destruction, and Chico's virtuosity and "foreign ethos" all serve to disturb 
an opera based on a loathing of art, greed, and corruption. These 
elements do exist, and they are definitely interesting, but they come 
after this more obvious characteristic: A Night at the Opera was, and 
remains, a damn funny film.  J-MF

Universal Studios had to wait nearly four years before James Whale 
accepted the offer to direct the follow-up to his 1931 box-office success, 
Frankenstein. But it turned out to be worth the wait: under the director's 
nearly complete control (producer Carl Laemmle Jr., was vacationing in 
Europe during most of the production), Bride of Frankenstein is a surprising 
mix of terror and comedy in many ways superior to the original film.
Despite Boris Karloff's reluctance, it was decided that the Monster 
should now be able to pronounce a few chosen words. His humanization 
here makes him more complete and faithful to Mary Shelley's novel, and 
his desperate search for a friendly companion could hardly be more 
touching. Though it was played down at the censors' request, the Monster 
is mostly depicted in Bride of Frankenstein as a Christlike figure who is led 
to kill because of his circumstances and the fear he inspires in society. 
Even the monstrous mate intended just for him is repulsed at first glance 
by his physical aspect. Without a doubt, Elsa Lanchester's bride remains 
to this day one of the most astonishing creatures ever seen on-screen: 
her appearance—in a sort of grotesque version of a marriage ceremony—
is still a highlight of the horror genre, what with her mummified body, 
her swan-like hissing, and her black-and-white-streaked Egyptian hairdo.
Bride of Frankenstein's plot relies heavily on sharp contrasts that make 
the spectator jump from terror to pathos or comedy. Whale's sense of 
humor—often described as camp—is mainly brought out by Minnie 
(Una O'Connor), the household maid, along with the outrageously 
effeminate acting of Ernest Thesiger, who plays the devilish Dr. Pretorius.
The immense interest in Bride of Frankenstein also stems from its 
portrayal of sexual relations, a portrayal that is considered by many to 
be at least potentially transgressive. The introduction of a second mad 
scientist (Pretorius), who forces Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein to 
give life again, emphasizes one of the fundamental and disturbing 
implications of Shelley's myth: (pro)creation as something achieved by 
men alone. Four years later, Whale's masterpiece itself gave birth to a 
"son," but the father of the bride would have nothing to do with it.  FL

A quintessential swashbuckling adventure directed by expert Michael 
Curtiz, Captain Blood made divinely attractive Australian Errol Flynn a 
star overnight. His animal magnetism hugely impressed Jack Warner, 
who handed him this break when Robert Donat disdained the role. The 
film marks the first pairing in a string of winning romantic costume 
pictures of Flynn with Olivia de Havilland, whose genteel prettiness was 
a charming foil for his exuberance and athletic sex appeal.
Flynn plays an honorable seventeenth-century Irish doctor, Peter 
Blood, unjustly sentenced to deportation to and slavery in the Caribbean, 
where he aims insolent barbs and suggestive glances at dainty mistress 
Arabella Bishop (de Havilland). Leading an escape he turns pirate, the 
vengeful scourge of the bounding main, and forms an uneasy alliance 
with dastardly French buccaneer Captain Levasseur (Basil Rathbone). 
Relations become strained when they fall out over booty and the captive 
beauty, Arabella, resulting in a duel to the death in the first of their 
famously thrilling screen sword fights. Captain Blood has everything you 
could want in a swashbuckler—sea battles and flashing blades, a 
dashing hero, an imperiled but plucky heroine, cutthroats, plumed hats, 
wrongs righted, fellows swinging like gymnasts from masts, and a 
rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. It is great fun.  AE

Top Hat  Mark Sandrich, 1935
There is no clear-cut classic among the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers 
musicals of the mid-1930s—all are mostly marvelous with crucial 
flaws—but Top Hat probably comes the closest. Its plot follows the 
series' basic formula: Fred instantly falls for Ginger, but a silly 
misunderstanding (here, she mistakes him for his married friend) stokes 
her hostility until the final moments.
The director is the underrated Mark Sandrich, whose impeccably 
superficial touch maximizes the swanky, syncopated slickness so 
essential to the series. The film's most famous number is "Top Hat," 
featuring fancy canework among Fred and a chorus of top-hatted gents, 
but the heart of Top Hat is its two great romantic duets, "Isn't It a Lovely 
Day" and "Cheek to Cheek," the first set on a London bandstand during 
a thunderstorm, the second beside the sparkling canals of RKO's goofily 
glossy Art Deco version of Venice. Such dances, with their progression 
from resistance to surrender, are Fred's main weapon in winning over 
Ginger, but it would be a mistake to read this process as simple sexual 
conquest. As Ginger's suppressed amusement makes clear, the two 
characters approach their respective roles of hot-to-trot and hard-to-get 
with playful irony, collaborating to prolong and intensify a deliciously 
elegant erotic game.  MR
Henry Hathaway's romantic drama remains one of the more bizarre 
American productions of the 1930s. A tale of love stymied by class 
divisions, it might have been just another studio potboiler, was it not for 
the curious twist facing the lovers in the film's final act.
Gogo and Mimsey are childhood sweethearts who are separated 
when the boy's mother dies. Despatched to England, Gogo grows up as 
Peter Ibbertson (Gary Cooper). A trained architect, Peter is hired to design 
a building for the Duke of Towers but instead embarks on an affair with 
his wife, only to find out that Mary (Ann Harding) is really Mimsey. The 
Duke discovers them together and, following a struggle, is killed by Peter 
in self-defense. A court sentences him to life in prison. But bars cannot 
separate Peter and Mary, who are reunited every night in their dreams.
Salvador Dalí may have made the biggest splash of any surrealist 
artist in Hollywood when he worked on Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), 
but Hathaway's film best channels the spirit of the movement. The early 
scenes are solid, with the leads convincing as a couple who were meant 
to be together. But there is no indication of the magnificent extended 
dream sequence that will follow Peter's incarceration. Described by André 
Breton as "a triumph of surrealist thought," Peter Ibbertson's unashamedly 
romantic sweep and sheer loopiness has few equals.  IHS

Modern Times was the last film in which Chaplin portrayed the character 
of the Little Tramp, which he had created in 1914 and which had brought 
him universal fame and affection. In the years between, the world had 
changed. When the Little Tramp was born, the nineteenth century was 
still close. In 1936, in the aftermath of the Great Depression, he confronted 
anxieties that are not so different from those of the twenty-first century—
poverty, unemployment, strikes and strike breakers, political intolerance, 
economic inequalities, the tyranny of the machine, and narcotics.
These were problems with which Chaplin had become acutely 
preoccupied in the course of an eighteen-month world tour in 1931-32, 
when he had observed the rise of nationalism and the social effects of 
the Depression, unemployment, and automation. In 1931, he declared 
to a newspaper interviewer, "Unemployment is the vital question. . . . 
Machinery should benefit mankind. It should not spell tragedy and 
throw it out of work." Exposing these problems to the searchlight of 
comedy, Chaplin transforms the Little Tramp into one of the millions 
working in factories throughout the world. He is first seen as a worker 
driven crazy by his monotonous, inhuman job on a conveyor belt and 
being used as a guinea pig to test a machine to feed workers as they 
perform their tasks. Exceptionally, the Little Tramp finds a companion in 
his battle with this new world—a young girl (Paulette Goddard) whose 
father has been killed in a strike and who joins forces with Chaplin. The 
two are neither rebels nor victims, wrote Chaplin, but "the only two live 
spirits in a world of automatons."
Conceived in four "acts," each one equivalent to one of his old two-
reel comedies, Modern Times shows Chaplin still at his unrivaled peak as 
a creator of visual comedy. By the time Modern Times was released, 
talking pictures had been established for almost a decade. Chaplin 
considered using dialogue and even prepared a script, but he finally 
recognized that the Little Tramp depended on silent pantomime. At one 
moment, though, his voice is heard, when, hired as a singing waiter, he 
improvises the song in a wonderful, mock-Italian gibberish.  DR

A song-and-dance fantasia, George Stevens's Swing Time is an 
audiovisual spectacle organized around a backstage musical. Certainly 
a high-water mark for the mid-1930s, the film is equally a tease of things 
to come in the combination of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
Assembled by legendary RKO producer Pandro S. Berman, Swing 
Time is the story of Lucky Garnett (Fred Astaire), a well-regarded hoofer 
engaged to the pleasant, though uninspiring, Margaret Watson (Betty 
Furness). When he's forced to secure a large dowry to continue with his 
betrothal, their matrimonial plans are put on hold so he can seek his 
fortune in New York City. Once there, he meets Penny (Ginger Rogers), 
his true love, and thereafter the film more or less works through various 
disturbances before allowing them to fall into one another's arms.
Naturally, there are several scenes of mistaken intent, a few nontragic 
plot turns, and a happy ending, despite brief periods of sorrow and 
hand-wringing. Yet the purpose of the film is undeniably the 
presentation of its musical numbers, several of which form part of the 
generic canon. Jerome Kern wrote the music, while Dorothy Fields 
provided most of the lyrics. Their combined efforts form the soundtrack's 
foundation, although the sheer energy, verve, and happy distraction of 
Astaire and Rogers is what makes every number shine with the addition 
of movement and tap shoes.
Highlights include Lucky's two solos in "The Way You Look Tonight," 
a nightclub standard, and "Never Gonna Dance," a sorrowfully ironic song 
given the actor's well-recognized talent for walking on air. Two duets 
expand the big-screen canvas in "Waltz in Swing Time" with Astaire and 
Rogers and, of course, their famous performance of "A Fine Romance." 
But the showstopper of the picture may well be "Bojangles of Harlem." 
Here, Lucky begins his performance from within an accompanying 
chorus while dressed in blackface. Definitely a nod to his training and 
heritage, if also an antiquated, possibly offensive bit of cultural history, 
the number builds to a climax of Astaire dancing in triplicate with rear-
projection versions of himself.  GC-Q

Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is the film that invented the screwball comedy 
and solidified director Frank Capra's vision of American life, with a support 
of small-town, traditional values against self-serving city sophistication.
Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) is a poet from rural Vermont whose 
life changes, and not for the better, when he suddenly inherits the estate 
of his multimillionaire uncle, whose New York lawyers (used to skimming 
funds for their own use) try to convince him to keep them on the payroll. 
But after several misadventures and a trip to Manhattan, Deeds is 
convinced that the money will do him no good and tries to give it away, 
intending to endow a rural commune for displaced farmers. The lawyers 
immediately take him to court, claiming he is insane, for no one in their 
right mind would give away so much money. Crucial to Deeds's eventual 
deliverance is Babe Bennett (Jean Arthur), a wisecracking reporter who 
first exploits the hick's naïveté in order to write scathing exclusives about 
the "Cinderella Man." Babe is transformed by Deeds's idealism, however, 
and her testimony sways the court in the poor man's favor.
Filled with bright comic moments (Deeds playing the tuba to clear 
his mind, feeding donuts to horses), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is a hymn 
to antimaterialism and the simple country life in the best manner of 
Henry David Thoreau.  RBP

As one of the masters of sophisticated salon comedies, Gregory La Cava 
might not have had the most aching social consciousness in 1930s 
Hollywood. But he had a knack for satire with a social and political edge 
that is clearly visible in films such as Gabriel over the White House (1933), 
She Married Her Boss (1935), and especially My Man Godfrey, his most 
memorable work. Made at the end of the Depression era, this screwball 
classic deals with poor bum Godfrey (William Powell) being hired as a 
butler as part of a high-society party game on Park Avenue. Some 
hundred snappy lines later he has taken complete control over the rich 
people's house, charmed the beautiful Irene (Carole Lombard), exposed 
her birdbrained mother's boy toy (well, he is called "protégé" because of 
the Production Code) as a con man, and helped her grumpy father avoid 
bankruptcy and prison for fraud.
Not surprisingly, it is revealed that Godfrey himself had only been 
slumming as a hobo when the rich party found him, and so he can 
marry the socialite of his dreams. However, by then the upper class have 
been paraded in front of the camera as a bunch of narcissistic, infantile 
idiots. No doubt this was one reason for the film's great success with a 
mass audience in those days. My Man Godfrey loses some of its bite in 
the second half, when the fairy-tale ingredient takes over and ends the 
film on a silly note: that money is not everything! But even then it 
manages to captivate its audience by the sheer intelligence of its witty 
screenplay penned by novelist Eric Hatch and Morrie Ryskind. It has 
the true mark of a great film by not having a single bad line or weak 
character. La Cava's pacing is sometimes strikingly fast, delivering 
machine-gun tongue dueling in virtually every scene and applying a 
narrative economy so effortless that the film could serve as a prototype 
for classic Hollywood cinema. Though it premiered nearly seventy years 
ago, My Man Godfrey still holds up in a remarkable way and could easily 
be remade for any audience.  MT

Le roman d'un tricheur  Sacha Guitry, 1936
The Story of a Cheat
129
Widely regarded as Sacha Guitry's masterpiece (though it has 
competition in 1937's Pearls of the Crown), this 1936 tour de force can be 
regarded as a kind of concerto for the writer-director-performer's 
special brand of brittle cleverness. After a credits sequence that 
introduces us to the film's cast and crew, The Story of a Cheat settles into 
a flashback account of how the title hero (played by Guitry himself) 
learned to benefit from cheating over the course of his life.
A notoriously anticinematic moviemaker whose first love was 
theater, Guitry nevertheless had a flair for cinematic antics when it came 
to adapting his plays (or in this case his novel Memoires d'un Tricheur) 
to film. The Story of a Cheat registers as a rather lively and stylishly 
inventive silent movie, with Guitry's character serving as offscreen 
lecturer. François Truffaut was sufficiently impressed to dub Guitry a 
French brother of Ernst Lubitsch, though Guitry clearly differs from this 
master of continental romance in the way his own personality invariably 
overwhelms that of his characters.  JS
Camille  George Cukor, 1936
George Cukor's Camille is one of the triumphs of early sound cinema, a 
showcase of superb acting from principals Greta Garbo and Robert 
Taylor, with able support from studio stalwarts Lionel Barrymore and 
Henry Daniell. Cukor evokes just enough of mid-nineteenth-century 
Paris to render affecting the melodramatic stylization of what is perhaps 
the most famous popular play ever written, adapted for the stage by 
Alexandre Dumas, fils, from his sensational novel. With its witty and 
suggestive dialogue, the script makes the novelist's characters come 
alive for an American audience of another era.
Marguerite Gautier (Garbo), called Camille because of her love for 
the camellia, is a "courtesan" who falls in love with her "companion," 
Armand Duval (Taylor), scion of an influential family. Their relationship, 
which can never be legitimized because of her dubious background, 
must come to an end and does so in two famous scenes that actresses 
have always relished. First, Armand's father persuades Camille that she 
must give him up so that he can pursue a diplomatic career. 
Heartbroken, she dismisses Armand with the lie that he no longer 
interests her. Armand returns later to find her on her deathbed, where 
she expires while he weeps uncontrollably. The Breen Office, charged

William Cameron Menzies' screen version of H.G. Wells's speculations 
about the world's future after a disastrous second World War destroys 
European civilization is perhaps the first true science-fiction film. Only 
Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) anticipates its envisioning of the future as 
a result of technological change and resulting political evolution, but 
Lang's film doesn't offer a similarly detailed analysis of the new course 
history might take. In fact, few science-fiction movies are as concerned 
as is Things to Come with a rigorously historical approach to fictionalized 
prophecy, and this is perhaps because Wells himself penned the screenplay, 
based on ideas found in his popular tome The Outline of History.
Neither Wells nor Menzies took much interest in character-driven 
narrative (the main characters all represent important ideas), and so the 
film has seemed distant and uninvolving to many, an effect exacerbated 
by the fact that the story covers a full century of history. The second 
European war lasts twenty-five years and manages to destroy most of 
the world, which regresses to something like the cutthroat feudalism of 
the early Middle Ages. But human progress is inevitable, thanks to the 
fact that the intellectual and rational element in man always proves 
superior to the innate human urge toward self-destruction. Things to Come 
thus offers a more optimistic twist on Freud's understanding of the 
conflict between Eros and Thanatos, love and death, in human affairs. 
The film's later sequences, as in Metropolis, are dominated by a vision 
of the city of the future. It was in his handling of these architectural and 
art-design aspects of the film that Menzies made his most significant 
and telling contribution. Despite its episodic narrative, Things to Come 
is visually spectacular, a predecessor of other science-fiction films that 
imagine the urban future, including Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982).
Despite the presence of well-known actors, what is most memorable 
about this unusual film is its engagement with a philosophy of history 
and of human nature. It captures the anxieties and hopes of 1930s 
Britain perfectly, chillingly forecasting the blitz that would descend upon 
London only four years after its release.  RBP

William Wyler's compelling adaptation of Sinclair Lewis's novel about the 
dissolution of a wealthy American couple's marriage represents the 
height of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking. Walter Huston plays the title 
character, an automobile mogul, who, after selling his business, must 
face the challenges of an opulent retirement and decides to take a grand 
tour of Europe with his wife, Fran (Ruth Chatterton). They leave the United 
States to discover continental culture and refinement. In Europe, the two 
discover that each wants something different from life, though in their 
own ways both want to stave off old age. Fran becomes involved in 
flirtations with playboys who roam the periphery of the rich and 
fashionable set. She becomes increasingly impatient with Dodsworth's 
stubbornly American, provincial ways. Dodsworth cannot reconcile with 
Fran and desperately fears becoming useless. On the journey they meet 
Edith Cortright (Mary Astor), an American expatriate who has found a new 
way to live and remain vibrant, and who can offer Dodsworth a solution.
The most remarkable aspects of the film are its moral complexity and 
its bittersweet tone. Wyler takes care not to portray Fran wholly as the 
villain; we are made to understand and sympathize with both husband 
and wife. Some of the most poignant moments of Dodsworth take place 
when Fran sees the illusory life that she has been trying to create fall 
apart around her. At a time when mainstream American filmmaking all 
seems to be aimed at the tastes of fourteen-year-old boys, Dodsworth is 
a welcome reminder that Hollywood once made films for adults.  RH

One of the most powerful and unsettling devices in film fiction is the 
"years later" epilogue, which usually takes us, with wistful sadness, 
from the concentrated time of a story in which everything was briefly 
possible, to the singular destiny that ensued. At the end of Jean 
Renoir's A Day in the Country, Henriette (Sylvia Bataille) is seen unhappily 
married to the man with whom she was betrothed at the start, the 
gormless clerk Anatole (Paul Temps). But in between these points, 
nothing is so fixed or certain.
Adapted from the story of the same name by Guy de Maupassant, 
the film was unfinished in the form originally envisaged by Renoir. It 
stands, however, as a self-sufficient gem. Its central action is devoted 
to the illicit pairing off of two local adventurers, Rodolphe (Jacques 
Borel) and Henri (Georges D'Arnoux), with Henriette and her mother, 
Juliette (Jeanne Marken). Renoir constructs a superb diagram of 
contrasts between these characters: Rodolphe and Juliette are lusty and 
frivolous, while Henri and Henriette are overwhelmed by grave emotion. 
So what started, in Henriette's words, as "a sort of vague desire" that calls 
forth both the beauty and harshness of nature, ends badly, as the "years 
pass, with Sundays as melancholy as Mondays."  AM
Pépé le Moko was the film that consolidated Jean Gabin's stardom and 
defined his on-screen persona as a tough, streetwise character, outwardly 
cynical but with an underlying romantic streak that will cause his downfall. 
As Pépé, an expatriate French hood who has become top dog in the 
Casbah (the Arab quarter of Algiers), he relishes his power but yearns 
nostalgically for Paris. When a beautiful French tourist (Mireille Balin), the 
embodiment of his longed-for homeland, catches his eye, the temptation 
becomes too great. But once outside the Casbah he's vulnerable because 
there a tireless policeman (Lucas Gridoux) lies in wait.
Director Julien Duvivier's skill at evoking atmosphere creates a vivid 
(if romanticized) vision of the Casbah, an exotic labyrinth of twisting 
alleyways full of pungent detail. Borrowing motifs from the classic 
Hollywood gangster movies, but seasoning them with doomy Gallic 
romanticism, Pépé le Moko prefigures film noir. Images of bars, grilles, 
and fences recur throughout the film, underlining Pépé's entrapment 
within his little fiefdom. The movie is pervaded by a mood of longing, 
of lost youthful dreams, and of desires that can never be fulfilled. This 
fatalism led to its being banned during the war by the Vichy regime, 
but its warm reception after this temporary absence only confirmed 
its status as a classic.  PK

Pépé le Moko  Julien Duvivier, 1937

In this one-of-a-kind masterpiece by one of the greatest American 
directors, Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi play Bark and Lucy Cooper, an 
elderly couple faced with financial disaster and forced to throw themselves 
on the mercy of their middle-aged children. The children's first step is to 
separate the two of them so that the inconvenience of hosting them can 
be divided. Gradually, the old people's self-confidence and dignity are 
eroded, until they submit to an arrangement whereby one of them will 
stay in a nursing home in New York, and the other will go to California.
Leo McCarey's direction in Make Way for Tomorrow is beyond praise. 
All of the actors are expansive and natural, and the generosity McCarey 
shows toward his characters is unstinting. He demonstrates an exquisite 
sense of when to cut from his central couple to reveal the attitudes of 
others, without suggesting either that their compassion is condescending 
or that their indifference is wicked, and without forcing our tears or rage 
(which would be a way of forfeiting them). There is nothing contrived 
about McCarey's handling of the story, and thus no escaping its poignancy.
Two examples will suffice to indicate the film's extraordinary 
discretion. During the painful sequence in which Lucy's presence 
inadvertently interferes with her daughter-in-law's attempt to host a 
bridge party, Lucy receives a phone call from Bark. Because she talks 
loudly on the phone—one of several annoying traits that McCarey and 
screenwriter Viña Delmar don't hesitate to give the elderly couple—the 
guests pause in their games to listen. Their reactions (not emphasized, 
but merely shown) mix annoyance, discomfort, and sorrow.
The last section of the film, dealing with the couple's brief reuniting 
and impromptu last idyll in Manhattan, is sublime. McCarey keeps us 
aware of the sympathy of outsiders (a car salesman, a coat-check girl, 
a hotel manager, a bandleader), but never imposes their reactions on 
us through superfluous reverse shots. Meanwhile, Lucy and Bark are 
constantly shown together in the same compositions. In its passionate 
commitment to their private universe, Make Way for Tomorrow is truly, 
deeply moving.  CFu

Sometimes it takes the horrors of war to reveal the things we all have in 
common. That humanistic irony is the central conceit of Jean Renoir's 
masterpiece La Grand Illusion, a film set during World War I that finds 
levity and fraternity in a German POW camp. Lieutenant Maréchal (Jean 
Gabin) and Captain de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay) are two French officers 
making the best of their situation with their men, under the watchful 
eye of the polite German commandant von Rauffenstein (Erich von 
Stroheim). They've developed a mirror image of aristocratic society based 
on honor and order, a system of mutual respect and protocol based on 
years of tradition.
But it's only an oasis—or, more specifically, a mirage—in the midst 
of devastating conflict, hence the title of the film: The grand illusion is 
that somehow class and upbringing sets these officers above the 
commonness of war, when in fact bullets don't know one bloodline from 
another. They tirelessly dig an escape tunnel without considering that 
once they return to freedom, the false camaraderie encouraged by 
incarceration will once again revert to the harsh realities of life.
One of the most poignant aspects of La Grand Illusion is the feeling 
that the central characters understand this truth all too well yet 
subconsciously wish things could be different. You can sense that von 
Stroheim's melancholy commandant really wishes he were socializing 
with the French officers under different, less severe circumstances. In the 
POW camp, Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio) is one of the guys. On the outside, 
he's just a Jew, a jarring reminder of the imminent evils of World War II. 
In fact, the Germans later banned La Grand Illusion during their eventual 
occupation of France, so effective was its ever timely humanistic vision. 
That Renoir's remarkable film, with all its memorable characters, thought-
provoking themes, and engaging dialogue, could have been lost forever 
because of its political viewpoint is a pointed reminder of the power of 
cinema and the ability of fiction to convey the kind of profound truths 
and moral guidelines that we use and need to direct our lives.  JKl

Stella Dallas  King Vidor, 1937
135
Stella Dallas offers a lively portrait of a working-class woman strong enough 
to sacrifice herself for her daughter's advancement. Olive Higgins Prouty's 
novel had been filmed successfully in 1925. But unlike Henry King's silent 
version, Vidor's has the advantage of Barbara Stanwyck in the title role.
Stanwyck plays Stella as a resilient, glamorous, intelligent woman. 
It's easy to understand why well-to-do Stephen Dallas (John Boles) 
finds her attractive. Not long after the birth of their daughter Laurel 
(Anne Shirley), however, he wants to return to his former girlfriend. Stella 
raises Laurel on her own, but as a teenager Laurel finds herself attracted 
to her father's more affluent lifestyle and wants to live with him. Stella 
relents, forcing her daughter to leave by pretending to be drunk and no 
longer interested in the young woman's company. Laurel decamps to 
her father's house and is soon married to a socialite at a huge wedding 
that her mother glimpses, tears streaming down her face, through a 
window from the street. Never again will she cross the social divide 
separating her from Laurel. A moving and heartfelt story, under Vidor's able 
direction Stella Dallas never descends into mawkish sentimentality.  RBP
Ye ban ge sheng  Ma-Xu Weibang, 1937
Midnight Song
Gaston Leroux's 1919 novel The Phantom of the Opera gave rise to a score 
of films. Ma-Xu Weibang's Midnight Song is unarguably one of the most 
inspired. It establishes its dark and eerie mood from the start, with the 
arrival of a touring opera company at a dilapidated theater, which they 
learn has been empty and crumbling since the apparent death there of 
the great opera star Song Danping, ten years before. The company's young 
star is rehearsing alone in the theater when he hears a beautiful voice, 
which coaches him through his song. It is the fugitive Song Danping, now 
dreadfully disfigured, who relates his tragic story, shown in flashback. 
His physical state was inflicted on him on the orders of an evil feudal lord, 
angry at Song's love for his daughter. Since then he has hidden in the 
theater, awaiting a singer who can assume his mantle and perform his 
great operatic creation. The young singer is chosen and also made envoy 
to Song's lost love, Li Xiaoxia, whose mind has broken from sorrow. The 
difference from Western versions of Leroux is that the Phantom, instead of 
being a lurking menace, becomes a sympathetic, benevolent protagonist.
All this is staged in richly atmospheric settings, with a masterly use 
of light and shadow clearly inspired by German Expressionist cinema. An 
important element in the film's immense popularity were the songs, which 
have remained popular standards in China. In 1941, Ma-Xu was obliged to 
make a sequel, Midnight Song II, and the film has also inspired two Hong 
Kong remakes, Mid-Nightmare (1962) and The Phantom Lover (1995).  DR

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs begins with a slow zoom to a huge 
castle, where the wicked Queen queries her magic mirror with the 
immortal words, "Magic mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?" 
The answer, of course, is her virginal rival, Snow White, soon to be the 
target of her vanity. Like the classic Brothers Grimm story Snow White is 
based on, you are instantly pulled into this magical and sometime scary 
world. Yet at the time Hollywood considered Walt Disney's first foray 
into full-length feature animation something of a folly. Who would sit 
through a ninety-minute animated film?
Needless to say, Snow White answered that rhetorical question by 
becoming one of the biggest hits in the history of cinema, solidifying 
Disney's claim as the world's foremost animation studio. Walt Disney had 
already broken the cartoon sound barrier with Steamboat Willy in 1928, 
and a few years later brought animation into vivid color. Snow White was 
merely the next step forward both artistically as well as financially: 
feature films meant more box-office sales.
Using the Brothers Grimm story as inspiration, Disney unleashed his 
team of animators on the material, giving them a great deal of freedom 
in the development of such a creative breakthrough. The film is peppered 
with gags but also filled with emotion, comprising a soaring combination 
of beautiful images and strong, enduring songs like "Whistle While You 
Work" and "Some Day My Prince Will Come." Snow White, incidentally, also 
marked the first commercially released soundtrack.
There is no way to overestimate the effect of Snow White. It not 
only permanently established Disney as one of the foremost studios in 
the world but also advanced the state of animation to such a degree 
that it wasn't really until the advent of computer animation that anyone 
arguably pushed the form further. A creative triumph, Snow White 
inspired hundreds of imitators, gave birth to an empire, and remains to 
this day the default template for nearly all animated features.  JKl

Rudyard Kipling, who died in 1936, did not live long enough to see 
three of his books adapted for the screen the following year, including 
Victor Fleming's rousing childhood epic Captains Courageous. Freddie 
Bartholomew stars as Harvey Cheyne, a spoiled rich kid who, after 
drinking six ice cream sodas, falls off the ocean liner on which he and his 
father (Melvyn Douglas) are traveling. He has the good fortune to be 
picked up by a fishing boat out of Gloucester, whose crew, including the 
good-natured Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy), is unimpressed by his 
wealth and "position." Humiliated, Harvey is left to his own resources, 
but under Manuel's careful tutelage he learns the value of hard work and 
real accomplishment. Before they can return to port, however, Manuel 
dies in an accident. In port, Harvey is met by his father yet wants to stay 
with the fishermen, but after a moving memorial for his dead friend, 
father and son are reconciled.
Child star Bartholomew is excellent in a role that requires him to be 
both obnoxious and irresistible. And Spencer Tracy, his hair curled and 
face brown with makeup, does an excellent imitation of a Portuguese 
sailor. With humor, pathos, and an interesting moral, this is one of the 
best children's movies Hollywood ever produced.  RBP

The legend of Leo McCarey's The Awful Truth is that it was largely 
improvised from day to day. This legend is perfectly in tune with the 
ethos of the film itself, in which spontaneity, playfulness, the ability to 
laugh at one's own "act" (as well as to see it with the eye of the person 
who is seeing right through you at that moment) are so central to its 
glorious, warm sense of humor as well as its exploration of how to make 
marriage work.
But the script structure, however it was arrived at, is satisfying. It 
starts with a rupture: Jerry (Cary Grant) and Lucy (Irene Dunne), 
believing they have caught each other in infidelities, lies, and—worst of 
all—a lack of trust, decide to divorce. It takes half the film, covering 
Lucy's flirtation with Dan (Ralph Bellamy), for her to realize she still loves 
Jerry. But then it's his turn to hook up with someone, a "madcap 
heiress." Once all these bets are off, the story becomes a road movie 
leading to a cabin in the woods—with two beds, and thirty minutes 
left before the divorce decree becomes final.
McCarey perfects every ingredient of the romantic comedy here, 
from the opposition of New Yorkers and Southerners, to the role of 
games, songs, and dances as ways of sorting out the characters' 
affections and allegiances. Full of splendid minor characters and 
inspired bits of business, The Awful Truth also has a heartbreakingly 
serious moment when Jerry and Lucy remember their unofficial 
marriage vow ("This comes from the heart, I'll always adore you").
Of all the great movies, this may be the one that most resists 
description in words. This has much to do with its small jokes of subtle 
verbal delivery, where ordinary phrases are transformed by timing, 
rhythm, and tone, from Lucy's defensively repeated "had better go" and 
Jerry's stumbling on "Tulsa" to Dan's exasperated "Mom!" via the black 
servant's reaction to Jerry's fake tan: "You're looking weellll." Above all, 
the film is a monument to the sheer, magical lovability of its stars.  AM

The Life of Émile Zola  William Dieterle, 1937
139
William Dieterle's The Life of Émile Zola was a follow-up to his highly 
successful biopic The Story of Louis Pasteur (1935), with actor Paul Muni 
in another story about a Frenchman of principle and enlightenment 
overcoming prejudice. At the beginning Zola struggles to establish 
himself as a writer, until the publication of Nana, his sensational novel 
about a prostitute. Success follows success, and Zola is set to enjoy a 
prosperous old age when he is visited by the wife of Alfred Dreyfus, a 
French army officer falsely accused of spying for the Germans and sent 
to Devil's Island. Zola's conscience is pricked and, in a big set piece 
tailor-made for Muni, he reads out his famous article "J'Accuse" to a 
newspaper editor. In a typical Warner Brothers montage sequence, the 
newspaper staff gather around to listen, presses spew out the article, 
and people rush to buy the paper.
The film won an Oscar for Best Picture and its underlying seriousness 
is impressive. Yet though Dreyfus was the victim of anti-Semitic 
prejudice, not once in The Life of Émile Zola is the word "Jew" uttered. 
Evidently, Warner Brothers feared that in 1937, with the rising tide of 
anti-Semitism in Europe, pictures about anti-Jewish feeling would 
inflame the very prejudices they were designed to expose.  EB
Jezebel  William Wyler, 1938
Hollywood's second most famous portrayal of a spoiled Southern belle, 
Jezebel offered Bette Davis the perfect vehicle to display her acting 
talents in a breakthrough role. Davis plays Julie Marsden, who is the 
most sought-after debutante in 1850s New Orleans, a society ruled by 
rigid codes of behavior that the young woman finds confining. 
Engaged to Preston Dillard (Henry Fonda), Julie does not sever her 
relationship to Buck Cantrell (George Brent), an honorable Southern 
gentleman and the story's most sympathetic figure. Soon after, Preston 
leaves New Orleans to travel north, where he works; when he comes 
back to the city, he is married to another woman. In her petulance, Julie 
causes a duel in which Buck is killed, and she becomes a pariah, even 
to her own family. But then she redeems herself through heroic self-
sacrifice during a yellow fever outbreak, when she accompanies the 
desperately ill Preston to the miserable island where victims of the 
disease are confined.
William Wyler makes use of a lavish budget and meticulous art 
design in this intriguing evocation of the period. Much more of a

The Adventures of Robin Hood  
Michael Curtiz & William Keighley, 1938
Whether considered as a swashbuckler, a costume romance, or a 
mockery of history, The Adventures of Robin Hood is simply the best 
production of its kind ever made. With King Richard on the Crusades, 
the kingdom is ruled by his rotten brother John, played by Claude 
Rains as a waspish tyrant who overhears groans from a torture chamber 
and muses, "Ah, more complaints about the new taxes from our Saxon 
friends." John's less amusing but more deadly sidekick, Sir Guy of 
Gisbourne, is incarnated with razor-profiled malice by the unmatchably 
ruthless Basil Rathbone.
The fairest lady in the land is Marian, an impossibly lovely Olivia de 
Havilland in Technicolor flesh tones. But it's dispossessed outlaw Robin 
of Locksley who brings life to this court of intrigue, with Errol Flynn's 
jaunty goatee and Tasmanian twinkle making Robin a rare hero who 
can be a light-hearted trickster one moment but spin on a knife-point 
to become a determined rebel ("Norman or Saxon, what's that matter? 
It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.") and a balcony-climbing romantic.
It is truly amazing how fast-paced and jam-packed this movie is: the 
story is as complicated as a Shakespearean comedy; there's a real 
delight in the sword-clashing and arrow-shooting battles, and it ends 
as all stories should—with good triumphant and lovers united.  KN
Angels with Dirty Faces  Michael Curtiz, 1938
Michael Curtiz's films preach social responsibility, and Angels with Dirty 
Faces is his most powerful sermon. Rocky and Jerry, two pals from a 
tough New York neighborhood, grow up to be a notorious gangster 
(James Cagney) and crusading priest (Pat O'Brien), respectively. A gang 
of teenagers idolize Rocky, until Father Jerry urges his condemned friend 
to "go yellow" at his execution. In keeping with its didactic mission, the 
film's visual and performing styles are emphatic and crisp to the point 
of caricature. In fact, Cagney's performance here, all cocky swagger and 
hitched-up shoulders, provided the primary model for impressionists 
such as Frank Gorshin and Rich Little.
Curtiz may be a moralizer, but he is not a facile one. Rocky's final 
capitulation is a tough pill to swallow, and the director does not 
sugarcoat it. Rocky is a charismatic rebel, and Father Jerry is a 
sanctimonious nag, but the film leaves little doubt which choice serves 
the greater good. The harrowing climax, a nightmare of gruesome 
details and expressionist shadows as Rocky is dragged whimpering to 
the electric chair, still has the power to enrage viewers who do not share 
the film's stern moral viewpoint, but, for Father Mike, such attitudes are 
sentimental at best and irresponsible at worst. Amen.  MR

1938
Orson Welles thought that Raimu was one of the greatest actors of his 
time; The Baker's Wife proves him right. Directed by Marcel Pagnol from 
a short story by Jean Giono, this is the tale of Aimable Castanier, a 
middle-aged baker (Raimu) in a small Provençal village. When his young 
wife Aurélie (Ginette Leclerc) deserts him for a handsome shepherd, the 
distraught baker stops baking and without bread the village comes to a 
halt. Catholic priest, left-wing teacher, lord of the manor, and all the 
villagers forget their old feuds and gang up to bring back the errant wife. 
Life resumes happily.
From such simple material Pagnol fashioned a comic gem and a 
humanist masterpiece. With his regular troupe of actors—Raimu, Fernand 
Charpin, Robert Vattier, and others—Pagnol animates a galaxy of characters 
that is both funny and touching. His light touch and the actors' talents 
transcend the crude stereotypes (womanizing aristocrat, pedantic teacher, 
cantankerous old maid, cuckolded husband), creating a world in which 
each has his or her own clearly defined role. Giono and Pagnol's Provence 
is conservative and patriarchal (the wife does not have much of a say), 
but it is a world in which shared fundamental values—here represented 
by bread, both a Christian and pagan symbol—cement social cohesiveness.
Raimu's towering performance effortlessly alternates comic theatricality 
with minimalist realism, turning his comic cuckold into a tragic hero. 
Raimu, from the South of France himself, was a superlative stage actor, 
at ease with the florid language and emphatic delivery of the Marseilles 
vernacular. His filmic modernity, however, came from his ability to switch 
within seconds to understated moments, giving them extraordinary 
emotional impact, as illustrated by the film's most famous scene. As the 
repentant wife returns, Raimu welcomes her back as if nothing had 
happened and instead takes it out on a surrogate, the straying female 
cat "Pomponnette," in the most vivid and affecting terms. In this moment 
of contrived high comedy I defy anyone to remain dry-eyed. It may be 
called The Baker's Wife, but it is definitely Raimu's film.  GV

Bringing Up Baby, the definitive screwball comedy, was the first film 
Howard Hawks made in a six-picture contract with RKO in 1937. 
Unpromisingly based on a short story about a young couple and their 
tamed leopard, the shoot went forty days over schedule and over budget. 
It earned so little upon its release in 1938 that Hawks was fired from RKO 
and Katherine Hepburn had to buy herself out of her own contract. 
Ahead of its time, its amazing breakneck pace and disarmingly witty 
dialogue set new standards for all such comedies thereafter.
At his whimsical best, Cary Grant is Dr. David Huxley, a handsome and 
easily distracted paleontologist who spends his days piecing together a 
brontosaurus skeleton while he is taken apart by his nagging fiancée. 
With one more bone to go before the four-year museum project will be 
complete, Huxley manages to bumble an important meeting on the golf 
course with a wealthy potential patron. There, Huxley meets Susan 
Vance (Hepburn). As beautiful and scatterbrained as he is, she steals his 
golf ball; after that, Huxley's world never snaps back into place. Trying 
anything to keep him from marrying another girl, Vance uses Baby, the 
house-trained pet leopard sent to her by her brother in South America, 
as a worthy Huxley diversion. By the time the family dog buries Huxley's 
precious dinosaur bone, the couple is headed to jail.
The laughs in Bringing Up Baby are real, almost completely disguising 
its deft analyses of 1930s-style gender expectations, sex, and marriage. 
So suspicious was the censor of the script's deeper and possibly sexual 
meanings that Huxley's quest to find his "lost bone" was queried as a 
reference to lost masculinity. The scene where Huxley dons Vance's 
feathery feminine bathrobe didn't help dissuade that notion, containing 
as it does one of the first popular appearances of the word "gay" being 
used to mean something other than "extremely happy." The critics may 
have hated it, the audiences may have stayed away, and Oscar didn't smile 
upon it at the time, but Bringing Up Baby has had the last laugh on all its 
detractors. It remains one of the true masterpieces of celluloid wit.  KK

Leni Riefenstahl's epic documentary of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin 
is sometimes criticized for its politics. Sponsored by Hitler, the film does 
contain sequences that seem to support the notion of "Aryan" superiority. 
Still, the filmmaker did receive a gold medal for her efforts from the 
Olympic Committee in 1948, long after Hitler's dream of a thousand-year 
Reich had disintegrated. This is not to deny that Olympia is a piece of 
propaganda; Riefenstahl would never have received the funding and 
support needed if the result had not been politically useful. In many ways, 
though, Olympia transcends politics. Overall, it is more a hymn of praise 
to athletic prowess and to the poetry of the human body in motion.
Riefenstahl's aesthetic interest in physical form and motion and her 
feat in making this documentary have never been duplicated. Filming 
the games and supervising the immense task of postproduction would 
take a Herculean effort today. In the late 1930s, the job was done with 
primitive equipment. Despite its overtly political message, the film is an 
artistic triumph, evidence not only of Riefenstahl's personal talent and 
vision, but also of the energies and expertise of her hundreds of assistants.
Huge preparation was necessary. Steel camera towers were built in 
the stadium, platforms made for tracking shots, and Germany scoured for 
the best talent. Nearly 250 hours of film was shot, and the task of editing 
was personally supervised by Riefenstahl. The final version is masterfully 
paced, with sublime matched cuts and just enough variation in repetitive 
events to sustain visual interest. Riefenstahl's protestations of political 
innocence may be unconvincing, but Olympia does have another and 
more enduring side. Simply put, it is the most moving cinematic record 
of human sport and physical competition ever produced.  RBP

The Lady Vanishes  Alfred Hitchcock, 1938
The Lady Vanishes ranks alongside The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935) as one of 
Hitchcock's best British sound films. Aided in no small part by a sparkling 
script that is mined for all its comic value by a sterling ensemble of British 
actors, Hitchcock produced a gem of a trans-European thriller.
When the elderly Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) suddenly disappears 
on a train traveling across continental Europe, beautiful young heiress 
Iris (Margaret Lockwood) suspects foul play. Engaging the help of Gilbert 
(Michael Redgrave), a musicologist apparently oblivious to his traveling 
companion's beauty, Iris uncovers the real identity of the missing woman 
and a plot that will throw Europe into the chaos of war.
As with Hitchcock's greatest adventures, the details of what is at stake 
are always less interesting than the journey to uncover them. The 
chemistry between the leads is palpable, allowing us to savor the thaw 
between them as they realize the seemingly insurmountable forces they 
face. But Launder and Gilliat's script truly shines in bringing to life every 
character, no matter how minor; best are Charters (Basil Radford) and 
Caldicott (Naunton Wayne), two cricket-obsessed fanatics.
The action rattles along at a fair pace, and although it lacks the 
memorable scenes of his Richard Hannay adventure, the success of The 
Lady Vanishes secured Hitchcock a lucrative Hollywood contract.  IHS
William Wyler's film version of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights is 
unsurpassed as a gothic tale of inextinguishable passion, thwarted by 
social circumstance and mischance. A lonely traveler, Dr. Kenneth 
(Donald Crisp), making his way across the moors of northern England, 
spends the night at Wuthering Heights, where an aged servant tells him 
the tragic story of Heathcliff (Laurence Olivier), the house's current 
owner. A gypsy waif, he had been adopted by the Earnshaws and raised 
with their own two children. Heathcliff is the constant companion of 
young Cathy (Merle Oberon), whose snobbish brother Hindley (Hugh 
Williams) scorns him. Wealthy neighbor Edgar Linton (David Niven) falls 
in love with Cathy, and she dismisses Heathcliff, who goes to America. 
Cathy forgets him and ends up marrying Edgar. Heathcliff returns to 
England a rich man but, furious at Cathy's betrayal, marries Edgar's sister 
(Geraldine Fitzgerald), mistreating the poor woman as a means of 
getting revenge. Cathy is miserable with Edgar and falls ill, but before 
she dies the former lovers are briefly united.
Heathcliff's speech about the life they will live together is one of the 
most poignant moments in any Hollywood film. It is the acting of Olivier 
and Oberon as the doomed lovers, framed against the forbidding wildness 
of the studio-crafted moors, that makes the film most memorable.  RBP

Wuthering Heights  William Wyler, 1939

Frank Capra's hymn of praise to the American system of government was 
considered so incisive in its indictment of special-interest corruption that 
some in Washington thought Mr. Smith Goes to Washington should not 
be released into a world on the verge of war. To show that the system 
works, however, Capra must demonstrate how it can correct itself. 
Republicanism (not democracy) is saved in the film by the heroic efforts 
of a stubborn idealist, who, in the best tradition of the Jeffersonian 
individualism for which he is named, refuses to go along with party 
bosses, who plot his ruin. Ashamed, the smooth-talking machine politician 
assigned to discredit him publicly confesses the plot.
Jimmy Stewart is perfect as Jefferson Smith, whose chief qualification 
is that he is hopelessly unsophisticated, a man who spends all his time 
mentoring a troop of young "rangers." But this rube is neither stupid nor 
lacking in courage. Smith first convinces the cynical woman (Jean Arthur) 
charged with looking after him of his virtue and his keen sense. And then, 
after unintentionally creating trouble by proposing a national boys' camp 
on the precise site that the "machine" hopes to use for its pork barrel 
project, he defends himself against false charges in a filibuster that goes 
on for many hours and leaves him barely able to speak or stand. Crucial 
in Smith's passage from irrelevance through disgrace to vindication is 
the part played by Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). As opposed to 
the crudely venal political boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), Paine is a 
man who believes in the American system but who has been seduced 
by a politics of compromise and deal making. Smith can only be rescued 
by Paine's conversion. Smith's deliverance is also made possible by 
the peculiarly American institution of the filibuster, which permits the 
individual—symbolically enough, not the group—unlimited free speech 
according to established rules. Smith can thereby exert a power against 
the group that would condemn him, insuring his vindication.
Capra's film is full of memorable moments, the most moving of which 
is the montage sequence tracing the newly arrived senator's tour of 
Washington monuments, including the Lincoln Memorial.  RBP

Stagecoach  John Ford, 1939
The 1930s wasn't a great decade for the Western. After a few expensive 
flops such as The Big Trail (1930) and Cimarron (1931), the major studios 
largely abandoned the genre to Poverty Row producers making cheap 
B-movies. John Ford hadn't made a Western for a dozen years when he 
cast John Wayne and Claire Trevor in a story about a stagecoach ride 
through dangerous Indian territory. In trying to sell it to producer 
David O. Selznick, Ford described Stagecoach as a "classic Western," a 
cut above the B-Westerns that Wayne himself had been making. One 
thing this meant was giving it more appeal to women in the audience. 
So Ford and screenwriter Dudley Nichols added to the original story 
by Ernest Haycox a more developed love story and the birth of a baby. 
But this wasn't enough for Selznick, who looked down his nose and 
passed on the project.
Not that Stagecoach stints on the genre's more traditional 
satisfactions. The last part of the film packs in plenty of action, including 
a gunfight between Wayne and the Plummer gang and a stirring Indian 
attack as the stagecoach careers across the flat desert. The sequence was 
enriched by some superlative stunt work by Yakima Canutt, who, playing 
one of the Apache attackers, leaps onto one of the stage's horses, is shot, 
and has to fall between the horses' hooves and under the wheels.
This was Wayne's second chance at major stardom after the failure of 
The Big Trail, and he took it with both hands. From his first entrance, 
standing in the desert waving down the stage, he cuts an impressive 
figure as the Ringo Kid, who has busted out of jail in order to be revenged 
on the Plummers, killers of his father and brother. But Wayne's appearance 
is delayed while Ford explores the characters of the other travelers on 
the coach. Each is deftly and memorably sketched in: Dallas (Claire 
Trevor), the girl who is no better than she should be, and who is run out 
of town together with drunken Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) by the 
puritanical ladies of the Law and Order League; Peacock (Donald Meek), 
a timid whiskey salesman; Hatfield (John Carradine), a Southern gambler; 
Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt), the pregnant wife of a cavalry officer; and 
Gatewood (Berton Churchill), a banker who is making off with the assets. 
On the outside of the coach are Buck (Andy Devine), the portly driver, 
and Curly (George Bancroft), the local sheriff. The interaction between 
this oddly assorted group allows Ford to explore a cherished theme, the 
superior moral qualities of those whom "respectable" society disdains.
Stagecoach was the first film Ford shot in Monument Valley, a 
landscape of towering sandstone buttes on the border between Utah 
and Arizona. As the tiny coach makes its way through the vastness of 
the desert, the frailty of its occupants is doubly emphasized as the 
camera tracks toward a group of Indians observing its progress. Ford 
makes no attempt to present the Indians as individuals; they are merely 
a force of nature.  EB

Howard Hawks turned his attention to the manly cameraderie of 
dangerous professions (especially aviation) in earlier action pictures 
such as The Dawn Patrol (1930), The Crowd Roars (1932), and Ceiling 
Zero (1936). But this 1939 drama marks a transformation of his style, 
imprinting a personal stamp on a melodramatic genre to set the heroic-
comic-romantic tone he would later pursue in To Have and Have Not 
(1944), Rio Bravo (1959), and El Dorado (1966). Note the community 
sing-alongs, the in-group banter, the shared domestic chores, the 
nicknames and gossip, the wryly amusing streak of prissiness among 
tough guys, and the veneer of cynicism that masks honest sentiment.
There are remarkable, exciting, stunt-heavy flying sequences in Only 
Angels Have Wings, especially a very dangerous landing and takeoff on 
a high Andean plateau, but the meat of the film is on the ground, observing 
the cohesion of a disparate group that clusters around white-hat hero 
Geoff Carter (Cary Grant). Striding a head taller than his crew and looking 
every inch the star, Geoff runs an airmail service in South America, 
inspiring a group of traumatized veterans, fresh kids, and deadbeats to 
hop over the Andes in outmoded airplanes. Showgirl Bonnie Lee (Jean 
Arthur) is stranded at the airfield; at first appalled by the ostensibly macho 
attitudes of the pilots when one of their number is killed in a needless 
accident, she gradually comes to understand their sensitive side, 
eventually joining Geoff in a spirited rendition of "The Peanut Vendor."
At heart a tough soap opera, the film has a group of "damaged" 
people showing their worth in crises and cuts between funny, sassy, sexy 
dialogue exchanges on the ground and still-effective aerial action scenes. 
It also has a great supporting cast of familiar faces—Richard Barthelmess 
(trying to live down a reputation for cowardice because he bailed out of 
a crashing plane and left his engineer behind), Thomas Mitchell (an aging 
sidekick covering up his increasing blindness), Noah Beery Jr., Sig Rumann, 
and Rita Hayworth (as the sort of woman men shouldn't mess with but 
usually do). Catchphrases include "Calling Barranca" and "Who's Joe?"  KN

Like most comedy Westerns, George Marshall's Destry Rides Again is a 
satire on the conventions of manly heroism. Destry (played by James 
Stewart in his best "aw, shucks" manner), sheriff of the unruly town of 
Bottleneck, prefers milk to whiskey and refuses to carry a gun. This gives 
him a special appeal for saloon girl Frenchy, with Marlene Dietrich 
belatedly reprising the role that made her famous in The Blue Angel.
(1930). Dietrich sings a couple of rousing numbers in the Last Chance 
Saloon, including the celebrated "See What the Boys in the Back Room 
Will Have." In another reversal of stereotype, the usual "fight in the 
saloon" scene takes place between two women, as Frenchy and Lily 
Belle (Una Merkel) engage in an unladylike wrestling match.
Frenchy transfers her affections from gambler Kent (Brian Donlevy) 
to Destry, then leads the women of the town in a final rout of the bad 
guys, before throwing herself in front of Destry to take a bullet meant to 
kill him. It's an amusing tale handled with a deft touch, very different in 
spirit from the original novel by Max Brand, the most prolific of all 
Western fiction writers, which was first filmed in 1932 with Tom Mix in 
the title role, and then again in 1954 with Audie Murphy.  EB

Gone with the Wind  Victor Fleming & George Cukor, 1939
Margaret Mitchell's Civil War best seller was snapped up by megalomaniac 
producer David O. Selznick, who resisted Mitchell's suggestion that he 
cast Basil Rathbone as Rhett Butler in favor of the fans' only choice, Clark 
Gable. After a nationwide talent search and a Hollywood catfight involving 
every potential leading lady in town, Selznick hired British Vivien Leigh 
to play Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara. Insistent from the start that every 
detail be sumptuous, Selznick then wore out at least three directors 
(Sam Wood, George Cukor, and Victor Fleming), set fire to the surviving 
King Kong sets to stage the burning of Atlanta, hired enough extras to 
refight the Civil War, and sat back to watch the Oscars and acclaim roll in.
Conceived from the outset as the ultimate Hollywood movie, Gone 
with the Wind became the benchmark for popular epic cinema for 
decades to come. Though the film is monumental enough to be beyond 
criticism, most of its really great scenes come in the first half, which was 
substantially directed by Cukor, who brought his skilled touch with 
character and nuance to the material with a great epic sweep. Fleming, 
meanwhile, best known for directing macho action, somehow wound 
up handling the soapier stretches as the leads' marriage falters through 
postbellum ups and downs far less compelling than the war-torn, cross-
purposes romance that got them together.
The motor of the plot is the vacillating heart of Scarlett, whom Leigh 
plays first as flighty then flinty; she is so infatuated with gentlemanly 
Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) that she marries several lesser (and 
doomed) milksops when he opts for the more conventionally feminine 
(and doomed) Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Rhett Butler, a pragmatist 
rather than an idealist, enters the picture and she is drawn to him as the 
war overturns the Southern way of life, marrying him after she has sworn 
never to go hungry again and to do anything it takes to keep Tara, her 
father's plantation, going despite the depradations of Yankees and 
carpetbaggers. Only when Rhett rejects her does she realize she truly 
loves him, prompting the classic have-it-both-ways ending in which he 
walks out ("Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn") and she swears to win 
him back ("Tomorrow is another day").
Like The Birth of a Nation (1915), Gone with the Wind tidies up a lot of 
complex history, showing only happy devoted slaves and depicting Ashley's 
postwar involvement in a hooded Klan organization as a heroic (if doomed) 
endeavor. But the sweep of the movie is near irresistible, and Selznick's 
set pieces are among the most emblematic in cinema history: the 
pullback from Scarlett as she walks among the wounded to fill the screen 
with injured soldiers in gray, the dash through the blazes as Atlanta burns, 
and Rhett carrying Scarlett upstairs into sexual shadows. Dressed up with 
gorgeous 1939 Technicolor, pastel-pretty for the dresses and blazing red 
for the passions, and a thunderous score, Gone with the Wind still has a fair 
claim to be considered the last word in Hollywood filmmaking.  KN

1939
i


Although it was not the first film to use dissolves to signal flashbacks, 
Marcel Carné's Daybreak was deemed so innovative in 1939 that the 
producers insisted on a pretitle card to dispel any confusion: "A man has 
committed murder. Locked, trapped in a room, he recalls how he became 
a murderer." The murderer is François (Jean Gabin), a common factory 
worker who has been lured into murder by the victim, an amoral and 
manipulative vaudeville entertainer by the name of Valentin (Jules 
Berry). Their fate is bound up with two women: the earthy, sensual 
Clara (Arletty), who leaves Valentin to take up with François, and the pure, 
idealized Françoise (Jacqueline Laurent), whom François loves, but 
who has been corrupted by her association with the other man.
Among the remarkable series of classic films to spring from the 
collaboration between Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert (the others 
include Port of Shadows [1938], The Devil's Envoys [1942], and, preeminently, 
Children of Paradise [1945]), Daybreak is arguably the most influential. 
Certainly it rehearses ideas the team would return to in Children of 
Paradise. Although Daybreak wears its allegorical themes lightly, François 
clearly stands for the French working man, and the film gives voice to 
the despair that overtook the supporters of the Popular Front in the late 
1930s as the state swept aside progressive socialist reforms and the 
specter of fascism loomed. When one friend yells from the crowd 
gathered outside his building that there's still hope, François retorts, "It's 
over, there isn't a François anymore. . . . There isn't anything anymore."
The film's doom-laden sense of existential alienation and austere, 
claustrophobic atmosphere clearly anticipated the mood and form of 
American film noir. In fact, RKO remade the film with Henry Fonda and 
Vincent Price as The Long Night in 1946 (the studio attempted to destroy 
all prints of the original but mercifully failed). Similarly, Gabin's rough-
hewn romantic predates American counterparts like John Garfield and 
Humphrey Bogart as an iconic working-class hero. Daybreak stands as 
probably the masterpiece of French poetic realism.  TCh

Gunga Din  George Stevens, 1939
153
Classic Hollywood's purest adventure story, Gunga Din derives, 
strangely enough, from a Rudyard Kipling poem, which furnished 
writers Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur with only atmosphere and 
the minor character of its title.
The most famous entry in a series of 1930s productions that praise 
British shouldering of the white man's burden, Gunga Din tells the story 
of three professional soldiers (Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and 
Victor McLaglen) in the "Imperial Lancers." At first the trio seems about 
to break up, with one man on the verge of marriage—a fate worse than 
death in this world of exclusive male values. Fortunately, a terrible 
threat to the community soon arises in the form of a fanatic sect of ritual 
murderers, the Thuggees. Two set-piece battles follow, expertly staged 
by Stevens. At the film's climax, the three sergeants are locked in a 
standoff with the Thuggees, whose evil leader has used them to lure the 
regiment into a trap. But Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) rises as if from the dead 
to sound his bugle and warn the troop, who then slaughter the fanatics. 
The trio are reunited with their regiment to celebrate the heroism of 
their fallen companion.
Made on what was a huge budget for the time, Gunga Din is a 
spectacular visual treat, one of the most impressive action films ever 
made—the buddy film to end all buddy films.  RBP
Ninotchka  Ernst Lubitsch, 1939
Ernst Lubitsch's most charming and humorous comedy of European 
manners features Greta Garbo in a rare comic role. Set in Paris during 
the 1920s, Ninotchka's plot revolves around the attempt of the Soviet 
government to recover priceless jewels from the exiled Grand Duchess 
Swana (Ina Claire). Three bumbling bureaucrats fail at this mission and 
find themselves seduced by the luxuries and freedoms of Western 
society. So it is up to Ninotchka (Garbo) to regain the treasure by 
dealing with the lover of the Grand Duchess, the smooth and handsome 
Leon (Melvyn Douglas).
In the end, Ninotchka is able to get the jewels only by returning to 
Moscow and breaking with Leon, who soon follows her to Russia. 
Though they are in love, she refuses to betray her country, and Leon 
must use subterfuge to have her travel to Istanbul, where he meets her 
and they decide to marry. The film's political themes are hardly serious 
but serve as the background for one comic shtick after another, most 
memorably perhaps Ninotchka's attempt—in a fancy Paris nightclub—
to get the ladies room attendants to go on strike. Douglas is perfect as 
the enamored and self-indulgent Leon, but this is Garbo's picture and 
her last great screen role.  RBP

The Wizard of Oz  Victor Fleming, 1939
Based on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the turn-of-the-century children's 
novel by L. Frank Baum, this evergreen classic is one of the great film 
fairy tales, also a first-rate musical and the vehicle that turned Judy 
Garland from a talented child performer into a lasting and iconic movie 
star. Not hugely profitable on its first release, perhaps because it was 
such an expensive production, The Wizard of Oz has become beloved by 
successive generations. Like It's a Wonderful Life (1946), its popularity was 
boosted in the 1950s by annual Christmas television screenings, which 
established it as among the most beloved of all movies.
Along with her little dog Toto, Garland's Dorothy Gale (breasts strapped 
down to make her seem younger) is whisked out of a sepia Kansas by a 
tornado and dumped in the ravishing Technicolor Land of Oz, where she 
squashes a witch under her house, is gifted by Glinda the Good (Billie 
Burke) with the dead hag's magic ruby slippers, and takes off down the 
Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City in order to find her way back to 
the farm from which she once wished she could escape. The "no place 
like home" theme, a screenwriter's convenience to keep all the characters 
focused on their quests, has always seemed like a slight cop-out (why 
would anyone want to leave the wonders of Oz and go back to Kansas?). 
It never quite squares with the spoilsport interpretation of the whole 
film as a delirious dream in which Dorothy has recast everyone she knows 
as her Land of Oz friends and enemies.
The film has many splendors: a superb Harold Arlen-E.Y. Harburg 
score (ranging from the wistful "Over the Rainbow" through the infectious 
jollity of "Off to See the Wizard" and "Ding-Dong, the Witch Is Dead" to 
the classic comedy of "If I Only Had a Brain"), incredible MGM set design, 
hundreds of squeaky Munchkins and flying monkeys, the "horse of a 
different color" gag, and perfect performances all round. There are also 
a number of unforgettable stand-out moments: Ray Bolger's Scarecrow 
being dismembered while Jack Haley's Tin Man laments, "Well, that's 
you all over"; Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion trying to be threatening ("I'll 
fight you with one paw tied behind my back"); Wicked Witch Margaret 
Hamilton's fate under a bucket of water ("I'm melting, I'm melting!"), 
Frank Morgan emerging from behind the curtain ("I'm a very good man, 
it's just that I'm a very bad wizard").
Like its 1939 MGM stablemate Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz 
bears a director's credit for solid pro Victor Fleming but is actually a 
triumph of the producer's art, with Mervyn LeRoy pulling together all 
the diverse elements of a hardly smooth shoot. Buddy Ebsen was cast 
as the Scarecrow then switched to playing the Tin Man until he turned 
out to be allergic to the makeup; a whole "Jitterbug" number was 
dropped and hidden until it showed up in That's Entertainment! (1974); 
and the midgets cast as the Munchkins reputedly ran riot. Best line: 
"Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable."  KN

"A delightful piece of

The New York Times, 1939



La règle du jeu  Jean Renoir, 1939
The Rules of the Game
After the great success of The Grand Illusion (1937) and La Bête Humaine 
(1938), Jean Renoir, together with his brother Claude and three friends, 
founded his own production company, Les Nouvelles Editions Françaises. 
The NEF's first announced project was an updating of Pierre de Marivaux's 
Les Caprices de Marianne; asked to describe what his film would be like, 
Renoir answered, "An exact description of the bourgeoisie of our time." 
This is the film that was eventually titled The Rules of the Game.
After completing a transatlantic flight in record time, aviator André 
Jurieux (Roland Toutain) announces over the radio his disappointment 
that a certain someone isn't at the airport to greet him. That "someone" 
is Christine (Nora Gregor), an Austrian married to mechanical bird collector 
Robert de la Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio). Octave (played by Renoir himself), 
friend and confidant of both André and Christine, convinces Robert to 
invite André out to a hunting party at his lavish estate La Colinière as a 
way of saving face; for his part, Robert hopes having André around might 
distract Christine while he settles accounts with his longtime mistress 
Geneviève (Mila Parély). That is what's happening among the "masters." 
Turning to the "servants," there's Lisette (Paulette Dubost), maid to 
Christine and married to Schumacher (Gaston Modot), groundskeeper 
at La Colinière, who catches the eye of Marceau (Julien Carette), a 
poacher who gets hired by Robert as a house servant. Renoir's screenplay 
brings the various amorous adventures of the masters and servants 
together, heading finally to the "accidental" shooting of André, sacrificed 
so that a corrupt social order can remain intact.
A cinematic style favoring deep spaces and a highly mobile camera 
here reaches its perfection, as Renoir underlines the theatrical atmosphere 
that dominates both onstage and off. Most of the performances are 
flawless: Dalio as Robert, Carette as Marceau, Dubost as Lisette, and Modot 
as Schumacher. Reviewers over the years have quibbled over Gregor's 
performance as Christine, wondering why so many men in the film are 
smitten with her—but perhaps that's the point. Boldly, Renoir cast himself 
as Octave, a devastating portrait of a man who fills in the emptiness of 
his own life by serving as the intermediary for the affairs of others.
A commercial disaster when first released in the summer of 1939, The 
Rules of the Game was cut and recut but to no avail; soon after the war 
began that fall, it was banned as a danger to public morale. In the late 1940s 
and 1950s, its legend was kept alive by André Bazin and his disciples at 
Cahiers du Cinéma, who claimed that alongside Citizen Kane (1941), Rules 
had been the harbinger of modern cinema, yet it was known only in a 
shortened version (88 minutes). In 1956, it was reconstructed to almost 
its original length (113 minutes, but it's still missing a scene), presented at 
the Venice Film Festival in 1959, and the rest is film history, with The Rules 
of the Game finally celebrated internationally as the masterpiece it is.  RP

Zangiku monogatari  Kenji Mizoguchi, 1939
The Story of the Late Chrysanthemums 
In the nineteenth century, a lazy and untalented Kabuki actor born into 
a famous family falls in love with his brother's wet nurse. Opposed to 
their match, his family casts her out of the house. He follows her, and 
she devotes her life to helping him improve his art, ruining her health 
in the process. In the end, she dies at home while he, having at last 
achieved recognition as an actor, leads his troupe on a triumphal boat 
procession through Osaka.
The Story of the Late Chrysanthemums is one of the essential Kenji 
Mizoguchi films, a work of dazzling elegance and formal rigor and a 
powerful attack on the social structures that impose the roles of 
sacrificial victims upon women. Mizoguchi's long takes move the 
narrative slowly, enfolding the inexorable logic of events within larger 
and more complex structures. The film allows time for reflection and 
interiorization, as the characters, recognizing their places in the 
patterns of power, react to events with fear, horror, sadness, or revolt. 
The narrative, with its emphasis on metaphorical journeys—the 
migrations of the acting troupe and the hero's path to artistic 
excellence—allows Mizoguchi to create a double metaphorical filter. For 
him, cinema and theater are machines for the distillation of beauty and 
the achievement of tragic understanding. CFu
Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's classic newspaper play The Front 
Page had been filmed successfully before and would be again after this 
sparkling 1939 version, scripted by Hecht and Charles Lederer. But astute 
and witty director Howard Hawks delights in the simple twist that was 
a stroke of genius—turning ace reporter Hildy Johnson into a woman. 
Voilà, His Girl Friday became the fastest-talking battle of the sexes in the 
history of romantic screwball comedy.
Scintillating Rosalind Russell is the wisecracking star reporter her 
editor and ex-husband (Cary Grant as the unscrupulous and aggressively 
charming Walter Burns) can't lose in the middle of a hot murder story. 
When she announces that she's quitting to marry a meek square (Ralph 
Bellamy), Walter's incredulity and dismay launch him into conniving 
overdrive. As wily Walter calculates, Hildy can't resist a last big story 
and is shortly up to her absurd hat in a jailhouse break and corruption 
exposé. Grant and Russell engage in dizzying verbal play of machine-
gun speed in a plot that reaches farcical heights, with a great character 
ensemble of gum-chewing, smoke-wreathed, poker-playing hacks 
acting as their cynical chorus. Theatrical and stylish, His Girl Friday is 
unrivaled for comic timing and snappy repartee.  AE

Fantasia  Ben Sharpsteen (supervisor), 1940
Although now commonplace, creating images to interpret music was 
revolutionary when this audacious milestone in animation and 
stereophonic audio recording was conceived and executed by the Walt 
Disney studio to universal acclaim and astonishment. Graced by the 
eminent symphonic star Leopold Stokowski conducting the Philadelphia 
Orchestra, Fantasia's eight wide-ranging sequences comprise a concert 
with ambitious, amusing, portentous, and experimental cartoons 
accompanying pieces by Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Schubert, and others. 
Even on IMAX screens, the exhibition scene of choice for the most 
recent of Disney's several anniversary restorations, rerecordings, and 
rereleases of their prized 1940 animation landmark, Fantasia can be 
disappointing because it is still a remorselessly kitsch experience, 
however impressive and groundbreaking an achievement. Baby 
boomers who enjoyed it on hallucinogenics in their youths are probably 
the audience fondest of it now. But there are some magical sequences 
that endure, as befits a film made by sixty animators working under no 
less than eleven directors (supervised by Ben Sharpsteen).
Most watchable are the abstractions ahead of their time to Bach, 
in which the multichannel sound is perfectly synchronized to the 
drawings and seems to soar out of the screen. Mickey Mouse, never 
more delightful than as the Sorcerer's Apprentice desperately trying to 
halt the self-replicating brooms he has conjured up to do his chores, the 
dancing Chinese mushrooms, a darling chorus line of eyelash-batting 
pachyderms, the hippos in ballet tutus cavorting daintily and fleeing 
caped alligators to "The Dance of the Hours"—all still a hoot. Together 
these make for a sweet hour of greatness. In between are sequences that 
have not aged as well. The capering fairies who are nude but tastefully 
free from sexual organs, the seemingly interminable decline of the 
dinosaurs to Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, and the vulgar absurdity to which 
Beethoven's Pastorale has been subjected (centaurs flirtatiously pursuing 
coy, suspiciously pubescent-looking centaurettes who are coiffed in the 
style of Joan Crawford) all take some beating for incredulity value.  AE

It is somewhat surprising that despite Alfred Hitchcock's long, fruitful 
career, and despite several subsequent nominations, only Rebecca, his 
first American film, earned him an Academy Award for Best Picture. Then 
again, that may say more about the persuasive power of producer David 
O. Selznick. Hot from the success of the 1939 film Gone with the Wind, 
Selznick seized the opportunity to work with Hitchcock, pairing the 
director with Daphne Du Maurier's gothic ghost story.
Working with a big budget, Hitchcock transformed the Manderley 
mansion into a character unto itself—later the inspiration for the 
imposing Xanadu in Citizen Kane (1941). The palatial seaside estate is the 
atmospheric setting for the strained romance between Joan Fontaine 
and Laurence Olivier. He's a wealthy widower wooing the innocent 
Fontaine, and she never questions her good fortune in finding such a 
loving man. They marry after a whirlwind romance, but as their 
relationship deepens, Fontaine is haunted more and more by the spirit 
of his dead wife—Rebecca. Is the haunting merely a figment of her 
imagination, or the fruits of paranoia, or is a more nefarious force at 
work? And what, if anything, does the suspicious servant Mrs. Danvers 
(Judith Anderson), who always seems to be hovering near the nerve-
wracked Fontaine, have to do with the strange goings-on?
Rebecca marked Hitchcock's auspicious arrival in America. All his 
artistic traits were used to full effect: there's the murky, mysterious earlier 
history, the barely contained suspicions, the fairy-tale romance doomed 
by the encroaching past, and, of course, the looming specter of foul play. 
Rebecca does lack some of Hitchcock's trademark playfulness, and the 
sense of humor is missed; the absence of levity is due in no small part to 
the unremittingly gloomy, gothic nature of Du Maurier's melodramatic 
novel. Innocent Fontaine is nearly driven to madness by the lingering 
secrets of Manderley, but Hitchcock is more than happy to let the tension 
build and build toward the haunting conclusion.  JKl

George Cukor's 1940 adaptation of Philip Barry's theatrical farce is the 
uncontested classic of all sophisticated slapstick comedies. Katharine 
Hepburn had starred in the play on Broadway and it is said that playwright 
Phillip Barry based the leading female character on her reputation at the 
time. Having left RKO on less than ideal terms, the public saw Hepburn 
as bossy and unfeminine—not the womanly ideal for the late 1930s.
In the opening scene, now famous for its virtually dialogue-free fury, 
heiress Tracy Lord (Hepburn) watches her recently divorced playboy 
husband Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) put a few of his belongings in the 
car, snapping a golf club over her thigh in anger. Trying to prove that she 
is not impossible to love, Tracy plans to marry a respectable if colorless 
man at the family mansion when Dexter returns with two reporters in tow, 
Mike Connor (James Stewart) and Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), specifically to 
ruin the wedding. Never more luminous, Hepburn outdoes herself in a role 
which demands impeccable comic timing as well as true vulnerability. 
Hepburn owned the rights to the project, which she then wisely sold 
to MGM on condition that she recap her leading role as well as choose 
the director and cast. She had wanted Clark Gable as Dexter and Spencer 
Tracy as Mike, but because of scheduling clashes neither were available. 
Cukor managed to make Hepburn's negative public image work for her 
through her character, eliciting feelings of sorrow for a beautiful woman 
so misunderstood. The film was an enormous success, with an award-
winning screenplay that matched comedy with social commentary.  KK

Few American pictures in the 1930s got to grips with the suffering and 
dislocation of the Great Depression. Hollywood largely left it to other 
media to document the national disaster. John Steinbeck's novel The 
Grapes of Wrath, first published in 1939, was based on solid research, 
following dispossessed farming families from Oklahoma as they 
journeyed to the orchards of California in search of casual labor.
Despite objections from the conservative financiers who controlled 
the studio, Darryl Zanuck bought the book for 20th Century Fox. He knew 
that John Ford was the right man to direct it, with his feeling for the 
American people and their history. Ford also identified what was most 
heartbreaking about the plight of the Joad family—not their acute 
poverty, but the psychological trauma of being uprooted from their 
home, of being cast out on the road, rootless. In a memorable scene Ma 
Joad (Jane Darwell) burns the possessions she can't take with her the 
night before they must abandon their farm.
For his hero, Tom Joad, Ford cast Henry Fonda, who had just appeared 
in Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) and Drums Along the Mohawk (1939), 
two other pieces of Americana. Members of the unofficial John Ford Stock 
Company to appear included Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, John Qualen 
as their friend Muley, and John Carradine as an itinerant preacher. And 
for his cameraman Ford made an inspired choice. Gregg Toland captured 
brilliantly the documentary look of the pictures that had been taken of 
the dustbowl tragedy by government-employed photographers such as 
Dorothea Lange. Nowhere is this better seen than in a sequence where 
the Joads drive into a squatters camp, the camera dwelling on the grim 
faces of the occupants and on the run-down shacks where they live.
Though The Grapes of Wrath does not shirk from showing the enormity 
of its subjects' plight, there is a significant departure from the novel. In 
Steinbeck's book the Joads first find easier conditions in a government-
run camp, but by the end are reduced to starvation wages. In the film, 
they find the camp later on, thus making their progress an upward curve, 
marked by Ma's final speech: "We're the people. . . . We'll go on forever."  EB

One of the few anti-Nazi films Hollywood made before Pearl Harbor—
detailed and passionate in its condemnation of Nazism—Frank Borzage's 
The Mortal Storm opens on the day Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of 
Germany. The day also happens to be the sixtieth birthday of Professor 
Viktor Roth (Frank Morgan), a beloved science professor at a university 
in southern Germany. The film shows the consolidation of Nazi Germany 
through the destruction of the "non-Aryan" Roth and his family: his 
wife, his two Aryan stepsons, who become rabid Nazis, and his actual 
daughter, Freya (Margaret Sullavan).
Borzage portrays Nazism as a form of insanity, to which many men 
(only one woman as far as we see) succumb as if by contagion or by 
natural predisposition (the film makes no analysis of the socioeconomic 
roots of Nazism) but with which, in some individuals, a residual humanity 
comes into conflict. The magnificent final scene locates this conflict within 
the character played by Robert Stack. Alone in his stepfather's house, he 
walks through its empty rooms. The camera tracks past him, exploring 
the shadowy space, the soundtrack filled with dialogue from earlier 
scenes; we hear the young man's footsteps as he goes out of the house.
The Mortal Storm is one of American cinema's great love stories. 
Borzage's poignant and subtle handling of the relationship between 
Freya and Martin (James Stewart) is in keeping with the director's 
career-long commitment to the transcendent power of love—an idealism 
to which the admirable performances of Sullavan and Stewart are 
uncompromisingly faithful. Just before the lovers' trek to the mountainous 
pass across the Austrian border, Martin's mother (Maria Ouspenskaya) 
has them celebrate their union by drinking from a ceremonial wine cup. 
This scene is one of the most luminous in all Borzage's work.
Uncredited coproducer Victor Saville said he directed much of the 
film, a claim that has been widely repeated but contradicted by several 
key cast and crew members. There can be no doubt that The Mortal 
Storm is fully representative of the style, philosophy, and concerns of 
Frank Borzage.  CFu

Unsurprisingly, its uncompromising 
message saw the film—and all MGM

The Bank Dick was written by W.C. Fields under the name "Mahatma Kane 
Jeeves," which suggests something of his ambitions, and directed by 
amiable traffic cop Eddie Cline, whose job was to clear the way so Fields 
could cut loose with all his multiple idiosyncracies, As usual, the star is 
cast as a mild-mannered but resentful bumbler who wants only to be 
left in peace but is nagged by an unreasonable world into making the 
effort to respond to various impolite intruders into his happy doze.
Egbert Sousé, a put-upon bumbler who would like nothing more 
than to spend his life in bars getting quietly drunk, is constantly harassed 
into making something of himself by his frightful wife (Cora Witherspoon), 
ghastly mother-in-law (Jessie Relph), obnoxious teenage daughter 
(Una Merkel), her chinless boob fiancé (Grady Sutton), and his own 
bratty younger child. When he accidentally foils a bank robbery by 
blundering into the crook, he is given the job of uniformed security 
guard and allowed to cause trouble in a succession of absolutely perfect 
routines that pit him against snooty officials (Franklin Pangborn as a 
bank inspector driven to distraction), hard-bitten crooks (one would-be 
robber is dragged off on a hilarious road chase sequence on a par with 
any silent slapstick), and offensive customers.
Like all the best Fields films (It's a Gift [1934], Never Give a Sucker an 
Even Break [1941]), the premise here is just an excuse for a succession of 
vaudeville-like sketches in which he is pitted against a partner too 
eccentric to be classed as a straight man but also too vicious to be a 
victim. Some of the routines in The Bank Dick, such as when Sousé 
somehow finds himself in the director's chair while a movie is being 
shot, stray far afield from the bank. But the marbled, pompous halls of 
commerce and capital, with glad-handing moneybags who receive their 
comeuppance as Sousé somehow becomes rich and "reformed," are an 
ideal setting for mischief and anarchy. Fields was a rare comedian who 
could be funny while strangling a small child, and this seventy-five-
minute gem is among his masterpieces.  KN

Pinocchio  Hamilton Luske & Ben Sharpsteen, 1940
Some of the darker elements of Carlo Collodi's original Italian fable 
were, of course, discarded once Disney had the story. But only some. 
The lasting appeal of the animated Pinocchio shows that not all of the 
alterations the studio made to the story of a wooden puppet brought 
to life were necessarily for the worse, and several of the story's most 
frightening details remain prominent. The classic still features plenty 
of horror as Pinocchio faces the perils of peer pressure that distract 
him from his goal of becoming a real boy. Guided (but not always led) 
by his insect "conscience" Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio must learn not just 
responsibility but also courage and love during his innocently roguish 
quest for life.
As Disney's second feature (after Snow White), Pinocchio showed the 
then-uncharted world of animation to be rife with possibility, resulting 
in such enchanting and ethereal creations as the luminous Blue Fairy, 
and such amazing sequences as the escape from cursed Pleasure Island 
and the thrilling encounter with the fittingly named Monstro the Whale. 
Add to these such now standard songs as "When You Wish Upon a Star," 
and is it any wonder Pinocchio has remained a towering standard by 
which so many animated films are judged?  JKl

Citizen Kane  Orson Welles, 1941
From 1962 until 2012, Sight & Sound magazine's oft-cited critics' poll of 
the greatest films ever made placed Citizen Kane, Orson Welles's 
remarkable debut film, at the top of the list. By 1998, the American Film 
Institute called it the greatest movie of all time. It also garnered Best 
Picture awards from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National 
Board of Review, and won an Oscar for its screenplay. The legend of 
Citizen Kane has partly been fueled by the fact that Welles was only 
twenty-four when he made the film, but also from the obvious 
comparisons between the titular character and newspaper magnate 
William Randolph Hearst, who moved heaven and earth to stop the 
picture from being made—and then, when he could not stop it from 
being distributed, tried to discredit it. But beyond the ridiculous hype of 
any single film being "the greatest movie of all time," Citizen Kane is of 
tremendous interest and importance, for a number of reasons.
The film tells a great story: Charles Foster Kane (played brilliantly by 
Welles himself) is born poor, but strikes it rich through a gold mine 
bequeathed to his mother. As a young man he begins to assemble a 
populist newspaper and radio empire, eventually marrying the niece of 
an American president and running for governor. But any ambition he 
has for real power is stymied. As Kane becomes alienated from his 
power, he becomes increasingly abusive to the women in his life, first 
his wife, then his mistress. He dies, almost alone, in his reconstructed 
but unfinished castle, longing for the simplicity of his childhood. Firmly 
within the traditions of New Deal populism, Citizen Kane extols the very 
American perspective that money cannot buy happiness, but in a 
highly prosaic, almost Dickensian way.
More significantly, Citizen Kane begins with Kane's death, and the 
enigmatic final word he utters: "Rosebud." A group of intrepid newsreel 
reporters try to discover the meaning of this last word and interview 
several of Kane's acquaintances. Not only is the film told in flashback, but 
each character only knows the man from a certain perspective, which is 
presented in due course. The film's narrative complexity, without ever 
violating classical Hollywood narrative continuity and causality, is a 
remarkable tour de force, responsible in large part for critic Pauline Kael's 
accusation that the film's true genius lay not in the hands of wunderkind 
Welles, but in those of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz.
The film's real power, though, lies in its cinematography: Gregg Toland 
developed a technique for deep-focus photography, wherein the extreme 
foreground, central middle-ground, and background were all in focus at 
the same time, allowing the eye to focus on any part of the image. This 
technique was criticized at the time for calling attention to itself, in direct 
violation of the codes of classical Hollywood cinematography, wherein 
good photography was assumed to be invisible. Even by today's different 
standards, Citizen Kane's cinematography is striking and unforgettable.  MK

Howard Hawks's Sergeant York celebrates the good fight of World War I 
just as the United States was preparing for World War II. A bellicose 
subtext is everywhere apparent, yet it is easily assimilated into the moral 
framework of the film's eponymous lead.
Alvin York, as characterized by Gary Cooper, speaks with a down-
home slang, the country bumpkin. His transformation from a spirited 
Tennessee farmer into a Christian pacifist and finally into a doughboy 
hero celebrates an array of Hollywood conventions, including sacred 
mothers and fair-minded leaders. Hackneyed? Yes. But this gem's 
importance rests in making Cooper a star, if not also in fairly depicting 
trench warfare only a few months before Pearl Harbor.
That no greater context for World War I is offered here is precisely 
the point. Sergeant York is narrowly concerned with courage and 
sacrifice. Anything more would undermine its portrait positing the 
defense of freedom as an ultimate goal. Simultaneously loving biblical 
virtue and skilled gunplay, the movie revels in camaraderie, chaste 
romance, and dueling fisticuffs. In short, it's a Hawksian world here 
perfectly transposed into a biopic long on small-town values and short 
on the violent conflict that made the real-life Alvin York famous.  GC-Q

The Lady Eve is a classic screwball comedy and a quintessential Preston 
Sturges film, reflecting the writer-director's view of romance as the 
greatest con game of all. The script abounds in superb lines, the 
dialogue is fast-paced and witty, and the plot offers a clever variation 
on the familiar battle-of-the-sexes motif.
The film begins on a cruise ship, where resourceful and sophisticated 
temptress Jean Harrington (Barbara Stanwyck) tries to seduce the guileless 
snake-lover Charles "Hopsie" Pike (Henry Fonda) in order to con him out 
of his fortune built on "Pike's Ale." In a highly implausible but delightful 
plot twist, the action then shifts to Hopsie's Connecticut mansion, where 
Jean reappears as an English heiress, Lady Eve Sidwich. She seduces 
Hopsie again and makes him marry her with the intention of dumping 
him afterward as retribution for having deserted her earlier. In the end, 
however, her scheming backfires when she truly falls in love with him.
Sturges somehow manages to get away with quite a lot in The Lady 
Eve. Weaving in numerous references to the biblical story of the Fall, he 
emphasizes sexuality in a way that few filmmakers at the time would 
have even dared. The Lady Eve was remade in 1956 as (the considerably 
inferior) The Birds and the Bees, starring Mitzi Gaynor and David Niven.  RDe

The Wolf Man  George Waggner, 1941
The figure of the wolf man—that bipedal, cinematic version of the 
werewolf archetype, dramatically embodying the Jekyll/Hyde (superego/
id) dichotomy present in us all—first took center stage in Universal's 
Werewolf of London (1935), starring Henry Hull in a role reprised decades 
later by Jack Nicholson in Wolf (1994). Shortly thereafter, Curt Siodmak 
finished the screenplay for what was to be Universal Pictures' latest horror 
classic—following Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), and The Mummy 
(1932)—The Wolf Man. In what still remains the most recognizable and 
cherished version of the myth, Lon Chaney Jr., stars as Lawrence Talbot, 
an American-educated Welshman who wants nothing more than to be 
cured of his irrepressible (when the moon is full) lycanthropy.
Makeup king Jack Pierce devised an elaborate yak-hair costume 
for Chaney that would come to serve as the template for countless 
Halloween masks. What distinguishes Siodmark's story from previous 
werewolf tales was the coded emphasis on repressed sexual energy as 
the motivating force behind Talbot's full-moon transformations. As the 
gypsy Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya) explains, "Even a man that is pure in 
heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the 
wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright." The success of this 
picture led to four more Chaney-driven Wolf Man films in the 1940s alone. 
Dozens of imitators, updates, takeoffs, and spoofs have followed.  SJS

High Sierra is a landmark of the gangster genre, a career turning point 
for Humphrey Bogart, and a model of action-film existentialism by Raoul 
Walsh. Like Walsh's earlier The Roaring Twenties (1939), High Sierra is an 
elegiac gangster film, unusual in this Production Code-ruled period for 
its sympathetic portrayal of the gangster as an outdated outcast. Old-timer 
Roy Earle (Bogart), the nobly named hero, towers above the punks and 
hypocrites he encounters on both sides of the law as he leads an ill-fated 
hotel heist, foolishly pursues a respectable girl (Joan Leslie), and briefly 
finds more suitable companionship with a fellow outcast (Ida Lupino).
In contrast to such contemporaries as John Ford, Howard Hawks, Frank 
Capra, and Michael Curtiz, who stress the value of the community or 
group, Walsh in this period gave more weight to his heroes' egotism, 
nonconformity, and antisocial qualities. High Sierra's view of straight-and-
narrow society is scathing, peaking in the scene in which Roy is rejected by 
his vapid middle-class princess in favor of her smug conformist boyfriend.
After a decade of playing squares and punks, Bogart got his most 
substantial role yet in High Sierra. In The Maltese Falcon, his other important 
film of 1941, Bogart is expansive, smart-alecky, domineering. In High Sierra, 
Bogart's subtler performance creates a distinctively different persona: 
moody, withdrawn, and tense, his shoulders hunched and his gestures 
cramped to emphasize the character's insular nature. Even in Roy's 
intimate scenes with his soulmate Marie (Lupino), Walsh places objects 
and barriers between the lovers to underline their essential isolation.
High Sierra begins and ends with the lofty peak of Mount Whitney, 
which appears throughout the film, its siren presence beckoning the 
hero to his lonely destiny. Another underworld character says to Roy, 
"You remember what Johnny Dillinger said about guys like you and 
him? He said you were just rushing toward death. Yeah, that's it: just 
rushing toward death!" The great car-chase scene in which the cops 
pursue Roy up the fatal mountain—a spectacular payoff of the entire 
film's tight, kinetic style—translates those words into the dynamic visual 
language of action cinema at its height.  MR

Though John Ford was most famous, of course, for making Westerns, he 
also had a fondness for all things Irish. Not that this Oscar-winning 
version of Richard Llewellyn's novel was transported across the Irish Sea 
from its setting in the Welsh coal-mining valleys; rather, the film is 
imbued with the same kind of fulsome nostalgia for the eccentric 
satisfactions of family life in the old country that distinguished the 1952 
film The Quiet Man. Ford's Wales, in fact, is just as much a country of 
the mind as was his beloved Ireland (at least in terms of how it was 
depicted on screen or invoked in words). This explains why Richard 
Day's beautifully designed mining village, for all the painstaking detail 
applied to its construction on the Fox backlot, feels like a dream of 
archetypal Welshness rather than any real village.
That, however, is wholly appropriate to the mood of nostalgia that 
fuels How Green Was My Valley from start to finish. The story is narrated 
by a man reflecting on his now-distant childhood, when as the 
youngest son (Roddy McDowall) of the Morgan family, he would see 
his father (Donald Crisp) and four brothers traipse daily up the hill on 
the way to the pit. What he recalls are not just the hardships—the 
perilous working conditions, the threat of poverty, cold, and hunger—
and the tragic deaths but also the warm, loving sense of community 
that reigned in the lives both of the family and of the village as a 
whole. But that happy togetherness was forever lost when wage cuts 
brought strikes and conflict between the kindly but traditional 
patriarch and the (marginally) more militant sons: a conflict that 
resulted in the boys going off to find better-paid work in the Promised 
Land of—where else?—America.
The entire film is colored by bittersweet remembrance: by the loss of 
family, childhood innocence, one's country, and a stern but fair father. 
It's true Ford idealizes the world he depicts, but that is what makes it so 
effective. Yes, the film is a tearjerker, it is clichéd (the miners never seem 
to stop singing), and the accents are an odd mix from all around the 
United Kingdom and Ireland—but aren't dreams ever thus?  GA

Sullivan's Travels  Preston Sturges, 1941
As one of American cinema's earliest auteurs and cutting a distinctly 
modern figure (his mother's best friend was Isadora Duncan; he spent 
his youth criss-crossing the Atlantic; a "kiss-proof" lipstick and ticker-tape 
machine were among his patented inventions), Preston Sturges was 
responsible for an explosion of now-classic films in the 1940s. These films 
are known for their sophisticated verbal wit, uproarious physical comedy, 
and their affectionate portrayal of eccentric, scene-stealing supporting 
characters. But Sturges's work is also consistent in its exploration of 
the possibilities and prospects of upward—and occasionally downward—
mobility. In what may be his finest, most complex film, Sullivan's Travels, 
Sturges brilliantly mixes broad humor with sharp-edged cultural 
commentary, once again—as in The Great McGinty (1940), Christmas in 
July (1940), and The Lady Eve (1941)—revealing social identity to be a 
highly unstable proposition, capable of hyperbolic transformation 
through such prosaic means as disguise, confusion, and self-deception.
John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a can't-miss Hollywood director 
who specializes in lightweight entertainment, exemplified by broad 
comedies such as the 1939 film Ants in Your Pants. Naïve and sheltered 
by a solicitous staff who have no interest in seeing their meal ticket 
change genres or become overly ambitious in his cinematic pursuits, 
Sully nonetheless sets his sights on directing an epic social commentary 
picture about tough times in Depression-era America, to be entitled 
O Brother, Where Art Thou? (a fictional title eventually used by the Coen 
Brothers for their own 2000 film, in clever tribute to Sturges). To research 
his topic, which involves such unpleasant issues as suffering, deprivation, 
and racial inequality, Sully insists on disguising himself as a hobo and 
making his way across the country to experience "real life" firsthand.
Once on the road, assorted adventures, meetings (notably with Veronica 
Lake's down-on-her-luck ingenue), and mishaps—some hilarious, others 
surprisingly poignant—transpire before Sully eventually comes to terms 
with his true calling as a lowbrow moviemaker with a gift for making 
people laugh. The lesson here is that strained seriousness and forced 
profundity have far less benefit for the masses than good old-fashioned 
humor, with its power to help people forget their troubles, if only for a while.
That Sullivan's Travels possesses an autobiographical dimension is 
impossible to deny, with Sturges affirming the value of what he himself 
did best—making smart comedies with the power to lift viewers' 
spirits—while ripping apart the pretentiousness of Hollywood's more 
sober and "socially committed" filmmakers. Personal statements aside, 
however, the tour de force script brings together a remarkable range of 
genres, including slapstick, action, melodrama, social documentary, 
romance, musical, and prison movie. Though it failed to garner a single 
Oscar nomination, Sullivan's Travels is the most remarkable film in the 
career of one of America's greatest filmmakers.  SJS

The Maltese Falcon  John Huston, 1941
By 1941, Dashiell Hammett's great private-eye novel had been acceptably 
filmed twice, under its own title in 1931 with Ricardo Cortez as Sam 
Spade and as Satan Met a Lady in 1935 with Warren William as the 
Spade character (and the falcon McGuffin turned into the Horn of 
Roland). John Huston, having served an apprenticeship as a writer, 
selected the book from Warner Brothers' catalogue of properties and 
was so confident in the strength of his material that his script essentially 
consists of a transcription of Hammett's dialogue. He was fortunate 
enough to have a letter-perfect cast down to the smallest bit parts, 
and the restraint not to go over the top. This debut feature has little of 
the razzle-dazzle of the same year's Citizen Kane, announcing the arrival 
not of an enfant terrible but of a consummate professional.
Often considered a cornerstone of film noir, The Maltese Falcon is 
sparing in its use of symbolic shadows—which are withheld until the 
elevator door casts jail-bar shapes across the face of the duplicitous 
heroine at the end—and takes place almost entirely in anonymously 
tidy hotel rooms and offices worlds away from the seedy glamor of 
The Big Sleep (1946) or Murder, My Sweet (1944). Humphrey Bogart, 
graduating from bad-guy roles to tough romantic heroes, is San 
Francisco private eye Sam Spade. A sharp-suited businessman, he is 
out to bring in the murderer of his partner and thwart a group of 
treacherous adventurers who have become so caught up in the search 
for the fabulous jeweled bird of the title that they make the fatal 
mistake of assuming everyone is as corrupt and greedy as they are. 
Mary Astor might at first glance seem a little matronly for a femme 
fatale, but her strange primness in tight suits and tighter hairstyle is 
weirdly apt for a woman who always has a backup lie in place. Sydney 
Greenstreet's talkative, obese, self-delighted Kaspar Gutman and Peter 
Lorre's polite, sad, scented, whiny Joel Cairo are screen immortals, a 
Bing and Bob or Laurel and Hardy of crime, with perennial loser/fall 
guy Elisha Cook Jr. as the angry little gunman Wilmer who is doomed 
always to be on the outside of the deal.
Hammett's reputation rests on his addition of a certain social 
realism to the American mystery story, with private eyes who are solid 
professionals rather than supersleuths. He was also addicted to plots as 
twisted and bizarre as Jacobean drama: The Maltese Falcon climaxes not 
only with the hysterical punchline that the black bird everyone has been 
scheming and killing to possess is actually a fraud, but also with the 
classic moment when the detective admits that he loves the murderess 
but is still going to let her get hauled off to jail. Whereas other great 
Hollywood directors pursue their own visions, Huston continued to be 
at his best—from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) through to The 
Asphalt Jungle (1950), Fat City (1972) Wise Blood (1979), and The Dead 
(1987)—when making faithful adaptations of minor classic novels.  KN

Dumbo  Ben Sharpsteen, 1941
Even today, Walt Disney's animation mills regularly turn to traditional 
fairy tales and familiar folk favorites for inspiration. But Disney's fourth 
animated feature, Dumbo, like the immediately subsequent Bambi 
(1942), was derived from a relatively low-profile book, which 
apparently freed the animators from more standard-issue prince-
rescues-princess romanticism.
Dumbo is still awash in sentimentality, but the anthropomorphized 
leads—Dumbo, the outcast baby circus elephant whose giant ears and 
clumsiness make him the object of ridicule, and Timothy, his worldly 
rodent companion—lend themselves to some joyfully chaotic action as 
well as some creatively rendered circus sequences. Yet two scenes 
during Dumbo's quest for self-worth stand out above all the rest: the 
protopsychedelic pink elephant hallucination and the tender, wrenching 
meeting between Dumbo and his wrongfully "jailed" mother. Animation 
has rarely been as inventive, moving, and alive as in these two segments, 
which are paired with equally memorable songs. Dumbo's eventual 
triumph over adversity, as well as his reunion with his mother, may be 
telegraphed from the start, but the film's emotional arc is so carefully 
constructed that the jump-through-the-hoops challenges faced by the 
put-upon elephant only enhance the heart-warming conclusion.  JKl

The Palm Beach Story  Preston Sturges, 1942
Rudy Vallée turns in his best performance as a gentle, puny millionaire 
named John D. Hackensacker III in this tender and scalding 1942 screwball 
comedy. Claudette Colbert plays Geraldine, the wife of Thomas Jeffers 
(Joel McCrea), an ambitious but penniless architectural engineer; she takes 
off for Florida and winds up being wooed by Hackensacker. When Thomas 
shows up, she persuades him to pose as her brother. Also on hand are such 
indelible Sturges creations as the Weenie King (Robert Dudley), the madly 
destructive Ale and Quail Club, Hackensacker's acerbic sister (Mary Astor), 
her European boyfriend of obscure nationality, and many Sturges regulars. 
The Hackensacker character may be the closest thing to a parodic self-
portrait in the Sturges canon. The part was written for Vallée after Sturges 
saw him in a film musical, noticed that the audience laughed every 
time he opened his mouth, and concluded that the man was hilarious 
without even knowing it. This unawareness played a major role in Sturges's 
conception of comedy, extending to the gullibility of viewers as well as 
characters. The frantic opening "gives away" the plot's surprise ending 
before the audience can begin to grasp what's going on. As critic James 
Harvey aptly noted, "In this movie, whenever reality becomes a problem—
on the way to Penn Station, for example, when a cab driver played by Frank 
Faylen agrees to take Colbert there for nothing—it's simply revoked."  JRos
The enduring popularity of Irving Rapper's Now, Voyager derives from 
the film's unembarrassed emotional crescendos, its star power, and 
particularly the pleasure—however perverse—we get from seeing Bette 
Davis's transformation from ugly duckling to swan (she was nominated 
for an Academy Award for her performance).
One of the classic American melodramas and the model "makeover" 
movie, Now, Voyager tells the elaborate story of spinster Charlotte Vale 
(Davis), the impossibly frumpy daughter (her heavy eyebrows and 
glasses tell it all) of an oppressive Boston matriarch. Psychiatrist Dr. 
Jaquith (Claude Rains) rescues Charlotte by sending her to a sanitarium, 
where her cure is signaled by the doctor's dramatic breaking of her 
eyeglasses (what "normal" woman needs them?) and her reemergence 
(set to a dramatic Max Steiner score) as movie star Bette Davis: gorgeous 
from plucked brows to two-toned pumps. This newly hatched butterfly 
goes on a cruise and falls in love with Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid), a 
married man; their romance is told largely through the expressive use 
of cigarettes, which imply the sex that is not seen on-screen. The plot 
spirals wonderfully out from there, ending with the decision not to 
pursue more than friendship with Charlotte's famous, if cryptic, lines: 
"Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars."  MO

"What he did to Shakespeare, we are now doing to Poland," jokes a 
German colonel about a hammy thespian in Ernst Lubitsch's outrageous 
wartime black comedy. In an age when nothing is too sacred or serious 
to be lampooned, it is difficult to imagine the controversy that originally 
surrounded Lubitsch's sparklingly witty, screamingly funny screwball 
anti-Nazi farce.
Lubitsch was a German Jew who settled in the United States in the 
1920s and made a string of smashing, inimitably stylish comedies. Even 
so, he was dubious when Melchior Lengyel, who conceived Lubitsch's 
Ninotchka (1939), pitched his concept about an acting troupe who 
impersonate members of the Gestapo to save Polish resistants. But 
eventually the director felt—and hoped—that Americans would be more 
concerned about Poland if he could arouse their sympathy through 
laughter by applying the celebrated Lubitsch Touch (with a sophisticated 
screenplay by Edwin Justus Mayer) to the Nazis and their adversaries.
Comic Jack Benny in his finest hour plays Josef Tura, vain actor-
manager of a theater company, forever at odds with his flirtatious wife 
and leading lady Maria, played by delicious Carole Lombard (who took 
the part over the misgivings of husband Clark Gable and was tragically 
killed before the film's release). After a battle-of-the-sexes setup, the 
Turas have bigger things to worry about—like the invasion of Poland—
and they become embroiled in espionage. The tone shifts with a betrayal 
and shifts again when Tura's bickering troupe puts aside their differences 
and devise an audacious masquerade to extract Maria and her Resistance 
hero admirer (Robert Stack) from Gestapo headquarters.
It has often been remarked that this is Lubitsch's funniest film because 
it is his most serious—proven by Mel Brooks's 1983 remake, which 
featured amusing mugging but missed the urgency of desperate deeds 
in a dangerous time. Sardonic laughs (like Tom Dugan's fiendish Hitler 
impersonation) do not obscure the substance of the satire, the film's 
insight into the evil ordinary men are capable of when they get a taste 
of power, or its engaging message that even egotistical actors can do 
something swell when they act like human beings.  AE

crash, her line "What can happen on

The Magnificent Ambersons  
Orson Welles & Fred Fleck, 1942
The unprecedented deal with RKO Pictures that Orson Welles signed in 
1940 for two films allowed total creative freedom, but within strict budgets. 
The Magnificent Ambersons is the second movie made under that contract, 
undertaken after the completion of Citizen Kane (1941) but before the wrath 
of William Randolph Hearst and Welles's own unreliable genius "wrecked" 
his career as a Hollywood filmmaker. Welles's desire to bring Booth 
Tarkington's novel The Ambersons to the big screen was a more personal 
project for him than Kane: He had already completed an adaptation of 
the novel with the Mercury Theatre, which was broadcast on radio.
Rooted in the turn-of-the-century world of the haute bourgeoisie 
that Welles remembered from his own childhood, The Magnificent 
Ambersons is the story of George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt), the 
talented but unlikable offspring of an aristocratic family who receives 
the comeuppance everyone wants for him. Apart from all the other 
parallels, Welles's suppressed first name was George. As this must have 
seemed not only autobiographical but, at the stage the film was being 
made, horribly prophetic, it is to Welles's credit that his ego let him cast 
Holt, a juvenile cowboy taking a rare serious role (as he would again only 
in 1948's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), as the lead.
The first seventy minutes are a revelation of creative genius, more 
than equaling Kane. The film opens with a charming but pointed lecture 
on male fashions, narrated by Welles and displayed by Joseph Cotten, 
then recreates precisely the cluttered, stuffy, lively, strange world of the 
Ambersons that is gradually torn apart by the twentieth century—
symbolized, presciently, by the motor car—and its own hidden 
weaknesses. Working with cinematographer Stanley Cortez rather than 
Gregg Toland, Welles crafts a film that is as visually striking as Kane, but 
that also manages a warmer, melancholy nostalgia for sleigh rides and 
cartes de visite even as it shows how the iniquities of a class-bound 
society constrain decent folk to lifelong misery. Enterprising Eugene 
(Cotten) loses his wellborn love, Isabel (Costello), to a clod from a 
prominent family but is unable to separate himself from the magnificence 
of the Ambersons, even as the march of time reduces it to pathetic shreds.
While Citizen Kane is all set pieces, The Magnificent Ambersons is 
seamless: Typical is a ballroom sequence in which the camera whirls 
through the dancers, picking up snatches of plot and dialogue, following 
a large cast, surrendering to music and history. It's a tragedy that Welles's 
original cut was taken away (admittedly, while he was enjoying himself 
in Brazil and not returning calls) and cut down. In the last ten minutes, 
the cast adopts fixed expressions as they struggle through a happy 
ending stuck on by someone else (probably editor Robert Wise), though 
Alfonso Arau's 2002 remake, which sticks to Welles's original scripted 
ending, found little favor: The magic was obviously unrepeatable.  KN

How terribly easy it would be from a postmodern, politically correct, and 
sophisticated perspective to regard Yankee Doodle Dandy as jingoistic 
propaganda. Indeed, this flag-waving musical extravaganza biopic, 
detailing the life of patriotic Irish-American song-and-dance man George 
M. Cohan (the first performer to be awarded the Congressional Medal of 
Honor), gushes with sentimental, simplistic musical numbers invariably 
characterized by Cohan's trademark stiff-kneed, effervescent, brash 
dancing style and championing through their lyrics the most stolid 
American institutions: "Grand Old Flag," "Give My Regards to Broadway," 
"Over There," and the title song, to name a few. The film is a flashback—
told by a modest Cohan to FDR—that ends with a self-conscious 
advertisement for intervention: "I wouldn't worry about this country if I 
were you. We've got this thing licked. Where else in the world could a 
plain guy like me come in and talk things over with the head man?"
But such a cynical reading would fail grossly to miss something 
surprising and touching and grand that runs through Yankee Doodle 
Dandy like a clear river, and that is James Cagney's magnificent sincerity 
in the title role. This is evident in his way of embarrassedly smiling to 
punctuate his thoughts, in his soft and civilized speaking voice; in the 
astonishing virtuosity of his dancing, which is persuasive and original 
in style, unrelentingly athletic while also being childish, playful, and 
beautifully meaningless; and in something we rarely see onscreen 
anymore since alienated distance has overtaken Hollywood 
performance, and that is Cagney's complete and loving belief in 
everything he does. Michael Curtiz's direction never overplays him, and 
James Wong Howe's lush black-and-white cinematography never fails 
to show every nuance of his posture and expression in articulate light. 
And when his hoofer father (Walter Huston) is falling away into death, 
with Georgie at his bedside, Cagney gives in to a rush of honest feeling 
that carries him into tears. So much, in fact, do we care for this man we 
forget we are watching a performance. Cagney has become Cohan. Even 
more, he has become the optimistic spirit of the screen.  MP

Of all the Hollywood movies made during World War II in support of 
America's allies, Mrs. Miniver remains the best known. Dated, sentimental, 
hopelessly over-idealized in its depiction of a phony rose-garden 
England, it still exerts surprising emotional impact. Based on a series of 
newspaper sketches by Jan Struther, it presents a supposedly archetypal 
English middle-class family living in a quaintly idyllic Kent village. Into 
this cozy world erupts the war: food rationing, bombing raids, and 
sudden death. The villagers, forgetting any previous differences, unite 
against the common foe. The Minivers' son, formerly a hot-headed left-
wing student, joins the Royal Air Force as a fighter pilot; Mr. Miniver 
(Walter Pidgeon) takes his small boat to Dunkirk to rescue British troops; 
and Mrs. Miniver (Greer Garson) copes heroically through it all.
At the end of the film the vicar preaches a defiant Churchillian 
sermon in the bombed-out village church. The congregation launches 
into "Onward Christian Soldiers," the camera lifts to gaze through the 
shattered roof—and four flights of Spitfires hurtle overhead as "Land 
of Hope and Glory" swells on the soundtrack.
Mrs. Miniver earned William Wyler his first Best Director Oscar—plus 
five more, including Best Picture. President Roosevelt was so taken with 
the vicar's sermon that he had it printed on leaflets to be dropped over 
German-occupied territories. And the film's effectiveness as propaganda 
was acknowledged by no less an authority than Dr. Joseph Goebbels. PK

Casablanca  Michael Curtiz, 1942
The most beloved Best Picture Oscar winner of all, this romantic war 
melodrama epitomizes the 1940s craze for studio-bound exotica, with 
the Warner Bros. lot transformed into a fantastical North Africa that has 
far more resonance than any mere real place possibly could. Casablanca 
also offers more cult performers, quotable lines, instant clichés, and 
Hollywood chutzpah than any other film of the movies' golden age.
Humphrey Bogart's Rick ("Of all the gin joints. . ."), in white dinner jacket 
or belted trenchcoat, and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa ("I know that I'll never have 
the strength to leave you again"), a vision in creations more suited to a 
studio floor than a desert city, moon over each other in a café-casino as 
that haunting tune ("As Time Goes By") tinkles in the background, 
transporting them back to a simpler life before the war soured everything. 
But the best performance comes from Claude Rains as cynical-but-romantic 
police chief Renault ("Round up the usual suspects"), a wry observer of life's 
absurdities who is at once an opportunist survivor and the film's truest 
romantic—fully deserving of the famous final moments ("Louis, I think 
this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship") that show it is he, not Ilsa, 
who is the fitting partner for Rick's newly-dedicated-to-freedom hero.
Also memorable in an enormous supporting cast: Paul Henreid's 
Czech patriot Victor Laszlo, leading the scum of the continent in a rousing 
rendition of "La Marseillaise" that drowns out the Nazi sing-along and 
restores even the most ardent collaborationists and parasites to patriotic 
fervor; Peter Lorre's hustler Ugarte, shyly admitting that he trusts Rick 
because the man despises him; Conrad Veidt's heel-clicking Nazi villain 
Major Strasser, reaching to make a phone call he'll never complete; 
Dooley Wilson's loyal Sam, stroking the piano and exchanging looks with 
the leads; S.Z. Sakall's blubbery majordomo Carl, a displaced Austro-
Hungarian sweating despite the ceiling fan; and Sydney Greenstreet's 
unlikely Arab-Italian entrepreneur Ferrari, squatting befezzed on what 
looks like a magic carpet. Even the extras are brilliantly cast, adding to 
the lively, seductive, populated feel of a movie that, more than any other, 
its fans have wanted to inhabit—an impulse that fuels Woody Allen's 
charming homage in Play It Again, Sam (1972).
Curtiz tells a complicated, gimmicky story, weighted down with 
exposition and structured around a midpoint Paris flashback that breaks 
most screenwriting rules, with so little fuss and so much confidence that 
the whole assembly seems seamless, though it was apparently rewritten 
from day to day so that Bergman did not know until the shooting of the 
final scene whether she would fly off with Henreid or stick around with 
Bogie. Cult greatness came about through its attitude, but also its rare 
sense of the incomplete: Made before the war was over, it dares to leave its 
characters literally up in the air or out in the desert, leaving its audience 
to wonder what happened to these people (whose petty problems don't 
amount to "a hill of beans") during the next few turbulent years.  KN

The Val Lewton/RKO-produced horror films of the 1940s are a high 
point of the horror genre, films renowned for a subtle aura of dread 
rather than gross special effects. Cat People, directed by Jacques 
Tourneur, presents the tragic tale of Irena the cat-woman, who fears she 
will destroy those she loves most.
Ollie Reed (Kent Smith) spots sweet and sexy Irena Dubrovna 
(Simone Simon) sketching the black panther at the zoo. Their whirlwind 
romance leads to marriage, but signs of trouble show up early. Irena 
seems obsessed with the big cats and listens to their cries ("like a 
woman") in the night. But when Ollie takes a cute kitten home to her, it 
hisses and spits. "Strange," the pet store owner tells Ollie, "cats can 
always tell if there's something not right about a person." What's wrong 
with Irena remains fundamentally ambiguous, and that is a strength of 
this film. Is she a repressed young woman afraid to consummate her 
marriage, as her psychiatrist (Tom Conway) implies, or heir to the evil 
Satan-worshipping witches of her home village back in Serbia? Irena fears 
that strong passions of lust, jealousy, or anger will unleash the murderous 
panther within her. These passions do run amuck: In one scene she 
destroys her amorous shrink, and in other scary sequences she stalks her 
rival Alice (Jane Randolph), who works with Ollie and also loves him.
Cat People will not scare the pants off you, but neither does it overdo 
the sexual angle as did the ludicrous Paul Schrader remake of 1982, with 
its bondage scenes and graphic violence. It is creepily effective, particularly 
in its use of light and shadows. In a justly famous scene, Irena follows Alice 
to a swimming pool, forcing her to tread water in panic while mysterious 
sounds erupt and shadows flicker across reflections of watery light.
Alice is likable as "the new kind of other woman"—smart, independent, 
decent, and caring. Ollie is probably too bland to merit the love of such 
wonderful women. It is Irena who remains central and lingers in the 
viewer's mind, one of horror's most sympathetic monsters (like Boris 
Karloff as the Frankenstein creature). Simon is charming—a bit "off" with 
her catlike visage, sweet, sad, and unwillingly dangerous.  CFr

Humphrey Jennings's wartime classic was previewed in a longer version 
with a more attention-grabbing title, I Was a Fireman, which was oddly 
unsuitable for its resolutely collectivist vision of blitzed Britain. In 1942, 
Fires Were Started was considered a "documentary" and set against the 
commercial tradition of filmmaking, hailed as more authentic than an 
Ealing fiction film on the same subject, The Bells Go Down (also 1943). 
Now, its use of nonprofessional actors who happened to be real firemen 
playing fictionally named characters in an archetypal story of a day on 
shift and a fire at night under a full moon ("a bomber's moon") looks far 
more like Neorealism or even straight off-Hollywood filmmaking. There 
is some newsreel stock footage, but the fire station is a set and the fire 
consists of physical effects. 
Among the cast are Fred Griffiths, who went pro and became a 
familiar character actor, and—in the role of the ad exec newbie who is 
shown the ropes—William Sansom, who became a writer of interestingly 
creepy short fiction. It's the epitome of Angus Calder's "Myth of the Blitz," 
with a cross-class, even multicultural (we see an East End Chinaman) 
group knuckling down to get the job done.
The fiery finale, in which a blaze is controlled before it sets light to a 
munitions ship, delivers action and suspense. But Jennings seems less 
stirred by it than the acutely observed buildup in which he catches the 
men singing round the piano, playing pool, training, doing menial work-
related tasks, and generally acting like real people.  KN

A key film in the history of the Western, The Ox-Bow Incident was one of 
many made in the 1940s that showed that the Western—previously a 
genre with low cultural prestige—could take on important issues. In a 
small Nevada town in 1885, a rumor spreads that a local rancher has 
been killed by rustlers. While the sheriff is out of town, a lynch mob is 
formed and captures three passing strangers. Despite their protestations 
of innocence, the men are hanged, only for the perpetrators to discover 
the rancher is not dead and the real rustlers have been apprehended.
This concise little film (only seventy-five minutes long) packs a good 
deal of star power. Henry Fonda is a local cowboy, shown initially as a 
thoughtless saloon brawler, who eventually stands up against the mob. 
The three victims are played by Dana Andrews, a patently innocent 
family man; Anthony Quinn, a Mexican drifter; and Francis Ford, brother 
of the more illustrious John, a senile old man. Frank Conroy is excellent 
as a blustering ex-Confederate major who bullies his son into helping 
with the hanging, and Jane Darwell, notable as Ma Joad in John Ford's 
The Grapes of Wrath three years earlier, is a merciless old cattlewoman.
The Ox-Bow Incident makes a powerful plea for the rule of law as the 
basis of civilization. Besides Fonda, the only townspeople who resist the 
mob hysteria are a storekeeper (Harry Davenport) and a black preacher 
(Leigh Whipper), who has more reason than most to protest, having 
seen his own brother lynched. At the end, when the truth has sunk in, 
Fonda shames the mob by reading out a letter written by Andrews's 
character to his wife.
Darryl Zanuck, head of 20th Century Fox at the time, insisted the film 
be cheaply shot on studio sets; in fact, the confined spaces give The 
Ox-Bow Incident a greater intensity than it might have derived from 
expansive Western landscapes. The script is based on a highly 
accomplished first novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, a Nevadan whose 
later novel, Track of the Cat, was also filmed by William Wellman.  EB

Meshes of the Afternoon  
Maya Deren & Alexander Hammid, 1943
A famous image from Meshes of the Afternoon shows its auteur and star, 
Maya Deren, at a window, tree leaves reflected in the glass; she looks out 
wistfully, hands on the pane. This image has since appeared many times, 
but it remains a vivid, dreamy, terrifying picture of women's confinement.
Meshes comes from a branch of the American avant-garde taken with 
the surrealist journey of a figure through an ever-changing dreamscape. 
Deren, working from her own fantasies and shooting in her own home, 
made an intuitive leap that has given the film its lasting resonance. Her 
vision of Los Angeles links this impulse with an atmosphere that is proto-
film noir in its use of architecture and interior design, not to mention its 
atmosphere of dread and menace. This was one of the first films to make 
the indelible link between a woman's gothic experience of coming 
unglued and the sunny spaces of home. For Deren, it is the domestic 
everyday that lays the meshes that ensnare and traumatize women.
Deren's extraordinary body language in Meshes marries choreography 
to ordinary rituals, another combination that influenced women's cinema 
for decades. She used her movements as a way to trigger montage, to 
suggest rhythmic forms and create pictorial shapes: In this flux of dream 
projections, she is the only anchor. Yet, for all her movement, the last 
shot of Meshes reveals that this modern heroine has probably not even 
moved from her lounge chair. But what she has imagined manages to 
destroy her; this is the tale of a death drive, of a dream that kills.  AM

Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey) is a veteran of both the Boer War 
and World War I, twice retired, who believes that all of life's conflicts can 
be met with honor and decorum. He doesn't realize that the world has 
changed around him, and that his old-fashioned dictums of behavior 
may no longer apply in the World War II arena, yet with the stubbornness 
of a good soldier he holds firm to his beliefs and hurtles forward.
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger made The Life and Death of 
Colonel Blimp at the height of World War II, when London was being 
bombed nightly by the Germans. A comedy of manners may not 
appear the best way to address current events, but the Powell-
Pressburger team once again comes through, delicately revealing the 
horrible truth of modern warfare with grace and humor. It doesn't hurt 
that they tell the story through three romances, as Livesey woos the 
ever-luminous Deborah Kerr (in three different roles) over the years. It 
all adds up to one of the most ambitious and impressive achievements 
of not just Powell and Pressburger but in all of British cinema.  JKl

The Seventh Victim  Mark Robson, 1943
Perhaps the best of the run of terrific RKO horror films produced by Val 
Lewton in the 1940s, The Seventh Victim is a strikingly modern, 
poetically doom-laden picture. Naive orphan Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) 
comes to Manhattan in search of her strange elder sister Jacqueline 
(Jean Brooks, with a memorable Cleopatra wig) and learns she was 
mixed up with a sect of chic diabolists who now want to drive her to 
suicide for betraying their cult.
Director Mark Robson stages several remarkable suspense 
sequences—two Satanists trying to get rid of a corpse in a crowded 
subway train, Brooks's pursuit through the city by sinister figures and 
her own neuroses—and indulges in weirdly arty touches that take the 
horror film away from traditional witchcraft toward something very 
like existential angst. The Seventh Victim is full of things that must have 
been startling in 1943 and are still unusual now: a gaggle of varied 
lesbian characters (not all unsympathetic), a heroine who comes to 
seem as calculating as the villains, and a desperate finish that contrasts 
a dying woman (Elizabeth Russell) dressed up to go out on the town 
for the last time with the end-of-her-tether Jacqueline as she shuts 
herself up in a grim rented room to hang herself.  KN

The Man in Grey  Leslie Arliss, 1943
English cinema is perhaps best known for realist dramas, but an 
important second tradition is the costume melodrama, of which The 
Man in Grey is probably the finest example and one of the more popular 
films Gainsborough Studios ever made. The plot is fairly forgettable, 
involving two young women whose lives interestingly intersect. Clarissa 
(Phyllis Calvert) marries the cruelly indifferent Marquis of Rohan (James 
Mason), but her friend Hesther (Margaret Lockwood) introduces her to 
another rogue, the bold and immoral Rokeby (Stewart Granger). Soon 
the pair have switched partners, but all ends badly as Clarissa dies 
miserably and the crazed Marquis beats Hesther to death.
The plot, however, derived from a subliterary novel by Lady Eleanor 
Smith, is not the main focus of director Leslie Arliss's efforts. Calvert and 
Lockwood turn in suitably intense performances as the contrasting 
blonde- and dark-haired leads, and Mason is effectively reptilian as the 
Marquis. But the real star of the film is its art design. Regency period 
England is faithfully resurrected, with its ornate interior decor and 
European furniture, and its elaborate and elegant dress for actors and 
actresses alike. The sumptuous look of The Man in Grey provides a perfect 
contrast to its exploration of the dark underside of aristocratic life, 
with the story's gothic elements eliciting a suitable frisson from the 
absorbed viewer.  RBP

When interviewed by admirer and famous acolyte François Truffaut, 
Alfred Hitchcock referred to Shadow of a Doubt as his favorite film. 
Tellingly, it's also one of his least flashy works, a quiet character study set 
in the heart of suburbia. Although the heart of his suburbia is still rotten 
with murder and deceit, Hitchcock emphasizes traditional suspense 
beats over intricate set pieces, stocking the story with just as much 
uneasy humor as tension.
Charlie (Teresa Wright) is elated when her uncle and namesake 
Charlie (played to smarmy perfection by Joseph Cotten) comes to visit 
her and her mother. She soon suspects her revered Uncle Charlie is 
actually a serial killer, "the Merry Widow Murderer," on the run from his 
latest killing. Once on to her suspicions, her Uncle Charlie doesn't seem 
interested in leaving behind any loose ends, but the younger Charlie 
doesn't know how to reconcile her affection for her uncle with her fears.
Hitchcock actually shot Shadow of a Doubt on location, in the small 
town of Santa Rosa, California, the better to tear apart the flimsy façade 
and expose the bland, safe suburbs for the hotbed of secrets it no doubt 
is. The script, written by Thornton Wilder with input from Hitchcock's 
wife Alma Reville, takes perverse glee in destroying preconceived notions 
of quiet, small-town life. The film is also peppered with numerous 
references to twins and the duality of good and evil, paralleling the 
trustful and innocent Charlie with her dangerous and deceitful uncle.
Dimitri Tiomkin's score keeps the suspense ratcheted up, particularly 
his use of Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" waltz—the signifier of Uncle 
Charlie's guilt and the haunting motif that represents the horrific 
inclinations he can barely disguise or suppress. Charlie's father and a 
neighbor also offer a running commentary, discussing the various 
means and methods by which a murder might be committed and then 
covered up. That a real murderer lurks right next door provides dollops 
of ironic humor. The men continue to ruminate on various homicidal 
scenarios as Charlie races to settle her conflicted feelings for her Uncle 
Charlie before he permanently does it for her.  JKl

One of the great speculative games one can play with cinema history 
centers on Luchino Visconti's Ossessione: What if this had been the 
picture that heralded the arrival of an exciting new film movement from 
Italy, and not Roberto Rossellini's Open City in 1945? It would have 
indeed been interesting, but alas we'll never know; because Visconti's 
screenplay was clearly lifted from James M. Cain's The Postman Always 
Rings Twice, Cain and his publishers kept it off American screens until 
1976, when it had its much belated premiere at the New York Film 
Festival. Cain had just died and probably never saw it—a pity, because 
he would have discovered the best cinematic adaptation of his work.
Massimo Girotti is Gino Costa, a sweaty, T-shirt-clad drifter who lands 
a job in a roadside café run by portly opera buff Bragana (Juan de 
Landa). Bragana has a wife, Giovanna (the luminous Clara Calamai, 
Rossellini's first choice for the Anna Magnani role in Open City), and it 
isn't long before Gino and Giovanna are in each others arms, making 
plans to get away. Adhering closely to Cain's storyline, Visconti is aided 
by the sheer physical chemistry between Calamai and Girotti; all of Cain's 
descriptions of burning flesh and animal lust are rendered in Ossessione 
with an almost frightening intensity. Consequently, the whole economic 
imperative for the eventual murder takes somewhat of a backseat here. 
Visconti also doesn't avoid the obviously homoerotic overtones of Gino's 
relationship with "lo Spagnolo" (Elio Marcuzzo), a Spanish street 
performer with whom he goes on the road for a while, rather remarkable 
when one considers the film was made under the Fascist regime.
One scene that surely would have delighted Cain, himself the son of 
an opera singer, is Bragana's performance in a local opera competition. 
A gruff and unapproachable figure—a far cry from Cecil Kellaway's 
bumbling fool in Tay Garnett's 1946 Hollywood version of the novel—he 
suddenly comes alive as he bursts into an aria, bringing the assembled 
listeners to their feet. Ossessione could have been the great example of 
the union of American film noir and Italian Neorealism; instead, it remains 
something like the ancestral missing link for both movements.  RP

Men adore her. Women admire her. Yet alluring young designer Laura 
Hunt (Gene Tierney) doesn't take center stage in Laura, any more 
than her chilly socialite friend Ann (Judith Anderson), her duplicitous 
suitor Shelby (Vincent Price), or hard-boiled detective Mark McPherson 
(Dana Andrews), who, searching for her murderer, falls in love with 
her ghost. But viciously smarmy author-broadcaster Waldo Lydecker 
(Clifton Webb) utterly fascinates, adopting Laura as his protégée, 
making her famous, then fixating upon her life like a spider who has her 
in its web.
If Otto Preminger's Laura intrigues in its jarring mélange of styles—
noir psychodrama, melodrama, and crime thriller—then in brief 
moments of portraiture it becomes monumental. Particularly notable 
scenes include Ann explaining to Laura why it should be she who has 
Shelby ("We're both losers") and the romantic tryst at the police station 
when, turning off the glaring third-degree lights, Mark sees Laura's true 
radiance. But paramount is Lydecker's poisonous poise when he regales 
Laura with Shelby's faults. "I'll call him," she says anxiously. "He's not 
there," Waldo acidly retorts, "He's dining with Ann, didn't you know?" 
More than doting upon her life, he is inhabiting it, perhaps narrative 
cinema's first example of a man who wishes he were a woman.  MP

Meet Me in St. Louis  Vincente Minnelli, 1944
A little girl named Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), crying and angry, breaks 
domestic rank and runs out to the snow. Once there, she sets to 
destroying her beloved snowmen—a symbol of everything that is stable 
and reassuring in her familial existence—with a vigor and venom that is 
extremely disquieting. Who would ever have thought that Judy Garland 
singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" could have such a 
devastating effect on a child's delicate psyche—or, indeed, on ours?
Vincente Minnelli's Meet Me in St. Louis is one of the most unusual 
and highly charged musicals in Hollywood history. It blends the two 
genres at which Minnelli was most adept—musical and melodrama—
and even, in its darkest moments (such as a sequence devoted to 
Halloween terrors), edges toward being a horror movie. It is also a film 
that, then as now, offers itself up to be read in starkly contrasting ways: 
either as a perfectly innocent and naïve celebration of traditional family 
values, or else a brooding meditation on everything that tears the 
family unit apart from within. Put another way, is it comforting, "safety 
valve" entertainment that admits to just enough that is problematic in 
order to smooth out and reinforce the status quo, or is it—almost 
despite itself—a subversive gesture at the heart of the Hollywood 
system, a howl of unrepressed rage like Tootie's slaughter of imaginary 
snow people?
Yes, this is the same film in which Garland moons and croons "The 
Boy Next Door" and—in a showstopping highlight—sways with a pack 
of colorful passengers as she belts out "The Trolley Song" ("Zing, zing, 
zing went my heartstrings. . . ."). Minnelli's project is quietly ambitious: 
not merely to tell the story of a lovably "average" family—and the 
challenges it stoically faces—but to also sketch the history of a bold new 
twentieth-century society defined by events such as the World's Fair.
Minnelli's artistic sensibility—his sexuality is either an open question 
or an open secret, depending on which Hollywood history you consult—
responded well to female yearning and male anxiety, and an excess of 
both makes this musical unfailingly melodramatic. Patriarchy comes in 
the cuddly, grumpy form of Leon Ames, valiantly trying to assert his 
authority in the face of an overwhelmingly female household. The 
parade of boyfriends for the girls have likewise to be prodded, 
manipulated, and informed of their rightful, mating destiny.
As for the aesthetic challenges of the musical, Minnelli and his 
collaborators went a long way toward integrating singing and dancing 
into a whimsical, fairy tale flow of incidents. Songs begin as throwaway 
phrases, spoken or hummed out in the street or at the door; they 
suddenly die away as a plot intrigue kicks in. Beneath the elegant display 
of filmic style, and the civilized veneer of manners, it is only Tootie who 
can express emotions that are savage and untamed—as her "exotica" 
duet with Judy, "Under the Bamboo Tree," jovially indicates.  AM

"I want to make this into 
the most delightful piece 
of Americana ever."
Arthur Freed, Meet Me in 
St. Louis producer, 1944


Coscripted by two Nobel Prize-winners, Ernest Hemingway and William 
Faulkner, allegedly from Hemingway's book of the same title, To Have 
and Have Not was mainly improvised by director Howard Hawks and his 
peerless cast. One of a run of films made after Humphrey Bogart's 
triumph in Casablanca (1942), this even more romantic picture offers a 
central love affair that threatens to edge World War II offscreen. Hawks, 
who discovered Lauren Bacall before Bogart did, eventually felt betrayed 
by his stars' marriage, but he also in great part created the characters the 
couple wound up playing in real life.
Set in Vichy, Martinique, as opposed to the novel's Cuba, To Have and 
Have Not once again has Bogart's Yankee ex-pat caught up with the Free 
French and finally committing to the allied cause. The real-life electricity 
sparking between Bogie and a debuting Bacall, as the girl who drifts into 
his life and takes over, leads to a sassy, upbeat ending that sends you 
home with a greater glow even than the wistful resignation of Casablanca. 
Unlike Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) in the earlier film, who 
choose the greater good over love, Harry and Slim rescue each other 
from isolationism and are able to maintain their relationship because 
they are willing to work together to win the war. Hawks would have no 
patience with a woman who saw her job solely in terms of making a 
happy home life for the hero and so makes Bacall's Slim as intrepid and 
daring as Bogart's Harry—not just a love interest, but a partner.
Hawks packs every scene in To Have and Have Not with relishable 
business: hilarious but sexy love talk between the stars ("You do know 
how to whistle?"); comedy relief sidekick Walter Brennan asking, "Was 
you ever stung by a dead bee?"; Hoagy Carmichael singing "Hong Kong 
Blues" and accompanying a husky Bacall (or is it Andy Williams's voice?) 
on "How Little We Know?"; and Bogie snarling at various petty officials 
and nasty fascists with the genuine voice of a democratic wiseguy who 
won't put up with any totalitarian nonsense. When John Huston didn't 
have an ending for his 1948 Bogart-Bacall thriller Key Largo, Hawks gave 
him the shootout-on-a-boat finish of Hemingway's novel that he had 
never got around to including in this film.  KN

Gaslight  George Cukor, 1944
195
George Cukor's Hollywood version of an earlier British gothic romance 
is heavy on threatening atmosphere, with a spine-chilling thriller plot. 
Paula Alquist (Ingrid Bergman) finds herself wooed by the attractive, if 
strangely possessive, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer), who seems more 
interested in the London house Paula owns than in the rather timid 
woman herself. It turns out that Anton is a clever thief who, some ten 
years before, had killed Paula's aunt in a failed attempt to steal her 
fabulously valuable jewels. As he systematically ransacks Paula's house 
by night, he does his best to convince her, and others, that she is losing 
her mind. His intention is to put her entirely under his power so that he 
can have a free hand searching the house. Anton's plot, however, is 
discovered by Brian Cameron (Joseph Cotten), who, falling in love with 
the woman he sees mistreated and threatened, intervenes just in time 
to save her from worse.
While Gaslight's plot is somewhat thin, Cukor draws fine performances 
from an ensemble cast, including newcomer Angela Lansbury as a saucy 
servant who, like everything and everyone else in the house, seems to

persecution and paranoia, Gaslight makes an elegant period-piece

Henry V  Laurence Olivier, 1944
Henry V was regarded by the British government as ideal patriotic 
wartime propaganda, and Laurence Olivier, serving in the Fleet Air Arm, 
was released to star in it and—after William Wyler had turned it down—
to direct it as well. Aiming to preserve both Shakespeare's innately 
theatrical artifice and the protocinematic sweep of his imagination, 
Olivier hit on the device of framing the film within a production in the 
Globe Theatre itself. As Henry V opens, the camera soars over a detailed 
miniature of Elizabethan London, down into the bustle of the Globe 
audience, and into a high-flown stage performance—only to expand 
exhilaratingly into cinematic space as the action moves toward France.
Throughout, the film plays with different levels of stylization, from 
the scenes at the French court—which borrow the exquisite colors and 
naïve perspectives of medieval miniature paintings—to the realism of 
the battle scenes, inspired in their exuberant dynamism by Sergei 
Eisenstein's Aleksandr Nevsky (1938). The rhythm of Shakespeare's text, 
discreetly trimmed to fit the war effort—the three English traitors are 
dropped, for a start—is buoyed up by the vigor of Olivier's barnstorming 
performance and William Walton's sweeping score. Henry V is the first 
Shakespeare film that succeeds in being at once truly Shakespearean 
and wholly cinematic.  PK

Double Indemnity  Billy Wilder, 1944
Adapted by director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler from the 
hard-boiled novel by James M. Cain, Double Indemnity is the archetypal 
film noir, the tale of a desperate dame and a greedy man, of murder for 
sordid profit and sudden, violent betrayal. Yet it has a weird, evocative 
romanticism ("How could I have known that murder can sometimes 
smell like honeysuckle?") and pays off, extraordinarily for 1944, with a 
confession not only of murder but also of love between two men. The 
last line, addressed by dying Fred MacMurray to heartbroken Edward G. 
Robinson, is "I love you, too."
A wounded man staggers by night into a Los Angeles insurance 
company office, and settles down at his desk to dictate confessional 
notes on "the Dietrichson claim." He introduces himself as "Walter Neff, 
insurance salesman, thirty-five years old, unmarried, no visible scars—
until a while ago, that is." MacMurray spent his whole career, first at 
Paramount then at Disney and finally in sitcoms, as a genial nice guy, 
always smiling, always folksy; twice (his other change-of-pace, also for 
Wilder, is The Apartment) he crawled behind his smile and marvelously 
played a complete heel, his cleft chin sweaty and in need of a shave, his 
smooth salesman's talk a cover for lechery, larceny, and murderous intent. 
The bait that tempts this average nobody off the straight and narrow 
comes fresh from a sunbath, barely wrapped in a towel, flashing an ankle 
bracelet. Calling at a fake Spanish mansion on Los Feliz Boulevard about 
an auto policy renewal, Neff encounters Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara 
Stanwyck) and can't resist putting verbal moves on her. Neff backs off 
when she innocently asks if it's possible to insure her older husband (Tom 
Powers) against accidental death without him knowing about it. Neff 
mulls it over and, after an embrace in his apartment, agrees to pitch in 
with the murder plan.
The couple trick Mr. D into signing up for a policy that pays off double 
if death occurs on a train, then arrange it so his broken-necked corpse is 
found on the railroad tracks. Enter Barton Keyes (Robinson), a claims 
investigator of Columbo-like tenacity whose only blind spot is his 
devotion to Neff. Keyes fusses around the case, ruling out suicide in a 
brilliant speech about the unlikeliness of suicide by jumping from a train, 
homing in on the gamey blonde as a murderess, and rooting around for 
her partner in crime. Keyes doesn't even have to do much work, because 
postkilling pressures are already splitting Neff and Phyllis apart, as they 
try not to panic during meets in a local supermarket and come to suspect 
each other of additional double crosses. In that stifling, shadowed 
mansion, with "Tangerine" on the radio and honeysuckle in the air, the 
lovers riddle each other with bullets, and Neff staggers away to confess. 
Keyes joins him in the office and sadly catches the end of the story. Neff 
asks for four hours so he can head for Mexico, but Keyes knows, "You'll 
never make the border. You'll never even make the elevator."  KN

Murder, My Sweet  Edward Dmytryk, 1944
Farewell, My Lovely
The first screen adaptation of Raymond Chandler's second novel, 
Farewell, My Lovely was The Falcon Takes Over, a 1942 quickie in which 
Chandler's private eye, Philip Marlowe, was replaced by George 
Sanders's gentleman sleuth. When Chandler's reputation rose, RKO 
found it no longer had to pay for the film rights to mount this more 
faithful adaptation, in which ex-crooner Dick Powell surprised 
audiences with his wry toughness and bruised romanticism as the first 
proper screen incarnation of Marlowe. The title change came about 
because it was assumed that audiences would mistake it for a schmaltzy 
wartime romance, though the novel's title was retained in Britain, 
where Chandler was already a respected figure.
The book was one of several Marlowe novels Chandler wrought by 
cannibalizing several earlier, cruder novellas, which explains why it has 
several plot threads that turn out to intersect via the odd, unlikely 
coincidence. Murder, My Sweet opens with Marlowe blinded and 
interrogated by the cops, allowing for the retention of much of Chandler's 
first-person commentary, as flashbacks take the hero through a puzzle 
that begins with ex-con "Moose" Malloy (Mike Mazurki) hiring Marlowe 
to track down the ex-girlfriend who sold him out but with whom he is 
still smitten. The story takes a left turn when he is also retained by slinky 
society vamp Helen Grayle (Claire Trevor) to get back some stolen jade 
and see off a blackmailing "psychic consultant" (Otto Kruger).
No other film so perfectly encapsulates the pleasures of film noir, as 
director Edward Dmytryk deploys shadows, rain, drug-induced 
hallucinations ("a black pool opened up"), and sudden bursts of violence 
within a cobweb of plot traps, slimy master crooks, worthless femmes 
fatales, gorilla-brained thugs, weary cops, and quack doctors. Powell's 
Marlowe, striking a match on Cupid's marble bottom and playing 
hopscotch on the tiled floor of a millionaire's mansion, is closer to 
Chandler's tone of boyish insolence than better-known readings of the 
role by Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum.  KN

Ivan the Terrible recounts the rise and fall of one of Russia's most famous 
Czars, Ivan IV. It was conveived as a trilogy, the filming for which began 
in the early 1940s upon Stalin's request. Eisenstein could only complete 
parts I and II, however, because of his premature death. Part I came out 
in 1945, whereas Part II underwent governmental censorship: Stalin saw 
in it a critique of his own despotism and banned the movie. Part II was 
finally released in 1958 after both Eisenstein's and Stalin's deaths.
Part I focuses on Ivan's (Nikolai Cherkasov) establishment of power 
and shows the favor of the peasants. Part II narrates the schemes of the 
Boyars in their attempt to assassinate Ivan and reveals the progressive 
cruelty of the Czar, who creates his own police to keep the country under 
control. Ivan discovers the plots against him and defeats his enemies by 
killing them. The acting is particularly staged: Eisenstein makes strong 
use of extreme close-ups and seems more interested with the characters' 
reactions to the events than with the events themselves. 
Alexander Nevsky (1938) and Ivan the Terrible are Eisenstein's only 
non-silent films. If one compares the latter to his silent movies of the 
1920s, not only can a change in style be detected, but also a change in 
the very themes narrated. Eisenstein here renounces the depiction of 
the proletarian struggles at the heart of his previous films, turning 
instead to an epic story, one connected to a "safe" past that does not 
involve manifest critiques of contemporary political events.  CFe
In Part II, a curiosity can be found in 
the use of two color scenes in a 
movie that is mostly black and white.

Mildred Pierce  Michael Curtiz, 1945
Gunshots crack in the night and a dying man gasps "Mildred!" In a 
flashback classic that goes back to the genesis of obsession and murder, 
the mink-clad confessor Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford in the Oscar-
winning role that revived the forty-one-year-old fading star's stalled 
career) explains in a police interrogation how she toiled her way from 
housewife, waitress, and pie baker to prosperous restaurateur in order 
to fulfill her daughter Veda's (Ann Blyth) demands for the finer things. 
When they are both fatefully drawn in by a smooth, duplicitous cad 
(Zachary Scott), the possessive Mildred's smothering, neurotic 
indulgence and the ungrateful Veda's precocious appetites inevitably 
boil over in sexual betrayal and rage.
A definitive 1940s women's picture and a seething domestic soap 
opera, Michael Curtiz's film, adapted by Ranald MacDougall from a 
breathtakingly perverse novel by James M. Cain (of Double Indemnity 
and The Postman Always Rings Twice fame), is also a superbly nasty noir, 
one that plays havoc with the era's ideals of maternal devotion and 
mom's apple pie. Mildred is admirable for her hard work and self-
sacrifice. She is smart, ambitious, and driven, qualities respected and 
rewarded in the American ethic. But gradually, as she detaches from her 
decent but unsuccessful husband (Bruce Bennett), and as she favors the 
insolent Veda over her sweeter younger daughter, putting the child's 
death behind her with no evident afterthought, we begin to sense an 
unhealthy, even pathological, aspect to Mildred's compulsion.
Throbbing melodrama doesn't come with more conviction. Even to 
those usually turned off by the tough, square-shouldered Crawford, her 
intense, no-holds-barred performance as Mildred is tragically twisted 
and compelling. Blyth, only seventeen, is sneeringly sensational as the 
disdainful femme fatale. A director who imposed his personality on films 
in every genre, Curtiz's masterly deployment of his actors (sterling support 
players such as Eve Arden, Jack Carson, and Lee Patrick) and the disparate 
technical elements—Gone with the Wind's Oscar-winning cinematographer 
Ernest Haller's expressive shifts from sunny suburbia to shadowy 
nightmare, and Max Steiner's dramatic score—are intoxicating.  AE

Detour  Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945
201
"Fate or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no 
good reason at all." One of the greatest of all B-movies, Detour makes no 
attempt to rise above its budget and brief shooting schedule, instead 
reveling in its cheapness, presenting a world somewhere between pulp 
fiction and existentialism where life has low production values and a 
short running time.
A grubby jazz musician (Tom Neal) hitchhikes across country, 
descending into an on-the-road hell as a driver drops dead, 
incriminating him. He hooks up with a trampy woman (Ann Savage) 
who leads him to degradation and murder, climaxing in an unforgettable 
tussle in a tawdry motel room in which a telephone cord gets tangled 
up around the woman's neck.
Edgar G. Ulmer, a German Expressionist toiling along Poverty Row, 
was a more pretentious filmmaker than his admirers will admit, but this 
is the one genuine masterpiece from his time in the Z-trenches. The 
unknown stars (real-life loser Neal later did time for murder) are 
resolutely unglamorous, and the studio sets, anonymous roadsides, and 
back-projected landscapes conjure up a world spiraling out of control—
one where the coincidence-driven plotting of a thrown-together 
B-picture script can suggest the malign hand of merciless destiny.  KN
I Know Where I'm Going!  
Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger, 1945
I Know Where I'm Going! stands tall as one of the most perfect of the run 
of delirious masterpieces made by the team of Michael Powell and 
Emeric Pressburger in the 1940s. Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller), very sexy 
in smart suits, is the practical postwar English miss who travels to the 
Hebrides to marry a millionaire old enough to be her father. But when 
bad weather postpones the final leg of her journey, she finds her 
determined gold-digging sidetracked by an island-load of strange 
Scots who arrange for her to be diverted into the arms of her 
predestined lover Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey), the local penniless 
squire and war hero.
Aside from being the only filmmakers who could get away with 
naming a romantic hero "Torquil," Powell and Pressburger go against the 
cynical vision of conniving, drunken Scots islanders found in Ealing 
Studio's 1949 Whisky Galore!, presenting a crew who are just as devious 
but working for good ends. Joan's urban toughness is quickly 
overwhelmed with lots of Celtic legend involving the local whirlpool, 
which represents the gods and allows for an exciting rescue-at-sea 
finale. In a large supporting cast, Pamela Brown is especially memorable 
as the spookily alluring local girl, Catriona Potts.  KN

The Lost Weekend  Billy Wilder, 1945
Before The Lost Weekend, drunkards in Hollywood movies were mostly 
figures of fun, indeed of farce—lovable buffoons reeling around uttering 
slurred witticisms and making hopeless passes at pretty girls. Billy Wilder 
and his regular coscreenwriter, Charles Brackett, dared to do something 
different, creating American cinema's first adult, intelligent, unsparing 
look at the grim degradation of alcoholism. Even today, some of the 
scenes are almost too painful to watch.
Ray Milland, in a career-defining role that netted him an Oscar, plays 
a New York writer, Don Birnam, struggling with and finally succumbing 
to his craving over the space of one long, parched summer weekend in 
the city. Just as he had done with Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity 
(1944), Wilder ferrets out and avidly exploits the insecurity behind 
Milland's bland screen persona. Rather than letting us stand back and 
judge in detached compassion, Wilder pulls us along with Birnam on his 
downward trajectory. We're obliged to accompany him as he sheds all 
his remaining moral scruples, showing himself ready to lie, cheat, and 
steal to get money for drink, until with awful inevitability he ends up in 
the hell of a public hospital's alcoholics ward, screaming in horror at the 
hallucinations of delirium tremens.
Parts of the film were shot on Manhattan locations, and Wilder makes 
the most of the dry, sun-bleached streets, shot by his director of 
photography John F. Seitz to look bleak and tawdry, as if through 
Birnam's bleary, self-loathing gaze. In one unforgettable sequence, the 
writer, reduced to trying to hock his typewriter to raise funds for booze, 
traipses the dusty length of Third Avenue dragging the heavy machine—
only to realize that it's Yom Kippur and all the pawnshops are closed. 
Even more harrowing is the scene in a smart nightclub where Birman 
succumbs to temptation and tries to filch money from a woman's 
handbag—only to be caught and humiliatingly thrown out while the 
club pianist leads the clientele in a chorus of "Somebody stole her purse" 
(to the tune of "Somebody Stole My Gal"). And Miklós Rózsa's score makes 
masterly use of the theremin, that early electronic instrument whose 
eerie, swooping tone perfectly conjures up Birnam's woozy, out-of-
control vision of the world.
The strictures of the Hays Code imposed a happy ending, though 
Wilder and Brackett managed to sidestep anything too mindlessly 
reassuring. Even so, Paramount was convinced the movie was doomed 
to failure, with an alarmed liquor industry offering the studio $5 million 
to bury the film altogether. Prohibitionists, on the other hand, were up 
in arms, claiming the film would encourage drinking. In any event, The 
Lost Weekend was a major critical and commercial hit. "It was after this 
picture," Wilder noted, "that people started taking me seriously." No 
subsequent film on alcoholism, or any other form of addiction, has been 
able to avoid a nod to The Lost Weekend.  PK

Ever since its triumphant premiere in the newly liberated France of 1945, 
The Children of Paradise has maintained its place as one of the greatest 
French films of all time. It represents the high point of the genre often 
called "poetic realism" and also of the partnership that perfected that 
genre—that of screenwriter Jacques Prévert and director Marcel Carné. 
They made an oddly assorted couple: Prévert gregarious, passionate, 
highly committed politically, one of the finest popular French poets of 
the century; Carné remote, fastidious, withdrawn, a cool perfectionist. 
Yet together they created cinematic magic that neither man could equal 
after they parted. The Children of Paradise was their last great success.
The film was some eighteen months in production and involved 
building the largest studio set in the history of French cinema—the 
quarter-mile of street frontage representing the "Boulevard du Crime," 
the theater district of Paris in the 1830s and 1840s. This would have been 
a daunting enterprise at the best of times; in wartime France, under the 
conditions of the Occupation, it was little short of heroic. Transport, 
materials, costumes, and film stock were all scarce. The Italian 
coproducers pulled out when Italy capitulated. The original French 
producer had to withdraw when he came under investigation by the 
Nazis. One lead actor, a prominent pro-Nazi, fled to Germany after D-Day 
and had to be replaced at the last minute. Alexandre Trauner, the set 
designer, and the composer Joseph Kosma, who were both Jewish, were 
obliged to work in hiding and transmit their ideas through intermediaries.
Despite all this, Children is a consummate achievement with all the 
richness and complexity of a great nineteenth-century novel. The crowd 
scenes deploy their 1,500 extras in riotous profusion, cramming every 
corner of the screen with lively detail. A defiant affirmation of French 
theatrical culture at a time when the nation was conquered and 
occupied, the film offers a meditation on the nature of masquerade, 
fantasy, and representation. All dialogue is heightened, all actions 
masterfully staged. The three lead male characters are all performers—
Lemaître, the great romantic actor (Pierre Brasseur); Debureau, the 
supreme mime artiste (Jean-Louis Barrault); and Lacenaire, the failed 
playwright turned dandyish master criminal (Marcel Herrand). All are real 
historical personages. The woman they all love, the grande horizontale 
Garance (Arletty in her greatest screen role), is fiction—less a real woman 
than an icon of the eternal feminine, elusive and infinitely desirable.
Though it runs over three hours, Children never seems a minute too 
long. A celebration of theater as the great popular art of the nineteenth 
century, it mixes farce, romance, melodrama, and tragedy. Carné was a 
supreme director of actors, and the film offers a feast of great French 
screen acting, along with wit, grace, passion, and an all-pervading sense 
of transience—the melancholy that underlies all Romantic art.  PK

was later promoted to major.

The Battle of San Pietro  John Huston, 1945
Made for the U.S. Army as a propaganda film, John Huston's The Battle of 
San Pietro remains the best war documentary ever made, despite 
changes made to remove some material thought to be too disturbing 
for civilian viewers. The picture details the taking of an Italian hill town 
from tenacious and well-entrenched German defenders, a battle that 
cost American units more than a thousand casualties.
While the inconclusiveness of the struggle implicitly indicts a flawed 
American strategy (despite the director's flag-waving voice-over), 
Huston's main purpose was to portray the experience of war seen from 
the viewpoint of those who fight it and have no concern about larger 
calculations of loss or gain. Huston's crew captures the horror and 
confusion of combat: the wounding of American soldiers; the pain and 
suffering of civilians; the boredom and campaigning for troops far from 
home; the inevitable cost of "victory," measured in the huge number of 
body bags loaded onto trucks; and the rows and rows of temporary 
graves dug to accommodate them.
The film was eventually released to the American public only after 
final victory in Europe, too late to play any role in influencing opinion 
about the war. The Battle of San Pietro is Huston's tribute to the brave 
men he lived among, as well as a poignant, graphic treatment of battle 
and its consequences, with some stock footage and staged scenes not 
detracting from the overall effect of authenticity and objectivity.  RBP

The imposing epics of David Lean's later years sometimes threaten to 
overshadow the director's relatively modest early works, but to focus too 
much on the sheer spectacle of Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago 
would be to overlook some of Lean's greatest accomplishments. After 
all, only a filmmaker of the highest order could direct Lawrence of Arabia, 
and that same mastery of the form is on display in Lean's formative films.
Lean had already directed three adaptations of Noel Coward's work 
when he began Brief Encounter, based on Coward's one-act play Still Life. 
But the play's brevity forced Lean to expand the material, and in the 
process he expanded his own film vocabulary as well. Told in flashback, 
Brief Encounter follows the platonic love affair between housewife Laura 
(Celia Johnson) and doctor Alec (Trevor Howard), who meet fortuitously 
in a train station. There's obviously a connection between the two, but 
they know their romance can't go beyond a few furtive lunch meetings.
In crafting one of the most effective tearjerkers in cinema history, 
Lean made a number of formal advances that quickly established him 
as more than just someone riding the coattails of Noel Coward. For 
starters, Lean took the story out of the train station, adding more details 
to the doomed affair. And he exploited all the cinematic tools at his 
disposal; the lighting, for example, approaches the severe look of Lean's 
subsequent Dickens adaptations, making the symbolic most of the dark, 
smoky station. He also makes good use of sound effects (particularly 
that of a speeding train), as well as music, incorporating Rachmaninoff's 
Piano Concerto No. 2 as the film's running theme.
But most importantly, Lean includes frequent close-ups of Johnson's 
eyes, which tell a better story than most scripts. She and Howard are 
superlative in this saddest of stories, their every movement steeped in 
meaning and the sterling dialogue laced with deep emotions. A passing 
glance, the brush of a finger across a hand, and a shared laugh are

(Celia Johnson)

Considered the initiator of an aesthetic revolution in film, Roberto 
Rossellini's Open City was the first major work of Italian Neorealism, and 
it managed to explode the conventions of the Mussolinian "cinema of 
white telephones" that was fashionable in Italy at the beginning of the 
1940s. This film about the Italian Resistance was scripted in the days of 
the underground battle against the Nazis. Recalling Sergei Eisenstein's 
formula of the "choral film," it tells of a group of patriots hiding in the 
apartment of a lithographer named Francesco (Francesco Grandjaquet). 
The communist who leads the group, Manfredi (Marcello Pagliero), is 
chased by the Gestapo and is finally captured and executed. Francesco's 
wife, Pina (Anna Magnani), and a sympathetic priest, Don Pietro (Aldo 
Fabrizi), die, too, trying to help Manfredi escape. But it is the solidarity of 
Rome as a city that anticipates a final victory against the invaders.
The scarcity of technical and financial resources available to Rossellini 
proved to be a virtue of Open City, which was shot in a documentary 
style. Showing real people in real locations, the film brought some fresh 
air to the existing Western cinema. The freedom of the camera 
movements and the authenticity of the characters, allied to a new way 
of storytelling, were among the qualities that made Open City the 
revelation of the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the 
Palme d'Or. Neorealism quickly became an aesthetic model for directors 
interested in a vivid description of history and society.
One of the most amazing things about Open City is the approach 
Rossellini takes to each character's drama. Some of the film's heroes will 
forever remain in the hearts of viewers. Who can forget the sight of a 
pregnant Pina running through bullets or the kind priest shot before the 
frightened eyes of the children? Although it may veer toward the 
melodramatic, the story is just as moving today as it was then. And it 
should come as no surprise to learn that, after this role, Magnani became 
one of the greatest actresses of the Italian screen.  DD

This domestic epic about three World War II veterans returning to civilian 
life, 172 minutes long and winner of nine Oscars, isn't considered hip 
nowadays. Critics as sharp as Manny Farber and Robert Warshow were 
pretty contemptuous of it when it came out—although seemingly from 
opposite political viewpoints. Farber saw it as liberal hogwash from a 
conservative angle, whereas Warshow skewered it more from a Marxist 
perspective. Its director, William Wyler, and the literary source, MacKinlay 
Kantor's novel, are far from fashionable today. The veteran in the cast, 
Harold Russell, who lost his hands in the war, occasioned outraged 
reflections from Warshow about challenged masculinity and even sick 
jokes from humorist Terry Southern many years later. For all that, it is one 
of the best American movies about returning soldiers ever made—
certainly the most moving and the most deeply felt. It bears witness to 
its times and contemporaries like few other Hollywood features, and 
Gregg Toland's deep-focus cinematography is incredible.
Part of what is so unusual about The Best Years of Our Lives as a 
Hollywood picture is its sense of class distinctions—the way that the 
separate fates and careers of veterans who are well-to-do (March), 
middle-class (Russell), and working-class (Andrews) are juxtaposed. 
Admittedly, the fact that they all meet one another at a bar presided 
over by Hoagy Carmichael is something of a sentimental contrivance, 
yet the relative blurring of class lines in the armed services that carries 
over briefly into civilian life has its plausible side as well. Similarly, the 
limitations of Russell as an actor have been held against the picture, yet 
the fact that we accept him as the real disabled veteran that he was 
seems far more important, documentary truth in this case superseding 
the interests of fiction. The scenes between him and his (fictional) 
fiancée, as they both struggle to adjust to their reconfigured relationship, 
are wrenching in their tenderness as well as their honesty, with few 
passages in American cinema to equal them.  JRos

Paisà  Roberto Rossellini, 1946
Paisan
209
Anyone approaching Paisan without foreknowledge of its status as a 
Neorealist masterpiece could be forgiven for giving up early on: stock 
footage of the American campaign in Italy, Hollywood-style music, 
bad actors barking military commands. It is only by the end of the first 
of six self-contained episodes that Roberto Rossellini's off-hand style 
has begun to weave its stark magic—soon after a bullet abruptly kills 
off a soldier telling his life story, we see the corpse of his companion, 
killed by the Germans and dismissed, unknowingly, by the surviving 
Americans as a "dirty Iti."
Rossellini's chronicle of 1943-46 is marked by devastation, brutality, 
and incomprehension at all levels. An American does not realize that a 
prostitute is the woman he loved six months earlier; a street-urchin 
befriends a drunken, black soldier and steals his shoes the instant he falls 
asleep; the film's final, unforgettably bleak image shows the merciless 
execution of a line of partisans. Rossellini develops a structure to match 
this succession of events, based on startling plot ellipses, cross-purpose 
dialogues in multiple languages, and a rigorously unsentimental 
presentation of horrors. Paisan locates the telling traces of personal life 
within the nightmare of war's history.  AM
The Postman Always Rings Twice  Tay Garnett, 1946
Lana Turner was never more attractive than in her role as Cora Smith, 
who marries an unattractive older man (Cecil Kellaway) as an escape 
from poverty but, deeply dissatisfied, gives in to her attraction for a 
young drifter, Frank Chambers (John Garfield). As in many film noir 
features, the doomed couple's affair hinges on a crime: the murder of 
Cora's husband. Aided by a shyster lawyer, the pair are exonerated. Yet 
they fail to find happiness as Cora is killed in a car accident and Frank is 
executed for this "crime."
Director Tay Garnett's tight framing emphasizes the imprisonment 
of the fatal lovers, and the film's gloomy and forbidding mise-en-scène 
is the perfect setting for their grim story. With white costuming and 
glamorizing lighting, Turner becomes the visual center of the story, 
which was based on the James M. Cain novel published a decade earlier. 
Cora is no ordinary femme fatale. Her feelings for Frank are genuine, not 
artful manipulation.
The Postman Always Rings Twice reflects the Depression culture of the 
1930s, with most of the scenes played in a barely respectable roadside 
diner, a potent image of rootlessness and limited opportunity. The 
flashback narrative suits the omnipresent pessimism of the noir series, 
of which this is one of the most justly celebrated examples.  RBP

La belle et la bête  Jean Cocteau, 1946
Beauty and the Beast
Cocteau never called himself a filmmaker per se. He considered himself a 
poet; film was just one of many art forms he delved into throughout his 
career. Yet even if he thought himself a poet rather than a "mere" filmmaker, 
his visionary rendition of this classic folktale certainly proved the two 
titles were not mutually exclusive. Moreover, the fact that of all his projects, 
the dreamlike Beauty and the Beast remains his most beloved work 
reveals not only both his immense versatility and talent but also the 
endurance and mass acceptance of film over all his other preferred formats.
Indeed, Cocteau approached Beauty and the Beast—only his second 
feature film—fully cognizant of the medium's broad reach and fueled by 
an agenda. On the one hand, his peers were looking to him to put French 
filmmaking back on the map after the massive cultural setback of the 
German occupation; Beauty and the Beast was to be a de facto national 
statement of purpose from France's artistic community. On the other hand, 
Cocteau was also being egged on by the critics, who accused the artist 
of elitism and of being out of touch with the public's tastes. Could he 
ever produce a mainstream work that would be embraced by the people?
Cocteau approached the centuries-old Beauty and the Beast fable as 
an outlet for his most outlandish and fantastic creative impulses. In fact, 
the relatively straightforward framework of the story encouraged such 
experimentation. When her father is held captive by a beast (Jean Marais) 
in a remote castle, daughter Beauty (Josette Day) volunteers to take his 
place. But the Beast's bargain is more than it seems: he tells Beauty he 
wants to marry her, and Beauty must look past the appearance and to 
the good heart of her hairy suitor before making her decision.
Cocteau sets their courtship in a magical castle—the proving ground 
for a number of beautiful effects. Beauty doesn't just walk through the 
halls, she glides. Candles are lodged not in traditional holders but grasped 
by humanoid arms affixed to the walls. Mirrors are transformed to liquid 
portals, flames flicker and extinguish with a mind of their own, and 
statues come to life. The castle works both as a metaphor for the creative 
process personified as well as an excuse for numerous Freudian images. 
Because Beauty can't really consummate her relationship with the Beast 
until he is transformed, Cocteau has her fondling knives and traveling 
down long corridors as a means of revealing her subconscious desires.
But Cocteau's greatest achievement was making the monstrous Beast 
convincing as well as appealing. With Marais buried under elaborate 
makeup, the Beast's goodness must be conveyed through his actions 
and deeds, thus revealing the humanity both literally and figuratively 
beneath the fur and fangs. In fact, so successful is Marais's portrayal that 
at the film's premiere, when the Beast is finally transformed into a blandly 
handsome Prince and he and Beauty live happily ever after, actress Greta 
Garbo famously exclaimed, "Give me back my Beast!"  JKl

The first ten minutes of Robert Siodmak's classic film noir reproduces 
Hemingway's brief 1927 story almost verbatim: Two hit men barge into 
a sleepy burg to gun down the unresisting recluse Swede (Burt 
Lancaster). Extrapolating imaginatively, screenwriters Anthony Veiller 
and John Huston invent Riordan (Edmond O'Brien), a zealous insurance 
investigator who uncovers Swede's past: an ex-pug mixed up with a 
shady dame (Ava Gardner), a payroll heist, and a double cross.
Citizen Kane (1941) fractured its narrative into flashbacks related by 
different narrators; The Killers takes the idea a step further by scrambling 
the flashbacks' temporal order. The process of piecing together this 
jigsaw reinforces a reciprocal link between the spectator and Riordan. 
As he delves into Swede's past, the restless company-man Riordan gets 
the thrill of vicariously living a film noir life without paying the usual 
consequences. The relationship between Riordan and Swede's illicit 
world becomes analogous to that between the spectator and the 
film—a concept crystallized when, just before the showdown, Riordan 
sits silhouetted in the foreground as if he were in the front row of a 
movie theater. The Killers is not only a superior film noir but also a 
commentary on why we enjoy film noir, as an escape from humdrum 
security into danger and doom, but only at a safe distance.  MR

It's a Wonderful Life  Frank Capra, 1946
After celebrating the common man in such 1930s classics as It Happened 
One Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), and You Can't Take It 
with You (1938), Frank Capra's first postwar film revels unashamedly in 
the goodness of ordinary folks as well as the value of humble dreams, 
even if they don't come true. Based on The Greatest Gift, a short story 
written on a Christmas card by Philip Van Doren Stern, the film's vital 
leading role of a young man saddled with responsibility was almost 
turned down by war-weary James Stewart. Released in 1946 to mixed 
reviews, the film was nevertheless nominated for five Academy Awards 
(including Best Picture and Best Actor), but it didn't win in any 
category. Whether it was a film that required frequent viewing to be 
fully appreciated or that simply had been made at the wrong time is 
now a moot point. By the 1960s, the film's copyright expired, which 
opened the floodgates for a "public domain" version to be circulated 
for cheap and frequent television broadcast. Repeated heavily around 
the holiday season, it became a mainstay of wholesome family 
viewing. As an emotional touchstone for several generations, public 
broadcasting stations in the 1970s cemented the film's reputation of 
quality by scheduling it against the commercial networks' crass and 
materialistic holiday fare.
Gangling, good-hearted George Bailey (Stewart) grows up in tiny 
Bedford Falls, Connecticut, but dreams of traveling the world. Duty, 
though, steps in again and again to crush George's dream. The loss of his 
freedom is only softened by George's marriage to local beauty Mary 
(Donna Reed) and later by his young family and his own sense of homey 
philanthropy in helping the working people of Bedford Falls afford their 
own homes. Finally, forced to take over the family savings and loan, which 
is threatened with foreclosure by the greedy town banker Mr.  Potter 
(Lionel Barrymore was rarely more disagreeable), George becomes so 
overburdened that he attempts suicide by jumping off the local bridge. 
But a miracle happens: an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent 
from heaven to show George what the town would have become if 
George had had his wish and hadn't lived at all. If and only if George is 
convinced of his own value will his suicide be undone, the town be 
returned to normal, and Clarence, a second-class angel, get his wings.
It's a Wonderful Life remains a holiday favorite for its uplifting message 
tempered by a foreboding notion of "what if." Viewed on a big screen 
without holiday distractions, the film is actually more of a delightfully 
shrewd screwball comedy packed with fast, incisive observations on 
love, sex, and society. The high quality of the banter especially points to 
uncredited script input from Dorothy Parker, Dalton Trumbo, and Clifford 
Odets. The movie was a favorite of Capra and Stewart, both of whom 
expressed extreme dismay when it became an early victim of the 
colorization craze.  KK

Supposedly when director Howard Hawks asked novelist Raymond 
Chandler to explain the numerous double crosses, twists, and surprises 
revealed throughout his book The Big Sleep, the writer famously and 
honestly replied, "I have no idea." That isn't to say the various twists 
and turns are not important to The Big Sleep, or even that their 
presence in the book is just arbitrary confusion. Rather, Chandler's 
notoriously muddled "whodunit" merely complicates an already 
complicated tale of Los Angeles corruption, further tainting a nearly 
endless list of seedy characters.
It should therefore come as no surprise that Hawks gently shifted 
the focus of his adaptation from sleuthing to the sleuth, in this case 
Humphrey Bogart as hard-boiled private investigator Philip Marlowe. 
Taking advantage of the success of the 1944 film To Have and Have 
Not, Hawks reunited Bogart with Lauren Bacall and played up their 
palpable chemistry. When they're on the screen together, the detective 
story fades to the background (they were married six months after 
shooting ended). Hawks exploited that sexual tension, adding extra 
scenes with the two actors and stressing the innuendo-laced dialogue, 
particularly racy (especially an exchange about horses and saddles) in 
light of the era's Production Code.
And what of the whodunit? Thankfully, the central investigation, 
confusing though it may be, is still a joy to watch. Marlowe acts as our 
Virgil-like guide as he descends into Hollywood's darkest and dirtiest 
corners, unraveling a murder/blackmail plot that involves pornographers, 
nymphomaniacs, and a bevy of hired hoods who barely have time to 
reveal more plot points (and red herrings) before getting plugged.
The Big Sleep is a reference to death, and indeed death pervades the 
movie. This is a film noir masterpiece missing several standard film noir 
tenets. There are numerous femme fatales, but no flashbacks; chiaroscuro 
lighting, but no voice-over. More important, Bogart's Marlowe seems not 
lost in a world of lies and deception but utterly confident and in control 
at all times. He's a droll antihero, cool in the face of cruelty, unfazed in 
the face of wanton sleaze, and always appreciative of a pretty face.  JKl

Gilda  Charles Vidor, 1946
215
"Statistics show there are more women in the world than anything else," 
snaps cynical hero Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), adding, with peculiar 
loathing, "except insects!" And yet this misogyny coexists in director 
Charles Vidor's film with the exquisite Gilda (Rita Hayworth) herself. A 
character who is at once a total blank and a masterful ironist, whose 
signature tune "Put the Blame on Mame"—to which she performs a 
supremely exotic striptease involving only the removal of her elbow-
length velvet gloves—is a pointed exposé of the way women are 
made to seem responsible for the havoc wreaked by men who become 
obsessed with them.
Johnny, a hardboiled gambler who looks suavely uncomfortable in 
his dinner jacket, becomes manager of a casino in Buenos Aires, working 
for Ballin Mundson (George Macready), a frozen-faced mastermind 
who wields a sword cane, enjoys spying on his customers and associates 
from a control room in the gambling joint, and forms the apex of a 
three-way love triangle that triggers the plot. Ford and Hayworth, 
limited but engaging and photogenic actors, have definitive 
performances drawn out of them like teeth, and Macready has the time 
of his life as the complex villain. As the posters claim, "there never was 
a woman like Gilda!"  KN
A Matter of Life and Death  
Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger, 1946
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1946 fantasy, A Matter of Life 
and Death (renamed Stairway To Heaven for the U.S. market), was 
intended as a propaganda film to ameliorate strained relations between 
Britain and America. The movie outstrips its original purpose, however, 
ending up a lasting tale of romance and human goodness that is both 
visually exciting and verbally amusing.
Ready to jump from his burning airplane to certain death, a World 
War II pilot (David Niven) falls in love with the voice of an American 
radio operator (Kim Hunter). He awakes on a beach, believing he is in 
heaven. Finding that he is alive, he seizes the opportunity to fall in love 
with the American girl in person. But the powers above have made an 
error, and Heavenly Conductor 71 (Marius Goring) is sent to tell him the 
truth and take him to heaven where he belongs. The outstanding set 
design by Alfred Junge raises this film above its already impressive 
sentiments and nimble script, which switches with ease between earth 
(filmed in Technicolor) and the ethereal black and white of heaven. 
Along with its use of freeze-frames and breathtaking set decor in the 
great beyond, the camera includes a behind-the-eyeball shot of which 
Salvador Dalí would approve.  KK

Great Expectations  David Lean, 1946
Filmed in 1946 in the wake of the successes Brief Encounter and Blithe 
Spirit (both 1945), Great Expectations was David Lean's first adaptation 
of Charles Dickens's novels; Oliver Twist was to follow in 1948. Taking 
on the literary masterpiece as a cinematic task in every sense of the 
word, Lean explores and exploits the broad emotional horizon of the 
story and makes it a sweeping, mesmeric visual journey as well. The 
result is the finest literary adaptation ever filmed, as well as one of the 
best British films ever made.
Great Expectations shares elements with many horror films, opening 
on a broad marsh, which leads to a lonely, neglected, cemetery. This 
opening scene was so vital that Lean, who had exact ideas about how 
the film should look, replaced the original cinematographer, Robert 
Krasker, with Guy Green. Here, the young hero Pip is threatened by a 
fierce and desperate escaped convict named Magwitch (Finlay Currie) 
who demands food and a file with which to remove his chains. Later, Pip 
is brought to the decrepit mansion of the equally decrepit and embittered 
Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt). Jilted at her wedding breakfast many years 
before, Miss Havisham still wears the remnants of her bridal gown and 
lingers around the dusty, rotting, and rodent-infested remains of that 
fateful dinner. Her macabre plan centers on making her ward, the young 
and beautiful Estella (Jean Simmons), into a one-woman avenger against 
all men. This includes Pip, who has fallen in love with her. His situation 
changes when a mysterious benefactor finances Pip's move to London 
and his becoming a gentleman of means. Sharing a flat with Herbert 
Pocket (Alec Guinness in his first important role), the adult Pip (John Mills) 
becomes a snob, believing that Miss Havisham is his benefactor and that 
Estella is to be his wife. Any reader accustomed to Dickens knows better.
Some have argued that Mills at thirty-eight was far too old to play a 
character who is twenty going on twenty-one, as dictated by the novel. 
However, the fact is Pip needs only to be a witness to the drama played 
out around him rather than an active participant in his own destiny. Lean, 
who spent seven years as a film editor before directing his first feature, 
knew this well and so surrounds Mills with a solid yet colorful supporting 
cast. Some scenes are pure delight, such as Pip's visit to the house of 
Wemmick (Ivor Barnard), his lawyer's assistant, where our hero meets 
Wemmick's elderly and slightly senile father called "Aged P," shorthand 
for "aged parent" and a term still used by some to refer to their own. 
Although not essential for the plot, the scene is memorably heartwarming 
and amusing, bringing with it a great dollop of Dickensian appeal.
Despite its age, Great Expectations has not lost any of its grandeur 
or poignancy. Rated number five on the British Film Institute's list of 
all-time greatest British movies, it earned Academy Awards for Best Art 
Direction and Best Black-and-White Cinematography. In scope, vision, and 
coherence, this remains the supreme film based on Dickens's work.  KK

Though Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), Hour of the Gun (1967), Doc 
(1971), Tombstone (1993), and Wyatt Earp (1994) are all more "historically 
accurate" (for what that's worth), John Ford's romantic, balladlike take on 
the old, old story remains the Wyatt Earp-Doc Holliday-OK Corral movie.
Peaceable cattleman Wyatt (Henry Fonda) rides into the nightmarish 
helltown of Tombstone and turns down the job of Marshal even though 
he's the only man who dares intervene to end the rampage of a 
drunken Indian. When rustlers murder one of his brothers, he holds a 
Fordian conversation with the youth's gravestone before facing up to 
responsibilities and pinning on the badge. In cleaning up the wide-open 
town, Earp makes the community safe for the ordinary church-going, 
square-dancing folks who have been hiding in the shadows while the 
place was overrun by the fiendish Old Man Clanton (Walter Brennan) and 
his gang of killer sons. However, for all the splendors of Monument Valley 
(the familiar landscape augmented by picturesque cactus) and Fonda's 
tight-lipped moral integrity, there is a downside to a crusade won only 
at the cost of the life of Doc Holliday (Victor Mature), a noble outlaw 
washed away along with the bad elements by bullets and consumption. 
This dark theme will later resurface in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance 
(1962), Ford's disillusioned revision of the town-taming Western.
Mature has a reputation for woodenness, but his turn here as the 
consumptive surgeon-gunman is heartrending and a bitterly witty turn. 
Fonda's hero unbends slowly, emerging with stick insect-like grace in 
one of Ford's trademark community dance scenes and memorably 
depicted in perfect balance on the porch, chair on two legs, one boot 
against a post. As always with the Fordian West, the action thrills 
represented by the elaborate last-reel gunfight are leavened by comic 
elements: a Shakespearean drunk who needs to be prompted by Doc 
in the middle of "To Be or Not to Be" and romantic complications with 
the luminous Chihuaha (Linda Darnell) and the schoolmarm Clementine 
(Cathy Downs). However, the tone is as often wistful or awestruck by 
the beauties of the landscape as it is cheer-along shoot-'em-up Saturday 
matinee material.  KN

1946

Though producer David O. Selznick reunited the winning team of director 
Alfred Hitchcock, star Ingrid Bergman, and writer Ben Hecht from 
Hitchcock's psychoanalytical drama Spellbound (1945), and oversaw (with 
his customary blizzard of memos) the development of this classy, romantic 
spy story, he eventually sold the whole package to RKO and let Hitchcock 
produce it himself. Even David Thomson, Selznick's biographer, admits 
that the film is as good as it is because Selznick wasn't there to ruin it.
Toward the end of World War II, suave spymaster T. R. Devlin (Cary 
Grant) recruits loose-living Alicia Huberman (Bergman), the estranged 
daughter of a convicted traitor, to infiltrate a group of Nazi exiles in 
Argentina. Having fallen for the man who has rescued her from a life 
of trampy uselessness, Alicia is agonized when she feels Devlin is 
pimping her for the cause, and she is driven to take her mission to 
extremes by marrying the almost-fatherly fascist Alexander Sebastian 
(Claude Rains). Inside Sebastian's chilly, luxurious mansion, Alicia 
earns the hatred of the true power among the evil exiles, Sebastian's 
smothering monster mother (Madame Konstantin), who is the sort of 
creature Mrs. Bates might have been if left alive. At a party, with a classic 
suspense mechanism in the dwindling supply of champagne that will 
eventually lead to a servant venturing into the wine cellar where the 
angelic Alicia and the devilish Devlin are snooping, Hitchcock produces 
his most elegant and yet topical detail: wine bottles full of uranium 
being used to create a Nazi A-bomb. The payoff is an agonizing moment 
of discovery when Sebastian is duped into believing that his wife is only 
unfaithful as opposed to a spy.
Notorious's intense triangle drama constantly forces you to change 
your feelings about the three leads, with Rains even showing a bizarre 
heroism in the finale. The film is also a sumptuous romance, with 
Grant and Bergman sharing what was, at that point, the screen's 
longest close-up kiss. Gorgeously shot by Ted Tetzlaff in luminous 
monochrome, with the stars looking (and acting) their best, this last 
reel was extremely unnerving as the monstrous mother supervises 
Alicia's slow poisoning.  KN

Film historian David Thomson probably understates the case when he 
refers to Black Narcissus as "that rare thing, an erotic English film about 
the fantasies of nuns." Based very closely on Rumer Godden's 1939 novel, 
the picture follows a small group of sisters who are gifted with a building 
high up in the Himalayas that they attempt to turn into a convent 
school-cum-hospital. The drafty building was once a harem and is still 
adorned with explicit murals, while a cackling ayah left over from the 
times of licentiousness gleefully predicts that the sisters will succumb to 
the place's atmosphere.
On one level, Black Narcissus is a matter-of-fact account of the failings 
of empire: These sensible Christians arrive with good intentions but are 
in an absurd situation, teaching only pupils who are paid by the local 
maharajah to attend lessons that mean nothing to them, and doctoring 
only minor cases—since if they should try and fail to save a patient, the 
hospital will be abandoned as if cursed. Directors Powell and Pressburger 
see the humor in the nuns' frustrations, observing a culture clash without 
dismissing either the rational or primitive point of view, relishing the 
irony that it is the most religious characters who are the most sensible 
here (when they should be prone to all manner of unfounded beliefs), 
and the godless ones who are most inclined to superstition.
Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), promoted too young, tries to keep the 
mission together like an inexperienced officer in a war movie, thrown 
together with the smoldering, disreputable Mr. Dean (David Farrar) and 
thus exciting the eventually homicidal jealousy of the most repressed of 
the nuns, Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron). As the obsessions begin to bite, 
the film becomes more surreal, with the studio-bound exotica glowing 
under Jack Cardiff's vivid Technicolor cinematography and Kerr and 
Byron trembling under their wimples as the passionate nuns. Among 
the most startling moments in British cinema is the "revelation" of Sister 
Ruth stripped of her habit, in a mail-order dress and blood-red lipstick, 
transformed into a harpie who tries to push Clodagh over a precipice as 
she sounds the convent bell. A nearly grown-up Sabu (Mowgli in the 
1942 Jungle Book) and a young Jean Simmons (with a jeweled snail on 
her nose) play the sensual innocents who set a bad example.  KN

Out of the Past, adapted from Daniel Mainwaring's novel Build My Gallows 
High, may be the masterpiece of film noir. All the elements are there: the 
woman who lies, but is so beautiful that one could forgive almost 
anything, or at least die at her side (Kathy Moffat, played by Jane Greer). 
The bitter past that rises up again and destroys the main character. The 
private eye (Jeff Markham—Robert Mitchum), a man of wit and know-
how who makes the mistake of giving in to his passion—more than once. 
Mitchum perfectly embodies this figure. Like Humphrey Bogart, he 
possesses a calm interiority that expresses independence and confidence. 
As one character says of him, "He just sits and stays inside himself." But unlike 
the cautious Bogart, Mitchum literally slouches into his role as Jeff, his 
heavy relaxation making his vulnerability not only believable but tragic.
Is Kathy's passion for Jeff real? In spite of her inability to endure 
difficulties for his sake and her fatalistic attitude about love, does she 
really love him? For that matter, is Jeff's ardor for her sincere? Although 
he phones the police to convert their final getaway into an ambush, is 
he surrendering to her allure once again? This is the question that Jeff's 
small-town girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston) asks The Kid (Dickie Moore), 
Jeff's deaf-mute companion, at the film's end. The Kid nods yes. Is he 
telling the truth? We feel that this gesture will free Ann from any future 
entanglement with Jeff's fatal world, but does that mean it's a lie? Out of 
the Past, like film noir in general, leaves us with the enigmas of fatal 
desires, the ambiguities of loves laced with fear.  TG

Monsieur Verdoux  Charles Chaplin, 1947
Charles Chaplin bought the idea for his blackest comedy (for $5,000) 
from Orson Welles, who had originally planned a dramatized 
documentary about the legendary French serial wife killer Henri Desiré 
Landru. Chaplin gave the story a new and acute sociosatirical edge, in 
response to the then-growing political paranoia of the Cold War years. 
Verdoux (Chaplin), the suave and charming little bourgeois, only 
adopts his lucrative profession of marrying and murdering rich widows 
when economic depression removes the possibility of his earning an 
honest living as a bank clerk. Finally brought to justice, his defense is 
that although private murder is condemned, public killing—in the form 
of war—is glorified: "One murder makes a villain—millions a hero. 
Numbers sanctify." These were not popular sentiments in 1946 America, 
and Chaplin found himself more and more the target of the political 
right—a witch hunt that led to his decision to give up his residency in 
the United States in 1953.
Verdoux, accompanied by his jaunty little theme tune (Chaplin as 
usual was his own composer), is a rich and vivid character. The tight 
economies of the postwar period obliged Chaplin to work more quickly 
and with much more planning than on any previous films. The result is 
one of his most tightly constructed narratives, which he unselfconsciously 
considered "the cleverest and most brilliant film of my career."  DR
Odd Man Out  Carol Reed, 1947
Carol Reed's chronicle of an Irish republican soldier plays like an 
expressionist fever dream. James Mason, as Johnny McQueen, plays the 
leader of an anti-British group that plans a robbery that will help to fund 
their cause. On the night of the crime, Johnny kills a man and is shot 
himself, and must run from the authorities who set up a dragnet across 
the city to catch him and his associates. The entire film takes place 
during the rest of this night as Johnny seeks refuge and his girlfriend 
Kathleen (Kathleen Ryan) tries to find him.
Johnny discovers that people he trusted or thought were 
sympathetic to his cause will not stick their necks out for him. He is 
forced to keep moving and is passed along from one person to the next; 
each has a reason not to help him or to use him for their own aims. As 
his wound worsens, Johnny becomes deliriously philosophical and 
begins to understand that he is fundamentally alone in the world. The 
film's score and shadowy black-and-white photography add to the 
overall sense of moral uncertainty. The way in which Odd Man Out 
bursts the seams of the political thriller genre and becomes a moving, 
thoughtful, and powerful meditation on social existence will continue 
to astonish moviegoers for all time.  RH

Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), an unemployed worker in 
postwar Rome, finds a job putting up movie posters after his wife 
pawns the family's bedsheets to get his bicycle out of hock. But right 
after he starts work the bike is stolen, and with his little boy Bruno (Enzo 
Staiola) in tow he crisscrosses the city trying to recover it, encountering 
various aspects of Roman society, including some of the more acute 
class differences, in the process.
This masterpiece—the Italian title translates as "bicycle thieves"—is 
one of the key works of Italian Neorealism. French critic André Bazin 
also recognized it as one of the great communist films. The fact that it 
received the 1949 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film suggests that 
it wasn't perceived that way in the United States at the time. Ironically, 
the only thing American censors cared about was a scene in which the 
little boy urinates on the street. For some followers of auteur theory 
the film lost some of its power because it didn't derive from a single 
creative intelligence. A collaboration between screenwriter Cesare 
Zavattini, director Vittorio De Sica, nonprofessional actors, and many 
others, the production is so charged with a common purpose that there 
is little point in even trying to separate achievements.
The Bicycle Thief contains what is possibly the greatest depiction of a 
relationship between a father and son in the history of cinema, full of 
subtle fluctuations and evolving gradations between the two characters 
in terms of respect and trust, and it's an awesome heartbreaker. It also 
has its moments of Chaplinesque comedy—the contrasting behavior of 
two little boys having lunch at the same restaurant. Set alongside a 
film like Life Is Beautiful (1997), it provides some notion of how much 
mainstream world cinema and its relation to reality has been infantilized 
over the past half century.  JRos

Letter from an Unknown Woman  Max Ophüls, 1948
Stefan Brand (Louis Jourdan), a concert pianist and gentleman dandy in 
turn-of-the-century Vienna, arrives home after yet another evening of 
dissipation. His mute servant hands him a letter. It is from a woman, and 
its first words well and truly halt him in his tracks: "By the time you read 
this, I will be dead. . . ."
What unfolds from this extraordinary opening has more than a fair 
claim to being not only the best film of director Max Ophüls, and a 
supreme achievement in the often unfairly maligned genre of 
melodrama, but also one of the greatest films in world cinema history. 
It is, in its own terms, one of the few movies that deserve to be rated as 
perfect, right down to the smallest detail.
Superbly adapted from Stefan Zweig's novella by Howard Koch, this 
is the apotheosis of "doomed love" fiction. Flashing back to trace the 
hopeless infatuation of young Lisa Berndl (Joan Fontaine) for Stefan, 
Ophüls gives us a vivid, heartbreaking portrait of a love that should never 
have been: Her naïve romanticization of artistic men mismatched with 
his indifferent objectification of available women adds up to gloomy 
tragedy. Ophüls's intuitive grasp of the inequity of gender roles in 
20th-century Western society is breathtaking.
Ophüls constructs a most exquisitely poised work. While encouraging 
us to identify with Lisa's longing, and the dreams of a whole society fed 
by its popular culture, Letter from an Unknown Woman at the same time 
provides a trenchant and devastating critique of the myth and ideology 
of romantic love. Our understanding of the tale hinges on its delicate 
shifts in mood and viewpoint.
Relentlessly and hypnotically, Ophüls strips away the veils of illusion 
that envelop Lisa. Either the staging reveals the banal conditions of 
reality that underwrite these flights of fantasy, or the camera suggests—
in subtle positionings and movements slightly detached from the story's 
world—a knowing perspective that eludes the characters.
The film is a triumph not just of meaningful, expressive style, but of 
purposive narrative structure. With poignant voice-over narration from 
Lisa, decades are bridged and key years artfully skipped thanks to a 
patterning of significant details arranged as motifs, concentrated in 
repeated gestures (such as the giving of a flower), lines of dialogue 
(references to passing time are ubiquitous), and key objects (the staircase 
leading to Stefan's apartment). By the time Ophüls reaches a Hollywood 
staple—the ghostlike apparition of young Lisa at last conjured in Stefan's 
memory—the cliché is gloriously transcended, and tears overcome even 
those modern viewers who resist such old-fashioned "soaps."
Letter from an Unknown Woman is an inexhaustibly rich film, one that 
has drawn myriad film lovers to try to unravel its themes, patterns, 
suggestions, and ironies. But no amount of close analysis can ever 
extinguish the rich, tearing emotion that this masterpiece elicits.  AM

Unknown Woman 
provides a luxurious 
swathe of emotion . . . the 
action of the film, on the 
cusp of melodrama, is

Fritz Lang fans often divide on whether they prefer the certified, 
highbrow classics like M (1931), Metropolis (1926), and The Big Heat 
(1953), or the stranger, more cryptic and perverse films in his oeuvre that 
plumb less reputable areas of pop culture, such as Rancho Notorious 
(1952) and Moonfleet (1955). Secret Beyond the Door scrapes by in some 
accounts as a respectable film noir, but it is the beguiling mixture of 
many genres—women's melodrama, Freudian case study, serial killer 
mystery, and allegory of the artistic/creative process—that makes it such 
a special and haunting oddity in the director's career.
The film partakes of Hollywood's "Female Gothic" cycle, exploring the 
fraught attachment of a woman (here, Joan Bennett) to a man (Michael 
Redgrave) who is all at once enigmatic, seductive, and (as the plot 
unravels) potentially life threatening. As in Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), 
which inspired Lang, the heroine enters a home of strangers, brimming 
with past, unspoken traumas, and sick, subterranean relationships.
Lang fixes the frankly sadomasochistic ambiguities of this plot (What 
is the true nature of the male beast, sensitivity or aggression? What does 
the woman really want from him, anyway, love or death?) into a 
startlingly novel context: Redgrave is a tormented-genius architect who 
has built a house of "felicitous rooms," each the reconstructed scene of 
a grisly, patently psychosexual murder.
Secret Beyond the Door joins a special group of 1940s films, including 
Jean Renoir's The Woman on the Beach (1947) and the Val Lewton 
production The Seventh Victim (1943), whose potent, dreamlike aura is 
virtually guaranteed by their B-movie sparseness and free-association 
plotting—as well as, here, a voiceover narration that disorientatingly shifts 
from Bennett to Redgrave and back again. Heretical it may be for a card-
carrying auteurist to suggest, but the cuts imposed by Universal on Lang's 
initial edit probably enhanced this dreamlike quality. The end result may 
be short on rational links and explanations, but s is one of the precious 
occasions when Lang—aided immeasurably by Stanley Cortez's baroque 
cinematography and Miklós Rózsa's lush score—managed to add a richly 
poetic dimension to his familiar fatalism.  AM

Force of Evil  Abraham Polonsky, 1948
227
Like The Night of the Hunter (1955), Force of Evil is a unique event in the 
history of American cinema. Its director, Abraham Polonsky, made two 
subsequent movies much later and scripted others, but this is the sole 
film in which the full extent of his promising brilliance shined, before 
being snuffed out by the McCarthy-era blacklist.
Force of Evil sits uncomfortably within the film noir genre, despite the 
presence of a star (John Garfield) associated with hard-boiled, streetwise 
movies. It is above all a film of poetry, carried by a "blank verse" voiceover 
and a highly stylized singsong dialogue, which are among the most 
astounding and radical innovations of 1940s cinema, anticipating 
Malick's Badlands (1973).
This is a story of amorality, guilt, and redemption, dramatized 
through the near-Biblical device of betrayal between brothers. Polonsky 
breaks up the fatalistic gloom of the piece (its final image of a descent 
to a corpse among garbage is chilling) with a touching and very modern 
love story between Garfield and Beatrice Pearson. 
The film is stylized down to the smallest detail in line with its poetic 
ambition: to liberate sound, image, and performance and have all three 
interact in an intoxicating polyphony.  AM
Xiao cheng zhi chun  Fei Mu, 1948
Spring in a Small Town
If one mark of a great film is its ability to introduce characters in an 
economical way, Fei Mu's Spring in a Small Town projects its greatness 
instantly. Deftly and poignantly, the film unveils to us five figures: "The 
Wife" (Wei Wei), lonely and weary of daily chores; "The Husband" (Shi Yu), 
a sickly melancholic; "The Sister" (Zhang Hongmei), youthfully vivacious; 
Lao Huang, "The Servant" (Cui Chaoming), ever watchful; and "The 
Visitor" (Li Wei), strolling into this town (and out of the past) to become 
the catalyst for change.
Sparingly, the film builds its postwar drama: the desires, hopes, 
dreams, and hurts that play among these characters caught in the 
arrangement of bodies in the frame, a choreography of furtive looks, and 
sudden gestures of resistance or resignation. But there is also a 
modernist element: The wife's voiceover narration, which poetically 
reiterates what is plainly visible, covers events she has not witnessed, 
and puts sad realities into brutal words.
This masterpiece of Chinese cinema has only recently received the 
worldwide recognition it deserves, influencing Wong Kar-Wai's In the 
Mood for Love (2001) and occasioning a respectful remake (2002). 
Spring in a Small Town stands among cinema's finest, richest, and most 
moving melodramas.  AM

A Western remake of Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), this is a considerably 
deeper film than its source, presenting the Bligh-Christian relationship 
in terms of a father-son conflict. Star John Wayne—one of the most 
beautiful male leads of the 1930s, playing older than his real age with 
authentic and prescient crustiness—is interestingly matched by Hawks 
against the photogenic Montgomery Clift, epitome of a kind of sensitive, 
manly neurosis that would come in fashion in the next decade.
After a long prologue set during the aftermath of an 1851 Indian 
attack, in which we see how bereft Tom Dunson (Wayne) and orphaned 
Matthew Garth (Clift) combine their herds to form a cattle empire, we 
pick up the Red River D in a post-Civil War economic depression. Leading 
a cattle drive up into Missouri, the inflexible Dunson becomes more and 
more tyrannical, prompting Matt to rebel and steer the herd West by a 
safer route to Abilene. Dunson admires the kid's guts, but nevertheless 
swears to track him down and shoot him dead, leading to one of the 
most emotional climaxes in the genre as the men who love each other 
face off among milling cattle in the Abilene streets.
Hawks, the great film chronicler of macho pursuits, here stages the 
definitive cow opera, putting all other cattle-drive Westerns in the shade 
with beautiful, lyrical, exciting sequences of stampeding, rough weather, 
cowboying, and Indian skirmishes. The leads are at their best, with 
Wayne astonishingly matching Clift for subtlety, and you get sterling 
support from Walter Brennan as the toothless coot, John Ireland as a 
lanky gunslinger, and Joanne Dru as a pioneer gal who can take an arrow 
in the shoulder without hardly flinching. Though known for his Westerns, 
Hawks made surprisingly few films in the genre. This seems like an 
affectionate tribute to John Ford, mixed in with a certain I-can-do-that-
too attitude, as Hawks casts several members of his peer's stock 
company: Harry Carey Senior and Junior, Hank Worden, even Wayne 
himself. Hawks uses a Fordian approach to the dangerous splendors of 
the Western landscape along with a Ford-like folk song-based score 
from Dimitri Tiomkin.  KN

Jane Russell plays Calamity Jane, recruited by the U.S. government to 
help track down a gang of renegade whites who are selling guns to the 
Indians. In order to pose as an emigrant on a wagon train going West, 
she marries Painless Peter Potter, an incompetent and cowardly dentist 
she encounters in a bathhouse—one doesn't look for plausibility in such 
material! As Painless, Bob Hope has a wonderful time, letting forth a 
fusillade of jokes. Much of the humor in The Paleface is along predictable 
lines, with Indians inhaling the dentist's laughing gas and Hope 
performing all manner of unheroics, leading to his being mistaken for a 
courageous Indian fighter. Hope is of course madly attracted to Russell—
"You've got just the kind of mouth I like to work on." There's a running 
joke about the endlessly postponed consummation of the marriage as 
Russell gets on with the job of defeating the bad guys.
Painless and Calamity are captured and taken to an Indian camp, 
where Indians are played both by Chief Yowlachie (a genuine Native 
American) and by Iron Eyes Cody (an Italian-American who passed as a 
Native American). The comedy at their expense, though hardly politically 
correct, is too silly to give serious offense.
Hope gives a pleasing rendition of the song "Buttons and Bows," 
written by Victor Young, which won an Oscar. It's a plea for girls to go 
back East and wear pretty clothes, but Russell looks equally fetching in 
satin dresses and buckskin pants.  EB

The Snake Pit  Anatole Litvak, 1948
Among the more impressive products of Hollywood's postwar turn 
toward greater realism is Anatole Litvak's brutally honest treatment of 
mental illness and its cure in the modern sanitarium, whose horrors 
include the overcrowded ward where the incurables are warehoused—
the "snake pit" of the film's title. The Snake Pit offers a more balanced view 
of mental disturbance than many more recent films, including the often 
praised One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1976).
Virginia Cunningham (Olivia de Havilland) seems at first a hopeless 
psychotic, but with treatment from a sympathetic doctor, Mark Kik (Leo 
Genn), she is able to undergo a "talking cure." Flashbacks show a 
childhood in which she is denied not only her mother's love but also 
attention from her father, who died when Virginia was very young. 
Virginia also suffers the death of the man she loves, for which she 
believes she is responsible. Under Dr. Kik's care, she graduates to the 
"best" ward, only to be bullied there by a tyrannical nurse. Virginia's 
subsequent misbehavior lands her in the "snake pit," but this horrifying 
experience proves strangely therapeutic. Finally she wins release, at last 
understanding how her feelings of guilt are irrational.
Memorable is how the film shows the terror that Virginia's illness 
makes her suffer. The Snake Pit's optimistic realism contrasts with the 
pseudo-Freudian solutions of other movies of the period, including 
Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945).  RBP
Having proved with The Stranger (1946) that he could make a "regular" 
film if he wanted to, Orson Welles here returns to the film noir genre, 
picking up almost at random a pulp novel (Sherwood King's If I Die Before 
I Wake) and delivering something so rich and strange it was guaranteed 
to irk Columbia head Harry Cohn. Simply by shearing Rita Hayworth's 
trademarked long hair and dying her crop blonde, Welles deliberately 
devalued a studio asset who happened to be his ex-wife, and that was 
even before it emerged that she was playing not the sympathetic 
bombshell of Gilda (1946) but a villainness so nasty that even her 
undoubted sex appeal becomes repulsive.
With a variable Irish accent, Welles is a seaman hired by a crippled 
lawyer (Everett Sloane, lizardy and scary) to crew his yacht and perhaps 
also (as in the anecdote preserved by Welles as The Immortal Story [1968]) 
to service his beautiful wife. A murder takes place, followed by a trial in 
which everyone acts unethically at best, and the crazy kaleidoscope is 
shattered by a finale involving a shoot-out in a hall of mirrors. The Lady 
from Shanghai is a broken mirror of a film, with shards of genius that can 
never be put together into anything that makes sense.  KN

The Lady from Shanghai   Orson Welles, 1948

Though he owed his fame to showmanship and thrills, Alfred Hitchcock 
was always among the most experimental of commercial filmmakers. 
With a strong source in a play by Patrick Hamilton (of Gaslight [1944] 
fame) based on the Leopold and Loeb case, more conventionally 
dramatized in the 1959 film Compulsion, Rope calls attention to its 
theatrical one-set backdrop by consisting of reel-long takes spliced 
together almost invisibly so that the film appears to unspool unedited. 
Given that, in 1948, many film audiences had barely registered that 
movies consisted of brief snippets cut together for dramatic effect—most 
films about filmmaking even now seem to suggest that scenes are shot 
as if they were happening in live theater—it may well be that Hitchcock 
was most interested in addressing his fellow professionals, demonstrating 
an alternate manner of telling a film story in much the way that the later 
Dogme95 movement or The Blair Witch Project (1999) set out to do.
Apart from the technical challenges of having the camera follow 
characters around a large New York apartment, telling a story in "real 
time," Rope has quite a bit of intrinsic interest as two cohabiting bachelors 
(John Dall and Farley Granger) try to get away with a casual murder to 
prove an obscure point. At once an intense psychological drama and a 
black comedy in the vein of Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), the film delivers 
cat-and-mouse conflict as the killers invite professorial Jimmy Stewart 
around to impress him with their cleverness, flirting in more than one 
way with revelation.
The technique is less of a distraction than it might be, allowing 
Stewart and Dall to face off in a great battle of murderous camp and 
moral rectitude; it may be that all the attention paid to the long takes 
made the censors overlook the unusually frank depiction of a quasi-gay 
relationship between the murderers—it's never addressed in the 
dialogue but there is only one bedroom in the apartment they share. 
Granger's shakiness isn't helped by the merciless length of the takes, but 
Dall and Stewart rise to the occasion, challenged to deliver sustained, 
theater-style performances in the more intimate medium of film.  KN

The Red Shoes  Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger, 1948
The 1948 Michael Powell-Emeric Pressburger production has been 
beloved by generations of girls who want to grow up to be ballerinas, 
though its message to them is decidedly double-edged. In a dazzling 
twist on the old showbiz star-is-born story, winsome, willful, talented 
debutante-cum-dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) falls under the spell 
of Svengali-cum-Rasputin-cum-Diaghilev impresario Boris Lermontov 
(Anton Walbrook). She neglects her private life (a romance with composer 
Marius Goring) in favor of a passionate and almost unhealthy devotion 
to Art, with a beautifully choreographed tragic ending in the offing. After 
the departure of prima ballerina Boronskaja (Ludmilla Tchérina), whom 
Lermontov drops when she wants to get married, Vicky makes her 
starring debut in an especially created ballet version of the Hans Christian 
Andersen story of the girl whose shoes keep her dancing until she drops 
dead. This spurs the filmmakers—augmented by choreographer-dancer 
Robert Helpmann, costar Léonide Massine, and conductor Sir Thomas 
Beecham—to a twenty-minute fantasy dance sequence that set a trend 
for such stylized high-culture interludes in musicals, but manages far 
better than any of the imitators to retell in miniature the larger story of 
the film while still being credible as a performance piece in its own right.
Of course, Vicky's offstage life sadly follows that of Andersen's heroine, 
climaxing in a balletic leap in front of a train and the unforgettable tribute 
performance in which her devastated costars dance the Red Shoes ballet 
again with only the shoes to stand in for the star. Shearer, tiny and 
astonishing in her screen debut, is a powerful presence who can stand 
up to the full force of Walbrook's overwhelming performance, convincing 
both as the ingenue dancing in a cramped hall with a third-rate company 
and as the great star adored by the whole world. The heroine is 
surrounded with weird fairy-tale backdrops for the daringly lush ballet, 
but production designer Hein Heckroth, art director Arthur Lawson, and 
cinematographer Jack Cardiff work as hard to make the supposedly 
normal offstage scenes as rich and strange as the theatrical highlights.
Walbrook coos and hisses Mephistophelean lines with a self-delight 
that's impossible not to share, manipulating all about him with ease but 
still tragically alone in his monk-like devotion to the ballet. The Red Shoes 
is a rare musical to capture the magic of theatrical performance without 
neglecting the agonizing effort necessary to create such transports of 
delight. Its gossipy insider feel went a great way toward making ballet 
accessible outside its supposed high-class audience, contrasting the 
eager expectation of the musical students crowded into the highest 
(cheapest) seats with the offhand take-it-for-granted patronage of the 
well-dressed swine in the stalls before whom the artistic pearls are cast. 
Wrapped up with gorgeous sparkly color, off-the-beaten-track classical 
music selections, and a sinister edge that perfectly catches the ambiguity 
of traditional as opposed to Disney fairy tales, this is a masterpiece.  KN

in its beauty and

The failed quest, fueled by ambition and frustrated by greed and internal 
dissension, was John Huston's favorite plot, appealing to the mixture of 
romantic and cynic that made up his character. From The Maltese Falcon 
(1941) to The Man Who Would Be King (1975), he played repeated 
variations on this theme—but The Treasure of the Sierra Madre presents 
it in something close to its archetypal form. Three ill-assorted American 
drifters in Mexico join forces to prospect for gold, find it, and—
inevitably—in the end, snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and lose 
it again. Huston, always a great adaptor of literature for the screen, drew 
his story from a novel by the mysterious and reclusive writer B. Traven 
and, as ever, treated his source material with respect and affection, 
preserving much of Traven's laconic dialogue and sardonic outlook.
Despite the studio's opposition—because location filming, at least 
for A-list Hollywood productions, was rare in those days—Huston insisted 
on shooting almost entirely on location in Mexico, near an isolated 
village some 140 miles north of the capital. His intransigence paid off. 
The film's texture exudes the dusty aridity of the Mexican landscape, so 
that watching it you can almost taste the grit between your teeth; and 
the actors, exiled from the comfortable environment of the studio and 
having to contend with the elements, were pushed into giving taut, 
edgy performances. This fitted Treasure's theme: how people react under 
pressure. Whereas the old prospector (played by the director's father 
Walter Huston) and the naive youngster (cowboy-movie actor Tim Holt) 
hang on to their principles in the face of adversity and the temptation 
of gold, the paranoid Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart in one of his 
most memorably unsettling roles) cracks up and succumbs.
Huston's determination to shoot Treasure the way he wanted paid off 
for the studio too. Jack Warner initially detested the film, but it brought 
Warner Brothers not only a box-office smash hit but triumphs at the 
Academy Awards. Huston won Oscars for Best Director and Best 
Screenplay, while his father picked up the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. 
It was the first and—so far—only time a father-and-son team had won 
at the Awards.  PK

For his last film, Louisiana Story, the great documentarian Robert J. 
Flaherty accepted sponsorship from Standard Oil to make a movie about 
oil prospecting in the Louisiana bayous. The funding came without 
strings, but even so Flaherty maybe soft-pedaled his depiction of the oil 
company a little, showing it as a benign force causing no damage to the 
unspoiled wilderness. But a hint of naïveté isn't entirely out of place; 
events in the bayou, and the arrival of the oilmen, are shown us through 
the eyes of a twelve-year-old boy (Joseph Boudreaux). The haunted, 
waterlogged landscape becomes a magical place, full of dark foliage and 
exotic wildlife, where an oil derrick gliding majestically up a waterway 
seems as mythical and unfathomable as the werewolves and mermaids 
the boy believes in.
Dialogue is minimal—partly because the director, as usual, was 
working with local people, not professional actors—and Flaherty relies 
mainly on his charged, lyrical images and Virgil Thomson's score to carry 
the narrative. Thomson's music, drawing ingeniously on original Cajun 
themes, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize—the first film score to win this 
honor. In Louisiana Story, as in all his finest work, Flaherty celebrates the 
beauty, danger, and fascination of the wild places of the earth.  PK

Joseph H. Lewis's cult gem Gun Crazy (a.k.a. Deadly Is the Female) is 
something of a test case in contemporary debates on the meaning of 
the critically disputed term film noir. Based loosely on the story of 
infamous 1930s bandits Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow (the screenplay 
was developed by MacKinlay Kantor and blacklisted writer Dalton 
Trumbo, the latter here credited as Millard Kaufman to conceal the fact 
that he was one of the Hollywood Ten), this tale of rural love-on-the-run 
appears to have little in common with the hard-boiled nocturnal urban 
underworld that more often defines the noir tradition. But set alongside 
the similar story of star-crossed lovers in They Live by Night (1948), as 
well as films that featured down-on-their-luck honest laborers—
Desperate (1947), Thieves' Highway (1949), and The Sound of Fury 
(1951)—Gun Crazy shares the noir theme of the rootless, marginal man 
(prevalent during the Depression and a continuing source of anxiety in 
the years following World War II), which also characterizes canonical 
noirs such as The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) and Detour (1945), 
both fatalistic tales of drifters.
From an early age, Bart Tare (John Dall) has been obsessed with 
firearms. After leaving the army, he meets and instantly falls in love with 
the stunningly beautiful Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins), who 
shares his gun fetishism, having been the sharp-shooting main 
attraction in a traveling tent show. They set out on a series of robberies 
that, before their death at the law's hands, culminates in the holdup of 
the pay department in a meatpacking plant.
At the formal level, claims for Gun Crazy's exceptional status among 
the plethora of B-movies are more than justified in virtue of the film's 
aesthetic innovations within low-budget restraints—the long single-
shot scene of a bank robbery, the chase through the abattoir—and in 
Cummins's peerless characterization of a psychotic femme fatale. This 
timeless tale of amour fou was a major influence on Jean-Luc Godard's 
French New Wave classic Breathless (1960).  PS

White Heat  Raoul Walsh, 1949
237
"Do you know what to do?" barks Cody (James Cagney) at his sidekick at 
the start of a daring train robbery. When the guy starts replying, Cody 
cuts him off: "Just do it, stop gabbing!" This headlong, action-only 
attitude sums up the drive of Raoul Walsh's films, which (as Peter Lloyd 
once remarked) "take the pulse of an individual energy" and embed it 
within a "demented trajectory out of which is born the construction of 
a rhythm." Few films are as taut, sustained, and economical in their 
telling as White Heat.
Walsh is a relentlessly linear, forward-moving director whose work 
harkens back to silent cinema—as in that exciting car-meets-train 
opener. But he also explores the intriguing, complicating possibilities of 
twentieth-century psychology. On the job, Cody kills ruthlessly. Once 
holed up like a caged animal with his gang—as he will later be 
imprisoned—his psychopathology begins to emerge: indifference to 
others' suffering, fixation on a tough mom, and searing migraines that 
send him berserk.
Cody, as immortalized in Cagney's blistering, powerhouse 
performance, embodies the ultimate contradiction that often brings 
down movie gangsters: fantastic egotism and dreams of invincibility 
("Look, Ma, top of the world!") undermined by all-too-human 
dependencies and vulnerabilities.  AM
The Reckless Moment  Max Ophüls, 1949
The Reckless Moment is an unusual film noir in that it reverses the sexes 
in a replay of the familiar story (as in Double Indemnity [1944] and Scarlet 
Street [1945]) of an innocent who gets involved with a seductive 
no-good and is embroiled in crime. Here, class and respectability 
assume the status usually accorded to sex and money as housewife 
Lucia Harper (Joan Bennett) loses her grip on suburbia when the sleazy 
specimen (Shepperd Strudwick) who has been seeing her daughter 
(Geraldine Brooks) is semiaccidentally killed under suspicious 
circumstances, and she moves his corpse to make things look better.
Lucia's nemesis is played by James Mason, oddly but effectively cast 
as an Irish lowlife, who starts out blackmailing her but begins, 
disturbingly, to make sincere romantic overtures. The focus of the film 
then changes as the criminal is driven to make a sacrifice that will 
restore the heroine's life but also suggests that Bennett—who, after all, 
was the tramp in Scarlet Street—may have unwittingly been 
manipulating him to her advantage all along. Viennese director Max 
Ophüls is more interested in irony and emotion than crime and drama, 
which gives this a uniquely nerve-fraying feel, and he nudges the lead 
actors into revelatory, unusual performances.  KN

This choice battle-of-the-sexes comedy has been an inspiration for 
countless other films and television series about combative but sexually 
combustible couples. Of the nine movies legendary partners Spencer 
Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made together between 1942 and 1967, 
Adam's Rib is arguably the best, still crackling with witty dialogue, spirited 
discussion of double standards and sexual stereotypes, and wonderful 
performances. The screenplay was written by Tracy and Hepburn's great 
pals, the married team of Ruth Gordon (the actress who won an Oscar in 
Rosemary's Baby) and Garson Kanin. The true story that sparked the 
project was that of husband-and-wife lawyers William and Dorothy 
Whitney, who represented Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Massey in their divorce, 
then divorced each other and married their respective clients.
It doesn't quite come to that in Adam's Rib. When sweet, ditsy blonde 
Doris Attinger—played by sensationally funny Judy Holliday making her 
debut in the role that launched her meteoric career—is charged with 
the attempted murder of her two-timing husband Warren (Tom Ewell), 
proto-feminist attorney Amanda "Pinkie" Bonner (Hepburn) agrees to 
defend her. But Amanda's husband, Adam "Pinky" Bonner (Tracy), is the 
prosecuting attorney, and their courtroom battle quickly extends into 
the bedroom, hostilities aggravated by the attentions shown Amanda 
by smitten songwriter Kip (David Wayne), who composes "Farewell, 
Amanda" in her honor (a song written by Cole Porter).
Director George Cukor, recognizing the inherent theatricality of 
courtroom situations, deliberately keeps the proceedings stagy after the 
comedy-suspense opening sequence of Doris tailing Warren from work 
to the tryst with his floozy mistress, Beryl (Jean Hagen), and the inept 
shooting. The film's long single takes give Hepburn free rein for her 
outrageously crafty showboating in court and allow Tracy to work up his 
indignation at her tactics and principles. Highlights include brainy 
Amanda's early questioning of dimwitted Doris, and the spectacle of 
Adam tearfully getting in touch with his feminine side to get back into 
his wife's good graces. Although some of the arguments may seem 
quaint today, the sophistication is undiminished.  AE

"How can you be so cruel?" asks her aunt. "I have been taught by masters," 
comes the icy reply. William Wyler's unforgettable adaptation of Henry 
James's novel Washington Square (pointlessly remade in 1997) revolves 
around indelible performances, intensified by the director's trademark 
demanding long takes and meticulous mastery of mood, lighting, and 
camera technique. Olivia de Havilland, who received her second 
Academy Award for her performance, is heart-stopping as the dreadfully 
plain, painfully gauche girl marked as a spinster despite the fortune she 
will inherit from the cold, caustic father (Ralph Richardson), who regards 
her as an embarrassment.
Then beautiful, fortune-hunting wastrel Morris Townsend 
(Montgomery Clift) courts her, as insincere as he is irresistible. Over the 
insulting objections of her father and with the connivance of her foolishly 
romantic aunt (Miriam Hopkins), Catherine plots an elopement; when 
her lover decides to take his chances elsewhere, she undergoes a steely 
transformation. After the naive Catherine realizes that she has been jilted, 
de Havilland's slow, exhausted ascent up the stairs is forever haunting.

The Third Man  Carol Reed, 1949
Written for the screen by Graham Greene, Carol Reed's The Third Man 
effectively transfers the urban nightmare world of Hollywood film noir 
of the 1940s to a European setting. Picking up the messy aftermath of 
the war and providing a five-years-on follow-up to the works of British 
thriller writers and European exile filmmakers, it shows the postwar 
consequences of movements expressed in early Hitchcock films (The 
Lady Vanishes [1938] and Secret Agent [1936]), midperiod Fritz Lang (the 
Greene-derived Ministry of Fear [1944]), the Geoffrey Household-inspired 
Man Hunt (1941), and Eric Ambler adaptations like Journey into Fear 
(1942) and The Mask of Dimitrios (1944). Occupied Vienna, divided 
between four military powers and plagued by black-marketing 
scoundrels, is as fantastical a setting as any devised for studio exoticism, 
but Reed and his crew were able to shoot on location, amid rubble and 
glitz, capturing a world of fear that was all too real.
Into this realm of corruption comes American innocent Holly Martins 
(Joseph Cotten). A writer of pulp Westerns, he was somehow asked to 
deliver a serious literary lecture to a cultural group. Only the military 
police sergeant (Bernard Lee) at the back of the hall has ever read any of 
his work. Holly is shocked to learn that his boyhood friend Harry Lime 
(Orson Welles) has recently met a mysterious death and is suspected of 
involvement in a dastardly racket. Holly gets mixed up with one of Harry's 
girlfriends (Alida Valli) and a succession of sinister eccentrics, in search 
of the "third man" who was seen carrying Lime's body away. Harry, as 
everyone except Holly knows, turns out to have faked his own death to 
get away from policeman Calloway (Trevor Howard).
After all these years, it isn't exactly a surprise, but the moment of 
revelation as Harry is caught by a beam of light from a window as a cat 
nuzzles his shoes is still magic. Anton Karras's haunting and unforgettable 
zither theme "plung-ka-plungs" on the soundtrack, and Welles spins a 
virtual cameo into one of the screen's greatest charming villains. The 
Third Man's most famous speech—the "cuckoo clock" anecdote, delivered 
up above the "little dots" on the Vienna Ferris Wheel—was written by 
Welles on the spur of the moment as an addition to Greene's script, filling 
out the character and perhaps securing the picture's lasting greatness.
A rare British film that is as accomplished technically as the best of 
classic Hollywood—Reed never did anything as masterly again—The 
Third Man is an outstanding mix of political thriller, weird romance, gothic 
mystery, and black-and-white romantic agony. Welles, who is truly 
brilliant for five minutes, has hogged all the press, but it's a perfectly 
acted film, with wonderful work from Cotten as the bewildered and 
disappointed hero and the luminous beauty of Italian star Valli as the 
heroine by default. It's a film that constantly shimmers, in its nocturnal 
cityscapes, its glowing haunted faces, and the gushing waters of the 
sewers in which Lime is finally flushed away.  KN

Among the earliest of the Ealing comedies produced by Sir Michael 
Balcon's West London hothouse of comedic creativity, and a prime 
example of their distinctively British humor, Kind Hearts and Coronets 
is without equal for grace and savoir faire in black comedy. It is 
sophisticated, deliciously sly, and resolved with another Ealing trademark, 
the smart sting in the tale.
Eight members of the snobbish, wealthy, and aristocratic D'Ascoyne 
family stand between their bitter, coolly self-possessed poor relation 
Louis Mazzini (suave Dennis Price) and a dukedom, provoking him to 
mass murder in Robert Hamer's audaciously elegant black comedy of 
class. The film was adapted by Hamer and John Dighton from a pungent 
novel of society decadence, Israel Rank, by Roy Horniman, but it was also 
arguably influenced by Charlie Chaplin's more controversial Monsieur 
Verdoux (1947). In his inexorable, unscrupulous rise, Price's Machiavellian 
Mazzini becomes fatefully entangled with two different women: Edith 
D'Ascoyne (Valerie Hobson), the touchingly gracious widow of one of his 
victims, and Sibella, the fabulously eccentric, dangerously feline sex 
kitten played by Ealing favorite Joan Greenwood.
All eight of the clearly inbred, dotty D'Ascoynes—including the 
hatchet-faced suffragette Lady Agatha who is shot down in a balloon, 
the bluff general condemned to short-lived enjoyment of an explosive 
pot of caviar, and the insane admiral who does Mazzini's job for him by 
going down with his ship—are famously played by Ealing's man of a 
thousand faces, unrecognizable from one film to the next (and in this 
case from one scene to the next), the delightful Alec Guinness.
Hamer's all-too-brief directorial heyday peaked with Kind Hearts and 
Coronets. He had come to the film with a valuable background as an 
editor and found a balance between the smart dialogue and pithy, satiric 
visual vignettes. The slick black-and-white work of wartime news 
cameraman-turned-cinematographer Douglas Slocombe led to a much 
longer and prolific career: he shot many classic British films of the 1960s 
and, later, such international hits as the Indiana Jones trilogy.  AE

1949

Along with Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets (both also 
1949), Whisky Galore! was in the first vintage of celebrated postwar 
comedies from Britain's Ealing Studios under producer Sir Michael Balcon. 
Universally admired, the film was key in establishing the distinctive, self-
deprecating, and understated satiric tone of those following, as well as 
the theme of defiant little people triumphing over those more powerful. 
Alexander "Sandy" Mackendrick's influential culture-clash comedy, 
shot beautifully on location on Barra in the Outer Hebrides in the style 
of a mock documentary, sees the sanctimonious, by-the-book, and 
teetotaling English Home Guard captain Basil Radford hunt for a 
foundered ship's "salvaged" cargo of malt whisky. Intended for America, 
the cargo is seized by thirsty islanders deprived by wartime, and Radford 
is well and truly foiled by the wily natives of Todday, who run rings around 
him and the Excise men. The story, immortalized by writer Compton 
MacKenzie, was inspired by the true "disappearance" of 50,000 cases of 
whisky after a cargo ship was wrecked off the Isle of Eriskay. 
Whisky Galore! is more dated than some of the other Ealing comedies, 
though the quaint charm is countered by the film's hectic hilarity, the 
affectionate and astute social observation, the authenticity of Hebridean 
life, and the delightful performances. Ealing's leading English enchantress 
Joan Greenwood is superb as the canny publican Macroon's (Wylie 
Watson) flirtatious daughter, as are the mainly genuine Scots players like 
James Robertson Justice, Gordon Jackson, and the droll narrator, Finlay 
Currie. The universal appeal of the film's antiauthoritarian humor lies in 
its idealization of a remote, isolated village world full of eccentrics, cards, 
pretty lasses, and gutsy, commonsensical folk pricking the balloons of 
the pompous and bureaucratic types opposing them.
The Scottish (though American-born) Mackendrick, director of three 
of Ealing's most sparkling gems (the other two being The Man in the White 
Suit [1951] and The Ladykillers [1955]) would prove equally impressive 
directing drama later in his career, after his move to America, notably 
with the 1957 film Sweet Smell of Success.  AE

1949

Two sailors, Gabey (Gene Kelly) and Chip (Frank Sinatra), in the company 
of cab driver Brunhilde (Betty Garrett), burst into an art school's life-
modeling session. They gasp at the sight of a naked woman, glimpsed 
from the back. The model turns: She is merely wearing a backless dress. 
Then our trio rushes out through the swinging doors they entered 
through: revealed are a third sailor, Ozzie (Jules Munshin), and his 
anthropologist girlfriend Claire (Ann Miller), furtively kissing.
The lightly subversive fun of On the Town is contained in this elaborate 
gag. It is basically about a hunt for casual sex: Three sailors, on twenty-
four-hour leave, want to get laid. Of course, on the surface, the film 
attempts to disavow this base impulse—there is, after all, Gabey's love 
for the sweet, innocent "Miss Turnstiles," Ivy (Vera-Ellen)—but the proof 
is everywhere: in cultural references (surrealist art; a museum devoted 
to "homo erectus"), double entendres (Brunhilde: "He wanted to see the 
sights, and I showed him plenty"), and above all in the high energy of 
the song-and-dance numbers, into which all eroticism is artfully 
sublimated—though there's nothing particularly hidden in Miller's 
bravura performance of "Prehistoric Man!"
On the Town hangs many, varied delights on its simple but driving 
"lifetime in a day" premise, codirectors Kelly and Stanley Donen still 
some years away from their ideal of the dramatically integrated musical. 
Once the sailors split up, the film becomes especially busy, ranging from 
low burlesque ("You Can Count On Me") to high ballet, the latter via the 
Sinatra-Garret duet "Come Up to My Place," a highlight of Leonard 
Bernstein's jazzy score. Proceedings make room for all manner of 
reveries (Gabey's zany imagining of Ivy as a gal for all seasons), 
digressions, and gags.
The left-wing aspect of Kelly's life and career is often overlooked. On 
the Town has, lurking under its surface alongside that sex drive, a political 
aspiration: This "city symphony" (taking advantage of some terrific location 
photography) is truly an ode to the joys and woes of ordinary workers, 
cramming experiences into the cracks of a punishing schedule.  AM

Orphée  Jean Cocteau, 1950
Orpheus
245
"It is the privilege of legends to be timeless," notes the narrator at the 
outset. And so it has proved for Jean Cocteau's fantasy film Orpheus, an 
infinitely strange and beguiling allegory that is also a kind of coded 
autobiography. Orphée (played by Cocteau's lover, Jean Marais) is an 
acclaimed poet who has fallen out of fashion. After a despised rival is 
knocked over by two uniformed motorcyclists, he becomes fascinated 
with the Princess Death (María Casarès), but when his neglected wife 
Eurydice (Marie Déa) dies, Orphée follows into the underworld to 
reclaim her.
Looked at simply as a special-effects movie, this is still a landmark 
film for Cocteau's ingenious use of reverse motion and back projection. 
Mirrors are the doors to the other side ("Look at a mirror for a lifetime 
you will see Death at work"), though only poets can move through 
them at will. Purgatory is a slow-motion limbo where the laws of physics 
are suspended. Although the enigmatic narrative is occasionally 
confusing (it doesn't help that Orphée and Cocteau alike seem more 
taken with Death than with Eurydice), the film's poetic imagination 
is spellbinding.  TCh
The Asphalt Jungle  John Huston, 1950
Perhaps the most finely detailed "caper" film Hollywood ever produced, 
John Huston's study of a jewelry store robbery shows the business 
relationships between career criminals of different kinds—from a 
mastermind plotter to the "box man" who breaks into the safe, to the 
"muscle" needed to handle the guards. Such crime is merely "a left-
handed form of endeavor," suggests the "respectable" businessman who 
is to fence the proceeds.
The Asphalt Jungle concentrates not only on the robbery but also on 
the personal lives of the gang members, who are individualized with 
notable touches of dialogue and visual style. Huston expertly handles a 
fine ensemble of actors, including Marilyn Monroe—who plays an old 
man's dizzy-headed mistress in one of her most important early roles. 
As in most Huston films, the thematic emphasis is on the joys and 
sorrows of male bonding, with the criminals' inevitable defeat by the 
law—and their own weaknesses—rendered almost heroic. The gang 
leader Doc Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is captured because he lingers 
in a café watching a beautiful young girl dance, and tough guy Dix 
(Sterling Hayden) bleeds to death as he tries to return to the country 
and the horses he loves. Such melodramatic elements contrast 
interestingly with the film's otherwise grim portrayal of alienation, 
betrayal, and sociopathy.  RBP

Rashomon  Akira Kurosawa, 1950
Three travelers collect under a ruined temple during a storm. Woodcutter 
(Takashi Shimura), Priest (Minoru Chiaki), and Commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) 
build a fire and wonder about a troubling story. So begins the story-
within-a-story about a married couple and bandit who meet on a forest 
road. Woodcutter later finds the husband's corpse and testifies before a 
police commission investigating what happened. The explanation so 
horrifies Priest and entertains Commoner it occupies them through the 
storm with four depictions of a crime.
Plotted with competing points-of-view in flashback style, framed with 
a fluid, moving camera, and shot under a canopy of dappled light, 
Rashomon details unreliable perspectives. The veracity of on-screen 
characters and depicted actions are therefore rendered false and 
misleading. Facts are submitted into evidence but immediately 
questioned. Disagreement among the overlapping stories of husband, 
wife, and bandit complicate straightforward reportage. In short, every 
narrator is untrustworthy, along with the overall film.
Nothing less than an epistemological nightmare, Akira Kurosawa's 
Oscar winner still concludes with an infusion of moral goodness. 
Although Rashomon implicitly explores the lost possibility of renewal 
and redemption, its central theme about discovering truth as a 
distinction between good and evil is upheld through simple acts of 
kindness and sacrifice.
As the forest road is explored from the perspective of the bandit 
Tajomaru (Toshirô Mifune), he is characterized as a hellion. After seeing 
Masako (Machiko Kyô), he ravishes her into willing submission before 
cutting loose her samurai husband Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) so the two 
men can fight until the latter is killed. From Masako's point of view, she 
is raped, shamed, then rebuffed by her husband, and submitting to 
hysterical rage she kills him. Agreeing only that he was killed, Takehiro 
speaks through a medium (Fumiko Honma) explaining how his wife 
equalled Tajomaru's passion before demanding his death at the hands 
of the bandit. Seeing no good result in murder, Tajomaru flees, as does 
Masako, leaving Takehiro behind to commit suicide.
Each story is told in a self-serving way. Tajomaru is therefore a ruthless 
criminal, Masako a set-upon innocent, and Takehiro a proud warrior. All 
true, it seems, until Woodcutter explains what he saw from the shadows. 
His perspective affirms the wife's shallowness, the bandit's false bravado, 
and the husband's cowardice. It also conceals his own complicity in the 
crime until Commoner draws this out, dismissing the search for truth.
Kurosawa ends the bleak tale on a positive note. An abandoned baby 
is discovered beneath the temple ruin. Woodcutter intoduces the idea 
of human goodness by  taking it upon himself in redemption to care for 
the orphan. A consistent conclusion, given Rashomon's formal schizophrenia 
in a brilliant narrative structure—Kurosawa's first masterwork.  GC-Q

Considered one of the sharpest and darkest films ever made about show 
business, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1950 drama was taken from a 1946 
Cosmopolitan magazine short story called "The Wisdom of Eve." Avoided 
by other studios for four years, the combination of Mankiewicz's cynical, 
witty screenplay, and a high-caliber cast transformed the story into an 
enormous cinematic success. All About Eve was nominated for a then-
record fourteen Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture 
and Best Supporting Actor (for George Sanders), as well as Best Director 
and Best Screenplay awards for Mankiewicz. Nominations went to Bette 
Davis, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, and Thelma Ritter, thus holding the 
record for most female acting nominations in a single film.
Opening with an acceptance speech given by gracious young actress 
Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), the film pans over the audience. Addison 
DeWitt (Sanders) begins a narration which goes back in time to the real 
tale of how such success was achieved. Bette Davis is Margo Channing, 
an aging, forty-year-old Broadway actress who befriends Eve, a young 
fan apparently plagued by a hard life. Margo's dresser Birdie (Ritter) is 
the first to see through Eve's sob story, saying, "What a story! Everything 
but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end." Eve repays Margo's trust 
by worming into her idol's professional and personal life with more than 
a few lies. Eve goes on to deceive Margo's best friend (Holm), beguile her 
loyal but devious critic (Sanders), and vainly attempt to steal away her 
fiancé Bill (Gary Merrill, Davis's real-life husband). In a brief but dazzling 
cameo, Marilyn Monroe appears on the arm of DeWitt at Margo's party, 
the same party where Margo utters the now famous line, "Fasten your 
seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night."
Having also won an Oscar in 1949 for A Letter to Three Wives, some see 
Mankiewicz's victory in All About Eve as final vindication of his talent in 
comparison to brother Herman, who won the Best Original Screenplay 
Oscar for Citizen Kane. That debate aside, All About Eve is widely considered 
to be the crowning achievement in Davis's lengthy career; its only flaw is 
Baxter, who seems to be nothing but pure ambition in womanly form.  KK

Winchester '73  Anthony Mann, 1950
249
The first of eight collaborations between director Anthony Mann and 
actor James Stewart, Winchester '73 sets the tone for this legendary 
partnership. The Westerns these two men made together are unusually 
bitter and starkly beautiful, with fascinating overtones of moral uncertainty.
Winchester '73 revolves around a high-powered rifle that changes 
hands repeatedly. Each man who comes into possession of it is changed 
in some way—sometimes for good, sometimes for bad. It all comes to a 
head in a shooting contest, for which the prize is the titular rifle itself.
The cast is extremely strong. Shelley Winters is excellent, and the 
supporting players include such versatile character actors as Millard 
Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Will Geer, and the incomparable Dan 
Duryea. (See if you can spot a young Tony Curtis, and Rock Hudson as 
an Indian brave!)
Now regarded as an actor of unusual versatility, Stewart was, at the 
time of the film's production, concerned about perceptions regarding 
his limited breadth. His character, Lin McAdam, is an unusual hero—
somewhat tentative, even if he is the film's moral center. Stewart's 
performances for Mann would get increasingly complex and cynical in 
films like The Man from Laramie (1955) and The Naked Spur (1953) 
proving beyond a doubt that this master of the craft could adeptly 
handle any role that came his way.  EdeS
Rio Grande  John Ford, 1950
The last installment of John Ford's "Cavalry Trilogy"—Fort Apache (1948) 
and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) being the other two—Rio Grande is 
a minor work, albeit a key one, allegedly undertaken to secure financing 
for the director's personal project, The Quiet Man (1952). It's less 
revisionary, mythmaking, or elegiac than the previous Cavalry films, 
offering a mix of soapsuds, barracks larking, and hard-riding action.
Crusty Yankee Captain Kirby York (John Wayne, not quite recreating 
his Kirby York of Fort Apache)  reconciles with estranged Southern wife 
Kathleen (Maureen O'Hara)—whose mansion he burned down during 
the Civil War—in order to share the raising of their raw recruit son (Claude 
Jarman Jr.). The son becomes a man under his father's influence without 
losing his mother's sensitivity. York leads his men in pursuit of Indian 
raiders who have snuck up from Mexico with kidnap in mind, suggesting 
the embryo of Ford and Wayne's masterpiece, The Searchers (1956). This 
is a less neurotic, more action-oriented quest and a rare Ford movie that 
unquestioningly adopts a goodies versus baddies view of the Indian wars.
Ben Johnson shows off his rodeo skills and great riding stunt work, and 
the Sons of the Pioneers add to the folkloric feel with appropriate ballads, 
though "Bold Fenian Men" is an unlikely favorite out West in the 1870s.  KN

Sunset Blvd.  Billy Wilder, 1950
Unemployed screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden), floating dead in a 
swimming pool, recounts his doomed personal and professional 
involvement with megalomaniac silent-movie queen Norma Desmond 
(Gloria Swanson). A flapper vampire whose attempts to stay youthful 
into her fifties paradoxically make her seem a thousand years old, Norma 
lives in a decaying mansion on Sunset Boulevard, holding a midnight 
funeral for her pet monkey ("He must have been a very important chimp," 
muses Joe), scrawling an unproducible script, and dreaming of an 
impossible comeback ("I hate that word! It's a return!") as Salome. In 
attendance is a sinister butler (Erich von Stroheim) who used to be her 
favored director and, incidentally, her first husband.
Usually not given to ostentatious visuals, Wilder is encouraged by 
this scenario to create compositions that evoke the lair of the Phantom 
of the Opera and Charles Foster Kane's Xanadu, a huge close-up of white-
gloved hands playing a wheezy pipe organ as the trapped gigolo flutters 
in the background. Wilder's acidic, yet nostalgic, traipse through the film 
industry's haunted house is a picture that can be endlessly rewatched, 
even after its influence has seeped into the horror genre (Robert Aldrich's 
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? [1962]) and  spun off an Andrew Lloyd 
Webber stage adaptation—combining strange affection for has-been 
Norma and never-was Joe with a somewhat sadistic use of such ravaged 
and frozen silent faces as Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson.
One of Sunset Blvd.'s unstressed ironies is that although Norma can't 
get away with her insanity ("No one leaves a star!"), the industry allows 
and indeed encourages everyone else to act like a monster: Cecil B. 
DeMille (playing himself) gently reminds Norma that the picture business 
has changed, but Wilder concludes his scene by having the camera note 
his polished riding boots and absurdly outdated on-set strut. Although 
they recognized their chances for one last blaze of glory, Swanson (who 
took the role after Mary Pickford turned it down) and von Stroheim (who 
is forced to watch an extract from Queen Kelly, an unfinished 1920s 
disaster he directed Swanson in) understood the cruelty of Wilder's vision 
and the way he made monsters of all of them. It's a hard and cynical film, 
which struggles with its doomed but sweet "normal" love affair: In the 
end, Norma is as terrified that Joe is writing a script ("Untitled Love Story") 
with D-girl Nancy Olson as she is that he will leave her for a younger rival. 
Swanson ("I am big, it's the pictures that got small") is vibrant in her 
madness, climaxing with a moment of unforgettable horror-glamor as 
she vamps toward a newsreel cameraman during her arrest for murder 
and declares that she is ready for her close-up, even as Wilder pulls back 
to frame her in a long shot that emphasizes her isolation in insanity as 
the big carnival of a celebrity murder scandal begins. This points the way 
to Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951) and a culture of media-exploited crime 
that remains horribly alive more than half a century on.  KN

Although Los olvidados invokes many conventions of social-problem films, 
it goes far beyond them. Set in the slums of Mexico City, Luis Buñuel's 
scathing masterpiece centers on two doomed boys: Pedro (Alfonso 
Mejía), who struggles to be good, and the older, incorrigible Jaibo (Roberto 
Cobo), who keeps popping up like a demon brother to lead Pedro astray. 
Critical of Italian Neorealism, Buñuel demanded that the concept of realism 
be expanded to include such essentials as dream, poetry, and irrationality—
represented by Pedro's nightmare, in which tangled threads of guilt and 
wish fulfillment resolve into the sensational image of a slab of raw meat 
offered by the hungry boy's mother, and by Jaibo's dying vision, in which 
the angel of death appears as a mangy dog leading him down a dark road.
Other lost souls in Buñuel's city of the damned include the nasty blind 
beggar, Carmelo (Miguel Inclán); the abandoned boy, Ojitos (Mário 
Ramírez), enslaved by Carmelo; the nymphet Meche (Alma Delia Fuentes), 
whose bare thighs are splashed with milk in one of the film's many 
provocative images; and the virtuous Julián (Javier Amézcua), quickly 
slaughtered by Jaibo. Borrowing a tag line from Nashville (1975), one 
could say that the final essential character is you, the hypocrite spectator. 
A crucial factor that elevates Los olvidados above other social-problem 
films is its aggressive discomfiting of the viewer—most startlingly when 
Pedro, sulking in a reform school, hurls an egg at the camera.
In less spectacular but still striking ways, Los olvidados discourages 
the spectator from settling into the position of noble sensitivity commonly 
cultivated by liberal message films. For one thing, the tone is too caustic, 
distancing, and contradictory—as when the pathetic spectacle of blind 
Carmelo beaten by Jaibo's gang is capped with a derisive shot of a 
gawking chicken. In addition, Buñuel neatly sidesteps a veritable catalog 
of message-film cop-outs, including the use of a surrogate figure to guide 
our feelings and the concentration on special cases to ameliorate the 
larger problem. Los olvidados has been criticized for callousness and a 
lack of constructive solutions, but Buñuel is an artist, not a legislator, and 
the compassion of this remarkably honest film might be difficult to 
recognize only because it isn't cushioned with sentimentality.  MR

In a Lonely Place  Nicholas Ray, 1950
253
In a Lonely Place qualifies as a masterpiece on many grounds: as the 
single best film of cult director Nicholas Ray; as a uniquely romantic 
and doom-haunted noir drama; as a showcase for personal best 
performances by Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame; and as one of 
the most insightful films about Hollywood.
Short-fused screenwriter Dix Steele (Bogart) is suspected of an 
especially vicious murder, but his next-door neighbor Laurel Gray 
(Grahame) can give him an alibi. This leads the pair into a passionate 
affair that is undermined as Laurel becomes terrified by Dix's violent 
streak, coming to wonder if he really did commit the murder. After 
years of playing romantic tough guys, Bogart here gets deeper inside 
his own persona, revealing the neurotic edge that might have made 
Sam Spade or Rick Blaine unstable and becoming absolutely 
terrifying in the sequences where he explodes in fist-frenzy at the 
deserving and undeserving alike.
The film's downbeat subject matter is rendered exhilarating by 
Ray's dark visuals and a streak of almost surrealist poetry. Dorothy B. 
Hughes's fine novel is interestingly adapted: In the book, Steele really 
does turn out to be the murderer, but the screenplay is actually 
bleaker in that finally what matters isn't that he's innocent but that 
he easily could not be.  KN
Ace in the Hole  Billy Wilder, 1951
Ace in the Hole is noted for two things: It's the only collaboration 
between Kirk Douglas and Billy Wilder, and it's one of the angriest and 
most bitter films ever to come out of the Hollywood studio system.
Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a cynical, arrogant reporter exiled to a 
small-town newspaper in New Mexico after getting fired from several 
big-city papers. When he goes out to cover a story about a prospector 
(Richard Benedict) trapped under a rockslide, he sees his chance to 
make it back to the big time. He manipulates the sheriff into delaying 
the rescue efforts with the promise of luring tourists, thrill seekers, 
and onlookers coming to be a part of this stirring human interest 
story. Tatum whips up the media frenzy, positions himself as the sole 
reporter with the scoop, and escalates the event into a carnival. Even 
the hapless prospector's wife (Jan Sterling), a self-serving poster child 
for High Maintenance, is drawn into Tatum's spin as she proves his 
match in venal self-interest. And everything goes as you would 
expect—horribly, horribly badly. 
The anger lingers far beyond the story's end, and Wilder's trademark 
verbal zingers barely sugarcoat the story's bitter core, which indicts us 
all. Poignant and thoughtful.  AT

Is there any wonder why Alfred Hitchcock was drawn to author Patricia 
Highsmith's Strangers on a Train? Her first novel, Strangers, includes 
elements found in virtually all of Hitchcock's films: a fascination with 
murder, mix-ups, and barely suppressed homosexual urges. Needless to 
say, it didn't take long for the director to purchase the rights and get to 
work, and with a great screenplay from Raymond Chandler—with a 
touch-up by Ben Hecht, among others—the film turned out to be one 
of Hitchcock's most effective.
Strangers on a Train begins innocently enough. Guy Haines (Farley 
Granger), a successful tennis player, literally bumps into fellow train 
passenger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), an eccentric and excitable 
stranger. Both have someone in their lives they'd rather be without. 
Guy wants his wife out of the picture and Bruno his domineering 
father, so Bruno devises the "perfect" murder to solve both men's 
problems: They'll simply swap victims. Guy brushes off the crazy idea, 
but soon Bruno is blackmailing him into fulfilling his part of the bargain.
Almost a black comedy, Strangers on a Train also works as a bizarre 
courtship ritual, in which Granger plays the straight man to Walker's 
flamboyant lunatic. As usual, Hitchcock takes particular glee in 
exploiting the plight of his protagonist. The dialogue sparkles as Walker 
tightens the screws around Granger, leading to what could be the most 
suspenseful tennis game in movie history. But this being Hitchcock, the 
thrilling conclusion takes place on a moving carousel, with Granger and 
Walker wrestling as the out-of-control ride spins faster and faster.
It's a jarring finale to what is largely an internalized film about 
madness, blackmail, and guilt, yet Hitchcock pulls it off brilliantly. As 
the campy charm of Walker leads to more overtly murderous impulses, 
his stature as a villain grows, and he can only be dispatched in a 
manner that does justice to his larger-than-life personality. Indeed, 
Walker (in his last role) dominates the film. He's the ego unleashed, the 
flashy flip side to the more repressed insanity Hitchcock would explore 
nine years later in Psycho.  JKl

Although Tennessee Williams's play was meant to be all about the 
desperate, poetic heroism of Blanche DuBois, Marlon Brando's uncouth, 
sweaty animal magnetism opposite Vivien Leigh's frail, faded belle 
commanded the screen, just as it had electrified Broadway theatergoers 
opposite Jessica Tandy's Blanche four years earlier (a production also 
directed by Elia Kazan). Brando's brooding naturalism, his earthy sexuality, 
and his howls of "Stell-ahhhh!" remain a nearly impossible act to follow 
for the actors who have subsequently assayed the brutish Stanley Kowalski.
Kazan's screen version—also scripted by Williams but subjected to 
censorship of some frank content—won three of the four acting Oscars 
for Leigh, who had also played Blanche in London's West End production, 
directed by her husband, Sir Laurence Olivier. Oscars were also won by 
supporting actors Kim Hunter and Karl Malden, but Brando was beaten 
to the post by Humphrey Bogart (for The African Queen). Nevertheless, his 
impact in Streetcar placed him at the forefront of modern screen actors, 
the most famous and influential exponent of the Actors Studio's "Method."
Having lost the long-in-decline family estate to back taxes and her 
reputation while seeking oblivion or solace, Blanche arrives in New 
Orleans to stay with her pregnant sister, Stella, and churlish brother-in-
law, Stanley, in their cramped, sweltering apartment. Stanley, convinced 
that Blanche is holding out on a mythical inheritance, is driven wild by 
the neurotic woman, pathetically clinging to her refinement and 
delusions. Under Stanley's resentful bullying, Blanche's last hopes are 
brutally destroyed, and she retreats into a psychotic state.
Although it was Kazan's seventh feature film, Streetcar is theatrical 
rather than cinematic. Its power emanates from the performances, 
particularly the absorbing duel between the poignant, ethereal, stagey 
Leigh and the explosive, instinctive Brando, who are as different in their 
acting approaches as Blanche and Stanley are in personality. Kazan, who 
was a cofounder of the Actors Studio in 1947 and still a force in American 
theater at the time, was showing little interest in the visual possibilities 
of the medium, but his way with actors is amply apparent here.  AE

Pandora and the Flying Dutchman  
Albert Lewin, 1951
Once dismissed as pretentious and preposterous, the reputation of this 
magical romantic fantasy has steadily grown over the years. Set in the 
early 1930s in a town called Esperanza ("Hope") on "the Mediterranean 
coast of Spain," where idle rich exiles mingle with working fisherfolk, 
Pandora and the Flying Dutchman begins with the discovery of two 
drowned corpses, hands locked together. In flashback, Pandora Reynolds 
(Ava Gardner), an American singer who specializes in driving men to 
death and distraction, meets her predestined match in Hendrick Van 
Der Zee (James Mason), captain and sole crew of a luxury yacht; he turns 
out to be the Flying Dutchman, cursed to sail the seas until he finds a 
woman willing to die for him.
Producer, director, and writer Albert Lewin, one of Hollywood's few 
open intellectuals, was a man of ostentatious literary leanings (his films 
are littered with quoted poetry, to the point that Pandora makes an 
offhand remark about how everything people say to her sounds like a 
quotation) and fantastical romanticism (all his pictures are about 
impossible loves that find perfect moments between curses). Shot in 
dark-hued but ravishing Technicolor by Jack Cardiff, the film is a tribute 
to the beauty of Ava Gardner, with footnotes about the brooding 
intensity of James Mason.  KN

An American in Paris  Vincente Minnelli, 1951
Vincente Minnelli's joyous musical won six Academy Awards—including 
Best Picture (over supposed favorites A Streetcar Named Desire and A Place 
in the Sun)—as well as a special citation for choreographer-star Gene 
Kelly and the Thalberg Memorial Award for MGM producer Arthur Freed. 
An American in Paris was an original for the screen, conceived by Freed 
as a vehicle for Kelly and constructed around a clutch of George Gershwin's 
most popular songs (including "I Got Rhythm" and "'S Wonderful").
Penniless artist Kelly brings his athletic exuberance to a sanitized 
Montmartre, tap dances with urchins, falls for gamine muse Leslie 
Caron, and vies for her with suave French singer Georges Guétary. 
Meanwhile, jealous patron Nina Foch seethes, all dryly observed by the 
composer pal played by pianist and Gershwin exponent Oscar Levant. 
Sending up the penchant of Lost Generation Americans for immersing 
themselves in a little culture française, Minnelli fills the film with vitality, 
romance, and a riot of color. The sensational, innovative highlight is 
Kelly's original eighteen-minute ballet to the title music, staged through 
sets in the style of French artists, notably Toulouse Lautrec, and the 
blissfully romantic Kelly-Caron "Our Love Is Here To Stay" dance number 
on the banks of the river Seine.  AE

1951
John Huston's 1951 classic is one of Hollywood's most impressive, 
entertaining, and compelling adventure stories. Based on C.S. Forester's 
1935 novel of the same name, The African Queen narrates the unlikely love 
affair between tramp steamer captain Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) 
and puritanical missionary spinster Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn). Rose 
can barely tolerate Charlie, but fate throws them together. Caught amid 
the violence of the impending World War I, Rose must escape downriver 
with Charlie in his battered tugboat. However, a German warship blocks 
their exit route, and Rose launches a plan to rig Charlie's cargo with 
explosive materials to thwart the Germans and make their escape. 
The adventure tale is secondary to the rocky relationship between 
Charlie and Rose, and The African Queen's more interesting allegory 
plays out in their love story. Rose's prim, repressed British spinster is 
seduced by Charlie's unshaven, gin-swigging American masculinity. 
Although set in 1914, the film's post-World War II subtext of the United 
States's emergence as a primary international player as the influence of 
traditional colonial powers waned is unmistakable.
Hepburn and Bogart are tremendously enjoyable as the leads. Both 
veteran, grizzled stars using their trademark gestures and tics to full 
effect, they suffuse the film with a light, comic air that does not diminish 
the action. The chemistry between them is perfect, and the movement 
from polar opposites to comrades and lovers plays out effortlessly and 
convincingly, although they are at their most entertaining when they 
are at each other's throats. The color photography and truly astounding 
location shots of the jungle all add to The African Queen's tremendous 
appeal. Bogart won his only Oscar for the film; Huston (for direction and 
writing), Hepburn, and screenwriter James Agee were also nominated. 
Yet this description and the many subsequent accolades that the film 
has received cannot capture all of its magic. Even after repeat viewings, 
it never fails to impart a good feeling, and of the many wonderful films 
summarized in this book, it truly is a must-see.  RH

In adapting Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, George Stevens 
was faced with the difficulty of making the novelist's grimly naturalist 
tale of class warfare interesting to a 1950s audience more eager for 
entertainment than political instruction. His solution was to emphasize 
the erotic longings of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) for the 
beautiful Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). George is stuck in a dead-end 
job at a Chicago hotel when he meets his wealthy uncle for the first 
time. Seeing a chance to escape the impoverished, intensely religious 
environment he grew up in, he quits his job and hitchhikes across the 
country to work at the man's factory in upstate New York. But George, 
dominated by feelings of deprivation and exclusion, shows neither the 
drive nor the initiative to work his way up. In fact, he is so weak that he 
has barely begun work at the factory when he violates one of its cardinal 
rules. Dating a fellow employee, he ends up impregnating the poor, 
desperate woman, in whom he has already lost interest.
A Place in the Sun became one of classic Hollywood's most touching 
and tragic romances, a result of Stevens's careful coaching of the 
principals and his artful manipulation of two contrasting styles. George's 
fairy-tale encounter with the innocent Angela is dominated by intimate 
camerawork, especially juxtaposed close-ups composed in soft focus. 
Scenes in the factory, with his first girlfriend, Alice (Shelley Winters), and 
later in the courtroom, are photographed in a film noir style, emphasizing 
chiaroscuro lighting and unbalanced compositions that express the 
threat circumstances pose to George's desire for his "place in the sun."
Pregnant, Alice threatens to expose George to his family if he doesn't 
marry her; he is saved only because the town hall is closed for a holiday 
when the couple arrives. George suggests a lake outing in a small boat; 
his intention is that there should be an "accident" and that Alice will drown. 
He cannot go through with the murder, but then Alice, frightened, tips 
over the boat. She drowns because he doesn't try to save her, and George 
pays with his life for his indifference. Stevens, however, makes him more 
memorable as a tragic lover than as a socio-political object lesson.  BP

Journal d'un curé de campagne  
Diary of a Country Priest  Robert Bresson, 1951
259
One of the cinema's greatest artists was searching for inspiration, and he 
found it in the Diary of a Country Priest. With imagination, courage, and 
rigor, Robert Bresson discovered that filmmaking did not require big 
budgets, stars, or special effects. The cinema could tell any story, provoke 
any emotion, open itself to all the material and immaterial, private and 
collective themes through the most elementary uses of its true nature.
Georges Bernanos's novel tells the tale of a young priest living in the 
countryside dealing with the difficulties of everyday life and the 
interrogation of his actions and his faith. Bernanos refuses to leave either 
believers or atheists in peace, opening up chasms in the concrete world. 
Bresson's adaptation of the Diary of a Country Priest is a humble 
achievement, one that shows what the Christian message is based on—a 
message that the cinema is designed to translate into images and 
sounds: the word made into flesh.
Cinema is the concrete and communal accomplishment of the 
Mystery of Incarnation. Bresson's film demonstrates that everything 
can become possible: joking with death, writing on the screen, playing 
with desire, watching the insights of the psyche, generating fascination 
for life in rural France in the mid-twentieth century, and confronting 
religious questions.  J-MF

The Lavender Hill Mob  Charles Crichton, 1951
Along with the 1955 film The Ladykillers, also a stickup caper, The Lavender 
Hill Mob is the laugh-out-loud funniest of the celebrated Ealing comedies 
produced by Sir Michael Balcon and internationally beloved for their 
irreverent, ironic, inimitably British humor. Peerless Alec Guinness plays 
the bespectacled, insignificant bank clerk who has it in mind to finance 
a high-living retirement as recompense for a career being taken for 
granted. He plans a daring gold bullion robbery with souvenir maker 
Stanley Holloway and inept career burglars Sid James and Alfie Bass in 
one-time policeman T.E.B. "Tibby" Clarke's Oscar-winning screenplay.
The film is a master class in neat plotting and incident, served 
superbly by Charles Crichton's exhilarating direction, particularly of the 
loot snafu at the Eiffel Tower (Guinness and Holloway hurtling down 
the spiral stairs in vain pursuit of the English schoolgirls who have 
innocently purchased erroneously switched, solid gold models of the 
Parisian landmark) and the riotous chase climax (in which, at one point, 
a singing Welsh policeman grabs a ride on the running board of the 
aghast fleeing duo's car). Check out young Audrey Hepburn in the 
opening scene in Rio, where a benevolent, dapper Guinness tells his story 
to an interested party.  AE

Robert Wise's 1951 science-fiction drama based on Farewell to the Master, 
a short story by Harry Bates, hit a nerve with nuclear-war weary and 
politician-wary audiences of the time. Opening almost as a documentary, 
it spreads a chilling antiwar message via spectacular special effects and 
memorable characterizations. More than a B-movie, it is the first popular 
adult science-fiction film to send out a real message about humanity.
An alien emissary called Klaatu (Michael Rennie) lands in Washington, 
D.C., to deliver the message that war on Earth must stop. His spacecraft 
surrounded by guns and tanks, Klaatu is accidentally injured and whisked 
away to a military hospital, leaving only Gort (Lock Martin), a seven-foot-
tall robot, to guard the craft. Faceless, speechless, and possessing a 
deadly laserlike ray, Gort is invincible. The only way to get him to stop 
defending the spacecraft is by uttering, "Gort, Klaatu barada niktoh," a 
sentence learned by heart by virtually every child who has seen the film. 
Klaatu escapes from the hospital and meets Helen (Patricia Neal) 
and her son Bobby (Billy Gray). It is the beautiful, intelligent Helen who 
must disarm the deadly Gort. To prove his power and lend weight to 
his message of peace, Klaatu devises a plan to stop all mechanical 
movement in the world (with the exception of airplanes and hospitals).
The role of Klaatu was originally intended for Claude Rains but a 
scheduling conflict opened the part for Rennie, whose angular face and 
calm demeanor lend a remote, gentle superiority to the character. Neal, 
a symbol of feminine bravery, sums up the best of what humanity has 
to offer. Gort was played by Lock Martin, a 7'7" usher at Los Angeles' 
Graumann's Chinese Theater. Burdened by the heavy suit, Martin needed 
extra help to hold Neal in his arms, and in some scenes assisting wires 
are easily seen. To make the spacecraft appear seamless, the door crevice 
was puttied in and painted with silver. The putty tore open, allowing the 
door to suddenly appear without visual warning. Never bettered, The 
Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic on many fronts, not the least for its 
antiwar message and clever visual effects as well as Bernard Herrmann's 
haunting use of the theremin, an early electronic instrument.  KK

Director John Ford is most famous for his celebrations of American 
history and culture, but he also made a number of films that explored 
his Celtic roots, of which The Quiet Man is perhaps the most successful. 
A mixture of drama and comedy, the film traces the homecoming of 
Irish-American Sean Thornton (John Wayne) to the "old sod," where he 
begins a passionate and stormy relationship with Mary Kate Danaher 
(Maureen O'Hara). The Quiet Man features plenty of Ford-style action, 
climaxing in ex-boxer Sean's fistfight with Mary's brother Will (Victor 
McLaglen) over his refusal to grant the American Mary's hand.
The battle ends with both men getting too drunk (during pauses in 
the action) to continue; they end as friends and, ultimately, family. Yet 
the film is not really about masculine values. Mary is much more than 
the simple object of their contention. Though she wants Sean, Mary 
refuses to go against her brother to marry him. Marrying Sean under 
these circumstances would be an insult to her. Later, when Will witholds 
her dowry—which represents her independent worth—Mary refuses to 
sleep with Sean before it is paid. The concluding boxing match settles 
both questions, however, and the couple is thereby reconciled.
Under Ford's astute direction, The Quiet Man plays off the 
conventional quaintness of the village against the beautiful natural 
scenery, resulting in a film that is serious enough to be affecting, but 
enough of a fantasy to be uproariously funny.  BP

A good many films have heightened the absurdities and cruelties of 
human life by depicting them through the eyes of children, but few have 
done so more effectively, or more poignantly, than René Clément's finest 
film, Forbidden Games. The setting, as with much of Clément's best work, 
is World War II: A five-year-old girl, Paulette (Brigitte Fossey), is orphaned 
when her parents, fleeing Paris, are killed in an aerial attack. Grudgingly 
taken in by a peasant family, she forms a bond with the younger son, 
eleven-year-old Michel (Georges Poujouly), and the two create a secret 
world that reflects the death they see all around them. Collecting the 
corpses of animals and insects, they perform solemn rites over them 
and bury them in a disused barn, muttering half-understood phrases 
from the Catholic burial service. These, the "forbidden games" of the title, 
outrage the adults who discover them, and the children—distressed 
and bewildered—are torn apart.
Clément made his name with a dramatized documentary, The Battle 
of the Rails (1946), about the operations of the Resistance on the French 
rail network. Accordingly, the opening of Forbidden Games carries 
a powerfully realistic charge as German fighter planes bomb and 
machine-gun a straggling column of refugees. The sequence of the 
attack is all the more horrifying for relying entirely on natural sound 
effects, with no added music, and for taking place amid the soft summer 
warmth of the French countryside. But after this the film grows more 
stylized. On the one hand is the adult world of the peasants, seen 
through the puzzled, fascinated eyes of the children—the petty feuds 
and bickering are caricatured, with lip service paid to religion while lives 
are ruled by greed and malice. By contrast, the children are observed 
with tenderness and sympathy as they construct their hidden fantasy 
world, and their final, enforced separation is heartrending.
From his lead child actors, Clément draws remarkably expressive 
and convincing performances, free from cuteness; there's an instinctive 
grace in the boy's gentleness toward his young friend. Narciso Yepes 
contributes a lyrical solo guitar score, expressive in its simplicity.  PK

Europa '51 contains the most unpredictable mixture of ingredients one 
can think of: a Scandinavian actress-turned-Hollywood movie star; the 
father of Italian Neorealism; a statement on the social conditions of cities 
in postwar Europe; a metaphysical meditation about the nature of good 
and evil and the inalienable right to self-determination; the opposition 
of the bourgeoisie and popular classes; the death of a child; the betrayal 
and redemption of a mother... mamma mia! But then the movie begins. 
It's simple, elegant, deeply moving, and incredibly alive.
In Stromboli (1950), Rossellini had turned Ingrid Bergman into a 
puppet submitting to the hand of God and the hand of her director (and 
lover). No such thing this time; only the daring invention—by the same 
filmmaker and star—of a fusion of the melodrama and the auteur film.
Each situation in Europa '51 is composed of conventional stuff, and 
every scene is unexpected, filled with a disturbing sense of reality, of 
secret connections with real life. And it all takes places without any overly 
dramatic effect, without any kind of boasting—but, on the contrary, with 
an incredible modesty (by a director and an actress who were anything 
but humble) in the way the story is told, shot, and acted.
Europa '51 reaches a level of essential humanism rarely achieved in 
the cinema—and never by using heavy means. As Bergman's character, 
Irene Girard, walks through all the obstacles on her way to being called 
a saint by the people, the film itself walks its way through, escaping from 
all the sins it seems to have had to endure. A "saintly" film? Why not?  J-MF

Singin' in the Rain  Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952
Some films are held in high esteem for their artistic breakthroughs or 
stunning acting debuts. Others are revered simply for being the best of 
a kind. Singin' in the Rain falls into this latter category. It isn't a pioneer in 
any real sense of the word, nor does it greatly advance the language of 
film, but few other pictures have so effortlessly and wonderfully 
encapsulated everything good about the movies: the joyous highs, the 
pitiful lows, and the perfect, perpetual seesaw between the two.
It is wholly appropriate that the greatest of all Hollywood musicals 
should be in essence about sound itself. Or at least the arrival of sound. 
The year is 1927, and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a celebrated silent 
film star. In the middle of shooting another swashbuckler with his 
on-screen partner, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan), the studio learns of the 
imminent debut of The Jazz Singer and shuts the production down. The 
only way for the film to compete is to transform it into a musical, but 
there are two problems: Don can barely stand his leading lady, Lina, and 
her thick New York accent will never work in the new era of sound films. 
The solution? Dub Lamont's horrible singing voice with that of ingénue 
Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) and hope that the public never finds out. But 
that stop-gap measure leads to yet another problem: Don has fallen in 
love with Kathy, which throws off his working relationship with Lina.
Codirected by Kelly and Stanley Donen (who had helmed 1949's On 
the Town), Singin' in the Rain features several great song-and-dance 
numbers, particularly Donald O'Connor's "Make 'Em Laugh" routine and 
Kelly's famous solo turn during the title song. Kelly, wearing a dark 
suit and a fedora, swings from a light pole and stomps ecstatically in 
puddles, so enamored is he of the new love in his life. The name of 
that classic song, remarked Donen, "seems like a wonderful title for the 
movie. But, at the time, the only reason to call it Singin' in the Rain was 
because the number turned out so well." 
Oddly enough, several of the songs from Singin' in the Rain were 
actually recycled from MGM's music vaults, but Kelly and crew breathe 
such new life into them that they are now inextricably linked to this 
film. The screenplay, by Adolph Green and Betty Comden, is fleet and 
funny, parodying the rocky transition from silent films to talkies with 
the rapid wit only a generation of writing for the latter could foster.
Singin' in the Rain was nominated for two Oscars and a BAFTA award, 
while Kelly and Donen were nominated for Outstanding Directorial 
Achievement by the Directors Guild of America, and O'Connor secured 
a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor. But its enduring appeal is 
based not on trophies, but on joyful sequences and charismatic stars. 
Thank the repertoire circuit in part for crowning Singin' in the Rain as 
king of all musicals, thank numerous film critics and groups for placing 
it on the top ten list, but most of all thank Donen and Kelly for making 
it. The world of movies is a better place with Singin' in the Rain in it.  JKl

Still the best Hollywood-on-Hollywood movie, The Bad and the Beautiful 
is loosely based on the career of David O. Selznick, detouring to take in 
a few insider anecdotes about Val Lewton, Orson Welles, Raymond 
Chandler, Diana Barrymore, Alfred Hitchcock, and Irving Thalberg. Also 
note the silent but influential wife of the British director (played by 
Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll).
Three people with good cause to hate producer Jonathan Shields 
(Kirk Douglas) are gathered to take a phone call from Paris in which the 
washed-up Shields will pitch a new project. In flashbacks, they cover his 
up-from-Poverty Row career, remembering why they loathe him so 
much. Director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) is an early partner who 
is inspired by Shields to make something of a cheap monster picture 
called The Doom of the Cat Man (think Cat People), but then shut out of 
his dream project, a hilariously "significant" Mexican project called The 
Faraway Mountain. Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), drunken trampy 
daughter of a John Barrymore-style hellraising star, is hauled out of the 
gutter and turned into a movie goddess, then dumped for an available 
slut (the wonderfully wry Elaine Stewart) on the night of the premiere. 
Least likely to forgive is professorial screenwriter James Lee Bartlow 
(Dick Powell), whose flighty, flirty distraction of a wife (Academy 
Award winner Gloria Grahame) Shields passes on to "Latin lover" Victor 
"Gaucho" Ribera (Gilbert Roland), who gets her killed in a plane crash.
No one can match Douglas as an ambitious megalomaniac, and 
this teeth-clenched, dimple-thrusting portrait is among his best work. 
The gossipy screenplay (another Oscar winner for Charles Schnee) is 
served wonderfully by director Vincente Minnelli's lush melodramatics 
and David Raksin's seductive score. In sixty years, the film has taken on 
more tragic-comic resonance as Selznick's reputation has nosedived—
Shields's conviction that he is making great art worth sacrificing other 
people's lives for is all the more unsettling in that Minnelli allows 
glimpses of exactly the sort of bloated, self-important spectacle that 
now plays less well than more modest efforts.  KN

1952

Although best known for his samurai epics (The Seven Samurai, Yojimbo), 
Akira Kurosawa was not principally concerned with blood and guts—
though arguably no other director has so thoroughly explored the 
potential of violent imagery on screen. Kurosawa was cinema's greatest 
humanist, and nowhere is this more evident than in Ikiru.
The film centers on Kenji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a bureaucrat 
whose greatest achievement—one he takes quite seriously—is that he 
hasn't missed a day of work in thirty years. This all changes when he 
learns he has cancer and has only a short time to live. In the last months 
of his life, Watanabe reconsiders his achievements (none) and priorities 
(none), and decides that it is not too late for him to change the world for 
the better. He devotes all his energies to the construction of a public 
park—a small gesture that nevertheless takes on great significance. 
Shimura gives the performance of his life: Moving with the look of a truly 
harrowed man, it is impossible not to feel Watanabe's pain.
Though full of sadness, Ikiru is ultimately spiritually uplifting. This was 
Kurosawa's point—to achieve anything like satisfaction or happiness, 
one must suffer. But suffering, too, is a part of life, and it can be used 
for good. Ikiru is immensely life-affirming, even if it is about death 
and sorrow. Kurosawa's gift was to show how these moods are not 
contradictory, but united as part of the cycle of life. His sincere belief that 
small things make a difference is both refreshing and touching.  EdeS

This heart-wrenching film of a retired bureaucrat (Carlo Battisti) and his 
dog, Flike, will stay with you forever. Having made the Neorealist classic 
The Bicycle Thief (1948), director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare 
Zavattini return to similar subject matter and method in Umberto D. Their 
technique is to structure the film around an emotionally charged and 
compelling personal story that reveals, in its telling, the general social 
conditions in which the story is set.
Umberto D. is shot on the streets of Rome, and the major parts are 
played by nonprofessional actors, adding to the film's immediacy and 
authenticity. One major criticism of Neorealism is that the melodramatic 
treatment of the small story dilutes the larger social message and claim 
to realism made by the film in question. With its unapologetic tragic story 
of an old man's despair and love for his pet, and its pointed observations 
of social injustice, Umberto D. provides the perfect opportunity for the 
viewer to consider this question.
Battisti, a retired professor, plays the title character with an 
understated sense of both dignity and resignation concerning his 
situation. Living on an insufficient pension, Umberto can barely afford 
his rented room, where he is at the mercy of his callous landlady, who 
wants to get rid of him. He shares the food he gets at a local charity with 
his dog, Flike, who is his sole companion and source of solace. As things 
get worse and worse for Umberto, he is on several occasions forced to 
choose between his own life and that of Flike. In one of the film's central 
sequences, Flike gets lost and Umberto fears that he will be destroyed 
at the city pound. As in The Bicycle Thief, the suspense built up around 
the ever-more-desperate search rivals a Hitchcock thriller. A pet who 
gives joy to a joyless existence is shown to be capable of generating the 
same interest and excitement as a set of blueprints for a secret weapon 
or a cache of stolen jewels in a more fantastic scenario. Here, De Sica 
leaves us wondering whether Umberto's love for his dog, who depends 
on him alone, is redemptory or futile.  RH

High Noon  Fred Zinnemann, 1952
269
One Sunday morning in the tamed western town of Hadleyville, New 
Mexico, as Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is about to marry a peace-
loving Quaker (Grace Kelly), news arrives that Frank Miller (Ian 
MacDonald)—the psycho Kane previously put away—has been 
pardoned and is due in on the 12 p.m. train. As Miller's most vicious 
accomplices (including a harmonica-sucking Lee Van Cleef) loiter at the 
station, the Marshal appeals for help. But the townspeople (colleagues, 
friends, dignitaries) refuse to risk their lives and stand by him against 
the outlaw who wants not only revenge but to run Hadleyville again.
Various clocks reveal that it's getting near noontime; everyone urges 
Kane to leave town, but the Cooper-style hero must face his 
responsibilities. High Noon plays out in real time, the deadline ticking 
closer and closer as the ballad theme song ("Do Not Forsake Me Oh My 
Darling") insists on the situation, with those the Marshal assumes will 
help him falling like ninepins. In a finale that remains potent even in 
these days of one-man-against-an-army action movies, he is left almost 
alone against four villains. Fred Zinnemann's film is at once a great 
suspense Western and a stark allegory of the climate of fear and 
suspicion prevailing during the McCarthy era.  KN

Le carrosse d'or  Jean Renoir, 1953
The Golden Coach
The first in Jean Renoir's loose "theater" trilogy (with French Cancan 
[1955] and Elena and Her Men [1956]), this Italian-French co-production 
features an Anglo-Italian cast led by the indefatigable Anna Magnani. In 
the English-language version, she laments the difficulty of acting in a 
foreign language in her inimitably thick Italian accent. She plays Camilla, 
Columbine in a commedia dell'arte troupe that arrives in eighteenth-
century Peru. Instead of streets paved with gold, they find no pavement 
at all—they even have to build the theater they're due to play at. 
"What do they make of the new world?" 
"It'll be nice when they finish it."
Despite Camilla's first impressions, she is soon being courted by three 
eligible suitors, one of them the Spanish viceroy (Duncan Lamont), who 
presents her with the golden coach of the title. Alas, for an actor, 
sincerity in life is no guarantee of a happy ending. The movie's surface 
frivolity and farcical plotting camouflage a mature, even melancholy film 
about the fraught relations between love, art, and life. François Truffaut 
called it "the noblest and most refined film ever made . . . It is all breeding 
and politeness, grace, and freshness . . . a film about theater in the 
theater." Antonio Vivaldi provides the soundtrack and Renoir's brother 
Claude the exquisite color cinematography.  TCh

Pickup on South Street  Samuel Fuller, 1953
A minor phenomenon of the early Cold War, the anticommunist spy film 
genre produced one masterpiece, Pickup on South Street. The plot 
revolves around a pickpocket who must choose between patriotism and 
profit after he swipes a top secret microfilm. Pickup transcends its 
subgenre through its dynamic style and vivid depiction of New York 
lowlife. Samuel Fuller displays a prodigious range of stylistic invention, 
finding fresh visual concepts for nearly every scene. The key ingredient 
is the close-up, with the camera shoved in the actors' faces so 
aggressively you can almost see their breath fogging the lens. These 
copious close-ups signal the film's placement of the intimate over the 
ideological, its endorsement of actions motivated not by abstractions 
but by love, loyalty, and guilt on the closest personal level.
The main actors never did better work: cocky cynic Richard Widmark, 
bighearted bimbo Jean Peters, sweaty rat Richard Kiley, and, especially, 
unapologetic stoolie Thelma Ritter. The most powerful scene depicts a 
weary Ritter facing obliteration by gunman Kiley. In a film so devoted to 
the personal, it is fitting that her greatest fear is not death itself but an 
unmarked grave. As she says in one of the script's many punchy lines, "If 
I was to be buried in Potter's Field, it would just about kill me!"  MR

Sommaren med Monika  Ingmar Bergman, 1953
Summer with Monika
Nowhere in all of Ingmar Bergman's films is sensual joy more 
overwhelming than in the long, island-set section at the heart of Summer 
with Monika—not just in the eroticism between lovers Monika (Harriet 
Andersson) and Harry (Lars Ekborg), but in the natural world of Ornö, the 
island in the Stockholm archipelago where they play out their newfound 
infatuation. Much of this passion derives from real life—Bergman had 
just discovered the twenty-year-old Andersson, and almost as soon as 
shooting started the pair embarked on an affair. The film is virtually a 
love poem to Andersson; she was to become one of Bergman's favorite 
actresses, appearing in eight of his films.
The joyous light of this summer idyll (vividly conveyed by Gunnar 
Fischer's lyrical photography) is all the more poignant for the urban 
gloom of the scenes that precede and follow it. Reverting to the poetic, 
realism-influenced style of his early work, Bergman shows us the squalid 
life Monika's escaping from: the cramped apartment, the brutal father, 
the mother hollowed out with child rearing. But when she and Harry 
return to Stockholm and set up home together, with her pregnant, the 
drabness settles in again. The ending is ambiguous: Is Monika slipping 
into a world of prostitution, or asserting her independence? Her defiant 
gaze, straight into the camera, could be read either way.  PK

Like Singin' in the Rain, Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon is a musical 
that affectionately reflects upon the history of its genre—in order to 
pioneer a new, "integrated" style based on character and plot while also 
enjoying the benefits of the old, "revue" style. It cleverly does so by 
making Fred Astaire a dinosaur in a modern, showbiz milieu and giving 
him a trial wherein he must grapple with the overbearing vision of an 
Orson Welles-like director (Jack Buchanan) and ultimately affirm his 
worth as an old-fashioned but adaptable "hoofer" in a dynamic hit show.
Like most musicals, The Band Wagon is about compromise. The 
characters symbolize the extremes of lowbrow and highbrow culture: 
Tony Hunter (Astaire) versus his reluctant leading lady, Gabrielle Gerard 
(Cyd Charisse) from ballet. But when push comes to shove, such cultural 
divisions break down easily: Tony turns out to be a fine art connoisseur, 
and Gaby will belt out "I See a New Sun" on stage like a song-and-dance 
trouper. This aesthetic melding is also a literal romance, clinched by the 
immortal pas de deux in Central Park, "Dancing in the Dark."
Mainly, however, The Band Wagon is a delightfully colorful "montage 
of attractions"—starting with the high-energy comedic contributions of 
Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant, alter egos for the writers Betty 
Comden and Adolph Green. Minnelli gets to show off many kinds of 
mise-en-scène: playing on décor and architecture in the scene where 
Buchanan pitches his "Faust" while characters in three adjoining rooms 
eavesdrop; fluidly moving a group of performers through switches in 
mood in the indelible "That's Entertainment"; enjoying the purely 
theatrical novelty of the kooky number "Triplets."
But the ultimate spectacle is the eleven-minute "Girl Hunt: A Murder 
Mystery in Jazz," a film noir parody (in vibrant color), in which Michael 
Kidd's choreography explodes in stylized arabesques of familiar gestures 
(shooting, smoking, fighting) and the stars turn on their glamour, whether 
in erotic display (Charisse) or the simple joy of walking (Astaire).  AM

This enduring classic of French cinema revealed Jacques Tati, in only his 
second feature as a director, to be one of the medium's most inventive 
and original stylists. A virtually plotless and wordless succession of 
incidents occurring at a beachside resort, the film milks laughter from 
the most seemingly banal minutiae of everyday life. Alongside the 
elaborately staged events—such as a pack of travelers racing from one 
train platform to the next as incomprehensibly distorted loudspeaker 
messages blare—there are many droll, lovely moments where nothing 
much is happening at all. People just sit, eat, read, and stare, determined 
to be in vacation mode at all times. The stoic silliness of it all is infectious.
Tati understood as finely as Alfred Hitchcock that mise-en-scène is 
not something to be imposed by filmmakers but discovered within the 
rituals of everyday life: how close people sit to each other in a dining 
room; the codes governing when people are allowed to look at one 
another; all the rules of etiquette and public deportment in play during 
the free-but-structured time of the French vacation period.
The film rigorously controls the comic timing, spatial setups, and 
post-synchronized sounds of its brilliantly conceived gags—even the 
oft-repeated noise of a spring door is funny, due to the way Tati 
"musicalizes" it. He takes familiar gag forms—like the Keatonesque 
manner in which the hero imitates an exercise freak—and then makes 
them strange through the way he shoots and cuts the action, often 
quickly switching attention to another gag beginning nearby.
Although in his later films Tati deliberately restricted his own on-screen 
appearances, here his eponymous Hulot is a major source of charm and 
hilarity—and there is even the poignant trace of a tentative but missed 
love intrigue. Forever hesitating before entering any space, forever 
apologizing and politely greeting everyone present once he does, Hulot 
cannot fail to trigger some calamity with his overanxious movements—
resulting in the cinema's most inspired display of fireworks.  AM

Few films establish so much, with such economy, as the sublime 
Madame de . . .. Louise (Danielle Darrieux) is "Madame de . . ." because she 
is anonymous, typical of her privileged class; it is only the earrings we 
see in the opening frames—about to be pawned—that launch her into 
a drama. From the first image of Louise in a mirror, amid her material 
possessions, director Max Ophüls does not let us overlook the 
underpinnings of this wealthy world: the flows of money and debt, the 
servants on call, the etiquette of preparation before public appearances. 
At the opera, where all is show, we meet Louise's husband, André 
(Charles Boyer), "debonair" as long as he can control the affairs that 
define this "sophisticated" marriage. By the third time the earrings come 
back into André's hands—and Louise has fallen dangerously in love with 
Donati (Vittorio De Sica)—what could have easily been a cute conceit 
comes to articulate all the fine distinctions of plot and theme. For Louise, 
who lives in denial about the conditions that enable her supposed 
freedom, the earrings are a token of her love with Donati; for André, they 
are a sign of the power he wields over other people's destinies.
Madame de . . . is by turns brutal, compassionate, and moving. Ophüls 
delineates this world with Brechtian precision, yet he never discounts 
the significance of stifled, individual yearnings. Even as the characters 
writhe in their metaphoric prisons or shut traps on each other, their 
passions touch us: supremely, when André closes the windows on Louise 
like a jailer as he declares, half whispering in secret, "I love you."  AM

A withering depiction of greed and the corrupting influence of 
capitalism disguised as an adventure film, Henri-Georges Clouzot's 
Wages of Fear is possibly the most tension-filled movie ever made. Set 
in South America, two teams compete to transport a truckload of 
nitroglycerin along a three-hundred mile mountain pass to the site of 
an oil refinery fire so that the oil company can then blow the pipeline 
and put out the blaze. The catch? Notoriously unstable and sensitive, the 
nitro cargo will blow the drivers to bits if they're not exceedingly careful.
With sadistic invention, Clouzot throws as many obstacles as he can 
in the way of the two trucks as they race (at a snail's pace) through the 
bumpy mountain pass. It isn't the promise of glory that sets each pair of 
drivers on such a dangerous task, but the promise of cash, and as the 
film proceeds you begin to wonder how far they will go for the money.
Vitally, Clouzot precedes the action with a long segment set in a slum 
of a South American crossroads, where wanderers and vagabonds end 
up after they have nowhere else to go, and where we learn that the 
rogues willing to risk their lives for money are almost not worth knowing. 
Their suicidal actions are driven by selfishness and desperation, traits 
exploited by the opportunistic corporation. Indeed, full of distrust and 
dislike, the mercenaries pose as much of a threat to one another as the 
truckloads of explosives do to them all. It's a lose-lose situation, as the 
finish line promises financial reward at the cost of spiritual ruin.  JKl

This haunting film is one of several out-of-nowhere masterpieces 
directed during a too-brief period by Ida Lupino, considered "the poor 
man's Bette Davis" when she was a hard-boiled Warner Brothers star in 
the 1940s. Edmond O'Brien stars as Harry Graham, a refrigerator 
salesman who, from shambling clumsily through life, ends up with two 
wives, Eve (Joan Fontaine) and Phyllis (Lupino), each unaware of the 
other's existence. Lupino's understated direction enfolds the characters 
with discreet, helpless pity.
Such drama as there is in The Bigamist is born from the sadness of 
three people: Harry's loneliness, Eve's sorrow over her father's death 
and her inability to conceive a child, and Phyllis's reluctance to have 
Harry acknowledge her because she doesn't want to be a burden to 
him. The whole film is the crystallization of this collective sadness in 
terms of environment (San Francisco and Los Angeles as the settings of 
Harry's dual life), deportment (Harry's numbed, pained passivity; 
Phyllis's hard-bitten isolation; Eve's desperate and pathetic attempt to 
be both the perfect wife and the perfect business partner), and, above 
all, the looks shared or half-avoided between people. In the shattering 
final courtroom scene, the orchestration of these looks achieves a 
combination of ambiguity and intensity that recalls both Carl Dreyer 
and Nicholas Ray.  CFu

The third of the remarkable series of Westerns director Anthony Mann 
made with James Stewart in the 1950s, The Naked Spur has Stewart as 
Howard Kemp, an embittered bounty hunter trying to earn money to 
buy back the ranch he lost when his wife was unfaithful to him during 
the Civil War. Along the trail he falls in with Jesse (Millard Mitchell), an 
elderly prospector, and Anderson (Ralph Meeker), a renegade army 
officer. Eventually, Stewart gets his man, a sardonic killer named Ben 
(Robert Ryan), but Kemp's troubles are just beginning. The arduous 
journey through the wilderness to bring Ben to justice tests Kemp to 
the limits.
What makes this an exceptional film is, first, the tautly scripted and 
finely acted exploration of the tensions between the characters: Kemp 
and Ben each strive to gain psychological supremacy, with Ben using 
his girlfriend Lina (Janet Leigh) as bait as he senses Kemp's vulnerability 
beneath the tough exterior. James Stewart gives a brilliant portrayal of 
a man on the edge of hysteria. Second, Mann has a wonderful way with 
mountain scenery, using the arduous nature of the terrain as a physical 
counterpoint to the characters' inner turmoil. Virtually the entire film 
was shot on location.  EB

"Isn't life disappointing?" asks a teenage girl of her widowed sister-in-law 
at her mother's funeral. "Yes," comes the answer—with a smile. This brief 
exchange, near the close of Yasujiro Ozu's masterpiece Tokyo Story, 
typifies the unsentimental mood of calm acceptance that distinguishes 
his work. The performances, setting (the middle-class home the girl has 
shared with, until now, both of her elderly parents), and dialogue are 
wholly naturalistic in tone, and never for a moment seem as if they've 
been arranged as part of some grand climax; yet by the time the words 
are uttered, they carry enormous emotional and philosophical weight. 
Ozu's films were marvelously understated, deceptively simple affairs, 
mostly depicting the everyday domestic and professional rituals of 
middle-class Japanese life with an idiosyncratic lack of emphasis 
(dramatic or stylistic) that might mislead the inattentive into believing 
them banal. Here, all that happens is that the old folks leave their 
youngest daughter at home in the provinces to visit their other children 
in Tokyo; they've never been to the capital, but make the effort in the 
knowledge that time is running short. But the kids have their own 
families now and shunt their parents around, barely disguising their need 
to get on with their busy lives in postwar Japan. Only their daughter-in-
law, who lost her husband in the war, seems to have enough time for 
them. Not that they'd complain, any more than she would.
All this is observed, as was Ozu's custom, with a static camera placed 
a couple of feet off the ground; there is only one shot in the film that 
moves—and even then it tracks with inconspicuous slowness. So how 
does Ozu hold our attention, when what we see or hear is so uninflected 
by what most viewers consider dramatic or unusual? It all comes down 
to the contemplative quality of his gaze, implying that any human 
activity, however "unimportant," is worthy of our attention. In contrast 
to his own particular (and particularly illuminating) cinematic style, his 
characters' experiences, emotions, and thoughts are as "universal" as 
anything in the movies—a paradox that has rightly enshrined this film's 
reputation as one of the greatest ever made.  GA

Notwithstanding the famously iconic scene of Burt Lancaster and Deborah 
Kerr rolling and smooching in the Hawaiian surf, Fred Zinnemann's 
version of James Jones's best seller about life on a U.S. Army base in 1941 
immediately prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is a somewhat 
modified affair. Although the language, the sex, and the violence may 
have been toned down, the focus on adultery, prostitution, corruption, 
and sadistic bullying ensured that From Here to Eternity was welcomed 
as an unusually adult Hollywood movie worthy of eight Oscars. With the 
passing of time, the film's sensationalist elements have come to feel less 
daring, and it's the vivid performances of its starry cast that now stick in 
the memory. Lancaster is the principled but pragmatic Sergeant Warden. 
Montgomery Clift is Prewitt, the bugler new to the barracks (whose 
conscientious refusal to box for his platoon's team provokes prejudicial 
treatment by the officers), and Frank Sinatra is his friend Maggio, picked 
on by obnoxious stockade sergeant Fatso (a memorable Ernest Borgnine). 
Inevitably, perhaps, in this deeply "masculine" study of rugged courage 
and individual honor in conflict with the conformist expectations of the 
community at large, the actresses fare less well. English rose Kerr is just 
slightly self-conscious as a sultry American adulteress, and Donna Reed 
plays a dancehall whore passed off as a hostess.
Zinnemann probably wasn't quite right to direct such fare. A rather 
meticulous craftsman who progressed from modest but reasonably 
efficient fillers to rather self-consciously "significant" films, he was here 
at what would prove a turning point in his career. The Oscars meant he 
could go on to more conspicuous "quality" films, but this movie might 
have benefited from a less cautiously "realistic" touch. After all, it's really 
a melodrama, and a touch of lurid expressionism would not have gone 
amiss. That said, the film is good on the dynamics of bullying, on officers 
conveniently turning a blind eye to misdemeanors, and on the prejudices 
that infect any closed group. Plus, he did get those sturdy performances 
out of his actors. And after that roll in the surf, barracks life would never 
seem the same again.  GA

In the mid-1950s, when the international circuit of film festivals got 
underway, the cineastes of the West finally discovered what their Japanese 
counterparts had known for years: This Kenji Mizoguchi fellow was really 
something special. Ugetsu monogatari (literally, The Story of Ugetsu; 
commonly known simply as Ugetsu) was the film on which the international 
gaze focused. Though it is not necessarily Mizoguchi's best (that honor 
could just as easily go to the profoundly moving 1939 film The Story of the 
Late Chrysanthemums), it is the one for which he is still best known in Europe 
and America, and surely one of the great masterpieces of world cinema.
Mizoguchi had been writing and directing films since the 1920s, but 
we have no one, really, to blame for the fact that his work went largely 
unseen in the West, because Japan's was an insular film market. But when 
Ugetsu did hit Western shores, it hit hard; critics from Europe and the 
United States alike praised it vigorously, heralding it as the bellwether 
of an entirely new way of filmmaking. They may have been correct. But 
what is it that makes Ugetsu so remarkable?
Key to the film is the mixing of the real and the supernatural, a theme 
that infiltrates Mizoguchi's framing and his actors' performances at every 
turn. The master pulls us from one realm of existence into the other—
sometimes with warning, sometimes without. Mizoguchi's control over 
his film's tone is precise; the aura of unearthliness and unholiness never 
quite dissipates.
But this is no ordinary ghost story. Ugetsu uses the real/supernatural 
split to explore issues of love, honor, responsibility, and family; each one 
of these themes is touched in some way by the ghost world Mizoguchi 
carefully maps atop the familiar world, and not one of them emerges 
unchanged. The foolish men and the long-suffering women of Ugetsu 
all go through wrenching transformations brought about by the 
interaction of the supernatural with the real.
Ugetsu is troubling, perplexing, and beautiful. Mostly, though, it is 
truly humbling: To watch it is to be in the presence of greatness.  EdeS

"One of the greatest 
of all films."
Roger Ebert, critic, 2004

French director Jacques Rivette once wrote that Roberto Rossellini's 
Voyage in Italy "opens a breach [that] all cinema, on pain of death, must 
pass through." This is evident from the first shots, sudden and raw—a 
shaky, forward-driving view down a road into Naples; a glimpse of the 
landscape going by; and finally two stars, Ingrid Bergman and George 
Sanders, shipwrecked far from Hollywood in a plotless, not-quite-
picaresque road-movie cruise in which they express the deepest levels 
of character through terse banalities and simple, mundane gestures.
Nowadays, critics talk about the "comedy of remarriage," a genre in 
which couples put their union to the test and, after many complications, 
reaffirm it. Voyage in Italy is that rarer thing: a drama of remarriage, where 
the spark of revitalization must be found within the undramatic flow of 
daily togetherness. The Joyces, Alex (Sanders) and Katherine (Bergman), 
bored and resentful of each other, are in a state of suspension. Being on 
vacation leaves them disquieted by the foreign culture that surrounds 
them. The food is different, sleep beckons at odd hours, and there are 
encounters with strangers who offer distraction or temptation.
And then there is the landscape, the cities of Naples, Capri, and 
Pompei. Voyage in Italy typifies the radical turn in Rossellini's work of the 
1950s: no longer "social issue" Neorealism, but an inner, emotional 
realism, prefiguring Michelangelo Antonioni and especially the Jean-Luc 
Godard of Contempt (1963). But there is still a sense of documentary 
reality in the views Katherine sees from her car, in the churches, 
catacombs, mud pools, and archaeological excavations. This insistent 
environment adds context, history, and even mythology to the personal, 
marital story. It brings the past to bear upon the present, prompting the 
characters to endlessly recall formative moments. And it places this one 
small crisis into a great cosmic cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
Little is explained in Voyage in Italy, but everything is felt: This is a film 
that can proudly end—just before yet another shot of a passing crowd—
with a sweeping crane shot and the age-old declaration "I love you."  AM

Shane is not the most glorious Western (that honor must go to El Dorado 
[1967]), nor the most masculine (that would be Red River [1948]), most 
authentic (McCabe & Mrs. Miller [1971]), strangest (Johnny Guitar [1954]), 
or most dramatic (Stagecoach [1939]). But it is surely the most iconic, the 
Western that burns itself into our memory, the Western no one who sees 
it will ever forget. Everything in the film, in fact, is a pure image: the hero 
in white buckskin who happens to ride into town (Alan Ladd); the 
conniving rancher (Emile Meyer) with his mangy, ill-mannered cowboys; 
the humble homesteader (Van Heflin) with his doting, dutiful, 
domesticating wife (Jean Arthur) and twinkle-eyed son (Brandon De 
Wilde); the taciturn, cautious, aging bartender and owner of the general 
store (Paul McVey); the timid Swedish settler (Douglas Spencer); and the 
dark, sinuous, slimy personification of Evil Incarnate, Wilson the hired 
gun (Jack Palance, dressed in black from head to toe). Indeed, the 
characters alone are the story.
The rancher wants the homesteader's land. Shane settles in with the 
homesteader to help him protect it, in the process charming the tidy 
wife—perhaps a little too much—and the goggle-eyed boy completely 
out of his childhood. Wilson is imported to clean out the settlers, and, 
but for the intervention of Shane—gun to gun, eye to eye, nobility vs. 
evil—he would surely succeed. But Good triumphs, so very deeply, 
indeed, that Shane comes to see his own effect on this charming little 
family, mounts his obedient steed, and rides away at film's end into a 
sunset that outshines all sunsets. After him runs little Joey, crying out, 
"Shane! I love you, Shane!"
Shot at Jackson Hole, and before the days of widescreen and Dolby 
Stereo, Shane is studded with iconic visions. The purple Grand Tetons in 
the background, a deer grazing in a mirroring pool while the boy takes 
pot shots at it with his toy rifle, the filthy sneer on the rancher's face 
when Starrett (Heflin) refuses to give up his land, the look in Palance's 
eyes when he guns the gunless Frank "Stonewall" Torrey (Elisha Cook Jr.) 
down in the mud. Director George Stevens makes the mud tactile, like 
melted chocolate.
For two images alone this film is worth seeing again and again. They 
testify, if not to history, then to cinema. When Wilson struts onto the 
wooden sidewalk with his spurred boots ringing, the town dog is shown 
up close, creeping away with its tail between its legs. And after Shane

out of the oven by a pretty gal in blue gingham and served up with good 
black coffee. It is apple pie like this that made the American West, we 
may well think; not guns, not cattle, not the dreamy far-sighted gaze 
toward the next horizon.  MP

It is not the most famous number in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, but 
the song "When Love Goes Wrong" captures what is most infectious about 
this garish, hilariously camp musical. Dorothy (Jane Russell) and Lorelei 
(Marilyn Monroe) mope at an outdoor Parisian café about the difficulty 
of sustaining romances with men. As a crowd gathers, the two women 
warm to the increasingly expansive rhythm of their lament, which soon 
has them out of their seats, striding and strutting with bystanders in the 
style of choreographer Jack Cole. And then the commotion winds down: 
The music thins, the crowd disperses, and our heroines are gliding away 
in a cab—from banality to ecstasy and back again, beautifully.
Typical of the 1950s, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is an acerbic comedy 
about gold digging, unafraid to mix sentimental dreams with brittle 
sarcasm, glamorous magic with a materialist sense of what a girl must 
do to get by—a set of merry contradictions immortalized in Monroe's 
oft-imitated "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." 
The film is (as theorists say) a palimpsest, picking up and discarding 
at whim bits of Anita Loos's novel, its Broadway adaptation, songs by the 
teams of Leo Robin-Jule Styne and Hoagy Carmichael-Harold Adamson, 
and, above all, the possibilities accruing to its two powerhouse stars. 
Russell's persona brings together raunchiness and practicality; Monroe 
is a potent mixture of slinky eroticism and childlike guilelessness, laced 
with a hint of savvy manipulation. The comic high point comes when 
the roles swap for Dorothy's brash courtroom imitation of Lorelei.
Howard Hawks is generally regarded as a very classical, restrained 
director, but here he veers toward the crazy, spectacularly vulgar 
comedies of Frank Tashlin—a connection clinched by the presence of 
that wonderfully grotesque child George Winslow. The excess and oddity 
of certain set pieces (such as Russell's deathless serenade addressed to 
indifferent musclemen, "Ain't There Anyone Here for Love?"), and their 
frequently tangential relation to the nominal plot, are all part of what 
makes the film so enjoyable to a contemporary audience.  AM

If the filmmakers knew exactly what they had on their hands at the 
time, they might have retitled Roman Holiday as A Star is Born. Audrey 
Hepburn had only appeared in a few European roles and in a Broadway 
production of Gigi when she was cast as a princess in William Wyler's 
film. Needless to say, the role fit, Roman Holiday was a hit, and Hepburn 
was catapulted to the top of Tinseltown royalty. She was the Cinderella 
story made real by the magic of Hollywood.
Roman Holiday itself actually presents the flip side to the Cinderella 
fable. Hepburn's Princess Ann is tired of the pomp and circumstance of 
her official duties. One night she slips out from under her handlers' 
control and, under the guise of an everyday girl, encounters American 
journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). He recognizes the princess as the 
possible scoop of his career, but as he gets to know her better he feels 
terrible about taking advantage of her innocence. As the two tour the 
city, they realize they're falling in love, but the realities of their 
respective situations may make such a relationship impossible. So they 
enjoy the city and all its charms, knowing that this short time they 
spend together may be the last.
Peck and Hepburn are excellent as the two mismatched lovers, and 
Eddie Albert is perfect as Peck's eager tagalong cameraman. Wyler, one 
of Hollywood's most reliable directors, shot the film on location in 
Rome, and the city's landmarks help enhance the already magical story. 
Just as essential is the enjoyable script, which proved controversial 
because it was penned by blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo. It was 
literally decades before Trumbo finally got the credit he deserved for 
helping to craft such a wonderful film.
The rest of the crew didn't need to wait nearly as long—Roman 
Holiday earned a whopping ten Academy Award nominations, including 
a win for the relatively unknown Hepburn. She'd be cast as the ingenue 
many more times over in her career, but it was this film that officially 
and auspiciously marked her arrival.  JKl

The Big Heat  Fritz Lang, 1953
Like Fritz Lang's 1952 Western Rancho Notorious, The Big Heat is a ballad 
of "hate, murder, and revenge": It opens with a close-up of a gun about 
to be used by corrupt cop Tom Duncan to commit suicide and proceeds 
rapidly through jolting horrors that malform the characters. Cop Dave 
Bannion (Glenn Ford) turns from family man to obsessive when his wife 
(Jocelyn Brando) is blown up by a car bomb meant for him. Moll Debby 
(Gloria Grahame) is embittered when her thug boyfriend Vince (Lee 
Marvin) disfigures her with a faceful of hot coffee and takes up Bannion's 
quest. In a crucial development, the embittered hero still can't commit 
cold-blooded murder, and so a double has to step in to pull the last thread 
that allows justice to be done: The big heat that brings down crime boss 
Lagana (Alexander Scourby) is precipitated when Debby confronts and 
murders her "sister under the mink," the crooked cop's grasping widow.
Grounded more in political reality than most of Lang's noirs, thanks 
to the hard-hitting detail of William P. McGivern's novel and Sydney 
Boehm's script, The Big Heat is one of a 1950s cycle of syndicate-runs-
the-town crime exposés—others include The Phenix City Story (1955) and 
The Captive City (1952). Lang's direction is still indebted to expressionism 
here, with sets that reflect the characters' overriding personality traits: 
the cold luxury of the Duncan house, bought with dirty money; the 
tasteless wealth of Lagana's mansion, with its hideous portrait of the 
mobster's sainted mother and jiving teenage party; the penthouse 
moderne of Vince and Debby, where the police commissioner plays cards 
with killers; the cramped, poor-but-honest apartment of the Bannion 
family; and the hotel room where Bannion ends up, his life pared down 
to the need for vengeance. The finale is hardly comforting: After the fall 
of the crime syndicate, the hero returns to his desk in the Homicide 
Department. The welcome of workmates—expressed, of course, by an 
offer of coffee—is curtailed, and the end title appears over Bannion 
putting on his hat and coat to go out and deal with "a hit and run over 
on South Street."  KN

Time Out Film Guide

On the Waterfront  Elia Kazan, 1954
"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, 
instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it." One of the all-time 
great American films, On the Waterfront exploded on a country shaken 
by the betrayals and paranoia of the anticommunist scare. Searing and 
tender, it ushered into Hollywood a new kind of hard-hitting social 
realism, not least because it was filled with indelible performances from 
a number of New York theater's hot postwar generation of naturalistic 
and Method actors.
Slow-witted but sensitive Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando, never more 
beautiful), a failed boxer turned longshoreman and errand boy for corrupt 
union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), is disturbed by his unwitting 
role in the murder of a disaffected docker. His guilt is exacerbated when 
he falls in love with the dead man's sister, Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint in 
her film debut), but his illuminating crisis is his realization that he, too, 
has been sold out—most heartbreakingly by his older, smarter brother 
Charley (Rod Steiger), who is Friendly's sharp lawyer and right-hand man. 
After Edie shames the initially ineffectual parish priest (Karl Malden) into 
leading the crusade against harbor union racketeering, Friendly's 
intimidation turns more deadly. Terry painfully defies the code of silence 
and testifies at a congressional commission. Despite doing the right 
thing, Terry is ostracized for "ratting" by the waterfront community and 
is beaten to a pulp in the dockyard before his fearful comrades fall in 
behind him, breaking Friendly's hold on their lives and labor.
The film was most visibly inspired by "Crime on the Waterfront," a 
series of newspaper articles by Malcolm Johnson exposing racketeering 
in the New York/New Jersey dockyards. Playwright Arthur Miller began 
working on a screenplay at the behest of director Elia Kazan. But when 
Kazan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, 
Miller broke with him. Kazan turned to a fellow "friendly witness," writer 
Budd Schulberg. Both men's reputations suffered permanent damage 
and On the Waterfront is frequently labeled their apology or defense. 
Kazan admitted he identified with Terry Malloy's conflict of loyalties. 
Wherever one's sympathies lie, the painful real-life background invested 
the film with a gut-wrenching, truthful emotional center for the realism 
of its subject and setting and for the naturalism of its performances 
(complemented by Leonard Bernstein's evocative score).
Terry confronting Charley in the back of a cab is the most often cited 
classic scene, but there are many other unforgettable moments: Brando 
fiddling with Saint's little glove, putting it on his own hand; Terry 
discovering that all his lovingly cared for pigeons have been killed by 
the neighborhood boy who admired him; Terry beating down Edie's door 
and forcing an admission of love as they slide down to the floor in a 
desperate kiss. Decades later, it endures as an unflinching contemplation 
of betrayal.  AE

The Road is Federico Fellini's fourth film, and it is the one that made his 
international reputation. Starring Anthony Quinn as Zampanò the 
Strongman and the director's wife, Giulietta Masina, as the waif Gelsomina, 
it is a story of love and jealousy set in the circus, a milieu to which Fellini 
returns time and again. Zampanò does a hackneyed routine of bursting 
out of chains wrapped around his chest. He needs an assistant, and so he 
buys Gelsomina from her mother to accompany him on the road. She acts 
as a clown, her gestures reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin. When they join a 
traveling circus, Gelsomina is temporarily fascinated by an acrobat, the 
Fool, played by Richard Baseheart. Although he treats her badly, Zampanò 
becomes jealous of the Fool and his actions lead the film to its powerful 
conclusion.
The Road is told in a fabulist style that begins to move away from the 
postwar Neorealism of much of Italian cinema, a movement with which 
Fellini was intimately involved as a screenwriter. Although it is shot on 
location, it could take place in the present day or it could be 100 years 
ago. Zampanò and Gelsomina are archetypes, simple characters driven 
by the most elemental emotions and desires. The action of the film plays 
out as though it is predetermined and these characters must act as they 
do, which makes the story tragic. Masina's moving portrayal of the 
abused but plucky Gelsomina would define her screen persona in several 
later Fellini films, and in much of her other work as an actress. Quinn is 
equally unforgettable as the brutish strongman, incapable of understanding 
his own feelings toward Gelsomina. Both actors highlight the disjuncture 
between their characters' performances and the realities of their lives.
Throughout his work, Fellini was fascinated by the tension between 
a character's theatrical facade and his or her unexplored, messy interior 
life. The Road won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film 
and is probably the director's most accessible and well-loved picture. 
Snobs and sophisticates should not hold that against this complex and 
moving film, which continues to provide new insights and ideas on each 
subsequent viewing.  RH

Les diaboliques  Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1954
The Fiends
287
In a run-down, provincial public school, murderous passions seethe just 
below the surface. The put-upon, weak-hearted wife (Véra Clouzot) 
and mysteriously sensual girlfriend (Simone Signoret) of a sadistic 
headmaster (Paul Meurisse) murder him, dumping the corpse in the 
weeded-over swimming pool. When the pool is drained, the body is 
missing and the women start to lose their minds, especially when a pupil 
claims to have seen a ghost. Soon, the women too are seeing things, and 
something ghastly shows up in the bath. 
A major international hit in 1954, Les Diaboliques has lost little of its 
power to disturb, though dozens of films (like Deathtrap [1982] and 
Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte [1964]) have borrowed its tricky storyline 
and made familiar the most shocking moments. Henri-Georges Clouzot 
directs with a gray cruelty that combines a nastily tangled storyline worthy 
of Hitchcock (the Master is rumored to have made Psycho to reclaim the 
King of Suspense crown he lost briefly to Clouzot) with three strong central 
performances and a marvelously seedy setting. The film has scenes of 
physical horror (one trick with contact lenses is unforgettably creepy), but 
Clouzot also sets the flesh creeping with incidences of ordinary nastiness, 
as when Meurisse forces his wife to eat a disgusting school dinner.  KN
A Star Is Born  George Cukor, 1954
A Star Is Born is George Cukor's musical remake of William Wellman's 1937 
film. It is the very best of four films (Cukor also directed What Price 
Hollywood? [1932], considered the source of A Star Is Born) about a 
marriage doomed by the meteoric rise to stardom of the younger wife 
and the self-destruction of the falling idol/mentor she loves. William 
Wellman's 1937 movie starring Fredric March and Janet Gaynor is still a 
moving drama; the 1976 rock version with Barbra Streisand and Kris 
Kristofferson is memorable only for Streisand's singing. But Cukor's 
musical, in which Judy Garland (in a triumphant comeback) and James 
Mason are both terrific, broke new ground in the musical genre by 
propelling dramatic narrative with songs—signally in Garland's tortured 
"The Man that Got Away" and the show-stopping production number 
"Born in a Trunk." Not to be outdone, Mason's Norman Maine is 
spellbinding in his drunken display at the Academy Awards.
Part Hollywood satire—amusingly in the studio transformation of plain 
Esther Blodgett into glamorous Vicky Lester, acidly in the publicity machine 
entrapping Esther and Norman—the film is a beautiful blend of music, 
wit, and romantic tragedy, done with compelling conviction. In 1983, more 
than twenty minutes of previously cut footage was restored, including 
two numbers written for Garland by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin.  AE

Rear Window  Alfred Hitchcock, 1954
The apotheosis of all his simmering and barely suppressed psychosexual 
fixations, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is also probably (with the 
possible exception of the 1958 film Vertigo) the most successful merger 
of entertainment, intrigue, and psychology of the director's remarkable 
career. A fascinating study of obsession and voyeurism—Rear Window 
combines a perfect cast, a perfect screenplay, and particularly a perfect 
set for a movie—that's even better than the sum of its parts.
For maximum freedom, Hitchcock constructed an intricate replication 
of a crowded and constantly bustling New York City tenement building 
and its equally busy courtyard. Each window offers a glimpse into 
another life and in effect tells another story. In one unit, a composer 
hunches over his piano struggling with his latest work. In another, a 
dancer practices compulsively. One apartment houses a lonely woman, 
unlucky in love, and another an amorous newlywed couple.
L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries (James Stewart) is a successful photojournalist 
sidelined with a broken leg. Stuck in a wheelchair all day, he has nothing 
better to do than spy on his neighbors. Or at least that's what he claims, 
because his fashion model girlfriend (and would-be wife) Lisa (played 
by a surprisingly carnal Grace Kelly in one of her final roles before 
retiring) and his cranky caretaker Stella (Thelma Ritter) perceptively 
observe that he's merely addicted to the thrill of voyeurism.
The notion of anyone able to keep their eyes off a character as 
beautiful and luminous as Lisa is hard to believe, until Jeff begins to 
suspect one of his neighbors (a glowering Raymond Burr) of murdering 
his wife. Soon enough, Jeff has dragged Lisa and Stella into the mystery, 
obsessively studying Burr's character's behavior for signs of his guilt. But 
as Jeff's furtive investigation advances, so do the ongoing stories of all 
of his other neighbors, oblivious to the nefarious plot possibly unfolding 
literally right next door.
Rear Window, the film, is constructed every bit as thoroughly as its 
elaborate set. Watching it is like watching a living, breathing ecosystem, 
with the added thrill of a murder mystery thrown in for good measure. 
Hitchcock relishes the film's particularly postmodern scenario: we, the 
viewers, are entranced by the actions of these characters, who are in turn 
entranced by the actions of still other characters. It's a vicious circle of 
obsession laced with black humor and a dash of sexiness.
Indeed, although the nosey Jeff may discover a murder in his urban 
hamlet, it's the numerous romances transpiring in the other units that 
first draw his attention to the courtyard peep show. It's wholly ironic that 
his obsessions with the love lives of his neighbors prevent him from 
acknowledging the romantic interest of Lisa. In fact, the bachelor in Jeff 
looks to his neighbors as an excuse to ward off her advances. It is only when 
his actions put her in danger that he finally understands that what he has 
in front of him is better than anything he can see out the window.  JKl
"I wonder if it's ethical 
to watch a man with 
binoculars and a long-
focus lens. Do you 
suppose it's ethical even 
if you prove he didn't 
commit a crime?"

Senso was Count Luchino Visconti's third film, and his first in color. Set in 
Venice and Verona in the 1860s, on the verge of Giuseppe Garibaldi's 
expulsion of the Austrians and the creation of the modern Italian state, 
it marked a complete departure from the working-class milieu of the 
director's earlier films, Ossessione (1942) and La Terra Trema (1948). 
Nevertheless, Senso's overt theatricality is not so different from the 
extravagant passions of Ossessione, and it is no less "authentic" for its 
sumptuous aristocratic setting.
Alida Valli is the Countess Livia Sepieri, a Garibaldi supporter who 
intercedes on her cousin's behalf when he suicidally challenges an 
Austrian officer to a duel. Lt. Franz Mahler (Farley Granger) characteristically 
ducks out of the fight. A handsome, unprincipled charmer, Mahler 
seduces the Countess, who will recklessly betray her husband, her honor, 
and even her country for his love.
With screenplay credits for both Tennessee Williams and Paul Bowles—
among six writers in total—Senso is a distinctly high-class melodrama. 
An actress who was past her prime, eyes flashing, teeth bared, Valli seems 
barely able to credit her own actions as she flings caution to the wind 
and stakes everything on a feckless character who makes no bones about 
his own cowardice. (The film was actually retitled The Wanton Countess 
for its belated U.S release.) Farley Granger is even better, especially in the 
big climactic scene where he thoroughly lets rip with his self-loathing. 
Similarly unbalanced, sadomasochistic relationships recur in Visconti's 
later films, especially The Damned (1969) and Death in Venice (1971), but 
neither quite matched the ferocity displayed here.
Senso begins at the opera, and Anton Bruckner's score punctuates every 
dramatic turning point with an operatic thundercrack. "I like opera very 
much, but not when it happens off-stage," the Countess remarks, as she 
tries to dissuade Mahler from taking up her cousin's challenge. Italy's most 
renowned director of operas, Visconti clearly believed otherwise.  TCh

The Barefoot Contessa  Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1954
291
The surface appeal of The Barefoot Contessa is obvious: Ava Gardner at 
her most glamorous as the rags-to-riches star Maria Vargas alongside 
Humphrey Bogart at his most acerbic yet tender as filmmaker Harry 
Dawes; the flood of quotable dialogue ("It's never too late to develop 
character"); and the intriguing allusions to real-life celebrities, including 
Rita Hayward and Howard Hughes. But there is much more going on.
The film owes much to Citizen Kane (1941), especially the mosaic 
structure, which offers various points of view on a character—ultimately 
affirming only that person's inscrutability. From the initial "springboard" 
situation of Maria's funeral, eight flashbacks proceed from four narrators. 
Long before Pulp Fiction (1994), Joseph Mankiewicz contrives a sequence 
that shows Maria's transition from Bravano (Marius Goring) to Vincenzo 
(Rossano Brazzi) from two viewpoints.
Even more intricate is the film's journey through three social worlds—
Hollywood show business, the French leisure set, and Italian aristocracy—
that register as uncanny variations on each other, each one enclosed, 
decadent, and dying. Significantly, this suite of decay echoes the 
presentation of the theater world in Mankiewicz's 1950 classic, All About 
Eve. While his films are sometimes justly criticized as stagey and word-
bound, the richness and coherence of The Barefoot Contessa come from 
its metaphor of theatrical spectacle. Mankiewicz's signature touch is the 
"frieze," where the plot stops and a narrator fills us in on the character 
and background of each "player" at a table.  AM
Silver Lode  Allan Dwan, 1954
In this gripping Western, John Payne stars as Dan Ballard, a respected 
and well-liked rancher in the small town where he has lived for the past 
two years. During the town's Fourth of July celebration, four strangers 
ride into town, led by a belligerent and unpleasant thug (Dan Duryea) 
who claims to be a U.S. Marshal with a warrant for Ballard's arrest for 
murder. Over the course of the action (which is equivalent in span to the 
film's running time), the townspeople turn against Ballard, eventually 
forming a mob to hunt him down as he labors to prove his innocence.
Silver Lode is the Allan Dwan film par excellence: concise, plain, 
inventive, fluid, ironic, unspectacular-but-beautiful. No Western, probably, 
has more shots through windows (Dwan likes to stage scenes in depth 
and to emphasize situations in which characters observe each other), and 
few make such splendid use of the familiar architecture and decor of the 
Hollywood Western town. In a single stunning shot, Dwan's camera tracks 
with Payne as he runs four blocks across town. Thanks to the director's 
visual assurance (and the lighting genius of John Alton), Silver Lode is 
one of the best of the American cinema's many underrated Westerns.  CFu

Shichinin no samurai  Akira Kurosawa, 1954
The Seven Samurai
Akira Kurosawa is the Japanese director best known around the world. 
His thrilling, compellingly humane epic The Seven Samurai is his most 
enduringly popular, most widely seen masterpiece. Its rousing, if less 
profound, gunslinging Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), is 
the most successful of the several Western pictures modeled on Kurosawa's 
work—including the 1964 film The Outrage, a reworking of Rashomon 
(1950), and the landmark spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars (1964), 
lifted wholesale by Sergio Leone from Yojimbo (1961). The entertaining 
cultural crossover is delightful testimony to cinema's universal vocabulary 
and appeal. Kurosawa was inspired by the Westerns of John Ford and 
made a bold departure from the limited traditions of the typical Japanese 
jidai-geki, historical costume pictures with the emphasis on swordfights 
in a medieval Japan depicted as a fantasy land. The Seven Samurai is 
packed with a blur of astounding action, comic incident, misadventure, 
social drama, beautiful character development, and the conflict between 
duty and desire, all treated with immaculate care for realism.
A poor village of farmers, at the mercy of bandits who return every 
year to rape, kill, and steal, take the radical decision to fight back by hiring 
ronin (itinerant, masterless samurai) to save them. Because they are able 
to offer only meager portions of rice in payment, the nervous emissaries 
who set out in search of swords for hire are lucky to encounter Kambei 
(Takashi Shimura), an honorable, compassionate man resigned to doing 
what a man's gotta do, despite knowing he will gain nothing from doing 
it. Very much the hero figure, he recruits five other wanderers willing to 
fight for food or fun, including a good-natured old friend, a dewy-eyed 
young disciple, and a master swordsman of few words. Hot-headed, 
impulsive, clownish young Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) is rejected by the 
seasoned men, but the peasant masquerading as a samurai tags along 
anyway, frantic to prove himself and impress Kambei. The villagers treat 
them with mistrust but gradually bonds form, a love affair blossoms, the 
children are drawn to their heroes, and Kambei organizes a spirited 
resistance that astonishes, enrages, and ultimately overcomes the invaders.
The film is tireless, fast moving, and economical, eliminating unnecessary 
exposition. It evokes mystery and sustains a sense of apprehension—
with quick shots and short cuts making up the peasants' search for 
potential protectors and putting their case to Kambei. There are many 
scenes of overwhelming visual and emotional power—a dying woman 
drags herself from a burning mill and hands her baby to Kikuchiyo, who 
sits down in the stream in shock, sobbing and crying, "This baby, it's me. 
The same thing happened to me," the mill wheel, aflame, turning behind 
him. But the greatest moment of the film is the resolution: the three 
survivors survey their comrades' graves as the forgetful villagers below 
turn all their attention to their joyful rice-planting ritual.  AE

Sanshô dayû  Kenji Mizoguchi, 1954
Sanshô the Bailiff
"Without compassion, a man is no longer human." So states Taira (Masao 
Shimizu), a governor in medieval Japan being sent into exile because of 
his liberal policies, to his young son Zushiô. Together with his mother 
Tamaki (the great Kinuyo Tanaka) and his sister Anju, Zushiô flees from 
his family's estate; betrayed by a priestess, Zushiô and Anju are sent off 
to the enormous slave-labor compound run by the notoriously cruel 
Sanshô (Eitarô Shindô), while their mother is kidnapped into prostitution 
on a distant island. Thus begins one of the great emotional and 
philosophical journeys ever made for the cinema. Possibly the high point 
in an unbroken string of masterpieces made by Kenji Mizoguchi shortly 
before his death, Sanshô the Bailiff features the perfection of a signature 
visual style—made up predominantly by long, complexly staged shots 
paced by gliding camera movements—that Mizoguchi had already 
begun to develop in the 1930s.
After this harrowing opening, the story jumps ahead several years. 
The adult Zushiô (Yoshiaki Hanayagi), strong but emotionally dead, has 
become one of Sanshô's most reliable henchmen; with unblinking 
cruelty, he carries out orders to torture and maim. One day Zushiô is 
ordered to leave an old, ailing woman outside the compound's walls to 
die; Anju (Kyôko Kagawa) follows him ostensibly to help, but then a minor 
accident—the two fall down when trying to break off a tree branch—
conjures up a childhood memory of their time together before being 
enslaved. Suddenly Zushiô realizes how horrible he has become; he and 
Anju decide to run away, but fearing they'll be caught if they stay 
together, Anju sacrifices herself so her brother may escape.
Zushiô does escape and eventually is able to reclaim his family's 
noble standing. He returns, now as an official, to Sanshô's compound; 
dismissing Sanshô, he turns the compound over to its inmates, who burn 
it down in a scene of orgiastic frenzy. Abandoning his official post, Zushiô 
goes off to find his mother. Years before, he and Anju had heard a story 
about an old, lame prostitute on an island who constantly sang a lament 
about her lost children; he goes to the island and, on a lonely stretch of 
beach, is reunited with his mother. He breaks down, asking forgiveness 
for the evil he's done; on the contrary, his mother assures him, his father 
would have been proud that his son lived so faithfully by his teachings.
If at this point you're not a sobbing mass, there's simply a hole in your 
soul. Mizoguchi's worldview is pitch black: violence, betrayal, and wanton 
cruelty are the order of the day. Yet although one can't change this, one 
can protest by simply staying true to an ideal. The battle between good 
and evil is finally a battle within oneself, and in the film's magnificent 
final sequence, as mother and son huddle together sobbing, one feels 
that the love between them is the most powerful force in the universe; 
even if that love can't conquer the world, it can transcend it.  RP

film of breathtaking 
visual beauty."

The New York Times, 1969

Carmen Jones  Otto Preminger, 1954
The legendarily beautiful and troubled African-American actress 
Dorothy Dandridge, like so many sex symbols, was a martyr to her 
beauty in life, while in death she lies buried beneath her own mythology. 
Carmen Jones is the substance behind the hype, a potent explanation of 
her appeal and hold on the imagination so long after her death.
Based on Bizet's opera Carmen, Carmen Jones is the story of a hungry, 
ambitious young woman (Dandridge) whose narcissism and greed lead 
to the destruction of Joe (Harry Belafonte), a good man who loves her 
dearly. Surprisingly, both Dandridge and Belafonte (who were singers in 
their own right) were dubbed by Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson 
respectively. Yet filled with classic songs (the lyrics and book are by the 
legendary Oscar Hammerstein II) and a first-rate supporting cast that 
includes Pearl Bailey and a young Diahann Carroll, the film is packed 
with sensational musical numbers (mostly shot in single takes by 
director Otto Preminger) that are integral to the film. But as impeccable 
as craft, crew, and supporting cast are, this is Dandridge's vehicle all the 
way. Her Carmen is one of the fieriest, most viscerally devastating sex 
goddesses ever caught on film—her cool feline strut, curvaceous body, 
blazing eyes, and mixture of lust and contempt for the men caught in 
her snare add up to a creature that's otherworldly. It's a powerhouse 
performance that elevates an excellent film into the realm of classic.  EH

Johnny Guitar  Nicholas Ray, 1954
The melodrama of Johnny Guitar is so over-the-top that some will find it 
laughable. Others will fall under the spell of its hypnotic power. Joan 
Crawford plays Vienna, the owner of a saloon that stands on land valued 
by the railroad. Mercedes McCambridge is Emma Small, the black-clad 
spinster daughter of a big landowner who lusts after the Dancing Kid 
(Scott Brady), who in turn wants Vienna, who has another man in her 
past: Johnny Guitar, played by Sterling Hayden. Driven crazy by frustrated 
desire, Emma leads a lynch mob to burn down Vienna's saloon and hang 
the Kid. But Vienna stands firm. At the end there's a shoot-out between 
Emma and Vienna, the kind of reversal of convention that has led some 
critics to claim the film for feminism. It's also been read as an anti-
McCarthy allegory, against mob hysteria and for those who make a 
stand on principle.
Whatever its ultimate meaning, the film, financed by the minor studio 
Republic, is boldly baroque in its use of strong colors, its bravura acting 
style (with Crawford in particular outstanding), and in the haunting 
beauty of its theme song, sung by the great Peggy Lee. If you can't take 
this much artifice, perhaps you'd be safer watching documentaries.  EB

Salt of the Earth  Herbert J. Biberman, 1954
297
This rarely screened classic is the only major American independent feature 
made by communists. A fictional story about the Mexican-American zinc 
miners in New Mexico striking against their Anglo management, 
Salt of the Earth was informed by feminist attitudes that are quite 
uncharacteristic of the period. The film was inspired by the blacklisting 
of director Herbert Biberman, screenwriter Michael Wilson, producer and 
former screenwriter Paul Jarrico, and composer Sol Kaplan. As Jarrico 
later reasoned, because they'd been drummed out of Hollywood for being 
subversives, they'd commit a "crime to fit the punishment" by making a 
subversive film. The results are leftist propaganda of a high order, powerful 
and intelligent even when the film registers in spots as naive or dated.
Basically kept out of American theaters until 1965, Salt of the Earth 
was widely shown and honored in Europe, but it has never received the 
recognition it deserves Stateside. Regrettably, its best-known critical 
discussion in the United States is a Pauline Kael broadside in which the 
film is ridiculed as "propaganda." As accurate as Kael is about some of 
Salt of the Earth's left-wing clichés, she indiscriminately takes some of 
her examples from the original script rather than the film itself, and gives 
no hint as to why it could remain so vital half a century later.  JRos

Lola Montès  Max Ophüls, 1955
The Sins of Lola Montes
German-born, naturalized French, Viennese by lifelong sensibility, Max 
Ophüls was ideally suited to film the life of Lola Montès, one of the 
great cosmopolitan femmes fatales. Montès, dancer and courtesan 
extraordinaire, cut a swathe of scandal through Europe in the mid-
nineteenth century, numbering among her many lovers Franz Liszt and 
the King of Bavaria.
Ophüls's film, his last (and his only one in color), is no conventional 
biopic. Instead, he mounts a lavish baroque extravaganza, part circus, 
part pageant, packed with flashbacks, and sends his famously mobile 
camera scaling around the elaborate decor. In the title role, Martine 
Carol gives a sullen, emotionally glazed performance, and Anton 
Walbrook's pensive king all but steals the movie. But for all her 
limitations, Carol fits Ophüls's conception. As always, his concern is the 
gulf between the ideal of love and its flawed, disenchanted reality. His 
Lola is merely a passive blank onto which men project their fantasies; 
her final destiny, as a circus sideshow attraction selling kisses for a dollar, 
reduces her profession to its most brutal logic. The Sins of Lola Montes, a 
classic film maudit, was butchered by its distributors and long available 
only in a truncated version, but a recent restoration allows us to 
appreciate Ophüls's swan song in its full poignant splendor.  PK

Pather Panchali  Satyajit Ray, 1955
Based on a classic novel by the Bengali writer Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay, 
Pather Panchali, Satyajit Ray's first film, was eventually to form part of a 
trilogy together with Aparajito (1957) and The World of Apu (1959). Ray, 
who was working in a Calcutta advertising agency at the time, had great 
difficulty in raising the money to make his film. Eventually he borrowed 
enough to begin shooting, in the hopes that the footage would persuade 
backers to help him complete it. Though filming initially began in October 
1952, it was not until early in 1955 that Pather Panchali was at last finished.
Apu (Subir Bannerjee) is a little boy growing up in a remote country 
village in Bengal. His parents are poor and can hardly provide food 
enough for Apu and his older sister Durga (Uma Das Gupta), let alone 
the aged woman known as Auntie (Chunibala Devi) who lives with them. 
In an early scene, Durga has stolen some mangoes, which she gives to 
Auntie, but the children's mother, Sarbajaya (Karuna Bannerjee), scolds 
her. Later, Durga is accused by a more wealthy neighbor of stealing a 
necklace. Sarbajaya, shamed by the allegation, throws Durga out of the 
house. We see not only the distress of mother and daughter but Apu's 
response too, as he implicitly sides with his sister.
These minor moments of drama are punctuated by greater tragedies. 
One of the best-known scenes in the film comes when the children 
quarrel and Durga has once more been scolded by her mother. She runs 
away across the fields, with Apu following. We see black smoke rising 
and then a train. Apu and Durga run toward it, excited by this vision of 
something from the wide world beyond their village. On the way back, 
chattering together, their quarrel made up, they encounter Auntie sitting 
in a bamboo grove. When Durga touches her, she keels over. She is dying.
The father, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), leaves for the city to try and 
make some money. While he is away, Durga catches pneumonia and dies. 
Unaware, the father returns, flushed with success and carrying gifts for 
his family, including a sari for Durga. Sarbajaya breaks down and weeps. 
Harihar collapses in grief. We observe Apu listening to his father's cries.
Eventually Harihar decides to take the remainder of his family back 
to the city. In a telling moment, while helping clear the house Apu finds 
a necklace hidden in a bowl. So Durga did steal it after all; the knowledge 
makes Apu's grief more poignant. Apu throws the necklace into a pond, 
where the weeds close over it.
Ray's mise-en-scène has great delicacy, capable of expressing both 
strong emotion and lyrical delight. Few will forget the sequence in which 
Apu and Durga hear the sound of the traveling sweets seller. Although 
they have no money to buy, they trot along behind him, followed in turn 
by a curious dog; the little procession is reflected in a pool of water.
Helped by Ravi Shankar's marvelous music, Pather Panchali achieved 
worldwide success, and earned Ray recognition at the 1956 Cannes 
Film Festival.  EB

An extraordinary work, and arguably the finest achievement of this great 
filmmaker, Carl Theodor Dreyer's adaptation of Kaj Munk's play is a 
cinematic rarity in that, with the simplest of means and no special effects 
whatsoever, it manages to persuade the viewer that a miracle can happen.
Ordet concerns the Borgens, a farming family, loving and close but 
also beset by tensions arising from a number of disagreements and 
misfortunes—notably the wayward behavior of one of the grown-up 
brothers, seemingly insane due to excessive travails while studying 
religious thought. Not everyone thinks that Johannes (Preben Lerdorff 
Rye) is crazy, however, and when Inger (Birgitte Federspiel), another 
brother's wife, dies, her child asks him to bring her mother back—which, 
at the end of the film, he appears to do. In fact, Dreyer leaves it to the 
spectator to decide whether her revival is a matter of mere scientific 
inability to understand the improbable or of strength of faith, but the 
scene is remarkably powerful, precisely because he refuses both to 
explain and to rev up the film's dramatic engines; the scene convinces 
thanks to its own air of tranquility and that of everything preceding it.
Indeed, this is in many respects the most "realistic" or "naturalistic" of 
films dealing with the power of faith, love, and the supernatural; Dreyer 
eschews any kind of trickery. Although Henning Bendtsen's pared-down 
yet beautiful black-and-white images do endow the Borgens's cottage 
and pastures with a lustrous quality, Dreyer's quiet rhythms, long takes, 
and deceptively simple mise-en-scène may suggest that the movie is a 
straightforward chamber drama about ordinary farming folk. Only 
Johannes's wheedling voice appears at all unusual, and he, after all, is 
not quite right in the head. Wherein lies Ordet's greatness: by the time 
the "miracle" occurs, the film has earned our respect for its integrity—we 
understand the people on-screen because their actions, emotions, 
thoughts, and doubts are like our own. And when Inger opens her eyes 
once more, we probably feel much as they do: astonishment, happiness, 
and genuine wonder. For even if Ordet fails to convert us to religious 
belief, we have, at least, witnessed cinematic art of the highest order.  GA

Marty  Delbert Mann, 1955
301
During the golden age of American television, Paddy Chayefsky wrote 
the teleplay Marty. It was notable for its focus on the ordinary life of an 
unmarried butcher. Chayefsky then translated the script for the big 
screen with Ernest Borgnine as the star. Thereafter, Marty Pilletti became 
a cause célèbre for seizing happiness outside the mold of mid-1950s 
conformity and consensus.
Tagged "It's the love story of an unsung hero!" Marty thrilled 
audiences in its tale of a man who lives at home with his mother, the 
classic Italian matriarch. Trolling singles spots with his best friend Angie 
(Joe Mantell), Marty meets Clara (Betsy Blair) and they begin a ritual 
courtship. Angie quickly becomes jealous, and Mrs. Pilletti (Esther 
Minciotti) confounds matters with nightmares of abandonment, but 
Marty finally pursues Clara because he likes her.
Described thus, Marty suggests a yawn fest. But as a portrait of the 
times, especially of postwar neuroses about domestic tranquility, the 
film is rich with sociological value. Current cultural politics aside, the 
struggle for lonely people to find acceptance and love is without doubt 
a powerful theme. Giving the film buoyancy, this motive also sings the 
praises of the everyday and the beautiful, one and the same.  GC-Q

Artists and Models  Frank Tashlin, 1955
Like Douglas Sirk's melodramas, Frank Tashlin's crazy comedies 
exaggerate to the point of subversion the popular values of the American 
1950s. Tashlin's terrain was the media-sphere of advertising, TV, movies, 
and showbiz: By gleefully embracing and slyly satirizing this "plastic" 
arena of clichés and stereotypes, he anticipated Pop Art.
Artists and Models, which provided the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis duo 
with its finest screen hour, is a dizzily self-reflexive play on movie illusion. 
Eugene Fullstack (Lewis) is a comic book addict whose colorful dreams 
are transcribed—and secretly sold—by Rick Todd (Martin). They are 
mirrored by two women, sultry graphic artist Abby (Dorothy Malone) 
and ditzy Bessie (Shirley MacLaine). Tashlin's endlessly inventive game 
of permutation and combination between these four characters builds 
to a great piece of burlesque mayhem: Eugene and Bessie's delirious 
détournement of the kitsch romantic ballad, "Innamorata."
With a plot that launches without warning into an international 
espionage intrigue (enter Eva Gabor), and a splendid musical 
demonstration of image-and-sound artifice ("When You Pretend"), it is 
only fitting that the strategies of Artists and Models are echoed in the 
merry modernisms of Jacques Rivette (Celine and Julie Go Boating 
[1974]), P. T. Anderson (Punch-Drunk Love [2002]), and Australia's Yahoo 
Serious (Mr. Accident [2000]).  AM

Rebel Without a Cause  Nicholas Ray, 1955
Too often, this acknowledged classic is unwittingly damned with faint 
praise as being the finest of the three features in which James Dean 
starred during his tragically short life. Rebel remains by far the best 1950s 
film dealing with the then-new phenomenon of teenage delinquency. 
It is also a key work from Nicholas Ray, an enormously talented and 
distinctive director who, sadly, remains as underrated now as he was 
when he worked in Hollywood.
Dean's Jim Stark gives voice to the agonizing confusion and alienation 
felt by so many of Ray's protagonists. From his first film, They Live By Night 
(1949), the director had repeatedly treated the lonely predicament of 
America's outsiders, showing himself especially sympathetic to the 
vulnerable young who looked for guidance from an older generation no 
wiser or happier than themselves. Jim feels let down by his family, his 
teachers, the cops, and most of his peers. The constant quest for kicks is 
as irresponsible (albeit less culpable, given their youth) as the adults' 
refusal to confront moral dilemmas. Together with other lost souls, Judy 
(Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo), Jim tries to establish his own 
alternative family, one based on mutual understanding. Small wonder 
that the trio, brought together by the absurd, unnecessary death of a 
friend driven by boredom to test his worth in a cliff top "chickee run," and 
united by idealistic notions of "sincerity," lives in a derelict dreamhouse 
in the Los Angeles hills, well away from other people.
Ray's response to the question of how to depict his young dreamers' 
romantic idealism is admirably and exhilaratingly physical. The film was 
originally slated for black and white, but Ray persuaded Warners to let 
him shoot in color. The often luridly expressionist hues and Ray's typically 
fraught CinemaScope compositions evoke the feverish nature of 
adolescent experience. Similarly, Ray uses architecture and setting, 
particularly the difference between public and private space, to heighten 
our understanding of the characters' emotions. The darkness inside a 
planetarium becomes a space to indulge in private jokes, refuge, and 
reverie, even contemplation of the individual's place in the cosmos. The 
terrace outside is later transformed by a lofty camera position into a sunlit 
arena where a bullfight-like knife fight is played out with appropriately 
histrionic gestures. Ray understands how, especially when young, we 
view our lives as drama. His immaculate sense of color, composition, 
cutting, lighting, and performance enhances the importance of the action.
Not just Dean's style but his whole body gives dramatic life to the 
turmoil within. Seeing Dean's Jim is witnessing a character being born, 
growing from moment to moment before our eyes. That, of course, is 
fitting for Rebel's subject matter, but it also complements Ray's direction 
in terms of how its acute physicality expresses the tormented vitality 
within. How sad, then, that the projects Ray and Dean planned to work 
on together never came to fruition. One great film had to suffice.  GA

Les maîtres fous  Jean Rouch, 1955
The Mad Masters
In 1954, ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch was invited by a group of 
Hauka in the West African city of Accra to document their yearly religious 
ritual. Over the course of this ceremony, the Hauka went into a trancelike 
state and were possessed by spirits representing the Western colonialists 
(the engineer, the wife of the doctor, the cruel major, and so on).
Though only thirty-six minutes long, the imagery in The Mad Masters 
is striking and frequently alarming: possessed men, their eyes rolling, 
foaming at the mouth, burning their bodies with torches. Indeed, Peter 
Brook's 1966 film Marat/Sade would reference the histrionics and made-
up language here captured on camera by Rouch.
But as the director himself has noted, for the Hauka possession by 
spirits was truth, not art. While the film never fully explains the meaning 
behind the ritual, Rouch's narration hints that participation in this religious 
ceremony results in a kind of catharsis, one that gives the Hauka—mostly 
rural migrant laborers—the strength needed to maintain their self-respect 
and continue working under harsh and oppressive conditions. As one 
scholar observes, the most intriguing issue raised by The Mad Masters 
concerns the complex relation of the Hauka sect to their experience of 
colonialism. One of the masterpieces of ethnographic cinema.  SJS
Hill 24 Doesn't Answer  Thorold Dickinson, 1955
Made by British director Thorold Dickinson, who had come to Israel to 
make a documentary on the army (The Red Background), Hill 24 Doesn't 
Answer was the first film of the national period to achieve an international 
success. Dickinson, who was influenced by the documentary/fiction films 
made in Britain during World War II, uses time-tested techniques of that 
genre (explanatory maps, an authoritative voice-over) to tell the story 
of a small Israeli unit defending a strategic hill position near Jerusalem 
against Arab attack in the 1948 war.
In the manner of David Lean's In Which We Serve, Dickinson spends 
little time on the action itself, which becomes the framework for telling 
the stories of the four main characters: an American Jew, an Irishman, a 
native-born Israeli, and a Sephardic Jew. All die in the successful defense 
of the position, which is thereby assured, after the visit of a U.N. observer, 
as belonging to Israeli. Flashbacks detail the reasons why each soldier 
has chosen to fight. The film is fervently pro-Zionist, with Druse and 
British characters presented sympathetically and the Arabs as an 
anonymous, hostile, destructive force, whose reasons for attack are 
never made clear. Despite the obvious propaganda, Dickinson's film is a 
small-scale masterpiece, an intriguing examination of motivation and 
heroism in the midst of deadly ideological struggle.  BP

It's 1945, just after World War II, and John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) is 
a one-armed ex-army man who steps off the train in Black Rock, a remote 
California desert town. We don't know what he's come for, nor do the 
inhabitants. But they are hostile, and it soon becomes clear that they are 
hiding something. Director John Sturges slowly tightens the tension as 
Macreedy digs deeper into the town's secret, while the inhabitants cut 
the phone wires and disable a car in which he tries to leave.
Set in an arid western landscape, to which the film's CinemaScope 
ratio gives full value, and shot in color, mostly in blinding sunlight, Bad 
Day at Black Rock is sandwiched between a number of notable Sturges 
Westerns, including Escape from Fort Bravo (1953) and Gunfight at the OK 
Corral (1957). Yet despite its look, Black Rock is really more of a film noir, 
with its story of dark secrets in the past. There's little physical action and 
hardly any gunplay, though one scene is memorable, when Macreedy is 
finally provoked to fight by the brutish Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine). 
The one-armed man reveals a repertoire of karate chops and punches 
that fell his opponent like a slaughtered ox.
Macreedy faces an impressive lineup of heavies here, including 
ringleader Reno Smith (Robert Ryan, whose hysteria is never far below 
the surface), and Lee Marvin in one of his most menacing roles as Hector 
David. Macreedy has to rely for help on the community's weaker 
members: the reclusive Doc (Walter Brennan) and the drunken, cowardly 
sheriff (Dean Jagger). Eventually Macreedy manages to invest them with 
a little of his courage and they help him make a break, but ultimately he 
is forced to rely on his own ingenuity.
The town's dirty secret proves to be the murder of a Japanese-American 
in the days following Pearl Harbor. The film was produced by Dore Schary, 
who tried to stand up to blacklisting and whose regime at MGM was 
marked by a number of liberal productions. Bad Day at Black Rock is a 
good example, a taut, expertly acted and directed thriller that pushes a 
fairly straightforward message about racial tolerance. But whatever its 
good intentions, it's Tracy whom we remember most. Few actors could 
project basic goodness so well, without a trace of sanctimoniousness.  EB

Nuit et brouillard  Alain Resnais, 1955
Night and Fog
Documentation of man's inhumanity to man is as old as history itself. 
Even so, little prepared the world for the atrocities of the Holocaust, a 
concerted series of events so horrific that it still boggles the mind. Aware 
how the passage of time has a way of diluting memories, however 
powerful, filmmaker Alain Resnais (who later rose to prominence as the 
director of such features as Hiroshima Mon Amour [1959]) decided to 
capture the Nazi atrocities on camera, if not for posterity then certainly 
as a lasting reminder of what we are capable of doing to one another.
The first film to truly address the Holocaust at a time when World 
War II still produced raw feelings, especially in Europe, Night and Fog 
juxtaposed black-and-white archival footage of concentration camps and 
their victims with pastoral color footage of the buildings and locations 
ten years later. Revealing the depths of distrust and denial that existed 
even a decade after the fall of the Third Reich, Resnais used footage from 
France, Belgium, and Poland, but conspicuously not from Germany. He 
showed that many of the people involved in the death camps either didn't 
know how to deal with their own guilt and complicity or didn't want to.
Denial is the driving point of Night and Fog. Resnais includes footage 
of the dead being bulldozed into mass graves, corpses hung on barbed 
wire fences, emaciated faces frozen in fear, skeletal nude bodies being 
paraded out for humiliation, and anonymous trains and trucks shipping 
who knows what to who knows where. He documents the gas chambers 
and crematoriums, as well as the Nazi's gruesome attempts to find a use 
for the discarded possessions, bones, skin, and bodies of their victims.
Resnais, in his own footage, notes that these death camps existed not 
in isolated outposts but frequently nearby major cities, hinting that 
everything that transpired happened with at least some degree of 
complicity on the part of civilians. Yet even the Nazis in charge of the 
camps deny culpability. One after the other, each claims, "I am not 
responsible." But if not them, asks the film, then who?
Night and Fog is more concerned with attributing collective blame 
than with pointing fingers at any specific figure. Even so soon after the 
war, Resnais realized that the fleeting nature of memory risked erasure 
of the Nazi horrors. "A crematorium may look as pretty as a picture 
postcard," notes the narrator. "Today tourists are photographed standing 
in front of them." Working from a script by Holocaust survivor Jean Cayrol 
and enlisting an oddly meandering score by Hanns Eisler (a Marxist and 
German exile who was also deported from America during Hollywood's 
own communist purge), Resnais lets the accumulated images of death 
and terror serve as a vivid rebuttal to any who would ever again turn 
their backs on such atrocities. If the brief but powerful Night and Fog 
does ultimately parallel the pithy form of a postcard, it is a postcard 
offering a perpetually valid message—evil can always resurface.  JKl

"The achievement of 
Resnais's film is to find a 
tone appropriate to the 
desolating enormity of 
what took place."

The Phenix City Story  Phil Karlson, 1955
Decent citizens fight a bloody war to drive out the vice racket that has 
earned their Alabama town the title of "Sin City, U.S.A." Based on fact and 
shot on location, Phil Karlson's The Phenix City Story relates to such 
postwar trends as the semidocumentary, the corrupt city exposé, and 
the syndicate gangster movie, but none of these labels accounts for the 
film's extraordinary visceral power.
Although its graphic violence was virtually unprecedented in 
Hollywood, what makes this low-budget shocker truly innovative is its 
recognition that new content calls for new form. The Phenix City Story is 
a purposefully ugly movie, full of ugly rednecks, ugly juke joints, ugly 
camera angles (in the sense that they flout the conventions of "good" 
composition), and ugly, unaestheticized violence. A little girl's glassy-
eyed corpse is heaved onto a suburban lawn, a crippled old man is shot 
point-blank in the mouth, the townspeople are bloodied and blasted 
with battlefield-like regularity. The atrocities are either shoved abruptly 
in our faces or kept at a bewildering distance, as if they were overwhelming 
the picture's capacity to represent them properly. Many movies since 
have portrayed more explicit and elaborate violence, but few have 
conveyed violence's chaotic force with such intelligent crudeness.  MR

1955
Kiss Me Deadly is a thick-ear masterpiece, wrenched by director Robert 
Aldrich and screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides from Mickey Spillane's trash 
novel, shot through with poetry ("Remember Me" by Christina Rosetti), 
unspeakable violence (the kicking naked legs of a woman tortured 
vaginally with a pair of pliers), hopped-up street talk ("3D-Pow! Va-va-
voom!"), strange characters, and fringe-fantastical elements.
After credits that roll the wrong way and a nighttime drive, the 
desperate Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman), naked under a trenchcoat, 
flags down thuggish private eye Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) and drags 
him into a plot involving spies, hoodlums, cops, a mastermind so erudite 
that he can only speak in metaphors when warning a dim-bulb blonde 
not to tamper with something deadly enough to kill everyone in range, 
codeword-dropping secret agents ("Los Alamos . . . Trinity . . . Manhattan 
Project") and a suitcase containing "the big whatsit" (a box of fissionable 
treasure that might be either pure plutonium or the head of Medusa). 
Meeker's nasty hero (note his smile as he tortures innocent witnesses by 
breaking irreplaceable opera records or slamming hands in drawers) 
sucker punches his way through a cast of perverts and sluts, then 
(at least in some prints) goes up with a mushroom cloud that rises from 
a beach house at the 1950s apocalypse of a finish.  KN

Kiss Me Deadly  Robert Aldrich, 1955
The Man with the Golden Arm  Otto Preminger, 1955
Few directors took so many risks within mainstream Hollywood as Otto 
Preminger. He had already released a film lacking an MPAA certificate 
with The Moon is Blue in 1953. However, it was his take on Nelson Algren's 
frank account of drug addiction that saw him at his boldest.
Sinatra plays Frankie Machine, an ex-con and heroin addict who wants 
to start life anew. His wife (Eleanor Parker) fakes her disability in order to 
ensure Frankie stays with her, while his old employer (Robert Strauss) 
wants him to return to dealing cards and his pusher (Darren McGavin) is 
keen to have him back on heroin. Only Molly (Kim Novak), an old flame, 
offers him any respite from his woes. But as his need for a fix increases, the 
world seems to close in on Frankie, eclipsing any hope of redemption.
Just two years after his career was resuscitated by a recording contract 
with Capitol Records and an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953), Frank 
Sinatra is on blistering form as Frankie. He conjures up a tragic figure 
whose attempts to better himself always seem destined to fail. Algren 
felt the adaptation bore little resemblance to his novel. True, Frankie is 
more sympathetic on-screen than he is on the page, but Preminger's 
unwillingness to pull any punches and the film's edgy score accentuate 
the impact of his addiction. The film would pave the way for an 
increasingly graphic representation of drug addiction on the screen.  IHS

1955
Hollywood's stereotyping of national cultures regularly gives offense, but 
who can resist the glimpse of Havana, Cuba, in a central scene of Guys 
and Dolls? Suave gambler Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) has talked prim, 
Salvation Army member Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) into taking a plane 
and dining with him. As she gets drunk and succumbs to her reckless 
impulses, she is enflamed by the primal, Latin American drama unfolding 
around her: her instant rival, an exotic dancer, trying to seduce Sky. Soon 
the whole room is swept up in a hilarious dance of drunken passions.
The scene offers a magnificent example of Michael Kidd's revolutionary 
choreography for film. Normal, everyday gestures, such as walking or 
pointing, are by degrees stylized, made angular and rhythmic, until the 
point of full-blown dance. The actions of individuals are woven into 
group patterns. And, above all, the staging incorporates movements that 
are deliberately ungainly, awkward, and seemingly amateur.
Guys and Dolls is really two films in one, divided up for its dual male 
stars—and indeed, there is an over-the-table dialogue between Brando 
and Frank Sinatra that anticipates the Al Pacino-Robert De Niro encounter 
forty years later in Heat (1995). The Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) half is more 
indebted to writer-director Joseph Mankiewicz's source, Damon Runyan's 
tales of lovable, streetwise crooks (every "ethnic" tic of New York speech and 
behavior lovingly exaggerated). Nathan has a long-suffering dame, Adelaide 
(Vivian Blaine), which leads to amusing material about their fraught path 
to the altar, such as "Adelaide's Lament" in Frank Loesser's colorful score.
Although the more conventionally polished, show-stopping group 
numbers like "Luck Be a Lady" and "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" are 
the ones Broadway devotees remember best, it is in the more romantic, 
Sky-Sarah half that the film really soars. The songs "If I Were a Bell" and 
"I'll Know When My Love Comes Along" are glorious swellings of amorous 
emotion, and Mankiewicz surrounds them with a wonderful mise-en-
scène of comings and goings, attractions and repulsions between these 
two admirable bodies.  AM

Based on a slim, stark novel by Davis Grubb, Charles Laughton's sole film 
as a director is a Depression-set fable of psychosis and faith, strikingly 
sinister and yet deeply humane. Told mostly from the point of view of 
children, the story is like a fairy tale in its simplicity, and yet seethes with 
adult complications. The trigger is a stash of money stolen by hard-up 
bandit Ben Harper (Peter Graves) and entrusted to his children John 
(Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), which makes Ben's desperate 
widow Willa (Shelley Winters) an object of attraction for one of the 
screen's most unforgettable villains. "Reverend" Harry Powell (Robert 
Mitchum), in black-and-white clerical garb with a puritan flat hat that 
curls into a set of demonic-looking horns, is associated with the Bible 
and a switchblade; with the words "love" and "hate" tattooed on his 
knuckles, his sermon consists of an allegorical talk about these forces 
locked in conflict illustrated as he arm wrestles with himself. Powell's 
wooing of Willa is high pressure, fooling the woman (who ends up 
serenely drowned) but not the children, who flee after the murder, the 
money stashed in the little girl's doll.
Mitchum, usually associated with cynical heroes, here plays a sincerely 
committed villain, moonlighting as a serial killer of loose women but 
sexually obsessed with the money he feels he needs to fund his 
bloody crusade. The nocturnal escape down river, shot in expressionist 
monochrome, is a magical sequence, with close-ups of strange-looking 
swampland flora and fauna. With Evil/Hate so powerfully conveyed, The 
Night of the Hunter needs an equally strong force to represent Good/
Love. Laughton managed to get silent star Lillian Gish to come out of 
semiretirement to play Rachel, a kindly woman whose farm is open to 
the many underage runaways who come down the path. Like the snake 
in Eden, Powell threatens Rachel's idyll, working his seamy charm on 
one of the older girls to find a way onto the farm. In a remarkable 
siege finale, Mitchum's menacing drone of an edited hymn ("Leanin' ") is 
joined and completed by Gish, who knows the full lyric ("Lean on Jesus") 
and adds her voice to his, banishing his darkness aurally before he is 
actually defeated.  KN

Alexander Mackendrick's final Ealing film (and also his darkest), made 
before he went to Hollywood and gave us the memorably bilious Sweet 
Smell of Success (1957), is a deliciously black comedy of English manners. 
A gang of thieves, hiding out disguised as a music quintet in the genteel 
Edwardian home of innocent and very, very proper little old lady Katie 
Johnson, decide they must murder her after she finds out about their 
recent robbery and insists they return the loot. The trouble is, the honor 
among these particular thieves is skewed, and although they can't quite 
bring themselves to kill off the sweet old thing, they have no such 
reservations with regard to one another.
Essentially, then, The Ladykillers is a farcical variation on the classic 
heist-gone-wrong theme, fascinating both for its deft characterizations 
(the gang comprise a devious mastermind, a bluff military type, an 
Italianate hit man, a spivvish "Teddy boy‚" and an intellectually 
challenged muscle man) and for its suggestion that postwar Britain, 
overly reverential toward an earlier age, was so divided as to be unable 
to move forward into the modern era. Otto Heller's color camera work 
and Jim Morahan's production design serve to reinforce the sense of a 
society trapped in the past.  GA

Sommarnattens leende  Ingmar Bergman, 1955
Smiles of a Summer Night
This first international success by Ingmar Bergman might, in retrospect, 
look like an anomaly in his career. In interviews Bergman often claimed 
he had no talent for comedy, and his later work in the genre—The Devil's 
Eye (1960) and All These Women (1964)—would seem to confirm this 
sentiment. However, with Waiting Women (1952) and especially A Lesson 
in Love (1954), he found a successful formula for witty, sophisticated 
comedies featuring the two excellent actors Gunnar Björnstrand and 
Eva Dahlbeck (lovingly referred to by the director as "The Battleship 
Femininity") as a middle-aged couple playfully tormenting each other.
Smiles of a Summer Night is a variation of this formula, transposed 
into a nineteenth-century moral comedy and with a theatrical plot 
heavily influenced by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Here, 
the Björnstrand character is a middle-aged philistine and Dahlbeck's 
an aging actress. Both are vain and self-important, living in separate 
relationships that have proved to be even more frustrating than their 
own former liaison. Egged on by an aphrodisiac wine and the magical 
twilight of a midsummer night, their—and their spouses'—true feelings 
are revealed. Everybody finds his/her true mate. But this new equilibrium 
of bourgeois complacency was later to be disrupted by Bergman with a 
vengeance in his hellish visions of marriage and midlife crisis in Scenes 
from a Marriage (1973) and From the Life of the Marionettes (1980).  MT

Based on a 1943 Broadway stage show by Richard Rodgers and Oscar 
Hammerstein II, Oklahoma! is a lively, colorful, full-blooded musical set

with Shirley Jones's farm girl Laurey Williams. Combining the boy-meets-
girl plotline of the romantic musical with the wide vistas of the best 
Westerns—mostly shot in Arizona rather than Oklahoma—the movie 
was a prestige studio production. 
The first musical directed by Fred Zinneman, a director hitherto better 
known for serious drama, Oklahoma! is generally a buoyant and joyous 
experience. Rod Steiger is the exception, whose appearance as Judd, 
Curly's bitter rival for Laurey's affections, gives the film a surprisingly dark 
and menacing layer. But it is the songs, such as "Oh What a Beautiful 
Morning," and accompanying dance numbers (choreographed by Agnes 
de Mille, who worked on the original Broadway show) that most impress. 
One of the last gasps from the halcyon days of the Hollywood musical, 
Oklahoma! remains a sterling example of the genre.  EL

Bob the Gambler, Jean-Pierre Melville's fourth feature, belongs to a very 
specific moment in history, and in the history of cinema. It is the milestone 
of a subtle turning point, and it maintains the flavor of this moment. 
Previously there was European cinema and American cinema. There was 
classic cinema and modern cinema. There were gangster films and 
comedies and daily chronicles. There was a guy, still rather young for a 
director, who at age thirty-nine, with one or two lives already behind him, 
had made a ghostly war film of incredible intensity (The Silence of the Sea 
[1949]), an adaptation from a Jean Cocteau novel (Les Enfants Terribles 
[1950]), and a lame melodrama (When You Read This Letter [1953]). Later, 
he would become the uncle of the New Wave, the French master of film 
noir, the director who paved the road for Sergio Leone, John Woo, and 
many others, the owner of a studio (quickly ruined), and the ultimate 
dandy of European filmmaking. But at the moment in question, Melville 
was working out the modernity of the second half of the twentieth century 
using the tools of the first half. Bob the Gambler is nostalgic and burlesque, 
yet filled with compassion and an accurate and respectful attention to 
places, objects, words, and the dreams everyone is entitled to live with.
Casino attacks, large-shouldered gangsters, macho talk, cars running 
fast in the dark, betrayal—sure! The film is a matter of human material, 
an inflection of voices, a remembrance of golden ages that never existed. 
It is often said that great films are universal and for all time. But Bob the 
Gambler is great for precisely the opposite reason: It belongs to its time 
and place, more or less consciously elaborating from that toward a 
completely different future. Although its ironic plot is important, the 
film's essence lies in its beauty and melancholy. Certainly, the world has 
gone on since Bob the Gambler. But something was captured in this film, 
like in a glass snow globe, for us to look back on and remember. And 
there is nothing sad in that.  J-MF

All That Heaven Allows  Douglas Sirk, 1955
On one level, Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows is like a fabulous, ironic 
piece of performance art, the relic of a specifically mid-twentieth-century 
genre that degenerated into television soap opera. But the emotional 
core of the film's distant lives is timelessly compelling. This is arguably 
the finest example of the plush 1950s Technicolor melodramas, and the 
most classic one made at Universal by Danish-born Sirk (formerly Detlef 
Sierck), a leftist theater-director-turned-filmmaker of some stature who 
fled with his Jewish wife from Nazi Germany to Hollywood. Back to 
square one as an unknown émigré, he applied distinctive taste to 
seemingly undemanding, trite assignments. His European sophistication 
and formal visual style elevated absurd and maudlin stories into 
deliriously entertaining heightened reality and multiple-hanky domestic 
dramas, including Magnificent Obsession (1954), Written on the Wind 
(1956), The Tarnished Angels (1958), and Imitation of Life (1959).
In All That Heaven Allows, pleasant middle-class widow Cary Scott 
(Jane Wyman), estranged from her selfish grown children and facing 
social ostracism from her shallow country club set, falls in love with 
young gardener Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson—a favorite of Sirk's who also 
appears as Wyman's leading man in Magnificent Obsession). Her distant 
son Ned (William Reynolds) is preoccupied with his career, and spoiled 
college-girl daughter Kay (Gloria Talbott) is embarrassed her mother is 
a woman with needs. Their idea of a great gift to fill mom's time is a TV 
set. Love wins out, but only after being tested by cruel gossip, tearful 
sacrificial separation, and a life-threatening crisis. These are all traditional 
staples of vintage women's pictures, but Sirk presents them with an eye 
for darker impulses beneath the suburban wholesomeness idealized in 
1950s America, and with a subtle handling of its repressed insecurities.
Along with Imitation of Life, All That Heaven Allows was a touchstone 
for Todd Haynes's bold, sumptuous homage melodrama Far From Heaven 
(2002). It also provided the source of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's racially 
charged reworking further down the socioeconomic scale. Ali: Fear Eats 
the Soul (1974) features a poor German widow, exposed to prejudice and 
derision when she falls in love with the much younger Ali, a kind, equally 
lonely North African immigrant. Costume design from All That Heaven 
Allows even found its way into the period homage French farce Eight 
Women (2002), with Catherine Deneuve's daughter arriving home for the 
holidays in a replica of Gloria Talbott's beanie hat and ensemble.
Hunky Hudson, who did much of his best work with Sirk, is perfectly 
sincere as the rugged but sensitive young outdoorsman in whom 
Wyman's soulful homemaker finds liberating warmth and empathy. The 
picture looks good enough to eat, with wonderful color, compositions, 
lighting, art direction, costumes, and cinematography. But the style 
serves the content superbly—observation of human nature with high 
gloss making heavenly romantic melodrama.  AE
"The one thing that 
Mr Sirk gave me was 
confidence . . . I, when 
I started out, was 
quite insecure . . . He 
said, 'You can do it.'"

age difference, Wyman was only 
eight years older than Hudson.

With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. DeMille's last feature 
and most extravagant blockbuster is full of absurdities and vulgarities, 
but the color is ravishing, and DeMille's form of showmanship, which 
includes his own narration, never falters. Charlton Heston might be said 
to achieve his apotheosis as Moses and most of the others in the cast are 
comparably mythic.
Simultaneously ludicrous and splendid, this epic is driven by the sort 
of personal conviction rarely found in subsequent Hollywood monoliths. 
To read it properly, one has to see it as an ideological, spiritual manifesto 
relating specifically to how DeMille viewed the Cold War world in 1956. 
Thus, when he appears in front of a gold-tasseled curtain to introduce 
the film, his main point isn't simply his use of ancient sources such as 
Philo and Josephus to recount the thirty years of Moses's life omitted in 
the Bible, but also to declare that "The theme of this picture is whether 
man should be ruled by God's laws or... by the whims of a dictator like 
Ramses." By "dictator," he's clearly thinking of a Mao Tse-tung figure, 
which the orientalism suggested by Yul Brynner as Ramses makes clear.
The film has sometimes been rereleased in a stretched, anamorphic 
widescreen format, which means the top and bottom of every frame is 
cropped. There may be some form of divine retribution at work here; 
DeMille was a notorious foot fetishist, and thanks to this studio trick, 
many of his foreground players have been deprived of their feet.  JRos

The Searchers  John Ford, 1956
The Searchers opens on a shot of a desert landscape seen from inside a 
house. Someone is approaching on horseback. It is Ethan Edwards (John 
Wayne), returned from the Civil War to his brother's ranch in Texas. From 
a series of looks and gestures we realize that Ethan is in love with his 
brother's wife, Martha (Dorothy Jordan). The next day he departs with a 
party of Texas Rangers in pursuit of Indians who have stolen some cattle. 
While he's away Comanches attack the ranch, killing Ethan's brother and 
sister-in-law and capturing their two daughters. For the remainder of the 
film, in actions set over a period of five years, Ethan and his part-Indian 
companion Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) crisscross the West in search of the girls.
How did John Ford turn this simple story into one of the greatest of 
all Westerns? First, there's the setting. Ford shot many Westerns in 
Monument Valley, an isolated region on the border between Utah and 
Arizona. The eroded red sandstone rocks are an awesome spectacle, and 
Ford's unerring eye for composition invests them with a special aura. The 
sheer size of the landscape makes the human figures seem especially 
vulnerable, and the life of the Texan settlers precarious. How could 
anyone scratch a living in such a barren wilderness?
At the heart of the story, though, is the figure of Ethan Edwards. As 
played by Wayne, Ethan is a colossus, overwhelming and indomitable. 
But he has a tragic flaw. Ethan is eaten up with hatred of the Indians, and 
it becomes clear that his quest is driven by an implacable racism. His 
intention, as Martin discerns, is not to rescue Debbie (Natalie Wood), his 
surviving niece, but to murder her. In Ethan's view she has become 
contaminated through contact with her Comanche captors. Slowly we 
realize that the Comanche chief Scar (Henry Brandon) functions as a kind 
of mirror image of Ethan. In raping Martha before he kills her, Scar has 
performed a horrific travesty of the act that Ethan secretly dreamed of 
committing. Ethan's urge to kill both Scar and Debbie thus arises from 
his need to obliterate his own illegitimate desires.
The true genius of The Searchers is in its being able to keep the 
audience's sympathy for Ethan, despite the evident fact that he is a 
murderous racist. In doing so, it elicits a far more complex and productive 
response than that of more obviously liberal films in this vein, such as 
Broken Arrow (1950). Instead of preaching a message, Ford leads us into 
the complexities of the American experience of racial difference.
Along the way there are many other pleasures, including a marvelous 
score by Max Steiner and comedy from stalwarts of the John Ford Stock 
Company such as Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Hank Worden, and Ward 
Bond. Vera Miles is excellent as Martin's girlfriend Laurie, whose mother 
is played by Olive Carey, widow of Ford's first Western star, Harry Carey.
In 1992, The Searchers was voted the fifth greatest movie of all time 
in a poll of international critics conducted by Sight & Sound magazine. 
That's quite an accolade, but Ford's picture lives up to it.  EB

Although Akira Kurosawa may be the most famous Japanese filmmaker 
in the West, his contemporary Kon Ichikawa has displayed equal artistry 
in literally dozens of films, among them The Burmese Harp, his elegy for 
lost innocence. Opening at the end of World War II, Captain Inouye 
(Rentaro Mikuni) leads his platoon into Burma with a mix of discipline 
and musical instruction. Trained to fight and to sing, the soldiers are an 
odd assortment of conscripts who eventually collide with Armistice Day.
Held in a British internment camp awaiting repatriation, they hear 
rumors about an isolated group of Japanese refusing to surrender. As 
Inouye's harp player and the center of his platoon's spiritual life, 
Mizushima (Shôji Yasui) volunteers to talk down the soldiers rather than 
let them die in an artillery barrage. Unimpressed with his entreaties, the 
entrenched force is killed and Mizushima assumed lost, but for the 
rumors his platoon clings to about his survival.
What follows is a touching journey as Mizushima awakens from the 
attack, injured and afraid. Aided by peasants, he begins making his way 
back to Inouye but gradually realizes a higher purpose. Garbed as a 
Buddhist monk he sets about burying the war dead strewn across 
Southeast Asia without funerary attention or final messages home. He 
recognizes the need to mourn, but also how the peace will be based on 
mutual care and personal loyalty, and so forsakes his old life to walk 
the earth bringing small labors to bear where they're needed. He 
subsequently crosses paths with Inouye on several occasions but finally 
explains his cause as a lasting tribute to the dead, both innocent and 
guilty, good and evil, because it's upon their backs the future will rise.
A breath of warm sentiment inserted over a macabre scenario, The 
Burmese Harp retains every bit of dignity associated with gentility and 
kindness. Burma itself becomes a passive supporting character, but the 
idea of a spiritual renewal, presented without dogma or propagandistic 
impulses, proves a likable epilogue to the horrors of World War II in this, 
Ichikawa's early masterpiece.  GC-Q

Forbidden Planet  Fred M. Wilcox, 1956
319
This superior 1950s sci-fi gem by director Fred M. Wilcox, ambitiously 
shot in widescreen CinemaScope, owes nothing to the period's paranoid 
McCarthyite preoccupation with hostile invaders from outer space but 
a great deal to the plot of William Shakespeare's The Tempest and the 
sophisticated psychological premise that the most dangerous monsters 
are those lurking in the primitive impulses of the subconscious mind.
Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) leads a mission to the 
planet Altair 4, to discover what became of an expedition from Earth of 
which nothing has been heard for decades. It finds the only survivors are 
brilliant, arrogant scientist Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his 
seductively miniskirted, child-of-nature daughter Altaira (Anne Francis), 
attended by one of film's best-loved metallic characters, the versatile 
and obliging Robby the Robot. Doctor Morbius has found the awesome 
remains of the ancient, annihilated Krell civilization, and dabbling with 
its technological wonders brings destruction down upon them all. 
Outstanding effects (including the unleashed "monsters from the 
id"), the awesome Krell underground complex, and Louis and Bebe 
Barron's eerie, groundbreaking score of electronic tones are among the 
treats in a much-referenced picture that inspired many later speculative 
fictions of technology running away with its users.  AE
Written on the Wind  Douglas Sirk, 1956
Robert Stack, in a drunken rage, smashes a bottle of booze against the 
wall. Lauren Bacall, at her bedroom curtain, faints. Gunshots, death, 
tears. And on the soundtrack, a male chorus begins singing: "Our night 
of stolen bliss was written on the wind." From its first moments, this is 
the Hollywood melodrama that encapsulates all others, in an electric, 
condensed, powerfully lyrical fashion.
Written on the Wind is about the twisted, fatal connections between 
sex, power, and money. Characters are arranged into inverted mirror 
images of each other, good facing evil—but everyone, ultimately, 
inhabits a complex, contradictory position in the impossible scheme of 
things. Dorothy Malone—marvelous as the quintessential bad girl who 
drinks, smokes, loves jazz, picks up guys at oil derricks, and sends her 
father plummeting down the stairs—is particularly riveting.
Few films are at once as visceral and insightful as Written on the 
Wind—a soap opera with passion, seriousness, and intelligence. Director 
Douglas Sirk specialized in films like All That Heaven Allows (1955) that 
were once dismissed by highbrows and lowbrows alike as "women's 
weepies." When they were finally rediscovered in the early 1970s at film 
festivals around the world, the audaciousness and true subversiveness 
of his work were appreciated for the first time.  AM

Un condamné à mort s'est échappé 
ou Le vent souffle où il veut 
A Man Escaped  Robert Bresson, 1956
If anyone needs to be won over to the joys and rewards of minimalism 
in cinema, A Man Escaped is the best place to start. Much of it shows 
Fontaine (François Leterrier) alone in his cell, making contact with fellow 
prisoners and slowly chipping his way to freedom. 
Like all of Robert Bresson's films, this one illustrates the director's 
long-developed theories of the "cinematograph": nonprofessionals 
giving strictly de-dramatized performances; enormous emphasis on 
offscreen sound and the information it carries; music held off until a final, 
glorious moment. And like the other great prison films of French 
cinema—Jacques Becker's Le trou (1960) and Jean Genet's Un chant 
d'amour (1950)—A Man Escaped offers a remarkably potent allegory of 
human suffering and the drive to liberation. At the same time, it delivers 
a taut form of suspense to rival the best of Alfred Hitchcock.
For many years, A Man Escaped was appreciated for its existential and 
spiritual dimensions: man's solitude, the fragility of communication with 
others, the gift of God's grace. More recently, its political dimension has 
been foregrounded, as a reflection of Bresson's experience in the French 
Resistance—thus giving his entire career, with its themes of subjection 
and "souls in torment," a socially grounded urgency.  AM
Though best known for Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Nicholas Ray's 
finest film is a brilliant expressionist melodrama that used the then-
topical controversy over the discovery and deployment of the "wonder-
drug" cortisone (a type of steroid) to mount a devastating critique on 
materialistic, middle-class conformism in the postwar era.
The brooding James Mason (who also produced) is perfectly cast as 
a small-town teacher beset by worries about money and middle age 
who, having been prescribed steroids, becomes addicted to the sense 
of well-being that they bring. This turns him into an irascibly neurotic, 
megalomaniac tyrant to his wife, son, and everyone around him. 
The drug, however, is merely the catalyst that ignites the loathing he 
feels for himself and the staid, complacently unquestioning world in 
which he is trapped. Indeed, his despair goes so deep that when, finally, 
he decides he must save his son from the depravities of humanity by 
killing him, and his wife (Barbara Rush) reminds him that God stopped 
Abraham from killing Isaac, Mason simply responds: "God was wrong."
A profoundly radical Hollywood movie, then, distinguished not only 
by its distaste for suburban notions of "normality" but by the beautifully 
nightmarish clarity of its intensely colored CinemaScope imagery.  GA

One of the most popular and paranoid films from the golden age of 
American science-fiction cinema, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is both 
an ambivalent Cold War allegory and an extraterrestrial terror tale.
Despite its B-movie feel, Siegel's film—based on a novel by Jack 
Finney—is less concerned with subscribing to generic sci-fi convention 
than with dramatizing the dangers of social conformity and the threat 
of invasion coming both from outside and inside one's own community. 
But the absence of any manifest monsters—partly due to economic 
considerations, the theme of "body snatching" plants and doppelganger 
drones served as a creative cost-cutting tactic—is more than made up 
for by the uncanny depiction of "ordinary life" that may no longer be so 
ordinary. As critic Kim Newman writes, "Rather than rubbery claws, 
animated dinosaurs, and alien death rays, the film finds horror in an uncle 
mowing the lawn, an abandoned roadside vegetable stall, a bar all but 
empty of patrons, a mother putting a plant in baby's playpen, or a crowd 
purposefully gathering in a town square at 7:45 on a Saturday morning."
When Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns home to his small 
California town of Santa Mira from a medical convention, he is confronted 
by strange reports from several of his patients, who insist that their 
seemingly benign relatives are in fact imposters. After some initial 
skepticism, Miles is convinced when, during a barbecue with some 
friends, he discovers two huge seed pods that burst open to release a 
bubbly fluid and two incomplete human replicas, one of which is well 
on its way to looking like himself. Speculating that a bizarre alien invasion 
is underway, Miles and his love interest Becky (Dana Wynter) attempt a 
getaway as the entire town falls sway to the pods' dehumanizing effects.
A cinematic nightmare concerning the potential communist threat 
or an anti-McCarthyist "message" movie wrapped in the protective garb 
of sci-fi fantasy? Invasion of the Body Snatchers offers evidence to support 
either interpretation. And the film's open, pessimistic ending, as Miles 
wanders onto a highway and shouts, "You're next!" directly to the camera, 
will make you wonder who you're really sleeping next to at night.  SJS

Edna Ferber specialized in writing sprawling family sagas, several of 
them set in the West. Her 1930 novel Cimarron was twice filmed by 
Hollywood, as was the 1926 film Show Boat, set in the Deep South. 
In Giant, written in 1950, Bick Benedict (Rock Hudson) is a Texas 
cattle baron who marries a spirited Maryland belle, Leslie (Elizabeth 
Taylor). Bick's sister has left some of the property to Jett Rink (James 
Dean), a former employee. Rink discovers oil and grows immensely rich, 
but his personal life is a disappointment—he carries a torch for Leslie—
and he declines into alcoholism. As Bick and Leslie grow older, they are 
concerned with who will run the ranch after they have gone. Their 
daughter (Carroll Baker) wants to take over, but Leslie doesn't approve. 
To Bick's disappointment, their son (Dennis Hopper, who also appeared 
with Dean in Rebel Without a Cause) has married a Latina woman and 
become a doctor. Eventually Bick and Leslie come to terms with life.
At well over three hours, Giant certainly lives up to its title. But 
the performances are outstanding, not least that of the twenty-four-
year-old James Dean, who was tragically killed in a car crash shortly 
after completing his part. Director George Stevens does justice to the 
immensity of the Texas landscape, and, unusually for the time, the film 
deals interestingly with both racial and class differences.  EB

The Wrong Man  Alfred Hitchcock, 1956
323
The Wrong Man is one of the bleakest pictures Hitchcock ever directed. 
Henry Fonda plays Manny Balestrero, a jazz musician who is mistakenly 
identified as the man who held up an insurance office. Although he is 
released on bail, the worry and disgrace begin to affect his wife Rose 
(Vera Miles). They try to find the people who can confirm Manny's alibi, 
but fail. Rose has a breakdown before the trial and is confined to an 
asylum. Eventually, quite by chance, the real hold-up man is discovered, 
but this has little effect on her state of mind.
Shot in black and white, with an almost documentary-style realism, 
The Wrong Man is based on a real case, as stated by Hitchcock himself in 
a short prologue. "This is a true story, every word of it," he notes. "And yet 
it contains elements that are stranger than all the fiction that has gone 
into many of the thrillers that I've made before." It explores one of his 
perennial themes: that of the man accused of a crime he did not commit 
(1959's North by Northwest has a similar situation). The director brilliantly 
conveys how readily the procedures of indictment and incarceration 
conspire to impart a sensation of guilt even in the innocent. In a masterly 
sequence making use of a subjective camera, we see Manny suffer the 
humiliation of being booked, searched, and fingerprinted, the dirty ink 
on his hands seeming like a confirmation of his guilt.  EB
High Society  Charles Walters, 1956
A musical update of George Cukor's romantic farce The Philadelphia Story 
(1940), High Society unites the unbeatable melodic talents of Bing 
Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong with the beauty of Grace 
Kelly in her final film role before she became Princess Grace of Monaco.
Icy, spoiled Tracy (Kelly) is due to marry dull, dependable beau George 
(John Lund)—but, on the eve of her nuptials, her ex-husband Dexter 
(Crosby) returns to try and put a stop to the wedding. On hand to report 
on the shenanigans behind the social event of the year are journalists 
Liz (Celeste Holm) and Mike (Sinatra), with jazz great Armstrong (playing 
himself) providing something of a Greek chorus, bringing the audience 
up to speed with Dexter and Tracy's complicated entanglements.
Following endless Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and early 1950s 
that were packed with elaborate song and dance numbers, director 
Charles Walters seamlessly fits nine simple renditions of Cole Porter 
songs into the proceedings, rather than have them take over the film. 
Armstrong begins by singing the plot-explaining "High Society" from the 
back of a cramped limousine shared with his band, while the classic 
"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" is spiritedly sung by Sinatra and Holm 
alone in a room filled with Tracy's many extravagant wedding gifts. A 
light, frothy, and timeless piece of musical comedy.  JB

Kumonosu jo  Akira Kurosawa, 1957
Throne of Blood
Quite rightly, Akira Kurosawa's artfully chilling, formal, and extremely 
close adaptation of Macbeth is regarded as one of the most breathtaking 
screen versions of the play. "My aim was to transform Shakespeare...," he 
said, "by borrowing freely from Japanese art forms." Both the plot and 
psychology translate beautifully to feudal Japan, where samurai warrior 
General Washizu (Toshirô Mifune) and his fiendish wife Lady Asaji (Isuzu 
Yamada), driven by ruthless ambition and inspired by a witch's prophecy, 
murder their warlord, seize a kingdom, and damn themselves to an 
inescapable, ritual finality of bloodshed, paranoia, madness, and ruin.
The wonderful Mifune—Kurosawa's favorite leading man in a long-
running collaboration (more than sixteen films) that is as notable as that 
of Martin Scorsese's with Robert De Niro—furthered his reputation as 
Japan's preeminent international star with this performance. Washizu's 
brilliantly staged death scene, transfixed in a hail of arrows, is one of the 
great iconic images of world cinema. Elements of Noh theater, traditional 
Japanese battle art, historical realism, and contemporary thinking on the 
nature of good and evil are fused in a confined, mist-shrouded world of 
sinister and magical portents in forest and castle (set in locations high 
up Mount Fuji, where the castle was built with the brawny assistance of 
a U.S. Marine battalion stationed nearby).  AE
"Nobody in Hollywood wanted to do [Paths of Glory] at all," Stanley 
Kubrick remembered. Yet, with Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson, 
he adapted Humphrey Cobb's novel, about an actual shameful incident 
that took place in the French army in World War I, into a powerful film—
one that's all the more effective for the director's matter-of-fact coolness 
in dealing with the unthinkably horrible.
A pair of ruthless but inept generals (Adolphe Menjou and George 
Macready) order their men to hurl themselves suicidally at the German 
positions; when a few survivors limp back after being practically wiped 
out, the regiment is accused of cowardice, and a randomly selected trio 
of foot soldiers are put on trial. Committed Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) 
mounts a defense, but politics decree that the three humble, innocent 
soldiers—absolutely the bravest imaginable—go to the wall. 
Grim, intelligent, and wonderfully acted, this is the best type of war 
movie: It makes its audience angry. It also climaxes, after the executions, 
with the most emotional scene Kubrick ever directed, in which a roomful 
of jeering soldiers force a captured German girl (Susanne Christian, later 
Christiane Kubrick) to entertain them by singing a song, only to be 
moved to silence by her awkward, sincere, melancholy performance.  KN

Paths of Glory  Stanley Kubrick, 1957

1957
"Darling, if you can paint, I can walk again!" For years, Cary Grant's 
and Deborah Kerr's thorny path in An Affair to Remember was almost 
illicitly adored. Then it was outed, by its prominent part in the 1993 film 
Sleepless in Seattle, as one of the definitive chicks'-night-in flicks, ideally 
viewed with abundant chocolate and a box of tissues at hand. 
The film—a remake of his own 1939 comedy-drama starring Irene 
Dunne and Charles Boyer, Love Affair—reflects two competing sides 
of producer-writer-director Leo McCarey. In his prime, the comedy 
mastermind teamed Laurel with Hardy, directed the Marx Brothers in 
Duck Soup, and won his first Oscar directing Grant in the 1930s screwball 
classic The Awful Truth. But McCarey also had a shameless sentimentality 
that oozed in his 1940s favorite Going My Way (for which he won 
Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, and Writer).
Grant's witty playboy Nickie Ferrante, a failed artist, and Kerr's wary 
nightclub singer Terry McKay (her vocals dubbed by premiere studio 
singer Marnie Nixon, who also voiced Kerr in The King and I) meet aboard 
a luxury liner and surrender—amid much worldly good humor—to their 
attraction. Unfortunately, both are encumbered with betrotheds and 
pasts. They make a romantic pact. In six months, if they have turned their 
lives around, they will meet atop the Empire State Building and live 
happily ever after. In due course, the reformed Grant puts his 
paintbrushes away and happily paces the skyscraper's observation deck, 
but Kerr, running excitedly to him, is hit by a car.
What follows is almost inconceivable to the cell phone generation. 
Believing he's been stood up, Grant succumbs to embittered cynicism, 
unaware Kerr is bravely coming to terms with paralysis, too proud to let 
him know her situation. Comedy is abandoned in the hanky-wringing 
second half of the film, as the audience is kept in a deliciously protracted 
will-they-or-won't-they agony. McCarey overdoes it with songs, but even 
Kerr coaching a choir of overly cute urchins can't spoil the reunion, the 
revelation, and the big-clinch climax.  AE

Det sjunde inseglet  Ingmar Bergman, 1957
The Seventh Seal
The image of a black-robed, white-faced Death (Bengt Ekerot) playing 
chess on the beach with a weary, questioning crusader (Max von Sydow) 
is as ingrained in the memory of moviegoers as King Kong atop the 
Empire State Building, Humphrey Bogart spurning Ingrid Bergman at 
the airport, Janet Leigh stabbed in the shower, or the Imperial Cruiser 
passing over the camera. This one scene from Swedish arthouse gem 
The Seventh Seal epitomizes the momentousness, excitement, and impact 
new types of cinema had at a point when Hollywood certainties were in 
recession. How else to explain the parodies or references in films as varied 
as Roger Corman's Masque of the Red Death (1964), Woody Allen's Love 
and Death, John McTiernan's Last Action Hero (1993), and Peter Hewitt's 
Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991), in the last of which Death plays Twister?
But it's a shame this scene has come to represent the whole of the 
film in popular imagination. There's an unfair sense that writer-director 
Ingmar Bergman was being overly solemn, making something that could 
stand as an archetype of seriousness or artiness. Actually, The Seventh 
Seal, although rooted in the big themes of Bergman's great period, is a 
very playful, frequently comic picture: a medieval fable influenced by his 
enthusiasm for the samurai movies of Akira Kurosawa and as concerned 
with celebrating simple pleasures as indicting complicated torments.
Antonius Block (Sydow), returning after ten years on a bloody crusade 
that was started by a con man who now makes a living robbing corpses, 
feels that his faith in God is a disease that mankind should root out. 
With his squire (Gunnar Björnstrand), as much a debating partner as 
sidekick, Block encounters death in the form of a plague-ridden corpse 
before he meets the literal Grim Reaper. The game of chess played 
throughout the film between Death and the knight is not merely for the 
crusader's life but for his feelings about God, religion, and humanity. In 
the end, hope comes from an alternative Holy Family—a jolly juggler 
(Nils Poppe), his earthy sensual wife (Gunnel Lindblom), and their lively, 
innocent toddler—whom Block saves from the plague by willingly 
joining the dance of death that claims more venal, corrupted characters.
The knight, constantly tormented by curiosities about God and the 
void (he even visits an accused witch about to be burned to ask her what 
the Devil knows about God), represents one side of Bergman. The simple 
showman gently upbraided by his practical wife ("You and your dreams 
and visions," she says in the film's closing line) represents another seeking 
redemption through honest entertainment and appalled when his 
innocent show is upstaged by the horrible, Church-approved spectacle 
of a crowd of penitents being lashed and tortured. Bergman is angry and 
saddened by human evils, especially when sanctioned by supposed 
religion, but the film also celebrates physical and spiritual love, 
communal artistic expression, food and drink, and natural beauty.  KN

Sidney Lumet's courtroom drama enjoys enduring popularity because 
it is a hothouse for smart performances, sudden twists, and impassioned 
monologues. Uniquely, the brilliantly economical and riveting drama of 
12 Angry Men does not actually take place in the courtroom—except for 
a brief prologue as the jury is sent out with the judge's instructions—but 
during a single, sweltering afternoon in the jury room.
Henry Fonda plays Juror No. 8, the holdout whose reasonable doubt 
and well-reasoned resistance gradually bring eleven other jury members 
around from their first swift verdict of guilty in the case of a youth 
prosecuted for the murder of his father. Fonda was impressed by the 
power in Reginald Rose's ingeniously contrived teleplay, broadcast live 
on CBS in 1954 (and believed lost until 2003, when a tape was found). 
Recognizing a role that perfectly suited his calm sincerity and seeing the 
opportunity for a gripping feature, he put his own money into producing 
the film. He gave the assignment to Lumet, a dynamic veteran of live TV 
drama whose expertise enabled him and director of photography Boris 
Kaufman—another expert at working in restricted spaces and in black 
and white—to mine the mounting tension from Rose's tightly structured 
script and to wrap the film in under twenty days.
Lumet's engrossing debut film makes no apologies for its theatricality 
but makes a virtue of its claustrophobic, sweaty intensity. And each actor 
makes his mark in this showcase of superb characterizations and 
ensemble dynamics, from Martin Balsam's insecure foreman to a leonine 
Lee J. Cobb's belligerent, embittered Juror No. 3. Interestingly, two of the 
men, Joseph Sweeney as elderly, insightful Juror No. 9 and George 
Voskovic as methodically minded Juror No. 11, had been in the original 
television production. Class and ethnic prejudices, private assumptions, 
and personalities all come out in a colossal struggle for unclouded 
judgment. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, but 
its greatest accolade is that after seeing this picture, no one ever enters 
into jury duty without fantasizing about becoming a dogged champion 
of justice à la Fonda, whatever the case at hand.  AE

Arguably the warmest of Bergman's masterpieces, Wild Strawberries 
charts the geographical and spiritual odyssey of the elderly Professor 
Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjöström), whose name in Swedish more or 
less means "icy fortress." With his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid 
Thulin), Borg drives from Stockholm to the University of Lund to receive 
an honorary degree. En route he gives a ride to three young 
hitchhikers—including the vivacious Sara (Bibi Andersson), who in 
name and nature reminds him of the love of his life—and a middle-
aged couple. He visits his now-ancient mother, before finally trying to 
have a heart-to-heart talk with his son Evald (Gunnar Björnstrand), a 
cynical misanthrope whom Marianne has planned to leave. The 
conversation with Evald is crucial because it might save his son's 
marriage and because it shows the professor's journey has brought a 
degree of self-knowledge. He has become aware of his mortality and 
emotional reticence—inherited from his parents, consolidated by life's 
disappointments and his immersion in work, and unwittingly passed 
on, like a virus, to Evald.
The strength of Bergman's account of this day in the life is the assured 
manner in which he combines the realities of Borg's life. The inner and 
external details throw light upon the man. His dreams and memories 
illuminate our understanding of him (and his understanding of himself), 
as do his various encounters and conversations. Marianne, though 
tactful and affectionate, explicitly alludes to Borg's failings. Sara reminds 
him of his more passionate youth. The arguing couple call to mind both 
his own grouchiness and the future Marianne may face with Evald.
Borg's redemptive acquisition of self-knowledge affects those around 
him, too, yet Bergman never inflects this conclusion with sentimentality. 
Blessed with a radiant yet courageously uningratiating performance from 
Sjöström—himself Sweden's greatest filmmaker before Bergman—this 
remarkable, much-imitated film has an emotional honesty entirely in 
keeping with the voyage undergone by its protagonist.  GA

The Incredible Shrinking Man  Jack Arnold, 1957
Exposed to a mysterious, probably radioactive cloud while on a cruise, 
Scott Carey (Grant Williams) finds himself gradually shrinking. Director 
Jack Arnold's visual flatness is perfectly suited to the absurdity and 
ambiguity of the premise of Richard Matheson's story. The first half of 
The Incredible Shrinking Man—portraying the hero's predicament as 
alternately a medical, a domestic, and a socioeconomic problem—is 
a worthy companion piece to Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life (1956) and 
Douglas Sirk's Written on the Wind (1956), in its ironic and terrifying 
depiction of American middle-class life turned inside out. 
But it's in the second half of the film—Scott, now smaller than the 
heel of a shoe, is marooned in his basement and must cope with various 
natural threats—that The Incredible Shrinking Man really takes off. "I had 
complete freedom, because the studio knew nothing about the making 
of science-fiction films," said Arnold. The inspirational conclusion—"to 
God, there is no zero"—is a rare example of popular cinema explicitly 
dealing with metaphysics.
Much of the film's force comes from its psychological incisiveness 
and from its vivid and precise use of objects—its architecture of stairs, 
crates, matchboxes, and paint cans. For Matheson and Arnold, Scott 
Carey is an atomic-age Everyman: His adventure is an object lesson in 
the hostility of the built-up environment and in the indestructible 
propensity of humankind to make itself the measure of all things.  CFu
John Sturges's staging of the famous battle between Wyatt Earp and 
the Clanton gang in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881, was 
not the first film version. But Sturges's film is a little more accurate than 
John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946). Ford, for example, has Earp's 
associate Doc Holliday killed in the battle; in fact, he survived six more 
years. Gunfight at the OK Corral is a slick production, technically excellent 
and with a big budget, and it benefits from a fine cast. Burt Lancaster 
is full of authority as Earp, at times chilling in his determination. By 
contrast, Kirk Douglas has great fun with the consumptive Holliday, 
flashing a ready smile but deadly as a snake. There is also strong support 
from Jo Van Fleet as "Big Nose" Kate, Doc's put-upon woman, and John 
Ireland as gunslinger Johnny Ringo.
The melodious score, by Dimitri Tiomkin, who also did the music for 
other town-taming Westerns such as High Noon and Rio Bravo, made 
a considerable contribution, and Frankie Laine's theme song was a big 
hit. However, those wanting a more realistically downbeat treatment of 
the Wyatt Earp story should watch Sturges's 1967 sequel, Hour of the 
Gun, in which the incident at the OK Corral is just the start.  EB

Gunfight at the OK Corral  John Sturges, 1957

The Cabiria of the title in Fellini's classic is played by the filmmaker's wife, 
Giulietta Masina, who justifiably won the Best Actress award at Cannes 
for her portrayal of a naïve prostitute. Shamed by her profession, the 
feisty Cabiria hopelessly searches for a wealthy sugar daddy to take her 
away, but deep down what she's actually looking for is lasting love. 
After its Cannes premiere, a controversial segment involving a 
good Samaritan with a sackful of good will was excised following the 
protest of the Catholic Church. Apparently spontaneous generosity is 
a provincial trait, but fortunately the footage was eventually returned. 
Indeed, the issue of goodness is paramount in Fellini's film, where 
beneath a worldly facade Cabiria just wishes to be happy, like anybody 
else. Yet Cabiria is the ultimate hooker with a heart of gold, never so 
glum that a good mambo or a street fair can't raise her spirits. 
Cabiria can't help but to spread her kindness, but it often sets her up 
for disappointment or, even worse, humiliation. A chance encounter 
with a carnival hypnotist (Aldo Silvani) who draws out her inner desires 
is quite moving but particularly cruel, as it erroneously suggests that 
her dreams and fantasies of a better life may actually come true. Her 
openness even leads an onlooker to exploit her emotional weakness. 
The equally cruel attentions of a philandering movie star (Amedeo 
Nazzari) also set her up with false hopes, even if Cabiria is ultimately (and 
literally) treated no better than a dog.
Cabiria's dreams never do come true, and in fact frequently result 
in casual violence as predators prey on her plucky innocence. Still, 
Fellini doesn't exploit Cabiria's story for easy sympathy. She's a strong, 
proud woman who gets into fights, responding to every setback by 
picking herself up, brushing herself off, and starting her march to a new, 
better life all over again. Nights of Cabiria is—like another of Fellini's 
masterpieces, La Dolce Vita (1960)—told from the perspective of the 
underclass, a glimpse at the proverbial other half gilded with optimistic 
joy but ultimately steeped in sadness.  JKl

1957
In the last years of Stalin and Stalinism, Soviet cinema almost vanished. 
The continuing economic devastation wrought by World War II, as well 
as the pervasive fear that defined everyday life, caused the once-thriving 
Soviet studios to practically close shop. After Stalin's death in 1953, a 
reborn Soviet cinema slowly began to emerge, and the film that came 
to symbolize that rebirth was Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes Are Flying. 
Ostensibly a wartime romance about lovers—Boris (Aleksei Batalov) 
and Veronika (Tatiana Samojlova), who are separated soon after the start 
of the conflict—the film boldly defied just about every cliché of the 
genre. Rather than celebrating the glorious victories of the Red Army, 
Cranes focuses on some of the war's darkest moments, when the highly 
efficient and terrifying German war machine was easily routing the 
poorly organized and equipped (if heroic) Russian army.
On the home front there is little but despair and a sense that one 
has to look out for number one. Admirably, Soviet audiences heartily 
embraced this reflection of their wartime experiences; tired perhaps of 
propaganda, they knew only too well that the war had in truth produced 
few heroes of any sort. As the young lovers, Batalov and Samojlova are 
wonderfully affecting, sexy, and endearing, yet the true star of the film 
is cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky's voluptuous camera work. With 
his breathtaking crane shots, sweeping pans, and vibrant handheld 
work, Urusevsky (who had worked with Dovzhenko on the brilliant 
wartime documentary The Battle for the Soviet Ukraine) makes tangible 
the sense of a world that has lost its moorings or even any fixed point of 
reference—moral, political, or otherwise. 
Urusevsky would go on to make with Kalatozov the infamous, if 
much admired, I Am Cuba (1964). Although that film for some feels 
overwhelmed by its baroque stylization, Cranes never indulges in visual 
effects for their own sake. It also became the first Cold War-era Soviet 
film to receive wide distribution (by Warner) in the United States.  RP

Aparajito is the second film in Satjyajit Ray's great Apu trilogy. Following 
the death of his sister in Pather Panchali (1955), the young Apu (Pinaki 
Sengupta) and his parents have moved to Benares. While his father 
Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) earns his priestly living on the banks of the 
Ganges, the boy roams the city, fascinated and delighted by the rich 
ferment of sights and sounds it affords. But Harihar contracts a fever and 
dies, and Apu's mother Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), unable to survive 
on her own, takes her son back to the country to her father-in-law's 
household. Apu, having tasted the wider world, is no longer satisfied 
with the simple village life he grew up with, and the local schoolmaster 
encourages the lad in his ambition and curiosity. At sixteen he wins a 
scholarship to study in Calcutta. Caught up in the excitement of the city, 
Apu (now played by Smaran Ghosal) returns home rarely and reluctantly. 
Sarbojaya, lonely and desperately sick, refuses to appeal to her son's 
sympathy for fear of hampering his education. Finally a letter from Apu's 
uncle brings him home—a day too late. After the funeral, refusing to 
follow his father into the priesthood, he leaves again for Calcutta.
As befits its midway status, Aparajito forms the bridge in Ray's trilogy. 
It opens up the timeless, self-contained life of Pather Panchali's Bengali 
village to the disruptive influence of the city, showing Ray's young hero 
torn between the two worlds, gradually and inevitably growing away 
from his parents. As always, Ray doesn't load the dice in favor of one 
character or another. We understand why Apu feels compelled to seek 
the wider world; we share his delight in learning, his sense of personal 
achievement. At the same time, however, we see Sarbojaya's pain; she's 
lost her daughter to an early death, now she's losing her son. In the film's 
most poignant moment, Sarbojaya, near death, waits at night for the 
train that she hopes will bring Apu back to her one last time. In the 
distance a train arrives; she stumbles eagerly to her feet, gazing into the 
darkness. Nothing—only silence and the dance of the fireflies.  PK

The Bridge on the River Kwai  David Lean, 1957
There may be no honor among thieves, but wartime enemies are a 
different matter. At least that's the belief of Alec Guinness's Colonel 
Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai, who insists that the Japanese 
overseers of their sweltering Burmese prison camp treat his men and 
him with decency. But as this consummate commander and paragon of 
English pragmatism organizes the construction of an enemy railroad 
bridge, a team of Americans led by escaped prisoner of war Major Shears 
(William Holden) is on its way to blow it to bits.
Director David Lean plays the looming conflict for maximum irony, 
setting Guinness up as the tragic counterpart to Holden's unsentimental 
Yank. As usual, Lean loads his film with details, filling the widescreen 
image with elaborate action and immaculately constructed sets. But 
holding this epic World War II film together are the performances of 
its three iconic leads: the stiff and traditional Guinness, the loose 
and cynical Holden, and Sessue Hayakawa as the Japanese colonel 
unknowingly stuck in the middle of a battle of cross-Atlantic wills. 
The final scenes of destruction are justly lauded for their stunt work, 
choreography, and editing, but one of the most memorable elements of 
River Kwai remains English composer Malcolm Arnold's whimsical, 
whistled "The Colonel Bogey March."  JKI
Sweet Smell of Success  Alexander Mackendrick, 1957
A wonderfully bitter satire on the celebrity biz, with smarmy press agent 
Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) toadying to monstrous newspaper columnist 
J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster), but clearly on the road to wrecking his 
own life through his devotion to getting ahead. Sweet Smell of Success 
has a great smoky jazz score from Chico Hamilton and reeks of New York 
circa 1957—taking us through the buzzing night spots where the 
desperate pay court to the demented and souls are sold for column 
inches, to the rainswept streets where brutally crooked cops plant dope 
on jazz musicians or beat J.J.'s enemies half to death.
Director Alexander Mackendrick more than makes the transfer from 
Ealing comedy (Whisky Galore!, The Man in the White Suit, The Ladykillers) 
to ferocious frenzy. He picks up on the cynical, observational attitude 
of Ernest Lehmann's hardboiled newsprint script and adds gothic 
shadows: The monumental Lancaster, lit like the Frankenstein monster, 
is amazingly hateful ("match me, Sidney"). Meanwhile, Curtis does his 
best screen work as the quivering minion, eating himself up from the 
inside as he tries to do J.J. a favor—one that rebounds dreadfully by 
breaking up the romance between a square jazzman (Marty Milner) and 
the fragile little sister (the sadly unprolific Susan Harrison) that J.J. is 
smothering with a palpably incestuous love.  KN

Mebhoob Khan's Mother India remains the quintessential Indian film 
over fifty years after its release. The picture depicts the struggle of a 
woman, Radha (Nargis), to reconcile traditional values and village life 
with a promised modern utopia. An international success with 
audiences across much of Asia and Africa—who regarded India as a role 
model in the struggle for decolonization—Mother India also gained 
recognition in Europe and America as one of the few Indian films ever 
nominated for an Oscar.
Mehboob Khan, one of the first directors in India to use color to 
great effect, had worked on an epic scale in his historical films, and he 
brought these skills to bear in this study of village life. In the process, he 
forged a national epic: a new story for a new nation. Mother India has 
a powerful storyline, following the heroine from marriage to old age, 
and is dense in mythological references, as characters' names associate 
them with key figures in the Hindu pantheon. 
The film features the top stars of its day, notably Nargis, Raaj Kumar, 
and Sunil Dutt. A frisson occurred when Nargis, who had been 
romantically linked to the legendary Raj Kapoor, married Sunil Dutt after 
the film's completion, not least because he played her son on-screen. 
Mother India's perennially popular music is by Naushad Ali, a blend of 
folk tunes and classical ragas (melodies) orchestrated in a Western style 
with the hundred-piece orchestra—a byword of Hindi film style that Ali 
is said to have introduced. Mother India also has spectacular visuals; its 
shots of the heroine dragging a plow like a beast of burden, and the 
happy faces of Radha and her sons after the harvest, looking out to a 
bright future in the style of Soviet realism, have become iconic.
The complexities of Mother India and the host of different readings 
it has generated make it one of the few films that can still draw 
audiences to theaters whenever it is screened. It is the first Indian movie 
to which anyone with an interest in world cinema should turn.  RDw

Touch of Evil  Orson Welles, 1958
For decades, filmmakers have paid homage to Orson Welles's 1950s noir 
Touch of Evil. It's a lurid tale of corruption and conscience, played out in 
the strip joints and motels of a sleazy border town, with honorable 
Mexican narcotics official Charlton Heston and degenerate American 
cop Welles at odds over a murder whose jurisdiction is in dispute while 
Janet Leigh becomes a terrorized pawn in their battle of wills.
Heston strong-armed Universal into hiring Hollywood pariah Welles 
to direct as well as play the role of Hank Quinlan. Welles immediately 
threw away the script and wrote his own adaptation of Whit Masterson's 
pulp novel Badge of Evil, transforming a cheap little thriller into great art. 
Steeped in sinister atmosphere, the film is celebrated for its remarkable 
single tracking-shot opening, a dazzling three minutes in which the 
camera crane swoops through the busy night scene as Miguel "Mike" 
Vargas (Heston) and his pert blonde American bride Susan (Leigh) stroll 
across into the United States for an ice-cream soda. An unidentifiable 
man plants a bomb in a convertible, pedestrians scurry around, the 
driver's floozy companion complains she's "got this ticking noise in my 
head," the newlyweds and a border patrol guard exchange enough small 
talk to establish their back story, and kaboom, the honeymoon is over.
Police chief Quinlan arrives from the American side of the border to 
control the investigation while Susan is waylaid by the Mexican drug 
dealers Vargas has been working to shut down. Within minutes the cards 
have been dealt in a malevolent, deeply perverse game. To prevent Vargas 
from exposing him as a criminal, Quinlan will have Susan abducted and 
drugged (by Mercedes McCambridge's lesbian in leather and her reefer-
maddened thugs). Quinlan is one of the giant film noir psychopaths, a 
bloated figure whose abuse of power has turned him into a monster (the 
already hefty Welles expanded with padding and false nose). Heston as 
a Mexican seems a preposterous idea, but his performance is interesting, 
his confidence sufficient to prevent the satiric Welles from crushing him. 
But the most affecting character is the tragic, belatedly ennobled figure 
of Quinlan's adoring lackey, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia).
Rivaling the opening are a series of bold, complex set pieces that have 
given Touch of Evil its reputation as film noir's epitaph, Welles theatrically 
exaggerating stylistic elements while achieving a hyperrealism with 
Russell Means's sharp black-and-white cinematography and Henry 
Mancini's Latino/jazz/rock 'n' roll score. 
Welles disliked Universal's editing, and in 1998 a restoration meticulously 
made from his notes was released. A few minutes longer, its most 
satisfying alterations are the removal of credits over the famous opening 
sequence and more intricate cutting between Susan's motel ordeal and 
Vargas's disturbing journey with Quinlan. Whether the before or after 
version, Touch of Evil endures as a superbly kinky masterpiece of 
technique, imagination, and audacity.  AE

Gigi  Vincente Minnelli, 1958
Finally breaking the record number of Academy Awards won by Gone 
with the Wind (1939), Vincente Minnelli's scrumptious MGM musical took 
home nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Director. Based on Colette's 
short story of a petite Parisienne groomed by her grandmother and 
great aunt to be a courtesan in the family tradition, Gigi was created for 
the screen with a witty songbook commissioned from Alan Jay Lerner 
and Frederick Loewe. Favorites include "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" 
and "I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore" (both sung by the ultimate 
boulevardier, Maurice Chevalier, in a career rebirth), and the droll 
Chevalier-Hermione Gingold duet shakily recollecting a long-ago 
liaison, "I Remember it Well."
Leslie Caron is a perfect delight as the coltish child, suffering lessons 
in etiquette, coquetry, seduction, and gem valuation before her sudden, 
inevitable transformation into a poised and desirable young woman. 
Louis Jordan is just divine as the bored man-about-town tunefully 
perplexed by the depth of his feelings for her. Fin de siècle Paris never 
looked lovelier (authentic locations include the Bois de Boulogne, 
the Tuileries, and swank mecca Maxim's), and Cecil Beaton's costumes 
rival his work on Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady (1964). Gigi is 
forever charming.  AE
The Defiant Ones  Stanley Kramer, 1958
A self-avowed "message" picture, Stanley Kramer's The Defiant Ones 
deploys a potent symbol of American race relations: two convicts, one 
white and one black (Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier), are chained 
together when the truck taking them to prison turns over. Both men 
harbor racist feelings, and at first they want only to separate—but, 
appropriately enough in this allegory of American history, they cannot. 
Their unavoidable closeness makes them reach beyond stereotypes and 
angry words to get to know each other as individuals.
A robbery to get food goes wrong, and the pair, much to the white 
man's chagrin, are pursued by a mob eager to lynch them both. Arriving 
at a farmhouse presided over by a lonely white woman, they finally get 
the means to break the chain. Yet they do not then go their own ways, 
even though the white woman tries to separate them. A final dash for 
freedom through a swamp and then onto a freight train fails, and the 
men are recaptured.
Fine acting from both Curtis and Poitier gives life and intellectual 
force to the narrative, which could easily have descended into ineffective 
melodrama. The Defiant Ones is perhaps the film that best captures the 
agenda of "realist" liberals in the 1950s, as American society attempted 
to come to terms with the fact of the African-American presence.  BP

After making a series of exemplary Westerns starring James Stewart 
during the 1950s, Anthony Mann cast an aging Gary Cooper as a man 
forced to confront a past which he thought he had left behind him. 
As is usual in Mann's Westerns, personal history exerts a grip on the 
characters that only death can loosen. Cooper plays Link Jones, an 
apparently respectable citizen on his way to hire a schoolteacher for his 
town. After the train he's traveling on is robbed, Link finds himself 
marooned in the middle of nowhere with a saloon girl named Billie (Julie 
London), and in desperation he decides to seek help from some former 
associates nearby. But Link is revealed to have a criminal past, and 
his one-time friends are a gang of menacing grotesques, played by 
Western stalwarts Royal Dano, Robert Wilke, and John Dehner. It soon 
becomes evident that there are scores to be settled, and the gang tries 
to force Link to help them with a robbery, threatening Billie with rape. 
Their behavior in turn calls up a murderous rage in the hitherto mild-
mannered Link, who hands out a brutal beating to one of the gang.
The leader of the gang is Dock Tobin (a barn-storming performance 
by Lee J. Cobb). In Mann's Westerns, family ties always prove stronger 
than any sense of the wider community, and Tobin's gang functions as 
a monstrous parody of kith and kin. Dock indeed regards Link as a 
surrogate son. In the final confrontation, beautifully staged by Mann 
in an old ghost town, Dock, having finally raped Billie as a direct 
provocation, incites Link into what amounts to an act of parricide. In 
finally laying to rest the threat of his menacing "father," however, Link 
reveals in himself a savage violence only barely under control.
Unusually for a Mann Western, a lot of the action takes place in dark 
and gloomy interiors, as the tensions between Link and the gang play 
out. But Mann's camerawork is as assured as ever. Make sure you see this 
film in the full CinemaScope ratio!  EB

Vertigo  Alfred Hitchcock, 1958
Although director Alfred Hitchcock was then at the height of his critical 
success and commercial fame, Vertigo was not a well-liked film at the 
time of its release. Most criticism focused on the intricate and unlikely 
plot dependent on a fiendishly implausible murder scheme on the part 
of a thinly characterized villain, whose exposure is about as much of a 
surprise as the ending of your average Scooby-Doo episode. The climax 
is so concerned with something else that the killer seems to get away 
with it—though Hitchcock shot an unnecessary tag, in the spirit of his 
TV narrations, to reveal that he was brought to justice. Closer to the 
mark, there was a genuine feeling of discomfort at the nasty little 
relationship between Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak around which the 
film turns. But during a lengthy period in which Vertigo was unavailable 
for copyright reasons, the film was critically reassessed. Now it is held to 
be one of the Master's greatest works.
John "Scottie" Ferguson (Stewart) is a San Francisco cop who quits 
the force after a prologue in which his fear of heights prevents him saving 
the life of a colleague. Working casually as a private eye, he is hired by 
old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) to tail his wife Madeleine (Novak), 
an icy blonde in a severe suit who is apparently obsessed with a look-
alike ancestress who drowned in the nineteenth century. The first half of 
the film is almost a ghost story, as Scottie is drawn to the neurotic 
Madeleine, with the suggestion that her reincarnation is ironically going 
to lead to her death. Here, you get the Hitchcock who was a master of 
atmosphere as well as suspense, and a genuine evocation of the unearthly. 
After Madeleine's fatal plunge from a bell tower, the film changes tack and 
becomes more intense, with Scottie going even further beyond Stewart's 
aw-shucks mannerisms into mania as he comes across Judy Barton (Novak 
again), a brassy, brunette shopgirl who resembles the lost Madeleine, and 
enters into a relationship with her. Few mainstream Hollywood movies 
dare to be as unsettling as Vertigo is in the scenes where Scottie tries to 
force a new reincarnation of his lost love by manipulating the new girl 
as she is transformed by a new hairstyle and wardrobe into the elusive 
Madeleine. For many, the scene in which Judy is finally transformed and 
embraces Scottie with a vampirish hunger is as emotionally devastating 
as the shower scene in Psycho is physically shocking.
Like several other Hitchcock greats (Rear Window [1954], North by 
Northwest [1959], Psycho [1960]), Vertigo has been endlessly imitated, 
homaged, and reworked. Movies like Brian De Palma's Obsession (1976) 
are feature-length footnotes to the original. Technical tricks—the 
simultaneous zoom-in and track-back used to convey Stewart's vertigo—
have been added to the repertoire (Steven Spielberg used it in Jaws 
[1975]). In all, Vertigo is a gorgeous, disturbing, icily romantic film, with 
steel gray Technicolor images, evocative moments of close-up surrealism, 
and an insistent, probing Bernard Herrmann score.  KN

For a few years at the end the 1950s, after Italian Neorealism waned and 
before the French New Wave rolled in, Polish cinema was the art cinema. 
With their complex, often ambiguous tales of wartime solidarity, sacrifice, 
and commitment, the Poles offered the most cogent example yet of 
socialism with a human face. Films by Aleksandr Ford, Andrzej Munk, Jerzy 
Kawalerowicz, and others won a slew of festival prizes and attracted 
international audiences. Perhaps the finest of all the Polish films of this era, 
the one that came to stand for an emerging generation of East European 
artists and intellectuals, was Andrzej Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds.
Based on the controversial novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski, Wajda's 
masterpiece unspools on the last day of World War II. The enemy has 
surrendered, but the winners aren't sure what they've won: both 
Communists and Nationalists can already sense that their fragile wartime 
alliance is unraveling. Enter Maciek (Zbigniew Cybulski), a young hothead 
attached to the Nationalist underground in a provincial town; assigned 
to kill the recently arrived Communist district leader, he holes up in a 
hotel for the night. But this is just about the first night of peace that 
Maciek has known in his adult life, and he's eager to see what else life 
might offer. He meets and falls for a pretty young woman, and his 
attention to her threatens to get in the way of his mission.
Throughout Ashes and Diamonds, Wajda employs a looming deep 
focus, so that disparate characters as well as opposing political agendas 
take on equal weight in the frame. Yet the real show is Wajda's revelation 
of Polish actor Cybulski as Maciek. With his eyes perpetually hidden 
behind shades and his slightly gawky but endearing manner, Cybulski 
was hailed as the "James Dean of the East," the symbol for a generation 
that wanted to look past political labels to focus on an individual's human 
qualities. Within the space of a few shots, he can go from dementia to 
helplessness to anger; his final "death dance," with his chilling laughter 
as he staggers through a field after being fatally shot, is surely one of the 
most powerful—and often quoted—endings in film history.  RP

With the arrival of Cairo Station, it was as if cinema had been reborn. The 
product of a healthy tradition of Egyptian, Arab, and African 
filmmaking—though few movies produced in the region were ever seen 
outside of it—this new cinema had learned from Hollywood and Italian 
Neorealism to build a form of its own. It was filled with humor, wisdom, 
and anguish; paid attention to the minute details of everyday life of the 
city; portrayed the primal powers of lust and desire; and delved into 
classical and oriental iconography—all presented in a mix of fantasy 
and reality. Cairo Station is vivid and moving, precise in its portrayals, 
original both as the creation of a single individual and as the embodiment 
of a secular culture, one that is so close and yet so different to that 
of the West.
And who is responsible for it? Youssef Chahine, a "crazy" little guy 
filled with longing and despair. Bringing disturbing revelations about 
himself and life to the screen, he plays a crippled newspaper vendor 
named Kenaoui who bears an unrequited desire for a voluptuous 
lemonade seller (Hind Rostom). Although the plot components are 
simple enough, the world depicted here is both dangerous and complex. 
The way events turn out opens up dark abysses in the city's life, made 
the more unexpected by the initial friendly codes the film uses. Panned 
by Egyptian viewers upon its initial release, Cairo Station has justly been 
hailed as a masterpiece on its rediscovery.  J-MF

Jalsaghar  Satyajit Ray, 1958
The Music Room
Satyajit Ray is best known for his "Apu" trilogy, a set of three films that 
together chronicle the life of a poor Bengali villager from childhood 
through adulthood. These films introduced Indian art cinema to a 
world that previously was familiar only with the fantasy and spectacle 
of the Bollywood musical. Through them, Ray revealed a different India, 
the life of a traditional village, the ravages of famine and drought, and 
of poverty. Greatly influenced by Italian Neorealism, Ray's beautiful and 
moving pictures sought to explore moral and social injustices. 
Exquisitely shot in the countryside, they made every attempt to be 
authentic documents of Indian life. In The Music Room, however, Ray's 
style and intentions change. This moody, atmospheric, and elegiac film 
will be a great surprise to those expecting the Ray of the Apu trilogy 
and Distant Thunder (1973). With this tremendous tour de force, Ray 
transcends our typical notions of national cinema, particularly in the 
Third World context.
The Music Room tells the Chekhovian story of a fading lord, Huzur 
Roy, in the 1920s. The character is played with a sad-eyed gravity and 
impressive nobility by one of Ray's most beloved actors, Chhabi Biswas. 
Roy's power and fortune have slowly faded away to nothing, his palace 
is crumbling, his staff of servants has dwindled down, and he spends 
his days sitting on his roof in silent reveries of past glory looking out on 
a barren landscape. Mahim Ganguly (Gangapada Basu) is a money 
lender, one whose crass manners do not betray his rising power and 
status. Ganguly represents all that Roy has lost and threatens his very 
existence. When Ganguly announces that he is going to hold a concert, 
Roy decides that he will hold a concert on the same night, pitting the 
old and the new against one another for a final confrontation. Roy's 
opulent music room is his great love, and the film flashes back to earlier 
concerts held in the room in better times. This last concert will be his 
final grand gesture, although it will wipe out Roy's treasury completely. 
It is his chance to live as he was once accustomed to doing, and to keep 
his inevitable end at bay for one last night of music and beauty.
The film's atmosphere of decay and melancholy is almost 
intoxicating. We feel the end of Roy's world viscerally and yet, like him, 
wish impossibly that it will not end. The close observation and careful 
evocation of a time and place that characterized Ray's Neorealist films 
work well in this picture, but to more Expressionist ends. We see that 
the two remaining servants are losing their battle with the elements as 
plants and insects are taking over the palace. The bare plains over 
which Roy looks out mirror his creeping demise. Satyajit Ray is 
exploring new ideas and techniques in this film, and it is fascinating to 
watch his style expand. The Music Room is a sensual delight and an 
essential masterpiece of world cinema.  RH
"I am . . . interested in 
a way of life that 
is passing and the 
representatives of that 
way of life . . . There's a 
quality of pathos in that 
which interests me."
Satyajit Ray, 1982
Ray did not think that the film would 
be successful in foreign markets, but 
it proved a critical and financial hit.

In his first two features, The Big Day (1948) and Mr. Hulot's Holiday (1953), 
Jacques Tati lovingly celebrated the charms of the provincial, random, 
and dilapidated. In My Uncle, he directs his satire against the mania for 
mechanization that threatens those easygoing old ways of life.
Tati's perennial screen persona, the gangling, near-wordless 
Monsieur Hulot, lives in a rickety old quartier of Paris. Not far away live 
the Arpels, his sister and brother-in-law (Adrienne Servantie and Jean-
Pierre Zola), in a trendily ultramodern house packed with gadgets. 
Inevitably, most of these gadgets malfunction—especially when the 
well-meaning Hulot is around.
As always with Tati, the humor is almost entirely visual—and aural. 
Few comedians have made such creative use of the soundtrack, and the 
clickings, buzzings, hissings, and sputterings of the Arpels's assorted 
gizmos and of the machinery in the factory where Arpel ill-advisedly 
gives his brother-in-law a job, often reach a pitch of controlled lunacy. 
Tati takes mischievous delight in showing how automation, supposedly 
designed to improve the quality of life, works against comfort, relaxation, 
and pleasure. But the human element, represented by the walking 
disaster area that is Hulot, can never be excluded. There is a melancholy 
undertow to My Uncle—pneumatic drills rattle ominously over the 
credits—but a wistful optimism too.  PK

Gloriously shot in CinemaScope, Some Came Running is an exemplary 
Hollywood melodrama that ranks alongside Nic Ray's Bigger Than Life 
(1956) and the color features of Douglas Sirk in its dissection of small-
town American life. Frank Sinatra is sublime as the solitary, one-time 
novelist Dave Hirsh who, having been drunkenly put on a bus, along with 
party girl Ginny (Shirley MacLaine), returns home after years in the army. 
Dave's presence threatens to undermine his elder brother's position 
as a pillar of respectable society, particularly when he takes up with 
gambling drunk Bama (Dean Martin). As his sibling desperately attempts 
to reform him, Dave finds himself caught between the affections of Ginny 
and Gwen (Martha Hyer), a schoolteacher and ardent admirer of Dave's 
single published work, who is desperate to see him return to writing. 
Like Frankie Machine, Sinatra's character in The Man with the Golden 
Arm (1955), Dave is a good man challenged by forces that seek to lead him 
astray. The revelation of Bama's medical condition and the arrival of Ginny's 
violent ex both spell the worst for Dave, eroding any hope of redemption 
and creating a gulf between him and his one beacon of hope, Gwen.  IHS
Some Came Running  Vincente Minnelli, 1958

Dracula  Terence Fisher, 1958
Hammer Films's revision of Bram Stoker's famous novel is one of the great 
horror films. Director Terence Fisher, who combines a cutter's eye for bold 
contrast with a delight in the logical unfolding of space, demonstrates 
a complete mastery of melodramatic modes. He's aided by Jack Asher's 
vibrant cinematography, James Bernard's unabashedly lurid and exciting 
score, and two career-defining performances: Peter Cushing's intellectual, 
refined, and athletic Van Helsing and Christopher Lee's icy, imperious, 
handsome Count.
Like Hammer's previous film The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Dracula 
came as quite a shock to its first viewers and reviewers, and as late as the 
early 1970s, Hammer's emphasis on the physical aspects of horror was 
generally recognized both as a turning point in genre history and as the 
trademark of a legendary production company. Even today, sensitive 
viewers can appreciate the boldness with which Dracula oversteps the 
boundaries defined by earlier cinematic horrors. This is seen most 
clearly in Dracula's feral eyes and fangs, the blood welling up from the 
hearts of staked vampire women, and the unmistakable sexuality of the 
relationship between the vampire and his victims. At one point, Dracula 
enters his victim's bedroom and shuts the door on the camera, positioned 
in the corridor. The tactful and expected approach would have been 
to end the scene there, but Fisher cuts directly inside the room, as 
Dracula backs the young woman toward her bed. The cut itself conveys 
inexorability, violation, and dread.  CFu

1959
Down-on-their-luck jazz musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack 
Lemmon) witness the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre and flee Chicago 
with an all-girl band bound for Miami, posing as "Josephine" and 
"Daphne." Both are taken with Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), 
a vulnerable, boozy singer. But Daphne attracts the persistent attentions 
of lecherous playboy Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), and things get 
even more complicated when the very gangsters the boys want to avoid, 
Chicago mob boss Spats Columbo (George Raft) and his henchmen, 
arrive at the Florida hotel for a gangland summit.
This legendary drag comedy is sensationally funny, fizzing with 
cleverly crafted gags, breakneck timing, and terrific performances. The 
1950s top sex goddess at her most enchanting, Monroe's forlorn-funny 
turn, maddening though it was for her costars and director to capture, 
is mythic. Curtis's self-consciousness in drag gave him an aloof control 
that is in superb contrast to the uninhibited, priceless Lemmon.
Some Like It Hot was independently produced and directed by Billy 
Wilder in his second screenwriting collaboration with I.A.L. "Iz" Diamond, 
and was sparked by the German farce Fanfaren der Liebe (1951), in which 
two unemployed musicians join an all-girl band, take a train journey, and 
go in for some quick-change romancing with the band's singer. Wilder 
didn't want his two heroes to be camp; they had to be heatedly 
heterosexual so that their escapade aboard the train surrounded by 
temptation was comically excruciating. Therefore, they had to have a 
desperately good reason to masquerade as women. Running for their 
lives from ruthless killers provided strong motivation. And although the 
gangsters have their own good jokes, they are effectively played straight 
for a note of delicious menace, with Wilder's neat noir touch of shooting 
Raft's key entrances from his distinctive footwear up.
The film's famous last line was written the night before shooting 
finished by Diamond, who insisted to the dubious Wilder that it was 
funny because it's so unexpected; the last reaction the audience expects 
to Jerry's revelation "I'm a MAN!" is Osgood's philosophical shrug, 
"Nobody's perfect." The other most fondly recalled moment is Daphne's 
engagement announcement. Lemmon shaking his maracas in absurd 
ecstasy is a masterpiece of comic timing, Wilder insisting on joyous fits 
of gourd rattling to leave space for audience laughter between lines. He 
also overrode objections to filming in black-and-white, not only to 
enhance the period setting but, shrewdly, to mute the men's makeup. 
Their transformation is startlingly amusing, but imagined in Technicolor 
it would be too grotesque. Industry mavens predicted the film would be 
a disaster because it broke several traditional rules of film comedy (the 
story springs from a grisly mass murder, the script was only half-written 
when shooting began, and the picture runs two hours, to cite a few), but 
audiences went crazy and still do.  AE

Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining film, North by Northwest is pure 
funhouse: mistaken for a spy and suspected for the murder of a U.N. 
diplomat, Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant, armed only with vast stores of 
charm and witty rejoinders) flees across the country, pursued by villains 
(led by James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau) and shadowed by 
government agents. Somewhere in between is the stunningly beautiful 
and shamelessly sensual Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose allegiances 
wobble warily between the twin poles of good guys and bad guys.
Working from one of the all-time great scripts by Ernest Lehman, 
and featuring several of cinema's greatest action sequences—the crop 
duster attack, the chase across the face(s) of Mount Rushmore—
Hitchcock ended his golden period on the highest of notes with North 
by Northwest. Even the title sequences, designed by Saul Bass, are 
memorable, and Bernard Herrmann's score is equal to his iconic themes 
from Psycho (1960) and Vertigo (1958).
Saint is one of Hitchcock's more vulnerable female leads, and from 
their first encounter it is clear that she and Grant are meant for each 
other. It's the perennial bachelor's ultimate trial by fire on the way to 
wedded bliss. Therefore, the question becomes not whether but how 
the pair ends up together. Grant is made to surmount various threats 
not just for his life but implicitly for his and Saint's future life together, 
and Hitchcock—ever the romantic sadist—has a hoot putting up 
the roadblocks.  JKl

1959
François Truffaut's debut feature, The 400 Blows earned the prize for Best 
Director at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1959. In an instant 
its young maker was on the map of international film culture—and 
smoothing the way for such New Wave colleagues as Jean-Luc Godard 
and Eric Rohmer, already immersed in cutting-edge projects of their own.
Like the other New Wave filmmakers, Truffaut cultivated his key ideas 
writing articles for Cahiers de Cinéma, the literate film magazine edited 
by André Bazin, who encouraged his critics to pursue their convictions 
often far from his own distinctive blend of aesthetic and philosophical 
concerns. Truffaut was the most aggressive writer of the group, fiercely 
criticizing French cinema's "tradition of quality" while formulating the 
politique des auteurs that saw strongly creative directors as the primary 
authors of their films.
The 400 Blows abounds with the spirit of personal filmmaking that 
Truffaut had celebrated as a critic. The hero, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre 
Léaud), is a thinly fictionalized version of the auteur himself, and Truffaut 
later revealed that he boosted the intensity of the fifteen-year-old actor's 
performance by joining him in a private conspiracy against the rest of the 
cast and crew. Master cinematographer Henri Decaë shot the picture in 
real Paris locations, and Truffaut never hesitated to stray from the story for 
moments of poignantly conveyed emotional detail. One such sequence 
comes when Antoine rides in an amusement-park centrifuge, twisting his 
body into wry contortions that express his rather weak impulse to rebel 
against society's constricting norms. Another comes at the end of the 
film, when Truffaut's camera escapes from a detention camp with Antoine, 
tracking on and on as he runs breathlessly toward nowhere, then zooming 
toward his face to capture a freeze-frame portrait of existential angst 
that is arguably the most powerful single moment in New Wave cinema.
Truffaut and Léaud continued Antoine's adventures in four more films, 
ending the series with Love on the Run in 1979, four years before Truffaut's 
untimely death. While these sequels have their charm, The 400 Blows 
remains unsurpassed as a distillation of the New Wave's most exuberant 
creative instincts.  DS

Pickpocket  Robert Bresson, 1959
Robert Bresson uses film to express the spiritual inferiority of life in a 
uniquely paradoxical way: by revealing the indescribable through an 
intense concentration on concrete images and sounds. Every detail and 
every nuance of the physical world is exposed by Bresson's intently 
focused camera. Eschewing traditional dramatization in the form of 
emoting actors, melodramatic situations, or intricate plots, Bresson 
allows the action to tell the story. Deadpan voice-over is used to 
nominally explain the motivations and feelings of characters. Bresson 
often used nonprofessional actors, whom he tellingly called "models," 
and directed them to strenuously avoid any theatricality and to simply 
move through his films. He uses music sparingly as well, allowing it be 
heard only during key moments of the story, to express something 
that cannot be verbally articulated. His films are pared down to their 
essential elements. This simplicity and lack of manipulation allow the 
audience a great deal of freedom to interpret the actions on screen, 
so viewer and character alike are involved in the same process of 
questioning and trying to understand the dilemmas posed by the 
picture in question.
Pickpocket is among the most perfect examples of Bresson's style. It 
tells the story of Michel (Martin LaSalle), a disaffected young intellectual 
who becomes obsessed with picking pockets. At first he sees it simply 
as a means to further his own ends, but he soon comes to view it as an 
end in itself and as a creative act. After an amateurish attempt at the 
crime, which gets him caught almost immediately, he apprentices 
himself to a professional thief to really learn the craft. The scenes of 
pickpocketing are breathtaking and rival any in cinema for their 
excitement and sheer cinematic virtuosity. Although Michel has contact 
with his sick mother and is involved with a girlfriend, Jeanne (Marika 
Green), the pickpocketing provides him with his most emotionally and 
sensually satisfying human connections. This becomes more and more 
obvious as Michel no longer steals for financial gain. He even seems 
indifferent about being caught by the end.
Although Bresson avoids the typical tools of drama, Pickpocket is 
completely engrossing and Michel's moral questioning and sense of 
displacement are deeply affecting. This is one of those pictures that 
completely changes one's understanding of what cinema is or can be. 
Bresson is one of the most novelistic of filmmakers, in that he is able to 
depict the inner world of characters and abstract philosophical concepts 
that are more easily expressed in language. His achievement here is all 
the more ingenious because he uses the literal quality of the cinema 
to achieve his ends, using and shaping the very specific material of 
the real world. Pickpocket expands the vocabulary of the movies. 
Watching a Bresson film is a demanding but extremely satisfying and 
enjoyable experience.  RH

cinema, as Dostoyevsky

In his first feature, Alain Resnais draws on the experience of his 
documentary short films. A Frenchwoman (Emmanuelle Riva) is having 
an affair with a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada) in Hiroshima, where she 
has come to shoot a film. Resnais uses documentary footage of the 1945 
nuclear attack on the city together with shots of the museum and the 
rebuilt city. (In fact the film began as a documentary about Hiroshima 
and the bomb, which Resnais then decided to turn into a feature.) These 
are interspersed with lyrical scenes of the couple's love affair. The 
juxtaposition of the tenderness of love and the horrors of war cause the 
woman to remember her own past in the French town of Nevers. During 
the war she had an affair with a German soldier and was planning to 
leave the town with him when, on the last day of fighting, he was killed. 
Sweet and painful memories of this episode in her life rise up with 
increasing intensity as her brief affair with the Japanese man takes its 
course. At the end of Hiroshima mon amour this affair will be concluded, 
each returning to their marriages.
The film was specially written for the screen by Marguerite Duras, 
who was an important influence on French cinema, later to become a 
director herself, and whose work shows a preoccupation with the idea 
of memory and the influence of the past on the present. Memory too is 
a constant theme in Resnais's work; one of his documentaries, about the 
French National Library, is entitled The Whole Memory of the World (1956). 
In Hiroshima mon amour, Resnais employs a complex flashback structure, 
which gradually reveals more and more of the past as it intrudes on 
the present. This structure is held together by the haunting score of 
Giovanni Fusco and Georges Delerue, and is given a powerful emotional 
charge by the acting, particularly of Riva, whose face registers the 
complex emotions of her character down to the tiniest nuance. Our 
identities, the film seems to say, depend on our memories, but ultimately 
these will fade.  EB

Ride Lonesome  Budd Boetticher, 1959
353
The seven Westerns Budd Boetticher made with leading man Randolph 
Scott are notable for Scott's wry, laconic, weather-beaten virtuousness; 
colorful secondary characters; visual gracefulness; stark, abstract landscapes; 
and a muted but aching sense of tragedy. If Ride Lonesome stands out in 
the series, it's because of the optimism of its ending, the easygoing 
interplay between Pernell Roberts and James Coburn as Boetticher's two 
most likable villains, and the perfection of Burt Kennedy's script.
Scott plays a bounty hunter with the fabulous name of Ben Brigade, 
who, after capturing a notorious killer—a memorably infantile James 
Best—takes him across open country to collect his reward. During his 
trek, Brigade acquires, against his will, three companions: a station 
master's sexy wife (Karen Steele) and the aforementioned pair of good 
badmen, who plan on robbing Brigade of his captive. The latter's outlaw 
brother (Lee Van Cleef), meanwhile, is in hot pursuit of the group.
The characters are locked in a pattern of competing or complementary 
goals—no one can make a move without someone else making a 
countermove—and all are aware that they are headed together toward a 
showdown. Boetticher, shooting in CinemaScope, does full justice both to 
the elegance of this scenario and to his protagonist's mythic solitude.  CFu
Orfeu negro  Marcel Camus, 1959
Black Orpheus
Marcel Camus's restaging of the myth of Orpheus in Rio de Janeiro during 
Carnival was the surprise winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes and later 
of the Academy Award for best foreign picture. Filmed using Neorealist 
techniques—an amateur cast and extensive location shooting in the 
teeming streets—it was highly praised for its vibrant depiction of Brazilian 
life and folklore. Black Orpheus was also championed as revolutionary for 
being one of the first international art films to have an entirely black cast. 
Adding to this acclaim and sense of authenticity is one of the movie's 
enduring charms: its glorious soundtrack composed by Luiz Bonfá and 
Antonio Carlos Jobim, two of the greatest composers of Afro-Brazilian 
sambas (Jobim wrote the 1967 song "The Girl from Ipanema").
Ironically, in Brazil the film is perennially criticized for exoticizing the 
country as an all-night dance party, populated by hot-blooded Latin 
caricatures. Although it is difficult to argue with these criticisms, which 
highlight many contemporary debates about visibility politics, the film is 
best appreciated on its own terms. Self-consciously a fable, Black Orpheus 
is beautifully shot and wonderfully played by Marpessa Dawn and Breno 
Mello. Camus's depiction of the River Styx and the Ferryman Charon as 
a night watchman at a government building, standing in a hallway with 
fluttering bits of paper blowing past his feet, is unforgettable.  RH

Ben-Hur  William Wyler, 1959
Based on a nineteenth-century novel by Civil War general Lew Wallace, 
William Wyler's Ben-Hur is the third and most famous version of a 
legendary tale of Christian forgiveness amid violent Roman times. It was 
the second adaptation of the story to be produced by MGM, who had 
bought the rights to the book in order to make a silent movie version in 
1925 (the makers of the first film, in 1907, were sued by Wallace's family 
after not seeking permission to use the story). It was also, in fact, the 
second version of Ben-Hur that Wyler worked on—he had been one of 
thirty Assistant Directors on the 1925 movie. 
Legendary for its exciting, action-packed, and myth-ridden chariot 
race, which cost one million dollars alone to devise, Ben-Hur featured 
350 speaking roles with over 50,000 extras. Nominated for twelve Oscars, 
it set a record by winning every nomination but one, a feat only equaled 
twice since—by James Cameron's Titanic in 1997 and Peter Jackson's 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003. The production's 
overt excesses incited some intellectual dismissiveness, such as Mort 
Sahl's four-word review, "Loved him, hated Hur." This was perhaps a 
comment on the commercialism of "Ben-His" and "Ben-Hers" towels 
available at the time of the film's release—one of the earliest instances 
of movie merchandising.
Ostensibly a film about Jesus Christ, the story actively centers on 
the friendship between Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Judah Ben-Hur 
(Charlton Heston), a young man whose life becomes a quest for revenge 
after being framed for an attempt on the life of a Roman governor. 
Condemned to the life of a galley slave, his mother and sister abducted, 
Ben-Hur seeks the death of Messala, who is by then an officer in 
the Roman legions. They have their duel in the infamous and truly 
dangerous chariot race where Ben-Hur wreaks vengeance on his old 
friend. In the end there were over forty different versions of the script; 
one of its many screenwriters was Gore Vidal, who insisted on a 
homosexual element between Messala and Ben-Hur. This can be seen 
in Boyd's performance if one looks for it; apparently the actor was 
told that Messala's relationship with Ben-Hur was mainly motivated by 
man-to-man love.
If Ben-Hur's movie message was love, its aim was money: MGM 
was in dire straits financially and the studio was hoping to replicate 
the commercial success of Paramount's 1956 Biblical epic, The Ten 
Commandments. Despite the film's gargantuan production problems 
(some of them simple oversights such as not agreeing what the 
hippodrome should look like or that a camera was too big for a ship) and 
a budget that had doubled from seven million dollars to fifteen million 
dollars by the time that shooting began, the film's enormous appeal 
guaranteed box-office success. This saved the studio from bankruptcy, 
making a matinee idol of Heston in the process.  KK

1959
Otto Preminger's 1959 film of the 1957 novel by Rober Traver (a pen 
name for Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker) was 
controversial in its day—making frank onscreen use of then-unheard 
words like "panties," "rape," and "spermatogenesis"—and remains a 
trenchant, bitter, tough, witty dissection of the American legal system.
From its striking Saul Bass title design (featured also on the poster) 
and jazzy Duke Ellington score, Anatomy of a Murder takes a sophisticated 
approach unusual for a Hollywood film of its vintage. Most radically, it 
refuses to show the murder or any of the private scenes recounted in 
court, leaving it up to us to decide along with the jury whether the 
grumpy and unconcerned Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) 
was or was not subject to an "irresistible impulse" tantamount to insanity 
when he shot dead Barney Quill, the bearlike bar owner alleged to have 
raped Manion's teasing trailer-trash wife Laura (Lee Remick in unfeasably 
tight trousers). Manion snags as his defense counsel Paul "Polly" Biegler 
(James Stewart), a former district attorney keen to get back into court 
to clash with the political dullard who replaced him in office, and Biegler 
calls on the skills of his snide secretary (Eve Arden) and boozy-but-
brilliant research partner (Arthur O'Connell). For the prosecution, the 
befuddled local DA hauls in Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a prissy 
legal eagle from the local big city whose sharp-suited, sly elegance 
makes an interesting clash with Biegler's aw-shucks "jimmystewartian" 
conniving. On the bench is a real-life courtroom giant: playing the judge 
is Joseph Welch, the attorney whose quiet persistence ("Have you no 
shame?") literally put an end to the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy.
Simply the best trial movie ever made, Anatomy of a Murder is far less 
contrived than the brilliant but stagey 12 Angry Men (1957), with a real 
understanding on the part of Stewart and Scott (both among the film's 
Oscar nominees) of the way lawyers have to be not only great actors but 
stars, assuming personalities that exaggerate their inner selves and 
weighing every outburst and objection for the effect it has on the poor 
saps in the jury box.  KN

John Cassavetes's exquisite and poignant first feature, shot in 16mm and 
subsequently blown up to 35mm, centers on two brothers and a sister 
living together in Manhattan. The oldest, a third-rate nightclub singer 
(Hugh Hurd), is visibly black, whereas the other two (Ben Carruthers and 
Lelia Goldoni) are sufficiently light skinned to pass for white. This is the 
only Cassavetes film made without a script in the usual sense of that 
term; he and Robert Alan Aurthur wrote most of it based on a workshop 
improvisation that was carried out under Cassavetes's supervision. 
Shadows is also the only one of Cassavetes's films that focuses mainly 
on young people, with the actors using their own first names to 
increase the feeling of intimacy. Rarely has so much warmth, delicacy, 
subtlety, and raw feeling emerged so naturally and beautifully from 
performances in an American film. This movie is contemporaneous with 
early masterpieces of the French New Wave such as Breathless and The 
400 Blows, and deserves to be ranked alongside them for the freshness 
and freedom of its vision. In its portrait of a now-vanished Manhattan 
during the beat period, it also serves as a poignant time capsule. A 
wonderful jazz score by Charles Mingus featuring alto saxophonist Shafi 
Hadi plays as essential a role in the film's emotional pitch. 
It's conceivable that Cassavetes made greater films, but, along with 
his final masterpiece, the 1984 film Love Streams—another picture 
focusing on the warmth and empathy between siblings—Shadows is the 
one to cherish.  JRos

Apur Sansar  Satyajit Ray, 1959
The World of Apu
The World of Apu completes the "Apu" trilogy that made Satyajit Ray's 
name and introduced Indian cinema to the world. With both his parents 
now dead, the adult Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) is living in shabby lodgings 
in Calcutta, trying to make his name as a writer. His friend Pulu (Swapan 
Mukherjee) invites him to his sister's wedding in a small Bengali village. 
But the festivities are blighted; the intended bridegroom proves to be 
mentally deficient. If the bride doesn't marry at the appointed hour, she 
will be utterly disgraced. Apu, protesting and bewildered, is pressed into 
service and takes his teenage bride back to his urban hovel. Against all 
the odds the marriage is a joyful success. After a year of happiness, 
Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) returns home to have her child. A message 
comes: She has died in childbirth. Shattered, Apu refuses even to see his 
son. Five years later Pulu finds him working in a remote coal mine and 
persuades him to come and take charge of the child, who has grown up 
wild and intractable. At first the boy savagely rejects this stranger posing 
as his father, but gradually a wary trust grows between them until Apu, 
his son riding on his shoulders, can start back for the city and the world.
This conclusion—Apu has symbolically returned to his native village 
and confronted his own childhood self—gives the whole trilogy the 
satisfying cyclical form of a myth. Each of the Apu films is structured 
around two deaths, although in The World of Apu the second death is 
that of Apu himself. He dies spiritually after losing Aparna, and only a 
chance event saves him from suicide; not until he reclaims his son is he 
reborn. The chosen instrument of his attempted suicide is a train; here, 
as throughout the trilogy, trains stand for the irresistible, impersonal 
forces that bring change, separation, and death.
At the heart of The World of Apu lies the brief marriage of Apu and 
Aparna. It is brief too in terms of screen time, running barely half an hour, 
yet it carries a powerful emotional and erotic impact. Not that Ray 
features any overt sexual contact; even had he wanted to, Indian moral 
conventions would have forbidden it. But he conveys a wealth of erotic 
revelation in moments like the one where Apu, waking in his formerly 
solitary bed and listening to Aparna cheerfully preparing breakfast, 
wonderingly discovers a hairpin on the pillow beside him. Ray draws 
from Chatterjee and Tagore, making their screen debuts, acting of 
astonishing depth and conviction; no wonder that both went on to 
become major stars of Indian cinema, as well as regular players in Ray's 
films. Tagore, enchantingly pretty as Aparna, was only fourteen at the 
time. Thanks to their performances, and the encompassing warmth and 
subtlety of Ray's direction, this rates as one of the most touching and 
intimate depictions of married love in all cinema. The World of Apu not 
only rounds off Ray's masterly trilogy, but encompasses a heartrending 
tale of love and loss.  PK

Fred Zinnemann's High Noon (1952) famously depicted one man's 
courageous stand against adversity in the name of the law. Howard 
Hawks's Rio Bravo, a response of sorts to High Noon, concerns another 
brave stand, also in the name of the law, but this time small-town sheriff 
John T. Chance (John Wayne) isn't alone. He's aided by the local drunk 
(Dean Martin), a gun-slinging young singing cowboy (Ricky Nelson), and 
a crippled old deputy nicknamed Stumpy (Walter Brennan). Together 
they must fend off a band of desperados who have laid siege to the 
town, intent on springing the villain's brother from jail.
Hawks was always one of Hollywood's most reliable and versatile 
directors, but after Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) he left America for a 
disappointing stint in Europe. Rio Bravo marked a rousing return to 
America and to form, with Hawks offering a genre-smashing collision of 
everything he knows best. There's a musical number—with Martin and 
Nelson in the film, how could there not be?— moments of comedy, a 
touch of romance, thanks to stranded traveler Angie Dickenson, and 
plenty of action, all unified by yet another casually iconic Wayne 
performance as the pragmatic hero bound by a sense of duty.
The siege-scenario Hawks sets up—a motley crew of mismatched 
characters hole up in one place for one last stand—has become a genre-
film standby, borrowed repeatedly by such Hawks worshippers as John 
Carpenter and George Romero. Both recognized how the limited setting 
of Rio Bravo could be applied to their own low-budget films. The Hawks 
touch is that the siege itself isn't as important as the interaction of the 
characters under siege. By sticking them all together in one place, Hawks 
has fun letting them play off of one another, revealing colorful little 
character traits as they fight back against insurmountable odds. Coming 
not long after John Ford's eulogy to the Western with his haunting The 
Searchers (1956), Rio Bravo also stands as one of the last of its kind, an 
old-fashioned and fun romp of a Western where the line between good 
guys and bad guys couldn't be more clear.  JKl

Yasujiro Ozu's second color film, exquisitely shot by Kenji Mizoguchi's 
favored cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, is a beautifully composed 
and staged late work, demonstrating the director's growing mastery of 
an expanded tonal palette. One of a series of explicit remakes Ozu 
undertook around this time, it concentrates on the activities of an 
itinerant acting troupe ("floating weeds") while maintaining the director's 
characteristic fascination with familial and generational interaction. In 
contrast to Ozu's 1934 film A Story of Floating Weeds, which was more 
comic and dramatic, this one has a decidedly autumnal, nostalgic, and 
philosophical air, a quality illustrated by many of its serenely staged 
compositions and "distilled" combinations of image and sound.
Although Ozu's films generally contain a surprisingly large number 
of shots and routinely experiment with the construction of cinematic 
space, the predominant impression one takes from Floating Weeds is of 
a series of interlocking still lifes, and a rhythm matched to the lulling 
repetition of everyday life. The film's opening shot—comparing and 
contrasting the volume, shape, and color of a bottle and a lighthouse—
suggests no further movement, the chugging beat of a boat's motor on 
the soundtrack reinforcing the "completeness" or "fullness" of the image 
on display. In these moments the film achieves a kind of stillness, a 
resigned, gestalt serenity that accompanies even Ozu's most tragic work, 
such as 1953's Tokyo Story.  AD

Much has been written about Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face—the 
only foray into the horror genre by the cofounder of the Paris 
Cinémathèque. While the film is justifiably celebrated as a masterpiece, 
connections are frequently made between its pulp fiction plot and the 
poetry of its cinematography—Jean Cocteau filming Edgar Allan Poe. 
The brilliant Doctor Génessier (Pierre Brasseur), experimenting with 
overcoming transplanted organ rejection, is dedicated to finding a young 
woman with a face to replace that of his daughter Christiane (Edith Scob), 
which was disfigured in a car accident he was responsible for.
Franju brings a sensitivity and complexity to the stock characters of 
the mad scientist and his assistant (here played by Alida Valli), not to 
mention his "monster"; he magnificently situates audience identification 
with the faceless Christiane early in the film. The first shot, of two 
headlights cutting through the dark French countryside, seen from inside 
the car, creates a masklike image echoing Christiane's expressionless 
mask. Our first encounter with the film is from within that mask, and 
when we finally see Christiane's face it is neither the plastic visage of her 
own mask nor (when it comes off) the out-of-focus exposed muscle 
which grabs our attention, but her eyes—which we've already seen 
through in that echoing first shot. This is what gives the film its meaning: 
we are the "monster" for whom Doctor Génessier commits his crimes.
Eyes Without a Face can be seen as Grand Guignol theater on the big 
screen: the film operates to give us an ever-increasing series of grotesque 
spectacles, beginning with Christiane's mask, a face being lifted from 
one young victim (among other medical horrors), the glimpses of 
Christiane's missing face, and finally to Doctor Génessier being torn apart 
by his own dogs. Franju here gives us a conflation of high and low cultural 
tastes, wherein we are shown beauty and poetry from inside the horror 
due to the director's refusal to exploit or turn away from the graphic 
images. If indeed we are the monster, the film seems to say, we would 
not necessarily see the events portrayed as horrific.  MK

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, British cinema turned to social realism, 
usually dealing with stirrings of rebelliousness or aspirations of betterment 
among clever, articulate, embittered working-class youngsters. Almost all 
of these films were taken from works by "angry young man" playwrights 
and novelists like John Osborne (Look Back in Anger [1958]), John Braine 
(Room at the Top [1959]), and Stan Barstow (A Kind of Loving [1962]). Alan 
Sillitoe's book Saturday Night and Sunday Morning became the best of 
these films, though the direction of Karel Reisz isn't free from a sort of 
sentimental inclination to the picturesque that often came about when 
Cambridge-educated filmmakers trekked to the North to make slag-
heaps look like alien landscapes and to spy on the strange behavior of 
pub-going factory workers in Nottingham.
The strength of the film is in Sillitoe's voice ("What I'm out for is a 
good time—all the rest is propaganda") and the delivery of his dialogue 
by Albert Finney, making a terrific first impression as Arthur Seaton, the 
grumbling, virile hedonist who bristles with indignation in the workplace 
and cuts loose in his off hours. The title implies the process of taming 
that has traditionally ground down Arthur's class, with the high-living of 
drunkenness and sexual excess on Saturday night paid for on Sunday 
morning with being coffined into a respectable marriage and a new home.
The film shows how Arthur's father (Frank Pettitt) has been reduced 
to staring at the television and how most of his slightly older friends 
(notably the one he cuckolds) are on their way to being trapped. Arthur 
comes out of a relationship with a married woman (Rachel Roberts) by 
being lured into an engagement with a pretty but conventional girl 
(Shirley Anne Field), but he is still resolving to keep throwing stones and 
breaking windows. Though, like many films in this cycle, Saturday Night 
and Sunday Morning tends to indulge in a proletarian machismo that 
verges on misogyny (for Arthur, all women are traps), Roberts—in a role 
similar to that taken by Simone Signoret in Room at the Top—expresses 
a real pain that provides an alternative reading of Arthur's rebellion.  KN

La dolce vita  Federico Fellini, 1960
An epic about triviality, Federico Fellini's portrait of a place and time 
captures perfectly the style and attitudes of Rome's fashionable party 
folk during the summer of 1959, all the while condemning them for 
being such gorgeous parasites. The enduring strength of La dolce vita 
comes from the tension between viciously attacking a world whose 
excesses are beyond satire and the fascination it can't help but feel for 
the mad parade of modern decadents.
Like A Clockwork Orange (1971), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Wall 
Street (1987), this is a film that paradoxically set as many fashion styles 
as it set out to demolish, encouraging people to sit about cafés on the 
Via Veneto in an unironic attempt to emulate the sweet life. The 
expression "paparazzi" comes from the film character of Paparazzo, who 
epitomizes the swarm of insectlike photojournalists found around every 
passing celebrity, snapping away and jostling for the best place and the 
most exploitable shot. The same camera horde who press around Marilyn 
Monroe-like American superstar Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) later, more 
disturbingly, snap away at an innocent housewife returning home. She 
is briefly flattered that they might think she is "some actress," only to learn 
that they are interested in her because her philospher husband Steiner 
(Alain Cuny) has shot their two children and himself.
Marcello Mastroianni, defining a generation of cool in his beetle-black 
sunglasses, is the character whose fall from at least potential grace we 
follow. Once he was a serious writer, but now he's a sleazy journalist who 
dances attendance on the pointlessly famous, gets no thrill at all from 
his various escapades and is always being humiliated as a hanger-on. 
La dolce vita is well remembered for the glorious image of Ekberg in the 
Trevi Fountain, but the scene is about the embarrassment, discomfort, 
and ultimate pain of Mastroianni's Marcello Rubini. He had scorned the 
star as "like a big doll" but becomes hopelessly smitten with her, joining 
her in the fountain against his better judgment to coo a wonderful Italian 
come-on speech ("You are the first woman on the first day of creation"). 
She doesn't understand, and his night ends getting sucker-punched by 
Sylvia's drunken actor lover (Lex Barker). Marcello's slide, which ends after 
the philosopher's shocking murder-suicide as he abandons all pretense 
at writing to become (shudder) a press agent, is prompted by ridiculous 
media farces, including a bogus miracle in the rain incited by cannily 
corrupt children, a ghost hunt at a haunted mansion (where Nico wears 
a medieval helmet), an attempted orgy that fizzles in unsettling references 
to Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) as a pinhead-like dancer wheels about 
while Marcello cruelly abuses and feathers a drunken girl singled out at 
random, and the dragging of a shark-ray monster from the seas. "By 1965, 
there'll be total depravity," muses a bystander, and the innocent smiling 
girl who represents a possible hope for Marcello can't make herself heard 
over the useless noise, leaving him sadly to join the doomed throng.  KN

Le trou  Jacques Becker, 1960
The Hole
The last film by the great and too-little-known director Jacques Becker, 
The Hole is based on a novel by José Giovanni, which recounts the true 
story of an attempted prison escape in which the author took part in 
1947. Becker wrote the script with Giovanni and cast the film with 
nonprofessional actors, one of whom, Jean Keraudy, played the same 
role in real life that he plays in the film.
Becker's use of nonprofessionals is one of the elements that heighten 
this extraordinary film's sense of absolute authenticity. Also crucial to our 
experience of The Hole is his control of film time. The scene in which the five 
cell mates smash through the stone floor of their cell is done in an unbroken 
take of almost four minutes, making us aware that we're watching people 
expend the exact amount of effort required to produce the effects on 
the stone that we see. By making us share a collective duration with the 
heroes, Becker involves us more intensely in their struggle.
Our involvement is heightened by our also sharing, uneasily and 
never completely, the point of view of Gaspard (Marc Michel), a prisoner 
transferred from another cell. His arrival forces the others to decide 
whether to give up their plan or take him into their confidence. Although 
they choose the latter course, Gaspard is never fully integrated into 
the group. The tension his presence creates provides The Hole's main 
psychological interest and, in the film's stunning conclusion, allows it to 
achieve a tragic dimension.
Becker uses Gaspard's isolation as a device to help us perceive and 
value the others' comradeship. The bonds between the original members 
of the team are proved and celebrated in appreciative looks and smiles 
at each step of the journey. In a rare moment when Gaspard seems at 
one with the group, he shares his rice cake with them. Long after most 
directors would fade out, Becker holds the camera on the wordless scene: 
an example of his career-long insistence on showing his characters existing 
outside the framework created by the direct concerns of the plot.
The Hole has been compared with Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped 
(1956) and Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion (1937), but Becker is less 
concerned than Bresson with transcendence or Renoir's critique of social 
differences. The prisoners' virtues—meticulousness, inventiveness, and 
the ability to form a collective—become the highest values of The Hole. 
Perhaps Becker is, of all directors, including even Howard Hawks, the one 
who has embodied and articulated these values most firmly.
Becker was in ill health throughout the production and editing of 
the film, and died leaving the sound mixing unfinished. The Hole was 
completed according to the director's wishes, but after its initial release 
in a 140-minute version, producer Serge Silberman had it reduced by about 
twenty-four minutes to enhance its commercial possibilities. The missing 
footage remains lost, but as it stands, The Hole is still a masterpiece.  CFu

A key transitional film in Luchino Visconti's shift away from his initial 
adherence to the principles of Neorealism (admittedly already diluted 
by an interest in tragedy verging on the melodramatic) toward the 
decoratively operatic excesses of much of his later work, Rocco and His 
Brothers also remains one of his best. Giuseppe Rotunno's black-and-
white camera work is tantalizingly pitched between grim, documentary-
style Neorealism and the stylization of film noir, with Nino Rota's score 
eloquently reflecting the emotional dynamics of the story about a family 
newly arrived in Milan from Sicily and falling apart as the influences of 
money, rootlessness, and sex work their destructive magic.
It is difficult, perhaps, to be convinced by the astonishingly beautiful 
Alain Delon as a boxer of such saintliness that he sacrifices his happiness 
in the forlorn hope of keeping the family united, and Katina Paxinou's 
clichéd histrionics as the long-suffering matriarch are a little hard to take; 
however, Renato Salvatori is convincing as the brutish and irresponsible 
elder brother ruined by greed and obsessive jealousy, and Annie 
Girardot is both sexy and remarkably persuasive as the emotionally 
complex girl who comes between Salvatori and Delon. The final 
moments of her martyrlike death may be over the top, but they are 
nevertheless effectively cathartic.  GA

L'avventura  Michelangelo Antonioni, 1960
The Adventure
At its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960, L'avventura was 
jeered at and booed by a predominantly hostile audience, though a 
large number of influential critics and filmmakers took the unprecedented 
step of signing a statement rejecting this reaction and hailing it as the 
most important film ever shown at the festival. Within two years, 
L'avventura was reckoned by the international critics' poll conducted by 
Britain's Sight & Sound magazine as the second greatest movie ever made. 
Although writer-director Michelangelo Antonioni had been making 
documentaries and features for nearly twenty years, this epic-length film 
was his major artistic and commercial breakthrough. Not least because it 
was his first proper collaboration with Monica Vitti, the actress who is the 
human and humane channel through which a listless, jaded, dehumanized 
society is viewed and who would become the focus of his subsequent 
films La notte (1961), L'eclisse (1962), and Il deserto rosso (1964).
L'avventura's premise is simple yet deeply unsettling: A small party of 
monied Roman characters take a cruise from Sicily and stop off at a 
desolate, rocky island to pass an idle afternoon that stretches into an ordeal 
when Anna (Lea Massari) disappears. The slightly vain, uncommitted girl 
has indicated to her more sensible friend Claudia (Vitti) that she knows 
something is not right between her and her architectural consultant lover 
Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and has attracted attention by pretending to 
sight a shark while swimming. Watching the film a second time, knowing 
that this major character will disappear after twenty-six minutes, we might 
notice that there really was a shark and that a small, never-mentioned boat 
can be glimpsed passing the island a short fade after our last look at Anna.
A major cause of initial audience befuddlement with L'avventura is 
that Antonioni never reveals what has happened to Anna. Claudia and 
Sandro are drawn together as they search, but none of the other 
characters seem that interested in the girl's fate. The plot, presumably 
by coincidence, rather parallels Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), with the jarring 
absence of the character we assumed to be the heroine in the second 
part of the film and an uneasy relationship growing between the missing 
woman's lover and a woman with an equal interest in her welfare. The 
subject matter also parallels the same year's La dolce vita. Anita Ekberg's 
starlet has an equivalent in L'avventura's flighty star-writer-whore (Dorothy 
De Poliolo), who is mobbed by "fans" early on when she (deliberately?) 
rips her tight skirt in public and pops up not so much to wreck the central 
couple's new relationship as to reveal it as a sham—but there is none of 
the ambiguous glamor of Fellini's film here. Like Marcello Mastroianni's 
writer who slides into the role of PR man, Ferzetti's architect-turned-rich-
man's-flunky epitomizes failed promise, and Antonioni can only find a 
trace of hope in an eternal feminine ideal who ultimately stands apart 
from the corruption of new money or too-casual sex.  KN

Michel, a petty thief who models himself on the Humphrey Bogart of 
Warners' 1930s gangster series, steals a car in Marseilles, but on his 
journey north is stopped by a policeman whom, in a moment's panic, he 
fatally shoots with the gun he finds in the car's glove compartment. He 
arrives in Paris and seeks help from his American girlfriend, a student 
and aspiring journalist. Ambivalent about his presence, she agrees to 
help. However, after discovering his crime and disappointed at his 
response to the news that he is the father to her unborn child, she 
betrays him to the authorities, then tells him what she has done. He 
attempts to flee, but is cornered by police. In one final mock-heroic salute 
to his movie idol, Michel is killed, gangster style, with gun in hand.
What remains of Breathless today, what speaks to a contemporary, 
young audience—when jump cuts figure in every other TV commercial, 
when its stars are long dead (Jean Seberg) or in their twilight career 
phase (Jean-Paul Belmondo), when "comedies of manners" pitting 
Americans against Europeans are commonplace, and when the mixture 
of a loose gangster-crime plot, a smart attitude, and a hip array of high 
and low culture citations are more likely to be attributed to Quentin 
Tarantino than his genuine predecessor, Jean-Luc Godard?
Surprisingly, from an artistic iconoclast whose evolution was so rapid 
and ambitious, Breathless is a modest debut by Godard. There is the 
semblance of a thriller plot, complete with betrayal, tailing cops, and a 
final shootout. There is a lovely but conventional film noir jazz score by 
Martial Solal. There is an insolent, mildly outrageous rap pouring from 
Belmondo's punk motormouth, but even that scarcely contradicts the 
Chandler-Hammet-Spillane tradition of hard-boiled talk.
But the subtle, formal pleasures of Breathless have yet to be fully 
appreciated. Whether through accident or design, Godard's low-budget, 
on-the-fly shooting style produced remarkable innovations. Eschewing 
direct sound recording and using total postsynchronization not only led 
to an Orson Welles-style speed and inventiveness in the dialogue delivery, 
it also paved the way for a radical sound mix in which one can no longer 
spot the difference between "real" sound happening within the story and 
sound imposed by the filmmaker. Likewise, filming indoors in close 
quarters led to a new form of cinematic contemplation: the "visual study," 
in which a sequence of just slightly different views offers a cubist mosaic 
of the many moods and aspects of these extraordinary star presences.
But it is as a modern love story that Breathless retains its immense appeal 
for members of Generation X and beyond. The children of existentialist 
reflection, postwar affluence, Beat culture cool, and pop culture flip, these 
antiheroes treat love as a game, and their own identities as makeshift 
masks. They are stranded between traditional values that they reject, and 
a future way of loving that has not yet materialized. Sound familiar?  AM

This epic's first director, Anthony Mann, was fired by star Kirk Douglas 
not long after shooting began, although some early scenes he shot in 
the desert remain in the final film. It fell to a pre-2001: A Space Odyssey 
(1968) Stanley Kubrick to bring Howard Fast's tale of a slave revolt in 
ancient Rome to life, and he rose to the task brilliantly, mixing scenes 
of the power struggle in the senate with ones of brotherhood between 
the slaves.
Spartacus (Douglas) is the slave at the center of the action, who 
inspires many like him to rise up against their oppressors, including 
young Antoninus (Tony Curtis), a favorite of Roman Marcus Crassus 
(Laurence Olivier) who is none too pleased when his pretty boy goes 
AWOL. When the film was restored three decades after it was made, a 
bath scene explaining more of the relationship between the master and 
slave, cut in 1960 because of its homosexual references, was edited in, 
with Anthony Hopkins rerecording the late Olivier's lost dialogue.
Kubrick stages the slave revolt and battle sequences brilliantly, but 
the biggest surprise from the director not known for his emotional 
scenes is the way he films the final, heart-wrenching moments as 
Spartacus's love Varinia (Jean Simmons) holds up their child for him to 
see as he dies, crucified alongside the men who followed him. Superb.  JB

The Apartment  Billy Wilder, 1960
Billy Wilder used to scratch American society where it itches. Inspired by 
David Lean's Brief Encounter (1945), he had to wait ten years for the 
necessary slackening of censorship before being able to tell the story of 
the "third" man, the one who lends his apartment to the adulterous 
couple. Surprisingly, despite its subject matter, The Apartment won no 
fewer than five Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Director), 
and is now considered by many to be Wilder's last truly "realist" film.
Some have criticized the amorality of Jack Lemmon's character 
C.C. Baxter, who gets promoted quickly only because he helps some of 
the executives at the big insurance company where he works in their 
efforts to cheat on their wives. But Lemmon—who used to play Wilder's 
Everyman characters—brings to the role here a solid touch of humanity, 
and Baxter finally appears as nothing more than a slavish clerk unwillingly 
trapped in a situation that already exists at the beginning of the film and 
is beyond his control. Despite its humor, The Apartment is indeed a severe 
social critique, as well as an examination of contemporary American life 
and sexual mores. It is also a strong attack on the basic corruption of the 
capitalist system, in which anyone with a little influence is capable of 
feeding off someone else.
The Apartment skillfully blends various genres, but, by and large, it 
begins as a satiric comedy, transforms into a powerful drama, and finishes 
as a romantic comedy. Meticulously constructed, the disillusioned 
screenplay by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond can in some ways be considered 
a kind of bitter follow-up to The Seven Year Itch (1955)—one that was 
beautifully shot in a rather gloomy black-and-white CinemaScope. After 
their summer vacations, when men had affairs in their wives' absence, 
they quickly quit their mistresses. Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) is one 
of these unfortunate girls, and she believes that love affairs are not just 
another species of consumer good. In the end, the bureaucrat is finally 
redeemed by love for this other lonely heart, although the film manages 
to avoid any syrupy feeling. Although Wilder apparently didn't think that 
MacLaine and Lemmon formed a great couple, viewers can legitimately 
hold the opposite opinion.  FL

From the point of view of a Westerner, the discovery of a film like 
The Housemaid, more than forty years after it was made, is a marvelous 
feeling—marvelous not just because one finds in writer-director 
Kim Ki-young a truly extraordinary image maker, but in his film such an 
utterly unpredictable work. Who knew that Luis Buñuel had a Korean 
brother! Kim Ki-young is a filmmaker capable of probing deep into the 
human mind, its desires and impulses, while paying sarcastic attention 
to the details, the bad taste of contemporary colors as secret codes of 
one's state of being.
What makes The Housemaid so shocking is the intensity of the passion 
that the music composer and his maid experience; the fully self-conscious 
mechanics of the love triangle existing between the husband, his wife, 
and his mistress; and the way this triangle can, at any moment, be 
disturbed, even exploded, by the unusual length of one of the director's 
shots, by his pop-art use of everyday objects, or by the invading presence 
of the human (feminine) body. But the shocking nature of the film is both 
disturbing and pleasurable, as the use of seemingly trivial musical notes 
and the surprising mixture of sentimentality and cruelty opens the door 
to new sensations for the viewer, all the more amazing coming from such 
an unexpected source.  J-MF

Meghe Dhaka Tara  Ritwik Ghatak, 1960
The Cloud-Capped Star
"Those who suffer for others suffer forever," remarks a character in this, 
Ritwik Ghatak's most famous film, a melodrama that comes close to 
tragedy. Its heroine's tragic flaw is the sin of omission: She fails to protest 
at injustice, injustice to herself and her dreams, and at the hands of those 
she loves most dearly. Nita (Supriya Choudhury) works night and day 
to keep her refugee Bengali family solvent. Her father is a teacher but 
earns a pittance. Her elder brother wants to be a singer, and claims 
the artist's right to time the rest of them can ill afford. Meanwhile her 
mother hopes the science student who is Nita's intended may transfer 
his affections to her sister.
The Cloud-Capped Star is a searing piece of work, resonant and 
beautifully composed—and it proved a rare commercial success for its 
director in India. For all its implicit criticism of the harsh social conditions 
the refugees live under, the film is less overtly political than Ghatak's 
subsequent work, notably Subarnarekha (1965) and A River Named 
Titash (1973). "I accuse—no one," says the old man limply in a key late 
scene. See it for the grace of Ghatak's mise-en-scène, his Expressionist 
sound design, and the enormous sense of loss.  TCh

Psycho  Alfred Hitchcock, 1960
One of the most famous movies of all time, and quite possibly the most 
influential horror film in history, Psycho traded the supernatural beings 
of the genre's past—vampires, werewolves, zombies, and the like—for 
an all-too-human monster. The film made "Norman Bates" a household 
name and guaranteed its director's status as the master of suspense.
Adapted by Joseph Stefano from a creepy but forgettable novel by 
Robert Bloch, who based the character of Norman on a real-life Wisconsin 
serial killer, Ed Gein, Psycho tells the story of Marion Crane, an attractive 
young woman who steals $40,000 from her place of work. She leaves 
town without a plan, except a vague desire to shack up with her married 
boyfriend. Driving all night in the rain, she finally stops at a roadside 
motel, where the manager is an awkward but nice-enough young man 
named Norman (played to quirky perfection by Anthony Perkins). In a 
shocking twist that had audiences at the time literally screaming in the 
aisles, Marion is stabbed to death while taking a shower that evening by 
what looks like an old lady with a foot-long carving knife. Shrieking 
violins on the soundtrack (composed by Hitchcock regular Bernard 
Herrmann) punctuate the terrifying attack. Never before had the central 
character of a commercial movie been killed off so brutally less than 
halfway through the film. After an insurance detective assigned to the 
case, Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), gets snuffed out as well, Marion's 
sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) track her 
to the Bates family home up the road from the motel. They discover that 
the killer is actually Norman, a homicidal, cross-dressing schizophrenic 
who makes himself up just like his dead mother whenever sexual or 
threatening feelings arise. Although a police-employed psychologist 
(Simon Oakland) "explains" the cause of Norman's illness at the film's end, 
there can be little doubt that whatever truly motivates him lies beyond 
the ability of rational minds to comprehend.
When Psycho first opened, it received mostly lukewarm reviews from 
critics—though better by a mile than the venom that greeted Michael 
Powell's eerily similar Peeping Tom, also released in 1960. Public reaction 
to the film was staggering, however, with people lining up around the 
block for tickets. Generating additional buzz was Hitchcock's newly 
initiated "special policy" of not allowing anyone to enter the theater 
after Psycho's opening credits had run. Clearly this British-born filmmaker 
had found a way of tapping directly into America's collective psyche: 
By making his monster so very normal, and by uniting sex, madness, and 
murder in one spooky and sordid tale, he effectively predicted the 
headlines of many of the coming decades' top news stories. The success 
of Psycho led to three forgettable "sequels," including one directed by 
Perkins himself in 1986 and Gus Van Sant's notorious "shot-for-shot" 
remake in 1998—a colorized experiment that nonetheless paled in 
comparison with Hitchcock's black-and-white original.  SJS

With his second feature, Shoot the Piano Player, François Truffaut set out 
to make a film as different as possible from his acclaimed debut, The 400 
Blows (1959). Where Blows was sensitive, realistic, and autobiographical 
in content, Piano Player is zany, irreverent, and set in a lovingly pastiched 
B-movie world of doom-laden losers and thick-eared hoods. "I wanted 
to break with linear narrative," Truffaut later explained, "and make a film 
where all the scenes would please me. I shot without any other criteria."
The plot, adapted from a pulp crime novel, is classic noir. The hero, a 
once-famous concert pianist (played with sad-eyed doggy charm by singer 
Charles Aznavour), abandoned his career on discovering how his wife 
had betrayed him and now plays piano in a tawdry Paris bar. Thanks to his 
roughneck brothers, he finds himself, and the waitress he loves, caught 
up in a farcically lethal affair of kidnappings and gunplay.
Because no funding was forthcoming for a studio production, Truffaut 
and his crew shot on the streets, often making up the script as they went 
along and deciding the ending on the basis of who was still available 
for the final showdown. This blithely haphazard approach paid off in 
unpredictable mood-switches and incongruous dialogue riffs, many of 
which anticipate Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). The heavies 
are played as comic-strip figures, and the hero's siblings bear names 
recalling the Marx Brothers: Chico, Momo, and Fido. Truffaut takes 
mischievous delight in playing all kinds of cinematic games: when a 
crook swears he's telling the truth "on my mother's life," we get a quick 
cut to an elderly lady keeling over with a heart attack, and a nonsense 
song sung in the bar punctuates the action ("Avanie et framboise sont 
les mamelles de la vie"—"Affront and raspberry are the breasts of life").
Piano Player scored a hit in cinephile circles, but the general public was 
baffled by the mix of genres and the picture was a commercial disaster. 
Shaken, Truffaut retreated back to more conventional narrative styles; 
never again would he let himself have quite so much fun with a film.  PK

The invasiveness of the camera is given a disturbing twist in Michael 
Powell's infamous, career-destroying Peeping Tom. A young man named 
Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) introduces himself to women as a documentary 
filmmaker. But attached to his camera is a metal spike with which he 
kills his subject as his films them. We learn this from the opening 
moments of Peeping Tom, as we witness a harrowing murder captured 
in the virtual crosshairs of a viewfinder.
There is no question that Mark is a monster, but Powell reveals bits 
and pieces of a troubled childhood that at least make him more 
sympathetic. His sadistic father tormented the boy while filming him for 
psychoanalytic experiments, shining lights in his eyes to rouse him from 
sleep, and dropping lizards into his bed. Later we see him posed with his 
dead mother, a film he combines with footage of his father's remarriage. 
For Mark, sex, death, love, and hate all bleed into one, and the camera is 
the one thing capable of capturing all those fleeting emotions. Only 
through the literal fusion of these feelings with his equipment is Mark 
able to reconcile the violent and conflicted impulses of his subconscious.
Perhaps it was its subject's ambiguous motives that turned off 
audiences, or maybe it was the fact that a director as beloved as Powell 
had turned his sights on such dark and surprising subject matter. But it 
just as easily could have been the film's subtle implication that the 
viewer, a fellow voyeur, is somehow complicit in Mark's murderous 
deeds, riveted by his perverse atrocities and to a degree enabling them.
Vitally, Powell presents this twisted tale with all the skill and craft 
he brought to his other more innocent movies. The colors of Peeping 
Tom are vibrant, often most so at the moments you wish they weren't. 
Even compared to the black and white of Alfred Hitchcock's somewhat 
likeminded shocker Psycho (also 1960), the vivid Peeping Tom comes 
across as more immediate and ultimately more frightening. We're 
shoved deep down into the recesses of a madman's brain, and Powell 
doesn't give us an easy way out.  JKl

1960

Filmed in Italy as La maschera del demonio, this was prepared for English-
language release as The Mask of Satan but wound up being released in 
a different form (with Robert Nicolosi's subtle score replaced by Les Baxter's 
jazzy bombast) in America as Black Sunday and, after a ban of some years 
and severe cuts, in the United Kingdom as Revenge of the Vampire.
Cinematographer Mario Bava had several times stepped in to 
complete the direction of films he was photographing, taking over both 
I Vampiri (1957) and Caltiki, the Immortal Monster (1959) from Riccardo 
Freda and doing major second-unit work on the enormously successful 
Steve Reeves Hercules films. Having won a shot at making his own 
picture, Bava turned to a Russian folk legend preserved in "The Vij," a 
story by Nikolai Gogol, and extrapolated a beguiling fairy tale about 
a young doctor (John Richardson) who finds himself stranded in a 
haunted Moldavian community in the nineteenth century and falls for 
heiress Katja Vajda (Barbara Steele), whose body becomes possessed by 
executed-for-witchcraft ancestress Asa (Steele again).
The plot is the usual mix of secret passages, family curses, and sudden 
deaths, but Bava crams every frame with fascinating, horrid detail. It 
opens with a marvelously grotesque execution as spiked demon masks 
are hammered onto the skulls of witches, and features many unforgettably 
eerie images as the vampires crawl from their graves to persecute the 
living. Beside the lavish monochrome images, the eerie music, and the 
touches of blood-spurting goo, The Mask of Satan is also your best chance 
to savor the unique screen presence of Steele, the most strangely sexual 
actress ever to star in a horror film. An unlikely graduate of the genteel 
Rank Charm School, a mix of finishing school and dramatic academy, the 
dark, huge-eyed Steele had found few roles suited to her startling looks 
in the British cinema and had to venture abroad. She soon became the 
reigning queen of 1960s Italian horror films before finding a niche 
parodying Sophia Loren for Federico Fellini in 8 ½ (1963). Under any of its 
titles, this is the greatest gothic horror movie ever made in Italy.  KN

Splendor in the Grass  Elia Kazan, 1961
From the first notes of David Amram's intense score and the opening 
image of Bud (first-timer Warren Beatty) and Deanie (Natalie Wood) 
kissing in a car by a raging waterfall, Splendor in the Grass sums up the 
appeal of Hollywood melodrama at its finest. The passions repressed by 
society (the setting is Kansas 1928) find a displaced expression in every 
explosive burst of color, sound, and gesture.
Repression is everywhere in this movie, a force that twists people 
in monstrous, dysfunctional directions. Men are obliged to be successful 
and macho, while women must choose between virginity and 
whorishness—as is the case for Bud's unconventional flapper sister, 
Ginny, indelibly incarnated by Barbara Loden.
Director Elia Kazan worked at the intersection of studio-nurtured 
classical narrative and the innovative, dynamic forms introduced by 
Method acting and the French New Wave. Here, collaborating with the 
dramatist William Inge, he achieved a sublime synthesis of both 
approaches. The film offers a lucid, concentrated analysis of the social 
contradictions determined by class, wealth, industry, church, and family. 
At the same time, Splendor in the Grass is a film in which the characters 
register as authentic individuals, acting and reacting in a register that is 
far from the Hollywood cliché.  AM
Viridiana  Luis Buñuel, 1961
In 1960 the new generation of Spanish filmmakers persuaded Luis 
Buñuel to work in his native Spain for the first time since his departure 
in 1936. The project he devised was an ironic drama. Viridiana (Silvia 
Pinal), on the eve of taking her final vows and entering a convent, 
visits her uncle (Fernando Rey), a rich landowner. Excited by her 
resemblance to his dead wife, he plots to rape her, but repents at the 
last moment. In his remorse he kills himself, leaving Viridiana as 
co-heir to his estates with his cynical natural son. Zealous in her 
efforts to better the world around her, Viridiana adopts a monstrous 
group of thieves, beggars, and whores. Inevitably her charity leads to 
disaster and her own undoing.
The Spanish authorities approved the script with few changes but 
had no opportunity to see the finished film before its competition in 
the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Despite its award of the Cannes Grand 
Prix, Viridiana was instantly (and for several years) banned in Spain: 
Having enhanced the script in his realization, Buñuel had evidently 
lost none of his ability to shock and offend bigots. Full of moments of 
surreal observation, the film remains one of Buñuel's most perfect 
expositions of the irredeemable follies of human nature and the 
irrepressible comedy of life.  DR

An experimental film couched in the trappings of science fiction ("remade" 
by Terry Gilliam in 1995 as Twelve Monkeys), Chris Marker's short work 
La jetée is the kind of deceptively simple project that grows in resonance 
and complexity as time goes on. Though the film is composed almost 
entirely of black-and-white still photos, Marker nonetheless infuses it 
with a thought-provoking narrative thrust, showing once and for all 
that moving pictures need not always actually move to move us.
Set in the near future after a nuclear apocalypse has sent any survivors 
scurrying underground for safety, La jetée is narrated by a man sent 
back in time to both discover and avert the cause of the devastating 
war. During his trips into the past he becomes obsessed with a violent 
image he recalls from his childhood—a man being shot—as well as a 
mysterious, beautiful woman. By the time he realizes the connection 
between the two it is too late, and history is doomed to repeat itself.
Marker's use of still images and spare bits of narration forces him to 
focus on sound design. The chatter of voices and strange noises 
replicates the hazy mechanics of time travel, here presented as a sort of 
metaphysical manipulation of memory and space. As the narrator's 
trips back through time progress, they also grow more lucid, leading 
to one of the film's most affecting moments. Picturing the beautiful 
woman asleep, Marker films her eyes flickering open, the one scene of 
La jetée that shows moving images.
This brief moment helps to illustrate the connection between the 
narrator and the woman, revealing why he would want to deviate from 
his compulsory mission and also setting the stage for the mind-bending 
(or is that time-bending?) twist at the film's conclusion. La jetée is short 
at twenty-five minutes, but Marker still manages to generate more of an 
impact than many films three times as long. That his intentionally cold 
montage achieves any sort of emotional resonance validates his creativity 
and ingenuity, and helps explain why such an unconventional cinematic 
work is revered as an influential science-fiction masterpiece.  JKl

Truman Capote, on whose novella Breakfast at Tiffany's is based, 
originally imagined Marilyn Monroe in the lead role of good-time girl 
Holly Golightly, but it's now hard to imagine anyone that could have 
suited the part better than Audrey Hepburn. Standing outside famous 
Manhattan jewelry store Tiffany's in the film's memorable opening scene, 
the actress never looked more beautifully luminous or enchanting.
In Capote's novel, Holly is clearly a call girl, but since Blake Edwards's 
movie version was made in 1961, when such matters gave censors 
nightmares, Hepburn's Holly is depicted as a bohemian gal living off the 
gifts of gentlemen. Sharing the same apartment building is struggling 
writer Paul (George Peppard), who himself is a kept man thanks to a 
wealthy benefactress (Patricia Neal) with whom he is having an affair. 
The delicate balance of both his and Holly's relationships are placed 
under threat, however, when Paul falls in love with his beautiful, if 
sometimes maddening, neighbor.
Audrey Hepburn, her hair swept back, dressed in a chic black dress, 
and carrying her elegant cigarette holder, provides an unforgettable image 
that hasn't faded over time. Add Henry Mancini's haunting score and 
classic cinematic moments (Hepburn singing "Moon River," or searching 
for her beloved Cat in the pouring New York rain) and you have one of 
Hollywood's most delightful and unforgettable romantic dramas.  JB

Exploited for years in Westerns as the white settler's foe, Native Americans 
had rarely been represented with any honesty in American cinema. Few 
attempts were made to explore Native American culture and traditions. 
Then came The Exiles, and its impact would ripple through the decades.
Kent MacKenzie would only complete two films, but The Exiles and 
the reputation that surrounded it cemented his position as a key director 
beyond the fringes of Hollywood. His film is a stark account of the lives 
of Native Americans living in Bunker Hill. That district of downtown Los 
Angeles became the locus for the many who had chosen to given up life 
in the confines of federally protected reservations, and it was where 
MacKenzie had been living for some time. His close companionship with 
his neighbors gave him access and permission to film their lives. Working 
with non-actors, MacKenzie tells the story of Yvonne (Yvonne Williams), her 
husband, Homer (Homer Nish), and Tommy (Tommy Reynolds), over the 
course of a night, offering an unvarnished portrait of his characters' lives. 
Unreleased theatrically until 2008, The Exiles nevertheless broke 
down barriers in the representation of Native Americans. It preceded 
the shift that Hollywood witnessed with films such as Soldier Blue (1970) 
and Little Big Man (1970), and is a precursor to more recent—and fairer—
representations of Native American life, such as Smoke Signals (1998).  IHS

Jacques Demy's magical first feature anticipates his two later 
masterpieces, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and The Young Girls of 
Rochefort (1967), not merely in its efforts to introduce an air of fairy-
tale romance into the banal world of an Atlantic port (in this case, his 
native Nantes) but also in its use of music and dance. While the latter 
elements are not yet constant in this film, they still inform plot, 
characterization, and mood, right from the opening sequence's use of 
Beethoven and Michel Legrand's jazz to accompany a white Cadillac's 
mysterious glide into town.
It would be wrong to write off as trivial the romantic roundelay that 
unravels around alluring but enigmatic cabaret-dancer and single mom 
Lola (Anouk Aimée), delaying a decision between several suitors while 
she awaits her long-gone true love's return from abroad. For all the 
breezy byplay, Raoul Coutard's elegantly circling camera work (the film 
is a delicious tribute to Max Ophüls), jaunty melodies, and far-fetched 
coincidences, Lola is imbued with a poignant awareness of the 
transience of happiness and the difficulties and unlikelihood of love. 
Formally, too, the film is more complex than it first appears, with most 
of the minor characters legible as telling variations on the central 
couple. Oh, and Anouk Aimée is unforgettable.  GA

Michelangelo Antonioni's follow-up to his groundbreaking L'avventura 
(1960) is the middle feature in a loose trilogy ending with L'eclisse (1962) 
that was made at the height of his intellectual prestige in the 
international film scene. Repeating many of the melancholic themes and 
stylistic moves of its predecessor, with particular emphasis on the 
boredom and atrophied emotions of the rich, La notte ends with a 
regretful recollection of former sexual desire. For better and for worse, 
the mainstream clichés that would circulate throughout the 1960s about 
Antonioni as a highbrow director making boring films about the bored 
rich stem largely from the excesses of this feature—despite the fact that 
it also showcases some of his most subtle and modulated work.
La notte's success as a structured and shapely narrative is somewhat 
more mixed than that of either L'avventura or L'eclisse, and the 
performances are generally better than those of the former and not as 
good as those in the latter. The minimal plot, restricted to less than 
twenty-four hours, involves the death of passion between a successful 
novelist, Giovanni Pontano (Marcello Mastroianni), and his frustrated 
wife, Lidia (Jeanne Moreau). The best parts of this film tend to cluster 
around the beginning and end, and include the novelist's brief encounter 
with a nymphomaniac patient at a hospital while visiting a dying friend 
(Bernhard Wicki) and his much longer encounter with the daughter 
(Monica Vitti) of an industrialist at a party, both of which foreground his 
shifting impulses and moods. Both these sequences show Antonioni's 
mise-en-scène at its most intricately plotted and emotionally subtle. By 
contrast, probably the weakest section is an extended walk taken by the 
wife around Milan, full of symbolic details meant to suggest her mental 
state, which arguably shows some of the ill effects that Ingmar Bergman 
had on certain filmmakers during the early 1960s. Yet whatever one's 
occasional misgivings, this feature comes from what is widely and 
justifiably considered to be Antonioni's richest period, and evidence of 
his stunning mastery is readily apparent throughout.  JRos

An early instance of the Shakespearean approach to teen drama, getting 
in on the act decades before it was trendy, this Oscar-winning filming 
of the Broadway musical hit relocates the story of Romeo and Juliet 
among New York street gangs, with the Capulets and the Montagues 
morphed into the Puerto Rican Sharks and the Polish Jets. Stolid director 
Robert Wise holds the fort in the nonmusical scenes, but the film really 
takes off in the musical numbers by allowing the unrestrained Jerome 
Robbins to choreograph dances like fights and fights like dances on 
mostly real locations.
West Side Story stumbles by casting charisma-free Richard Beymer in 
the lead (the Colonel wouldn't let Elvis play Tony) and can't exactly pass 
the winning Natalie Wood off as Puerto Rican, but the supporting cast 
are perfect: Russ Tamblyn as the leader of the Jets ("Little boy you're a 
man, little man you're a king"), George Chakiris as his Shark opposite 
number, and a show-stopping Rita Moreno as the best friend who takes 
the lead in "America." Each and every Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim 
number is a classic belter: "I Feel Pretty," "When You're a Jet," "Tonight," 
"Gee Officer Krupke," "Maria," "Stay Cool, Boy," and "Somewhere."  KN

The Hustler  Robert Rossen, 1961
In The Hustler, Paul Newman plays "Fast Eddie" Felson, a cocky pool shark 
who spends his time shuttling from pool hall to pool hall searching for 
a few suckers to scam. The vulturelike middleman George C. Scott sees 
promise in Eddie, and tries to teach him how keeping your cool is the 
key to winning, but Newman discovers the hard way that keeping your 
cool also means excluding everything and everybody from your life 
save the pool table and the man you're trying to beat.
The spectacular black-and-white widescreen shots of smoky pool 
halls aside, The Hustler is a movie about people, and as such it features 
an array of impressive acting. Along with Newman and Scott is a 
laconic Jackie Gleason and a sad-sack Piper Laurie, who plays Newman's 
doomed, alcoholic love interest (though "love" may be too strong a 
word to describe what they share). Robert Rossen's film remains one 
of the most remarkably bitter and cynical portrayals of human nature 
ever made, a cold-blooded depiction of a world where loyalty only 
lasts as long as a winning streak, and a victory isn't always distinguishable 
from a loss.  JKl
Jerry Lewis has never been one to be ignored. It may finally be time to 
admit that our movie-loving French friends know what they're talking 
about. Already one of the three or four most influential American screen 
comedians, Lewis's immense popularity as an actor did not adequately 
prepare the world for his talent as a director, or for the many glories of 
The Ladies Man. 
In The Ladies Man, Lewis demonstrates a mastery of mise-en-scène 
that has rarely been rivaled. Very few could arrange the elements of a 
film frame with such skill and pitch-perfect comic timing. The proof is 
in, most famously, the incredible scene in which the many denizens of 
the women-only rooming house wake up and perform their morning 
rituals. In one remarkable shot, we see young women in different rooms 
combing their hair, exercising, and playing the French horn(!)—all while 
the camera cranes through the famous cutaway "dollhouse" set. Their 
movements are syncopated to the music, and perfectly integrated into 
the lavish setting. The result is a cavalcade of comic 1960s femininity that 
unfolds in vivid colors and psychosexual madness. 
Add to this the fact that Lewis gives one of his wildest and weirdest 
performances, and that, as a director, he is willing to gleefully suspend 
reality at the drop of a hat—as in the famously bizarre "Spider Lady" 
sequence. The Ladies Man also features what is, for my money, cinema's 
finest "slow burn." The film is a high point not only in Jerry Lewis's comic 
style, but in the use of mise-en-scène in American motion pictures.  EdeS

The first film in what later became known as Bergman's chamber-trilogy 
on the silence of God (though the director himself has here and there 
advised against any such formal approach to the films in question), 
Through a Glass Darkly begins somewhat misleadingly with four 
people—Kårin (Harriet Andersson), her husband Martin (Max von 
Sydow), her father David (Gunnar Björnstrand), and her teenage brother 
Minus (Lars Passgård)—emerging from the sea, as if out of nowhere, in 
peals of laughter suggestive of happiness and a sense of togetherness. 
They are on vacation—indeed this is the first of Bergman's films to be 
set on the island of Fårö, which he later made his home—and as the 
sun sets the mood is one of relaxed enjoyment; only gradually do we 
learn of the despair, doubts, and divisions within the family, as the film 
advances inexorably toward its dark conclusion, exactly a day later.
In that time, Kårin will learn that the mental illness she has believed 
she was getting over has been found to be incurable; Martin will discover 
that all the love he feels for her cannot prevent her hallucinations; David 
will confess that he has tended to put his work (he's a successful writer) 
before his family, and that for all his efforts he cannot change; Minus, 
already in teenage turmoil, will be sucked in by Kårin's spiraling madness; 
and she, hoping that God will show himself and help them in their need, 
breaks down when He reveals his cold, stony face as that of a spider. This 
terrifying scene (we don't see the spider, only her distraught reaction to 
His imagined visitation) constitutes both the dramatic climax and the 
logical thematic conclusion of an immaculately wrought drama virtually 
unmatched even by Bergman's other films for its sheer intensity.
Influenced by Strindberg, Through a Glass Darkly—with its handful 
of characters, isolated setting, brief time span, and uncluttered visuals 
(apart from the characters, all we seem to see are their house, the sea, 
sky, rocky shore, and a wrecked boat in which Kårin first experiences her 
breakdown)—allows nothing to dilute the force of its emotional and 
philosophical thrust; no wonder Bergman saw it as the first of his films 
to pave the way toward the masterpiece that was Persona (1966).  GA

Anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin's Chronicle of 
a Summer is one of the most significant and quoted of all documentary 
films. Drawing on the traditions and techniques of several pioneers of 
the form—Dziga Vertov and Robert Flaherty—Rouch and Morin 
document the patterns and performances of everyday life in early 1960s 
Paris. Capitalizing on some of the key changes in 16mm filmmaking 
equipment and technique occurring at the time, the film demonstrates 
the nascent possibilities of an increasingly mobile and "objective" medium.
Although in some ways Chronicle of a Summer can be said to be 
observational in style, it constantly insists on interrogating its 
methodological and ethical approach. In this respect, the film extends 
Flaherty's practice—he insisted on showing his rushes to the Inuit 
subjects of Nanook of the North (1922)—by including a screening and 
critical discussion of the "finished" film within the film itself. And though 
Chronicle of a Summer "shows" us moments in the lives of its characters—
sometimes talking to Morin, at others just "being" for the camera—it also 
self-consciously stamps itself as an ethnographic or anthropological 
experiment incorporating the interactive responses of its subjects.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Chronicle of a Summer is less 
its ability to capture unmediated moments of reality, than its capacity 
to critically examine the mixture of reality and performance (and 
performance as reality) demanded by the presence of the camera. 
Unlike the documentaries of Frederick Wiseman, which painstakingly 
attempt to efface both the camera and the filmmaker, the presence of 
both in Rouch and Morin's film is constantly insisted upon. Thus, rather 
than being constructed as observers of everyday life, the camera and 
filmmaker are implicated in both its unfolding and its construction. 
Nevertheless, in the walk of concentration camp survivor Marcelline 
through the streets of Paris—accompanied by her explicitly "personal" 
commentary—one can glimpse the approaching "freedom" of the 
cinema verité form. This is a visionary work, both formative and already 
a critical exploration of the powers and techniques of "direct" cinema.  AD

1961
Last Year at Marienbad is a touchstone of modernist cinema in general, and 
of postwar French film in particular. It was instantly clear in 1961 that Alain 
Resnais's second feature—like his first, Hiroshima mon amour (1959)—
marked a radical departure from movies shaped by the long-dominant 
"tradition of quality." It wasn't just offbeat or eccentric; it mounted a full-
blooded assault on ingrained assumptions of narrative film, interrogating 
and subverting every aspect of "correct" moviemaking from temporal 
structure to photographic composition to character development.
Marienbad is not the brainchild of Resnais alone. Its greatness grows 
organically from the dreamish poetry of Alain Robbe-Grillet's exquisitely 
crafted screenplay and from Sacha Vierney's majestic widescreen 
cinematography. Looking deeper still, one should credit the insights of 
the critics of the French film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, developments 
in modernist painting, the Existentialist and Bergsonian strains of 
European philosophy, and other invigorating theoretical/cultural/
sociopolitical innovations of this hugely fertile period in French culture.
And then there is the extraordinary cast, with legendary Delphine 
Seyrig as the woman called A, inimitable Giorgio Albertazzi as the 
inscrutable stranger called X, and subtly expressive Sacha Pitoëff as M, 
the perplexed husband of the tale. Their quietly restrained passion suits 
the elegant atmospherics to perfection.
Still, to see Marienbad as fundamentally a Resnais movie is both to 
acknowledge its kinship with his other masterpieces and to recognize 
his overwhelming importance to progressive cinema. With characteristic 
modesty, he once called Marienbad a "crude and primitive . . . attempt" 
to capture "the complexity of thought and its mechanisms." He was 
wrong in his choice of adjectives, but right about everything else 
connected with this strange and stirring film. Nowhere else in cinema 
have the labyrinthine workings of consciousness and memory been 
evoked more forcefully or explored more resonantly.  DS

In 2004, director Peter Greenaway 
declared Marienbad to have been

"Most of what happens 
is in the characters'

memory of silent film 
was a big influence."

Cléo de 5 à 7  Agnès Varda, 1962
Cléo from 5 to 7
Precursor of the French New Wave with her debut feature La pointe 
courte (1956), in Cléo from 5 to 7 writer-director Agnès Varda focuses on 
a French singer (Corinne Marchand) awaiting the results of a vital 
medical examination. As the film's title indicates, Varda has chosen to 
show Cléo's anguish virtually in real time, thereby taking into account 
the emergence and development of the techniques of "direct cinema." 
The casualness of the narrative allows fiction to merge with documentary 
as the young woman wanders through the left bank of Paris, mostly 
around Montparnasse Station, followed by dazzling tracking shots. But 
Varda's realism is also capable of generating powerful emotion, showing 
in a crescendo the slow breakdown of her lead character's face.
To a certain extent, Cléo from 5 to 7 reflects the sociopolitical tensions 
of its time, with Cléo witnessing the aftermath of an attack in a bar and 
encountering a soldier on leave who is just about to go back to Algeria—
in a way, he too can be seen as condemned. On the anecdotal side, 
movie buffs will appreciate the combination of a short silent film-within-
the-film featuring Jean-Luc Godard with various famous actors, 
including Eddie Constantine, Anna Karina, and Yves Robert.  FL
Dog Star Man  Stan Brakhage, 1962
Arguably the most prolific and influential figure in all of American 
avant-garde cinema, Stan Brakhage made films so profoundly personal 
that viewing them is like plunging into the tumultuous processes of 
thought itself. His lifelong project was to rediscover the purity and 
intensity of perception that people possess until education and 
acculturation force our unfettered mental energies into a narrow range 
of socially approved patterns.
Dog Star Man is exemplary Brakhage in every way, from its revolutionary 
aesthetic strategies to its philosophical vision of an existential hero 
questing for the infinite possibilities of being through a physical, 
psychological, and spiritual journey into inner and outer space. The 
narrative line is minimal: a man (Brakhage) trudges up a mountainside 
with his dog. By contrast, the film's structure grows ever more complex, 
as five discrete sections weave an escalating number of superimposed 
images into a rapid-fire visual tapestry so intricate that an alternate, 
"unraveled" version, The Art of Vision, runs to about four-and-a-half hours.
The title Dog Star Man can be taken as a nickname for the protagonist, 
or as an invocation of archetypal entities—the biological, the 
cosmological, the human—that intertwine as inextricably in this 
extraordinary film as in the innermost recesses of consciousness and 
unconsciousness themselves.  DS

Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux  
My Life to Live  Jean-Luc Godard, 1962
An episodic account of the short life of a young prostitute, My Life To Live 
is the first of Jean-Luc Godard's mature masterpieces. Like much of his 
best work, it is both supremely analytical and supremely sensuous, 
achieving an austere, wintry beauty. My Life To Live's primary reference 
points are the rigorous spirituality of filmmakers Carl Theodor Dreyer 
and Robert Bresson, and the lost Eden of silent cinema. Both come 
together most strikingly when the heroine (Anna Karina) foresees her 
own martyrdom at a screening of Dreyer's silent classic, The Passion of 
Joan of Arc (1928).
The Dreyer excerpt is one of several semiautonomous texts (including 
a jukebox ballad, a primer on prostitution, a discussion with philosopher 
Brice Parain, and Poe's "The Oval Portrait") punctuating the film, which 
additionally is divided into twelve chapters and a series of distinct formal 
units inscribed by the camera. Arranged into overlapping but incongruent 
patterns, these elements open up the narrative to juxtaposed 
commentaries on such topics as mainstream film style, the burden of 
language, and Godard's relationship with his leading lady, whose face—
as riveting as those of the great silent stars—anchors My Life To Live's 
diverse strands without subsuming them into static harmony.  MR
Yasujiro Ozu's final film and only his second one in color (the other being 
Good Morning [1959]), An Autumn Afternoon is a marvelous testament to 
a career notable both for its idiosyncratic stylistic uniformity (after a few 
early movies, he stuck resolutely to quiet domestic dramas and comedies 
shot almost exclusively with a static camera positioned two or three feet 
above floor level) and for the extraordinary riches attained through such 
limited methods. He returned to the same themes—and indeed stories—
again and again, and this exquisitely poignant film is to all intents and 
purposes a remake of the 1949 film Late Spring, in which the director's 
favorite actor, Chishu Ryu, also played a widower trying to persuade the 
grown-up daughter who lives with him that she should get married.
The pair's mutual awareness that such a change would leave him 
lonely is counterbalanced by their love of one another, creating a 
dilemma for each that is both banal in its everyday universality and 
hugely significant for the individuals involved. Ozu negotiates this 
precarious balancing act with his customary mastery, exercising his 
unerring eye for the telling detail, leavening the proceedings with gentle 
humor, and using the palette of colors to maintain a beautifully 
becalmed mood of understated melancholy.  GA

391
"How have they made a movie of Lolita?" asked a teasing trailer for 
Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of Vladimir Nabokov's much-banned novel. 
Working from a Nabokov script, Kubrick slightly raised the age of Dolores 
"Lolita" Haze (Sue Lyon), from the book's twelve to somewhere around 
fourteen, but otherwise manages remarkably within the limits of 
censorship to deliver a picture exactly as erotic, absurd, obsessive, 
erudite, and low-comic as the book.
Shot in Britain, Kubrick's Lolita lacks the book's pre-road movie feel 
for America's tacky motels and roadside attractions but homes in on the 
characters, with James Mason giving a remarkable performance as the 
middle-aged academic Humbert Humbert, as ridiculously lusted after by 
Lo's leopard-print-clad mama (Shelley Winters) as he is ridiculously smitten 
with the underage temptress herself. Opening with the aftermath of an 
orgy and Humbert's murder of his pedophile rival, "genius" Clare Quilty 
(Peter Sellers), the film stretches from slapstick (struggling with a folding 
bed in a motel room) to tragedy (Humbert's affecting sobs as he realizes 
how incidental he has been to the girl's life). Mason's sly, careful, pointed 
presence is matched by Sellers in a succession of personae as a shape-
shifting Satan accompanied by Marianne Stone as his silent, Morticia-like 
muse, Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov).  KN

Heaven and Earth Magic  Harry Smith, 1962
Harry Smith is perhaps the least known major figure of American avant-
garde cinema. His films reflect a fascination with alchemy and the occult, 
as well as a technique of incorporating the rediscovery of the cultural 
debris of previous eras. On his death in 1991, Smith left behind an eclectic 
body of "work," the landmark The Anthology of American Folk Music and 
a small number of films, mostly incomplete. Heaven and Earth Magic, his 
magnum opus, was "completed," off and on, throughout the 1950s.
The film's narrative is deliberately oblique, and its mostly cut-out-
based animation predominantly "abstract" or symbolist in form. Heaven 
and Earth Magic does have a story of sorts. The spectator can grasp 
onto the graphic and associational links that exist between the objects 
and shapes that dance across the frame. In preparing his film, Smith 
attempted to short-circuit the processes of logic and explicit linearity, 
entering into the realm of the subconscious, automatic, and symbolic. 
Like Joseph Cornell, Smith is concerned with placing objects, images, 
and sounds in new contexts and associations. Heaven and Earth Magic 
resembles both the hypnotic, trancelike juxtaposition of image and 
sound in Rose Hobart (1936), and the intricate, hand-crafted, indirectly 
personal qualities of Cornell's display boxes. It is totally in keeping with 
Smith's own broader artistic practice. Incomplete, deeply idiosyncratic, 
rearranged from materials taken largely from an earlier period—a 
Victorian-era catalogue—it is explicitly "folk" in nature.  AD
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance  
John Ford, 1962
As if explaining away the beautiful evasions and downright lies of his 
earlier Westerns, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance finds John Ford 
concluding that if the legend is better than the truth, then you should 
"print the legend." Lawyer Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) poaches 
the credit for ridding the territory of a subhuman outlaw (Lee Marvin) 
and riding on to political success in the twentieth century while the real 
man who shot Liberty Valance (John Wayne) dies broke and drunk. 
There's further irony in that the ultimate Western hero is here a back 
shooter who plugs Liberty from the shadows while the supposedly 
unmanly politico stands suicidally out in the open playing it fair.
Shot in black and white on a soundstage to avoid the lyricism of 
Ford's Monument Valley epics, this revisits the cleaning-up-the-town 
theme of My Darling Clementine (1946) with a cynical insight into the 
whole process of civilizing the wilderness. Wayne, like Stewart too old 
for his role but nevertheless perfect, represents the cowboy heroism and 
integrity that Stewart's lawyer-teacher-congressman will whittle away 
as he comes to run the West.  KN

One of the greatest epics of all time, Lawrence of Arabia epitomizes all 
that motion pictures can be. Ambitious in every sense of the word, David 
Lean's Oscar-grabbing masterpiece, based loosely on the life of the 
eccentric British officer T.E. Lawrence and his campaign against the Turks 
in World War I, makes most movies pale in comparison and has served 
as an inspiration for countless filmmakers, most notably technical 
masters like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The latter eventually 
helped restore Lawrence of Arabia to its proper length and luster 
alongside fellow enthusiast Martin Scorsese. From Maurice Jarre's 
sweeping score to Robert Bolt's literary script to Freddie Young's 
gorgeous desert cinematography to the literal cast of thousands, the 
film deserves and demands to be seen and heard on the big screen.
Designed for 70mm projection, the format enhances the film's minute 
details, from star Peter O'Toole's piercing blue eyes to the sun beaming 
down on the constantly shifting sand. Lawrence of Arabia's famous 
images and set pieces, such as Omar Sharif's appearance out of a desert 
mirage, the famed cut from a lit match to the sunrise, and the mind-
boggling assault on Akaba, look spectacular and, indeed, unrepeatable. 
They were especially impressive for a picture made in the days before 
computer-generated special effects. Spielberg, for one, estimates the cost 
of making Lawrence of Arabia today at around $285 million, and he would 
know, but the truth of the matter is that no filmmaker would dare attempt 
to outdo Lean, a superb director and storyteller at the top of his game.
That substance runs parallel to the spectacle only enhances the 
stature of Lawrence of Arabia and the reputation of Lean. The follies of 
colonialism and the hypocrisies of war are cast into stark relief, as Colonel 
Lawrence lets the success of his Arab-fought campaign against the Turks 
go to his head. Yet his larger-than-life persona is cut down to size once 
he realizes that bloodlust has replaced honor and arrogance has replaced 
courage. It's a sad fall from grace shown with subtley, literacy, and 
craft—a true epic with the scope and scale of great literature.  JKl

1962
Harper Lee's beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of childhood in the 
Deep South during the Depression received a rare, superlative translation 
to the screen by the new, independent, and socially conscious production 
partnership of Alan J. Pakula, who produced, and Robert Mulligan, who 
directed this first of six films they made together in the 1960s. The 
adaptation was written by playwright Horton Foote, who won his first 
Academy Award for a screenplay that typified his feel for authentic rural 
Americana and real people.
Although the story is seen through the eyes of a little girl (whose 
adult viewpoint as narrator is voiced by Method luminary Kim Stanley), 
the film has a strong center in the Oscar-winning performance of Gregory 
Peck as the ne plus ultra of all the decent men he embodied, Atticus Finch. 
A widowed, kindly Alabama lawyer, Finch's passionate defense of a black 
man (Brock Peters) falsely accused of raping a white woman exposes 
Southern small-town bigotry at its worst and teaches his young children 
a painful lesson in moral courage. To Kill a Mockingbird is a model for 
literary adaptations, retaining seemingly inconsequential details along 
with major, heartbreaking, or deadly events—whether the children's 
games, a hungry farm boy drowning his dinner in syrup, Finch shooting 
a rabid dog, the lynch mob outside the jailhouse shamed to their senses 
by a child, or the black community tensely following the trial in the 
stifling balcony—as Mulligan brings his experience in live TV production 
to craft a discreetly atmospheric, intimate character drama.
The children are terrifically natural in important roles, particularly the 
ingenuous Scout Finch played by nine-year-old Alabaman Mary Badham 
(whose brother John, then at Yale, would go on to direct Saturday Night 
Fever [1977] and WarGames [1983]). To Kill a Mockingbird also boasts the 
feature debut of Robert Duvall as the children's elusive neighbor, 
bogeyman of their fantasies, and ultimately their savior, Boo Radley. Duvall 
would receive his own Academy Award twenty years later in another 
Oscar-winning screenplay by Foote, Tender Mercies. The melodious score 
by Elmer Bernstein is another asset in this tender, heartfelt film.  AE

O pagador de promessas  Anselmo Duarte, 1962
Keeper of Promises
395
Based on the play by Brazilian playwright Alfredo Dias Gomes, Keeper of 
Promises is a parable about unconditional faith in the face of adversity. 
The plot revolves around Zé do Burro (Leonardo Villar), a simple-minded 
farmer trying to fulfill a promise to a spirit he believes saved the life of 
his donkey. Zé and his wife Rosa (Glória Menezes) live on a farm about 
thirty miles from Salvador. In the context of Brazilian spirtuality, Salvador 
symbolizes a religious space where Catholic and African pagan rituals 
blend together into a positive whole.
After the donkey's miraculous recovery, Zé sets out on the pilgrimage 
carrying a huge cross on his back, which he wants to place inside the 
church of Saint Barbara. His wish clashes with the imperviousness of 
priest Olavo (Dionísio Azevedo), who bans him from the church. Zé's 
naïveté is further exploited by unscrupulous characters. So cruel is the 
portrayal of the human race in the film that it is easy to understand why 
Zé's best friend is a donkey.
Keeper of Promises is an indictment against the intolerance of the 
Catholic Church, and it has a tragic ending that is cruel, sad, and extremely 
beautiful. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy 
Awards, it won the Golden Palm at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival.  RDe
L'eclisse  Michelangelo Antonioni, 1962
The Eclipse
The conclusion of Michelangelo Antonioni's loose trilogy about modern 
life (preceded by L'avventura [1960] and La notte [1961]), The Eclipse is 
conceivably the greatest film of his career, but perhaps significantly it 
has the least consequential plot. A translator (Monica Vitti) recovering 
from an unhappy love affair links up with a stockbroker (Alain Delon) in 
Rome, though the stunning final sequence—perhaps Antonioni's most 
powerful accomplishment—does without these characters entirely. And 
because the two leads arguably give the most nuanced and charismatic 
performances of their careers here, the shock of losing them before the 
end of the picture is central to the film's devastating final effect.
Alternately an essay and a prose poem about the contemporary 
world in which the "love story" figures as one of many motifs, The Eclipse 
is remarkable both for its visual/atmospheric richness and its polyphonic 
and polyrhythmic mise-en-scène. Antonioni's handling of crowds at the 
Roman stock exchange is never less than amazing, recalling the use of 
deep focus in the early features of Orson Welles, where foreground and 
background details are brilliantly juxtaposed. But it is probably the final 
sequence, which depends on editing rather than mise-en-scène, that 
best sums up the hope and despair of the filmmaker's vision.  JRos

Mondo cane  Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, & 
A Dog's Life  Franco E. Prosperi, 1962
An immensely popular documentary that problematizes the boundaries 
separating fiction from nonfiction filmmaking practices, Mondo cane 
initiated its own subgenre of "mondo films" (or "shockumentaries"). It 
also created a wave of imitators and has proved formative for such diverse 
pop and pseudodocumentary traditions as "mockumentaries," "snuff" 
films, hard-core pornography, execution videos, and reality television.
Purporting to subscribe to the adage that "truth can be stranger than 
fiction," all the while betraying its own principles by presenting often 
misleading voice-over commentary and manipulated (if not wholly faked) 
footage, Gualtiero Jacopetti's sensationalist travelogue-cum-nature film 
set out to shock viewers with its exposé of bizarre cultural behavior.
A onetime journalist and war correspondent, Jacopetti was hired to 
write the voice-over narration for two compilation films of popular 
nightclub acts. This gave him the initial idea for Mondo cane; only his 
documentary would showcase all that was lurid and sensational by 
contemporary Western standards. Jacopetti traveled the world with his 
associates, collecting assorted footage of tribal ceremonies, extreme 
cruelty to animals, religious rituals involving cross-dressing and self-
flagellation, and environmental catastrophes. This more-or-less random 
material was then assembled into a 105-minute episodic whole, the 
various segments connected by the thinnest of associative links.
Along with its bloated orchestral score, the film's pretentious and 
heavily ironized voice-over became a key ingredient of the mondo cycle 
to follow. The privileged opening words of Mondo cane were both spoken 
and appeared as text on the screen: "All the scenes you will see in this 
film are true and are taken only from life. If often they are shocking, it is 
because there are many shocking things in this world. Besides, the duty 
of the chronicler is not to sweeten the truth but to report it objectively." 
Even if the scenes then presented were "true," in the sense of being 
detached and unbiased recordings of actual events—which they clearly 
are not; the only question concerns precisely which footage is real, which 
is reconstructed, and which is completely staged—Mondo cane still breaks 
its promise, as the film's reportage is anything but "objective." Besides 
dishing out the occasional piece of gross misinformation, Stefano Sibaldi's 
voice-over is haughty and condescending, and sometimes even takes 
on racist overtones.
Complicating any straightforwardly xenophobic reading of the film 
are its segments ridiculing Western cultural practices, like the tour with 
a gaggle of American senior citizens eager to waste their retirement 
savings on a Hawaiian vacation package. In this respect, Mondo cane's 
creators come across as equal-opportunity exploiters. By the end, and 
as the film's alternative title declares, it does seem like we are watching 
"a dog's life" ("mondo cane" translates as "world of dogs").  SJS

In Midnight in Paris (2010), Woody Allen has Luis Buñuel ask Owen 
Wilson's aspiring writer why the characters in his yet-to-be-made 
surrealist masterpiece cannot leave a room. It is a delicious moment, for 
it is the same enigma faced by anyone watching The Exterminating Angel.
One of Buñuel's most celebrated Mexican films, The Exterminating 
Angel appears to wear its political satire lightly, but beneath the banter, 
the director's sardonic hand delivers one of its most powerful blows. This 
group represents the hypocrites who believe they have raised themselves 
above the morass of the lower classes and beyond whatever judgment 
should be passed on them for their deeds. They are the Spanish elite, the 
supporters of Franco, whose duplicity Buñuel despised. 
The drama unfolds at speed. The wealthy arrive, twice, for we see 
them walk through the entrance from two different perspectives. Does 
this make it harder for them to leave? Then most of the staff resigns. Small 
details suggest the increasing oddness of the guests' predicament, even 
before finding themselves unable to leave the drawing room. The 
presence of animals suggests the primacy of the behavior that ensues, 
when the veneer of respectability evaporates and Buñuel's scalpel reveals 
the venality of these crude and selfish creatures.  IHS

She wore rings on every finger. She sang the song. She wore a mustache 
and a thug cap, and she loved two men—one French, the other 
German—as the war was coming. She would love many more men, 
before, after, and during that time, and bicycles were running fast on 
the curved roads of happiness. In the end there was death. Mr. Jules 
(Oskar Werner) and Mr. Jim (Henri Serre) opened the door to the magical 
summer of cinema's modernity, but they came from the summer of 
another modernity, one that occurred way back at the beginning of 
the twentieth century—when Henri-Pierre Roché lived this story and 
then wrote it as a diary. They opened the door, and Catherine (Jeanne 
Moreau) ran right through it, shining with grace and strength and faith 
in being human. She would win all the races on the bridge—even the 
one where the bridge ends in the middle. It would be a tragedy, but it 
was shown as slapstick.
Never see Jules and Jim in a dubbed version; François Truffaut's 
voice-over is the sound of a wind that caresses and makes one world 
disappear, and another world appear. The beauty of the black-and-
white CinemaScope is hardly large enough, delicate and nuanced 
enough, rooted in the origin and contemporary enough, contrasted 
enough to convey the vivid and subtle energy the film is made out of. 
Look at Moreau! Look how beautiful she is! Truffaut was in love with her 
(how could he not be?). Jules and Jim was created from this love—it 
would have been impossible to make this movie without the obvious 
happiness of the director filming his actress, the strength they gave to 
each other. A shadow of sadness can be felt each time she leaves the 
frame, a thrill of joy and desire each time she enters it again.
Cinema is essentially the art of recording—not only the recording 
of objects but also visual forms and sounds. It is also the recording of 
that distorted reality produced by experiencing powerful emotions. 
Jules and Jim records just such a distorted reality, and to an 
extraordinary extent. War was to come, and it would bring with it 
delusion and death. The film knew it, its black and white monochrome 
the colors of mourning. 
Jules and Jim was Truffaut's third film, still made in the original 
impulse of the New Wave. And yet, after the autobiographical and 
child-centered The 400 Blows (1959) and the avant-garde, virtuoso 
game of Shoot the Piano Player (1960), Jules and Jim signaled a more 
adult and middle-of-the-road effort without losing any of the young 
and disruptive energy of the revolution Truffaut and his accomplices 
had just launched in world cinema. And, at least during this brief 
moment, that is exactly what happened. Truffaut's third film kept alive 
a moment of turbulence that would never come again—a jump into 
the future, with love.  J-MF

The Manchurian Candidate  
John Frankenheimer, 1962
399
One of the strangest and most mercurial movies ever made in Hollywood, 
adapted from Richard Condon's novel, The Manchurian Candidate was 
originally released in 1962 and then unseen for years after its star, Frank 
Sinatra, purchased the rights in the 1970s and withdrew the film from 
circulation. A salad of mixed genres and emotional textures, this political 
thriller runs more than two hours and never flags for an instant. The film 
got the green light with the active encouragement of President John F. 
Kennedy, a fan of the novel and a friend of Sinatra. 
It's possibly the only commercial American film that deserves to be 
linked with the French New Wave. Early on, there's a virtuoso 360-degree 
shot around a lady's garden club meeting that gradually turns into a 
demonstration of brainwashing by Chinese communists. The politically 
incorrect audacity only expands from there, widening to include 
irreverent satire, ghoulish black humor, surrealist nonsense, and incest. 
Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey, both brilliantly cast as evil 
mother and masochistically subservient son, have never been better and 
Sinatra and Janet Leigh have never been used as weirdly. The talented 
secondary cast is never less than effective. It is a powerful film, alternately 
corrosive with dark humor, suspenseful, moving, and terrifying.  JRos
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? 
Robert Aldrich, 1962
An epic slice of Hollywood Grand Guignol, What Ever Happened to Baby 
Jane? considerably ups the grotesquerie of Sunset Boulevard (1950) as 
two aging grandes dames of the cinema tear each other to metaphoric 
shreds in a decaying movie-star mansion.
Based on a novel by Henry Farrell and directed with black glee by 
Robert Aldrich, the film is a remarkable vehicle for Joan Crawford, as the 
wheelchair-bound ex-1930s superstar at the mercy of her mad sister, 
and Bette Davis, in the title role as a middle-aged child star who insists 
on dressing in her old stage outfit, singing her one hit song ("I've Written 
a Letter to Daddy"), and dreaming of a big comeback. The plot is wound 
around the long-ago accident that crippled Blanche (Crawford) at 
the height of her fame and hinges on some genuinely unexpected 
revelations, but the nasty fun comes from the spectacle of these two 
screen queens—who evidently hated each other—pouring venom on 
one another. The supporting cast includes Davis's daughter Barbara 
(who later wrote a vicious biography about her mother, trying to 
degrade her) and the enormously creepy Victor Buono as an opportunist 
who takes the job as piano player for Jane's act. Best moment: Bette 
serving Joan a cooked rat under a platter for dinner.  KN

8 ½  Federico Fellini, 1963
Marcello Mastroianni with hat and cigar in a bathtub, immemorial white 
walls and the black line of a whip, impressive women and fantasies—
the images of Federico Fellini's 8½ remain, and the sounds as well (a pity 
for those who have never heard the film in its original, though so 
artificial, Italian). The picture stands as a testimony to an icon of the 
European Baroque at the midpoint of the twentieth century. It is also 
one of the most brilliant, imaginative, and funny movies of its time. 
But that's not all. A turning point in the career of one of the greatest 
filmmakers of his era, who succeeded in transforming a personal crisis 
into a work of art, Fellini here paved the road for such subsequent 
classics as Satyricon (1969), Roma (1972), Amarcord (1973), Casanova 
(1976), La città delle donne (1980), and E la nave va (1983).
After his first eight features, Fellini had received all the recognition a 
director could possibly wish for (including, beyond the success, awards, 
and critical acclaim, scandal and even excommunication for La dolce vita 
[1960]), paid tribute, and flew away from his masters (Rossellini, Visconti, 
and De Sica, among others). Somehow, though only forty-three years 
old, he had managed to achieve a completeness in his work. 8 ½ stands 
as the bridge between this early period of fulfillment and a new 
adventure—one which, though probably his most original and creative, 
turns out to be only the second of three (there is also a third, and 
wonderful, period of Fellini's late works).
But there is even more to 8 ½. The film represents a major step 
forward in cinema's march toward modernity, one of the most inventive 
constructions of a mirror reflection on the creative act itself. Its mental 
processes as well as its material, psychological, and libidinal obligations 
are enacted in a Pirandellian extravaganza to be cherished by anyone 
who cares about the exploration of artistic mechanisms and psychic 
labyrinths. But even this is not sufficient. Not beyond but inside all these 
good reasons to treasure 8 ½ lies the main one, which (it should be said) 
is also the most modest one.
This story about the anguish of a director having to make a film, 
about an artist having to make a work, about a man having to deal with 
women, about a human having to face life and death, is a very simple 
and touching tale. Through its inventive visions and disturbing situations, 
playing on the frontier between reality and dreams with humor and 
fear, it interrogates everyone's relationship with the world, with our 
parents, our children, the people we work with, the difficulties of 
getting old, or getting lost, or returning to childhood terrors. With its 
magnificent black-and-white look, its geometric and non-realistic 
framing, and its suggestive use of sounds and images, 8 ½ does not 
elaborate a thesis on the state of the art or engage in psychoanalytic 
investigation. Instead, it opens a window inside each and every one of 
us, artist or not, man or woman.  J-MF

The Birds stands out as an anomaly among Alfred Hitchcock's films for 
many reasons. For one, it's the closest the director ever came to a 
conventional horror movie. But it's also perhaps the most enigmatic of 
all his films. The Birds invites many interpretations, yet Hitchcock never 
tips his hand. If he intended any single specific meaning to be gleaned 
from it, he tantalizingly (and teasingly) presents few explanations for the 
terror that transpires. 
Tippi Hedren (hand-picked by Hitchcock as the latest in a long line 
of blonde leads) arrives in the small, sleepy coastal town of Bodega Bay, 
where she bumps into Rod Taylor at a pet store. After she later decides 
to drop by at his house to surprise him, she's attacked by a seagull, 
foreshadowing the fate of the entire town: With little warning, Bodega 
Bay comes under attack by flocks of frenzied birds. No explanation is ever 
given for the onslaught, and no one is safe. All the characters can do is 
board themselves up inside and wait out the mysterious, deadly invasion.
Hitchcock infamously nearly led Hedren to a nervous breakdown, his 
increasingly sadistic work ethic (perhaps misplaced aggression following 
the retirement of his favored star Grace Kelly) too intense for her to 
handle. In fact, coming after Psycho (1960), with its numerous references 
to "birds"—both the animal and the slang term for women)—The Birds 
(Hitchcock's third film based on a Daphne Du Maurier work) may have 
been intended as a vaguely misogynistic sexual allegory, with Taylor the 
sole male amid several women vying for his attention.
But again, the theme of the film remains oblique at best, with 
Hitchcock instead stressing the horror and horrific effects. The Birds 
features some pioneering uses of matte work, which, combined with a 
few mechanical birds and several of the real thing, makes each attack a 
harrowing experience. The tension is increased with the groundbreaking 
electronic score (overseen by Bernard Herrmann), a mix of strange 
sounds that often blurs ominously with the sounds of the cooing birds 
and the menacing flap of their wings.  JKl

Pasazerka  Witold Lesiewicz & Andrzej Munk, 1963
Passenger
403
Andrzej Munk's most famous film was also his last. The Polish director's 
death during the movie's production left Passenger unfinished; it was 
reconstructed in 1963 in the form of a speculation that compounds 
the questions Munk posed of his story and of his characters with 
questions about where he would have taken them had he survived. The 
interrogatory form proves apt for this stark and relentless work.
The central character, Liza (Aleksandra Slaska), recounts two versions 
of her past as an SS overseer at Auschwitz: in the first, sanitized version, 
which she gives her husband aboard a luxury liner on which she returns 
to Germany for the first time since the end of the war, Liza benevolently 
reunites two lovers among the prisoners but is powerless to intervene 
further in their destinies. In the second, more detailed version, which 
Liza remembers in solitude, her own motives are tangled and obscure, 
and her relationship with the female prisoner appears obsessive.
As much as for the psychological interest of this relationship, Passenger 
is extraordinary for its terrifying exactness of tone and for its indelible 
representation of brutalities enacted in the background, or on the 
periphery, of the main character's consciousness. This fragmentary film 
is no less painful and abrupt than Munk's short but brilliant career.  CFu

The Servant  Joseph Losey, 1963
As an expatriate American in Britain, Joseph Losey had always brought 
a cool, disenchanted eye to bear on the customs of his adopted country. 
But in The Servant, the first of his three collaborations with Harold 
Pinter, his gaze came still more sharply into focus. Pinter's script, 
typically elliptical and oblique, and Losey's crisp, astringent direction 
offer a sardonic analysis of class, sex, and power relationships in 1960s 
London. An effete, young, upper-class bachelor, Tony (James Fox in his 
first starring role), hires a manservant, Barrett (Dirk Bogarde), who 
gradually takes over his employer's life, undermines, and destroys him.
Bogarde, at last casting off the matinee-idol image that so long 
dogged him, gives one of his finest performances, his flickering, 
contemptuous smile and insinuating, off-Cockney accent embodying 
a whole history of festering class resentment. But Losey and Pinter 
create a sense of entrapment that extends to both men. Their roles 
may be gradually reversed, but they're still bound together in mutual 
exploitation—a feeling abetted by Douglas Slocombe's camera as it 
sinuously explores the claustrophobic spaces of the terraced house, 
turning it into an elegantly appointed cage and observing its residents 
from unsettling angles. Funny, sinister, and unnerving, The Servant still 
retains the power of unease.  PK

Originally intended as a comedy, Jack Smith's stunning Flaming Creatures 
paradoxically became the greatest scandal of an increasingly notorious 
underground cinema scene. The film's distinctive beauty is due largely 
to Smith's nimble use of the handheld camera. His unexpected framings 
yield dense images of fabrics, body parts, and heavily made-up faces. 
Shot on black-and-white film stock, Flaming Creatures is a gorgeous, 
flickering series of cloudy images, featuring Smith's friends in various 
forms of exotic, low-budget drag. Eschewing narrative continuity, the 
film instead presents a number of sequences and disconnected tableaux 
that recall the aesthetic indulgences of Josef von Sternberg and the exotic 
fantasy world of Smith's muse, the 1940s "Queen of Technicolor," Maria 
Montez. Beginning with a lengthy introduction to the creatures, the film 
moves on to a coy scene of flirtation and a hilarious, beautiful lipstick 
sequence. When the butch yet demure Francis Francine chases and begins 
to ravish the enticing Delicious Dolores (Sheila Bick), all the creatures join 
in and fall into rapture. Their frenzy is interrupted by the falling plaster 
caused by a seeming earthquake, which calms or kills them until Our Lady 
of the Docks (a mesmerizing Joel Markman) emerges from a coffin, breathes 
life into the creatures, and arouses them into a final, joyous dance.  MS

Forugh Farrokhzad's twenty-minute black-and-white documentary about 
a leper colony in northern Iran is one of the most powerful films to have 
come out of this country—the most poetic as well as the most radically 
humanist. Farrokhzad (1935-1967) is commonly regarded as the greatest 
Persian poet of the twentieth century, and one of her poems can be 
heard recited by the hero in Abbas Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us 
(1999), whose title is that of the poem. Her only film—which reflects the 
probable influence of silent Soviet cinema without being in any way 
obviously derivative of it—seamlessly adapts the techniques of poetry 
to its framing, editing, sound, and narration. The latter is split between 
two voices, male and female. The male voice, belonging to Ebrahim 
Golestan—the film's producer, Farrokhzad's lover, and a considerable 
filmmaker in his own right—is mainly objective and factual; the female 
voice is Farrokhzad's, offering a poetic and highly emotional reverie 
about her subject that incorporates passages from the Old Testament.
At once lyrical and extremely matter-of-fact, devoid of sentimentality 
or voyeurism yet profoundly humanist, The House Is Black offers a view 
of life in the colony—people eating, various medical treatments, children 
at school and at play—that is spiritual, unflinching, and beautiful in ways 
that have no apparent Western counterparts; it registers like a prayer.  JRos

This modern Western directed by Martin Ritt is set in the featureless 
landscape of West Texas. Paul Newman is Hud Bannon, who cares for 
little in life besides drinking and chasing women. His view of life is 
undiluted cynicism: "You take the sinners away from the saints, you're 
lucky to end up with Abraham Lincoln." Yet Hud is looked up to by 
Lonnie (Brandon De Wilde), his dead brother's son, who at seventeen 
admires his uncle's easy charm. There is bad blood between Hud and his 
father (Melvyn Douglas), a rancher of the old school. Hud wants to drill 
for oil, but his father refuses: "I don't want that kind of money." Their 
housekeeper is Alma (Patricia Neal), divorced and approaching middle 
age, but too much her own woman to accept Hud's advances.
When the father's precious herd of cattle is suspected of having foot-
and-mouth disease, Hud proposes selling them before the disease is 
confirmed. The old man won't hear of it, but the slaughter of the herd 
removes his will to live. By the end, Lonnie and Alma have gone too, 
leaving Hud to nurse his beer. It's a brilliantly acted film that catches

Il gattopardo  Luchino Visconti, 1963
The Leopard
A cult classic, Luchino Visconti's adaptation from the novel of Giuseppe 
Tomasi Di Lampedusa, set in Sicily in the 1860s, is a sumptuous fresco of 
a world that's active at twilight. It accounts for the major social changes 
in Italy after the Risorgimento movement through the story of the 
prince Fabrizio di Salina (Burt Lancaster). Trying to avoid a confrontation 
with Garibaldi's army, the aristocrat has to move, together with his 
family, to their retreat at Donnafugata. He is one of the few of his caste 
to understand that the world is irreversibly changing and is disposed 
to make a pact with the representatives of the bourgeoisie. Following 
his personal motto ("If we want everything to stay the same, everything 
must change"), he decides to marry his nephew, Tancredi Falconeri (Alain 
Delon), to the daughter of the local mayor. The alliance between "the 
Leopard" and "the Jackal" will be celebrated in the marriage scene, which 
covers the third part of the movie.
Brightly directed and photographed, this segment of the film is where 
the central metaphor comes to life. The amazing camera work of Giuseppe 
Rotunno provides an unforgettable sense of the palace's magnificence. 
Beyond the splendor of the settings and costumes, however, one can 
feel the imminence of extinction. By way of contrast, the camera's eye 
also makes us attend to the vitality and rudeness of the newly rich.
Tons of ink has been spilled analyzing the ideological and stylistic 
features of this masterpiece, one of the best adaptations in the history 
of cinema. Some critics have pointed out the autobiographical 
suggestions of The Leopard, as Visconti himself was an aristocrat who 
flirted with the Communist Party. The analogies between the author and 
main character can also be extended to a deeper, more psychological 
level; both men are obsessed with death and perceive its premonitory 
signs everywhere. Visconti would return to this theme in several of his 
subsequent pictures, including The Damned (1969), Death in Venice 
(1971), Ludwig (1972), and 1975's Conversation Piece, in which "the 
Leopard" Burt Lancaster again plays the director's alter ego. No other 
filmmaker handled Lancaster the way Visconti did, making him look 
so aristocratic, so distinguished, but also so human. His wonderful 
performance made Prince Salina one of the emblematic noble characters 
in movie history, but one should not ignore the splendid roles played by 
Delon and Claudia Cardinale, whose beauty here is truly breathtaking.
The film's refined chromatic and visual style, based on Visconti's 
competence in the fine arts, became his signature. One of the most 
expensive, sumptuous movies ever produced in Europe, The Leopard was 
accused by some critics of being "a monumental production in the first 
person." Perhaps this charge is accurate, but that is hardly a bad thing. 
A film that mesmerizes huge audiences and is also highly personal—a 
film d'auteur—must be the dream of directors everywhere.  DD

It is hard to imagine just how enormous the impact of Italian Neorealism 
was on world cinema; by the mid-1950s, long after the movement had 
ceased to exist in Italy, one could find Neorealist advocates and 
practitioners on every continent. In Brazil, Alex Viany's 1953 film A Needle 
in a Haystack, a gentle comedy shot on real locations in Rio, was the 
clear precursor of Neorealism there. Viany's chief assistant on that film, 
former law student Nelson Pereira dos Santos, would go on in 1955 to 
make Rio, 40 Degrees, a daring "group portrait" of Rio that follows a 
number of different storylines all happening on the same day. The harsh, 
strikingly unsentimental depiction of the Rio favelas (slums), as well as 
the vibrant, documentary-flavored camera work, made that film a kind 
of manifesto for a new cinema in Brazil.
This New Cinema, or Cinema Novo as it became known, was finally 
acknowledged as a major cultural movement in 1963 with the release 
of dos Santos's fifth feature film, Barren Lives. An extraordinary 
adaptation of the homonymous novel by Graciliano Ramos, one of the 
unquestionable masterpieces of Brazilian literature, Barren Lives tells 
the story of a family of retirantes, migrant laborers in the drought-
stricken northeast. Often compared to Faulkner, Ramos's novel, written 
in 1938, is divided into brief chapters, each one offering an intensely 
sensual, individual point of view of one of the family members over the 
course of two years. Dos Santos renders this literary device exquisitely, 
even giving us, in one of the film's most heart-breaking scenes, the 
"mind" of the family dog in its dying moments. A collection of incidents 
and encounters, rather than a clear narrative, Barren Lives ends as it 
began, with the family once again on the road. Dos Santos's film has 
an effect similar to that of Luis Buñuel's Land Without Bread (1933): You 
feel that you've passed through "realism" to arrive at something else, 
something abstract but powerful nonetheless. A final conversation 
between husband and wife hints at the possibility of change, but by this 
point we've seen too much to dare imagine any easy solutions.  RP

Shock Corridor  Samuel Fuller, 1963
409
Working in the world of exploitation films and B-movies, with shoestring 
budgets and no studio expectations beyond profitability, Samuel Fuller 
ironically found a great deal more freedom to explore controversial 
ideas and new cinematic techniques than many of his higher-profile 
peers. Shock Corridor hinges on what has become a hoary cliché: A 
hotshot reporter has himself committed to an insane asylum to 
investigate a murder. He finds more than he bargained for, of course, 
and just the same Fuller offers more than a simple exploitation film.
Shock Corridor's camerawork, by Stanley Cortez (The Magnificent 
Ambersons [1942], The Night of the Hunter [1955]), is every bit as nuts as 
the colorful cast of characters populating the asylum, lurching, looming, 
and leaping from black and white into color. The acting is likewise all 
over the place, with the cast obviously encouraged to give voice to their 
inner psychotic. A fat man claims to be a famous opera singer, a pack 
of nymphomaniacs roam the ward like wild animals, and a black man 
preaches racism. Fuller doesn't always arrange the film like he knows 
exactly where it's going, and its inherent trashiness never belies its 
B-movie origins—but he does imbue Shock Corridor with a crazed 
energy more than befitting its striking name.  JKl

Le mépris  Jean-Luc Godard, 1963
Contempt
The sixth feature to be directed by Jean-Luc Godard, most daring of the 
New Wave filmmakers of the 1960s, Contempt combines the portrait of 
a marriage with a story about making a film. Camille (Brigitte Bardot) is 
married to screenwriter Paul (Michel Piccoli). In the first sequence she 
makes an inventory of her naked body, asking him which bit he likes 
best. Then he takes her to meet Hollywood producer Jeremy Prokosch 
(Jack Palance). Prokosch is making a movie of Homer's Odyssey, to be 
directed by veteran German filmmaker Fritz Lang, playing himself. 
Palance plays his role to the hilt, intoning, "I like gods. I know exactly 
how they feel." Lang replies with some gnomic observations on cinema 
("CinemaScope is fine for shooting snakes and coffins").
Contempt is packed with cinematic references to Chaplin and Griffith, 
and to Hawks, Ray, Minnelli, and other heroes of the French film 
magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, for whom Godard was a critic. Paul's 
contribution is to remark that, show a woman a camera and she 
immediately bares her bottom—ironic, given that Bardot's naked 
behind is frequently in view.
And contempt? It's what Camille has come to feel for her husband, 
whom she accuses of trying to pimp her to Prokosch and of selling out his 
principles for money. A clever, elegant film with a shocking ending.  EB

Blonde Cobra  Ken Jacobs, 1963
Generally considered one of the masterpieces of the New York 
underground film scene, Ken Jacobs's Blonde Cobra is perhaps first and 
foremost a fascinating audio-visual testament to the tragicomic 
performance of the inimitable Jack Smith. Smith, who died of AIDS in 
1989, was a photographer, writer, filmmaker, performer, and queer muse 
for the New York avant-garde arts scene in the 1960s and 1970s. Blonde 
Cobra, which Jacobs edited from material Smith shot with collaborator 
Bob Fleischner, is comprised of sequences of Smith clowning around with 
co-performer Jerry Sims, juxtaposed with long stretches of black leader.
During the imageless black sequences, we are treated to the hilarious 
and perverse stories that Smith delivers in his characteristic nasal 
drone on the soundtrack. These at times confessional tales of a little 
boy's "frustrated longings" and an older nun's dreams of lesbianism, 
for example, are interspersed with other Smithian ruminations ("Why 
shave . . . when I can't even think of a reason for living?"), as well as with 
bits from the radio, a German tango, and a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers 
song. Though perhaps a bit "heavy," as Smith described it, Jacobs's 
Blonde Cobra provides an alluring portrait of the improvisational talents 
of a great experimental performer.  MS
"When I got to Hollywood, all the movie moguls claimed to be astounded 
by the reality of my films. How did I do it? And I'd say, 'Well, it wasn't hard 
to make Harlem look like Harlem.'" This was how writer and director Shirley 
Clarke described the response of mainstream Hollywood moviemakers to 
her independently made "fictional documentary," The Cool World. A radical 
and rarely screened classic of 1960s American experimental cinema, the 
film combines real locations, a loose narrative, naturalistic acting, and 
highly expressive editing and cinematography in a raw, unflinching look 
at the power struggles and casual violence of Harlem's street gangs.
Based on a play by Warren Miller and Robert Rossen (which was in 
turn adapted from Miller's best-selling novel), and produced by acclaimed 
documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman (four years before his own 
directorial debut, the 1967 film Titticut Follies), The Cool World boasts 
a powerful jazz soundtrack by one-time Billie Holiday accompanist 
Mal Waldon. The starkness of the music serves to make the already 
depressed living conditions seem all the more rough and unkind. Along 
with the score, it is The Cool World's unforgettable images that led film 
critic Judith Christ to describe it as a "loud, long and powerful cry of 
outrage at the world society has created for Harlem youngsters, and at 
the human condition in the slum ghetto." Find a copy somewhere, 
somehow—you won't regret it.  SJS

A skit on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, The Nutty Professor (as Eddie 
Murphy later discovered) could only be made by someone who wasn't 
as secure in the affections of the audience as he had been in the 
previous decade. In 1963, it was read as a strange summation of the 
Martin-and-Lewis films, with infantile comic Jerry Lewis proving that 
he didn't need a smooth straight man because he could play both 
roles, and the Hyde figure of swinger "Buddy Love" seen as a nasty 
caricature of Dino. Actually, Buddy plays more like Dean Martin's Rat 
Pack padrone, Frank Sinatra, and what Lewis was really doing was 
presenting his own showbiz dark side, emerging from the cocoon of his 
sweet, child-pleasing but adult-irritating comic persona. The Jekyll 
equivalent, Julius Kelp, is buck-toothed in an ironic nod to Fredric 
March's 1932 Hyde makeup, and speaks with the strangled Lewis whine 
that makes nonfans want to kill him. Allowing for a near-masochist 
series of humiliations, Kelp is picked on by the dean, football players, 
muscle men at a gym (Richard Kiel, another human cartoon, has a tiny 
cameo), and his students, exciting the sympathy only of lovely blonde 
student Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens).
Murphy's Buddy Love avenges wrongs done to his Sherman Klump, 
but Lewis's Buddy despises his alter ego and makes a play for Stella in 
such an unpleasant manner that he becomes the worst of the series 
of bullies who have picked on Kelp. From the wonderfully colored 
expressionist parody of the traditional Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation, 
in which Kelp turns into a series of ever more grotesque Hyde types 
before becoming the "swingingest" Buddy, through to Buddy's rise to 
power at the local happening place, the Purple Pit, The Nutty Professor is 
among the most uncomfortable of American comedies. Unlike Jekyll, 
Kelp learns his lesson, but not before he has had to accept that he has a 
monster inside him. The finale, in which Love transforms into Kelp in 
front of the whole campus, is dead serious, and as devastating as Cliff 
Robertson's regression to imbecility in the last reel of Charly (1968).  KN

The Great Escape  John Sturges, 1963
A terrific war film boasting an all-star cast from director John Sturges, 
The Great Escape remains as entertaining, moving, and thrilling now as 
when it was first released in 1963.
Nearly every scene is a classic, as the American and British prisoners 
of war plot to escape from their camp using three tunnels they have dug 
named Tom, Dick, and Harry. The potential escapees include: Richard 
Attenborough and Gordon Jackson as two of the British "stiff upper lip" 
officers planning the getaway; Charles Bronson, the tunneler afraid of 
enclosed spaces; Donald Pleasance, the forger with diminishing 
eyesight; James Garner, the man who can scrounge just about anything 
from the guards and fellow prisoners; and, of course, Steve McQueen as 
Hilts, a seasoned escapee dubbed "the cooler king" following his solitary 
confinement every time his escape attempts fail and he is recaptured.
An epic much like Sturges's picture from 1960, The Magnificent Seven, 
(three of that film's cast also appear here: McQueen, Bronson, and 
James Coburn), this heroic adventure, based on the novel by Paul 
Brickhill, is backed by a memorable score by Elmer Bernstein that 
beautifully punctuates every fantastic moment.  JB

Méditerranée  Jean-Daniel Pollet & Volker Schlöndorff, 1963
413
Jean-Daniel Pollet's forty-five-minute Méditerranée, shot in 1963 and first 
shown publicly four years later, is the most influential of his experimental 
films. Its impact on Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film Contempt is striking, and 
one reason why it remains so impressive as a minimalist tour de force is 
that Pollet was able to spend so much time editing it. Accompanied by 
an evocative text written by Philippe Sollers and a haunting score by 
Antoine Duhamel, who also wrote the music for Godard's 1965 film 
Pierrot le Fou, the footage shot in various countries and of various 
subjects around the Mediterranean—a Sicilian garden, a Greek temple, 
a fisherman, a young girl on an operating table—reappears throughout 
the film, each time in a separate order and for different durations.
Méditerranée inspired one of Godard's most poetic critical texts for 
the French film journal Cahiers du Cinéma, written in 1964 but published 
in 1967, in which he wrote, "In this banal series of 16mm images over 
which breathes the ineffable spirit of 70mm, it is up to us to discover the 
space which only the cinema can transform into lost time . . . or rather 
the contrary. . . . [F]or here are smooth, round shots abandoned on the 
screen like pebbles on the beach."  JRos
Yukinojo henge  Kon Ichikawa, 1963
An Actor's Revenge
An Actor's Revenge is one of the most outrageously entertaining 
Japanese films ever produced. At the time it was made, director Kon 
Ichikawa was out of favor with his studio, as his last two films had lost 
money. By way of punishment he was assigned the task of making a 
film to mark the 300th screen role of legendary actor Kazuo Hasegawa. 
This was to be a remake of Hasegawa's most popular film, a creaky old 
melodrama called The Revenge of Yukinojo—and Hasegawa would 
reprise his double role as a transvestite kabuki actor who avenges the 
death of his parents, and as the thief who helps him. When Hasegawa 
first played this swashbuckling double role he was twenty-seven; at 
the time of the remake, he was fifty-five.
Far from trying to tone down the project's improbabilities and 
absurdities, Ichikawa gleefully plays up everything artificial and 
theatrical about the story, unpredictably switching tone and idiom, 
drawing on his cartoonist's background to throw in thought bubbles, 
blatantly fake sets, anomalous music, and distorted visuals. The 
conventions of kabuki theater are affectionately parodied, with 
ultrastylized lighting and horizontal wipes across the CinemaScope 
screen. And Ichikawa makes the most of the plot's rich opportunities for 
sexual ambiguity: At one point Hasegawa as a man watches himself as 
a man-playing-a-woman making love to a woman.  PK

The Haunting  Robert Wise, 1963
In 1959, acclaimed American novelist Shirley Jackson published The 
Haunting of Hill House. Since then it has been widely praised as one of 
the most frightening tales ever committed to paper. Three years later, 
while he was wrapping up his work on West Side Story (1961), director 
Robert Wise chose this story as the one he would adapt for the big 
screen to honor the memory of his former mentor, Val Lewton—
producer on such memorable low-budget horror flicks as Cat People 
(1942), The Seventh Victim, and I Walked with a Zombie (both 1943). The 
result, The Haunting, is considered by a great many critics, aficionados, 
and casual fans of the horror genre to be one of the scariest films of all 
time—if not the scariest. In 2009, Martin Scorsese was asked to compile 
a list of his favorite horror films; The Haunting came out on top.
In an extremely creepy prologue we learn the troubled history of 
Hill House—built by a stern, heartless man named Hugh Crain eighty 
years earlier, the residence saw the mysterious deaths of no fewer than 
four women since that time. We then meet Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a 
lonely and repressed woman in her mid-thirties who jumps at the chance 
to partake in a psychic experiment arranged by one Dr. John Markway 
(Richard Johnson), an anthropologist who seeks scientific evidence of 
paranormal activity. After arriving at Hill House, Eleanor meets Dr. Markway 
(to whom she is instantly attracted), Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn), 
skeptical nephew of the current landlord, and Theodora—"just Theodora" 
(Claire Bloom)—an artist, psychic, and (it is strongly suggested) lesbian 
with an apparent interest in getting her new roommate to open up.
Shortly thereafter, the house begins making its presence felt—
strange banging noises in the middle of the night, inexplicable cold 
spots, and a famously frightening scene in which Eleanor discovers that 
she has been holding hands with no one. As Mrs. Sanderson [Fay 
Compton], Luke's aunt, observes, with chilling understatement, "The 
dead are not quiet in Hill House."
It becomes increasingly clear that Eleanor is the primary target of 
Hill House's attention—either that or she herself is somehow responsible 
for the haunting. ("Supposing it is in my imagination," she asks Dr. 
Markway at one point. "The knocking, the voices. Everything! Every 
cursed bit of the haunting.") When Dr. Markway's wife shows up 
unexpectedly, Eleanor's anticipated breakdown (chillingly conveyed 
through Harris's running internal monologue) becomes a reality. Sent 
away by the others, who fear her complete collapse, she loses control of 
her car to unseen forces and crashes headlong into a tree, where she 
dies in the same spot as Hugh Crain's first wife did years earlier.
Making brilliant use of canted frames, mirror reflections, fish-eye 
lenses, and uncanny sound and image editing, Wise succeeds both in 
bringing Hill House to life and in making ambiguous the true source of 
the threat. Do not watch this one alone!  SJS

If Dr. No (1962) was a sputnik-era Fu Manchu picture and From Russia 
with Love (1963) a Cold War Eric Ambler adventure, Goldfinger—the third 
entry in the Harry Saltzman-Albert Broccoli 007 series—marked the 
point when the James Bond films became their own genre. The rather 
brutal wit of the earlier movies is modified in the precredits sequence: 
Sean Connery's super-agent is first seen wearing a decoy duck on his 
head, then removes his wetsuit to reveal a perfect tuxedo and disposes 
of a villain through the old electric-heater-tossed-in-the-bath gambit, 
delivering another of his pointed epitaph epithets ("shocking").
With a megalomaniac millionaire, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), as 
the chief villain rather than the Soviet SMERSH of the books or the 
communist-affiliated SPECTRE of the first films, Goldfinger spins away 
from geopolitical realities into a comic-book world, albeit one where the 
Chinese will lend a nuclear weapon to a bad guy in order to cripple the 
West's economy. Included in the mix are gold-plated murder victims, 
impeccably-dressed Korean wrestler minions (Harold Sakata as the 
bowler-throwing Oddjob), improbably-named heroines (Honor Blackman 
as Pussy Galore), high-tech torture by laser beam, and a scheme not to 
rob Fort Knox but to irradiate it for centuries—thus increasing the net 
value of the villain's own gold stocks. All of the vintage 007 ingredients 
are shaken not stirred here: a belting John Barry theme tune delivered 
by Shirley Bassey ("Go-o-o-o-ldfinger . . . he's the man, the man with the 
Midas touch, a spider's touch . . ."), the gadget-packed Aston Martin with 
its bulletproof shield and passenger-side ejector seat (inspiration for the 
first great best-selling movie tie-in toy), and the vast Ken Adam sets (note 
Goldfinger's lair with the model of Fort Knox under glass as a huge coffee 
table, and the poison gas vents—a big room designed to be used only 
once). In addition, one finds the residual Ian Fleming suspicion that a 
person is contemptible if he has a foreign accent and cheats at golf, 
and the touchingly macho notion that a clinch in the hay with Sean 
Connery is enough to persuade Pussy to change not only sides but sexual 
orientation. Ever since, the series has been recycling.  KN

My Fair Lady  George Cukor, 1964
417
My Fair Lady is a lumbering, airy musical, a strange compromise between 
Broadway and Hollywood spectacle—and a true artifact of the mid-
1960s, when the studio system and its veteran professionals were 
floundering in the face of a new world and new ways of making movies. 
Yet, for all its dead time and cavernous space—André Téchiné, then a 
young Cahiers du Cinéma modernist, admired its "astonishing vacuum"—
the basic story (from George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion) is so undeniably 
affecting as to constitute a veritable modern myth. 
At its center is a hate-turned-to-love match that is hard to beat: Rex 
Harrison as the grumpy linguist Henry Higgins and Audrey Hepburn as 
Eliza Dolittle, the street urchin whom he picks for his "social experiment." 
We empathize with Eliza at every step of her trial—when she is a pauper 
resisting Higgins's brutal training, when she is a collaborator slowly falling 
in love, and finally when she has become a resplendent "lady" fighting 
off superficial suitors. 
George Cukor's gay sensibility was attuned to the unlikely alchemy of 
this star duo, as well as the reserves of glamor at his disposal (Cecil Beaton 
worked on costumes and art direction). And the songs are irresistible.  AM
Il deserto rosso  Michelangelo Antonioni, 1964
The Red Desert
Michelangelo Antonioni's first feature in color remains a high-water mark 
for using color. To get the precise hues he wanted, Antonioni had entire 
fields painted. Restored prints make it clear why audiences were so 
excited by his innovations, not only for his expressive use of color, but 
also his striking editing. Red Desert comes at the tail end of Antonioni's 
most fertile period, immediately after his remarkable trilogy The 
Adventure (1960), The Night (1961), and The Eclipse (1962). Although Red 
Desert may fall somewhat short of the first and last of these earlier 
classics, the film's ecological concerns look a lot more prescient today 
than they seemed at the time of its initial release.
Monica Vitti plays a neurotic married woman (Giuliana) attracted to 
industrialist Richard Harris. Antonioni does eerie, memorable work with 
the industrial shapes and colors that surround her, shown alternately as 
threatening and beautiful. Like any self-respecting Antonioni heroine, 
she is looking for love and meaning—and finds sex. In one sequence a 
postcoital melancholy is strikingly conveyed via an expressionist use of 
color, following Giuliana's shifting moods.  
The film's most spellbinding sequence depicts a pantheistic, utopian 
fantasy of innocence, which the heroine recounts to her ailing son, 
implicitly offering a beautiful girl and a beautiful sea as an alternative to 
the troubled woman and the industrial red desert of the title.  JRos

Suna no onna  Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1964
Woman in the Dunes
Hiroshi Teshigahara's strange existential parable Woman in the Dunes 
strikes an unusual balance between realism and metaphor. An 
entomologist (Eiji Okada) gathering insects on the beach accepts an 
invitation of hospitality from a mysterious woman (Kyôko Kishida). But 
he quickly finds himself trapped like one of his collections in the woman's 
home, built at the bottom of a sandpit, where the incessantly creeping 
crystals of sand can only be slowed through constant shoveling.
Part neofeminist exercise, part political treatise, part survival tale, 
Woman in the Dunes adds up to both more and less than its premise. 
Okada can't escape the pit without inviting disaster, but why build a 
home in a sandpit in the first place? Kishida offers sexual rewards for 
Okada's labor, but how much of this is just her method of staving off 
loneliness? Does Woman in the Dunes mock domesticity, praise it, or 
depict it as a Sisiphisian horror? Teshigahara's film doesn't offer answers. 
It does, however, offer some remarkable sand photography. Like the film 
itself, the dunes captured by Hiroshi Segawa's cinematography frequently 
shift, slide, sink, and sift to where you least expect it.  JKl
Adapted from Mikhaylo Koysyubinskiy's novel, Sergei Paradjanov's 
merging of myth, history, poetry, ethnography, dance, and ritual is one of 
the supreme works of the Soviet sound cinema, and even subsequent 
Paradjanov features have failed to dim its intoxicating splendors.
Set in the harsh and beautiful Carpathian Mountains, the film tells of 
a doomed love between a couple belonging to feuding families, Ivan 
(Ivan Mikolajchuk) and Marichka (Larisa Kadochnikova), and of Ivan's life 
and marriage after Marichka's death. The plot is affecting, but it serves 
Paradjanov mainly as an armature to support the exhilarating rush of his 
lyrical camera movements (executed by master cinematographer Yuri 
Ilyenko), his innovative use of nature and interiors, his deft juggling of 
folklore and fancy in relation to pagan and Christian rituals, and his 
astonishing handling of color and music.
A film worthy of Aleksandr Dovzhenko, whose poetic vision of 
Ukrainian life is frequently alluded to, Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors 
also evokes fairy tales in general and even at times some of Walt Disney's 
animated representations of their settings, such as the cottage in Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The visceral physicality of many other 
shots is no less unmistakable, exemplified by a startling one early on 
which places the camera on top of a just-chopped tree—taking the 
viewer with it on its vertiginous plunge toward the ground.  JRos

Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors

1964
One of the most influential of all "underground" films, this half-hour epic 
spells out its title and director's name in studs on the back of a black 
leather biker jacket, then plays a jukebox-worth of pop hits from the late 
1950s and early 1960s (such as Elvis Presley's "Devil in Disguise," the 
Angels' "My Boyfriend's Back," and Ray Charles's "Hit the Road, Jack") over 
images mostly shot in a Brooklyn biker garage. Objects of romantic 
fetishization fill the camera screen: black leather, hair and oil grease, 
naked torsos, gleaming chrome, toys and motorbikes, images from comic 
books and movies (stills of James Dean, TV snips of Marlon Brando in the 
1953 film The Wild One), rings and insignia, and muscular Tom-of-Finland-
look youths lolling pinup style in tight jeans and peaked caps.
Without Scorpio Rising, Martin Scorsese would not use pop music the 
way he does in Mean Streets (1973), David Lynch couldn't have found 
the disturbing undercurrents in Bobby Vinton's song "Blue Velvet" (which 
is also used here), and action movies wouldn't include homoerotic 
strapping-on-the-weapons montages. Most controversial, to the extent of 
prompting legal action, is the witty but deliberately provocative 
juxtaposition of the Crystals' "He's a Rebel" with found footage from some 
Sunday school version of The Life of Christ intercut, putting forward the 
heretical if not sacrilegious notion of the Disciples as a strutting, gay-tinged 
youth gang out to overthrow the established order even as the lyrics 
provide a surprisingly sermonly reading ("That's no reason why I shouldn't 
give him all my love").
The passion play continues under Claudine Clark's "Party Lights" as 
Christ's life is intercut with the sort of swastika-swathed biker Walpurgis 
Night (the eve of May Day) later hymned by Roger Corman's The Wild 
Angels (1966). As with all of Kenneth Anger's films, the magical is never 
far away, with a purple-veiled skeleton representing Death. 
However, this is a far less impervious piece than most of his works, 
oddly accessible on an MTV level in its demonstration that songs don't 
have to be performed on camera (as in the classical Hollywood musical) 
to work in the context of cinema. They can be illustrated, undercut, and 
lent greater depth by apt or even wildly inapt images.  KN

1964
After her debut in the 1963 film The Birds, Hitchcock once again cast 
Tippi Hedren, this time as a beautiful kleptomaniac whom we first see 
striding down a railroad station platform. In a hotel she washes her 
hair, rinsing out the black dye to become blonde again. We discover 
that Marnie has recently robbed her employer, and gradually we realize 
something is deeply wrong with her. She gets hysterical attacks when 
she sees the color red, and a visit to her mother reveals an unloving 
relationship. Then Marnie is hired by handsome businessman Mark 
Rutland (Sean Connery). In a brilliantly suspenseful scene, Marnie robs 
his safe while a cleaning woman mops the floor. Marnie sees the 
woman before she can be discovered, and creeps past her in 
stockinged feet, only for a shoe to drop out of her pocket. But the 
cleaning woman doesn't turn round; at the end of the scene we 
discover she is deaf.
Mark soon tracks Marnie down and offers her a choice: marriage or 
the police. On their honeymoon cruise Marnie tells him she can't bear 
men touching her, but in an uncomfortable scene he forces himself 
upon her. Mark tries to psychoanalyze his bride, educating himself 
from a book entitled Sexual Abberations of the Criminal Female, but 
Marnie's response is to try and rob him again. This time Mark forces her 
to go with him on a visit to her mother, and there the secret of Marnie's 
condition is traced back to a childhood trauma.
Though full of deft and seductive Hitchcockian touches, Marnie is 
a strange and unsettling film, in part because of Mark's character. He 
professes love of Marnie and tries to help her overcome her neurosis, 
yet his conduct is full of barely suppressed sadism and he treats her 
like a caged animal. As Marnie says, "I'm just something you caught." 
The scene in which he in effect rapes her on the honeymoon caused 
discord between Hitchcock and his writer, Evan Hunter, who wanted to 
drop it on the grounds that it made Mark unsympathetic. Hitchcock 
refused and the script was finished by Jay Presson Allen.  EB

Hitchcock and Hedren fell out so

up directing her via intermediaries.

so much successful as a 
thriller, but as a tender 
and unconventional love 
story . . . on this level, 
it makes compelling 
viewing."

The Masque of the Red Death  Roger Corman, 1964
As Roger Corman's series of Vincent Price-starring, Edgar Allan Poe-
based widescreen gothics advanced in America from The Fall of the 
House of Usher (1960) to The Raven (1963), each installment became 
more self-referential and comic in tone. However, when production of 
the series shifted in 1964 to Britain, the tone changed radically for two 
final masterpieces, the baroque Masque of the Red Death and the chilling 
Tomb of Ligeia (1965).
Masque casts Price ideally as Prince Prospero, an Italian Satanist who 
hosts a decadent masked ball as the plague ravages the countryside. 
There's a youth-themed plot about an innocent abducted girl (Jane 
Asher) and her revolutionary love interest, but here the emphasis is on 
corrupt luxury, with Price twitching his mustache and eyebrows with 
elegant, weary cynicism even as Death itself invades his ball and spreads 
the contagion in a Bergmanesque dance of death. Cinematographer 
Nicolas Roeg is encouraged to add his own flourishes, including long 
tracks through a succession of differently colored rooms (an image from 
the story), with the shock effects having a daring sensuality. Patrick 
Magee is dressed as an ape and burned alive by a dwarf jester (an import 
from Poe's "Hop-Frog") and Hazel Court brands her swanny cleavage in 
tribute to Satan before being murdered by a swooping falcon.  KN
Prima della rivoluzione  Bernardo Bertolucci, 1964
Before the Revolution
Bernardo Bertolucci's Before the Revolution is an astonishing film. When 
one realizes that the director was only twenty-two years old at the time 
it was made, it becomes miraculous. A transposition of Stendhal's La 
Chartreuse de Parme to the modern day, this is the story of a young man, 
Fabrizio (Francesco Barilli), and his hopeless love for his aunt Gina 
(Adriana Asti), who is ten years his senior.
This is not, as the title might lead you to expect, a militant story of 
heroic revolutionary struggle, but an elegy for those bourgeois lives 
doomed because they take place before the revolution. The story is 
simple: Fabrizio, on the edge of adulthood, has a life mapped out 
according to the middle-class norms of his city. Then the death by 
drowning of his friend Agostino (Allen Midgette) causes him to call his 
future into doubt as he starts a tempestuous affair with Gina. The final 
section of the film, which contrasts the future sketched by Fabrizio's 
Communist teacher and Gina's friend who is about to lose his hereditary 
estate, makes clear that Fabrizio himself can live neither in the future nor 
in the past, but only in an uneasy present. Before the Revolution is a 
perfect portrait of the generation who were to embrace revolt in the late 
1960s, and a stunning portrait of Parma—Bertolucci's own city.  CM

Worrying and Love the Bomb  Stanley Kubrick, 1964
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop
Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant black comedy that works as political satire, 
suspense farce, and cautionary tale of technology running away with us. 
When a fanatical U.S. general launches a nuclear attack on the U.S.S.R. the 
President has his hands full recalling bombers and calming Russians while 
contending with his advisers and a twisted scientist. The plot came from 
a serious novel by Peter George, published in the United States as Red 
Alert and in the United Kingdom as Two Hours to Doom. Kubrick loved it 
but thought people were so overwhelmed by the threat of annihilation 
that they were in denial, apathetic to nuclear documentary or drama. So 
he would surprise audiences into reacting to the prospect of global 
extermination with outrageously funny and provocative cartoon tactics.
Kubrick and cowriter Terry Southern created a cast of grotesques whose 
absurd fixations, by their incongruity, play up the realism against which 
they are set (and which is enhanced by Gilbert Taylor's outstanding black-
and-white cinematography). The information about a doomsday device 
is factual, as are the Strategic Air Command operations and the B-52 crew's 
procedures. The computers that take the situation beyond human 
intervention have only become more capable. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
There are just three locations, each suffering a failure to communicate. 
At Burpelson Air Force Base, maniacal General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling 
Hayden) circumvents fail-safe protocol and orders a bomber wing to 
nuke the "Russkies," taking appalled RAF officer Lionel Mandrake (Peter 
Sellers) captive. Aboard the B-52 code-named Leper Colony, dogged 
Major T.J. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens) and his crew suffer radio failure and 
are oblivious to frantic efforts to recall them. In the War Room at The 
Pentagon—an awesome set by production designer Ken Adam—
President Merkin Muffley (Sellers), rampant General Buck Turgidson 
(George C. Scott), Soviet Ambassador de Sadesky (Peter Bull), and 
demented Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again, in a nod to Metropolis's mad 
scientist Rotwang) are gathered in a futile attempt to stop Armageddon.
Sellers's sidesplitting three performances are legend but the entire 
ensemble gives a masterclass in exaggerated, perfectly timed posturing. 
Two images are unforgettable—Kong astride the H-bomb, yee-hawing 
all the way down, and demented Dr. Strangelove, unable to stop his 
mechanical arm from flying into the Nazi salute and throttling himself. 
Every viewing is a reminder the film is stuffed with hilarious dialogue, 
and President Muffley on the hot line to Moscow breaking it to the Soviet 
Premier that one of his base commanders "went and did a silly thing" 
remains a classic monologue. Kubrick would return to the potential 
menace of computer dependency in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), to 
institutional and political violence in A Clockwork Orange (1971), and to 
the savage, surreal madness of war in Full Metal Jacket (1987). But he 
never made us laugh this much in any other film.  AE

After attending an early screening of Glauber Rocha's Black God, White 
Devil, one Brazilian film critic was overheard marveling, "Oh my God, 
Eisenstein's been reborn . . . and he's Brazilian!" Born in Bahia, the Brazilian 
state known as ground zero for Afro-Brazilian culture, Glauber grew up 
fascinated by mysticism and American Westerns. In his early twenties, 
he moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he quickly fell in with a core of young 
cinephiles who would found the influential Cinema Novo movement.
Drawn like so many of his generation to radical politics, Rocha in Black 
God, White Devil sought to explore the connections between historical 
change and violence. Here, he focuses on examples of popular rebellion 
in Brazil's backlands. After killing his abusive employer, Manoel (Geraldo 
Del Rey) flees with his wife Rosa (Yoná Magalhães) into the arid backlands 
known as the sertao. They first meet up with Sebastiao (Lidio Silva), a 
black mystic who preaches that a millennial upheaval is coming that will 
"turn the sea into the land and the land into the sea." Sebastiao is 
eventually killed by Rosa, and his followers are dispatched by the rifle of 
Antonio das Mortes (Maurício do Valle), a mysterious figure hired by the 
Church and large landowners. Next, Manoel and Rosa meet up with 
Corisco (Othon Bastos), the blond "devil" who's the last surviving 
cangaceiro, wildly dressed bandits who took on a certain Robin Hood 
aura in popular consciousness. Eventually, das Mortes catches up with 
him too, but Manoel and Rosa keep running, still rebellious but now 
aware that neither banditry nor mysticism can truly address their needs.
Shot in a harsh black and white that practically makes the screen glow 
from heat, Black God, White Devil alternates frenetic camera movements 
with dynamic montage sequences, while juxtaposing Villa Lobos with 
wind, screams, and gunshots. The ultimate effect is a feeling that the film, 
and the country it's depicting, is about to burst apart; perhaps not 
unexpectedly, between the completion of the film and its commercial 
release the Brazilian military staged a coup, establishing a dictatorship 
that would continue for over twenty years.  RP

Famously described by an over-excited Village Voice as "the Citizen Kane 
of jukebox movies," Richard Lester's 1964 comedy starring The Beatles 
and their music may not be quite that (although it is funnier), but it did 
change the shape of pop music films forever. With a witty, social-realist 
script by Liverpudlian playwright Alun Owen and traces of Lester's 
British surrealist influences (he had worked with The Beatles' 1950s 
comic idols, The Goons), A Hard Day's Night takes a day in the life of a 
hugely successful teen group sensation and turns it into something 
thrilling. The camera follows The Beatles—who play a recognizable 
version of themselves—through a typical day of being chased by fans, 
hanging around, fielding idiotic press questions, and, at the end, 
actually playing. Lester gave the four members of the band just enough 
to do, most notably Ringo Starr, whose affecting scene on a canal 
towpath with a young boy was enhanced by the fact that Starr was 
monumentally hungover.
Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr come across as likeable, 
slightly rebellious, intelligent young men, who, in the tradition of 
realistic northern England dramas, are down-to-earth, unpretentious, 
and prone to seeing through the falseness of others ("I fought the war 
for the likes of you," says a derby-hatted old-timer to Starr, who replies, 
"I bet you're sorry you won"). This constant rejection of just about 
everything—TV producers, admen, authority in general—might have 
aged badly were it not contrasted with the astonishing force and glamor 
of the band's music. This combination acted exactly as it was intended, 
as a blast of propaganda not only for The Beatles, but also for the much-
vaunted "younger generation." While A Hard Day's Night cannot be 
held directly responsible for inventing the counterculture, ousting old 
Hollywood, and ending the Vietnam War, it was seen, absorbed, and 
revered by a host of future artistic talent, particularly in the United 
States, where that younger generation found the movie genuinely 
liberating. The songs are great, too.  KK

Movie audiences have long turned to musicals as the ultimate form of 
escapism. Imagine, emotions so strong that mere words can't express 
them, inspiring characters to burst into song and dance. The characters 
of Jacques Demy's musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg are no exception, 
but with this most rapturous of melodramas Demy incorporates song 
and dance in the service not of escape but of realism. The effect is as 
riveting as it is profoundly moving.
Yet The Umbrellas of Cherbourg further deviates from most musicals 
in the sense that all its dialogue is sung, matched to Michel Legrand's 
wall-to-wall score. The effect is both hypnotic and beautiful. The nonstop 
music draws us even deeper into the devastating story, and the incessant 
singing elicits wonderfully open and direct performances from the cast. 
Catherine Deneuve plays Geneviève Emery, a young girl in love with a 
mechanic named Guy (Nino Castelnuovo). They pledge their undying 
affection for one another. Then Guy heads off to war and Geneviève 
discovers she's pregnant. She is persuaded to accept the marriage 
proposal of a wealthy gem-dealer patron (Marc Michel) of her mother's 
shop, whose love for Geneviève is so strong he promises to raise the 
child as his own.
Geneviève's emotional dilemma is, of course, played for maximum 
pathos, and when she only hears back once from her true love Guy your 
heart breaks along with hers. Yet Demy never lets the film lapse into 
easy sentimentality. The final scene is immensely moving, but not 
manipulatively so, and although the music does its job, directing and 
reflecting the feelings of the characters, it never comes across as overly 
sentimental. The sad sense of inevitability that pervades The Umbrellas 
of Cherbourg at least partly accounts for its immense appeal. Demy, like 
most people, understood that in the real world not all stories have happy 
endings, and thanks to his great cast (especially the beautiful and 
extremely convincing Deneuve) he was deft enough to convey that 
realization with immense emotional honesty, magic, and maturity.  JKl

In Gertrud, his final film, Carl Dreyer brings to its logical culmination the 
process of fining down, of attenuation, that he had been pursuing for 
some forty years. It is an old man's film in its sense of quiet renunciation, 
yet at the same time a very modern one.  
Gertrud is adapted from a 1906 play by the Swedish playwright 
Hjalmar Söderberg, whose heroine is closely based on a woman with 
whom he'd had a passionate affair. Dreyer's adaptation presents Gertrud 
as an erotic idealist, a woman who will accept love only on her own 
exacting, single-minded terms. Three men—her husband, a poet, and a 
young musician—love her, but because none of them will put his love 
for her before everything else in his life, she rejects them all, preferring 
to live celibate in Paris and devote herself to the life of the mind. 
Dreyer shoots his film with mesmerizing restraint. Nearly two hours 
long, it consists of less than ninety shots. For long periods the camera 
remains motionless in medium shot, observing two people as they talk. 
The characters, though driven by strong passions, love, and despair, 
rarely raise their voices. There are few sets and only one exterior scene; 
decors are pared down to basics. At its premiere in Paris, Gertrud was 
received with uncomprehending hostility by press and public alike. 
Since then, it has come to be recognized as the last lapidary statement 
of one of the most individual of filmmakers—a film, like its heroine, to 
be approached on its own terms.  PK

Onibaba  Kaneto Shindô, 1964
The Demon
Kaneto Shindô's Onibaba portrays history as a tale of unmitigated horror 
from the perspective of its losers. In so doing, he makes an allegorical 
statement about life amid both scarcity and class and gender antagonism, 
and also reveals the ideological impulses behind the horror genre itself.
The plot centers on two peasants, a mother (Nobuko Otowa) and her 
daughter-in-law (Jitsuko Yoshimura), who survive a medieval war by killing 
lost samurai and selling their armor for food. One day a samurai with a 
frightening mask enters the old woman's hut and asks her to lead him 
through the surrounding reeds. Obsessed with the desire to see his face, 
she kills him and, in one of the film's most stunning moments, she removes 
the mask to see the face of a Japanese A-bomb victim (hibakusha).
The old woman begins to wear the mask herself, and in a terrifying 
scene finds it permanently affixed to her face. The younger woman 
breaks open the mask with an axe and uncovers the bleeding, tortured 
face of an alive hibakusha, from whom she flees in revulsion. The film 
ends with the old woman crying, "I am not a demon, I am a human being."
By transforming the demonic mask into a cover for the disfigured 
face of the hibakusha—a group of people who were stigmatized in Japan 
after World War II—Shindô brilliantly connects generic convention with 
the all-too-real horrors of his home country.  JKe
Mary Poppins  Robert Stevenson, 1964
As far back as 1938, Walt Disney had been trying to buy the rights to the 
Mary Poppins books. Its author, P.L. Travers, had repeatedly refused his 
overtures, but Disney persisted—as good an indication as any of Disney's 
sharp commercial instincts. Having finally secured Travers's permission—
with the author retaining script approval rights—Disney turned her work 
into one of his studio's best-loved classics, and one of its biggest hits.
Set in a stylized version of Edwardian England—and including some 
groundbreaking sequences combining live action and cell animation—
the film features Julie Andrews as the eponymous nanny employed by 
the affluent Banks family. With the action interspersed with the Sherman 
Brothers' infectiously catchy songs, it ultimately sees Mary Poppins bring 
the Banks children closer to their well-meaning but negligent parents, 
with the help of friends that include the happy-go-lucky chimney sweep 
Bert (the much maligned, cockney-accented Dick Van Dyke).
Mary Poppins's success lay in attracting the "family audience," a 
demographic that Hollywood studios feared they had lost to the 
emergence of television. It was an audience that Julie Andrews would 
go on to enchant with The Sound of Music (1965), which cemented her 
reputation for wholesome, old-fashioned entertainment.  EL

1964
This early work by Pier Paolo Pasolini, drawing freely from religious, 
Marxist, and Neorealist traditions, will forever change your conception 
of a biblical epic. Pasolini was a film critic, writer, and political theorist 
before he started making movies, and many of his productions bear the 
weight of his intellectual ambitions. In this relatively straightforward 
film set in the landscape of southern Italy, Pasolini uses minimal sets 
and simple camera setups to create a convincing portrait of the biblical 
era. Pasolini cast nonprofessional actors—Enrique Irazoqui, who plays 
Jesus, was a student before getting the part—depicting the disciples as 
a group of socially committed young men, acting in a revolutionary 
cause. The youth and inexperience of the actors gives a sense of the 
tenuous nature of the fledgling Christian movement, as something 
unsure and as yet unformed; it is as though Pasolini wants to erase 
2,000 years of dogma and tradition to examine the gospels anew.
Pasolini draws on other arts to elevate this simply told and acted 
story into a spiritual realm. Using little dialogue, he places his characters 
in iconic close-ups that recall medieval religious portraiture. Alternating 
with the close-ups are medium and long shots that recall the works of 
Peter Breugel, placing the story of Christ in a teeming, immediate 
context. Music, ranging from masses by Bach and Mozart to blues 
recordings, imparts extra meaning—a canny technique to handle the 
untried cast, which at times seems to be underemoting.
Pasolini succeeds in creating a moving and convincing film of the 
gospel as well as mounting a Marxist critique of Christianity. Without 
viscerally and intellectually assaulting the viewer as in his later films, 
Gospel contains many of the ideas of his later works and is a fine 
introduction to his work.  RH

Alexander Walker, 
Evening Standard

Perhaps the most moving drama ever made about the Holocaust, Ján 
Kadár and Elmar Klos's The Shop on Main Street deals with individual 
morality and responsibility in the context of a "total" society, a theme 
whose provocation was not lost on official Czech censors. Though it 
addresses the irreducible human questions raised by the relationship 
between Jew and Gentile in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, the film 
discovers a utopian hope for collective happiness in the midst of profound 
despair. The protagonist, Tono (Jozef Kroner), is a carpenter in a small 
town whose worst problem is his nagging wife Evelyna (Hana Slivková), 
who is always pushing him to make more money by collaborating with 
the Germans like his reptilian brother-in-law Marcus (Frantisek Zvarík).
Finding such hopes of advancement a little appealing, Tono eventually 
agrees to be appointed "Aryan controller" of a small Jewish shop presided 
over by a quite old and somewhat senile woman, Mrs. Lautmann (Ida 
Kaminska). Tono discovers that the shop makes no money and that the 
widow is supported by the other Jews of the town, who soon hire Tono 
to look after her. For the first time in his life, Tono must spend time with 
a Jew, and the odd couple soon become quite close. Then the order goes 
out for the Jews to pack their belongings for transport to a "labor" camp. 
At first, Tono tries to force the uncomprehending woman outside to join 
the other Jews. But she resists, and Tono, confused and panicked, decides 
to lock her into a closet until the deportation has ended, hoping in the 
end that they will both be saved. His rough handling of the old woman, 
however, has killed her. Discovering Mrs. Lautmann's lifeless body, Tono is 
overwhelmed by guilt. He puts a noose around his head and hangs himself.
Tono is a kind of Everyman who, uninterested in the play of ideologies 
around him, discovers that circumstances force him to both choose and 
act. As he acts, he assumes responsibility and, feeling guilt, also has a 
vision of a community beyond ideology and sectarianism. Beautifully 
acted and staged, The Shop on Main Street is one of the masterpieces of 
the Czech renaissance.  RBP

1965
Perhaps the greatest screen epic ever produced, David Lean's film of Boris 
Pasternak's novel chronicles the discontents of early twentieth-century 
Russian society: the disastrous effects of World War I on the country, as 
well as the revolution that destroyed the old order only to deliver Russia 
to the agonies of a civil war followed by continuing political turmoil. 
Robert Bolt's screenplay judiciously compresses Doctor Zhivago's 
sprawling story, which is told in flashback from the perspective of the 
1930s and a time of continuing economic and social transformation. Yuri 
Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a well-born doctor whose avocation is poetry. 
He marries his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) before 
departing for service in the war. There he meets Lara (Julie Christie), the 
great love of his life, who is married to a prominent revolutionary. After 
the revolution, Zhivago's family suffers, and he is forced to work as the 
medical officer for a Bolshevik band in the civil war. Eventually, however, 
he escapes, only to learn his family has fled to Paris to avoid imprisonment 
or worse. Finding Lara, the two live together, during which time he writes 
his best poetry. But the lovers must part, never to see one another again.
Though a poignant love story, with Christie and Sharif effective as an 
ill-starred couple, Doctor Zhivago is perhaps most memorable for its 
magnificent set pieces—the assault by sword-wielding Cossacks on a 
group of protestors, the interminable journey by train across the country 
endured by Zhivago's family, the wintry landscape through which 
Zhivago must trudge to rejoin Lara in a deserted country estate. Lean 
expertly handled the international ensemble of well-known actors, with 
the performances by Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay in supporting 
character roles particularly effective. Freddie Young's cinematography 
evokes the expansiveness and raw beauty of the Russian landscape, and 
Maurice Jarre's score complements the story admirably.
Doctor Zhivago proved hugely profitable at the box office and has 
continued to draw many viewers in subsequent television exhibition, 
with its memorable characters, riveting action, and moving depiction of 
important historical events.  RBP

The War Game  Peter Watkins, 1965
A hypothesis about the aftermath of a nuclear attack on England, The 
War Game was banned by BBC television, which produced it, ostensibly 
because (among other reasons stated or hinted at) "it was too horrific 
for the medium of broadcasting." The War Game fast became a cause 
célèbre and won an Oscar, and remains the most widely known of 
Peter Watkins's films.
The film mixes scenes seemingly shot by a newsreel crew with others 
filmed in a documentary style (handheld, single-camera, available-lit) 
in situations that contradict the presence of a camera. The offscreen 
narrator (using a bland BBC voice) sometimes speaks as if the events 
shown have already taken place, giving dates and times and using the 
past tense, and then switches without warning to an informational 
mode or to the what-if ("If evacuation plans were carried out, scenes like 
this would be inevitable"; "This could be the way the last two minutes of 
peace in Britain would look"). Watkins's free play with narrative strategies 
gives the film a surging restlessness that's as compelling as his imagery 
of devastation. The War Game is a tour de force that has lost none of its 
power to horrify since its initial release.  CFu
Kon Ichikawa's record of the 1964 Tokyo Olympiad raised the stakes of 
epic documentary and achieved a level of artistic reportage subsequent 
sports programming has been clamoring to mimic ever since. It begins 
with a rising sun and closes the same way with occasional amplification 
by Japanocentric flag ceremonies. In the mix are both famous and 
little-known events, with occasional asides to spy on riveted spectators 
or tour Tokyo's hotspots.
Putting action to image, however, is Ichikawa's strength. Bodies are 
synecdochically represented with feet, buttocks, or straining neck, turning 
physical achievement into the very grace of existence. Purposefulness is 
found both in preparing and executing athletic achievements and, as is 
often the case in documentary, historicity itself remains indelible.
The obsolete scissors-kick high-jump technique stings with an 
imprecise physics. A side-armed volleyball serve seems out of place, 
and the grunt-and-throw shot put, rather than a spin, defies modern 
excellence. Even so, the human element shows through in Tokyo 
Olympiad, perhaps most sensually during the women's 80-meter hurdles 
final when all ambient sound and accompanying music stops for slow-
motion movement. Kneecaps scrape by. Faces grimace. Muscles loosen 
and pound. In short, it is the essence and root cause of sport transformed 
into movie magic.  GC-Q

Giulietta degli spiriti  Federico Fellini, 1965
Juliet of the Spirits
Today, the excellence of color work in cinematography and film design 
is judged on the achievement of an overall, carefully modulated palette. 
In Federico Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits, color is the occasion to create an 
aesthetic riot between and within shots: a frame that is all red and green, 
for instance, intercut with one that is gleaming white.
In his first color film, Fellini explored the possibilities with glee. 
Conceived as a companion piece to 8 ½ (1963), it delves into the psyche 
of Juliet, played by Fellini's famous wife Giulietta Masina. Faced with an 
uncertain marriage and a philandering husband (the film is lightly 
autobiographical), Juliet strays into a highly eroticized world of spiritual 
mediums, high-class whores, and affluent acquaintances. Soon, the 
spirit-visions come, tormenting Juliet with the gap between her oppressive, 
religious upbringing and the liberation or contentment she seeks.
One of the most extraordinary aspects of this movie today is its 
absolute modernity. The faces, costumes, and attitudes do not seem dated. 
The film is uniquely prescient: Already Fellini had absorbed, and lovingly 
exaggerated, the pop-mystical fads that were to explode in "New Age" 
culture, especially concerning "body and mind" philosophies—for this is 
truly a movie about body and mind as surrealistic "communicating vessels."
Although Fellini was reproached for using women as the ground for 
his narcissistic projections, Juliet is in fact his finest female character—
Masina bringing to the outlandish proceedings both a childlike wonder 
and a down-to-earth hesitation and skepticism that make her a natural 
figure of identification for the viewer. Stylistically, Fellini here began 
marrying his dream-fed visions with the technological bric-a-brac of the 
modern world (telephones, movie projectors, screens), simultaneously 
making sublime things mundane, and mundane things sublime. His 
camera is a roving eye, sometimes seemingly lost: The relentless entries 
and exits from the frame, the artful shuttling of multiple bodies, the 
sudden moments when an image is revealed as Juliet's point of view—
all these devices, swinging to the rhythm of Nino Rota's rich, carnival-
style score, evoke a heady plunge into the realm of the unconscious.  AM
"I don't care about the 
clemency you offer me 
but the salvation 
of my soul."

A chemistry graduate turned journalist who became a youthful leader 
of the partisans' antifascist Resistance in Italy through World War II, Gillo 
Pontecorvo entered the world of cinema as a documentary filmmaker. 
He brought his intellect, fierce political beliefs, and personal experience 
to this seminal, electrifying, political thriller, which recounts the bloody 
Algerian struggle for independence from France. The action takes place 
between 1954 and 1962 in gritty, authentic drama-documentary style, 
cast largely with nonprofessional actors and shot and narrated in the 
manner of a newsreel. Winner of the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice 
Film Festival, The Battle of Algiers was one of the most influential films to 
come out of Italy in the 1960s, and it has lost none of its passionate power.
Although Pontecorvo had financial assistance from the Algerian 
government—and the film wears its anticolonialist heart on its sleeve—
horrifying and heartrending scenes of atrocities and reprisals are 
laudably evenhanded, depicting both sides of the conflict and its awful 
human cost. It is gripping from start to finish. A particularly 
uncompromising tour de force is a nail-biting sequence that follows 
women of the Algiers casbah slipping through checkpoints and planting 
primitive bombs—in an airport lounge, in a milk bar—where oblivious 
French teens are gyrating to pop songs, to an inevitably grievous 
aftermath. The really superb, emotive score was co-composed by 
Pontecorvo himself and the great Ennio Morricone.  AE

The Sound of Music  Robert Wise, 1965
435
It is all too easy to knock Robert Wise's enormously successful screen 
adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical hit, what with singing 
nuns and a kind-of-cute clutch of seven kids coping with the double trouble 
of an absurdly disciplinarian widower father and the rise of the Nazi regime 
in 1930s Salzburg. But one should never underestimate the effectiveness 
of the lead performances—Julie Andrews as the eccentrically vivacious 
nun-turned-governess and Christopher Plummer as the strict, buttoned-
up patriarch whose heart she melts. There is also the unsentimental 
precision of Ernest Lehman's script, and the solid, unshowy expertise of 
Wise's direction, in which his editor's sensitivity to structure, rhythm, and 
rhyming juxtapositions is always evident.
That exhilarating opening helicopter shot across the mountaintops—
finally alighting on Andrews running exuberantly as she bursts into "The 
hills are alive" may now seem hackneyed, but that's only because its 
efficiency in establishing mood (and, indeed, meaning, since The Sound 
of Music is a film in which music and the life force are inextricably linked) 
has meant that it has been much imitated. And let us not forget: like it 
or not, those tunes really are unforgettable.  GA
De man die zijn haar kort liet knippen  
The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short  
André Delvaux, 1965
The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short is the film through which Belgian 
cinema entered modernism. The feature debut of André Delvaux, it also 
marks the arrival of Belgium's own national cinematic style, magic 
realism—a unique blend of reality and eerie fantasy, addressing the 
surreal melancholy of everyday life.
Delvaux's film follows a curious narrative, from love story to mystery-
thriller, over to an exploration of the thin line between sanity and 
madness. Govert Miereveld (Senne Roufaer) is a teacher who falls in love 
with a pupil who soon disappears, leaving us—and Govert—to wonder 
whether or not he has killed her. Much more than a mere detective 
tale, The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short is a quest into the protagonist's 
identity crisis; together with Govert we gradually realize we can no 
longer trust what we see or hear, as reality itself becomes a dream. A 
crucial scene in the film is a countryside autopsy, mixing realism, 
revulsion, and dreamlike alienation.
Stylistically, The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short is a very subtle movie. 
Minute details in the language, visuals, and behavior of the characters 
cast doubts upon the veracity of the very realistic settings in which Govert 
lives and travels, until, in the end, we give up looking for truth, settling, 
with Govert, for quiet contemplation—a surrender to strangeness.  EM

In the future, secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine) cruises 
into Alphaville, which is either a city or a planet, in his Ford Galaxie, which 
is either a car or a spaceship. His mission is to find and perhaps liquidate 
the missing Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon). First, Caution runs 
into Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff), an agent who has gone native, and 
then the mad scientist's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), who has never 
heard the words "love" or "conscience." Alphaville is run by a croaking 
super-computer that has made honest emotion a capital crime, insisting 
on mass executions carried out in an eerie swimming pool. Caution 
naturally sets out to destroy the computer (by feeding it poetry), and 
incidentally woos the fragile Natacha, awakening her dormant emotions.
Godard set out to create a science-fiction film without expensive 
sets or special effects. Shooting in cleverly selected Paris locations, he 
discovers the seeds of a totalitarian future in contemporary hotel lobbies, 
neon signage, office buildings, and bureaucratic waiting rooms. Alphaville's 
relationship with science fiction was initially parodic, as is Godard's 
affectionate borrowing of trench-coat characters and gun-pulling poses 
from hard-boiled Franco-American pulp (Constantine had played author 
Peter Cheyney's Mike Hammer-ish sleuth Lemmy Caution in a run of thick-
ear thrillers). However, considered as a product of the times—when Philip 
K. Dick was exploring similar themes in ever-more-ambitious novels—
Alphaville now looks a lot like proper sci-fi, to the extent of influencing 
a run of adaptations (from François Truffaut's take on Ray Bradbury's 
Fahrenheit 451 [1966] to Ridley Scott's Dick-derived Blade Runner [1982]).
Like many Godard films, Alphaville deliberately runs out of plot after 
an hour and has two characters sitting in a hotel room arguing for minutes. 
As in Breathless (1959) and Contempt (1963), this free-ranging conversation, 
with Caution shaking Natacha out of zombiehood, is a highlight, confirming 
Godard as almost the equal of Joseph L. Mankiewicz in the cinema of 
conversation. A rare futurist vision that simply does not date.  KN

Orson Welles was always fascinated by Shakespeare and filmed both an 
Othello and a Macbeth as well as a television version of The Merchant of 
Venice. There is no doubt, however, that his greatest achievement in this 
vein is his adaptation of the Henry IV plays, Chimes at Midnight. But don't 
go looking for a faithful Shakespeare adaptation here. Scholarly opinion 
divides between those who think that the young Prince Hal is merely 
sowing his wild oats with the drunk reprobate Falstaff and is justified in 
abandoning him when he comes to the throne, and those who feel that 
the abandonment of the fat knight shows that Hal is a Machiavellian 
prince with no human feeling. Welles does not bother to balance his 
opinions. This is Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 told from Falstaff's point of view. 
His drinking and thieving, his cowardice and his greed are not faults 
but foibles. Falstaff is fat and Welles glories in his physical embodiment 
of the corpulent knight. The comic scenes in Eastcheap, particularly after 
the failed robbery at Gadhill, are masterful.
Shakespeare's repartee has never been so gloriously performed as 
it is by Welles. Even more affecting are the battle scenes shot without 
nobility or honor, wretched fields on which men die to serve the 
crooked purpose of their masters. But the real triumph of Chimes at 
Midnight is the scenes from which the film takes its title, Falstaff's 
encounter with Justice Shallow (Alan Webb), the acquaintance of his 
riotous youth who has become a country magistrate. The pathos of 
these encounters, which go well beyond the Shakespearean play, are 
truly affecting—particularly as we are in no doubt of the tragic 
emotional fate that awaits Falstaff as he is banished by the love of his 
life, young Prince Hal now become King Henry V. The cast is magnificent, 
with John Gielgud as Henry IV, Norman Rodway as Hotspur, Keith Baxter 
as Hal, and even Jeanne Moreau showing up as Doll Tearsheet and 
Marina Vlady as Hotspur's wife. One warning: the postsynchronization 
of the dialogue is truly appalling—it has to be heard to be believed. 
Otherwise it is a masterpiece.  CM

What can you say about Russ Meyer? His movies are, to paraphrase a 
well-known saying about life itself, nasty, brutish, and short. Arguments 
have been made in favor of his occasional artistry and sometimes we 
are asked to reconsider the troublesome sexual politics of his films. 
And although both arguments (and many of the films themselves) 
should be approached with caution, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! remains 
a favorite—and not just for John Waters, who likes to claim that it's the 
best movie ever made.
Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! traces the exploits (an especially significant 
term in this context) of its three curvy and violent drag-racing female 
protagonists: Varla (Tura Satana), Rosie (Haji), and Billie (Lori Williams). 
After a racing-related murder, the crew hides out at a nearby ranch where 
they spend the rest of the picture scheming to liberate the rancher of 
his finances. The film enjoys its place at the top of many cult lists in part 
because of its several inherent delights—creative and flashy editing, 
smart black-and-white cinematography, a jazzy score, and plenty of 
innuendo—and in part because it is a fascinating barometer of the shifts 
occurring during the 1960s, especially with respect to cinema itself.  DO

Vinyl  Andy Warhol, 1965
Andy Warhol's 1965 film, consisting of two unedited thirty-five-minute 
black-and-white reels, is a fascinating, sexy, pre-Stanley Kubrick 
rendering of Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange. In Vinyl the 
homoerotics of sadomasochism take center stage, as the juvenile 
delinquent (or JD) Victor, played by a deliciously wooden Gerard 
Malanga, receives his "reeducation" at the hands of the police. The clever 
scenario by Warhol's frequent collaborator Ronald Tavel calls for Victor 
to rough up some guy, get roughed up by the police in return, watch 
some "flickers" of JD violence, wear an SM leather mask, sniff poppers, 
and dance wildly to Martha and the Vandellas' song, "Nowhere to Run." 
This story of Victor's reeducation is juxtaposed with a sadomasochism 
scene led by the Doc (a sexy Tosh Carillo in tight white jeans) who slowly 
taunts his willingly restrained, bare-chested accomplice.
Vinyl's brilliance is largely due to Warhol's framing of the action. His 
use of a static camera setup condenses all the scenes into the cramped 
but dynamic space of the single frame: Victor's reeducation in the 
foreground; Doc's SM session in the background; the queeny Ondine in 
the middle; and, perhaps, most striking of all, a silent Edie Sedgwick 
sparkling at the right corner of the screen.  MS

The Saragossa Manuscript  Wojciech Has, 1965
Jerry Garcia proclaimed this 1965 Polish feature his favorite movie, 
having seen a pared-down version in San Francisco's North Beach 
during the 1960s, and a few years back he, Martin Scorsese, and Francis 
Ford Coppola helped to restore it to its original three-hour length. It's 
easy to see how The Saragossa Manuscript became a cult film. Toward 
the end of the Spanish Inquisition a Napoleonic military officer—
Zbigniew Cybulski, the Polish James Dean, though pudgier than usual 
here—is morally tested by two seductive Muslim princesses, incestuous 
sisters from Tunisia, and no less than nine interconnected flashbacks 
recounted by various characters figure in the labyrinthine plot, its tales 
within tales imparting some of the flavor of The Arabian Nights and 
occasional echoes of Kafka (mainly in the eroticism).
Krzysztof Penderecki's score runs the gamut from classical music 
to flamenco to modernist electronic noodling, and the stark, rocky 
settings are elegantly filmed in black-and-white CinemaScope. The 
late Wojciech Has was a fine journeyman director, though a film of 
this kind really calls for someone more obsessive, like Roman Polanski. 
Adapted by Tadeusz Kwiatkowski from Jan Potocki's 1813 novel, it is 
certainly an intriguing fantasy and a haunting reflection on the 
processes of storytelling.  JRos

Roman Polanski's first film in English is still his scariest and most 
disturbing—not only for its evocations of sexual panic but also because 
his masterful use of sound puts the audience's imagination to work in 
numerous ways. It is also the most expressionistic of his early black-and-
white features, using wide angles that become increasingly wider and 
deep focus, along with other visual strategies, to convey subjective states 
of mind in which dreams, imagination, and everyday reality are worked 
into the same continuum. One result of such an expressionist style is that 
the conventional apartment in which most of the action takes place 
gradually assumes the shape and form of a tortured consciousness.
Catherine Deneuve gives one of her most impressive performances 
here as Carole Ledoux, a quiet and quietly mad Belgian manicurist 
terrified of men and living with her older sister in London. When the 
sister and her boyfriend, whose lovemaking in an adjacent room 
already disturbs and frightens her, take off on a holiday, Carole's fears 
and isolation in the apartment begin to fester along with the uncooked 
food—including a sinister-looking skinned rabbit. The results are 
increasingly violent and macabre, with Carole's madness becoming more 
and more apparent.
As narrative the film works only part of the time, and as case study 
it may occasionally seem too obvious, but as subjective nightmare 
Repulsion is a stunning piece of filmmaking. Put together with expertly 
calibrated shocks and a gradually developing sense of dread, in many 
respects, this thriller became something of a template for many of 
Polanski's subsequent ventures into horror. His films are of isolation and 
claustrophobia and include such disparate works as The Tenant in 1976 
(in which Polanski played the starring role) and The Pianist over a quarter 
of a century later. Yet ironically, in his 1984 autobiography, Polanski wrote 
that he and his cowriter Gérard Brach regarded Repulsion mainly as "a 
means to an end"—namely, a commercial success to enable them to 
finance Cul-de-sac (1966), a much more personal, if less commercial, film 
in English that would star Deneuve's sister Françoise Dorléac.  JRos

Jean-Luc Godard's masterpiece Pierrot le fou is an important milestone 
in the director's long and brilliant career. A turning point of sorts, the film 
straddles the experimental élan of Godard works such as Breathless 
(1960) and My Life to Live (1962) and the highly politicized, cynical, and 
bitterly funny films like Week End (1967) and Wind from the East (1969). 
Pierrot le fou contains elements of both, and is a rich viewing experience 
for this reason alone. But one thing the film also possesses, in spades, is 
a sense of true beauty. Critics tend to forget that Godard, for all his 
polemicism, made some exquisitely beautiful films. Pierrot le fou must 
surely be considered alongside Contempt (1963) in this regard.
Godard always had a love-hate relationship with Hollywood. For him, 
American films are at once the most beautiful and honest, but also the 
most crass and ugly. As in many of his works, Godard uses American "low" 
culture and genre filmmaking as his launching pad: Pierrot le fou is 
(extremely) loosely based on pulp novelist Lionel White's Obsession, 
and it features an extended cameo by underappreciated Hollywood 
maverick and Godard favorite Samuel Fuller. The very fact that the film 
was shot in Techniscope by the great Raoul Coutard is a comment on 
the manufactured grandeur of so many Hollywood prestige pictures of 
the 1950s and 1960s. If you know Hollywood cinema from this era, watching 
Pierrot le fou can be an immensely rewarding, if confounding, experience, 
for satire in Godard is never quite as plain as one might expect.
Pierrot is bitter, satirical, humorous, and beautiful—but perhaps its 
most charming (and arresting) feature is its sheer outrageousness. 
Ferdinand/Pierrot and Marianne (Godard's regulars Jean-Paul Belmondo 
and Anna Karina) move deliriously from one ridiculous situation to 
another—be it the world's most insufferable party, a free-for-all with 
gas station attendants, or a bizarrely uplifting self-immolation. Almost 
anything is possible in this film, yet it still manages to surprise, even upon 
repeated viewings. The potency of Godard's imagery and satire has not 
diminished with age. If anything, it is even more relevant today.  EdeS

Subarnarekha  Ritwik Ghatak, 1965
Golden River
A native of Dhaka, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), Ghatak was twenty-two 
at the time of the Partition, the trauma that defined him as an artist. 
Golden River begins in a colony of impoverished Bengali refugees in 
Calcutta with news of Gandhi's assassination. Ishwar Chakraborty (Abhi 
Bhattacharya) is rearing a young daughter and an abandoned boy—so 
when an affluent college friend offers him a post in a provincial factory, 
he accepts it to secure their future, at the cost of his broader aspirations.
Years pass. When the boy, Abhiram (Satindra Bhattacharya), returns 
from college an aspiring writer, it emerges that he is in love with his half-
sister Shita (Madhabi Mukherjee), and she with him. The declaration of 
love is a haunting example of Ghatak's innovative experiments with sound: 
The words are drawn out of the young man in a whisper that seems to 
bypass his mouth entirely—passion straight from the heart. Of course 
Ishwar opposes his children's union, though this is complicated by the 
revelation that Abhiram is of low caste, and unworthy of his daughter. A 
good man watches appalled as everything his life has stood for unravels. 
The American filmmaker has not been born who can match Ghatak 
for the cinematic expression of utter, unadulterated anguish. He is 
especially sensitive to the fate of the marginalized: women, the young, 
the old, and the insane. From the ruins of these lives, Ghatak unearths a 
shimmering mirage of hope.  TCh
George Kuchar's first 16mm color film is a charming and melodramatic 
tour de force of underground invention. The most popular of the hundreds 
of films Kuchar has made since the late 1950s, this 1966 low-budget short 
tells the story of an endearing loser of a filmmaker (Kuchar) who battles 
bouts of depression and loneliness in his attempt to make a film. When 
his voluptuous starlet (the tantalizing Donna Kerness) finds passion in 
the shower, Kuchar's self-pity and alienation achieve even greater depths.
Like many of George and twin brother Mike's Bronx-made Hollywood 
epics, Hold Me While I'm Naked attains a level of emotional seriousness 
that makes it stand out among the camp and trash Hollywood parodies 
to which it is inevitably compared. This is due in large part to Kuchar's 
technical and creative skills: his stunning title and production design; his 
ingenious inventory of odd, unflattering camera angles; and his insatiable 
talent at adapting the glamorous concerns and emotional extremes of 
Hollywood flicks to the banal realities and human proportions of his 
neighborhood friends. A colorful example of Kuchar's resourcefulness, 
Hold Me While I'm Naked has incited many a viewer—John Waters among 
them—to mobilize friends for their own glorious screen epics.  MS

1966
With its unremitting portrait of an older married couple who draw a 
young husband and wife into their destructive love/hate games, Edward 
Albee's Broadway smash of the early 1960s was at first considered too 
brutal in terms of language and theme to be brought to the screen 
because of Production Code restrictions. But by the middle of the decade, 
Hollywood was abandoning the code in favor of a ratings system that 
would permit the exhibition of more adult dramas, and Mike Nichols's 
adaptation of Albee's play was among the first to appear on screens 
(theater owners were asked not to admit anyone under eighteen, as the 
new ratings categories had not yet been finalized).
Nichols's version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is an important part 
of another trend—the move, in part, away from traditional entertainment 
toward a greater seriousness that would characterize the "Hollywood 
Renaissance" of the late 1960s and 1970s. Filmed in black and white and 
based on a fine screenplay by Ernest Lehman that keeps much of the 
play's dialogue, Nichols, who came to Hollywood from stage directing, 
preserves the essence of Albee's original. The casting was an extraordinary 
coup, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, cast as George and 
Martha, whose unremitting verbal and mental fencing constitutes the 
main action. George is a history professor at the local college and Martha 
the daughter of its president; they invite a younger faculty member (George 
Segal) and his wife (Sandy Dennis) for a late evening of mental games: 
first "Humiliate the Host," but then, more destructively, "Get the Guests." 
In this unequal contest, the young couple comes off second best, with 
the less-than-honorable aspects of their marriage laid bare and the young 
man's confidence in himself severely shaken. Of the many attempts to 
use the Burtons effectively in a film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is by 
far the most successful, as Nichols elicited the best performance of the 
actress's career and Burton is effective as a weak man possessed of 
enormous emotional strength and an inexhaustible capacity to love. The 
film richly deserved its five Academy Awards; it is certainly one of the 
finest adaptations of a stage play ever produced.  RBP

Blowup  Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966
After a run of masterpieces—from L'avventura (1960) to Il deserto rosso 
(1964)—revolving around jaded Italian upper-class ennui and Monica 
Vitti, Michelangelo Antonioni became an international filmmaker with 
this 1966 picture. Based on a short story by Julio Cortazar, Blowup 
follows L'avventura in offering a mystery with no solution but goes even 
further by wondering, after a great deal of obsessive investigation, 
whether there even was a mystery outside the protagonist's mind. 
Turning his outsider's eye on a London that was just beginning to swing, 
Antonioni captures precisely a time and a place that seemed culturally 
significant. As with Fellini's La dolce vita (1960), a film intended as a 
satirical attack on a certain type of modern sophistication and emptiness 
emerges almost as a celebration of the fashions, mores, music, sexuality, 
and strangeness of a world it would like to disapprove of.
The central character is Thomas (David Hemmings), a photographer 
who—perhaps like Antonioni—divides his time between assault-like 
sessions with vapidly lovely fashion models and vérité work among 
down-and-outs. Snapping away in an eerily unpopulated park in the 
hopes of finding a peaceful image to conclude his latest book, Thomas 
gets some shots that seem to show an older man and a younger woman 
(Vanessa Redgrave) having an innocent, quiet moment. However, the 
woman pursues Thomas and demands he hand over the film, then turns 
up at his studio to press her case with a jittery, neurotic flirtatiousness 
that further piques the terminally cool Thomas's interest. He palms her 
off with the wrong film and develops his photographs; under extreme 
analysis, he seems to find a man with a gun lurking in the undergrowth 
catching the woman's panicky or complicit eye. Another photograph 
shows a vague form that might be a body, and another visit to the park 
reveals an actual corpse—but then all the evidence is taken away and 
Thomas loses his conviction that he has latched onto a murder and 
surrenders to the distractions that clutter his life.
Despite its thriller-style hook (often hommaged in straighter suspense 
films like Coppola's The Conversation [1974] or De Palma's Blow Out 
[1981]), this is less a mystery than a portrait of swinging alienation. In 
1966, when nudity in English-language films wasn't commonplace, there 
was a real charge to Redgrave taking off her blouse and lounging around 
the studio with her arms crossed over her breasts, not to mention the 
notorious (and actually rather tactful) sequence in which Thomas 
grapples on the floor with a pair of gawky, giggling groupies. Most of all, 
this is a film about an alien world: the creepily unvisited park, a concert 
(featuring The Yardbirds) where the audience stand impassive until a 
guitar is smashed and they erupt into a feeding frenzy, a pot party where 
Thomas searches for someone he is then unable to explain anything to, 
and a game of tennis between student mimes that leads to an ambiguous 
finish as Thomas is drawn into the game by returning a lost "ball."  KN

Sedmikrasky  Vera Chytilová, 1966
Daisies
Surely one of the most exhilarating stylistic and psychedelic cinematic 
explosions of the 1960s, Vera Chytilová's Daisies is a madcap and 
aggressive feminist farce that explodes in any number of directions. 
Although many American and Western European filmmakers during this 
period prided themselves on their subversiveness, it is possible that the 
most radical film of the decade, ideologically as well as formally, came 
from the East—from the liberating ferment building toward the short-
lived political reforms of 1968's Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia.
Daisies features two uninhibited seventeen-year-olds named Marie 
(Jitka Cerhová and Ivana Karbanová) whose various escapades, which 
add up less to a plot than to a string of outrageous set pieces, include 
several antiphallic gags (such as slicing up cucumbers and bananas), a 
penchant for exploiting dirty old men, and a free-for-all with fancy food 
(rivaling Laurel and Hardy) that got Chytilová in trouble with the 
authorities. This disturbing yet liberating tour de force shows what this 
talented director can do with freedom. A major influence on Jacques 
Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974), Daisies is chock-full of female 
giggling, which might be interpreted in context as what critic Ruby Rich 
has called the laughter of Medusa: subversive, bracing, energizing, and 
rather off-putting (if challenging) to most male spectators.  JRos

Da zui xia  King Hu, 1966
Come Drink With Me
Long before there was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) there was 
the great King Hu, a master director who, beginning with his Come Drink 
with Me, helped revolutionize the martial arts costume drama by 
introducing a female lead. After a young official is kidnapped, the 
authorities send a magnificent but mysterious swordswoman named 
Golden Swallow (Cheng Pei-pei) to rescue him. Aided by Drunken Cat, a 
kung fu master disguised as a beggar, Golden Swallow hatches a daring 
plan to assault the corrupt monastery where the official is being held.
The film is a visual tour de force, each sequence meticulously 
designed by King Hu into a feast of color, movement, and high-flying 
action. Yet despite its great charm, this is still early King Hu; his mastery 
of all aspects of the medium, especially his inimitable approach to 
editing, would only be perfected in later masterworks such as A Touch 
of Zen (1971). Young star Cheng Pei-pei, who wields a sword like nobody 
before or perhaps after her, perfectly combines steely determination 
with a kind of touching fragility; despite her prowess, there's always a 
hint that each battle may be her last. She would go on to a  successful 
career in Hong Kong cinema and would win great acclaim for her return 
to the screen as the evil Nanny in Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger.  RP

Seconds  John Frankenheimer, 1966
Thomas Wolfe once said, "You can't go home again," and anyone familiar 
with John Frankenheimer's Faustian vision of alienation in suburban 
America would understand this only too well. Long ignored in 
mainstream criticism, Seconds has achieved the status of a cult classic.
Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is offered a chance to leave his 
middle-class emotional isolation for a new life, provided he undergoes 
radical surgery and lets go of his past. This miracle is offered by a sinister 
organization known simply as the company, populated by blacklisted 
character actors who all but steal the film, including Will Greer as the old 
man with all the answers and Jeff Corey as the salesman from hell who 
zestfully explains how Hamilton will become the handsome and talented 
painter Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson). Once the transformation is effected, 
Seconds becomes a Kafkaesque nightmare as our reborn protagonist 
fails to adjust to the bohemian lifestyle provided by the company.
The real star here is seasoned cinematographer James Wong Howe, 
whose distorted lenses and offbeat camera angles earned him an Oscar 
nomination and made Seconds one of the great black-and-white films 
of the late 1960s. Jerry Goldsmith created one of the most unsettling 
scores ever used in a psychodrama, creating a surreal mood from the 
opening credits to the paranoid ending.  DDV

Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo  Sergio Leone, 1966
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
By the mid-1960s, Hollywood had grown largely tired of the Western, 
which was increasingly viewed as a stodgy and hokey relic of another 
era. Sure, the films remained essential elements of movie history, but the 
times were changing and Westerns no longer appeared to have a firm 
place in popular culture. Sergio Leone thought differently. The Italian 
director sensed that the moribund genre was ripe for reinvention, and 
the enduring influence of his so-called spaghetti Westerns (nicknamed 
for both the Italian location shoots as well as the copious blood) 
demonstrates that he was right.
Leone had worked on a handful of films before inviting then relative 
unknown Clint Eastwood over to Italy to remake Akira Kurosawa's 
Yojimbo (1961)—itself based on Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest—
into the first of his iconic "man with no name" Westerns, A Fistful of Dollars 
(1964). Shot on a shoestring budget, the stylish, innovative film became 
a huge success, and Leone followed it with For a Few Dollars More (1965), 
which also starred Eastwood as another laconic and anonymous antihero.
The third part of his "man with no name" trilogy, The Good, the Bad, 
and the Ugly, is what really confirmed Leone's reputation in cinematic 
legend. Set during the American Civil War, the film follows three rogues 
who, although clearly identified as each of the title's categories, really 
blur the line between them. Eastwood returns, this time as a crooked 
bounty hunter (ostensibly the Good) who repeatedly captures (and then 
releases) outlaw Eli Wallach (the Ugly) in order to drive up the price on 
his head. Following a sadistic falling out, the erstwhile partners team up 
again in search of stolen Confederate gold, but the opportunistic, amoral 
Lee Van Cleef (the Bad) complicates their quest.
Leone isn't terribly interested in plot—The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly 
embraces purely cinematic elements of filmmaking. He carefully 
composes each widescreen image like he's painting a great landscape, 
frequently indulging himself in extreme close-ups—sometimes little 
more than a character's eyes. Leone propels the story forward with 
radical editing techniques, often cut to the rhythms of Ennio Morricone's 
famous score, pairing odd instrumentation and electric guitars to more 
traditional orchestration. Style drips from each frame like the sweat 
pouring down his stars' faces.
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly literally comes down to the faces of 
Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef, as the mutual antagonists perform a 
three-way duel in an old graveyard. The scene has since become one of 
the most imitated and parodied in motion picture history. Morricone's 
hypnotic score intensifies with quickening film cuts from face to face, 
capturing each set of squinting eyes, each hand reaching for a gun. Camp 
and kitsch and utterly entrancing, the work is of a master rewriting the 
rules of the Western to suit Leone's own unique vision.  JKl

Persona  Ingmar Bergman, 1966
As with other prominent examples of 1960s European art-cinema 
narration, much of the critical discussion of Ingmar Bergman's Persona 
has portrayed it as obscure and beyond words. True, the director wanted 
his film to be a visual poem, and he composed the famous opening credit 
sequence to underline this. However, even in this dense, associative 
montage, most of the images are recognizable as references to familiar 
Bergman motifs: the Spider-God (spider), the Christian legacy (crucifixion, 
lamb to slaughter), art/illusion as construction (the film's title, details of 
a film projector, the film-within-the-film from the 1949 film Prison), the 
cold womb (a morgue interior with the young boy from the 1964 film 
The Silence naked and reaching toward a cold and distant "mom"). This 
sequence functions as a prelude summing up Bergman's artistic profile, 
as if he wished to take stock and then clear the slate for a fresh artistic 
start. Indeed, the whole film can be seen as a journey to an existential 
and aesthetic dead end, one where identity, meaning, and language 
finally collapse, destroying Bergman's art itself as the film strip stops in 
its tracks, melts, and breaks before starting again.
Superficially the plot of Persona is constructed as a variation of the 
female power game in August Strindberg's chamber play The Stronger. 
Initially, the stronger of the two women in the film appears to be 
psychiatric nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson), especially because she appears 
certain of herself and does all the talking. But faced with this enigmatic 
patient, famous actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), in an isolated 
summer cottage on a remote island, Alma's own seemingly stable, down-
to-earth world-view begins to crumble. Her therapeutic talks turn into 
confessions of her own hidden secrets and desires. Gradually she is 
stripped of her own persona, the mask of lies and self-deception that 
makes up her identity and provides her life with a sense of meaning.
Persona's climax comes in the famous scene where the two women 
sit opposite each other dressed in identical black clothes. Alma begins 
to talk about Elisabet's rejection of motherhood and marriage, but soon 
finds herself talking about her own doubts concerning the family life she 
previously envisioned. Realizing this, she struggles to regain control with 
new words of certainty, but her construction of language breaks down 
and she can only utter incoherent phrases. It is at this point that Bergman 
uses the optical effect of fusing the two women's faces into one haunting 
image, a horrific vision of identity in a total state of decomposition.
The film logically ends with Alma doing the only thing she can to 
reconstruct her sense of self: She returns to the ordinary world that 
defines her and rejects Elisabet as the Other. In their final scene together 
we are back at the hospital from the opening of the drama. Alma, now 
back in her old uniform and persona, forces Elisabet to repeat the word 
"nothing." Cut back to the boy at the morgue—Elisabet's unwanted child? 
Alma's aborted fetus?—and then the projector stops. Darkness.  MT

Robert Bresson's penultimate black-and-white film—a companion piece 
to the 1967 film Mouchette—is a study in saintliness, a powerful and 
poignant tale of wickedness and suffering, and a grim look at the innate 
cruelty and destructive impulses of man. By treating the eponymous 
donkey as a symbol of purity, virtue, and salvation, and by giving his 
picture a simple yet effective episodic structure, Bresson invests Balthazar 
with a remarkable intensity that is only enhanced by the stark visual style.
Balthazar is an oft-exploited donkey who gets passed from owner to 
owner, in the process experiencing and observing all manner of human 
good and evil. His harsh and sorrowful existence is paralleled by that of 
Marie (Anne Wiazemsky), a reserved young woman who becomes 
involved with a cruel and sadistic man, Gerard (François Lafarge), who 
eventually rejects her. Toward the end of his difficult life, however, the 
former children's pet, circus attraction, and beast of burden becomes the 
property of a gentle old miller who views him as a reincarnated saint.
Bresson's film has been labeled by at least one critic as "the zenith of 
purity in the cinema." But the highest praise of all comes from Andrew 
Sarris in his Village Voice review: "[Balthazar] stands alone atop one of the 
loftiest pinnacles of artistically-realized emotional experiences."  SJS

Masculin, féminin  Jean-Luc Godard, 1966
Masculine-Feminine
From the start of his career, there has been scarcely anything resembling 
conventional dialogue in the films of Jean-Luc Godard; back-and-forth 
banter between characters takes the form of interviews or inquisitions. 
By the time of Masculine-Feminine, this was a rigorous principle. What 
gives the film its bleakness is the sense that people cannot even 
talk to each other anymore except through pop-quizzes, aggressive 
interrogations, or "celebrity" profiling. And Godard's clean, reportage way 
of filming such exchanges—this is the least lyrical of his black-and-white 
works—increases the isolation of the characters in their existential cells.
Godard conceived this film—much to the chagrin of youth audiences 
then—as an unempathetic, sociological investigation. Its view of gender 
roles verges on the misanthropic: Girls are empty glamor-bunnies, 
would-be pop stars, pawns of a consumerist society; boys are posturing, 
graceless, wannabe revolutionaries. All their stated ideals seem as empty 
and transient as their intimate relationships; here, Godard anticipated 
Jean Eustache's The Mother and the Whore (1973).
And yet there remains something affecting, the fleeting residue 
of Godardian poetry: Amid the public confusion there is private reverie, 
the melancholy of solitude, given immortal expression in the darting 
eyes of Jean-Pierre Léaud and his inner thoughts while transfixed at 
the movies.  AM

On the day that John F. Kennedy was shot, Bruce Conner started 
recording images of the assassination off his TV set onto Super 8. Four 
years of obsessive reworking and reediting of the found footage resulted 
in the thirteen-minute Report, an avant-garde classic. 
On the soundtrack, we hear the television and radio commentaries 
of that day, relating the event with rising hysteria. On the image track, 
however, Conner withholds the violence. At the point of death we see a 
white screen and then a violent, flickering alternation of black-and-white 
frames. Hundreds of representational images return, from newsreels, 
ads, cartoons, and fiction films, montaged in a frantic free association.
It is as if Conner had instantly intuited, from that first TV moment, 
that henceforth our entire relation to this event would be through 
images and sounds recorded and disseminated by the mass media—and 
that our obsession with making sense of it would happen through an 
endless replay of that footage. Report correctly predicted two polarized 
responses to the Kennedy assassination: either to be frustrated by the 
lack of anything to truthfully see in the audiovisual archive; or to see too 
much, imagining one conspiracy after another, Oliver Stone-style.  AM

Deux ou trois choses que je sais d'elle  
Two or Three Things I Know About Her
Jean-Luc Godard, 1967
Two or Three Things I Know About Her is one of several Jean-Luc Godard 
films that take prostitution as a metaphor for life in the modern capitalist 
state. For Godard, a woman selling herself for money provides a perfect 
image of how what is most personal and life-enhancing—the sexual 
act—becomes, like everything else, a commodity. The human being 
becomes alienated from herself, a mere thing to be bought and sold.
My Life to Live (1962) had been an earlier essay on this theme by 
Godard, in which the heroine becomes a full-time prostitute, with tragic 
results. Two or Three Things was sparked off by some articles in a French 
magazine that investigated the phenomenon of suburban housewives 
who engage in part-time prostitution to make ends meet. The film begins 
by presenting a shot of a woman at the window of her flat. Godard's own 
voice on the soundtrack informs us that she is Marina Vlady. "She is an 
actress. She's wearing a sweater with yellow stripes. She is of Russian 
origin. She has got fair hair, or maybe light brown. I'm not quite sure." The 
sequence thus announces a number of characteristic motifs. First, the 
Brechtian technique of separating the actor from the role, to make the 
audience question the nature of the fiction being narrated. Godard 
repeats the shot from another angle, this time describing the character, 
not the actress: "She is Juliette Janson. She lives here. She is wearing a 
sweater. . . ." Second, direct address by the director is another Godardian 
technique for distancing the spectator from the action, preventing a 
too-close identification with the fiction. Third, the hesitancy ("I'm not 
quite sure") raises a doubt about the accuracy of what we see. The film 
uses some of the techniques of the documentary, but constantly 
intervenes to create a gap between images and their meaning.
The sequence described above is not quite the opening of the film, 
which starts with views of the city of Paris. It is Paris who is the "Her" 
referred to in the title. Not for the first or last time, Godard investigates 
the nature of modern urban living. One of his targets is consumerism 
and the artificial stimulation of the desire for material goods, which 
produces the need for more and more money and hence leads to 
prostitution. Godard fills the screen with colorful images of objects (cups 
of coffee, cars, tins of food), rendering them at once alluring and absurd.
Overlaid on the brightly colored surface of the film, part documentary, 
part fiction, is another discourse, about world events. Juliette's husband 
(Roger Montsoret) is a radio ham, who sits at home listening to news of 
the Vietnam War, and her small son has a dream in which North and 
South Vietnam are united. Godard's revolutionary politics, at this stage 
marked by a kind of knee-jerk anti-Americanism, would soon turn to fully 
fledged Maoism, but his intellectual playfulness and curiosity about the 
nature of cinema endow Two or Three Things with enduring appeal.  EB

Luis Buñuel unfussily described Belle de jour as "pornographic," but added 
that it explored "chaste eroticism." Indeed, it is probably the last great sex 
film of the 1960s before greater permissiveness and (temporarily) relaxed 
censorship regulations created a new graphicness in erotic portrayals.
Belle de jour is a prime 1960s artifact in another way too: Alongside 
such movies as Breathless and La dolce vita (both 1960) that have enjoyed 
worldwide re-releases since the 1990s, it captures a certain "style" of the 
era in its smallest details of speech, gesture, dress, and attitude.
Belle de jour is a sublimely fetishistic movie. Buñuel cares not for 
Catherine Deneuve's nakedness, but for the clothes and veils that cover 
it, and for her polished and glazed feminine surface. Although the film 
revolves around a high-class brothel, sex is never shown. Taking place 
behind closed doors, within secret nooks, and even in one hilarious scene 
under a coffin, the sexual perversions hinted at defy the imagination.
Deneuve plays Séverine Serizy, a bourgeois wife who is frigid (perhaps 
even virginal) with her husband Pierre (Jean Sorel). She eventually 
assumes a double life on weekday afternoons as a prostitute. Here 
she feels safe, it seems, to explore her prodigious, masochistic sexual 
fantasies. However, the neatness of her system is overturned when a 
flamboyantly seedy gangster (Pierre Clementi) both wins her heart and 
intrudes into her respectable life.
Summarized like this, Belle de jour may seem a schematic, preposterous 
male fantasy. In fact, it is one of the most mysterious, poetic, complex, 
and beguiling films ever made. No character's psychology is ever rendered 
simply or clearly. Nor is the nature of the everyday world they inhabit.
Quietly but surely, Buñuel leads us into a strange territory poised 
perfectly between dream and reality. Hallucinatory effects that are 
both funny and disturbing fill the film—such as different characters 
referring ominously to "letting in the cats" that we hear but never see. 
Well before the extraordinary final scene, viewers who are open to this 
seductive, dreamlike texture will no longer expect to know what is really 
happening—a sweet liberation indeed.  AM

costumes in Belle de jour were

Cool Hand Luke  Stuart Rosenberg, 1967
There are stars and then there are actors like Paul Newman, whose iconic 
presence and piercing blue eyes regularly transcend even the best 
material in which he works. The cocky gait of Cool Hand Luke may 
wobble from time to time, but Newman's magnetic personality lends the 
film the weight its relatively simple story struggles nobly to support. 
Shot in stunning widescreen by Conrad Hall (all the better to capture the 
glint of the high noon sun and the glistening, shirtless prisoners of a 
chain gang), Stuart Rosenberg's film ambitiously vacillates from a 
straightforward antiauthoritarian story to a macho tall tale and winds 
up ultimately as a somewhat curious and incomplete Christ allegory.
That it falls awkwardly somewhere in between should surprise no 
one, but Cool Hand Luke remains thoroughly engaging all the same. 
Newman plays an enigmatically recalcitrant everyday guy, Lucas "Cool 
Hand" Jackson, thrown into prison for rebelliously cutting the tops off 
parking meters. Once incarcerated, he unsurprisingly butts against an 
even more stubborn system of rules, and as his trouble-making stoicism 
grows more disruptive, the punishments doled out to him grow more 
severe. Filled with quotable lines and memorable scenes, Cool Hand Luke 
exists as an iconic work in and of itself, deceptively light in meaning but 
definitely full of cultural (and countercultural) significance.
Indeed, several lines from the film have entered the cinema lexicon (the 
menacing understatement "What we have here is failure to communicate," 
for one), whereas scenes like the egg-eating bet and a prison yard fistfight 
are the stuff of movie legend. A great deal of Cool Hand Luke's considerable 
charm stems from its colorful cast of supporting actors, a contingent of 
notable faces that include a young Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, 
and George Kennedy as Newman's rival turned right-hand man.
Kennedy took home the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor 
for his portrayal of the ultimately naive tough guy Dragline. But at the 
heart of the film is Newman's quietly charismatic performance, which 
showcased the actor at the top of his game and propelled him toward 
the peak of his popularity. Compared to Jack Nicholson's scenery-
chewing performance in the oddly similar One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest (1975), Newman in Cool Hand Luke is all subtle, knowing smiles 
and beaming confidence. Short on soliloquies, Newman's Luke doesn't 
telegraph his every move or even clarify his motives. He seems almost 
to have sought out prison as an arbitrary challenge, inviting a conflict 
with the system just to see if he can win. In fact, it isn't until close to the 
film's conclusion that the toll imprisonment has taken on the free-spirited 
Luke becomes clearer. Unlike the rest of the prisoners, Luke steadfastly 
rejects the institutional conformity that comes with confinement, and 
his uncooperative stance ultimately leads to tragedy. If Cool Hand Luke 
is partly about how far one man can push the system, it's also about what 
happens when that same system pushes back.  JKl

Playtime  Jacques Tati, 1967
Playtime is less a film than one man's successful attempt to encourage us 
to see with new eyes. Indeed, director Jacques Tati's timeless masterpiece 
is concerned, from start to finish, with imbuing the viewer with a totally 
new set of sensory experiences. Like no other movie, Playtime has the 
power to make us question our very faculties of eyes and ears.
Known for years as the bumbling Monsieur Hulot in such great works 
as Mr. Hulot's Holiday (1953) and My Uncle (1958), Tati was far more than 
a clown, though he played that role with aplomb. Tati's comic work is a 
bridge between silent and sound film, between vaudeville and the 
modern era. But it is for his visual sensibilities that he is best remembered. 
The gags in his films aren't really gags at all, but odd little moments that 
add up to an overall tone of a world being slightly askew. When there 
are enough such moments—and they are crammed into literally every 
corner of Playtime's unbelievably dense mise-en-scène—we begin to 
realize that they are not there to make us laugh so much as to make us 
consider our roles as viewers.
Playtime takes place in a cold, clinical version of a futuristic city, and 
the fiercely rectilinear sets were built from the ground up, at great 
expense. Playtime was an immensely costly film and its box-office returns 
were minuscule, which kept Tati in hock for a decade after its release. 
"Tativille" is one of the great achievements of set design—or of 
megalomania, depending on your perspective. The set had its own roads, 
electrical systems, and one of the office buildings even had a working 
elevator. And not since the days of German Expressionism had a director 
achieved so much with forced perspective, carefully building to scale in 
order to make something look much farther away than it is.
The world of Tativille is clinical, harsh, and sterile, but Hulot, who 
wanders through it all with bemused detachment, occasionally finds 
little patches of organic matter. He finds a flower vendor, for example, 
who brings a little color to this gray city; and Hulot alone is able to make 
sense of the bizarrely designed streetlights by likening their shape to 
that of a tiny bouquet. Playtime has much to say about clinical modernity 
impinging upon older, more earthy ways of life. On one level, the film is 
about how modern city living has the potential to crush any shred of 
individuality one may still possess.
Playtime's elaborate visual jokes are far, far too numerous to recount 
here. Suffice it to say that almost every single object of modern 
existence—televisions, cars, supermarkets, airports, vacuum cleaners—
is given new life and new form here as a comic object.
All the patterns in Playtime come to a head in the incredible restaurant 
scene, which lasts forty-five minutes and which is so visually and sonically 
dense that repeated viewings are absolutely essential. But repeated 
viewings are simply more occasions for pleasure. No film offers so rich a 
viewing experience as Playtime.  EdeS

This 1967 feature was one of the first by Hungarian filmmaker Miklós 
Jancsó to have some impact in the United States, and the stylistic 
virtuosity, ritualistic power, and sheer beauty of his work are already fully 
apparent here. In this black-and-white pageant, set during the aftermath 
of the Russian Revolution, the reds are the revolutionaries and the whites 
are the government forces ordered to crush them. Working in elaborately 
choreographed long takes with often spectacular vistas, Jancsó invites 
us to study the mechanisms of power almost abstractly, with a cold 
eroticism that may glancingly suggest some of the subsequent work of 
Stanley Kubrick. But this shouldn't mislead one into concluding that 
Jancsó is any way detached from either politics or emotions.
For one thing, the markedly nationalistic elements in The Red and the 
White could be, and were, interpreted as anti-Russian, especially if one 
considers that the film was made less than a decade after the Soviet 
repression of the Hungarian Revolution. And significantly, although the 
film was a Hungarian-Russian coproduction, the Russian authorities 
refused to show the film in the Soviet Union.
Jancsó's preference for long shots can't be translated into any sort of 
disdain for his actors. József Madaras, one of Jancsó's regular actors, has 
explained that "with him, the actor's face plays a subordinate role: 
He will formulate and express the psyche through the movements of 
human masses. That's what audiences, accustomed to conventional 
representations, may find strange. But he insists on fully creative 
collaboration from his actors—only in a manner departing from the 
conventional. He'll never psychologize, never analyze. He makes you 
move. And from the way he keeps you moving I can figure out what he 
wants me to do, how he visualizes a character. He thinks in terms of music 
and sees in terms of rhythm."
If you have never encountered Jancsó's work, this is an ideal place to 
start. He may well be the key Hungarian filmmaker of the sound era, and 
later figures such as Béla Tarr would be inconceivable without him.  JRos

The Graduate  Mike Nichols, 1967
As unlikely as it sounds today, The Graduate struck many moviegoers as 
daring, even a bit scandalous when it opened in 1967. Never before had 
a high-profile Hollywood film taken such a candid look at sex in the 
suburbs or focused on a more unlikely romantic trio: a college grad with 
too much time on his hands, an alcoholic housewife who's determined 
to get into his pants, and her daughter, a quintessentially nice girl who 
has no idea her main sexual rival is her own predatory parent. If any 
mainstream movie hammered the last nail into the coffin of midcentury 
"momism," this was it. Neither motherhood, suburbia, nor the suffocating 
fog of postwar middle-class mores would ever seem quite the same.
The creative team behind The Graduate was as fresh as its subject 
and style. Mike Nichols had made a strong impression with his only 
previous picture, the screen adaptation of Edward Albee's play Who's 
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). The Graduate offered him an even better 
opportunity to fuse his eye for sardonic details with the ear for razor-sharp 
verbal wit that he'd honed with Elaine May in the innovative comedy act 
that had made them synonymous with urban hipness. One of his most 
original ideas was to supplement a small amount of newly composed 
Simon and Garfunkel music (most notably "Mrs. Robinson") with previously 
recorded songs by the duo ("The Sounds of Silence," "Scarborough Fair/
Canticle") that were already loved by millions of teen and twenty-
something fans. He used their popularity as an additional selling point 
and, equally important, a signal that this film would plug into youth-
culture sensibilities more directly and sympathetically than any other of 
its time. The gambit worked aesthetically and commercially, influencing 
the music tracks of countless Hollywood pictures in years to come.
Dustin Hoffman became a star via his portrayal of Benjamin Braddock, 
the recently returned graduate stirred by a nebulous dread of his parents' 
empty-headed materialism. It's part of the movie's legend that Nichols 
instructed Hoffman to play the part without acting, and the unforced 
awkwardness of Ben's mannerisms is a key reason for the film's enduring 
emotional appeal. In a movie with many mythical moments, perhaps the 
one that has burrowed most deeply under America's pop-culture skin 
comes when Ben hears a family friend's one-word prescription for 
financial and professional happiness—"Plastics!"—and reacts with a blend 
of fear, loathing, and perplexity that's as understated as it is indelible.
The creatively chosen supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft as 
Mrs. Robinson, Katharine Ross as her daughter, Norman Fell as a landlord 
with a paranoid fear of what 1960s conservatives called "outside 
agitators," an uncredited Richard Dreyfuss as a roomer in his boarding 
house, and Buck Henry as a hotel clerk. Then a newcomer to feature 
films, Henry co-wrote the screenplay with Calder Willingham, based on 
Charles Webb's novel. Nichols turned their script into a key achievement 
of 1960s cinema.  DS

Based on Donald E. Westlake's 1964 novel The Hunter, John Boorman's 
thriller is as arrestingly and unselfconsciously stylish as the day it was 
released. Beginning with the trick of apparently killing off its main character, 
the two bullets that pierce Walker (Lee Marvin) set this masculine film—full 
of tough action and even tougher sexual circumstances—into action.
Walker is left for dead after being betrayed by his friend, gangster 
Mal Reese (the pock-marked John Vernon). Reese turns out to be the 
lover of Walker's wife. The bullet wounds healed, Walker wants the 
$93,000 Reese stole from him, as well as vengeance on his wife Lynne 
(Sharon Acker), Reese, and all his accomplices. Walker's scheme draws 
into its vortex Lynne's sister Chris (Angie Dickinson), who is bedded, 
abused, then abandoned. The long moment where she seduces Reese 
for Walker's revenge remains an agonizing and perversely sexual love 
scene, erotic yet gut-wrenchingly distasteful.
The perfect thriller in both form and vision, Boorman's use of 
widescreen to full effect—urban horizons appear bleak and wide; 
characters are thrown from one long end of the frame to another—means 
that Point Blank works as well on television as it does in the cinema.  KK

Les demoiselles de Rochefort  
The Young Girls of Rochefort  
Jacques Demy & Agnès Varda, 1967
463
The Young Girls of Rochefort, Jacques Demy's companion piece to his 
marvelous The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), accomplishes a goal that 
few other films have achieved, or even strived to attain. For two hours, 
it maintains a tone of unmitigated joy and exuberance.
Everything in this movie connotes happiness, buoyancy, and a joie 
de vivre that is unmatched in cinema. Even Umbrellas, which has an 
almost unrivaled capacity to amaze and impress, has plenty of moments 
where the sadness of the story runs counter to the vivaciousness of the 
imagery. Here there is no such tension. The colors leap from the frame 
and head right for the pleasure centers of the brain. Working once again 
with music maestro Michel Legrand, Demy conjures up a magical land 
where identically garbed sisters sing about the joys of being sisters, 
where a weekend-long local street fair becomes the apotheosis of love 
and happiness, and where the mundane act of crossing a bridge inspires 
carefully choreographed displays of frivolity.
Put simply, Young Girls will make you happier than almost any other 
film you can imagine. And this is no small achievement.  EdeS
Week End  Jean-Luc Godard, 1967
Week End might be the wildest and wooliest of all of Jean-Luc Godard's 
films—which is saying something. It's also one of his most audacious.
This is a film in which anything goes: A mundane phone conversation 
becomes an absurdly charming musical number, our heroes encounter 
fairy-tale characters in the woods, and main characters can meet grisly 
ends at, really, any time at all. Godard's decision to move from episode 
to bizarre episode was bold and highly influential. Radical filmmakers of 
all stripes and colors owe a great debt to Week End.
But "radical" is a somewhat unfortunate label for the film, for it connotes 
dire politicization and humorlessness. Rest assured that Week End suffers 
from neither of these problems. In fact, it's a deeply funny film, in part 
because of its political attitudes. The ability to blend the serious, the 
comic, the beautiful, and the absurd was but one of Godard's many gifts.
No discussion of Week End is complete without mention of its most 
famous shot—one of the most famous shots in cinema. Perhaps the film's 
centerpiece is the ten-minute or so tracking shot of the world's nastiest 
traffic jam—interrupted by Godard's irrepressible penchant for didactic, 
elliptical intertitles. This is no ordinary gridlock—Godard's nightmarish 
but hilarious version includes zoo animals, boats, the occasional picnic, 
and a hell of a lot of blood. But, as the director once famously said, it's 
nothing to worry about: It's really only red paint.  EdeS

1967
Jean-Pierre Melville had the flair to invent a quotation from the "Bushido 
Book of the Samurai" as an on-screen preface: "There is no greater solitude 
than the samurai's, unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle . . . perhaps. 
. . ." No further allusion to Japanese culture is required: That's enough to 
give Le samouraï an abstract, mythic, timeless air. It is a breathtaking 
work, stylized to the point of asphyxiation, in which the imaginary world 
of cinema beats reality hands down. No wonder filmmakers from John 
Woo to Paul Thomas Anderson via Quentin Tarantino and Walter Hill have 
plundered it as the veritable Bible of cool moves.
Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is a steely hit man for whom the adjective 
"hard-boiled" is an understatement. Methodical, asexual, and apparently 
amoral in his willingness to kill on command, Jef finds himself set up 
and pursued—like his namesake played by Robert Mitchum in Out of the 
Past (1947), he's "in a frame" and needs to go in and "look at the picture." 
His ultimate confrontation with the witness who could incriminate him 
exposes the enigma of his inner motivations throughout.
Melville's vision of Paris is filtered through his love of American film 
noir: jazz nightclubs with black singers, dark and rainy streets. The cops 
function as in a Fritz Lang film, mapping the city through intricate 
surveillance and tracking this elusive human blip. Yet the heady 
atmosphere of movie fantasy is balanced by Melville's legendary, 
maniacal attention to detail, which itself borders on the obsessiveness 
of a police procedural: The logistics of every gesture, of every movement 
around the city, are impeccably plotted and recorded.
It is hard to watch Le samouraï—largely without dialogue, in which 
every sound (such as the chirping bird in Jef's apartment, the roar of a 
car engine, or the clanking of a key ring) is isolated and heightened, in 
which actors pose like gorgeous mannequins (Delon here as porcelain 
as Catherine Deneuve in Belle de jour [1967])—without remembering 
Robert Bresson. Melville rejected the comparison, but it's true: Jef is 
almost an ascetic priest, animated by an inner calling.  AM

Ostensibly an archetype of minimalism, Wavelength is actually action-
packed. An experimental movie that acknowledges the conventions of 
mystery and narrative inherent in all cinema, it was designed to change 
the relationship the viewer has with the screen, forcing audiences to 
think through processes and factors that most films take for granted.
Director Michael Snow presents the whole film in a single shot, a 
forty-five-minute tracking shot across a large urban room to focus on a 
detail of a photograph (of waves) fixed to the far wall. It's a relentless 
film, witty at its own expense as it forces you to deal with physical space 
and the intrusions of the tiniest elements of human narrative. There's 
even an apparent murder as a man (Hollis Frampton) walks on during a 
commotion and falls dead, with a woman later showing up to discover 
the corpse and make a phone call and police sirens indicating the ripples 
of this event spreading, but by the time this melodrama is in swing, the 
camera has tracked in so far that the big picture is no longer available. 
We are too close to the wall to comprehend what has taken place.
Though Wavelength consists of a single shot, it is not a single take: 
On the voyage across the room, filmstock, color processes, and lighting 
change; meanwhile, a sine wave on the soundtrack progresses from its 
lowest note (50 cycles per second) to its highest (12,000 cycles) with 
snatches of The Beatles ("Strawberry Fields Forever") mixed in. Like much 
underground and experimental cinema, Wavelength is easy to parody as 
pretentious, but it is still a vital, important, and necessary work.  KN

Ostre sledované vlaky  Jiří Menzel, 1967
Closely Watched Trains
With its bittersweet humor, lovingly observed detail, and ruefully 
affectionate humanism, Closely Watched Trains stands as the epitome of 
the cinema of the Czech New Wave. It was Jiří Menzel's first full-length 
feature and, like much of his early work, was adapted from the writings 
of the Czech novelist Bohumil Hrabal. The relationship between the 
writer and the director, who collaborated together on the script, was 
exceptionally close and cordial; Menzel, accepting his Oscar for Best 
Foreign Language Film, attributed all the credit to the novelist, whereas 
Hrabal always maintained he preferred the film to the original.
Trains takes as its main narrative thread the sentimental education 
of a timid, sensitive adolescent lad. Miloš, played by Václav Neckář, with 
a wondering gaze that often recalls Buster Keaton, is touchingly proud 
of his new uniform as a station guard that will allow him "to stand on a 
platform and avoid hard work." Yearningly in love with a conductress on 
a local train, he plunges into despair when nervousness causes his failure 
to consummate. His role model is his older colleague, the cynical and 
tirelessly randy Hubička (Josef Somr), who spends his time either quietly 
undermining authority or pursuing every female who crosses his path.
This theme—though freshly and beguilingly observed—would be 
conventional enough were it not for the setting: a sleepy backwater 
railroad station during the last years of World War II. The war, ever present 
but at first largely disregarded, gradually comes to overshadow events, 
adding layers of complexity and tragedy to Miloš's story. By approaching 
this period from an oblique angle, Menzel's intention was to deconstruct 
the heroic myth of war, "because most films, whether they mean to or 
not, glamorize the war." Trains doesn't deal in heroes: Hubička is far more 
concerned with his amorous adventures than with his contribution to 
the Resistance, for example, and Miloš gets involved largely by accident.
Likewise, nobody is demonized: A group of German soldiers, wistfully 
eyeing a train-load of pretty nurses, are not strutting, fascist beasts but 
homesick youngsters; and the pro-Nazi Czech collaborator, Counselor 
Zedniček (Vlastimil Brodský), is more fool than villain. A side-glance at 
the Soviet domination of Czechoslovakia is never insisted upon, but 
would have been picked up by domestic audiences at the time.
The spirit of The Good Soldier Švejk, embodiment of the Czech genius 
for smiling insubordination and dumb insolence, hovers over the film—
never more so than in the station staff's straight-faced response to 
Zedníček's explanation of how the Wehrmacht's retreat on all fronts is in 
fact a brilliant tactic to ensure victory. Like Hašek's classic novel, Closely 
Watched Trains blends comedy, tragedy, and farce, eroticism and satire, 
naturalism and absurdity, into a highly idiosyncratic and beguiling mix. 
And, thanks to Hrabal, Menzel let himself be persuaded not to soften the 
novel's tragic ending.  PK

be about serious things.

serious things too

playing the role of Miloš himself, but 
in the end concluded he was too old.

On April 1, 1964, a military coup took over Brazil, ushering in a twenty-
five-year-long dictatorship. For the very active and vocal Brazilian Left, 
the biggest shock of the takeover was not that it happened, but how 
quickly and bloodlessly the civilian government fell. This gnawing 
combination of rage, guilt, and depression curiously led to a number of 
remarkable cinematic meditations on politics, violence, and the role of 
intellectuals in both. Glauber Rocha's Earth Entranced was perhaps the 
finest example of this impressive crop.
In a land called Eldorado, the poet and filmmaker Paulo Martins 
(Jardel Filho) decides to abandon the patronage of the political patriarch 
Porfirio Diaz (Paulo Autran) to throw his support behind populist Felipe 
Vieira (José Lewgoy) for governor. Vieira is elected, but soon reneges on 
his campaign promises; Vieira brutally puts down a peasant revolt, 
causing Paulo to leave him and return to the wild, orgiastic life he knew 
so well. But led by Sara (Glauce Rocha), Paulo's former lover, a group of 
"radicals" who support Vieira convince Paulo it's his duty to use his 
connections to destroy his former patron Diaz. Paulo obliges, but the 
experience leaves him disgusted with all politics. Learning later that he's 
been betrayed, and that martial law has been declared, Paulo opts for 
armed, militant resistance, but he's gunned down by the police.
That's the story; what emerges while watching the film is something 
quite different. Told in flashback, Rocha's film is a wild mélange of grand 
opera and cinema verité, Villa Lobos and Afro-Brazilian exorcisms. The 
personal and political turmoil personified by Paulo Martins is rendered 
viscerally by a visual style that alternates rapid-fire jump cuts with long, 
daredevil handheld camera sequences. Rocha creates a galaxy of 
archetypes that adroitly capture the spectrum of Latin American politics 
in the 1950s and 1960s, experiences that by the early 1970s led to 
military dictatorship throughout the region. Few films were as insightful, 
nor as universally criticized. Yet seen today it seems not only Rocha's 
masterpiece, but also that of the new Latin American cinema.  RP

Marketa Lazarová  Frantisek Vlácil, 1967
469
Set in the thirteenth-century Bohemian forests, Frantisek Vlácil's ambitious 
and multilayered medieval epic thematizes the transition from paganism 
to Christianity through the abduction and brutal rape by a fierce pagan 
warrior, Mikolás Kozlík (Frantisek Veleck), of the eponymous female lead 
(Magda Vásáryová), the innocent, convent-bound daughter of a clan leader.
Upon its initial release (after six years in the making), Variety magazine 
declared Marketa Lazarová, with its nearly three-hour length, elliptical 
narrative, and emphasis on symbol and metaphor, "a stunning work—
unsuitable for general commercial release." Eventually given its due, this 
black-and-white Gothic masterpiece—based on a prewar avant-garde 
novel and visually evocative of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Akira Kurosawa, and 
Ingmar Bergman—was voted the best Czech film of all time by a panel 
of the country's critics and industry leaders in 1998.
Rather than reduce the story to an action-filled but superficial 
adventure, Vlácil—known for his poetic lyricism and historical films (his 
1961 film The Devil's Trap was set during the counter-Reformation, and 
his 1967 film Valley of the Bees has its Czech hero brought up as a member 
of the Teutonic Knights)—here makes use of haunting cinematography 
and period details to delve into the psychological and spiritual state of 
his characters. As such, Marketa Lazarová stands as "an atavistic nightmare, 
a cinematic poem difficult to categorize in terms of genre or fear."  SJS

In the Heat of the Night  Norman Jewison, 1967
"They call me Mister Tibbs." Racism was still underexplored on screen 
when independent producer Walter Mirisch and director Norman 
Jewison had John Ball's novel In the Heat of the Night adapted specifically 
for Sidney Poitier. The result was in the vanguard of new social crime 
thrillers elevating what earlier would have been B-movie fare into 
important pictures.
Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) is arrested simply because he is a black man with 
money passing through segregated Sparta, Mississippi, the night of a 
northern industrialist's murder. To the bigoted police chief's (Rod Steiger) 
chagrin, Tibbs is a Philadelphia homicide detective, and the inimical odd 
couple are forced to cooperate in the investigation. The crime element 
and atmosphere are strong (enhanced by a memorable Quincy Jones 
score), but the film's enduring impact results from the fascinating 
relationship developed between the men. Poitier commands his top 
billing with princely disdain for the white trash who beset him while he 
unravels a Chandleresque tangle, but Steiger's gum-snapping, hot-
tempered, huge but subtle performance claimed the Academy Award 
for Best Actor. The film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Screenplay, 
Sound, and Editing. Poitier reprised the role of Tibbs in two sequels.  AE

Horí, má panenko  Milos Forman, 1967
The Fireman's Ball
Although Milos Forman never aspired to produce an allegory, his The 
Fireman's Ball is nevertheless a potent black comedy about the evils of a 
Soviet-style society. Also an award-winning movie and part of the reason 
why Forman defected to the West, the film was lambasted for its political 
subtext by coproducer Carlo Ponti despite being a smash hit that debuted 
precisely when tanks invaded Prague to extend the Iron Curtain.
Set in a small Czechoslovakian village, this film has several points of 
interest: the namesake party, a ceremony to honor the volunteer fire 
department's retired leader, a raffle for valuable foodstuffs, a beauty contest, 
and a fire that breaks out toward evening's end to tragicomic result.
Not compelling for its plot alone, The Fireman's Ball is a must-see title 
featuring a motley ensemble of laypeople discovered in the town where 
the film was shot. Episodic in structure, naturalistic in style, and interested 
in the broadest possible humor, the picture skillfully develops its careful 
observations about group behavior within confined circumstances.
Opening as the well-intentioned committee members of a volunteer 
fire department commission a trophy to honor their outgoing chief, the 
town's meeting hall holds fine goods for a raffle. As the hall fills with 
guests and the committee is consumed with an effort to find pretty 
young women for the "Miss" contest—an opportunity for members to 
ogle bared flesh—the raffle prizes are stolen, one by one. Everyone 
present is therefore suspect of burgling the goods because of the 
obvious scarcity that makes taking fine products like meat and expensive 
liquors extremely tempting for all.
The "Miss" contest subsequently spins out of control and then a 
fire breaks out across town. Despite all efforts by the now-drunken 
committee to tame the angry flames, an old man is left to watch his home 
burn down in the snow. By film's end the committee's members are left 
with a threefold failure to hold a raffle, promote a beauty contest, or put 
out a fire with but one remaining grace. Celebrating their retired leader, 
regardless of implicit cynicism about committees, comrades, and 
optimism for a better tomorrow—all core values of the predominant 
communist rhetoric—the bestowal of respect on one's elders appears 
as nothing more than empty pomp and circumstance.
Written by Forman, Jaroslav Papousek, and Ivan Passer, The Fireman's 
Ball demonstrates a critical awareness of Soviet society. Without 
overemphasizing that condition and the consequent want and 
deprivation everywhere part of Czechoslovakian life in 1967, the film 
further suggests how moral fortitude fails in the face of corrupt leadership 
benefiting the few at the expense of the many. Of course this tendency 
stems from a lack of everyday staples like good food and water, but it 
easily extends to an overall breakdown in civilized behavior, which seems 
like the film's allegorical resonance no matter Forman's intentions.  GC-Q

Perhaps the best loved of all the Disney animated features, The Jungle 
Book kicks off from Rudyard Kipling's story of a boy raised in the jungle 
by wolves. Unlike the live-action versions by Zoltan Korda (1942) and 
Stephen Sommers (1994), which focus on the boy's experiences on 
returning to civilization, the cartoon is about Mowgli's last days in the 
wild; the return of the ferocious tiger Shere Khan means it's no longer safe 
for him here. Mowgli demurs, but like Pinocchio before him, he is easily 
led astray, and only saved from the clutches of Kaa (the snake)and King 
Louie (the ape), by his friends Bagheera (a panther), and Baloo (the bear).
Although it's a slight story and the animation is unexceptional, the 
characterization and score give the picture distinction. The last animated 
feature to be overseen by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book was the 
first to use stars for the voice talent: An unmistakeable George Sanders 
is the insidious Shere Khan, Louis Prima sings "I'm the King of the 
Swingers," and Phil Harris has a ball as the beatnik dropout, Baloo, 
with his signature song "The Bear Necessities." A belated sequel, Jungle 
Book 2, followed in 2003.  TCh

Bonnie and Clyde  Arthur Penn, 1967
Arthur Penn's attempt to make an American "outlaw" film with French 
New Wave style and youthful exuberance proved an outstanding success 
with audiences, who appreciated its antiestablishment politics. Critics, 
too, eventually applauded the director's effort to infuse American cinema 
with a new energy and seriousness. However, Bonnie and Clyde was 
roundly condemned on its release for its graphic depiction of violence. 
Technological developments had made it possible to show gunshot 
wounds more realistically, and Penn's camera often lingers on the effects 
of bodies being torn apart and on the pain and suffering that results. 
Previous American films, of course, had often centered on violence, but 
Bonnie and Clyde was the first Hollywood picture to make the spectator 
strongly experience its horror and, even, mesmerizing beauty.
Initial reviews of the film were dismissive, even condemnatory, but 
the tide of critical opinion soon dramatically turned. Alternating 
effectively between scenes of terror, brutal realism, and almost slapstick 
comedy, Bonnie and Clyde is loosely biographical and has a very realistic 
feel due to meticulous art design and location shooting in northeast 
Texas. With some historical inaccuracies, it traces the exploits and 
eventual tragic end of the Depression era's most famous bank-robbing 
duo, who in their own time were celebrated as folk heroes. Warren Beatty 
and Faye Dunaway are scintillating as the criminal couple, while terrific 
support is provided by Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Michael J. 
Pollard. After a successful early spree, the gang is cornered by police in 
Iowa, where Clyde's brother Buck (Hackman) is killed and his wife Blanche 
(Parsons) is blinded and captured. The other three elude police pursuit, 
but eventually Bonnie and Clyde are lured into an ambush where they 
are riddled with machine-gun bullets in a slow-motion ballet of death.
The film's frank treatment of sex, particularly the unusual relationship 
between the impotent Clyde and the aggressive Bonnie, also broke new 
ground. By the late 1960s, Hollywood had abandoned Production Code 
restrictions for a ratings system that permitted greater freedom in the 
portrayal of sex and violence. Bonnie and Clyde is among the first and 
most successful films made under this new system. It earned ten 
Academy Award nominations, and its immense drawing power at the 
box office helped put American cinema into a newfound profitability.
Bonnie and Clyde is a powerfully ambiguous statement about the 
place of violence and the individual in American society. In movie history, 
however, its importance is much greater. The film's popular and critical 
success showed the Hollywood establishment that pictures combining 
European stylization and seriousness with traditional American themes 
(mediated by conventional genres) could be successful. Bonnie and Clyde 
paved the way for the "Hollywood Renaissance" of the 1970s, with 
masterpieces like Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) paying  
Penn's film the sincere praise of close imitation.  RBP

Viy  Georgi Kropachyov & Konstantin Yershov, 1967
Based on the same short story by famed nineteenth-century Russian 
author Nikolai Gogol that inspired Mario Bava's Italian horror classic The 
Mask of Satan (1960), Georgi Kropachyov and Konstantin Yershov's Viy is 
a colorful, entertaining, and genuinely frightening film of demons and 
witchcraft that boasts some remarkable special-effects work by Russia's 
master of cinematic fantasy, Aleksandr Ptushko.
Ill-fated seminary student Khoma Brutus (Leonid Kuravlyov) gets lost 
in some fields while on holiday, and ends up staying the night in an old 
crone's barn. The woman soon reveals herself to be a witch, using Khoma 
as a living broomstick. After beating her unconscious, Khoma watches 
with a mix of guilt and awe as the hag transforms into a beautiful young 
lady. Following this, Khoma is summoned to a remote village, where he 
has been specially selected to preside over the wake of a young woman 
in an ancient church. This entails spending three nights alone with the 
eerily familiar-looking corpse, with only his faltering faith to protect him.
It is here that the film truly amazes, as nightmarish creatures from 
beyond begin a parade across the screen. They culminate with the 
appearance of the demon Viy, who, in the words of one reviewer, "makes 
his entrance against a backdrop of one of the finest collections of ghoulies, 
ghosties, and long-leggity beasties" ever to appear in the movies.  SJS

The Cow
Rumor has it that after seeing The Cow, the Ayatollah Khomeini opined 
that perhaps there might be a place for filmmaking in the Islamic Republic, 
thus creating at least the theoretical possibility for the Iranian cinema of 
Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Jafar Panahi, and others. The 
first Iranian feature film to attract significant international attention, The 
Cow was the second feature by the UCLA-educated Dariush Mehrjui, 
who returned to Iran determined to create a new kind of filmmaking 
comparable to the new Third World cinema then just emerging.
Based on a play by Gholam-Hossein Saedi, who also contributed to 
the screenplay, The Cow is the story of Masht Hassan (Ezzatolah Entezami), 
proud owner of the only cow in a poor village. One day, when he is away 
on business, the cow unexpectedly dies; rather than reveal the truth to 
him, the other villagers pretend the cow has merely strayed. With so 
much of his identity and status wrapped up in that cow, Hassan grows 
increasingly obsessed with finding it, to the point of madness. Financed 
largely by the Shah's government, the movie's image of Iranian 
backwardness and poverty so outraged its producers that they forced 
the filmmakers to tack on a disclaimer stating that the events depicted 
occurred long before the current regime.  RP

Sergio Leone's Western masterpiece finds Charles Bronson stepping into 
the "No Name" role as the vengeance-seeking Harmonica and Henry 
Fonda trashing his Wyatt Earp image as the dead-faced, blue-eyed killer, 
Frank. The opening—Woody Strode, Al Mulock, and Jack Elam waiting 
for a train and bothered by a fly and dripping water—is masterful 
bravura, homing in on tiny details for a fascinating but eventless length 
of time before Bronson arrives for the shoot-out that gets the film going.
Once Upon a Time in the West is the first Leone film to place violence 
in a truly political context, indicting the corrupt (and crippled) railroad 
tycoon who "leaves two shiny, slimy tracks like a snail" as he bulldozes 
across the landscape, employing outlaw flunkeys to dispose of 
inconvenient settlers who won't unsettle easily. Rapacious civilization 
taints the wide open spaces as Harmonica quests to track down the 
sadist who hanged his brother, widow-whore-earth mother Claudia 
Cardinale tries to fulfill her murdered husband's dream of a real 
community out West, and bandido Jason Robards just wants to be 
left in a natural state of childish abandon. With striking widescreen 
compositions and epic running time, this is truly a Western that wins 
points for both length and width.  KN

Laughter, because it is so hard to act, often comes across as phony when 
depicted onscreen. But in Faces, every kind of laughter—lunatic, lusty, 
nervous, hysterical, defensive—is rendered with absolute authenticity, 
even when prescripted or postsynchronized.
What was John Cassavetes's secret? His rapport with actors was 
so total, his work with them so intensely detailed, that he was able 
to capture lived reality like no other American director. After the 
experiment of Shadows (1959) and bad experiences within the 
Hollywood system, Faces confidently marked the beginning of the 
Cassavetes "signature." Filmed in his home, it records vivid scenes in the 
lives of people who are at once hopelessly yearning and furiously 
alienated—stranded, like all Cassavetes characters, between the difficult 
responsibilities of daily routine and the reckless intoxications of nightlife.
Cassavetes shows his brilliant ensemble cast—John Marley and Lynn 
Carlin are especially memorable—always in media res, their bodies off-
center in the frame, their words and gestures truncated by the editing. 
Each scene is based on an unpredictable and often terrifying "turn," a 
sudden change in a character's mood or manner toward another. Faces 
invents a new way of experiencing time in cinema, where sudden pauses 
register as (in Cassavetes's words) "like stepping off a fast train."
Sometimes taken as the condemnation of a soulless, materialist 
middle class, the film is, rather, a painfully intimate and compassionate 
account of everyday suffering. Cassavetes stakes out the terrain he 
would often revisit—marital crisis, casual sex, hedonistic abandon, 
family ties—within a narrative that constantly shuffles and compares 
character's journey through a long night and its aftermath.
Is Faces the first film in cinema history where characters talk (indeed, 
laugh themselves stupid) about cunnilingus? Several decades later, 
directors including Neil LaBute and Lars von Trier are still trying to catch 
up to Cassavetes's astonishing ability to show the messy complexity of 
adult relationships.  AM

A classic science-fiction adventure that remains as powerful today as 
when it was first released, Planet of the Apes was a project that had 
the potential to go horribly wrong—the 2001 Tim Burton remake being 
an example of just how. Even if the $100 million budget was still two 
decades away, it was still a risky proposition to make a movie of Pierre 
Boulle's novel La planète des singes. So many actors in ape suits was 
surely a recipe for audiences sniggering rather than cowering behind 
their hands.
Before the film went into production, makeup supremo John 
Chambers allayed the fears of studio bosses by shooting a test scene 
with Charlton Heston (playing the human character, Taylor) and Edward 
G. Robinson (as apeman Dr. Zaius). Once the ape makeup was 
proved convincing, Chambers was given $50,000 to develop the simian 
effects in the film—Robinson, fearing hours in makeup chair would 
threaten his already failing health, pulled out and was replaced by 
Maurice Evans.
It was money well spent. The apes that Taylor and his two fellow 
astronauts encounter when their spaceship crashes on a desolate 
planet are scary indeed, especially when we and Taylor realize that they 
rule and humans are the mute animals in this strange place. The casting 
is perfect—Heston, running around in little more than a leather 
handkerchief, is butch and gruff, and Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, 
as "friendly" apes Cornelius and Zira, manage to escape the confines of 
their impressive makeup to deliver heartfelt performances.
Punctuated by memorable set pieces—Taylor's first glimpse of this 
new planet, his capture, and, of course, the unforgettable ending, and 
Rod Serling and Michael Wilson's witty script packed with killer lines 
("Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!")—this classic 
piece of cinema was followed by three sequels, a television series, the 
aforementioned disappointing remake, and even a hilarious spoof in an 
episode of The Simpsons.  JB

Rosemary's Baby  Roman Polanski, 1968
When a gaunt, hollow-eyed Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) exclaims 
with relief, "It's alive," about a third of the way into the film, the baby 
growing in her womb finally kicking, her insides before that eerily still, 
her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) recoils in horror touching her belly. 
In her excitement, Rosemary doesn't notice his response. Even more 
important, she quells both her better instincts and her growing suspicion 
that her husband, their new apartment and neighbors, and even her 
pregnancy are all somehow mysteriously and darkly linked. In doing so, 
she stays the course for what is, arguably, one of the finest horror films 
ever made.
Crystallized in that one scene are many of the familiar and defining 
concerns of director Roman Polanski—betrayal, corruption, the 
boundaries of sanity, and the "mysteries" of woman. Polanski's 
magnificent weaving together of these elements elevates the mildly 
pulp source (Ira Levin's hugely successful novel) into a cinematic classic. 
Time has done nothing to diminish the film's taut, focused, building 
sense of dread, and familiarity with the movie only keeps one that 
much more in awe of Polanski's detail, his rhythm and pacing, his skill 
with his actors, and the fine script he adapted for the screen. Revisiting 
the film uncovers humor that is sly and intentional. The casting of the 
now-iconic Cassavetes—an ever-glowing symbol of the pure artist in 
life at the time—playing a man who has sold his soul to the devil 
for showbiz success. The humor that has been layered on over the 
years and after the fact; Mia Farrow's desperation to be a mother 
now inspires uneasy giggles in its own right, thanks to her midlife 
tabloid travails.
Scenes and characters from Rosemary's Baby are etched into 
memory: Farrow hunched over a kitchen sink, her mouth bloody as she 
gnaws raw animal flesh, catching herself in shock; the dreamscape 
rape/consummation of Rosemary far more unsettling for what is 
suggested than actually shown; Ruth Gordon's dithering senior citizen 
slowly evolving into something much more sinister; Rosemary, near 
the film's end, entering the gathering of the tribe with a knife, 
desperate to see the baby that she's been told is dead. Still, it isn't only 
the Satanic aspect of the film that makes your skin crawl. Predicated on 
the abuse of marital trust, on the idea that the security of family and 
friends might all be an illusion, a force to be used against rather than 
for you, Rosemary's Baby taps into visceral fears. We can't really know 
the people around us. We can't trust anyone, not even ourselves. There 
is no sure protection. Polanski's masterful manipulation of these 
existential fears gives the film its power. And who among viewers can 
help but feel that Rosemary is their proxy as she watches the good 
people around her fall dead or ill, all while discovering just how 
pervasive the evil is around her?  EH

Modeled on Jean Vigo's brief hymn to schoolboy anarchy Zéro de 
Conduite (1933), Lindsay Anderson's follow-up to his This Sporting 
Life (1963) gets away from the realism and working-class rebellion that 
characterized the "kitchen sink" cinema movement and embraces a satiric 
style that now seems like a link between the classic surrealists and the 
Monty Python troupe.
Whereas the earlier film required that Anderson, who came from a 
respectable upper-class background, make an ethnographic study of 
Northern rugby-playing louts, If.... is also paradoxically a more genuinely 
realist film, in that it was made by someone who actually came from the 
public school system it so rigorously attacks. The opening section of the 
film follows sixteen-year-old Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) and his few 
equally "antisocial" friends as they are bored by masters and bullied by 
prefects, bristling against a system that imposes punishments at once 
farcical and cruel like floggings in the gym administered with all the 
ceremony of a nineteenth-century execution. Alternating between color 
and black-and-white film stock, allegedly not for any significant reason 
but because the budget for color ran out before the film was finished, 
If.... breaks out of the rigid confines of the school, with its crusty character 
actors and licensed homosexual predation, as Mick begins a perhaps-
imaginary affair with a voluptuous waitress (Christine Noonan). The sex 
scene, explicit for 1969, is unusual in the area of taboo-breaking in that 
it depicts not a rape or self-hating promiscuity with morality rammed 
home afterward but a couple enjoying physical love.
While Vigo overturned his school's shabby dignity with a pillow fight, 
Anderson—working after the student risings of 1968 and the growth of the 
protest movement—has Mick and his friends don guerrilla chic outfits and 
stage an attack on the school's Speech Day, gunning down the patronizing 
headmaster (Peter Jeffrey) and other establishment figures. Although shot 
in a fantastical manner, with odd gags such as a speaking corpse in a filing 
cabinet, there is no return to "reality" to blunt the revolutionary wish-
fulfillment fervor. Anderson, writer David Sherwin, and star McDowell 
brought the character of Mick Travis back for two further, wildly different 
satires, O Lucky Man! (1973) and Britannia Hospital (1982).  KN

David Holzman's Diary  Jim McBride, 1968
481
In his early twenties, on the staggeringly small budget of $2,500, Jim 
McBride began making David Holzman's Diary from three ideas: the image 
of a man filming himself in a mirror, the banality of daily life, and how the 
oppressiveness of New York affects people's perceptions and behavior.
David (screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson) is a schmuck. He decides to film 
the smallest details of his daily life to "find the truth." But his approach, 
by turns obsessive, voyeuristic, and paranoiac, swiftly alienates everyone 
around him. Far from a standard "mockumentary," McBride's recreation 
of the stages of this audiovisual diary is peppered with dramatic ellipses, 
emotional suspense, and a pleasing, always surprising set of variations. 
The result is remarkably prescient. The cinema-verité obsessions of the 
1960s targeted here were to reach their full flowering much later, in the 
eras of video and digital.
David Holzman's Diary has aged well. Not only has it been paid 
elaborate homage—in Roman Coppola's CQ (2001)—but its formal 
inventions (static long takes, black screen, fish-eye distortion, lateral 
traveling shots, and single-frame pixilations) have prefigured many 
other experiments. McBride had already synthesized, and critiqued, the 
legacies of Godard, Mekas, and "direct cinema."  AM
Memorias del subdesarrollo   
Memories of Underdevelopment  
Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, 1968
Part documentary, part feature film, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea's Memories of 
Underdevelopment portrays an important segment of Cuban life during 
the period 1961-62. Centered on Sergio (Sergio Corrieri), a wealthy 
former businessman-turned-aspiring-writer, the movie considers his 
relationship to the transformation of Havana into a communist dictatorship 
organized around a police state. 
Layered with voice-over narration, Alea peppers the account of 
Sergio's life with discourses on various subjects. There is an illuminating 
monologue about the Marxist dialectic, curiosity about the struggles of 
aging in a tropical climate, the general theme of underdevelopment, and 
social inconsistency during the early days of Fidel Castro's reign.
Perhaps Cuba's most internationally famous film, Memories of 
Underdevelopment is a trenchant critique of capitalism and the Communist 
Revolution. Within its simple story of one man in crisis are elements 
of fantasy, rolls of newsreel footage, and poignant bits of situational 
drama to express simultaneous wonder and contempt at the upheaval of 
the Cold War. Elegant and powerful, it's a tribute to Cuban creative 
influence in a moment of acute cultural suppression as the mask for a 
better tomorrow.  GC-Q

High School  Frederick Wiseman, 1968
Frederick Wiseman's second film is one of the most horrifying and 
ambiguous of his institutional studies. The film is a documentary view 
of Northeast High School in Philadelphia, apparently a public school 
serving a largely white, middle-class community. From the start, Wiseman 
makes it clear that his focus is on the authoritarianism of the teachers 
and administrators, the failure of the school to foster self-expression and 
critical thinking, and the emphasis on meaningless rituals and forms.
A Spanish teacher makes her students repeat the words "Jean-Paul 
Sartre" and "existentialista," with apparently no discussion of who Sartre 
is or what existential philosophy is about. An English teacher recites 
the poem "Casey at the Bat" to a room of sixteen-year-olds and is later 
heard to offer the inspirational wisdom, "The dictionary is the only place 
where success comes before work." A student protesting an imposed 
detention is told that unquestioning acceptance of punishment is a 
mark of maturity.
A college counselor advises one of her charges to prepare for the 
worst by applying to an inexpensive school with low academic standards. 
A gynecologist giving a sex-education lecture to an auditorium full of 
boys refers to the hymen as a "cherry" and reaps applause for joking that 
he gets paid to put his finger into vaginas. Female students must endure 
an inane calisthenics session in gym class (to the accompaniment of the 
1910 Fruitgum Company's mind-numbing "Simon Says") and a fashion-
show rehearsal in which a teacher (who must have graduated from the 
same modeling school as the millionaire's wife on Gilligan's Island) 
blithely describes a girl, in the latter's presence and in front of her peers, 
as having "a weight problem."
In the film's blood-freezing ending, a principal reads a letter she 
received from a recent graduate of the school, now serving in Vietnam, 
where he has volunteered for a dangerous mission. Thanking the school 
for the lessons he learned there, the student calls himself "only a body 
doing a job." In the last sounds heard in the film, the woman reading the 
letter claims that it proves that "we are very successful at Northeast High 
School." No filmmaker has ever cut to black with more stunning effect. 
Wiseman allows the principal's words, and the world view behind them, 
to stand out naked against the film's slatelike silence.
The portrait isn't entirely negative. Never a heavy-handed slagging 
of obvious problems, Wisemanian social criticism is based on a detailed 
and ironic exposition of situational and behavioral facts. Above all, 
Wiseman's filmmaking, sensitive to how his subjects reveal themselves, 
respects the humanity of even the most reprehensible among them. 
Thus he challenges the antipathies, no less than the complicities, of 
the viewer. Like Renoir, Wiseman reminds us that "everyone has his 
reasons"—a message that is no more reassuring in High School than it is 
in La règle du jeu (1939).  CFu

1968
Hour of the Wolf's original 1964 script was entitled The Cannibals and was 
conceived as an expensive, monumental film. But due to a serious bout 
of pneumonia and the decision upon hospital recovery to make the low-
budget project Persona (1966), writer-director Ingmar Bergman reworked 
the scenario into a companion piece to the latter film on a much smaller 
scale than originally intended. In Hour of the Wolf the artist's spiritual 
torment is not witnessed as an enigma from the outside, as in Persona, 
but conveyed to us directly from the artist's own thoughts by way of the 
film's staging of texts from his diary. Clearly inspired by the uncanny 
writings of E.T.A. Hoffmann—even down to the names of characters—
this is an all-out horror film about a sensitive (if not sympathetic) artist 
spiritually torn to pieces by his demonic critics and audience.
Reversing the vampire metaphor from Persona, in which nurse Alma 
(Bibi Andersson) dreams about actress Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann) 
sucking her blood, painter Johan Borg (Max von Sydow) in Hour of the 
Wolf sees his feudal and bourgeois benefactors at Baron von Merkens's 
(Erland Josephson) castle as living-dead creatures of the night in vampiric 
need of an artist to prey on. For their sadistic amusement, they invite 
him to a party only to treat him like a court jester. His pretensions to 
artistic freedom are openly mocked as the tormentors adoringly present 
a toy theater version of Mozart's The Magic Flute (later to be staged and 
filmed by Bergman) and then praise it as a commodity, suggesting that 
its value stems from the fact that it was a commissioned piece. The 
ultimate humiliation comes in a scene where Johan finds himself wearing 
clown/female makeup and being teased by his mistress Veronica Vogler 
(Ingrid Thulin) while his tormentors laughingly watch in the dark.
However, Bergman also hints that Johan as a narrator is not to be 
trusted. His tormentors possess supernatural qualities and an uncanny 
insight into his psyche that ultimately reveal them as projections of 
destructive forces from within himself. This makes the film yet another 
variation of Bergman's recurring motif concerning the predatory 
relationship between the artist and his audience.  MT

2001: A Space Odyssey  Stanley Kubrick, 1968
An artifact of evidently extraterrestrial origin triggers and monitors key 
stages on man's journey from ape to star child. At the dawn of man a 
mysterious monolith is the catalyst for an evolutionary leap in primates, 
from scavenger and gatherer to tool-wielding hunter and killer. Many 
millennia later a monolith uncovered by a geological team stationed on 
the moon alarmingly emits a short radio signal toward Jupiter. A manned 
expedition to investigate (impassively shepherded by Keir Dullea and 
Gary Lockwood while mission specialists slumber in stasis) is sabotaged 
by the spaceship Discovery's psychologically disturbed computer HAL 
(voiced by Douglas Rain), but surviving astronaut Bowman's (Dullea) 
contact with another monolith in Jupiter's orbit hurtles him though a 
gateway "full of stars"—through time and space, to age, die, and be 
reborn into a new phase of existence. That's one summary of a film that 
has enjoyed an enduring reputation for unfathomability.
Influential but still unique, coolly detached, obsessional, pretentious, 
contentious, bewildering, forever fascinating—2001 is all of these. 
Certainly it deviates from director Stanley Kubrick's stated intention to 
make the "proverbial good science-fiction movie" from his coscreenwriter 
Arthur C. Clarke's intriguing story "The Sentinel," as his film defies genre 
convention and is unlike any science-fiction movie before it. Visually, 
2001 is undeniably awesome. Oscar-winning, ground-breaking special 
effects are a dazzling mix of imagination and science. Meticulous mime 
work and 1960s state-of-the-art prosthetics makeup in the first of the 
film's four distinct acts create the best ape impersonations by humans 
ever seen at the time (and still highly effective, though arguably topped 
by John Chambers's creations for Planet of the Apes [also 1968]). And the 
movie is strewn with unforgettable images: the unexpected, stunning 
cut from a bone brandished by an ape-man and thrown aloft to a 
satellite; the magnificent alignment of sun and moon directly above the 
rim of the monolith; the orbital waltz of the space station and a docking 
shuttle; the circular crew habitat of the Discovery.
The sound is equally rich, with its experimental choral music, the 
classical themes (Richard Strauss's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," Johann 
Strauss's "Blue Danube Waltz") that forever bring the film to mind, and 
its snippets of minimalist dialogue ("Open the pod bay doors, Hal") that 
recur in wide-ranging homages and cultural references.
2001 can be taken as a mysterious adventure, sermon, or vision, but 
even viewed simply as a haunting spectacle it is unsurpassed, demanding 
to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. Its faults—its 
overblown abstraction and its sketchy narrative of scarcely articulated, 
unresolved speculation on the origins and destiny of human life—are 
more than compensated for by its gripping engagement between man 
and machine, its visual starkness and serenity, and, above all, its 
rhapsodic wonder at heaven and earth and the infinite beyond.  AE

Night of the Living Dead looks cheaply shot and starts out seeming like 
it might turn into a comedy: A brother and sister visit their mother's 
grave to pay their respects and the brother tries to scare his sibling by 
pretending to be a ghoul out to get her. Minutes later, however, he is 
killed and the young woman finds herself holed up in an abandoned 
farmhouse with an assortment of people as they are attacked by a 
mindless mob made up of the dead, newly risen, mindless, and craving 
the taste of human flesh.
Slowly, through emergency broadcasts on radio and television, the 
refugees begin to piece together what is happening. Corpses are 
getting up across the land, possibly even the world, and attacking the 
living in order to eat their flesh. Tensions arise among the heroes as they 
argue over what course of action to take. Should they try to escape or 
should they hold up and wait for help that may never arrive? Who 
should be taking the lead and giving the orders: the calm, rational black 
man or the impulsive family man? As the number of walking dead 
increases outside, the farmhouse may not hold for much longer, and 
drastic action will have to be taken. Before long, all bets are off. Every 
glimmer of hope and expectation you might have in a story is undercut 
by a wrong decision, bad luck, a cruel twist of fate, and all we are left 
with is the horror of despair. 
This is the horror movie that raised the bar on the genre in the 
second half of the twentieth century, dragging the stories away from 
the antiquated gothic conventions of yesteryear and into the cold, 
merciless light of the present. George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, 
with its matter-of-fact, almost documentary-style approach, touches 
upon the issues that preoccupied America in the late 1960s: civil unrest, 
racism, the breakdown of the nuclear family, fear of the mob, and 
Armageddon itself. Nothing can be taken for granted. Good does not 
always triumph. And for the first time, a horror movie reflected the 
sense of unease that permeated contemporary society with no offer of 
comfort or reassurance.  AT

The story goes that Peter Bogdanovich got his chance to direct when 
producer Roger Corman realized Boris Karloff owed him two shooting 
days. He also had about twenty minutes of unused footage from The 
Terror (1963), which he told Bogdanovich to use. But instead of the Edgar 
Allan Poe rip-off Corman had been expecting, Bogdanovich came up 
with a brilliant original scenario: Karloff in effect plays himself (his 
character is an old horror movie star called Byron Orlok), and 
Bogdanovich costars as the earnest young director trying to coax him 
into one last performance. This is cross-cut with a parallel story in which 
the apparently all-American "boy next door," Bobby Thompson (Tim 
O'Kelly), murders his wife and mother, then embarks on a random 
shooting spree, first from a water tower overlooking a highway, then 
from behind the screen at a drive-in cinema—where Orlok is making a 
personal guest appearance (and where Bogdanovich works in the footage 
from The Terror [1963], including shots of a young Jack Nicholson).
Targets is an American counterpart to the French New Wave films by 
directors like François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol. Like them, Bogdanovich 
was an auteurist film critic, and Targets features direct or coded references 
to Howard Hawks's The Criminal Code (1931—a film that starred Karloff), 
Orson Welles's Touch of Evil (1958), and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). 
This postmodernist aesthetic extends to the film's self-reflexivity: "I'm an 
anachronism," says Orlok. "My kind of horror isn't horror anymore." His 
point is chillingly underlined by Thompson's motiveless crimes. Obviously 
based on the Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman—the ex-marine who 
murdered his mother, then shot fourteen strangers on August 1, 1966—
Thomson is clean-cut, a "normal, healthy boy," who is nevertheless 
fascinated with guns (he carries a small arsenal around with him in the 
back of his car). The film plays on this same fixation, putting the camera 
behind Thomson's sight lines, asking us, like Harry Lime (Orson Welles) 
in The Third Man (1949), how much we really care about those dots in 
the distance. Coolly dissociative and intelligently mounted, Targets is a 
sharp snapshot of America falling to a new, violent age.  TCh

he refused pay for any shooting time

1968
Of the films Ingmar Bergman made in the mid-to-late 1960s with Max 
von Sydow and Liv Ullmann on his beloved island of Faro, Shame is 
perhaps the greatest. Not that Bergman, reconsidering the film in his book 
Images: My Life in Film, was too happy with it. He felt that the script was 
uneven, resulting in a poor first half and a better second half. He also felt 
that he had perhaps taken on too much in attempting to depict war. Such 
an assessment seems far too harsh. This study of the devastating effects 
of war on a couple is one of the most persuasive accounts of a relationship 
transformed by forces over which it has little or no control. Bergman may 
not have had Hollywood's resources on hand to stage spectacular 
destruction and carnage, but he more than compensated for such 
material constraints with the boldness, assurance, and conviction of his 
drama and the acuity of his psychological, emotional, and social insights.
Ullmann and von Sydow play a couple, their love flawed by weakness 
and complacency but able to sustain itself. But when the war they have 
managed more or less to ignore finally turns up on their doorstep, it forces 
them to look at themselves, each other, and their relationship with a new, 
cruel honesty. The violence, death, and betrayals around them are both 
arbitrary and terrifying, but perhaps no more so than these more intimate 
and, indeed, more shocking revelations. All par for the course, perhaps, 
in Bergman's corrosive chamber dramas. But here they are lent added 
force by the wider context of a world in conflagration. Sven Nykvist's 
typically magnificent black-and-white cinematography—as eloquent in 
its close-ups of faces as in its shots of trundling tanks, burning trees, and 
scarred landscapes—and the performances do ample justice to Bergman's 
magisterial conception. The two leads are memorable in the justly famous 
scene of a last, brief moment of sunny, domestic happiness just before 
the conflict arrives at their farm. But also is Gunnar Björnstrand, as a 
well-connected friend who helps them out, only to abuse his privileged 
position later on. Grim, hauntingly beautiful, and still scarily relevant.  GA

The Producers  Mel Brooks, 1968
489
"Will the dancing Hitlers please wait in the wings!" The first feature by 
writer-director-producer Mel Brooks is his gem. Less vulgar and more 
dangerous than anything else in his oeuvre, The Producers won the 
Oscar for his screenplay, a classic farce with gasp-inducing irony: a New 
York showbiz Jew, however deviously, staging a musical, however 
detestable, about Hitler.
The biggest joy of the film is the incomparable Zero Mostel, a 
Broadway titan returning after blacklisting blighted his film career and 
finding immortality as irrepressible scoundrel Max Bialystock. His foil is 
uptight accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), who innocently observes 
that a dishonest man could make a fortune if he knew a show would 
fail. Raise a million dollars to produce it for a fraction of that amount, 
and when it closes no one expects their money back. Electrified, Max 
perpetrates the fraud with a surefire flop, Springtime For Hitler, authored 
by a demented Nazi (Kenneth Mars). Absurdly, the show is a smash, 
leading to an opening at Leavenworth for Max's penitentiary opus 
"Prisoners of Love."
The film's beloved production number "Springtime for Hitler" gives 
new meaning to the term "showstopper," with its Busby Berkeley 
homage of dancers in swastika formation. Beautifully acted and staged 
lunacy, The Producers gets better on each viewing.  AE
Z  Costa-Gavras, 1969
Costa-Gavras's fast-paced political drama confirmed its director's high 
standing in the international film community while bringing attention 
to the plight of Greek democratic rule, which was ousted following the 
shocking assassination of left-leaning professor and legislator Gregorios 
Lambrakis in Salonika in 1963.
Although Z is in French and stars mostly French actors, Costa-Gavras's 
(a Greek émigré) film is based on Vassili Vassilikos's fictionalized account 
of the Lambrakis affair. After a liberal politician (Yves Montand) is 
brutally murdered following a speech at a peace demonstration, the 
subsequent investigation brings to light a degree of corruption that 
threatens to bring down the entire military establishment. The sense of 
anxiety is heightened by the director's use of discontinuous, staccato 
editing techniques, balanced by the sharp cinematography of Raoul 
Coutard. In the words of critic Pauline Kael, "Z is almost intolerably 
exciting—a political thriller that builds up so much tension that you'll 
probably feel all knotted up by the time it's over." In addition to its 
stylistic accomplishments, the film boasts fine performances from Jean-
Louis Trintignant as the examining magistrate and Irene Papas as 
Montand's wife.  SJS

Satyricon  Federico Fellini, 1969
The popularity of the European art film with American audiences began 
with the Italian Neorealist films of the 1940s, and expanded with the 
engaged and visionary films of that movement's most influential 
successor, Federico Fellini. More famous, perhaps, for productions that 
examine the mores and difficulties of contemporary society, the director 
also, like many in the Italian film industry, showed an interest in historical 
reconstructions. Satyricon is an epic reimagining of Petronius's novella 
about life in the time of Nero. Fellini's sprawling film—the action ranges 
far and wide throughout the Roman world—was an immediate success 
with art-house audiences. Shocking scenes of debauchery, grotesquerie, 
and black comedy fully earned an R rating from the recently installed 
ratings system, taking advantage of the new freedom of expression 
offered with the demise of the Production Code.
At once a quite faithful depiction of ancient Rome in the tradition of 
the Italian historical film and an evocation of the sexual revolution of the 
1960s, Satyricon has much in common with the director's earlier films, 
particularly La Dolce Vita (1960). However, many reviewers felt it lacked 
the intellectual themes and meaningful stylizations of the director's earlier 
efforts. Certainly an emphasis on nudity and sex issued an appeal to 
certain segments within the "art cinema" audience of the period. Following 
his fragmentary source closely, Fellini offers a narrative of twenty-five 
distinct episodes, only loosely connected by the presence of the young 
and cynical Encolpio (Martin Potter). In the manner of Odysseus, Encolpio 
finds himself embarked on a continual series of adventures that threaten 
death and disaster, but from which he always manages to escape.
Encolpio's friendship with Ascilto (Hiram Keller), and their joint 
attraction to a handsome young slave boy (Max Born), is placed at the 
center of the film whose twists and turns are often difficult to follow. One 
thing is certain, however—Encolpio, much like the viewer, finds great 
difficulty understanding the morals and behavior of the many strange 
characters he encounters. The movie is filled with memorable sequences: 
a whorehouse filled with obese customers and prostitutes, animal 
sacrifices replete with rivers of blood, an earthquake that knocks down 
the building where Encolpio is staying, a nymphomaniac met in the 
desert whom Encolpio is called upon to satisfy, an encounter with a 
minotaur in the tradition of Theseus's famous adventure, and the startling 
richness of Trimalcione's (Mario Romagnoli) feast, whose guests, in the 
tradition of the nouveau riche, display an amazing vulgarity.
In the picaresque tradition, Satyricon ends not with some establishment 
of social stability, but with the hero's departure for even further 
adventures. A comment, perhaps, on the hedonism and unrepentant 
materialism of modern society, the film is more memorable as a feast of 
surprising, even shocking images, with visual rhymes and repeated 
motifs imposing a kind of unity on the continuing flow.  RBP

Sergei Paradjanov's greatest film is also his most radical and obscure. It 
inaugurated the most serious difficulties he had with Russian authorities 
that culminated in his being sent to prison in 1973, for homosexuality 
and other charges—after having already been attacked as a formalist, a 
Ukrainian nationalist, and an ideological deviant. This groundbreaking 
masterpiece remains the most extreme expression of his eccentric vision.
A mystical and historical mosaic about the life and work of eighteenth-
century Armenian poet Aruthin Sayadin, popularly known as Sayat Nova 
(the "King of Song"), The Color of Pomegranates was previously available 
only in an ethnically "dry-cleaned" Russian version. The superior original 
version, found in an Armenian studio in the early 1990s, can't be regarded 
as definitive, but it's certainly the finest available: some shots and 
sequences are new, some are positioned differently, and, of particular 
advantage to Western viewers, much more of the poetry is subtitled.
In both versions, the striking use of tableau-like framing recalls the 
shallow space of movies made roughly a century ago, whereas the 
gorgeous uses of color and the wild poetic and metaphoric conceits 
seem to derive from some utopian cinema of the future. But we don't 
have to decode the images in any systematic way to experience 
their haunting power—at once "difficult" and immediate, cryptic and 
ravishing, they resemble Persian miniatures infused with ecstasy.  JRos

It's a mystery. Not a whispered mystery, but a mystery sung by the strong 
voice of gigantic bells, shouted by the storms, illuminated by the bonfires 
of war, of faith, of love. The origin of this powerful mystery is perfectly 
obvious: Andrei films Andrei. Evoking the similarities between Andrei 
Rublev (played here by Anatoli Solonitsyn), the fifteenth-century monk 
who became the master of icon painting, and Andrei Tarkovsky, the great 
twentieth-century Soviet filmmaker, is not the goal. It is more like the 
huge caldron in which fear and hope, personal dedication (bordering on 
madness), and mass impulse can be heated up together.
Certainly, the film concerns the relationships between man and God, 
man and nature, the artist and the people, the artist and the art form, 
and the Russian and his land as a physical and mystical element. But as 
rich as Andrei Rublev might be on the thematic level, Tarkovsky's fresco 
is not made out of ideas. It is made out of light and darkness, of noise 
and silence, of human faces and rough material. It is a telluric move and 
a magical stay, suspended above the void. Dark, sensual, and deeply 
moving, the film is a mystery, in the best sense of the word.  J-MF

"I'm WALKIN' here!" Texan dishwasher Joe Buck (Jon Voight in a star-
making performance) heads for New York City, to the infectious lament 
"Everybody's Talkin' at Me" sung by Harry Nilsson, believing wealthy 
women will be eager to pay a strapping stud for sex (the film's title is slang 
for a hustler). His tragicomic progress of the naive newcomer is punctuated 
by sad, disturbing flashbacks, particularly a horrific assault on Joe and his 
girl Crazy Annie, played by the screenwriter Waldo Salt's daughter Jennifer. 
His "career path" in New York is a string of dispiriting encounters, 
unforgettably one with Sylvia Miles as a drab blonde whose pitiful 
insistence she is "a gorgeous chick" sees the credulous Joe paying her.
Destitute and lonesome, Joe bonds with the crippled, consumptive 
con man Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, a compelling study of 
"street weasel"), who invites him to share his squat. Joe's hopes dim as his 
sordid failures mount, while as Ratso's chronic physical condition worsens 
his fantasies of a new life in Florida soar. Although the film is often called 
cynical and bleak, director John Schlesinger's view that it is ultimately a 
story of hope is justified by Joe's abandonment of his gigolo fantasy just 
when it seems attainable, for the sake of a real, human relationship. The 
British Schlesinger brought an acute eye to his American debut, finding 
a harsh vitality in the city that emphasized the characters' desperate 
isolation, and filming on location enhanced the seedy verisimilitude. 
Arguably the bravest choice ever made by Academy Award voters, 
Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated movie to have won the Academy 
Award for Best Picture. The film also won Oscars for direction and Salt's 
adaptation of the James Leo Herlihy novel. The distinction prompted a 
rethink, and despite its then-thorny subject matter of homosexuality and 
prostitution the film's U.S. rating was changed to an R, its commercial 
success proving audiences were ready to embrace its maturity, frank 
realism, and the compassionate power of its performances. And despite 
the film's visual nods to 1960s fashion—most obviously in the Warhol 
circle's psychedelic loft party sequence—Schlesinger's focus on the 
relationship rather than style endures, and is always affecting.  AE

"What do you mean, you can't swim? The fall'll probably kill ya!" The 
iconic teaming of Paul Newman and Robert Redford was so magical—
and so profitable, scoring the year's biggest hit—that this offbeat 
character study/action comedy in Western trappings and bathed in 
cinematographer Conrad Hall's Oscar-winning sepia hues has been a 
touchstone for bickering buddy pictures ever since.
Outlaws Butch (Newman) and The Kid (Redford) belong to the 
notorious Hole in the Wall Gang, but an over-the-top train robbery makes 
things too hot, with a tireless posse pursuit prompting the recurring 
question from Butch that became a catchphrase—"Who ARE those 
guys?"—and the decision to relaunch their career of crime abroad with 
The Kid's mistress Etta Place (Katharine Ross) in tow. The famous last act 
has its share of humor—memorably practicing "This is a robbery; back 
against the wall!" in Spanish to become the bandito scourge of Bolivia. 
But the film is immortal for its final image of the pair, freeze-framed as 
they run out into a shoot-'em-up with an army.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an utterly disarming 
combination of smart, original screenwriting, handsome visual treatment, 
and star power. With all the jokes and poses, there is still real interest in 
the well-defined, contrasting characters. Butch, the brains, is a smooth 
talker with vision, carried away by his enthusiasms, The Kid a golden boy 
with darkness within, cool and sardonic, ashamed to admit any weakness.
William Goldman's Oscar-winning screenplay is exciting, funny, and 
romantic, both slyly satirizing and embracing Western legend (the real 
Butch and Sundance were far from Newman's and Redford's charismatic 
charmers). It also has audacious nerve, as when The Kid accosts "teacher 
lady" Etta and orders her to undress at gunpoint. After the initial shock in 
a thus-far genial movie, it is a relief, a big laugh, and a turn-on when it 
becomes clear they are already well acquainted. The Burt Bacharach song 
interlude, "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head," is the only dated element. 
Movies just don't come more attractive and likeable than this one.  AE

There's a reason A Touch of Zen is considered a benchmark in Chinese 
cinema: It's like a Rosetta Stone of the wuxia, or swords-and-sorcery, 
genre. The story begins simply, centering on the life of a daydreaming 
scholar (Shih Chun), whose mother despairs of his ever marrying and 
siring children. Then he becomes smitten with the mysterious woman 
(Feng Hsu) who has moved into the abandoned mansion, long rumored 
to be haunted, and the intimations of a ghost story come to the fore. The 
revelation that she is in fact a princess fleeing from imperial enemies 
who slaughtered her family throws the story into even greater relief. Each 
plot twist opens the narrative up into something bigger, and before the 
end, Buddhist monks with supernatural powers and metaphysical fantasy 
are added to the mix as well. At more than three hours long, the pace is 
surprisingly brisk because this is a movie that's genuinely unpredictable. 
King Hu is rightly regarded as the pioneering director of the wuxia 
film, in spite of the genre's existence in film history since the silent era. 
Granted, wuxia novels may already have possessed great richness and 
complexity, but it was Hu who brought these traits to the cinema, 
combining them with the acrobatics and pageantry of Peking Opera and 
the underpinnings of Zen Buddhism. Hu understood that films were 
experienced with the senses, and he fills the CinemaScope frame with 
a constant swirl of color and movement. Honing his craft on several 
previous wuxia films, A Touch of Zen stands as the zenith of Hu's career.  AT

Easy Rider  Dennis Hopper, 1969
Easy Rider is one of those movies whose importance goes far beyond its 
status as a work of art. The story is slight. Two young men, nicknamed 
Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), make a lot of 
money on some drugs that they buy in Mexico. Feeling rich, they decide 
to realize a long-standing ambition to visit New Orleans during Mardi 
Gras. They buy a couple of motorbikes and set off across country. On the 
way, they pass by some celebrated icons of the American West, including 
Monument Valley and Taos Pueblo. They drop in on a commune, run into 
an engaging small-town lawyer who helps them get out of jail, and go 
on a drug trip with a couple of hookers in a New Orleans graveyard—all 
of which leads to the shock ending.
This seemingly inconsequential narrative proved to be one of the 
seminal films of the post-1968 generation in Hollywood, one of the first 
to put "the alternative society" on the screen. The two bikers are iconic 
figures, Hopper with his long hair, shades, and Indian necklace, Fonda 
with his stars and stripes helmet and bike. There is plentiful drug 
consumption (reputedly among cast and crew, as well as in the film itself). 
The two heroes go skinny-dipping with a couple of accommodating 
hippie girls and engage in marijuana-fueled campfire philosophizing 
with their lawyer friend George. Played by Jack Nicholson in his first big 
break, George is a rich man's son who rejects straight society, articulating 
most of what passes as the film's ideological position. In his view the 
country has gone to the dogs, terrified of the unconventional: "It's real 
hard to be free when you're bought and sold in the marketplace."
Easy Rider challenged much of the conventional Hollywood wisdom. 
It's a film by and for the young (Hopper was only thirty-two when he 
directed it), with music by such stalwarts of the counterculture as 
Steppenwolf, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan. None of the principals 
(Nicholson, Hopper, and Fonda) were big stars. The narrative is as 
freewheeling as the characters. There's no conventional love story, 
and the film has a brutally unhappy ending. Made for very little money, 
Easy Rider was a huge box-office success. It helped pave the way for 
works that challenged conventional Hollywood ideas, including further 
Jack Nicholson vehicles such as Five Easy Pieces (1970) and The King of 
Marvin Gardens (1972).
Subsequently, there has been a lively disagreement as to who did 
exactly what on the film. Hopper has laid claim to being its "auteur," not 
only directing and starring but also in his view responsible for the script. 
Others see it differently, contending that the most articulate scenes in 
the film—for example the conversations involving George—were 
carefully scripted in advance by Terry Southern, whose previous screen 
credits included Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop 
Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964). All agree on one thing, though—that 
the title was Southern's invention.  EB

Humerto Solás's Lucía is undoubtedly one of the landmark works of 
modern, postrevolutionary Cuban cinema. In many ways, it can be 
said to offer a kind of summation of many of the key tenets of the cinema 
of this decade. This exhilarating mix of styles and tones is partly 
accommodated by the film's three-part structure, following the fate—
and love stories—of three characters named Lucía at pivotal moments 
in "modern" Cuban history. 
From a contemporary perspective, the most remarkable aspect of 
Lucía is its ability to move dynamically between various modes of cinema 
and present eye-popping tableaux of equal beauty and horror. In this 
respect, the film's opening segment is probably the most commented 
upon and remembered. In particular, the battle sequences—featuring 
naked black riders slaughtering government troops—have a visceral 
ferocity akin to Orson Welles's Chimes at Midnight (1965). In its mixture 
of various styles of performance, its fatalistic staging of history, and its 
dynamic movement between proximity and distance, the extreme close-
up and the long shot, it can also be said to resemble the equally operatic 
work of Sergio Leone. In its clashing of perspectives and approaches, 
Lucía explores the consciousness-raising possibilities of film as well as 
the link between postrevolutionary Cuban cinema and the new waves 
of Europe and South America.  AD

With Kes, the director's first feature, Ken Loach essentially transferred the 
realist methodology he'd been using in his television work and proffered 
a statement of intent for his future films. Working with Barry Hines on an 
adaptation of the latter's novel, Loach depicts the brief opportunity of 
escape that opens up when a young Barnsley boy (David Bradley) finds 
and trains a kestrel (falcon). His growing interest in the art of falconry, 
coupled with his admiration for the bird's own hunting skills and proud 
independence, allows him at least to glimpse an alternative to the 
tediously oppressive present and uninvitingly constricted future of his 
life in the working-class English town.
Loach avoids the sentimental clichés of many earlier films set in Britain's 
industrial north by focusing not on grim, grimy streets and chimneys but 
on how human relationships and aspirations are stunted and twisted by a 
continuous diet of economic and cultural deprivation. Hence the emotional 
force of those scenes in which the lad's enthusiasm—long-neglected rather 
than nourished by family, friends, and all but one teacher—is betrayed 
and, finally, extinguished. And Chris Menges's typically fine camerawork 
catches the power of the falcon in flight, perfectly balancing the bird's 
very real agility with its value as a symbol of intuitive freedom.  GA

Argued through indirect means, Emile de Antonio's In the Year of the Pig 
mounts an impressive attack on American foreign policy and the war in 
Vietnam. One result is an extraordinarily provocative documentary. 
Another is a textbook example of flaws within the American sensibility 
that are most easily identified as simple arrogance.
Opening with images of protest, the film sketches a backdrop for 
American involvement in Southeast Asia, ostensibly to defend the world 
from communist infiltration, necessitating a digression into the history of 
colonialism. First up is China, then various European powers before 
France's expulsion at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Throughout these sequences, 
interesting as they may be, de Antonio's film wastes precious little time 
getting to a point. Namely, that all Vietnam wars have been in no way 
inevitable, humane, or helpful in assisting the indigenous population form 
a sovereign nation when this much has always seemed to be their purpose.
Zeroing in on found footage or else relying on carefully edited 
interviews, the film manipulates talking heads into its argument without 
overtly stating its point. In this way, de Antonio and his production staff 
remain carefully off-screen even though their imprint is everywhere 
present. Thus the included historical figures produce discursive positions 
along the twin axes of fame and context.
Expanding the former are a "who's who" collection of important 
leaders, writers, and critics. Naturally certain of these are better known, 
such as American presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, Vietnamese hero Ho Chi Minh, 
red-baiter Joseph McCarthy, and war hawk Robert McNamara. Yet the 
weight of gold is supplied by those figures providing context rather than 
political drumbeats, among them David Halberstam, Jean de Lattre de 
Tassigny, Harry S. Ashmore, Hubert Humphrey, and even George S. Patton 
III. Of course, some of these figures have since become synonymous with 
establishment thinking. In 1969, however, their views formed the basis 
of this treatise and one of the more successful antiwar, if at times anti-
American, diatribes on the evils of political expediency.  GC-Q

The Wild Bunch  Sam Peckinpah, 1969
A Hemingwayesque answer to the Erich Segal-ish Western revisionism 
of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), The Wild Bunch is at once 
disgusting and romantic, investigating the thesis that "even the worst of 
us" want to be children again—"perhaps the worst of us most of all." 
Director Sam Peckinpah, in his breakthrough picture, opens with 
innocent children pouring ants onto scorpions and setting fire to the 
nest as the Bunch ride into town disguised as the U.S. Army. Continually 
cutting away to kids watching the action, they imitate the grown-up 
bang-bang games and finally take part. Even the repulsive General 
Mapache (Emilio Fernandez) is hero-worshipped by a boy who picks up 
a gun to avenge his death. The opening bank raid is a complete botch 
as the corrupt railroad tycoon lures the Bunch into town with bags of 
washers disguised as payroll—"silver rings," gasps a hopeful idiot when 
the ruse is revealed. A shoot-out between the bandits and a crew of 
degenerate bounty hunters leads to the deaths of many innocents as a 
temperance parade marches into the gunfire.
Violent but honorable badman Pike Bishop (William Holden) is 
pursued by his former friend Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). Pike is admired 
by his sidekick Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) and tagalong Mexican (Jaime 
Sánchez), tolerated by the fractious, grumpy, childish Gorch brothers 
(Warren Oates, Ben Johnson), and looked over by father figure Freddy 
Sykes (Edmond O'Brien), though he abandoned the old man's crazy 
grandson (Bo Hopkins) during the initial raid. With the American frontier 
closing down, the Bunch find themselves appalled by the tyranny of pre-
Revolutionary Mexico as Mapache, with his German advisors, represents 
a legitimate government but acts far worse than the most evil outlaws. 
In a classic "last stand," the grizzled heroes opt to take on Mapache's whole 
town in order to stick up for their fallen comrade. Peckinpah realized that 
the shots of four gunmen walking through the streets to the showdown 
are the necessary setup for the brilliantly edited, semi-slow-motion orgy 
of mass destruction that climaxes the picture as the Bunch die, taking an 
entire army with them, spurting blood like burst firehoses.
Set in 1913, at the end of the era of the Western outlaw, The Wild 
Bunch drags the cowboy movie myth into an age of mass-produced 
murder symbolized aptly by the Gatling gun and the Model T Ford. Shot 
through with whiskery Western eccentricity, including a hilarious double 
act from L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin as human vultures ("This one's 
got gold in his teeth") and a great deal of picturesque dialogue ("Well, 
kiss my sister's black cat's ass"), this was the film that reclaimed the 
American tradition of the Western back from the Italians and proved that 
Peckinpah could pop more blood capsules than Sergio Leone. Famous 
at first for its gory violence, The Wild Bunch has lasted for its elegiac 
lyricism ("It ain't like it used to be, but it'll do"), strong performances, and 
sense of dead-end honor.  KN
"In purely cinematic 
terms, the film is a 
savagely beautiful 
spectacle, Lucien Ballard's 
superb cinematography 
complementing 
Peckinpah's darkly 
elegiac vision."

Ma nuit chez Maud  Eric Rohmer, 1969
My Night at Maud's
My Night at Maud's, the third of Eric Rohmer's six "Moral Tales" and often 
considered the best, takes place over a few days one winter in the 
provincial city of Clermont, France. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays an 
engineer, a practicing Jesuit, who decides to marry a student, Françoise 
(Marie-Christine Barrault), whom he has seen at Mass but never met. By 
chance, he runs into an old school friend (Antoine Vitez) who takes him to 
the apartment of the witty, intelligent Maud (Françoise Fabian), a divorced 
doctor. Over the course of a long conversation that forms the centerpiece 
of the film, the hero and Maud discover an affinity for each other.
In no other filmmaker's work are place and season more important. 
In My Night at Maud's, the falling snow cools the air in the long scene in 
Maud's apartment, provides a pretext for the hero's spending the night 
there, and later makes it possible for him to meet and spend the night 
with the student. The film's complexity and poignancy owe as much to 
Néstor Almendros's black-and-white cinematography as it does to the 
vigorous and brilliant dialogue. An atmosphere of uneasy détente 
prevails, linked emotionally to the hero's agreeable alienation. Despite 
Trintignant's great likeability (this is one of this best performances), the 
film is not, finally, on the hero's side, and it views his decisions with a 
sadness that lingers with the viewer long after the film is over.  CFu

Tristana  Luis Buñuel, 1970
It is often said that the defining characteristic of classicists from John 
Ford to Clint Eastwood is the invisibility of their style. But even their films 
look ostentatious and contrived next to the late work of Luis Buñuel. 
What makes Tristana so disquieting is the seeming simplicity of its 
manner and the sense of it unfolding, with rigorous and brutal logic, into 
an inevitable tragedy.
Buñuel had nursed this adaptation of Benito Pérez Galdós's classic 
novel since 1963. It tackles one of his favorite topics: the seduction and 
corruption of an innocent, Tristana (Catherine Deneuve), by the much 
older Don Lope (Fernando Rey), a gentleman whose stated political 
ideals are far more radical than his treatment of women. Tristana survives 
this oppression, after the loss of one leg, by doubling its viciousness and 
spreading its effects—as in the disturbing scene where she exhibits her 
body to the young servant, Saturno (Jesús Fernández).
Is Tristana a surrealist film? Not obviously, but profoundly: A 
subterranean world of unconscious drives, a parallel dimension, seems 
to lurk just beneath the surface of everything Buñuel presents—peeking 
out only in the final glimpse of how this sad story could have headed in 
another direction altogether.  AM

1970
The title of Bernardo Bertolucci's film refers to Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis 
Trintignant), who readily embraces Mussolini's Fascist government. He 
joins the secret police and is set up with a new life, including a new wife 
(Stefania Sandrelli), but his honeymoon has an ulterior motive. He is to 
assassinate an old college professor (Enzo Tarascio), a leader of the anti-
Fascist movement. However he begins to have doubts about the validity 
of his mission, provoked in part from repressed childhood memories.
Has there ever been a movie so utterly at odds with its title as The 
Conformist? Bertolucci's film couldn't be more conspicuously immodest 
in its audacious use of style; conformity appears to be the furthest 
element from its intent. The film features a nonlinear narrative, leaping 
back and forth across time with flashbacks to paint a more detailed 
portrait of Trintignant's complicated protagonist. Even more impressive 
is Vittorio Storaro's astounding cinematography. The Conformist makes 
such good use of color, camera placement, and design that the story 
often seems subservient to the images. 
This is eye candy of the highest order, as undercover assassins and 
political intrigue have never looked so stylish. Yet the politics of 
Bertolucci's film never fade entirely to the background. The Conformist 
is, after all, a damning indictment of Fascist collaborators. Trintignant is 
depicted as a weak-willed follower who ultimately pays the price for 
basing his life on the strong (and wrong) convictions of others. 
Curiously, Bertolucci clouds the story with a bit of dubious psychology. 
Trintignant's behavior, it seems, can be traced back to a sexual encounter 
in his childhood, a literal link between violence and sex at the root of his 
desire for order. It's as if his decision to join the Fascist Party will in some 
way keep his homosexuality in check. Like much of the film itself, the 
psychoanalysis is mostly surface and introduces little substance. But 
Bertolucci takes advantage of the muddy psychology by introducing 
copious symbolic references and images, some of them obvious, some 
of them oblique, but all never less than entrancing to watch.  JKl

It is unusual for a single film to reshape the whole perception of the work 
of a major filmmaker. Claude Chabrol was seen as the cruel portraitist of 
the French bourgeoisie, drawing with dark ink and a ferocious sense 
of humor the complexities lying beyond the moral common law, the 
conformism of manners, the clichés of "good" and "bad" that mask the 
reality of impulses, the narrative conventions that destroy the possibility 
of apprehending the depths of human nature. And he certainly was all 
that, which is saying quite a lot. But he was not just that.
In 1969, during the boiling point of an ideological heating-up of the 
entire French society, when Chabrol seemed to be quite obviously in the 
grip of History, he took an incredible step back, to get a larger view, a 
broader comprehension of the world as a cosmic whole, beyond good 
and evil. The resulting film, The Butcher, is a love story with a serial killer. 
This is what filmmaking can do: allow for the peaceful merging of two 
genres that seem to exclude one another, the murder story and the 
romance. Taking place in a remote portion of the Garden of Eden in 
southern France, Chabrol allows the intensity of his wonderful actors, 
Jean Yanne and Stéphane Audran, to burn slowly. The pair underplay 
their absurd parts—this absurdity is the flesh and bone of the terrestrial 
(not only human) condition—and let everything go to catastrophe.
He loved her, she was quite fond of him, and he killed young girls. 
The butcher Popaul (Yanne) is the flesh, the school headmistress 
(Audran) the mind. This is the state of things, water and blood and dark 
forces separate them, but that isn't a reason not to pay attention to 
each other, not to care for someone so different from yourself—quite 
the opposite, in fact. But Paradise is lost forever, and this too is what 
Chabrol's subtle cinema is about. Don't bother to question the director 
on this point: he is far too elegant and smart to admit it, and prefers 
instead to hide behind his social tales and genre games. Just enter the 
smooth sadness of Le boucher.  J-MF

Taking his cue from Fellini, writer-director-star Alejandro Jodorowsky 
takes the simple story of a gunfighter who sets out to defeat the greatest 
gunslingers of the land and turns it into an allegory for man's quest for 
enlightenment. El Topo the gunslinger journeys across a desert filled 
with brutal gangs and grotesque, surreal warriors, each symbolizing a 
different stage in the hero's journey. There's an endless parade of biblical 
references, Freudian motifs, and Jungian symbols. El Topo starts out vain 
and selfish, eager to attain power and glory, only to find himself bereft and 
empty once he achieves his goal. Realizing the futility of his mission, he 
renounces his worldly ambitions. He undergoes a symbolic death before 
returning from the desert a cleansed, empty vessel with the weight of the 
world's suffering on his shoulders, trying to protect a band of cripples and 
deformed, childlike freaks. Faced with a world as uncaring as the one he 
left, and a vengeful son he abandoned, he has no choice but to make one 
last sacrifice, an act of self-immolation that evokes the image of the monk 
who burned himself to death to protest against War and Destruction.
Unlike other Westerns, El Topo makes no pretense at naturalism or 
historical accuracy. The world depicted is a highly personal landscape, a 
setting for the cycle of Life, Death, and Rebirth. Granted, it could be said 
that Jodorowsky lays it on a bit thick, that his casting himself as the lead 
is the height of hubris and narcissism. But El Topo is fascinating for being 
a product of its time, a document of the lessons and philosophies people 
were then studying, and their fears, both conscious and unconscious.  AT

If for nothing else, Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces is worth seeing for the 
pleasure of watching Jack Nicholson unable to get an order of toast. 
Nicholson's first star turn after gaining notoriety in his supporting role 
as the lawyer in Easy Rider (1969) is as Robert Dupea, an oil rigger living 
in a trailer park with his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black). Robert 
decides to take a road trip up the West Coast to reconcile with his sick 
father. Structured around the road trip and Robert's return home, the 
film has a meandering, capricious style ideally suited to the revelation 
of character and savoring the actors' nuanced performances in a series 
of set pieces.
It is fascinating to see the beginnings of Nicholson's persona here, as 
a charismatic antihero with an edge of violence and vulnerability. Black 
is outstanding as a good-time girl, a little past her prime, who must slowly 
watch as she loses Robert to his past. The film is a thoughtful, meticulous 
character study that is ultimately extremely moving and surprising. Five 
Easy Pieces comes at the beginning of an innovative and fruitful period 
of American filmmaking, and is an excellent introduction to it.  RH

Deep End  Jerzy Skolimowski, 1970
Jerzy Skolimowski's first English-language film after writing Roman 
Polanski's Knife in the Water (1962) is a remarkable excursion into the 
mind of a sexually frustrated fifteen-year-old boy. Deep End functions 
as both a black sex comedy and a rite-of-passage tale with tragic 
consequences for all involved.
John Moulder-Brown plays the youth with a comedic sensitivity that 
darkens as the object of his desire rebuffs his advances, while Jane Asher 
plays the young woman who is his obsession with great insight, her 
performance as Susan semi-improvised to great effect. Both young 
people are trapped in the seedy world of the Newford Bathhouse, filled 
with unhappy people who live for sex and soccer. Susan uses her looks 
to make extra money with the clients and suggests the same to Brown. 
He is disgusted with her lifestyle and longs to take her away from it all.
Skolimowski shows an astute insight into the eccentricities of the 
British, and captures a side of the so-called swinging London that is both 
ugly and faded with a real sense of impending spiritual breakdown. The 
film attains a voyeuristic tone as Moulder-Brown searches though Soho's 
seedy strip joints until he steals a cardboard cutout of Susan for a final 
fantasy of his mental deep end. A date film to see before you die!  DDV
Bertolucci's The Spider's Stratagem is, for many, the definitive European 
art film. The narrative is fragmented, the characters behave inconsistently, 
it's nearly impossible to keep track of time and place, and viewers are 
left with an overall impression of uncertainty. All of this, of course, is there 
by design. Bertolucci, like Michelangelo Antonioni, Alain Resnais, and 
others, was interested in having us question even those elements of film 
comprehension that we normally take for granted: story, plot, time, 
space, action. This is the cinema of the anti-Hollywood.
But don't let this keep you away from the film. The Spider's Stratagem 
(a title that is never explained) is challenging, but few pictures encourage 
such delightful aesthetic consternation: if you go into it not expecting 
to have any questions answered, you will be richly rewarded.
The story concerns a man's (Giulio Brogi) journey to his father's 
hometown, where he intends to uncover the circumstances of his 
questionable political activities. But this simple quest soon takes over 
the protagonist's life; in fact, Bertolucci hints that he begins not only to 
fall in love with his father's former lover but also to become his own father. 
Through clever, innovative editing and framing, Bertolucci consistently 
toys with our narrative expectations. The Spider's Stratagem is a baffling film, 
to be sure, but we are being manipulated by the hands of a master.  EdeS

Ucho  Karel Kachyna, 1970
The Ear
Shot under the watchful eyes of the Soviet occupying forces, Karel 
Kachyna's daring political drama was withheld from circulation immediately 
upon completion. Although The Ear's direct criticism of the rule of right-
wing party leader Gustave Husák distinguishes Kachyna from other 
former New Wave Czech directors, the film's back-to-basics look and hard-
won insights into the not-so-private life of a passionate yet embittered 
married couple are the two main reasons for its enduring interest.
Ludvik (Radoslav Brzobohaty) is a senior official in the bureaucracy 
of Prague's ruling Communist Party. Anna (Jirina Bohdalova) is his 
alcoholic wife, daughter of a small-town pub owner. The couple has a 
young son and lives in a comfortable home. At first, the cruel insults, 
nasty looks, and open hostility they direct toward one another strike the 
viewer as little more than character development in the film—Ludvik 
and Anna coming across as the characteristically depoliticized citizens 
of Czech society at the time. Later we realize that their complex marital 
relationship is at the very center of The Ear's concerns, at once allegorizing 
and distinguishing itself from the equally complex relationship between a 
ruthless, oppressive political regime and its justifiably paranoid populace.
The film's action takes place over the course of one long evening. 
Returning from a political function, Ludvik and Anna find their front gate 
open and the spare set of house keys missing. Initially dismissing this as 
of no consequence, gradually other strange occurrences—including a 
power outage and dead phone lines—make them wonder whether 
they are not under surveillance by suspicious and unethical Communist 
authorities. In his mind's eye, Ludvik replays scenes from earlier that 
night. What initially seemed innocuous now takes on the surreal 
quality of a nightmare, as every sentence spoken to Ludvik—"Sorry, 
the comrades are listening"; "All that counts is whether they accept 
socialist goals"; "Didn't they speak to you?"—seems now to signify that 
he is in great danger. Connecting the dots, Ludvik comes to believe 
that he is a target of the Communist Party and that his arrest is imminent.
Desperate to destroy materials that could be cited as evidence 
against him, Ludvik burns his correspondence. Anna needles him about 
the deteriorating state of their relationship and his lack of interest in 
her both sexually and emotionally. But as dawn approaches, a submerged 
dynamic in their relationship rises to the surface. Expressing tenderness, 
protectiveness, and depth of feeling, they discuss how to proceed once 
the authorities come to take Ludvik away. Anna weeps hysterically. 
Ludvik tries to comfort her, the psychological warfare at an end as Big 
Brother closes in. The analogies established earlier between marriage 
and citizenship diminish. Instead we become sensitive to the dis-analogies: 
the limitless capacity of those in power to plot, conspire, and use advanced 
technology to terrorize, manipulate, and control a population.  SJS

Thomas Berger's novel (published in 1964), on which Arthur Penn's Little 
Big Man is based, is one of the funniest and most original works of 
Western fiction. It relates the picaresque adventures of Jack Crabb, in the 
course of which he is several times captured by Indians, becomes a 
Western gunfighter, meets Wild Bill Hickok, and joins General Custer at 
the Battle of the Little Big Horn. In the movie, Jack is played by Dustin 
Hoffman, and is first encountered at the advanced age of 111 by an 
earnest researcher who swallows whole his unlikely tale.
What follows is a thoroughly entertaining debunking of the Western 
myth, showing Custer to be a vainglorious bully and Hickok an anxious 
neurotic. By contrast, the Cheyenne, who adopt Jack into the tribe, are 
a courteous and life-loving people, especially in the person of Old Lodge 
Skins, wonderfully played by Chief Dan George. The depiction of an 
attack on a Cheyenne camp by Custer's Seventh Cavalry (based on the 
1868 Massacre of the Washita) hardly bothers to disguise its obvious 
reference to the Vietnam War, which was raging at the time the film was 
made, and in particular to the infamous My Lai Massacre.  EB

L'uccello dalle piume di cristallo  
The Bird with the Crystal Plumage  Dario Argento, 1970
An unauthorized version of Fredric Brown's novel The Screaming Mimi—
and far closer to the plot of the original than the "official" 1958 Gerd 
Oswald film—Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage took 
the guidelines for a particularly Italianate spin on the Hitchcockian 
thriller, laid down by Mario Bava in The Evil Eye (1963) and Blood and Black 
Lace (1964). In so doing, the director mapped out his own subgenre 
with this, his first feature.
Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante), an American writer in Rome, is walking 
late at night past a modern art gallery and is alerted by a struggle within. 
Trapped between two glass doors, he sees a man struggling with a 
woman and is helpless as the woman is stabbed. The victim survives and 
the hero is told that her attacker was a serial murderer at large in the city, 
but Musante becomes obsessed with the idea that he saw something 
during the incident that doesn't make sense. As his puzzled girlfriend 
(Suzy Kendall) inevitably catches the killer's interest and the cops follow 
up a bizarre audio clue connected with the title, Musante has a brush with 
the unforgettable skull-faced hit man (Reggie Nalder) from Hitchcock's 
The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and realizes in an ironic-horrific finale 
that he has always been The Man Who Didn't Realize What He Knew.  KN

Patton  Franklin J. Schaffner, 1970
"Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying 
for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die 
for his country." So begins the prologue of Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton.
After such a vivid monologue, the picture trails George C. Scott's 
eponymous lead in a race to fulfill his destiny. First up is Tunisia, then 
Sicily, some tongue-lashing for raucous insubordination, various real-
life vignettes, much German preoccupation with his whereabouts, and 
a snowy race to the Battle of the Bulge. Concluding with Patton's 
demotion, the film's detail-rich canvas enlivens a fascinating personality 
during a moment of historic importance.
Scott's General is both nursemaid to dying men and terror to his foe. 
He's also conflicted about being a modern warrior put-upon by the 
political exigencies of his day. As a poet, trained killer, and acolyte of 
reincarnation, he is an enigma whose maverick sensibilities appealed to 
Vietnam War-era protestors and hawks alike.
His story consists of realistic battle sequences and was born from 
a Francis Ford Coppola cowritten script. Thus Patton valorizes a 
bureaucratic war machine while sanctifying individuality through the 
gravelly voice of a career soldier in what may well be the definitive 
biopic of the 1970s.  GC-Q

It didn't take long before the innovations of Robert Altman's Korean 
War comedy M*A*S*H appeared almost quaint in their simplicity and 
obviousness, especially after Altman himself later compounded his 
achievements with the even more ambitious Nashville (1975). Yet the 
use of chaotically overlapping dialogue within widescreen ensemble 
acting scenes proved as surprising and shocking, at the time of the 
film's release, as Altman's use of gory makeshift operating theaters as a 
vehicle for droll black comedy.
Altman's technique captured his actor's improvisations by zooming 
in from a distance, resulting in some playful thespian anarchy. The 
specter of the Vietnam War loomed large at the time. M*A*S*H's 
antiestablishment streak in many ways reflected the mood of the antiwar 
movement, which increasingly viewed the folly of Vietnam as a black 
comedy itself. In fact, Altman created much of M*A*S*H on the sly, 
tricking the studio into thinking he was making a patriotic war film. 
The studio was ready to shelve the film until test audiences reacted 
favorably. Release led to a wave of acclaim cresting with a number of 
Academy Award nominations, and a successful television spin-off, 
immediately cementing Altman's reputation.  JKl

Zabriskie Point  Michelangelo Antonioni, 1970
Although Michelangelo Antonioni's only American film was poorly 
received when it was released in 1969, time has in some ways been 
kinder to Zabriskie Point than to La Notte, made a decade earlier. The 
director's boldly nonrealistic and poetic approach to American 
counterculture myths, and his loose and deliberately slow approach to 
narrative, may still put some people off. He also cast two young 
unknowns as his romantic leads—a carpenter (Mark Frechette) and a 
college student (Daria Halprin), neither of whom has been seen since—
along with a relatively wooden professional, Rod Taylor. Antonioni was 
at the height of his commercial prestige at the time, having just made 
his only international hit in England (Blowup [1966]), and expectations 
that he would bring off something similar in relation to countercultural 
America were undoubtedly overblown.
But his beautiful handling of widescreen compositions, Pop Art colors 
and subject matter (largely derived from southern California billboards), 
and wistful moods have many lingering aftereffects, and the grand and 
beautiful apocalyptic finale is downright spectacular. Some of Antonioni's 
other pictures—most notably, Red Desert (1964), Eclipse (1962), and The 
Passenger (1975)—end or almost end with passages of stylistic bravura 
that drastically recast as well as summarize everything in the pictures 
preceding them, and in this case, Antonioni doesn't disappoint.  JRos

Not so much a reflection of the 1960s counterculture as an outright 
affront to the Summer of Love, Performance (codirected by Donald 
Cammell and Nicolas Roeg) marked changing mores and attitudes with 
a confrontational and audacious sense of style. Although completed in 
1967, the film sat on the shelf for two years as the studio scratched its 
head. What to do with such a unique and unusual film?
Yet the long wait actually worked to the film's advantage. By the time 
Performance appeared, hippie idealism was on the wane, and the utopia 
of Woodstock had given way to the hell of the Rolling Stones' Altamont 
debacle—captured in the 1970 concert film Gimme Shelter. Performance, 
starring Stones singer Mick Jagger as a debauched aging rock star, only 
heightened its cultural impact ("You'll look funny when you're forty," 
remarks James Fox's Chas to Jagger's Turner).
The story itself is relatively simple. Chas is a gangster (a "performer") 
who decides to give up his life of crime and goes on the lam. Searching 
for a place to secretly wait out his violent pursuers, he discovers a 
reclusive rock star, Turner, who lives a sex-and-drug-filled lifestyle in a 
fun house-like home. Chas realizes this is the last place anyone would 
ever look for him, so he rents a room and bunkers down with Turner and 
his two female housemates (Anita Pallenberg and Michèle Breton). But 
after changing his looks and lifestyle, and with Turner and his Sapphic 
crew as catalysts, Chas begins to change as well.
By the time the story plays out, nothing (and no one) we've seen is 
necessarily what we thought it was. Cammell's script and Roeg's 
camera keep everything off-kilter, not just through skewed drug logic 
but also through overtly and intentionally confusing editing, punctuated 
with startling bursts of violence. Frequent drug-fueled hallucinations 
drive Performance toward its mind-bending conclusion, when art and 
identity intersect and the line between fantasy and reality finally blurs 
into oblivion.  JKl

Woodstock  Michael Wadleigh, 1970
The 1960s generation crashed headlong into unchecked idealism and 
the pressures of practical reality when the last baby boomers reached 
majority age at the end of the decade. Thereafter the United States 
was increasingly embroiled in varied generational conflicts, not least of 
which centered on popular music and growing ambivalence about the 
overall American project. Summer 1969 was therefore a turning point 
and a ripple in time. Although boomers had already splintered into 
factions pursuing an array of cultural values from strictest patriotism 
to hallucinogenic drugs, what was needed was a milestone event to 
convey the fractured spirit of innocence on the cusp of experience. 
The three-day Woodstock Music and Art Festival of Bethel, New York, 
provided just such a punctuation mark and became a historical keynote. 
Its cultural currency has since been co-opted to sell soft drinks and new 
musical acts, although it continues to be the mirror through which the 
state of 1960s youth is displayed in a flash of celebration and song.
As captured by documentarian Michael Wadleigh, who employed, 
among others, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, and Thelma Schoonmaker 
on the picture, the best-laid plans of Woodstock's concert promoters 
are seen failing the realities of the event. Set in a paddock some distance 
from East Coast urban centers and with few approaching surface roads, 
a storm turns the Woodstock fields into a big mud puddle. Concert-goers 
show up in the thousands, way over estimates, to be serenaded by the 
best of R&B, rock, folk, and funk. Flooded and inconvenienced as they 
are, they become the most famous massed music audience for one of 
the greatest performance events ever staged.
The music, the atmosphere, the mythology, all of it together now 
symbolizes everything lost in the 1970s and the resulting baby boomlet. 
The point is made most forcefully in the brilliant, nearly four-hour long 
director's cut of Wadleigh's film, since mimicked by innumerable music-
oriented movies and media spectacles. Woodstock's split-screen 
techniques, stereophonic sound recording, simultaneous and multiple-
coverage of events, and detached viewpoint fill the screen with 
absolutely accurate observations. The attitude of reportage further 
contributes to the film's value as a snapshot of the times without 
imposing too much of an authorial point of view, but still looking on with 
wonder now lost but once gloriously true.
Vignettes center on concert-goers dealing with festival discomforts 
and townies reacting to the waves of outsiders streaming into their 
village. Bad acid makes its way through the crowd. Marriage proposals 
are matched. Food is airlifted in to help relieve a state of emergency. 
People skinny-dip, clean outhouses, smoke pot, smile, and sleep, all in

set by Crosby, Stills, and Nash, an appearance by Janis Joplin, the garage-

Rock documentaries are generally prosaic affairs, at best good extended 
promotional films for their subjects, at worst overlong pop videos with 
bad interviews. There are noble exceptions, the most famous being 
D.A. Pennebaker's Bob Dylan documentary Don't Look Back (1967), but 
even that is only a heightened diary, a fly-on-the-wall character study. 
The most alarming and dramatically satisfying rock documentary must 
surely be the Maysles Brothers' Gimme Shelter, a film of the Rolling 
Stones' 1969 U.S. tour.
With its narrative structure (partially imposed rather than cinema 
verité-style inherent) and its climax, the disastrous, tragic free concert at 
Altamont Speedway on December 6, 1969, Gimme Shelter is a harrowing, 
exciting social commentary and rock 'n' roll all at the same time. The film 
begins conventionally enough, with the Stones performing at Madison 
Square Garden, but then cuts to an editing room, some months later, 
where the band are listening to a radio report on the aftermath of 
Altamont. This is a directed narrative, product of Albert and David 
Maysles's (and editor/codirector Charlotte Zwerin's) belief in direct 
cinema, which used techniques drawn from "fictional" moviemaking and 
applied them to nonfiction works. Thus the Altamont concert is "reedited" 
to increase dramatic tension; sticklers for realism may carp at the fact 
that the murder of black concert-goer Meredith Hunter takes place 
during the wrong Stones song, but the Maysles were editing for dramatic 
effect, not for rock history books. Gimme Shelter ends with the Rolling 
Stones watching the murder (committed by one of the Hells Angels hired 
by the band for "security" purposes) in their editing suite. It's a unique 
moment, rock stars confronted by the consequences of their own actions.
The movie helped seal the image both of the Stones as rock devils 
and, more importantly, of Altamont as the anti-Woodstock, as negative 
closure to the 1960s. It suggested that the counterculture was really a 
lot of drugged fools who thought murder was a "bummer" and that the 
1960s dream was well and truly over. That may be debatable, but the 
force and drama of this documentary are not.  KK

Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini  Vittorio De Sica, 1970
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
517
Vittorio De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis marked an international 
comeback for a director who had never stopped working, but whose 
star had fallen since the days of Neorealist masterpieces like Umberto D 
(1952). Its story, derived from Giorgio Bassani's novel of Italian Jews 
slowly adapting to the coming Fascist oppression, compellingly spoke 
to a 1970s audience appreciating the resurgence of such political-
historical themes in art-house cinema.
The story holds off its tragic punchline until the end, meanwhile 
intimating it as a dark shadow while the characters obliviously enjoy 
their last revelries. The beautiful young things who gather in their high-
bourgeois paradise are caught in an agonizing daisy chain of mismatched 
desires—no one, straight or gay, is loved by the person they want.
Stylistically, the film is no masterpiece. But it comes alive in those 
moments when De Sica rivets his camera in close-up on his glamorous 
stars (Dominique Sanda and Helmut Berger especially), in order to 
observe the furtive darting of their soulfully expressive eyes. The Garden 
of Finzi-Continis is a keen, touching parable about the interrelation of 
personal and political, private, and public drama. The encroaching social 
tragedy renders the romantic palpitations by turns petty, desperate, 
absurd, and poignant.  AM
Dirty Harry  Don Siegel, 1971
One of the most influential and controversial police movies ever made, 
Dirty Harry is a canny mix of the simple and the sophisticated. The 
characters, notably supercop Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and 
superpsycho Scorpio (Andy Robinson), are vivid, hyperbolic cartoons. They 
gain definition not through psychological depth and nuance but through 
their interaction with the film's intricate, richly articulated environments.
Brilliantly exploiting San Francisco locations, director Don Siegel gets 
a high-low motif going in the first shots, zooming back to reveal a woman 
swimming in a sky-blue pool on a high-rise roof while a sniper draws 
a bead on her from the top of another, taller building. From then on, 
the film soars and plunges in roller-coaster contours to delineate a 
multileveled metropolis where a precarious Sky City of helicopters, 
hilltops, rooftops, glass towers, and enveloping fog perches over a 
primitive underworld of burrows, tunnels, alleys, and quarries. No mere 
backdrop to the action, this formidable labyrinth molds and tests the 
characters as they twist and fight their way through it. This is vividly 
depicted in the tour de force sequence in which Scorpio runs Harry 
ragged from one end of town to the other as part of an evasive scheme 
to receive a bundle of ransom money.  MR

A Clockwork Orange  Stanley Kubrick, 1971
Stanley Kubrick's most controversial film, a social sci-fi fable made in 
1971, was withdrawn in the United Kindom by the director himself for 
nearly thirty years despite its initial, phenomenally successful but heavily 
criticized release. It resurfaced, enveloped in mystique, not long after his 
death. A Clockwork Orange is still electrifying, a bold translation of the 
dystopian Anthony Burgess novel that was itself published to a mixture 
of acclaim and notoriety in 1959 and was long believed unfilmable.
Delinquent but clever, smart-aleck youth Alex De Large (Malcolm 
McDowell) gets his kicks from pornography, Beethoven, and leading his 
bowler-hatted, white overall-clad gang of "Droogs" (including a baby-
faced Warren Clark) on hectic vivid rampages of "ultra-violence" in which 
they speak a distinctive argot, a hybrid of Russian and London Cockney 
rhyming slang. The most disturbing scene in this first, twenty-minute 
section of the film is one that comes back to haunt Alex when he is 
helpless. After breaking into a futuristic luxury home, they cripple the 
husband (Patrick Magee) and rape the wife (Adrienne Corri) while Alex 
bellows "Singin' in the Rain," aiming vicious blows of his Doc Marten boots 
to the rhythm of the song. Although it is interesting that the rape looms 
large in memories as particularly nasty, Kubrick cuts away from the 
woman's ordeal just as Alex finishes cutting away her skin-tight red 
jumpsuit. Another thrill-seeking outing culminates in Alex bashing in a 
woman's brains with a giant phallic sculpture, the crime for which he is 
eventually apprehended.
But the institutionalized brutality that ensues in Alex's punishment 
and his "rehabilitation" into a craven, boot-licking victim is just as scary as 
the Droogs' misdeeds, and more thought provoking, in this scathing satire 
of society's hypocrisy, corruption, and sadism. Seeing a way out of prison, 
Alex cockily volunteers for a politically showcased, experimental aversion 
therapy and is subjected to dire behaviorist "cure"—strapped down, his 
eyes clamped wide open—that suppresses his violent tendencies but 
also robs him of his essential humanity. Stripped of his capacity to commit 
evil, he is an enfeebled individual. Back in the world, he doesn't enjoy 
his "freedom." Betrayed by former thug-comrades, who, ironically, 
have become policemen, he ultimately gets a hilariously unnerving 
comeuppance in an encounter with one of his damaged victims.
Kubrick's arresting vision of the not-too-distant future is amusingly 
dated in some details (vinyl records, Alex's IBM typewriter), and the 
violence for which it was so castigated on its release is discreet by 
contemporary standards. But the picture of aimless louts alleviating their 
boredom in mindless viciousness is chillingly topical, as is the real issue 
at the picture's center—the fragility of individuality and personal rights 
when they do not conform to the desires of the state. Stylish and often 
startlingly funny, with a delirious soundtrack, A Clockwork Orange still 
packs far more punch than its many blatantly derivative descendants.  AE

At the peak of his 1970s powers, director Robert Altman seemed capable 
of anything. Even so, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, arriving between M*A*S*H 
(1970) and Nashville (1975), is something special, an elegiac tale of the 
Old West imbued with a sense of contemporary filmmaking adventure. 
Set in the Pacific Northwest in the early 1900s, the film stars a quiet 
Warren Beatty as the titular braggart, a cowardly but charismatic man 
who has lucked into a position of power. But the nature of the country 
is changing around him, and Beatty can't see the inevitable, violent 
consequences of progress for all his narcissistic pipe dreams.
Altman wanted his film to capture the feeling of an old photograph, 
so he instructed cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond to flash-expose the 
film, resulting in a heavy haze that hangs over the image. Another 
brilliant decision was the use of Leonard Cohen for the film's 
anachronistic soundtrack, as the singer-songwriter's gloomy folk music 
perfectly suits the somber mood and darkly lit, snowy scenery. But best 
of all may be the casting of Julie Christie as an opium-addicted madam. 
She lends the role an ethereal quality at odds with Beatty's more natural 
performance as a bearded buffoon in a big fur coat, and hers is a ghostly 
presence that portends bad things to come.
McCabe and Mrs. Miller mourns the death of the Wild West even as 
it signals the fertile start of the 1970s filmmaking renaissance. The 
picture is filled with striking widescreen imagery as well as Altman's 
usual roving camerawork, but the exercise exudes a palpable sadness 
here. McCabe and Mrs. Miller's message seems to be that progress and 
capitalism go hand in hand, and not always for the better. The flourishing 
success of Beatty's frontier town initially draws workers, then well-
wishers, but his hard work and vision mean nothing to the men who 
ultimately want to take it away. Altman's view of America as an 
experiment in Darwinism (accelerated with guns) might strike some as 
cynical, but the spectral visuals lend the film a palpable sadness that 
supplants any specific message.  JKl

Le chagrin et la pitié  Marcel Ophüls, 1971
The Sorrow and the Pity
521
For over two decades, French society seemed unwilling to examine the 
moral questions raised by the German occupation, but the disturbances 
of May 1968 led to a new openness. Marcel Ophüls's documentary The 
Sorrow and the Pity focuses on events in the town of Clermont-Ferrand. 
Though receiving initial support from French national television, Ophüls 
was not allowed to broadcast it. Instead, the film opened in art houses, 
quickly becoming the year's most controversial production. Worldwide 
distribution followed, and this four-hour recording of the reminiscences 
of survivors of the period, interspersed with archival footage, quickly 
became one of world cinema's most acclaimed documentaries.
Ophüls picked a town in the "free zone" of Vichy France so that he 
could explore the ways in which the collaborationist government 
operated. His informants ranged from members of the nobility to 
peasants to former German soldiers. With a minimum of narration and 
distorting generalizations, The Sorrow and the Pity captures the 
ambiguities and contradictions of the period. The sense of the film, 
however, is the chagrin (sorrow, but also shame) of its title, established 
by the insistent questions of the interviewer and the lies or distortions 
that become obvious across the different forms of testimony and the 
unrehearsed reactions of the interviewees to difficult inquiries.  RBP
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  
Mel Stuart, 1971
Although most children's movies are saccharine, if not silly, Mel Stuart's 
adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children's novel is a happy exception. 
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a juvenile black comedy replete 
with flash visuals, engaging songs, and an over-the-top performance by 
Gene Wilder as the title character, whose claim to fame is being the 
world's greatest candy maker.
Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in his candy bars, and those who 
find them get to tour the factory and receive a lifetime supply of sweets. 
The factory offers a gallery of marvels, including a river of chocolate. The 
catch for the lucky winners is that they must obey Wonka's difficult and 
capricious rules. The point of the exercise, however, is to identify the one 
child who is truly honest (it turns out, of course, to be the most charming 
and irascible of the group). His reward is to be the inheritor of Wonka's 
factory; one day he will become the chocolate maker whose duty is not 
only to cater to children but also to provide the proper rite of passage 
into the adult world. Like The Wizard of Oz (1939), Willy Wonka is full of 
strange creatures, artificial sets, and lively song and dance numbers. A 
film to entertain the young and set their elders to thinking.  RBP

The Devils  Ken Russell, 1971
Ken Russell's film ("my most, indeed my only, political film," he insisted) 
was inspired by Aldous Huxley's "non-fiction novel" The Devils of Loudun. 
In the 1630s Louis XIII of France was leveling the fortifications of any 
town that might resist his rule. Loudun held out, led by its parish priest, 
Father Urbain Grandier. Conveniently, a local convent of Ursuline nuns 
began exhibiting hysterical symptoms, cavorting naked and screaming 
that Grandier had seduced them with the help of devils. Grandier was 
tried, found guilty, and burnt alive. The walls of Loudun were demolished.
To Russell, the story's mix of religion, sex, and politics proved 
irresistible. As Grandier, Oliver Reed gives a career-best performance, 
moving from a preening libertine to something gentler in his love for the 
widowed Madeleine (Gemma Jones), as the shadows of his fate darken 
around him. He's matched by Vanessa Redgrave as the hunchbacked Sister 
Jeanne of the Angels, lusting vengefully over the priest's tortured body. 
The film caused outrage; both the British and American censors 
demanded extensive cuts. The film's backers, Warner Bros., were horrified 
upon seeing it, and insisted on a sanitized version. Today it looks less 
shocking, and Russell's trademark visual flamboyance perfectly suits his 
sensational story of nudity, masturbation, blasphemy, torture, and 
blackest political skulduggery.  PK
Following the phenomenal success of Easy Rider (1969), leading man 
Peter Fonda was given the green light by Universal to direct any project 
of his choosing. The result, and the first of the three films Fonda would 
direct, was The Hired Hand, an elegiac and under-appreciated Western 
whose stature only came to light with an astonishing 2002 restoration. 
Chasing their dream of a better life, Harry (Fonda) and his good friend 
Archie (Warren Oates) have drifted across the plains of America together. 
However, Harry has grown weary of his transient existence and has 
decided to return to the home and wife, Hannah (Verna Bloom), he had 
abandoned many years before. At first refuting acceptance, Hannah 
orders him to sleep in the barn and work the farm as a hired hand. After 
confessing that she has taken former help as lovers, the romance slowly 
rekindles. However, when news reaches Harry that Archie has run intro 
trouble in a seedy town, he is forced to make a fateful choice. 
Eschewing action in favor of a more melancholic tone, The Hired Hand 
is remarkable for its trio of excellent performances, Vilmos Zsigmond's 
astonishing cinematography, and its radical feminist overtones. Set to a 
mournful score by Dylan cohort Bruce Langhorne, the film's final shot of 
Hannah accepting her loss and abandonment is among the most 
remarkable of any closing image in the genre.  JWo

The Hired Hand  Peter Fonda, 1971

Dusan Makavejev's most critically acclaimed film, W.R: Mysteries of the 
Organism, is a magnificently obscene parody of Cold War politics and 
social mores. It tells the story of three warring cultures in the late 1960s: 
old-fashioned Soviet-style communism, U.S. bourgeois militarism, and 
the sexual revolutionaries whose values put them at odds with both.
These cultures are explored through interlocked narratives whose 
juxtaposition is utterly silly and disturbing by turns. A documentary look 
at the life of radical psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich is intercut with a goofy 
fictional spoof of communist Yugoslavia, in which the sexually liberated, 
feminist-communist Milena tries to seduce an old-fashioned Russian 
"People's artist." We also follow The Fugs's singer Tuli Kupferberg around 
Manhattan and see footage of Stalin from a 1946 Soviet propaganda flick, 
as well as medical films of people getting electroshock therapy. 
Occasionally we are treated to interviews with American sexual subversives.
The cumulative effect of these story fragments is a growing sense 
that the world is in chaos because politics try—and fail—to constrain 
sexual desire. Makavejev is famous for saying that his collage-style 
filmmaking represents the true embodiment of Eisenstein's ideal of 
dialectical montage because Eisenstein himself just didn't have a good 
enough sense of humor to do it right. W.R. may be the only avant-garde 
slapstick communist documentary sex romp ever made. That alone 
makes it a must-see.  AN

Nicolas Roeg's second feature as director (and first solo effort) is 
deceptively simple: a bowler-hatted office worker (John Meillon) drives 
into the empty heart of Australia with his sixteen year-old daughter 
(Jenny Agutter) and much younger son (Luc Roeg). The father sets fire 
to the car and shoots himself, stranding the siblings in the desert. At a 
dried-out waterhole, they meet an Aborigine youth (David Gulpilil) who 
is on his "walkabout," a time apart from the tribe when he must commune 
with nature. Of course, the city kids' spell in the wild also serves as a 
walkabout of their own, during which they learn something that is muted 
when they return to their lives, leaving behind a devastation that only 
the doomed Aborigine understands.
Walkabout is a deep film, but it's also elusive: constantly forcing you 
to think for yourself, or accept that some mysteries should never be solved. 
The story begins and ends with suicides that we don't have enough 
information to "understand." If the story (from a novel by James Vance 
Marshall) were to be remade conventionally, the film would be full of 
exciting wilderness perils and go heavy on the kind of love affair between 
the repressed miss and the nature boy that you get in Blue Lagoon (1980). 
Instead, a drama of transformation and tragedy is played out through 
apparently throwaway dialogue. Flashes of cinematic trickery, footnote-
like scenes, provide a "civilized" contrast with wilderness behavior—
Gulpilil's spearing and bludgeoning of a kangaroo is intercut with shots 
of a butcher knife impersonally chopping cuts of meat—combined with 
documentary footage of crawling lizards and swarming insects.
The normal skills associated with "acting" aren't required here, and 
Roeg cast two of the major roles with players who had never acted 
before, the Aborigine Gulpilil—later a fixture in Australian cinema—and 
his own son Luc. Walkabout lives in the fantasies of a generation because 
Agutter, in and out of school uniform (she has a famous nude swim), 
emerged from her prim Railway Children television series image to be 
strikingly sensual as the girl who takes a "memory" of something that 
never happened back to the city.  KN

The post-Vietnam/Watergate sensibilities of 1970s cinema were never 
more evident than in Alan Pakula's classic neonoir Klute. From the 
fetishized phone conversation of the opening credits, the director makes 
us aware of the surveillance age that would culminate so strikingly in 
Francis Coppola's The Conversation (1974). Klute is an unconventional film 
that is both detective thriller and character-driven mood piece, one rife 
with subtexts of urban decay and a claustrophobic sense of helplessness.
Despite the title, this is Bree Daniels's (Jane Fonda) story, and its 
success relies on the complex inner life of Fonda's call girl, who is neither 
your typical tramp with a heart of gold nor a total bitch. Fonda's turn is 
the crowning achievement of her career. Bree wants to be an actress and 
model, and Pakula's depiction of New York makes it understandable that 
she would need to turn tricks to survive, as it is all just another acting job.
Enter John Klute (Donald Sutherland), a small-town detective out of 
his depth in the underbelly of New York vice and fraud, and an enigma 
for Bree as he seems beyond corruption. Sutherland's morally uptight 
investigator fascinates her enough to allow him into a world he could 
never hope to enter on his own. Much like Paul Schrader's Hardcore 
(1979), a small-town innocent is drawn into the shadowland of urban 
wickedness only to find it pathetic, and reaches out to a damaged soul 
in hopes of salvation, even if a relationship is out of the question. 
As a mystery, Klute has no real suspense because the killer's identity 
is made known early on. The dynamic between the two leads is what 
keeps the film on target. The real joy is Fonda's acting virtuosity, and her 
ability to register so many edges and contradictions on camera. Pakula's 
aesthetic centers on the voyeuristic pleasure of watching Bree develop 
into a nonhero as fear envelopes her world and her tough veneer starts 
to crumble when she must trust a man, perhaps for the first time.
As for Pakula, his three masterworks (Klute, The Parallax View [1974], 
and All the President's Men [1976]) more than justify his place among the 
great directors of the 1970s or any other decade. His style remained 
unique to the last.  DDV

Harold and Maude  Hal Ashby, 1971
The label of "cult film" is commonly used today as a marketing stunt for 
quasi-independent or mainstream films flirting with various subcultures. 
Harold and Maude, however, is the genuine thing, combining the 
directorial talents of former editor Hal Ashby with the oddball personas 
of main actors Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon. Cort, age twenty-one, had just 
done his first leading part as a flight-obsessed kid in Robert Altman's 
Brewster McCloud (1970). Ex-screenwriter Gordon, age seventy-six, had 
a string of memorable supporting roles behind her in the 1960s, the most 
well known being her Manhattan witch in Rosemary's Baby (1968), for 
which she won an Academy Award. In Harold and Maude, their peculiar 
chemistry made them an engaging, unforgettable romantic couple, 
challenging taboos of youth, aging, sex, death, and happiness.
Most interesting, perhaps, is that this challenge not only is a run-of-the-
mill counterculture pose against traditional patriarchal society, but is even 
more aggressively directed against the contemporary youth-quake. This 
is primarily made by reversing the 1960s concept of youth as the vital, 
mold-breaking counterforce to the inevitable physical and spiritual 
deadness affecting everybody over age thirty. Here the young and rich 
Harold is a living corpse because of his inability to break free from an 
oedipal fixation with his cold mother (Vivian Pickles), whose attention he 
tries to get in vain through a series of hilarious fake suicide attempts. It is 
only when he meets the old but vital and anarchic Maude that he comes 
to life. Thus Harold's fear of life is equated with a fear of growing up and 
aging. Maude, on the other hand, is not afraid of death, having survived 
the Nazi prison camps (implied by the number tattooed on her arm flashing 
by in a shot). Rather, we learn at the end of the film that she longs for it.
Ironically, this strange love story grows out of their obsessive habit 
of attending funerals, which—for different reasons, as we have seen—
have a therapeutic value for them both. And it is to Ashby's credit that 
he doesn't turn this into a sentimental story of platonic friendship, in 
which the old and wise gives the young and reckless life lessons. Instead, 
Maude is the reckless one, impulsively acting out all her fantasies even 
to the point of stealing cars and seducing boys sixty years younger than 
herself. And it is their sexual liaison that is the key to this film, revolting 
as it seems to several of the characters and possibly to many in the 
audience—even to those who think of themselves as "liberated." The 
words of Eric Christmas's preaching priest that the thought of Harold's 
young body having intercourse with Maude's aging flesh "makes me 
want to puke," brings to mind acts of necromancy or a gothic horror film 
in which the old monster feeds on the young victim. Triumphantly, 
though, Harold and Maude rids us of all such cultural preconceptions. In 
the final scene, in which Maude prepares to die on her eightieth birthday, 
this bias toward youth is replaced with the existential insight that death 
is ultimately what gives life meaning.  MT

Together with Bullitt (1968) and Dirty Harry (1971), The French Connection 
spearheaded the cop-movie revival that took place around 1970. Loosely 
based on fact, it centers on the fanatical efforts of New York City police 
detective "Popeye" Doyle (Gene Hackman) to intercept a heroin shipment 
engineered by the urbane Marseilles entrepreneur Charnier (Fernando 
Rey). Although its view of the war on drugs as a class struggle waged by 
street cops against establishment fat cats now seems dated, The French 
Connection remains a tremendously exciting and powerful movie.
The editing—its rough-edged energy enhanced by jagged, truncated 
scene transitions—conveys both off-balance disorientation and reckless 
forward propulsion. The celebrated chase scene, in which Doyle's car 
hurtles down a busy avenue in pursuit of an elevated train, never seems 
an overblown set piece, because it simply extends the kinetic, careering, 
tunnel-vision effect sustained throughout the film.
The French Connection's view of the embattled "drugopolis" goes 
beyond its impressively squalid locations to encompass a resonant 
interplay between different cityscapes. Gritty, grungy New York is at first 
ironically contrasted with spacious, gracious Marseilles and then split 
into two of its boroughs: Manhattan, citadel of the rich and powerful, 
and Brooklyn, cockpit of junkies, small-time hoods, and street cops. An 
added twist is provided by a brief scene in Washington, D.C.—shown as 
a lifeless White City, detached from the real urban battlegrounds.
Has there ever been a Best Picture Oscar winner with such a downbeat 
ending? After chasing Charnier into a hideously decayed building, Doyle 
not only loses his man but also gets swallowed up by his obsession. Too 
demented to acknowledge that he has just fragged an FBI agent, Doyle 
disappears in futile pursuit. The final scene can be read as an apocalyptic 
vision of the city's future, the ruined building as a relic of a lost civilization, 
the doorway through which Doyle vanishes as the gate of hell. The 
awesome bleakness of this conclusion is what lifts The French Connection 
above the level of middlebrow award winners and into the ranks of truly 
gripping films.  MR

Még kér a nép  Miklós Jancsó, 1971
Red Psalm
529
The 1997 documentary East Side Story assumes that Eastern-Bloc directors 
were just itching to make Hollywood extravaganzas that invariably looked 
strained, square, and ill equipped. But Red Psalm, Miklós Jancsó's dazzling, 
open-air revolutionary pageant, is a sensual communist musical that 
employs occasional nudity as lyrically as the singing, dancing, and nature.
Set in the nineteenth century, when a group of peasants have 
demanded basic rights from a landowner and soldiers arrive on 
horseback, Red Psalm consists of only twenty-six shots, each one an 
intricate choreography of panning camera, landscape, and clustered 
bodies. Jancsó's awesome fusion of form with content, politics with 
poetry, equals the exciting innovations of the French New Wave. 
The picture may well be the greatest Hungarian film of its time, 
summing up an entire strain in his work that lamentably has 
been forgotten in the United States. One of Jancsó's characteristic 
achievements is to create a striking continuum between past and 
present, a sense of immediacy about history found in few other period 
films. This suggests that the charge of formalism frequently leveled 
against him stems from an inability to fully comprehend his historical 
and political meanings—combined with an understandable effort to 
become intoxicated by the stylistic virtuosity and beauty.  JRos
Get Carter  Mike Hodges, 1971
Gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine), who works as strong-arm man for 
a London mob, returns to his northern hometown of Newcastle to 
avenge the death of his brother. While there, he finds himself genocidally 
involved in a complicated series of faction fights between local crooks, 
and is set up to take a fall because he has unwisely been fooling around 
with his boss's girlfriend Anna (Britt Ekland).
Among Get Carter's interestingly cast provincial hoodlums are 
playwright John Osborne—surprisingly convincing as an effete gangland 
figure—and reliable hardhead Ian Hendry, memorably described as 
having eyes "like pissholes in the snow." Blunt and forceful, with effective 
use of location, Mike Hodges's film makes no concessions to morality and 
yet hardly condones the brutalities of its characters, with Caine getting a 
couple of shocks as he discovers that his niece (who might be his 
daughter) has starred in a credibly amateur porno movie, then coming 
to a bad end after he extracts rough justice on a deserted beach. 
Memorable scenes include a stark-naked Caine with a shotgun ejecting 
a couple of thugs from his bed-and-breakfast; the car going into the 
docks with an unnoticed passenger in the trunk; and a mob boss taking 
a dive from a multistory parking garage.  KN

Shaft  Gordon Parks, 1971
"He's cool and tough. He's a black private dick who's a sex machine with 
all the chicks. He doesn't take orders from anybody, black or white, but 
he'd risk his neck for his brother man. I'm talkin' about Shaft. Can you dig 
it?" These lines, from Isaac Hayes's Oscar-winning theme, serve as the 
perfect introduction to Richard Roundtree's African-American hero/
rebel/icon John Shaft, eponymous star of the wildly successful feature 
directed by Gordon Parks. Shaft followed directly on the heels of Melvin 
Van Peebles's Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) and is widely 
acknowledged as the film that initiated the short-lived (but fondly 
remembered) blaxploitation cinema explosion of the 1970s.
The screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, author of a series of 
popular detective novels featuring the movie's protagonist. After the 
success of Sweetback, MGM gave Parks—an esteemed African-American 
photographer, writer, composer, and filmmaker—the go-ahead for a 
project that would hopefully capitalize on the fast-emerging black 
market. Parks wanted a fresh face to play the lead, and found exactly 
what he was looking for in Roundtree, a former Ebony model and 
occasional theater actor whose physical presence and acting chops 
provided just the right combination of machismo, virility, and confidence 
for the part.
The film's convoluted plot is fairly standard hard-boiled detective fare. 
After inadvertently causing the death of a gangster who shows up at his 
office, Shaft is coerced by a pair of white police inspectors to help them 
gather information about a gang war rumored to be taking place in 
Harlem. Meanwhile, a drug-dealing black godfather hires Shaft to save 
his daughter from the men who have recently kidnapped her. This turns 
out to be the Italian Mafia, so with the help of a former comrade and his 
cadre of black nationalist followers, Shaft undertakes a dangerous but 
ultimately successful rescue mission. The mostly nonstop action is 
interrupted twice by romantic interludes. Shaft has no qualms about 
cheating on his girlfriend, and proves himself an equal-opportunity lover.
If ever there was a film in which the narrative is simply a vehicle for 
showcasing a particular character, Shaft is it. Together, Tidyman, Parks, 
and Roundtree create a strong black protagonist who—for the first time 
in Hollywood cinema—makes his own rules, listens to no one, gives the 
orders instead of taking them, and is not the least bit afraid of making 
jokes at the expense of white authority figures. Despite (perhaps 
because of) its subversive lead and militant undertones, Shaft did 
remarkable business among both black and white audiences, grossing 
over $23 million at U.S. box offices alone. Such broad-ranging success is 
partly explained by the fact that Shaft is perfectly comfortable in any 
situation, with people of every stripe (including a blatantly homosexual 
bartender, who feels compelled to pinch his butt), and that his magnetism 
and coolness under fire transcend mere color boundaries.  SJS

Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song  
Melvin Van Peebles, 1971
"This film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who have had 
enough of the Man." With the $70,000 he earned from his 1970 race-
reversal comedy Watermelon Man, plus additional funds (including a 
$50,000 loan from Bill Cosby), Melvin Van Peebles—one of the first 
African-American directors to work in Hollywood—financed his new 
project, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. Van Peebles wrote, directed, 
scored, and starred in the film, which not only was a sound economic 
decision but also ensured his creative control over every facet of 
production. Early in 1971, Sweetback opened in the only two theaters that 
would agree to show it on a first-run basis. By the end of the year the film 
had become the most profitable independent production in history. A 
sleeper hit across the nation, it ended up grossing over $15 million.
Sweetback is a film so original in both conception and realization that 
it defied all expectations, providing a popular alternative to the dominant 
Hollywood paradigm. But it is also a film that borrows narrative threads 
and conventions from an assortment of different genres, including the 
chase film, the gangster movie, the biker flick, and the soft-core porno. 
Finally, Sweetback is a film whose huge and unanticipated commercial 
success ensured its place at the head of an explosion in black-marketed, 
black-cast, and black-directed productions—an explosion that soon 
went by the ambivalent name of "blaxploitation cinema."
The shocking first scene finds a preteen Sweetback (played by Melvin's 
son, Mario) working in a whorehouse, where a grateful call girl screams 
out his nickname during orgasm. We next observe the grown-up 
Sweetback performing as a stud in a sex show in South Central Los 
Angeles. Watching as two white cops proceed to beat a young black 
activist (Hubert Scales) within an inch of his life, Sweetback jumps the 
officers and nearly kills them. The rest of the film tracks our hero's progress 
as he rides, runs, and hitches in a desperate effort at avoiding capture. At 
one point, Sweetback has his life threatened by a motorcycle gang, and 
only survives by winning a public sex duel with the female leader. And 
that's just the beginning—as one reviewer describes it, Sweetback "evades 
the police by raping a black woman at knifepoint, spears a cop with a pool 
cue, kills a number of dogs tracking him, heals himself with his own urine, 
and bites off the head of a lizard before escaping across the Mexican 
border into the desert." The film concludes with the words "A Baadasssss 
nigger is coming to collect some dues" flashing across the screen.
Whatever one makes of Sweetback's sociopolitical "message," the 
energy and innovativeness of Van Peeble's directorial style can hardly be 
denied. By making creative use of such techniques as montage, 
superimposition, freeze-frames, jump cuts, zoom ins, split-screen editing, 
stylized dialogue, multiply exposed scenes, and a soulful musical score, 
Van Peebles broke new ground and challenged viewers of all colors.  SJS

An ardent formalist at a time when his early 1970s peers were spending 
their time breaking rules, Peter Bogdanovich doggedly stuck to 
old-fashioned ideals and ideas when directing The Last Picture Show. In 
this sense, his adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel stands as a eulogy 
for the previous generation of master filmmakers (like Howard Hawks 
or John Ford) as a new generation of youthful pioneers steered 
filmmaking in a looser, more visceral direction.
A coming-of-age story set in a small, dusty Texas town, The Last 
Picture Show bids adieu to the 1950s, capturing the nation's shifting 
mores and interests. A superb cast of newcomers (including Jeff 
Bridges, Cybill Sheppard, Randy Quaid, and Timothy Bottoms) plays 
against such veterans as Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson as they all 
try to find their place in a changing world. Bogdanovich's vision is 
bleak but honest, and he captures (in stark but striking black and 
white) the awkward moments when innocence lurches into 
experience, without judgment and without pat nostalgia. The film is 
like a wake for an entire era, ripe with tragedy and exuding a heavy pall 
of unmistakable sadness.  JKl

1971
Louis Malle liked to call Murmur of the Heart "my first film." In fact it was 
his eighth feature, but the first one he scripted on his own. It was also, 
he felt, his "first happy, optimistic film." Loosely based on Malle's own 
adolescent memories, it is set in a world seen entirely through the eyes 
of its hero, the fifteen-year-old Laurent Chevalier (Benoît Ferreux). The 
episodic plot springs few surprises: Laurent resents his father, adores 
his pretty young mother, veers unpredictably between childhood and 
adulthood, and is fascinated and disconcerted by his own rampant 
sexuality. The film's freshness lies in its evocative re-creation of 
bourgeois, provincial, French society of the early 1950s—and in the 
physical immediacy of family life, shown as a rich, lively mixture of jokes, 
fights, embarrassment, horseplay, feuds, and alliances.
The film's key moment—which ran it into major problems with the 
French government—is the act of incest between Laurent and his 
mother, filmed by Malle with great subtlety and discretion. Audaciously, 
he treats it not as a source of guilt and trauma, but as a loving, liberating 
event, to be recalled (as Laurent's mother tells him) "not with remorse, 
but with tenderness . . . as something beautiful."  PK

Le souffle au coeur  Louis Malle, 1971
Murmur of the Heart
Wanda  Barbara Loden, 1971
The heartbreaking final image of Wanda—a freeze-frame snapshot of 
the eponymous character sadly drifting through a life of small-town bars 
and quiet misery—is given further tragic resonance through the 
knowledge that this masterpiece of American independent cinema 
remained the only film ever directed by its star, Barbara Loden, before 
she succumbed to cancer in 1980. The wife of Elia Kazan (and actress in 
Kazan's Wild River [1960] and Splendor in the Grass [1961]), Loden derived 
inspiration from the improvisational cinema verité rhythms of the 
burgeoning independent film movement of the late 1960s with this raw, 
naturalistic portrait of a destitute, uneducated young woman in a 
Pennsylvania steel town who abandons her husband and children with 
the same degree of apathy that guides her subsequent entanglement 
with a bullying bank robber (Michael Higgins).
Loden admirably refuses to transform her protagonist into a symbolic 
martyr for feminist causes, just as she also never shies from depicting 
Wanda's complicity in making poor choices—and yet one can't help but 
retain great empathy for Wanda and her shattered self-esteem. Expertly 
coaxing authentic performances from a cast mixing professionals with 
local nonactors, Loden has chronicled a type of character rarely glimpsed 
in American film—and in the process, she also created one of the greatest 
"one-shot" directing achievements in this country's cinema. TCr

Sam Peckinpah was not a director known for his delicacy, and indeed 
Straw Dogs remains his most divisive and galvanizing film, especially 
following the more stylized Western violence of the 1969 film The Wild 
Bunch. Dustin Hoffman plays a timid mathematician who moves with his 
wife Susan George to her childhood village in the United Kingdom. There 
she flaunts her success and beauty before the insular townsfolk, who 
treat the arrival of Hoffman and her as an intrusion, and it's clear that 
their already rocky marriage may collapse under the strain. Hoffman, for 
his part, grows more and more uncomfortable, and the townsfolk more 
and more bold in their contempt for the couple—but it is only when his 
wife is raped that Hoffman explodes with violence. 
More than just implicitly supporting vigilantism—the apparently 
inevitable outcome when one man is pushed too far—Straw Dogs proves 
equally ambiguous when it comes to George's character. She parades 
around in tight sweaters and flirts shamelessly with old flames, so when 
she is finally assaulted, Peckinpah initially makes it appear as if she'd invited 
the horrific invasion, both as an affront to her bookish husband and also 
as a provocative response to his inaction. But that ambiguity quickly 
passes as Peckinpah plays up the terror of the infamous rape scene, and 
by the time it's over the viewer is almost as shaken as George's character. 
Given the brutal lead-up, Peckinpah hardly lets the audience off easy 
when it comes to Straw Dogs's willfully barbaric conclusion. Having kept 
the film brilliantly off-balance with his disorienting editing and the 
steady, audacious ratcheting of intensity, Peckinpah further strains and 
exploits the viewer's emotions by stacking the deck against the brutish 
antagonists. But the disturbing, bloody outcome hardly results in any 
real catharsis or satisfaction. Rather, it leaves you feeling even more 
stunned and unsure of what you've seen than ever before. The uncertain 
morality of Straw Dogs sparked a great deal of controversy, which 
ironically validates Peckinpah's instincts. We may not like what we see, 
but we're compelled to watch it anyway.  JKl

Monte Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop is probably the best film to come 
out of the post-Easy Rider (1969) craze in Hollywood for greenlighting 
hippie-era road movies that studio executives (and sadly most 
audiences) didn't understand.
Having made a pair of remarkable existentialist Westerns, Ride in the 
Whirlwind (1965) and The Shooting (1967), Hellman set out to strip 
away the longhaired glamor of Easy Rider (1969). Two-Lane Blacktop is 
a deliberately paced story about an absurd race between a pair of 
black-car cultists in a 1955 Chevrolet played by musicians (James Taylor, 
Dennis Wilson) and a fast-spieling, grinning neurotic in a yellow GTO 
(Hellman regular Warren Oates), with glum tagalong chick Laurie Bird 
passed between them and pink slips put up as the prize.
Whereas Easy Rider and Vanishing Point (1971) zoom down the 
highways toward apocalypse, Two-Lane Blacktop depicts a race with no 
end, the film burning up in the projector before any resolution has been 
reached. A depiction of a country in a profound state of bad faith, the 
film has a lot of on-the-road detail, with sharp little cameos from the 
likes of Harry Dean Stanton (as a gay hitchhiker), but presents a central 
set of relationships between uncommunicative folks who are as stuck in 
their cars and on their courses as toys on a boy's racing game.  KN
Released to critical acclaim but met with extreme caution by the public, 
Wake In Fright (released in Europe and the United States as Outback) was 
neglected and in fact believed lost, until it was painstakingly restored by 
Australia's National Film and Sound Archive. Screened in competition at 
Cannes in 1971, it returned as part of the Cannes Classics selection in 2009. 
Both brutal and awe-inspring, Wake in Fright is the story of John Grant 
(Gary Bond), a teacher who arrives in the rough outback mining town of 
Bundanyabba, only planning to stay overnight before catching the plane 
to Sydney. But his one night stretches to five and, accompanied by a 
motley crew of locals (among them Donald Pleasance's quietly sinister 
Doc), he plunges headlong toward his own destruction. When the 
alcohol-induced mist lifts, Grant is left a self-loathing man in a desolate 
wasteland, dirty, red-eyed, and looking down the barrel of a rifle. 
Based on the novel by Kenneth Cook and marketed under the tagline 
"Sweat, Dust, and Beer . . . There's Nothing Else Out Here Mate!," Wake In 
Fright is one of the key works in the New Australian Cinema movement. 
A glimpse into a tortured psyche that manages to be both stark, tough, 
and, at times, surprisingly tender, the film has been acknowledged as an 
influence on contemporary Australian directors, including John Hillcoat 
(The Proposition, 2005) and Justin Kurzal (Snowtown, 2010).  JWo

Like Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs (1971) and Wes Craven's Last House on 
the Left (1972), John Boorman's Deliverance deals with complacent, 
middle-class folk faced with unreasoning, disturbingly sexualized 
violence in the wilds away from civilization, only to discover in themselves 
that they are "natural-born killers." Ironically, while the American 
Peckinpah, who had considered making Deliverance, was in Britain 
filming Straw Dogs, British director Boorman was in Georgia, using the 
Chattooga River to sub for poet-novelist James Dickey's fictional 
Cahulawassee River, shooting his own journey into the heart of darkness.
The film opens with four suburban types—quiet Ed (Jon Voight), 
survivalist Lewis (Burt Reynolds), bluff Bobby (Ned Beatty), and sensitive 
Drew (Ronny Cox)—traveling into woodland about to be destroyed by a 
dam that will create a new lake, opting to take a canoe trip downriver rather 
than play golf. When Ed and Bobby are waylaid by a pair of frightening, 
irrational hillbillies, Bobby is stripped, made to "squeal like a pig," and 
raped while Ed is tethered to a tree with his own belt, absurdly hanging 
on to his pipe through the ordeal. Archer Lewis intervenes, killing the 
rapist (Bill McKinney), and the quartet, with deeply mixed feelings, opts 
to cover up the incident and get out of the region, pitted against the 
surviving hillbilly rifleman (Herbert Coward) and the hostile landscape.
Most other directors would have made a standard he-man adventure 
movie, but Boorman, working from Dickey's screenplay, goes for a more 
disturbing approach, always questioning what the characters' heroism 
really means. The film eventually concludes that Voight's sad-eyed Ed, 
finding in himself the bestiality to survive, has lost rather than won. 
Reynolds, given a chance to rethink his "good ol' boy" screen persona, gives 
as generously self-critical a performance as John Wayne's in The Searchers 
(1956). Among the highlights: the unforgettable "feudin' banjos" scene 
as Drew plays a duet with a withered, porch-sitting manchild who turns 
out to be an amazing musician, and an oft-imitated last-minute horror 
twist (as in Carrie [1976]), as Ed's sleep is troubled by dreams of a hand 
emerging from the waters of the new lake.  KN

Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes  Werner Herzog, 1972
Aguirre, The Wrath of God
Werner Herzog had a remarkable run of important films in the radical 
German New Cinema. But his epic adventures featuring his maniacal 
tormentor and impulsive, inspired interpreter, Klaus Kinski, are the best 
known. And Aguirre, the Wrath of God—the first of Herzog's features widely 
seen internationally—is the most spellbinding. Supposedly narrated from 
the diary of the Spanish monk Gaspar de Carvajal, the film is a disturbing 
parable that encapsulates Herzog's flair for allegory, metaphor, dark 
humor, and the grotesque; his interest in alienation, obsession, and social 
decay; and his sense of the landscape taking on awful, human aspects.
Don Lope de Aguirre (Kinski) is one of Pizarro's pillaging conquistadors 
cutting a swathe across sixteenth-century South America. Having 
overwhelmed the Incas, Pizarro's soldiers are greedy for conquest and 
gold, but the expedition reaches an impasse in difficult terrain. What is 
supposed to be a one-week foraging and scouting trip by a party sent 
up the Amazon basin by raft quickly begins to suffer disasters. Soldiers 
and slaves are picked off by Indians, disease, and hunger; Aguirre leads 
a revolt against his commander; and the desperate journey degenerates 
into a homicidal power trip driven on by Aguirre's increasingly demented 
obsession with reaching the fabled city of gold, El Dorado.
Shooting on remote locations in Peru on a tiny budget was sufficiently 
problematic and arduous, but Herzog's account (particularly vivid in his 
documentary My Best Fiend [1999]) of a frequently raving Kinski adds 
appalling and entertaining background to the film. Toward the end of 
filming, Herzog prevented Kinski from walking out by threatening to shoot 
him. Clearly the real-life struggles enhanced the film's heated intensity, 
its tragic inevitability signaled by the murdered commander's graceful 
wife, dressed in her (improbably clean) best, determinedly walking away 
into the jungle. By the end, a mad Aguirre rules a floating bier strewn 
with corpses and swarming with squealing monkeys. Kinski's fascinating 
presence may dominate the film, but it is Herzog's uncompromising 
vision and control that keeps it on its hallucinatory, hypnotic course.  AE

Cabaret  Bob Fosse, 1972
What was just the second film of director, dancer, choreographer, and 
Broadway giant Bob Fosse took home eight Academy Awards, including 
Best Director over Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather. Cabaret was 
the only truly great musical made in the 1970s, despite prophecies that 
it would be Fosse's Springtime For Hitler ("Who wants to see a musical 
with Nazis?"). 
The answer was anybody who cares to be dazzled. Fosse was a cynic, 
brought up in vaudeville, who came of age in burlesque and sleazy 
nightclubs. No one else could have taken the John Kander-Fred Ebb 
musical (based on John Van Druten's play I Am a Camera, itself based on 
Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories) and cast such a cold, glittering 
eye on its sinful, soulless denizens of 1930s Berlin. The film's sharp, shiny 
musical numbers and incisive cuts between the cabaret and the world 
outside chillingly counterpoint the doom-laden tale of misconceived 
love and ambition amid the rise of Nazism, while Joel Grey's sinister club 
emcee is brilliant. But ultimately the film belongs to Liza Minnelli, who 
brought desperate-to-please nervous energy to sad, wild-eyed Sally 
Bowles with her feverish vitality and feigned depravity, giving warmth 
and frailty to a masterpiece of menace and show-stopping tunes.  AE

Solyaris  Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972
Solaris
Adapted from the best seller by Stanislaw Lem, Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris 
meditates on an imaginary planet and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space 
Odyssey (1968). A sci-fi masterpiece, the film is equally an epic performed 
without a budget. Instead of offering innovative special effects or mind-
blowing spectacle, it's confined to the experience of a character through 
whom fantasy and everyday life merge into one.
When psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is asked to evaluate 
the usefulness of a space station orbiting Solaris, he is confronted with 
the unsettling story of astronaut Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). Some 
years earlier, when there was hope to unravel the secrets of the new 
world's swirling oceans of consciousness, all turned for the worse when 
Berton became the lone survivor of a mishap that killed several explorers. 
Intrigued, Kris visits the space station and meets Dr. Snauth (Jüri Järvet), 
Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn), and the suicide case Dr. Gibaryan (Sos 
Sarkisyan). They advise him to take his time and adjust. Meanwhile 
strange sights and sounds assault him, including the appearance of his 
long-dead wife Khari (Natalya Bondarchuk). Thus he begins realizing the 
ability of Solaris to recreate the memories of visitors.
In fear of Khari's seeming reality, Kris destroys, or aids the destruction 
of, several different Kharis, only to discover other truths about Solaris. 
Namely, that its illusions are materially real, emotionally as needy as he 
is, and that he's the first person to form a lasting relationship with the 
planet's sentience. Finally unable to perform his duty, Kris joins with Khari 
and all she represents. Snauth and Sartorius recognize his fall and accept 
the burden of ending Solaris, although the film's final image is of the 
planet fashioning itself into Kris's imagined redemption.
Through Kris's journey from indifferent outsider to being literally the 
center of a world created just for him, we see the unmaking of a rational 
mind by sheer desire. As such, Tarkovsky's film uses the widescreen frame 
and lengthy takes to organize truly beautiful imagery. In this fashion, 
Solaris externalizes interior states to embody the mood of its protagonist.
Banionis's Kris Kelvin is a sad, middle-aged man. His shock of white 
hair on an otherwise brunette scalp suggests tragic experience and 
orients his first attempts to categorize Solaris before submitting to its 
dream logic. The irresolvable conflict of the planet—both soothing and 
all consuming—is then perfectly expressed in various sequences shot 
in circular patterns. While a stationary camera spins slowly on a central 
pivot, the actors and sets change to reveal new layers of possibility from 
what existed only moments before.
A mind game in the same way 2001 was a head film, Solaris was 
produced in the heart of Soviet pogroms against free expression, and 
certainly without benefit of a large budget. Tarkovsky's film is a 
touchstone of the cinematic impetus to unravel what it is to be alive.  GC-Q

One of Ingmar Bergman's most exquisitely executed achievements, Cries 
and Whispers begins with early-morning shots of a country estate, Sven 
Nykvist's camerawork capturing the play of sunlight through trees and 
mist to ravishing effect. By the time we have entered the house itself, 
where antique clocks tick inexorably on as a woman is awakened from 
her slumbers by the agony of the cancer consuming her from within, it's 
clear we are witnessing a filmmaker at the peak of his artistry, so assured 
are the measured rhythms of his editing, the placement of the camera, 
and the telling use of sound and color. Indeed, it is perhaps color that 
sticks most vividly in the mind after viewing this autumnal masterpiece: 
the rich red so unnaturally predominant both in the furnishings and on 
the walls of most of the mansion's rooms, in sharp contrast to the graceful 
white gowns favored by the four women whose lives we glimpse therein.
Bergman explained that he'd imagined the human soul to be this 
shade of red; certainly, its brooding presence intensifies his study of 
death and its influence on the living. The four women are the mansion's 
dying owner (Harriet Andersson), her devoted maid (Kari Sylwan), and 
the two sisters (Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann) who have come to tend 
to her during her final days. The former is emotionally and physically 
reticent thanks in part to a loveless marriage, the latter is superficially 
warmer but given to flightiness and insecurity. As the sisters and maid try 
first to comfort the sick woman and then to come to terms with her death, 
Bergman provides a glimpse into the inner life of each, tracing their fears, 
frustrations, anxieties, and regrets by means of memories and, at least 
for the maid, nightmarish fantasy. Such is his dramatic expertise that he 
blends the stuff of horror movies—vampirish kisses, the nightmarish 
prospect of a corpse returning to life—with chamber drama evocative of 
Chekhov or Strindberg, and makes it not only coherent and compelling 
but recognizable as part of his own artistic universe. Bergman is helped 
in this, of course, by extraordinary performances by actresses he'd worked 
with for many years, but then what a gift to them was his screenplay!  GA

The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie  Luis Buñuel, 1972
543
1972
The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Luis Buñuel's comic masterpiece, 
about three well-to-do couples who try, but fail, to sit down and have a 
meal together, is perhaps the most perfectly achieved and executed of 
all his late French films. The film proceeds with diverse interruptions, 
digressions, and interpolations that identify the characters, their class, 
and their seeming indestructibility with the very processes of narrative 
illusion and narrative continuity. 
One thing that makes The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie as 
charming as it is, despite its radicalism, and helped Buñuel to win his 
only Oscar, is the perfect cast, many of whom bring along nearly mythic 
associations acquired in previous films. Thus Delphine Seyrig makes us 
think of Last Year at Marienbad (1961), Stéphane Audran summons up 
the high bourgeoisie of Claude Chabrol's middle period, Bulle Ogier's 
neurotic is like a light-comic version of the mad character she played in 
L'amour fou (1969), and even Rey unmistakably calls to mind The French 
Connection (1971) when he brandishes some cocaine. 
Shortly after this film was nominated for an Oscar, Buñuel was 
interviewed by reporters in a Mexican restaurant, and when they asked 
if he expected to win, his reply was immediate: "Of course. I've already 
paid the $25,000 they wanted. Americans may have their weaknesses, 
but they do keep their promises."  JRos

The youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), returns from World War II 
outside the family business, organized crime. When his father, Don Corleone 
(Marlon Brando), is gunned down, however, Michael is driven to commit 
a revenge murder, bound by blood and "honor" to a violent course (or 
curse) of underworld power and survival. Eventually Michael inherits the 
role as family head, closing the door on his uncomprehending WASP wife 
(Diane Keaton) as he receives the homage as the new "Godfather."
The dialogue and characters of The Godfather instantly entered the 
collective consciousness of filmgoers. It made stars of Pacino and James 
Caan (hot-headed elder brother Sonny) and won Oscars for Best Picture, 
Screenplay, and Best Actor for Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Adapting 
Mario Puzo's best seller, writer-director Francis Ford Coppola made a pulp 
fiction gangster opera, an epic of patriarchy, family, and of America itself. 
Original protests by Italian-Americans citing defamation were swept 
away in the film's staggering popularity. All descendants of immigrants 
viewed with nostalgic yearning the Corleone clan pounding the pasta, 
celebrating and sorrowing together. Anecdotes, footnotes, and postscripts 
are part of film folklore: Brando did not stuff his cheeks with cotton, but 
had resin blobs clipped to his back teeth; he sent a fake Indian "Satcheen 
Littlefeather" to the Academy Awards ceremony to reject his Oscar. 
Coppola laid much of the groundwork of 1970s cinema with his 
commanding technique. The audacious, visceral, and stately set pieces 
are legend—the horse's head in the bed, Sonny's slaughter, the 
intercutting of a sunny wedding party in the garden with Don Corleone's 
court indoors, and the dazzling finale of assassinations carried out during 
the christening of a new Corleone (in effect the sacramental rites for 
Michael as he assumes the role of Godfather). The film's finest qualities 
reveal Coppola's fluency in classics, pulp, noir, and social dramas, but an 
enduring criticism of The Godfather is that it glorifies the Mafia. Pacino's 
Michael is the film's hero, and Michael is not a good guy. But its mythic 
exploration of familial ties, be it one cursed in blood and ambition, still 
entices viewers with the idea that Family is better than no family at all.  AE

Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris started a trend in art-house 
erotica that has endured to this day—films including Intimacy (2001) 
continue its premise of a "no questions asked" sexual affair that gives way 
to difficult familiarity; while writer-director Catherine Breillat (Romance 
[1999]), who appears in it, updates its themes of Eros and Thanatos.
Would Last Tango in Paris have mattered without Brando? His 
remarkable performance alludes to many previous, iconic roles. His 
obscene, scatological monologues, replete with Bertolucci's allusions to 
theories of Reich and Bataille, still have the power to startle. And the 
emotions of this middle-aged, despairing man are palpable.
A casting coup set the relatively inexperienced Maria Schneider 
against Brando. Her scenes with Jean-Pierre Léaud are deliberately 
superficial, contrasting with the central, primal, relationship and its 
stripping away of illusions. Yet Last Tango in Paris is more than the sum 
of its big ideas. Bertolucci's hyper-baroque style takes us into a 
subterranean, fractured, psychic space. Partitions, mirror reflections, 
incongruous props, and off-center framings multiply, disorienting the 
viewer at every turn, perfectly accompanied by Gato Barbieri's surging 
saxophone waltzes. A film of obstinate bloodstains and empty walls, 
inarticulate cries and bodily convulsions, Last Tango in Paris vigorously 
enacts its descent into the "womb of death."  AM

For many prominent gay artists, George Cukor's The Women (1939) has 
proved an irresistible model for cinematic storytelling in a queer mode: 
a group of women stuck together in a house, their destinies nominally 
defined and dominated by off-screen males, but lived through the 
melodramatic intensity of same-sex exchanges.
The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant—cheekily subtitled "a case 
history"—is Rainer Werner Fassbinder's lesbian variation on this model. 
Preserving and indeed exaggerating the claustrophobic theatricality 
of his play, Fassbinder offers a parade of chic women who visit Petra 
(Margit Carstensen), a fashion designer, and her mute and ever-obedient 
servant Marlene (Irm Hermann). Psychological domination and expert 
game playing are Petra's forte (she gives good phone) and, in her lair, 
transactions are a dance in and around her bed—while the seethingly 
jealous Marlene types and sketches forever in the background.
The possibilities that arise for camp humor are many, such as the 
ironically contrapuntal use of old pop hits, but Fassbinder keeps it 
cool. His film builds to a simple but valuable life lesson for those 
embroiled in emotionally sadomasochistic relations, which for 
Fassbinder means everyone: "The weaker" in any situation has one 
ultimate, devastating weapon—the power to walk away.  AM

Fat City  John Huston, 1972
John Huston's most effective "small film," Fat City tells the story of an 
over-the-hill boxer (Stacy Keach) who, conforming to Hollywood 
stereotypes, launches a comeback that inevitably fails, even as his gritty 
determination in defeat offers him a kind of transcendence. Like most 
Hustonian heroes, Tully (Keach) has missed his main chance, but is 
tendered yet another opportunity by chance to reclaim his self-respect. 
He connects with a younger boxer named Ernie (Jeff Bridges), becoming 
his mentor and rival as the pair seek to "make it big." Ernie may be 
talented enough to make a success of boxing, but he too becomes 
trapped by circumstances, forced to marry his girlfriend and enter a 
life of unending responsibility. Paradoxically, perhaps, Tully's romantic 
interest, the psychotic and self-destructive Oma (Susan Tyrrell), abandons 
him for a former lover, a man who abuses and mistreats her.
At the end of the film, Tully is not so much "free" to live the life of 
masculine accomplishment, as he is confirmed in his isolation and failure. 
There is, Huston suggests, no easy path to the "fat city" that is the American 
dream. With its authentic boxing sequences, drab California locations, 
and fine, understated acting from a talented ensemble, Fat City offers a 
realistic, yet poetic portrait of the all-too-human obsession to realize 
unrealizable dreams of self-transformation and transcendence.  RBP

The Heartbreak Kid  Elaine May, 1972
Elaine May is the most underrated director in American cinema. The 
Heartbreak Kid is the closest she has yet come to mainstream success, 
but it stays true to her corrosive, uncompromising vision. While remaining 
essentially faithful to Neil Simon's script (with its echoes of the 1967 film 
The Graduate), May manages to slaughter the sentimental, feel-good aura 
of that writer's baleful contribution to popular movies, by emphasizing 
the unpalatable facts of cruelty, humiliation, and embarrassment.
"Black comedy" here wears a mundane face. Lenny (Charles Grodin 
in his best role), a gormless salesman, is on his honeymoon with the 
nightmarish but good-hearted Lila (Jeannie Berlin—has ever a mother 
directed her daughter in such a brave, extreme part?). Feeling trapped 
and suffocated, Lenny's rather shallow fantasies turn to the all-American 
ideal, perky Kelly (Cybill Shepherd). Every consequence of this triangle 
is a disaster.
Few films plunge us so mercilessly into the tawdriness of romantic 
and sexual dreaming. May's focus on this material is pure John 
Cassavetes: an unflinching documentation of discomfort; real pain played 
out in real time. Our laughter—so brilliantly elicited by May's fractured 
mise-en-scène—turns hysterical in the psychoanalytic sense, a way of 
momentarily fleeing horror.  AM

Alfred Hitchcock returned to Britain in 1972 to collaborate with Anthony 
Shaffer on a film version of Arthur La Bern's novel Goodbye Piccadilly, 
Farewell Leicester Square, which resurrects many of the conventions of 
the director's first hit, The Lodger (1926). Here again, London is plagued by 
a Jack the Ripper-like serial murderer, and the leading man does himself 
no favors by acting so suspiciously that he becomes the prime suspect.
Hitchcock evokes a precise mix of prurient fascination and genuine 
horror in the English attitude to murder that is also a great part of his 
own obsession. Embittered ex-RAF officer Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) is 
an alcoholic working as a bartender in a Covent Garden pub, reduced to 
sponging off his sensible ex-wife Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), who in 
an ironic stroke runs a successful matchmaking agency. In one of the 
creepiest, most explicit scenes the Master of Suspense ever directed, 
Brenda is visited by cheery cockney fruit-market trader Bob Rusk (Barry 
Foster), whose unstated but perverse special requirements she doesn't 
want to fulfill professionally; Rusk then reveals himself as the notorious 
Necktie Murderer by raping Brenda and strangling her with his paisley tie.
Frenzy proceeds by cutting between the antisocial, degraded hero 
and the charming, successful villain, who further inconveniences Blaney 
by murdering his sometime-girlfriend (Anna Massey), a chirrupy barmaid. 
As in Psycho (1960) and Strangers on a Train (1951), Hitchcock manages a 
suspense sequence by enlisting our sympathies in a murderer's attempt 
to cover up his crime, showing Rusk fumbling about with a nude corpse 
in a potato sack in the back of a van to get back his incriminating tie clip. 
Hitchcock takes advantage of the period's more relaxed censorship 
regulations to be more explicit with the sex and violence, though he also 
knows when a long, slow pull-back away from a murder will convey 
more horror than another close-up of plunder and strangulation. There 
is a streak of Mike Leigh-style comedy of social embarrassment in the 
subplot of a police inspector (Alec McCowen) whose wife (Vivien 
Merchant) keeps confronting him with hideous gourmet meals.  KN

Quite possibly the best worst movie ever made—certainly one of the most 
notorious and beloved (if that's the right word) pieces of trash cinema 
to come out of the American underground—John Waters's 1972 feature 
offers a virtual manual on the aesthetics of "pure" gross-out moviemaking.
Shot around Waters's beloved hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, Pink 
Flamingos traces the victory of the writer-director's transvestite diva 
Divine, who lives in a trailer with her equally eccentric family—including 
her retarded hippie son, Crackers (Danny Mills), and her obese, egg-
obsessed, playpen-residing mama, Edie (Edith Massey, truly 
unforgettable). The battle is to outdo the twisted and antisocial Marbles 
(Waters regulars Mink Stole and David Lochary) in disgusting and immoral 
behavior to become nothing less, or more, than "The Filthiest People 
Alive."  Whereas the Marbles pose a strong challenge by abducting and 
impregnating female hitchhikers, selling their babies to lesbian couples, 
and using the money to finance schoolyard heroin schemes, Divine's Babs 
Johnson is not to be denied in her mission to maintain her family's throne.
The gritty, home-movie feel of Pink Flamingos (with its occasionally 
off-centered and out-of-focus cinematography, seemingly random 
zooms and cutaways, and uneven sound quality) only adds to the trash- 
and cult-movie watching experience. After all, we're dealing here with a 
film that gives extended screen time to butthole lip-synching, bowel 
movements delivered by post, and sex with chickens. In the notorious 
epilogue, Divine stops on a street in downtown Baltimore to pick up the 
freshly laid turd of a small dog. She puts it in her mouth, chews for a 
moment, then gags a bit and gives what can only be called a shit-eating 
grin to the camera. Critic Justin Frank hardly exaggerates when he 
identifies this scene as "the most famous . . . in all underground cinema—
the underground equivalent of the shower scene in Psycho." Although 
Waters would go on to make several other memorable exercises in bad 
taste, including Female Trouble (1974) and Desperate Living (1977), none 
of his movies so perfectly combine humor and vulgarity as this one.  SJS

Sleuth  Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1972
Given Joseph L. Mankiewicz's reputation as the most conversational of 
filmmakers, a man who always prized high-quality talk over visual flash, 
he was a perfect choice to direct the film version of Anthony Shaffer's 
long-running Broadway and West End stage hit Sleuth. Though a few 
scenes "open out" the setting by venturing into the garden of mystery 
writer Andrew Wyke's prop-filled stately home, the piece remains 
essentially confined to the drawing room as two actors from different 
generations clash in style, temperament, and method.
Sir Laurence Olivier, reclaiming the status of movie star after more 
"serious" theater work, plays the role of Wyke, a mischievous sadist 
with a childish delight in nasty trickery ("that's a puzzle jug") and an 
addiction to complex games (an all-white jigsaw). Michael Caine is Milo 
Tindle, hairdresser and lover of Wyke's neglected wife. At first apparently 
outclassed in every way by his opponent, Tindle reveals a surprising 
emotional range in the first act climax. He pulls a coup de théâtre in 
the second act that really works even if you see it coming—invited over 
to be ensnared in a plot that has many twists and turns before it ends 
unhappily but justly for all concerned.  KN

Superfly  Gordon Parks Jr., 1972
One of the most beloved and oft-quoted films of the blaxploitation cycle, 
boasting a sizzling funk soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield, a macho, drug-
dealing antihero, and pimpin' 1970s streetware, Superfly is simply 
unforgettable. Directed by Gordon Parks Jr., the hard-boiled action/crime 
drama was financed by a group of independent African-American 
businessmen (making it the first to achieve this honor), with a crew 
that was nearly all black as well. Superfly tells the saga of a hip Harlem 
drug pusher, Youngblood Priest (Ron O'Neal), who hopes to make one 
last deal, converting all his coke to cash before starting a new, crime-free 
life for himself. It makes a strong statement about the continuous supply 
of drugs to the ghetto begetting pain, suffering, and an endless cycle of 
violence. It also makes Priest the richest, and most admired dude in the 
'hood, glamorizing the era's "machismo-cocaine consciousness," and 
rendering black political consciousness inconsequential and ineffectual. 
It's damn near impossible to criticize Superfly for its lack of a coherent, 
politically correct message. The dialogue is so crisp, the still-frame montage 
to the tune of "Pusherman" so unselfconsciously affecting, O'Neal's character 
so quietly charismatic, that audiences can hardly help feeling the rush 
that comes from watching the film unfold. Or as one review puts it, Superfly 
perfectly captures "the essence of that which is the life of a Playa."  SJS
George Roy Hill first directed Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). The results were far-reaching 
inasmuch as the film affirmed viewers' interest in Westerns while 
demonstrating the commercial attraction of Newman and Redford. 
Assembled again four years later in the caper pic The Sting, Hill gave the 
actors more room to play, though this time without any tragic resonance.
Set in post-Depression Chicago, Henry Gondorff (Newman) and 
Johnny Hooker (Redford) are two con men with ambition. After mobster 
Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) kills one of their friends, they set out 
for revenge. The subsequent effort, built on smoke, mirrors, and a 
number of situational reversals, also depends on a dense network within 
Chicago's criminal underworld.
Sparkling wit abounds as a strong supporting cast of smart men 
pitch personal style to other smart men. The timelessness of Scott 
Joplin's rags ring throughout the soundtrack and, in the end, the long 
con defeats the most intimidating bad guy.
Perhaps not high art, The Sting is nonetheless a luscious meringue. 
Blue-eyed Newman and dusty-haired Redford look great, and into their 
friendship is entrenched the joy of screen masters jousting in a comic 
adventure centered on loyalty and deception.  GC-Q

In this autobiographical feature, Jean Eustache spends 220 minutes 
depicting an intense ménage à trois: Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud) lives 
with Marie (Bernadette Lafont) but falls in love with Veronika (Françoise 
Lebrun). Shot in 16mm and black and white, The Mother and the Whore 
deploys the aesthetics of the New Wave to offer a trenchant portrait of 
post-May '68 disillusionment. The mobile camera work (by the 
distinguished Pierre Lhomme) charts a seductive Parisian cityscape: old 
apartments, boulevards, and cafés in which the characters conduct a 
dizzying flow of conversation. While Eustache's extraordinary dialogues 
merge high literature, slang, and obscenities, Lhomme's camera stretches 
duration in extreme long takes and real-time scenes.
Like many New Wave films, The Mother and the Whore inhabits a 
Parisian intellectual world in which real-life film critics and filmmakers 
appear as secondary characters, including Eustache himself. But most 
evocative of the New Wave, apart from Lafont, is Léaud, François Truffaut's 
alter ego. The boy wonder of The 400 Blows (1959) and whimsical young 
man of Stolen Kisses (1969) has grown into the manic, obsessive, 
exasperating, yet spellbinding Alexandre. As he discusses the meaning of 
life, love, and art, Léaud/Alexandre merges the anomic New Wave male 
with the May '68 libertarian; The Mother and the Whore is at once narcissistic 
portrayal and scathing exposé of this figure, and thus deeply of its time.
What of the "mother" and the "whore" of the title? Like Alexandre, the 
film wavers between them and swaps the two female stereotypes in 
the process. Both women, who have jobs while he is idle, emerge as 
stronger than the immature Alexandre. Yet the film turns them into 
"tragic" but ultimately marginal figures, subservient to his (and the 
director's) existential angst, despite stunning performances by Lafont 
and newcomer Lebrun. In this respect too, The Mother and the Whore is of 
its time, a monument to the confused, "liberated," and yet still oppressively 
patriarchal sexual politics of 1970s France. Eustache (who committed 
suicide in 1981) had enough talent to make it also deeply moving.  GV

Clint Eastwood's second film as director-star (after Play Misty for Me 
[1971]) relocates his spaghetti Western persona into an American gothic 
morality tale. An unshaven saddle tramp rides out of a desert haze into 
Lago, where the townsfolk once stood by as a marshal was whipped to 
death. In a surreal rerun of High Noon (1952), Eastwood—who might be 
the murdered man's ghost, or more prosaically his brother—is begged 
to stand up to three outlaws just released from territorial prison and on 
their way home for violent revenge.
The mystery man demonstrates his powers not only by meting out 
the kind of gunplay and abuse expected of a grungy cowboy antihero 
circa 1972, but also by forcing everyone to take part in a bizarre fiesta. 
The latter involves making a dwarf into the combined Sheriff and 
Mayor, literally painting the town red, and renaming it "Hell." Recalling 
the Vietnam slogan "We destroyed the village in order to save it," the 
stranger finally burns down the town. With at least as much borrowed 
from Luis Buñuel as Sergio Leone, this is a funny, brutal, scary movie, 
daringly weird in its mixture of Western and horror themes, and shot 
through with acid self-analysis.  KN

Badlands  Terrence Malick, 1973
"I can't deny we've had fun . . . and that's more than some can say." Harvard 
graduate, Rhodes scholar, sometime journalist and philosophy teacher at 
MIT, Terrence Malick is a true artist, utterly indifferent to the conventions 
and commercialism of the American film industry. He wrote, produced, 
and directed only two films in the 1970s before withdrawing from the fray 
for a reclusive twenty years (when he returned to make his long-mooted 
World War II project The Thin Red Line [1998]), becoming both a revered 
legend and a terrible loss to American cinema in the process. Days Of 
Heaven (1979) derives its power from its exquisite beauty and evocation 
of mood. But it is Badlands, a disturbing, fatalistic study of a mindlessly 
violent odyssey, that is the more arresting and influential cult favorite. Far 
from dating, the film has a timeless quality and has become increasingly 
relevant in an age with little innocence but a mass hankering for celebrity.
In the roles of Kit and Holly, Badlands' two about-to-be stars are 
extraordinary. In his early thirties but looking much younger, wild, and 
edgy, Martin Sheen is explosive as the aimless and alienated Midwestern 
misfit eager for notoriety, a garbage man who fancies himself a James 
Dean look-alike outlaw. Sissy Spacek, twenty-four but utterly believable 
as a fifteen-year-old, is unnerving as his blank, freckle-faced, passive 
nymphet moll. Inspired by the real, shocking 1950s case of the delinquent 
teenaged Bonnie and Clyde, Charles Starkweather and Carol Fugate, there 
is a horrible fascination in this narrative of a bad boy and his baton-twirling 
baby doll. The casual disposing of the girl's dour father (Warren Oates), the 
building of a tree house love-nest refuge in a cotton grove, and a cross-
country killing spree and chase are all reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde.
Badlands is cool, bleak, and scary in its awareness that the seemingly 
ordinary adolescent girl has thrown in her lot compliantly with a 
sociopath because she doesn't have any other ideas. It is also singularly 
literate, with Malick finding a dispassionate, humorless distance from 
the violent psychodrama through clever writing. A brilliant device has 
Spacek gauchely reading her character's romanticized but banal diary 
entries—in the style of the trashy 1950s movie fan magazines she 
reads—for a voice-over that adds odd pathos to the duo's nihilistic 
progress. The details, using the iconography of the era, are both 
disarming (the couple, heedless of their situation, dancing outdoors like 
any carefree kids to Mickey and Sylvia's "Love Is Strange" or dreamily in 
the beam of their headlights to Nat King Cole) and eloquent (Kit checking 
his hair in the mirror during a car chase when the police are all but on 
top of him, or cheerfully tossing souvenirs to his captors). The contrasts—
of the American heartland landscapes with their run-down dwellings, 
tedious lives, and tawdry dreams; of the bright, vibrant musical score 
with recurring images of death—are continually striking. And the echoes 
of Malick's majestically brooding, moody style continue to reverberate 
in the love-on-the-run genre to this day.  AE

Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and directed by his protégé and 
former assistant George Lucas, who also cowrote the autobiographically 
flavored screenplay, this hugely entertaining, perceptive coming-of-age 
ensemble piece of high school graduates cruising through one eventful 
summer's night in 1962 was inspired by 1950s teen pics but set the 
style—often imitated, never surpassed in hilarity, penetration, or technical 
virtuosity—for a hundred and one rites of passage comedies played out 
in classic cars to a vintage rocking soundtrack. It was also the clear 
inspiration for such wholesome, nostalgic television sitcoms as Happy Days 
and Laverne and Shirley, featuring some of the same players and fancifully 
revisiting that supposedly more carefree youth era before Vietnam.
Marvel at that Graffiti ensemble: Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard 
when he was still Ronny as the college-bound boys, Paul "whatever 
happened to?" LeMat as the Brylcreemed bad boy, Cindy Williams, Candy 
Clark, Charles Martin Smith, legendary rock-'n'-roll disc jockey Wolfman 
Jack, and, in humbler roles, Joe Spano, Suzanne Somers, Kathy before 
she became Kathleen Quinlan, and a not-so-very-young hopeful named 
Harrison Ford as drag racer Bob Falfa. The confluence of young talents 
brought energy, comedy, insight, and craft, superbly captured by 
cinematographer Haskell Wexler, one of Lucas's early mentors. American 
Graffiti was shot on location in Modesto and San Rafael, California—
where the time-honored tradition of "dragging the main" was long a 
strictly observed ritual of mooning, foam spraying, flirtatious pursuit, 
and furtively obtained liquor in paper bags, and where Lucas was to build 
the center of his filmmaking empire, the Skywalker Ranch complex.
In what was only his second feature, Lucas demonstrated a charm 
and warmth not found in his cool, futuristic debut, the Orwellian THX 
1138 (1971). Shot in just twenty-eight nights for well under a million 
dollars, American Graffiti not only became a box-office smash, one of the 
most profitable pictures of all time, but it also received critical kudos and 
five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Director, 
a triumph that enabled Lucas to make an even more phenomenal mark 
with his next film, Star Wars (1977).  AE

Papillon  Franklin J. Schaffner, 1973
557
Tagged, "Two men with nothing in common but a will to live and a 
place to die," Franklin J. Schaffner's Papillon is a male love-story-
turned-adventure tale. It opens with Papillon (Steve McQueen) being 
sent to a French Guyana prison for a crime he didn't commit. There he 
meets Dega (Dustin Hoffman), another convict. Afterward the film 
concerns their respective misadventures trying to escape until 
Papillon finally succeeds.
Accompanying this eye candy, Jerry Goldsmith's score echoes off 
tropical backdrops to make Papillon less an action vehicle and more a 
confrontation between man and nature. McQueen is therefore the 
foil for exploring individual loyalty and pain—the long-suffering 
hero. Attentive viewers will be struck by how little dialogue is spoken. 
Instead, Papillon's impact comes from bits of actor's business and the 
sheer force of imprisonment. Perhaps the finest example is the lead's 
solitary confinement; although he speaks nary a word,  McQueen still 
comes across as a powerful screen presence and star.
Yet the point of the film shines through in a nightmare. "I accuse 
you of a wasted life," Papillon is told, but the movie becomes a counter-
argument because his triumph is that of an insignificant man defeating 
a system designed to break him.  GC-Q

The Long Goodbye, Robert Altman's languid, free-form version of 
Raymond Chandler's last great novel, relocates the 1953 story to 1973, 
subtly critiquing the out-of-time values of Philip Marlowe. Elliott Gould's 
slobby, unshaven, chain-smoking private eye is an all-time loser, 
introduced in a brilliant sequence that has him try to pass off inferior 
pet food on his supercilious cat. Shambling through the remains of 
Chandler's plot, Gould tries to help an alcoholic Hemingwayesque 
writer (Sterling Hayden, who wrote his own scenes) and clear his only 
friend (Jim Bouton) of a murder rap.
John Williams's brilliant score plays endless variations on a title 
tune, and many sequences are astonishing: violent gangster Jark 
Rydell making a point by smashing a coke bottle in his mistress's face 
("That's someone I love, you I don't even like"), Hayden's stumbling 
suicide on the beach, and an invigoratingly cynical punch line ("and I 
lost my cat") that turns Marlowe into some sort of winner after all. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less, has an unbilled cameo as a minor 
thug. Altman makes sure a lot of the vital action happens almost 
unnoticed in the corners of the frame and loves highlighting tiny 
moments of visual and aural impact in a sun-struck tapestry of Los 
Angeles sleaze.  KN

Enter the Dragon  Robert Clouse, 1973
Having established his action movie superstar credentials with rough-
hewn Hong Kong vehicles like Fist of Fury (1972) and The Big Boss (1971), 
former cha-cha champion and American TV sidekick Bruce Lee only had 
one shot at completing a movie with Hollywood production values. Lee, 
a martial artist whose physical skills have attained a spiritual level, 
infiltrates a master-baddie's island enclave (along with sidekicks John 
Saxon and Jim Kelly) and sees off hordes and hordes of junior villains 
(Jackie Chan gets a walk-on necksnap).
Director Robert Clouse has the style you'd expect of someone 
directing a Brock Landers adventure (lots of zooms and flares), and Lee, 
whose real-life Hong Kong English was heavily-accented but fluent 
and distinctive, is stuck with Charlie Chan dialogue consisting of 
enigmatically wise pronouncements. But the action still delivers nonstop 
astonishment as, without the aid of the wires or effects used in the 
likes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000), Lee goes magnificently 
through the motions, twirling his signature nunchaku, flexing his oiled 
torso. Influential on an entire genre of subsequent martial arts movies 
and a template for every beat-'em-up computer game, Enter the Dragon 
wins its place in film history purely on the strength of Lee's charismatic 
presence and literally inimitable fighting moves.  KN

The Wicker Man  Robin Hardy, 1973
Repressed Scots policeman Howie (Edward Woodward), "a Christian 
copper," investigates the disappearance of a little girl on Summerisle, 
where the charming but fiendish local laird (Christopher Lee) is taking 
extreme measures to ensure the success of the next harvest. Written by 
Anthony Shaffer (Sleuth [1972]), The Wicker Man is a highly original 
combination of horror movie, murder mystery, pagan ethnography, and 
folk musical that stood as an auspicious debut for its sadly unprolific 
director, Robin Hardy. It manages an audacious combination of the sexy 
and the sinister, leading to a shock ending that still has an impact, even 
though audiences coming fresh to the film tend now to know how 
things will turn out at the festival where a holy virgin fool is led to a giant 
man-shaped bonfire on the cliffs.
A bizarre cast includes a dubbed and body-doubled Britt Ekland as 
the landlord's seductive daughter, cult starlet Ingrid Pitt as the naked 
librarian, mime Lindsay Kemp as a slyly camp publican, and Diane 
Cilento as the headmistress-like high priestess. Although edited 
significantly for its original release, the version generally available now 
restores much (if not all) the trimmed footage—in some ways, the 
shorter cut plays a little better because the expanded version is at times 
heavy-handed in leading viewers to the final twist.  KN

Serpico  Sidney Lumet, 1973
Maverick cops rooting out departmental corruption is now a familiar 
theme in many of TV's law enforcement drama series. In 1973, however, 
this was exciting cinematic territory fully exploited by director Sidney 
Lumet in Serpico, featuring a sizzling performance by Al Pacino. Based 
on Peter Maas's 1972 biography, this is the gripping story of New York 
cop Frank Serpico. The real-life Serpico refused to take paybacks, a 
decision which made him massively unpopular in the many 
departments he was transferred to. Receiving personal threats from 
fellow officers, he was mysteriously shot in the face on duty—yet lived 
to testify at an important police-corruption hearing.
Fresh off his groundbreaking role in the 1972 film The Godfather, 
Pacino's Serpico is a high-energy but low-key performance that won 
him the Golden Globe and the second of his many Oscar nominations. 
Serpico staves off being a mere cop cliché film because of its balanced 
view of the main character—a man in the right who becomes an 
embittered martyr. The only jarring element is Mikis Theodorakis's 
heavy-handed Mediterranean-themed soundtrack. Judd Hirsch and 
F. Murray Abraham appear in cameos.  KK

1973
Based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look 
Now showcases the British director's characteristically nonlinear style of 
storytelling, in which temporal ellipses and frenetic crosscuts serve to 
reflect and enhance the already palpable atmosphere of psychological 
disturbance and dread.
Shortly after their young daughter dies in a drowning accident, art 
restorer John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) and his wife Laura (Julie Christie) 
travel to Venice in the off-season to work on an old church and recover 
from their traumatic loss. Instead what they find is a creepy city filled 
with lonely canals and eccentric characters, including a pair of strange 
old sisters (Hilary Mason and Clelia Matania), one of them a blind psychic 
who insists that she can communicate with their late child and who warns 
them of impending danger. John is initially skeptical but starts to come 
around after catching random glimpses of his daughter darting through 
the streets wearing the same red raincoat she had on when she died.
In the film's unforgettable conclusion, John races through the Venice 
alleys at night in pursuit of the mysterious red-garbed figure—who he 
now believes is the ghost of his deceased child—only to catch up with 
her in a dark passageway, her back toward him. The figure then turns 
around, revealing an ambiguously gendered dwarf, and John can only 
stand there stunned as the little person (who is quite real, and quite 
deadly, having been on a killing spree in the city for some time) walks 
up to him and slashes his throat with a straight razor. It is no exaggeration 
to say that few scenes in the history of cinema have proven as effective 
at sending chills up the spines of viewers as this one.
But Don't Look Now's terrifying finale is not even the best-known 
scene in the film. That honor goes to the lengthy sex scene between John 
and Laura, mixed with quiet shots of the married couple impassively 
dressing for dinner. Rumor spread that the remarkable passion on display 
during this lovemaking session resulted from an off-screen affair between 
Christie and Sutherland. Whatever the case, it is this same passion that 
suffuses the entire picture.  SJS

La nuit américaine  François Truffaut, 1973
Day for Night
In a typical scene of Day for Night, the director Ferrand (François Truffaut) 
throws down a pile of his latest film-book acquisitions (on Bresson, 
Rossellini, Hitchcock), while Georges Delerue's musical theme is piped 
through a tinny telephone speaker. The mixture of everyday detail with 
an unexpected, restrained surge of poetic lyricism is quintessential Truffaut.
Day for Night is Truffaut's valentine to the process of moviemaking. 
Controversially for the post-1968 period, he chose classical, studio-bound, 
generic cinema as his premise, not the New Wave. The emphasis of the film 
is on filmmaking as craft rather than art (no one pretends that Ferrand's 
middlebrow diversion Meet Pamela is a masterpiece). And, ultimately, it 
is less about the "product" than the collective process leading to it. Truffaut 
paints an affectionate portrait of good-natured "family" relations among 
cast and crew in place of the vicious power plays usually presented, 
making Day for Night the polar opposite to Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt 
(1963) or Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Beware of a Holy Whore (1970). 
Gentle, bittersweet wisdom is the keynote here, as a rich ensemble 
of performers (from smooth Jean-Pierre Aumont to firecracker Jean-Pierre 
Léaud) share fleeting lessons in life, love, and loss. The film deftly sketches 
a wide range of characters, cleverly compared on certain points: for 
example, their attitudes to casual sex (tragic and histrionic for Jacqueline 
Bisset's happily married character once Léaud makes their liaison public, 
flippant for Natalie Baye as a no-nonsense assistant director).
Truffaut stresses the transience, fragility, and unreality of life on a 
set—even allowing, in one hilarious scene, an outsider to finally explode 
and criticize these film people for their rampant immorality. Day for Night 
gently exposes the many illusions of the filmmaking process, but also 
maintains our awe over the magic of movies. Characteristically for 
Truffaut, the brisk montage scenes—devoted to the frenzy of the editing 
room, or an elaborate scene filmed in artificial snow—express a deep 
affection for, and appreciation of, the mundane practicalities of his trade. 
As such strangely exhilarating scenes serve to show, Truffaut's cinema 
is essentially unspectacular. There is no melodramatic underlining in Day 
for Night, no ostentatious, point-making rhetoric in his mise-en-scène. 
Truffaut's obsession is with maintaining a lightness of tone, maximizing 
narrative flow, and conveying incidents with the utmost economy: In 
this he truly married the tautness of Hitchcock or Lang with the 
observational grace of Renoir or Becker. 
Amid the whimsical succession of ordinary situations, the rare, strong 
moments of drama occur as sudden interruptions (such as Alexander's 
death) that switch the mood. The sadness of these "punctual" events 
enhances the keenness of the characters' fleeting pleasures: secret 
moments of intimacy or complicity, joyful epiphanies, chance eruptions 
of comedy, and stolen kisses.  AM

"Making a film is like 
a stagecoach ride in 
the old West. When you 
start, you are hoping for 
a pleasant trip. By the 
halfway point, you just 
hope to survive."

The movie's title refers to the practice 
of treating scenes shot by day to 
appear as if they were shot at night.

Mean Streets  Martin Scorsese, 1973
Scorsese's breakthrough movie was an instant declaration of the themes 
he's been elaborating ever since and of his showy talent. Set in his home 
turf of New York City's Little Italy, though shot mostly in Los Angeles with 
some spliced-in footage of the San Gennaro religious festival, Mean 
Streets is about hustlers in the midlevel of organized crime. It explores 
the exhilaration and destructiveness of extended adolescence and a 
peculiar search for redemption that continues throughout his filmography.
A young, smooth Harvey Keitel stars as Charlie Cappa, Scorsese's 
semiautobiographical stand-in (the director actually uses his own voice 
for the character's narration), a minor mob hanger-on who believes "you 
pay for your sins on the street not in church" but is still willing to hold his 
hand to a votive candle to atone for his crimes. So concerned with 
presenting an impressive face to the world that he fetishistically grooms 
himself like a knight donning armor, Charlie believes it is possible to have 
an old-fashioned sense of honor and loyalty and still prosper in a 
business run by gentlemanly elders. However, his cousin-girlfriend (Amy 
Robinson) undercuts his man-of-integrity attitudes by reminding him 
"St. Francis didn't run numbers."
Charlie spends his time palling around with his friends in Little Italy, 
exchanging Hope-and-Crosby wisecracks with his dangerously 
irresponsible cousin Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), going to the movies 
(cue cinephile clips from John Ford's The Searchers (1956) and Roger 
Corman's Tomb of Ligeia (1964), to show you where Marty is coming 
from), running minor scams, wondering which girl to settle with, and 
hoping to advance himself in the rackets. However, his sense of what he 
must be seen to be leads him to get out of a relationship with his 
epileptic cousin because he is worried that he'll be tainted as a flake, and 
then to duck out on a possible liaison with an obviously wonderful 
woman he has been flirting with just because she's black. Meanwhile, 
his loyalty to Johnny Boy is clearly dragging him toward disaster as the 
irresponsible rebel, who simply doesn't care what anyone thinks, ticks 
off a powerful local loan shark (Richard Romanus) by not only not paying 
him back but by making a point of being contemptuous of him in public.
The intense, interior, earnest, considered Charlie and the explosive, 
free-associating, impulsive smart-ass Johnny Boy (first seen bombing a 
mailbox) are key characters in 1970s cinema, establishing personae the 
stars would explore in a run of outstanding work for Scorsese and others. 
It ends in a bloody apotheosis, a shoot-out-cum-car-crash that leaves 
some of the characters bleeding and others dead (though it isn't entirely 
clear which is which). Along the way, there is a joyous energy as Keitel 
struts into neon-lit bars in his sharp suits, the camera prowling along 
with him, while Scorsese's unparalleled record collection plays on the 
soundtrack. David Carradine, star of Scorsese's earlier Boxcar Bertha 
(1972), has a funny cameo as a drunken murder victim.  KN

Esposito's rebel song in Allen's

i
Sleeper  Woody Allen, 1973
One of Woody Allen's self-described "early, funny films," this is a Bob 
Hope-style comedy vehicle for Allen's whiny neurotic Jewish character, 
set loose in a 1973 vision of the future informed by films like 2001: 
A Space Odyssey (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), THX 1138 (1971), 
and Z.P.G. (1972).
Miles Monroe (Allen), jazzman and proprietor of a Greenwich Village 
health food store, is defrosted 200 hundred years into the future after 
being cryofrozen in tinfoil when complications set in during a routine 
ulcer surgery. As in Bananas (1971) and Love and Death (1975), Allen's 
character is a foul-up who gets drawn into revolutionary activity that 
seems doomed to exchange one tyranny for another. There are some 
barbed philosophical bits about doomed romantic relationships, but the 
main focus of the picture is the comedy. It ranges from satiric jabs at 
contemporary mores seen from a skewed futurist perspective (it has 
been proved that fatty foods and cigarettes are better for you than 
health foods), through silent cinema-style slapstick (a giant banana 
naturally leads to a giant banana-skin gag), to left-field surrealism like a 
mental deprogramming session that kicks into a rerun of A Streetcar 
Named Desire (1951) with Diane Keaton and Allen doing Marlon Brando 
and Vivien Leigh.  KN

The Exorcist  William Friedkin, 1973
The first major blockbuster in horror movie history, this film has exerted 
a powerful influence on the development of the genre. Never before 
had a horror film been the subject of so much prerelease hype, so much 
gossip about postproduction strife, so much speculation as to why 
people of all ages would stand in line for hours to watch something 
reputed to induce fits of vomiting, fainting, even temporary psychosis. 
The cultural impact of The Exorcist can hardly be overestimated. The film 
stole U.S. newspaper headlines away from the ongoing Watergate 
scandal, at least for a while, led to a detectable increase in the number 
of "real-life" spiritual possessions reported, and, as one critic wrote, 
"established . . . disgust as mass entertainment for a large audience."
Inspired by newspaper reports of a thirteen-year-old Maryland boy 
whose body was said to have been taken over by demonic forces, novelist 
William Peter Blatty made the possessee a girl. He sensationalized many 
details, adding heavy doses of philosophical-theological speculation on 
the nature of evil, and came out with the The Exorcist in 1971. Correctly 
anticipating a best seller, Warner Brothers purchased the film rights and, 
after numerous rewrites of the original script, Blatty finally came up with a 
version of The Exorcist that managed to meet Friedkin's exacting demands.
Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is the adorable, almost-pubescent 
daughter of divorcee and well-known movie star Chris MacNeil (Ellen 
Burstyn). But when she prophesies the death of her mother's 
acquaintance and urinates in front of a roomful of dinner guests, Chris 
starts to wonder what has "gotten into" her daughter. More odd behavior, 
and a wildly shaking bed, lands Regan in the hospital, where she is 
subjected to a battery of extremely invasive procedures best described 
as medical pornography. A brain lesion is suspected, but the tests prove 
nothing. When Regan, supposedly under hypnosis, responds to the smug 
questions of a hospital shrink by grabbing his scrotum, it is recommended 
that Chris seek the Church's help. She does, pleading with doubt-ridden 
Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) to perform an exorcism. The 
film's second half culminates in an intense battle between Karras and 
Regan's demonic possessor, after the more experienced exorcist on the 
scene, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), dies in the struggle. Karras finally 
saves Regan by accepting the demon into his own body, only to throw 
himself, or let himself be thrown, out of a window to his death.
In an era of student protest, experimental drug use, and questioning 
of authority, The Exorcist allowed viewers to take pleasure in the terrible 
punishments inflicted on the rebellious Regan. But by making Regan-
the-demon so fascinating to watch, so filled with nasty surprises, 
The Exorcist also allowed viewers to take pleasure in that rebelliousness. 
The film not only gave rise to a slew of lesser-quality sequels, imitations, 
and variants on the possession theme, it also made the child with 
malevolent powers a dominant motif in horror cinema.  SJS

From the start Orson Welles's last completed feature film, F for Fake, teases 
us with questions. Is it a feature? A documentary? A film-essay? Maybe 
the best term would be a "jeu d'esprit." A loose-limbed meditation on 
trickery and fraud, on fakery, lies, magic, and illusion, it borrows footage 
shot by Welles's friend, French documentarist François Reichenbach, about 
Hungarian art forger Elmyr de Hory. We see Elmyr on Ibiza, chatting to 
Clifford Irving, who's writing a book about him entitled Fake! Subsequently, 
Irving himself proves to be no less a fraud when he publishes a supposed 
book-length interview with the reclusive Howard Hughes.
Interwoven with this are scenes of Welles wandering around Paris 
and Ibiza, ruminating on art as confidence trick, and footage of a 
beautiful young woman—Oja Kodar, Welles's companion for the last 
twenty years of his life—being ogled by every man she passes. 
F for Fake has been called "Welles's happiest film." Yet it's possible to 
detect in it that undertow of melancholy that tinges all his work.  At one 
point he muses on Chartres Cathedral, a towering masterpiece without 
a signature. "Maybe," he adds, "a man's name doesn't matter all that much." 
Early on, he promises us: "During the next hour, everything you'll hear 
from us is really true." As you might guess, there's a sting in that particular 
tale. Yet the ultimate message is one of affirmation. In the long run, says 
Welles, "Our songs will all be silenced. But what of it? Go on singing."  PK

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid  Sam Peckinpah, 1973
Truncated and neglected on its original release, Sam Peckinpah's final 
true Western has been restored to something like his original vision 
and can be hailed as one of the director's greatest films. It opens (in the 
restored version) with Pat Garrett (James Coburn, in the performance of 
his career) being shot dead and flashing back to the days when he 
gave up being an outlaw and pinned on a badge to hunt down his 
former friend Billy (Kris Kristofferson) because "this country's getting 
old, and I intend to get old with it." Along the way, Garrett loses every 
shred of integrity and Peckinpah shows us a West decaying in an almost 
gothic manner, as a succession of familiar genre faces crop up and 
mainly get bloodily shot.
On parade here are Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Richard 
Jaeckel, L.Q. Jones, Harry Dean Stanton, Chill Wills, Matt Clark, Elisha Cook 
Jr., Denver Pyle, and Barry Sullivan. It would be hard to find a great Western 
that didn't include one of these players; collectively they provide a roll call 
of the form's greatness, and each cameo adds to the elegiac, melancholy, 
and wistful tapestry of Western and genre history, shot through with 
dollops of blood and poetry, plus original music by Bob Dylan.  KN

Turkish Delight is Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's outrageous precursor 
to his cycle of big-budget Hollywood movies probing human sexuality, 
such as Basic Instinct (1992), Showgirls (1995), and Starship Troopers 
(1997). Often criticized for his use of extreme violence and sexual 
explicitness, Verhoeven has always maintained that his films mirror life 
rather than influence it. Turkish Delight stars Rutger Hauer as Eric Vonk, 
a promiscuous sculptor who gets involved with the beautiful Olga 
(Monique van de Ven), whose sexual appetite matches his own. As the 
affair progresses, they decide to marry, but differences between Eric's 
and his in-laws' value systems bring about the end of their romance. Years 
later, Eric and Olga meet again and finally achieve some closure to their 
turbulent relationship. The film is constructed as a series of flashbacks 
through which Eric's inner world and sensibility are slowly revealed.
The film opens with Eric bludgeoning a man to death before putting 
a bullet between the eyes of a young woman. There is a panning shot of 
Eric's room until the camera freezes on him lying on his bed, with these 
fantasies still fresh in his mind. He leafs through a box of photographs 
of the same woman, who we later learn is Olga. The next sequence follows 
at a frenetic pace with Eric's seduction of a series of random women, and 
his obsessive collecting of sexual souvenirs. In an interesting narrative 
composition, halfway through Turkish Delight we are brought back to 
the present, and the latter section picks up from where the film started. 
The mood of the final third is vastly different from that of the beginning, 
almost as if it were another film. It is transformed into a moving tale of 
love and loss, of ecstasy and despair; while there is a fair degree of erotic 
content, it is tempered with extreme doses of both fantasy and reality.
The free-spirited sexuality that drives Verhoeven's films is at the heart 
of Turkish Delight, here presented as the ultimate assault on bourgeois 
values. Sustained by the extreme behavior of the protagonist, this 
unconventional romance never fails to provoke, its effect enhanced by 
the explosive chemistry between Hauer and van de Ven.  RDe

El espíritu de la colmena  Víctor Erice, 1973
The Spirit of the Beehive
Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive takes almost twenty minutes to 
establish a few, basic facts—that there is a family comprising a father 
(Fernando Fernán Gómez), a mother (Teresa Gimpera), and two girls 
(Isabel Tellería as Isabel, Ana Torrent as Ana). Erice shows us the man with 
his bees, and in his study; the woman writing, riding, and passing a letter 
into a train; the girls in a crowd at a makeshift movie hall screening James 
Whale's Frankenstein (1931). These introductory portraits figure as studies 
in haunted solitude, the windows of the character's rooms resembling 
the cell-structures of the father's beehive.
This is a mysterious, unforgettable film, touching on many bases but 
refusing to congeal into any one genre or intention. As elsewhere in Erice's 
sadly unprolific career, the family unit is seen as the site of psychic trauma, 
and celebrated as the one place where intimate community seems possible.
Erice evokes with breathtaking delicacy the ambience of this small 
Castilian town. The characters dream of an elsewhere until reality comes 
crashing into an abandoned farmhouse—a political fugitive whom the 
impressionable, frightened but fascinated Ana takes to be the wandering 
"spirit" of the Frankenstein monster incarnated. This movie that begins 
as a fairy tale ("Once upon a time . . . ") ends with a stirring declaration 
addressed to the spirits of the wind: "I am Ana."  AM

The Harder They Come  Perry Henzell, 1973
569
A slice-of-life film set in Jamaica's slums, Perry Henzell's The Harder They 
Come features a pretty shopworn scenario: A country boy comes to the 
city and butts heads with local baddies. But as a low-budget homage to 
gangster films, The Harder They Come works great.
Thanks to the rough locations and unpolished acting, the film speeds 
along with a raw verisimilitude. Jimmy Cliff plays the naive country boy 
who finds himself diving headfirst into a fight between corrupt cops and 
gangs that have infiltrated the reggae industry. Indeed, as impressive a 
mark as The Harder They Come may have made on the midnight movie 
circuit, its most lasting effect was the introduction of reggae to non-
Jamaican ears. The soundtrack (a character in and of itself) features 
stellar work from the likes of Toots and the Maytals, and Cliff himself, 
whose "Many Rivers to Cross" remains one of the most soulful songs ever 
recorded. The soundtrack immediately set the stage for the ascent of 
superstar Bob Marley, but from the perspective of Jamaicans reggae 
was, of course, old news. They embraced the film as a vivid portrait of 
their meager everyday lives, a gritty postcard sent from the Caribbean 
to the world at large.  JKl

La planète sauvage  René Laloux, 1973
Fantastic Planet
Animation became big business again in the late 1980s, and ever since 
then, it's become less and less likely that there will be another full-length 
animated feature quite as weird as René Laloux's underground French 
classic Fantastic Planet. Drawn with sharp details in warm pastel colors, 
the movie is just the kind of hippie allegory—and trippy visual 
experience—that many filmmakers of the 1960s produced.
Adapted from a novel by Stefan Wul, Fantastic Planet was inspired by 
the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Russians in the late 1960s. On the 
planet Ygam lives a race of giant, alien beings called Traags. These Traags 
keep the oddly humanlike Oms as pets, often treating them with the 
sadism and perverse maternalism humans frequently inflict upon their 
own pets. When one Om absconds with one of the Traags's knowledge 
devices, he uses the tool to foment a wild Om uprising. Laloux's film, 
which won the 1973 Cannes Grand Prix Prize, is a welcome respite from 
slick animated marketing vehicles and countless shoddy imitators.
Started in Prague but completed in Paris because of political 
pressure, Fantastic Planet uses an accessible medium to show the evils 
of propaganda and express the need for individuality. Laloux's vision 
of a Dalí-meets-Krazy Kat alien landscape populated by twisted 
creatures is quite striking, even if the film's psychedelic elements haven't 
exactly aged well.  JKl

Amarcord  Federico Fellini, 1973
Federico Fellini is at his gloomiest when dealing with individuals (as in 
8 1⁄2 [1963]), and at his happiest when dealing with gangs, packs, and 
crowds. A magnificent scene in Amarcord is devoted to recording the 
diverse movements of every member of a community toward a beach. 
Propelled by Nino Rota's music, the entire world flows and sings in 
rhythmic fusion. And ultimately, Fellini will mark the end of a day and of 
a wedding ceremony—as well as the end of his reminiscence (and thus 
his film) and even the end of an era—by slowly emptying a long shot of 
its formerly teeming mass of humanity.
Amarcord ("I remember") is the least grandiose and most immediate 
of the maestro's later films and deserves to be rated among the finest 
screen memoirs of the twentieth century. It offers an extraordinarily 
lyrical and vivid succession of vignettes, inside the most subtly rigorous 
narrative structure of Fellini's career.
It is the least obviously modernist of Fellini's films of the 1960s and 
beyond, eschewing the sorts of self-reflexive games that fill Roma (1972) 
or Ginger and Fred (1986). Although the figure of the boy Titta is obviously 
his alter ego, Fellini builds a generously fractured mosaic that belongs 
to no one central character or even the on-screen narrator (the old, 
amateur historian who is a typically Felliniesque figure of fun)—a 
palpable influence on Scorsese's epic chronicles of criminal life, Goodfellas 
(1990) and Casino (1996). Amarcord uses certain time-honored, classical 
devices, such as a progression through the seasons, to great effect to 
wheel through a various modes, from the comic to the melancholic.
Like many autobiographical tales written or filmed, this one weaves 
the innocent, limited viewpoint of children into its wider social context, 
which here heralds the reign of Fascism in Italy in the 1930s. Poignant 
indeed is the gap, gradually revealed to the viewer, between the hints 
of violence and social exclusion to come (especially in relation to the 
Jewish population), and the life-affirming antics of youth. But children 
are not the only ones duped, for the politics of Fascism comes to the 
adoring masses as showbiz—a giant head of Mussolini is paraded 
through the streets in an especially brilliant sequence poised between 
comedy and mordant social commentary—and mixed up with the 
glamorous images of the silver screen, as shown in a fantasy sequence 
imagined by town belle La Gradisca. 
Fellini's comedy, refreshingly, goes to the outer limits of vulgarity in 
a number of hilarious scenes centered on urination, masturbation, and 
breast worship, revisiting the peculiarly Italian form of the "teen movie" 
genre, which he vigorously pioneered in I Vitelloni (1953).
Fellini's style, sometimes too baroque for its own good in works such 
as Casanova (1976), is streamlined here into a pure, exalted poetry of mist, 
flowing camera movements, pastel colors, and lightly artificial set design. 
A triumph of artistic form, its emotions are direct and affecting.  AM

Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  
Sam Peckinpah, 1974
Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is one of those rare films that divides 
audiences into those who rate it a five-star classic and those who see it 
as a one-star dog. Sam Peckinpah's most brutal, nihilistic vision follows 
seedy piano player Benny (Warren Oates) through a modern-day Mexico 
made as infernal as the nightmare Western world of the director's earlier 
classic, The Wild Bunch (1969).
Because his daughter has been impregnated by the now-dead 
Alfredo, El Jefe (Emilio Fernandez, reincarnating his Wild Bunch evil 
patriarch) puts a bounty on the eponymous relic and Benny hopes to 
collect. Toting the fly-blown head across the desert in a sack, Oates 
tangles with mob hit-men and crazed bikers, hooks up with earth-
mother whore Isela Vega, and arrives at the hacienda for one of the 
director's trademarked bullet-strewn apocalypse finales. Bring Me the 
Head of Alfredo Garcia is the quintessence of "cinema grunge," with an 
unshaven and weaselly antihero and a parade of amazingly corrupt 
supporting characters. Peckinpah goes out of his way to make the 
settings sleazy and repulsive, with a trace of blood-streaked pretension 
that suggests Ernest Hemingway at the point his brain exploded. 
Obviously the work of an alcoholic genius, with moments of affecting 
melancholy and beauty even during the rapes and gunfights.  KN
The Towering Inferno was the film that helped define the disaster movie 
genre. Like Airport (1970) and Earthquake (1974), it assembled a group 
of A-list stars and visited on them a spectacular catastrophe that left only 
a few alive. It was a formula studios would repeat throughout the 1970s.
The setting is San Francisco. On the eve of the opening of a new 
skyscraper, its architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) worries about the 
safety of the electrics. Despite his concerns, the opening goes ahead, 
with an exclusive party near the top floor. When a fire eventually breaks 
out below, the guests are stranded, prompting Roberts and fire chief 
O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen) to take desperate measures to save them.
The Towering Inferno boasted some high-profile on-screen talent. 
Newman and McQueen—both exponents of the cooler, more naturalistic 
performance style that emerged from the 1950s—were joined by stars 
of the "classical" Hollywood era like Fred Astaire. But all were second to 
the movie's main attraction: its state-of-the-art action scenes depicting 
the skyscraper's fiery demise, overseen by "Master of Disaster" Irwin Allen. 
In a footnote arguably more dramatic than the onscreen action, stars 
Newman and McQueen argued over who was to get top billing, a conflict 
ultimately resolved by placing their names diagonally on the credits.  EL

Dersu Uzala is a spectacular epic, made in screen-filling 70mm in the 
Soviet Union during a period when the great Japanese director Akira 
Kurosawa was surprisingly out of favor in his homeland. Dersu Uzala's 
international success and Best Foreign Language Film Oscar were factors 
in restoring the filmmaker's reputation, but its understated approach 
also served as a reminder that Kurosawa was a genuine master, not just 
a skilled maker of action-oriented samurai entertainments. This vast 
movie, dominated by awesomely empty landscapes, is also an intimate 
two-character piece built on tiny gestures and a simple evocation of 
deep love between apparent opposites.
Set in Siberia at the turn of the century and based on a story by 
Vladimir Arseniev, the film revolves around the relationship between an 
officer (Yuri Solomin) on a mapmaking expedition and Dersu (Maksim 
Munzuk), an elderly, bow-legged peasant woodsman recruited as a 
guide for the survey. Through minor brushes with bandits and a major 
struggle with the elements, Dersu shows his strength and knowledge 
of his environment. In the film's most tense sequence, a threatening 
storm gathers as the heroes use a theodolite and some grass to rig up 
life-saving shelter in the wilderness. It's about the vulnerability and 
hardiness of man in the vastness of creation, but it gets to its huge 
theme through a buildup of little details.
 At first, the officer's associates think Dersu is a comical character, but 
it soon becomes apparent that his natural wisdom makes him far better 
suited than they are to endure in the amazingly harsh and unpredictably 
dangerous landscape. Five years after the initial expedition, the officer 
returns to Siberia to finish the job and rejoices in his reunion with Dersu, 
only to realize that the old man's health is failing—Dersu worries that 
he is going blind and that all the region's tigers are stalking him to 
avenge a big cat he has killed. In a poignant stretch, the well-intentioned 
mapmaker tries to take Dersu into his home back in more civilized 
regions but realizes that although the old man could help him survive 
in Siberia, he can't repay the service by fitting Dersu into society.  KN

The Godfather: Part II  Francis Ford Coppola, 1974
"Keep your friends close but your enemies closer." Time and two more 
pictures would highlight the despair and nihilism in The Godfather saga. 
This follow-up to the 1972 landmark original is an essential companion 
piece, "haunted," as writer-director Francis Ford Coppola intended, by 
"the specter" of the first film. Ironically, considering that Coppola was 
nearly fired from the first movie—and was so worried about his financial 
situation that he was holed up in a hotel room scripting The Great 
Gatsby (1974) as The Godfather opened. After the film's enormous success 
Paramount wanted a sequel from him so badly they made him an offer 
he couldn't refuse. Besides receiving a hefty portion of the profits, he 
would also have complete artistic control. 
The Godfather: Part II took six Oscars and is darker, more profound, 
and arguably even more compelling for its elaboration of power's 
corruption into complete moral decay. Scenes, patterns, and motifs 
deliberately mirror the original, but Part II is more elegiac and rueful and 
on a far grander scale, with its complex interweaving of time periods and 
its parallels and contrasts between the two Corleone dons, Vito (Robert 
De Niro) and Michael (Al Pacino). This time unequivocally down on the 
mob, Coppola explores two generations as Michael ascends in power 
and control as he descends into melancholy, ruthlessness, and betrayal. 
Family celebrations are again central to the cycle, the film opening in the 
1950s on the overblown party at Michael's and Kay's (Diane Keaton) Lake 
Tahoe estate in honor of their son Anthony's confirmation. We learn that 
the master plan to legitimatize the Corleone family business is ongoing 
as Michael pursues his criminal interests from Nevada to Cuba. Michael 
is beset by problems at home, government scrutiny, and the threats 
posed by rivals and associates—including the highly influential Actors 
Studio director Lee Strasberg making his film debut, aged seventy-one, 
as Hyman Roth—who take a dim view of Michael's expansionism.
Twinned with Michael's progress is the sepia-toned story of his 
father, born Vito Andolini in turn-of-the-century Corleone, Sicily, where 
a bloody vendetta makes him an orphan, a fugitive emigrant, and a 
bewildered detainee on Ellis Island. Years later, on New York's Lower 
East Side as a grocery clerk and family man, quiet Vito—De Niro, hot off 
Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets (1973), brilliantly reimagining Brando's 
characterization in the first film as a young man and winning his first 
Oscar—observes the power wielded by the feared local crime boss and 
stealthily, remorselessly, usurps it. Respected and prosperous, he returns 
to Corleone to settle old scores while nurturing a heritage for his sons.
Again, the film is full of richly drawn characters and superb set 
pieces—the festa in Little Italy, the New Year's revolution in Havana. It 
is the last shot in The Godfather: Part II that continues to satisfy, 
however, with its chilling image of Michael, his sins accrued beyond 
redemption, alone.  AE

is certain, if history has 
taught us anything, it's 
that you can kill anyone."

Riding a crest of creative energy, Francis Ford Coppola was always 
looking ahead to his next project even as he was still finishing the last. 
The Conversation appeared between the bookends of Godfather I and 
Godfather II (1972 and 1974), and it may seem small compared to those 
dual epics. But small does not mean slight, and The Conversation is 
every bit as provocative as the Godfather movies in its take on America's 
crumbling morals.
Gene Hackman, in a remarkably reserved and internalized 
performance, plays a surveillance expert who feels more at ease 
eavesdropping on strangers from hundreds of feet away than interacting 
with friends in the same room. He's a sad, shy, and inevitably lonely man 
of many secrets who prefers to sit in his spartan apartment playing the 
saxophone, at least until a snippet of conversation gleaned from a jumble 
of static and noise he picked up piques his interest. Troubled by the 
distance professionalism imposes, Hackman personalizes the 
investigation. Sensing an imminent tragedy, he attempts to solve the 
mystery hidden in his scrambled surveillance tapes before time runs out, 
only to discover that the two things he trusts in the world—his eyes and 
ears—have deceived him.
As sad as it is cynical, The Conversation arrived shortly before the 
Watergate break-in and subsequent investigation, when surveillance 
and dishonesty rose to the fore of public consciousness, and in this way 
the film was eerily prescient. But Coppola also presents a postmodern 
study of voyeurism. As Hackman's Harry Caul uncovers more and more 
about his discovery, assembling some horrible truth out of bits and 
pieces of discussion fueled by his own imagination, we discover more 
and more about him. By the time Caul's obsessive investigation falls apart 
around him, he's left with virtually nothing: no friends, no belongings, 
no life, and no freedom in the face of rapidly encroaching and enveloping 
paranoia. Revered by his colleagues for his skills, we see Caul as 
something of a fraud, a broken shell of a man whose uncertainty about 
the world around him has effectively robbed him of any identity.  JKl

The Mirror is a beguiling and remarkable film—full of the pregnant 
mysteriousness of places, people, and gestures. This fugitive self-portrait 
by Andrei Tarkovsky is an intergenerational affair, in which the terse 
melancholy of his mother's situation—abandoned in the 1940s by her 
husband and left to raise a son—is mirrored by his own adult relationships 
(Margarita Terekhova plays both the mother in the past and the present-
day wife). Men, largely absent from the story as from the image, appear 
as voices, and are poignantly identified with the making of art and poetry.
The Mirror is constructed as a collage, in which recreated vignettes 
that blur past and present are freely mingled with archival footage and 
disconnected quotations from classical music. The ambience is dreamlike, 
secretive, elliptical. Yet there is also a beautiful simplicity in Tarkovsky, 
aligning him with Terrence Malick: the movement of natural elements, 
the bottomless landscapes of the human face, and a sense of time 
passing, all conspire to give a sense of the world itself "breathing."
Tarkovsky, like Robert Bresson, is a master of the precisely chosen 
image and sound. The economy of his camera movements and the 
gradual revealing of the disparate parts of any scene create an aura and 
an effect that overflow the material reality of what we see and hear, 
opening a portal to another world. His is a cinema of texture, of aura, 
and the senses. Mirror is all at once an intimate confession, a summoning 
of history, and a cryptic poem.  AM

Chinatown  Roman Polanski, 1974
"It seems like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine by me. 
But, Mrs. Mulwray, I goddamn near lost my nose. And I like it. I like 
breathing through it." Robert Towne wrote Chinatown specifically for his 
friend Jack Nicholson and won the film's only Oscar in a year dominated 
by The Godfather: Part II. It is a conspiracy and a hard-boiled detective 
mystery in the Raymond Chandler/Dashiell Hammett line. It is also 
a highly sophisticated film that covered everyone involved in glory, 
including audiences who responded appreciatively to the compelling, 
complex puzzle and colossal performances.
Private eye Jake Gittes is more dapper, humorous, prosperous, and 
alienated than Chandler's Philip Marlowe or Hammett's Sam Spade. Jake 
is a former cop haunted by the past when his beat was Los Angeles's 
Chinatown. This is intriguingly alluded to, suggesting it represents failure 
and being out of his depth in something he doesn't understand, and 
hinting at the disaster he brings down back in Chinatown at the film's 
fateful climax. Jake is hired by a dolled-up broad (Diane Ladd) to spy on 
her allegedly philandering husband, prominent chief engineer for the 
city's water and power department. He gets the dirt but a rude awakening 
when the real and outraged Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) appears. Jake, 
who doesn't like being made a fool of, persists in investigating further as 
intimidation and corpses mount. This leads him to bluff tycoon and chief 
villain Noah Cross (John Huston) into a catastrophe of greed, murder, 
and incest in the mean streets and orange groves of 1930s Los Angeles.
It was Roman Polanski's genius that made the film not merely an 
intelligent and intricate narrative but a great, disturbing vision. With his 
tragically intimate experience of evil, Polanski toughened up the script, 
most crucially by changing Towne's ending to the bitter but unforgettable 
conclusion which leaves Jake pole-axed. It was also Polanski who 
observed with humane and sharp perception the collected oddballs, 
victims, and miscreants (including the little weasel who slits Jake's nose, 
played by the director himself). That it is ultimately his film was verified 
by the unfathomable 1990 sequel The Two Jakes, scripted by Towne and 
directed by Nicholson revisiting his Gittes in 1948. It, too, is well acted, 
complicated, and polished-looking, but sadly lacking in unifying magic.
Faye Dunaway, whose neurasthenic quality has never been exploited 
to better advantage, is the cool, elegant Evelyn, whose birthmark—"a 
flaw in the iris"—represents the film's heart of darkness. She is presented 
as a high-class femme fatale and indeed her suspect motives enhance 
the menace and jeopardy until both her anxiousness and her glowing 
seduction scene are suddenly cast in a different light by the most 
shocking of Chinatown's revelations. It is still Nicholson's show, though, 
his fatalistic glamor and presence as the cynical, wisecracking, impulsively 
decent snoop unspoiled by the ignominy of sporting a bandage over his 
nose for much of the film's running time.  AE

A Woman Under the Influence  John Cassavetes, 1974
John Cassavetes and his wife Gena Rowlands collaborated on a number 
of challenging and risky projects, but it was Rowlands's exhausting 
portrayal of a housewife's impending nervous breakdown in A Woman 
Under the Influence that remains the apotheosis of their improvisation-
fueled method. Full of ticks, strange noises, and unpredictable 
mannerisms, Rowlands's descent into madness eventually gives way to 
the realization that her frustrating behavior may not be as spontaneous 
or debilitating as it seems. Similarly, her rock of a husband (Peter Falk) 
may not be as sane as he initially appears to be, and the same could be 
said for his support network of friends and acquaintances.
Stuck in the middle are the couple's three children, a steady reminder 
that amidst the confusion is a surprisingly operational (if decidedly 
unconventional) nuclear family. In fact, A Woman Under the Influence may 
best be considered an unflinching depiction of what it sometimes takes 
to keep a family together, though Cassavetes never injects the film with 
such blatant moralizing. Rather, he prefers to leave the action ambiguous 
and relentless, united by Rowlands's unhinged and kinetic performance, 
and a strangely touching sentimentalism that achieves its emotional 
force honestly—mostly free from standard-issue plot conventions.  JKl
Young Frankenstein  Mel Brooks, 1974
Mel Brooks's 1974 black-and-white horror spoof of Mary Shelley's classic 
novel is the prolific writer-director's most balanced comedy in his 
overegged oeuvre. Having yet to come to terms with being the grandson 
of the famous Victor Frankenstein, Gene Wilder's modern young 
brain surgeon Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced, we are told, 
"Fronkunshteen") returns to the family castle in Transylvania. Assisted by 
trusty hunchback Igor (bulbous-eyed Marty Feldman), pretty village 
girl Inga (Teri Garr), and housekeeper Frau Bleucher (Cloris Leachman, 
so gloriously sinister that she went on to play similar roles in two 
more Brooks films), he sets out to recreate his grandfather's pioneering 
work in human reanimation. Who could predict the reaction between 
Frederick's overcoifed (and later oversexed) fiancée Elizabeth (Madeline 
Kahn) and the Monster (Peter Boyle)?
Gene Hackman has a show-stealing cameo as the lonely blind man 
who makes the mistake of offering hot soup and a cigar to the fire-shy 
untamed creature. Shot in the same castle and featuring lab equipment 
originally used in the 1931 James Whale classic, the film's overall 
reverential feel is marred (in a good way) by the singing and dancing 
"Puttin' on the Ritz" sequence featuring the monster and the doctor. 
A silly take and a serious homage, Young Frankenstein earned Academy 
Award nominations for Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay.  KK

Loosely inspired by the real-life story of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein—
as was Psycho (1960) before it and The Silence of the Lambs (1991) 
after it—Tobe Hooper's ultra-low-budget shock-horror classic The Texas 
Chain Saw Massacre opened to a firestorm of controversy, and since then 
has continued to generate heated debate over its aesthetic merits and 
potentially damaging effects on viewers.
The film, which begins with some voice-over by a young (and then 
unknown) John Laroquette, follows five hippieish teenagers on a road 
trip through 1970s Texas who have the grave misfortune of bunking 
down next to an all-male clan of cannibalistic ex-slaughterhouse workers. 
The most memorable baddie is Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen in the role 
of a lifetime), he of the eponymous chain saw and gruesome mask made 
from the facial skin of several of his victims. After an unforgettable family 
dinner in which she is served as dessert to the ancient, vampiric patriarch 
who can barely move his lips enough to suck the blood from her finger, 
Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns)—the one teen still alive—manages an 
escape from this chamber of horrors by jumping through a second-story 
window. After a seemingly endless run through the woods at night, with 
Leatherface's motorized saw (which incredibly never runs out of gas) 
literally inches away from her back, Sally finally hops on the back of a 
conveniently situated pickup truck and drives away as Leatherface angrily 
waves his phallic weapon in the morning light.
Upon viewing this intense picture, with its relentless pace and quasi-
documentary style, critic Rex Reed declared it one of the most frightening 
movies ever made. Shortly after its release, the Museum of Modern Art 
purchased a print for its permanent collection, and the film was honored 
in the "Directors' Fortnight" at Cannes. The accolades continued to pour 
in—the prestigious London Film Festival even went so far as to name it 
"Outstanding Film of the Year" in 1974. Eventually grossing close to 
$31 million at U.S. box offices alone, and spawning three sequels (plus a 
remake), Hooper's warped labor of love stood for a time as one of the 
most profitable independent films in motion picture history.  SJS
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  Tobe Hooper, 1974
Tobe Hooper hoped to get a PG 
rating for the film by keeping most 
of the violence implied offscreen.
"There are horror films 
which . . . deal with 
the psychological, the 
suggested . . . and then 
there are the sheer, 
in-your-face, terrifying 
horrors which threaten 
to drain your body of 
sweat and lock your jaw 
shut forever. This is one 
of the latter."

Though it may not be the peak of Mel Brooks's cinematic output—
The Producers is still more shocking and pointed—with its mixture of 
surrealism, slapstick, and (then groundbreaking) vulgarity, Blazing 
Saddles is certainly his most influential film. Despite both its hackneyed 
setting—the old West—and its 1970s veneer—hip gags about race and 
sex—it stands as one of the more brilliant works in the career of a great 
1950s comedy writer.
For all Brooks's much-publicized nods to the zany comedy of the 
Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges, Blazing Saddles owes a great 
deal to the deranged, parodic, reference-obsessed humor of early MAD 
magazine. Brooks's film takes on that tradition—sight gags where 
Klansmen and Nazis wait in line to join an 1870s lynch mob, oxen with 
YES and NO painted on them, verbal references to other movies ("You'd 
do it for Randolph Scott!")—and puts it into the cinema for the first 
time. In doing so, it preempted and influenced the Zucker Brothers and 
their imitators, and hence invented a genre (there's also some Monty 
Python in the ending, which mirrors that of Holy Grail [1975]).
Blazing Saddles may, essentially, be an extended riff on High Noon 
(1952), but its genius lies in being more than just a parody. While other, 
later Brooks movies waver by just being straight pastiches of one 
particular film, Blazing Saddles adds additional layers, most notable of 
which is the twist that the new sheriff is black. Cleavon Little (whose 
career sadly peaked with this film, and who died of colon cancer at fifty-
three) beat Richard Pryor for the role of Sheriff Bart, largely because the 
studio believed that Pryor was an insane drug addict; and he is superbly 
supported by an almost restrained Gene Wilder. The movie is laced with 
the "n" word to an extent that anyone not familiar with modern rap 
records may find alarming, but is in fact constantly hilarious. While 
hardly a political film about color, Blazing Saddles' constant glee in using 
the word and mocking white prejudice makes the whole concept of 
racism seem absurd.  KK

English-speaking viewers will never taste the real flavor of this film. 
It starts with the title, which means nothing in translation but, in its 
original version and for French-speaking people, opens wide the doors 
toward tales, jokes, and children's stories. Celine and Julie Go Boating is a 
password to a realm where sinuous roads travel the fringe between the 
exterior world and intimate dreams, between present and past, and 
between reality and fiction. 
This is a movie by one of the most demanding and delicate of film 
critics, Jacques Rivette, who became a remarkable explorer of the nature 
of cinema through the questioning of its relations with the real world and 
with other forms of art. Rivette's magnificent work has always been made 
with a joyful taste for telling tales, watching pretty women, listening to 
songs and stories, and sharing love and admiration for actors. Never, 
perhaps, was it designed in such a free and inventive way than at this 
moment, when he created Celine and Julie Go Boating's narrative 
labyrinths with the film's actresses. Along with writer Eduardo di 
Gregorio, Celine (Juliet Berto), Julie (Dominique Labourier), Camille 
(Bulle Ogier), and Sophie (Marie-France Pisier) gave birth to this sunny 
inner travel, this diving into mirrors with a funny splash, a dance with 
specters so light. Ghosts and smiles followed the silent music, Jacques 
Rivette seemed to conduct without moving, and the world was spinning 
round—magic.  J-MF

Rainer Werner Fassbinder had the plot germ in mind for this film—the 
unlikely love affair between a sixty-something German cleaning lady in 
Munich and a Moroccan guest worker twenty years her junior—at least 
since The American Soldier (1970), in which the chambermaid Margarethe 
von Trotta recounts the story of Emmi and her husband Ali. What he 
produced with it in 1974 combines poignant melodrama and occasionally 
over-the-top social satire. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul takes its visual style from 
Fassbinder's patient camera work, lingering on motionless faces or 
retreating through a doorway to a respectful distance. The film's texture 
is created from the details of working-class life, including the songs 
played on the local jukebox, and its heart from the acting of Brigitte Mira 
as Emmi and El Hedi ben Salem as Ali.
It starts out as a joke. Ali, challenged by a German girl in the bar he 
frequents to dance with the old lady sitting alone at the table. He finds 
a woman kind enough to invite him in for coffee, and actually interested 
in the man hidden behind the all-purpose "Ali"—with which Germans 
replace unpronounceable (and to them irrelevant) Arab names. Both are 
lonely and the love affair blossoms against and despite a backdrop of 
near-universal mockery and hostility from neighbors and family. Emmi 
doesn't want to care, and pretends not to, but other people make up her 
world and she cannot help but care.
Gradually, though, external pressure lessens, not out of real acceptance 
but because everyone wants something from Emmi. Fassbinder falters 
when inner tensions mount in inverse proportion: the Emmi we have 
come to know would happily prepare couscous, not spurn it as foreign, 
and would never objectify Ali, showing off his muscles to her colleagues 
from work. But neither this nor the caricatured racist grocer and gossiping 
women (a homage to F.W. Murnau's great 1924 silent film The Last Laugh) 
detract from the indomitable and moving connection forged between 
these two people—and finding happiness with each other against all 
odds they are wise enough to know how lucky they are.  JW

1975
Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's most underrated film, Barry Lyndon—adapted 
from William Makepeace Thackeray's 1844 picaresque novel The Memoirs 
of Barry Lyndon, Esq., As Told By Himself—inhabits the eighteenth century 
the way A Clockwork Orange (1971) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) 
inhabit the future, with perfect sets, costumes, and cinematography 
trapping characters whose rises and falls are at once deeply tragic 
and absurdly comical.
Narrated in avuncular form by Michael Hordern, who replaces 
Thackeray's ironically self-serving first-person hero with wise third-person 
melancholia, the film follows the fortunes of Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), 
a handsome Irish youth forced to flee his hometown after a duel with a 
cowardly English officer (Leonard Rossiter). Stripped of his small fortune 
by a deferential highwayman, Barry joins the British army and fights in the 
Seven Years' War, attempting a desertion that leads him into the Prussian 
army. A position as a spy on an exquisitely painted con man (Patrick 
Magee) leads to a life of gambling around the courts of Europe, and just 
before the intermission our hero achieves all he could want by marrying 
the wealthy, titled, beautiful widow Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). A sign 
of Barry's willingness to humiliate himself for worldly advancement is that 
he takes his married name from his wife's titled first husband. However, 
Part Two reveals that Barry can no more be a clockwork orange than the 
protagonist of Kubrick's previous film, and his spendthrift ways, foolhardy 
pursuit of social advancement, and unwise treatment of his new family 
lead to several disasters, climaxing in another horrific (yet farcical) duel.
Shot by John Alcott almost entirely in the "magic hour," that point of 
the day when the light is mistily perfect, with innovative use of candlelight 
for interiors, Barry Lyndon looks ravishing, but the perfection of its images 
is matched by the inner turmoil of seemingly frozen characters. Kubrick 
is often accused of being unemotional, but his restraint here is all the 
more affecting, as when Barry is struck by the deaths of those close to 
him, his wife writhes into madness, or his stepson (Leon Vitali) vomits 
before he can stand his ground in a duel.  KN

The Rocky Horror Picture Show  Jim Sharman, 1975
Richard O'Brien's unusual stage musical was translated onto the big 
screen in 1975, and on its initial release it flopped. However, when a New 
York cinema began to show it at midnight screenings word soon spread 
about the odd spoof sci-fi/horror film. It became cult viewing and now 
holds the record for the longest theatrical run of any movie, having been 
shown in the same Munich, Germany cinema each week for more than 
twenty-seven years.
A very young Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick star as Janet and 
Brad, an innocent couple whose car breaks down on a stormy night 
forcing them to seek refuge in a nearby castle, unaware that it belongs 
to stocking-and-suspender-clad transvestite Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry, 
in a role he played on stage) and his Transylvanian pals, including sinister 
Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn). Also living at 
the mansion are biker Eddie (Meat Loaf), a botched creation (think 
Frankenstein's monster) of Frank N. Furter's, and Rocky (Peter Hinwood), 
his buff and tanned improvement/replacement.
Narrated by "the Criminologist" (Charles Gray), the film is a glam rock 
celebration of sexuality as Frank N. Furter and his clan try to seduce the 
virginal Brad and Janet to the tune of memorable songs like "Touch-a 
Touch-a Touch Me," "Sweet Transvestite," and, of course, "Time Warp." 
The mixture of brazen sexuality, tongue-in-cheek humor, outrageous 
clothing, and double entendres are not quite like anything else ever 
committed to film. It is easy to see why the easy-to-remember songs and 
quotable dialogue have been such a hit with fans—the most devoted 
of whom dress up like the various characters, act out portions of the 
movie at screenings, and bring props for certain parts of the film (for 
example, they throw rice during the wedding scene). The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show may not be one to watch with Grandma, perhaps, but it's a 
terrific exercise in kitsch fun nonetheless.  JB

Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 
1080 Bruxelles  Chantal Akerman, 1975
One of the key works of feminist filmmaking, not to mention one of the 
most important European films of the 1970s, Belgian director Chantal 
Akerman's minimalist masterwork Jeanne Dielman is admittedly 
demanding viewing, and this undoubtedly contributes to the film's 
marginalized status four decades later. The film offers a view of bourgeois 
ennui so spare and bleak that it makes L'Avventura (1960) look like a Frank 
Tashlin picture. With a degree of aesthetic rigor unusual even within 
that era's European auteur cinema, Jeanne Dielman is a three-hour 
documentation of alienation, and the methodical precision of Akerman's 
approach inarguably defeats all but the most patient of filmgoers.
The film chronicles three days in the life of its eponymous protagonist, 
a widowed homemaker who supports the comfortable existence she 
shares with her adolescent son through occasional prostitution. The bulk 
of the picture simply observes Jeanne (Delphine Seyrig) in the minutiae 
of her daily life. Using static long shots, Akerman allows the monotonous 
domestic tasks to unfold in real time. However, the film is largely a 
bravura conceptual exercise ultimately defined by its final two shots. It 
concludes as Jeanne, after servicing one of her clients, calmly stabs him 
to death with a pair of scissors. Then she sits serenely alone in the 
darkness of the family dining room. Whereas the writer-director's other 
films are similarly meditative and deliberate in their style of pacing, they 
are largely also mesmerizing and hypnotic experiments in narrative. This 
film, however, is arguably Akerman's coldest, most difficult and remote 
work, and many will be left wondering if the film's expansive running 
time was truly necessary to relate the slim character study.
Although the film is taxing, its rewards are great and often linked to 
the work's length. For one, Akerman's feminist thesis is conveyed with a 
cogent urgency as a result of her decision to depict Jeanne's life in such 
unsparing detail. It isn't enough for Akerman to suggest the tedium of 
her protagonist's selfless existence, but rather, by explicitly presenting 
the drab banality of her routine in real time, Akerman expertly conveys 
the stifling emptiness that ultimately drives Jeanne to her tragic final act.
The film also triumphs as a study in performance. Seyrig's perfectly 
realized portrayal provides subtle glimpses into Jeanne's psychological 
unraveling, with slight gradations of behavior that would likely be 
imperceptible if contained within a film of more compact structure and 
traditional dramatic emphasis. By the three-hour mark, the microscopic 
tightening of facial muscles and increased brusqueness of gesture that 
accompany the boiling of coffee or the overcooking of potatoes assume 
the heft of epic melodrama. It may be the kind of picture that's better to 
contemplate in theory rather than as a vehicle for viewing pleasure, 
but for the spectator attuned to Akerman's austere approach, her film 
remains, in many respects, an unforgettable achievement.  TCr

O Thiassos  Theo Angelopoulos, 1975
The Traveling Players
Since the early 1970s, Greek director Theo Angelopoulos has tirelessly 
explored a landscape that has largely remained unseen in cinema. His 
subject is Greece—not the sunny land of the travel brochures, but a 
northern wintry one, situated in a Balkan geography and bounded both 
by its classical and modern past and by geographic borders. Formerly a 
critic for a socialist newspaper, Angelopoulos claimed that the colonels' 
Junta provided his subject matter and made him want to understand 
the historic roots of dictatorship. He made The Traveling Players more or 
less surreptitiously, telling the authorities that he was working on a 
version of the Orestes myth, set in the time of the German occupation. 
This is not inaccurate: in Angelopoulos's film, a troupe of traveling actors 
moves around Greece between 1939 and 1952, attempting to perform 
a nineteenth-century popular play, Golfo the Shepherdess. But they are 
always interrupted by history—from the German occupation, through 
the Civil War, to the rise of the Papagos government—and their attempts 
at performing are invariably interrupted by gunfire, flight, or death.
The members of the troupe themselves reincarnate figures from the 
Oresteia—Aegisthus (Vangelis Kazan) is a Nazi collaborator, Orestes 
(Petros Zarkadis) a communist partisan, Agamemnon (Stratos Pachis) 
the troupe's betrayed leader. They are less characters, conventionally 
speaking, than archetypes or even ghosts. Time and space in the film 
have much the same uncertain quality that character does, and a single 
shot can drift seamlessly from one period to another.
Angelopoulos is one of cinema's great landscape artists, a specialist 
in those moments where space turns into the stage for a vast dramatic 
panorama. But he is also a filmmaker of motion, who makes films about 
travel—on trains, cars, buses, on foot, and above all in the imagination. 
Claiming Orson Welles and Kenji Mizoguchi as his primary influences, 
Angelopoulos is known—together with his long-time cameraman 
Giorgos Arvanitis—as a specialist of flowing, precisely choreographed 
long takes. The Traveling Players is a prime example of that, a four-hour 
film containing only eighty shots. In the most distinctive of these, the 
camera and the actors move in such a way that time and space seem to 
turn inside out, to achieve a Möbius-strip elasticity.
Angelopoulos is a masterful director of crowd movements and set 
pieces: a characteristic shot that recurs throughout The Traveling Players 
has a group of figures walking through a town and emerging, as the 
camera tracks through the streets, in another year, perhaps crossing the 
path of another, larger grouping. His films suggest a theory of history as 
a sort of parade—at once funeral procession and political demonstration, 
continually crossing its own tracks, changing its direction and ideological 
colors. In The Traveling Players, movement itself becomes a formidably 
acute and supple tool for historical analysis.  JRom

It all started with a TV show called Monty Python's Flying Circus, featuring 
the verbal and visual antics of a comedy team comprising five British 
wits—John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Graham 
Chapman—and an American named Terry Gilliam, whose cutout 
animations stitched the program's flyaway episodes together.
Produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, which seemed a 
tad surprised by the anarchic nature of the capers it had unleashed, the 
show ran more or less continuously from 1969 to 1974. A shot at wide-
screen success seemed an obvious next step, especially because the 
compilation film And Now for Something Completely Different had been 
well received in 1971. These things combined led to the 1975 production 
of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, written by the whole Python crew 
and codirected by Gilliam and Jones.
The process of making the movie had aspects as darkly comical as a 
typical Python sketch. For one thing, the two directors didn't make a 
compatible duo; they had different visions of the movie's style, and Gilliam 
resented Jones's tendency to reduce the grandeur of his set designs with 
cramped camera setups. For another, Chapman's alcoholism was in full 
flower, sometimes rendering the star of the production—in the key role 
of King Arthur—unable to enunciate his lines while the camera rolled.
But hey, you can't keep a good Python down. The troupe triumphed 
over these problems as readily as they overcame the production's 
dauntingly low funding. Like much of Monty Python's best work, 
Holy Grail is a keen-minded parody with a political edge, debunking a 
foundational myth of Western power while playing Brechtian havoc with 
traditionalist ideas ranging from benevolent despotism to chivalric 
masculinity. And oh yes—it's a laugh riot, too.  DS

Deewaar  Yash Chopra, 1975
The Wall
591
Yash Chopra had his own production house where he established his 
trademark style of romance among the wealthy urban bourgeoisie. But 
Deewaar, produced by Gulshan Rai's Trimurti Films, is more of an action 
movie, driven by one of the best scripts in Hindi film history, written by 
the major screenwriters of the 1970s, Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. 
India's greatest-ever superstar, Amitabh Bachchan, plays the career-
defining role of Vijay Verma—an innocent child whose family is wronged 
taking the law into his own hands in search of justice. Bombay provides 
a spectacular setting, with scenes shot in its docks, busy streets, and its 
glamorous hotels and mansions. One of the most famous dialogues in 
Hindi film history is the exchange between Vijay and his brother Ravi 
(Shashi Kapoor), who has become a policeman in his own search for 
justice. Vijay argues that he has riches and Ravi has nothing. Ravi's reply: 
"Mere paas maa hai" ("I have Mummy"). Vijay's relationship with a call 
girl, shown in unusually explicit detail, is overshadowed by his devotion 
to his mother. At the end of the film, this avowed atheist dies in his 
mother's arms in a temple, saying he could never sleep away from 
her, in one of the most celebrated and symbolic death scenes in the 
history of Hindi film.  RDw

Dog Day Afternoon  Sidney Lumet, 1975
Sidney Lumet's taut film of the true story of a bank robbery turned 
hostage crisis in Brooklyn is as quintessentially New York as anything by 
Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese. Al Pacino and John Cazale play hapless 
would-be bankrobbers (Sonny and Sal respectively), who are forced 
through circumstances into an impossible situation. Before the robbers 
can make their getaway, the bank is surrounded by police and Sonny 
decides to hold the bank employees and try to negotiate an escape. 
Abandoned before the robbery by their third accomplice, Sonny and Sal 
are outnumbered by the increasingly unruly employees. As the situation 
continues and Sonny's loud discussions with the police over a bullhorn 
are heard throughout the streets, a crowd gathers and begins to cheer 
Sonny on. For a few brief moments during the social unrest of the early 
1970s, Sonny becomes a counterculture hero.
Dog Day Afternoon moves between moments of hyperbolic absurdity 
and scenes of real tragedy. Perhaps the most poignant character in 
the film is Cazale's Sal, whose limitations are revealed by his answer, 
"Wyoming," when Sonny asks him what country he'd like to visit if 
they are able to get their demands met. The film captures the swirling 
passions of a moment in its characters' lives and in history, with a 
brilliant immediacy.  RH

A project of actor Kirk Douglas's for years (he owned the rights, but by 
the time the film made it to production he believed he was too old to 
star in it), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won his son Michael Douglas 
his first Oscar—not as an actor, but as the film's producer.
Based on Ken Kesey's best-selling novel, which he wrote after his 
experiences working in a California Veterans Hospital, the film is set 
in a state mental home where antiestablishment wiseguy Randle P. 
McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is sent for rehabilitation. While there he falls 
under the watchful eye of the sadistic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher, a 
role turned down by several top Hollywood actresses, including Jane 
Fonda, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, and Faye Dunaway), and soon stirs 
up a rebellion against her with the help of some of the other patients.
A groundbreaking film that Kesey apparently never wanted to see—
he was upset that the story isn't told from the perspective of Chief 
Bromden (Will Sampson), as in his book—One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 
made Oscar-night history when it became only the second film to win 
five major awards. Each award was well deserved, with Czech director 
Forman (The Loves of a Blonde [1965], The Firemen's Ball [1967], and 
later Amadeus [1984] and The People vs. Larry Flynt [1996]) delivering a 
hypnotic and humanistic movie filled with eccentric characters 
(among the actors making their film debuts are Brad Dourif and 
Christopher Lloyd) and garnering a career-best performance from 
Fletcher. Nicholson, of course, is mesmerizing as the incarcerated but 
free-spirited McMurphy, and the scenes between him and Fletcher's 
contemptible Nurse Ratched are the most electric of this modern classic 
of American cinema.  JB

Lino Brocka's low-budget hit was a breakthrough for Filipino cinema and 
is still often regarded as the best Filipino film of all time. Julio (Bembol 
Roco), a poor fisherman from the country, comes to Manila to look for 
his lost love, Ligaya (Hilda Koronel). Working at a construction site, he 
encounters unfair labor practices, dangerous working conditions, and 
a range of attitudes and politics among his fellow workers. He also 
becomes involved with a male-prostitution ring. Finally, he finds that 
Ligaya has been recruited by a brothel. Julio's attempt to free her and 
himself from the hell of Manila ends in tragedy.
Manila in the Claws of Brightness captures the harshness of urban 
poverty through an assaulting soundtrack in which industrial noises, 
traffic sounds, and crowd hubbub are prominent, the crudeness of the 
recording and mixing contributing to an overwhelming tension, not 
lessened by the faux-Ennio Morricone songs and synthesizer music. 
The images of urban entrapment and pain are sharply contrasted 
with intermittent flashbacks to the lovers' coastal idyll, demonstrating 
Brocka's commitment to melodrama. The surprisingly strong quotient 
of homoeroticism anticipates Brocka's later Macho Dancer (1988).  CFu

This Rainer Werner Fassbinder classic has often been portrayed as 
the bisexual director-writer-actor's study in homophobic self-hatred. 
However, the plot of Fox and His Friends—about gay, low-life crook Franz 
"Fox" Biberkopf's (Fassbinder) self-delusion of being elevated to the land 
of the rich and beautiful after he wins 500,000 marks in a lottery and 
suddenly becomes the love interest of handsome bourgeois Eugen 
Thiess (Peter Chatel)—is less about sexuality than it is about class. At first 
Fox, with his impulsive energy, insatiable libido, and cunning street 
smarts, seems to have the upper hand in the relationship, putting him 
in stark contrast to Eugen and his circle of friends' lifeless world of 
etiquette. Gradually, however, his brute force is worn down by Eugen's 
condescending treatment, transference of guilt, and manipulation. Fox 
might be a successful predator in the world of hoodlums and whores on 
the street, but in the salon world of capitalists (even small-time ones) he 
is no match for cold-hearted vampires like Eugen.
Fassbinder makes Fox's fateful journey all the more painful by inviting 
us to witness the telling signs of his doom early on, the first and most 
fateful one being his infatuation with and reverence of Eugen's lifestyle. 
The film poignantly dramatizes the ways in which the mass media has 
marketed desire for social status and wealth to the postwar working 
class through commercials, glossy magazines, and soap operas. The 
unforgettable final shot of Fox deprived by Eugen of all his money as 
well as his human dignity, collapsing or maybe dying of a broken heart 
in the subway only to be robbed of his last belongings by some boys, 
has been criticized as a melodramatic gimmick. But Fox's fate bears a 
connection to other men named Franz—mainly played by Fassbinder—
for instance in his Love Is Colder Than Death (1969). However, the 
most significant reference is, of course, to the tragic death of another 
Franz Biberkopf, the protagonist of the Alfred Döblin novel Berlin 
Alexanderplatz (adapted five years later for TV by the director)—one of 
the most powerful descriptions of death in a society where human value 
has a price tag.  MT

Robert Altman's Nashville arrived at the intersection of two important 
periods in American history. It followed the combined scandals of 
Watergate and Vietnam, which diminished America's faith in its 
government and gave rise to a cynical national malaise, but preceded 
the country's bicentennial celebration, meant to honor the values and 
beliefs that gave birth to the United States. Altman recognized the 
hypocrisy of celebrating the roots of a faltering nation and in essence 
twisted the knife, setting his epic in the gaudy, populist heart of show 
business itself: Nashville, the home of country music.
With so much going on culturally, Altman tried to replicate that 
confusion cinematically. Nashville includes two dozen main characters 
and numerous storylines, all apparently colliding chaotically but actually 
controlled carefully by Altman's acute filmmaking instincts. Over the 
course of five days, a music festival and a political campaign cross paths 
(and cross fates), with Altman equating the folly of politics with the sleaze 
and dishonesty of the entertainment industry.
But populating Altman's mosaic is a richly drawn variety of characters, 
some blindly ambitious but others barely holding on in a world caving in 
around them. It's these smaller characters that stick out from the vast cast 
and rambling story, and you root for their success and happiness. But all 
of Nashville's characters bob up and down like buoys in a sea of failure 
and denial. This effect is heightened by Altman's famous overlapping 
dialogue, which constantly shifts your attention to the least expected 
corners of the wide-screen frame and to that barely familiar face in the 
crowd, who may or may not play an important role in the story.
Instead of a straight narrative, Altman works with various themes, but 
he never stresses one over the other. Instead, he uses country music 
(written and performed by his actors) as his Greek chorus, directing the 
flow of the film with their songs of banal populism and passivity. By the 
time the film is over it is unclear exactly what Nashville is about, but 
there's no question something has been conveyed by its colorful 
characters. The film is a portrait of life during wartime, a fight for national 
identity at a time when things like that seemed to matter the least.  JKl

Salò o le centoventi giornate di sodoma  
Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom  Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1975
Salò is notionally based on The 120 Days of Sodom, a work by the 
Marquis de Sade, who gave his name to the form of sexual perversion 
that the film explores. Though the story makes many departures from 
de Sade's work, it retains much of the spirit of it. De Sade's project was 
in part political, one that satirized the established forces of the day, in 
particular the Catholic church. Pasolini too was fervently anticlerical, but 
relates Salò directly to Italian history.
The film is set in the short-lived Republic of Salò, where Mussolini 
made a last stand at the end of World War II. Pasolini was caught up in 
these events, and his brother was killed in Salò. In Pasolini's fantasy of 
this wartime episode, four Fascist libertines have total power over a 
group of attractive young captives of both sexes and subject them to a 
series of sexual tortures and humiliations. These are presented by the 
director in a series of bleakly formal scenes that are curiously devoid 
of erotic passion. There is scant attempt at characterization; even the 
libertines have little in the way of personality and seem to derive no 
real pleasure from their debaucheries, whereas their victims are largely 
anonymous, simply bodies to be abused and penetrated.
Pasolini's intent was to use the unbridled use of power, taken to the 
ultimate of sexual degradation, as a metaphor for Fascism itself, seen as 
a philosophy that worships power for its own sake. But there are other 
messages. One libertine is identified as a bishop, and at one point two 
of the victims are put through a form of marriage ceremony, though 
the consummation is interrupted by the libertines, who interject their 
own bodies into the coupling of the newlyweds. And in a particularly 
notorious scene, a naked young woman is forced to eat excrement, 
which Pasolini maintained was a metaphor for consumer capitalism and 
its production of junk food.
The end of the film is an orgy of cruelty as victims are strangled 
and scalped, and have their tongues cut out and their nipples burned. 
All is set to the music of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, which Pasolini 
considered Fascist music, and a reading of the Cantos of Ezra Pound, the 
American poet who supported Mussolini. Yet though the obscenities 
the film presents have an undeniable power to shock, perhaps what is 
ultimately most disturbing is the sense that by this point in his career 
Pasolini had at best an ambiguous attitude toward the body and 
sexuality. If the object of pornography is to excite sexual desire, Salò 
would not fit the definition, because its effect, and presumably its 
purpose, is to arouse disgust.
Shortly after this powerful and disturbing film was completed, and 
before it was released, Pasolini was murdered. His film was prosecuted 
or banned in many countries and has only recently become generally 
available in Britain and the United States.  EB

"Raise ravens and they'll pluck out your eyes!" So goes the Spanish 
adage—equivalent perhaps to "You reap what you sow"—that gave 
Saura's best-loved film its title. Young Ana, played by the extraordinary 
Ana Torrent, awakes one night and goes downstairs; strange sounds 
seem to be emanating from her widowed father's bedroom. Suddenly a 
woman bursts out the door and flees the house. Her father, a Franco 
military man, is dead, and somehow Ana is sure she's to blame. After this 
haunting opening, Cria! becomes a chronicle of Ana and her two sisters 
as they negotiate the shoals of growing up, learning bit by bit what 
freedom might be.
Made literally as Franco lay dying, the film follows the metaphor of 
life under fascism as a kind of stunted childhood seen in several other 
Spanish movies of the period, yet handles it with a refreshing sensitivity 
and grace. Geraldine Chaplin, Saura's constant muse in these years, is 
wonderful in a dual role as Ana's cancer-stricken mother and the adult 
Ana reflecting back on all these events. Her assured presence as the 
adult Ana seems to imply that fascism is already a thing of the past, 
something painfully endured but in the end conquered.  RP

Picnic at Hanging Rock  Peter Weir, 1975
A ghost story without the ghosts, a puzzle without a solution, and a story 
of sexual repression without the sex, Peter Weir's enigmatic Picnic at 
Hanging Rock remains maddeningly elliptical.
The story itself is deceptively simple: a group of students from an 
all-girl Australian prep school go on a picnic in the Outback. But 
following a delirious hike to the top of the titular landmark, three girls 
and a teacher vanish, leaving behind no clues and the growing suspicion 
that something more dreadful than mere foul play was at work that day. 
With his sharp understanding that fear of the unknown often trumps the 
usual bogeymen, Weir bravely refuses to clarify the many lingering 
mysteries at the center of his brilliant film. When one student does show 
up, her mind is a complete blank.
As depicted, the excursion itself plays out like a fever dream or 
hallucination, a wobbly mirage provoked by the shimmering desert heat, 
and the remainder of the film drips with queasy menace even as Weir 
avoids enlisting overly familiar means of ratcheting up the suspense. 
One conspicuous exception is Bruce Smeaton's haunting, otherworldly 
electronic score, humming like a call from some other dimension.  JKl

India Song  Marguerite Duras, 1975
There is no room for middle ground when viewing the films of Marguerite 
Duras—one either finds the work to be hypnotically seductive or 
maddeningly pretentious, which is not to imply that those two reactions 
are mutually exclusive. Her films are largely an extension of her literature, 
and viewers attuned to experimental European filmmaking of the 1960s 
and 1970s will likely recognize affinities with the cinema of directors 
Alain Resnais (a Duras collaborator) and Alain Robbe-Grillet, both 
thematically (explorations of the effects that time's passing has on the 
memory and identity of enigmatic characters) and formally (a languorous 
tone aided by slow tracking shots).
India Song is Duras's most renowned achievement, a trance-inducing 
evocation of 1937 Calcutta (filmed entirely near Paris), with Delphine Seyrig 
as the wealthy wife of a French diplomat, collapsing under the weight 
of boredom and mental distress. Duras has crafted an elliptical dream 
poem rather than a linear narrative, but India Song is most fascinating in 
its use of language and sound as a contrast to the images on display. 
She creates aural disorientation through jarring off-screen cries and 
shrieks, overlapping and discordant dialogue, and deceptively displaced 
narration, providing a jagged counterpoint to the somnolent visuals.
Duras's follow-up to this film, Son nom de venise dans Calcutta 
Désert (1976), uses India Song's complete soundtrack, accompanied by 
different visuals. India Song is demanding but fascinating viewing.  TCr

Throughout his career, be it with Michael Crichton's monster adventure 
Jurassic Park (1993) or Thomas Keneally's Holocaust drama Schindler's List 
(1993), Steven Spielberg has been adept at translating novels onto 
the screen—and none with greater effect than his first hit movie, an 
adaptation of Peter Benchley's Jaws.
Essentially a piece of pulp fiction about a killer shark terrorizing the 
East Coast resort of Amity Island, Spielberg (with the help of a lot of 
studio marketing money) created the first big summer "event" movie. 
Word of mouth was built up by advertising before the film was even 
released, and lines grew around the block once the movie came out and 
people saw it, told their friends, and then went to see it again.
One of the many joys of this adventure thriller is the cast. Roy 
Scheider is perfect as the Amity cop who first realizes that chewed torsos 
washing up on the local beach may be a good reason to keep bathers 
out of the water, but who fails to convince the mayor that there is 
anything to worry about. Luckily he has expert Matt Hooper (Richard 
Dreyfuss) and old sea dog Quint (the wonderful Robert Shaw) on his 
side, and soon it's three men against the aquatic munching machine, 
leading to a Captain Ahab/Moby Dick-style showdown that's just as 
tense the tenth time you watch it as the first.
It's Spielberg, of course, who deserves the credit for being the man 
who made a whole generation of people think twice before dipping 
their big toe in the sea. Playing on our fear of the unknown, he builds up 
the tension by slowly revealing the shark to the strains of John Williams's 
unforgettable score, partly to keep us on the edge of our seats and partly 
because he knew the rubber shark (named Bruce) used in the film 
looked more like the real thing the less we saw of it. His Hitchcockian 
sleights of hand clearly worked, as this cleverly scripted (by Benchley 
and Carl Gottlieb, while Shaw's infamous "Indianapolis" speech has 
been attributed to John Milius), tautly directed tale remains the scariest 
ocean-set movie ever made.  JB

An adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel of the same name, Nicholas 
Roeg's 1976 science-fiction story was and is often misunderstood. 
Directed in Roeg's trademark nervy style, The Man Who Fell to Earth is a 
visually challenging tale of an alien's doomed visit to our planet. Told in 
cross-edits with unexplained chronological and location jumps, this 
ultrasophisticated take on American culture, love, and homesickness was 
also a major technical achievement.
Early on, Peter O'Toole was considered for the role of the alien Thomas 
Jerome Newton, but the part ultimately went to David Bowie, an 
internationally renowned pop star with limited acting experience. 
Newton comes to earth seeking water for his dying world, and along 
the way becomes immensely wealthy by introducing lucrative new 
technologies to our world. Newton falls prey to human vices, alcohol in 
particular, and to human pursuers; his mission fails, the years roll away, 
and the vulnerable alien is milked for his advanced technical knowledge 
and then abandoned.
The later success of Memento (2000) and Mulholland Dr. (2001), two 
films that similarly displace time and place, show that The Man Who Fell 
to Earth was not only ahead of its time but also ahead of its audience.  KK

The ultimate in investigative journalism pictures, the scoop of the 
century—as written by William Goldman and directed by Alan J. Pakula—
continually pleases for the entertaining intelligence at work. It is among 
the most gripping, deft, and utterly compelling of thrillers, and this despite 
being based on well-known facts whose conclusion is never in doubt.
Following a break-in at the Watergate complex, Washington Post 
newspaper reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) attends the low-
key arraignment of the burglars and sniffs a mystery. Defying men in the 
corridors of power, with the support of editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards, 
winning the first of his two consecutive Oscars) and the melodramatic 
tipster Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook), Woodward and his thrusting colleague 
Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) doggedly get the goods on dirty tricks 
electioneering and its shameful cover-up conspiracy, ultimately leading 
them all the way to the White House and the ignominious resignation of 
President Richard Nixon. A satirist couldn't have concocted better villains 
than CREEP (The Committee to Re-Elect the President) and its schemers 
in this sorry story turned into a hopeful, heroic crusade, the real 
Woodward and Bernstein benefiting ever after from their identification 
with the decidedly more lustrous Redford and Hoffman.  AE

The Outlaw Josey Wales  Clint Eastwood, 1976
A truly great Western, and probably director-star Clint Eastwood's all-
round best picture. Josey Wales is the typical Eastwood character—a 
scarred, vengeance-crazed, super-skilled die-hard gunman who refuses 
to surrender after the Civil War is over and heads for Texas with hordes 
of scurvy bounty killers on his trail. Though the film racks up a genocidal 
body count as Josey guns down assorted human filth, it develops a 
surprising warm streak as the grim hero gradually loses his loner status 
by collecting a retinue of waifs and strays who finally form a community 
in the West that enables him to set aside his guns and settle down.
The most moving moment in The Outlaw Josey Wales comes when 
Josey faces an Indian chief (Will Sampson) set on massacring him, and—
delivering the longest speech Eastwood has ever learned—makes a 
plea to set aside murder and get on with life. This speech not only 
constitutes a personal change on the part of Eastwood the star but also 
represents a major turning point in the Western genre as a whole. 
Chief Dan George is wonderful as the hero's wry Indian sidekick, and 
even the often irritating Sondra Locke is winning as a pioneer lass. 
Unforgiven (1992), in which a reformed Clint becomes a killer again, is a 
despairing thematic sequel.  KN

The Killing of a Chinese Bookie  
John Cassavetes, 1976
John Cassavetes's first crime thriller, a postnoir masterpiece, failed 
miserably at the box office when first released, and a recut, shorter 
version released two years later didn't fare much better. The first, longer, 
and in some ways better of the two versions is easier to follow, despite 
reports that—or maybe because—Cassavetes had less to do with the 
editing (though he certainly approved it). A personal, deeply felt 
character study rather than a routine action picture, The Killing of a 
Chinese Bookie follows Cosmo Vitelli (Ben Gazzara at his best), the 
charismatic owner of an Los Angeles strip joint—simultaneously a jerk 
and a saint—who recklessly gambles his way into debt and has to bump 
off a Chinese bookie to settle his accounts.
In many respects the film serves as a personal testament. What 
makes the tragicomic character of Cosmo so moving is its alter-ego 
relation to the filmmaker—the proud impresario and father figure of a 
tattered showbiz collective (read Cassavetes's actors and filmmaking 
crew) who must compromise his ethics to keep his little family afloat 
(read Cassavetes's career as a Hollywood actor). Peter Bogdanovich used 
Gazzara in a similar part in Saint Jack (1979), but as good as that film 
is, it doesn't catch the exquisite warmth and delicacy of feeling of 
Cassavetes's doom-ridden comedy drama.  JRos

Do television producers and executives bear any responsibility to the 
millions of people glued to the boob tube, or are they merely beholden 
to the bottom line? Sidney Lumet's cynical treatise on the moral and 
ethical decline of television hinges on the somewhat naive belief that 
things were ever run differently. Even so, Network remains a biting satire 
of the lurid lengths television will go to appease its corporate overseers 
as well as the complicity of its vast, passive viewership.
In Network, ratings rule, and vice president of programming Diana 
Christensen (Faye Dunaway) will do anything to boost the numbers. That 
anything includes putting the messianic blathering of a suicidal Howard 
Beale (Peter Finch, subsequently the first posthumous recipient of an 
Academy Award for acting) on prime time, despite the delusional bent 
of his paranoid rants. His line, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to 
take it anymore," becomes his mantra and the mantra of his audience, 
yet Christensen doesn't see the danger of her runaway success. Max 
Schumacher (William Holden), head of the nightly news, does, and he 
grows increasingly disaffected when he sees what Christensen and fellow 
executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) are doing to his profession.
Network could have come across as hypocritical and patronizing had 
Sidney Lumet and writer Paddy Chayefsky not done such a sharp job of 
depicting the world of television as a particularly sleazy and destructive 
social parasite. They keep the bitter, desperate acts and darkly comic 
perversities coming at such a brisk clip that you barely realize the film is 
a damning portrayal of not just the television providers but us, the 
compulsive television viewers. It's enough to make you want to unplug 
your set and toss it out into the street, but one of the film's major points 
is that we can't. The sensationalism and tawdriness of TV is exactly 
what keeps us coming back to it: it's all about the numbers, which is 
what we are.  JKl

Carrie  Brian De Palma, 1976
By the mid-1970s, Brian De Palma had already spent over a decade 
honing his diverse influences, including Alfred Hitchcock, rock music, 
and political satire. But Carrie marked his breakthrough. It is an operatic 
horror melodrama blending the family gothic, supernaturalism, and teen 
movie. It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.
The film inaugurated De Palma's penchant for surprise switches 
between fantasy and reality, as in the opening, which segues from a 
soft-core porn fantasia of girls showering to the fact of Carrie's 
menstruation—the first sign of "otherness" that will set her apart as a 
monster from her small-minded community.
All the oppression that Carrie suffers both at home (with her religious 
fanatic mother played by Piper Laurie) and at school creates a smoldering 
tension that takes the form of telekinetic power. We watch with 
ambivalence as Carrie's revenge fantasies cross the line into uncontrolled 
mass murder in the climactic prom scene (a De Palma tour de force).
Sissy Spacek is astonishing in the title role. Her face and body contort 
like a living special effect to express the unbearable contradictions of 
Carrie's experience, as well as the character's startling passage from 
wallflower to Queen of Death.  AM

Taxi Driver  Martin Scorsese, 1976
"Some day a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the street." So 
mutters tormented taxi driver malcontent Travis Bickle, played with 
maximum intensity by Robert De Niro in the first of his lauded lead turns 
for Martin Scorsese. Bickle's job shuttling back and forth across New York 
City—"anytime, anywhere," he boasts—provides him an insomniac's view 
of the city's underbelly, all those things on dark backstreets that most 
people never witness. But he's become so inured to the world around 
him that he feels numb, invisible, and ultimately impotent. 
Yet Bickle is not so much outraged at the signs of social and physical 
decay around him as he is frustrated that he no longer knows anything 
else. He's also conflicted, attracted to the very things he purports to 
despise. Sick of himself and what he sees, he embarks on a final, desperate 
quest to reintegrate himself into society. But in Paul Schrader's bleak, 
hell-on-earth script, there's no way out. Bickle is already too far gone.
Bickle's descent is at first painful to watch, then nerve-racking and 
ultimately pitiful. He begins by wooing beautiful campaign aid Betsy 
(Cybill Shepherd), and when his awkward romantic advances are 
inevitably rebuffed, his alienation grows more intense. After trying to 
rejoin society, Bickle's next goal is to destroy it, beginning with the 
planned assassination of a popular presidential candidate. When this 
plan also fails he then tries to redeem society, with the suicide-mission 
rescue of an underage prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her abusive pimp.
Portraits of urban malaise and anomie don't come any darker, bleaker, 
or more claustrophobic than Taxi Driver. The film has some noirish 
elements—Bickle's voice-over, Bernard Herrmann's haunting, jazzy 
score—but veers sharply when it comes to the actual storytelling. 
Taxi Driver proceeds like a film noir told from the perspective of an 
anonymous stranger standing at the corner of a murder scene, peering 
over the police tape at the shrouded body splayed out on the street. 
What's going through that person's head? How will he react when 
confronted with such a vivid display of violence?
Scorsese, Schrader, and De Niro seem to be asking that of us as well. 
For the film's duration we're stuck viewing the city from Bickle's relentlessly 
isolated perspective, with few peripheral glimmers of hope taking us out 
of his deranged head. He's Dostoyevsky's Underground Man surfacing 
with a gun and a death wish, a vigilante antihero with a hands-on 
approach to cleaning up the city. "Here is a man who would not take it 
anymore," he announces triumphantly. "A man who stood up against the 
scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up."
But is this what we want? In an ironic ends-justifying-the-means twist, 
Bickle is ultimately praised as a crusading hero, and it's hard to say if 
Bickle's inadvertent triumph is actually a tragedy. Because the film has 
done such a successful job wobbling the moral compass, we're left 
desperately grappling for impossible answers.  JKl

Short on brains, long on brawn—and heart. John G. Avildsen's Rocky 
catapulted the floundering career of Sylvester Stallone into the stratosphere. 
At the same time, it reaped unprecedented box-office sales, established 
a movie franchise, and landed a one-two punch of jock stereotypes as 
rich with caricature today as they were riveting performances in 1976.
The story centers on Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer beyond his 
prime. He falls in love with Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his friend 
Paulie (Burt Young), and then works to earn the respect of his trainer 
Mickey (Burgess Meredith). On the receiving end of a publicity stunt, he 
eventually gets a chance to unseat Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the 
heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
Scored with Bill Conti's pulsing trumpet blasts and percussive rumble, 
Rocky is an immensely entertaining drama about struggling for satisfaction 
in an indifferent world. As the combined story work of former Muhammad 
Ali opponent Chuck Wepner and "Italian Stallion" Sylvester Stallone, the 
now famous actor-writer proved versatile and tenacious. Writing the 
script, he connected its sale to his participation in the lead role, despite 
being virtually unknown at the time. Desperate or inspired bid, he hit a 
grand slam and became one of Hollywood's biggest superstars.
The film is often overlooked as schmaltz, especially considering 
Stallone's subsequent career, yet Rocky lovingly details the white working 
class. Rocky, Paulie, Adrian, and Mickey respectively work as a debt 
collector, meat packer, pet store clerk, and gym proprietor; the only 
upward mobility each has are wishes and dreams. This "biopic" returns 
to a world of folklore where underdogs get their well-deserved chance 
after working hard.
Important in Rocky are the values of honor and courage, so often 
questioned in movies throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
Such reassurance was well received, if gross receipts are any indication, 
and Avildsen's film walked off with Best Picture honors at the Academy 
Awards to make it one for the record books.  GC-Q

Ai no corrida  Nagisa Oshima, 1976
In the Realm of the Senses
Japan, 1936. A young prostitute, Sada (Eiko Matsuda), begins an affair 
with Kichi-zo (Tatsuya Fuji), the husband of the brothel madam. The 
relationship is intense and highly physical. They have sex in a series of 
explicit scenes, often watched by third parties: geishas, serving women, 
other prostitutes. They play sex games, Sada putting items of food in her 
vagina before feeding them to her lover, and encouraging Kichi-zo to 
have sex with other partners, including an old woman who comes to 
sing for them. But Sada eventually grows jealous of Kichi-zo's continuing 
sexual relations with his wife, and threatens to cut off his penis. They 
begin to play asphyxiation games during sexual intercourse, and at last, 
with his encouragement, Sada strangles her lover, then castrates him.
Oshima's film achieves an extraordinary level of erotic intimacy and 
physical frankness. For the first time in a picture not intended for the 
pornographic circuit there are frequent shots of the erect male penis 
and scenes of fellatio. But Oshima also manages to convince us that this 
story of crazy love (amour fou) is a true manifestation of passion, taken 
to the ultimate extreme. The elegance of the director's mise-en-scène is 
a cool counterpoint to the sexual frenzy of the lovers.  EB

Voskhozhdeniye  Larisa Shepitko, 1977
Ascent
In 1942, Russian partisans and peasants run afoul of German invaders 
and Russian collaborators. The style Lariso Shepitko adopts for Ascent 
seems at first harsh, unadorned, and off-putting: flat lighting, shallow 
focus, jarring rhythms. Much of the action takes place in snowy 
landscapes in which the characters are relentlessly exposed and overlit. 
The visual flatness matches Shepitko's approach to the characters, who 
are less introduced than thrust before us. Although it attends to the 
details of faces and captures with special vividness the nervous 
expressiveness of eyes, the film avoids psychological depth in its 
characterizations. The three main characters exist less as fully realized 
individuals than as the starkly drawn symbolic figures of a morality play: 
the intellectual, self-sacrificing partisan Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov); his 
frightened, wavering comrade (Vladimir Gostyukhin); and their Satanic 
interrogator (played by Tarkovsky regular Anatoli Solonitsyn).
The intensity of Shepitko's film, which culminates in a feverish and 
protracted calvary, is heightened through elemental imagery (fire, snow, 
steam, wood, metal), Alfred Shnitke's shimmering, harrowing score, and 
Vladimir Chukhnov's lighting, which etherealizes an experience that 
would otherwise have been oppressive and hopeless. Ascent is one of 
the most powerful of all films that have war as their background.  CFu

A sci-fi mystery in which an Everyman's search for its meaning climaxes 
in contact with extraterrestrials, Close Encounters incorporates themes 
that recur throughout Steven Spielberg's work. There are his staple 
characters (the individual on a quest, sympathetic mother, lost boy, and 
untrustworthy authorities), and a transforming experience. There are 
rescue, redemption, and affirmation of an individual's worth. Take away 
the spectacular special effects, and what remains is a compassionate 
human story of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.
Richard Dreyfuss's appealing Roy Neary is Joe Six-Pack having an 
epiphany. When his UFO encounter is dismissed he becomes obsessed 
with discovering what his experience means, alienating his family in the 
process. The only person who understands is Melinda Dillon's Jillian 
Guiler, driven by her own search for her son (Cary Guffey), who was taken 
in a terrifying visitation at her home. It becomes clear they are among 
"implantees" privileged with a shared connection. Parallel with these 
intimate experiences of frustration and fear of the unknown, of courage 
and joy in confronting it (and finding something wonderful in the 
childlike aliens), are the efforts of François Truffaut's hopeful Claude 
Lacombe, head of the project to investigate and respond to alien contact.
Close Encounters shows all the sensibilities of the suburban baby 
boomer nurtured on Disney and 1950s sci-fi, and was indeed an adult, 
professional rethink of Spielberg's adolescent, homemade epic, Firelight 
(1964). While E.T. (1982) may be even more revealing of his psyche, Close 
Encounters is a definitive Spielberg film in both style and substance. It is 
also one he can't leave alone, reediting it into the 1980 Special Edition 
(tightened middle section of Neary's crisis, extended alien climax) and 
the 1997 Collector's Edition (digitally remastered, snippets reinstated, 
the unnecessary "afterthought" sequence inside the mothership deleted).
Released six months after his friend George Lucas's Star Wars (1977), 
Close Encounters was another instantly iconic event film. The five-tone 
musical motif by John Williams and the mashed potato mountain both 
entered popular culture, and the collective gasp of awe at the mothership 
serves as yet another testimonial to Spielberg's gift for wonder.  AE

Where Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) appears to be about 
man's adversarial relationship with nature, the director's enigmatic The 
Last Wave seems to be about man's symbiotic relationship with nature. 
Richard Chamberlain—enlisted to boost the Australian film's fortunes in 
the U.S.—plays attorney David Burton, hired to defend an Aborigine 
accused of murder. The problem is, no one will talk about the murder, 
and Burton begins to believe that something more mysterious (and 
possibly nefarious) is at work. The murder may have been an Aborigine 
ritual, strange weather formations are befalling Sydney, and Burton is 
beset by frightening visions of an impending apocalypse. As his physical 
and spiritual journey takes him deeper into the realm of the mystical and 
the feeling of impending doom weighs heavier and heavier on his 
subconscious, Chamberlain begins to lose faith in reality.
Weir plays The Last Wave (titled Black Rain in the U.S.) as a detective 
story steeped in the mythology of the Aborigines, whose profound (and 
perhaps supernatural) relationship with the land precedes and exceeds 
the laws and rules of the Anglo civilization around them. Increasing the 
tension with a hallucinatory intensity, Weir seems intent on leaving us 
as confused as his protagonist, leading to a perplexing conclusion that 
may or may not belie everything we have been made to believe.  JKl

Star Wars  George Lucas, 1977
Writer-director George Lucas's film was not expected to be a success. 
Studio bosses were so convinced the movie—a "sci-fi Western" with a 
virtually unknown principal cast (Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie 
Fisher)—would flop that they happily gave Lucas the merchandising 
rights to any Star Wars products for free. They obviously never expected 
that it would lead to two sequels, three prequels, an Ewok spin-off, 
cartoons, computer games, toys, soundtracks, books, huge video and 
DVD sales, clothes, bed linen, and even food. (And innumerable parodies, 
notably three Star Wars-specific editions of the cartoon Family Guy.)
The movie cost $11 million, and went on to make over $460 million, 
but probably didn't sound like a potential blockbuster, let alone one of 
the most successful films ever made. After the death of the aunt and 
uncle who raised him, the headstrong young Luke Skywalker (Hamill) 
teams up with an old Jedi Knight, Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi (Alec Guinness), 
two creaky robots, a cocky spaceship pilot named Han Solo (a star-making 
performance from Ford), and Solo's furry Wookie pal Chewbacca (Peter 
Mayhew) to rescue a princess (Fisher) from an evil guy wearing robes 
and a big plastic helmet. Star Wars could have turned out a bit silly. (Even 
Lucas was plagued by doubt. "George came back from Star Wars a nervous 
wreck," recalled friend Steven Spielberg. He didn't feel [it] came up to the 
vision he initially had. He felt he had just made this little kids' movie.")
But Lucas had big dreams. A couple of decades before computer-
generated images could be used to create fantastical worlds and distant 
planets, the visionary director—using incredibly detailed models, clever 
photography, and well-chosen locations—tells the story of another 
universe. In it, the evil Empire—led by Darth Vader (David Prowse, with 
voice supplied by James Earl Jones)—rules, but rebel forces are gathering 
to bring down the bad guys.
Lucas created a mythology that has been embraced by young and 
old alike. As well as creating various creatures from his galaxy far, far 
away, his good-versus-evil storyline introduces us to people, phrases, 
and concepts that have since become part of the English language: the 
Millennium Falcon (Solo's spaceship, which Lucas originally imagined 
would look like a flying hamburger), light sabers (the swordlike weapon 
with its own recognizable "swoosh" sound), Imperial Stormtroopers, "May 
the Force be with you," and, of course, the Jedi Knights (now so much a 
part of our collective consciousness that an online campaign suggesting 
people enter "Jedi" under the religion section of a United Kingdom census 
form proved hugely successful).
In giving the world Star Wars, Lucas succeeded in making much more 
than just a movie (one that would eventually get its own exhibit at the 
Smithsonian, no less). He made a world, a new style of cinema, and an 
unforgettable outer space opera that has been many times imitated but 
never bettered. And you never can see the strings.  JB

In 1974, German director Werner Herzog made The Enigma of Kaspar 
Hauser, based on the nineteenth-century case of a man suddenly thrust 
into the world after years living in a cell. In the lead he cast Bruno S., 
a street musician and real-life social outsider who—with his strange 
tics and oddly histrionic speech rhythms—proved an inspired choice. 
If Kaspar Hauser felt like an indirect portrait of Bruno S., that is 
even more true of Stroszek, in which he plays a street musician and 
drinker newly released from prison. Finding German life unmanageably 
brutal, he teams up with a prostitute (Eva Mattes) and a borderline-crazy 
father figure (Clemens Scheitz). Together they set out for a new life in 
America, but end up in a barren, banal nowhere. Inevitably ending 
up alone and at bay, Bruno stages an elaborate gesture of despair. The 
final sequence—involving a ski lift, a pick-up truck, and a colony of 
performing animals in a roadside attraction—is one of the most savage 
and unforgiving endings on film.
Herzog's 1970s films are often lyrical, steeped in mystical German 
romanticism. Stroszek is a stark exception. This is a brutally lucid view 
of the dream of freedom; America is entirely stripped of mystique, 
presented as a spiritual wasteland and a trap for the unwary. And the 
final image of the chicken, dancing manically to a cacophony of 
harmonica and hillbilly whooping, is as unbearably cruel an image of 
the human condition—obsessive and out of control—as any filmmaker 
has asked an audience to watch. (The crew disliked it so much that 
Herzog filmed it singlehanded.)
What makes the picture phenomenal, however, is the way Bruno S. 
commands the screen, with indomitable charm and verve. In the role of 
holy fool, he embodies one of the distinctively strange intelligences of 
modern cinema. Its naturalistic approach and minor-key subject matter 
mean Stroszek is less celebrated than Herzog's great visionary follies of 
the 1970s—but it is among his best films and certainly one of the most 
unpitying dramas ever made about Europe's dreams of America.  JRom

Ceddo  Ousmane Sembene, 1977
615
In Ousmane Sembene's complex meditation on African history, the king 
of an African nation has converted to Islam, while members of the warrior 
class (the ceddo) retain the traditional religion. In protest at the religious 
constraints they are made to endure, a ceddo kidnaps the monarch's 
daughter. Successive men try and fail to rescue her, until civil war erupts.
Limpid, elegant, and direct, the film eliminates inessentials, showing 
people only as they appear while engaging in acts and debates of 
high political importance, establishing an equivalence between speech 
and action. In scenes of ritualized council meetings in public spaces, 
Sembene presents arguments, counter-arguments, and accusations 
through contrasting styles of speech and movement (the sour imam and 
his followers with their rote formulae and the king's childhood friend 
with his springy, expressive hand gestures).
Sembene's use of African-American spirituals, one of his most daring 
and brilliant strokes, widens the film's context to include the African 
diaspora and the future of the villagers, whom we see herded together 
and branded with a hot iron, waiting to be transported to slavery. 
Intercutting these scenes with the main narrative, Ceddo establishes a 
scathing tone and a crisp, intellectual atmosphere all its own.  CFu
Der Amerikanische Freund  Wim Wenders, 1977
The American Friend
A brilliant adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1974 novel Ripley's Game 
and one of the most eloquent expressions of Wim Wenders's existential 
universe, The American Friend casts Dennis Hopper as an American 
expatriate in Europe, luring a Hamburg picture framer (Bruno Ganz) 
who has a possibly fatal illness into committing a murder. The financial 
reward will help out the man's wife and son.
The film works effectively as a thriller, with the muted expressionist 
colors of Robby Müller's wondrous camerawork and Jürgen Knieper's 
subtly urgent score contributing to the air of paranoid suspense. But it 
is also a marvelously astute psychological study, deftly delineating the 
fear, envy, wariness, and finally friendship that defines the relationship 
between the two men, each doomed in different ways. (Hopper himself 
was still two years away from a career-reviving turn in Apocalypse Now.)
Typically for Wenders at this highly productive stage in his career, the 
movie also speaks volumes about the symbiotic but troubled cultural 
relationship between America and Europe. In some respects similar to a 
Jean-Pierre Melville film in its juxtaposition of Hollywood and European 
art-movie tropes and motifs, The American Friend pays tribute to those 
traditions with pleasing cameos by U.S. directors Nicholas Ray and 
Samuel Fuller, and Frenchmen Jean Eustache and Gérard Blain.  GA

Annie Hall  Woody Allen, 1977
Woody Allen's most celebrated film began when the director and his 
cowriter Marshall Brickman embarked on a comedy set in Allen's mind, 
with flashbacks to the main male character's previous marriages and 
childhood crushes, and the addition of a murder mystery. It was reshaped 
in development and production, with casualties including the removal 
of a scene featuring an eleven-year-old Brooke Shields. This streamlined 
version—now focused on the romance between Alvy, a neurotic, over-
sexed comedian (played, inevitably, by Allen) and the eponymous Annie 
Hall (Diane Keaton)—was a modern screwball comedy colored with 
doubt, indecision, and pop psychology.
Nominated for five Academy Awards, the film won four, including 
Best Picture of 1978, and was a critical and commercial hit. In fact, Annie 
Hall's popularity was so great that parts of the dialogue lodged in the 
vernacular; some years had to pass before spiders were not typically 
described by ordinary people as being "the size of a Buick." It was the 
director's coming of age: a film that marked a turning point in his career 
as well as the way his talent was perceived. Until then, Allen's work 
comprised pure comedies like Bananas (1971) and Sleeper (1973). While 
both are still extremely funny, neither has the emotional resonance or 
the zeitgeist-catching relevance of Annie Hall.
After a surreal, and severely edited, opening monologue, the story 
begins on a street in New York City, as Alvy and his friend Rob (Tony 
Roberts) reflect on the nature of life. Rob brought Annie into Alvy's life 
via a tennis match where Alvy's main concern was being allowed into 
the club because he was Jewish. (Allen insists that the character of Alvy 
is nonautobiographical, but the similarities between Alvy and Allen are 
too many to be coincidental; as well as the fact that Keaton, his former 
girlfriend, was born Diane Hall and nicknamed Annie.) 
The film then becomes the story of Annie and Alvy's affair, weaving 
in stand-up comedy, postmodern pieces to camera, Jewish humor, 
barbed observations about sex, love, and the differences between New 
York and Los Angeles, and a very funny scene with lobsters. Arguably 
Allen's most honest film, it is also (ironically, given its theme of emotional 
immaturity), his most emotionally mature one.
Originally titled Anhedonia (the incapacity for pleasure), the film was 
changed to Annie Hall only after several test screenings. There was no 
sequel, but aspects of its original storyline and the pairing of Keaton and 
Allen were echoed in the director's Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). 
Annie Hall is also notable for early acting appearances from Jeff 
Goldblum, Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Paul Simon, and (in a 
nonspeaking role at the end) Sigourney Weaver. More bizarrely, author 
Truman Capote and philosopher Marshall McLuhan make appearances. 
The former plays "a Truman Capote look-alike," and the latter was a last-
minute (and reluctantly made) substitution for Federico Fellini.  KK

Suspiria begins as if it were an Italian giallo (pulp thriller): a series of 
spectacular murders staged with the baroque quality of a musical. But 
director Dario Argento soon switches gears, revealing a world not of 
masked or gloved human killers, but of supernatural forces, black magic, 
and malignant witches. ("I went all round Europe trying to find witches 
and sorceresses," he told Bizarre. "But they're not so easy to find.")
However, Suspiria is not only a late-ish entry in a European horror 
subgenre. It is also a product of the stylistic influence of Argento's 
mentor, Mario Bava, a pioneer in multiple Italian genres whose highly 
visual effects were created with amazing intelligence and economy. 
Perhaps the most enduring legacy of Bava's style was a relentless 
tracking shot that Argento makes outrageously his own, and which now, 
thanks to directors ranging from Martin Scorsese to Sam Raimi, has 
become a basic part of contemporary film language.
Suspiria takes place in a classically gothic setting—an old dance 
academy. The true nature of the instruction offered there is revealed in 
a rain of maggots that showers the girls one evening. In this pure gross-
out lies a kind of key, as the big, spectacular scenes themselves become 
tests of endurance. While the audience and the student-protagonist, 
Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper), are drawn along by traces of mysterious 
and esoteric revelations, the intense array of audiovisual shocks and 
effects teeter on the very edge of unbearableness. This is the texture of 
the whole film, not only in its grand surreal deaths but even its smallest 
gestures, as when a malevolent dance instructor pours water straight 
into Susy's mouth, the heavy glass pitcher rattling against her teeth.
Argento's film stands out for the sheer intensity of watching—and 
hearing—it, the latter due to an almost overpowering score by the 
director and the Italian rock group Goblin. From beginning to end, this 
is a nightmarish fairy tale, culminating in a grotesque confrontation with 
the hideous elder of a witches coven. Finally, Suspiria reveals the horror 
film to be a kind of initiation ritual for protagonist and spectator alike—
the horror genre itself as a kind of secular mystery religion.  AS

Last Chants for a Slow Dance  Jon Jost, 1977
Before indie cinema made a fetish of serial killers, shattered masculinity, 
long takes, and songs-as-commentary, Last Chants for a Slow Dance, 
handmade on a ridiculously small budget, culminated in an endless shot 
of a murderer driving down a highway to the haunting "Fixin' to Die."
The images, the cuts, even the song and its performance, come from 
Jon Jost. Last Chants inaugurated the "Tom Blair" trilogy (named after the 
astonishing lead actor) and, with Sure Fire (1990) and The Bed You Sleep 
In (1993), created a milestone of contemporary American cinema.
Last Chants is a despairing document of social breakdown: Its antihero 
wanders through the landscape raving, screwing, and killing. Jost weaves 
an avant-garde structure around his actions, which renders them both 
fascinating and horrifying. The film eschews easy spectacle but still goes 
to extremes—the slaughter of an animal, for instance, standing in for 
the killer's equally indifferent disposal of human life.
Loosely inspired by the Gary Gilmore case, the film takes pride of 
place—alongside John McNaughton's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 
(1990)—among cinema's most intelligent explorations of a difficult 
subject. Its distancing effects—color filters, words printed on-screen, 
stretched-out durations—push us not to judge but to understand an 
American culture nurtured on aggression, violence, and the hateful 
exclusion of anyone "other." The best index of its ambivalent sensitivity 
to the real world it traverses are its songs, simultaneously soulful and 
ironic ("Hank Williams wrote it long ago," runs one chorus).  AM

Set one day in the future, this political thriller details how a democratic 
state can slip into autocracy, via the gradual erosion of individual rights 
and personal freedom. Sam Neill plays Smith, an ordinary citizen who, 
following the breakdown of his marriage, chooses to pursue a solitary 
life in the country. Mistaken for a terrorist, he is arrested, escapes, and 
becomes involved with an underground movement. But state forces, too 
powerful and all pervasive, soon catch up with him.
Neill's charisma makes an ambiguous and unmotivated character 
more appealing than he should be. In fact, no one in the film is likable
—especially Warren Oates's U.S. officer, brought in to bolster the state's 
strength (and to support the filmmakers' view of American imperialism 
overseas; Vietnam had only recently come to an end). Jack Nicholson 
was the producer's first choice, but his agent laughed at the amount on 
offer. Oates is better. His character is tired and seems unconvinced of the 
role he has to play, preferring the pleasures of women and alcohol.

Czlowiek z marmuru  Andrzej Wajda, 1977
Man of Marble
One of the best movies ever made in Poland, Man of Marble is also an 
important testimony to the power of cinema. Recalling the puzzling 
structure of Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), it concerns an ambitious 
film student, Agnieszka (the remarkably convincing Krystyna Janda). 
Her diploma film is dedicated to a forgotten "worker-hero of the state" 
of the 1950s, bricklayer Birkut (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), transformed by the 
communist propaganda machine into a national myth. Despite her 
difficulties tracking down the witnesses of Birkut's "sanctification" two 
decades later, the stubborn young woman manages to meet with some 
of them and gets them to talk about the naive worker.
It turns out that after being victimized by an act of sabotage, when 
someone placed a burning brick in his hands, the young Birkut lost his 
innocence. Realizing just how cynical was the idea of having been turned 
into a legend, he began to experience an awakening of social conscience, 
though not in the revolutionary sense. After starting to ask the authorities 
challenging questions, Birkut was eliminated. This is the conclusion 
suggested by the movie's finale (though it was censured)—a daring 
exposé of the communist state's tendency to "devour its beloved sons."
In the course of her investigations, Agnieszka meets Jerzy Burski 
(Tadeusz Lomnicki), a film director who participated in the creation of 
Birkut's heroic image: fragments of his "documentaries" are important 
pieces in the narrative puzzle. Andrzej Wajda depicts with admiration 
the young woman's battle, convincing us that it is the filmmaker's duty 
to reveal the truth. This moral upshot to the story intensifies the film's 
importance, as was the case with Wajda's 1969 film, Wszystko na sprzedaz 
(Everything for Sale), a parable about truth and falsity in the cinema.
A meditation on cinema, Man of Marble is also is a complex depiction 
of a horrid period in the history of its country. It also anticipated social 
change, portraying the beginning of an implacable process: the fall of 
communism. The film's sequel, Man of Iron (1981), focuses on the workers' 
strikes in Gdansk and other Polish cities in 1980, casting the excellent 
Radziwilowicz once again, now in the role of Birkut's son.
Man of Marble consolidated Wajda's international status, sometimes 
unjustly judged as "academic." Together with Krzysztof Kielsowski and 
Krzysztof Zanussi, he became a protagonist of the so-called "cinema of 
moral anxiety," which held an enormous prestige and a subversive 
reputation in Poland. This film also confirms an assertion made by 
another important Polish director, Janusz Zaorski, who noted near 
the beginning of the 1990s that, "We did our best films against the 
state with the state's money." This paradoxical situation is what allowed 
for the appearance of masterpieces such as Man of Marble. An absolute 
must, especially for those perplexed as to why Wajda was honored with 
a special Oscar in 2000.  DD

Saturday Night Fever  John Badham, 1977
Saturday Night Fever is a movie phenomenon based on a magazine 
article, "Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night," that author Nik Cohn has 
since admitted was fabricated. But whether discos in New York, or 
anywhere else in the world for that matter, were full of young people 
experiencing life, love, and the Hustle before the article came out isn't 
really the point. They took to the floor in droves after the film's success 
helped make disco the dance style of the late 1970s.
John Travolta, previously a TV star in the series Welcome Back, Kotter, 
became the man to mob in the streets after he donned his white suit as 
Brooklyn boy Tony Manero, king of the local dancehall. Backed by the 
infectious Bee Gees song "Stayin' Alive," his opening scene walk down 
the street became the strut to emulate. His dance moves—on which 
Travolta spent so long that he persuaded director John Badham to film his 
whole body rather than in close-up as originally planned—have been 
copied on many a dance floor and parodied in many a movie since.  JB

Killer of Sheep  Charles Burnett, 1977
Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep slid into the world between two popular 
waves of Black American cinema: the blaxploitation period of the early 
to mid-1970s and the Spike Lee-led charge of revitalized Black film of 
the 1980s. Killer of Sheep fits in neither camp, being both more daring 
and more quietly revolutionary than anything from those eras.
Writer-director Burnett anchored his exploration of black American, 
inner-city life on the story of Stan (Henry G. Sanders, "a last-minute 
replacement after my main character failed to get his parole in time," said 
the director), a quiet, unexceptional man who works in a slaughterhouse 
to support his young family. They live in 1970 Watts, Los Angeles, when 
urban struggle wasn't yet synonymous with the soul-crushing despair 
of drugs, drive-by shootings, and an unbreakable cycle of poverty. 
Although the bloody, backbreaking work that Stan does is what gives 
the film its title, the real thrust of the picture is in its nostalgia for a kind 
of innocence that was already fading by the time the film was made in 
the mid-1970s. (Though copyrighted 1977, and garlanded at the Berlin 
International Film Festival in 1981, the film was never widely distributed, 
owing to the expense of clearing rights for songs on the soundtrack.) 
Children play in worn-down yards, making toys out of whatever they 
find; a picnic is planned, and goes hilariously astray; Stan crawls under 
a sink to fix a pipe, and the camera lingers on his soft, curled body. It 
sounds unremarkable, but it's in that simplicity that the film sings.
Shot in raw black-and-white stock that imbues it with a gilded grace, 
Killer of Sheep is astonishing for being an American film in which black 
characters are not metaphors for something or someone else. They're 
not simply some variation of stereotype, or merely passive victims of or 
snarling reactors to racism, class struggle, or the crush of American life. 
Burnett's camera pierces behind facades and public personas of 
American blackness to show the human beings beneath them. He paces 
the film leisurely so that we get to linger on faces and expressions. He 
captures intimacy—between husband and wife, parent and child, and 
friends—with a documentarian's skill, so we feel as if we are privy to 
secrets, to sides of a black self that are not often displayed in cinema.
So much film about African-Americans is filtered through both a 
horrible real-life history and an insidiously racist film industry that what 
is produced, more often than not, is ciphers with attitude who swagger, 
make wisecracks, and gun blast through one contrived scene after 
another. Burnett slows things down, peels back layers, creates settings 
that are purposefully banal, and illuminates the spirit behind the flesh 
and bone. He takes your breath away by not trying to take your breath 
away, by not trying to dazzle or overwhelm the viewer with a weighty 
political treatise—and yet his film is an example of the most radical, 
subversive art. It forces you to question all else you've seen or heard 
about blackness; it forces you to see and hear in all new ways.  EH

Eraserhead  David Lynch, 1977
The remarkable product of more than five years' worth of intermittent 
shooting and postproduction editing, Eraserhead was David Lynch's 
feature debut after several promising but rarely seen shorts. A popular 
"midnight movie" and cult film phenomenon, this "dream of dark and 
troubling things," as Lynch described it, assured a passionate fan base 
for the budding auteur. It anticipated the remarkable visuals of The 
Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984), and Wild at Heart (1990), as well as the 
twisting, twisted narratives of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), Lost 
Highway (1997), and Mulholland Drive. (2001).
With its unconventional plot, postindustrial wasteland setting, and 
black-and-white imagery seemingly extracted from the subconscious of 
a neurotic nebbish, Eraserhead has been compared to the Expressionist 
mise-en-scènes of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), the futuristic urban 
decay of Metropolis (1926), and the absurdist/surrealist dreamscape of 
Un Chien Andalou (1929)—all with some justification, despite Lynch's 
insistence that none of these was a direct influence. Commentators often 
note that the question "What is this movie about?" is misplaced if not 
irrelevant, then argue that, despite its idiosyncracies, Eraserhead is a 
narrative film with dialogue, a protagonist, and a more-or-less linear plot.
This last claim isn't easy to support. Eraserhead opens with a strange-
looking man (Jack Fisk) pulling levers inside a jagged planet, while out 
of the mouth of our floating "hero" Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) appears 
a wormlike creature, perhaps implying conception and birth. Arriving 
at his squalid apartment building, in a desolate urban landscape, a 
neighbor informs him that his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) wants 
him over to her parents' house for dinner. Over a meal that includes a 
miniature hen that hemorrhages blood and moves its legs up and down 
after he sticks a fork in it, Henry learns he's the father of a premature baby 
still at the hospital. Mary moves in with Henry, but leaves when the 
malformed and apparently quadriplegic baby's crying keeps her awake.
The baby, which looks like a cross between an animatronic reptile 
and a calf fetus, becomes increasingly repulsive and disease-ridden. After 
fantasizing about a chipmunk-cheeked blonde singer (Laurel Near) who 
stomps on umbilical worms inside his radiator, and having a one-night 
stand with his seductive neighbor (Judith Anna Roberts), Henry imagines 
his own head popping off—replaced by that of his baby—and taken to 
a factory to be converted into pencil-top erasers. Finally Henry cuts open 
his baby's full-body bandage, killing it and releasing mountains of foamy 
innards in the process. In a blinding flash of white, Henry embraces the 
Lady in the Radiator in what could be the afterlife.
No mere summation of the plot, however, can possibly convey the 
tone (and, indeed, sound) of this unique and challenging film. The 
feelings of unease, even horror, that result from watching it and that only 
increase in intensity on repeated viewings are simply unforgettable.  SJS

Paul Verhoeven's most elaborate Dutch film—and the most spectacular 
and expensive film from Holland at the time—announced themes that 
the director would return to later on when he was working in Hollywood 
(notably in 2006's Black Books).
Soldier of Orange sketches the experiences of a group of Dutch 
students during World War II. Initially reacting with a shrugging "a bit of 
war would be nice," they soon find themselves forced to make choices—
joining the Germans, the resistance movement, or going underground. 
Throughout the film, Erik Lanshof (Rutger Hauer) is at the center of 
things. While others around him are compelled to choose between 
different paths, Erik enjoys the freedom of letting chance make his 
decisions for him, jumping from one adventure to another.
The movie is at its best when it addresses, in minute detail, the social 
issues dominating wartime Holland. Each character is a microcosm of 
Dutch society during the war. They are made human by connecting 
them to real people (among the film's characters is Dutch monarch 
Queen Wilhelmina), but also used as a detailed reflection on how war 
changes people and their opinions—as if the film is asking us not to 
judge but to understand the motives of friend and foe.  EM

The Hills Have Eyes  Wes Craven, 1977
Between his notorious debut The Last House on the Left (1972) and 
supernatural slasher A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Wes Craven's The 
Hills Have Eyes tends to get lost in discussion of America's reigning horror 
auteur. This may be truer today than ever, considering Craven's meteoric 
rise to mainstream respectability with the staggering success of his 
Scream series (1996-2011). A relentless chronicle of violence against and 
within a bourgeois family unit, Hills usually occupies the role of Craven's 
"cult classic"—celebrated by the director's hard core fans, appreciated 
for its low-budget aesthetic, generating semi-ironic readings which 
praise its archetypal allusions as well as its exploitation movie themes. 
Arguably, however, Hills warrants consideration as one of the richest and 
most perfectly realized films of Craven's career.
A structural correspondence is established between two families who 
face off in a battle to the death on the desolate site of a U.S. bomb-testing 
range. In one corner are the suburban middle-class Carters, headed for 
Los Angeles by car but making an unwise detour through the Yucca Flat 
to locate a silver mine willed to Ethel (Virginia Vincent) and her husband 
"Big Bob" (Russ Grieve) by a deceased aunt. In the other corner is a clan 
of scavengers who live in the surrounding hills and are ruled with an iron 
fist by mutated monster-patriarch Jupiter (James Whitworth). These 
cannibalistic guerillas—standing for oppressed and embattled minority/
social/ethnic groups—eke out a squalid existence by using discarded 
army surplus tools and weapons to commit petty thievery.
When their car crashes in the desert, the Carter family reveal their 
ideologically inherited arrogance, repression, and capacity for denial, all 
of which make them prime targets for victimization by their ruthless, 
unscrupulous enemies. Big Bob is crucified and eventually immolated 
by his counterpart Papa Jupiter in a highly symbolic act signifying utter 
repudiation of Judeo-Christian values—values which Big Bob himself 
hypocritically cites in an earlier racist diatribe. Two of Jupiter's sons raid 
the Carter's RV trailer, where they rape younger daughter Brenda (Susan 
Lanier) and murder her sister and mother. Stripped of all pretensions, 
desperate for survival, the remaining members of the Carter clan finally 
find within themselves the courage, craftiness, and rage to kill off their 
enemies. The film closes with a powerful, red-filtered freeze-frame of 
son-in-law Doug (Martin Speer) in full fury, set to stab Jupiter's son Mars 
(Lance Gordon) in the chest—though Mars is surely already dead.
Craven's creativity is especially evident in his mixing and matching 
of genres, including the horror film, the Western, the road movie, and 
the siege film. Stylistically, Craven makes innovative use of shock tactics 
and startle effects to keep the anxiety level high throughout. And the 
varied use of handheld camerawork, masked point-of-view shots, night 
photography, and rapid-fire editing is all endowed with a strong sense 
of purpose, serving to sustain pace and tension in the narrative.  SJS

1978
Terrence Malick is the most unusual member of the generation of 
American directors usually termed the Hollywood Renaissance, with a 
strong interest in visual cinema that recalls the directors of classic 
Hollywood, particularly John Ford, whose fascination with symmetrical 
compositions and landscape vistas Malick shares. His first two feature 
films, Badlands and Days of Heaven, both follow very much in the tradition 
of outlaw couple narratives such as Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde. But 
the crime narrative at the heart of each film—especially the complex love 
triangle in Days of Heaven between Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, and Sam 
Shepard—is hardly what is most memorable. Malick's interest in cinema 
as an intense, pictorial experience, is nowhere better illustrated than in 
this, his third film, which is memorable for its images of 19th-century 
American life. The misery and squalor of Eastern cities overpopulated by 
immigrants contrast with the vast, open spaces of the American prairie, 
the two settings linked by the inescapable fact of social class.
In the East, the upper class is represented impersonally by the factory 
system, but on the prairie, the house of the landowner, who hires workers 
directly and presides over them in the field, dominates the landscape, 
the one visible sign of human industry and wealth. Malick energizes this 
environment by putting a woman in the middle between two men, both 
of whom she loves, with the ultimate tragedy caused by their bitter 
rivalry. Instead of relying on sequences heavy with dialogue to advance 
the story, Malick uses what are essentially silent-film techniques: well-
designed images whose meaning can be fixed, as needed, by a 
memorable voiceover commentary that replaces the earlier device of 
title cards. Here, as in Badlands, the narrator is a female (17-year-old Linda 
Manz), called upon to describe and explain the behavior of men, 
especially their embracing of violence which seems so contrary to their 
better nature. Despite its beauty and pastoral evocation of an 
accommodating environment, Days of Heaven is filled with struggle, 
destruction, and ruminations on the vagaries of the human condition, 
much like the director's more recent The Thin Red Line.  RBP

Halloween  John Carpenter, 1978
No director since Alfred Hitchcock has captured the delicious voyeurism 
of horror as well as John Carpenter in Halloween, a film so entrenched 
with our primordial anxieties that it continues to define the genre several 
decades later. Indeed, the comparison between Hitchcock and Carpenter 
is no stretch; Halloween is saturated with Carpenter's tribute to Hitchcock, 
from character names—Sam Loomis and Tom Doyle, from Psycho (1960) 
and Rear Window (1954), respectively—to the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis, 
daughter of Janet Leigh, the ill-fated shower victim in Psycho.
Halloween's plot is simple enough: a masked psychopath, Michael 
Myers, stabs and strangles his way through a group of teenage friends 
as they drink beer and pursue sexual encounters, until he finally comes 
up against the one pure force in the movie, the virginal babysitter Laurie 
Strode (Curtis). Despite its minimalism, the pronounced societal anxieties 
of Halloween's good-versus-evil plot are left unresolved, a strategy 
repeated consistently in slasher films from Friday the 13th (1980) to 
Scream (1996). The intensity of Carpenter and Debra Hill's screenplay lies 
in situating the terror in the calm visage of suburbia, where one would 
(or at least used to) assume children were safe and sound.
Deconstructing notions of the protective homestead, Halloween's 
camera work violates the fictitious town of Haddonfield with the roving 
point-of-view shot. The film's opening is itself a radiantly executed point-
of-view take, peering through the eyes of the then-six-year-old killer. 
Carpenter constructs a purely aesthetic fear, separating Halloween from 
its own drudgingly expository progeny. Throughout the film, someone 
is always watching, be it predator or prey, and as the film unravels we 
are left to peek around corners, over shoulders, through windows, and 
out of closets at what we are sure is impending doom.
The brilliant pacing and excruciatingly long takes manage to keep 
the adrenaline pumping, as Michael slinks in the shadows, rising from 
death again and again to chase the clever Laurie. In the end, we are left 
to wonder uncomfortably about the thread of separation between fact 
and fiction.  KB

1978

In this elegiac recreation of the lives of Lombardy peasants, Ermanno 
Olmi offers a corrective to the anxiety of his earlier portraits of 
contemporary Italy: The Job (1961), The Fiancés (1962), One Fine Day 
(1968), and The Circumstance (1973). 
Several stories emerge out of the details of the peasants' work and 
communal life: the courtship and marriage of a modest young couple; 
a father cutting down his landlord's tree to make shoes for his son to 
wear on his walk to school; an old man fertilizing tomatoes with chicken 
manure so they'll ripen more quickly. The soft lighting, apparently 
almost entirely from "natural" sources, and, above all, the discrete, 
precise soundtrack give us the sense of assisting at an almost 
unmediated reality. The shortness of shots is a directorial statement, not 
letting us become involved for long in any one activity or point of view, 
allowing the film to expand, calmly, in multiple directions.
In a privileged sequence, a woman prays while walking, fills a wine 
bottle from a stream, and is finally seen silhouetted in the doorway of a 
church. It is here, perhaps (or in the use of Bach at several points of the 
film), that an unsympathetic viewer might accuse Olmi of aestheticism. 
But such criticism would miss the director's point about the positive 
role of religious faith in the peasants' lives. Its restrained treatment of 
this theme makes The Tree of Wooden Clogs one of the most touching 
and compelling of all films about religion.
If the cumulative emotional effect of The Tree of Wooden Clogs is 
close to that of The Fiancés, an earlier Olmi masterpiece set in an 
alienating, modern-day, industrial world, it shows how useless words 
like "humanism" (often invoked in reference to the director) are in trying 
to account for it. The combination of deep uncertainty and fervent 
idealism at the end of The Fiancés is extremely moving. This is also what 
we are left with after the more outwardly pessimistic ending of The Tree 
of Wooden Clogs, and this may be what, above all, stamps Olmi's work 
with its poignancy and urgency.  CFu

The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith  Fred Schepisi, 1978
Fred Schepisi's adaptation of Thomas Keneally's sensational novel about 
the plight of the Aborigine in late nineteenth-century Australia, as 
questions of federation and independence for the nation are coming to 
the fore, juxtaposes the marginalization, even destruction of the native 
peoples as the modern nation of white settlers is taking place.
The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith traces the tragic situation of the half-
caste main character (Tommy Lewis), who suffers ill treatment from 
white employers, even as his connection to his people weakens. Finally, 
he takes a job with a more brutal family, who try to starve him into 
submitting to their decision that his wife should leave him. Always 
patient and humble, Jimmie now explodes into a murderous rage. 
Crippled by a horrific gunshot, he is eventually captured and killed.
At the time, this was the most expensive picture made by the nascent 
Australian film industry. Despite praiseworthy reviews, it did not find 
much of an audience in its own country, though it was exhibited 
successfully abroad. Australian filmgoers perhaps found the subject 
matter too uncomfortable; its depiction of violence is shocking. It 
remains one of the cinema's most moving and effective treatments of 
racism and its horrific consequences.  RBP

The Deer Hunter  Michael Cimino, 1978
The second picture by Michael Cimino, originally a noted Hollywood 
screenwriter, The Deer Hunter was immediately declared both a cinematic 
masterwork and a hate film of gross historical distortion. Somewhere 
between these two extremes it also became a commercial hit despite 
being focused on the loss of American innocence during the Vietnam War.
Opening in a Pennsylvania steel town, three mill workers, Michael 
(Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (Christopher Walken), 
are drafted for war. Before leaving their friends behind, however, Steven 
gets married, with his wedding ceremony and ensuing reception 
doubling as a send-off party for the new recruits.
Jump cut in country. All three are made prisoners of war who finally 
escape their torment, albeit with several complications. Steven ends up 
a paraplegic, Nick flounders in Southeast Asia, an emotional cripple, and 
Michael returns home guilt-ridden for letting his friends fall in harm's 
way. His lot is further complicated when he falls in love with Linda (Meryl 
Streep), once Nick's betrothed, while struggling to live as a civilian.
Over more than three hours of screen time, The Deer Hunter presents 
strong performances and a group of remarkably intense set pieces. First 
up the wedding, later supplanted by the now much discussed POW 
Russian roulette game. In between are various depictions of a collapsing 
community in the Pennsylvania hills.
Ironically and with an odd note of corny patriotism, the film's cast 
sing "God Bless America" just before the closing credits roll. The sequence 
provides a broken-hearted, conciliatory commentary on the sad state of 
affairs that views the United States as the source of incredible heroism, 
cowardice, ignorance, and blind celebration. Sounding the false hope of 
a new day, The Deer Hunter is therefore a negative American classic. 
Hindsight and distance from this 1978 reflection on the Vietnam war 
also demonstrate how the film is a provocative domestic melodrama. It 
offers a bravura depiction of the Vietnam experience channeled through 
individual men without concern for a wider social context. Most critics 
hold to this point, citing the film's simplistic, if not racist, depiction of 
Asians and the distorted use of Russian roulette in no less than two 
different narrative pivots. Still others focus on the homosocial, even 
homosexual, subtext concerning the warrior class and its assimilation of 
civilian life, read as the feminine sphere of influence.
The point may be most poignantly put, however, when recognizing 
The Deer Hunter was among the first mainstream American movies to 
focus on Vietnam. Simultaneously important for helping massage release 
patterns for so-called prestige pictures that screen only at the end of the 
year to qualify for Academy Award recognition, it provided indelible 
images for the pop imagination before earning a Best Picture Oscar. All 
this for presenting the seemingly banal story of working stiffs called up 
to their civic duty.  GC-Q

1978
George Romero understands the metaphoric social impact of the horror 
film like no other writer-director. With his directorial debut, Night of the 
Living Dead (1968), he engaged race relations in the 1960s at an almost 
documentary level. Ten years later, Dawn of the Dead continued Romero's 
trend of refracting collective issues in the most unexpected of places. 
Within the vessel of the disturbing "living dead," Romero here explores 
the uncanny relationship between the zombie and the culture of 
capitalism, setting his flesh-eating horror in, of all places, a suburban 
shopping mall.
Four escapees of inner-city violence, zombie and otherwise, decide 
to take off in a helicopter for less dangerous surroundings. Running low 
on gas and supplies, they land on the roof of a mall inhabited by a mass 
of flesh-eating zombies. After securing a storage area, two members of 
the escape party decide to do a little looting. After their pleasant shopping 
experience, the group decides to remain in the mall, securing the exits, 
ridding themselves of the undead, and living out the American dream.
Dawn of the Dead provides a cunning critique of the American 
consumer: arms outstretched, feet shuffling to the mellow pop of Muzak, 
the zombies wander stupidly around the mall, with only the most basic 
need for survival. Beyond these automatons, however, the mall's four 
human inhabitants add a complexity to Romero's assessment of 
capitalism. Spending months there, the survivors convert their storage 
area into a plush apartment, taking all they need and want. Nevertheless, 
the omnipresent views of the cavernous and deserted mall are a constant 
reminder that this excess of consumerism is only a distraction from the 
danger that exists just beyond the door, danger borne from humanity's 
own violence.
Romero's horror films have an enduring and eerie quality, perpetually 
jarring us from the fantasy of graphic zombie horror to remind us that 
real life is just as frightening. The mortal concerns of Dawn of the Dead 
unsettle us even after the living dead are left behind.  KB

It would be easy to dismiss Up in Smoke as a stoner comedy whose 
appeal is limited to midnight tokers and carefree college kids—and, 
surely, these groups remain the film's most ardent devotees—but to do 
so would be to ignore the inspired blend of improvisational comedy, 
absurdism, and free-wheeling nuttiness that makes the film far greater 
than the sum of its parts.
The first and best of the cinematic excursions of the wildly popular 
comedy duo, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, Up in Smoke boasts 
some of the most colorful characters in 1970s American comedy. Pedro 
(Cheech) is one of those rare protagonists who are played for both 
sympathy and mockery: he's a down-on-his-luck Mexican-American who 
lives in poverty but buys outrageous accoutrements for his beloved car. 
Man (Chong) is a burnout of the highest order, for whom a sausage-sized 
joint is but an appetizer. But the greatest performance is surely Stacy 
Keach as Sergeant Stedenko, the tightly wound, tic-ridden policeman 
whose determination is matched only by his incompetence.
One of Up in Smoke's surprising pleasures is its use of the widescreen 
frame; one wouldn't expect such a low-budget effort to be so careful in its 
compositions. Not only is the film a hoot, it is also pretty well made.  EdeS

1978
A kitsch classic, Grease was to pubescent girls of the late 1970s what Star 
Wars was to young boys. Snake-hipped, slick-haired John Travolta shines 
as Danny Zuko, hip leader of the T-Birds at Rydell High in the 1950s. He 
falls for sugary sweet out-of-town gal Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-
John) during the holidays and is then mortified when she turns up at his 
school, her virginal image threatening to cramp his style.
Based on the Broadway musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, the 
film has an old-as-the-hills plot: cool boy won't date goody-two-shoes 
girl, boy gets jealous when she dates someone else. There are various 
misunderstandings thanks to their interfering friends, and then he 
realizes love is more important than being cool and it all ends happily 
ever after. However, the point here isn't the story—it's all the other 
ingredients that director Randal Kleiser throws into the mix that make 
this one of the best film musicals ever made. As well as finding two 
perfect leads in Travolta (who was hotter than hot, especially with 
teenage girls, in 1978 following the megasuccess of Saturday Night Fever) 
and Newton-John (in a role originally offered to Marie Osmond), each 
supporting cast member is well chosen, from Didi Conn as beauty-
school dropout Frenchy to Stockard Channing as school tart Rizzo to 
Frankie Avalon as Frenchy's heavenly advisor.
There are also some great set pieces: the Thunder Road car race in 
the style of Ben-Hur (1959), Travolta pouring his aching heart out at the 
drive-in while animated hot dogs dance on the screen behind him, and, 
best of all, the toe-tappin', hand-jivin' song-and-dance numbers. Every 
one of them is a classic, from the sad songs of love, "Hopelessly Devoted 
to You" and "Sandy," to the sexy "You're the One that I Want" (in which 
Newton-John went from cutesy girl next door to black spray-on-trouser-
clad vamp, a transformation some of her fans never quite got over), 
to the bouncy "Summer Nights." Best of all, of course, is "Greased 
Lightnin'"—the dance moves practiced in a million teenagers' homes in 
the decades ever since the film's release.  JB

Shao Lin san shi liu fang  Chia-Liang Liu, 1978
Shaolin Master Killer
Chia-Liang Liu is nothing less than the best fight choreographer ever to 
work in the Hong Kong film industry. After cutting his teeth as the martial 
arts director for many of Chang Cheh's best films, he made the move to 
the director's chair, bringing his unparalleled kinetic sense with him.
Nowhere are Liu's visual gifts more apparent than in Shaolin Master 
Killer. Like so many other martial arts movies, this is a simple revenge 
story, but one that is broken into three unusually discrete chunks. In the 
first, San Te's (Gordon Liu) family is killed by the Manchus, and he swears 
revenge; in the third, he exacts that revenge. But the second section is 
where the story, the action, and the visuals all come together in glorious 
fashion.
The middle hour is devoted entirely to San Te's laborious training 
sessions within the thirty-six chambers of the legendary Shaolin Temple, 
where he develops his mind as well as his body. Most memorably, San 
Te must haul heavy buckets of water up a steep incline with daggers 
strapped to his biceps: lower the arms, stab yourself in the brisket.
The film's star is the famously bald Gordon Liu. The intensity he brings 
to his performance serves to make Shaolin Master Killer stand out in yet 
another way. And this isn't even to mention the fight scenes. Suffice it to 
say, they can't possibly leave you disappointed.  EdeS

My Brilliant Career  Gillian Armstrong, 1979
One of a series of international hits to come from Australia in the late 
1970s and early 1980s, My Brilliant Career also reflects the feminist 
movement of that era. Based on a novel by an Australian female writer 
(Miles Franklin), and with prominent women serving as director, 
screenwriter, and producer, the film traces the coming of age of Sybylla 
(Judy Davis), an adolescent who lives in the outback near the turn of 
the century.
Sybylla, determined on a "brilliant career," pays little respect to the 
more restricted life that her parents and society expect her to lead. A 
bit of a tomboy, she is out of place at her grandmother's house, where 
the women are elegant and finely mannered. Courted by two 
interesting suitors, Sybylla is well matched with Harry Beecham (Sam 
Neill). In the end, however, she decides against marriage, knowing that 
she will not be able to endure life as the wife of a country farmer—
even one who offers her the opportunity to pursue her interest in 
writing. The film ends with Sybylla mailing off the manuscript that will 
be published as My Brilliant Career. Excellent acting from a fine 
ensemble cast and an interesting presentation of early twentieth-
century sexual politics.  RBP

Like many of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's other films, The Marriage of Maria 
Braun focuses on a female character whose fate reflects the history of 
the German director's country. Married to a soldier, Hermann (Klaus 
Löwitsch), during World War II, Maria (Hanna Schygulla) believes her 
husband has died in battle; when peace is declared, she begins to work 
in a cabaret. Attacked by an American soldier who tries to rape her, she 
accidentally kills him during the struggle, which occurs on the very same 
night her husband returns. He takes responsibility for the crime, and 
while he remains in jail Maria works desperately to achieve redemption 
and to prepare a safe life for the days to come after his release. A decade 
of restless efforts turns her into a successful career woman, but happiness 
still seems impossible to attain because, though liberated, Hermann feels 
uncomfortable in her presence. He leaves for South America to make his 
own fortune, and finally comes back near the end of the film. But Maria's 
fate again proves to be cruel as, on the night of their reconciliation, a gas 
line blows up and kills them both.
The melodramatic premises in no way diminish the force of this 
remarkable film, which analyzes, through a particular case, the "German 
miracle." Paid for with huge sacrifices, Germany's reconstruction rested 
mostly on the fragile shoulders of its women. Not unanimously accepted, 
Fassbinder's idea about this postwar boom was that, "If the walls were 
reconstructed, the hearts remained broken." The Marriage of Maria Braun 
speaks about the loss of the soul in a society exalting prosperity. Brightly 
performed by Schygulla, Maria is forced to suffer for seeking self-respect 
and dignity by inhuman means. Fascinated by money, she loses her 
feminine charm.
Convinced by Danish-German director Douglas Sirk that melodrama 
always works, Fassbinder managed to avoid sentimentalism by being 
rigorous and efficient: His unmistakable "cold look" is still in place here. 
With The Marriage of Maria Braun, Fassbinder once again proves to be a 
master of the feminine portrait.  DD

Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 adaptation of Dracula is 
at once an effective and touching tribute to the German silent classic 
and a remarkable work in its own right. Arriving almost simultaneously 
with John Badham's Dracula and the George Hamilton vampire comedy 
Love at First Bite (both 1979), Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night retells Bram 
Stoker's story in a steady, almost hypnotic manner. Jonathan Harker 
(Bruno Ganz) travels through mistily beautiful yet threatening Carpathian 
mountainscapes to arrange for the relocation of the rat-faced, repulsive 
but melancholy Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) from his castle fastness to 
the thriving city of Bremen. When his boat drifts into dock, the vampire 
unleashes a horde of white rats who bring plague to the community and 
cause far more death and devastation than his few petty predations.
In this version of the tale, Dr. Van Helsing (Walter Ladengast) is a petty 
irrelevance who is carried away by the police after Dracula's death, 
and—as for Murnau—humanity is represented by the heroine, the 
porcelain-fragile Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), whose self-sacrifice tempts the 
creature to linger beyond sunrise. Adding in themes perhaps drawn from 
other vampire films, the coda has Jonathan transformed into Dracula 
reborn and galloping across a beach to spread the contagion further.
Opening with footage of Mexican mummies and slow-motion bats, 
Herzog's film is misty and suggestive, recreating famous images of the 
long-fingered, hollow-eyed bloodsucker from the original film as Kinski's 
slightly whiny, self-pitying, nevertheless vicious Dracula elaborates on 
the inhumanity of Max Schreck's Graf von Orlok. With the novelist Roland 
Topor (The Tenant) as a giggling Renfield and very strange, portrait-like 
readings of the traditional hero and heroine roles from Ganz and Adjani, 
this is unconventional as a horror movie—with scare scenes that are 
paced slowly, struck by magical or black-comic business rather than 
anything like action or even plot. If the original Nosferatu remains the 
most frightening screen version of Dracula, then this transformative 
rethinking is certainly the most mystic and mysterious.  KN

Like Andrei Tarkovsky's earlier Solaris (1972), Stalker is adapted from a 
popular Eastern bloc science-fiction novel (The Roadside Picnic, by Arkadi 
and Boris Strugatsky) and uses genre trappings—again a mysterious, 
possibly alien phenomenon that debatably materializes the innermost 
wishes of flawed investigators—to ask fundamental questions about 
humanity, memory, desire, and desolation.
In an unnamed small country, a Zone has appeared where the laws 
of physics and geography are suspended. Though the authorities police 
the borders of the Zone for the "protection" of the unwary, the title 
character, Stalker, (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky) is one of a small group of 
wounded sensitives who smuggle people past the barriers and guide 
them through the treacherous but magical space. Against the wishes of 
his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), who has to care for their physically challenged 
but psychically gifted daughter, the Stalker takes two men—a writer in 
search of inspiration (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and a scientist with a covert 
mission (Nikolai Grinko)—into the Zone, past the rusting remains of a 
former military expedition, through perilous and often-changeable 
pathways, to "the Room," where wishes may come true.
It is not unthinkable that the Strugatskys' original novel could be 
remade one day as an action movie, but Tarkovky's version might more 
properly be tagged a reflection film: in the Zone, forward movement as 
often as not means doubling back, and we far more frequently see the 
travelers at rest; long periods of speechlessness, marked by haunting 
music and a natural soundscape, are punctuated by intense, challenging, 
possibly futile debate among the characters. The Zone is one of cinema's 
great magical places: damp green and sylvan above-ground giving way 
to watery, muddy, uninhabited recent ruins as the party nears the 
perhaps-mythical Room. Like MGM's Oz, the Zone is colored amid drab, 
monochrome reality, though the Stalker's daughter has her own color, 
notably in a breathtaking final shot that conveys her telekinetic powers 
with a simplicity as affecting in its own way as the bloody shocks of Brian 
De Palma in Carrie (1976) and The Fury (1978).  KN

Life of Brian  Terry Jones, 1979
Beginning its life as a joke (when asked what the next Python movie 
would be, cast member Eric Idle said, "Jesus Christ: Lust For Glory"), Life 
of Brian evolved into a subtler vehicle. Well, subtle for the Monty Python 
team, that is.
While trying (unsuccessfully) to avoid accusations of blasphemy by 
clearly establishing that Graham Chapman's Brian is "not the Messiah, 
he's a very naughty boy," Life of Brian plays fast and loose with New 
Testament characters, and along the way makes both satirical and moral 
points. Although the movie, like all the other Python films, is essentially 
a collection of surreal, violent, and very funny sketches held together 
with a loose narrative thread, this one has—for obvious reasons—a 
strong story. The final scene, with a crucified Idle singing "Always look 
on the bright side of life," as Brian dies on the cross, deserted by family, 
supporters, and friends, was arguably the bleakest of any comedy since 
Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (1964). A huge international hit, Life of 
Brian nevertheless nearly failed to get made, only going into production 
courtesy of money from ex-Beatle George Harrison's nascent production 
company, HandMade Films.  KK

1979
Some of the most perceptive accounts of modern America have been 
made by filmmakers blessed with an outsider's eye. In Breaking Away, 
British director Peter Yates manages to invest what might have been a 
routine coming-of-age teen movie with persuasive insights into how 
class functions in that allegedly classless society.
On the surface, it's simply about cycling nut and Italianophile Dave 
(Dennis Christopher), torn between loyalty to his likewise just-out-of-
school pals, his working-class parents, and his attraction to a student at 
the university that sometimes seems to dominate his Indiana home­
town. Will he get the girl, will he and his buddies beat the student teams 
in the Little Indy cycling race, will he pass—or even take—his exams? 
But for all the laughs and action (and the movie is very funny and very 
exciting), there is also a serious, intelligent, and surprisingly honest 
examination of how money, education, work prospects, and private 
aspirations combine to shape one's life and the person with whom one 
shares it. 
Also worthy of mention are the skill in the construction of the racing 
sequences (Yates made Bullitt [1968], after all), the snappy dialogue, the 
Hawksian interweaving of ethics and relationships, the excellence of 
the cast (many of whom, like Paul Dooley as Dave's father, were never 
better), and the superb use of music. Huge fun.  GA

Real Life  Albert Brooks, 1979
Albert Brooks's debut feature, Real Life, has enjoyed a long life as a cult 
movie. Conceived in its day as a comedy inspired by a single, famous 
media event, the American "television verité" series An American Family, 
it has turned out to be an even more far-reaching satire of the entire, 
international phenomenon now known as "reality TV."
Developing the acerbic tone of his sketches for Saturday Night Live, 
Brooks here again casts himself as the entirely unlovable center of a 
hilariously misanthropic, modern fable. Once he moves himself and a 
crew (whose cameras are built into astronaut-like headgear) into the 
home of an "ordinary, typical" family, nothing remains real or sane for 
long. The seduction of glamorous showbiz and the lure of the almighty 
dollar control every single transaction in this film, giving the story its 
brutal logic.
Outside America, Brooks is often hailed as an idiosyncratic, radical 
filmmaker; Stanley Kubrick was among his biggest fans. His ruthlessly 
pared-down style, serving a form of comedy that lets no one off the 
hook, is deliberately disquieting, almost anti-Woody Allen. But if he 
had made only Real Life, his place in the annals of alternative American 
cinema would still be secure.  AM

"In space no one can hear you scream." Alien's poster line was a classic 
come-on, but satisfyingly screams could be heard in cinemas. Defying 
the Star Wars (1977) craze, Ridley Scott resurrected the cheap genre of 
scary monsters from space, introduced it to exquisite, high-budget 
visuals, and created an arresting, nerve-wracking, adult-oriented science-
fiction horror film.
Dan O'Bannon's hip screenplay is indebted to nifty 1950s schlocker 
It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958) and follows the spooky manor 
formula of The Cat and the Canary (1939) or Ten Little Indians (1965), but 
set aboard a spacecraft and with a much more alarming yuck factor. The 
Nostromo is a giant deep-space tug with a minimal (and offbeat) crew 
led by Captain Dallas (Tom Skerrit) and including sharp Warrant Officer 
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and ship's cat Jones. Responding to a distress 
call, they discover a derelict alien craft and strange eggs. One hatches a 
face-hugging parasite that attaches itself to John Hurt's Kane and wreaks 
gruesome havoc once Kane collapses shrieking at breakfast and the alien 
bursts out of his chest. The rest of the cast reportedly didn't know what 
was coming, making their shock and revulsion genuine. Scott produces 
thrills and makes tense dramatic use of dark corridors as the dwindling 
crew, never having seen a teen horror flick apparently, make their ways 
into the beast's double set of extending jaws. What elevated anxiety into 
art via Oscar-winning visual effects is Alien's unique, awesome design 
and art direction mixing organic motifs with the metallic, and the 
sparingly glimpsed alien designed by artist H.R. Giger, its terrible beauty 
given a startling grace by statuesque Masai dancer Bolaji Badejo.
Weaver became a star and icon overnight as gutsy survivor Ripley, 
making her stand in skimpy vest and panties. She was actually set to film 
the ending naked, emphasizing the frailty of the human against the 
perfect killing machine, but 20th Century Fox forbade it, anxious to 
secure an R rating. Unusually for a horror franchise, the sequels were all 
assigned to directors with strong reputations for their distinctive visual 
styles—James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  AE

Conceptual artist H.R. Giger suffered 
from night terrors, which inspired his 
design work to some extent.

While this was not actually Peter Sellers's last movie—that was the less-
well-remembered The Fiendish Plot of Doctor Fu Manchu (1980)—Being 
There is generally accepted as the swan song to Sellers's career. Based on 
the 1971 novel by Jerzy Kosinski (who also wrote the screenplay), Being 
There was a labor of love for Sellers, who was obsessed with the book's 
central character, the simple gardener, Chance. In 1971, shortly after the 
book came out, Sellers sent Kosinski a telegram saying "AVAILABLE IN MY 
GARDEN OR OUTSIDE OF IT," followed by his telephone number.
Sellers's influence must have helped this film get made, as it is 
remarkably low-key and quirky even by 1970s standards. The story is, 
aptly, a simple one: after the death of his wealthy employer Chauncey 
Gardiner, the childlike Chance (Sellers) is mistaken for Gardiner. Taken in 
by Senator Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley 
Maclaine), his every utterance is taken as a profound remark about the 
state of human existence. Following a series of just-about-plausible 
events, he is seemingly about to become President of the United States 
when he vanishes in a suitably Christlike manner.
In less capable hands, Being There might have been a clumsy parable 
or weak satire on human gullibility, but with carefully paced direction 
by Hal Ashby (who gives the film a gentle, calm, and wintry feel 
throughout) and a superb central performance by Sellers, the movie 
works beautifully. This is also thanks to its often hilarious script, which 
constantly plays on verbal misunderstanding (most famously, Chance's 
unintentional sexual innuendo when, talking about television, he tells a 
pair of swingers that "I like to watch").
Sellers, who once said, "I have absolutely no personality at all. I am a 
chameleon. When I am not playing a role, I am nobody," brought a 
powerful passivity to the role, playing a polar opposite to his manic comic 
creations. Fittingly, after a long search for a suitable voice for Chance, he 
found one in the cautious, flat tones of another great British movie comic, 
Stan Laurel.  KK

"Chapter One. He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of 
proportion." Satiric and lovely, Manhattan is the rapturous high point of 
Woody Allen's on-screen love affair with New York City and even opens 
like an expressive Valentine, with an affectionate montage of city images. 
His 1977 film Annie Hall won the major prizes, but this bittersweet follow-
up film (also written by Allen and Marshall Brickman) is the perfect 
balancing act between wry, screamingly good wit ("When it comes to 
relationships with women, I ought to get the August Strindberg award") 
and well-aimed wounds. Allen's intellectual romantic Isaac Davis, a 
comedy writer, is hurt by Diane Keaton's pretentious WASP/Radcliffe 
tootsie Mary Wilke and runs back to the delightful and very fine, 
worryingly young Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) whom he has himself hurt.
Manhattan has some of the same Annie Hall elements that have come 
to be thought of as signature Woody. There are the psychoanalysis-
dependent protagonists ("He's done a great job on you, you know . . . your 
self-esteem is like a notch below Kafka's") and the confidence-sharing, 
wisecracking relationship with a male buddy (here Michael Murphy). 
Among the pleasures that are distinctive to Manhattan are an early film role 
for Meryl Streep (as Ike's antagonistic ex-wife Jill), atmospheric wide shots 
like the dawn scene of Allen and Keaton sitting on a bench below the 59th 
Street Bridge (the image used for the poster), or the compositions in their 
planetarium date, luminous black-and-white, widescreen cinematography 
by Gordon Willis, and a dazzlingly deployed George Gershwin score 
(played by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta).
There is a particularly great, revealing moment at the end of the film 
when Woody/Ike muses in monologue that Manhattanites create 
neuroses for themselves to avoid "more unsolvable, terrifying problems 
about the universe" and cheers himself (and the viewer) up by listing a 
captivating assortment of people and things—headed up by Groucho 
Marx, sports, music, literature, art, food, and not forgetting movies—that 
make life worth living.  AE

Apocalypse Now  Francis Ford Coppola, 1979
During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered to 
find and "terminate with extreme prejudice" a Special Forces commander, 
Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned renegade. Willard's 
journey is superficially an action adventure, but equally obviously an 
allegory of war's insanity and the journey of self-discovery. Finally, when 
Brando makes his appearance, the film becomes a philosophical search 
for a resolution to the insoluble mysteries of madness and evil.
Francis Coppola's epic was developed by gung-ho, prowar writer John 
Milius with Coppola's Zoetrope colleague and fellow antiwar guilty liberal 
George Lucas (originally set to direct) as a loose adaptation of Joseph 
Conrad's 1902 novel Heart Of Darkness, made pertinent to the war then 
being fought. The other main inspiration was Homer's Odyssey, prompting 
Coppola in a moment of levity to dub his movie "The Idiocy." The difficulties 
of filming are legend: A sixteen-week shoot in the Philippines became 
238 days of principal photography. Sheen, only thirty-six, suffered a 
near-fatal heart attack on location, but returned five weeks later. Brando 
showed up overweight and unprepared, forcing yet another re-think of 
how to end the picture before it killed them all.
Flawed but staggering cinema, the set pieces are unforgettable. 
Apocalypse Now opens (to The Doors' song "The End") with an electrifying 
montage as the broken and wasted Willard's demons overwhelm him in 
a Saigon hotel room. His indispensable and highly quotable narration, 
an afterthought during editing, was written by Michael Herr, whose 
Vietnam reportage in his 1977 book Dispatches had provided another 
source for Milius. Heading upriver aboard a patrol boat, Willard and the 
crew rendezvous with their Air Cavalry escort, commanded by one of 
the great scary loonies of the screen, Colonel "I love the smell of napalm 
in the morning" Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a demented, charismatic surfer 
dude in a Stetson who orders a dawn raid on a Viet Cong-held coastal 
village, the film's tour de force. The unit takes off at sunrise as the bugler 
blows the traditional cavalry charge. Kilgore blasts Wagner's "The Ride 
of the Valkyries" from his chopper and dispenses "Death from Above" in 
fountains of smoke and fire. This is but the first of several surreal, 
nightmarish, stoned rock-'n'-roll encounters vividly evoking fatal culture 
clashes and the psychoses of war, leading up to the "Gates of Hell," an 
engagement at the last outpost before Cambodia and the scene of an 
acid-trip frenzy of flares, screams, and gunfire.
On the other side, decapitated heads and the miasma enveloping 
Kurtz's compound await. Even more horrifically, so do the gibbering 
photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) and the ranting Brando, whose 
butchering is feverishly intercut with the sacrificial slaughter of an ox 
before Coppola surrenders to an unnervingly ambiguous ending. The 
ultimate horror of this hypnotic trip, though, is how closely it has been 
said to capture the reality of 'Nam.  AE

"It's showtime, folks!" This fascinating, imaginative, and intimately 
autobiographical musical that still divides audiences is an American 8½ 
(1963), a startlingly candid testament from Bob Fosse, the gifted dancer, 
brilliant choreographer, multiple Tony award winner, and Oscar-winning 
director of Cabaret (1972). Fosse's astonishingly frank dance drama—
which he conceived, co-scripted, and made shortly after he had 
undergone open-heart surgery—has as his alter ego the Oscar-
nominated Roy Scheider's chain-smoking, womanizing, pill-popping 
choreographer-director Joe Gideon. Too busy rehearsing his erotically 
charged new show, browbeating backers, and chasing leggy showgirls 
to seriously heed his troubling chest pains, Joe is dying, while 
contemplating personal failures, professional triumphs, and great 
showbiz moments. Brilliant or pretentious, according to taste, All That 
Jazz is savagely witty on backstage life and thrilling in how well it conveys 
the obsessive, all-consuming excitement of those passionately 
committed and driven in their work.
Sensational dancing in the jazzy signature Fosse style and eye-
popping production numbers punctuate the confessional reminiscences 
of the arrogant, satirical theatrical eminence. These include flashes from 
his seedy burlesque roots and his insufficiently remorseful view of the 
women he has loved, exploited, adored, and discarded in his life (one of 
them obviously based on Fosse's third wife, Broadway star Gwen Vernon, 
another played by his protégé and latter-day partner Anne Reinking).
Audaciously structured and edited as well, All That Jazz won four 
deserved Oscars and stands alongside Cabaret as the best two musical 
dramas in thirty years. As it turned out, this undeniably self-indulgent 
celluloid epitaph was made nearly a decade before the fact. Fosse died 
suddenly, if inevitably, of a heart attack in 1987, at the moment his revival 
of his 1960s Broadway hit Sweet Charity (which had provided his feature 
directorial debut) was opening. His legacy made itself felt in the Oscar-
winning Chicago (2002), an old Kander-Ebb musical reworked into the 
dark razzmatazz danse macabre we know by Fosse in the 1970s.  AE

The Muppet Movie  James Frawley, 1979
When is a road movie not a road movie? When the travelers along that 
road are a bunch of puppets—or, more specifically, Muppets, the 
creation of Jim Henson, whose eye for the absurd revolutionized 
children's programming. Although placing such "stars" as Kermit the 
Frog, Fozzy Bear, Ralph the Dog, and Miss Piggy in the real world (as 
opposed to the soundstage of "The Muppet Show") robs them of some 
of their magic, The Muppet Movie still has plenty of magic to go around. 
And, of course, silliness, because Muppets don't always agree with the 
laws of logic, let alone physics.
Kermit is a country frog out to make it big in Hollywood, and on the 
way he picks up a motley crew of companions, overcomes several 
obstacles, and evades capture by a villain who wants to exploit him as 
the mascot for his chain of Frog's Legs restaurants. But the plot comes a 
distant second to the songs and numerous celebrity cameos (some of 
them Muppets as well), culminating in an encounter with Orson Welles. 
The music is engaging, the voices (courtesy of the likes of Henson and 
Frank Oz) expressive, and the whole exercise just so much giddy fun.  JKl

Cristo si è fermato a Eboli  Francesco Rosi, 1979
Christ Stopped at Eboli
Francesco Rosi's adaptation of Carlo Levi's autobiographical novel is a 
stately, picturesque drama that captures the cadences of pastoral life in 
a small, rural village in southern Italy during the mid-1930s. Levi's anti-
fascist activities led to his being banished to the region of Lucania, now 
known as Basilicata. The film's title comes from the local belief that "Christ 
stopped short of here, at Eboli," suggesting that because of the area's 
remoteness, even Christianity passed it by. Its people are so removed 
from the realities of their country as a whole that they are oblivious to 
the turbulence tearing Italy apart, as it heads inexorably toward war.
The town Levi resides in has no commercial center. Food is scarce and 
life, mostly comprised of toiling near-fallow land, is harsh. As days turn 
to months, Levi becomes ingrained within the small community, setting 
up a small medical practice, which challenges centuries of superstitious 
belief, but to which the locals are grateful. However, the outside world 
slowly creeps into the town, as Mussolini's grip on the country intensifies.
Gian Maria Volonté's one-note performance notwithstanding—
nothing seems to move the actor beyond an expression of glazed 
bemusement throughout—Rosi's film underpins the political, cultural, 
and economic rift between the country's wealthy north and its struggling 
south. He invests his characters with dignity and, through Levi, reveals 
his admiration for their capacity for survival as they eek out a living upon 
this beautiful, yet barren, land. IHS

Although the 1981 film The Road Warrior—the second installment of 
writer-director George Miller's postapocalyptic "trilogy" (Mad Max 
Beyond Thunderdome followed in 1985, and a fourth film is also in the 
works)—tends to receive most of the critical acclaim, the jaw-dropping 
Mad Max, released two years earlier, is where it all started. For it was 
here that Miller first brought to the screen his hellish vision of a barren, 
gang-ridden Australia, with the aid of a new young actor by the name 
of Mel Gibson.
Gibson was just twenty-three years old when he won the role of Max 
Rockatansky (as legend has it, Gibson auditioned the day after being in 
a bar fight and his distinctively black-and-blue face stuck in the mind of 
the casting director), and was such an unknown that when Mad Max 
was released in America, the preview trailers didn't even feature him 
but instead focused on the movie's explosions and car crashes. In 
retrospect, of course, Gibson's portrayal of a leather-jacketed antihero is 
an essential element of the picture.
In a desolate future Australia, Rockatansky is a motor cop trying to 
retain  order in a quickly disintegrating society. Gangs race up and down 
the abandoned highways, raping and pillaging wherever they see fit, 
and one such group ends up at the door of Max's wife and child. When 
they are murdered, he seeks revenge, and so begins a violent rampage 
involving spectacular car chases, brutal fights, and relentless action.
What is even more impressive is the fact that the entire film cost 
just $400,000 to make—the budget was so tight that Miller is said to 
have crashed his own car for one scene—yet went on to make over 
$100 million, making it one of the most profitable movies of all time. 
Mad Max deservedly became a cult hit around the world (despite being 
dubbed into "American" in the United States, where it was thought 
audiences wouldn't understand the Australian accents) and remains to 
this day a striking, bleak, and memorable piece of cinema.  JB

An allegory about infantilism, Volker Schlöndorff's The Tin Drum is told 
through the point of view of Oskar Metzerath (David Bennent), a German 
boy on the sideline of history. Omniscient before birth, his life becomes 
the frame for judging adult behavior, especially with regard to 
troublesome, obsessive sexuality. When he receives a tin drum for his 
third birthday, Oskar refuses to grow any bigger even as he grows older. 
Afterward observing the rise of Nazism, he bangs his drum and exhibits 
a scream to break glass whenever he feels libidinously challenged or 
disappointed. Gradually, however, Oskar's size reduces him to little more 
than a freak show, simultaneously suggesting the absence of a moral 
conscience among people who supported the Third Reich.
Throughout its length the picture shocks and confuses. A midget 
circus act transforms into the headline of Parisian nightlife. Eels spill from 
a severed horse's head. A Nazi rally transforms into "The Blue Danube." 
Most disturbing, Oskar, the teenager trapped in a boy's body played by 
twelve-year-old Bennent, makes love to his housemaid-turned-
stepmother, possibly conceiving his child/brother. A sensation ever since 
being released in 1979, The Tin Drum is a fantasy turned on end with 
unexpected jolts.  GC-Q

The Jerk  Carl Reiner, 1979
Even though largely misunderstood upon release, Carl Reiner's 
blissfully silly 1979 comedy turned out to be that year's third biggest 
box office draw. The debut feature film of comedian and writer Steve 
Martin, his concept of an idiot living his dream despite appearances 
was well ahead of its time. Years later, excessive stereotyping formed 
the backbone of successful comedies by the Farrelly Brothers—
updating Martin only with their trademark obscene and overt sexual 
references for a more shock-resistant 1990s audience.
The Jerk's main character, a white-haired, thin, and pale Navin R. 
Johnson (Martin) was "raised a poor black child." It is funny because it is 
the bald and bland truth. Navin was abandoned as a baby and adopted 
by a black family who had love to spare. On his eighteenth birthday, 
shocked to learn that he isn't the Johnson's natural child, the naïf heads 
off to St. Louis to seek his destiny. The trip is serendipitous, leading the 
gullible but happy-go-lucky jerk to fame, fortune, and love. 
Romantically linked to Martin at the time, Bernadette Peters's quiet, 
creamy-limbed Gibson girl is a nifty foil to her leading man's riveting 
comedic skills. The Jerk led to a TV movie remake and a pilot for a televi­
sion series, although both were unsuccessful. Hopes were high, but in 
vain, for the next pairing of Martin and Peters was in the grievously 
mistimed Pennies from Heaven (1981).  KK

Kramer vs. Kramer  Robert Benton, 1979
The 1970s began with Arthur Hiller's old-fashioned weepie Love Story, 
but ended with this very modern heart-wrencher from writer-director 
Robert Benton. When Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) realizes her 
marriage to Ted (Dustin Hoffman) isn't working, she walks away, leaving 
him to bring up their young son Billy (a nice performance from eight-
year-old Justin Henry, one that's not overly cute. It won him an Oscar 
nomination for Best Supporting Actor—making him the youngest-ever 
Oscar nominee). Previously a working dad who had contributed more 
money than time and emotion to his child, Ted has to learn by trial and 
error how to raise his son alone. Of course, because nothing in movie life 
goes smoothly, he is just getting the hang of things when Joanna 
returns, wanting to sue him for custody.
Both Hoffman and Streep give strong, natural performances (they 
won Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress Oscars, and the movie won 
Best Picture), especially in the tense courtroom scenes, while director 
Benton shows restraint during the bonding moments between Ted and 
his son that could easily have become overwrought and overplayed. A 
fascinating and moving look at the true impact—on parents as well as 
children—of both separation and divorce.  JB

"We were going to our son's funeral and you were worrying what I wore 
on my feet!" It is still a source of indignation to some that Robert Redford's 
beautifully crafted and measured directorial debut should have bested 
Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull in the Academy Awards, taking the Oscars 
for Best Picture and Direction. Honors for Ordinary People also went to 
nineteen-year-old Timothy Hutton for Best Supporting Actor (making 
him the youngest male to win this Oscar), and to screenwriter Alvin 
Sargent for his sensitive, intelligent adaptation of Judith Guest's acclaimed 
novel about the impact of a teenage son's death on a family. But those 
who don't "get" this movie are missing a remarkably fine, intimate 
personal drama about people unable to articulate the truth of their inner 
lives. Understandably, its appeal proved strongest in the United States, 
where its impressive commercial showing reflected 1980s America's 
receptiveness to the subject of getting in touch with one's feelings.
Hutton plays high-school teen Conrad Jarrett, overwhelmed by guilt 
and suicidal depression since his popular older brother drowned in the 
sailing accident he survived. There is no understanding or help for him 
from his distant, unsympathetic mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), a 
control freak preoccupied with neatly ordered appearances and firmly in 
denial of her resentment. His successful, easygoing father, Calvin (Donald 
Sutherland), is concerned for the boy but doesn't know how to talk to 
him about what matters or express his own feelings. It falls to a frank, 
hands-on psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) to reach Conrad and encourage him 
to acknowledge his deep distress and anger. Ultimately, only his father's 
love can save the boy, when connecting with him forces a painful choice.
Set in a wealthy Chicago suburb, the calm depiction of the Jarretts' 
social status and privileged comfort plays up the turbulence beneath 
the surface. The principals are superb, cast very much against type, 
particularly sitcom sweetheart Moore, and there is a radiant debut from 
Elizabeth McGovern as Conrad's sweet, awkward girlfriend. Redford's 
films are uniquely American and always graceful. This sincere, restrained, 
signature production epitomizes his liberal humanism.  AE

"It is a dark time for the Rebellion. . . ." Darth Vader (David Prowse) searches 
obsessively for callow hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Luke begins to 
discover his destiny. Roguish adventurer Han Solo (Harrison Ford) has 
bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) snapping at his heels. Rebel 
princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has unbraided her earmuff coiffure into a 
bun, and the evil Empire has a new array of techno-terrors with which to 
plague the gallant freedom fighters beleaguered in a galaxy far, far away.
The best picture in George Lucas's touchstone of modern cinema, the 
original Star Wars trilogy, this knockout sequel to the 1977 blockbuster 
and cultural phenomenon caps the first with more Oscar-winning special 
effects. Episode V has more personality: Romance blossoms in the lead 
trio, and strong new characters appear, all of them safely in the sure 
hands of studio workhorse Irvin Kershner. The action rages, from the 
spectacular ice planet Hoth to the rebels fighting their first epic land 
battle. The battle drives on to the cliffhanging climax in Cloud City, where 
Han's past catches up with him—and arch-fiend Vader reveals to Luke 
the shocking truth at the heart of the Star Wars myth. Between these 
assaults, Luke continues to train as a Jedi knight, experiencing the Force 
in the swamps of Dagobah under the tutelage of quirky mystic master 
Yoda—a wizened puppet sage performed with startling expressiveness 
and exasperation by Muppeteer Frank "Miss Piggy" Oz.
Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back incorporates all the hectic 
thrills of 1930s Saturday serials. The cracking screenplay by Leigh 
Brackett—noted for her collaborations with Howard Hawks—and 
impressive newcomer Lawrence Kasdan hurtles along with a spirited 
sense of romantic fun. One-liners became catchphrases—"I have a baaad 
feeling about this." Charming comic interplay for the scene-stealing 
androids C-3PO and R2-D2, and ever-weirder alien creatures wowed 
audiences the world over. Restored by Lucas in 1997 with digitally 
enhanced effects and an additional three minutes, this rollicking popcorn 
adventure is arguably even slicker and just as entertaining today.  AE

Atlantic City  Louis Malle, 1980
655
A wonderfully hard-to-categorize combination of crime thriller, love 
story, Beauty and the Beast-style fairy tale, and meditation on the 
changes affecting an American resort over half a century, Louis Malle's 
wry masterpiece centers on Burt Lancaster's aging numbers-runner, a 
garrulous romantic given to escaping the seedy circumstances of his 
current life with nostalgic fabulations of the way it was when he was 
big-time with the likes of Capone, Siegel, et al.
Suddenly an opportunity arises to revive his fortunes and self-respect 
in the shape of a feckless hippie coke-dealer (Robert Joy) who just 
happens to be the ex of a casino croupier (Susan Sarandon) the old man 
fancies from afar. Wealth and a young woman might be his again; 
trouble is, the coke really belongs to the Mob.
Malle and writer John Guare gently explore the gulf between dreams, 
delusion, and reality, making superb use of the fading glories of the 
titular playground, notching up the suspense here and there with 
expertly staged action sequences, and tethering the whole feather-light 
confection with solidly constructed performances from all involved. It's 
Lancaster, however, who finally steals the laurels in Atlantic City, with a 
career-best performance rivaled only by his J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell 
of Success (1957).  GA
Le dernier métro  François Truffaut, 1980
The Last Metro
There have been many French films about World War II and the German 
occupation, but none as sumptuous as François Truffaut's The Last Metro. 
This is also Truffaut's film about the theater, the second installment in his 
unfinished trilogy about spectacle, after his film about filmmaking, La 
Nuit Américaine (aka Day for Night [1973]).
While Jewish director Lucas Steiner (Heinz Bennent) hides in the cellar 
for the duration of the war, his wife Marion (Catherine Deneuve) runs the 
theater, putting on a play with rising star Bernard Granger (Gérard 
Depardieu). Truffaut takes a few liberties with history, yet crams in myriad 
true details of everyday life in occupied France, from placating an 
influential fascist critic to smuggling black market ham. Above all, he 
vividly evokes the feel of the era through period songs, clothes, and 
objects, and recreates a picturesque theatrical milieu, with playful 
reverberations between the world of the film and the play-within-the-film.
Although Truffaut made two pictures afterward, The Last Metro remains 
his swansong before his premature death. The film's huge success, which 
also owed much to the romantic central star couple of Deneuve and 
Depardieu, crowned his brilliant career. A consensual view of a troubled 
period, no doubt, but a wonderful, uplifting, and glamorous movie.  GV

The Shining  Stanley Kubrick, 1980
Thanks to Stanley Kubrick's ingenious adaptation of Stephen King's 
novel of the same name, The Shining not only brought unfaltering 
fame to both writer and director—it also launched actor Jack Nicholson 
into the realm of superstardom. His eerie and blood-curdling Tonight 
Show cry "Heeeeeeeeere's Johnny!" has become one of the most 
memorable scenes in the history of cinema. Recovering alcoholic Jack 
Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and 
young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to live in the now empty Overlook 
Hotel, a palatial resort in the Colorado Rockies where he has been hired 
as off-season caretaker. As the weeks pass, each member of the family 
experiences some form of chilling hallucinatory episode. Danny, the 
most psychically gifted, is the first to catch glimpses of the bloody 
murders that occurred in the hotel many years before. Next, Jack 
begins a slow and inexorable plunge into madness. Though he doesn't 
consciously acknowledge his experiences, with each encounter his 
behavior becomes more erratic, violent, and abusive. Distracted by 
Danny's withdrawal and Jack's irrational behavior, Wendy is the last to 
succumb. In the end, she is painfully aware of her imminent danger 
and despite her near-hysteria manages to survive with her son.
In his own words, King's book is "just a little story about writer's 
block." Collaborating with novelist Diane Johnson, Kubrick strikes 
heavily upon the novel's themes of communication and isolation, 
reinforcing them with rich symbolism. These themes recur throughout 
the film, partly through the psychic ability of "shining," and partly 
through Jack's terrifying spiral into insanity.
The film is dark, disturbing, and claustrophobic, and Kubrick 
demonstrates his mastery of the art, creating an atmosphere of great 
dread. Carefully selecting his camera angles and rhythms, he draws us 
into fear. Like all masterpieces, 
The Shining transcends its status as a literary adaptation to become 
not only vintage Kubrick—with spectacular aerial shots, a breathtaking 
and symbolic use of color, and recurrent mirror and labyrinth imagery, 
all enhanced by a memorable music score and Roy Walker's 
unforgettable production design—but a classic of modern horror 
cinema. Curiously, Stephen King was not particularly happy with 
Kubrick's interpretation of his tale of the deterioration of reality and 
gradual descent into madness. He believed that Kubrick's religious 
skepticism made it impossible for him to grasp the "sheer inhuman evil 
of the Overlook Hotel," looking instead for evil in the characters. The 
result, he argued, was a film with only vaguely supernatural overtones, 
made by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; a domestic 
tragedy—one that fails to get you by the throat the way real horror 
should. In 1997 King collaborated with Mick Garris on a TV mini-series 
that follows his original novel almost to the letter.  RDe

David Lynch's 1977 debut feature Eraserhead is a nightmarish vision of a 
heavily industrialized world full of hissing steam and polluting factories, 
perfect catalysts for Jack Nance's primal childbirth phobia. In The Elephant 
Man, Lynch works in many of those same themes and images, but this 
time they add up not to some weird, enigmatic metaphor but to a 
moving, humanistic statement.
Mel Brooks fought for years to bring the true story of John Merrick—
cruelly nicknamed the "Elephant Man" due to his large tumors—to the 
big screen. He fought equally hard to bring Lynch on board. The director, 
working in beautiful widescreen black and white, depicts nineteenth-
century London as an ugly, uncomfortable collision between Victorian 
sensibilities and the gritty, grungy realities of the industrial revolution.
Rescued from a sideshow by a well-intentioned surgeon (Anthony 
Hopkins), Merrick (John Hurt) tries fitting into a world whose first reaction 
to his deformed visage is shock and revulsion. Trained in the etiquette 
and formalities of the times, the gentle Merrick cannot overcome the 
prejudice and distaste of many of those around him.
Hurt plays Merrick with a sensitivity and dignity that radiates from 
beneath the tons of makeup that make him unrecognizable. Equally 
excellent is Hopkins, who realizes he may subconsciously be exploiting 
Merrick as a medical oddity despite his initial good intentions. It's a 
triumph all around but especially for Lynch, who earned numerous 
accolades that helped him escape from the art film ghetto.  JKl

The Big Red One  Samuel Fuller, 1980
659
The most ambitious war film in Samuel Fuller's career, a chronicle of his 
own First Infantry Division in World War II, The Big Red One was a long 
time coming. When it finally made it to the screen, a wholesale reediting 
by the studio and a tacked-on narration (by filmmaker Jim McBride) 
made it something less than Fuller had intended—he originally provided 
the studio with four-hour and two-hour cuts, both of which were 
rejected. Fuller enthusiasts still hold out hope that either or both of 
these versions might someday be restored. Nevertheless, The Big Red 
One is a grand, idiosyncratic war epic, with wonderful poetic ideas, 
intense emotions, and haunting images rich in metaphysical portent.
The effective cast is headed by Lee Marvin (as the grim, hardened 
sergeant), with Mark Hamill, Bobby Di Cicco, and Robert Carradine (as 
the dogface who corresponds most closely to Fuller himself). Packed 
with energy and observation, the film is full of unforgettable, 
spellbinding moments and haunting surrealist images: an inmate in an 
insane asylum grabbing and using a machine gun while declaring his 
enthusiasm for war; a protracted focusing on a corpse's wristwatch 
during the Normandy landing (a sequence that Steven Spielberg was 
well aware of when he made Saving Private Ryan [1998]); and a soldier 
carrying a dead child after the liberation of one of the death camps—an 
uncanny sequence that indelibly evokes the homecoming of the hero 
to a ghost in Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari (1953).  JRos
Loulou  Maurice Pialat, 1980
This groundbreaking drama by Arlette Langmann and French realist 
Maurice Pialat is a scathing criticism of French society, in the guise of a 
sexually frank (and possibly titillating) look at relationship dynamics. Its 
lasting value goes well beyond that.
The simple story provides a framework for a meandering and somewhat 
confusing tale which nevertheless hangs together with the utmost 
credibility. Nelly (Isabelle Huppert) leaves her boor of a husband (Guy 
Marchard) for the lazy ex-con Loulou (Gerard Depardieu—completely 
absorbing as a rough but sensitive rogue). He won't work but he'll steal. 
She works but pops back and forth to her ex for any number of reasons, 
very few of them clear. Seemingly improvised, the dialogue still seems 
fresh and real even if the quality of the English translation varies greatly. 
The notion that a woman would, as Nelly succinctly puts it, "prefer a 
loafer who fucks, to a rich guy who bugs me," was shocking for its time. 
Two decades later, the language is still salty and direct and extremely 
enjoyable because of it. Famous for its "breaking bed" scene as well as 
an outtake where Huppert disappears between two parked cars, Loulou 
is compelling, intelligent, and very adult entertainment.  KK

Raging Bull  Martin Scorsese, 1980
This boxing biopic was a personal project for actor Robert De Niro, who 
discovered the as-told-to autobiography of former middleweight 
champion Jake La Motta and persuaded director Martin Scorsese and 
writer Paul Schrader, his Taxi Driver (1976) collaborators, to commit to 
the intense, apparently unpromising material. With the Rocky movies 
(1976, 1979)—ironically also produced by Irwin Winkler and Robert 
Chartoff—celebrating the ring underdog who survives and triumphs 
standing as the most successful sports saga of all time, Raging Bull dares 
to deal with the anti-Rocky, a hungry contender who winds up a bloated 
has-been without really learning anything along the way.
After long years and many setbacks, La Motta (De Niro) wins the 
champion's belt, but in screen time a few minutes later he is clawing off 
the jewels to pawn so he can try to bribe his way out of a morals charge. 
Raging Bull is also a poetic, daring exploration of the soul of an 
inarticulate, violent man. It never excuses his many horrific flaws as it 
establishes the physical and psychological punishment he takes as well 
as dishes out, showing the deep-seated misogyny (and raging 
homophobia) that characterizes his whole Italian-American Bronx-
limited world. The miracle is that De Niro, in a textbook example of 
masterly screen acting, can find as much sympathy as he does for La 
Motta, showing how a jealous streak and in-the-ring aggression have 
appalling consequences for himself and his family. It's a remarkable feat, 
with the actor equally convincing as the wolverine-sleek, uncontrollably 
vicious punching machine of the early bouts and the fat-bellied shambles 
La Motta becomes when his ring career is over and he can at last give in 
to his uncontrollable lust for pastrami sandwiches.
Aside from the extraordinary fights—black-and-white hallucinations 
of popping flashbulbs, exploding body fluids, and brutal blows caught 
by cinematographer Michael Chapman on rollerskates—Scorsese stages 
many scenes that frighten or move: La Motta's brother Joey (Joe Pesci) 
hugging the sobbing boxer after he has been forced to throw a fight, a 
vignette that makes the Budd Shulberg "coulda been a contender" 
speech (rehearsed later as part of La Motta's nightclub act) from On the 
Waterfront (1954) seem hollow and contrived; La Motta needling his wife 
(Cathy Moriarty) and becoming so ferociously abusive that anyone who 
loves him has to leave; a low point when he is dragged into prison and 
batters at the stone walls as if he were yet again matching himself against 
Sugar Ray Robinson; and the rambling nightclub act La Motta performs 
as he tries to use words as viciously as he once used his fists, only to show 
how verbally punchy he has become as he struggles through his terrible 
act to the desperate catchphrase "That's entertainment."
Raging Bull is a film about masculinity that does not flinch from the 
collateral damage inflicted on women at the ringside—female spectators 
are seen trampled in a riot or receiving a face-full of blood splatter.  KN

Airplane! was the third film credited to the producer/director/writer 
team of David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, and the one that 
made their unique, parodic, detailed style part of the common 
consciousness. Essentially a parody of 1970s disaster films such as The 
Towering Inferno (1974), Earthquake! (1974), and Airport (1970), Airplane! 
was largely based on one disaster movie in particular—the 1957 film 
Zero Hour. Zuckers and Abrahams bought the rights to Zero Hour, and 
Airplane! follows the original's story quite closely—thereby, as the 
Zuckers later admitted, accidentally giving the film a structure that their 
other efforts like Top Secret (1984) and Kentucky Fried Movie (1977) lack—
to the point of containing some of that movie's dialogue (most famously 
Leslie Nielsen's line, "We have to find someone that not only can fly this 
plane but didn't have fish for dinner!"). But Airplane! adds other strands 
as well, taking what was by then an absurdly overwrought disaster film 
genre and playing upon all of its familiar conventions: a strained 
relationship, dangerously sick children, cowards who must face their 
weaknesses, a nun, blaxploitation jiveass dudes, as well as a wide streak 
of vulgarity.
While Airplane! may lack the R-rated humor of debtor movies like 
Dumb And Dumber (1994) and Scary Movie (2000), it does have its share 
of close-to-the-bone moments, mostly in the form of Peter Grave's 
Captain Oveur, whose pedophiliac remarks to Little Joey (Rossie Harris) 
were, probably fortunately, toned down in the writing process. Most 
important of all, the film continued the trio's ruling that parody must be 
played straight, and while some characters—pilot Ted Striker (sitcom 
actor Robert Hays) being the most notable—veer from this wise path, 
veteran actors like Graves and Nielsen play their parts as though starring 
in the most serious of dramas. The exception that proves the rule here is 
the superb Stephen Stucker as air controller Johnny Hinshaw, who 
seems to inhabit his own deranged camp galaxy. The team has cited as 
their biggest influence MAD magazine's regular feature, "Scenes You'd 
Like to See," which parodied harrowing movie moments in a completely 
deadpan manner.  KK

An American Werewolf in London  John Landis, 1981
663
An imaginative and witty horror-comedy—written by director John 
Landis when he was just nineteen years old—An American Werewolf in 
London revealed a more sinister side to England's capital city during the 
same year (1981) in which all news was devoted to the "fairy-tale" wedding 
of Charles and Diana that took place there. David Naughton and Griffin 
Dunne are two young American backpackers who venture onto the 
Yorkshire Moors one night despite being warned by the suspicious 
regulars of the Slaughtered Lamb pub not to, and find out why they 
should have listened when they are pursued by a hungry werewolf. Dunne 
meets a grisly end, while Naughton discovers the bite he has received has 
turned him into a half-wolf when he wakes up naked in London's Regents 
Park Zoo one morning with the taste of human flesh in his mouth.
Filled with gruesome, blackly comic scenes (most memorably, the 
werewolf pursuit through a subway station, and Naughton meeting his 
decaying—and rather annoyed—victims in a cinema), and great 
performances (including ex-Railway Children [1970] star Jenny Agutter 
as the nurse and Brian Glover as the grumpiest of the Slaughtered Lamb's 
patrons), the movie also boasts extraordinary werewolf effects from Rick 
Baker, which prompted Michael Jackson to hire him and Landis to work 
on his classic video epic Thriller.  JB
Diva  Jean-Jacques Beineix, 1981
Jean-Jacques Beineix's ultra-stylized blend of pop culture, high art, and 
B-movie thrills is recognized as the first entry in the Cinema du Look 
"movement." These films featured intense love affairs, were cynical in 
their view of the police, made prominent use of the Paris Metro, and, 
most significantly, were seen to be more about style than substance. 
Critics derided them at the time of their release. It was only with the 
publication of Raphaël Bassan's seminal 1988 essay, "The Neo-Baroque 
Directors: Beineix, Besson, Carax, from Diva to Le Grand Bleu," that the 
films began to be taken seriously as a reflection of French society.
Two illicit recordings, of an opera singer and the wiretapped 
conversation of corrupt cops, are the MacGuffins that prompt a series of 
chases around Paris. The film's pacy narrative occasionally segues into 
more relaxed divertissements. Most famously, in one sequence an entire 
room has been designed around the color of a small pile of Gitane 
cigarette packs on the floor. 
Like Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart (1982), Diva is all about 
the artifice of, and a passion for, the movies. Beineix draws on Jean-Pierre 
Melville as well as 1940's Noir to create an entertaining and visually 
resplendent confection, whose artfulness and dynamic gives it a vibrancy 
and allure that has outlasted many other films from this period. IHS

1981

An homage to rather than a spoof of the Saturday matinee serials of the 
1930s, Raiders of the Lost Ark brought producer George Lucas (hot from 
Star Wars [1977]) together with director Steven Spielberg for a movie 
combining excitement, special effects, and adventure, all played with a 
wry sense of humor.
Harrison Ford, in the role that suited him best in all his career, stars 
as Indiana Jones, a tweed-wearing professor of archeology by day, who 
spends the rest of his time scouring the globe for treasures and 
artifacts—like the Lost Ark of the Covenant (the gold chest in which 
Moses supposedly stored the stone tablets inscribed with the Ten 
Commandments). Unfortunately, the Nazis are after it too, having heard 
that any army who carries the ark before it is indestructible.
With his trademark fedora, bullwhip, and rumpled clothes, Indy 
outruns a speeding boulder in a booby-trapped cavern, escapes from a 
pit of snakes, dodges sinister bandits in an African market, and hangs 
underneath a moving truck in a nail-biting chase through the desert. These 
are only some of the movie's impressive set pieces. Our dashing hero is 
no Superman, though, getting beaten and bashed up at every turn.
The film works on many levels, not only thanks to Ford's superb 
performance and Spielberg's skill at piling on the action and excitement, 
but also because Lawrence Kasdan delivers a script that is more than just 
an old-fashioned adventure. His hero is a complicated, less-than-perfect 
guy who walks the fine line between being a thief of priceless artifacts 
and protector of them. The villains—especially Indy's archeological rival, 
Belloq (Paul Freeman)—aren't really that much different from the hero, 
except in their motivation. The heroine, Marion (Karen Allen) isn't your 
archetypal girl-in-distress either, but a physically capable woman who 
(most of the time) can rescue herself and doesn't need the hero at all.
Raiders is a perfect package of adventure, humor, effects, escapism, 
and terrific performances that has been imitated but never equaled. It 
was followed by two sequels in the 1980s, and, after a lengthy 
development period, a third in 2008.  JB

Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 World War II drama Das Boot was nominated 
for six Academy Awards, a "mission impossible" for any foreign film. 
Capturing in authentic claustrophobic detail the sights and sounds of 
underwater warfare, the film sidelines issues of nationalism to focus on 
the dangerous task of manning a submarine in war-torn waters.
Following a single mission to hunt down Allied ships in the North 
Atlantic, the action takes place mostly in the filthy, mold-ridden stench 
of the cramped U96 submarine. In charge is Captain Lieutenant Henrich 
Lehmann-Willenbrock, a veteran submariner at the age of thirty. Blue-
eyed leading man Jürgen Prochnow, until then unknown outside 
Germany, tempers the captain's expected ironclad professionalism with 
subtle, believable humanity. Although he acts as he must—letting enemy 
sailors drown rather than picking up prisoners, barking for clear reports 
even as his vessel sinks far below its depth capacity as the cabin rivets 
pop like gunfire—he is not without heart. The emotional truth of the 
terrible events lies between the lines of his daily diary entries. Prochnow, 
later embraced by Hollywood with appearances in The Keep (1983), The 
English Patient (1996), and others, so embodies the captain that it is 
unimaginable to think that both Robert Redford and Paul Newman were 
slated for this vital role when the film was a German-American concern. 
Within the superb supporting cast, Herbert Grönemeyer, now a well-
known German rock musician, plays Lieutenant Werner, a character 
drawn from Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, the war correspondent whose 
best-selling 1973 memoirs form the basis of the script for Das Boot.
Much of the film's nerve-shattering realism is due to the three scale-
model U-boats built for the production, which took up a large portion 
of the film's $14 million budget. As much a sonic as a visual experience, 
the entire film was shot silent; it was impossible to record live in the 
submarine interiors. The subtitled version is considered definitive, with 
all German and English dialogue added later—many of the German 
actors dubbing their own voices for the spoken English version.  KK

Gallipoli  Peter Weir, 1981
Australian filmmaker Peter Weir re-created the tragic and notorious 
World War I debacle of Gallipoli—a blundered campaign that sent 
thousands of Anzac soldiers to slaughter in 1915—with atmosphere and 
harrowing action, producing one of the classic films on war's folly and 
waste. Sporting rivals and pals, two fleet-footed young Australian 
runners—Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) the rough charmer, Archy Hamilton 
(Mark Lee) the sensitive idealist—enlist in the Great War and journey 
across the world for the British Empire, finding comradeship, courage, 
and horror in the trenches in the Dardanelles.
Weir distinguishes himself by creating a strong sense of time, place, 
culture clash, and intimate human drama while imbuing even simple 
acts with beauty and mystery, finding magical images that evoke 
excitement, high spirits, fear, and grief. Like much of Weir's work, Gallipoli 
radiates intelligence, humanity, and warmth through many such small 
moments. Charismatic Gibson, of course, is the one who went on to 
international superstardom, Gallipoli persuading Hollywood that Mad 
Max was not just a tough guy but one who looked like a romantic 
leading man. But the film's haunting last image is a freeze-frame of 
Lee—Weir's homage to a famous photograph taken by Robert Capa 
during the Spanish Civil War.  AE
Opening on a beach with a group of barefoot runners, Hugh Hudson's 
Chariots of Fire made Vangelis a household name as his electronic score 
became synonymous with sporting excellence. Telling the story of two 
English runners, the film also won the Best Picture Academy Award 
despite being a British production.
The film centers on Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish sprinter, 
and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), his devoutly Christian rival, as the men 
struggle for national and personal honor following Word War I. As they 
train for the 1924 Summer Olympics, the values of sacrifice and fair play 
pepper their tale, although an ample reserve is set aside to exalt the 
brilliance of physical grace. Over the course of this journey, Abrahams 
hires Arab-Italian trainer Mussabini (Ian Holm), both sprinters confound 
their Cambridge Masters (played by John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson), 
and the respective competition sparks the success of their teammates.
Ultimately concluded with triumph and redemption, Chariots of Fire 
equates athleticism with religious conviction, although Abrahams and 
Liddel are no mere figureheads. Instead they engage their times, wherein 
anti-Semitism, British classicism, and the lack of Hollywood high-concept 
technique mark this simple drama about seeking glory on the world's 
greatest stage for peaceful competition.  GC-Q

Chariots of Fire  Hugh Hudson, 1981

The controversial directorial debut of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and 
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) writer Lawrence Kasdan, Body Heat 
generated powerful and divergent reactions upon its initial release. David 
Chute called it "perhaps the most stunning debut movie ever," whereas 
Pauline Kael wrote a famously scathing review, deriding the film for its 
self-consciousness and neonoir pretensions.
Body Heat makes no effort to hide its indebtedness to noir tradition. 
Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a lazy, womanizing lawyer who works in a 
small town in Florida. In the midst of a terrible heat wave, he accidentally 
meets Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner), a rich married woman from a 
nearby suburb. A steamy affair quickly develops. Soon enough, Matty 
has convinced Ned to murder her husband so they can be together (and 
rich) forever—and to think it's his idea. After the murder, Ned gets double-
crossed in various ways, discovering he was picked out and set up by 
Matty from the very beginning. After Matty fakes her own death, Ned is 
sent to jail, where he does some research and learns that she had actually 
taken on another woman's identity. But it's too late to do anything. The 
last shot shows Matty sunbathing on an anonymous tropical island.
Besides the archetypal noir plot, in which a sexy mystery woman 
embroils a likeable, attractive but immoral male protagonist and brings 
him down, Body Heat is characteristically noirish in its rapid and super-
snappy dialogue, and in its depiction of a femme fatale who is 
untrustworthy but enchanting nonetheless. Over time, positive response 
to Kasdan's film has won out, with subsequent neonoirs (such as Blood 
Simple [1984] and The Last Seduction [1994]) paying homage to Body 
Heat, much as Body Heat pays tribute to noirs such as Double Indemnity 
(1944) and Out of the Past (1947).
But there is also a subversive quality to Body Heat, which moves it 
away from classical noir. It is closer to the so-called erotic thriller. What 
was left implicit and suggestive in the earlier films is here foregrounded 
and made the visual focus. The extended soft-core sex scenes between 
Hurt and Turner are shocking and risqué even by today's more 
promiscuous standards.  SJS

This sequel to the 1977 film Man of Marble confirmed director Andrzej 
Wajda's concern never to miss an opportunity to account for the major 
events in Poland's history. If the first film dealt mostly with the Stalinist 
era and its crimes, Man of Iron deals with the rousing of the Solidarity 
Movement, the strong union organization whose actions succeeded in 
blowing up the communist regime at the end of the 1980s.
Here again we meet documentary filmmaker Agnieszka (Krystyna 
Janda), who is now married to Mateusz (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), the son of 
former Polish worker-hero Birkut. Deeply involved in the organization of 
the 1980 strike in Gdansk, Mateusz is one of the Solidarity Movement's 
founders, and he tries to convince the intellectuals to join the union, too. 
A series of flashbacks shows us what was only suggested in the previous 
film: that Birkut was killed during the earlier strike in Gdansk in 1970, an 
insurrection that was savagely repressed by the communist Special Forces. 
However, this parallel between the events of the recent past and the new 
strike in Gdansk allows for the optimistic anticipation of a final victory.
Less intricately structured than Man of Marble, the sequel nevertheless 
provides worthy testimony of a decade that brought a surprising turn in 
the history of communism. The amazing documentary sequences shot 
in 1970 and then in 1980 intensify the film's national and international 
echoes. Western audiences, who were not too interested in movies 
coming from Eastern Europe, were especially shocked by what they saw: 
That is one reason why Man of Iron was awarded the Golden Palm at the 
1981 Cannes Film Festival. A brief appearance in the film by Lech Walesa, 
leader of the Solidarity Movement, as himself, also speaks to Wajda's 
sense of history and his uncanny ability to anticipate the future.
Determined to make a political movie with a strong impact, Wajda 
insisted on foregrounding the ideological message through dialogue—
excessively so, in the opinion of some critics. Despite such remarks, 
however, his film is a moving tribute to the Polish citizens whose struggle 
enabled the freedom so cherished in this part of Europe.  DD

The commercial acceptability of the title alone signaled the end of 
Hollywood's fear of engaging meaningfully with leftist politics. Warren 
Beatty's tribute to journalist John Reed provides an intriguing look into 
American political radicals of the early twentieth century and their 
fascination with the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and the improbable 
foundation of a communist state.
Beatty worked for years on Reds. He is credited, in the tradition of 
Orson Welles, as producer, director, screenwriter, and featured performer. 
The film was a daring venture, mostly because Reed, its central focus, 
was virtually unknown to the cinema public of the late twentieth century. 
Limited by Hollywood conventions, Beatty is able only to suggest the 
complex and frenetic aspects of Reed's meteoric career: front-line 
reporting from Europe; a fascination with Pancho Villa; involvement in 
union politics and World War I; his experiences at Harvard as a dandy and 
cheerleader; and his Byronic compulsion to seek out the unusual and 
the forbidden. The first half of Reds is devoted to Reed's love affair with 
feminist intellectual Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton). This part of the film is 
enlivened by some fine performances from secondary characters.
Once Reed leaves for Russia, Reds does an excellent job of delineating 
the epic events of the developing revolution, with its riotous parades and 
unruly mass meetings. Especially in the Russian scenes, Beatty conveys 
Reed's messianic enthusiasm and his deep commitment to political 
change after a period of self-absorbed adventurism (Beatty was especially 
suited to this role, given his own conversion to activism after a misspent 
youth). Wisely, Beatty gives the film a documentary flair by interspersing 
fictional sequences with short interviews featuring eyewitnesses of the 
period, including such luminaries as Will Durant and Henry Miller. These 
interviews not only provide a good deal of information about Reed but 
also argue for his importance in American history, which is the film's 
overall project. Reds, despite its concessions to entertainment cinema, is 
arguably Hollywood's most effective presentation of politics and 
ideological conflict in twentieth-century America.  BP

Despite Ridley Scott's Alien having convinced us that beings from outer 
space were something to be wary of, three years later Steven Spielberg 
showed that they could be cute and cuddly too, especially if they came 
in the form of pot-bellied creatures like E.T. His adorable, wide-eyed 
appearance was supposedly imagined after Spielberg's team 
superimposed Einstein's eyes and forehead onto the face of a baby.
A sci-fi adventure for the whole family, this was Spielberg's homage 
to childhood. A lonely little boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas), befriends the 
outer space being (played in many scenes by a small person in an E.T. 
suit) left behind by his pals. He introduces him to Earth customs such as 
how to communicate, drink beer, eat candy, and dress up in his little 
sister Gertie's (Drew Barrymore) clothes. Of course their secret friendship 
can't last for long, and soon the boy and his alien are under threat from 
government men wanting to experiment on the intergalactic traveler.
Based on an idea Spielberg had nurtured for a while and related 
to screenwriter Melissa Mathison after shooting Raiders of the Lost 
Ark (1981), E.T. works as a delightful adventure that appeals to the child 
in all of us, also delivering enough sentimental moments to have the 
hardest viewer reduced to a blubbering mess before the end credits. 
That it doesn't become too sugary sweet comes from Spielberg's pacing 
and the mixture of humor and sadness in Mathison's script, coupled with 
Debra Winger and Pat Welsh's raspy vocalizations for E.T. and superb 
performances by the mainly young cast. Thomas—as the lucky boy 
whose imaginary friend is actually real—virtually carries the film on his 
own small shoulders, while Robert MacNaughton (as older brother 
Michael) and seven-year-old Drew Barrymore give terrific turns as the 
initially hesitant siblings won over by E.T.'s considerable charm.
Twenty years after the movie's original release, Spielberg brought out 
a special anniversary edition, featuring some computer alterations to 
E.T.'s facial expressions that he was unable to accomplish in 1982. The 
other notable change was the digital replacement of guns from the 
hands of the government agents (something Spielberg had never been 
comfortable with) with walkie-talkie radios.  JB

Fast Times at Ridgemont High  Amy Heckerling, 1982
Just one year after Bob Clark's gross-out classic Porky's set new (albeit 
short-lived) lows for Hollywood humor, Amy Heckerling's Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High brilliantly melded the teen comedy with the coming-of-
age tale in this surprisingly sensitive take on suburban high school life. 
Featuring a bevy of young actors, Fast Times holds up extraordinarily well 
under repeat viewings (spot the star!) and possesses strong nostalgic 
appeal for those who caught it on its initial release. In fact, a sweet sense 
of melancholy underlies this look at an adolescent American present 
fading all too quickly into the past—not surprising for a movie scripted 
by the future writer-director of such Gen-X hits as Say Anything (1989) 
and Almost Famous (2000), ex-Rolling Stone reporter Cameron Crowe.
But Heckerling deserves as much credit as Crowe for seamlessly 
weaving together Fast Times's multiple narratives, and for bringing out 
the humor in a story that sounds far more depressing than funny. 
Anticipating the touch she would later show in Clueless (1995), Heckerling 
mines the melodramatic material for laughs, avoids oversentimentality, 
and provides happy endings for everyone. Best line: "All I need are some 
tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine," spoken by perennially stoned 
surfer dude Jeff Spicoli (Penn, who almost steals the whole film from his 
peers) in an ultra-lazy Southern California accent that predates Bill & Ted's 
Excellent Adventure (1989) by more than half a decade.  SJS

This "ultimate experience in grueling horror," as it immodestly bills itself 
in the end credits, changed the history of its genre. Sam Raimi took the 
gore of Italian horror movies and mixed it with a proudly juvenile sense 
of humor—making its teenage heroes so vapidly wholesome that we 
cannot wait, once they are holed up in a remote country shack, for them 
to die or be zombiefied. Such self-consciousness would subsequently 
come to dominate screen horror.
It is the ultimate "movie nerd" success story, flagrantly amateurish in 
many of its effects, but powered by a full-on soundtrack and ubiquitous, 
rapid, low-to-the-ground point of view shots. Raimi absorbed lessons 
from the 1970s generation of William Friedkin, Wes Craven, George 
Romero, and Brian De Palma, but added a down-home surrealism, 
somewhere between Jean Cocteau and Tex Avery. And in Bruce Campbell, 
Raimi found a sympathetically cartoonish star.
Today, it is hard to see anything but comedy in The Evil Dead, 
especially in the light of its sequels, Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of 
Darkness (1993). But we must remember that in 1982 the film had the 
same terrifying effect on audiences as The Blair Witch Project seventeen 
years later—taking them, momentarily, out of their comfort zone.  AM

Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) helmsman Tobe Hooper gets on-screen 
credit for directing Poltergeist, but by all accounts producer Steven 
Spielberg played a more-than-supporting role in the film's creation. 
Indeed, the story of a suburban family disrupted and threatened by the 
increasingly malevolent unknown jibes with many of Spielberg's past 
and future scenarios, as does the somewhat playful casting of that 
modern bogeyman the television as the film's proxy villain, through 
which the malevolent spirits first make contact.
What begins as a wondrous encounter with the supernatural soon 
turns horrific, as the spooks manifest themselves in increasingly nasty 
ways (and via increasingly elaborate special effects). Copious movie 
magic and southern California family dynamics aside, Poltergeist proves 
far more terrifying than most of Spielberg's projects. This swings the see-
saw of credit back to Hooper, who knows a thing or two about scaring 
audiences out of their wits: Skeletons start bobbing in the swimming 
pool, a boy is eaten by a tree, and a paranormal investigator tears off his 
own face. While anyone would be forgiven for asking why the family 
doesn't just pack their bags and leave, Hooper keeps the shocks and 
surprises coming at such a deviously steady pace that common sense 
plays second fiddle here to suspense and outright horror.  JKl

Zu früh, zu spät  Danièle Huillet & Jean-Marie Straub, 1982
Too Early, Too Late
This color documentary by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, one 
of their few works in 16mm, is one of the best landscape films. There are 
no "characters" in this 105-minute feature about places, yet paradoxically 
it's the most densely populated work that they made. The first part 
shows a series of locations in contemporary France, accompanied by 
Huillet reading part of a letter Friedrich Engels wrote to Karl Kautsky 
describing the impoverished state of French peasants, and excerpts 
from the "Notebooks of Grievances," compiled in 1789 by the village 
mayors of those same locales in response to plans for further taxation.
The especially fine second section, roughly twice as long, does the 
same thing with a more recent Marxist text by Mahmoud Hussein about 
Egyptian peasants' resistance to English occupation before the "petit-
bourgeois" revolution of Neguib in 1952. Both sections suggest that the 
peasants revolted too soon and succeeded too late. One of the film's 
formal inspirations is Beethoven's late quartets, and its slow rhythm is 
central to the experience it yields; what is so remarkable about Straub 
and Huillet's beautiful long takes is how their rigorous attention to both 
sound and image seems to open up an entire universe, whether in front 
of a large urban factory or out on a country road.  JRos

The story surrounding Yol is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. 
Director and writer Yilmaz Güney realized the film from prison. It was 
shot and overseen by Güney's assistant, Serif Gören, who worked from 
detailed notes and instructions written by Güney in his cell. The director 
subsequently escaped from jail and was present for the editing and 
postproduction. Yol went on to win the grand prize at the Cannes Film 
Festival and brought the world's attention to the violation of political 
prisoners' human rights in Turkey's right-wing dictatorship. Sadly, Güney 
died of cancer of a few years later after completing just one more film, 
The Wall (1983).
Yol is a deeply political film with an overt message and purpose that 
subordinates all the other elements. In each of the five prisoners' stories, 
hidebound traditions, religion, or the repression of the state are exposed. 
One of the prisoners must go back right away because of a petty rule. 
Another prisoner is cowed by his family, who want him to perform an 
honor killing on his unfaithful wife. A third convict who is happy to come 
home to his fiancée is soon disappointed because his family has selected 
a different woman for him to marry. A Kurdish prisoner returns to his 
native village after a long trip that takes nearly half of his leave, only 
to find that the Turkish army has completely wiped it out. Only one 
prisoner's story is hopeful, although he too suffers many setbacks and 
faces similar problems to the others.
The film is deeply pessimistic and pulses with a palpable rage, 
making this otherwise fairly conventionally structured film stirring and 
fresh. Güney's eye for detail and his desire to expose the reactionary 
forces in his society together provide a more intimate look into the life 
of a country than do most foreign films. Although Yol's perspective 
is ultimately searing and critical, Güney takes pains to humanize his 
characters and make us care for them as individuals as well. Much of the 
credit for this must also go to the actors, who are uniformly excellent. 
Few better examples of engaged, political filmmaking exist.  RH
Yol  Serif Gören & Yilmaz Güney, 1982
Güney's five protagonists in Yol were 
inspired by some of the men that he 
shared his cell in prison with.

combination of sound 
and image especially, has 
an unconscious innocence 
no longer available to 
most European and 
American narratives."

Blade Runner  Ridley Scott, 1982
Written in 1968, sci-fi author Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric 
Sheep? took fourteen years to make it to the big screen, and it was another 
decade after that before Ridley Scott's jaw-dropping cinematic version—
Blade Runner—was finally recognized as a masterpiece of science-fiction 
filmmaking. The $28 million movie was not well received on its original 
release and was a financial flop; only after the Director's Cut version was 
released in 1992 did critics and audiences fully embrace it.
Books have been devoted to the story behind the film itself. A tough 
production by all accounts, there were numerous reports of on-set bad 
feeling—star Harrison Ford reportedly didn't like costar Sean Young, the 
crew had T-shirts made to express their irritation at the punishing 
shooting schedule, and, most notably, Ford and Scott didn't get along. 
Ford has rarely commented on the movie since its initial release, only 
remarking that it was the toughest movie he has ever worked on.
But what a movie it is. Justly acclaimed for its astonishing production 
design, Scott's vision of 2019 Los Angeles as bleak and neon-lit, with 
overcrowded streets and continual acid rain, has often been copied but 
never bettered. It is through this world that detective Rick Deckard (Ford) 
wanders, searching out "replicants"—mutinous androids masquerading 
as humans—while inadvertently falling for one such robot (Young). 
Packed with symbolism, Blade Runner has generated much debate over 
the years, with some fans arguing that the movie is subliminally about 
religion, citing examples such as replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) 
piercing his hand with a nail to possibly represent crucifixion, and Tyrell 
(Joe Turkel), creator of the replicants, serving as a God figure.
It is hard to imagine the film having the same impact with a different 
director (before Scott, Adrian Lyne, Michael Apted, and Robert Mulligan 
were all approached, and Martin Scorsese was interested in optioning 
the novel in 1969). As for the lead role, names mooted included 
Christopher Walken and even Dustin Hoffman. Scott's superb mix of 
twenty-first-century sci-fi and 1940s detective film noir makes for a 
stunning dystopia, while Ford, as the man sent to "retire" (that is, execute) 
human-looking androids who have come to Earth in search of their 
maker, may not have liked to "stand around and give some focus to 
Ridley's sets," as he told a journalist in 1991, but his bemusement works 
perfectly with the storyline.
One of the reasons Blade Runner has had such a cult following is the 
existence of more than one version of the film—the Director's Cut has 
added scenes, and leaves out Ford's voice-over narration along with the 
feel-good ending imposed by the studio. Another reason is the ongoing 
debate as to whether Deckard is actually a replicant himself. Whatever 
the answer—Scott has, on one occasion at least, hinted that Deckard 
may be an android—Blade Runner remains one of the most beautifully 
art-directed and visually stunning science-fiction movies ever made.  JB

Diner  Barry Levinson, 1982
After George Lucas's landmark American Graffiti (1973), the movieland 
zeitgeist preferred optimistic nostalgia for its maturing baby boomer 
audience. Responding to this theme, Barry Levinson wrote and directed 
the Baltimore-based comedy classic Diner with a cast of unknowns, 
several of whom would move on to remarkable showbiz success.
Diner opens on Christmas night, 1959. It tells the story of six twenty-
somethings grappling with their intermingled friendship and the closing 
decade, all of which is interposed over the preparation for the marriage 
of one of their own on New Year's Eve. Interrupting these activities, the 
film's eponymous restaurant becomes the group's home-away-from-
home, their surrogate womb. Within its walls, ensconced among leather 
booths and eating off polished tabletops, they talk, talk, talk to retard 
the demands of the outside world and revel in one another's company.
Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is an insecure loudmouth counting the 
days to his pending nuptials. Shrevie (Daniel Stern) is the hometown 
Everyman beholden to a steady job and a wife named Beth (Ellen Barkin), 
with whom he lacks an adult friendship. Boogie (Mickey Rourke) is a 
night-school law student, womanizer, and hairdresser with a gambling 
problem. Fenwick (Kevin Bacon) is the rich-kid dropout on the cusp of 
alcoholism, and Billy (Timothy Daly) is a graduate student with a long-
time friendship-turned-pregnancy by way of his old friend Barbara 
(Kathryn Dowling). The last of the six is Modell (Paul Reiser), a hanger-on, 
but someone with an acute sense of comic timing.
Well remembered for a few outstanding scenes, Diner is a bittersweet 
coming-of-age story set beyond the confines of Los Angeles or New York 
City. The very act of filming in Baltimore gives the picture a more general 
sensibility and expands the horizon of such screen tales beyond 
cosmopolitan city centers. Yet the humor of Diner is found in the set 
pieces, constructed around an aspiring cast exhibiting a great deal of 
camaraderie, and the production design elements that provide enough 
period details to seem utterly authentic. The cars are of the moment, and 
the music is too. A nascent sense of female political empowerment is in 
the air, but so is the queasiness of these young men on the verge of 
either conforming to society's general consensus or else striking out on 
their own in stunningly new directions.
Laugh-out-loud moments appear alongside dramatic vignettes. There 
is a spirited debate about Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mercer, for example, 
an unpleasant brotherly confrontation, and a penis in a popcorn bag.
Ending not with a bang but a question mark, the structuring absence 
of the piece is undoubtedly Eddie's fiancée. She looms large and 
represents the entanglements of family and domesticity—in short, the 
final acceptance of adult responsibility. Altogether, these are the values 
all six characters in Diner seem to loathe but simultaneously long for in 
their last gasp of innocence at the end of 1959.  GC-Q

Tootsie  Sydney Pollack, 1982
British critic Judith Williamson once disparaged the "Tootsie Syndrome" 
in contemporary culture—the device that decrees it only takes a few 
days in the shoes of your social "other" in order to completely understand 
and sympathize with their plight. The syndrome began with this film 
about a frustrated actor (Dustin Hoffman in a wonderful performance) 
who lands a role in a successful television soap opera by secretly 
impersonating a woman (who, these days, seems to resemble a Southern 
version of Dame Edna Everage).
The complications that follow for Tootsie—the frantic effort to 
maintain this masquerade, and the difficult attempt to romance a costar 
(Jessica Lange), including a mild lesbian complication—evoke the days 
of screwball sex-and-identity farce in the 1930s and 1940s. But director 
Sydney Pollack (who also plays Tootsie's agent) has a keen sense of his 
contemporary moment, both in behavioral detail and aesthetics.
Tootsie, alongside the work of James L. Brooks, pioneered a new style 
in mainstream cinema: intensely busy, bristling with subplots, pop 
allusions (such as, here, a cameo from Andy Warhol), and jazzy montage 
sequences—raising dramatic complications and hinting at subversive 
implications while skating gracefully past them to a happy ending.  AM

Fitzcarraldo  Werner Herzog, 1982
It is difficult to address Fitzcarraldo without first examining the obsessive 
bent of its director Werner Herzog, as well as his perplexing collaboration 
with frequent (and frequently inscrutable) star Klaus Kinski. Their 
working relationship was predicated on mutual antagonism and outright 
aggression tempered by a mutual admiration, and that contradiction 
regularly manifested itself in their confrontational efforts. Needless to 
say, despite his unpredictable behavior Kinski often served as Herzog's 
first choice when it came time for casting. Or was it just that Herzog could 
rarely convince anyone else to commit to his infamous grueling projects?
Indeed, both Jason Robards and Mick Jagger were originally signed 
to the role, and it was only after both bowed out that Herzog contacted 
Kinski. And no wonder: The film's plot epitomizes both Herzog's and 
Kinski's legendary tenacity. Opera lover Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Kinski) 
vows to bring opera to remote Peru. But first he must make a fortune to 
fund the quixotic goal, and his plan involves hauling a huge steamboat 
over a mountain ridge to an isolated plot of land where he might harvest 
the rubber trees.
Fittingly, or perhaps typically, making a film depicting such a near-
impossible feat encumbered by almost insurmountable obstacles indeed 
turned out to be an ordeal itself. It didn't help that Herzog approached 
the project with every bit the stubborn madness of his titular character. 
Injury, insanity, pain, illness, and even death in Herzog's quest to realize 
such a uniquely impressive vision in fact marred Fitzcarraldo's production.
Herzog actually filmed deep in the jungles of Ecuador and Peru, 
dealing directly with all their inherent challenges, from mosquitoes to 
mudslides. To capture footage of a raft expedition threatened by 
tumultuous rapids, Herzog and a small crew ran the tumultuous rapids 
themselves. Most famously, to show the steamboat being transported 
over the mountain, Herzog did just that, depicting the effort with a 
documentary-like verisimilitude. 
Yet Fitzcarraldo, the finished film, hardly comes across like Joseph 
Conrad's Heart of Darkness, let alone Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse 
Now (1979), and Kinski is no Kurtz-like invader. Compared with Herzog 
and Kinski's bleak conquistador tale Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972), 
Fitzcarraldo is downright innocent. Kinski's optimistic opera lover, 
nicknamed "Fitzcarraldo" by the Peruvian locals, is driven by idealism as 
much as intransigence. The curious natives help him bring his dream to 
fruition in part because of his innocence, exuberance, and total passion 
for opera, which he plays on an old Victrola record player that he carries 
with him. As the steamboat is dragged uphill, against all odds, Kinski's 
Fitzcarraldo stands on the top deck, beaming, as his Victrola blasts opera 
singer Enrico Caruso. It's a sight as surreal as it is inspiring, simultaneously 
announcing an accomplishment that is both dramatic (in terms of the 
narrative) and impressively tactile (in terms of filmmaking).  JKl

"The truth," Richard Attenborough said, "is that I never wanted to be a 
director at all. I just wanted to direct that film." For him, therefore, Gandhi 
represented a mission: Attenborough survived twenty years of delays, 
frustrations, ridicule, and personal financial risk to achieve his dream of 
recreating the life and times of Mohandas Kharamchand Gandhi (1869-
1948), in a way that would touch audiences of East and West alike.
Attenborough first conceived the project in 1962: His particular 
inspiration was Gandhi's dictum, "It has always been a mystery to me 
how men can feel themselves honored by the humiliation of their fellow 
beings." Already a producer, Attenborough was not to embark as a 
director until 1969, with Oh! What a Lovely War, and at various stages of 
his eighteen-year struggle to raise finances for Gandhi, Fred Zinnemann 
and David Lean were proposed as more likely and more marketable 
directors. Various writers, including Gerald Hanley, Donald Ogden Stuart, 
and Robert Bolt, tried their hand before John Briley's script masterfully 
captured the essence of Gandhi's life and achievement.
Over the years, generations of actors—including Alec Guinness, Dirk 
Bogarde, Peter Finch, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Robert De Niro, 
Dustin Hoffman, John Hurt, and Richard Burton—were considered for 
the leading role. In the end the choice was the practically unknown Ben 
Kingsley, who had the advantage of facial features inherited from his 
Indian father. Kingsley dedicated himself to the role, shedding weight, 
taking up yoga, learning to spin cotton, and making a brave attempt to 
live life by Gandhi's example. The huge supporting cast included a 
remarkable display of stage and screen luminaries of the time.
Briley's script opens with the assassination and state funeral of 
Gandhi in 1948, and then flashes back to his beginnings as a young 
lawyer, protesting against racial discrimination in South Africa in 1893. 
From this it traces the main biographical landmarks of his battle against 
British imperial domination, and for an integrated Indian society and 
culture. Ironically, Gandhi's passionate commitment to peaceful protest 
often leads to violence and death, as well as his own lengthy 
imprisonment. Much of the action was filmed on the actual historic 
locations. The funeral scene, shot on the Rajpath using eleven camera 
crews, assembled an estimated 400,000 extras.
Gandhi triumphantly disproved the general tenet that films that are 
long in the making usually fall short of their ambition. Gandhi found an 
instant response in critical acclaim and a worldwide audience. Its eight 
Academy Awards marked a record, surpassed only by Ben-Hur (1959). 
For Attenborough a greater personal satisfaction was evidently the 
certainty that at least some of his audience felt themselves enriched by 
the encounter with Gandhi, through his screen portrait. For better or 
worse, Gandhi was to mark his future career as a director of inspirational 
film biographies.  JRos

The Thing  John Carpenter, 1982
A group of scientists (including Kurt Russell's protagonist) at an isolated 
outpost in Antarctica find themselves under siege by an alien lifeform 
that can take over their bodies. Cut off from the outside world, the men 
grow increasingly paranoid as they suspect each other of being taken 
over by the alien, and realize that they can't afford to let it venture 
beyond the outpost, lest it infect the entire world.
Based on the classic science-fiction story "Who Goes There?" by 
John W. Campbell, and having originally been adapted by Howard 
Hawks in 1951 as The Thing from Another World, this 1982 version by 
John Carpenter eschews the Boy's Own adventure of the Hawks film and 
goes straight for claustrophobia and existential dread. Carpenter's The 
Thing proved to be one of the most influential horror movies of the 
1980s, much imitated but rarely bettered.
Along with the films of David Cronenberg, The Thing is one of the 
prime texts to explore the themes of bodily invasion that pervade horror 
and sci-fi movies of that decade. It is one of the first films to unflinchingly 
show the rupture and warp of flesh and bone into grotesque tableaus 
of surreal beauty, forever raising the bar on cinematic horror.  AT

Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's large body of work is so distinctive 
that it is frequently spoofed by comedians as well as imitated and cited 
by lesser filmmakers. Showing the deeper, darker side of the human 
spirit without flinching or resorting to melodrama, Bergman's dreamy, 
allegorical films present life as it is rather than how we wish it would be.
Announced as the director's penultimate film (afterwards he worked 
primarily in television), the autobiographical tale of Fanny and Alexander 
came as a jolt to fans of his brooding earlier films. Written by Bergman, 
and featuring many of Bergman's most talented, seasoned actors, 
including Erland Josephson, Harriet Andersson, and Gunnar Björnstrand, 
Fanny is considered his most accessible movie—it won four of its six 
Academy Award nominations, including Best Foreign Language Film. 
This part-autobiography spans a stormy year in the life of a brother 
and sister (Pernilla Allwin and Bertil Guve) born into an aristocratic 
family in turn-of-the-century Sweden. Filmed with an energy unseen in 
previous Bergman productions, the story is part Dickensian drama, part 
mystical fairy tale. Beginning at a luxurious family Christmas told from 
the boy's point of view, it switches to their miserable life after the death 
of the children's much-loved theater-owning father. By then, the usual 
Bergmanesque sense of foreboding has descended on the story, settling 
on life during the deeply unfortunate and terrifying remarriage of their 
mother to an awful bishop—Jan Malmsjö in a suitably hateful role.
Fanny and Alexander's length and languorous, careful pace may 
put modern action viewers off, but Bergman's famous cinematographer 
Sven Nykvist uses lustrous lighting to make each frame a delight. The 
entire film has a dreamy sense of the unreal, a relief during its more 
tragic moments. Bergman, ever the master, wisely structures the tale to 
have its most horrific and most satisfying moment just when the story 
demands a resolution. By then the viewer is left breathless and waiting 
for the good times to return. Despite his life's work analyzing the 
frightening world of the living, Bergman here allows his audience some 
comfort—albeit with certain philosophical provisions.  KK

La notte di San Lorenzo   
The Night of the Shooting Stars  
Paolo Taviani & Vittorio Taviani, 1982
683
The Night of the Shooting Stars is the masterwork of the Taviani Brothers, 
Paolo and Vittorio, and takes place on the Night of San Lorenzo when all 
dreams come true. Narrated by a mother speaking to her sleeping baby, 
the story returns to 1944 when the narrator was six years old and German 
invaders and Fascist Italian collaborators controlled her village. With her 
hometown split between Nazi regulations and eventual liberation, a 
group of her townsfolk cross the Tuscan countryside seeking salvation.
Without either ignoring or dwelling on wartime terrors, this journey 
expresses civilian resistance. Daily struggles for food take priority 
over bullets or tactical advantage. Periodically the narrator's childhood 
perspective even shines through with tragicomically surreal images that 
discount the fearful quality of their odyssey.
Notable for its ensemble cast, The Night of the Shooting Stars also 
offers indelible images to salve the etched memory of unwanted conflict. 
A cathedral is bombed to kill worshippers. Wild watermelon is feasted 
upon in a field. Friends on opposite sides of a political divide murder one 
another. Two older people consummate a love affair decades in the 
making. Together these moments signify the gravity of World War II while 
remembering the dignity of everyday life.  GC-Q
De stilte rond Christine M.  Marleen Gorris, 1982
A Question of Silence
A key moment in women's filmmaking, Marleen Gorris's A Question of 
Silence charged and polarized audiences. It addressed women's submerged 
rage, reconnecting feminists with the anger that fueled the movements 
of the 1960s and 1970s while sparking accusations of reverse stereotyping. 
Provoked by a news story about a working-class woman's arrest for 
shoplifting, A Question of Silence centers on three women, strangers to 
each other, who spontaneously kill a boutique manager as he confronts 
a frazzled housewife in the act. A unique mix of thriller, courtroom drama, 
black comedy, quasi-documentary, and political allegory, A Question of 
Silence is alternately riveting and distancing, mortifying and electrifying. 
The murder itself is heard rather than seen and embedded in a series of 
three flashbacks sequences, subverting the visual imperative.
In the film's courtroom climax, as the women are pronounced the 
sane, their act becomes politically charged. The concluding scene must 
be experienced rather than described—other than to say that the picture 
ends not in a bang or a whimper but in waves of laughter, and finishes 
in silence. Although Gorris's recent films are mellower and more popular, 
A Question of Silence makes ideology visceral and is a true shocker.  LB

The Draughtsman's Contract  Peter Greenaway, 1982
In late seventeenth-century England, Mrs. Herbert, a wealthy aristocrat 
(Janet Suzman), hires Mr. Neville, an ambitious and arrogant young artist 
(Anthony Higgins), to produce twelve drawings of her husband's grand 
Wiltshire estate. The artist agrees, but his terms require certain sexual 
favors from his employer. Meanwhile, Mrs. Herbert's husband remains 
absent, quite possibly murdered, with clues pointing to the nature of his 
disappearance appearing in the artist's sketches.
Having worked for the previous few years in experimental cinema 
and faux documentaries, Peter Greenaway made his fiction feature 
debut with this beguiling puzzle-piece of a film. The film still retains the 
formal challenge of his earlier work: The compositions are geometrically 
exact, the dialogue is anachronistic and avowedly non-naturalistic, and 
the narrative confounds rather than clarifies. But there is a sparkling 
wit and pleasing theatrical playfulness to the film, which made it an 
unexpected British hit. The grand country-estate setting is exquisitely 
captured by Curtis Clark's cinematography, while Michael Nyman's 
music, which uses motifs from Purcell, is a joy. One of the most striking 
directorial debuts of recent British cinema, The Draughtsman's Contract 
remains Greenaway's most accessible film.  EL
It's the 1940s, a time when American families still eat dinner together, 
children walk long distances to school in well-bundled packs, and 
everyone knows their neighbors. For young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) in 
A Christmas Story, life is good but not quite complete. Christmas is 
fast approaching and all he wants is a Red Ryder BB gun. Despite the 
opposition of his family and teacher, he's determined to come up with a 
scheme that will secure the toy by Christmas day.
This simple set-up gives director Bob Clark more than enough 
ammunition to lovingly but bitingly send up Christmas, family values, 
nostalgia for bygone eras, and the consumerism that has come to define 
the holiday season. Both droll and laugh-out-loud funny, this modern 
holiday classic resonates so deeply because it never becomes cruel or 
dismissive as it tackles its targets. 
School bullies, a cantankerous dad and overworked mom, an odd 
younger sibling, and a posse of misfit friends all come to life in the voice-
over by a grown-up Ralphie. Classic scenes (a schoolmate getting his 
tongue frozen to the flagpole, Christmas dinner at a Chinese restaurant) 
manage to be both uproarious and touching without ever sliding into 
schmaltz or sentimentality. For those who loathe the saccharine aspects 
of the holidays, but don't actually want to be Scrooge, A Christmas Story 
is a perfect fit.  EH

A Christmas Story  Bob Clark, 1983

An hour into Money, a sudden burst of whiteness introduces a new turn 
in the narrative. A gray-haired woman (Sylvie Van den Elsen) walks by, 
with a subtle glance passing between her and a criminal fugitive, Yvon 
(Christian Patey). A few moments later, everything is green and natural 
for the first time in the film.
Mystery is a watchword in the cinema of Robert Bresson, but the 
relationship that begins here between Yvon and his benefactress is the 
most mysterious of all. The woman seems to realize that she has a 
murderer on her hands. Her submission to him is masochistic, spiritual, 
and sexual all at once—not to mention, eventually, suicidal.
Is this woman a fool doomed by her code of misplaced goodness, or 
a saint who brings momentary grace to a damned soul? And what is Yvon 
by this stage of his harrowing journey—the premise, borrowed from Leo 
Tolstoy, of a 500-franc note forged by a trio of schoolboys triggering the 
inexorable dissolution of every structure in his life—an alienated 
madman, a cold manipulator, or a victim in search of his lost innocence? 
The world of Money is barren and bare. The cold architecture of 
middle-class shops, courtrooms, and prisons is matched by an equally 
harsh sound-collage of sirens, cars, and machinery. Bodies are frequently 
pinned within the lines of doorways and windows. 
Is Money Bresson's most secular, materialist work a logical culmination 
of the despair about modern industrialized life enacted in The Devil 
Probably (1977), or is there a glimmer of hope buried somewhere in its 
bleak vision? Some poignant details escape the determinist grid, like the 
shots of Yvon collecting hazelnuts from tree leaves and sharing them 
with the woman, as white sheets gently blow in the breeze—one of the 
simplest yet most beautiful passages in any Bresson film. Here we intuit 
the profound mystery of beings who move through landscapes of 
dehumanizing violence with their capacities for evil and goodness locked 
silently inside them—and we witness fleeting moments of absolute, 
natural purity in a world gone to hell.  AM

High expectations for this celebratory, epic three-hour drama of America's 
early manned space program, with its ensemble of actors on the verge 
of stardom (Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, and, in a small comic-relief role, Jeff 
Goldblum among them), were disappointed by its modest box-office 
return against a hefty budget. But writer-director Philip Kaufman's offbeat 
take on the heroics and striking treatment of the visuals saw The Right 
Stuff rewarded with eight Academy Award nominations (including Best 
Picture) and four wins, and an appreciative cult of admirers for whom the 
film's aerial and Earth-orbiting space sequences remain sheer bliss.
Adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling, tough, touching, and tale-
telling nonfiction chronicle of the Mercury astronauts, the film contrasts 
the courageous but comparatively unsung exploits of sound-barrier-
breaking test pilot Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard perfectly cast as the 
laid-back, ruggedly individualistic fly boy) with the selection, training, 
and media parading of more competitive, crewcut-wearing jocks into an 
elite, all-American cadre with "the right stuff." The admiring but good-
humored and realistic, warts-and-all portrayals of the pilots is set against 
a distinctly satiric view of the Cold War's space race, with politicians 
desperate to minimize the Soviets' aerospace achievements by 
endangering and aggrandizing a batch of instant apple pie heroes.
There are many memorable moments: A race to find the crashed Yeager 
has a searcher point to a speck and ask, "Is that a man?" before cutting 
to the charred figure striding manfully from the smoking wreckage and 
then back to Yeager's buddy (The Band's Levon Helm, also the film's 
narrator) exulting, "You're damn right it is!"; Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), 
equally anxious to pee and to make history while his vigil in the capsule 
atop a Saturn rocket is torturously protracted, John Glenn's (Harris) orbital 
flight graced with a mystical slant and a nail-biting reentry that explodes 
into his triumphal ticker-tape parade; Quaid's cocky, grinning Gordon 
Cooper awed by the "heavenly light" glowing across his helmet. The picture 
is consistently thrilling, including its use of Gustav Holst's powerful work 
The Planets with Bill Conti's exhilarating, Oscar-winning score.  AE

The Big Chill  Lawrence Kasdan, 1983
687
Much imitated but never bettered—it is unlikely the television series 
thirtysomething would have existed without this movie—Lawrence 
Kasdan's nostalgic film about a handful of 1960s college friends, 
reunited in middle age for a funeral, manages to be both sharply witty 
and achingly moving.
Following the suicide of Alex—played by Kevin Costner, though only 
a scene in which he is already deceased and being prepared for his 
coffin remain in the final version—seven of his friends gather for a 
weekend to remember him. Sam (Tom Berenger), Michael (Jeff 
Goldblum), Nick (William Hurt), Karen (JoBeth Williams), and Meg (Mary 
Kay Place) are the pals, all dealing with their own midlife crises, who 
descend on married couple Sarah (Glenn Close) and Harold's (Kevin 
Kline) house, to reminisce, bicker, and open old wounds to a suitably 
1960s soundtrack.
Kasdan and Barbara Benedek's observant script captures all the 
idealistic feelings and disappointments of a '60s generation stuck in 
the far more materialistic '80s, while The Big Chill's ensemble cast 
delivers just the right combination of sadness and humor, never lapsing 
into sentimentality.  JB

Sans soleil  Chris Marker, 1983
Sunless
Chris Marker's masterpiece is one of the key nonfiction films of our 
time: a personal philosophical essay that concentrates mainly on 
contemporary Tokyo but also includes footage shot in Iceland, Guinea-
Bissau, and San Francisco, where the filmmaker tracks down all the 
original locations in Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), one of Marker's key 
cinematic obsessions. Difficult to describe and almost impossible to 
summarize, this poetic journal of a major French filmmaker and video 
artist radiates in all directions, exploring and reflecting on decades of 
experience all over the world.
A film about subjectivity, death, photography, social custom, and 
consciousness itself, Sans soleil registers like a poem one might find in 
a time capsule. Characteristically, it is a film of second thoughts by a 
photographer, a leftist, and a compulsive globe-trotter who remains 
haunted and transfixed by some of his own images. Significantly, as in 
his other films and videos, Marker refuses to take a directorial credit. It 
also seems pertinent that he assigns his own narration to an American 
woman (Alexandria Stewart) in the film's English-language version—
he is quoted only in the third person and past tense—marking him as 
a master of indirection. The wit and beauty of Marker's highly original 
form of discourse leave a profound aftertaste.  JRos

Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi  
Richard Marquand, 1983
The third installment of George Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy 
(otherwise known as Episode VI—Return of the Jedi) picks up some time 
after the cliffhanger events of The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Luke 
Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an eager young Jedi trainee in the first 
installment, is now a brooding warrior (hence the black clothing). Skilled 
in the ways of the Force, he returns to his home planet of Tatooine to 
help his friends—Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher, clad in a sci-fi bikini male 
fans still rave about today), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and 
Chewbacca the wookie—rescue their frozen-in-carbonite pal Han Solo 
(Harrison Ford) from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.
The main strand of the plot covers similar ground to Star Wars (1977). 
The evil Empire is constructing another Death Star, which our heroes 
have to destroy. Executive producer Lucas (who cowrote the script with 
Lawrence Kasdan) and director Richard Marquand introduce a new race 
of teddy-bear-like creatures, the Ewoks, to entertain younger members 
of the audience. The stars, meanwhile, are never eclipsed by cuddly 
muppets and impressive special effects, and skillfully bring Lucas's vision 
of intergalactic good-versus-evil to a close.  JB
This strange film chronicles the lives and deaths of the inhabitants of a 
remote village, hidden in a mountainous region of nineteenth-century 
Japan. At age seventy, each villager must be carried on a male relative's 
back over a rugged mountain path to the burial ground at Narayama, 
and left there to die.
The Ballad of Narayama centers on one family headed by a matriarch, 
Orin (Sumiko Sakamoto), who is approaching her seventieth birthday. 
Director Shohei Imamura portrays village life both unsparingly and 
surrealistically, revealing the unvarnished desires and hardships that 
drive the villagers. In a time of famine, when a family takes more than 
their fair share of the food, they are buried alive. A sexually frustrated 
young man, unable to get a woman, finds relief with a neighbor's dog. 
The village and Orin's family are revealed like this, vividly existing in a 
brutal hand-to-mouth existence.
In the film's last segment, Orin reaches her seventieth birthday and 
her oldest son, Tatsuhei (Ken Ogata), must carry her to Narayama. The 
trip over steep mountain passes is even more difficult than life in the 
village. As the journey continues Tatsuhei doggedly perseveres, and Orin 
gracefully faces her mortality. We come to realize that the fulfillment of 
this extravagantly useless ritual is what makes the villagers human.  RH

Narayama bushi-ko  Shohei Imamura, 1983
The Ballad of Narayama

From the author of The Last Picture Show, Lonesome Dove, and Horseman 
Pass By (upon which Martin Ritt's classic 1963 film Hud was based), 
Larry McMurty's novel of a strained, emotional, and difficult relationship 
between a mother and daughter was translated into a successful, award-
winning Hollywood movie by screenwriter-director James L. Brooks. It 
remains a textbook example of how to make a successful mainstream 
American weepie.
Debra Winger, at the height of her career in the 1980s, stars as 
Emma, the stubborn daughter of possessive, often smothering mother 
Aurora (Shirley MacLaine). Terms of Endearment follows their relationship 
over a series of years, from Emma trying to extricate herself from her 
mother by marrying the laid-back (and ultimately unfaithful) Flap 
Horton (Jeff Daniels), to mother and daughter reaching some sort of 
truce when Emma is dying of cancer. Although the film is a tearjerker 
of the highest order, Brooks manages to keep sickly sentiment at bay 
and in doing so helps his cast deliver one of the most moving deathbed 
scenes in recent cinema history.
The light relief—away from the mother/daughter harsh words and 
tears—is delivered in scenes by MacLaine, in an Oscar-winning turn, and 
Jack Nicholson, as astronaut Garrett Breedlove. It is during the moments 
between these two experienced actors that the film really sizzles, most 
notably as Garrett, displaying his devil-may-care attitude, drives himself 
and Aurora along the beach at the edge of the waves.
Subtly played by Winger, Daniels, John Lithgow (as the man Emma 
has an affair with following Flap's infidelity), and Danny DeVito (as 
another of Aurora's suitors), Terms of Endearment features scene-stealing 
performances from Nicholson and MacLaine that threaten to overtake 
the entire film. However, former television director Brooks (who reunited 
with Nicholson for the Oscar-winning As Good as It Gets in 1997) paces 
the movie in such a manner—cleverly mixing the humor and the 
tragedy—that their star turns only enhance this melancholy look at 
modern family relationships.  JB

El Norte  Gregory Nava, 1983
Exploring illegal passage into the United States, El Norte brilliantly 
confronts the fantasy of First World comfort with the reality of Third 
World people. Written by the husband-wife team of Gregory Nava and 
Anna Thomas and directed by Nava, the film is significant for exposing 
the porous nature of national borders and the exploitation of nomadic 
workers. Praising the humanity of illegal immigrants eking out an 
existence beneath the American dream, El Norte further recognizes the 
context of such experience.
For Guatemalan siblings Enrique (David Villalpando) and Rosa (Zaide 
Silvia Gutiérrez), the issue is much simpler than geopolitics. When 
their father is murdered for organizing bean pickers and their mother 
"disappeared" by paramilitary functionaries, they flee for their lives. In 
Tijuana they struggle with that city's poverty and capture a coyote before 
arriving in Los Angeles. Realizing the rampant racism of their Northern 
employers, though now with the advantages of indoor plumbing and 
electricity, they work as day laborers with an insecure future.
Guatemala is herein characterized by green and yellow, Tijuana with 
tan, and the United States with blues and white. Music also cues the 
siblings' journey, but finally it's the total effect of their migration that 
registers the force of modern economic disparity.  GC-Q
De Vierde Man  Paul Verhoeven, 1983
The Fourth Man
Wrapping up his auspicious European period before heading to the 
fertile fields of Hollywood, Dutch director Paul Verhoeven reached 
some sort of trashy apotheosis in black comedy with The Fourth Man. 
Essentially a Hitchcock film had Hitchcock made more explicit his fear of 
female sexuality, The Fourth Man stars Jeroen Krabbé as a semicloseted, 
alcoholic gay writer who suspects his wealthy bisexual meal ticket Renée 
Soutendijk may have killed her previous three husbands. Krabbé hates 
his homosexuality yet can't resist seducing Soutendijk's boy toy, and 
leeches off her even as he thinks he could be murder victim number four.
Confused by self-loathing, Krabbé's suspicions deepen, but Verhoeven 
keeps the truth intentionally vague. He packs the film with overtly 
Catholic symbolism and premonitions of death, perversely toying with 
expectations. In fact, Verhoeven has since claimed that he and 
screenwriter Gerard Soeteman intentionally added superfluous and 
utterly extraneous symbolism just to throw off critics, and indeed the 
movie proceeds unpredictably. Verhoeven would later revisit essentially 
the same scenario with his Hollywood smash Basic Instinct (1992), but 
that far glossier film failed to recapture the humor and twisted energy 
of The Fourth Man.  JKl

A groundbreaking film of the commercial/independent movement 
of 1980s Hollywood, David Cronenberg's story about the horrible 
transformations wrought by exposure to televised violence wittily 
thematizes the very problems that the director's exploration of violent 
sexual imagery in his previous productions had caused with censors, 
Hollywood distributors, and feminist groups. Max Renn (James Woods) 
is a cable-station operator whose cynical marketing of sex and violence 
backfires on him when his abdomen suddenly grows a vagina-like 
opening into which, among other objects, audiocassettes can be inserted. 
The film, in which such sado-masochistic fantasy and transgendering 
play key roles, ends tragically, with Max's self-destruction.
In many ways the most audacious formal incarnation of Cronenberg's 
characteristic themes, Videodrome begins as a fairly standard commercial 
thriller, only to be transformed, at midpoint, into subjective fantasy of 
the most outrageous and unusual kind. Visually rich, Videodrome is also 
thought-provoking in its startling meditation on both polymorphous 
perversity and the interpenetration between the public and subjective 
realms of experience. Cronenberg has been both praised and condemned 
for his fluid treatment of gender (a closing sequence in which two female 
characters grow penises in a kind of riposte to Max's "vagination" was cut 
from the release print as too disturbing). Even in its edited form, 
Videodrome remains one of Hollywood's most unusual films, too shocking 
and idiosyncratic to be anything but a commercial failure.  RBP

As if a movie like Koyaanisqatsi weren't adventurous enough in its own 
right—an avant-garde feature with no story, nonstop minimalist 
music, and a serious sociopolitical message—director Godfrey Reggio 
announced from the start that this 1983 production was only the initial 
phase of a qatsi trilogy, all of which would be shot on commercial-grade 
35mm film and aimed at mainstream theatrical release.
The series didn't continue until Powaqqatsi opened in 1988, and 
funding problems prevented Reggio from finishing it until 2002, when 
Naqoyqatsi finally arrived. Although all three installments have admirers, 
Koyaanisqatsi is easily the most fully realized of the bunch, retaining its 
power to tease the mind, tantalize the eye, and enchant the ear.
The film is rooted in three bold ideas. One is Reggio's wish to devise 
a new kind of sensuous, alluring cinema in which all the key creative 
partners—cinematographer Ron Fricke, composer Philip Glass, and 
himself as director—would be equal partners, making equal contributions 
to the finished film. Another is his conviction that general audiences will 
support nonnarrative cinema if it presents important ideas in an appealing, 
unpretentious manner. The third is his commitment to the message at the 
heart of the trilogy: that nature and culture have lost their ancient 
equilibrium in the modern era, and may spin out of control if humanity 
doesn't wake up to the dangers generated by its technological hubris.
True to its title—a word meaning "life out of balance" in the Hopi 
Indian language—the kaleidoscopic Koyaanisqatsi presents images of a 
world rendered incipiently unstable by all manner of human activities. 
The most memorable sequences use a diverse array of cinematic devices, 
from anamorphic lenses and freewheeling montage to time-lapse 
photography and varying camera speeds, to portray the world in fresh, 
original terms meant to spark fresh, original thinking about ecological 
and environmental issues. Reggio's vision borrows important elements 
from earlier experimental filmmakers—the influences of Stan Brakhage 
and Hilary Harris are especially hard to miss—while reaching out to a 
wider audience than any avant-gardist had previously attracted. The 
ongoing appeal of Koyaanisqatsi shows how well he succeeded.  DS

Brian De Palma's updated remake of Howard Hawks's 1932 gangster 
classic Scarface is bloody, excessive, outrageous, and brilliantly crafted—
and it sports an unforgettably histrionic performance from Al Pacino. 
When it first appeared, the film seemed like a striking departure for 
De Palma, away from Hitchcockian games with voyeurs, rear windows, 
and doppelgängers. Seen today, Scarface is quintessential De Palma, a 
treatise on the fragile conditions of male selfhood and power politics.
The film begins with documentary footage detailing the wave of 
Cuban refugees flooding into North America—adding a political 
dimension that completely transforms the template provided by Hawks's 
original. Tony Montana (Pacino) quickly realizes that crime and murder 
are his best ways out of the immigrant ghetto. His rise and fall as a 
modern gangster is rendered in a spectacular, garish style: De Palma 
takes every opportunity to heighten the fashions and musical crazes of 
the 1970s as a counterpoint to all the bloodshed and betrayal.
Commentators rushed to dub this take on Hawks's original (scripted 
by Oliver Stone) the first "postmodern" gangster epic. Montana even 
talks about himself in terms that recall Robert Warshow's classic essay 
"The Gangster as Tragic Hero"—"You need me, I'm the bad guy!" Yet, 
for all its dazzling self-consciousness, this is a grand narrative in the old 
style—and its cathartic, apocalyptic kick is tremendous.
De Palma takes to a new, melodramatic extreme one of the classic 
themes of the gangster genre: The hero's obsession with territorial 
control and the inexorable loss of this power. Tony dreams of absolute 
command—over his own body, over the hearts and allegiances of those 
close to him, and over the turf of his criminal empire. But after snorting 
mountains of cocaine, he cannot even see, on his own security cameras, 
those who come to kill him.
More than any disaster film made since the 1970s, De Palma's 
controversial masterpiece gives us the subversive thrill of seeing a social 
microcosm explode into a thousand fragments—and all the while, a 
blimp flies above, heralding a bitterly mocking slogan in neon: "The 
World is Yours."  AM

The King of Comedy  Martin Scorsese, 1983
Coming after Taxi Driver (1976) and especially Raging Bull (1980), Martin 
Scorsese's The King of Comedy might initially seem comparatively light. 
But while Scorsese does play the strange tale of loser Rupert Pupkin 
(Robert De Niro), who is obsessed with becoming a television host, for 
laughs, there's a queasy uneasiness to the film.
De Niro's confident smile packs as much menace as his far more 
imposing creations, while his unpredictable stalker associate Masha 
(Sandra Bernhard) comes across as so disconnected from reality that her 
appearances exude an aura of anxiety. Both are colorful reminders of the 
lonely and perhaps dangerous characters that exist in the periphery of 
any urban center. Still, the crucial key to The King of Comedy is Jerry Lewis 
as TV host Jerry Langford, playing, after all those years as a patsy, more 
or less an arrogant, bitter, and jaded version of himself. Lewis's dramatic 
break from his goofy public persona blurs the difference between fact 
and fiction, further highlighting the delusions of Pupkin and Masha. But 
Scorsese seems equally interested in the power and pitfalls of fame in 
general, offering The King of Comedy as a scathing indictment of the way 
our society overvalues celebrity.  JKl
A gentle Scottish-set culture-clash comedy in the tradition of Whisky 
Galore! (1949) and The Maggie (1954)—though without quite the 
undertow of malice that Mackendrick brought to his films—Bill Forsyth's 
Local Hero pits native Scots guile against the forces of global big 
business. An eccentric Texan oil tycoon (Burt Lancaster in the warmest 
of his latter-day performances) plans to site a giant refinery on an 
unspoiled stretch of Scottish coastline and sends a bewildered young 
executive (Peter Riegert) to clinch the deal, along with a Scots-based 
company rep (Peter Capaldi). Most of the locals seem eager to sell out, 
apart from the aged recluse (Fulton McKay) who owns the crucial beach. 
But before they can persuade him, the two oilmen start succumbing to 
the romance of the place. And then the tycoon arrives in person . . .
Forsyth's near-mystical sense of place and his affection for all his 
characters (not least a visiting and highly convivial Russian sea captain) 
play into his low-key, quirky humor. Riegert, as the hopelessly fish-out-
of-water Yank (his surname of MacIntyre, he explains, was chosen by his 
Hungarian immigrant forebears because they thought it sounded 
American), is touchingly bemused, and there's a delectable turn from 
Jenny Seagrove as a seductive water-nymph; but the film's almost stolen 
by Denis Lawson as the shrewd, uxorious innkeeper, unofficial leader of 
the village community. And the ending, though seemingly happy, brings 
a final touch of wistful melancholy.  PK

Local Hero  Bill Forsyth, 1983

Sergio Leone spent so much time luring actors to Italy for his spectacular 
string of Westerns that the setting of Once Upon a Time in America 
marked a radical change. Rather than the wide open spaces of the 
desert, Leone constructed an elaborate reproduction of New York's 
Lower East Side, the setting of his multigenerational story of Jewish 
gangsters (a wholly different kind of gunslinger) crossing paths and 
clashing over the years.
Beginning during Prohibition and leading up to the late 1960s, the 
film follows partners-in-crime Robert De Niro and James Woods as two 
gangland leaders whose different approaches inevitably lead to conflict. 
Noodles (De Niro) is quieter and prone to depression, whereas Max 
(Woods) is his hotheaded opposite. The film tracks the pair at three 
specific dates—1921, 1933, and 1968— and each time we catch up with 
the characters we are reminded of their inability to change.
At nearly four hours long, Once Upon a Time in America is Leone's 
longest and most languorous film. The patient narrative drifts along with 
the same narcotic haze of the opium den where Noodles reflects on 
his wayward life. As usual, Leone pays close attention to period details 
and composition, once again emphasizing his preference for the power 
of images over dialogue. His story plays out in simmering glances, 
scurrilous squinting, and barely concealed sneers. Helping this elegiac 
mood piece along is yet another brilliant score from longtime Leone 
collaborator Ennio Morricone, whose conspicuous use of the pan flute 
somehow suits the material.
Alas, Leone died shortly after the production of Once Upon a Time 
in America, but the film proved a fascinating conclusion to an iconic 
career. Lacking some of the force and invention of his more visceral and 
stylish spaghetti Westerns, it nonetheless offers a different set of distinct 
pleasures, slower paced, but still representative of the director's unerring 
good taste and confident control of filmmaking's every parameter.  JKl

The Terminator  James Cameron, 1984
This potential kitsch candidate for the Golden Turkey Award actually 
became one of the surprise hits of 1984, and its popularity over the past 
three decades has established it as a genre classic. The Terminator 
is a triumph of style over plot, smartness over intelligence, and a 
combination of elements that outstrips its parts. Its circular narrative 
about the future trying to control the past in order to take control of 
itself—hence changing the very premises of its own state—is a familiar 
one to all fans of postwar science-fiction literature (Harlan Ellison, Philip 
K. Dick, and others) and TV shows (such as The Outer Limits and Star Trek).
Fresh from low-budget effects work for Roger Corman and John 
Carpenter, director-screenwriter James Cameron adapted the disarming 
humor of his mentors to deflect objections to the many plot holes. The 
vision of a dark, dirty, and apocalyptic future was very much in vogue at 
the time, as witnessed by Carpenter's Escape from New York, George 
Miller's Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (both 1981), Luc Besson's The Last 
Combat (1983), and Lars von Trier's The Element of Crime (1984).
Cameron's assured style—tech noir, as it was called after a nightclub 
in the film—and his kinetic energy combined with a sparse economy 
of narration, keep the viewer distracted from the sheer absurdity of it 
all. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger—the very epitome of bad acting with 
his bland facial expression, heavy Austrian accent, and body language 
from the school of Frankenstein's monster—becomes a major asset 
to the film. The casting, Cameron admitted to Wired, "shouldn't have 
worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way 
you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like 
Arnold." All his violent acts and his ten or so lines are delivered with 
a mechanical dullness and a mock-grim look that charges them with 
an irresistible, multilayered irony. Virtually all of his dialogue consists 
of short, unremarkable phrases. Yet everybody who saw this sleeper 
phenomenon knows most of them by heart, down to Schwarzenegger's 
quirky pronunciation. "I'll be back" is probably the most quoted among 
them—frequently used as a catchphrase in radio and TV shows.
If The Terminator's ability to engage the audience in such interplay 
is reminiscent of The Rocky Horror Picture Show's (1975) ritualistic cult 
following, then the nudging irony points to the Scream quadrilogy's 
(1996-2011) satire of generic clichés. The same goes for the sadistic but 
slapstick violence and the "final girl" twist at the end. Under the surface 
of this mess of sci-fi elements actually lies an even less original slasher 
movie, complete with a (literally) mechanical killer and a tomboy (Linda 
Hamilton) discovering her resources to fight and overcome evil. But 
The Terminator is greater than the sum of its parts. The response to the 
film, like that to all great genre movies, lies not in a presumed originality. 
It is the way that Cameron fuses familiar elements and breathes new life 
into them that makes for such a memorable experience.  MT

Special effects and comedy are brilliantly interwoven in this fantasy 
adventure written by two of its stars, National Lampoon's Harold Ramis 
and Saturday Night Live's Dan Aykroyd. With Bill Murray they play a trio 
of paranormal "experts"—in reality, goofy science professors, kicked off 
campus for their antics—who set up a ghost-busting business from an 
abandoned New York City firehouse. Their timing couldn't be better, 
because the city is suddenly bursting with ghostly apparitions running 
riot, terrorizing visitors to the library, ransacking an upscale hotel, and 
even taking up residence in a skeptical Sigourney Weaver's refrigerator.
Ramis (the nerd of the group), Aykroyd (the bumbling dimwit), and 
costars Weaver and Rick Moranis (as the "Key Master") all have superb 
comic timing. But Murray's Dr. Peter Venkman, with his sleazy charm and 
cockiness, steals every scene—an impressive achievement when you 
consider that his special effects costars include a gigantic, stampeding 
marshmallow man intent on reducing Manhattan to a pile of sugary 
rubble that would hijack the movie from a less skilled comic talent. 
Sadly, while the stars realigned for Ghostbusters II (1989), Murray 
endeavored to rule himself out of a long-mooted third installment, 
insisting to its makers that he would do it only "if you kill me off in the 
first reel." But could that mean he comes back... as a ghost? JB

A baseball movie that turns America's national pastime into a heroic 
myth, Barry Levinson's romantic adaptation of Bernard Malamud's 1952 
novel traces the career of Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford), whose "gift" 
for the sport shows at an early age. Like all heroes, Hobbs acquires a 
magic weapon, a bat he makes from a tree hit by lightning and names 
"Wonder Boy." Although he shows great promise, his career is almost 
ended when a beautiful woman in black (Barbara Hershey), who sees 
his considerable talent, shoots him and then kills herself.
Roy becomes separated from Iris (Glenn Close), the good woman 
who loves him and bears his son—then, after years of drifting, finally 
makes it to the major leagues at age thirty-eight. There he struggles to 
get into the lineup of a last place team, which he soon turns around 
with his talent and charisma. Tempted by Memo (Kim Basinger), a big-
city woman, Roy almost loses himself again. But, in the end, he not only 
rescues his team from defeat but is reunited with Iris and his son (the 
novel ends more bleakly, with Hobbs striking out).
Levinson's style is hardly realistic—Roy's final home run destroys a 
light tower and starts a storm of electric sparks—but the film features 
subtle, restrained performances from Redford and a fine ensemble cast 
(including Robert Duvall and Wilford Brimley).  BP

The Natural  Barry Levinson, 1984

Who is that walking man? Travis (Harry Dean Stanton in his best role) 
emerges from the Texan desert to the haunting strains of Ry Cooder's 
slide guitar. Instantly the possibility of a story seizes us: Where did he 
come from, where is he going? It turns out that Travis is fleeing a 
catastrophic family breakdown that left his wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), 
who has also since disappeared, and his young son, Hunter (Hunter 
Carson), in the care of Travis's brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell).
Travis does not want to stop walking. Walt and others slowly bring 
him back to language, to sociability, to a remembrance of home and 
belonging. But nothing will be right until Travis finds Jane. He discovers 
her in a strip club where she acts as a therapist to the often troubled and 
lonely customers. In a touching scene, he tells her his own story through 
a one-way mirror—he can see Jane but she is unable to see him.
Wim Wenders's European, aesthetic vision—carried most powerfully 
by the landscape cinematography of Robby Müller (who also shot that 
year's Repo Man, another Harry Dean Stanton showcase)—meshed 
perfectly with the American sensibility of writer Sam Shepard. It is an 
affecting story of "otherness," a man who cannot fit into the "symbolic 
order." In the course of his tentative reentry into civilization, Travis 
naturally bonds with other outsiders, such as a Latin American maid who 
teaches him eccentric lessons in dress and manners, and especially 
Hunter, with whom he shares a charmingly childlike rapport.
Paris, Texas was pivotal for Wenders. Just as Travis negotiates gingerly 
his relationship with society, Wenders was slowly coming to terms with 
the act of storytelling in cinema—an obligation he had suspended in 
the wandering, episodic era of his German-language Alice in den Städten 
(1974) and Im Lauf der Zeit (1976). He was also bringing himself to 
contemplate traditional values of marriage, family, and community. For 
some, he subsequently went too far in his embrace of both conventional 
cinema and traditional values. But Paris, Texas, like Wings of Desire (1987), 
captures the best of both phases in Wenders's career: the longing for 
home and the recognition of a difficult, modern alienation from it.  AM

A Nightmare on Elm Street creatively combined horror and humor, gothic 
literary motifs and slasher movie conventions, gory special effects and 
subtle social commentary. And it let loose a new monster in America's 
pop culture: the wisecracking, fedora-wearing teen killer, Freddy Krueger.
Wes Craven's Last House on the Left (1972) and The Hills Have Eyes 
(1977) had established the former English professor as a low-budget 
horror auteur along the lines of Tobe Hooper and George Romero. After 
his next few works failed to live up to this early potential, Craven 
developed the idea of a killer who claims his victims in their dreams. 
Made for less than $2 million, A Nightmare on Elm Street was cast with 
unknown and B-movie actors (including a twenty-one-year-old Johnny 
Depp in his film debut) and was completed in just thirty-two days. Not 
bad for a movie that would gross over $25 million at the box office, and 
which, as of 2010, had inspired eight further films (including a remake).
The film opens inside a basement-cum-workshop, where a hideously 
scarred man wearing a red-and-green sweater and crusty old hat welds 
razor-sharp blades to metal fingertips and attaches these to a battered 
leather glove. As events unfold and secrets are revealed, we learn this is 
Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a former child killer who was burned 
to death by a mob of furious Elm Street parents. Years later, Freddy has 
returned from the grave as evil incarnate, obsessed with revenge on the 
adolescent offspring of those who ended his mortal life. Residing in his 
victims' subconscious, attacking them as they sleep, Freddy rewrites the 
laws of physics and carries out grotesque yet creative killings. Spectacular 
set pieces, laden with special effects wizardry and gallons of fake blood, 
are balanced by an anxiety-inducing score and a gripping narrative, as 
we feel for the intended victims in their hopeless battle to stay awake.
Unlike earlier slasher films like Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th 
(1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street's monster-murderer is less a silent death 
machine than an archetypal "evil trickster." This gothic antihero—a vicious 
killer with charm, a sense of humor, and a flair for the dramatic—proved 
immortal in a way even Craven can scarcely have envisaged.  SJS

Rob Reiner's made-up documentary ("mockumentary," if you will) dances 
on that "fine line between stupid and clever," taking elements from real 
rock docs (Don't Look Back [1967], The Last Waltz [1978]) and creating a 
new genre (later examples include The Blair Witch Project [1999] and Bob 
Roberts [1992]). Tap fans treasure favorite routines and lines: Derek Smalls 
(Harry Shearer) trapped in a stage pod or setting off an airport metal 
detector with the foil-wrapped cucumber in his underpants; the band 
getting lost backstage as they try to reach an eager audience ("Hello, 
Cleveland!"); the undersized Stonehenge triptych descending to be "in 
danger of being crushed by a dwarf"; the blank looks of the band when 
confronted with their backlist of bad reviews or a radio DJ's classification 
of Spinal Tap as "currently residing in the 'Where Are They Now?' file"; the 
arguments over the offensive cover of the Smell the Glove album; Nigel's 
(Christopher Guest) tour of his guitar and amp collection ("These go to 
eleven"); "It's called 'Lick My Love Pump'." 
And it's a collection of masterly cameos, from Fran Drescher as 
publicist Bobbi Flekman (her clones are still working in the business) to 
Bruno Kirby as the Sinatra-loving limo driver, with microbits from Billy 
Crystal and Dana Carvey as mime waiters ("Mime is money!"). Copping 
the Yoko thread from the 1970 Beatles film Let It Be, Spinal Tap delivers a 
genuine plot as childhood friends David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) 
and Nigel Tufnel fall out when David's girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone (June 
Chadwick) worms her way into the band as manager, displacing the 
long-suffering Ian Faith (Tony Hendra), who memorably characterizes 
the dim girl as dressing "like an Australian's nightmare." 
It's an achievement that after an hour of jokes at the expense of the 
group's crassness and stupidity, with hideously accurate parodies of rock 
dinosaurs ("Big Bottoms," "Sex Farm"), the film wrings emotion out of the 
threat that they will break up. McKean, whose London accent is letter-
perfect, has a great acting moment as he becomes so angry and hurt at 
his friend's betrayal that he can hardly speak—all the more remarkable 
given that most of the movie's dialogue was improvised.  KN

David Lean's final film found him just as obsessed with the widescreen 
tableau that defined Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Bridge on the River 
Kwai (1957), and Doctor Zhivago (1965). However, A Passage to India (not, 
admittedly, shot in CinemaScope) is clearly more a movie of ideas than 
a movie of spectacle. More or less faithfully adapting E. M. Forster's story 
of class and cultural conflict in colonial India, the film by necessity loses 
some of the internalized thrust of the multi-perspective novel, and 
therefore misses some of the nuance of its characters' motivations. It 
also, sometimes, comes across as a story of mystery and vague sexual 
hysteria rather than a biting adieu to British colonialism. But in the hands 
of Lean—the consummate craftsman—A Passage to India blazes by. If he 
too often relies on frequent collaborator Alec Guinness (conspicuously 
cast as an Indian) for humor and James Fox to make obvious the movie's 
themes, Lean's respect for the script and his actors allows them to 
transcend the sometimes romanticized depiction of India.
Particularly strong is the wan, Academy Award-nominated Judy 
Davis. In her search for the "real" India—the India neither homogenized 
nor shunned by her fellow Brits—she gets more than she bargained 
for in the form of Victor Banerjee, whose obsequious and oblivious 
Dr. Aziz sparks in the mind of Davis's naive Ms. Quested a primal aversion 
to "going native." As the country's relentless heat, claustrophobia, and 
chattering monkeys wear down Quested's banal enthusiasm, she grows 
increasingly unstable, leading to an encounter in the echo-enhancing 
Marabar caves that results in Aziz being accused of rape. 
If Forster's collision of psychology and colonialism comes across 
almost as an afterthought, the film's disdain for English condescension 
ultimately lends the trial of Dr. Aziz an ironic inevitability. A Passage 
to India ends on an appropriately and satisfyingly ambivalent note, 
implying that some of the film's central characters still haven't learned 
their lesson. It's not as forceful or thought-provoking a conclusion as it 
could (or should) have been, but the film remains a strong effort all the 
same, and a fine conclusion to an illustrious career.  JKl

Beverly Hills Cop  Martin Brest, 1984
703
What a different movie Beverly Hills Cop would have been had Sylvester 
Stallone—who was originally attached to the project—been the lead 
actor. The action would have been far bloodier no doubt, while the film 
would have lacked the rapid-fire comedy of its star, Eddie Murphy (hot 
from 1983's Trading Places), that made it a worldwide smash.
Murphy is Axel Foley, a smart-talking, streetwise Detroit detective 
who—like all the best movie cops—doesn't play by the rules. When an 
old friend is murdered, he heads to Los Angeles to investigate the crime, 
and inevitably causes a major upset among the Beverly Hills police (who 
presumably spend most of their time arresting celebrities).
Backed by a pop soundtrack and Harold Faltemeyer's annoyingly 
infectious "Axel F" theme, director Martin Brest—later to helm Midnight 
Run (1988), Scent of a Woman (1992), and Meet Joe Black (1998)—delivers 
a fast-paced, fish-out-of-water action comedy that takes sharp digs at 
the all-style-and-no-substance L.A. lifestyle. It also makes the most of a 
charismatic star, who has never been better. Many police action-comedy 
movies have followed, including two sequels also featuring Murphy, 
but none have felt as fresh as this one. In 2011, the star mooted the 
franchise's resurrection, this time on the small screen.  JB
The Killing Fields  Roland Joffé, 1984
Roland Joffé's morally earnest film depicts the disastrous aftermath 
of American involvement in Cambodian politics during the Vietnam 
War era. Future Law & Order mainstay Sam Waterston offers a bravura 
performance as New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, whose 
dispatches from the country revealed the dreadful results of the U.S. 
bombing campaign against suspected communist bases.
The Killing Fields divides into two parts. Schanberg's brave, perhaps 
foolhardy decision to remain even after the Khmer Rouge take the 
country occupies the first part. Schanberg's Cambodian assistant, Dith 
Pran (Haing S. Ngor, a former medical officer in the Cambodian army), 
assists a small group of Western journalists as they negotiate a series of 
harrowing encounters with the victors, but, despite their attempts to 
pass him off as a U.S. citizen, he is left behind when they leave. 
In the second part, Pran becomes the protagonist. With ingenuity 
and fortitude, he endures harsh captivity and evades death, escaping 
through rice paddies filled with the corpses of his countrymen—the 
"killing fields" of the title—until he is brought to New York, there to 
be reunited with Schanberg. Although the film effectively evokes the 
atmosphere of terror, confusion, and dislocation that war brings, it 
dwells on international politics, but on the damage done to human 
dignity by impersonal violence.  BP

1984

Three decades down the line, Jim Jarmusch's modus operandi seems 
pretty clear. His films reveal the way different cultures intersect, overlap, 
and interact in the modern world, and how differences often pale 
compared to the traits we all have in common. At the time, however, 
Stranger than Paradise seemed as weird as it did wonderful, a striking 
debut from a fiercely independent filmmaker. Jarmusch described it as, 
"a semi-neorealist black comedy in the style of an imaginary Eastern 
European film director obsessed with [Japanese filmmaker] Ozu, and 
familiar with the 1950s American television show The Honeymooners."
Though it doesn't have much of a plot, Stranger than Paradise is 
anything but loose. Willie, a New York slacker (John Lurie), is surprised 
by a visit from his Hungarian cousin Eva (Eszter Balint). Eva, stuck in his 
small apartment, then heads west to Ohio to visit her aunt (Cecillia Stark). 
With nothing better to do, Willie and his pal Eddie (Richard Edson) follow 
her. All three head to Florida together for one last stab at staving off 
boredom, but even the ocean can't stir them from a self-imposed stupor.
Stranger than Paradise is like a parody of the American dream, with 
Eva's grass-is-always-greener view of the nation dashed by the harsh 
discovery that the States can be just as plain and uneventful as any other 
country. But Eva is the only one of them willing to do anything about her 
stifling predicament. Willie and Eddie bring with them to Ohio, and then 
Florida, the same sense of monotony, like roving black holes sucking the 
life out of wherever they end up. Faced with such a fate, Eva has nothing 
better to do than escape, though Willie and Eddie realize she may be 
their own only escape as well.
Jarmusch sets most of his movie in claustrophobic rooms, keeping 
the camera relatively static as he captures the strangely banal exchanges. 
No one seems to be friends, yet since they're all in the same situation 
they make the most of their companionship. Nothing is keeping them 
in any one place, but nothing is drawing them out of their modest 
environs. America seems like a vast cultural purgatory, and even the most 
ambitious of his characters don't seem especially eager to get out.  JKl

When F. Murray Abraham appears in 
Last Action Hero (1993), a recurring 
joke is about him killing Mozart.
i
Amadeus  Milos Forman, 1984
Milos Forman's casting of American Tom Hulce (who had spots in Animal 
House [1978] and TV series St. Elsewhere under his belt) as the giggling 
German composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart contrasts with the period 
sets and details on display throughout this epic biopic. But Hulce's over-
the-top performance as the brilliant enfant terrible jibes with the theory 
that larger-than-life music must flow from a larger-than-life personality.
He cavorts and parades around as if acknowledging the silliness of his 
frilly frocks and colored wigs. Nevertheless, he propels the film at such 
a pace that his clownish attitude and incongruous accent hardly matter. 
Adapted by Peter Shaffer (in whose Equus Hulce had appeared on 
stage) from his own play, Amadeus sets Mozart's effortless creative strides 
against the simplistic compositions of his envy-ridden rival Salieri (played 
by an appropriately sour F. Murray Abraham). Salieri's bitterness is 
introduced for laughs, whereas Mozart is depicted as a womanizing fool. 
Yet the proof is in the latter's achievements, as revealed via the film's 
thunderous score and a generous staging of Don Giovanni. Although 
seeing even a portion of such a stirring work in the context of what 
amounts to a piece of pop art may seem strange, that may be the point. 
Forman seems nothing if not intent on contemporizing the life and 
accomplishments of one of history's greatest fonts of genius.  JKl

1985
Taiwan in the 1950s: Young Ah Xiao's life is an apparently endless and 
uncomplicated round of playing marbles, chasing chums, and listening 
to his grandmother's plans to return home to mainland China. After a 
first, shocking taste of death, however, life darkens and the boy turns 
into a brutish teenager, trapped between feelings of familial duty and 
the need to prove his worth among the local street gangs.
In many respects, Hsiao-hsien Hou's autobiographical coming-of-age 
movie marked a distinct advance upon his earlier A Summer at Grandpa's 
(1984). It paved the way for the considerably more complex narrative 
structure of City of Sadness (1989), with its deployment of an individual 
character study to explore the dynamics of Taiwanese society at a 
precise moment in time. What shapes Ah Xiao's early life is a community 
unsure of its own identity and future since the separation from the 
communist mainland, with conflicting emotions potentially leading 
either to delinquency and crime or, as in Hou's case, a more fulfilling 
adulthood. The direction is understated, reflective, and measured—in 
the style of Yasujirō Ozu, Hsaio-hsien Hou's acknowledged antecedent—
making all the more devastatingly powerful the paroxysms of agonized 
emotion when they are eventually allowed to ignite the screen. The film 
is a work of remarkable maturity, assurance, and clarity.  GA

In 1985, director John Huston, despite waning health, embarked on 
his fortieth film—a black comedy that examines what might happen 
if two assassins fell in love. Jack Nicholson stars as Charley Partanna, 
a none-too-smart hitman for influential New York Mob family the 
Prizzis. The godfather, Don Corrado (William Hickey), treats Charley 
like an adopted son since the Don's granddaughter Maerose (Anjelica 
Huston, daughter of the director and Nicholson's paramour at the 
time) did him wrong. Charley falls for smoldering blonde Irene Walker 
(bombshell du jour Kathleen Turner) at a wedding, but it turns out the 
soon-to-be lovers have been hired to kill each other.
Unusually—and refreshingly—the ending is what the story requires, 
not what the audience wants. Although the film was nominated for 
eight Academy Awards, Anjelica Huston was the only one to win, for 
best supporting actress. But Hickey, who was nominated as well, is the 
film's stealthy dynamo. Seemingly on his last legs, he makes such lines 
as, "Would you like a cookie?" both threatening and hilarious. Lawrence 
Tierney (who played the eponymous Dillinger in Max Dosseck's 1945 
film) also appears as a corrupt cop. Imperfect and ultimately depressing, 
Prizzi's Honor is nonetheless a comedic gem.  KK

Prizzi's Honor  John Huston, 1985

In the 1960s, teen movies involved Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, 
lots of sand (no sex), and bouncy music. In the 1970s, being a teen was 
about being slaughtered in your bed in numerous horror movies. But in 
1984 writer-director John Hughes revolutionized the teen genre with 
Sixteen Candles, and followed it a year later with The Breakfast Club, a 
movie credited with finally showing teens as they really speak and think.
No single film better epitomized the period, or has become more of 
a cult movie for teens, than The Breakfast Club. It made Hughes a name 
to watch—he went on to make the terrific Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) 
and hugely successful Home Alone (1990)—and brought together a 
skilled group of young actors (as did Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders 
two years before) that the media dubbed the "Brat Pack."
Five disparate teenagers are sentenced to a Saturday detention for 
various reasons and, despite their differences at the beginning of the 
day, they have formed some sort of bond by the end. There's the school 
jock (Emilio Estevez), the weirdo with the heavy eye-liner (Ally Sheedy), 
the stuck-up princess (Molly Ringwald, a teen fave and muse of Hughes 
following her lead role in Sixteen Candles), the nerd (Anthony Michael 
Hall), and the rebel (Judd Nelson), all trying to entertain themselves 
under the watchful eye of anally-retentive teacher Vernon (Paul Gleason).
A film that relies on cleverly scripted banter rather than action, The 
Breakfast Club works in large part because of the characterizations of the 
cast as truths are revealed, grudges are aired, and each one gets their 
moment to shine. Much imitated in numerous films and TV series, this 
ultimate teen movie has never been bettered—be it because of its 
perfect timing, sharp performances, quotable lines, or the 1980s time-
capsule soundtrack, featuring that classic Simple Minds song (written 
for the film) "Don't You Forget About Me."  JB

It's World War II in countryside near the Polish border. A boy (Aleksei 
Kravchenko) leaves his village to join the partisans fighting the invading 
Nazis. He gets separated from his unit and has to make his way home, 
only to find his entire village slaughtered, the bodies piled in a haphazard 
heap behind a farm. Lost, alone, and deafened, things can only get worse. 
No war movie matches Come and See for nightmarish relentlessness. 
There is no plot, only a terrifying picaresque journey as the boy wanders 
the countryside and encounters one horrific scenario after another. There 
are no feats of heroism or sacrifice, nor any stirring speeches exhorting 
people to fight. There is only death and brutality and randomness and 
victimhood. Survival is utterly arbitrary, and possibly a cruel, cosmic joke.
There are surrealist tableaus at once alien and strangely familiar. There 
are bursts of visionary weirdness that take your breath away—a partisan 
soldier, using mud, sticks, and a discarded Nazi uniform, constructs a 
totem for a mob of grieving widows and mothers to attack and tear apart 
in an act of catharsis; or when a field is illuminated by enemy tracer fire, 
leaving the young hero with no place to take cover except behind a cow. 
Events unfold like dream logic. There are moments when the movie 
switches to the boy's point of view and all sound collapses into a dull 
echo, duplicating his deafness after mortar shells explode around him.
Most war movies claim to be antiwar, but revel in gung-ho heroism. 
Come and See offers no such relief. It shows there are only victims.  AT

Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters  
Paul Schrader, 1985
Paul Schrader's extraordinary film about the Japanese writer-activist 
Yukio Mishima (played by Ken Ogata) is an anomaly, a lavish American 
art movie in the Japanese language (although Roy Scheider provides 
some spare English voice-over). Mishima was a narcissist, a revolutionary 
patriot, a samurai manqué, and arguably the most important Japanese 
writer of the twentieth century. The creator of Travis Bickle (from Taxi 
Driver [1976]) clearly sees himself as a kindred spirit, although the film is 
more than mere homage. Schrader flips through Mishima's many masks 
with great intelligence and clarity.
The film interweaves the events leading up to Mishima's final act 
of defiance—a grandstand attempt to reconcile art with action that 
involves kidnapping a general—with black-and-white biographical 
sequences showing the author's childhood, and three highly stylized, 
studio-bound dramatizations inspired by the writer's Temple of the 
Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House, and Runaway Horses. Made under the 
auspices of executive producers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas 
(a noted sinophile), Mishima is a film as illuminating and coherent as it 
is intricate and involved, boasting breathtaking production design by 
Eiko Ishioka, gleaming cinematography by John Bailey, and a powerful, 
pulsing score by Philip Glass.  TCh

Out of Africa  Sydney Pollack, 1985
Awesome landscapes nearly overpower this Best Picture winner, shot 
on location in Kenya. "Nearly," however, is the operative word, because 
Meryl Streep and Robert Redford bring to life an uncommon love story 
to counterbalance this absurdly beautiful spectacle.
Truly every frame is a marvel, every set piece a gem. Sydney Pollack's 
epic—based on the memoirs of Danish writer Karen Blixen, the author 
of Babette's Feast—is a sharply produced romance-cum-travelogue. 
(Nicolas Roeg planned to shoot another adaptation in the early 1970s.)
When Blixen (Streep, in a role also offered to Audrey Hepburn) is 
forced into a marriage of convenience with Baron Bror Finecke (Klaus 
Maria Brandauer, whom Pollack had admired in the 1983 Bond movie 
Never Say Never Again), her dowry affords him a farm in Kenya. Afflicted 
with wanderlust he disregards her, so she finds sustenance in the 
adventurer Denys Hatton (Redford). World War I interrupts the affair, as 
do other personal complications, after which the lovers continue falling 
in love. In the end, Bror's activities cause Karen's wealth to founder, and 
she is forced to bury Denys after a tragic accident.
Highlights include a safari via biplane, glimpses of naturally occurring 
wildlife, and the sweeping uplift of John Barry's thrilling score.  GC-Q

1985
Ran was made at the time Akira Kurosawa was turning seventy-five 
(and losing his eyesight). It is important to understand the wisdom 
and artistry that those years brought to the creation of this film, quite 
possibly one of the greatest ever made. Of the 1001 films one must see 
before dying, Ran is certainly in the top ten. The director has called it "a 
series of human events viewed from Heaven."
Kurosawa is unsurpassed in his mastery of film technique, and Ran's 
battle sequences are unequaled to this day. They are like a cinematic 
ballet, violent and bloody yet filled with tremendous beauty. The story 
is adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear, combined with an ancient 
Japanese legend of three arrows. This combination moves the Bard's 
tragedy into distinctly new territory. Lear's daughters are now sons and 
the emphasis is on revenge rather than catharsis.
The performances range from brilliant to something resembling 
utter perfection. The standout without question is Mieko Harada as 
Lady Kaede, one of Lord Hidetora's (Tatsuya Nakadai) daughters-in-
law—watching her slink across the floor of her palace, her silk gowns 
rustling on the soundtrack, is unforgettable. Nakadai as Lord Hidetora 
displays a fierce defiance that melts into despair. And Lear's fool is 
transformed into the jester Kyoami, beautifully played by transvestite 
Shinnosuke Ikehata, an accomplished Noh actor—the makeup and 
much of Ran's story is inspired by Noh drama and tradition.
Toru Takemitsu's minimalist score makes fine use of percussion and 
flute to accent the epic. A special emphasis is placed on silence during 
the battle scenes—a tactic far more effective than all the cannon roar of 
previous attempts at depicting war on screen.
Ran displays the wisdom of a lifetime in a "mere" two hours and 
forty minutes, during which time itself is simply suspended. As the 
jester Kyoami declares in the film's most often quoted line, "Man is born 
crying; when he has cried enough, he dies."  DDV
Ran  Akira Kurosawa, 1985
Kurosawa refused to discuss the film 
with Japanese journalists—who, he 
complained, asked "silly questions."
"A reason I couldn't 
shoot this film for so 
long was that producers 
complained that the 
ending was tragic."

Back to the Future  Robert Zemeckis, 1985
Michael J. Fox, already a TV heartthrob with the sitcom Family Ties, 
became a full-fledged movie star thanks to this time-traveling comedy 
adventure. He stars as Marty McFly, a seventeen-year-old who despairs 
of his pushover dad George (Crispin Glover), and so spends most of his 
time with eccentric inventor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc 
Brown's latest invention is a time-travel machine in the shape of a 
DeLorean car, and soon enough Marty finds himself speeding backward 
in time to 1955, where his parents have barely met let alone started the 
relationship that will lead to Marty's very existence.
A clever premise is enlivened by quick-fire direction from Robert 
Zemeckis (hot property after 1984's Romancing the Stone) and a superb, 
witty script. Marty—with the help of a much younger Doc Brown—tries 
to get back to the present without wreaking havoc on future events by 
altering the past (not as easy as it sounds when your unsuspecting 
mother-to-be has developed a crush on you). Fox is perfect as the teen 
trying to unite his parents so he can one day be born, and Lloyd is 
suitably foolish as the nutty scientist. Meanwhile, Glover and Lea 
Thompson (Marty's mom) have a great time playing their characters as 
both middle-aged parents and teenagers. A timeless adventure.  JB

Brazil  Terry Gilliam, 1985
The tale of bad feeling between Brazil creator Terry Gilliam and distributor 
Universal—in which the filmmaker resisted the studio's attempts to put 
out a severely truncated cut and eventually prevailed in getting his 
challenging picture released in the United States—has tended to soak 
up all the interest in this movie. But it has strengths (and weaknesses) 
quite distinct from any status it might retain as a near-political cause. 
Made in 1984, and in parallel with the Michael Radford film of George 
Orwell's eponymous novel, Brazil is set "somewhere in the twentieth 
century." Its imaginary but credible oppressive state combines the worst 
of 1940s British bureaucracy, 1950s American paranoia, Stalinist or fascist 
totalitarianism, and the ills of the 1980s (such as an obsession with plastic 
surgery). Whereas Orwell's Airstrip One is built on horribly effective state 
surveillance, the worst aspect of Gilliam's invented dystopia is that it 
doesn't even work: The plot is kicked off by a farcical mistake as a bug 
falls into a printer so an arrest warrant intended for terrorist heating 
engineer Tuttle (Robert De Niro) is applied to an innocent Mr. Buttle 
(Brian Miller). Meanwhile, the grimly utilitarian city is falling apart even 
without the possibly state-sponsored bombs that wreak carnage.
Like 1984's protagonist Winston Smith, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) 
is a mid-level functionary of the brutal state who comes through a 
romantic attachment to align himself with rebellion and winds up 
squashed and broken by a friendly torturer. Gilliam, however, is far more 
concerned with the imaginary than Orwell, and delivers a fantastical 
setting that is escaped from only by even more fantasy. Sam enjoys 
romantic flights of imagination (scored with the Latin-flavored title tune) 
in which he is an angelic superhero knight facing up to Gilliamesque 
creations—who seem like Pythonesque knock-offs from Japanese giant 
monster movies—in order to rescue a dream girl (Kim Greist).
Perhaps thanks to the involvement of cowriter Tom Stoppard, Brazil 
is a more dramatically engaging film than most of Gilliam's cartoonish 
efforts. The gruesome black humor and bizarre visuals (embodied by 
Katherine Helmond as a surgery-obsessed matron with a succession of 
shoe-shaped hats) exist alongside a credible—and horribly fact-based—
depiction of a regime that charges its victims for the electricity and labor 
that goes into their own torture, as represented by the family man 
specialist from "Information Retrieval" (Michael Palin) and the desperate, 
middle-management paper-shuffler (Ian Holm). 
In one thing, at least, Universal had a point—the film does run a good 
reel beyond its optimum length, with a few too many slapstick routines 
that take it close to conventional knockabout. Brazil's home stretch 
includes a gruesome funeral scene that addresses various subplots that 
have been developing in the "real" world of the film, before it is revealed 
to be the Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge-like fantasy of a dead man, as 
Sam's mind snaps under torture.  KN

Based on a novel by Manuel Puig, Brazilian director Hector Babenco's 
courageous exploration of political, psychological, and sexual issues 
within the confines of a high-security South American prison thanks Burt 
Lancaster in its ending credits. The project was initiated by Lancaster, 
who intended to star in the leading role that ultimately went to William 
Hurt. In a breakthrough performance, Hurt won an Oscar as Luis Molina, 
a window dresser imprisoned for homosexuality. Stagy and somewhat 
dated, the story itself still resonates, and Raul Julia's exceptionally 
believable performance is a match for the high camp of Hurt's Luis.
Tall, mannered, and effeminate, Luis shares an enormous prison cell 
with heterosexual political prisoner Valentin Arregui (Julia). To pass the 
time, Luis recounts in intricate, almost maddening detail a melodrama 
he saw some years before. In a series of nostalgically colored flashbacks, 
Sonia Braga plays a stereotypical French singer during World War II. 
Braga, who didn't speak English at the time, phonetically sounded out 
her words, lending an unreal aspect to the arch-satire. Beautifully 
groomed and extremely sensitive, she falls for a handsome blonde 
Gestapo officer. Despite being a member of the French Resistance, she 
is convinced by her lover that the Nazis are good people who only want 
to rid the world of misery. Devoted to his politics, Arregui takes exception 
to the story, but is gradually lulled by its telling—as long as Luis doesn't 
concentrate on descriptions of food or naked women. Luis is only 
concerned about the film's romantic details but he has his own secret. 
The warden is promising him early release if he can draw valuable 
information from his cellmate, with whom Luis has fallen in love.
Although largely of historical significance (homosexuality had rarely 
been portrayed in such terms in mainstream cinema), Hurt's performance 
goes beyond theatricality—his skill is keeping the character's real 
feelings hidden away under several layers of varying intensity. Even at 
the very end, the audience is unsure if he has betrayed Arregui or not. 
Considered the "gay Casablanca," Kiss of the Spider Woman's main virtue 
lies in its humanization of love in all forms.  KK

Geoff Murphy's The Quiet Earth is a distinctly New Zealand take on the 
classic last-man-on-Earth narrative that sprang from I Am Legend. 
Scientist Zac Hobson (Bruno Lawrence) awakens one morning to discover 
that he is alone in the world following a scientific project gone awry. 
Lawrence's initial thirty-six-minute solo performance is superb, as Zac 
vacillates between euphoria and despair at his isolation. Eventually he 
meets another survivor, Joanne (Alison Routledge), with whom he 
attempts a relationship. Their idyll is disrupted by a third survivor, Api 
(Pete Smith), an aggressive Maori and the third point in the love triangle.
The film's subject matter places it squarely within the sci-fi genre. But 
its treatment of the material makes it less akin to dystopias such as Mad 
Max (1979) and closer to an investigation of human relationships and 
interracial concerns. What particularly sets the film apart is Murphy's 
depiction of the depopulated world. The entire soundtrack was redubbed 
in a studio to remove any trace of sound. Zac's gradual breakdown is 
conveyed via striking collages of images: walking around in a ladies slip; 
driving trains as if they were part of a toy train set; a beautiful shot of 
him wandering in the rain playing the sax. The Quiet Earth does not 
appeal with ostentatious special effects—instead it is an intellectually 
stimulating, character-driven look into the human condition.  RDe

This sublime nostalgic comedy avoids the usual Allen formula of "goofy 
New Yorkers having trouble with relationships." Both Woody Allen and 
his famous neurotic monologue are absent this time, but fans of the 
writer-director needn't worry, because the hilarious one-liners and odd 
characters are still present. Above all, The Purple Rose of Cairo is about 
love, perhaps Allen's greatest love of all: for cinema.
A tribute to the magical powers of the screen, The Purple Rose of Cairo 
tells the story of Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a poor waitress who, during the 
Depression era, spends much of her time watching movies. "I forget my 
sorrows," confesses the young woman, who is terrorized by a rude and 
unemployed husband. Only by watching the brave and unbeatable 
heroes on screen can she resist the daily nightmare that is her life.
While Cecilia is watching, for the eighth time, a film entitled The Purple 
Rose of Cairo, the charming hero (Jeff Daniels) walks right off the screen 
to meet her, though the rest of the audience protests and asks for their 
money back. In a bid to prevent a financial fiasco, the film's Hollywood 
producers send the actor who performs the hero to seduce her. Although 
the fictitious character is gentle and romantic, the star who impersonates 
him is cynical and arrogant. Assuming both roles, Daniels ironically 
suggests the difference between the ideal and the real man. Charmed 
by both of them, Cecilia experiences an amazing metamorphosis from 
Cinderella to a beautiful princess, and Farrow's excellent performance 
makes us believe in a such a miraculous transformation.
The Purple Rose of Cairo—whose screenplay was Allen's fifth to be 
nominated for an Oscar—is a meditation on illusion. The film's conclusion 
is not cynical, as with his Deconstructing Harry (1997). Fiction can save 
our lives, Allen argues in Purple Rose, managing to convince us. Among 
the lines, Cecilia's unforgettable remark, "I met a wonderful man. He's 
imaginary, but who cares? You can't have everything you want," recalls 
the famous closing line, "Nobody's perfect," from Some Like It Hot (1959), 
and intensifies any belief we might have in cinema's magical powers.  DD

Viggo Mortensen filmed this before 
his big-screen debut Witness (1985),

the film is strictly about

An erstwhile participant in the French New Wave, Agnès Varda lacked 
some of the credentials of her former film critic peers like François 
Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. Rather, she came from a photography 
background and, although she didn't initially know a great deal about 
filmmaking, she quickly demonstrated a style of her own. Perhaps best 
known for earlier films such as Cléo de 5 à 7 (1962), a real-time wait for a 
woman to get the results of her cancer test, Varda actually veered back 
and forth between nonfiction and fiction filmmaking. Sans toit ni loi 
followed a long stretch of the former, which explains its hybrid merger 
of documentary style and more traditional cinematic techniques.
One morning, a farmer discovers the frozen body of a female drifter, 
Mona Bergeron, curled up in a field, her face blue and glazed with 
frost. Once the police arrive, Varda's own voice interrupts. She explains 
that little is known about her, then proceeds to enact a series of faux 
interviews and flashbacks, each revealing small facts and passing details 
of the doomed young woman. Nothing, of course, is really known about 
the drifter (played with icy disaffection by Sandrine Bonnaire). She is 
merely a construct of the director's elliptical narrative.
Yet Varda enlists the drifter as a metaphor for how little we ever 
actually know about many of the people we encounter on a day-to-day 
basis. Bonnaire's drifter comes across a number of people while in search 
of food and shelter, but she rarely makes an effort to know them. 
She's sullen and unthankful, slinking across the frigid French landscapes 
away from who knows what and toward her telegraphed tragic end. In 
the "interview" segments, characters recount bits and pieces of her 
behavior and demeanor but nobody can offer a complete picture of the 
enigmatic girl. Varda arranges each scene and bleak landscape with a 
photographer's eye, frequently placing her increasingly feral protagonist 
(and sometimes antagonist) at the margins of the frame—just as the 
mysterious Mona herself exists in the periphery of the world itself.  JKl

It might seem absurd, even outrageous, to include Claude Lanzmann's 
Shoah with the other films selected here, using the regular number of 
words to describe and discuss it. But with all its particularities, including 
its nine-hour length and the authentic genius inhabiting it, it is vital to 
consider Shoah as a film among films.
Lanzmann traveled the world for nearly ten years discussing Nazi 
extermination camps—not the concentration camps, not the Nazi system 
as a whole, not antisemitism as a process, but the specific places where 
death reigned, the inner circle of the Inferno. He collected testimonies 
from some of the very few survivors, several witnesses, and even former 
organizers of the mass murdering. He edited together these voices and 
images of the present, showing the bodies, the faces, the landscapes as 
they look now, forever haunted by this tragic past. At the same time, he 
made every viewer aware of the absolute impossibility of representing 
what happened in such places as Auschwitz, Birkenau, Sobibor, Treblinka, 
and Chelmno—not because it's forbidden, just because it's impossible.
"Many years before the film reached the screens in 1985," he told 
Haaretz, "I was so stunned by the enormity of the event that in some 
places I was certain that whoever had been involved in it—the victims, 
the witnesses, even the hangmen—had long ago died. As a result, every 
time I discovered that one of them was still living, this was for me an 
amazing revelation, like that of an archeologist who uncovers a rare find 
after months of patient and difficult searching."
Lanzmann accomplished several things of great importance. He 
invented a way of bringing back memories of the Holocaust's horrors 
without distorting what these horrors had been. He also gave a name to 
this process—the "Shoah" of the film's title—which is now widely used. 
But Lanzmann also achieved what one might call the essence of cinema: 
the highest degree of presence through a total absence. Absence of the 
millions of dead, of the past, of any evidence of remains, carefully 
eliminated by the murderers, of visual or audio archives. 
Shoah stands as the absolute answer to Jean-Luc Godard's plea for 
"not a just image, just an image." The discussion it generated confirms 
the importance of this extraordinary work of art.  J-MF

Intent on dispelling his distorted reputation as a creator of popular 
youthful fantasies, Steven Spielberg chose Alice Walker's story of an 
impoverished rural black community in the early twentieth-century 
American South as his vehicle for dramatic affirmation. Oddly enough, 
Spielberg's established skills as a director both help and hinder the 
project, as his knack for wry humor and glossy technical prowess fits 
uneasily with the material, which he toned down from Walker's novel.
But even if he bit off more than he could chew, The Color Purple 
still proved the director's willingness to take risks. He elicits powerful 
performances from Oprah Winfrey (making her big screen debut) and 
Danny Glover (still two years from Lethal Weapon superstardom), but 
his instincts proved particularly invaluable in the casting of the then 
relatively unknown Whoopi Goldberg. Her Celie rarely speaks but is full 
of emotion, relayed through Goldberg's impressive, Oscar-nominated 
performance that does more with a well-timed wide smile than most 
actors do with a showy monologue. 
Spielberg too often falls back on sentimentality, but promising 
glimmers of the director who would graduate to more mature works like 
Empire of the Sun (1987), Schindler's List (1993), and Artificial Intelligence: 
A.I. (2001) are there to be studied.  JKl

Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been working together since 1963, 
but it was A Room with a View, their 1985 adaptation of E.M. Forster's 
novel, that made the producing/directing team famous for a luxurious 
period style that would later be apparent in movies like The Remains of 
the Day (1993) and Howards End (1992).
Much of the credit for revitalizing the cinematic period drama should 
also go to the third member of their team, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who 
had previously worked with Merchant Ivory on Heat and Dust (1983) and 
here beautifully adapted the tale of a young woman's awakening from 
the novel to the screen. Lucy (Helena Bonham Carter) is the woman in 
question, who discovers much about life and love in the Tuscan 
countryside as she decides between prospective suitors George (Julian 
Sands) and Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis).
Sands, in his best screen performance, is passionate as George, 
kissing the demure Lucy in a yellow-tinted field of grass, while Day-Lewis 
hits just the right note as priggish Cecil (complete with oiled hair and 
annoying affectations). But it is Maggie Smith, as Lucy's dotty 
companion, and Denholm Elliott, as George's forward-thinking father, 
who stand out the most from a cast of superb actors in this stately and 
picturesque setting.  JB

Manhunter  Michael Mann, 1986
Based on Thomas Harris's bestseller Red Dragon, Manhunter introduced 
cannibalistic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (in the form of Brian Cox) five 
years before Anthony Hopkins's interpretation in the Oscar-winning 
The Silence of the Lambs.
Atmospherically and stylishly directed by Michael Mann (who 
at that time was best known for the television show Miami Vice and 
went on to direct Heat [1995]), Manhunter focuses on FBI man Will 
Graham (William Petersen), who is coaxed out of breakdown-induced 
retirement so that his special talent of connecting with the psyche of 
killers can be put to good use in tracking down a particularly gruesome 
serial murderer. However, in order to do that, he has to confront 
the last man he helped catch—Lecter—in his prison cell, even though 
it was Lecter's mind games that endangered Graham's sanity in the 
first place.
One of the most tense and disturbing thrillers of the 1980s (and 
obviously a template for Chris Carter's TV series Millennium, among 
others), Manhunter features gripping performances, not only from the 
chilling Cox and intense Petersen, but also from the supporting cast, 
which includes Kim Greist, Joan Allen, and Dennis Farina. If you thought 
The Silence of the Lambs was scary, you ain't seen nothing yet.  JB

"It's a strange world, isn't it?" Graphic sexual violence and Dennis 
Hopper's shocking portrayal of a sadistic psychopath holding a singer's 
family hostage for her acquiescent brutalization provoked a storm of 
controversy around David Lynch's dark, disturbing, dreamlike mystery. 
Lynch's depiction of the cruelty, sickness, and horror lying just beneath 
the surface of nice, clean, white-picket-fenced middle America is not 
exactly subtle, but it is remorselessly gripping, bold, and stylish. Blue 
Velvet combines an air of twisted mystery with ironic, satiric Americana 
and a singular, chirpy, lightly stylized tone. The same winning mixture of 
the repulsively strange with the cozily familiar, the artful and the artless, 
made Lynch's television series Twin Peaks the cultural phenomenon of 
1990 and strongly influenced numerous imitators.
Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are engaging as Jeffrey Beaumont 
and Sandy Williams, the naive youngsters caught up in the macabre 
relationship between Hopper's crazed, oxygen-tank-dependent 
kidnapper-killer and brave Isabella Rossellini's bruised Dorothy Vallens, 
the tormented cabaret singer at his never-tender mercy while he holds 
her husband and little boy captive. Lumberton is a sunny, dreary 
American Everytown, with its neat lawns and flowerbeds, its industrial 
core, and the colorless diner where Jeffrey and Sandy combine forces as 
amateur sleuths while love blossoms. But everything is off-kilter, from 
curious college boy Jeffrey's discovery of a human ear in a field and his 
anxious, dangerous adventures as a crime-busting voyeur to his stunned 
arrival on a bizarre death tableau. 
The scene in which Jeffrey, hiding in Dorothy's closet, witnesses 
Frank's frenzied rape of the blue-velvet-robed victim is most contentious 
but an undeniably arresting, classic example of Lynch's nerve. Clever use 
of innocuous pop ballads—most hauntingly the title song—laced 
through regular Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score 
heightens the atmosphere. And although he appears in only one scene, 
Dean Stockwell's performance as Frank's confederate Ben, with his 
deceptively camp bonhomie—miming to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams"—
almost rivals Hopper's for spectacularly sinister weirdness.  AE

The last and most expansive of the remarkably fine run of Woody Allen 
pictures that began with A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), 
Hannah and Her Sisters is Bergmanesque in inspiration, perhaps, but 
Renoir-like in tone, betraying the influence of both of those masters as 
it traces the shifts in various tangled relationships over the space of a 
single year. Set, as some of his other films are, in arty, upper-crust 
Manhattan, the film centers on three sisters (Mia Farrow, Barbara 
Hershey, and Dianne Wiest), the partners of the first two (Michael Caine, 
Max von Sydow), the first's ex-husband (Allen), and a few other friends 
and colleagues brought in to complicate the romantic "roundelay." Allen 
himself is less to the fore than usual, his customarily neurotic 
hypochondriac taking up rather less time and sympathy than Caine, 
waivering in his fidelity to Farrow thanks to an infatuation with the 
younger Hershey. Indeed, one of the delights of the film is the way Allen 
handles this broader-than-usual canvas; the characters are if anything 
more rounded than previously, even as the wider focus gives us more of 
a sense of a world outside the rather limited one at the film's core.
In many respects, of course, it's the same old cozily predictable 
situations, types, even gags as before, yet there is something quite 
Chekhovian about the piece: the delicate poignancy of the various 
emotional dilemmas; the awareness of a very real pain underlying the 
jokes; the grim, inevitable fact of death hovering all the while just off-
screen while Woody's own angst-filled jester faces a medical scare. The 
gags are not just one-liners, but wholly plausible in terms of character 
and plot—a quality done ample justice by one of the best casts Allen 
ever managed to put together. And unlike some of the other films, the 
tribute to the good things that make life just about worth living feels 
heartfelt in Hannah and Her Sisters rather than forced (even though Allen 
did indeed once consider a darker ending). A feel-good movie in the 
best sense of the word.  GA

She's Gotta Have It  Spike Lee, 1986
723
Spike Lee's debut feature, She's Gotta Have It is an exploration of the life 
of Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns), a young black woman living in 
New York City who worries that her sexual appetites make her a "freak," 
and who juggles relationships with three different men, none of whom 
can entirely satisfy her. Whereas the self-regarding male model and 
"buppie" Greer (John Canada Terrell) and the gangly, irresponsible, 
pattering Mars Blackmon (Lee) are almost one-note comical caricatures, 
the decent, caring, poetic Jamie (Tommy Redmond Hicks) is positioned 
to win the girl.
Jamie disrupts the black-and-white movie by staging a full-color 
musical number as a birthday present, and is the one who forces the big, 
expected confrontation scene that makes Nola reassess her life and 
commit to him. But he also, in effect, rapes her to make a point, and the 
smothering "happy ending" is undercut by Nola's own narration, which 
concludes: "I'm not a one-man woman. . . . There you have me." Usually 
characterized as a primarily African-American filmmaker, Lee is certainly 
willing to explore strata of black American life that are usually neglected 
in all the hood movies, but his approach to chat, insight, New York, and 
the human heart makes him kin also to Eric Rohmer, Martin Scorsese, 
and Woody Allen.  KN

Children of a Lesser God  Randa Haines, 1986
On paper, this sounds like a disease-of-the-week TV movie, but thanks 
to a skillful adaptation of the stage play on which it is based, and two 
superb central performances, Children of a Lesser God is instead a 
thought-provoking film that is also a genuinely affecting love story.
Sign-language teacher James Leeds (William Hurt) goes to work at a 
school for the deaf, and encounters a former pupil, Sarah Norman (Marlee 
Matlin), who is now employed there as a janitor. An angry young woman 
who had been one of the school's brightest students, Sarah is initially 
resistant to James's charms and methods—he encourages his deaf 
students to use their voices—but eventually relents and becomes his lover.
Matlin, who is hearing-impaired, gives a superb performance as 
Sarah (a performance that won her an Oscar), signing with such furious 
intensity that Hurt's translation of her sign language is often 
unnecessary as we can see her meaning in her face. Hurt delivers an 
understated turn (which is exactly what is needed to prevent the film 
from becoming sentimental), while director Randa Haines (who had 
previously won an Emmy for the 1984 television drama Something 
About Amelia) beautifully explores Sarah's world of silence, especially in 
a scene between James and Sarah in a swimming pool, where James 
can finally experience the world the way Sarah does. Lovely.  JB

Renaissance art. The film opens with Caravaggio dying at Porto Ercole, 
looking back over his life in decadent Rome and entertaining his ruthless 
patrons with tales of energy and life stolen from his companions of bars 
and back rooms. The acting, from Nigel Terry and Tilda Swinton to Robbie 
Coltrane and Jonathan Hyde, is superb, Christopher Hobbs's sets are 
visually stunning, and Simon Fisher-Turner's music is utterly compelling. 
Art becomes life becomes art as Jarman breathes biographical life into 
Caravaggio's greatest paintings while the artist reflects without any mercy 
on his own life split between the braying snobbery of the art world, and 
the exciting danger of a universe where violence and sex intersect.
The film is remarkable for the set pieces that recreate Caravaggio's 
masterpieces, for the scenes of chilling hilarity as the cardinals plot their 
deadly strategems, and for the extraordinary triangle composed of 
Ranuccio (Sean Bean), the prostitute Lena (Swinton), and Caravaggio 
(Terry). One of the few biopics of an artist to really show what's on the 
end of an artist's brush.  CM
Oliver Stone's directorial breakthrough came after a string of 
screenplays—including Midnight Express (1978), Scarface (1983), and 
Year of the Dragon (1985)—that resulted in controversial box-office 
successes. In stark contrast to the racist and reactionary politics of these 
earlier films, Salvador is an openly leftist attack on the American support 
of brutal, fascist repression in Latin America. Written with shamelessly 
melodramatic plot points at every dramatic turn, triggering emotional 
responses from the audience, and directed with an engaging kinetic 
force from the first to the last image, it stands as a model for Stone's later 
films. It is also the first in his series of history lessons, where an American 
Everyman faces the truth behind the official lie—the American dream, 
governmental propaganda, and so on—and gets to a point of no return 
at which he must re-evaluate his world view.
Salvador follows true-life journalist Richard Boyle (James Woods) and 
his DJ friend Dr. Rock (James Belushi) traveling to what they expect to 
be a hedonistic holiday in the sun with cheap sex, drugs, and rock-'n'-roll. 
Once there, however, they get caught up in a civil war so ugly that they 
cannot look away. Though the film fails to show the full scale of brutality 
in El Salvador during the "events that occurred in 1980-1981" (as is 
claimed by the opening notice), this journey into a living hell in the U.S. 
backyard stands as an uncompromising, shattering testimony to 
American foreign policy at its worst.  MT

A savage yet moving look at the Vietnam War, as seen through the eyes of 
a young soldier, Platoon remains one of the most powerful war movies ever 
made, and is one of writer-director Oliver Stone's most accomplished films.
The first of Stone's "Vietnam film trilogy"—the second and third being 
Born on the Fourth of July (1989) and Heaven & Earth (1993)—Platoon 
follows the experiences of nineteen-year-old Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), 
an idealistic, middle-class boy who volunteers for the army, unaware of 
the horrors to come. His letters home detail his relationships with fellow 
grunts and the two sergeants who divide the platoon—hippie Elias 
Grodin (Willem Dafoe), who uses drugs to escape the nightmares all 
around him, and dangerously violent Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger).
Platoon has a unique perspective on war in general and the Vietnam 
War in particular, largely because Stone himself served in the conflict 
and uses the film to relate his own experiences as a young soldier. In each 
scene he directs from every point of view, so the audience is never sure 
where the next attack may come from, creating a feeling of unease and 
discomfort as if you were really there, watching this horrific, chaotic 
encounter unfold around you. With the help of military advisor Dale Dye, 
he delivers a series of blistering, messy images of war—a war where there 
is no Hollywood hero but instead just a patriotic boy who slowly becomes 
disillusioned with all he believed he was fighting for. For Stone, it was a 
personal triumph after fighting for ten years to get his script made; for 
the audience, it is an unforgettable, authentic, modern classic.  JB

Long recognized as a leading figure of American independent cinema, 
writer-director Jim Jarmusch is well known for highly idiosyncratic, 
noncommercial films. Down by Law, his landmark feature from 1986, 
epitomizes this counter-hegemonic interest and style and unwinds 
inside a hermetically sealed creative universe divorced from the 
demands of box-office receipts or audience gratification.
The story of chance encounters and luck, Down by Law draws on the 
interrelated lives of Jack (John Lurie), a pimp; Zack (Tom Waits), an 
unemployed DJ; and Bob (Roberto Benigni), an Italian tourist. All end up 
incarcerated, with Jack and Zack fall guys for crimes they didn't commit, 
and Bob serving time for committing murder in self-defense. At first not 
particularly fond of one another, they each nevertheless undertake a 
friendship of circumstance, eventually escaping into the relative calm of 
rural America. It's as straightforward as that, with little embellishment.
Still, Jarmusch's shorthand matters because his purposes are often 
deceptively simple. Long takes predominate with in-depth compositions 
showcasing wonderfully expressive black-and-white film. Time-killing 
activities like card games frame and support the characters' lives. 
Everywhere touched by a sense of farcical adventure, the movie is 
nominally set in Louisiana, though it clearly reflects the world we know.
Often riding a thin line between amateur technique and professional 
brilliance, Down by Law avoids cliché-ridden expressions and the usual 
restrictions of space and place. In its length are domestic squabbles, the 
briefest of exposition to realize the prison setting, and an inexplicable 
escape through an underground sewer system, after which the film more 
or less works out a set of scenarios as if through improvisation.
For Jarmusch fans it's a must see. Even for his opponents it affirms 
the value of small-scale American film productions in opposition to the 
usual Hollywood fare. Regardless, Jarmusch draws his funding from 
German sources. Somehow his temperament, style, and commercial (dis)
interests resonate within this looming Teutonic tradition, embellished 
here by the noted cinematographer Robby Müller, who transforms a 
relatively shapeless plot into something undeniably beautiful.  GC-Q

Do ma daan  Tsui Hark, 1986
Peking Opera Blues
When the post-New Wave Hong Kong cinema of the 1980s was 
embraced in the West, admirers were entranced by its ability to construct 
populist entertainment with imagination, wit, and intelligence—qualities 
largely absent from Hollywood products of the era. Perhaps no other 
title from the Hong Kong boom years of the '80s contains these elements 
in such abundance as Peking Opera Blues, director Tsui Hark's gloriously 
gravity-defying historical epic that unfolds in an opera house circa 1913.
Weaving the aspirations of three female protagonists—a general's 
daughter with revolutionary affiliations (Brigitte Lin), an aspiring acrobat 
who strives to infiltrate her father's all-male opera troupe (Sally Yeh), and 
a scheming mercenary on the hunt for stolen jewels (Cherie Chung), Tsui 
also deftly interweaves a melange of film genres to encompass historical 
melodrama, bedroom farce, and wirework action spectacular.
The political themes and gender issues at work within the narrative 
of Peking Opera Blues provide a fascinating subtext for this classic of 
contemporary Hong Kong film. One can only reflect back on such a burst 
of pure cinematic pleasure with bittersweet nostalgia—Tsui's recent 
output has been a dire mess, Peking's charming trio of leading ladies 
have all retired from the screen, and the early-twenty-first-century Hong 
Kong film industry is in a catastrophic slump.  TCr

Le déclin de l'empire américain  Denys Arcand, 1986
The Decline of the American Empire
The first international success of Canadian filmmaker Denys Arcand, The 
Decline of the American Empire is a sardonic study in sexual mores where 
the sex is much more evident in talk than in action. In a lakeside country 
house, four male French-Canadian academics are preparing a gourmet 
meal and talking about sex. Meanwhile, the four women who will be 
their guests meet at a health club in the city—and talk about sex. Then 
they all assemble for dinner where the conversations—and the 
revelations—continue.
Early on, in a radio interview, one of the women asks whether the "frantic 
drive for personal happiness" is "linked to the decline of the American 
empire." Arcand's film ironically explores this question. All the characters, 
it seems, are hell-bent on finding happiness; yet everyone is frustrated 
and desperate, and their relationships are disaster areas. This, Arcand hints, 
is the fallout of a society where sexual gratification is elevated over all other 
values. Interactions between the characters—especially during the dinner 
party—are filmed like a battle, with shot and countershot; the dialogue 
is witty, erudite, and oblique. Decline is at once bleak and funny; we may 
not like these people, but they're ceaselessly fascinating to watch.  PK

Every male adolescent's dream—and every parent's nightmare—comes 
true on screen in writer-director John Hughes's teen comedy Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off, as the film's hero (Matthew Broderick) does all the things 
in just one day that most of us don't have the nerve to do in a lifetime.
Realizing one morning that "life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop 
and look around once in awhile, you could miss it," Ferris decides to skip 
school, and this time aims to make it count. Enlisting the help of his pal 
Cameron (Alan Ruck), Ferris "borrows" Cameron's father's prized Ferrari, 
performs "Twist and Shout" during a city parade (in one of the movie's 
most memorable scenes), catches a game at Chicago's Wrigley Field, and 
scams his way into a high-class restaurant.
Like previous Hughes movies such as The Breakfast Club (1985), Pretty 
in Pink (1986), and Sixteen Candles (1984), adults here don't understand 
the teenagers in their care, be it Ferris's parents or the high school dean 
(Jeffrey Jones) who has made it his mission in life to catch Ferris in the 
act of doing something he shouldn't be doing. The grown-ups are just 
bystanders, the film really belonging to the supporting cast of Ruck 
(who was thirty playing the teenage role of Cameron), Jennifer Grey (as 
Ferris's bitter sister, who is sick of her popular brother), Mia Sara (Ferris's 
girlfriend Sloane), and, most of all, Matthew Broderick (nominated for a 
Golden Globe) as the adorable, exuberant lead.  JB

Aliens  James Cameron, 1986
"Get away from her, you bitch!" Sigourney Weaver's Lt. Ellen Ripley gets 
madder when maternal and becomes the greatest sci-fi action heroine 
ever in James Cameron's sensational follow-up to Alien (1979). One of 
cinema's greatest sequels, Aliens picks up Ripley (and Jones the cat) being 
recovered in the escape craft. The snag is that it's fifty-seven years later 
and, besides having a trying time explaining what happened to the 
Nostromo, Ripley is appalled to learn that the site of their disastrous 
discovery (planet LV 426) has been colonized. Inevitably something bad 
happens there and the traumatized Ripley is sent back with an 
untrustworthy company man, a team of swaggering Marines (including 
Cameron favorites Michael Biehn, Bill "Game over!" Paxton, plus Jenette 
Goldstein's terrific tough cookie Vasquez), and another ambiguous 
android (Lance Henrikson as Bishop).
If Alien was a haunted-house-in-space frightener, Cameron's relentless, 
furiously intense thrill-ride (winning the franchise's second effects Oscar) 
is the fort under siege in space, with the dwindling band and resourceful 
orphan Newt (Carrie Henn) beset by an implacable multiplicity of H.R. 
Giger's formidable, acid-drooling, giant foe and the mother of the species.

Even in his earliest films, director David Cronenberg imagined how 
advances in science, medicine, and technology (and often a fusion of the 
three) might alter human behavior. The Fly takes that fusion to its literal 
extreme, and while the movie exemplifies horror in the strictest sense, 
in actuality Cronenberg plays it like a twisted love story.
Retaining the bare-bones premise of the 1958 B-movie original with 
Vincent Price, The Fly stars Jeff Goldblum as a scientist who designs a 
matter transporter, a means to disassemble matter in one location and 
reassemble it in another. Much to the dismay of his lover, Geena Davis, 
one night Goldblum tests the machine on himself. Something goes 
wrong. Goldblum's DNA is accidentally fused with that of a common 
house fly, and while the genetic alteration at first enhances Goldblum's 
senses, it quickly results in a battle of genetic dominance between the 
two disparate species.
Cronenberg has never shunned visceral impact, and as Goldblum 
begins his transformation from human to human-fly hybrid, The Fly 
features a nonstop escalation of increasingly nasty special effects. Tough 
hair sprouts up in strange places. Goo oozes from every orifice. Body parts 
wither and fall off only to be replaced by mysterious new appendages. 
Rob Bottin's array of repulsive prosthetics threatens to take center 
stage, and indeed his vomitous effects are played not only for shock but 
also for perverse humor. But as disgusting as this central transformation 
sounds (and is), Cronenberg and his capable cast somehow infuse it with 
real emotion. Davis struggles with Goldblum's gross transformation to 
connect with the man she once knew, while Goldblum struggles to retain 
his humanity as his free will is subsumed by instinct.
Alas, all of this can only end one way, as the sweet romance is 
destined to be squashed by fate's fly swatter. Cronenberg therefore plays 
his tragedy for maximum pathos, and thanks in no small part to the 
chemistry of its leads and the plausibility of their against-all-odds 
relationship, rarely has such a stomach-churning series of events resulted 
in so many shed tears.  JKl

Applications to the U.S. Navy's fighter-pilot program rose considerably 
after the release of this testosterone-fueled homage to the men who feel 
the need for speed, and it isn't hard to see why. Tom Cruise, in the role 
that turned him from teen pinup to megastar, is Maverick, a pilot at the 
Top Gun school in San Diego, California. He isn't great with authority, 
butting heads with superior officer Michael Ironside, and has intimacy 
issues, which cause problems when he falls for his aeronautics instructor 
(Kelly McGillis).
Cruise's macho but deep-down-I'm-sensitive performance appealed 
to the female audience, thanks especially to his barroom serenade of 
"You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin'" (a 1964 number one hit by The Righteous 
Brothers) to a bemused McGillis. But the impressive flight scenes are the 
real reason to appreciate the film. Director Tony Scott, at his best when 
directing fast-paced action (movies like The Last Boy Scout [1991] and 
Days Of Thunder [1990]), spends the briefest amount of time on the 
somewhat predictable romance and personal conflicts to pack the film 
with realistic dogfights and dazzling aeronautic displays. An enjoyable 
example of the archetypal 1980s action flick, Top Gun also contains a hit 
rock soundtrack and a host of young actors (including Meg Ryan, Val 
Kilmer, and Anthony Edwards) who all went on to become big stars.  JB

Stephen King's short story The Body—a nonhorror ode to boyhood 
friendships—is beautifully adapted for the screen by director Rob Reiner 
and screenwriters Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. In Stand by Me, 
quiet Gordie (Wil Wheaton), daring Teddy (Corey Feldman), pudgy Vern 
(Jerry O'Connell), and group leader Chris (River Phoenix) are the four 
boys who spend the summer of 1959 doing nothing much more than 
hanging out at their treehouse until the day Vern announces that he 
knows where they can find a dead body. Intrigued to see what a corpse 
looks like, the friends set off on a long walk to find it.
A tale of friendships—related by a grown-up Gordie (an uncredited 
Richard Dreyfuss)—set against the beautiful Oregon scenery (standing 
in for the novel's Maine location), Stand by Me expertly depicts the fears, 
games, catchphrases, debates ("Mickey is a mouse, Donald is a duck, 
Pluto is a dog. What's Goofy?"), and secrets shared by young boys, 
whereas Kiefer Sutherland's older, meaner Ace gives a taste of what 
could be round the next corner in their lives. Beautifully played by the 
young cast, and lyrically directed by Reiner.  JB

Sherman's March  Ross McElwee, 1986
Ross McElwee's Sherman's March could be seen as the Citizen Kane (1941) 
of the diary film genre (a genre inspired by the arrival of small, high-
quality recorders in the 1970s). Like Kane, it was hailed as something 
utterly new in American cinema, but its greatest achievement lay less in 
its originality than in the way it perfected techniques and approaches 
already present in earlier film diaries. McElwee originally set out to make 
a film about the lingering effects of the South's defeat in the Civil War, 
but a break-up with his long-time girlfriend just before shooting began 
found his return home becoming equally an attempt to find romance.
Unlike the cinema verité films of the early 1960s, with their invisible 
camera crews, Sherman's March has McElwee constantly interacting with 
the subjects in front of his camera. He is remarkably talented at making 
people unselfconscious as he films them, never stooping to the cheap 
shot, or assuming an attitude of condescension.
Over the course of the film, he embarks on a few tentative attempts 
to create a relationship. None work out and some fail hilariously. His 
voice-over commentary becomes increasingly self-critical, until in an 
exceptionally poignant moment he finally wonders aloud whether he's 
filming his life or filming so he'll have a life. Yet Sherman's March is never 
heavy, and one leaves it moved at the recognition of how effectively 
McElwee has captured the spirit of contemporary romance. It may look 
"simple," a kind of glorified home movie, but what makes it art is 
McElwee's generous spirit, good humor, and remarkable candor.  RP

Tampopo  Juzo Itami, 1986
Juzo Itami's second comedy represents a quantum leap from his first, 
the 1984 The Funeral. Without abandoning his flair for social satire, Itami 
expands his scope here to encompass the kind of free-form narrative 
play we associate with late Luis Buñuel. His subjects are food, sex, and 
death, his ostensible focal point the opening of a noodle restaurant. He 
takes us on a wild spree through an obsession, winding his way through 
various digressions with a dark wit that is both hilarious and disturbing. 
The title heroine (Nobuko Miyamoto) is a widowed mother 
determined to master the art of ramen with the aid of a mentor. Her story 
is interlaced with that of a nameless wealthy gangster, accompanied by 
a mistress, who is preoccupied with food, sex, death, and cinema. We 
initially see the gangster sitting down in a movie theater before a 
sumptuous array of food, ostensibly preparing to watch the story of 
Tampopo. Various digressions extend these themes to incorporate such 
Japanese standbys as deception, poverty, family, and guilt.
As in The Funeral, Itami's ultimate interest appears to be in exploring 
as well as ridiculing some of the paradoxes of Japanese society, including 
those involving class and etiquette, and he carries this off with energy 
and inventiveness.  JRom

Dao ma zei  Tian Zhuangzhuang, 1986
The Horse Thief
Tian Zhuangzhuang's second feature, set in the remote wilds of Tibet, is 
a breathtaking spectacle in scope and color. Tian's originality and 
mastery of sound and image communicate directly, beyond the 
immediate trappings of the film's slender plot and regional culture, 
expressing an environmental and ecological mysticism that suggests a 
new relationship between man and nature. The relatively small roles 
played by dialogue and story line, and the striking handling of 
composition and superimposition, make The Horse Thief evocative of 
certain 1920s Westerns, though it is far from being a silent film: The 
chants, percussion, and bells of Buddhist rituals and the beautiful music 
score are an essential part of the film's texture.
Tian's intention was to make the film timeless. However, government 
authorities insisted that the date 1923 be flashed on the screen before 
the first image, placing the action in a specific period. They also required 
the elimination of corpses from the first of the film's three "sky burials." 
But the story—a parable about a reluctant thief who, in order to feed his 
family, becomes a more methodical thief, albeit a social outcast—
remains intact, and the modernist style was similarly untampered with, 
despite the fact that the film was barely seen in mainland China because 
of its focus on a minority culture and its overall eclecticism.  JRos

How close this avowedly autobiographical film is to the precise facts can 
only be gauged by the intensity of the recollected emotion and guilt 
that it conveys. Julien (Gaspard Manesse) is a twelve-year-old pupil in a 
Catholic boarding school in Nazi-occupied France. Apart from the 
welcome distractions of air-raid warnings, the war makes little impact 
on the daily routines of school life, and when three new kids arrive, they 
are submitted to the ritualistic antagonism of infant communities to 
strangers. Julien, himself something of an outsider, strikes up a 
friendship with one of the new boys, Jean (Raphael Fejtö). As they grow 
closer, he discovers that the newcomers have all adopted false names, 
though he only gradually and vaguely grows to understand the 
enormity of anti-Semitism, and that the Catholic fathers are endeavoring 
to shelter these endangered children. When the net grows tighter, it is 
an inadvertent action by Julien himself that betrays the Jewish children 
and sends them to an inconceivable fate. We realize that this moment 
will never cease to torment Julien.
Writer and director Louis Malle (The Lovers [1958], Murmur of the 
Heart [1971], Atlantic City [1980]), is not concerned with Hollywood-style 
war melodrama but with the life of the school—the daily drags and 
discoveries, the eccentric habits of schoolmasters, friendships, and 
suspicions. The war impinges in the air-raid warnings, and the puzzle 
that the occupying Nazis are, like any other group, a dangerous mix of 
goons and gentlemen.
Malle genuinely sees it all through the boys' own acute but still 
unformed vision, and the performances of Manesse and Fejtö are so 
moving precisely because of the open honesty that compensates for 
technical expertise. Malle's most personal film, Au revoir les enfants was 
the recipient of a slew of international awards (among them the Golden 
Lion at the 1987 Venice Film Festival), and represented a triumphant 
swan song in a career that had faltered somewhat since its brave 
beginnings in the era of the New Wave cinema.  DR

Raising Arizona  Joel Coen, 1987
The Coen brothers' enormously inventive second feature abandoned the 
noir mood of Blood Simple (1984) for this larger-than-life (but likewise 
intricately plotted) comedy featuring cartoon-style caricature. Nicolas 
Cage is the convenience-store robber, forever in and out of jail, who falls 
for and weds prison officer Holly Hunter; their somewhat improbably 
blissful trailer-park marriage is blighted when they find she's infertile 
and, to keep her happy, he kidnaps one of the quintuplets born to a local 
unpainted-furniture tycoon. As if it weren't bad enough that the father 
hires the biker from hell (Randall "Tex" Cob) to bring back his baby and 
wreak vengeance on the abductors, Cage's fortunes take a turn for the 
even worse. Much to his wife's anger, he is visited by escaped former 
cellmates John Goodman and William Forsythe, who have plans of their 
own for the famously missing infant.
The farcical improbabilities of Raising Arizona are as nothing to the 
absurdly overpoetic voice-over the Coens brilliantly concoct for their 
hapless and none-too-bright hero. The film is as fervently and intelligently 
in love with tacky excess as anything dreamed up by Preston Sturges. 
Indeed, some of the camera pyrotechnics may actually distract attention 
away from the deliciously witty dialogue, but overall the aura of heady 
hysteria is sustained with considerable expertise, not least in the perfectly 
pitched performances.  GA

Yeelen  Souleymane Cissé, 1987
Brightness
735
Brightness, an extraordinarily beautiful and mesmerizing fantasy by 
Souleymane Cissé, is set in the ancient Bambara culture of Mali (formerly 
French Sudan) long before it was invaded by Morocco in the sixteenth 
century. A young man named Niankoro (Issiaka Kane) sets out to 
discover the mysteries of nature—or komo, the science of the gods—
with the help of his mother (Soumba Traore) and uncle (Ismaila Sarr). But 
Soma (Niamanto Sanogo), Niankoro's jealous and spiteful father, 
contrives to prevent him from deciphering the elements of the Bambara 
sacred rites and tries to kill him.
Apart from creating a dense and exciting universe that should make 
George Lucas green with envy, Cissé shoots his breathtaking images in 
Fujicolor and accompanies his story with a spare, hypnotic, percussive 
score. Quite possibly the greatest African film ever made, sublimely 
mixing the matter-of-fact with the uncanny, this wondrous work won 
the Jury Prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. In all, Brightness provides 
an ideal introduction to a filmmaker who is, next to Ousmane Sembène, 
probably Africa's greatest director.  JR0s
"A" gai waak juk jaap  Jackie Chan, 1987
Project A, Part II
The setup is simple: Director and star Jackie Chan plays a hotshot in the 
Royal Hong Kong Navy at the turn of the last century. He sets out to quash 
a band of marauding pirates preying on ships off the South China coast. 
There are good guys and bad guys. Do we doubt that the hero will 
triumph over the bad guys? Of course not. Let's face it, we don't watch a 
Jackie Chan movie for the plot. The plot is only a framework, an excuse 
for Chan to present us with one mind-blowing set piece after another.
For Chan, his immediate environment frequently becomes both 
playground and endurance course. The architecture and objects at hand 
might help or hurt him as he ducks, dodges, rolls, and weaves to get 
away from the inexhaustible supply of bad guys always in pursuit. 
Watching him evade, jump, spin, and improvise his way out of a savage 
beating is to experience the joy and exhilaration of meticulous comic 
timing and old-fashioned slapstick. He makes it look easy, but the 
outtakes that run under the end credits (a tradition in Jackie Chan 
movies) reveal the set pieces to be painstaking, dangerous work. 
But why the sequel rather than the original movie? Project A, Part II 
follows the dictum of being "the same, only bigger," and it is here that 
one finds Chan at the peak of his powers as a filmmaker, a choreographer, 
and a martial artist, when he was still young, fast, and agile, before age 
and broken bones inevitably began slowing him down.  AT

Der Himmel Über Berlin  Wim Wenders, 1987
Wings of Desire
Cowritten with Peter Handke, Wim Wenders's sumptuous fantasy Wings 
of Desire encompasses the division of Berlin, the effects of the Holocaust, 
and the ultimate beauty of life, daring to make a choice between two 
worlds—that of humans and that of their unseen but palpable guardian 
angels—via Damiel (Bruno Ganz), an angel who falls in love with a 
mortal. Atmospheric, elegiac, and patiently paced, the film was critically 
acclaimed and won honors at many film festivals, including the Best 
Director prize at Cannes upon its release.
As in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1946 classic A Matter 
of Life and Death, Wenders's heaven is shown in crisp black and white, 
whereas the human world springs to life in vivid color, aided by the work 
of legendary cinematographer Henri Alekan, who also photographed 
Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946). High atop buildings or upon 
the shoulders of statues, angels are watching. Wearing trenchcoats and 
Mona Lisa smiles, they are invisible except to children and the occasional 
blind person who senses their presence. The angels see everything, feel 
everything, and so appear at mortals' sides at times of worry, frequenting 
lonely bedrooms, libraries, and accident scenes. Although unable to 
directly affect the actions of humans, the angels may lend a glimmer of 
hope where before there was only darkness.
But when the broad-faced angel Damiel goes to the aid of Marion 
(Solveig Dommartin), a beautiful trapeze artist who fears she will fall, he 
begins to long for the simple things humans take for granted: to touch, 
to hold, to be seen. On a dank film set around the ruins of Berlin, Peter 
Falk (playing himself) is a mysterious man: He is the actor famous for TV's 
Columbo, but he is also the only human who openly greets Damiel. At a 
coffee stand Falk extends his hand to the angel, saying "I can't see you, 
but I know you're here," without explaining how he knows the 
unknowable. Second-guessing the audience, Wenders allows Falk to be 
obliquely referred to twice as "Columbo," a device that amuses and jolts 
the viewer, making a soothing film experience suddenly less of a reverie 
and more of a reality. Inspired by Falk's recognition, Damiel decides "to 
take the plunge" and literally falls to his own mortality.
Inspired by the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, Wings of Desire's slow 
heartbeat pace is essential to the feel of the story. It takes the time to 
fully examine questions only children ask, such as "Why am I me and not 
you? Why am I here and not there? When did time begin and where does 
space end?". Its slow tempo draws the audience inevitably into a world 
where priorities become clearer and life in general more hopeful. A 
languid, profound, and gentle "message" movie, its popularity demanded 
a sequel, Faraway, So Close! (1989), as well as an inevitable reshaping by 
Hollywood into the schematic romantic drama City of Angels (1998), 
starring Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.  KK

Bruce Robinson's subsequent films may so far have proved a 
disappointment, but nothing can diminish the wonderfully idiosyncratic 
delights of his debut, a ruefully nostalgic comic account of living in 
partly self-imposed poverty and squalor in late-1960s Camden Town.
Richard Grant is appropriately and hilariously acerbic and theatrical 
as Withnail, the upper-middle-class reprobate slumming it while (vainly 
and not very often) trying to find work as an actor, and Paul McGann is 
equally effective as his quieter, slightly more conscientious and pretty 
young flatmate (the "I" of the title). Leaving behind the squalor of their 
unwashed North London slum for a cheap holiday in the Lake District in 
a cottage owned by Withnail's porcine gay uncle Monty (Richard 
Griffiths), the impoverished, booze-and-drugs obsessed pair find 
themselves bemused, bewildered, and even besieged by country ways 
and avuncular lusts.
Withnail and I is more or less a one-off, its representation of a story 
("I" eventually sees the error of Withnail's eternally irresponsible ways 
and moves on toward a grown-up career) taking second place to the 
very funny verbal and visual gags, the oh-so-slightly grotesque 
exaggeration that underpins the comic remembrance of things past, 
and reveling in (revulsion for?) the colorful characters. Amazingly, it 
all—even the "Camberwell Carrot" joint—rings frighteningly true.  GA

The Princess Bride  Rob Reiner, 1987
739
Rob Reiner's friendly fairy-tale adventure The Princess Bride delicately 
mines the irony inherent in its make-believe without ever undermining 
the effectiveness of the fantasy. The framing device is a grandfather 
(Peter Falk) reading a favorite book aloud to his skeptical grandson (Fred 
Savage), and Reiner uses the grandson's initial recalcitrance as both a 
challenge and a safety net. In the imaginary kingdom of Florin, the 
beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) is separated from the farmhand she 
loves (Cary Elwes), betrothed to the evil Prince Humperdinck (Chris 
Sarandon), and spirited away by the nefarious Vizzini (Wallace Shawn).
The colorful characters and adventures are, at their best, like live-
action equivalents of Disney animated features, with lots of other fond 
Hollywood memories thrown in. Andre the Giant seems a cross between 
Andy Devine and Lumpjaw the Bear. Mandy Patinkin's engaging Inigo 
Montoya conjures up Gene Kelly in The Pirate (1948). Not even the crude 
ethnic humor—Billy Crystal's Mel Brooks-ish Miracle Max—pricks the 
dream bubble, and the spirited cast has a field day. The film was adapted 
by William Goldman from his novel of the same name, with Christopher 
Guest as a six-fingered sadist, Peter Cook as a lisping clergyman, and 
Carol Kane as Max's wife.  JRos

1987
When it comes to fantasy filmmaking, Hong Kong can make Hollywood 
look imaginatively bankrupt. This 1987 cult classic suggests a 
combination of Sam Raimi, Jean Cocteau, Georges Méliès, and Tim 
Burton. It's a ghost story that is also a love story, a sword-and-sorcery 
tale, and a comedy. Leslie Cheung stars as a naive young debt collector 
who falls in love with the enigmatic beauty (Joey Wong) haunting an 
abandoned temple. Unfortunately, she's a ghostly handmaiden for an 
ancient tree spirit who feeds on living souls—so, with a Taoist 
swordsman (Wu Ma) protecting him, Cheung ventures into the 
netherworld to save his love from a fate worse than death. This picture 
is gorgeous to look at, especially in the velvety nocturnal sequences 
when skeletons stir, spirits come out to play, and it seems anything can 
happen and probably will. The special effects are indeed extraordinary: 
People fly through the air, their robes flowing, blades flashing in the 
moonlight (these are stunts, remember, not optical process shots); an 
evil tongue rolls out and slicks through the room like an obscene elastic 
slug; while hell itself is a bravura chamber of horrors. The film's broad, 
amiable slapstick doesn't really play, but its surprisingly lyrical, sensual 
romanticism is effective, and there's so much to enjoy that overlooking 
the sometimes clumsy storytelling is easy.  TCh

Full Metal Jacket  Stanley Kubrick, 1987
In Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975), the major battle scene depicts an 
engagement that the narrator tells us did not make the history books, 
"though it was memorable enough for those who took part." When he 
came to make a movie about Vietnam, a little after the various angst-ridden 
and fantastical takes by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now [1979]) and 
Oliver Stone (Platoon [1986]) had established an acid/napalm-haze 
cinematic vocabulary for that war, Kubrick built on this approach. Full Metal 
Jacket presents a grunt-level world in which all officers, commissioned or 
not, are ridiculous but deadly alien beings (even hookers, we're told, are 
"serving officers in the Vietcong") and the trudging, heroic Marines of so 
many Take the High Ground! (1953) kind of pictures are nicknamed kids 
without a clue of where they are or what they're doing.
Based on The Short-Timers, an autobiographical novel by Gustav 
Hasford, with script input from Michael Herr (author of Despatches and 
the Apocalypse Now voice-over), Full Metal Jacket is ruthless, comic, 
horrific, and affecting in equal measure, depicting areas of the war rarely 
glimpsed in movies. A long opening act is set entirely on Parris Island, 
the induction-and-training center: After a montage in which long-haired 
young men are shorn to become bald drones no more distinguishable 
than the future folk of George Lucas's THX 1138 (1971), the film is 
commandeered by the astonishing R. Lee Ermey as drill sergeant 
Hartman, whose obscene, inventive, relentless abuse against all the 
recruits ("I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass 
and not even have the goddamned common courtesy to give him a 
reacharound") is designed to break down the "maggots" totally before 
they can be rebuilt as killing machines. In a lecture, Hartman takes pride 
in the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald and Charles Whitman learned to shoot 
in the Marines. The horrible irony of this sequence—which closely 
parallels the gladiator-training regime of Spartacus (1960)—is that the 
logical payoff is the transformation of a pudgy foul-up (Vincent d'Onofrio) 
into one of Kubrick's grotesque ape-men, with a primal glare that echoes 
the droogs of A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Jack Torrance (Jack 
Nicholson) of The Shining (1980). The first thing the new-made Marine 
does is murder his tormentor-creator and kill himself.
After this, the Vietnam sequences are almost a relief, as Private Joker 
(Matthew Modine), a journalist, unbends a little only to be confronted 
with even more demented individuals—when asked how he can kill 
women and children, a helicopter gunner gives a technical answer, while 
a colonel remarks, "Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is that they obey 
my orders as they would the word of God." The climax is a skirmish during 
a battle in the rubble of Hue City, in which Joker's platoon encounter a 
female Vietcong sniper: Nobody wins the encounter, and the Marines 
troop off into the night singing the Mickey Mouse Club marching song. 
Only Kubrick would dare tweak Disney like this.  KN

An invitation to the 1984 Democratic Convention inspired the hectic spirit 
of James L. Brooks's fast-paced 1987 media romance. A former CBS 
television newsman himself, Brooks puts a career twist into the classic 
concept of screwball comedy. This time, the story centers on the 
unpredictable outcome of a love triangle between three ambitious and 
talented people who are made more emotionally fearful within the high-
pressure confines of network news. A film about love, it is also about lovers 
who think that the only safe love affair is the one they have with their work.
Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) is a petite and tidy news producer who 
comes in early to have a cry at her desk every morning. Working in the 
Washington bureau of a TV network, she runs her newsroom as a 
meritocracy. Infatuated with Jane, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) is a good 
reporter with a few strikes against him: The camera doesn't love him, nor 
apparently does Jane. Tom Grunick (William Hurt at his most affable and 
calculating) is everything Aaron is not—charming, telegenic, and not 
too smart. Jane, torn between both men emotionally, is forced to make 
a decision which lies at the heart of Broadcast News's brilliance: When 
the going gets tough, the tough do nothing. Sometimes work is an easier 
option than being emotionally honest; in fact, loving work is often the 
most emotionally honest decision there is.
Co-starring Joan Cusack (famous for her bad hair and makeup as 
much as her memorably awkward, headlong dash to get a video tape to 
the newsroom in time), a delightfully slick Jack Nicholson appears in an 
uncredited supporting performance as the network's head anchorman, 
a professional who sees that Grunick is one of his own kind.
As "news" itself has become the show business of which Altman was 
so fearful, the earnestness and time devoted to TV stories seems to issue 
from another age. But the laughs are still there, and anyone who has ever 
been turned down for someone less intelligent will never forget Aaron's 
quip, "I say it here and it comes out there," when he calls the newsroom to 
update Grunick, his romantic nemesis, in an emergency broadcast.  KK

Babbetes Gaestebud  Gabriel Axel, 1987
Babette's Feast
743
Those familiar with Isak Dinesen's story Babette's Feast will surely agree 
that Gabriel Axel's film—besides being a gem in many other respects—
is a superb example of the art of adaptation. Relocating it from a 
Norwegian town to a tiny village on Denmark's windswept Jutland coast 
was simply a smart start to Axel's strategy of rethinking the whole 
relationship that exists between the austere lives led by two elderly 
sisters who are part of the village's devoutly religious community, and 
the sumptuous hedonism of the banquet cooked just once for the old 
folks and their fellow-believers by Babette (Stéphane Audran), the maid 
who ended up in Jutland as a refugee from the Paris Commune fighting.
How and why Babette came to be there forms the first half of this 
consistently warm, witty, and wise contemplation of love, faith, and art. 
The second half comprises the preparation and (initially very wary) 
enjoyment of the unsung wizard's cuisine. Like Babette (and Prospero, 
who seems to have inspired Dinesen's creation), Axel proved himself 
something of a magician with this modest but enormously resonant, 
big-hearted movie; but he was helped no end by his actors, several of 
them familiar from Bergman and Dreyer classics. And Audran, herself 
famously a gourmet, clearly savors every moment of her mouthwateringly 
exquisite performance.  GA

Rapid-fire stand-up comic Robin Williams, who had been stifling his 
motor mouth on screen with disappointing results in movies like 
Moscow on the Hudson (1984) and Popeye (1980), finally got the chance 
to let rip in Barry Levinson's comedy drama Good Morning, Vietnam. 
Williams plays real-life U.S. Armed Forces Radio Service DJ Adrian 
Cronauer, who broadcasts his irreverent, wisecracking jokes (effectively 
Williams's stand-up routine, delivered sitting down), and Motown music 
from his base in Saigon to the troops fighting the Vietnam War. He also 
manages to annoy the military brass in the process—a process which 
includes a terrific turn from Bruno Kirby as a lieutenant who thinks he is 
funny but clearly isn't.
There are various subplots: Cronauer's butting heads with his 
superiors, a romance with a Vietnamese woman, and a friendship with 
her brother. This is one of the few American-made movies set during the 
Vietnam War that portrays the Vietnamese as real people. However, the 
real joy is in watching the inimitable Williams deliver his manic 
monologues. Many of them were ad-libbed, and director Levinson made 
the wise decision to sit back and let the camera roll to capture each and 
every energetic outburst.  JB

Jewison, Moonstruck stars singer-turned-actress Cher as widow Loretta 
Castorini, who is about to be married to safe and reliable (read—dull and 
boring) Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). While he is away tending to 
his ailing mother, Loretta takes it upon herself to contact Johnny's 
estranged brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) and invite him to the wedding, 
but when they get to know each other the pair fall in love.
The central love story in this romantic comedy is fun and sparky 
thanks to two great central performances from Cage and especially Cher 
(a role for which she won an Oscar). She gets the opportunity to be a 
modern-day Cinderella, transforming from dowdy duckling to glamour 
queen after one trip to the hair salon. But it is the supporting players 
who add even more spice to the proceedings—especially Vincent 
Gardenia as Loretta's womanizing father Cosmo and Olympia Dukakis 
as her mother Rose—delivering scriptwriter John Patrick Shanley's 
words with zest. A much imitated treat that has yet to be bettered.  JB

Wall Street  Oliver Stone, 1987
Michael Douglas was Hollywood royalty and its good guy: a faithful 
sidekick in The Streets of San Francisco and a socially conscious 
cameraman in The China Syndrome (1979). Romancing the Stone (1984) 
added some blemish, but we knew he would eventually do the right 
thing. Then Oliver Stone cast him in Wall Street and gave him a role, like 
the ones his father took in Out of the Past (1947), Ace in the Hole (1951), 
and The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), which made us love to hate him.
In an age of bombast, where the moneymen of the world's financial 
sectors were the rising stars of a new form of capitalism, Oliver Stone 
was perfectly suited to direct a story about the rot at the core of a very 
big apple. Charlie Sheen is a young broker, keen to break into the big 
game. Gordon Gekko is his target and Bud Fox has a soul to sell.
Dedicated to his father, Oliver Stone's financial drama is a guilty 
entertainment. It reveals little of how this world works, but feeds us 
enough so as not to be confused. Complexity is conveyed through the use 
of split screens; in this world, many deals happen at once. You don't say.
Hollywood has made better films about high finance: Boiler Room 
(2000) and Margin Call (2011) are two recent examples. When the 
economic winter of 2008 shrouded the world, Stone returned to Gekko 
in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010). The thrill was gone. Bud had 
become an irrelevance; the new, young turk had no fire in his eyes and 
age had softened the tyrant. But for a moment, as he sidled up against 
the heft of power and unimaginable wealth, we saw a brief glimpse of 
the Gordon Gekko that once lit up the screen.  IHS

The Untouchables  Brian De Palma, 1987
It's Prohibition-era Chicago, and someone has to sort out those pesky 
gangsters running around town. That man, of course, is Eliot Ness (Kevin 
Costner), a Treasury agent who sets up his own special unit, with the help 
of an assortment of cops and crime fighters, to bring down the bad guys 
and, most notably, the baddest of them all, Al Capone (Robert De Niro).
Director Brian De Palma's vision of the crime-ridden Windy City is 
bloodier than many that have gone before—including the TV drama on 
which this movie is loosely based—but he doesn't let the gore detract 
from the story, or from the performances of his cast. Costner successfully 
holds his own against two powerhouse turns from De Niro and Sean 
Connery (who won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor). Connery, as 
world-weary cop Malone, has the best of David Mamet's dialogue, most 
notably the "he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his 
to the morgue" speech. In another "Method outing," De Niro packed on 
the pounds and wore suits (and, rumor has it, underpants) made by 
Capone's tailors to get a true feel for the character.
Filled with eye-widening set pieces—the Odessa Steps sequence at 
the train station and Capone's meeting that ends with punishment by 
baseball bat—The Untouchables remains a fascinating and gripping look 
at a particularly bloody piece of American history.  JB

Winner of the Golden Bear at the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival, 
Zhang Yimou's feature from the People's Republic of China mixes local 
history and legend. It follows the adventures of a young girl (Gong Li) 
who is sold by her father to an elderly and wealthy leper, then carried off 
by a chair bearer posing as a highwayman, eventually becoming the 
head of a sorghum-wine distillery.
Red Sorghum is the first feature directed by the cinematographer of 
Yellow Earth (1984), The Big Parade (1986), and Old Well (1986). One of 
the leading members of the famous "Fifth Generation" of Chinese 
filmmakers, Zhang has been widely considered the most versatile of the 
group because of his background in cinematography and acting (he was 
the lead in Old Well). Many of Red Sorghum's most striking virtues are 
visual: handsome CinemaScope compositions of landscapes and 
sorghum waving in the wind, and a deft use of color filters. 
Narrated offscreen by the heroine's grandson, the plot is set in the 
late 1920s and early 1930s and ends with the Japanese invasion. 
Although the action is often intriguing—lyrical in the early sections, 
whimsical toward the middle, and bloody and suspenseful toward the 
end—the overall narrative gets broken up quite a bit by the episodic 
structure, and the film registers mainly as detachable set pieces. 
The film presents the debut of Gong Li, who went on to become one 
of the major actresses of mainland Chinese cinema and starred in 
subsequent Zhang features. Like Zhang's early features with Gong, 
especially Ju Dou (1990) and Raise the Red Lantern (1991), Red Sorghum 
is concerned both covertly and overtly with the persistence of feudalism 
in the life of mainland China.  JRos

1987
The late John Huston devoted the better part of his career to a cinema 
predicated on the adaptation of literary works—informed by crafty 
casting and fluid storytelling, but often limited by the fact that his 
attraction to heavyweights like The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Red Badge 
of Courage (1951), Moby Dick (1956), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), 
Wise Blood (1979), and Under the Volcano (1984) guaranteed "faithful" 
reductions at best. His last film, The Dead, which adapts the final story in 
James Joyce's Dubliners—one of the greatest examples of English-
language literature, by one of Huston's favorite authors—represents the 
apotheosis of this position: isolating the story from the rest of the 
collection and most of its flawlessly composed language, and then 
doing his best with what remains.
Working with a script by his son Tony and starring his daughter 
Anjelica as Gretta Conroy, Huston hews to the original and much of its 
dialogue with rigorous affection, and within its acknowledged 
restrictions, the film's concentrated simplicity and purity achieve a kind 
of perfection. The lilting Irish flavor is virtually decanted, and Fred 
Murphy's gliding camera movements are delicately executed. There is 
also a rather awesome directness as well as calmness about the way that 
Huston contemplates his own rapidly approaching death.  JRos

Director Adrian Lyne made men all over the world squirm in their seats, 
and added the term "bunny boiler" to our vocabulary with this (let's face 
it, misogynistic) nightmare film. Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) has a 
one-night stand with colleague Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) while his wife 
and kids are away. Alex wants more than a one-night stand, however, 
and her ever-increasing dementia about rejection finally erupts to 
destroy what she can never have: a proper, picket-fence, all-American 
family. It seems that all a high-powered independent woman in the 
1980s really ever wanted was to be June Cleaver, but failing that, "June-
with-a-cleaver" would do nicely.
Fatal Attraction is a wonderful example of what happens when big-
budget Hollywood tries its hand at the exploitation market. With a less 
flashy, style-over-substance director like Lyne and without stars like 
Douglas and Close, this would be a typical run-of-the-mill, almost 
straight-to-video thriller, perhaps even marketed as a slasher film. But 
with typical Hollywood gloss, the film earns an aura of respectability—
this appears not to be a horror movie, but a domestic drama-cum-
suspense thriller, with (perhaps) erotic overtones. The ruse worked and 
this was one of the most successful films of 1987, winning six Oscar 
nominations and grossing $320,145.693 worldwide.  MK

Bull Durham  Ron Shelton, 1988
Writer-director Ron Shelton brought his own experiences as a minor 
league baseball player to this smart, madly sexy comedy, and used his 
directorial debut to share his passions for baseball, lusty women, and 
small-timers with big hearts.
The central character in Bull Durham is baseball groupie, amateur 
philosopher, and uninhibited, well-read Annie (Susan Sarandon). She 
selects a player from the Durham Bulls each year to share her bed and 
benefit from her life wisdom (sometimes tying her partner to the bed to 
read him Walt Whitman). Having chosen dim-witted rookie Ebby "Nuke" 
LaLoosh (Tim Robbins), a pitcher with "a million dollar arm and a five 
cent brain," she belatedly realizes that a veteran catcher nearing the end 
of his career, cynical Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), would have been the 
classier option. Meanwhile Crash gives Nuke manlier advice, providing 
several of the best laughs as he wearily expounds on meeting the media 
and avoiding foot fungus in curt, mid-game seminars on the pitcher's 
mound. Naturally this is really about the big game of life, with witty, 
sassy dialogue, highly engaging performances, an amusing soundtrack, 
and absolutely sizzling sex scenes between Sarandon and Costner 
(although it was Robbins who became her off-screen partner).  AE

Marcel Ophüls devised a new kind of Holocaust documentary in The 
Sorrow and the Pity (1969), letting interviews and montages speak for 
themselves without the aid of voice-over narration.
He innovated further in The Memory of Justice (1976), bringing in 
more of his personal reactions to the film's subject—the Nuremberg 
war-crimes trials. In Hotel Terminus, he took the radical step of centering 
a four-and-a-half-hour film on a Nazi who had successfully eluded 
photographers throughout his career. Equally uncompromising was 
Ophüls's decision not to use Holocaust atrocity footage, on the grounds 
that it has lost some of its impact after decades of exposure.
Hotel Terminus gains more than it loses from the near-invisibility of 
its protagonist and from Ophüls's insistence on evoking Holocaust evils 
through verbal testimony rather than filmic and photographic evidence. 
His choices have uncommon moral clarity if one believes that the 
enormity of Holocaust suffering ultimately defies media representation, 
and that cinema's big-screen charisma inevitably risks giving historical 
horrors a measure of aesthetic allure. A work of art in every sense, Hotel 
Terminus is among the most rigorous as well as the most accessible 
documentaries about the Nazi era.  DS

Thanks to the Oscar nomination it received for Best Foreign Language 
Film, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown confirmed Almodóvar's 
international status. It certainly improves on the most worthy aspects of 
his previous works: the radical subjectivity of feelings, the exaggeration 
of emotions, and the bizarre mixture of melodrama and comedy.
The story's premises belong to melodrama. Pepa Marcos (Carmen 
Maura) and her lover Iván (Fernando Guillén) make their living dubbing 
films. One day he announces that he wants to break things off. Deciding 
to meet him one last time for an explanation, Pepa investigates Iván's 
family life and discovers that his wife, recently released from a psychiatric 
hospital, plans on killing him. Despite his betrayal, Pepa runs to the 
airport, where he is about to take off with his new love, and saves his life. 
Iván tries to make up with Pepa but she turns him down.
Although Women on the Verge is full of melodramatic situations, the 
way Almodóvar develops it reveals his particular sense of humor, based 
mostly on the eccentric characters populating the film. While Pepa is on 
the phone investigating her missing lover, her apartment fills with all 
sorts of people: Candela (María Barranco), a friend who is running from 
the police because she had an affair with a Shiite terrorist; a stuttering 
young man who wants to rent the apartment after Pepa moves out; and 
Iván's mad wife, with a gun in her purse. Everyone is so desperate, and 
the sheer accumulation of such despair in one place is so exaggerated 
we can only roar with laughter. The quid-pro-quos and the vaudeville 
situations might make the movie seem like a farcical comedy, but 
Almodóvar's sure touch is there to make the difference, with its exaltation 
of kitsch, excessive colors, and hyperbole.
Women on the Verge is a moving female monologue about happiness 
and loneliness. Loosely inspired by Jean Cocteau's 1930 play The Human 
Voice, the film showcases the tremendous talent of Almodóvar's muse, 
Carmen Maura. Nor should we forget Antonio Banderas, who took an 
important step here toward international stardom.  DD

Spoorloos  George Sluizer, 1988
The Vanishing
The Golden Egg, a best-selling novel published in 1984 by Dutch journalist 
and author Tim Krabbé, served as the source material for director George 
Sluizer's highly acclaimed thriller The Vanishing. Like the book, the film 
tells the story of Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets), a young Dutchman whose 
girlfriend Saskia (Johanna ter Steege) mysteriously disappears while the 
couple are on vacation in central France. Obsessed with finding out what 
happened to her, Rex single-handedly launches an international missing-
persons campaign that completely takes over his life.
Years later, long after the trail has gone cold and the police have 
closed the case, Rex still scours the countryside out of guilt and as a 
tribute to Saskia, alienating and eventually losing his new girlfriend in 
the process. Saskia's unlikely abductor, a French chemistry teacher 
named Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) turns up with an 
offer to tell all, but only if Rex agrees in advance to undergo the exact 
same experience as his girlfriend. Rex hesitantly agrees because the 
worst thing of all is "not knowing." Raymond explains that he did indeed 
kill Saskia, not for sexual or personal reasons, but merely because he 
wanted to find out if he was capable of committing such an evil act. Rex 
willingly takes a sedative, and in the film's penultimate scene, awakens 
to find himself buried alive inside a narrow coffin. The Vanishing ends 
with a slow zoom in on a newspaper headline concerning the mysterious 
"double vanishing" of Rex and Saskia, while Raymond sits contemplatively 
at his cottage, his unsuspecting wife watering the plants that mark the 
couple's otherwise anonymous graves.
Despite its adherence to the mystery/horror/suspense form, and its 
international promotion and reception as an example of contemporary 
Hitchcockian moviemaking, The Vanishing's plaintive score, melodramatic 
tone, and focus on subjectivity rather than detection all serve to make 
the film extremely difficult to analyze in traditional generic terms. 
Sluizer's picture fits most comfortably as part of a cycle of distinctively 
Dutch "thrillers," all of which possess an essentially national, culturally 
specific dimension. Other entries in this cycle include Paul Verhoeven's 
The Fourth Man (1983), Dick Maas's The Lift (1983) and Amsterdamned 
(1987), and, to some extent, Marleen Gorris's Broken Mirrors (1984). 
Despite their incorporation of conventions from disparate genres, 
and the undeniable presence of auteurist elements in each, it is possible 
to identify an underlying thematic preoccupation across all of these 
films. The male protagonists suffer an anxiety about being bound to a 
female partner in a normal relationship—the expectation or reality of 
marriage and all it legally and socially entails, namely monogamy, 
heterosexuality, and lifelong commitment. As with the Italian giallo, 
Dutch thriller cinema is not so much a genre as a body of films resisting 
simple generic definition.  SJS

A woman (Susanna Haavisto), impulsively quitting her job and going off 
with a retrenched miner (Turo Pajala), remarks: "Hopefully, I won't regret 
this." Later, as the man enters jail for a murder he didn't commit, he 
declares he has no religion, no fixed address, no family or friends. One 
of his newfound criminal colleagues dies trying to flee the country, 
uttering these famous last words: "Bury my heart on a tip."
If anyone has perfected the cinematic language to express drollness, 
it is Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki. His films have a sardonic, deadpan, 
couldn't-care-less air that belies the real depth of their commitment to 
society's marginals. Ariel, one of his best works of the 1980s, is a 
relentless parable of hard luck befalling ordinary people. Yet these 
characters never lament or protest their lot; the best they expect is a 
ticket to somewhere, anywhere, else.
At certain moments of his career, Kaurismaki has seemed, especially 
in his public pronouncements, incurably flip. But Ariel's bleak outlook 
and its determinedly minimal means (approaching the austerity of 
Robert Bresson) reveal a more authentic engagement with his subject 
matter. Ariel makes for hypnotic viewing, forecasting the greatness that 
Kaurismaki would achieve in his 2002 film Man Without a Past.  AM

Alice
In his characteristically bizarre and hyperimaginative manner, Czech 
filmmaker, animator, and puppet maker extraordinaire Jan Svankmajer 
captures the feel of Lewis Carroll's children's tale Alice in Wonderland 
while still managing to convey several "adult" and culturally specific 
themes. The creative force behind many of his country's most celebrated 
shorts—including Dimensions of Dialogue (1982), Down to the Cellar 
(1983), and The Pit, the Pendulum and Hope (1983)—Svankmajer here 
finds ideal inspiration in the protosurrealist story of little Alice (played 
by young Kristyna Kohoutová, who enters a world of strange creatures 
and animals and constantly questions the (il)logic of all she encounters.
In Svankmajer's conception, the disposable products of domestic life 
(such as rulers, socks, jars, and buttons) become the raw material for 
gothic splendor. And Lewis's familiar characters—such as the White 
Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare—are here more creepy than 
charming; as one critic writes, "they're partly enchanted, partly haunted, 
and there's a hint of the morphologist's lab in them, a trace of 
formaldehyde." Finally, however, Alice is less an adaptation than an 
exercise in auteurism, as Svankmajer finds new ways of treating his 
familiar obsessions with the inhumanness of routine and the vulgarity 
and danger of overeating.  SJS

Errol Morris's third documentary feature (after Gates of Heaven [1978] 
and Vernon, Florida [1981]) is an absorbing if problematic reconstruction 
of an investigation into the 1976 murder of a Dallas policeman. As an 
investigative detective-journalist who spent many years working on this 
case, Morris uncovered a disturbing miscarriage of justice in the 
conviction of Randall Adams—who came very close to being executed, 
but was saved as a result of this film. Morris goes so far in his talking-
head interview technique that he eventually goads David Harris, 
Adams's companion on the night of the murder in question, into 
something very close to a confession.
It's the latter achievement that makes The Thin Blue Line as 
memorable and as important as it is. But it is worth bearing in mind that 
Morris's highly selective approach also leaves a good many questions 
unanswered. The issue of motive is virtually untouched, and the quasi-
abstract re-creations of the crime, accompanied by what is probably the 
first effective film score ever composed by Philip Glass, give rise to a lot 
of metaphysical speculations that, provocative as they are, tend 
nevertheless to overshadow many of the issues about what actually 
happened during the crime.
The results are compelling, even though they provide an object 
lesson in the dangers of being influenced by Werner Herzog; the larger 
considerations and the film noir overtones wind up distracting us from 
the facts of the case, and what emerges are two effective half-films, each 
of which is partially at odds with the other. Yet one can also see Morris 
honing his flair for juxtaposition and editing that would eventually bear 
fruit in his remarkable 1997 film Fast, Cheap & Out of Control, where he 
manages to juggle the continuities and discontinuities between four 
seemingly unrelated talking heads, and in the multiple achievements of 
his episodes in the TV series First Person (2000), which has already 
enjoyed two seasons.  JRos

Katsuhiro Ôtomo's animated masterpiece Akira is the pinnacle of 
Japanese apocalyptic science fiction. The plot is deceptively simple: in 
the chaotic future of Neo-Tokyo (named for its replacing the original 
Tokyo, destroyed by a mysterious cataclysm in the late twentieth 
century), Kaneda, a teenage motorcycle gang member, finds his former 
best friend Tetsuo transformed into a homicidal telepath with the will 
and the power to kill hundreds. He reluctantly joins a group of 
antigovernment terrorists in their search for the mysterious Akira, a 
telepath even more powerful than Tetsuo.
Ôtomo's genius lies in linking the apocalypse with the rage of 
disaffected teenagers. After all, for a teenager, every emotion is 
apocalyptic. So imagine if a teenager had telekinetic powers that increase 
exponentially with his emotions, and imagine that this teenager were 
the most angry, resentful little bastard you've ever met. Think about that 
and then think about the most epic scenes of devastation you could 
possibly imagine, and you have this film. The energy-rush action of Akira 
is more than a 200 mph adrenaline ride. It provides the sugarcoating for 
some serious exploration of ideas and metaphors that preoccupy the 
Japanese psyche, namely social collapse, malaise, and the continuing 
ambivalence toward military power. It's not an accident that the chief 
opposing forces in the story are delinquent teenage bikers, would-be 
revolutionaries, and the military.
Most of all, Akira's story is fueled by society's fear of its youth—wild, 
uncontrollable, chaotic youth. Tetsuo is the ultimate pissed-off teen, one 
with enough power to garner himself a body count in the dozens, and 
there's a reason the government and the army are terrified of the 
enigmatic Akira, forever frozen in an arrested childhood. This is 
adolescence causing destruction on an epic scale, drawing on memories 
of the atom bombs dropped on Japan in World War II, and our continuing 
collective fears of annihilation. The fascination that Japanese pop culture 
has with the Apocalypse goes beyond mere flirtation and leaps headlong 
into mad, dirty, monkey sex every chance it gets, which isn't necessarily 
very healthy, but certainly makes for some excellent stories.  AT

A Brit named George (Tom Georgeson), his American girlfriend Wanda 
(Jamie Lee Curtis), her Yankee lover Otto (Kevin Kline), and George's 
stuttering English minion Ken (Michael Palin) together rob a jewelry 
vault. Untrusting and untrustworthy, they're each criminal amateurs with 
secretly developed cross-purposes and internal alliances. So Wanda and 
Otto double-cross George by framing him for the crime, although Ken 
unwittingly intercedes and hides the ill-gotten treasure in his aquarium.
When George is brought to trial and defended by Archie (John 
Cleese), a frustrated lawyer, Wanda resolves to seduce the good 
magistrate and learn the secret of her gang's stolen booty. Complications 
quickly develop, perhaps none more aggressively funny than Ken's 
several attempts to dispatch dog owner Mrs. Coady (Patricia Hayes), the 
one witness connecting George with the crime. Mixed in for good 
measure are Otto's play-acted gay come-ons to Ken, Archie's browbeaten 
home life, Archie and Wanda's developing love affair interrupted at every 
turn by Otto's bumbling jealousy, and an airport finale with flight to a 
leisurely future the prize for all comers.
A caper comedy of manners and not so subtle Anglo-American 
cultural disconnects, the success of Charles Crichton's A Fish Called Wanda 
lay in its treatment of stereotypical gangster types. First is the absurd 
motif of the piece that rests on the communications skills of a man with 
a lifetime stutter (Ken). Then there's a psycho killer (Otto) rendered as an 
oversensitive nincompoop manipulated by a femme fatale (Wanda) with 
a debilitating erotic weakness for romance languages. Last is the straight-
laced hero (Archie), no more than a cloistered man with great passions, 
but also someone with an almost pathological knack for receiving the 
butt end of bad luck situations.
Laughs aside, A Fish Called Wanda offers a triumphant reappraisal of 
one-time scream queen Curtis as a comic actress while providing a 
launch pad for Kline's ascent into critical circles as an awards-worthy 
performer. Effortlessly, but most of all humorously, the film elevated the 
careers of Monty Python alums John Cleese and Michael Palin and made 
them Hollywoodstars in the genre.  GCQ

Reading over the filmography of Joris Ivens, it's hard to believe that a 
single filmmaker made all his films. Here was an artist who was an active 
member of the first European avant-garde film movement; who filmed 
the first Soviet Five-Year Plan (Komsomolsk [1932]), the Spanish Civil War 
(The Spanish Earth [1937]), and the American New Deal (Power and the 
Land [1940]); and who made one of the first essential anticolonialist films 
(Indonesia Calling [1946]). Such a life was not without its contradictions—
few artists could claim to have been awarded both the International 
Lenin Prize and the rank of Commander of the French Légion d'Honneur. 
Therefore, it's so wonderfully appropriate that his final film, A Tale of the 
Wind, which he codirected with his wife and filmmaking partner 
Marceline Loridan, is one of the most graceful and haunting works of 
self-reflection in cinema.
Having witnessed during his ninety years enough for ten lifetimes, 
this "flying Dutchman" turned his camera on perhaps his most elusive 
subject—himself. A lifelong asthmatic begins with some thoughts on 
the breath that sustains his and all life, and that is manifest in the world 
as the wind. Like Ivens himself, the wind knows no boundaries, naturally 
linking peoples, cultures, and continents. Ivens's exploration eventually 
brings him back to China, site of several of his greatest films, where he 
sets out to find the Dragon, mythic representative of the wind, in order 
to learn its secret. There are bumps along the way; some Party officials 
do all they can to very politely stop him from shooting, while at times 
nature has to be coaxed into cooperating with the filmmakers' project. 
Unable to film the magnificent terracotta warriors of the Qin Dynasty, 
Ivens and Loridan conjure up their own artifacts, even staging a Busby 
Berkeley-ish number with them. Moving between documentary, fiction, 
mythology, philosophy, and sheer whimsy, Loridan and Ivens created 
with their epitaph one of the most magnificently "free" films ever made, 
a fitting tribute to one of the cinema's true originals.  RP

Nuovo cinema paradiso  Giuseppe Tornatore, 1988
Cinema Paradiso
Marked by an autobiographical touch, this second movie by Italian 
director Giuseppe Tornatore is a nostalgic evocation of his childhood 
days, but also of those happy times before television when people 
used to go to the cinema. It tells the story of a filmmaker who, after 
being told by his mother that "Alfredo died," starts to remember the 
1950s, when as a boy living in a small Sicilian village, he spent almost 
all his time in the Cinema Paradiso. While there he became friends with 
the projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret, in one of his best roles), a 
father substitute who, after being blinded during a fire, continued to 
do his job with help from the child. Everything in their village 
revolves around the cinema, a place of entertainment, but also of 
meeting and chatter.
The personalities of the Paradiso audience are quizzically charming, 
especially that of the priest, Father Adelfio (played by Leopoldo Trieste), 
who assumes the censor's role, cutting out the "daring" scenes. In the 
esteemed traditions of Neorealism and Italian comedy, Cinema Paradiso 
finds an excellent balance between humor and nostalgia. Echoing 
François Truffaut's The 400 Blows (1959), the image of a happy childhood 
nurtured by the tones of movies reveals Tornatore's gratitude to the 
masters of cinema. The film is enjoyable and heartwarming, especially 
for the relationship between the boy and the projectionist.  DD

The Naked Gun  David Zucker, 1988
David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, the team behind the 1980 
blockbuster hit Airplane!, first introduced the world to bumbling cop 
Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) with the comic TV series Police Squad in 
1982. But it was this feature-length parody of the traditional cop show 
six years later that turned Nielsen's Drebin into a star, spawning two 
successful sequels.
The cop who always gets his man—usually by complete accident—is 
assigned to a new case: Investigating criminal mastermind Victor Ludwig 
(Ricardo Montalban), who plans to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II at a 
baseball game. (What, you expected the plot to make sense?!) Aiding 
him is the beautiful Jane (Priscilla Presley, showing a deft comic touch) 
and an assortment of oddballs including Police Captain Ed Hocken 
(George Kennedy) and Drebin's partner Nordberg (former football star 
O.J. Simpson, six years before his notorious trial).
The jokes are dumb and dumber, the spoofs and sight gags coming 
thick and fast as everything from the American National Anthem to 
classic movies like Casablanca (1942) are skewered by Zucker/Abrahams/
Zucker's hilariously silly script. Stupid—but in a good way.  JB

With an attention to craft and design absent from so much mainstream 
Western animation, several Japanese animators have subverted the 
traditionally child-oriented nature of cartoons (at least that's how they're 
often perceived) into grand achievements equal to any big-budget, live-
action film. In fact, as Isao Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies readily attests, 
sometimes these animated films actually surpass their live-action 
equivalents, finding narrative freedom, emotional honesty, and a greater 
sense of artistic control on the plane of a two-dimensional set.
A harrowing and painful story of the horrors of war, Grave of the 
Fireflies follows two Japanese children orphaned after the firebombing 
of their village during World War II. Yet the film seems less interested in 
accusing the military of villainy in the name of battle and more interested 
in showing the often-silent victims of war, the innocent children left 
fending for themselves as hell rains down from above. Remarkably, 
Grave of the Fireflies debuted on a double-bill with Hayao Miyazaki's 
much lighter My Neighbor Totoro, and indeed it is hard to imagine 
audiences of children, let alone adults, making it through this powerful 
and disturbing film without being overwhelmed by sadness and 
disappointment in the seeming inevitability of human conflict.  JKl

Big  Penny Marshall, 1988
When young Josh (David Moscow) is refused a ride on a fairground 
rollercoaster, he puts a quarter in a carnival wishing machine and wishes 
he were big. Next morning, it seems Josh's dream has come true—sort 
of—when he wakes up to find himself in the body of a thirty-something 
(and definitely taller) man (Tom Hanks). Fleeing his home when his 
mother fails to recognize him (and in fact suspects him of being her son's 
abductor), big Josh has to go out into the adult world on his own with 
only his boyish innocence to help him.
Hanks would go on to win Best Actor Academy Awards two years 
running for Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994), but this is 
arguably his best performance. Perfectly capturing the mannerisms of 
a pre-teen boy (Hanks watched his "younger self," Moscow, playing with 
costar Jared Rushton, and copied his behavior), Hanks portrays 
overgrown Josh as a gangly innocent who believably charms his way 
into a job—at a toy company, of course. While the ending gets a little 
schmaltzy, director Penny Marshall otherwise keeps the three-hanky 
stuff to a minimum and gets maximum humor from her cast, especially 
in the pairing of Hanks and Rushton (as Josh's schoolboy pal), and the 
casting of Robert Loggia (as the toy firm's owner) and John Heard (as 
Josh's conniving business rival).  JB

Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Robert Zemeckis, 1988
Although live action and animation had shared the screen before—most 
notably when animated mouse Jerry (of Tom and Jerry fame) danced 
with Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh (1945)—director Robert Zemeckis 
and animation director Richard Williams skillfully blended the two into 
this feature-length comedy thriller that still looks technically flawless 
decades after it was made.
Gruff, seedy-looking private eye Eddie Valiant, memorably played by 
Bob Hoskins at his grumpy best, doesn't like Toons, the animated 
characters who live in the Toontown suburb of Los Angeles. So he is less 
than pleased when he is hired by film studio boss Marvin Acme (Stubby 
Kaye) to check into the activities of his star, a sexy cartoon named Jessica 
Rabbit (smokily voiced by Kathleen Turner). Eddie is even less impressed 
by her excitable rabbit husband, Roger (voice of Charles Fleischer), 
especially when the mismatched pair are plunged into a hilarious tangle 
of murder and blackmail.
Smartly characterized, by both the human and animated cast, and 
wittily scripted by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit is an action comedy just like the classic Warner cartoons it pays 
homage to: bursting with fun, deliciously surreal, and watchable many 
times over. It won three well-deserved Oscars.  JB

Dekalog, jeden  Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1988
The Decalogue
Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski was that rare filmmaker who could 
mix politics, comedy, religion, tragedy, and metaphysics into his works 
without coming across as either pretentious or silly. But sadly, just as the 
director was finally beginning to taste the fruits of international success, 
he died unexpectedly in 1996 at the early age of fifty-four. 
Although Kieslowski was the creator of many masterpieces, including 
The Double Life of Veronique (1991) and the Three Colors trilogy (Blue 
[1993], White [1994], and Red [1994]), The Decalogue may be his most 
profound and perfect work. Originally filmed for Polish television, The 
Decalogue is a collection of ten hour-long short films, each ambitiously 
featuring a story based loosely on one of the Ten Commandments and 
all set in the same bleak Warsaw apartment complex.
Many of Kieslowski's earlier works obliquely addressed the political 
realities of Poland at the time, but with The Decalogue the director aims 
for something grander and more universal. The collection addresses the 
concepts of fate, chance, and faith through the intersection of different 
lives—children, parents, siblings, and strangers—seeking to illuminate 
the invisible threads that tie us together but also the feelings and beliefs 
that connect us to a higher power.
In one installment a father and son ponder the place of God in a time 
dominated by technology. In another, a doctor deliberates the ethics of 
keeping a patient on life support, when his life or death will forever alter 
the complicated future of the patient's troubled wife. Two brothers try to 
honor their estranged father's memory by caring for his priceless stamp 
collection. A horrifying murder calls into question the ethics of the death 
penalty. Each installment focuses on a mostly blameless domestic 
situation, profound quandaries with no right or wrong way out, and 
Kieslowski carefully follows the different paths his characters take.
Although each of The Decalogue's segments may be attached to a 
specific Commandment, the connection is rarely clear or obvious. 
Kieslowski seems more interested in how those ancient rules apply when 
considered in the not always cut-and-dried context of contemporary, 
everyday life. Each installment shares certain thematic similarities, even 
if they possess slightly different aesthetics. As with his later Three Colors 
trilogy, the various episodes of The Decalogue sometimes also share the 
same actors, actors whose presence helps connect the disparate (and 
without exception compelling) stories.
Working in close tandem with his regular screenwriter Krzysztof 
Piesiewicz, composer Zbigniew Preisner, and nine different 
cinematographers, Kieslowski achieves that rare feat: a seamlessly unified 
diverse anthology that gets closer than almost any other film to what it 
means to be human. Compelling, intelligent, and poetic, The Decalogue 
is a true work of art that teaches even as it entertains.  JKl
"A masterwork of 
modern cinema, 
essential viewing for 
anyone who cares about 
the movies as a serious 
art form."
Stephen Holden, 
The New York Times, 2000
Kieslowski was made a Fellow of the 
British Film Institute in 1990 for his 
contribution to film culture.

Numerous writers and directors had tinkered with the script of Rain Man 
before director Barry Levinson came on board. Many believed the story 
of a used-car salesman trying to befriend his autistic brother on a cross-
country journey so he can get his hands on the latter's multimillion 
dollar inheritance just too difficult to bring to the screen. Even the film's 
eventual stars, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise, seemed worried about 
the movie's outcome when they dubbed it "Two Schmucks in a Car" 
during shooting.
Levinson luckily didn't balk at the idea of making a film with little 
dramatic story, instead focusing on the human development that is at 
the picture's heart. Traveling across country with the autistic Raymond 
(Hoffman) because Raymond won't fly, Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) gradually 
gets to understand the brother he hardly knows and in the process 
develops a sense of decency he didn't have before. Hoffman captures 
his character's autism without going overboard on the nervous tics, but 
most impressive here is Cruise, who holds his own alongside a more 
experienced actor and expertly depicts a shallow man who finally finds 
some depth in his life.  JB

Before Die Hard, Bruce Willis was just an actor with one hit TV show 
(Moonlighting) and a flop movie (Blind Date [1987]) to his name, but 
following Die Hard's huge success, he deservedly became one of 
Hollywood's hottest stars.
His cocky charm breathes life into the character of John McClane, a 
New York cop visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her 
office in Los Angeles, just as the building falls into the control of a group 
of ruthless terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). While all the 
office workers—staying late for the company Christmas party—are 
herded into one area by the bad guys, our hero (who was in the bathroom 
when the assault begins) is off and running around the partially 
incomplete tower. In his own words, he is "a fly in the ointment, a monkey 
in the wrench, a pain in the ass" to the terrorists who aren't quite sure 
who is attacking them or how he got loose.
John McTiernan—who previously helmed the Arnold Schwarzenegger 
alien-action movie Predator (1987) —packs his skyscraper adventure with 
explosions, fights, and relentless action, as our antihero (he smokes, curses, 
and bloodily despatches the bad guy) picks off the terrorists by listening 
in on their walkie-talkies in an attempt to figure out their nefarious plan.
McTiernan, along with writers Jeb Stuart and Steve DeSouza (adapting 
a Roderick Thorpe novel), effectively redefines the action movie as a one-
man-army. Willis quips his way through a series of clever setups and payoffs 
(when McClane takes his shoes and socks off at the beginning of the movie 
to combat jet lag, you just know his bare feet are going to be a plot device 
later, and they are), his undershirt getting dirtier by the second. His only pal 
is a flat-footed cop (Reginald Veljohnson) whom he communicates with by 
radio, whereas most of the other police officers and federal agents are either 
too dumb or too trigger-happy to realize what's really going on.
Superbly acted by Willis as a guy who really would rather be 
somewhere else, McClane is a hero for the 1990s who has continued to 
mutter his "yippee-ki-yay motherfucker" catchphrase in three enjoyable 
sequels. A true rollercoaster ride of a movie.  JB

Dead Ringers  David Cronenberg, 1988
One of the coolest and most controlled of David Cronenberg's films, 
Dead Ringers explores his perennial theme of bodily penetration not 
through the visceral gore and horror of his earlier work but through the 
seemingly clinical medium of gynecology. Jeremy Irons plays identical 
twin gynecologists, Elliot and Beverly Mantle, who run a fertility clinic in 
Toronto. Elliot, an extrovert who is self-confident, seduces his patients 
and, when he's tired of them, passes them on to his shy, insecure twin. 
The women never know the difference. But when hedonistic junkie 
actress Claire Niveau (Geneviève Bujold) enters their lives, their perverse 
symbiotic dependency is undermined.
Inspired by a real-life event, Cronenberg creates a fragile interior 
world of emotional and psychological vulnerability, structured and lit in 
such a way as to suggest an aquarium: The outside world is held 
precariously at bay, and disintegration threatens the mind even more 
than the body.  Claire's physical peculiarity foreshadows the three-way 
disruption that will destroy the brothers' relationship, and their lives.
 With the help of split-screen techniques, Irons gives a masterly 
double performance, ensuring by subtle variations in stance, voice, and 
gesture that we're never in any doubt which twin we're seeing.  His tour 
de force, and Cronenberg's quiet, insidious intensity, forge a film that's 
even more disturbing to think about in retrospect than it is to watch.  PK

sexual intrigue, brought to life on screen by director Stephen Frears.
Glenn Close steals the show as the vicious and vindictive Marquise 
de Merteuil, whose main enjoyment in her bored, rich life is to conspire 
with the equally cynical Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich). Their 
latest scheme involves the virginal Cécile (Uma Thurman) and the pure 
Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), but Valmont's attempts to ruin 
them both for his own pleasure is complicated when he falls for the 
unsuspecting Madame.
Frears leads us into the boudoirs and drawing rooms of the wealthy 
aristocracy, each one dripping with elegance and wickedness in equal 
measure. Close is perfectly acid tongued, Malkovich both seductive and 
slimy, and the cast rounded out by the unusual casting of Keanu Reeves 
(better known for more modern roles) as Chevalier Danceny, just one of 
the poor fellows caught up in Valmont's machinations. A handsome look 
at lust, betrayal, and guilt, Dangerous Liaisons is both lavishly mounted 
and beautifully portrayed.  JB

RoboCop  Paul Verhoeven, 1988
Hollywood may be a cynical place, but it rarely welcomes cynicism in its 
films. All the more remarkable, then, that a studio should lavish a big 
budget on a Dutch filmmaker who was known in his own country for 
films that indulged in sex, violence, and depravity. But perhaps it 
recognized the brilliance in Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner's script, 
and understood that no Hollywood director could do it justice.
Crime has brought the America of tomorrow to its knees. In Detroit, 
Omni Consumer Products, which owns the city's police department, 
unveils its latest weapon: a half-man, half-robot cop, trained in all aspects 
of the justice system. However, the rot of corruption on both sides of the 
law leaves the new defender fighting alone in the battle to save the city.
RoboCop's strength lies in its subversiveness; the film is one of the 
finest satires of Western culture that Hollywood produced in the 1980s. 
Punctuating the action sequences, a series of advertising breaks question 
the values of a consumer-obsessed society. Each of them, from sunscreen 
that will likely cause cancer and a car security system that electrocutes 
thieves, to a nuclear war game for the family, are merely an exaggeration 
of real commercials. Likewise, the blurred line between corporate 
malfeasance and criminal activity is all too believable, while the notion 
that law enforcement could become privatized has become a reality. IHS
Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988) remains Terence Davies' masterpiece. One 
of the finest features ever produced in the UK, it's a highly distinctive 
marriage of style and content, combining the social concerns of much 
British cinema with formal and existential preoccupations more readily 
associated with European art cinema. 
An autobiographical work, the film examines the life of a working-
class family in Liverpool, encompassing the wedding of the elder 
daughter, the christening of the younger daughter's infant child, and the 
secondment into the armed forces of the family's son. Presiding over the 
family is the sadistic father (Pete Postlethwaite), who is always too quick 
with his fists, and the long-suffering, loving mother (Freda Dowie). 
Unfolding as a series of meticulously constructed vignettes, told from 
the perspectives of different members of the same family, Distant Voices, 
Still Lives is rich in poetry, emotion, and performance. An affecting work, 
in which ordeal and sufferance are brilliantly juxtaposed with passages 
of intense happiness and communal spirit, it is also the film with which 
Davies established his ability to write incredible female characters. 1940s 
Liverpool is beautifully rendered by the use of a muted palette, which 
gives a hand-tinted look to certain scenes. The director's visual aesthetic 
is all the more impressive given the film's modest budget.  JWo

Distant Voices, Still Lives  Terence Davies, 1988

When Harry Met Sally provides indisputable proof, if it were needed, that 
all the right ingredients—a skilled comic director (Rob Reiner), great 
script (Nora Ephron), and brilliant casting (Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan)—do 
add up to a damn-near perfect piece of film entertainment.
Sharing a postcollege car journey from Chicago to New York in 1977, 
smart-mouthed Harry (Crystal) announces to snobbish Sally (Ryan) that 
they will never be friends because, in his often skewed logic, "men and 
women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way." At 
the end of the trip, the pair go their separate ways, only to cross paths a 
few years later in an airport and then again when she is on the verge of 
breaking up with her boyfriend and he has split up with his wife. Of 
course, they do eventually become friends, and it is inevitable that they 
become more than that before the movie's end—but that is half the fun.
A romantic comedy that tips its cap to Woody Allen movies like Annie 
Hall (1977), this is brought right up to date by Ephron's witty dialogue 
that accurately depicts the modern-day dating game. Harry learns the 
drawbacks of dating a younger woman when he asks a girl where she 
was when Kennedy was shot only to get the reply, "Ted Kennedy's been 
shot?" Against the backdrop of the most cinematic of cities, New York, 
scene upon scene is either a classic or features memorable dialogue and 
is played expertly by the two leads: Sally's fake orgasm in the deli, after 
which a woman at a neighboring table (played by Reiner's own mother) 
says, "I'll have what she's having," and the store karaoke session when 
Harry bumps into his ex-wife are just two examples. Excellent support 
roles include Bruno Kirby as Harry's pal and Carrie Fisher as Sally's.
A triumph for all involved—Nora Ephron (who died in 2012) didn't 
write another script to match this Oscar-nominated one—the film 
turned Ryan into a highly sought-after leading lady and made Harry 
Connick Jr., who performs the film's 1930s and 1940s standards 
(including "It Had to be You") on the soundtrack, a bona fide star (it won 
him his first Grammy Award, for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance).  JB

Woody Allen in winning philosophical form (coming off September [1987] 
and Another Woman [1988], two of his bleaker dramas, made back-to-
back and both coolly received) tackles life, death, truth, love, God, and 
all things Dostoyevskian in Crimes and Misdemeanors. A wonderful cast 
plays out a plot constructed like a set of Chinese boxes for a novel on 
film about close encounters of the Upper East Side kind. Handsomely 
shot by Ingmar Bergman's regular cinematographer Sven Nykvist, with 
Allen making striking use of music by Schubert and Bach as well as the 
jazz and swing favorites we associate with him.
Two apparently quite different stories dovetail at the last moment. 
Judah Rosenthal, a respected eye surgeon (played by Martin Landau in 
a brilliant, Oscar-nominated role), is an adulterer desperate to discard 
his angry mistress Dolores (Anjelica Huston) when she threatens to make 
a mess of his well-ordered, comfortable, and hypocritical life. Meanwhile, 
Allen's documentary filmmaker Cliff Stern's attempts to woo Mia Farrow's 
Halley are frustrated by his insufferable brother-in-law, Lester (a 
marvelous turn by Alan Alda), a practiced charmer who makes sitcoms 
and is, incidentally, the subject of Cliff's current film. The big questions 
are Judah's to ponder when his shady brother (Jerry Orbach) offers to 
take the Dolores situation in hand—homicidally. Around his dilemma a 
network of family, friends, and brief acquaintances expose themselves, 
suffer, love, struggle, and crack deathless one-liners.
Allen in his familiar existentialist, angst-ridden Manhattan intellectual 
nebbish persona unsurprisingly delivers the best of these in the 
bittersweet comedic strand: "He wants to produce something of mine," 
trills Farrow. "Yes," worries Allen, "your first child!" More unusually, weighty, 
realistic, tragic drama and comedy of manners mingle in a uniquely 
sophisticated, ambitious discussion of values, morality, and law. Allen, 
firing on all cylinders, steers through pain, profundity, and outrageous 
humor with his inimitable, signature style, addressing good and evil, guilt 
and retribution, movies versus reality, and swell cocktail parties with wit 
and penetration. Crimes and Misdemeanors is intricate and adult, dark 
and delightful, and right up there among his very best work.  AE

Batman  Tim Burton, 1989
767
In this blockbuster movie version of Bob Kane's classic comic, director Tim 
Burton reimagines eponymous superhero Batman (last seen on screen 
in a campy 1960s TV incarnation) as a dark and conflicted character.
Michael Keaton stars as tortured soul Bruce Wayne, a brooding man 
who as a child saw his parents killed by muggers in a darkened alleyway. 
Now a multimillionaire industrialist by day, at night he dons a cape, 
mask, and knee-high boots to become Batman and right the wrongs of 
bleak, gothic Gotham City. But is he a superhero or a crazed vigilante? 
Photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and reporter Alex Knox (Robert 
Wuhl) are among those who want to discover Batman's secret identity 
and find out the truth.
While Burton gives his Caped Crusader depth, darkness, and even 
romance (in the form of Vicki), the show is almost stolen from his hero 
by the villain of the piece, the Joker, played with gusto by Jack Nicholson. 
Resplendent in purple suit and clown-like makeup, dancing to the Prince 
songs that pepper the soundtrack, he was surely the most enjoyably 
unlikable bad guy to hit the big screen in a long time.  JB

Field of Dreams  Phil Alden Robinson, 1989
With the mantra "If you build it, he will come" ringing in his head, Kevin 
Costner's Iowa farmer acts on the voice emanating from his cornfield 
and, against the opposition of all those around him, ploughs through 
his crops to build a baseball diamond. The apparition of legendary batter 
"Shoeless" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) may be the catalyst for Ray's journey 
to find more players from the game's long, distant past, but his mission 
is merely a cover for some deeper meaning in Phil Alden Robinson's 
mythical family drama. 
In Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner embodies the average Joe of middle 
America. Ray is a more domesticated variation of the sports-obsessed 
everyman figure Costner played in Bull Durham (1988) and other sports-
related characters from such films as Tin Cup (1996) and For the Love of 
the Game (1999). But Field of Dreams is about more than America's 
obsession with sport - it signaled the beginning of the masculinity-in-
crisis era for Hollywood's white alpha male stars.
In opposition to the "hard bodies" of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, 
Ray's more sensitive soul nostalgically yearns for a time when patriarchal 
superiority was seemingly infallible, thus defining the search for a new 
male identity in a post-Reagan era. He is not merely on a voyage of self-
discovery, but a quest to find his position in the gender revolution of 
late-twentieth-century America. The resulting drama perfectly 
encapsulates the period that witnessed America on the cusp of a new 
age, when the ideologies it had lived by had finally crumbled away.  JT

Glory  Edward Zwick, 1989
Following the bloom of American Civil Rights it became fashionable to 
resurrect little-known stories from the ravages of time. Edward Zwick's 
Glory is one such exercise meant to rewrite the blank slate of memory.
The film opens on a Civil War battlefield, where former slave John 
Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) labors to bury dead soldiers. Colonel Robert 
Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a liberal white blue blood, is thereafter placed 
in charge of the Union Army's first all-black volunteer company. Into his 
care are entrusted the raison d'être of the war, slaves and free blacks, 
each of whom is transformed into a fighting elite finally sent to their 
doom storming a fort.
Notable for being an inspirational alternative history, Glory more 
importantly showcased a group of outstanding young black actors. 
Foremost was Denzel Washington in his first Oscar-winning role as Private 
Trip. Other standouts include Jihmi Kennedy (Private Jupiter Sharts) and 
Andre Braugher (Corporal Thomas Searles), although the sign of the 
times is surely the picture's eulogy of sacrifices made on behalf of racial 
harmony as the salve for present-day racial tensions.
True, Glory is consumed with sentimentalism and fatal purpose. But 
it is equally an antidote for contemporary cynicism, with a heroic true 
story and a winning score by James Horner.  GC-Q

The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover  
Peter Greenaway, 1989
Taking his dissatisfaction with conservative politics to the extreme, Peter 
Greenaway devised The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover as an opulent 
and decadent riposte to Margaret Thatcher's England. Michael Gambon 
plays Albert Spica, the monstrous, obnoxious, oafish thief of the title, 
holding court at a trendy London restaurant, decimating a disgustingly 
over-the-top banquet while surrounded by numerous sycophants and 
lackeys. Ignored for too long, his wife Georgina (Helen Mirren) initiates 
a passionate affair with a quieter, bookish patron (Alan Howard), 
facilitated by the accommodating chef back in the kitchen. So busy 
consuming and humiliating his hangers-on, Gambon at first doesn't 
notice his wife's deception, but once he discovers her adultery he 
concocts a cannibalistic revenge.
Greenaway directs his film like a tapestry gone wrong, revealing all 
manner of depravity as he pans back and forth between the kitchen and 
dining room (with a different color scheme in each locale) in search of a 
smidgen of good will amid the savagery. The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & 
Her Lover seethes anger and disgust, most of it directed toward the 
upper class, whose waste and barbarism is portrayed not just as a blight 
on society but frankly as an affront to good taste.  JKl

Despite the strong potential for maudlin depression, My Left Foot 
emerged as a surprisingly entertaining, earthy, funny, and uplifting 
celebration of Irishman Christy Brown, who was born imprisoned in a 
body horribly crippled by cerebral palsy but won recognition and respect 
as an artist and writer. The concept of a disabled man with a surprising 
intellectual gift clearly has parallels with the fictional Rain Man (1988), 
but My Left Foot is at least its equal in every department, not least in the 
principal performances. Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting in a role as far as he 
could get from his affected aesthete of A Room with a View (1986) or his 
gay opportunist in My Beautiful Laundrette (1985). Brenda Fricker is 
radiant as Christy's devout, careworn mother. Ray McAnally, who sadly 
died before the film's release, gave his last rich characterization as 
Christy's unpredictable, heavy-drinking father. And young Hugh O'Conor 
as the boy Christy conveys the nightmarish frustration of a bright child, 
presumed to be an idiot, struggling to communicate with his family.
First-time director Jim Sheridan and cowriter Shane Connaughton 
don't flinch from the tragedy and rage in Christy's life as a wheelchair-
bound wit patronized and subjected to daily humiliations despite his 
considerable abilities. But their rounded impression of the man leaves 
an overwhelming sense of the miraculousness of life and of Christy's 
remarkable spirit. This is underlined by the magical quality injected into 
the smallest incidents—like the child Christy's wonder when he is borne 
by his brothers and sisters to their sweet, spooky Halloween street 
festivities.
The famous left foot is featured in running jokes and dramatic 
episodes as Christy saves his mother's life, scores goals, paints, fells an 
adversary in a pub brawl, attempts suicide, lays bricks, and types his 
autobiography, all with the eponymous appendage. Having mastered 
the physical difficulties of a rigid, twisted  body and impaired speech, he 
conveys a man whose cleverness brings him little relief, but whose 
humor, lust, and single-mindedness illuminate what might otherwise 
have been simply harrowing.  AE

Although director John Woo, producer Tsui Hark, and star Chow Yun-Fat 
had worked together previously and had each amassed a body of major 
work, it was the international success of The Killer that established Hong 
Kong action cinema as a distinct brand. Most of the major creatives then 
proceeded to up-and-down Hollywood careers, while Western 
filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino began lifting 
elements of their distinctive style—the popular flat-on-his-back, gun-
in-each-hand slide is a favorite Chow Yun-Fat move, often imitated by 
pretenders—to enliven their own action pictures.
The Killer is an action melodrama about an honorable, sentimental 
hit man (Chow) trying to save enough money from a run of assassinations 
to pay for an operation to restore the sight of a singer (Sally Yeh) 
accidentally blinded during one of his hits, while a tough cop (Danny 
Lee) learns to respect the murderer he's required to track down and 
finally joins with him for a gruesome glorification. A genocidal film with 
more corpses than Total Recall (1990) and Die Hard 2 (1990) combined—
ironic in that the plot hinges on the lack of suitable cornea donors in 
Hong Kong—this is a literally astonishing mix of stunts, soap, and sly 
humor. The comic-book gunplay and violence of the action elements are 
mixed with an emotional strain that owes something to Douglas Sirk, 
but the real love story isn't the mild triangle between cop, killer, and 
blind victim but the almost-gay buddyship that works up between the 
two male leads.
The original Chinese title translates as Bloodshed of Two Heroes, which 
represents the film rather better than the export title, emphasizing its 
status as a relationship movie rather than privileging one of its main 
characters as a solitary figure. It winds up with a scene that establishes 
Woo's screen personality: a shoot-out in a chapel that sees candles, 
bullets, and bodies flying across the screen as doves flutter (sometimes 
in snatches of slow motion) and liturgical music swells, with blotches of 
blood on bright-white clothes and tears flowing as freely as gore.  KN

Drugstore Cowboy  Gus Van Sant, 1989
771
Gus van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy is a funny and very moving account of 
addiction. We follow a gang of junkies led by Bob (Matt Dillon) who feed 
their habits by robbing drugstores in Portland, Oregon. The petty crimes 
and the repetitive lives of the addicts are chronicled by the director 
without moralizing or comment. But the fragile nature of the relationships 
within the gang, and particularly the doomed love of Bob and his wife 
Dianne (Kelly Lynch), are as well observed as they are brilliantly acted.
While the plot may seem simple—run-ins with police and other 
junkies—there is real tragedy as the film moves toward its denoument. 
When one of the gang overdoses and Bob has to smuggle the body out 
of a motel hosting a sherriff's convention and then bury the body in the 
woods, he decides that he has to go straight. In the detox hostel he 
meets up with an old friend, a junkie priest played by William Burroughs, 
and their conversations punctuate his final encounters with the world 
he has left. The entire film is magnificent but these final conversations 
between Dillon and Burroughs are sublime.  CM

Astenicheskij sindrom  Kira Muratova, 1989
The Asthenic Syndrome
A great movie about the contemporary world, but far from an easy one 
to take or understand, because it breaks so many rules about what films 
are supposed to be like. Directed in 1989 by Kira Muratova, The Asthenic 
Syndrome has been perhaps rightly called the only "masterpiece of 
glasnost." It begins with a powerful, black-and-white narrative about a 
woman doctor named Natasha (Olga Antonova) who is in an exploding, 
aggressive rage about the death of her husband. The film then turns into 
an even more unorthodox tale in color about a disaffected high-school 
English teacher named Nikolai (played by cowriter Sergei Popov) who 
periodically falls asleep regardless of what is happening around him. The 
title alludes to a form of weakness or disability that presumably 
encompasses both the doctor's aggressiveness and the schoolteacher's 
passivity. Muratova evidently regards these two forms of behavior as 
emblematic of what is blighted about contemporary society.
Though this epic has plenty to say about postcommunist Russia, it is 
also one of the few recent masterpieces that deal more generally with 
the demons loose in today's world. And it is interesting to add that at 
least two of Muratova's subsequent features, Three Stories (1987) and 
Chekhov's Motifs (2002), have continued the process of extreme 
stylization in the acting as well as the practice of squeezing together two 
or more fictions. Both factors sharply distinguish her late work from such 
relatively conventional and relatively naturalistic early features as Brief 
Encounters (1967), in which she acted.  JRos

Do the Right Thing  Spike Lee, 1989
It's sometimes hard to remember, living now on a global, pop-culture 
landscape that has been so thoroughly sculpted by the language, music, 
aesthetics, and politics of hip-hop, that there was a time when the force 
of that youth movement hadn't yet been tapped. At the same time, 
given the materialistic, shallow artistry that has come to define 
mainstream hip-hop and the music (rap) that is its soundtrack, it's 
sometimes just as hard to remember when the music was radical, 
subversive, and proudly revolutionary. Spike Lee's social protest film Do 
the Right Thing brilliantly captures that moment when rap was urgent 
and conscious; more impressively, it channels the issues of racism, race 
pride, class struggle, and the joys and grinds of everyday urban life into 
a paradoxically brightly colored snapshot. Incendiary and insightful, it's 
a film borne of hip-hop, when hip-hop had something to say.
The film's opening is set to the music—an assault of beats and 
booming voices—of hip-hop elders and icons Public Enemy. Filled with 
a cast of vibrant characters whose intersecting day-in-the-life stories are 
used to illuminate larger sociopolitical points, Do the Right Thing is 
anchored by Mookie (Lee), a pizza delivery boy who canvases the 
neighborhood making his deliveries. We meet his shrill, demanding 
girlfriend (Rosie Perez), cantankerous but lovable elders (Ruby Dee and 
Ossie Davis), and neighborhood youth as represented by, among others, 
Radio Raheem (Bil Nunn) and Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito). We also 
meet the Italian pizzeria owner, Sal (Danny Aiello), whose ambivalence 
about his black clientele is forked in the differing attitudes of his racist 
son Pino (John Turturro) and more color-blind child Vito (Richard Edson). 
Rounding out the characters is a profane, hilarious Greek chorus of 
middle-aged and elderly black men whose scathing commentary on the 
day's events provides comic relief.
As the hot summer's day progresses and tempers flare, ordinary 
slights take on huge significance. Sexual and racial tensions that lie just 
below the surface of daily exchanges explode, and the resulting fiery 
violence is a clear metaphor for the state of late twentieth-century 
American race relations. Controversial and frequently misrepresented 
by detractors (many of whom claimed that the film was a call to riot), Do 
the Right Thing is an unapologetic, angry film. It's also filled with images 
of black love and camaraderie that continue to be so rare in American 
cinema that they're radical. Shot in bright colors that all but pop off the 
screen, filled with slightly skewed camera angles often suggesting the 
freewheeling style of comic books, and edited to reflect the energetic 
thrust of the most propulsive rap track, Do the Right Thing has become 
one of the most influential movies in the history of filmmaking, not only 
for its stylistic flourishes, but for giving filmmakers permission to draw 
from the experiences of lives previously ignored or distorted in both 
Hollywood and so-called independent film. It dares you to dismiss it.  EH

The Unbelievable Truth  Hal Hartley, 1989
The Unbelievable Truth is the highly intriguing, if not always fully 
successful, first feature by independent writer-director Hal Hartley. Shot 
in his hometown on Long Island, he gives us, among other characters, a 
mechanic mistaken for a priest (Robert Burke) returning from a prison 
sentence, a politically alienated teenager (Adrienne Shelly) who later finds 
work as a model for lingerie ads, and the teenager's mercenary redneck 
father (Christopher Cooke). Burke, Shelly, and Cooke would go on to work 
with Hartley again in subsequent features—Burke in Simple Men (1992) 
and Flirt (1993), Shelly in Trust (1990), and Cooke in Trust and Simple Men.
Fantasies about global annihilation obsess the teenager, fantasies 
about money obsess her father, and fantasies about a pair of murders 
apparently committed by the mechanic obsess almost everyone else in 
the film. The unvarnished quality of some of the acting limits this effort 
in spots, but the quirky originality of the story, characters, and 
filmmaking, and the offbeat, deadpan humor serve to keep the audience 
curious and alert.  JRos

Michael Moore's black-comedy documentary about the consequences 
of massive layoffs by General Motors in Flint, Michigan, and the writer-
director's own unsuccessful attempts to meet with Roger Smith, GM's 
chairman, and bring him to Flint to see what his actions have wrought, 
is certainly impressive, as well as bracing proof that movies can be both 
hugely entertaining and politically sharp at the same time. Mixed in with 
Moore's justifiably lethal anger, however, is a certain sense of glib 
superiority over Flint's victims and corporate villains, which one is invited 
to share, but the breezy results, many of which are exhilarating and never 
boring, are not exactly devoid of cheap shots and journalistic 
oversimplifications. These qualities could be said to carry over into 
Moore's second big success, Bowling for Columbine, thirteen years later. 
Thus the cheerful heartlessness of Reaganism that is the film's subject is 
not entirely irrelevant to its own methods, and critic Dave Kehr aptly 
dubbed Roger & Me around the time of its initial release, "the first feel-
good atrocity film."
Roger & Me's rather cavalier manner of juggling certain timeframes 
and sequences of events led at least one reviewer at the time to dismiss 
Moore as a charlatan. Despite this there are irrefutable facts in his 
muckraking. Moore's populist desire to entertain, which ensured his 
commercial success and the wider reach of his ideas, also entailed some 
self-aggrandizement as well as a certain number of journalistic shortcuts. 
In the final analysis it is worth asking which is more important: corporate 
greed, or Moore's ego trip.  JRos

Roger & Me  Michael Moore, 1989

1989
Writer-director Steven Soderbergh—now best known for Erin Brockovich 
(2000) and the Oscar-winning Traffic (2000)—made a striking debut 
with this drama that went on to win the Golden Palm and Best Actor 
awards at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.
Written in just eight days and filmed in five weeks on a budget of just 
$1.2 million, Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been credited with transforming 
the independent movie industry, enticing mainstream audiences to see 
small-scale indie films they otherwise would have missed. And this film 
is certainly unmissable, a sly, sexy, and intelligent look at modern-day 
relationships set in the steamy South.
Andie MacDowell, in her first leading role following appearances in 
St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan (1984), stars as 
Ann Millaney, a perfect wife stuck in a dull, almost sexless marriage to 
John (Peter Gallagher), an egotistical lawyer. Unbeknownst to Ann, John 
is having an affair with her feisty sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo), but 
all the secrets and lies in their combined relationships are revealed 
when John's former school friend Graham (James Spader) drives into 
town and forces the others to face truths about themselves and each 
other. Graham, of course, has surprises of his own to be exposed—he 
has a trunk full of videotapes, each featuring a woman talking openly 
about her sexual secrets. But how did he get all these women to open 
up to him?
Soderbergh's dialogue is breathtakingly frank, and he fills his film 
with skilled actors who deliver their lines brilliantly. Former model 
MacDowell—who has yet to give a better performance—is terrific as 
the prissy Southern flower, and San Giacomo a discovery as her 
uninhibited sibling. But the film really belongs to Spader—a former teen 
actor (Pretty in Pink [1986], Less than Zero [1987]) who here shows an 
unexpected depth and sensitivity as he expertly portrays the most 
interesting of Soderbergh's repressed quartet. Superb.  JB

1989
There are two separate stories to tell here. One is this wonderful story 
that happens sometimes, most of the time unpredictably: the rise of a 
New Wave, of an artistic movement in a country, and of the emergence 
of one or two (rarely more) exceptionally talented filmmakers. This 
occurred in the 1980s in Taiwan with the New Cinema movement, and 
one of the most talented directors who appeared at the time was Hou 
Hsiao-hsien. He began by making personal, autobiographical films (The 
Boys from Fengkuei [1983], A Summer at Grandpa's [1984], The Time to 
Live and the Time to Die [1985]) that revealed his sense of pace, the 
physical intensity of his shots, and the suggestive strength in the 
apparently indifferent way he filmed even the most simple situations.
Then there is a second story, concerning that inevitable moment 
when a nation needs its cinema to tell itself and the world its own tale—
its collective autobiography, so to speak. In 1989, the vanishing of the 
military dictatorship that had ruled the island for forty years presented 
filmmakers the opportunity to tell the recent story of Taiwan. And this is 
what Hou, the "subjective avant-garde auteur," decided to do (and what 
he continued to do with The Puppetmaster [1993] and Good Men, Good 
Women [1995]). A City of Sadness, which was clearly viewed in its own 
country as a huge step forward in the ability of cinema to look, finally, at 
Taiwan's recent past, constitutes a real turning point—a fact which also 
enabled the film to become a great public success.
A combination of historical fresco and modern film, the complex 
narrative structure of A City of Sadness (based on the intricate lives of 
four brothers) and the enormous amount of historical information it 
embodies convey a beautiful and emotional sense of the period, the 
group, the individual, the inner feelings, and the demands of the various 
communities each brother belongs to—willingly or not. A City of Sadness 
is not only a masterpiece, it is a model for all those films that intend to 
show the major events of a country, most of the time becoming boring 
monuments instead.  J-MF

S'en fout la mort  Claire Denis, 1990
No Fear, No Die
777
French director Claire Denis refers to her films Chocolat (1988), No Fear 
No Die (1990), and I Can't Sleep (1994) as her trilogy about colonialism 
and its aftermath. No Fear, No Die follows, in a quasidocumentary 
fashion, a few months in the lives of Dah (Isaach De Bankolé) and Jocelyn 
(Alex Descas), two black men training roosters for illegal cockfights in 
the basement of a shady suburban nightclub in France. Besides its 
underlying portrayal of exploitation of illegal immigrants, the film's 
claustrophobic, oppressive atmosphere is a fascinating ground for the 
dynamics of power, violence, desire, and cruelty enacted in this marginal 
world, as tensions gradually mount between Jocelyn and the nightclub 
owner's son Michel (Christopher Buchholz). Michel becomes jealous 
of the attention Jocelyn gets not only from his father, but also from 
his father's beautiful girlfriend Toni (Solveig Dommartin), whom both 
men covet.
The rivalry between Jocelyn and Michel, complicated by issues of race 
and power, finds its brutal resolution in a senseless murder at the end of 
No Fear, No Die, highlighting the absurdity of postcolonial violence. The 
close and raw filming of the ritual training of roosters, of the protagonists' 
faces and bodies, as well as the powerful performances of Descas and 
Bankolé, make this film an intense, intimate experience of a facet of 
human behavior triggered by circumstances in which "all men, whatever 
their race, color, or origins, are capable of anything and everything."  CO

Trust  Hal Hartley, 1990
Hal Hartley's second feature—a decided improvement over his first, 
The Unbelievable Truth (1989)—returns to the same basic turf, a Long 
Island commuter town, and features the same lead actress (Adrienne 
Shelly) as an alienated teenager. This time around, Shelly plays a high 
school student who finds herself pregnant, provokes her father's fatal 
heart attack, gets unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend, and 
kicked out of the house by her mother (Merritt Nelson). Then she is 
assaulted, witnesses a kidnapping, and meets an angry and disgruntled 
electronics whiz (Martin Donovan), all in the same day.
It's a credit to the film that this overflow of incident neither strains 
credibility nor becomes exploited for facile comedy. In fact, the real 
story in Trust only begins once the heroine and the electronics whiz 
become involved and their mutual adjustments—including the strains 
represented by their difficult parents—gradually transform both of 
them. Unpredictable while remaining honest to both its characters and 
its milieu, this flaky comedy drama improves as it proceeds, much as 
Hartley's own body of work has often done.  JRos

1990
With this epic, Martin Scorsese returned to the world of tough-talking 
(mostly) Italian-American hoods featured in Mean Streets (1973), 
following thirty years in the lives of a group of neighborhood crooks. 
From hanging around the taxi rank, punk kid Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) 
progresses to hijacking, airport robberies, extortion, grievous bodily 
harm, drug dealing, and, finally, informing. Along the way, he gets a 
Jewish wife (Lorraine Bracco) who, unlike the Corleone women, finds it 
impossible to keep out of the wholesale sleaze that goes along with her 
husband's way of life. More important, of course, are Henry's close 
male relationships: with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a coolly violent heist 
man, and Tommy (Joe Pesci), an unstable psychopath with hopes of 
getting "made." In the end, Hill is turned by the FBI and informs on his 
few surviving friends, winding up condemned to a Federal Witness 
Protection limbo where if you order spaghetti with marinara sauce you 
get "egg noodles and ketchup."
Drawn from cowriter Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction book Wiseguy, this 
is more matter-of-fact in its insider's chattiness than the mythmaking 
The Godfather (1972). Indeed, Goodfellas is almost a companion piece to 
the comical Married to the Mob (1988) as it observes the manners and 
fashions of the organized crime world. Underlaid by a constant barrage 
of cunningly selected pop singles, from Tony Bennett to Phil Spector to 
Sid Vicious, this panorama of illegal America stays with a group of wholly 
repulsive, increasingly corrupt people for nearly two and a half hours 
but never loses its fascination. De Niro, underplaying in a secondary role, 
is quietly chilling as the repressed but unpredictable robber who 
sometimes seems to think he'll only be safe once he has killed everyone 
he knows. However, the show-off monster is Pesci, who plays the 
maniacal Tommy as a homicidal Lou Costello, segueing instantly from 
foul-mouthed rat-tat-tat wisecrack routines into mortifying threats or 
slap-in-the-face atrocities. Without moralizing, the film manages to 
convey the dead-end horrors of a life not just outside the law but 
outside all possible law.  KN

Based on a real incident, Abbas Kiarostami's masterly film first appears 
to present itself as a purely documentary reconstruction of the events 
leading to the trial of Hossein Sabzian for attempted fraud. 
Kiarostami's subtle approach to the narrative comprises a witty, 
illuminating, highly inventive exploration of the symbiotic relationships 
between truth and falsehood, appearance and reality, documentary and 
fiction. The characters are "played" by themselves. Some events are 
dramatically recreated, some simply described, others—like the trial 
itself (at which, strangely, Kiarostami is often allowed to take over 
questioning)—are presented as documentary footage. Although the 
narrative line, for all its flashbacks, is clear, the way in which it is presented 
and the status of what we're shown—is this for real, or acted out?—keep 
shifting, and the film becomes a multilayered investigation into that most 
elusive of phenomena: the Truth.
But even as he undermines our assumptions about objectivity, 
Kiarostami directs us toward one small, inescapable truth: that everyone, 
to quote Renoir, has his reasons. Besides being a funny, thought-
provoking deconstruction of documentary conventions, Close-Up is a 
tribute both to the power of cinema and to the essential goodness—and 
imaginative capabilities—of ordinary people.  GA

A 1940s-style romantic comedy given a modern twist, Pretty Woman was 
a refreshing antidote to the macho wham-bam movies that dominated 
Hollywood's output in the late 1980s. One of the highest-grossing 
pictures of 1990, it succeeded in making the "date movie" popular again. 
Pretty Woman also gave huge career boosts to its two stars, Richard 
Gere (who hadn't had a hit since the mid-1980s) and Julia Roberts, who 
earned an Oscar nomination for her performance. Gere is at his suave 
best as Edward Lewis, a business mogul on a trip to L.A. who winds up 
lost near Hollywood Boulevard, and asks hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold 
Vivian (Roberts in a miniscule miniskirt and PVC thigh boots) for 
directions back to his Beverly Hills hotel. Being the smart and sensible 
prostitute she is, Vivian offers to take him where he needs to go, and it's 
not long before she has charmed him into hiring her for the week to be 
his "beck-and-call girl." In return for her time and effort she gets unlimited 
use of his credit card to buy clothes and learns how to dine at a fancy 
restaurant (thanks to the friendly hotel concierge, played by Hector 
Elizondo). And, no surprise, Vivian falls in love with her benefactor.
The whole thing is highly improbable, of course. For starters, it's 
unlikely any Hollywood Boulevard streetwalkers look as well groomed as 
Vivian. The success of Roberts in the role of a hooker is politically incorrect, 
but the sheer charm of Pretty Woman never fails to shine through.  JB

King of New York  Abel Ferrara, 1990
Abel Ferrara's King of New York is a chronicle of the downfall of New York 
drug kingpin Frank White (Christopher Walken), who, after years of illegal 
activity, decides to expiate his sins by building a hospital in an inner-city 
neighborhood. His attempts to give something back to the community 
encounter hostile resistance from every side—his Chinese drug partner 
(Joey Chin), the local Mafia, and an overzealous tough cop (David 
Caruso) ready to do anything to bring him down. Frank's futile efforts 
trigger an ethnically motivated gangster war that ends in a bloody 
showdown among the city's criminal factions.
Walken gives a tour de force performance in the lead as a ruthless 
killer with a twisted sense of morality, and Laurence Fishburne as White's 
henchman Jimmy Jump contributes to the film's frenetic energy. Like all 
of Ferrara's work, King of New York is not an easy movie to watch. It is 
violent and disturbing, with a high body count, further exploring the 
director's interest in characters who seek salvation against the backdrop 
of a drug-infested and violent New York City underground—depicted 
here as the archetypal Gotham City. Ferrara's 1992 follow-up, Bad 
Lieutenant, featuring Harvey Keitel as an unnamed cop who is as corrupt 
as Walken's White is devious, takes the director's bloody yet introspective 
examination of sin and redemption even further.  RDe

"I want to see the frontier . . . before it's gone." An idealistic Union soldier 
is rewarded for gallantry in the Civil War with his choice of assignment, 
an outpost in the Dakotas. There he is befriended by a tribe of Lakota 
Sioux and goes native, only to witness the encroachment of the white 
man and twilight falling on the great horse culture of the Plains.
Heartthrob Kevin Costner's directorial debut—ambitious, epic, some 
of it in Lakota with subtitles—Dances with Wolves had Hollywood wags 
predicting it would be another Heaven's Gate (1980). But Costner had the 
last laugh, riding away with seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best 
Director (over Martin Scorsese for Goodfellas).
"Dances with Wolves" is the name the Indians give to Costner's 
Lieutenant John Dunbar. He is by stages terrified, intrigued, then 
captivated by his feather-decked neighbors and their way of life. And 
the story of how he finds himself and comes by his new name is as 
enchanting a Western as ever was—rich, lyrical, warm, full of unlooked-
for laughs, heartbreaking, and spectacularly cinematic. Costner's 
direction is remarkably accomplished, taking each elegiac, mystical, or 
romantic interlude to an exciting action payoff, with battles, buffalo, the 
spectacular plains of South Dakota, and the handsome cast all gifts to 
Australian cinematographer and Mad Max (1979) veteran Dean Semler. 
The Indians are portrayed with unprecedented respect and affectionate 
intimacy as proud, quick, and humorous by Native Americans who are 
both magnificent looking and engaging, notably Graham Greene as 
shaman Kicking Bird and Rodney A. Grant as warrior Wind in His Hair.
Sentiment is strong, at times exhaustingly melodramatic. But the 
film's eloquence and evocative beauty make it enduringly enjoyable. A 
year later Costner presented the special edition, with an hour of 
additional material which expands the hero's romance with Stands with 
a Fist (Mary McDonnell) and shows the fate of captured white buffalo 
hunters. But there is no new major action scene and the added length, 
lovely and involving for devotees, does slow the pace. Action fans prefer 
the original, utterly enjoyable three-hour version.  AE

Directed by John McNaughton, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is loosely 
based on the story of real serial murderer Henry Lee Lucas. It is exceptional 
for its realism of style and amoral viewpoint, and it remains with the 
viewer as one of the most disturbing movies ever made.
Henry flouts horror-film conventions with its flat narrative, a build-up 
of episodes where the expected murders occur in unexpected ways. In 
one scene, Henry (Michael Rooker) kills two prostitutes in his car and 
then goes with his roommate Otis (Tom Towles) to buy a hamburger. 
The plot of Henry (insofar as it has one) follows events that occur 
after Otis's sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) moves into their small Chicago 
apartment, disrupting this pair's somewhat repressed homosexual 
partnership in crime. A low-budget movie, Henry excels in depicting the 
life of drifters amid a grubby lower-class milieu. At one point the film 
cuts from the corpse of a woman Henry has killed to show a nasty matron 
in Becky's beauty salon spouting racist slurs.
Becky romanticizes about Henry when she hears how he killed his 
mother. Rooker brings a surly, Brandoesque appeal to the role of this 
psychopath, which helps to explain Becky's bad choice of love objects. 
The film culminates in two especially upsetting murders. First, Henry and 
Otis kill a suburban family. After witnessing the mayhem, we suddenly 
realize that we have watched this footage alongside the killers, who are 
sitting on the sofa reviewing their home movie of the deed. Later, Henry 
kills Otis, whom he has caught raping Becky. Henry and Becky leave town, 
but the next morning, in the film's final sequences, Henry leaves their 
hotel room alone, pausing to drop off a heavy suitcase by the roadside. 
Henry is so understated it might seem dull to younger viewers jaded 
by the gory excesses of other post-1980s horror flicks. Nor does it boast 
a charmingly elegant killer like Hannibal Lecter. Instead, Henry evokes 
horror through gritty realism and excellent acting. The film is not fun to 
watch, but it is important in that it forces viewers into questioning our 
cultural fascination with serial killers.  CFr

Archangel  Guy Maddin, 1990
783
Guy Maddin, the underground cult wizard from Winnipeg, followed up  
Tales from the Gimli Hospital (1988) with Archangel, an even stranger 
black-and-white feature made on a heftier budget. The film involves 
amnesiac victims of mustard gas during World War I and the Russian 
Revolution. The hero, a Canadian soldier (Kyle McCulloch), mistakes a 
nurse (Kathy Marykuca) for his dead love; she's married to a Belgian 
aviator (Ari Cohen) who can't remember he's married, and she gets so 
confused that she winds up mistaking the Canadian for the Belgian.
There are other complications, some of which, like the amnesia, 
suggest a deranged remake of Random Harvest (1942), but Archangel 
often appears to be about nothing at all—except perhaps Maddin's 
obvious love for late silent and early talkie studio productions with 
kitschy pictorial effects, as well as offbeat surrealist conceits (such as a 
hailstorm of bunny rabbits falling into trenches). The results may not be 
consistently funny or affecting, but it never seems that Maddin is out 
to produce straight-out comedy or camp, much less serious drama. 
What comes across is a fascinating fetishist delirium, where memories 
of remote war movies get recycled into something that is alternately 
creepy and beautiful.  JRos

Total Recall  Paul Verhoeven, 1990
Cult science fiction author Philip K. Dick's story We Can Remember It for 
You Wholesale is impressively translated onto the screen with numerous 
jaw-dropping special effects and lashings of violence by Dutch director 
Paul Verhoeven, who had previously scored a similar sci-fi hit with the 
1987 blockbuster RoboCop.
Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Doug Quaid, an everyday Joe (albeit 
one built like Hercules) who has recurring dreams about living on Mars. 
His wife (Sharon Stone) dismisses his fantasies, so Doug pays a visit to a 
virtual reality vacation company and gets hooked up to a machine that 
will simulate a trip to the red planet. Unfortunately, it also gives his brain 
a good zapping, and Doug wakes up from his virtual trip believing he is 
a secret agent. He soon finds himself pursued by various human and 
mutant heavies while he tries to work out in his head what is fact and 
what is fiction.
Many of Dick's favorite themes (also explored in Do Androids Dream 
of Electric Sheep?, which became Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi film Blade 
Runner in 1982) are explored in Total Recall—identity, perception, 
memories, real and manufactured—but never at the expense of action. 
And action there certainly is, from a fun fight between Stone and 
Schwarzenegger, their sparring dialogue an added bonus, to the final, 
gruesome but gripping showdown.  JB

1990
Rather than follow the hugely successful Batman (1989) with another 
special-effects-driven bonanza, director Tim Burton instead delivered a 
delightfully realized movie that was about as far from a mainstream 
Hollywood blockbuster as it was possible to get. The result is Edward 
Scissorhands, a decidedly left-of-center fairy tale that remains the most 
whimsical and touching film of Burton's career so far.
The Edward of the title (Johnny Depp) is not a man at all, but the 
creation of The Inventor (an all-too-brief cameo performance from the 
marvelous Vincent Price in his last film role). Edward looks human 
enough, except for one detail—he has scissors instead of hands—and 
he lives a solitary life in a crumbling mansion high above a neighborhood 
of pastel-colored houses. It is only when kindly Avon lady Peg Boggs 
(Dianne Wiest) discovers his hiding place that Edward descends to the 
"real" world below, and finds himself embraced by Peg's neighbors when 
he displays his special talent for hairdressing, dog grooming, and hedge 
shaping. Life for the trusting and innocent Edward is complicated, 
however, when he falls for Peg's cheerleader daughter Kim (Winona 
Ryder) and is soon coerced by her boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) into 
committing a crime.
One of the many successes Burton pulls off in this delightfully odd 
film is to cast his various players against type in this eccentric dreamlike 
world. Hall, best known for playing the nerd in John Hughes's The 
Breakfast Club (1985), succeeds in showing a far nastier side in his role as 
oafish boyfriend Jim. Ryder, on the other hand, devoid of the ample 
cynicism she displayed in Heathers (1988), brings a delicate touch to her 
role as the nice girl on the block. It is Depp, however, who impresses the 
most, creating a character trapped by his incomplete body, conveying 
Edward's frustration with few words, his pale, scarred face showing the 
hurt when he discovers that even his gentlest touch with his scissor 
hands can cause pain. An ambitious, beautifully conceived modern-day 
fairy tale.  JB

Salomon Perel, played by Marco Hofschneider, changes uniforms, 
languages, and identities in an effort to survive the Holocaust. Renowned 
Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland refrains from passing judgment 
on her chameleon-like protagonist as she represents unspeakable 
psychological tortures and miraculous escapes from a matter-of-fact 
distance, not dwelling on agony or bloodbath. This is what renders this 
incredible story so shockingly believable and separates it from other films 
about the Holocaust.
Set between 1938 and 1945, Europa Europa is actually based on the 
real-life adventures of Salomon "Solly" Perel. Solly is a young Polish Jew 
from Germany, whose life takes a grotesque turn when the Nazis break 
into his family's apartment. With the family dispersed, Solly ends up 
alone, saved only by the Nazi uniform he puts on. This act launches his 
career as a performer. First, he winds up in a Russian orphanage in 
eastern Poland, where he receives a thorough education in communist 
dogma, renouncing his Jewish identity and denouncing religion as "the 
opiate of the masses." Hitler's troops take him back to Germany, where 
he is employed as a Russian interpreter, accepted as an Aryan. The irony 
and danger of his performance reach their epitome when he joins the 
Hitler Youth, where he is taught how to recognize and kill Jews.
Hiding his circumcision becomes particularly dangerous when his 
good looks win the hearts of a gay Nazi officer and a desirable but 
excessively anti-Semitic girl, played by Julie Delpy. As the only physical 
reminder of Solly's true identity, circumcision becomes a rich metaphor 
in the movie. Some of the most powerfully ambiguous moments of 
Europa Europa show Solly overidentifying with the role he is playing, 
suggesting that true identity might not be possible at all. Unsurprisingly, 
there is no catharsis or tragedy at the end; although when Solly is 
miraculously reunited with his lost brother Isaak (René Hofschneider), 
we sense that his performance is far from over.  AI

Boyz 'N the Hood  John Singleton, 1991
Given early 1970s heralds like Melvin Van Peebles and Gordon Parks, the 
1980s saw a select few African-American filmmakers break into the 
mainstream. Foremost among them were Robert Townsend and Spike 
Lee, each crafting witty comedy-dramas about the condition of black 
America. Yet it was John Singleton's autobiographical debut, Boyz 'N the 
Hood, that fully introduced a so-called black American cinematic voice 
into the critical establishment. For his efforts Singleton earned two 
Academy Award nominations, and his film was a runaway hit that 
provided Columbia Pictures with a monster windfall.
Opening in the aftermath of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympiad, 
Singleton's drama settles on three ten-year-olds, Tre (Desi Arnez Hines II), 
Doughboy (Baha Jackson), and Ricky (Donovan McCrary). Raised in 
single-parent homes, their world is riven with gang violence, police 
brutality, and economic hardship. When Tre's mother Reva (Angela 
Bassett) deposits him at the front door of his father Jason "Furious" 
(Laurence Fishburne), he gets a crash course in masculinity and 
transforms into an upwardly mobile teen.
Flash forward seven years. Tre (now played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a 
high school senior with a part-time job, an application to a historic black 
college, and a girlfriend named Brandi (Nia Long). Doughboy (Ice Cube) 
is a gangbanger and loafer trading on the patience of his mother, 
Mrs. Baker (Tyra Ferrell), while his brother Ricky (Morris Chestnut) builds 
himself up as a Division I college football draft prospect. Though trying 
to escape the 'hood, Tre still remains linked to his neighborhood friends. 
When Doughboy's underworld connections threaten the trio, Ricky is 
killed in a drive-by shooting. Afterward Tre confronts his father's sage 
training and manages to avoid the mistakes of his downtrodden world. 
Through an ending scrawl we learn he escapes the trap of poverty and 
violence and accompanies Brandi to college.
Pedantic but expertly orchestrated through a moving depiction of 
intraracial violence in the American inner city, Boyz 'N the Hood is a vividly 
memorable morality tale addressed to the same youth represented on 
screen. After a sobering dedication reminding us of the number of young 
black men killed by other young black men, it launches into a realistic, 
profanity-laden, and affecting coming-of-age story.
Noteworthy for the screen debut of rapper Ice Cube, Singleton's film 
evinces an awareness of Hollywood storytelling conventions and 
demonstrates a real affection for the topical influence of hip-hop music. 
Organized in a clear three-act structure and tending toward broad 
moralizing, the picture therefore exudes a professional polish. But it is 
also scored with the percussive beats and hypnotic raps of various chart-
toppers lending their sounds to Tre's escape, making Boyz 'N the Hood 
the achievement of a career, the origin of a wave of small-scale, black-
centered inner city and ghetto dramas that flourished in the 1990s.  GC-Q

Few movies have treated religion seriously, and fewer still have explored 
evangelical Christianity on its own theological terms. This is what 
Michael Tolkin does in The Rapture, which may be viewed with equal 
pleasure as a spiritual melodrama, a faith-based fable, and an eccentric 
fairy tale with roots in a real religious subculture.
Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, a swinging single who enjoys cruising for 
foursomes with a sleazy male friend. Then she hears about a religious 
movement that emphasizes a personal relationship with God, whose day 
of judgment—complete with a transcendent "Rapture" that will whisk 
good souls to heaven—is said to be coming soon. Her newfound faith 
helps her weather turbulent storms, such as her husband's death. When 
she thinks the end of times is imminent, she takes her daughter to a 
lonely patch of desert, where they await God's saving hand. In the film's 
most audacious twist, the Rapture actually does arrive, but by now 
suffering has led her to reject the idea of a just and merciful deity.
At once a psychological drama, a reflection on faith and free will, 
and a crisp 1990s variation on what Hollywood used to call the 
"woman's picture," this offbeat parable offers rich rewards for the open-
minded moviegoer.  DS

The Rapture  Michael Tolkin, 1991
Films about artists are risky, courting terrible clichés—romantic genius 
in the garret, tormented soul projected onto canvas—to show what 
someone goes through while shaping sensations and intuitions into 
pictures. Jacques Rivette accepts the challenge gleefully in La belle 
noiseuse, extrapolating from a short story by Balzac: This will be the story 
of an "unfinished masterpiece," produced and then hidden by a famous 
artist in his twilight years.
Rivette and his writers, Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent, juggle 
many themes skillfully. On one level, the film offers a glimpse into the 
privileged world of art, where creators, dealers, and confidants weave a 
subtly erotic tangle. At the film's core, Rivette studies, with a minute 
attention to detail and duration, the dancelike rapport between an artist, 
Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) and his mostly naked model, Marianne 
(Emmanuelle Béart). Their sessions wheel through many moods: 
Frustration, aggression, exuberance. The master-slave relationship shifts. 
Slowly, through many trials, an artistic work takes form.
As Frenhofer faces the disturbance in his marriage to Liz (Jane Birkin), 
warily watches the emergence of a new generation, and confronts the 
specter of his own mortality, it is hard not to see this melancholy hero 
as the director's own self-portrait.  AM

The Beautiful Troublemaker

Epic in scope if not always in scale, Edward Yang's subtle and rich 
portrait of Taiwan fits so many details into its deceptively brisk four-
hour running time that it's a wonder Yang delivered the film as short as 
it is. Set during a single Taipei school year in the early 1960s, A Brighter 
Summer Day depicts a country still reeling from the disruptive influx of 
Chinese Nationalists (led by the repressive Chiang Kai-shek) in 1948. 
Yang's Taiwan is torn between communism and democracy, nationalism 
and liberality, with confusion, alienation, and uncertainty leading to a 
sometimes debilitating anomie.
Yet as powerful as A Brighter Summer Day may be, Yang infuses it 
with touches of humor and humanism that temper the distressing 
atmosphere of impending doom. The direction is patient and serene; 
the film is like a masterful symphony of dozens of characters whose tone 
and tempo are deftly orchestrated by Yang. Favoring static or slow-
moving long shots over close-ups, Yang gives his cast great freedom to 
explore their emotions (or apparent lack thereof), acting for the story 
and each other and not just the camera; yet Yang clearly wants the film 
to be about specific places and things as much as people. That A Brighter 
Summer Day reveals facts and plot points with the care, planning, and 
deliberation of a great novel therefore comes as no surprise. 
Neither does the emotional weight of the film's tragic conclusion, the 
payoff of all of Yang's rigorous narrative design (itself the product of four 
years of preparation), which manages to seamlessly weave together 
the story of Taipei street gangs, puppy love, rock and roll, lost cultural 
signifiers, and the search for a national identity. While often compared 
loosely to Nicholas Ray's moody classic Rebel Without A Cause (1955), 
A Brighter Summer Day is so much more. A masterpiece of the Taiwanese 
New Wave and a cinematic highpoint of the tail end of the twentieth 
century, this is a film whose grasp of period and place is masterful 
almost beyond the realm of mere storytelling. It's like a multifaceted 
photo album composed of truly moving, thought-provoking pictures.  JKl

JFK  Oliver Stone, 1991
Never a stranger to controversy, Oliver Stone followed up his powerful 
post-Vietnam movie Born on the Fourth of July (1989) with a film that 
angered and amazed people in equal measure—his questioning, 
overwhelming, urgent conspiracy movie JFK.
Many people believe that we don't know the whole truth about the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Do 
we really think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone? Does the Warren 
Commission report, which attempted to come to a conclusion, really 
provide the answers? Although many people have debated whether 
more than one person pulled a trigger that day, Stone went one further 
and committed some of the many theories to celluloid, and in doing so 
delivers a fascinating film that raises even more questions than it answers.
At the picture's heart is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the real-life New 
Orleans district attorney who had his own theories about who shot JFK 
and conducted an investigation into the matter from 1966 to 1969. Stone 
quite rightly doesn't buy into all of Garrison's theories—some believe he 
was a loose cannon who couldn't distinguish real clues from crackpot 
conspiracy ideas. But the director uses him as a push-off point, the 
symbolic center of a film simply because he is the only man in America 
who even attempted to bring anyone to justice for what must be the 
most famous murder of all time (and one that remains incompletely 
solved, shocking when you realize how many witnesses were present).
Using documentary footage—including the infamous home movie 
shot by Abraham Zapruder—as well as flashbacks, reconstructions, quick 
editing, and a skillful use of words and music, Stone weaves many ideas 
and theories together using the huge mountain of evidence and witness 
testimony without ever confusing or hoodwinking his audience. We don't 
get a result by the time the end credits roll three breathtaking hours later, 
but we do know—as if there was any doubt in our minds previously—
that it was impossible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have acted alone.
And for those who were not alive or weren't old enough to remember 
the events of 1963, they are all here—the shooting of Kennedy during 
a cavalcade through Dallas, Jack Ruby's murder of Oswald, and so on. We 
see them as Garrison does, and Stone cleverly shows us what would 
convince this ordinary man to wade through so many reports and 
stories to seek out conspiracies that may have involved the CIA, Castro 
supporters, or various fringe groups. He would not succeed in getting 
us to care so completely about this search for truth without a strong 
central performance from Costner, who holds your attention throughout 
the film despite the numerous heavyweight actors who stroll in and out 
playing small roles—from Tommy Lee Jones as suspect Clay Shaw to Joe 
Pesci, Gary Oldman (as Oswald), Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter 
Matthau, Kevin Bacon, and Sissy Spacek, all of whom are superb. A truly 
astonishing piece of filmmaking from a one-of-a-kind director.  JB

Richard Linklater's delightfully different and immensely enjoyable second 
feature was the first one to get any substantial distribution, after the 
more obscure and more obviously cinephiliac Super 8mm opus It's 
Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (1988). Slacker takes us on 
a twenty-four-hour tour of the flaky dropout culture of Austin, Texas, 
which has remained Linklater's headquarters throughout his multifaceted 
career. Unlike all his subsequent films to date, Slacker doesn't have 
anything resembling a continuous plot except in the most literal way 
that it moves chronologically and geographically through part of a day 
in Austin, but it's brimming with weird characters and wonderful talk 
(which often seems improvised, though it was all scripted by Linklater, 
apparently with the input of some of the participants, as in his 2001 
animated film, Waking Life). The structure of dovetailing dialogues calls 
to mind an extremely laid-back variation of Luis Buñuel's The Phantom 
of Liberty (1974) or Jacques Tati's Playtime (1967), in which various events 
are glued together simply by virtue of appearing in proximity within the 
same patch of time and space. Combining a certain formal logic with an 
illogical drive toward spinning out gratuitous fantasies and digressions 
is an impulse that follows Linklater through many of his subsequent 
pictures, but it's likely that this combination has never been displayed 
quite as brazenly as it is here.
"Every thought you have fractions off and becomes its own reality," 
remarks Linklater himself to a poker-faced cabdriver in the first (and in 
some ways funniest) sequence, again anticipating Waking Life by spouting 
fanciful philosophy from the back seat of a car. And the remainder of the 
movie amply illustrates this notion with its diverse paranoid conspiracy 
and assassination theorists, serial-killer buffs, musicians, cultists, college 
students, pontificators, petty criminals, street people, and layabouts 
(around ninety in all). Even if the movie goes nowhere in terms of narrative 
and winds up with a somewhat arch conclusion, the highly evocative 
scenes give an often hilarious sense of the surviving dregs of 1960s 
culture and a superbly realized sense of a specific community.  JRos

Thelma & Louise  Ridley Scott, 1991
To call Thelma & Louise a feminist road movie is both accurate and a 
slight disservice to the film—the latter simply because you run the risk 
of minimizing the picture's far demographic reach. The story of a 
browbeaten housewife (Geena Davis) and her sardonic, world-weary 
waitress best friend (Susan Sarandon) who embark on a weekend 
getaway and end up fleeing the law after one of them kills a would-be 
rapist, this film struck a deep chord in audiences across gender, racial, 
and class lines when it was released. It continues to resonate with viewers 
because it not only confidently feminized a genre previously owned by 
men, but it did so by supplying details about social inequities that 
allowed a host of spectators to see themselves in the heroines and to 
identify with both the fright and the flight of the women's journey.
As the titular characters, Sarandon and Davis embody everyday 
American women struggling against a host of obstacles (boorish men, 
dead-end jobs, joyless lives) while simply trying to survive. Director 
Ridley Scott captures a blue-skied, green-plain United States that is the 
stuff of myth and legend, promising freedom—but not to all. And it's 
the gap between that promise and the harsh reality that gives the film 
its punch, making it a biting commentary on America's dreams, truths, 
and limitations.  EH

Wong fei-hung  Tsui Hark, 1991
Once Upon a Time in China
Tsui Hark was Hong Kong's reigning filmmaker in the 1980s and early 
1990s, deftly infusing his eye-popping action films with witty political 
commentary. Once Upon a Time in China finds him breathing new life 
into the chronicles of Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-Hung.
Wong, a legendary healer and martial artist, the subject of several 
of Hark's films dating back to the 1960s, is given a lavish reintroduction 
in this, the first episode in Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time series. Set in 
1875, Wong (Jet Li) faces off against British exploiters and corrupt 
Chinese businessmen in a wild and convoluted plot involving 
imperialism, the press-ganging of Chinese peasants into the building of 
America's railroads, arms smugglers, and disgraced martial artists forced 
to work as hired thugs.
This is popular Hong Kong cinema at its most breathless, aided by the 
superb athleticism of Li, who makes his entry into world stardom as the 
poised and stoical hero. He is the center of dazzling set pieces that include 
a gravity-defying duel fought with ladders, and a standoff between an 
unarmed Wong and an opponent with a gun. Underneath the twisting 
plot and relentless action, however, is a palpable melancholy—a lament 
for a China about to change forever under Western influences.  AT

My Own Private Idaho  Gus Van Sant, 1991
Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, only his third feature and the follow-
up to his 1989 breakthrough Drugstore Cowboy (his 1985 debut, the 
ultra-low-budget Mala Noche, is an unsung treasure), remains the writer-
director's most profound, moving, and complete film—what Desson Howe 
has called "an exquisite, cinematic poem . . . about the eternal search to 
belong somewhere, and the lonely landscape of the soul." Without stifling 
his artistic, even avant-garde impulses for the sake of accessibility and 
mainstream appeal—something he would be accused of doing after 
his maudlin middle-of-the-road dramas Good Will Hunting (1997) and 
Finding Forrester (2000)—Van Sant delivers a delightfully idiosyncratic 
story that relies on images at least as much as words to captivate viewers. 
True, the casting of teen heartthrobs Keanu Reeves (in what may be 
his finest performance to date) and River Phoenix (who would die 
tragically of a drug overdose at the age of twenty-three, right on the cusp 
of a brilliant career) as the leads certainly didn't hurt My Own Private 
Idaho's commercial prospects. But in explicitly thematizing homelessness, 
homosexuality, and teenage prostitution; by offering up a protagonist 
who suffers from narcolepsy and romanticized memories of a mother 
who abandoned him as a child; and in paying extended homage to 
Orson Welles's adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, Chimes at 
Midnight (1965), via a self-consciously anachronistic use of bardspeak 
in several key scenes, no one can claim that Van Sant was unwilling to 
risk alienating unsuspecting middle-American audiences. Though too 
unconventional at both the narrative and stylistic levels to generate 
blockbuster appeal, the picture was lauded by critics, cherished by Van 
Sant enthusiasts, and awarded prizes at several international film festivals.
The film centers on the relationship between Mike (Phoenix) and 
Scott (Reeves), two young hustlers living on the streets in Portland, 
Oregon. Members of a raucous and libidinal family of social outcasts who 
congregate in a condemned building, the pair sell their bodies to 
whomever is buying in order to survive—though we eventually learn 
that Scott is actually the rebellious son of a well-to-do Portland family 
who has chosen this lifestyle largely as a means of humiliating his father. 
With Mike, on the other hand, what you see is definitely what you get: 
a quiet, dreamy, gentle boy who is in love with his best friend, falls 
asleep at the drop of a hat—frequently at inopportune moments, a trait 
the director taps for both humor and pathos—and is obsessed with 
finding his long-lost mom. It is this latter quality that provides the impetus 
for the film's rambling (but never slow) road trip of a plot, as Scott 
accompanies his always-endangered buddy on excursions ranging from 
Idaho to Italy in search of a myth of maternal love that the audience sees 
as the scratchy home-video footage of Mike's mind. In this tender yet 
unsentimental picture, Van Sant succeeds as few other filmmakers have 
in conveying the subjective experience of troubled, disaffected youth.  SJS

The first horror movie to win an Academy Award for Best Picture, The 
Silence of the Lambs also has the distinction of being only the third movie 
in history to win the five major Oscars—after It Happened One Night 
(1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).
An adaptation of Thomas Harris's best-selling novel, the film was a 
deserved winner, featuring superb performances from Jodie Foster and 
Anthony Hopkins, with director Jonathan Demme, previously best 
known for comedy, delivering a continuous shiver down the spines of 
the audience without ever resorting to gore. Foster, as FBI recruit Clarice 
Starling, is asked by her superior, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), to visit 
notorious serial killer Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter (Hopkins, in a role 
originally offered to Jeremy Irons), a former psychiatrist held in a 
subterranean prison who may have an insight into the psyche of a 
murderer named Buffalo Bill (creepily brought to life by Ted Levine), 
which will help the FBI catch him.
Of course, the witty, cultured Hannibal is too clever to give up such 
information easily. He draws Clarice into an uneasy, disturbing 
relationship in which he demands insight into her childhood in return 
for his opinions. It is their exchanges, in Hannibal's dark, gothic dungeon, 
separated only by glass, that are at the film's heart as Foster and, most 
notably Hopkins, give tour de force performances, delivering Ted Tally's 
often quotable words—"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his 
liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"—with delicious (if that 
word can be used in reference to a movie about a cannibal) verve.
Since the movie's release in 1991, Hopkins's memorable character has 
taken on a life of its own, appearing in the disappointing 2001 sequel 
Hannibal—with the role of Clarice played by Julianne Moore—and more 
enjoyable prequel Red Dragon (2002), based on the same Harris novel as 
Michael Mann's superior, stylish Manhunter (1986).  JB

Terminator 2: Judgment Day  James Cameron, 1991
Arnold Schwarzenegger got the best role of his career in director James 
Cameron's 1984 movie The Terminator as a monosyllabic killer robot 
sent from the future, so it was hardly surprising he decided to reprise 
the role seven years later in Cameron's sequel. This time, Arnie's T-800 
cyborg is the good guy, sent by rebel leader of the future John Connor 
(Michael Biehn's character from the original movie) to protect his 
younger self (Edward Furlong) and his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton), 
so they can lead the fight that is to come against machines that will 
take over the earth.
It is what the T-800 is protecting them from that really impresses 
here—a new breed of Terminator, the far nastier T-1000 (Robert Patrick) 
that, thanks to some eye-popping special effects, is made of liquid 
metal and can morph into any shape, taking on the guise of another 
human or reforming from a puddle in his quest to terminate John and 
Sarah. In fact, everything in this sequel is bigger and better, from 
Hamilton's beefed-up physique to the multiple explosions, slick 
direction, and fast-paced action. A spectacular treat.  JB

1991
Creatively combining genres—postapocalyptic sci-fi, black comedy, 
and sweet romance—and offering audiences an impressively oddball 
collection of sounds, colors, actors, and images, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and 
Marc Caro's inspired film Delicatessen was the recipient of several 
European awards and anticipated the pair's subsequent collaboration, 
The City of Lost Children (1995). Jeunet would go on to direct Alien: 
Resurrection in 1997, which was followed by the international 
blockbuster Amélie in 2001.
Delicatessen boasts an unforgettable opening: A mysterious figure 
covered from head to toe in an outfit made entirely of trash anxiously 
attempts to sneak away from a deli (located beneath a dilapidated 
apartment building) by hitching a ride in a garbage truck. Suddenly the 
lid to his can of freedom is violently ripped open and the menacing 
butcher-in-charge (Jean-Claude Drefyus) brings a huge meat cleaver 
down upon him. We soon learn that the butcher's specialty is human 
flesh, and once his new employee—the saw-playing ex-clown Louison 
(a beautifully smush-faced Dominique Pinon)—falls for his bespectacled 
cellist daughter (Marie-Laure Dougnac), the race to make Louison the 
special of the day is on. To save her clown boyfriend from her cannibal 
dad, Julie betrays the latter to a group of lentil-eating rebels who live 
underground. With an eccentric screenplay by comic-book writer Gilles 
Adrien, and a number of darkly humorous set pieces, Delicatessen is a 
feast for the eyes and ears.  SJS

Tongues Untied  Marlon Riggs, 1991
The late Essex Hemphill's politically sparked, erotically charged poetry and 
defiant punk spirit deeply infuse Tongues Untied, the groundbreaking, 
controversial documentary that vogued before Madonna, brought 
homo-thugs to light almost a decade before homophobic rappers and 
an idiotic mainstream media clumsily acknowledged their existence, and 
gave nuance and dignity to the degraded black sissy—all with humor 
and pathos. Performance footage, outrageous set pieces (the famous 
"snap off" scene), queen-on-the-street interviews, stinging critiques of 
homophobia in black films (using clips from Eddie Murphy's Raw [1987] 
and Spike Lee's School Daze [1988]), and talking heads either reciting 
poetry or simply testifying about their lives, add up to a portrait of both 
blackness and queerness that fairly seethes with energy. 
Above all, what makes the film mandatory viewing is the way it 
critiques socially sanctioned bigotry while celebrating art (the creation 
of one's self and life) and Art (the creation of culture and its artifacts) 
that are produced within and beyond the confines of said bigotry. The 
depth and heart of Tongues Untied exposes the failings of both the largely 
white, theory-driven New Queer Cinema and the narrowly defined 
"authenticity" of most post-Spike Lee black cinema. Taking the viewer 
on a tour of a doubly marginalized subculture without pandering to the 
tourist's expectations or preconceptions, Tongues Untied transforms 
object into self-defining subject.  EH
The Double Life of Veronique, Krzysztof Kieslowski's first feature after 
his ten-part masterpiece Decalogue (1988)—launching the European 
coproduction mode of making films that would lead to his Three Colors 
trilogy (Blue [1993], White [1994], and Red [1994])—is an exquisite enigma 
following the parallel lives of two twenty-year-old women, one in Poland 
and one in France, both played by the beautiful Irène Jacob. As in Three 
Colors, European coproduction becomes not only a means of financing 
but also part of the formal and thematic conceptualization of the project.
The Polish Veronika is a talented singer with a heart condition; the 
French Véronique quits her voice lessons and gets involved with a 
puppeteer (Philippe Volter) who writes children's books. Masterfully 
directed, this rather dreamlike film is simultaneously an effort on 
Kieslowski's part to hold onto to his Polish identity and an equally 
determined effort to move beyond it—almost as if the filmmaker were 
dreaming of a resurrected artistic identity for himself as Polish state 
financing went the route of Polish communism.  JRos

Da hong deng long gao gao gua  
Raise the Red Lantern  Yimou Zhang, 1991
Completing a loose trilogy that began with Red Sorghum (1987) and Ju 
Dou (1990), Yimou Zhang's grim adaptation of a novel by Su Tong once 
again stars Li Gong as a young woman who marries a much older man. 
Again he tells a story that explicitly critiques Chinese feudalism and 
indirectly contemporary China. This time, however, the style is quite 
different (despite another key use of the color red) and the vision bleaker.
The heroine, a less sympathetic figure than her predecessors, is a 
university student in the 1920s who becomes the fourth and youngest 
wife of a powerful man in northern China after her stepmother can no 
longer afford to pay for her education. She quickly becomes involved in 
the various intrigues and rivalries between wives that rule her husband's 
world and family tradition. Each wife has her own house and courtyard 
within the palace, and whoever the husband chooses to sleep with on 
a given night receives a foot massage, several lighted red lanterns, and 
the right to select the following day's menu.
Raise the Red Lantern confines us throughout to this claustrophobic 
universe of boxes within boxes, where wives and female servants devote 
their lives to scheming against one another. Zhang confirms his mastery 
and artistry here in many ways, some relatively new (such as his striking 
soundtrack), though the cold, remote, and stifling world he presents here 
offers little emotional release.  JRos

Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse  
Fax Bahr, Eleanor Coppola, & George Hickenlooper, 1991
During the 238 days it took Francis Ford Coppola and company to finish 
principal shooting of Apocalypse Now in the Philippines, Coppola's wife 
Eleanor documented on camera and in writing the nightmarish trials 
experienced by the film's cast, crew, and, perhaps most profoundly its 
renowned director. The astounding commercial and critical success of 
Apocalypse Now following its 1979 release resulted in its attaining the 
almost immediate status of a contemporary American classic. Contributing 
mightily to the legend is Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, 
directed by Fax Bahr with George Hickenlooper, which chronicles the 
turbulent making of Coppola's film. Hearts of Darkness seamlessly blends 
together the on- and off-set footage shot by Eleanor—as well as private 
conversations between her and her husband that Coppola was unaware 
were being taped—with more standard "talking head" interviews with 
numerous people involved in the production (conducted by Bahr more 
than ten years later). Also punctuating the documentary are outtakes 
and scenes left on the cutting-room floor, as well as aural snippets of 
Orson Welles narrating Joseph Conrad's 1901 novel Heart of Darkness 
(upon which the Apocalypse Now screenplay was loosely based) for the 
Mercury Theatre radio program in 1938.
Hearts of Darkness is widely considered among the very best entries 
in the subgenre loosely known as "making of" documentaries, in large 
part because of its creators' access to primary source materials that would 
normally be difficult to obtain. Among the highlights (lowlights for 
those involved): Interruptions on set by the Filipino military; increasingly 
grim confessions of insecurity and despair by the director to his wife; a 
heart attack suffered by the film's main actor, Martin Sheen, during the 
middle of shooting; and heated discussions between Coppola and two 
key cast members, Dennis Hopper (seemingly stoned the entire time 
and incapable of remembering his lines) and Marlon Brando (who 
showed up on set grossly overweight, without having read Conrad's 
novel). Add to all this the sacking of the originally contracted lead, Harvey 
Keitel; a massive typhoon that destroyed numerous sets; Coppola's endless 
dissatisfaction with his film's conclusion; and the fact that a project 
originally scheduled for sixteen weeks of shooting ended up taking more 
than three years to complete, and one has to figure the creators of Hearts 
of Darkness knew they had a "making of" gold mine on their hands.
On the one hand, as Hearts of Darkness labors to make clear beyond 
the shadow of a doubt, Apocalypse Now could only ever have been a 
Coppola picture. On the other hand, it is just as clear that Apocalypse 
Now could never have been the masterpiece it turned out to be had 
Coppola not received such magnificent contributions from his cast and 
crew. Not to mention from Eleanor, who, if Hearts of Darkness is at all to be 
trusted, had much more faith in her husband than he had in himself.  SJS

Romper Stomper  Geoffrey Wright, 1992
Romper Stomper ignited a passionate debate in Australia about whether 
it was a racist or antiracist tract. The passage of time allows us to judge 
the qualities of Geoffrey Wright's impressive feature debut more clearly.
Set within the skinhead subculture of the Melbourne suburb of 
Footscray, Romper Stomper vividly details the disintegration of a gang 
led by Hando (Russell Crowe in an early role)—from bashing up 
Vietnamese Australians to being picked off like scared animals by the 
law and aggrieved citizens alike.
The central focus of the film is a violently melodramatic love triangle, 
involving Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie) and her shifting intimacies with 
the bullish Hando and the more sensitive Davey (the remarkable Daniel 
Pollock). The influences of Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese are 
palpable, especially in set pieces like the siege on a bourgeois home in 
A Clockwork Orange (1971) style.
Romper Stomper does not pretend to offer a sophisticated 
commentary on the complexities of multicultural Australia. These "skins" 
are what gangsters or juvenile delinquents so often are in cinema—a 
flamboyant metaphor for a life lived at the edge of society. Both Wright 
and Crowe strive to give these events a Shakespearean grandeur, à la 
Richard III, and they largely succeed.  AM
Before writer-director Baz Luhrmann made the frenetic bauble Moulin 
Rouge (2001), he deftly captured the magic and power of old-fashioned 
Hollywood musicals with Strictly Ballroom. He did so by intertwining two 
classic themes: the rebel who eventually triumphs over adversity and 
naysayers, and the ugly duckling who blossoms into a swan—and gets 
the prince in the end.
When promising dancer Scott Hastings (a devastatingly sexy Paul 
Mercurio) defies the ballroom dancing community and its rules, his 
shrieking stage mother (Pat Thomson) nearly disowns him and resorts 
to all manner of trickery to rein him back in. Simultaneously, one of the 
mother's beginning dance students, the mousy Fran (Tara Morice, 
sweetly affecting) develops a crush on Scott, a man seemingly far out of 
her league in every way. Defying odds and doubters, the two become a 
couple, both on and off the dance floor. Fast-moving, romantic, funny, 
and full of wit, Strictly Ballroom is sterling escapist fare.
What makes the film work is that beneath the fast edits, swooning 
soundtrack, and gloriously garish costumes (and even more garish 
secondary characters) is an enormous heart. Its knowing evocation of 
what it means and costs to be both a dreamer and an outcast makes the 
couple's heart-stopping finale a lump-in-the-throat triumph.  EH

Baz Luhrmann (award of the youth—
foreign film)
Strictly Ballroom  Baz Luhrmann, 1992

At the start of The Player, two fast-talking Hollywood types amble out 
the front door of a studio office, trading one-liners about films that begin 
with spectacular "long takes." As the camera leaves these characters and 
picks up others, the joke becomes knowingly clear: This is the ultimate 
such take, a parody of modern cinema's jazzy, showy moments.
The Player was touted as Robert Altman's comeback—his recovery 
twelve years after the commercial disaster of Popeye (1980). This claim is 
far from correct—Altman never stopped working in film, theater, and TV. 
But The Player, displaying a breathtaking mastery and modernity, brought 
him back to mainstream attention. It is fabulously cynical entertainment.
The witty script (by Michael Tolkin, from his novel of the same name) 
resembles a more successful screen adaptation of Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire 
of the Vanities than Brian De Palma's official 1990 version. Griffin Mills, 
played with icy charm by Tim Robbins, is a slick studio executive. He 
evaluates pitches—brief verbal synopses of often absurdly high-concept 
film ideas (such as The Graduate II). Griffin is being made increasingly 
nervous by the power plays in his company, and especially by the death 
threats he is receiving from a disgruntled, ignored scriptwriter.
Here begins a thriller plot involving mysterious identity, accidental 
murder, deception, bluff, coincidence, physical danger, and sexual 
intrigue. Altman carries it all off faultlessly, yet his true interest lies 
elsewhere. As usual, Altman delights in the painting of a detailed mosaic, 
a world in miniature. The oddball minor characters, fleeting incidents, 
overheard conversations, strange digressions—these are what make 
The Player marvelous.
Altman effortlessly encapsulates modern Hollywood filmmaking, 
while providing a radical alternative to it. Against all those feel-good 
movies with strong heroes, clear conflicts, and clear-cut motivations, The 
Player offers a shifty hero, fuzzy situations, and ambiguous motives—
sliced and diced with the purest irony. By the end, you'll wonder how the 
cream of Hollywood's stars—from Jack Lemmon to Julia Roberts—ever 
agreed to be a part of this supreme exercise in subversive mischief.  AM

Self-confessed video geek Quentin Tarantino was just twenty-eight when 
he wrote the script for this groundbreaking—and much imitated—
movie. Its title apparently came from a patron of the video store where 
Tarantino used to work who referred to Au Revoir les Enfants (1987) as 
"that reservoir dog movie." 
Dripping with quotable dialogue and superb performances from the 
almost totally male cast, Reservoir Dogs tells the story of the bloody 
aftermath of a diamond heist gone wrong. In flashback, we see the 
criminals as they are brought together by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney)—
none of whom know each other's real identities (making it impossible 
for anyone to rat their accomplices out)—and are given new monikers: 
Mr. Brown (Tarantino), the jerky Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), young Mr. 
Orange (Tim Roth), world-weary Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), and violent 
Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen, in a creepily mesmerizing performance); 
and in a series of revealing scenes we learn about the events that have 
led to the film's blood-soaked climax in a warehouse.
But it isn't just the clever plotting that makes this film such a 1990s 
classic. Like the second film that Tarantino directed, Pulp Fiction (1994), 
the movie is cleverly cast (Madsen, Keitel, and Roth all giving career-best 
performances) and packed with memorable scenes that have become 
part of cinematic history, each containing pop culture references that 
are now recognized as a trademark of his scripts. Whether it's a scene 
in which the men—convening in a coffee shop before the heist—
discuss everything from the etiquette of tipping to the real meaning of 
Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (their conclusion being unprintable here), or 
the shocking "ear" tableau with Madsen (featuring the unforgettable use 
of Steeler's Wheel classic "Stuck in the Middle with You"), Tarantino choses 
his words and actions so cleverly that much is revealed about each 
character's personality no matter how trivial the words are that they 
speak. A superb debut from one of the most individual cinematic talents 
to come out of the 1990s.  JB

Glengarry Glen Ross  James Foley, 1992
805
With Glengarry Glen Ross, James Foley crafts the ultimate black comedy 
about selling. Adapted for the screen by David Mamet from his own 
1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Mamet's trademark repeating dialogue 
not only keeps the story at one remove from reality but keeps the viewer 
in a tension-filled holding pattern as well.
In a depressingly functional real-estate office on a rainy New York 
night, a team of desperate salesmen are given an ultimatum: Sell 
dubious property to "dead leads"—people who have no history of land 
investment—by morning or else be fired. Those who succeed will be 
given the "Glengarry leads," a list of genuine buyers. As for the actors—
Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino (nominated for a supporting actor Oscar here; 
he won it for his lead in Scent of a Woman the same year), Kevin Spacey, 
Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce, and Alex Baldwin—Glengarry Glen Ross 
doesn't have a cast, it has a pantheon. Baldwin in particular gives a 
supporting yet pivotal performance as the hardline company man, a role 
created expressly for the film. Director Foley makes Glengarry Glen Ross 
into more than an updated Death of a Salesman: It's the only film for 
which antacids should be taken before viewing.  KK
Conte d'hiver  Eric Rohmer, 1992
A Tale of Winter
The second film in Eric Rohmer's Contes des quatre saisons ("Tales of Four 
Seasons") series begins a little disconcertingly with a summer romance 
(featuring equally surprising explicit sex) between a young hairdresser 
(Charlotte Véry) and the handsome hero she meets while vacationing 
in Brittany (Frédéric van den Driessche). That brief prologue over, 
however, the rest of the film is a more familiarly cool Christmas-period 
conversation piece as, five years later, the heroine dithers between two 
stolid suitors, perversely still believing that the holiday lover—who 
unwittingly fathered her daughter and to whom she accidentally gave 
an incorrect home address with which to contact her—will reappear as 
if by magic out of the blue.
With its witty but wintry study of seemingly forlorn faith and lost love 
reminiscent of My Night at Maud's (1969), and the almost irritatingly 
indecisive and self-centered heroine recalling The Green Ray (1986), this 
is archetypal Rohmer territory, down to the beautifully judged nod 
to Shakespeare's play and, consequently, a miraculous but extremely 
satisfying ending. As ever, too, the naturalistic performances are entirely 
plausible, the use of place—Paris and Burgundy—evocative, and the 
characterizations (including an intellectual librarian and the girl's more 
pragmatic boss as her admirers) precisely representative of the choices 
she faces. Quietly brilliant, and finally very moving.  GA

Unforgiven  Clint Eastwood, 1992
Clint Eastwood's last Western is a grand one to have ridden out on. 
Dark, gripping, and embracing complex themes, Unforgiven is a saga 
of melancholy beauty and unflinching moral, physical, and historical 
realism. Eastwood received his belated due as a filmmaker with this, his 
sixteenth feature, winning Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. It's 
a radical revision of his younger, iconic, "supercool" man with no name 
and few words. Graying gunmen, oppressed women, and the painful 
ugliness of death provide the dark matter. Debunking Western heroics, 
and a dime novelist rewriting and glamorizing the bloody events he 
witnesses, adds sardonic humor to Unforgiven's mix.
Eastwood's weather-beaten William Munny is a retired killer, reformed 
by the love of a good woman who has died, leaving him struggling to 
raise two children on a failing farm. Unlike Eastwood's Josey Wales, 
Munny doesn't need to redeem his humanity but struggle to retain it 
when he teams with old sidekick Ned (Morgan Freeman) to claim a 
bounty offered by brothel women. Their task: to avenge a knifed whore 
in bleak Big Whiskey, where brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) is 
indifferent to the women's demands for justice. Meanwhile, Richard 
Harris's flamboyant killer English Bob arrives to take up the prostitutes' 
reward himself, traveling with his biographer, one of those Eastern 
journalists who transformed some of the scum of the earth into the 
libertarian outlaw heroes of penny dreadful novellas.
Unforgiven is most fascinating in its revisionist approach to the 
mythology of the Old West, of dashing desperados and daring deeds, 
juxtaposed with the realities as recalled by Munny and Ned concerning 
the discomfort of sleeping on the trail, the misery of riding through the 
rain, and the ugly actuality of shooting a man—preferably when he's 
down. In another sharp contrast, the settings are gorgeous (Alberta, 
Canada, spectacularly doubling for the Midwestern frontier). The film is 
punctuated with grim scenes of horror from the slashing of the young 
prostitute to the inevitable final showdown.
Both Hackman's and Freeman's performances stand out, but there is 
an interesting dichotomy in Eastwood's own. Munny's pious utterances 
and his professed loss of appetite for killing do not ring entirely true, and 
when he is at last aroused to rage the result is what Eastwood devotees 
have been awaiting. In the end, Munny becomes an amalgam of all the 
violent avenging riders Eastwood has portrayed over the years.
This is as fine a piece of craftsmanship as one would expect from 
Eastwood, who brings to the film all his understanding of a genre he 
single-handedly kept alive for twenty years when it was out of fashion. 
Hackman won an Oscar for his sadistic Little Bill, having turned down 
the script years before Eastwood bought it. Touchingly, in its final 
grace note the film is dedicated "to Sergio and Don"—Eastwood's late 
directorial mentors Leone and Siegel. He did them proud.  AE

Stanley Kwan's 1992 masterpiece is quite possibly the greatest Hong 
Kong film ever; perhaps only some of the works of Wong Kar-wai, 
such as Days of Being Wild (1991) and In the Mood for Love (2000) are 
comparable in depth and intensity. Yet it must be acknowledged that 
the shortening of the original 167-minute running time to 126 minutes 
has been harmful. Adding insult to injury, the Hong Kong producers 
destroyed the original negative; apparently the uncut version survives 
only on Australian television. The story of silent film star Ruan Ling-yu 
(1910-1935), known as the Garbo of Chinese cinema, The Actress 
combines documentary footage with period re-creation, biopic glamor 
with profound curiosity, and ravishing historical clips with color 
simulations of the same sequences being shot—all to explore a past that 
seems more complex, sexy, and mysterious than the present.
Maggie Cheung won a well-deserved best actress prize at Berlin 
for her classy performance in the title role, despite the fact that her 
difference from Ruan Ling-yu as an actress is probably more important 
than any similarities. She was known as a comic actress in relatively 
lightweight Hong Kong entertainment before this film, and The Actress 
proved to be a turning point in her career toward more dramatic and often 
meatier parts. But the gap between her own polished star image and that 
of Ruan as a more unbridled tragedienne is crucial, and much of Kwan's 
work as a director goes into creating a kind of nimbus around Cheung's 
poise and grace. Kwan also creates a labyrinth of questions around who 
Ruan was and why she committed suicide—a labyrinth both physical 
(with beautiful uses of black-and-white movie sets) and metaphysical.
Highlights include the stylish beauty of an imagined Shanghai film 
world of the 1930s and the flat abrasiveness of Kwan chatting with 
Cheung on video about what all this means and coming up with damn 
little. Any historical movie worth its salt historicizes the present along 
with the past, and this movie implicitly juxtaposes our own inadequacy 
with those potent clips of Ling-yu herself.  JRos

Man Bites Dog is probably the most controversial film in the history of 
Belgian cinema. It rose to instant fame after critics all over the world 
denounced its portrayal of on-screen violence, linking it to contemporary 
films such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 
(1990). Although Man Bites Dog shares some features with these other 
movies, it is also very different.
Shot in grainy black-and-white stock, employing handheld camera 
work and direct sound (there is no music), Man Bites Dog has the look of 
a cinema verité documentary. The story concerns a film crew who are 
following around a self-proclaimed serial killer named Ben (played by 
cowriter and codirector Benoît Poelvoorde). As Ben goes about his 
business, he slowly makes the crewmen accomplices to his crimes. He 
takes them out to a copious meal, they start helping him dispose of 
bodies, and he even helps them out financially.
Ben's running commentary—on his "craft," on his victims and their 
social peculiarities, and on the crew—invests Man Bites Dog with a 
surprisingly humorous tone. Here we are, enjoying a serial killer's work, 
because he is so funny, upbeat, and unpredictable. While murdering a 
man in his bathroom, Ben abruptly stops and asks the crew which French 
film this scene reminds them of. 
Then the laughter stops. The turning point is a gruesomely explicit 
rape scene. Here the film stops being a black comedy, becoming instead 
a bleak criticism of our desire to watch everyday life tilt out of balance. 
The impact of the scene is so shocking that it forces us to rethink our 
earlier pleasures, and changes the status of the narrative.
According to the creators of Man Bites Dog, the idea for the film 
stemmed from a Belgian tabloid journalism TV series, one which blew 
small stories out of proportion and intruded on people's private lives. 
This underlying concept helped guarantee the film's success, and secured 
its status as an all-time cult favorite.  EM

The Crying Game  Neil Jordan, 1992
809
The Crying Game's big, infamous twist is actually far less interesting than 
the more radical depiction that it offers: Forest Whitaker's character, 
Jody, whose queerness is so removed from most people's preconceptions 
that few critics or viewers ever even seem to notice the slyly drawn 
man's tiered sexuality. Writer-director Neil Jordan crafts an often droll, 
frequently melodramatic essay on the unfathomable laws of desire 
in this layered tale of a mysterious "woman" (the aloof and beautiful 
Jaye Davidson, reviving the tragic mulatto), her lover who is murdered 
under bizarre circumstances (Whitaker), and a man involved with the 
murder (Stephen Rea). It's all wrapped in a bow of political intrigue that's 
centered on longstanding tensions between the British army and the 
Irish Republican Army.
As the love triangle between the deceased man, his faux widow, 
and his assassin deepens, all sorts of secrets come tumbling out; the 
movie abandons what the story first appeared to be about for a new 
tale altogether, this one about sexual intrigue. A landmark film for the 
convergence of marketing chutzpah and layered sexual subversiveness 
that made it a hit, The Crying Game proved that there was an audience 
for audacious, nervy independent cinema. With its varying takes on 
race, sexuality, and gender, it kicked open the doors for discussions on 
the complexities of attraction and erotic longing. Its extraordinary box-
office success, for better or worse, helped transform independent film 
from a cult item to a highly profitable market share.  EH

The Blue Kite
Banned in China, the powerful eighth feature of Tian Zhuangzhuang 
(The Horse Thief [1986] and Li Lianying, The Imperial Eunuch [1991]) 
follows its fictional hero, Tietou, and his family in Beijing from 1953 to 
1968, through the Cultural Revolution and its ensuing repercussions 
and purges. Tietou's father is a librarian, and in one unforgettable and 
disquieting postrevolution scene, the hero's father, attending a meeting 
for library staff, briefly leaves the room to go to the toilet. Upon his 
return he finds that he's been branded a reactionary, leading to his 
banishment to a collective farm for "reeducation" and a radical change 
in his entire family's fortunes.
The Blue Kite offers a sublime and often subtle look at how history 
and politics disrupt ordinary lives, with a memorable use of its central 
courtyard location and a keen feeling for everyday life within that space. 
One comes away from this film with a profound sense of how individuals 
strive to maintain a sense of ethics within a changing society that 
periodically confounds those ethics or makes them irrelevant.  JRos

Philadelphia  Jonathan Demme, 1993
Although AIDS had been tackled on TV, most notably in the acclaimed 
1985 drama An Early Frost, and in independent cinema (the 1990 film 
Longtime Companion), Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia was the first 
mainstream Hollywood movie about the disease. Tom Hanks, in a role 
that won him his first Best Actor Oscar, stars as Andrew Beckett, 
a homosexual Philadelphian lawyer who is fired by his firm after 
they discover he has AIDS. They claim they dismissed him for 
incompetence at work, so he hires a hotshot lawyer to defend him in a 
suit against them. Of course, the lawyer he hires, Joe Miller (Denzel 
Washington), is homophobic and harbors misconceptions about the 
disease, but in the course of their fight he learns from Andrew and 
comes to respect him.
Demme fills his heartfelt drama with accomplished actors, from 
Hanks (who pulls off an opera-appreciation scene that lesser actors 
would have fumbled) and Washington to Jason Robards, as the firm's 
bigoted boss, and Antonio Banderas as Andrew's companion. Some 
may argue that Demme sanitizes the ravages AIDS inflicts on a person 
in the film, but Hanks's sympathetic, passionate performance more 
than makes up for any attempts at softening the subject matter for a 
mainstream audience.  JB

Hsimeng jensheng  Hou Hsiao-hsien, 1993
The Puppetmaster
Part of a loosely connected trilogy on the history of Taiwan that 
includes City of Sadness (1989) and Good Men, Good Women (1995), 
The Puppetmaster is set during the Japanese occupation, which lasted 
from 1895 to 1945. Based on fact, it recounts the life story of Li Tianlu, 
recollected in old age, with Li himself appearing occasionally as an 
on-screen narrator. Li is apprenticed to a puppeteer, and as he 
develops his skills we witness the events of his life. The film weaves 
together the personal and the political, as Li gets married and acquires 
a mistress, as well as negotiating other family complications. At times 
the Japanese are presented as oppressors—in one scene they arrive 
to demand that the men in his grandfather's family cut their pigtails. 
But Li manages an accommodation with them, even working as a 
puppeteer for the Japanese propaganda service. At the end of the 
war the Japanese commander invites him to lunch and tells him how 
much he will miss him.
Director Hou Hsiao-hsien has an unhurried style, with long shots 
that calmly observe the interaction of the characters. If the narrative 
method, with its frequent ellipses, requires attention, audiences will be 
well rewarded by a deeply felt portrait of Taiwanese life.  EB

Short Cuts  Robert Altman, 1993
One of the shortest-seeming long movies of the 1990s, this is Robert 
Altman's braiding-together of a fistful of Raymond Carver stories. Short 
Cuts follows various plot and character threads through a Los Angeles 
blighted by insects and earthquake, where everyone is on the point of 
cracking up and random tragedy is always impending.
Altman assembles a once-in-a-lifetime cast, but also manages to 
give them all things worth doing: Jack Lemmon as an estranged father, 
Julianne Moore naked from the waist down, Anne Archer as a party 
clown, Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell shocked by grief, Jennifer 
Jason Leigh as a phone-sex operator, Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Penn 
as casually awful men, Tim Robbins as a callous cop, Peter Gallagher 
wrecking his wife's home, Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits drinking. On 
repeated viewings, the overlaps become more fun to spot and individual 
performances take the spotlight. In the end, the film is especially notable 
for its mosaic portrait of Altman's sparkly, haunted, corrupt Los Angeles 
(a very different place from Carver's drier Midwest).
An interesting counterpart to Altman's insider's vision of The Player 
(1992), Short Cuts gets away from the arena of the movie business 
(which is only a brief presence here) into the strange little lives of other 
involved Angelenos.  KN

Working from a well-constructed script by Steven Zaillian (Searching for 
Bobby Fischer [1993]), adapting Thomas Keneally's nonfiction novel—a 
fascinating account of the Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler, who 
saved the lives of over 1,100 Polish Jews—Spielberg does an 
uncommonly good job both of holding our interest over the course of 
185 minutes and of showing more of the nuts and bolts of the 
Holocaust than we usually get from fiction films. One enormous plus is 
the rich and beautiful black-and-white cinematography by one-time 
Chicagoan Janusz Kaminski—who opted for monocrome because he 
wanted the movie to possess a timeless quality. Spielberg was adamant 
that his film should not be seen simply a period piece and should carry 
contemporary relevance. As he noted after completing the shoot, 
"I made it this year because I was so upset about what was happening 
in Bosnia, as well as about the attempted genocide of the whole 
Kurdish population." For similar reasons, much of the picture was shot 
using handheld cameras, in order to project an documentary-like, 
"cinema verité" atmosphere.
Spielberg's capacity to milk the maximal intensity out of the 
existential terror and pathos conveyed in Keneally's book—Polish Jews 
could be killed at any moment by the capriciousness of a labor camp 
director (Ralph Fiennes)—is complemented and even counterpointed 
by his capacity to milk the glamor of Nazi high life and absolute 
power. (In a telling phrase, the director later commented on the 
"sexual evil" conveyed by Fiennes's performance.) Significantly, each 
emotional register is generally accompanied by a different style of 
cinematography, and much as Liam Neeson's effective embodiment of 
Schindler works as our conduit to the Nazis, Ben Kingsley's subtle 
performance as Itzhak Stern—his Jewish accountant, right-hand man, 
and mainly silent conscience—provides our conduit to the Polish Jews. 
In 2011, Kingsley recalled that Spielberg told him at the time that he 
was "the witness of the film."
What are unfortunately missing, and therefore distorted, are many 
of the more fascinating elements in the real-life story that don't match 
Spielberg's pious, patriarchal scenario—such as the major role that 
Schindler's wife, Emilie, played in saving Jewish lives after he resumed 
living with her while he was establishing a mock munitions plant in 
Moravia, or the fact that he continued to betray her with other women. 
One also wonders how Spielberg might have coped with the subject of 
the bribes that were necessary for many of the Polish Jews to find their 
way onto Schindler's list—actually compiled mostly by Marcel 
Goldberg (played here by Mark Ivanir)—and thus survive. If he had 
dealt with this sort of material, though, the film would have probably 
lost some of its moral directness even while gaining in moral 
complexity.  JRos

Farewell My Concubine
First of the "Fifth Generation" of Chinese filmmakers to emerge onto the 
world scene from the Beijing Film Academy since it reopened its doors 
in 1978, Kaige Chen bravely invoked his own bitter memories of the 
Cultural Revolution with Farewell My Concubine. The film is an exquisite, 
fascinating drama of the fifty-year relationship between two male 
Beijing Opera singers that spans China's turbulent twentieth century 
through convulsive collective and personal betrayals.
Farewell My Concubine, China's first Golden Palm winner at Cannes (to 
the dismay of officials provoked by elements of homosexuality and recent 
history), is an impassioned, sumptuous epic and a stunning achievement, 
particularly because it was made in a troubled, censorious environment. 
Hong Kong pop star Leslie Cheung plays the abandoned boy sexually 
abused and groomed to become a star in female roles—most significantly 
as a tragic royal concubine in a popular classic. Fengyi Zhang is his lifelong 
intimate, the less artistic and less idealistic costar whose marriage to 
conniving prostitute Li Gong is a catalyst for jealousy, denunciation, and 
haunted self-preservation during upheavals in the company and society. 
Rare indeed is a film on this scale that balances exotic culture and 
thrilling spectacle (the opera, civil war, and revolutionary mobs) with 
intimate and universally powerful human experience.  AE

Blue, the first film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Three Colors" trilogy, may be 
inspired by the meaning of the first color in the French flag (liberty), but 
the irascible director would never be so literal. Instead he keeps the 
movie mysterious and oblique, with both beautiful and haunting results. 
Juliette Binoche plays a widow who reacts to the death of her composer 
husband and daughter by withdrawing from the world. Yet memories of 
her past, as well as the secrets her husband left behind, interrupt her 
selfish emotional isolation, leading her to complete unfinished business.
Along with a top-tier score and evocative cinematography, Blue 
benefits most from Kieslowski's sharp eye and unerring feel for the 
fleeting emotions, enigmatic actions, and minute details that comprise 
human nature. Thanks to his perceptive script and careful control of the 
story, Kieslowski creates a film whose richness and honesty offer a 
glimpse into the enigmatic workings of the soul. He fills every frame 
of Blue with meaning, enhanced and accented in no small part by 
Binoche's brave and powerful performance, which hinges on subtle 
tics and other physical nuances in its depiction of a broken spirit slowly 
pulling herself back together.  JKl

Three Colors: Blue

Comic actor Bill Murray gives what may be the best and warmest 
performance of his career in this genius comedy—arguably the best of 
the 1990s—from writers Harold Ramis (who also directs) and Danny 
Rubin. Murray plays Phil Connors, a grumpy weatherman who is 
dispatched with producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry 
(Chris Elliott) to the friendly little town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, 
to witness the annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A groundhog named 
Punxsutawney Phil emerges and, depending on whether or not he sees 
his shadow, predicts if the town will experience a few more weeks of 
winter. Disparaging and self-centered, Phil doesn't want to be there at 
all, so when he wakes up the next morning to discover he is reliving 
Groundhog Day all over again, he isn't exactly thrilled. Especially when 
he relives it again the next day, and the next, and seems to be the only 
person who is experiencing, and remembering, the same events over 
and over (and over) again.
It's a terrific conceit (one that is never explained, which makes it even 
better) that first causes the scheming Phil to take advantage of the 
situation. He asks a woman one day what she looks for in a man, and the 
following day embodies all those attributes to the unwitting lady. It 
then drives him to attempt suicide in various ways (until he discovers 
that he will inevitably wake up alive again the next/same morning). 
Eventually he is led to improve his behavior as well as his people skills in 
an effort to redeem himself in the eyes of Rita, who sees him only as the 
grouch he has always been. 
In between, there are delicious running gags including waking up to 
the same banter and Sonny and Cher song ("I've Got You Babe") on the 
radio; seeing Stephen Tobolowsky in a superb turn as irritating insurance 
salesman Ned Ryerson, and knowing what is going to happen before it 
does. Groundhog Day is both wonderfully clever and hysterically funny—
comedy is rarely this perfect.  JB

The Piano  Jane Campion, 1993
Sweetie (1989) and An Angel at My Table (1990) taught us to expect 
startling as well as beautiful things from Jane Campion, and this assured 
and provocative third feature offers yet another lush parable about the 
perils and paradoxes of female self-expression.
Set during the nineteenth century, this original story by Campion—
which evokes at times some of the romantic intensity of Emily Brontë—
focuses on a Scottish widow (Holly Hunter) who hasn't spoken since 
her childhood, presumably by choice, and whose main form of self-
expression is her piano playing. She arrives with her nine-year-old 
daughter (Anna Paquin) in the New Zealand wilds to enter into an 
arranged marriage, which gets off to an unhappy start when her 
husband-to-be (Sam Neill) refuses to transport her piano. A local white 
man living with the Maori natives (Harvey Keitel) buys the piano from 
him and, fascinated by and attracted to the mute woman, agrees to "sell" 
it back to her a key at a time in exchange for lessons—lessons that have 
ultimately traumatic consequences.
Setting out to be politically correct, erotic, and romantic at the same 
time, The Piano inevitably bites off more than it can possibly chew, but 
winds up stimulating passionate feelings nonetheless.  JRos

Glenn Gould was the brilliant, eccentric Canadian pianist who retired 
from the concert stage young and spent the rest of his driven, reclusive 
but remarkable life making acclaimed recordings, experimental radio 
programs, a fortune on the commodities market, and legendarily bizarre 
telephone calls until his death at age fifty in 1982. An entirely appropriate 
acknowledgment of his other-worldly genius was the inclusion of Gould's 
performance of a Bach prelude in the Voyager spacecraft's message to 
the stars from planet Earth.
Young French-Canadian writer-director François Girard adroitly 
juggles dramatic fiction, documentary realism, humor, and even 
animation with insight into the artist's agony and ecstasy in a beguiling, 
dazzlingly adventurous series of vignettes—the playful structure of 
thirty-two short films a witty mimicking of Bach's "Goldberg Variations"—
for a unique, funny, tender, and exhilarating biopic. "Diary of One Day," 
for example, is an X-ray film of a pianist's skeleton, musculature, and 
nerve endings at work; "Truck Stop" observes Gould mentally 
orchestrating conversations around him in a café into a pleasing 
rhythmic arrangement. Colm Feore gives a wonderful, commanding 
performance of this rare individual, suggesting all the complexities of a 
gifted, multifaceted, and idiosyncratic character. And the soundtrack, 
compiled from Gould's own repertoire, is glorious.  AE

The Wedding Banquet
A young Taiwanese businessman living in New York and sharing an 
apartment with his physical therapist boyfriend decides to marry a 
Chinese artist who needs a green card. The next thing he knows, his 
parents from Taiwan, not knowing he's gay, have decided to come to 
the wedding, leading to a good many predictable if enjoyable comic 
complications. Director Ang Lee collaborated on the script for The 
Wedding Banquet with Neil Feng and producer James Schamus—the 
latter of whom has continued to work with the director ever since as 
both producer and cowriter.
This 1993 feature, Lee's second, is a clever and entertaining social 
comedy that helped to establish him as a commercial director long 
before such more obvious mainstream crowd-pleasers as The Ice Storm 
(1997) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). Satire about—yet 
also clearly for—the middle class, The Wedding Banquet has a lot more 
heart than edge, and is pitched mainly at liberal straight people, 
though the Chinese cultural details should be fascinating to all non-
Chinese viewers.  JRos

Jurassic Park  Steven Spielberg, 1993
The same year that saw his "grown-up" war drama Schindler's List win 
vast critical acclaim, Steven Spielberg also delivered the kind of movie 
we had come to expect from the director of Raiders of the Lost Ark 
(1981)—a rip-roaring adventure of dinosaurs and disaster based on 
Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, Jurassic Park.
Slightly bonkers millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) 
has created the ultimate theme park on a remote island, and he 
wants to offer a sneak preview to a few carefully selected people: 
paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), 
mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's own 
grandchildren Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards). What 
they find is a luscious isle populated by real-life dinosaurs recreated 
using DNA found in pieces of long-buried amber. A perfect sanctuary, 
in theory, but because the dinosaur breeds they have "made" include 
the infamous T. rex and some nasty, toothy creatures named 
velociraptors—and because one of the park's employee is secretly 
working for one of Hammond's rivals, and is set on stealing dinosaur 
embryos—it's obvious that the whole scheme is going to end in tears. 
And screaming and dying.
Part monster movie and part disaster movie as the island is thrashed 
by a storm and the assembled characters find there is nowhere to hide 
from giant rampaging (and, one assumes, hungry) prehistoric creatures, 
Jurassic Park is packed with so many thrills and jaw-dropping dino 
effects—utilizing both CGI and animatronics—it isn't hard to see why 
the movie went on to gross over $900 million worldwide. Indeed, it 
succeeded in becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time, before 
being overtaken by Titanic (1997). Spielberg cleverly builds up to the 
revelation of the "monsters" by stunning us with the visual treat of 
cuddly, friendly, vegetarian dinosaurs first—and by rationing 
appearances of any prehistoric beasts for most of the first half of the 
film, much as he did with the fearsome shark in Jaws (1975). So when 
we do finally meet the ass-kicking T. rex, it results in one of the movie's 
fabulous set pieces. The imperiled adults and children are stranded in 
the broken-down "ride" (jeeps on a track taking them through the 
park) as the storm hits, the electric fences malfunction, and the 
scariest dinosaur of them all gets loose.
There are many other impressive moments in Crichton and 
Spielberg's fable of science gone out of control, ranging from the 
raptors in the kitchen to the T. rex/raptor showdown. The actors, while 
realizing the true stars of the film are computer generated, have fun 
with their performances (especially Goldblum as the "I-told-you-so" 
chaos theorist) and make the most of the smart, witty dialogue. But 
ultimately this is Spielberg's show, and what an impressive, edge-of-
the-seat show it is.  JB

In 1991, Disney released the magical Beauty and the Beast—the first 
animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award—
and brought its animation right up to date with a beautiful mix of 
traditional and computer-generated cartooning. The Lion King followed 
three years later and not only improved on the standards set by Beauty 
but also instantly became a Disney classic.
Young Simba the lion cub (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a cub 
and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion) is exiled by his evil uncle Scar—a 
creepily effective performance from Jeremy Irons—following his father 
Mufasa's (James Earl Jones) death. Forced to fend for himself, he befriends 
two odd characters, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane), 
and also falls for a lioness named Nala (voiced by Niketa Calane and later 
by Moira Kelly) before returning to regain his place as head of the pride.
This animated adventure works so well because it has all the elements 
of a terrific movie and plenty of action and adventure. The lion cub 
scenes appeal to small children and the impressive animation causes 
even adult jaws to drop. The film has a classic story arc as the carefree 
cub becomes a wise and respected lion. Backed by a catchy score by 
Elton John, The Lion King is surprisingly moving, considering that we are 
only relating to cartoon characters, and the ending is capable of turning 
even grown men into blubbering piles of mush.  JB

Les roseaux sauvages  André Téchiné, 1994
The Wild Reeds
The Wild Reeds is a wonderful and masterful feature from Andre Téchiné 
(his twelfth) and one of the best movies from an excellent French 
television series of fiction features on teenagers from the 1960s to the 
early 1980s. As Téchiné's French Provincial (1974) evokes in some ways 
the Bernardo Bertolucci of The Conformist (1970), this account of kids 
living in southwest France in 1962 toward the end of the Algerian war 
has some of the feeling, lyricism, and sweetness of Bertolucci's Before the 
Revolution (1964). Wild Reeds, however, is clearly the work of someone 
much older and wiser.
The main characters are all completing their baccalaureate 
examination at a boarding school. They include a boy struggling with 
his homosexual desire for a close friend (Gael Morel), an older student 
who is a right-wing opponent of Algerian nationalism (Frédéric Gorny), 
and a communist daughter of one of the teachers (Élodie Bouchez), who 
befriends the homosexual and falls for the older student in spite of their 
political differences. One comes to regard these characters and others 
as old friends, and Téchiné's handling of pastoral settings is as exquisite 
as his feeling for period. Wild Reeds was the winner of César awards (the 
French equivalent of the Oscars) for best picture, director, screenplay, 
and "new female discovery" (for Bouchez).  JRos

Made for U.S. cable TV company HBO (which broadcast it before giving 
the film a theatrical release, thus sadly making it ineligible for the 
Academy Awards), The Last Seduction was director John Dahl's third, and 
best, venture into the film noir genre.
Linda Fiorentino positively sizzles across the screen as femme fatale 
Bridget, whom we first meet when she cons her husband (Bill Pullman) 
into making a large drug deal, only to run off with the money and leave 
him behind. She then slithers into a small town and into the life of 
sweet, infatuated Mike (Peter Berg), who has no clue just what he has 
let himself in for.
Simmering with steamy sexuality, Dahl's thriller is deliciously bitter 
and twisted as Fiorentino twirls unsuspecting men around her little 
finger then casts them aside just as quickly. Pullman—best known for 
kinder roles—is a revelation as Fiorentino's almost-as-nasty-as-she-is 
spouse, while Berg hits exactly the right note as the poor guy who 
never quite realizes how deep he is being dragged in. But the true star 
of the film is Fiorentino, who chews up and spits out Steve Barancik's 
delicious dialogue, reducing men to quivering, whimpering victims in 
the process.  JB

Anyone familiar with the work of underground comic artist R. Crumb 
might assume that he has a few screws loose, and indeed they might be 
right. But the most remarkable discovery made by Terry Zwigoff's sad, 
fascinating documentary is that R. Crumb is actually the least strange and 
best adjusted of three siblings, all of whom reveal an offhand brilliance 
and creativity yet channel that brilliance into radically contrasting outlets 
and lifestyles. One spends much of his time meditating on the streets of 
San Francisco. The other is a recluse, holed up at home with his mother 
as he battles clinical depression and madness. Both exhibit an artistic 
inclination and talent at least equal to R. Crumb's, and the film spends 
much of its time revealing how a relatively inconsequential shared 
childhood steered each sibling in different directions.
Crumb, of course, spends most of its duration tracking the rise of 
R.  Crumb as an underground comic icon during the heyday of the 
American Haight-Ashbury hippie culture in the late 1960s. Through a 
series of revealing and shockingly honest interviews, Zwigoff shows 
Crumb to be contrary at heart. He is a rebel against seemingly arbitrary 
(and often infuriatingly politically correct) rules of art and behavior with 
a taste for vintage jazz, fashions, and affectations that existed before 
American culture was gripped tighter by its corporate overseers. Crumb 
is the quintessential rebel whose form of passive resistance—comics—
ironically transformed him into an underground icon.
Crumb marked an auspicious debut for Zwigoff, a longtime fan of 
vintage jazz and underground comics who eventually parlayed his 
success as a documentary filmmaker into a feature film, directing Ghost 
World (which happened to be based on an underground comic by 
Daniel Clowes, another vintage jazz obsessive). Needless to say, Crumb 
has as much to say about the lifestyle and attitude of eccentrics like 
Zwigoff in general as it does about R. Crumb. Specifically, his portrayal 
of the jaded Crumb in the months before his retirement remains an 
invaluable document (and in some ways outcome) of the underground 
1960s comics scene.  JKl

More often than not, filmmakers wilt into reverence or undue solemnity 
when they take on fact-based movies rooted in tragedy. Not Peter 
Jackson, who, though now famous for his Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001, 
2002, 2003), was already hedging the lines between good and evil, 
innocence and sin, comedy and drama in his early film Heavenly 
Creatures: a gleefully free interpretation of a 1952 murder case in which 
two schoolgirls in New Zealand, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, 
conspired to kill Pauline's mother (prophetically named Mrs. Rieper) in 
hopes of avoiding being separated from one another.
At once prankish and moving, the film tells the girls' story as a 
parable of teenage puppy love gone awry between two bookish misfits. 
Juliet (Kate Winslet, in the role that launched her career), a smart-
mouthed poor little rich girl from England who's cursed with callously 
neglectful parents, bonds with the shy, dowdy but intelligent Pauline 
(Melanie Lynskey). The more the girls' parents, disturbed by the 
homoerotic intensity of their friendship, try to pry them apart, the more 
they retreat into a florid dream universe, driven by their journals and 
populated by avenging princes and princesses. Each girl jacks up the 
other's obsessive imagination until they have abolished the line 
between reality and desire—as does Jackson in gorgeous fantasy 
sequences filled with digitally manipulated clay figures and featuring, 
hilariously, the girls' idols, Mario Lanza and Orson Welles.  ET

a chronologically scrambled collection of interrelated and interlocking 
crime stories. Apart from its ingenious structure, Pulp Fiction extracts 
nearly all its kicks from allusions to and echoes of other movies and TV 
shows. Despite all its thematic nudges about redemption and second 
chances, its true agenda is only the flip side of Forrest Gump (1994): to 
make the escapist, media-savvy viewer the real hero of the story. 
Taken on its own crass terms, Tarantino's mock-tough narrative—
which derives most of its titillation from farcical mayhem, drugs, deadpan 
macho monologues, evocations of anal penetration, and terms of racial 
abuse—resembles a wet dream for fourteen-year-old male closet 
queens (or, perhaps more accurately, the fourteen-year-old male closet 
queen in each of us), and his command of this smart-alecky mode is so 
sure and confident that this nervy movie sparkles throughout with 
canny twists and turns.
John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Harvey Keitel all 
vibrate with high-voltage star power, while the rest of the film's cast 
(including Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeiros, Tim Roth, 
Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, 
Steve Buscemi, and Tarantino himself) amply fill out the remaining 
scenery. Only occasionally—as in an overloaded and ugly basement 
episode and some anemic love scenes—does Tarantino seem to be 
straining, though even here his overall project is evident: to evict real life 
and real people from the art film once and for all and replace them with 
generic teases and assorted homages, infused with hype and attitude, 
building a veritable monument to the viewer's assumed cinema 
connoisseurship. The references range from Douglas Sirk to Howard 
Hawks to Saturday Night Fever (1977) to kung fu by way of Godard, but 
one shouldn't expect any of the life experiences of the old movie sources 
to leak through; punchy, flamboyant surface is all.  JRos

Trois couleurs: Rouge  Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994
Three Colors: Red
The third color of the French flag stands for fraternity, and although the 
last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Three Colors" trilogy again remains only 
loosely connected to that theme, he gets to the heart of brotherhood via 
the sometimes tenuous and often-impossible-to-comprehend ties that 
connect all of humanity. If each of the "Three Colors" films ends up much 
more than the sum of their ambiguous parts, then Red provides the grand 
and illuminating summation of all three entries. Like the last chapter of a 
great philosophical novel, Red parcels out its details patiently and elliptically, 
drawing power from the mysterious plot machinations that connect a 
good-natured model (the ineffable Irène Jacob) with a cynical  retired judge 
(Jean-Louis Trintignant). Both lead empty lives yet express their loneliness 
in completely different ways, but the judge sees something intriguing 
in the model that draws him out of his shell of self-hatred.
Like many of Kieslowski's works, Red runs deep with chance and 
coincidence, and although the metaphysical director rarely addresses 
spirituality in his work per se, his final film (Kieslowski retired after 
directing Red and died shortly later) often seems a meditation on not 
just earthly bonds but also our place in the universe. In lesser hands such 
subject matter would no doubt have gotten bogged down in New Age 
musings, but Kieslowski is smarter than that. His characters develop and 
interact organically, as if tapping into a script made entirely of emotional 
cues rather than mere words. His camera captures places and moments 
that appear insignificant yet whose importance is inevitably born out. 
In Red he even manages to almost magically make manifest the very 
fabric of our existence, as the metaphors and symbolic touches of all 
three films—Blue (1993), White (1994), and Red—blur together during 
the challenging and undeniably moving conclusion, which casts the 
entire trilogy in a new light. Rarely has a film so brilliantly fused together 
so many ideas, images, and emotions into one masterful whole, a life 
primer and work of art posing as a mere movie.  JKl

Muriel's Wedding  P.J. Hogan, 1994
What seemed at first like a small, silly, romantic Australian comedy about 
a fat girl who desperately wants to get married, Muriel's Wedding became 
something of a cult classic. It also made more ripples within the rom-
com community than arguably any other film of its generation. The 
moment Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette appear on screen together, 
moviegoers know this is not going to be your average gooey-sweet 
romantic adventure. (Both have since gone on to receive Oscar 
nominations.) Collette does not play the overweight Muriel Hislop, an 
awkward soul from Porpoise Spit, Australia, as much as she inhabits her. 
She's a girl who will do anything to have a white wedding, never mind 
the romance or the happily ever after. 
Bumping into old friend Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths), Muriel begins her 
transformation, renaming herself and trying to find her romantic feet. 
But it is not all happy endings, as her potential husband—a swinish 
South African Olympic swimmer—is only after an Australian passport. 
Writer-director P.J. Hogan's placement of unexpectedly bitter strands 
within what is essentially a girl's fantasy world make this comedy unique 
and lasting: Few films have managed to balance the sense of girlish joy 
with a sense of foreboding and doom. Even years after its release, it is 
easy to see why Griffiths and Collette made such a breakthrough duo, 
Abba tunes (of which this film is crammed) or not. Hogan went on to 
make the Julia Roberts hit My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), which 
benefitted from the director's love of the romantic underbelly.  KK

Natural Born Killers  Oliver Stone, 1994
Never one to avoid controversy with films like Platoon (1990) and JFK 
(1991), Oliver Stone caused his biggest storm yet with this superb, 
satirical comment on the relationship between the media and violence. 
Using diverse film techniques and styles—animation, video, back and 
front projection, black-and-white and color film—Natural Born Killers 
tells the story of Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) 
Knox on a cross-country murder spree. The lurid tale soon comes to the 
attention of the media, and is related to an eager public by sleazy TV 
host Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.).
The movie is graphically violent as the white-trash lovers slaughter 
their way across the United States, but Stone should be commended 
for this provocative tale rather than condemned for it. Many acclaimed 
actors believed in his clever, stylized, and striking movie enough to 
appear in it, from Tommy Lee Jones (as a particularly smarmy prison 
governor) to Tom Sizemore (as the dogged cop on Mickey and Mallory's 
trail), and lead actors Harrelson, Lewis, and Downey, Jr. all deliver searing 
performances that are among the best of their respective careers.  JB

One of the first films to celebrate the "fabulous" nature of the drag 
queen, Priscilla shocked the cinema-going world by featuring venerable 
British actor Terence Stamp as Bernadette, an out-and-out boa-wearing 
transsexual. Teamed with newcomer Hugo Weaving (who since went onto 
fame, most notably in The Matrix Trilogy [1999, 2003]) as Teke and Guy 
Pearce (Memento [2000]), Australian director Stephan Elliot shows us a 
perfected, candy-colored world of the drag queen, stained somewhat by 
their ever-lurking fears of growing old and ugly. This is basically (and 
literally) a dressed-up road movie: Two gay men from Sydney are given 
the opportunity to put on a transvestite show in the desert. Bernadette 
is mourning the death of her young lover and so joins the duo as a 
distraction. The trio buy a bus and make a scene wherever it stops.
Homophobia, rampant in the outback, makes the journey full of 
danger—especially when Pearce's character Adam insists on walking the 
streets in full drag. What is endearing is the character portrayal of each 
of the drag artists. They are not merely the screaming, painted queens 
of To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), who are 
caring, sharing, and catty. Each of the three has a different aspiration—
one to climb Ayers Rock, another to finally meet his son, and Bernadette, 
whose elegant front drops and we see that she is longing to have a new 
love in her life. Even if you are not fascinated by drag queens (who can 
be a rich confection at the best of times), the visuals in Priscilla (which 
is, by the way, the name of the bus) are heavily cinematic.
The Oscar-winning costume design, complete with makeup and wigs 
as used by the trio in their drag act and on the street, is superb. Most 
memorable, however, is the shot of Pearce atop the bus as it drives 
through the desert, the wind trailing an enormous silver scarf behind 
him. For added oomph, he's lip-synching opera. Joyous and poignant, 
Priscilla gives us a rare glimpse behind the drag queen guise to see the 
real people within.  KK

1994
Hoop Dreams follows the true story of a pair of inner-city Chicago teens, 
Arthur Agee and William Gates, and their pursuit of NBA fame. Straight 
out of junior high school the two boys are recruited by an athletic scout, 
literally pulled off the streets and placed in a predominately white 
college preparatory school, St. Joseph High. Following in the footsteps 
of their basketball idol and St. Joseph's alumnus Isiah Thomas, both 
boys are inundated with the intense demands of maturation, academia, 
and, of course, athletics.
Within the first year documented by the film, only one of the boys 
survives the rigors of the prep school. In an attempt to continue 
following his basketball dreams, the other returns to the city and attends 
a public high school. Although separated by different basketball 
programs, we continue to watch the boys mature and grow into athletic 
powerhouses over a five-year period. Such a concentrated time span 
allows a personal look into these two boys' lives, showing that their 
pursuit of basketball glory is not just their passion, but their respective 
families' dream.
Keeping in step with their failures and successes, director and 
narrator Steve James unravels a unique story of inner-city struggles. As 
the film's layers become more apparent, intricate subplots make us 
intimately familiar with the other players in their lives. The constant 
ebb and flow of life plays on the boys' emotions and fate. Basketball 
functions not only as a game for Arthur and William, but as a way for 
their instructors and family members to play out their own dreams and 
desires. The film thus allow us to peer into the world of competitive high 
school basketball through the eyes of young men, torn families, and 
passionate coaches.
Hoop Dreams represents five years of painstaking dedication by both 
of the featured boys, as well as by the filmmakers. Following both Arthur 
and William from their boyish scrawny days of junior high to their highs 
and lows as prized high school basketball players, this film questions and 
contemplates inner-city life, family, sacrifices, success, and failure.  AK

How can one do justice to this grungy seven-hour black comedy, which 
in many ways is among the most impressive films of the 1990s? Adapted 
by Hungarian director Béla Tarr and László Krasznahorkai from the 
latter's 1985 novel, Sátántangó is a diabolical piece of sarcasm about the 
dreams, machinations, and betrayals of a failed farm collective, set 
during two consecutive rainy fall days (rendered more than once from 
the perspectives of different characters) and later the same month. The 
form of the novel was inspired by the steps of the tango—six forward, 
six backward—an idea reflected by the film's overlapping time structure, 
its twelve sections, and its remarkably choreographed long takes and 
camera movements, which often suggest a despiritualized Andrei 
Tarkovsky with the hothouse intensity of a John Cassavetes. Each section 
ends powerfully with offscreen third-person narration—eloquent, 
poetic commentary on the characters and their world that comes 
directly from the novel.
The story may seem to comment indirectly on the collapse of 
communism, but it has just as much to say about the subsequent 
degradations of capitalism; as Tarr has pointed out, the police—and 
human nature—are the same everywhere. The subject of this brilliantly 
constructed narrative is nothing less than the world today, and its 
431-minute running time is necessary not so much because Tarr has so 
much to say, but because he wants to say it right.  JRos

Clerks  Kevin Smith, 1994
Writer-director Kevin Smith stepped forward in 1994 as the most 
promising Generation-X newcomer with this impressive debut film. 
Set in a New Jersey convenience store, Smith's Clerks is a day-in-the-life 
tale of two shopworkers, Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and his reckless 
friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) who works at the video store next door. 
As various oddballs come into the store, Dante tries to sort out 
relationship problems, while Randal spends most of the day bored, 
insulting customers, watching porn movies, and discussing important 
matters like the true meaning of the destruction of the Death Star in 
Return of the Jedi (1983).
Shot in black and white, the $27,500-budget movie was filmed over 
twenty-one days at the QuickStop Groceries store where Smith had 
worked since he was nineteen, and where he edited the film each 
night. Anchored by a pair of great central performances, and packed 
with witty dialogue, the film also introduced the two hilarious 
characters Smith has used in his subsequent movies (Mallrats [1995], 
Chasing Amy [1997], Dogma [1999], and Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back 
[2001], all of which are at least partly set in Smith's home state of New 
Jersey): Stoner Jay (Jason Mewes) and his aptly named pal Silent Bob 
(played by Smith himself).  JB
Hugh Grant is the perennial best man in this hugely successful British 
comedy set at various social functions from director Mike Newell and 
TV comedy series Blackadder writer Richard Curtis.
Grant—in the part that propelled him from stiff-upper-lipped roles 
in movies like Bitter Moon (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993) to 
Hollywood megastar—is perfect as the chronically late Charles, who 
falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at one wedding and then spends the 
rest of the film awkwardly attempting to woo her. In between, this richly 
humorous look at the British upper middle class at play features all 
those classic wedding nightmares (the bumbling priest, a tactless toast 
from the best man, a bride jilted at the altar, the awkwardness of being 
seated at a table with all your ex-girlfriends) dressed up in lovely hats 
and gowns. However, it is the funeral of the title that provides the 
movie with its poignant heart.
Some may argue that the rarely expressive MacDowell was miscast 
as the love interest (perhaps so the British filmmakers could boast a 
Hollywood name). However, she sensibly takes a backseat to the 
wonderful supporting cast of characters, including Simon Callow, John 
Hannah, and Kristin Scott Thomas, who provide Four Weddings and a 
Funeral with its charm and funniest moments.  JB

Four Weddings and a Funeral  Mike Newell, 1994

1994
A brisk trot through events in American history from the 1950s until the 
1980s as seen through the eyes of one man, Forrest Gump succeeds as 
both epic and character study. This is thanks to clever, if occasionally 
sentimental, direction from Robert Zemeckis and a sensitive central 
performance from Tom Hanks, who won his second Best Actor Academy 
Award in as many years for the role.
We first meet Forrest, an amiable idiot savant with an IQ of 75, sitting 
on a park bench, waiting for a bus to take him to meet his childhood 
friend Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). While lingering there, he relates his 
life story to a succession of people who share the bench—and what a 
story it is. Raised by a mother (Sally Field) who corrected his gait with leg 
braces but never attempted to correct his mind ("Stupid is as stupid 
does" being her motto), Forrest went on to experience many of America's 
most famous events of the twentieth century. This begins on the day he 
discovered that he could run (outrunning bullies, his braces fly off and he 
speeds into the distance) when he uses his talent to become a football 
star. Over the next three decades, this simple man meets John F. Kennedy, 
Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon; becomes a Vietnam war hero (saving 
"Lieutenant Dan," his grumpy superior brilliantly portrayed by Gary Sinise); 
and later a shrimp tycoon. All the while he dreams of being reunited 
with Jenny, whose life takes a different path from his. Where Forrest 
experiences many cultural historical moments, Jenny is deep into American 
counterculture, protesting the war and embracing alcohol and drugs.
The love story between Jenny and Forrest is somewhat unconvincing—
she seems to turn up only when she needs help, which makes her 
character less sympathetic. However, this adaptation of Winston Groom's 
novel works best as the moving story of an honest, innocent man (superbly 
played by Hanks, who modeled his distinctive accent on that of Michael 
Conner, who plays Forrest as a boy), and as a meditation on the latter half 
of the last century, made possible by computer trickery that places 
Hanks—to often hilarious effect—in old footage of notable events.  JB

The social status of filmmaking among ordinary people, central to Abbas 
Kiarostami's wonderful movies Close-Up (1990) and Life, and Nothing More 
(1991) is equally operative in this entertaining and sometimes beautiful 
film. Through the Olive Trees concludes an unofficial trilogy begun with 
Where Is the Friend's Home? (1987), which focused on the adventures of 
a poor schoolboy in a mountainous region of northern Iran. Through the 
Olive Trees is a comedy about the making of a movie, mostly emphasizing 
the persistent efforts of a young actor to woo an actress who won't even 
speak to him. Like Kiarostami's subsequent Taste of Cherry (1997), all 
three films in the trilogy strategically leave out certain information about 
the characters, inviting audiences to fill in the blanks and in this case 
yielding a mysteriously beautiful and open-ended conclusion. 
If you're unfamiliar with Kiarostami—one of the greatest filmmakers 
alive and certainly the greatest in Iran—this is an excellent introduction. 
It was the first of his European coproductions and has the only professional 
actor he's ever hired, Mohammad-Ali Keshavarz, as the director. Shot 
exclusively in exteriors, it's an especially effective showcase for Kiarostami's 
gifts as a landscape artist, and the beautiful ways that he interweaves 
conversations in cars moving through this mountainous region, and the 
people and sights that they pass on the road, are often breathtaking.  JRos

The Shawshank Redemption  Frank Darabont, 1994
Much of horror writer Stephen King's work has been successfully 
translated to the screen (including Misery [1990], Carrie [1976], and The 
Shining [1980]), but the best adaptations are arguably those of his 
nonhorror short stories, like Stand by Me (1986) and this reworking of a 
tale originally titled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.
In 1946, quiet young banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent 
to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. While 
there he slowly builds a friendship with another long-term prisoner, 
Red (Morgan Freeman, who narrates Andy's story). Over a period of 
twenty years, Andy gradually learns the prison system and wins the 
respect of the governor and guards by using his banking skills to do 
their tax returns and business dealings for them, but he never stops 
wishing for his freedom.
Simply and movingly played by Freeman and Robbins, and 
beautifully scripted by director Frank Darabont (who keeps close to the 
source material, the only major change being that Red was an Irishman 
in King's story), Shawshank is an intelligent, engrossing tale, rich with 
characterization that, although not a box-office success on its initial 
release in 1994, has deservedly become a must-see movie thanks to 
word of mouth in the years since.  JB
Caro diario  Nanni Moretti, 1994
Dear Diary
Nanni Moretti has attracted the label of the "Italian Woody Allen," but 
this description is woefully inadequate. In Dear Diary he turns to the 
genre of the diary film. Yet this is not a spontaneous, cinema verité 
piece; everything we see is carefully scripted and staged.
The film is made up of three sections. The first and best is "On My 
Vespa," a glimpse at Moretti's daily travels. The second, "Islands," is the 
most overtly comic, showing Moretti and a friend in search of an ever 
elusive quiet island on which to work. The third, "Doctors," is a sobering 
and unforgettable account of Moretti's brush with cancer.
Dear Diary teems with marvelous digressions, reflections, and 
cinema quotations. Exercises in personal filmmaking can sometimes 
prove narcissistic and cloying, but that is not the case here. Moretti's 
hatred of pathos and easy spectacle serve him well. Everything in the 
film—from chemotherapy to a visit to the place where Pier Paolo 
Pasolini was murdered—is presented with utter simplicity and 
directness. Dear Diary is a glorious movie about everyday experience—
about traveling, dancing, thinking, getting sick, even drinking a glass 
of water. Few films give such a grounded and joyous sense of what it 
is to live in the material world.  AM

1994
Wong Kar-wai's preference to work without a script gives his films 
some brilliantly off-kilter cadences. That the results are just as often as 
beautiful and touching as they are challenging stands as a testament to 
his choice of collaborators and his trust in the same. Chungking Express 
tells two unconventional (and barely related) love stories, each involving 
a lonely policeman and set in the bustling urban epicenter of Hong 
Kong. In the first, young detective Takeshi Kaneshiro pledges to find 
a new girlfriend before an arbitrary can of pineapples reaches its 
expiration date. He thinks he succeeds when he comes across Brigitte 
Lin, who (unbeknownst to him) happens to be a drug dealer in search 
of a lost shipment. Then the director suddenly shifts gears to the laconic 
Tony Leung, a beat cop who catches the eye of counter girl Faye Wong 
at his regular eating spot. Frustrated by his apparent lack of interest, 
Wong expresses her affection by breaking into Leung's apartment, 
cleaning and redecorating it, relishing the chance (however fleeting and 
furtive) to live in his world and absorb his essence.
Both stories are as funny as they are oddly compelling. Yet the real 
star of Chungking Express is neither the actors nor the story, but the 
way they are presented. Working with talented cinematographer and 
frequent collaborator Christopher Doyle, Wong Kar-wai transforms Hong 
Kong into a blur of orange neon lights and disjointed, distorted images, 
playing with film stock, exposure, and speed the way others might 
fiddle with a script. Add to this a keen understanding of the power of 
song—in the case of Chungking Express, the Mamas and the Papas' 
quirkily incongruous "California Dreamin'"—and Wong reveals himself 
as one of the more pop savvy and iconoclastic of Hong Kong's new 
generation of filmmakers. While other films by Wong may pack more 
emotional resonance, Chungking Express gets by and gets off on sheer 
innocence, exuberance, and cinematic freedom, a striking triumph of 
style over substance that gives life to the grunge and chaos at the heart 
of contemporary Hong Kong.  JKl

A medical horror epic, The Kingdom was originally a four-part TV 
miniseries: Sewn together into two parts for theatrical showings, it ends 
tantalizingly with a "To Be Continued" caption setting up the similarly 
inconclusive Kingdom 2 (1997). Dr. Stig Helmer (Ernst-Hugo Järegård), 
an arrogant Swedish neurosurgeon in exile after plagiarizing research, 
is in trouble in the eponymous Copenhagen hospital because his 
botched brain operation has left little Mona (Laura Christensen) a 
babbling imbecile. Helmer's Danish nemeses are spiritualist malingerer 
Mrs. Drusse (Kirsten Rolffes), pompous administrator Moesgaard (Holger 
Juul Hansen), and Bilko-esque fixer Hook (Troels Lyby).
The Kingdom's spare, but escalating, supernatural manifestations are 
genuinely eerie, sometimes magical: a little quake as water eats away at 
the foundations; a discarnate spirt communicating with Mrs. Drusse 
through flickering fluorescent lights; a bloody hand waving in intense 
light inside a driverless ambulance. Throughout, von Trier (with 
codirector Morten Arnfred and longtime collaborator Niels Vørsel 
sharing the Mark Frost role) seamlessly blends the distinctive look of his 
early films (rust-colored filters, lots of water, muted or brown-toned color, 
suppurating unpleasantnesses) with the mock-documentary aesthetic 
of irony-laden 1990s soap: Jittery handheld camera work, deliberately 
rough edits, cross-cut subplots, catch-phrases ("Danish scum"), likably 
obsessive characters, and out-of-left-field plot developments.  KN

Deseret  James Benning, 1995
The better-known work of experimental/structuralist filmmaker James 
Benning, Deseret became an undisputed succès d'estime when it was 
premiered at Sundance in 1996. The title is an allusion to the name 
proposed by the Mormons when applying for statehood for the 
territory in which they were settling—later to become Utah. The film 
combines ninety-two New York Times excerpts from 1852 to 1991 with 
magnificently composed static shots taken throughout the territory.
Benning recorded images at different times of the year over eighteen 
months with his 16mm camera, pared them down to ninety-two shots 
of one minute each, and then reorganized them to "match," one shot per 
sentence, a prerecorded soundtrack of the New York Times stories boiled 
down to a few lines. Creating sometimes mysterious ties between image 
and text, the film leaves viewers free to make their own connections.
The text recounts the turbulent genesis of Utah. Apart from one 
spectacular instance, image and sound are at odds with each other, the 
East Coast style of the New York Times seemingly missing the point of 
the real drama that took place there. The landscapes resist the inscription 
of official history, yet they are haunted by its imperfect traces. Never have 
Benning's images been so beautiful, so starkly composed, and so sad. 
Their deceptively still surface hides troubled waters, but the emotion 
is kept at bay.  BR
Producer, director, and star Mel Gibson's gigantic historical epic 
combines brutal action, heaps of derring-do, and romantic tragedy so 
wholeheartedly that both the testosterone-crazed action crowd and 
women who love a good cry are pleased by at least one or the other half 
of its ruggedly handsome three hours.
Financed heavily by Gibson himself, whose attractions in tartan skirt 
and blue dye are matched by one of his most appealing and heroic 
performances, Braveheart is a panegyric for Scottish warrior William 
Wallace, whose loss of his love (stunning Catherine McCormack) triggers 
a handkerchief-wringing sequence of events in spectacular locations 
with a cast of thousands. Wallace's grassroots revolt against Edward I 
(dastardly Patrick McGoohan) at the turn of the fourteenth century 
climaxed with the Scots' victory at Stirling but ended in tears, betrayal, 
and butchery. Punctuated by battle sequences that run from thrilling to 
repulsively gory, the story is a good old-fashioned swashbuckler with 
vengeance and historical figures. Gibson took Best Picture and Best 
Director Oscars (among Braveheart's five wins) for a film made with 
passionate gusto and heart that retains a sense of humor and exhibits a 
flair for the mythic, balancing the sadistic and partisan excesses.  AE

Braveheart  Mel Gibson, 1995

This joyous fable of a pig who becomes a champion sheep-herder makes 
previously unrepentant carnivores seriously contemplate vegetarianism. 
Babe is an innocent, irresistible piglet whisked from breeding pen to the 
barnyard of an eccentric man of few words, Farmer Hoggett (James 
Cromwell), who develops an affectionate bond with the creature. The 
farmer's fat, rosy wife (Magda Szubanski) unsentimentally eyes the piggy 
as a Christmas dinner of roast pork. But Babe has "an unprejudiced heart," 
unfailing courtesy, curiosity, and courage, affecting every life on the farm 
and reshaping his ultimately heroic destiny.
Ten years passed from the time Australian producer and cowriter 
George Miller—doctor, vegetarian, and creator-director of the Mad Max 
trilogy (1979, 1981, 1985)—became captivated with British farmer turned 
teacher and author Dick King-Smith's charming children's book The 
Sheep-Pig to the film's production. Miller waited for the development 
of the technology he required. Now he could seamlessly mix real 
livestock with uncanny animatronic doubles. Plausible dubbing of voice 
performances (notably those by Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and 
Miriam Margolyes and Hugo Weaving as Hoggett's sheepdogs) set a new 
standard for anthropomorphic entertainment. Within moments, the 
illusion that the animals are talking completely takes over, giving 
credibility to the impulses of human behavior they display, from 
generosity and selflessness to neuroses to spite, bigotry, and criminality.
Longtime Miller colleague Chris Noonan made his feature directorial 
debut with witty invention, delightful pace, emotive use of music from 
Charles Camille Saint-Saens's "Carnival of the Animals," and the serenity 
of a St. Francis in choreographing his four-footed and feathered company 
to wildly hilarious and exciting effect. The story, narrated by Roscoe Lee 
Browne and a zany chorus of singing mice, has sweet, touching simplicity 
to enchant children while operating as beautifully on a more mature 
level. We hear and see gentle echoes of George Orwell's Animal Farm, 
whose satire was reproduced more faithfully in the darker, underrated 
sequel Babe: Pig in the City (1998).  AE

Who would have guessed that a grisly and upsetting serial-killer police 
procedural costarring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as detectives, 
written by a Tower Records cashier (Andrew Kevin Walker), and directed 
by David Fincher (Alien 3 [1992]) would bear a startling resemblance to 
a serious work of art? One can already tell that this film is on to something 
special during the opening credits, which formally echo several classic 
American experimental films and thematically point to the eerie kinship 
between the serial killer (Kevin Spacey) and the police—not to mention 
the kinship between murder and art-making that the movie is equally 
concerned with. The detectives are trying to solve a series of hideous 
murders based on the seven deadly sins, and the sheer foulness and 
decay of the nameless city that surrounds them—which makes those of 
Taxi Driver (1976) and Blade Runner (1982) seem almost like children's 
theme parks—conjures up a metaphysical mood that isn't broken even 
when the film moves to the countryside for its climax.
Admittedly, designer unpleasantness is a hallmark of our era, and this 
movie may be more concerned with wallowing in it than with illuminating 
what it means politically. In this respect, it shares some of the duplicity 
of Taxi Driver—another film that derives much of its power from America's 
love-hate relationship with fundamentalism. Se7en is one of the only 
Hollywood films to have shown widely in postrevolutionary Iran 
(along with the Godfather trilogy [1972, 1974, 1990] and Dances with 
Wolves [1990]). It likely showed there in censored form; one can't account 
for its appeal in that country simply by noting that its highly skilled 
cinematographer, Darius Khondji, is Iranian.
The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and 
persistence that something indelible comes across—something ethically 
and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs (1991) that refuses to 
exploit suffering for fun or entertainment and leaves one wondering 
about the world we're living in. One should note, however, that the film 
originally had a much grimmer ending—available now as a DVD bonus—
that preview audiences resisted.  JRos

in Fight Club (1999), Andrew, Kevin, 
and Walker, after Se7en's screenwriter.

Smoke  Wayne Wang & Paul Auster, 1995
Centered on a Brooklyn tobacco shop that also serves as a meeting place 
for colorful eccentrics representing a cross-section of New York society, 
this collaboration between director Wayne Wang and author Paul Auster 
wobbles intriguingly between an intricate character study and an 
improvisational comedy. But given the film's general emotional pay-off, 
punctuated with a bravura Harvey Keitel monologue, Smoke ultimately 
falls closer to the former, especially considering the heavy themes of 
trust, regret, and responsibility.
Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, and Stockard Channing are 
all great here, and Wang weaves their interrelated tales into a single 
impressive tapestry. Smoke's diverse plotlines are in fact all held together 
by tiny thematic threads: Many of the characters dwell on some 
significant loss in their life, others reflect on unrequited love, and still 
others try to restore a frayed bond between child and parent. Each 
thread connects one character to the other in subtle ways, and while 
the fabric of society may for better or worse be in constant flux or full 
of gaps, Wang and Auster optimistically imply that it's the inherent 
goodness of man which keeps it all from unraveling.  JKl
This fresh and unpredictable comic "thriller" from Iran is the first feature 
of Jafar Panahi, a former assistant to the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas 
Kiarostami, who's credited, along with Panahi and Parviz Shahbazi, with 
the screenplay. The White Balloon describes in real time the adventures 
of a seven-year-old girl named Razieh (Aida Mohammadkhani) and her 
older brother in the streets of Tehran during the eighty-five minutes that 
elapse immediately before the celebration of the Iranian New Year.
After convincing her mother she needs another goldfish for the 
celebration, Razieh sets off to buy one, but twice en route to the store she 
loses the banknote she's been given. Most of the remainder of the film is 
devoted to her efforts to get the money back. If the plot sounds slender, 
the movie is both gripping and charming, with well-sketched characters 
and expert storytelling—and Panahi's efforts to redefine our sense of time 
along the way are remarkable. Bit by bit, we're drawn into this child's 
perception of time passing, focused on her desire for the goldfish and the 
various obstacles standing in the way of her acquiring it.
No less important is The White Balloon's abrupt, last-minute revelation 
of middle-class snobbery on Razieh's part after a soldier goes to 
significant trouble to help her recover her money. This points one toward 
the more obvious ethical concerns of Panahi's next two features, The 
Mirror (1997) and The Circle (2000).  JRos

Underground  Emir Kusturica, 1995
Although slightly trimmed by director-writer Emir Kusturica for American 
consumption, this riotous 167-minute satiric and farcical allegory about 
the former Yugoslavia from World War II to the postcommunist present 
is still marvelously excessive. The outrageous plot of Underground 
involves a couple of anti-Nazi arms dealers and go ld traffickers who 
gain a reputation as communist heroes. One of them (Miki Manojlovic) 
installs a group of refugees in his grandfather's cellar, and on the pretext 
that the war is still raging upstairs he gets them to manufacture arms 
and other black-market items until the 1960s, meanwhile seducing 
the actress (Mirjana Jokovic) whom his best friend (Lazar Ristovski) 
hoped to marry.
Loosely based on a play by cowriter Dusan Kovacevic, this sarcastic, 
carnivalesque epic won the Golden Palm at Cannes in 1995 and has 
been at the center of a furious controversy ever since for what's been 
called its pro-Serbian stance. (Kusturica himself is a Bosnian Muslim.) 
However one chooses to take its jaundiced view of history, it is probably 
the best film to date by the talented filmmaker (Time of the Gypsies 
[1988], Arizona Dream [1993]), a triumph of mise-en-scène mated to a 
comic vision that keeps topping its own hyperbole.  JRos
In the 1990s, Hindi film reinvented itself as a slicker, younger, and more 
stylish form, the new cable and satellite television channels setting the 
pace for a new look and the growth in advance music sales allowing 
budgets to rise. This resulted in a return to the cinema halls of the 
middle-class audience that had deserted it for VHS. This decade also saw 
more films about the Indian diaspora—people of Indian origin settled 
overseas—and The Brave-Hearted Will Take the Bride was as much a hit 
with this audience as in its home country, making it one of the biggest 
hits in Indian film history.
Londoners Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh (Shahrukh Khan and Kajol 
Mukherjee, respectively, one of the decade's most popular screen pairs), 
meet on a vacation in Switzerland but are separated when Simran's 
family takes her to Punjab for a marriage that was arranged at the time 
of her birth. Although the girl is ready to run away with her lover, Raj 
insists her father should give her away; so he persuades her family to 
accept him by showing them he knows how an Indian boy should 
behave. The tight script and hit music made it clear that Aditya Chopra, 
though very much his own director, was set to follow in the footsteps of 
his famous filmmaker father, Yash Chopra (known for films such as 
Deewar [1975] and Lamhe [1991]).  RDw

In 1990s Hanoi, a young rickshaw rider (Le Van Loc) has his bicycle stolen, 
which puts him in debt to the woman who rented it to him. She sends 
him to the silent gangster and pimp Poet (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who 
puts him to work committing petty crimes to pay off his debt. What he 
doesn't know is that Poet has also persuaded his sister into working as 
a prostitute, servicing rich clients who pay with U.S. dollars. Thus two 
innocents are put on the path to corruption by the same man.
Cyclo's story may sound like a recipe for melodrama, but director Tran 
Anh Hung is after something else altogether. His approach is measured 
and considered. His focus is on color and silence as his camera lurks 
around the characters, discreetly awaiting the smallest flicker in their 
faces as thoughts and emotions shift and turn. The plot may take its 
starting point from Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief (1948), but it is not 
an exercise in Neorealism. Rather, the tone is almost magical realist, 
focusing on unexpected eruptions of odd beauty. There's a sense of Tran 
striving for a new form of storytelling, eschewing commercial genre 
conventions. The film could easily have been a thriller or a gangster 
movie, but Cyclo is a film in tune with the rhythms of the city it's set in, 
preparing to quietly reacquaint us with a place and a people we haven't 
seen since the news footage of the Vietnam War in the 1970s.  AT

When Jane Austen wrote the novel Emma, it is unlikely she ever imagined 
her tale of a nineteenth-century meddling young romantic heroine 
would be transplanted to late-twentieth-century Beverly Hills, but that 
is precisely what writer-director Amy Heckerling did with Clueless.
The film made a star of young Alicia Silverstone (who previously was 
best known as the star of the Aerosmith video "Crazy"). She plays Cher, 
a 90210 teen whose mother, as she tells us, "died in a freak accident 
during a routine liposuctioning," leaving Cher to be raised by her 
wealthy father (Dan Hedaya) in their vast Beverly Hills home. Although 
she does go to school with her pal Dionne (Stacey Dash), much of Cher's 
life is spent shopping on Rodeo Drive, coordinating her humongous 
wardrobe, and matchmaking for her friends, including school newcomer 
Tai (Brittany Murphy), who soon becomes something of a clone of her 
more savvy pal.
Like the Austen book on which it is (very loosely) based, there is a 
central love story. While interfering in other people's love lives, Cher 
barely notices her stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) as a possible romantic 
entanglement until it is almost too late. However, the film works best as 
a sharply funny satire on twentieth-century teens, complete with its own 
language (good-looking men are "Baldwins"—a nod to the handsome 
acting family led by Alec and Billy), blistering asides ("searching for a boy 
in high school is like searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie"), and 
well-aimed jabs at contemporary L.A. culture (Cher points out that 
she doesn't need to practice parking because everywhere she goes there 
is valet parking).
Heckerling keeps everything moving at a brisk pace, skewering 
fashion victims while making her heroine one of the most devoted, and 
Silverstone proves to be the perfect muse, fitting the role of the chic but 
dippy Cher to perfection. A funny, touching, and biting movie.  JB

Safe  Todd Haynes, 1995
843
Even though it arrived a few years early, Todd Haynes's Safe epitomized 
America's premillennial tension in the days leading toward the 
year 2000. Julianne Moore plays a vapid and materialistic suburban 
housewife who develops a severe allergic reaction to the world around 
her, starting with a rash and lethargy but leading ultimately to more 
violently disruptive responses. Desperate, she ensconces herself in a 
holistic retreat for people with the same problem. But is the ailment just 
a figment of Moore's imagination, a by-product of her tedious, banal 
existence? Or has her body truly revolted against modernity?
Haynes coyly keeps the exact nature of her illness ambiguous, 
depicting Moore's syndrome as very real while at the same time 
implying that her descent into sickness and subsequent embrace of 
New Age treatment may just be a search for something to fill a void in 
her life. Moore's performance is increasingly wrought with anxiety, 
panic, and fear, as she realizes that everything she knows—her home, 
her routine, her family—may have to be sacrificed for the sake of her 
well-being. Safe offers a lot of questions but few answers, bravely 
subverting sickness-of-the-week tropes by withholding the promise of 
a miracle cure. It's a thoroughly modern horror film whose threat seems 
to be civilization itself.  JKl
Heat  Michael Mann, 1995
In Michael Mann's telemovie L.A. Takedown (1987), there is a scene in 
which a cop and the criminal he has been obsessively tracking happen 
to bump into each other while shopping. There is a tense pause, and 
then the criminal breaks the ice with a classic invitation: "Coffee?"
That scene reappears in Mann's Heat, a film whose richly deserved 
cult following has steadily grown since 1995. Set in Los Angeles, it 
takes a well-worked theme—the symbiotic relationship between cop 
Vincent (Al Pacino) and criminal Neil (Robert De Niro)—and meditates 
moodily upon it. Mann combines a flamboyant, epic style with a manic 
attention to realistic detail—resulting in indelible set pieces like the 
street shoot-out.
In its exploration of family and intimacy, Heat treats a founding 
theme of noir fiction: the danger of bonding with another person. 
Agonizing scenes dramatize Neil's assertion that a "professional" should 
be able to walk away from everything in his life within thirty seconds. 
These professionals are almost automatons: hard-driven, single-
minded, and married to their unsavory work (rather than their teary, 
long-suffering companions). But they are also proud, stoic men, and 
in their determination lies a lofty splendor to which Mann pays 
immortal tribute.  AM

Toy Story Trilogy  
John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, & Lee Unkrich, 1995, 1999, & 2010
A Hollywood film franchise that heralded a new era in animation, the Toy 
Story trilogy irrevocably changed the cinematic landscape when the 
series' first installment arrived in the mid-1990s. Since then, a generation 
has grown up alongside Andy and his toys: Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz 
(Tim Allen), and the gang, delighting at their adventures in America's 
suburban landscape. And if the first two films detailed the wondrous 
adventures and occasional travails of infancy and youth, the third 
installment tackled the bittersweet reality of growing up.
With each installment we witness the gradual loss of childhood 
innocence, with the toys placed in an increasingly urgent state of peril. 
In Toy Story it is the cruelty of the boy next door, who mutilates his own 
toy collection, producing a dismembered population that wouldn't look 
out of place in a Tim Burton film. (The author Michael Chabon finds 
the film's adherence to orthodoxy troubling, instead admiring the 
imagination of a child who puts a wrestler doll in a dress.)
In its sequel, it is an adult—up until that moment an entirely 
trustworthy figure—who takes on the role of the villain. It introduces 
the notion that value can extend beyond friendship to commerce, 
where feelings and comradeship are replaced by profit and greed. And 
through Jessie (Joan Cusack) we first encounter the possibility of a child 
outgrowing their most valued possessions, which becomes the dominant 
theme in the third film.
In Toy Story 3 Andy is preparing to leave for college and with that he 
packs away his treasured toys. A comedy of errors results in Woody and 
his friends being accidentally donated to Sunnyside, a local day care 
center, whose happy exterior masks a darker, more threatening toy 
regime. The group's quest to return to Andy results in their being held 
hostage by Teddy Kingpin Lotso (Ned Beatty), a grubby, pink and white 
toy bear, who happens to be the center's de facto boss.
Two scenes heighten Toy Story 3's gravitas and emotional heft: the 
near-oblivion encounter faced by the toys when they are almost pulled 
into a furnace, and Andy's realization that he must let go of his youth 
and pass on his toys to a more appreciative and understanding child. 
It is these moments, interspersed among the usual banter and 
knockabout scenes, which saw the film resonate strongly among an 
adult audience. 
The Toy Story series realized the emotional depth that could be 
invested in animation, recalling earlier Disney successes, such as Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942), and highlighted 
how much had been lost among the less adventurous traditional 
animated features of recent decades. They are the pinnacle of Pixar's 
achievements and a treasure for those young enough to still play with 
toys, as well as the many who have long since given them up.  JT

846
At the beginning of Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, a timid, bespectacled, 
hypercivilized clerk, William Blake (Johnny Depp), is heading west to take 
up a career in the frontier town of Machine. The journey seems endless, 
and once he arrives he discovers that his position was filled months ago. 
Feeling dejected, he beds a prostitute, only to be interrupted by her 
fiancé who shoots her dead, wounds William, and is shot by him in 
return. William flees, beginning a journey through the wilderness of the 
American West in which, with an enigmatic Indian named Nobody (Gary 
Farmer) at his side. Progressively suffering from his untreated wound, he 
navigates toward his death. Nobody is his guide: "Do you know how to 
use that weapon?" he asks. "It will replace your tongue."
An essay on contemplation, Dead Man charms through Robby 
Müller's black-and-white cinematography (influenced by Ansel Adams), 
the exquisitely simple guitar score by Neil Young, and Depp's gentle 
performance poetry—typified when he lies down to embrace a dead 
fawn. Bizarre support roles by John Hurt, Iggy Pop, Lance Henriksen, 
Gabriel Byrne, and the lanky, towering, Robert Mitchum, in his last 
screen appearance, a smoking cigar between his lips—persuading Blake 
to leave his office by pointing a double-gage shotgun into his face—fill 
out the almost plotless scenery.
Much of the narrative and violence in Dead Man is flat and 
unromantic, especially the perverse, almost catatonic behavior of Cole 
Wilson (Henriksen)—a killer not so much cold-blooded as bloodless. The 
pervading silences of the great Western emptiness, the silver birch 
gliding by as William rides through the forest, Nobody's matter-of-
factness as he performs not entirely comprehensible rituals upon a 
man not entirely conscious, all lead to an almost meaningless evocation 
of person, place, and moment. When at the end Nobody pushes William 
off on a great lake, the spirit-canoe glides away into the other world in 
a vision that recalls the Death of King Arthur at Avalon.  MP

1995

With its convoluted plotting, macho repartee, and Bryan Singer's 
confident direction, The Usual Suspects is an absorbing confidence trick 
concerning the identification of a criminal archfiend: Who is Keyser Soze? 
Spacey snatches his first Oscar as Verbal "people say I talk too much" 
Kint, a con man and the talkative cripple to whose narrative we cling. 
Five criminals are placed in a holding cell to appear in a lineup, although 
none were actually involved with the crime for which they have been 
arrested. The seemingly chance meeting, however, inspires them to team 
up on a heist, which sets them up for blackmail and betrayal.
A hip, urban Rashômon (1950) with bursts of violent, beautifully 
choreographed action, The Usual Suspects opens on a scene of carnage 
in which a mystery man executes Gabriel Byrne's Keaton. This sequence 
will recur, revised, as remembered by Verbal and as imagined by his 
interrogator, a federal agent (Chazz Palminteri) too fixated on his own 
theory of why these men came together to "stand back from it" and "look 
at it right." The viewer makes the same mistake, cleverly misdirected.
Singer delights in sleights of hand (like a camera dissolve into a 
swirling cup of coffee and a thrilling elevator shaft assassination) that 
make one forgetful of loose ends. The contribution of John Ottman, 
performing the unusual double of editing labyrinthine scenes and 
composing the brooding score, shouldn't be underestimated either. The 
ultimate accolade is that one cannot say that the film does not hold up. 
It may not add up, but it remains a madly intriguing puzzle.  AE

847

Hans Petter Moland's Zero Kelvin has the crisp economy of a tough, 
knotty thriller by Roman Polanski. The story occurs in a grimly 
circumscribed setting: a shack in Greenland where three men hired as 
seal hunters quickly go crazy. Larsen (Garb B. Eidsvold) is a dandy; Holm 
(Bjørn Sundquist) is the quiet, scientific type; and Randbaek (Stellan 
Skarsgård) is a raging bull. For a while, dramatic tension occurs only 
between Larsen and Randbaek, as they seesaw between violence and 
boyish, petulant displays. But then Holm makes a sudden, decisive 
intervention—propelling the characters out of the shack and into the 
ice and snow. Now Moland can produce his most striking images and 
most ingenious narrative moves.
Although they are stranded in a landscape where all traces of 
civilization are absent, the characters' social values do not disappear, 
but instead are placed into stark relief by the monumental setting. 
Moland's ultimate concern is with the ethical dilemmas of human 
behavior under pressure. Zero Kelvin brilliantly examines what a 
normally civilized person will do in extreme circumstances, with all 
restraints removed. It asks what can separate men from beasts. And it 
coolly probes the constant claims of its characters to moral superiority 
or lofty idealism.  AM

1996
The team behind the 1994 British cult hit Shallow Grave—producer 
Andrew Macdonald, writer John Hodge, director Danny Boyle, and star 
Ewan McGregor—reunited for this punchy, grim look at the Edinburgh 
drug scene, based on offbeat writer Irvine Welsh's controversial novel.
McGregor stars as Mark "Rent Boy" Renton, an addict with a 
collection of misfit pals: casual dealer Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller); Spud 
(Ewen Bremner), a character who is destined to be one of life's losers; 
and Begbie (Robert Carlyle in a scary standout performance), a violent 
psycho who picks fights with anyone and everyone.
Boyle uses a clever cinematic imagination to bring these losers' lives 
onto the screen, from the showstopping opening moment as Renton 
runs down the street, to his infamous "Choose life" speech narrated as 
he is pursued for yet another petty crime committed to pay for his 
habit. Drug abuse here isn't depicted as a glamorous option—Renton's 
horrific hallucinations include a dive into possibly the most disgusting 
toilet in Scotland in an attempt to retrieve lost narcotics, and the 
unforgettable images of a dead baby that haunt him when he is trying 
to detox.
At the time of its release, some critics of the film complained that 
although Trainspotting doesn't glamorize drugs, it also doesn't pass any 
moral judgments on its drug-addicted characters. But Boyle and 
Hodge's refusal to take a moral stance is in fact one of the movie's many 
attributes—we are not there to judge Renton and his pals; we are just 
there to watch as, in a bleakly humorous fashion, their lives fizzle away 
to nothing. A fascinating, highly charged, and brilliantly played movie, 
Trainspotting is rightly regarded as one of the best British films of the 
1990s. It features some of the country's most startling young talent: 
Carlyle, McGregor, writer Hodge, and director Boyle (who went on to 
work with McGregor again two years later in the interesting but uneven 
A Life Less Ordinary).  JB

Fargo  Joel Coen, 1996
One specialty of sibling partners Joel and Ethan Coen is twisting time-
honored Hollywood genres into flamboyant, contemporary delights. The 
foremost filmmakers to emerge from America in the 1980s, their best 
films still look great, and the devilishly clever Fargo is among their very 
best. It's a wicked tale that provokes gasps of admiration and shock along 
with belly laughs. Embezzlement, abduction, deceit, misunderstanding, 
and murder are all in the frame, as is another regular feature of the 
Coenesque experience—a crime that gets totally out of control.
Fargo takes place in North Dakota, where oppressed car salesman 
Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy in the anxious performance that 
lifted him from ever-useful character actor to eagerly sought character 
actor) arranges a meeting with the two ex-cons he hires to abduct his 
wife. But most of the film, impishly introduced as a true story in the first 
of its macabre deceptions, is set in the austere, snowy landscapes of the 
Coens's native Minnesota (where the exaggerated regional dialect 
amusingly employed in hilariously banal chitchat is a flat, singsong relic 
of the area's Scandinavian immigrant pioneers, and at absurd odds with 
the heinous goings-on).
The desperately in debt Lundergaard cuts a supposedly simple, "no 
rough stuff" deal. His wife's ransom is to be paid by her rich, bullying 
father (Harve Presnell) and split between hubby and his hired thugs, with 
the woman going free none the wiser. Only things go horribly and 
grotesquely awry in the hands of the psychopath (Peter Stormare's 
Grimsrud) with a craving for pancakes, and the agitated bungler ("funny 
lookin' little fella" Steve Buscemi's Showalter) who can't control him or 
events. Enter Frances McDormand (Mrs. Joel Coen), absolutely fantastic 
as the very pregnant, comically ordinary but sharp small-town police 
chief, Marge Gunderson. Resolutely conducting her first triple homicide 
investigation with unhurried waddle and droll aplomb, Marge is easily 
the most engaging character ever conceived by the Coens (along with, 
later, Jeff Bridge's "The Dude" Lebowski).
The Coens's witty expertise results in a quirky, bizarre tragicomedy 
that manages to be wildly funny and violently distressing by neatly 
accomplished turns, the essential innocence and simplicity of some 
characters contrasted effectively with the depravity of others. Hapless 
criminals and victims are there not to be empathized with but to be 
cruelly toyed with for our wincing pleasure. That cold, malevolent streak 
that has recurred in much of their work is what prompted one detractor 
famously to dub them "arty nuisances." But it does not diminish their 
flagrant talent to dazzle, bemuse, and amuse. Against its icy visuals, Fargo 
contains some of their warmest work, full of signature Coen brothers set 
pieces and running jokes but also the surprisingly redemptive comfort 
of straightforward decency. McDormand and the Coens's screenplay won 
Oscars for breaking the mold in a unique case of murder.  AE

Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Gabbeh is an overwhelmingly gorgeous film. 
From its first bold strokes—when a young woman (Shaghayeh Djodat) 
seems to spring to life from a figure in a Persian carpet—the colors, 
sounds, and rapid associative editing are entrancing. But Gabbeh is 
much more than another exotic exercise in the vein of, say, Il Postino 
(1994). The mournful story of deferred love that fills the film offers a 
profound humanist panorama of love and longing, birth and death, 
nature and culture, magic and loss.
These days, every film with a few red-tinted sunset shots is lazily 
labeled "poetic." Gabbeh, however, is an authentic expression of the 
"cinema of poetry." Every word, sight, sound, gesture, and color comes 
to resonate metaphorically with something else: The gesture of an 
animal resembles the motions of carpet makers; rapidly flowing water 
is like a field of grass sent dancing by the wind.
Within the context of burgeoning Western appreciation of the Iranian 
New Wave, Gabbeh has been faulted in comparison with the Neorealist 
films of Abbas Kiarostami, such as Through the Olive Trees (1994), but 
Gabbeh shows a hushed, patient, timeless aspect of Makhmalbaf's 
prodigious talent. The breathtaking style he adopts here fuses folk and 
modernist elements in a way that refuses any absolute distinction 
between them. This is a film that has a limpidity and directness that are 
truly sublime, a movie that makes its way straight into the soul.  AM

Trois vies & une seule mort  Raoul Ruiz, 1996
Three Lives and Only One Death
Perhaps the most accessible movie of the Chilean-born Raul Ruiz (who 
has more than a hundred titles to his credit), Three Lives and Only One 
Death provides a sunny showcase for the charismatic talents of the late 
Marcello Mastroianni, who plays four separate roles, and stands as a 
testament to the filmmaker's imaginative postsurrealist talents as a yarn 
spinner and a weaver of magical images and ideas.
Mixing together ideas borrowed liberally and freely from stories by 
Nathaniel Hawthorne and Isak Dinesen with whimsical notions that 
could belong to no one but Ruiz (such as the tale of a millionaire who 
willingly and successfully turns himself into a beggar), Three Lives and 
Only One Death is a French comedy with a Paris setting, which often 
resembles a kind of euphoric free fall through the works and fancies of 
a writer like Jorge Luis Borges. Among the spirited cast members are 
Mastroianni's daughter Chiara, and Melvil Poupaud (who played in Ruiz's 
1983 film City of Pirates).  JRos
Shine  Scott Hicks, 1996
David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush) is a gifted pianist. But his promising talent 
as a concert pianist never reached the heights experts—his father 
included—expected of him. This film, by Australian director Scott Hicks, 
a former TV documentary maker, shows why, allowing Helfgott's story 
to unfold in a tragic way.
Like a slow-motion car accident, it is sometimes almost too painful 
to watch. As a young boy, Helgott (played as a youth by Alex Rafalowicz) 
was cited as possibly the best pianist of his generation and the next big 
thing in classic piano. This talent, however, wilted under the 
overwhelming pressure and presence of his father (played by Armin 
Mueller-Stahl). He's a man who lost his parents in the gas chambers and 
who certainly loves his son—but does not have a clue how to understand 
or manage his talent. It is the father's mistakes about his son that 
ultimately destroy the boy's burgeoning career.
Mentally fragile, Helfgott's prodigious skill at the piano surfaces only 
at the rarest times. Shine, for all its sadness, contains some of the most 
lustrous cinematic moments in memory, if only through juxtaposition 
with its bleaker instances. Based on a true story, this intense drama 
disturbingly reinforces the idea that suffering might just be the key for 
some artistic geniuses. Putting that cliché aside, however, Shine is an 
elegiac, nonjudgmental look at a true-life tormented prodigy who fought 
his own demons and finds redemption despite crippling emotional and 
mental odds. Much of the soundtrack features music by the real David 
Helfgott. John Gielgud appears as his London-based teacher.  KK

In 1996, Wes Craven—director of such modern horror classics as The Hills 
Have Eyes (1978) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)—shocked 
everyone who thought his career was over by initiating one of the most 
popular and successful horror series of all time. Scream, featuring a bevy 
of talented young actors (including Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, 
Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, and Jamie Kennedy), took 
the United States by storm, bringing in over $103 million at the box 
office and kicking off a new wave of hip and reflexive slasher movies. 
Urban Legend (1998), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), and of 
course Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), and the stalker parody Scary 
Movie (2000) all owe much of their success to Craven's original.
Scream's intense ten-minute prologue is among the most talked-
about horror scenes in recent memory. An anonymous caller threatens 
the lives of high school cutie Casey Becker (Barrymore) and her boyfriend 
unless she can answer such questions as "Who was the killer in Friday the 
13th?" Like everyone else in Scream, Casey has seen most of the classic 
slasher movies: Halloween (1978), Prom Night (1980), and so on. But only 
the most hard-core horror fans have a chance to live here and even that's 
not always enough. The main story concerns the efforts of virginal 
heroine Sidney Prescott (Campbell) to survive the attacks of a slasher 
film fanatic with a ghost mask and a very sharp knife. Only the timely 
help of dirt-seeking news reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is 
enough to save Sidney, who is shocked to discover that her enemy is 
really a pair of close male friends (including her sometimes boyfriend) 
who seem to get off on the fact that they kill without reason.
Among the reasons for Scream's outstanding success is an often 
hilarious script (written by Kevin Williamson, who would go on to create 
the hit teen TV show Dawson's Creek), the numerous jokey references to 
earlier horror movies, and Craven's expert direction, which manages to 
frighten audiences even while they're laughing.  SJS

Secrets & Lies  Mike Leigh, 1996
Secrets & Lies, Mike Leigh's gripping, multifaceted comedy-drama, 
winner of the grand prize at Cannes in 1996, may well be his most 
accessible and optimistic film. This possibly helps to explain why it 
remains the most celebrated work of a writer-director for stage and 
screen who is often best known for his anger and merciless skewering 
of class differences in Thatcherite and post-Thatcher England.
Hortense, a young black optometrist (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), 
seeks out her white biological mother (Brenda Blethyn), a factory 
worker who put her up for adoption at birth. As the two become 
acquainted, tensions build between the mother and another 
illegitimate daughter (Claire Rushbrook), between the mother and her 
younger brother (Timothy Spall), and between him and his wife (Phyllis 
Logan), everything leading to a ferocious climax.
The dense, Ibsen-like plotting of family revelations in Secrets & Lies is 
dramatically satisfying in broad terms, though it leaves a few details 
unaccounted for. But the acting is so strong—with Spall a particular 
standout—that you're carried along as if by a tidal wave.  JRos

Anthony Minghella's epic adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's Booker 
Prize-winning novel owned Oscar night, winning nine Academy Awards 
in the most sweeping victory since the 1987 film The Last Emperor. It was 
particularly remarkable for a film that the writer-director had almost 
despaired of making. Having been "intoxicated" by the poetic book, he 
spent over three years restructuring it, greatly expanding the doomed 
love story at its heart. The independent producer Saul Zaentz (One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest [1975], Amadeus [1984]) originally found backing 
from 20th Century Fox. But disagreements, such as casting Kristin Scott 
Thomas rather than an American actress, culminated in the studio pulling 
out. Production was halted before Miramax stepped in with the finance.
A severely burned and disfigured pilot (Ralph Fiennes) is found in the 
wreckage of his biplane in North Africa near the end of World War II. 
Apparently amnesiac, unidentified but presumed to be English, he is 
dying and in the care of French-Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche). 
Taking refuge in a devastated Italian monastery, they are joined by 
Willem Dafoe's vengeful Canadian torture victim and two bomb disposal 
experts for intimate explorations of memory, loss, and healing. The 
mystery patient—revealed as Hungarian Count Laszlo Almásy—recalls 
his past gradually between the late 1930s and 1945, in Tuscany, Cairo, 
and the Sahara Desert. Almásy's love affair with the married Katharine 
Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) unfolds with tragic consequences.
The film has two strong elements to captivate. The story is convoluted 
but classically, passionately romantic. And the production is meticulously 
artful, repeatedly likened to the style of David Lean, from dreamlike aerial 
sequences and a dramatic sandstorm to sensuous love scenes and 
enchanting effects—cave paintings examined by torchlight, church 
frescoes illuminated by a flare. The English Patient's scale, its majesty on 
big screens, and its sense of importance demanded recognition for its 
artistic and technical achievements.  AE

"Every night I cut out my 
heart. But in the morning 
it was full again."
Almásy (Ralph Fiennes)

John Sayles's wise and witty study of interconnected lives down by the 
Texan border with Mexico is about crossing lines, digging up the past, 
learning lessons, and moving on. It proffers a garrulous gallery of 
characters, all somehow connected with or investigated by Rio County 
Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper) after a skeleton is discovered in the 
desert just outside of town. Deeds privately reckons it may have 
something to do with the ongoing battle his late dad (Matthew 
McConaughey)—for years a local hero—had with a notoriously corrupt 
and racist lawman (Kris Kristofferson) several decades previously. What 
happened way back then? And how has it affected the present town, 
with its uneasy mix of whites, Hispanics, and blacks all keen to rewrite 
history as well as claim the future? How does the personal affect the 
political, and vice versa?
On the surface, Lone Star might be seen as a cross between a 
detective story and a modern Western, but it's more pertinently the kind 
of kaleidoscopic survey of a society in the process of change at which 
Sayles has been excelling for years—ever since Matewan (1987) and City 
of Hope (1991), in fact. Here, however, for the first time he adds flashbacks 
(sometimes as private memories, sometimes as shared experience) to 
include time as an extra ingredient in a heady brew already made up of 
class, money, sex, friendship, family, and race. Inevitably, given the 
border setting, the last figures heavily in terms of fear, hatred, desire, 
immigration, job prospects, and prejudice; mercifully, Sayles never 
sermonizes, but simply shows us how things function (or not, as the case 
may be). The dialogue is witty and colorful but naturalistic, the 
performances are excellent throughout, the use of music is 
characteristically sly and expressive, and Stuart Dryburgh's camera work 
eloquently conveys the various allegiances and divisions in the 
community on view. And watch out for that quietly subversive (albeit 
eminently justifiable) ending—forget the Alamo, indeed!  GA

Sayles's masterpiece. His screenplay

Before issuing a manifesto that urged subscribing to a dogma, Danish 
filmmaker Lars von Trier made a film about the ambiguous horrors of 
living by dogma. Set in remote Scotland in the 1970s, Breaking the Waves 
leaves behind the slickly designed, highly wrought artifice of the often 
monochrome magical worlds of earlier von Trier productions (The 
Element of Crime [1984], Europa [1991]) to experiment with the edgy, 
hand-held, rough-around-the-edges look typical of his The Idiots (1998) 
and Dogme95 pictures by other directors (such as Thomas Vinterberg's 
Festen [1998] and Joren Kragh-Jacobsen's Mifune [1999]). However, this 
is by no means a dogma or dogmatic film, as scenes are set with 
computer-augmented haunted landscapes and deeply unfashionable 
1970s pop music selections.
Von Trier was obsessed as a child with a fairy tale called Golden Heart, 
about a good little girl who gives away so much that she uses herself 
up—though his copy was missing a crucial happy ending. Breaking the 
Waves is the first of a trilogy, followed by The Idiots (1998) and Dancer in 
the Dark (2000), extrapolating from this theme. Here, the heroine is Bess 
(Emily Watson), a withdrawn, almost childish young woman raised in an 
austere, religious community in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. She begins 
to emerge from her shell when she impulsively marries Jan (Stellan 
Skarsgård), a Swede who works on an oil rig in the North Sea, but her 
new life is fractured when Jan is crippled by an industrial accident. 
Replacing her cold religion with extreme love, Bess takes a peculiar path 
to sainthood and martyrdom, discovering that she can reach the 
bedridden Jan only by recounting to him tales of sexual adventures, 
which leads her to comic, tragic, and ultimately fatal encounters.
Ostracized as a whore by village elders who routinely stand over the 
graves of women and curse them to hell for causing the fall of man, Bess 
is drawn out to sea to a boat captained by a Satanic Udo Kier, but the 
final moments of the film present her post humous influence as 
genuinely miraculous. The plot takes a difficult but rewarding path, and 
it might shade into gimmickry were it not for a startlingly real, affecting, 
and strange central performance from Watson.  KN

Independence Day  Roland Emmerich, 1996
Special effects movies don't get much bigger than Independence Day, a 
sci-fi bonanza that oozes American patriotism from every frame. Jeff 
Goldblum is the satellite whizz who picks up a transmission from outer 
space that seems to be counting down to zero. He heads off to 
Washington D.C. to warn the president, played by Bill Pullman (a very 
Clintonesque leader, with Mary McDonnell his Hillary-like wife) that 
spaceships appearing all over the planet may not be filled with fuzzy and 
friendly E.T.s, but are actually hostile aliens planning to devastate Earth.
Director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin pack their 
movie with humorous actors—Will Smith, Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, 
Harvey Fierstein—playing the action with tongue planted firmly in cheek, 
though the real star here is not any of the actors, but the brilliant special 
effects. From alien spaceships reminiscent of cult television series V, to 
the attacks on Earth (almost too realistic), we watch in horror as once 
great landmarks—the Empire State Building and the White House—are 
reduced to piles of smoking rubble. All in all, a great example of what 
edgy fun a sci-fi extravaganza can be.  JB

The Ice Storm  Ang Lee, 1997
Novelist Rick Moody captured the mood of the 1970s with The Ice Storm, 
a mesmerizing tale of two suburban families in emotional free fall. 
Making a film of the book in 1997, Taiwanese director Ang Lee elicited 
deftly controlled performances from a stellar ensemble cast of Kevin 
Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Adam 
Hann-Byrd, and Tobey Maguire. The limited plot of a story of tragedies, 
both small and large, is less told than felt, through the staging of a series 
of moody and atmospheric scenes.
Set in New Canaan, Connecticut, 1973, a suburban satellite of New 
York City—finally getting what the city has had for some time, a sense 
of being ill at ease—neighboring families the Hoods and the Carvers 
lead almost identical lives. The adults drink and smoke too much and 
talk about porn films or Watergate. Benjamin Hood (Kline) conducts a 
dispassionate affair with Janey Carver (Weaver, wearing the wild clothing 
of a 1970s suburban seductress), while Hood's wife (Allen, her hair in a 
controlled, precise bob), suspecting as much, is unable to coerce an 
admission of truth from her husband. Meanwhile, their children (Ricci, 
Hann-Byrd, and Wood) experiment with sex and booze in a detached 
manner. Paul Hood (Maguire), the film's most vibrant character, is a young 
man who makes sense of his family in terms of the Fantastic Four, a group 
of dysfunctional comic superheros. The weather, a deus ex machina so 
disliked by certain script theorists, works as another mysterious and 
deadly force the two couples can only handle after it has struck.  KK

Hana-Bi  Takeshi Kitano, 1997
Hana-Bi is a long way from Takeshi Kitano's police drama directorial 
debut, Violent Cop (1989). Kitano, simultaneously channelling Jean-
Pierre Melville and Buster Keaton, plays Nishi, a cop who left the force 
after an incident in which one colleague was killed, another paralyzed, 
and the culprit ruthlessly executed by his own hand. His wife—his life—
is dying, so he concocts a plan to rob a bank (witnessed on CCTV, in one 
of the director's most brilliantly realized comedy moments) in order to 
ensure a safe future for his colleague's widow and to whisk his wife off 
on a second honeymoon.
The tone is key to Hana-Bi. It is tough, but it is a film with violence 
in it, rather than a violent film. The brutal scenes with gangsters are 
contrasted with playful snapshots of the couple's journey around Japan 
and the paralyzed cop's tentative first steps as a painter, before the 
film's heartbreaking dénouement. The result is Kitano's finest work, 
satisfying both as a genre piece and in bringing together such disparate 
narrative strands.
Kitano's subsequent films have equalled only parts of this sum, and 
Hana-Bi looks more like the end of a creatively fruitful period than a 
beginning of a new phase. But such a blaze of glory must always offer 
hope of a return.  IHS
In Boogie Nights's vast canvas of life in the porn industry, Paul Thomas 
Anderson's debt to 1970s American cinema—particularly the work 
of Robert Altman—is all too clear. However, the sheer scale of his 
sophomore feature is an astonishing achievement.
Mark Wahlberg plays Eddie Adams, whose good looks, easygoing 
attitude, and impressive appendage find him transformed into rising 
porn star Dirk Diggler. Under the tutelage of filmmaking supremo Jack 
Horner (Burt Reynolds) and co-star Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), Dirk 
attempts to raise the quality of the product he is appearing in but is soon 
consumed by drug abuse and undermined by the demands of an ever-
changing business.
Like Altman's best work, Anderson's film features a strong ensemble 
cast. Hitherto known as a rap star and underwear model, Wahlberg was 
a revelation in the lead role, ably supported by John C. Reilly's co-star, 
Moore's moving turn as a mother whose work threatens her maternity 
rights, Heather Graham as the fun-loving roller girl, and a scene-stealing 
performance by Reynolds. 
If the film's narrative sweep occasionally overextends itself, or 
Anderson's penchant for complex set-ups is a little too self-reflexive, 
there is no denying the ambition of the young filmmaker.  IHS

L.A. Confidential  Curtis Hanson, 1997
Set in 1950s Los Angeles, a festering swamp of corrupt cops dallying with 
freshly minted mobsters and fledgling tabloids, Curtis Hanson's smart 
and soulful movie trims James Ellroy's heavily plotted pulp best seller to 
its emotional heart. Hanson's pacing is exquisite, his casting impish 
and inspired, as he traces the morally ambiguous alliance between 
three radically incompatible cops roped together in a multiple-murder 
investigation. Kevin Spacey cooks as a celebrity cop refusing to snitch 
on his mates. Russell Crowe is ardent and thuggish as a crusading 
policeman vying with uptight career cop Guy Pearce for the affections 
of a classy hooker, played by Kim Basinger (a career-making performance 
she subsequently failed to top).
Dressed in the sumptuous chocolate browns of warm film noir, L.A. 
Confidential is hot, funny, and sorrowful. Though it teases brash 1950s 
optimism with glum 1930s cynicism and tars both with the brush of the 
knowing 1990s, the film is also wildly romantic—perhaps the last great 
mounting of American film noir's feverish chase for and destruction of 
dreams. Dicks and dames collide in a grandiose lament for the loss of true 
love, moral courage, and, while we're at it, hope in our civic culture.  ET

In this brutal and provocative "home invasion" movie—a subgenre 
traceable as far back as D.W. Griffith and familiar today from such films 
as A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Panic Room (2002)—Michael Haneke 
pushes viewers to the limit, forcing us to contemplate the senselessness 
of random violence, as well as our seemingly ceaseless fascination with 
watching it on-screen. 
A well-to-do family of three go on vacation to their lakeside cottage. 
Shortly after their arrival, a chubby, clean-cut young man (Frank Giering) 
knocks on the door, politely asking to borrow an egg. He is quickly joined 
by a thinner and more refined companion (Arno Frisch). Initially fooled 
by the young men's polished appearance and their claim to be friends 
of the neighboring family, wife Anna (Susanne Lothar) allows them into 
the house. Once inside, however, the boys proceed to disable the 
husband (Ulrich Mühe), force Anna to strip, and shoot the couple's young 
son (Stefan Clapczynski).
While the sadistic teens play not-so-funny games with their victims—
all of whom end up dead by the end—the director plays games with his 
audience: At one point, after Anna manages to kill one of her captors, 
Haneke interrupts the diegesis, allowing the boy's friend to "rewind" the 
film, thereby saving his partner in crime. There is no happy ending here, 
only troubling questions and the inevitability of future mayhem.  SJS

Abre los ojos  Alejandro Amenábar, 1997
Open Your Eyes
863
Alejandro Amenábar's Open Your Eyes may be best known as the Spanish 
film Cameron Crowe remade with Tom Cruise as Vanilla Sky (2001), but 
it deserves to be seen for the true original it is. Intrigued with cryogenics 
and virtual reality, Amenábar has said he intended to make a "realistic" 
science-fiction movie out of mere "camera angles" instead of mind-
blowing special effects. But Open Your Eyes transcends such easy 
classification unless viewed as a precursor to such films as eXistenZ 
(1999), The Matrix (1999), Fight Club (1999), The Sixth Sense (1999), 
Memento (2000), and Mulholland Drive (2001)—dark films that peel away 
in layers, present identity as performance or virtual experience, question 
the nature of time and reality, and must be seen at least twice.
The film opens as narcissistic, well-off César (Eduardo Noriega) ditches 
his latest one-night stand, meets his "dream girl" Sophia (Penélope Cruz), 
and betrays his best friend the night before he awakens, after a hideously 
disfiguring automobile accident, in a psychiatric prison, accused of 
murder. There, he projects a present and future out of remnants of his 
past life and previously viewed films. Breaking down, he becomes unable 
to distinguish life from dream—that is, until the labyrinthine series of 
twists and revelations leading to the conclusion, in which the "reality" of 
everything that has gone before is chillingly undermined.  LB

The Sweet Hereafter  Atom Egoyan, 1997
Truly the exception to the rule when it comes to literary adaptations, The 
Sweet Hereafter handles author Russell Banks's novel so intelligently that 
even Banks has conceded the film improves on the book. Toning down 
his trademark diced-up time lines and fascination with multimedia, 
director Atom Egoyan creates a stunningly direct, almost fablelike 
exploration of loss. In fact, Egoyan brilliantly incorporates the Pied Piper 
of Hamlin into his film, eventually lending the wrenching events a 
reflective and somber thematic unity.
When a school bus crashes and sinks below the ice, killing most of its 
young passengers, the residents of a small town must find ways to deal 
with issues of grief, exacerbated by the presence of an outsider lawyer 
(Ian Holm) who believes only the assignation of blame can alleviate the 
town's feelings of collective guilt. Egoyan reveals the tragedy itself only 
in bits and pieces, and as the events of that day grow clearer and clearer, 
so does the director's depiction of the heartbreaking accident. As Holm's 
drive for financial and emotional reward draws to a close, the testimony 
of one survivor (Sarah Polley) becomes more and more integral to 
his case, but he soon learns that in the face of unthinkable despair, 
sometimes honesty comes second to reconciliation.  JKl

The story behind director James Cameron's labor of love is almost more 
dramatic than the tale that unfolds on screen. With a reported budget 
of over $200 million, even before its release Titanic was given the dubious 
honor of being the most expensive production of all time. Much of the 
cost went to a six-month shoot in Mexico involving a 775-foot replica of 
the famous boat, which sank when it hit an iceberg back in 1912. It was 
a shoot dogged with problems—including delays to filming when the 
cast and crew were poisoned by PCP-laced food in Nova Scotia. Rumors 
that Cameron was a crazed perfectionist emerged. His attention to detail 
included hiring the original companies that provided the real Titanic's 
furnishings as supervisors so that every chandelier and plate was a 
perfect replica. Following the film's stupendous box-office success (more 
than $1 billion worldwide) and the most Academy Awards (eleven) since 
Ben-Hur (1959), however, he was rechristened a genius, and is now 
deservedly considered one of the most successful directors of all time.
Cameron's vision is half Poseidon Adventure (1972) and half Love Boat, 
as both romance and deep-sea disaster are explored in equal measure. 
Kate Winslet stars as Rose, the young socialite who is to marry dastardly 
Cal (Billy Zane) but falls for steerage passenger Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) 
just before the world's most famous ship plunges into its watery grave. 
Their forbidden romance gives the movie its heart. Cameron piles on the 
special effects to truly convey the terror that is to come, forcing his actors 
to spend days in freezing cold water filming the scary scenes when 
the supposedly "unsinkable" ship begins to sink and then horrifically 
splits in half.
A blockbuster if ever there was one, Titanic made DiCaprio a superstar 
and teen heartthrob. The film boasts one of the biggest-selling 
soundtracks of all time—a number one hit for Celine Dion with the 
theme "My Heart Will Go On." In terms of production size and sheer epic 
scale, Titanic remains one of the most impressive films of all time.  JB

A middle-aged man (Homayon Ershadi) who is contemplating suicide 
drives around the outskirts of Tehran, trying to find someone who will 
bury him if he succeeds and retrieve him if he fails. This minimalist 
feature by Abbas Kiarostami never explains why the man wants to end 
his life, and is even inconclusive about whether or not he succeeds. Yet 
every moment carries great poignancy and philosophical weight. 
Taste of Cherry entrusts much of its meaning to the audience. Like 
many of Kiarostami's films, it is centered on the simultaneously private 
and public experience of a character in a car giving rides to others. And 
just as watching a movie in a theater combines private responses with 
public reactions, this is a film that speaks to both of these situations. 
Working without a script, Kiarostami filmed his nonprofessional 
actors separately from either the driver's or passenger's seat, provoking 
their lines as if interviewing them. Thus the subject of isolation that lies 
at the heart of Taste of Cherry is integral to the way it was filmed. 
Kiarostami is a master at filming landscapes and building parable-like 
narratives whose missing pieces solicit the viewer's active imagination. 
This even extends to the film's surprisingly cheerful, self-referential coda: 
An epilogue centered on camaraderie that follows this story about 
profound isolation radiates with wonder and euphoria.  JRos

Saving Private Ryan  Steven Spielberg, 1998
From his very first works, Steven Spielberg displayed an almost 
preternatural gift for filmmaking—specifically the machinations of 
suspense and special effects, a skill that movie audiences responded to 
in droves. But the massive success of such early films as Jaws (1975) and 
Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)—which helped congeal the 
blockbuster mentality of modern Hollywood—in some ways hurt 
Spielberg's reputation. Craving respect, he knew his movies would always 
be dismissed as merely popular entertainment and technical exercises.
Spielberg nonetheless tried to broaden his range with such mature 
experiments as The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987), but 
it wasn't until the harrowing Holocaust film Schindler's List (1993) that he 
finally made a movie that satisfied both the critics and the public. With 
the exception of his two thrill-ride Jurassic Park (1993, 1997) films, 
Spielberg has remained more or less in serious mode ever since. 
Saving Private Ryan introduced something new to the director's 
vocabulary: visceral, violent intensity. Spielberg had dealt with violence 
before, of course, but typically it was either cartoonish or carefully 
moderated (and then milked) as a dramatic beat punctuating moments 
of maximum horror. The opening battle sequence of Saving Private Ryan, 
however, is absolutely relentless. No sooner have American boats landed 
on the beaches of Normandy than young men are mowed down by 
incessant bursts of machine-gun fire, the bullets piercing their useless 
helmets with a sickening "ping." And it doesn't stop there. Soldiers are 
blown to bits. Body parts fly through the air and litter the ground. The sea 
turns a squeamish blood red. The camera lurches wildly, the desaturated 
film stock the color of death. The "new" Spielberg takes no prisoners.
Admittedly, the Spielberg of old can't always resist falling back on 
unabashed sentimentality. A pair of flimsy bookends start and end 
the film on purely manipulative notes, and Spielberg encourages his 
composer of choice John Williams to indulge in his worst heartstring-
tugging tendencies. More uncomfortably, the same techniques Spielberg 
uses to depict the horrors of the war in his truly awe-inspiring opening 
battle scene he later enlists to propel the more traditional good-versus-
evil conflict of the conclusion. 
But the familiar good guy/bad guy dichotomy actually twists the 
antiwar message into something more challenging. War is hell, Spielberg 
acknowledges, except when you're winning, since victory is ultimately 
what accords the right to dictate the rules of morality. Saving Private Ryan 
contains just enough darkness lurking in the fog of war to stave off 
accusations that it supports blind patriotism. Looking over thousands of 
graves, a soldier asks of his wife, "Was I a good man?" That's an ambiguous 
way of asking not just "Was it worth it?" but "Was it justified?" These are 
questions that no doubt haunt all those left standing when the shooting 
stops, surveying the death and destruction around them.  JKl

A visually inventive, kinetically exciting movie, Tom Tykwer's Run Lola 
Run is an exercise in surprises, beginning right from the opening credits 
where a crowd scene turns into an aerial shot in which the assembled 
people spell out the movie's title.
The plot itself is simple—young, shockingly flame-haired Lola 
(Franka Potente) receives a telephone call from her boyfriend Manni 
(Moritz Bleibtreu). Manni explains that he was supposed to deliver 
100,000 deutsche marks to a gangster, but he left the bag containing 
the loot on the subway. He has twenty minutes to find the money 
before the bad guys kill him, so his plan is to rob a bank—Lola's is to 
find the money some other way, and the film follows her high-speed 
adventure to save Manni as the minutes tick away.
It's the way young German director Tykwer shows us Lola's mission 
that is different and inventive. Her twenty-minute story is told three 
different times, each subtly different in a manner that delivers three 
different outcomes. Twyker uses animation, camera tricks, color and 
black-and-white film, music video effects, and instant replays to tell 
each adventure as Lola runs, Manni runs, and the film becomes a 
human obstacle course they both have to carefully maneuver in order 
to survive.
Potente, who would go on to appear alongside Matt Damon in the 
Hollywood blockbuster The Bourne Identity (2002), provides a striking 
cinematic image as she runs down the movie's various streets and 
avenues, arms pumping and distinctive red hair flying, but she also 
delivers a warm, more in-depth performance in scenes such as one 
between Lola and her wealthy father (Herbert Knaup), whom she visits 
asking for money only to learn that he plans to leave her mother and 
marry his mistress. Run Lola Run is an interesting, unusual filmmaking 
experiment that has humor, breathless excitement, and tremendous 
energy, all tightly packaged into an MTV-generation movie by the fresh 
talent of its writer-director.  JB

1998
On balance, Dogme95—a Danish film manifesto that calls for location 
shooting, handheld cameras, direct sound, and an avoidance of special 
effects—probably has more significance as a highly successful publicity 
stunt than as an ideological breakthrough, judging especially from the 
first two features that emerged under its ground rules, Lars von Trier's 
The Idiots (1998) and Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration. Both films, 
in fact, are apparent acts of rebellion and daring that are virtually 
defined by their middle-class assumptions and dogged apoliticism. 
Vinterberg's work, which is even more conventional in inspiration than 
von Trier's—think Ibsen, Strindberg, Bergman—is genuinely explosive 
and powerfully executed.
Shot with the smallest and lightest digital video camera then 
available, The Celebration chronicles the acrimonious and violent family 
battles that ensue at a country manor house where the sixtieth birthday 
of the family patriarch is being observed, not long after the eldest son's 
twin sister has committed suicide. The extreme forms of aggressive 
behavior that emerge from the onset and Vinterberg's jagged style of 
cross-cutting disguise the fact that this is basically a very well written, 
acted, and directed piece of psychodrama rather than the revolutionary 
experiment it was proclaimed to be. But the sheer dramatic power 
derived from the gradual unveiling of family secrets eventually and 
justifiably wins one over.  JRos

Rushmore  Wes Anderson, 1998
When director Wes Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson carved a new 
niche with the 1996 film Bottle Rocket, it single-handedly revived the 
then-exhausted realm of low-budget independent American comedies. 
Their second entry in this genre, the adorably miserable Rushmore, takes 
another look at the losers and oddballs they so adore.
Max Fischer (played by Jason Schwartzman, the son of Talia Shire 
and nephew to Francis Ford Coppola) is a bespectacled, intellectual 
geek. As a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy he is profoundly 
unpopular. Verging on flunking out, he manages to be president of 
virtually every extracurricular activity there is on campus. Doomed 
by his social skills, he nevertheless falls for a beautiful teacher (Olivia 
Williams) and finds a mentor in wealthy if depressed Herman J. Blume 
(Bill Murray). This slow, turn-of-the-screwball comedy is Murray's finest 
dramatic hour, allowing him at last to be profound, wounded, and funny, 
all at the same time. And the soundtrack of mostly 1960s rock music 
gives Rushmore a sense of being somewhere other than in its obviously 
contemporary setting.  KK

It's a deceptively simple premise for a ghost story: A cursed videotape is 
being circulated. Anyone who watches it will die seven days afterward. 
When TV reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) discovers that 
her niece is one of the victims of the videotape, she sets out to find it. 
When she watches it, the mysterious images convince her the curse is 
true, and she asks her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) for 
help. They have seven days to decipher the images on the video and 
find a way to break the curse, especially after their four-year-old son 
watches it as well.
Director Hideo Nakata achieves a steady sense of mounting disquiet 
thoughout the film as Reiko and Ryuji try to unravel the mystery of the 
videotape's images. What they find is a decades-old tragedy involving 
the death of a girl with unusual psychic abilities. There are no cheap 
shock effects here. Instead, Nakata relies on sound and atmosphere to 
suggest the presence of the unquiet dead hovering over the living, 
poised to strike.
In movies, the popularity of genres comes in cycles. A particular genre 
becomes relevant when it captures the anxieties and preoccupations 
of the times. Ring singlehandedly revived the horror genre for the end 
of the twentieth century, spawning two sequels, a prequel, a Korean 
remake, and an overcooked but hugely successful Hollywood remake 
(directed by Gore Verbinski), not to mention influencing dozens of horror 
films from all over the world.  AT

Buffalo 66  Vincent Gallo, 1998
Actor Vincent Gallo (Palookaville [1995], The Funeral [1996]) wrote, 
directed, and stars in this independent comic drama, which he has 
described as his masterpiece—an arrogant statement, perhaps, but one 
that's not too far from the truth. He plays Billy, a sleazy ex-con who 
kidnaps a feisty young girl (Christina Ricci, in tight skirt and fairy-tale 
slippers) and gets her to pretend she's his loving wife on a visit to his 
wacked-out parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara), who are unaware 
he's been away in jail. Billy has told them his absence was because he 
was working as an undercover operative for the government.
Wonderfully quirky stuff, this low-budget bizarre romance boasts 
suitably eccentric performances from the four leads (Gazzara as Gallo's 
pervy dad deserves a special mention, while Huston is a hoot as his 
football-obsessed wife), and some neat cameos from Mickey Rourke, 
Jan-Michael Vincent, and Rosanna Arquette. Gallo, meanwhile, multitasks 
superbly (he even wrote the film's music and used his parents' Buffalo 
home as the main location), delivering an ironic look at relationships and 
disillusionment with a variety of visual styles and images.  JB

Happiness  Todd Solondz, 1998
Few filmmakers can invoke so many varied emotional responses—
laughter, disgust, sympathy, just to name a few—from their audiences 
as contemporary American independent filmmaker Todd Solondz does 
with his highly controversial Happiness. There is no way to concisely sum 
up the happenings of this film, which involves a first-rate ensemble 
cast including audacious performances by Dylan Baker, Philip Seymour 
Hoffman, Ben Gazzara, Lara Flynn Boyle, Camryn Manheim, and Jon 
Lovitz. Suffice it to say that Happiness is about relationships—all of 
them painfully flawed—and takes us into territory few filmmakers dare 
(or want) to brave. One of the picture's most memorable scenes depicts 
a father answering, in utterly frank and matter-of-fact terms, questions 
from his young son about his acts of pederasty.
Happiness is perhaps best described as an indictment of the modern 
American family and suburban living (both on- and offscreen), 
suggesting that perversion lurks around every corner, inside every 
family's four walls. Solondz, who is evolving into a postmodern and more 
disturbed Woody Allen, has taken this perhaps exaggerated notion as 
his cinematic credo; he succeeds, in part, because he refuses to allow his 
flawed characters to spin off into the realm of one-dimensionality.  MO

The Thin Red Line  Terrence Malick, 1998
After making the highly acclaimed and influential Badlands (1973) and 
Days of Heaven (1978), Terrence Malick did something unheard of for a 
prominent director—he vanished without a trace. Rumors abounded: 
Malick was living life as a recluse in some remote locale. Or maybe he 
was hiking across Texas, bird watching. Wherever he disappeared to, 
word of his late 1990s return to filmmaking came just as suddenly. 
Details of Malick's new project were closely guarded and sketchy at best, 
but two things were clear—it was an adaptation of James Jones's World 
War II novel The Thin Red Line, and it reportedly featured a massive cast 
of several prominent actors and promising newcomers alike.
Both rumors proved correct, but the film still surprised many as 
unexpected. Especially coming after Steven Spielberg's own World 
War II drama Saving Private Ryan (1998), Malick's The Thin Red Line 
seemed particularly cerebral. The two films couldn't have been more 
different, and the reactions they provoked reflected those discrepancies. 
Audiences left visceral Saving Private Ryan shaken to the core. Audiences 
left the more philosophical The Thin Red Line scratching their heads.
Yet there's no question which film leaves the stronger impression. 
The Thin Red Line addresses the madness of war from a distinctly 
theoretical, even theological vantage. War, the film seems to say, is 
more than just a conflict between two groups of men. War is depicted 
in The Thin Red Line as an affront to nature, and in turn an affront to 
God himself.
Malick's film delves into the collective consciousness of the troops 
as it struggles to reconcile the fragility of life with the recklessness of 
their behavior. Daringly, The Thin Red Line flits from soldier to soldier, 
getting into their heads and amplifying their thoughts as part of an 
ongoing internal dialogue, but otherwise retaining a sense of anonymity 
among the soldiers.
The men are highly aware of the exotic world around them and in 
particular its beauty: When the film begins, one soldier (Jim Caviezel) has 
gone AWOL, living a life of simplicity and innocence among a South 
Pacific tribe until his Eden-like existence is disrupted. Even as the soldiers 
slink through the forest, Malick can't resist training his camera on the 
colorful wildlife around them, or capturing the light streaming through 
the leaves of the towering trees. It's as if God and all of his creatures are 
watching this strange species at work destroying all that is good in the 
world, and wondering what free will hath wrought.
Several performances do stick out in the film—Elias Koteas's sensitive 
Captain; Nick Nolte's callous, career-minded colonel; Sean Penn's cynical 
Sergeant—but Malick keeps the narrative elliptical. The Thin Red Line has 
no real beginning or end, and although it is punctuated by dramatic 
beats and thrilling battle scenes, they serve as interruptions of no less a 
profound meditation than Malick's quest for the meaning of life.  JKl

"In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods 
near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary... A year 
later their footage was found." Thus begins this shoestring-budgeted 
horror "mockumentary," which parlayed innovative online marketing and 
incredible word-of-mouth into more than $140 million in the United 
States alone—making it the most profitable U.S. independent film of all 
time (a record that stood until 2007's Paranormal Activity).
Led by aspiring director Heather Donahue, the three students make 
their way to Burkittsville (née Blair), Maryland, to shoot footage for a 
documentary about a local legend, the Blair Witch. Rumor has it this 
mysterious figure has haunted the nearby Black Hills forest since the 
eighteenth century and is responsible for a number of heinous murders. 
After conducting interviews with locals, Heather, Mike, and Josh hike 
into the forest to gather additional footage. None of them experienced 
campers, they get lost, and their cheery demeanor deteriorates into 
an increasingly volatile mixture of fear, blame, frustration, and panic. 
Ominous signs begin to appear, including piles of stones carefully 
positioned outside their tent and wooden effigies hanging in the trees. 
Then Josh silently disappears. In the film's harrowing finale, Michael and 
Heather stumble across a decrepit house. Hoping to find Josh, they enter; 
what they discover is a nightmare. Through her camcorder, we see what 
Heather sees: first darkness and ruins and children's handprints on the 
walls; then, after someone or something knocks her unconscious, just a 
blank ceiling, which lasts until the tape—and the film itself—runs out.
Despite criticisms of the sometimes slow pace and nausea-inducing 
handheld camera work, The Blair Witch Project clearly succeeds in its use 
of documentary techniques as a means of instilling terror in viewers. 
Myrick and Sánchez's unique production method has itself become the 
stuff of legend: The actors were responsible for shooting the entire film 
themselves (over the course of eight consecutive days and nights), had 
to carry their own equipment, and improvised almost all of their lines. 
Several times a day, the directors wrote notes to each actor, sealing them 
in tubes for their eyes only. By achieving such a high degree of realism, 
Myrick and Sánchez took their product a step beyond earlier horror films 
with mockumentary aspirations, such as Wes Craven's The Last House on 
the Left (1972) and Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).
Exploiting some of our most basic fears—the dark, the unknown, 
strange sounds—The Blair Witch Project elicits intense emotions. Some 
of the most terrifying moments occur when all we are able to see is a 
black/blank screen—what our imagination conjures up is far more 
frightening than anything the most sophisticated special effects or 
makeup can produce. It is to their credit that those involved in the 
making of this film were well aware of this often ignored fact.  SJS

Acclaimed music video director turned filmmaker Spike Jonze (whose 
previous works included Fatboy Slim's "Weapon Of Choice" and the 
Beastie Boys' "Sabotage") turned one of the oddest concepts for a movie 
into one of the most inventive Hollywood films of the 1990s. "I had this 
idea that someone finds a portal into someone's head," writer Charlie 
Kaufman explained at a Bafta lecture in 2011, "and I had another idea... 
about someone having an affair with a co-worker. And neither one was 
going anywhere, so I just decided to combine them."
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a disheveled puppeteer scraping a 
living with his dark (and, to children, quite traumatic) street puppet 
shows. His wife Lotte (an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) spends 
what little they have on raising the menagerie of animals she has living 
in their small home. To earn extra cash, Craig takes a job as a filing clerk 
in a strange company on floor 7½ of a Manhattan office building. How 
an office could exist between the seventh and eighth floors is a movie 
in itself, but it is a door Craig discovers hidden behind a filing cabinet 
that sets this film's quirky events in motion. When Craig crawls through 
it, he discovers it is actually some sort of portal that sends him hurtling 
into the brain of actor John Malkovich (playing himself here). Craig 
experiences the things Malkovich does for just fifteen minutes before 
being expelled abruptly onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Kaufman weaves an intricate plot around this idea, beginning when 
Craig lets colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) in on his discovery and 
she convinces him to charge people to try this demented ride. Jonze 
dazzles at every turn as he tells this smart, subversive, darkly comic tale, 
and the cast—Cusack and Diaz especially—beautifully translate his 
skewed vision to the screen. Of course, Being John Malkovich wouldn't 
have worked without the eponymous actor, who parodies his image 
brilliantly, especially in a scene when he tries the portal himself and ends 
up in a restaurant populated by Mr. Malkoviches. "It never occurred to 
me that anyone would actually be goofy enough to make that movie," 
the actor recalled. "But of course I hadn't met Spike Jonze then."  JB
Being John Malkovich  Spike Jonze, 1999
Malkovich initially offered to direct 
the film if Kaufman made someone 
else its subject. Kaufman refused.
"I wrote Being John 
Malkovich before I even 
knew who Spike Jonze 
was. He just happened 
to be the person who 
could get it made and 
wanted to make it."

M. Night Shyamalan, aged just twenty-nine and making only his third 
film, virtually reinvented the thriller with a love story/chiller infamous 
for its final twist. "Most movies that you see now come out of modern 
novels," its star, Bruce Willis, told Reader's Digest. "Some bestseller book 
immediately gets turned into a film, or you see films that are remakes 
of old films, or remakes of TV shows from the '60s. What Night does 
that makes him completely unique is he makes the stuff up out of his 
head... He is—and I don't use this word very often—a genius."
A year after being shot by a former patient, psychologist Malcolm 
Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to understand a troubled boy, Cole 
(Haley Joel Osment). Cole, it seems, can see dead people: ghosts of 
those who left matters unresolved before their deaths and who visit 
the boy searching for resolution. Meanwhile, Malcolm's own life is in 
disarray, his loving marriage to wife Anna (Olivia Williams) now distant 
and cold.
A ghost story of the highest order, The Sixth Sense works on many 
levels. The spooks are there as Cole is visited by tormented apparitions, 
but this is more emotional drama than scary suspense film, focusing on 
the relationships between boy and psychologist, Malcolm and his wife, 
and Cole and his mother (Toni Collette). Osment is a terrific discovery in 
a role that, had it been played too cute, would have wrecked the entire 
film, and Collette delivers the right amount of confusion and love for 
her unusual son. Willis, however, is the true revelation, giving a 
whispered, understated performance that is the heart of the film.
But it is Shyamalan who deserves the most praise. His clever use of 
muted colors and subtle hints of what is to come—the temperature 
dropping when a ghost is present, the use of the color red—and the 
twist in the tale are so neat that you want to reappraise the film rather 
than be annoyed that you have been led down a completely different 
path than the one you thought you were on. A modern, emotionally 
complex classic that is as achingly poignant as it is chillingly tense.  JB

Three Kings  David O. Russell, 1999
877
Three Kings is a millennium-capping antiwar film that employed what 
were then state-of-the-art tools (fast edits, dizzying camera work, color 
schemes that pop off the screen) and combined them with a helping of 
old-fashioned, M*A*S*H-style politics.
Writer-director David O. Russell tells the tale of the first Gulf War 
(1991) through the eyes of three American soldiers whose ignorance, 
greed, and naïveté is slowly wiped away as they are dragged deeper into 
the political and cultural trappings behind the war, forced to humanize 
their enemies and demystify their own country and military. In the 
process, the audience is exposed to a version of the war that the media 
was once reluctant to report—the deaths of innocents, the corruption 
and posturing of military officials, and the co-option of "objective" media 
(spiritedly represented here by Nora Dunn) to spin the story. 
It's heady, even dense, stuff made accessible and urgent through a 
snappy script, relentlessly energetic pacing, dazzling visuals, and taut 
acting from the leads (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and 
Spike Jonze). An assured juggling of genre and tone shifts—it's part war 
story, part heist thriller, and wholly an antiwar creed—the film should 
fall apart at the seams but doesn't strike a single false note.  EH
Magnolia  Paul Thomas Anderson, 1999
"As we move through life, we should try to do good." In a sprawling story 
of family—and the betrayal, secrets, heartaches, and disappointments 
within—writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson jumps back and forth 
between a sleazy, misogynistic television huckster (Tom Cruise); a lonely 
child prodigy (Jeremy Blackman); an elderly, dying misanthrope (Jason 
Robards) and his trophy wife (Julianne Moore); a boozing, drug-addled 
young woman (Melora Walters); a popular, dying quiz-show host (Philip 
Baker Hall); and a bumbling, lonely, big-hearted cop (John C. Reilly). The 
coincidences and twists of fate that link them drive this epic film.
Filled with biblical allusions, Magnolia makes no secret of grappling 
with weighty issues—the meaning of life, the nature of evil, the terms 
of human connection. "I thought it would be really interesting," the 
director told the Guardian, "to put this epic spin on topics that don't 
necessarily get the epic treatment, which is usually reserved for war 
movies or political topics." What makes this work so well is Anderson's 
ability to portray these themes by focusing on the minute details of his 
characters' bruised lives. Frogs fall mysteriously from the sky and people 
fall apart. The whole while, Anderson maintains an unwavering empathy 
with his broken characters, humanizing the villains while siding with the 
victimized and misunderstood. Magnolia seethes with anger and pain, 
while staggering toward hope and something like redemption.  EH

Fight Club  David Fincher, 1999
"The first rule about Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club. 
The second rule about Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club." 
Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, David Fincher's film stakes out 
manly territory in 1999's most intriguing and angry, yet witty cinematic 
fantasy. Fight Club is as morally challenging as it is visually memorable. 
In a quote that a gleeful Fincher blew up and stuck on his office wall, 
British Evening Standard film critic Alexander Walker complained, "The 
movie is not only anti-capitalist but anti-society and, indeed, anti-God."
Edward Norton plays the mild-mannered narrator who, tortured by 
his empty office life, goes to group therapy just to feel something. At one 
of these meetings, he meets and falls for Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), 
then hooks up with the dangerously wild Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler 
convinces Norton that his life can be better lived by learning how to 
fight. Soon enough, their antics attract other men, giving them all 
something their ordinary lives are lacking—a sort of dirty, aggressive 
dignity, which is eventually reorganized into a virtual terrorist cell.
With astonishing camera and special effects work, Fight Club moves 
at rocket-like pace. The result is an exciting, distressingly inspiring movie 
that makes even the strangest event seem normal, including Meat Loaf 
as a cancer patient with enormous mammary glands.  KK
After Hideo Nakata's Ringu (1998) proved that contemporary Japanese 
horror was a force to be reckoned with, Audition effectively reworked the 
genre by masking its true intentions behind a wall of melodrama. "The 
directors whose films scare me the most," explained director Takashi 
Miike, "are the ones who carefully hide the aggression in the background 
and don't show it directly." The film's terrifying third act duly had many 
audience members hiding their eyes—if not running from the theater. 
Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), the lonely, middle-aged owner of 
a video production company, worries about finding the right woman to 
replace his adolescent son's mother, who died seven years ago. A friend 
suggests auditioning actresses for a fake role in a made-up project so 
that he can review possible candidates for the role of new girlfriend. The 
last girl to audition is the beautiful and enigmatic Asami (Eihi Shiina). 
Aoyama is instantly attracted to her and they start dating. Initially, she 
proves as dutiful as she is beautiful, and Aoyoma proposes marriage to 
her during a romantic weekend away at a picturesque seaside resort. 
However, Asami vanishes and Audition abruptly shifts from romantic 
drama to violent thriller. Sex is frequently depicted as a weapon as 
Asami's disturbing past and monstrous personality are revealed.  SJS

If Blue Velvet (1986) peeked behind the curtains of suburbia, American 
Beauty yanked them away from the windows. "This is my neighborhood, 
this is my street, this is my life," says Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in 
voice-over at the start of the film. "I'm forty-two years old. In less than a 
year, I'll be dead. Of course I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead 
already." Like Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard (1950), Lester and the audience 
know his fate from the beginning, but that is just one part of his story. 
American Beauty is a bleak comedy about what life is really like for 
those supposedly living the American dream—people who don't lack 
for anything material but who are unhappy, unfulfilled, and dissatisfied. 
Mainly, this is Lester's story, and with Spacey in the role it is a fascinating 
one—that is, on the surface, a tale of midlife crisis as he tries to rediscover 
the freedom he has lost in the face of marital and parental responsibility. 
Forced to accompany his wife to a basketball game to watch his 
cheerleader daughter perform, he is transfixed by the Lolita-esque 
Angela (Mena Suvari). He is soon having erotic visions (most memorably, 
her naked but for a cover of red rose petals) that lead him to completely 
change his life in the hope that he will be able to seduce her.
Written by Alan Ball—who went on to create the acclaimed HBO 
television series Six Feet Under—this is a funny, sad, wistful, and even 
hopeful movie that never goes quite where you think it will.  JB

Claire Denis is one of the world's most audacious, talented directors, and 
Beau Travail may well be her crowning glory. Based on Herman Melville's 
novella Billy Budd, the film is set in the rugged outback of Africa, where 
the French Foreign Legion—men of every race and hue—undergo 
rigorous training. The stark desert, with its endless stretch of sand and 
jagged rocks beneath a rolling blue sky, provides a breathtaking canvas 
for Denis, who captures the rituals of exercise, marching, showering, and 
bonding with a poet's eye. In her carefully constructed scenes, everyday 
routines are transformed into gracefully choreographed dances. But 
while this ode to masculinity and male beauty is unfolding, the jealousy 
of a military official, Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), toward one of his 
underlings, Sentain (Gregoire Colin), builds toward a tragic ending.
Galoup narrates the tale in voice-over. The homoeroticism of the 
military experience is neither forced nor shied away from, and doesn't 
really qualify Beau Travail as an example of queer cinema, as both fans 
and detractors of the film declared upon its release. Denis's interests are 
broader than that. In brief but powerful strokes, she raises questions 
about the relationships of whites to blacks, especially in former European 
colonies. Connections between gender and racial politics are made in 
scenes where the men go into town on leave and mingle with local 
women. But the film remains steadfastly ambiguous, never taking any 
specific stance on these issues. Most importantly, Denis, with minimal 
dialogue and with a primary focus on hypnotic visuals that fill the screen 
in long takes, captures the beauty of ritual and repetition—as well as the 
power of monotony to break spirit.
In terms of sheer beauty alone, Beau Travail pays off frame for frame, 
whether it's the sight of the men in formation performing calisthenics, 
or the happy accident of Denis capturing a ray of sun as it's refracted in 
the window of a moving train—or, finally, the disgraced officer, dancing 
beneath a spinning disco ball. Denis tells her stories through images 
rather than through dialogue and plot, with a gift for color, lighting, and 
composition that is unsurpassed.  EH
Beau Travail  Claire Denis, 1999
Not allowed into the Foreign Legion, 
Denis instead had to observe their 
training in the desert at a distance.
"What you're seeing is a 
realistic depiction . . . the 
French legionnaires in 
the desert do train under 
the sun half-naked."

Todo sobre mi madre  Pedro Almodóvar, 1999
All About My Mother
Pedro Almodóvar's 1999 film opens on a handsome boy, Esteban (Eloy 
Azarín), who's very close to his single mother, Manuela (Cecilia Roth). For 
a while (via sly references to Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams) it 
looks as though we're about to see a thinly disguised gay autobiopic. In 
a way we are, for although Esteban is killed off on his seventeenth 
birthday and the focus shifts to Manuela, All About My Mother—like many 
Almodóvar films—constructs femininity through the irreverent, loving 
gaze of a gay man who grew up surrounded by adoring women on the 
verge. Crazed with grief, Manuela travels to Barcelona and finds herself 
playing den mother to a pregnant nun with AIDS (Penélope Cruz, in one 
of the great Spanish roles she traded away to become a Hollywood pin-
up), a beat-up transgendered prostitute (Antonia San Juan) who stage 
manages her every moment, and a lesbian actress (the great Marisa 
Paredes) who is playing Blanche Dubois in more ways than one. The plot, 
elaborately structured and layered with significance, is an excuse to 
throw together a bunch of throaty-voiced women (with or without their 
own breasts) to talk dirty, booze, weep, and prop each other up.
When a woman in an Almodóvar film cries, it's a heaving, gasping, 
aristocratic happening. Still, in his court-jester way, Almodóvar is the 
most enthusiastic of social levelers. A nun can fall, a hooker can rise, and, 
though both may rail at their fates, their suffering lacks bitterness or rage. 
Even the color scheme is egalitarian, and trash has its own beauty: The 
cars of johns trawling for hookers at night beneath a Barcelona bridge 
are bathed in the same moonlit loveliness as the city's old buildings.
Toward the end, the prostitute steps on stage and, having itemized 
her many surgeries to an appalled audience of bourgeois theatergoers, 
enchants them with her ad-libbed thoughts on what it takes to be real. 
"You are more authentic," she says, "the more you resemble the things 
you've dreamed of." For Almodóvar, nature is overrated, while acting—
lying included—frees us to be our worst and best selves. This wonderfully 
seductive set piece summarizes the exuberantly humane credo that 
animates every movie he makes. All About My Mother contains scenes as 
candid and uproarious as any of the director's early films, but sustains 
the quieter, sadder, and more reflective tone that began in 1995's The 
Flower of My Secret, and continued in 2003's lovely Talk to Her. 
As the movie closes, this alluring coven of women shakes out into 
fresh unions, cemented not only by Almodóvar's elastic definition of 
womanhood, but by his conciliatory spirit—assuring us that though 
anatomy may not be destiny, the kindness of female strangers is 
irreducible. Given the pap that is too often most studios' idea of a 
"women's movie," gay filmmakers like Almodóvar and Todd Haynes 
may be providing a last refuge for strong female roles, as well as for 
wholehearted melodrama in our hyper-ironic age.  ET
"I read about a bunch 
of nuns who lived in 
a house and worked 
with transvestites and 
prostitutes and drug 
addicts, trying to help 
them to establish new 
lives for themselves."

The Matrix  Andy Wachowski & Lana Wachowski, 1999
A sci-fi blockbuster that effectively fuses pop-philosophy with skillfully 
choreographed action and state-of-the-art special effects, The Matrix 
was conceived of, written, and directed by siblings Andy and Lana 
Wachowski. The former comic book writers threw just about everything 
into the mix, including The Wizard of Oz and The Wild Bunch, Alice in 
Wonderland and Hard Target, Sleeping Beauty and The Bible.
Keanu Reeves is a dutiful company man who doubles at night as a 
hacker named Neo. His skepticism concerning the true nature of reality 
is validated after a beautiful mystery woman, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), 
introduces him to legendary Zen-hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). 
Accepting Morpheus's invitation to take a mind-opening techno-drug 
trip, Neo discovers that the world in which he previously "existed" is 
nothing but a computer-generated virtual reality program controlled by 
artificial-intelligence machines developed by mankind years before. It 
seems the machines, which require endless supplies of electrical current 
to survive, keep the entire human population—save for a smattering of 
rebels and one underground city—in a state of perpetual hallucination. 
Lying unconscious in automated incubators, humans are deceived into 
believing that they are leading productive lives, while in reality vampire-
like computers siphon their precious mojo. Morpheus is certain Neo is 
the "One," who, according to legend, will one day to save the human race 
from eternal subjugation. Although initially dissuaded by a surprisingly 
domestic soothsayer (Gloria Foster), Neo manages to summon the 
fortitude necessary to defeat the artificial intelligence defense squad, 
with the help of John Woo-style martial arts ballet, Sam Peckinpah- 
inspired slow-motion gunfighting, and repeated self-affirmations.
What separates The Matrix from other virtual reality sci-fi fare are its 
epic pretensions, apocalyptic overtones, and breathtaking visuals. "Bullet 
Time" super slo-mo photography, wire-enhanced gymnastics, and kung 
fu fights choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping (Fist of Legend [1994], Black 
Mask [1996]) all raised the bar for Hollywood action sequences. One of 
the most fascinating things about the film is the manner in which it 
negotiates between progressive messages of nonconformity and self-
realization, and the generic imperatives of Hollywood's conservative 
studio system. As one critic wrote, "It's cruel, really, to put tantalizing 
ideas on the table and then ask the audience to be satisfied with a shoot-
out and a martial arts duel." Others praised the Wachowskis for beginning 
their film with an extended fight scene starring Trinity, only to note her 
relegation to "Neo's love interest" for the rest of the picture.
Such mixed messages reappear as narrative. Considering that what 
remains of postwar planet Earth is a bleak, inhospitable "desert of the 
real," and that the virtual world in which Neo grew up is not without 
advantages, it isn't clear what the human resistance hopes to gain by its 
struggles. Clearly such quandaries were not a turnoff for viewers.  SJS

extreme limit."

Digital technology has revolutionized filmmaking by making it more 
democratic and less expensive—the merits, fall-out from, and worthiness 
of that revolution can still be rigorously debated. What has so often been 
lacking in digital movies, though, is any sense of beauty or style, any eye 
for making movies. Even more, the "personal" films that have come out 
of the digital revolution have often been sophomoric and self-indulgent. 
Leave it to the mother of the French New Wave, Agnès Varda, to show all 
the upstarts how it should be done.
Unapologetically leftist in its politics, swerving from musings on life 
and mortality to the role of art in society, all while paying tribute to 
society's outcasts, The Gleaners and I is all over the map. Yet Varda doesn't 
let the film get away from her; the viewer never feels anything other than 
that they're in the passenger seat on an eye-opening journey that's being 
navigated by a master. There's a wonderful moment in the film in which 
Varda, picking overripe figs from a tree and eating them on the spot, 
launches a tirade about the greed of those who are both wealthy and 
selfish. Rather than spout threadbare Marxist theory, she simply observes, 
"They don't want to be nice." That raw truth resonates throughout the 
documentary, at the center of which are modern-day gleaners, people 
who salvage scraps after markets close, or pick through dumpsters to 
find food. Varda lets these marginalized people speak for themselves, 
and they eloquently address everything from world politics to personal 
tragedies, while the film shows that those two poles are not so far apart.
Tough questions of social inequity are smoothly juxtaposed against 
the salvelike qualities of art, and the necessity of finding beauty where 
you live. The result is a protest film that's part social critique, part 
travelogue, but always an unsentimental celebration of human resilience. 
Threaded throughout The Gleaners and I are Varda's musings on her own 
mortality. Rather than being pitying or sentimental, though, those 
moments capsulize the film's assertion that everyone who clears life's 
hurdles is an artist of sorts.  EH

In the Mood for Love takes place during the 1960s in a tiny and tightly 
packed tenement house in Hong Kong, where two neighbors spend so 
much time in close proximity that it's no wonder their lives ultimately 
cross. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung suspect that their respective 
spouses are having an affair, but they're not sure if they should follow 
suit with an affair of their own. Instead they meet for quiet meals and 
shy discussions, passing the time together as it dawns upon them that 
maybe they really are meant for each other.
However, director Wong, working as usual without a script, allows 
the tale of infidelity to play out in an oddly reserved and unpredictable 
manner. Where the viewer might sense simmering romance, Wong sees 
sad resignation. The two potential lovers cling near one another like 
satellites, but they seem to understand that they may never be able to 
share the same orbit. This is not unrequited love but resisted love, as 
Leung and Cheung struggle to stay apart even though they seem 
destined to be together. Wong choreographs this strange relationship 
with the grace and rhythm of a waltz. Working with his usual director of 
photography Christopher Doyle, he tracks the couple in slow motion as 
they pass each other on the tiny staircases, fret about the weather on 
the shadowy streets, and cryptically act out the kind of arguments they 
might have were they actually lovers. 
Once again Wong also makes brilliant use of music, in this case a Nat 
King Cole instrumental cue that grows in mysterious power the more 
the theme is replicated. Each scene is luminous, spilling over with 
carefully researched but understated period details captured in a 
dreamlike haze by an eavesdropping camera. Cheung, clad in a series of 
beautiful cheong-san dresses, is stunning, the perfect counterpart to 
the handsome and tasteful Leung, so in many ways you are rooting for 
the two to end up together. That they do not end up together doesn't 
come as a surprise, but the emotional power of their nonrelationship 
proves remarkably effective.  JKl

Hot off filming The Insider (1999), Russell Crowe lost forty pounds and 
built up his muscles to play thinking women's sex object Maximus, the 
Roman general turned gladiator, in Gladiator, Hollywood's first true 
Roman epic in over three decades. 
Exiled when his mentor, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), dies 
and is succeeded by his power-hungry son, Commodus (Joaquin 
Phoenix), Maximus, now in exile, trains as a gladiator and swears his 
revenge—understandable when you consider that Commodus not only 
kicked Maximus out of the bosom of Rome and tried to kill him, but also 
had his family murdered.
As you would expect from director Ridley Scott, the movie is epic not 
only in scale but also in imagery, as the majesty that was Rome is 
re-created superbly on screen (much praise is due here to Scott's 
cinematographer, John Mathieson). But Scott doesn't lose sight of the 
human side of the story amid the computer trickery, brilliantly staged 
battle sequences, and spectacular sets, delivering a fascinating, grisly, 
and heroic tale. With skilled actors, most notably Crowe, a wonderfully 
preening Phoenix and, in his final role, Oliver Reed, who sadly died 
during filming—his remaining scenes were generated using a stand-in 
and computer-enhanced filmwork. The film garnered five Oscars, 
including Best Actor in a Leading Role, for Russell Crowe.  JB

Kippur  Amos Gitai, 2000
Since his debut in the early 1980s with a series of documentaries that 
ran afoul of Israeli television, Amos Gitai has become known as Israel's 
most provocative filmmaker. Despite his courage and good instincts, his 
films can feel somewhat clumsy and inept at times—but not Kippur. In 
this haunting remembrance of things past, Gitai conjures up a shattering 
vision of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which he himself was seriously 
wounded. Two friends head for the Golan Heights to join up with their 
unit, but are deflected into a medical team that helicopters in to rescue 
the wounded. From the moment the reservists begin driving out of 
peacetime to the front lines, literally searching for the location of war, 
Gitai edges us into ever more lunar landscapes where time, flesh, and the 
very earth, are fatally susceptible to distortion and/or disintegration.
Kippur is less about a specific struggle than it is an evocation of the 
hallucinatory state of war: confusion, shock, numbing fatigue, constant 
cacophony. There's at least one sequence that is truly the stuff from 
which nightmares are made: A rescue team tries to carry away a seriously 
wounded soldier, only to have the body keep slipping off the stretcher. 
In one horrifying, gruesomely funny moment, Gitai makes us experience 
the impact of the war—personal and cosmic, realistic and surreal.  RP
Edward Yang's most accessible movie—and probably his best since A 
Brighter Summer Day (1991)—this 2000 feature follows three generations 
of a contemporary Taipei family from a wedding to a funeral, and 
although it takes almost three hours to unfold, not a single moment 
seems gratuitous.
Working once again with nonprofessional actors, Yang coaxes a 
standout performance from Wu Nien-jen—a substantial writer and 
director in his own right—as N.J., a middle-aged partner in a failing 
computer company who hopes to team up with a Japanese game 
designer, and who has a secret rendezvous in Tokyo with a woman (Ko 
Su-yun) he jilted thirty years earlier. Other major characters in Yi Yi include 
the hero's eight-year-old son (Jonathan Chang), teenage daughter (Kelly 
Lee), spiritually traumatized wife (Elaine Jin), comatose mother-in-law 
(Tang Ru-yun), and debt-ridden brother-in-law (Chen Hsi-sheng). The 
son—a comic and unsentimental marvel named Yang-Yang—becomes 
obsessed with photographing what people can't see, like the backs of 
their heads, because to him it's the half of reality that's missed. He may 
come closest to being a mouthpiece for Yang, who seems to miss nothing 
as he interweaves shifting viewpoints and poignant emotional refrains, 
creating one of the richest family portraits in modern cinema.  JRos

Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his acclaimed debut Pi (1998) is nothing 
short of remarkable. Requiem for a Dream follows four characters—Harry 
Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), girlfriend Marion 
(Jennifer Connelly), and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans)—through 
the nightmare world of drug addiction. Each has his or her own way of 
handling their addiction, and they all end up in different situations, but 
these addictions are all caused by the same thing, the failure of the 
American dream. For Aronofsky, the dream is dead and his film is a 
nightmarish mourning for its victims.
Visually, Requiem owes much to both Danny Boyle's Trainspotting 
(1996) and the films of Spike Lee; but unlike Boyle, whose own drug 
movie included sequences of hallucinogenic subjectivity, Aronofsky 
resists grounding the audience in any kind of objective position. The 
entire film is shot within this drug-addled subjective tense. And from 
Lee, Aronofsky takes a hyperkinetic visual sensibility used to represent 
a Brooklyn state of mind, though Requiem makes thematic use of these 
elements, rather than just employing them for surface style.
The acting is uniformly magnificent, with Leto, Connelly, and Wayans 
giving surprisingly strong performances. But it is Ellen Burstyn's role as 
Harry's diet-pill addicted mom that is nothing short of astonishing, and 
if one had to pick a single reason to see the film it would have to be for 
this performance. Although nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, Burstyn 
lost to Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich). No disrespect to either the film or 
Ms. Roberts, but come on! Roberts's performance was the best of her 
career, but the same can be said for Burstyn's Sara—and that's hardly a 
fair comparison.
But missing from this discussion—and the real reason to see Requiem 
for a Dream, beyond its intelligent ideas, amazing use of narcotic 
subjectivity, meaningful stylistics, and magnificent performances—is the 
film's remarkable balance of horror (the final sequences of drug madness 
are some of the scariest movie moments in recent years) and great Jewish 
comedy. Just imagine Woody Allen directing Naked Lunch.  MK

Burstyn's makeup included four

Quentin Tarantino had such a pronounced and immediate effect on 
American filmmakers that it was only a matter of time before his influence 
stretched into other countries. Amores Perros—which translates roughly to 
"Love's a Bitch"—shows that by 2000 the Tarantino model of stylish violence 
and jumbled narratives had made its way south of the U.S. border, to Mexico. 
Amores Perros marked the feature debut of Mexican director Alejandro 
Gonzalez Iñárritu, and if the film ultimately offers nothing particularly 
new, his vibrant filmmaking still manages to inject the somewhat familiar 
scenarios with energy, humor, intelligence, and warmth.
Shot as three interlocking stories whose central characters overlap 
at one key juncture, Amores Perros remains faithful to the canine theme 
of its title, as each segment of the film features a dog (or dogs) in a 
prominent role. In the first, a boy cheats with his brother's wife while 
entering his prized dog into grisly (and viscerally effective) fights, hoping 
to raise money so that he and his sister-in-law can run off together. In 
the second Edgar Allan Poe by way of Luis Buñuel segment, a vain, 
crippled supermodel loses her dog in the crawlspace beneath the 
floorboards of her apartment, and is tormented by the sounds of its 
incessant suffering as well as her inability to alleviate it. In the final 
segment, a hit-man seeks redemption for the life he has led and 
recognition from his estranged family.
All three segments ironically illustrate man's inhumanity to man via 
his treatment of animals, which incidentally fare so poorly in the film that 
Amores Perros infamously sports a prominent and preemptive disclaimer 
at its start noting that no animals were harmed during the making of the 
film. In fact, the frequent dog violence (and violence to dogs) is depicted 
so realistically that at times it does threaten to overwhelm the picture. 
But Iñárritu succeeds in delivering his message of bloody disloyalty, 
chilling dishonesty, and class disjunction with an abundance of style, 
revealing in the process a strong trust for the instincts of his actors as 
well as the intelligence of his audience.  JKl

Based on his brother Jonathan's story Memento Mori, British director 
Christopher Nolan's second feature is a near-perfect psychological puzzle. 
Known to movie buffs as "the film filmed backward," this modern film 
noir is told in stops and starts. Scenes appear in reverse chronological 
order then move forward again, presenting information that is useless 
until another parcel of the plot is supplied. An annoying gimmick in 
another director's hands, Nolan makes the chronological scene shifting 
an effective way to unfold what is essentially a misguided murder 
mystery where the hero may or may not know that his facts are not "the 
facts." Following a long tradition of memory loss within the film noir 
genre—Blue Dahlia (1945) and Suture (1993)—the main character's 
amnesia is yet another exciting factor within a film that has many.
Australian actor Guy Pearce stars as Leonard, a nervy and smug 
ex-insurance investigator. He wears nice suits and drives a nice car but 
stays in rundown motels, an indication of the self-imposed gumshoe he 
has become. Suffering from a rare form of amnesia (a real condition 
called anterograde amnesia, the inability to make new memories), 
Leonard keeps track of his actions through sticky notes and Polaroids, 
tattooing his body with the more important "truths" of the matter. His 
one aim is to avenge the rape and murder of his wife, a near-impossible 
task considering he has the slenderest of leads and can't remember 
anything from the immediate past. The people around him, bedmate 
Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or chirpy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), could be 
friends or could be the killer—he has no idea.
In virtually every scene, Pearce gives a compelling, nervy performance 
as the man who is haplessly fanatical about his mission yet so incapable 
of making the decisions he needs to make. How the threads of the story 
are unraveled and reorganized is an impressive feat of logic minding and 
script continuity. This technical ploy demands the audience's vigilance 
yet, in true film noir form, doesn't reward it. In the end, it is the way the 
tale is told that is memorable, not the story itself.  KK
Memento  Christopher Nolan, 2000
Anterograde amnesia can be caused 
by removing parts of the temporal 
lobe of the brain to treat epilepsy.

my actions still have 
meaning, even if I can't 
remember them."

Wo hu cang long  Ang Lee, 2000
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
Director Ang Lee has said that his intention with Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon was quite simply to make the best martial arts movie possible, 
and the artistic success and popularity of the end result indicates he 
achieved just that. Working from a script by his longtime collaborator 
James Schamus, Lee convened a cast of Asian action superstars who also 
possessed the requisite acting skills to deliver the story.
Lee also brought in famed fight choreographer Lee Wu-ping. Taking 
inspiration from the physicality of the Chinese theater, Wu-ping ignores 
the laws of physics by hoisting the actors up on wires so that they may 
fight on treetops, skip across water like stones, run up walls, and often 
clash in midair. For Western audiences perhaps unaccustomed to these 
aerial ballets, the sight of an opening foot chase over the rooftops of a 
village on a moonlit night proved immediately and irresistibly enticing.
Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeo, and relative newcomer Ziyo Zhang easily 
handle the supernatural physicality of their respective roles, but their 
acting never proves subservient to the impressive action scenes. In fact, 
one reason Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon became such a sensation was 
its attention to plot and character development, two rarities even in the 
most ambitious martial arts films,.
Chow Yun-fat plays a warrior in search of a stolen sword, the Green 
Dragon. Aided in his quest by Yeo, a former love interest, he discovers 
that the theft of the sword by Zhang Ziyo is connected to and clouded 
by longstanding issues of honor and revenge. For all the gravity-defying 
stunts and fitful bursts of violence, Lee keeps the focus firmly on the 
film's three central characters, whose philosophies on the utility of 
fighting and bloodshed have been shaped by their radically different 
experiences in life.
A strong feminist undercurrent also runs through the film, adding 
another layer of intelligence. The female characters fight for different 
reasons, but most of them seem to be fighting for respect in a man's 
world. The tiny Zhang, posing as a warrior, finds herself beset in a 
bustling way station by several unsavory fighters. Lee plays the inevitable 
thrashing of these few dozen would-be assailants for laughs, like a 
hyperkinetic variation on the old bar fight. But part of Zhang's passionate 
response seems to stem from simmering resentment, her understanding 
that were it known that she is female she would have been dismissed 
outright rather than respected (or feared) as a formidable opponent.
Lee modulates each scene of the movie with a similar nuance and 
sensitivity. His fight sequences play like psychological confrontations 
as much as sword fights, the clash of innocence and experience, of 
peace and anger. Even so, Lee leaves as much room for levity as he 
does or visual poetry, achieving a rare balance of thrills, beauty, humor, 
and smarts.  JKl

The Lord of the Rings  Peter Jackson, 2001, 2002, & 2003
Like J. R. R. Tolkien's original three-volume book, Peter Jackson's adaptation 
of The Lord of the Rings is best seen as a single—albeit very long—work. 
Watched back-to-back, the trilogy flows together almost seamlessly, from 
spectacular prologue to the suitably epic, record-setting closing credits.
But then, everything about this movie is record-setting, from how it 
was made (all three films were shot over a single sixteen-month period), 
to the extent of its eventual, incredible success. To date it has earned 
more than any other trilogy, even besting the Star Wars movies. By some 
estimates, the series has earned at least as much again on DVD sales; 
when you throw in merchandising, the GDP of Middle-Earth begins to 
rival that of actual countries. Remarkably, Jackson managed to astound 
not just the accountants but the critics as well. Each film topped scores 
of "best of" lists, and between them the three movies were nominated 
for a staggering thirty Academy Awards, and won seventeen. 
If you've seen the movies, it will come as no surprise that all three 
won Oscars for visual effects. They are filled with impressive beasts and 
battles, the scale of each escalating from movie to movie. Despite this, 
it is the tragic figure of Gollum that most captured audience imagination. 
Based on the motion-tracked performance and vocals of actor Andy 
Serkis, the Gollum on-screen was totally computer-generated, yet still 
totally believable as a real character.
It is perhaps this that encapsulates Jackson's greatest achievement: 
to remember that spectacle and technical wizardry aren't enough to 
make a great movie. Even though The Lord of the Rings trilogy is filled 
with hobbits, elves, and wizards, the characters in his films are all very 
human. Gollum has regrets, tries to be good, and teases the "fat hobbit" 
Sam. The wizard Gandalf, played to perfection by Sir Ian McKellen, is 
avuncular, even mischievous, yet always retains his undeniable power 
and authority. And the hobbits Frodo (a wide-eyed Elijah Wood) and Sam 
(Sean Astin) grow from brave but naive adventurers to true heroes. 
Almost as memorable as the characters is the scenery. The trilogy was 
shot in Jackson's native New Zealand, and little digital magic was required 
to create the stunning landscapes. One of the most memorable scenes 
from the spectacle-laden final movie is the lighting of the beacons; 
as the music soars, the camera simply tracks from mountaintop to 
mountaintop as signal fires flare up against the sky, and it is stunning. 
It is remarkable that Jackson, with his scriptwriting partners Fran 
Walsh and Phillippa Boyens, managed to wrestle a dense and unwieldy 
mass of source material into a swift and engaging narrative. (Even more 
remarkable is the fact most hard-core fans of the book also loved the 
movie.) In a brief but dramatic prologue, we learn that long ago, the 
über-evil Sauron invested all his power into a ring, only to lose it in an 
epic battle against a coalition of elves and men. The ring eventually finds 
its way to the diminutive hobbit, Frodo Baggins. It is here that the story

"When you're eighteen 
years old and a photo 
engraving apprentice 
you can't possibly 
imagine you're going 
to be making The Lord 
of the Rings one day. 
I thought, wow, this will 
make a great film, I can't 
wait until somebody else 
makes it. I never ever 
dreamt it would be me."
Peter Jackson, 2003
The Return of the King won eleven 
Oscars—a tally equaled only by 
Ben Hur (1959) and Titanic (1997).
proper begins. Frodo agrees to destroy the ring, and so Sauron, once and 
for all. However, this can only be done by throwing it into the volcanic 
heart of Mt. Doom, which lies deep in enemy territory. He sets off on his 
long and dangerous journey with a fellowship of concerned hobbits, 
elves, dwarves, and men, including the wizard Gandalf and the mysterious 
Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). Betrayals, battles, and bloodshed ensue; the 
fellowship ultimately splits, as Frodo and Sam (and eventually Gollum) 
make their way to the volcano by themselves, while the remainder 
prepare to take on Sauron in a final Middle Earth-shattering showdown.
Despite the vast canvas upon which Jackson was painting, at its heart 
his film is about people, their relationships, and the decisions they make. 
Friendship and self-sacrifice figure strongly, as does a sense of mortality; 
the final scenes make it clear that victory can be noble, and yet still come 
at too deep a personal cost. Tolkein spent time in the trenches during 
World War I, and it is hard not to draw parallels between his experiences 
and the tone of melancholy that surrounds the trilogy's conclusion. For 
many, the heart of the film lies not with a big action scene, but in a quiet 
moment when Gandalf comforts Frodo, who despairs that he was born 
to see such terrible events. "So do all who live to see such times," Gandalf 
says. "But that is not for us to decide. All we have to decide is what to do 
with the time that is given to us." It is moments like this that elevate 
Jackson's film from movie blockbuster to genuine masterpiece.  PH

Sen to chihiro no kamikakushi  
Spirited Away  Hayao Miyazaki, 2001
With every film that he makes, Hayao Miyazaki sets the standard for 
animated features ever higher. Yet he holds such a singular vision that 
it's hard to tell where to place him on the pantheon. He isn't a throwback 
to the past, because no one in the past made movies quite like Miyazaki's. 
And he certainly isn't a precursor of things to come, because it's hard to 
imagine anybody but Miyazaki doing what he does. He is one of a kind, 
and as such, his films hold a special place in the heart of movie lovers.
This is especially true in his native Japan, where each of his features 
exceeds the box office tally of its predecessor, with many of them 
eclipsing the take of even the most prominent Hollywood blockbusters. 
This is because Miyazaki creates fantastic worlds somehow free from 
the cloying characters and patronizing tone of so many mainstream 
animated features. Not surprisingly, his unfailingly intelligent films 
appeal to both children and adults, simple enough for the former to 
enjoy yet complex enough for the latter to appreciate on a different level.
The shy and nervous Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase in the English-
language version) and her parents are on their way to their new home 
when they take a detour through a strange tunnel. When they emerge 
on the other side, they discover a seemingly deserted town, but things 
aren't what they seem. Chihiro's parents gorge themselves on food and 
magically transform into a pair of pigs, and that's when Chihiro realizes 
they're not alone. When night falls, the town becomes populated with 
spirits, and Chihiro must overcome her fears to rescue her parents and 
find their way home. Guided by a more benevolent spirit named Haku 
(Jason Marsden), Chihiro sneaks her way into the inner workings of the 
town, where she discovers a witch named Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) 
who runs the spirit city like a booming business with an elaborate spa 
resort as its main draw. It's only by ingratiating herself to the enigmatic 
crone and her unpredictable cronies that Chihiro can hope to escape.
Spirited Away is in many ways Miyazaki's Alice in Wonderland. The 
writer-director's hand-drawn scenes burst with energy and invention, 
and Miyazaki takes full advantage of the fantastical story to devise 
dozens of unique spirits and creatures that roam this world of utterly 
inscrutable rules and impenetrable logic. Giant babies throw destructive 
temper tantrums. Evil spirits offer gifts of gold as bait before devouring 
everything in sight. Characters change shapes (and sometimes 
personalities) with no warning—one appears alternately as a boy, a 
dragon, and a river spirit. Chihiro reacts to each of these creatures first 
with confusion, then with fear, and ultimately with courage. She soon 
realizes that she must master this strange world if she ever hopes to get 
home, and just as the spirits she encounters change her outlook on life, 
so does Chihiro affect the behavior of the spirits. She's a stranger in a 
strange land whose denizens consider her the strangest of them all.  JKl
"It's not me who makes 
the film. The film makes 
itself, and I have no 
choice but to follow."
Hayao Miyazaki, 2002
Spirited Away was the first anime

No Man's Land  Danis Tanovic, 2001
895
A warrior's term associated with World War I, "no-man's-land" connotes 
the uninhabitable kill zone between opposing forces. Danis Tanovic's No 
Man's Land complicates the term with an absurdist drama set in the 
Balkans, designed around a "Mexican standoff."
It is 1993 and a relief platoon of Bosnian soldiers gets lost in the night 
on its way to the front. Ambushed by a Serbian patrol, the group is 
decimated, save for two of its number. Chiki (Branko Djuric) suffers a 
glancing bullet wound before finding the safety of trenches, and his 
friend Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is knocked unconscious. Sent to survey the 
trench, a Serbian veteran and his new partner Nino (Rene Bitorajac) set 
a mine beneath Cera's body, just before Chiki kills the veteran. When Cera 
wakes up, unable to move, the three are forced to cooperate to survive 
because they're equally cut off from both sides' rear guard and leadership. 
Tanovic's film is a riveting portrait of military purposes run amuck at 
the very point of conflict. Chiki, Nino, and Cera bear the ravages of a 
much greater agenda, namely the combination of religious, political, 
ethnic, but most of all, nationalist impulses. No Man's Land is a bleak affair, 
indeed, but a meaningful cinematic experience can be found in its dark, 
dark comedy of errors wherein forthright patriots festoon one another 
on the symbolic bayonets of their rifles.  GC-Q
Gangs of New York  Martin Scorsese, 2002
Opening on a set that might not look out of place on stage at the 
New York Met, Gangs of New York could have been an opera. Leonardo 
DiCaprio is Amsterdam Vallon, vying to avenge his father, killed by lower 
Manhattan's now undisputed king, Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). He 
earns the trust of Bill, who views him as a like-minded soul, until Bill finds 
out his real identity—thus paving the way for a fight to the death.
Scorsese's loose adaptation of Herbert Asbury's 1929 account of the 
low-lifes, criminals, and gangs in nineteenth-century New York makes 
up in energy what it loses in subtlety. Compare it to the eloquence and 
stateliness of the director's 1993 adaptation of Edith Wharton's The Age 
of Innocence: Though the stories are separated by mere decades, they 
don't seem to occupy the same universe, let alone the same streets.
Day-Lewis dominates, chewing lines and scenery with gusto, while 
DiCaprio looks uneasy. Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Jim Broadbent, 
and John C. Reilly make the most of their roles, while Cameron Diaz 
suffers in the only significant female role. Dante Ferretti's designs are a 
sight to behold. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is crisp. And Thelma 
Schoonmaker's editing carries us along at a fair pace, while Scorsese's 
camera swoops and dives as it explores this barbaric world. It is a bold 
and ambitious film in an age when such enterprises are all too rare.  IHS

Russian Ark is a work of vaunting ambition. Set amid St. Petersburg's 
Hermitage Museum, the film offers an impressionistic portrait of the city's 
300-year history. The narrator is a French nobleman played by Sergei 
Donstov, who guides us through the museum's rooms and galleries, with 
director Aleksandr Sokurov bringing to life fragments of St. Petersburg's 
eventful past. Floating in and out of scenes involving Catherine the Great 
and Tsar Nicholas I, and telling of the city's terrible suffering during World 
War II, the film transforms into a phantasmogorical tour of Russian history. 
But what really makes this dreamy mix of allegory and politics so 
memorable is the director's visual approach. Pushing the envelope of 
digital technology, the entire drama unravels in a single unbroken take. 
It was a huge challenge, requiring 2,000 extras (all in period costume) 
and unfolding across thirty galleries, hallways, and rooms. Technical 
problems interrupted the first two attempts, but Sokurov got the shot 
he wanted on his third take—just as well, as there wasn't time for any 
more. The results are breathtaking: Sokurov's fluid camerawork evokes 
the continuity and flow of history like no other film. The result is one of 
the great technical achievements of modern cinema.  EL

The film that launched Michael Moore's career internationally, as well 
as winning him an Oscar, Bowling for Columbine also showed that 
documentary filmmaking could be commercially successful. It placed 
America's predilection for gun ownership under the microscope, linking 
it to the escalation of violence within the country. In particular, the 
film focuses on the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, when two 
students went on a murderous rampage before committing suicide. 
Adopting a style that his critics argue removes him from any claim to 
being a documentary filmmaker, Moore's subjectivity is never masked. 
His moral crusade runs the gamut, from ambushing the National Rifle 
Association president Charlton Heston to visiting the headquarters of 
Kmart with survivors of the Columbine shooting, to demand a refund on 
the bullets that remain lodged in the victim's bodies, which the two 
killers purchased from the store. Such actions saw results: Kmart would 
ultimately revise their sales policy for handgun ammunition.
Although the goal of the film was to hold America accountable 
regarding its stance on gun ownership, the sentiment was lost on some 
because of Moore's didactic approach. Nevertheless, it is impossible to 
deny the power of Bowling for Columbine's thesis. Sadly, mass shootings 
since have shown that Moore's film ultimately failed to do little more 
than send ripples across the surface of the American psyche.  JT

897
There are films that capture the zeitgeist perfectly; there are films that 
give a peek at, if not a warning of, the world to come. City of God does 
both with aplomb. With its dizzying pace, fast edits, handheld camera, 
quick-shift changes in point of view, and obvious nods to Quentin 
Tarantino, the film is clearly rooted in both the tone and tempo of late 
twentieth/early twenty-first century American filmmaking.
At its core, City of God is about the devolution of a Brazilian housing 
project that is tracked from its relatively idyllic 1960s beginnings to its 
1980s destination as a violent, poverty-ridden domain where each 
successive generation becomes less connected to the human traits of 
empathy, conscience, and hope. Based on a true story, City of God is 
narrated by the teenage Buscape (Alexandre Rodrigues), whose gentle 
disposition prevents him from becoming a gangster, but whose artistic 
bent leads him to become a celebrated photographer/documentarian 
of his surroundings. If there's a lead in the ensemble of motley characters 
(the cast is composed of non-actors, real-life street kids) and intertwined 
storylines, it's the hyper-violent Lil' Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora), whose 
propensity for violence and complete lack of remorse make him a 
terrifying figure. It is the open-ended final minutes, in which a generation 
of almost feral homeless kids take over the projects, that makes the film's 
point crystal clear: This is a horror movie of the first order.  EH

Hable con ella  Pedro Almodóvar, 2002
Talk to Her
Talk to Her provides a counterpoint to the human warmth and emotional 
messiness of Pedro Almodóvar's joyously cathartic previous film, All 
About My Mother (1999). Although it retains some of the Day-Glo 
appearances of the director's earlier, more vibrant work, Talk to Her is his 
most controlled and sustained picture. It is also his most melancholy 
and disconcerting film, especially in its treatment—or "silencing"—of 
women. Whereas Almodóvar's films generally embrace the untidiness 
of life and cinema, Talk to Her is elegant and even classical in its structure, 
with various motifs connecting across it. 
Most of Almodóvar's previous films focus on female characters and 
their complex interactions with each other and the world around them. 
Talk to Her concentrates on its male protagonists and their increasingly 
insular dialogues with the women "in" their lives—both of whom end up 
in comas. One of the most remarkable aspects of Almodóvar's film is the 
way in which he subtly manipulates and directs the audience, shifting 
emphasis away from the more disturbing connotations of the actions 
the picture represents. In what may be the boldest move in the director's 
cinema, he "shows" a rape through a deft parody of a silent surrealist film 
called The Shrinking Lover. The most significant achievement of Talk to 
Her lies in the ways in which it plays with and challenges audience 
identification. It is a profound meditation on the way in which we talk to 
and through the people, objects, and texts that express our lives.  AD

Elephant  Gus Van Sant, 2003
899
Gus Van Sant's career has run the gamut, from indie features to Oscar 
winners. After the critical drubbing of his shot-for-shot remake of Psycho 
(1998) and the creative nadir of Finding Forrester (2000), Van Sant chose 
a radical new minimalist direction. Following Gerry (2002), he found the 
perfect balance between subject and style in Elephant. 
How do you convey the horror that unfolded at the Columbine High 
School on April 20, 1999? Van Sant's film eschews realism; at least, it 
refuses a blow-by-blow account of what happened. He also steers clear 
of specifics by suggesting the setting could be anywhere. The film is 
glacial in detailing the banality of a normal school day. In one sequence, 
we follow a student from the playing fields and into a class, to the strains 
of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata." It is beautiful yet unsettling. 
Van Sant's camera maintains an emotional distance. Then the killers 
arrive and the tone shifts toward terror, accentuated by the directorial 
style. There is no simple answer for their actions, but we are given a 
sense of how they reached their decision. It makes Elephant one of the 
key American films of the last decade—a coruscating appraisal of the 
numbing effect of modern life upon a younger generation.  IHS
Aileen Wuornos: The Life and Death of a 
Serial Killer  Nick Broomfield & Joan Churchill, 2003
A project that began ten years earlier with Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of 
a Serial Killer (1993), Broomfield and Churchill's follow-up is a powerful 
and profound statement against the death penalty, and raises disturbing 
questions about executing the mentally incapacitated.
Broomfield's first film focused on Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute charged 
with murdering seven of her clients (despite strong evidence to suggest 
that she acted in self-defense in at least one of the cases). After Aileen was 
coerced into entering a plea of no-contest by Arlene Pralle (a born-again 
Christian and her adoptive mother) and Steve Glazer (an inexperienced 
lawyer in charge of her defense), multiple death sentences soon followed. 
Having kept in touch with Wuornos in the intervening years, 
Broomfield found himself subpoenaed to appear at Aileen's final appeal. 
Announcing that she had in fact killed all the men in cold blood, Aileen 
was sped toward her execution. Broomfield's resulting film examines her 
wretched childhood, which was filled with unrelenting abuse and 
violence that continued into her years as a hitchhiking prostitute. In an 
unguarded moment Aileen admits that she acted in self-defense, but 
wishes to die to escape the tortuous conditions imposed by Death Row. 
A resolutely non-sensationalist work, Aileen Wuornos calls to account 
the travesties of the American justice system and provides a sympathetic 
insight into a deeply troubled soul.  JWo

Mysticism, poetry, school days, and a futuristic bedroom are only some 
of the wonders found in Oldboy. A thriller that hinges on oedipal taboos 
and blind destiny, hypnotism, and fate, this breakthrough film—part 
action, part drama, part psychological thriller—has introduced Korean 
cinema to more viewers than any other film. The story is more direct and 
compelling than director Park Chan-wook's popular previous film, 
Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), and features an explosive beginning. 
A man is imprisoned for fifteen years without an explanation. Upon 
escape, he must find his kidnapper in only five days. 
This violent, elegiac masterpiece is based on a Japanese manga cartoon 
by Garon Tsuchiya. Actor Min-sik Choi, who performed his own stunts, 
trained rigorously for his role as hapless kidnap victim Dae-su, a man who 
tries to escape his windowless prison by ingeniously digging through a 
skyscraper wall into thin air but is released before he can try his tunnel. 
Once free, he vows revenge, Monte Cristo-style, against the kidnapper 
who has effectively robbed him of his daughter, his wife, and his life. Now 
a ragged fighting machine who resembles a Korean Charles Bronson in 
a fright wig, Dae-su is befriended by a beautiful sushi chef (Hye-jeong 
Kang) whom he engages by eating a live squid and then passing out on 
the counter. Such is the knockdown, drag-out style of Oldboy. However 
complex the tale, it is underpinned by a logic that unfolds clearly, easily 
incorporating the film's various flashbacks. Progressing at a pace that 
sometimes leaves one breathless but also leaves room for thought, Oldboy's 
choreographed fight scenes are both innovative and surprising—and all 
of the violence serves the plot. Despite its brutality, it is ultimately a black 
comedy that deftly rolls elements of mob thriller and vengeance mystery 
into one. After winning the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004, the director 
stunned the audience by thanking the cast and crew, then thanking the 
four squid who gave up their lives for the vivid sushi bar scene.  KK

Although it seems like ancient history—the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 
East and West Germans thronging the streets, and those hilarious 
Trabants heralding the reunification of Germany—it all happened 
in only 1989. This coming together of two nations brought many things 
to the German people, but Wolfgang Becker's Good Bye Lenin! showed 
that among the pain, angst, and unemployment there was also a lot 
of humor. Good Bye Lenin! is set in East Germany, just before the Wall 
came down. 
Alex (Daniel Brühl) is a personable young man whose mother (Katrin 
Saß) is a politically active fighter for the East German socialist future. 
When she sees Alex arrested at a riot, she collapses and goes into a coma, 
which lasts right through until the early days of reunification. Alex is 
told by his mother's doctor that any shock could kill her, and he reasons 
that the end of communism and the disappearance of the German 
Democratic Republic might count as just such a fatal surprise. Alex 
decides on a simple plan—he will re-create the old East Germany for his 
mother. In a touching and funny series of moments, Alex manages to 
convince his bedridden mother that the old order has survived. Pioneer 
Scouts visit her to sing socialist anthems. Alex becomes an expert at 
sourcing vile and now-unavailable East German foodstuffs, and, in one 
of the film's highlights, actually re-creates her favorite news programs. 
Good Bye Lenin! also manages levels of poignancy. It doesn't for 
one moment suggest that East Germany was a nice place to live, but it 
does show what has been lost in the new capitalist wave, as socialist 
ideals vanish and are replaced by hard cash and commerce. As the film 
progresses, a different, equally edgy reunification takes place as Alex's 
father—once an escapee from the East, now just another German—
appears again, and we see that Alex's obsession with protecting his 
mother from reality is in some ways a way of protecting himself from 
other, less comfortable realities.  KK

Osama  Siddiq Barmak, 2003
A chilling account of life for a young girl under the Taliban's rule in 
Afghanistan, Osama features a cast of local non-actors and was shot in 
Kabul shortly after the arrival of American and allied troops in June 2002. 
A family of women whose men have all been killed in conflicts decide to 
dress up a young girl as a boy, in order for her to make a living. Only the 
milkman who employs her and the girl's friend, who names her Osama, 
know her real identity. Things become difficult when all young boys are 
recruited for military training. Part of their routine involves learning how 
to conduct ablutions. Osama's teacher becomes suspicious of her reserve, 
which is her undoing. Though escaping execution, her hellish fate is 
arguably worse, imposed by an oppressive, violently misogynistic regime.
One of the first films to be made in Afghanistan following the fall of 
the Taliban, Osama is an important and disturbing work. The film's end 
is a damning indictment of a society in which women were subjugated 
to a brutalized form of domestic slavery. The rights and wrongs over the 
response of America and its supporters to the September 11, 2001 
attacks are still being debated, but, as this film shows, there is no doubt 
that the Taliban should have been removed from power.  IHS
It has been called, a little crudely, the "nuts in love" genre: two mentally 
disabled, drug-addicted, or alcoholic people whose sudden, explosive 
encounter and subsequent relationship adds up to a true tale of 
surrealist-style amour fou. It is a very modern genre, one that passes 
through Robert Rossen's Lilith (1964) and the Australian film Angel 
Baby (1995)—but Fatih Akin's Head-On stirs a particularly potent brew 
by adding extra ingredients to the formula. First, the union starts on a 
decidedly mock, non-fou note, as a marriage of convenience between 
two people on the bottom rung of society: Cahit (Birol Ünel) has smashed 
his car; Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) has slashed her wrists. Yet, as Sibel asserts her 
desires by prowling the local clubs and bars, Cahit becomes increasingly 
jealous and violent—and then love, in however perverse or clumsy a 
way, asserts itself. Second, Akin complicates everything by making this 
the story of Turkish immigrants in Germany, suffering racism and abuse 
in the course of their negotiation of two very different cultures.
Yet Head-On is not, in any strict sense, a "social realist" film. A nervy, 
unsettling, sometimes bleak drama of two outsiders (vividly played, with 
unwavering intensity and conviction, by the two leads), the film in 
fact continues a vital strand of provocative, post-punk creativity in 
contemporary European cinema—a vitality from which even Akin's 
subsequent films have shied away.  AM

Consequences won five David di 
Donatello awards, including Best 
Film, Best Director, and Best Actor.
i
Paolo Sorrentino's breakthrough feature, The Consequences of Love, was 
inspired by the ritualistic behavior of a businessman encountered by the 
director while visiting Sao Paolo. It was also influenced by his desire to 
show a different perspective of the mafia, representing its ferocity as well 
as its mechanisms and rules. It established Sorrentino as a supreme visual 
stylist and a significant voice in contemporary European cinema. 
A former stockbroker from Southern Italy, Titta di Girolamo (Toni 
Servillo) resides in an anonymous hotel in a Swiss-Italian town. He seems 
to be a man without identity and with little to do, spending his time 
smoking and coldly observing the hotel's denizens, particularly the 
beautiful barmaid Sofia (Olivia Magnani). Girolamo once lost money 
owned by the mafia on the stock market and has been punished in a 
gruesome way: He is to deliver the mafia's money to the bank once a week 
and is allowed no life for himself. But as he becomes growingly aware of 
Sofia's presence, his neatly organized world turns upside down.
A quietly gripping psychological thriller, Consequences also offers a 
potent mediation on the discovery of love. Toni Servillo gives a masterly 
performance, and Luca Bigazzi's crisply composed cinematography 
vividly maps out the empty spaces of Girolamo's self-enclosed world. 
The inventive use of music is highly atmospheric, suggesting the welter 
of emotion that lurks beneath Girolamo's icy surface.  JWo

Moolaadé  Ousmane Sembene, 2004
Senegalese-born director Ousmane Sembene never shrank from tackling 
taboos—and in his final film, Moolaadé, he took on one of the most 
sensitive: the widely practiced custom of female genital mutilation. 
Sembene's films are subtle and ambivalent, acknowledging the 
value of traditions and regretting their erosion while still exposing the 
system of oppression and injustice they often upheld. His heroine, the 
formidable Mama Collé (Fatoumata Coulibaly), can turn tradition to her 
own ends. When four village girls who have fled the cutting ceremony 
come begging for refuge, she grants them impregnable sanctuary simply 
by stringing a cord across the entrance to her courtyard. This flimsy 
barrier is the moolaadé (protection) of the title. 
Solemnity rarely taints Sembene's films; his anger and indignation are 
tempered by his warmth, humor, and generosity of spirit. The opening 
of Moolaadé shows his affectionate, intimate view of African village life 
at its warmest, offering a useful corrective to Western ideas of Africa as a 
starved, helpless continent, devoid of dignity and self-sufficiency. The 
film's climax is perhaps its weakest point, but the sheer liberating 
exhilaration of Sembene's ending is all but impossible to resist.   PK

A fair amount of critical hand-wringing attended the American opening 
of Downfall, the first German movie to portray Adolf Hitler in a 
conventional narrative. There was concern that the film—a fast-paced, 
doggedly straightforward account of the final days of Hitler (Bruno Ganz) 
and his inner circle—humanizes the Third Reich and its delusional 
draftsmen and thereby plays down their ghastly deeds. Hitler, Eva Braun 
(Juliane Köhler), Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes), and the rest are 
assuredly human here; but the point is that the truly monstrous usually 
are. And so we are left with an uncomfortable feeling of familiarity as we 
watch the various factions of the winding-down Nazi machine work 
utterly at cross-purposes, as the psychopath-romantic who was once at 
its hub raves, cajoles, rationalizes, and bemoans the failure of his sci-fi 
utopia—while disavowing his part in the annihilation of a culture. 
This disorienting matter-of-factness is the key to Downfall's brilliance. 
Hitler is routinely pushed to the edge of the frame by Oliver Hirschbiegel's 
camera and Ganz's grandly withered performance. Meanwhile, other 
modes of behavior are allowed to surface via the surrounding characters: 
compassion, pity, bravery, avarice, careerism, and, in the case of the 
German people Hitler despises, bewildering devotion. This fascinating, 
subtly radical exegesis of how empires crumble from within reveals the 
many ways in which they had it coming.  MH

After several years of promise, South African cinema seemed poised for 
a breakthrough. Tsotsi duly became the country's first offering to win an 
Academy Award for Foreign Language Film. As often is the case with 
emergent cinemas, it plucks its story from the city streets and tells it 
in a realist style with non-professional or untried actors. The Tsotsi of 
the title (Presley Chweneyagae), is a small-time hoodlum who, with 
three hangers-on, commits the mugging of a middle-aged businessman 
on a train. In the course of the robbery, he stabs and kills the man. Back 
in the shantytown where they live, one of the gang is overcome with 
remorse—but Tsotsi despises him for his weakness and gives him a 
beating. Now working on his own, he hijacks the car of a wealthy 
woman, wounding her in the process. Then, having made his escape, 
Tsotsi discovers the woman's baby in the back of the car. 
Tsotsi's instinct is to abandon the child, but something prevents him 
from doing so. He takes it back to his shack and tries to feed and care for 
it. But the child needs milk, and so Tsotsi forces a young single mother 
in a neighboring shack to breast-feed it. Miriam (Terry Pheto) cares for 
the child and tries to persuade Tsotsi to return it to its mother. At last, 
having failed to defend himself to Miriam, Tsotsi is forced to confront 
the nature of his life and the direction it is taking.
Chweneyagae and Pheto give remarkable performances in a film 
that powerfully conveys the brutality and squalor of the urban slums of 
Johannesburg—while maintaining a strong belief in the human spirit, 
which resists being crushed under the oppressive weight of poverty. 
If at times the direction seems overly theatrical—with heavy pauses 
while we absorb the significance of a scene—this is a small price to pay 
for the film's powerful insights.  EB

Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain got a lot of attention for being one of the 
first gay Westerns to hit mainstream theaters. In fact, Andy Warhol 
had hit the mark more than three decades earlier with his pioneering 
Lonesome Cowboys (1969), which was shot on location at Old Tucson 
Studios in Arizona. But while Warhol's film was a genre spoof, Lee's 
work is deadly serious, and directed with an air of precision and solid 
craftsmanship that harks back to the Westerns of Budd Boetticher, John 
Ford, and Howard Hawks.
Working from a screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, 
Lee's film tells the tale of Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist 
(Jake Gyllenhaal). While working on a lonesome job watching sheep in 
the back country of Wyoming in the summer of 1963, they meet and fall 
in love. At first, the two are simply buddies at home on the range—but, 
as the summer wears on, their relationship deepens into what will 
become a lifelong love affair; albeit one that is resolutely forbidden by 
contemporary society, and mediated by failed marriages that neither 
man really cares about. While Gyllenhaal does excellent work in his role, 
Ledger is a revelation. Taciturn, shy, and keeping his own counsel, he 
hides his emotions behind a rough exterior of macho horseplay.  His 
untimely death in 2008 at the age of twenty-eight lends an even greater 
poignancy to his performance. Lee's camerawork brings out the beauty 
and the harshness of the landscape, and the supporting cast—including 
Randy Quaid, Anne Hathaway, and Michelle Williams—back up the two 
leads with impeccably timed performances.
"Blending the macho western genre, western life, with a gay love 
story... that's hard to do," observed Ang Lee. Nonetheless, Brokeback 
Mountain was an instant classic, that altered the conventions of the 
Western to tell a wholly convincing love story that resonated in the mind 
long after the last image had faded. And one that is heartbreaking, 
honest, and refreshingly matter-of-fact about its subject matter.  WWD

Pan's Labyrinth is something of a summative film from Mexican director 
Guillermo del Toro. Having worked on projects that offered a high level 
of special effects, such as Hellboy (2004), as well as those that created an 
unnervingly otherworldly atmosphere (for example, 2001's The Devil's 
Backbone), here, in perhaps his most mature picture, the director brings 
the two strands together. The result is a film that is both eerie and built 
around effects technology (hence its three visual-related Oscars). 
Set in 1944, Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of Ofelia, a young girl who 
discovers a fantastical world of woodland creatures when her mother 
takes her to northern Spain to join her stepfather, a brutish and bitter 
member of General Franco's Fascist army. Del Toro gathers together a 
roster of top-line Spanish actors, including Sergi López, Ariadna Gil, and 
Maribel Verdú, alongside Ivana Baquero as the young girl. 
Set against a backdrop of post-civil war Spain, the film's startling 
beauty and the strength of its performances offer much to admire. 
"Shooting Pan's Labyrinth was very painful," del Toro told Sight & Sound, 
"but it also became a war about me not compromising. I gave back my 
entire salary in order to get the film made the way I wanted it." If the story 
fails to fully unite the reality and fantasy elements—Pan's Labyrinth 
remains two outstanding halves rather than one spectacular whole—this 
does not make del Toro's accomplishment any less extraordinary.  AW

Das Leben der Anderen  
The Lives of Others
Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, 2006
By turns horrifying and humorous, The Lives of Others is debut director 
von Donnersmarck's story of the East German government's obsession 
with tracking the populace's every move.
It's 1984 and "glasnost is nowhere in sight" as Stasi hardliner Captain 
Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) decides to keep playwright Georg Dreyman 
(Sebastian Koch) under surveillance. When a bug planted in his Berlin 
apartment reveals the writer genuinely believes in the socialist state, 
Wiesler grows fascinated by Dreyman's life with his lover Christa-Maria 
(Martina Gedeck). Things are further complicated when his superior—
culture minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme)—fancies Christa-Maria for 
himself and instructs Wiesler to clear the way by framing Dreyman. 
Pushed out of the comfort zone of government-sanctioned spying, 
Wiesler is shunted in directions with which he is profoundly unfamiliar. 
The callousness of Cold War East Germany is chillingly conveyed, but 
when events threaten to grow overwhelmingly dark, von Donnersmarck 
reins back with a dose of black humor. A Kafkaesque spin on Francis Ford 
Coppola's The Conversation (1974), this was a deserved Oscar winner.  TE

Paranormal Activity is proof positive that you do not need a huge budget 
to make a terrifying and wildly profitable film (to date, it is the most 
profitable movie of all time). You just need someone with true 
imagination. That someone is Oren Peli, a first-time filmmaker who shot 
the film in his own home for around $15,000.
The story is simple yet riveting. Young couple Katie (Katie Featherston) 
and Micah (Micah Sloat) realize something weird is happening in their 
new home and set up a camera to record what happens while they sleep. 
For the first few nights, the camera records almost nothing: a door moves, 
the blankets flutter. We are lulled into a false sense of security, so that 
when chandeliers start swinging and Ouija boards ignite, the impact is 
genuinely shocking. The night-vision scope through which most of the 
movie is seen adds an interesting depth. With no color to distract, our 
eyes are drawn immediately to even the slightest movement. 
Peli submitted Paranormal Activity to Screamfest 2007, at Mann's 
Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It was the hit of the festival, and bloggers 
immediately began writing about it. It was bought by Dreamworks/
Paramount, originally with the intention of turning it into a big-budget 
movie. The studio realized, however, that a Hollywood movie would 
never be able to beat the suspense of the film Peli had made at home. 
Anybody who likes being scared silly will love Paranormal Activity.  CP

Paul Thomas Anderson grew up on the fringes of show business and 
Hollywood. There Will Be Blood, his excoriating study of greed—and 
the both constructive and destructive powers of competitiveness and 
ambition—is a stunning achievement by the still-young writer-director. 
Using Upton Sinclair's satirical 1927 novel Oil! as a jumping-off point, 
Anderson creates a dark tale of a prospector seemingly without a single 
redemptive characteristic. Concentrating on long, almost silent passages 
and huge panoramas, There Will Be Blood delves to the painful depths of 
a man who, by many measures, would have been considered both a 
success and a genius, but in Anderson's hands is a charismatic sociopath.
The notoriously selective and methodical Daniel Day-Lewis gives an 
indelible performance as antihero Daniel Plainview—who turns nature's 
resources into his own bounty, regardless of the cost to him and the 
world. The picture provided 2007 audiences with a painfully resonant 
condemnation of so much that was then hurting America and the world: 
oil-based greed and violence, the madness behind such aggression, the 
corruption of religious fervor, the paranoia behind much foreign policy, 
and the betrayal of our children by capitalism. But instead of couching 
these themes in the overt terms of the "Iraq War pictures" of the time, 
Anderson makes an intimate yet epic period piece set around another 
boom-or-bust era, and evokes the universal truths behind his story.  JP

The Hurt Locker is Kathryn Bigelow's greatest film yet. Like the following 
year's District 9, Inglourious Basterds, and Avatar (by Bigelow's ex-husband 
and ex-collaborator James Cameron), it taps back into the sentiment of 
the "good war" that audiences clearly craved after an onslaught of dreary 
films such as Rendition (2007), Stop Loss (2008), and Lions for Lambs 
(2007): "unjustified war" stories that had kept theaters empty for years. 
In 2010, Bigelow made history as the first female director ever to win an 
Oscar—only three female directors had previously been nominated.
Her fascination with violence and our relationships to it (audience 
and characters alike) here gets its most distilled and most visceral 
treatment. Action in movies excites, she has always proclaimed, and the 
lives of the violent, who choose to live with danger, are the most worthy 
of her attention. With the steady hand of screenwriter and ex-journalist 
Mark Boal, she creates almost unbearable suspense, with Jeremy Renner 
in an Oscar-nominated turn as Staff Sergeant William James. 
Set during the Iraq War, The Hurt Locker skillfully pulls us into the 
chaos of an elite U.S. bomb deactivation unit by concentrating on 
authenticity and character, while avoiding politics and polemics. Through 
escalating set pieces and dollops of personal information, Bigelow 
presents not the nature of war, but rather the nature of the warrior. 
The soldiers' compulsions for danger, heroics, mental and physical 
challenge, and glory are what make them seem damaged in peacetime, 
but it is these very addictions that fill them with a terrible absoluteness 
during conflict. War may be hell, but it's the closest thing to heaven for 
William James. Renner is ably assisted by Anthony Mackie as J. T. Sanborn, 
Brian Geraghty as Owen Eldridge, and Guy Pearce as Matt Thompson.
The pleasure Renner's character gives us by challenging himself 
through impossible situations as the archetypal "movie hero" seems 
almost addictive by the fade-out. We come to see, through vicarious 
experience and calibrated observation, how heroism and madness can 
be one and the same, and to remember—thanks to Kathryn Bigelow—
just how much fun men of danger are in the movies.  JP

A Hollywood blockbuster long and dark, The Dark Knight is Christopher 
Nolan's sequel to his Batman Begins (2005). Highly anticipated for its 
script (co-written by Nolan and his brother), its high-profile cast, and its 
tone, this is—with all due respect to the first and third of the director's 
trilogy—the most arresting and alarming installment of the Batman 
oeuvre, but also the richest in character and emotion.
Christian Bale returns as the millionaire Bruce Wayne/superhero 
Batman who finds himself trapped—with heroic District Attorney Harvey 
Dent (Aaron Eckhart), his assistant Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), 
and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman)—in the diabolical hands of 
the Joker (Heath Ledger). As the highly disturbed and disturbing villain, 
Ledger gives an indelible performance that richly merits his posthumous 
Oscar. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman appear as Alfred and Lucius 
Fox, respectively, two heralds of an old world where evil knew its place.
Filmed primarily in a darkly gleaming Chicago, the story pivots on 
the escalation of evil and how good can be tainted in its attempts to 
triumph. Particularly shocking is the Joker's setup of putting people on 
two ships, each with a detonator for the other, in the hopes of a massacre.
Emotionally and morally complicated, The Dark Knight sees Batman 
facing the problem he has always battled: Can a vigilante be ethically 
sound? The answers are ambiguous but the film is astonishing.  KK

Låt den rätte komma in  Tomas Alfredson, 2008
Let the Right One In
At face value, this Swedish vampire film follows the trend of prudish 
predators: the vampire as your abstaining friend. Any languishing for sex 
is thoroughly suppressed. Of course, it helps that the protagonists—
blond and angelic Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) and the enigmatic Eli (Lina 
Leandersson)—are (or seem to be) children. Oskar is bullied by his 
classmates and, though he dreams of getting even, he remains passive. 
Eli teaches him to stand up for himself. "Be me a little," she tells him. He 
does, but his actions come back with a vengeance in a bloodbath climax. 
Throughout the film, pale white palettes abound, and punctured 
spots of red intervene in this snowy, sleepy, and dreamy design. Set in 
the early 1980s, there is no social media, no frantic chatter to relieve the 
sense of isolation. Into this constellation comes the dark, brooding Eli; 
she is a guest, but it is not clear how welcome she is. 
The title refers to the fact that, according to folklore, vampires must 
be invited in by their victims. Oskar initially refuses; only after Eli almost 
bleeds to death from his rudeness does he give in. Let the Right One In 
thus asks the uncomfortable question whether hospitality means that 
one has to accept the bad with the good. A pointed commentary on 
immigration, perhaps; an enchanting fairytale, for sure.  EM
This acclaimed science-fiction invasion thriller was inspired by events 
that took place in District Six, Cape Town, during apartheid. Centering 
on themes of xenophobia and segregation, it tells of a spaceship that 
stalls over South Africa. When a group ventures up, they find hundreds 
of sick and malnourished aliens, or "Prawns." Earth steps in to help and 
places the aliens in a shantytown called District 9, forbidding them from 
mixing with the general populace. Two decades later, overpopulation 
has become a concern for the government. A plan to relocate some of 
the Prawns is put in place, led by kindhearted Wikus Van de Merwe 
(Sharlto Copley). Documentary-style filmmaking gives the movie an air 
of authenticity that helps the audience connect on a human level with 
the plight of the alien population. As our hero Wikus is infected with a 
disease and slowly starts to turn alien himself, our empathy grows. 
District 9 is a smart political allegory that puts emotion, humor, and 
incredible visuals to fluid and accomplished use. The special effects of 
the Prawns mark one of the most seamless examples of CGI thus far. 
Director Neill Blomkamp dictated that the species had to be insectlike 
but also bipedal, saying, "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque 
because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with 
something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape."  SJS

The culmination of a master filmmaker's career, Avatar marks a decade's 
worth of work and millions of dollars of investment. Though no Gone 
with the Wind in complexity of character or event, it is of the same 
monumental ambition and singularity of vision. Only D. W. Griffith, Cecil 
B. DeMille, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg attained such heights of 
technical achievement in stories of such grand scope while still reaping 
box-office success. Like these greats, James Cameron raises the bar. 
The story has been told many times, in films like Dances with Wolves 
(1990) and The Thin Red Line (1998), but it's still a classic. A soldier tries 
to find inner peace during wartime by going native, finding a more 
grounded, loving existence among the peoples he has been taught are 
his enemy. Inevitably, the cultures clash, and he finds himself in the 
middle, fighting for the side of right and love against his former allies. 
Using state-of-the-art technologies, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is 
able to run free in his "avatar," a genetically engineered body that allows 
him to survive in the hostile atmosphere of the moon Pandora. Similarly, 
Cameron uses state-of-the-art film techniques to submerge us in the 
flora and fauna of a new world; much as King Kong did in 1933, Star Wars 
did in 1977, and Jurassic Park did in 1993. Like those films, Avatar—hailed 
as a game changer, a masterwork, and a box-office record breaker—will 
someday, no doubt, look antiquated but, hopefully, remain beloved.  JP

Writer-director Christopher Nolan is a mastermind filmic architect, and 
Inception is a feat of complicated construction. Dom Cobb (Leonardo 
DiCaprio) and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are corporate 
spies specializing in "extraction," the art of going into someone's 
subconscious to extract their deepest secrets, or at least the ones they 
are being paid to discover. Computer hacking is a thing of the past, and 
one's mind is now the most vulnerable target. Cobb has been forced to 
leave his children, after being exiled for espionage, and is desperate to 
return to them. When he is approached by Saito (Ken Watanabe) and 
guaranteed safe passage back to the United States upon completion of 
a new job, he will stop at nothing to accomplish the task.
The job is unlike any other: it is not an extraction but an "inception," 
the implantation of an idea so deep in one's subconscious that it is 
believed to be one's own. Cobb puts together a crack team to travel 
inside the darkest recesses of the mind of their mark, Robert Fischer 
(Cillian Murphy), and implement an idea that will make their bosses 
incredibly rich. As the team members plant the idea, they battle Fischer's 
subconscious barriers while fighting off their own demons. Cobb battles 
with the manifestation of his dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who 
tempts him to stay in the dream world where they can be together. 
Inception works on many levels: not only is it an entirely original and 
fresh idea, but it also manages to be a smart action thriller, a poignant 
and grief-filled drama, and an examination of the deeply hidden recesses 
of our minds that are completely unknown. This allows viewers to enjoy 
the film for its superficial beauty and quality performances, while letting 
the cerebral plot wash over them, to be examined more closely upon a 
second or third viewing. Although Inception plays well on the popcorn-
movie premise, its twisted mind-game undercurrents will set it apart in 
cinematic history.  SJS

More than 1 billion people log on to Facebook every day, and it is no 
wonder a movie about the beginning of the phenomenon became a 
huge hit. What is surprising is just how good a film it is. The script is 
brutally funny and helps to expose the ego-driven and narcissistic 
profiles we have created for ourselves. It is also terribly depressing. 
No one is more self-obsessed than lead character Mark Zuckerberg 
(Jesse Eisenberg). After his girlfriend dumps him, he writes a scathing 
blog entry about her and is further inspired to create a webpage where 
male students can rate the attractiveness of their female classmates. 
From there, Zuckerberg takes his computer skills, the wild popularity of 
his webpage, and early funding from his best friend Eduardo Saverin 
(Andrew Garfield) to jump-start the most popular social networking site 
of all time. The rest, as they say, is history. 
Eisenberg is exceptional, but his costars also shine. Garfield portrays 
Saverin with a heart-tugging vulnerability, Justin Timberlake easily 
captures the arrogant swagger of Napster founder Sean Parker, and 
Armie Hammer nails the double duty of playing rowing-star brothers the 
Winklevoss twins. Director David Fincher adds his subtle beautiful visual 
prowess to Sorkin's quick script, and the resulting film is a never-ending 
debate on who did what and who owes whom. As the movie closes on 
a shot of Zuckerberg alone at his computer, the audience cannot help 
but ask: Has Facebook made us feel more connected or more alone?  SJS

Nostalgia de la luz  Patricio Guzmán, 2010
Nostalgia for the Light
On the high plains of the Atacama Desert in Chile, as astronomers look 
to the skies in the hope of mapping distant galaxies, relatives of "the 
disappeared"—victims of a brutal dictatorship—dig around and search 
through the earth in the hope of uncovering the remains of loved ones. 
In his youth Patricio Guzmán wanted to be an astronomer, but when 
General Augusto Pinochet toppled the democratically elected Allende 
government in 1973, he turned to filmmaking. The result, beginning with 
the landmark The Battle of Chile (1975-78) and later Nostalgia for the Light, 
has been a career dedicated to recording both the atrocities committed 
by Pinochet against all who opposed him and what has happened in the 
years since, as a nation has attempted to come to terms with its past.
Guzmán's film contemplates a paradoxical world in which science has 
mapped so much of the universe yet still bears witness to humanity's 
unbridled capacity for cruelty. Beginning with the story of his own 
interest in astronomy, Guzmán weaves a fascinating narrative out of the 
interplay between science and history. A political prisoner describes his 
escape from a concentration camp and out of the Atacama Desert, one 
of the driest regions on the planet. Lacking any other form of guidance, 
he uses the stars for his compass. 
In another sequence we cut from a close-up of the moon's surface to 
a gradual pan over the battered and pockmarked globe of a skull. And 
in the film's most powerful scene, a woman gazes across to a collection 
of observatories and wonders if such technology wouldn't be better 
employed looking into the ground and finding the remains of her son. 
Guzmán's film celebrates humankind's scientific advances, but suggests 
that such progressive thinking is redundant if it is indifferent to human 
suffering and people fail to empathize with one another.  IHS

2013

It is 1927 and Hollywood is at its peak. The most famous silent film star 
is George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), riding high from his newest success. 
At the premiere he meets Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), a flapper who is 
trying to break into show business. George gets her a part in his next 
film, and not long after a technological breakthrough changes the 
industry forever: the arrival of sound. "Talkies" take over, and while 
Peppy's career skyrockets, George's plummets.
The Artist is a black-and-white, silent film and was shot in 1:33:1, the 
same ratio that many 1920s films used. Dialogue is expressed using 
intertitles, and Ludovic Bource's jazzy score guides you through the 
narrative. The film is thoroughly rooted in the classics of the silent period 
and is filled with references to the early years of Hollywoodland.
The actors tap back into the forgotten art of silent movie acting, 
expressing themselves through their facial expressions and mannerisms. 
Bejo, meanwhile, lights up any frame she is in—equally at home dancing 
the Charleston or weeping for the man she secretly loves. 
Crucially, The Artist does not spoof silent movies, nor does it wink at 
the audience. It wins the viewer around with its perfectly judged tone 
and an engaging story that shifts from light and frothy to some 
unexpectedly harrowing moments. As a loving tribute to the days when 
actions spoke louder than words, The Artist is charming and irresistible. 
And it features the best performance by a dog since Toto.  SW

The Cabin in the Woods  Drew Godard, 2011
Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods is a fiendishly clever horror with 
an unexpected plot development that's one of the great surprises in 
recent cinema. The film begins predictably, with a group of attractive-
looking college students retreating to a secluded rural hideaway. 
Meanwhile, in an initially undisclosed location, two white-collar middle-
management types next to a bank of TV screens are seemingly involved 
in a surveillance job. Their connection to the teenage revellers isn't 
immediately clear, but as the party in the cabin turns into a gruelling 
bloodbath, the film grips with its shocking, unfolding sense of revelation.
Directed with merciless efficiency by Drew Godard, who made the 
home-movie-style monster movie Cloverfield (2008), The Cabin in the 
Woods is co-written and produced by Buffy creator and Avengers (2012) 
director Joss Whedon. Like Buffy, it is at once a knowing pastiche of 
horror conventions and a horror film in its own right. With its bloody 
exploration of ideas of sacrifice, the movie prompts difficult questions 
about the audience's need for and enjoyment of onscreen violence and 
fear. But for the movie's ironic reference to other horror films, The Cabin 
in the Woods works in wholly visceral terms: it is at once a clever 
experiment in genre and a scary experience in itself.  EL

2012
The Washington of Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a world of collusion, 
compromise, and self-interest. The political sparring is brutal, with the 
lower chamber of Congress resembling a gladiatorial ring where legends 
are forged and vacillation can destroy a career. One doesn't have to look 
too hard to find the parallels with contemporary America.
Tony Kushner's screenplay, drawing on Doris Kearns Goodwin's 
impressive Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, is less 
a biopic of one man than an account of the machinations that led to the 
passing of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery. In tone 
it resembles a densely plotted political thriller as the legislation 
undergoes its precarious journey through a fractious and ideologically-
divided House of Representatives. 
Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing as the sixteenth President of the 
United States. Like Oskar Schindler in Spielberg's 1993 Holocaust drama, 
we first see him from behind, hearing his voice before seeing his face. By 
the time we see him in close-up, any trace of Day-Lewis is gone. Lincoln 
here is both a man of the people and a skilled debater, at ease in any 
company. As a statesman he is not immune to deception or playing the 
Washington game. He is shown engaging the services of lobbyists, and 
gambles with soldiers' lives as he tactically courts peace with the enemy, 
whose arrival in Washington he delays in order to see his amendment 
passed. The impact of one term in office and the grueling toll of a drawn-
out civil war is visible in his face and physique, but when countering 
opposition to his plans he erupts with passion and fire. 
Lincoln is Spielberg's third film to deal with race in America, after The 
Color Purple (1985) and Amistad (1997). It is also the best. Aided by 
Kushner's impressive script and Day-Lewis's towering performance, along 
with a strong cast that includes Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, and David 
Strathairn, Spielberg's consummate drama is a reminder of why Abraham 
Lincoln is among the most revered figures in U.S. political history.  IHS

Wadjda  Haifaa Al-Mansour, 2012
Trumpeted as the "first" film from a female Saudi filmmaker (although 
the claim is not quite true, the achievement is nonetheless a rare one), 
Wadjda is the deceptively simple tale of a young girl who wants a bicycle. 
However, this is contemporary Saudi Arabia and young girls do not often 
get what they want, not least permission to ride, let alone own, a bicycle. 
Haifaa Al-Mansour's debut is a remarkable achievement in a society 
where women cannot vote and cinemas themselves are banned. It is a 
beguilingly simple story that chooses not to tackle politics or human 
rights issues head on. Instead it employs a subtle and often charming 
approach to make a very clear statement. Effortlessly told, this character-
driven piece focuses on the eponymous heroine, a spiky, straight-talking 
10-year-old, whose competitive streak with the neighborhood boys 
leads her on a quest to acquire her heart's desire: a green bicycle. Along 
the way we discover a family torn apart by a father bowing to pressure 
to take a second wife, and we delight in the subversion of Wadjda raising 
the money she needs by thrashing the opposition in a school Qur'an 
recitation competition. Funny and smart, Wadjda offers a window into 
another world—one where the realities of life for young women are 
harsh, but where personality can shine through.  BHa

A rare commercial success that attracted almost universal critical 
acclaim, Gravity fires a Robinson Crusoe narrative into orbit thanks to 
state-of-the-art 3D technology. Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, 
whose mission on a space shuttle is cut short when the wreckage from 
a destroyed Russian satellite creates a chain reaction and sends a cloud 
of debris hurtling toward her at the speed of a bullet. 
As filmed by Alfonso Cuarón, this 3D disaster movie works not in 
spite of his intelligence as a filmmaker but because of it. Employing the 
same style used in his earlier films (Y Tu Mamá También [2001] and 
Children of Men [2006]), as evinced by the long opening shot of the 
orbiting shuttle coming in to view, Cuarón envelops us in the spectacle 
of space before unleashing the metallic tsunami that destroys everything 
in its wake. Throughout the groundbreaking shoot, during which Bullock 
spent most of her time encased in a light box that allowed the visual and 
special effects team to capture the weightlessness of spaceflight, Cuarón 
steers clear of the rapid editing style of most action movies. Instead we 
have time to contemplate Stone's predicament and feel the tension rise 
as the metal tide once again makes its way toward her.
If the film's script is a little insubstantial, George Clooney's charming 
captain and Bullock's scientist more than compensate for it. Though not 
as fully realized as Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, Bullock brings enough 
humanity to her character to make Stone a convincing sci-fi heroine. She 
is at her best in the film's quieter moments, particularly a revealing scene 
that suggests why she may have originally opted to travel into space.
In a later conversation, Stone manages to contact someone on Earth. 
Unaware who the man is, her spirits lift at the sound of a baby crying and 
a dog barking. In Jonás Cuarón's short Aningaaq (2013), we are on the 
other end of the line, in Greenland, as an Inuit fisherman is facing his 
own, potentially serious, dilemma. It is a moving and elegiac companion 
piece to this, the grander feature he co-wrote with his father.  IHS

After his uneven excursion to America with This Must Be the Place (2011), 
Paolo Sorrentino returned to Italy to continue his examination of the 
country's privileged class. But whereas Il Divo (2008) offered a scathing 
account of corruption among Italy's political ranks, as embodied by 
Guilio Andreotti, The Great Beauty shines a light on Rome's cultural elite. 
In his youth, Jep Gambardella penned a highly praised novella and a 
glittering literary career awaited him. Instead, he chose to take center 
stage among the cream of Rome's aristocrats and wealthy, coming to life 
at night and partying until dawn. Now, celebrating his sixty-fifth 
birthday, he looks back on his life and ponders its worth. 
From the curious prologue, in which a Japanese tourist dies at one 
of the city's many religious sites, Rome lies at the heart of Sorrentino's 
film. His camera prowls through gardens, glides across sculptures, and 
is enraptured by the city skyline, particularly the view from Jep's 
magnificent apartment. It is a marked contrast to the ghouls and 
grotesques that populate the interminable parties. The dances they 
perform are pathetic rituals—a desperate attempt to evade the passage 
of time and proximity of death. This is the Berlusconi generation, and 
what a sorry, self-deluded, and inelegantly wasted bunch they are.
Sorrentino's breathtaking direction is matched by the stunning 
performance of Toni Servillo, the director's leading man in four of his six 
films. In choosing to echo the themes of Felinni's La Dolce Vita (1960), it 
is perfect that Sorrentino has his own Marcello Mastroianni. Servillo, one 
of the finest actors in contemporary cinema, brings Jep to life with a 
balance of wit, cynicism, and weariness with a lifestyle he knows is 
contemptible, but indulges in nonetheless. Witnessing his journey 
through this world is like watching a car crash—we know it's wrong but 
we just can't look away.  IHS

Seemingly coming out of nowhere to win the Golden Palm at the 2013 
Cannes Film Festival, Blue is the Warmest Color left a fluster of over-awed 
reviewers trailing in its wake, smashed taboos at every turn, and rapidly 
disintegrated into a circus of "he said/she said" scrapping between its 
director and one of its stars on release. Featuring a graphic and much 
discussed lesbian sex scene, the film unprecedentedly saw its Golden 
Palm divided between its director, Abdellatif Kechiche, and two stars.
To focus on the sex scenes is to betray the extraordinary strength of 
a writer/director who understands the nature of drama, from how long 
to show a scene to when to cut. At its heart, the film is, quite simply, 
about love—of which sex is but a part—about the trauma of growing 
up, and the subtleties of class. The latter is never more perfectly 
observed than when watching the girls' two families at mealtimes—
Adele's huddled around the TV, messily slurping simple spaghetti; 
Emma's enjoying a sophisticated fruits de mer, complete with oysters 
and riveting middle class chat. But above all else it's a study of the 
complexity of romantic and sexual obsession—sometimes murky, 
almost always inevitably doomed, but utterly irresistible all the same. 
Kechiche's confidence to hold our gaze with sex scenes, breakup scenes, 
and all the seemingly insignificant moments in between, results in a 
riveting film that demands and rewards our attention.  BHa

12 Years a Slave  Steve McQueen, 2013
The year is 1841. Solomon Northup is a free black man who works as a 
violinist and lives in upstate New York with his wife and children. Tempted 
by the offer of a few days work in Washington, he travels there only for 
his supposed employers to drug and kidnap him. He wakes in rags and 
chains, and is beaten by two strangers when he protests. Rechristened 
"Platt," he is transported to the Southern states and sold as a slave. 
Based on Northup's memoir, Steve McQueen's film is seen by many 
as mainstream U.S. cinema's most challenging account of slavery. 
Recounting Solomon's time under different owners and his desperate 
attempts to return to his family, the film never panders to easy emotion 
or exploits the brutality of his existence. Its power lies in the gradual 
degradation of daily life, which contrasts sharply with the world that 
Solomon knew. In one flashback, as Solomon and his wife are shopping 
for clothes, a slave wanders into the shop they are in and stares in 
disbelief as Solomon samples the tailoring. 
Despite shocking scenes of violence, McQueen has crafted a beautiful 
film: trees droop under the weight of the Spanish moss, sunrise colors 
the gently flowing rivers, and the Southern landscape as a whole 
resembles a lush Eden. Beatings and whippings play out against this 
idyllic backdrop.  
Yet throughout this ordeal Solomon clings to his humanity, his 
face taut with desperation and his eyes deep wells of sadness. It is to 
both McQueen and lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor's credit that Solomon 
remains a fully rounded character and not merely the conduit for our 
sympathy and horror.
By focusing on one man's story, McQueen has laid down a challenge 
for future representations of this period. Upon hearing Solomon's terrible 
journey, Brad Pitt's character Bass comments, "Your story is amazing, and 
in no good way." This is an important film and long overdue.  SW
"It is pitched pretty near 
perfectly in terms of sheer 
narrative craftsmanship."

By virtue of its unusual production history, Richard Linklater's Boyhood 
gives us two films in one: a work of fiction spanning twelve years in the 
life of a young boy growing up in Texas; and a shadow-documentary that 
escorts its fictional counterpart each step of the way. How could it be 
otherwise, given Linklater's singular decision to shoot the film over a 
corresponding period of time, and with the same cast? The actors age 
before us, though it is the evolution of Ellar Coltrane (who plays the boy, 
Mason) and Lorelei Linklater (the director's daughter, playing Mason's 
sister) that has the most resonance. 
Like François Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films (beginning with The 400 
Blows [1959] and ending with Love on the Run [1979]) and Michael 
Apted's Up series, Boyhood's power is accumulative. However, Linklater's 
longitudinal study is also a lesson in compression—he gives us the 
incremental bloom of Mason's life, and all of its attendant experience, in 
less than three hours. The seamless and unannounced transitions that 
introduce each phase of his development elicit in the viewer a 
commensurate gasp of delayed recognition: look how he has grown! But 
underpinning it all is a feeling of concern and even suspense, no doubt 
encouraged by our awareness of the cast's deep investment, as well as 
the onset of time: what will become of Mason/Ellar? 
As we follow Mason through the commonplace rituals of an 
American adolescence, we begin to see that one of Linklater's 
achievements is to have created something at once both unerringly 
specific (a Texas childhood in the early twenty-first century) and 
universal. And while the film is something of a paean to parenthood 
(Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are both subtle and true as the boy's 
divorced parents), Boyhood's real subject is time, unfolding as it does in 
a perpetual present tense.  MM

Like Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948), Alejandro González Iñárritu's 
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)—to give the movie its 
full title—will have us believe that the film unfolds as one single shot. 
Digital trickery has replaced someone standing in front of a camera 
while a fresh reel of film is loaded, but the effect remains the same—
although now we're no longer confined to a single room. Iñárritu's 
camera swoops and swerves, first in the Broadway theater where former 
screen superhero Riggan Thomson is preparing to make his debut with 
an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story he has written, directed, and 
is starring in, before following him out onto the street. It's already clear 
that he is teetering on the edge of sanity. Throughout the film he 
converses with his alter ego, Birdman, the comic crusader-turned-movie 
character he played twice on the screen before retiring from the role in 
1992. That was the same year that Michael Keaton, who plays Riggan, 
stopped playing Batman. What we are meant to draw from this 
association, Iñárritu and his star leave to us.
Hollywood loves a comeback as much it does movies about itself. As 
such, Iñárritu's film strikes a double whammy, offering up a brilliant satire 
of both the theater and film world, and giving Michael Keaton his best 
role since he played Ray Nicolette in the adaptations of Elmore Leonard's 
Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). Not that the actor does 
anything we haven't seen before. His nervous energy is what made his 
Bruce Wayne such a livewire and his villains so compelling. However, 
more than any other director he has worked with in the last decade, 
Iñárritu understands how to channel that energy into a portrait of a man 
plagued by demons—an actor with an overinflated ego who is 
nevertheless crippled by a fear of failure. 
With its pounding percussive score by Antonio Sanchez, Birdman 
is a frenzied, often brilliant comedy that, unlike some of Iñárritu's 
previous films, never takes itself too seriously. If only Riggan would do 
the same.  IHS

The twin spirits of Ernst Lubitsch and Stefan Zweig preside benevolently 
over The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson's intricately baroque vision 
of the world of Middle Europe as it probably never was before at least 
one, and possibly both, world wars. Anderson has always striven to 
devise alternative universes of his own; this is his most complete 
fabrication yet, a fanatically and fantastically detailed, sugar-iced, 
calorie-stuffed, gleefully overripe Sachertorte of a film.
The action centers around the eponymous mountain-set luxury hotel 
and its presiding genius, urbane omnicompetent concierge Monsieur 
Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). The narrative jumps backward through four 
time zones, the mood is stylized comedy undercut with melancholia, 
and the joyously melodramatic plot takes in murdered aristocrats, 
contested wills, purloined paintings, jailbreaks, high-speed pursuit down 
a ski-slope, defenestrated cats, lovelorn widows, gourmet patisserie, and 
a secret fraternity of hotel concierges.
It's a rich mixture—perhaps too rich for some. But those not 
indissolubly wedded to hard-edged realism, and prepared to succumb 
to the charm of Anderson's filmmaking, with its acute sense of design, 
its playful tone, and exhilarating pace, will find The Grand Budapest Hotel 
a delectable and unexpectedly moving experience. Shooting in three 
different ratios—2.35:1, 1.85:1, and the classic 1.33:1—to differentiate 
the movie's three main timelines, Anderson deploys a cast that, even by 
his standards, is bewilderingly star-studded, with many of the famous 
names onscreen for barely more than a minute or two. But above all, this 
is Fiennes's film. Gifted a rare chance to play comedy, he demonstrates 
an impeccable comic timing that makes his performance as Monsieur 
Gustave, informed as it is by an evident affection for the character, a 
constant joy to watch.  PK

Set thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), the Skywalker 
saga continues with Episode VII. Picking up the characters from the 
original trilogy, The Force Awakens thrusts them through hyperspace 
and into a new adventure, along with a collection of boisterous new 
heroes and villains.
The Empire has fallen, but the First Order has risen in its wake, 
determined to quash the New Republic and bring the galaxy under 
its shadow. The Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher), launches 
a desperate search for the missing and last remaining Jedi, Luke 
Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who is now little more than a myth. A penitent 
stormtrooper (John Boyega), hotshot pilot (Oscar Isaac), and lonely 
scavenger (Daisy Ridley) become embroiled in the quest and soon find 
their destinies intertwined with that of the entire galaxy.
Though technologically the most sophisticated movie in the series, 
there is debatably too much reverence to what came before. Having a 
climactic father-son moment upon a bridge, a planet-size superweapon, 
and a well-spoken villain in General Hux—whom Domhnall Gleeson 
struggles to delineate from previous roguish thesps—doesn't help. But 
when it follows its own path the film soars, such as Rey's flight from the 
planet Jakku and her brutal duel with the wonderfully maladjusted Kylo 
Ren, played with delicious malevolence by Adam Driver.
The Force Awakens oozes charm and likeability from every old-
fashioned pore, from the new fan-favorite robot BB-8 and an engaged 
and enthusiastic Harrison Ford reprising the role of Han Solo to the use 
of special, rather than visual, effects to bring the creatures and sets to 
life. Grossing $1 billion within twelve days of opening, Star Wars has, 
once again, established itself as the dominant blockbuster franchise 
for a long time to come.  SW

Reputedly nearly as much of an ordeal for its cast and crew as for 
its protagonist, Alejandro González Iñárritu's film is inspired by the 
legend of Hugh Glass. In 1823, the American frontiersman was left for 
dead by his companions after being mauled by a bear, but managed 
to haul his battered body across 200 miles (320 km) of wilderness to 
the nearest settlement. Given that Glass's story has been much 
embellished over the years, it hardly matters if the film plays fast and 
loose with it. (The previous Hollywood treatment of the tale, Richard 
Sarafian's 1971 Man in the Wilderness, starring Richard Harris, took 
even more liberties.)
Iñárritu's purist insistence on shooting in natural light for only ninety 
minutes a day, and in the most remote and rugged subzero locations, 
pays off. The visual intensity of his landscapes, shot in moody near-
monochrome by acclaimed cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, brings 
out all the icy indifference—and paradoxical beauty—of the stark 
desolation Glass has to struggle through and underlines his dogged 
determination to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio, rarely off-screen 
throughout the film's two-and-a-half-hour-plus running time, has 
relatively little dialogue, but his expression of clenched, vengeful fury 
speaks volumes. (This committed performance finally won DiCaprio an 
Academy Award after four previous nominations.)
There's an eerie, almost mystical tone to the film, which with its 
theme of resurrection—Glass, seemingly dead, clambers up out of his 
own grave—at times seems to hint at Christian or perhaps shamanistic 
symbolism, a reading abetted by a scene in a ruined church. Iñárritu has 
created a grim epic of survival, a tale that with its extremes of violence 
and suffering isn't always easy to watch, but one that hooks itself 
relentlessly into the memory.  PK

October 1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau. Saul Ausländer (the sensational Géza 
Röhrig) is a Hungarian member of the Sonderkommando, a group of 
Jewish prisoners isolated from the camp and forced to assist the Nazis 
in the machinery of large-scale exterminations. While working in one of 
the crematoriums, Saul discovers the corpse of a boy he takes for his son. 
As the Sonderkommando plans a rebellion, Saul decides to carry out an 
impossible task: save the child's body from the flames, find a rabbi to 
recite the mourner's Kaddish, and offer the boy a proper burial.
Son of Saul is an extraordinary work exhibiting courage, focus, and a 
clear-eyed sensibility concerning the atrocity of genocide and 
inhumanity. That it is the work of a director making his debut further 
accentuates its towering achievement. Shot on 35mm, it's a terrifying 
glimpse into hell, suffering, and cruelty, in which no shot is extraneous 
and no horror is spared. There is, however, more to the film than an 
endless parade of torture. The use of close-up is intrinsic, making the 
spectator in some way a complicit witness in the horror. The sense of 
claustrophobia is intense and at times overpowering. Claude Lanzsmann's 
Shoah (1985) is rightly regarded as the benchmark in terms of cinema 
dealing with the Holocaust. Son of Saul is perhaps the first fictional work 
that deserves to be spoken of in similarly reverential tones.  JWo
Positioned in the press as either "the transgender prostitute movie" or 
"that film shot on an iPhone," Sean Baker's mischievous twenty-four-hour 
odyssey through the pulsating streets of Los Angeles is a far cry from the 
novelty piece such soundbites might imply. Instead, this richly emotional 
and imaginative Christmas Eve in the life of two sex workers on Santa 
Monica Boulevard is no mere gimmick. This is the real deal.
Baker's decision to shoot on three iPhone 5s (borne out of budgetary 
necessity) certainly informs the look and frenetic pace of the film, 
allowing for a sense of energy and unrestrained movement that could 
only be achievable with such lightweight equipment. But technique 
always takes a back seat to the real stars of the show: trans non-actors 
Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor, who give two extraordinary 
performances as the hypnotic heroines Sin-Dee Rella and Alexandra. 
With vivid colors and tart dialogue, Tangerine has much to offer, both 
from an artistic and cultural perspective. Although perhaps what is 
ultimately most fascinating about the film is in fact what it is not. It is not 
another lesson in transgender identity told through cisgender eyes. Nor 
is it a didactic commentary on sex work, or a simplistic portrayal of 
marginalized characters. It is a dizzying, crackling, and authentic 
celebration of female friendship and solidarity.  MB

Journalism is much like law or international spying in that the individuals 
practicing it in movies are inevitably having a more exciting time than 
their real life counterparts. That Spotlight, which follows a small team of 
newspaper reporters in 2001 as they uncover widespread sexual abuse 
within the Boston Archdiocese, avoids the temptation to add drama 
where there was none is a testament to its quiet daring. Tom McCarthy 
draws strength from restraint, demonstrating confidence that his film 
can be engrossing and moving without having to squeeze in artificial 
conflicts and character arcs.
Spotlight is so involving precisely because it observes professionals 
doing a job well. It is significant that we never see the team receive the 
Pulitzer Prize for their efforts. (The film followed suit, winning the Oscar 
for Best Picture.) Instead, the focus is exactly where it should be: on the 
task at hand. McCarthy spends an appreciable amount of time depicting 
the sort of unglamorous reporting that films typically ignore, as the 
journalists, powered by moral horror, chase multiple sources, trawl 
through parish directories, and request court reports. While Spotlight is 
deeply compassionate about the well over 1,000 estimated abuse 
survivors, it is fundamentally a celebration of investigative journalism 
and the decent, ordinary people committed to it.  JW

Long before The Fast and the Furious franchise tore up the world's 
freeways and petrolheads guzzled themselves on the antics of the Top 
Gear team, an ex-cop called Max Rockatansky ruled the barren 
wastelands of the open road. After Ned Kelly, Max is arguably Australia's 
most famous pop culture icon. Neither an outlaw nor a hero in any 
classic sense, he is molded by the world around him—a land that has 
descended into chaos, with rival factions vying for whatever remains of 
the Earth's natural resources. 
In the frenetic Mad Max: Fury Road, Mel Gibson has been replaced 
as Max by Tom Hardy, whose more introspective road warrior allows 
Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to steal the show. The one-armed 
driver of a huge eighteen-wheel war rig, she takes advantage of a fuel 
run to escape the clutches of the insane leader of the War Boys, 
Immortan Joe, taking with her his coterie of wives. With Max and 
Furiosa's singular talents combined, they manage to ward off an army 
of assailants, and the resulting vehicular mash-ups dwarf even the 
previous films' record-setting levels of carnage. Driving the action, which 
includes a vertiginous hurricane of fire, is Junkie XL's pulsating score—
more than a match for Brian May's pounding accompaniment to the first 
two installments.
The landscape has changed a little, too. Australia was used as the 
backdrop for the first three Mad Max films, whereas Fury Road's action 
was mostly shot across the vast red plains of the Namib Desert. But 
the gothic feel of the film, both in the design of vehicles and the 
characters who drive them, remains the same. It's B-movie heaven 
filmed as a big-budget blockbuster, with an Oscar-winning team of 
technicians and designers ensuring the ride is as fabulous to look at as 
it is thrilling to experience.  IHS

An extraordinarily ambitious undertaking, Sebastian Schipper's Victoria 
dazzlingly bottles the exhilaration of pure, undiluted adrenalin. Much 
was made of the film's technical achievement, as it was shot in a single, 
audacious, 140-minute take in the unassuming district of Mitte, Berlin.
The film is a journey into the city's underbelly that takes in crime, 
romance, and criminality to reflect a young woman's awakening. 
Victoria (Laia Costa), a young, fun-loving woman from Madrid who 
has decided to put her conservatoire training as a pianist on hold, meets 
four local guys outside a nightclub. Sonne (Frederick Lau) and his friends 
are "real" Berliners who promise to reveal the hidden secrets of their city. 
But what starts out as a fun if reckless evening suddenly takes on a 
darker, more malignant hue, and as dawn approaches Victoria and 
Sonne realize that the stakes have become perilously high. 
Performed to an incredible standard, with each actor meeting the 
demands of an extremely grueling shoot, Victoria is as impressive for the 
nuanced character study of its central protagonist as it is for the manner 
in which the director and cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen 
combined to film it. Schipper and Costa expertly navigate the subtle 
emotional shifts, giving us a portrait of a young woman who starts off 
the film as one kind of person and ends it radically transformed.  JWo

Here's to the ones who dream . . . whose numbers include writer-
director Damien Chazelle. He has gone against the grain of Broadway 
adaptations and karaoke jukebox cash-ins with his daring resurrection 
of the original movie musical. Inspired by Hollywood's classic technicolor 
showbiz extravaganzas (Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon) as much as 
by French auteur Jacques Demy's more workaday, story-sung fables (The 
Umbrellas of Cherbourg), Chazelle fashions a vibrant love letter to his 
adopted city of Los Angeles: one imbued with affectionate callbacks to 
its cinematic heritage, but also focused on the pressures of juggling a 
personal relationship with professional ambition. 
Our amorous, ambitious couple, jazz purist and wannabe impresario 
Seb (Ryan Gosling) and aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone), first clash 
immediately after Chazelle's incredibly ballsy opening—an all-singing, 
all-dancing, seemingly one-take showcase on a gridlocked LA freeway. 
It's the film in microcosm: bright young things throwing themselves 
heart and soul into dexterous songs (by composer Justin Hurwitz and 
lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) about "making it" ("it" being a career, 
a romance, an identity), tracked by Linus Sandgren's swooping, 
swooning camera. Stone and Gosling's vocals aren't meant to imitate 
Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds; their footwork isn't trying to match 
Astaire and Rogers. What they do bring, in their third and best onscreen 
coupling to date, is effortless, effervescent chemistry. Stone has never 
been more charming or achingly vulnerable, while Gosling, playing his 
own piano, gracefully cedes the spotlight to her. The bittersweet price 
of chasing your desires is wonderfully brought home in a show-stopping 
fantasy climax that invokes (among others) An American in Paris's dream 
ballet, but firmly marks La La Land's own place in the Hollywood 
firmament—a new heavenly body in the city of stars.  LS

Hell or High Water  David Mackenzie, 2016
Had Donald Trump seen Hell or High Water during his presidential 
election campaign, he may have cited the Howard brothers as examples 
of what has gone wrong with America. Siblings Toby (Chris Pine) and 
Tanner (Ben Foster) are faced with the foreclosure of their recently 
deceased mother's ranch. To save the property, they embark on a series 
of bank robberies over a short time span, laundering their money 
through a casino. But Tanner's wayward tendencies get the better of 
him, bringing them ever closer to the two Texas Rangers in hot pursuit.
Thematically similar to Ramin Bahrani's 99 Homes, David Mackenzie's 
film offers a refreshing take on classic genre material. It's impossible not 
to see the political allusions in Taylor Sheridan's perfectly constructed 
screenplay, which allows for compassion toward the Howards until 
Tanner goes too far. Foster offers up another convincing social misfit, 
while Pine impresses as the quieter Toby, only occasionally unleashing 
his rage against a system that profits from exploitation.
As the Texas Rangers, Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker is both more 
knowing than he lets on and a wry foil to Jeff Bridges's cynical Marcus 
Hamilton, whose conversations with Parker add humor to the film. 
Bridges brings depth and humanity to the film's later scenes, and his 
exchanges with Pine are a masterclass in understated performance.  IHS

Following the current trend in Hollywood for remaking classic movies, 
Disney has employed state-of-the-art technology to revisit its roster of 
animated features. First up is an ambitious take on its beloved, jazz-
tinged adaptation (1967) of Rudyard Kipling's classic tale.
It's the story of orphan Mowgli (Neel Sethi), who has been lovingly 
raised by a family of wolves as one of their own. Life is good until Shere 
Khan (Idris Elba), a tiger bearing human-inflicted scars, professes that it 
is only a matter of time before Mowgli realizes his true identity and 
becomes a threat to the animals; the tiger demands that Mowgli be 
sacrificed to him. Forced to flee, and joined by the wise panther 
Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), Mowgli encounters the honey-loving bear 
Baloo (Bill Murray), the python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), and orangutan 
king of the apes Louie (Christopher Walken), who bears more than a 
passing resemblance to an Apocalypse Now-era Marlon Brando. 
Shot entirely on location in Los Angeles, The Jungle Book is an 
extraordinary technical achievement and skillfully delivers Kipling's story 
to a modern audience. Eschewing contemporary animated films' 
deployment of references to pop culture, Jon Favreau's film opts to 
immerse us in a realistic and often menacing world, while exuding just 
the right amount of Disney magic.  AG

Without King Arthur's wife, Guinevere, would the legend of Camelot 
appear quite so gilded? Likewise, would its twentieth-century 
equivalent—the presidency of John F. Kennedy—have exhibited such 
luster without its enigmatic First Lady? It is the latter question that 
underpins Pablo Larraín's Jackie. The movie carries off a daring narrative 
and historical coup by pushing the major male political players of that 
era to the periphery in order to assert Jacqueline Kennedy's importance 
within the short-lived Kennedy administration. Also offered is an 
alternative perspective on one of the key moments in postwar American 
history, which, like the mythic Camelot, was very much defined by its 
central female protagonist.
Larraín's film mostly unfolds in flashback, over the four-day period 
between JFK's assassination and his state funeral, and during the filming 
of Jacqueline Kennedy's televised tour of the White House in 1961. These 
scenes are interspersed with an interview in the film's present, between 
the former First Lady and a Life magazine reporter, taking place a week 
after the assassination. The facts of what happened—the alleged 
conspiracies surrounding the assassination, the shooting itself, and the 
way the postmortem was carried out—are not called into question; the 
aim of the film is to present something far more intimate.
Jackie is not an attempt to recreate a moment in history. From the 
outset, it eschews the conventional biopic form, and Noah Oppenheim's 
screenplay does not portray a public figure stoically coping with tragedy. 
Instead, Oppenheim is much more interested in grappling with the 
possibility that his subject might have questioned her own identity in 
the immediate aftermath of her husband's death, when the world she 
had come to know collapsed around her. The interview finds her 
attempting, mostly off the record, to extract her public persona from her 
own personality, one that is fraught with doubts and which previously 
she has revealed only to her priest (John Hurt). This sense of unease that 
she feels, as the hours following the assassination pass by and her 
personal loss becomes subsumed by the duties of office, is accentuated 
by Mica Levi's haunting score. 
Stéphane Fontaine recreates the visual style of television in the 1960s 
for the White House tour, along with footage of the President's car 
speeding toward Parkland Memorial Hospital. For all the moments that 
unfold after the shooting, Fontaine draws out the vivid colors of Jackie's 
outfits against the backdrop, accentuating the importance of her role. 
Playing Jackie, Natalie Portman is mesmerizing. Her performance 
transcends mimicry, although she captures the voice, mannerisms, and 
physical movement to perfection. But in this film it is the quieter 
moments that matter most. A quizzical glance to her assistant, the way 
she behaves with her children, or stifling an emotion—these are what 
draw us into this woman's world.  IHS

German director Maren Ade's third feature, Toni Erdmann, marks a 
significant if unlikely international breakthrough for a filmmaker already 
highly regarded in her homeland. Debuting at Cannes, where it won the 
FIPRESCI prize, the film went on to be a multiple victor at the European 
Film Awards, going on to win over critics and audiences worldwide. 
The film is an in-depth character study of the relationship between 
a lonely German teacher, Winfried—aka Toni Erdmann, an oafish 
character with a penchant for fart jokes and false teeth—and his uptight, 
work-obsessed daughter living and working in Bucharest. A biting 
analysis of white-collar culture, the film is incredibly funny and not 
remotely parochial, while also acknowledging the debilitating effects of 
mental illness and the undiagnosed paralysis caused by loneliness. It 
also decries the economic exploitation of poor European countries.
The lead performances are astonishing, especially Sandra Hüller as 
the very vulnerable daughter. Channeling Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder 
in Michael Clayton, Hüller radiates surface calm and self-restraint but 
gradually reveals a seething underbelly of alienation and unhappiness. 
Featuring a jaw-dropping nude dinner-party sequence in which male 
and female genitalia are the least sensitive elements on public display, 
this is a wholly satisfying film that will resonate for a long time.  JWo
Winfried Conradi is loosely based on 
Maren Ade's father, who has worn 
fake teeth to joke with people.

Not just one of the finest horror films of the year but one of the best 
films, period, Under the Shadow is all the more remarkable considering 
that it is the work of a first-time director. Deeply satisfying as a bone-
chilling ghost story, it is also a feminist political drama set in Iran after 
the Cultural Revolution, as well as a forensic examination of how a 
disintegrating marriage destabilizes a family triangle. 
As the Iran-Iraq War rumbles on, Shideh (Narges Rashidi) is blocked 
from continuing her medical studies, having been on the wrong side of 
the Revolution as an outspoken student. By contrast, her ambitious 
husband moves rapidly through the ranks of Ayatollah Khomeini's 
administration. Though it is never overtly articulated, each partner 
quietly disapproves of the other—the wife for having prioritized politics 
over personal gain and the husband for placing ambition above 
principle. When her husband is sent away from Tehran for military 
service, Shideh is left alone with their daughter who, sensing her father's 
frustration with his wife, grows difficult and sullen with her mother. After 
a missile lands on their apartment building but does not explode, an old, 
superstitious resident insists that it has unleashed an ancient, evil Middle 
Eastern spirit. The child's behavior becomes increasingly menacing and 
uncanny, suggesting that the spirit may have her in its grips.
UK-based Iranian writer-director Babak Anvari delivers a film of 
astonishing poise and exquisitely ratcheting tensions, with the whole 
cast understanding and using the power of understatement to elevate 
the audience's sense of unease. Economical and perfectly paced as it 
heads toward its frenzied and deeply satisfying climax, this is a richly 
effective contribution to the horror genre, at different times recalling 
Repulsion, Poltergeist, and the recent Australian chiller The Babadook. 
Just don't think about watching it alone. TT

Having produced only three features in more than fifteen years, writer-
director Kenneth Lonergan (You Can Count on Me, Margaret) proves that 
you cannot rush genius. Manchester by the Sea is reminiscent of the 
character-driven American cinema of the 1970s, exemplified by directors 
such as Hal Ashby, Michael Ritchie, and Bob Rafelson. At its heart, the 
movie is a harrowing but wholly empathetic portrait of people who 
have lost their way—and every day carry the burden of knowing that 
all too well.
Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is the resident handyman for a small 
apartment complex in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts. He spends his 
days doing menial tasks, and his evenings either alone in his basement 
apartment or nursing a beer at his local bar, where he looks to pick a 
fight with anyone who throws a glance his way. Then Lee receives the 
news that his older brother Joe has died, and that, to his chagrin, he has 
been appointed legal guardian of Joe's teenage son Patrick (Lucas 
Hedges). He has no choice but to return to his coastal hometown, a place 
full of painful memories and still inhabited by a former wife (Michelle 
Williams). Here, he is forced to confront the past that he had tried to 
escape, and the terrible memories that still haunt him. 
Like Margaret, a movie that has been mired in distribution difficulties, 
this is a sprawling, ambitious film whose very flaws give it both vitality 
and the ability to perfectly replicate the human experience. Remarkably 
attuned to the failings and foibles of human nature, Manchester by the 
Sea is a challenging work that is unafraid to shine a light on the darker 
recesses of our lives—although it provides much-needed moments of 
levity, too. A film about lost souls, it is explicit yet never less than poetic 
on the subject of trauma and depression. And Affleck's "I can't beat this. 
I just can't" speech is guaranteed to break the hardest of hearts.  JWo
"To me, every day 
[for Lee] is a struggle 
to not collapse. A very 
active struggle."

I, Daniel Blake  Ken Loach, 2016
Ken Loach has made naturalistic dramas about struggling ordinary 
people since Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow, and it is evident with 
I, Daniel Blake that the same underlying social problems continue to 
animate him today. In the film, widowed fifty-nine-year-old joiner Daniel 
(Dave Johns), unable to work after a heart attack yet apparently 
ineligible for disability benefits, finds himself enmeshed in a bureaucratic 
nightmare, relieved only by his friendship with young single mother 
Katie (Hayley Squires). Based on research by Loach's long-term 
collaborator Paul Laverty, I, Daniel Blake is fiercely critical of the U.K. 
welfare system, and is all the more successful as a polemic for the 
affection and empathy it evinces for its working-class characters.
While I, Daniel Blake is angry, bleak, and often desperately sad—a 
scene where Katie breaks down in a food bank is particularly 
heartbreaking—Loach and Laverty demonstrate faith in common 
decency. When the computer-illiterate Daniel visits a library to complete 
an online form, everyone he asks is happy to give him a hand; likewise, 
Daniel is instinctively helpful, assisting Katie with practical solutions 
such as making an improvised heater from candles and a flowerpot. The 
film argues that those seeking state support are decent citizens who just 
need a little help—help any neighbor would give. Loach's message is 
unchanged: it's the system that's cruel, not those trapped in it.  JWa

The title of Ava DuVernay's searing documentary refers to the Thirteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution, and specifically the 
second clause in the first section: "Neither slavery nor involuntary 
servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have 
been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place 
subject to their jurisdiction." But DuVernay and cowriter Spencer Averick 
show how incarceration has become the new Jim Crow, and that the U.S. 
penal system is merely an alternative to the system of slavery that 
operated in the country before the Civil War. 
Featuring a wealth of interviews with journalists, academics, cultural 
commentators, and politicians of every persuasion, the film analyzes the 
tactics used by the U.S. government to ensure the continued growth of 
the prison industrial complex; the story is shocking and dispiriting. 
Yet the film ends on a note of cautious hope. The "Black Lives Matter" 
movement is evidence that people are not willing to stand by passively 
and let black men be killed. It is a rallying cry for not only justice but 
fairness. As activist Malkia Cyril points out, "When black lives matter, 
everybody's lives matter. . . . It's not just about black lives. It's about 
changing the way this country understands human dignity."  IHS

Arrival  Denis Villeneuve, 2016
The more advanced special effects become, the harder it is for them to 
impress. Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, understanding this fact, inspires 
wonder not through the depiction of its immense, pebble-shaped 
spacecraft but by answering an intriguing question: what would be the 
fundamental challenges if we were actually visited by aliens?
Its lead character, accordingly, isn't a political or military figure but 
linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams). Her occupation is 
integral: after a dozen alien ships appear across the planet, she is tasked 
by the U.S. government with decoding their language. Communication 
is appropriately one of the film's main themes—beyond Banks's 
philological efforts, Arrival reflects upon the difficulty of international 
cooperation and its crucial role in tackling global problems. 
Arrival 's most thrilling scenes are all conversations. Banks, along with 
sensitive physicist Ian (Jeremy Renner), solves problems through 
research and reason. Eric Heisserer's ambitiously structured screenplay 
is unafraid to raise concepts like semasiographic writing or nonlinear 
orthography, and displays faith in our ability to follow the narrative's play 
with time. What prevents Arrival from becoming a cerebral exercise, 
however, is its grounded humanity: Ian, approaching a spaceship for the 
first time, runs his hand along its surface and is amazed and awed.  JWa

Barry Jenkins' stunning film, which is adapted from playwright Tarell 
Alvin McCraney's In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, captures three 
moments in the life of a single character. "Little" Chiron (Alex Hibbert) is 
bullied at school and has to deal with his crack-addicted mother 
(Naomie Harris) but finds solace in the time he spends with Juan 
(Marhershala Ali) and Teresa (Janelle Monáe), a drug dealer and his 
girlfriend. The teenaged Chiron (Ashton Sanders) is withdrawn but forms 
a bond with Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). Finally, in his mid-twenties, "Black" 
Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is reconciled with his mother and decides to 
visit Kevin (André Holland) after more than a decade has passed.
Mood is everything in Moonlight. The script, sparse and poetic at 
times, is the framework over which Jenkins and regular cinematographer 
James Laxton create moments of breathtaking beauty. Each of the 
chapters in Chiron's life unfold in brief snapshots. Yet the understanding 
that Jenkins has of this world—both he and McCraney grew up in similar 
circumstances in a Florida neighborhood—allows him to reach deep 
into each character and draw out authentic and subtle nuances in their 
behavior. As Martin Scorsese did with Mean Streets, Jenkins offers up a 
fresh take on a familiar world. And Nicholas Britell's score, along with a 
selection of songs that brilliantly inform the narrative, underlines the 
emotional cadence of each scene.
The three central performances—the incarnations of Chiron at 
different ages—succeed in being both different and a progression of 
one character. And bookending the film is Ali's deservedly acclaimed 
portrayal of Juan and Holland's sensitive take on the grown-up Kevin. 
His and Rhodes's scenes together, particularly the extended sequence 
in a diner, ache with a sense of longing, a desire to belong, and the hope 
that they both might finally have found their way home.  IHS

to make gay people
