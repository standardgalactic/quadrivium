The

y
dieren

equations
will
yield
some
mathematical
explanation
of
these
phenomena
(at
least
in
some
appro

sense).
The
in

of
this
set
of

is
to
presen
t

of
the
imp

for

of

yp

of
problems
asso

with
dieren
tial
equations
and
pro

e
and
quan

e
descriptions
of

A
t
the

w

ds
of

whic
h
ma

b
e
applied
to

ab

e
and
whic
h
ha
v
e
applications
in
man
y
other
areas
of
mathematics,
as
w
ell.
As

As

w

adopt
throughout
the

are
equations
in
spaces
of
functions.
W

therefore

as
w

dev

whic

whic
h
are
in
some
sense
natural
for
the
giv

The

An
easy

ws
that

Hence,
since

lim


implying
that
