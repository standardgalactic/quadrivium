Abstract
We discuss Osius’s [22] concept of a recursive coalgebra of a functor from the per-
spective of programming semantics and give some new suﬃcient conditions for
the recursiveness of a functor-coalgebra that are based on comonads, comonad-
coalgebras and distributive laws.

Introduction
This paper is dedicated to the study of recursive functor-coalgebras. In the
sense of [22], a coalgebra (A, α) of a functor F : C →C is recursive iﬀ, for any
algebra (C, ϕ) of F, the morphism equation
f = ϕ ◦Ff ◦α
(∗)
has a unique solution in the unknown f : A →C.

Our prime interest in recursive coalgebras comes from their application to
programming semantics. In programming, it is customary to wish to be able
to take some function Φ : C(A, C) →C(A, C) and read the equation
f = Φ(f)
(∗∗)
as a function deﬁnition. The problem is that, for arbitrary givens, the equation
(**) is not guaranteed to make sense as a deﬁnition: it may have exactly one
solution, but it can just as well have no solutions or multiple solutions among
which there is no most preferable solution. But for more speciﬁc givens, the
equation may indeed be predestined to have exactly one solution (or at least
one solution, but among them a canonical one) and in this case it is really
meaningful to see it as a deﬁnition.
For (*), which is a structured instance of (**), one of the ways to know
that it properly deﬁnes a morphism is to know that (A, α) is recursive. The
equation form (*) covers most useful situations in programming and examples
of recursive coalgebras abound. To mention some: (a) For any functor F :
C →C with an initial algebra, (µF, inF), the F-coalgebra (µF, in−1
F ) is recursive
(iteration).
But so are also the F(Id × KµF)-algebra (µF, F⟨idµF, idµF ⟩◦
in−1
F ) (primitive recursion), the F(Id × F)-coalgebra (µF, F⟨idµF, in−1
F ⟩◦in−1
F )
(iteration back one or two steps) etc. Recursive coalgebras cover a wide variety
of structured recursion schemes for initial algebras. (b) The set ListZ of all
lists over some linearly ordered set Z, together with the nil and cons functions,
is the initial algebra of the functor LZ = K1 + KZ × Id : Set →Set. Endowed
with the analysis of every non-empty list into its head and tail, the set ListZ is a
recursive LZ-coalgebra and so is every suﬃx-closed subset of ListZ. A recursive
LZ-coalgebra is also given by the set ListZ equipped with the analysis of every
non-empty list into its smallest element and the rest. The set ListZ equipped
with the analysis of every non-empty, non-singleton list into two halves is a
recursive coalgebra of the functor BTZ = K1 +KZ +Id×Id. Etc. (c) A functor
may well have recursive coalgebras without having an initial algebra. E.g., a
set with a relation on it carries a recursive coalgebra of the powerset functor
iﬀthe relation is wellfounded.
In this paper, we present some motivation for the use of recursive coalge-
bras as a paradigm of structured recursion in programming semantics, present
the basic theory of recursive coalgebras and, centrally, give some new con-
ditions for the recursiveness of a coalgebra based on comonads, comonad-
coalgebras and distributive laws. The latter results are a generalization of our
results in [27] on structured recursion schemes for initial algebras and, modulo
the duality, the dual results in [4,7] on structured corecursion schemes for ﬁnal
coalgebras.
Related work Recursive coalgebras, together with wellfounded coalgebras—
a related concept where, instead of a recursion principle, the coalgebra has to
obey an induction principle—, were ﬁrst introduced by Osius [22] in his work
2

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
on categorical set theory. He considered wellfounded and recursive coalge-
bras of the powerset functor of the category of sets (or, more abstractly, of
the powerobject functor of an elementary topos), and proved the general re-
cursion theorem, that every wellfounded coalgebra of the powerset functor is
recursive. Taylor [23,24,25] took Osius’s ideas further, showing that the gen-
eral recursion theorem holds for any functor on Set preserving monos and
inverse image diagrams. Eppendahl [9,10] studied recursive (a.k.a. algebra-
initial) coalgebras with the objective of obtaining an explanation to Freyd’s
[12,13,14] transposition of invariant objects.
The dual concept of a corecursive (a.k.a. coalgebra-ﬁnal, iterative) algebra
was used by Escard´o and Simpson [11] to provide a universal characterization
of the closed euclidean interval. The newest work by Ad´amek, Milius and
Velebil [19,3] on the free completely iterative monad (resp. the free iterative
monad) is centered around a related, but stronger concept (resp. its ﬁnitary
version considered also earlier by Nelson [21]).
Structured recursion schemes for initial algebras have been studied by the
authors [27] and the dual schemes for ﬁnal coalgebras by Bartels [4] and Can-
cila, Honsell and Lenisa [7]. To functional programming, the structured gen-
eral recursion scheme was ﬁrst introduced by Meijer, Fokkinga and Paterson
[18] who called it the hylo scheme. Doornbos and Backhouse [8] have asked
the question under what conditions the hylo diagram has a unique solution. In
type theory, structured (co)recursion schemes for initial algebras (ﬁnal coal-
gebras) have been studied by, e.g., Gim´enez [15,16] and (co)recursion more
generally by, e.g., Bove and Capretta [5,6] and McBride and McKinna [17].
Organization of the paper In Section 2, we explain our motivation for study-
ing recursive coalgebras and give the deﬁnition. In Section 3, we present a
number of important basic facts about recursive coalgebras.
In Section 4,
which is the main section of the paper, we show how recursive coalgebras
arise from comonads, comonad-coalgebras and distributive laws. In Section 5,
we conclude by pointing out some directions for future research.

Recursive coalgebras: motivation and deﬁnition
In functional programming, functions are commonly speciﬁed by recursive
equations. Often, these equations have a nice and simple structure, although
this structure may be hidden. As an example consider a possible deﬁnition of
the quicksort algorithm. Let Z be a set linearly ordered by ≤.
qsort: ListZ →ListZ
qsort [] = []
qsort (x : l) = qsort(l≤x) ++ (x : qsort(l>x))
3

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
where l≤x = [y ←l | y ≤x] and l>x = [y ←l | y > x].
This deﬁnition is clearly based on an equation of the form qsort = Φ(qsort)
where Φ : Set(ListZ, ListZ) →Set(ListZ, ListZ). With minimal eﬀort, we can
see that Φ(qsort) may be rewritten into an equivalent form qmerge◦BT qsort ◦
qsplit where BTZ X = 1 + Z × X × X. The ﬁrst morphism qsplit of the
composition determines the arguments for the recursive calls; (ListZ, qsplit) is
a BTZ-coalgebra:
qsplit: ListZ →1 + Z × ListZ × ListZ
qsplit [] = inl(∗)
qsplit (x : l) = inr(⟨x, l≤x, l>x⟩)
The second morphism BT qsort: BTZ(ListZ) →BTZ(ListZ) makes the recur-
sive calls.
The third morphism qmerge determines how the results of the
recursive calls combine into the result of the main call; (ListZ, qmerge) is a
BTZ-algebra:
qmerge: 1 + Z × ListZ × ListZ →ListZ
qmerge inl(∗) = []
qmerge inr(⟨x, l1, l2⟩) = l1 ++ (x : l2)
The equation qsort = qmerge ◦BTqsort ◦qsplit is meaningful as a deﬁnition
since it determines a unique function. The reason is that the arguments of
the recursive calls are always strictly shorter than that of the main call—
a property of the coalgebra (ListZ, qsplit).
The equation remains uniquely
solvable also, if we replace (ListZ, qmerge) with some other F-algebra (C, ϕ):
we may say that (ListZ, qsplit) is recursive.
Abstracting away the concrete data of the above example, we are led to
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (coalgebra-to-algebra morphism, recursive coalgebra)
Let F : C →C be a functor.
A coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from an
F-coalgebra (A, α) to an F-algebra (C, ϕ) is a morphism f : A →C such that

An F-coalgebra (A, α) is recursive (or algebra-initial) iﬀfor every F-
algebra (C, ϕ) there exists a unique coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, α)
to (C, ϕ), denoted ﬁxF,α(ϕ).
Recursive coalgebras and (ordinary) coalgebra morphisms form a category
RecCoalgF which is trivially a full subcategory of CoalgF.

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
We note that, in the functional programming community, the coalgebra-
to-algebra morphism condition is known as hylo diagram [18]. The recursion
scheme used—hylo scheme—says that, if F has an initial algebra whose in-
verse is its ﬁnal coalgebra (which happens if C is algebraically compact), then
the post-composition of the initial algebra morphism to (C, ϕ) with the ﬁnal
coalgebra morphism from (A, α) (the hylomorphism) is a coalgebra-to-algebra
morphism from (A, α) to (C, ϕ). The hylomorphism is not necessarily a unique
solution of the hylo diagram, just a canonical one.
For the powerset functor P : Set →Set, the notion of recursive coalgebra
coincides with that of wellfounded relation. Indeed, any P-coalgebra α : A →
PA determines and is determined by a relation ≺on A (we use the symbol
≺to help intuition, but the relation need not be an order): α(a) = {x ∈A |
x ≺a}, x ≺a iﬀx ∈α(a). A P-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, α)
to (C, ϕ) is a function f : A →C such that f = ϕ ◦Pf ◦α. If a ∈A, then
(Pf ◦α)(a) = {f(x) | x ≺a}, so the condition says that
f(a) = ϕ({f(x) | x ≺a})
We get that (A, α) is recursive iﬀ, for any set C and function ϕ : PC →C,
the equation above has a unique solution in f : A →C. This happens exactly
when the relation ≺is wellfounded.
3
Recursive coalgebras: basic constructions
As exempliﬁed by the last example (determining the wellfoundedness of a
decidable relation on natural numbers is undecidable), it can be hard to de-
termine whether a coalgebra of a given functor F is recursive. So, instead
of trying to solve the unsolvable, we will point out a few simple cases where
some coalgebra is obviously recursive and then provide various constructions
for producing new recursive coalgebras out of coalgebras already known to be
recursive. We start with the simplest interesting case when the functor F has
an initial algebra. In this situation, we agree to write (µF, inF) for the initial
F-algebra and ItF( ϕ ) for the unique algebra morphism from (µF, inF) to a
given F-algebra (C, ϕ) (the iteration given by (C, ϕ)).
Proposition 3.1 Let F : C →C be a functor. If F has an initial algebra,
then (µF, in−1
F ) is a ﬁnal recursive F-coalgebra.
Proof. The F-coalgebra (µF, in−1
F ) is certainly recursive, since the unique
algebra morphism ItF( ϕ ) from (µF, inF) to an F-algebra (C, ϕ) is also a unique
coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (µF, in−1
F ) to (C, ϕ).
To see that (µF, in−1
F ) is ﬁnal among the recursive F-coalgebras, notice that
the unique coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from a recursive F-coalgebra (A, α)
to (µF, inF) is also a unique coalgebra morphism from (A, α) to (µF, in−1
F ). 2

Corollary 3.2 If F has an initial algebra, then the unique coalgebra-to-
algebra morphism from a recursive F-coalgebra (A, α) to an F-algebra (C, ϕ)
factors as follows:
ﬁxF,α(ϕ) = ItF( ϕ ) ◦ﬁxF,α(inF)
Proposition 3.3 Let (A, α) be a recursive F-coalgebra. If F has an initial
algebra, then m = ﬁxF,α(inF) : A →µF is split mono (as a morphism, not
necessarily as a coalgebra morphism) iﬀα is split mono.
Proof. (if) Let the postinverse of α : A →FA be α−: FA →A. Then
h = ItF( α−) : µF →A is a postinverse of m : A →µF: indeed, we have
h◦m = h◦inF ◦Fm◦α = α−◦F(h◦m)◦α, but we also have idA = α−◦FidA◦α,
hence h ◦m = ﬁxF,α(α−) = idA.
(only if) Write h : µF →A for the postinverse of m : A →µF. Then
α−= h ◦inF ◦Fm : FA →A is a postinverse of α : A →FA, since
α−◦α = h ◦inF ◦Fm ◦α = h ◦m = idA.
2
Here is the ﬁrst proposition useable to reduce the question of recursiveness
of one coalgebra to that of some other, related coalgebra.
Proposition 3.4 Let (A, α) be a recursive F-coalgebra and (B, β) an F-
coalgebra.
If there are F-coalgebra morphisms h : (A, α) →(B, β) and
k : (B, β) →(FA, Fα) such that β = Fh ◦k, then (B, β) is also recursive.
Proof. Consider an arbitrary F-algebra (C, ϕ). Let g = ﬁxF,α(ϕ). The situ-
ation is summarized in the following diagram.

Let f = ϕ ◦Fg ◦k : B →C.
We show that ﬁxF,β(ϕ) = f.
We have
f = ϕ ◦Fg ◦k = ϕ ◦F(ϕ ◦Fg ◦α) ◦k = ϕ ◦F(ϕ ◦Fg ◦k) ◦β = ϕ ◦Ff ◦β,
hence f is a F-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (B, β) to (C, ϕ).
To see that f is unique, suppose that f ′ is another F-coalgebra-to-algebra
morphism from (B, β) to (C, ϕ). Then f ′◦h = ϕ◦Ff ′◦β◦h = ϕ◦F(f ′◦h)◦α,
which implies f ′ ◦h = ﬁxF,α(ϕ) = g.
Consequently, f ′ = ϕ ◦Ff ′ ◦β =
ϕ ◦F(f ′ ◦h) ◦k = ϕ ◦Fg ◦k = f.

A number of useful propositions follow from Prop. 3.4. First, recursive
F-coalgebras are preserved by F.
Proposition 3.5 If (A, α) is a recursive F-coalgebra, then (FA, Fα) is also
a recursive F-coalgebra.
Proof. From Prop. 3.4 for h = α and k = idF A.
2
The implication of Prop. 3.1 can be turned around.
Proposition 3.6 Let F : C →C be a functor.
(a) If (A, α) is a recursive F-coalgebra and α is iso, then (A, α−1) is an
initial F-algebra.
(b) If (A, α) is a ﬁnal recursive F-coalgebra, then α is iso (both as a mor-
phism and as a coalgebra morphism) (and hence (A, α−1) is an initial F-
algebra).
Proof. (a) The unique coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, α) to an F-
algebra (C, ϕ) is also a unique algebra morphism from (A, α) to (C, ϕ).
(b) By Prop. 3.5, we have that (FA, Fα) is a recursive F-coalgebra and
it is trivial that α is a coalgebra morphism from (A, α) to (FA, Fα). On the
other hand, as (A, α) is a ﬁnal recursive coalgebra, there exists a coalgebra
morphism h from (FA, Fα) to (A, α); i.e. we have the following situation:
FA
F α

A
α
o
α

F 2A
F h

FA
F α
o
h

FA
A
α
o
Now, as (A, α) is a ﬁnal recursive coalgebra, there cannot be two distinct
coalgebra morphisms from (A, α) to (A, α), hence h ◦α = idA. From h being
a coalgebra morphism, we further get also that α ◦h = F(h ◦α) = idF A.
2
It is not true for any category that a subcoalgebra of a recursive coalgebra
is recursive. But the following weaker statement is always true.
Proposition 3.7 Let (A, α), (B, β) be F-coalgebras and m : B →A a split
monic coalgebra morphism from (B, β) to (A, α). (a) If (A, α) is recursive,
then (B, β) is also recursive. (b) If α is split mono, then so is β.
Proof. Let h be the postinverse of m. (a) Let k = α◦m. Then h is trivially a
coalgebra morphism and k is a coalgebra morphism as Fα ◦k = Fα ◦α ◦m =
7

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
F(α ◦m) ◦β = Fk ◦β. Furthermore, β = β ◦h ◦m = Fh ◦α ◦m = Fh ◦k.
By Prop. 3.4, (B, β) is recursive.
(b) Let α−be the postinverse of α. Then β−= h◦α−◦Fm is a postinverse
of β, since β−◦β = h ◦α−◦Fm ◦β = h ◦α−◦α ◦m = h ◦m = idB.
2
Here is another useful proposition, with a relatively involved proof. In the
next section, we shall see that, under an extra assumption, this proposition is
an instance of a more general theorem.
Proposition 3.8 Let C be cartesian and F : C →C a functor.
If (A, α)
is a recursive F-coalgebra, then (A, F⟨idA, α ⟩◦α) is a recursive F(Id × F)-
coalgebra.
Proof. Consider
an arbitrary F(Id × F)-algebra (C, ϕ).
Let ψ
=
⟨ϕ, FfstC,F C ⟩: F(C × FC) →C × FC, g = ﬁxF,α(ψ) : A →C × FC
and f = fstC,F C ◦g : A →C. We show that ﬁxF (Id×F ),F ⟨idA,α ⟩◦α(ϕ) = f.
That f is a F(Id×F)-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, F⟨idA, α ⟩◦
α) to (C, ϕ) is evident from the commutation of the outer square in the dia-

To verify that f is unique, suppose that f ′ is another F(Id × F)-
coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, F⟨idA, α ⟩◦α) to (C, ϕ).
Then
⟨f ′, Ff ′ ◦α ⟩
=
⟨ϕ ◦F⟨f ′, Ff ′ ◦α ⟩◦α, F(fstC,F C ◦⟨f ′, Ff ′ ◦α ⟩) ◦α ⟩
=

The following two transposition propositions appeared in Eppendahl [9,10].
Proposition 3.9 Let F, G : C →C be functors and τ : F
.→G a natural
transformation.
(a) If (A, α) is a F-coalgebra and (C, ϕ) is a G-algebra, then f : A →C
8

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
is a G-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, τA ◦α) to (C, ϕ) iﬀit is a F-
coalgebra-algebra morphism from (A, α) to (C, ϕ ◦τC).
(b) If an F-coalgebra (A, α) is recursive, then the G-coalgebra (A, τA ◦α)
is recursive.
Proof. (a) Immediate from ϕ ◦Gf ◦τA ◦α = ϕ ◦τC ◦Ff ◦α.
(b) For any G-algebra (C, ϕ), the unique F-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism
from (A, α) to (C, ϕ ◦τC) is also a unique G-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism
from (A, τA ◦α) to (C, ϕ).
2
Proposition 3.10 Let F : C →D and G : D →C be functors.
(a) If (A, α) is an GF-coalgebra and (C, ϕ) is a FG-algebra, then there
is a bijection between FG-coalgebra-to-algebra morphisms from (FA, Fα) to
(C, ϕ) and GF-coalgebra-to-algebra morphisms from (A, α) to (GC, Gϕ).
(b) If (A, α) is a recursive GF-coalgebra, then (FA, Fα) is a recursive
FG-coalgebra.
Proof. (a) For a GF-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism f
from (A, α) to
(GC, Gϕ), set f ⋆= ϕ ◦Ff : FA →C.
For an FG-coalgebra-to-algebra
morphism g from (FA, Fα) to (C, ϕ), set g† = Gg ◦α : A →GC. Now f ⋆
is an FG-coalgebra morphism from (FA, Fα) to (C, ϕ) since f ⋆= ϕ ◦Ff =
ϕ◦F(G(ϕ◦Ff)◦α) = ϕ◦F(Gf ⋆◦α) and similarly g† is a GF-coalgebra mor-
phism from (A, α) to (GC, Gϕ). Further, (f ⋆)† = Gf ⋆◦α = G(ϕ◦Ff)◦α = f
and similarly (g†)⋆= g.
(b) If (C, ϕ) is a FG-coalgebra, then the unique GF-coalgebra-to-algebra
morphism from (A, α) to (GC, Gϕ) is also a unique FG-coalgebra-to-algebra
morphism from (FA, Fα) to (C, ϕ).
2
The following proposition builds on Props. 3.9, 3.10.
Proposition 3.11 Let F : C →C, G : D →D be functors, L : C →D a
functor with a right adjoint, and τ : LF
.→GL a natural transformation. If
(A, α) is a recursive F-coalgebra, then (LA, τA◦Lα) is a recursive G-coalgebra.
Proof. Let R be the right adjoint of L and η : Id
.→RL and ε : LR
.→Id
the unit resp. counit of the adjunction. Let λ(·) denote the natural bijection
between the homsets C(L−, =) and C(−, R=). Now, let β = λ(τA ◦Lα) =
R(τA ◦Lα) ◦ηA = RτA ◦ηF A ◦α : A →RGLA.
According to Prop. 3.9, the RGL-coalgebra (A, β) is recursive. But then
by Prop. 3.10, the LRG-coalgebra (LA, Lβ) is recursive. By Prop. 3.9 once
more, the G-coalgebra (LA, εGLA◦Lβ) is recursive. But εGLA◦Lβ = λ−1(β) =
λ−1(λ(τA ◦Lα)) = τA ◦Lα.

We conclude this section by brieﬂy looking at two useful strengthenings of
the notion of recursiveness, which we call strong recursiveness and (for the time
being, for the lack of a better name) very recursiveness. Strong recursiveness
relates to recursiveness for coalgebras as allowing strong iteration (iteration
with parameters) relates to allowing iteration (i.e., initiality) for algebras.
Deﬁnition 3.12 (strongly recursive coalgebra) Let C be cartesian and
F : C →C a functor with a strength σ. An F-coalgebra (A, ϕ) is strongly re-
cursive (or recursive with parameters) iﬀ, for any object Γ of C and F-algebra
(C, ϕ), there is a unique morphism f : Γ × A →C, denoted sﬁxF,Γ,α(ϕ),
satisfying

It is immediate that an F-coalgebra (A, α) is strongly recursive iﬀ, for any
object Γ, the F-coalgebra (Γ × A, σΓ,A ◦(idΓ × α)) is recursive.
A strongly recursive F-coalgebra (A, α) is also a recursive F-coalgebra:
for an F-algebra (C, ϕ), ﬁxF,α(ϕ) = sﬁxF,1,α(ϕ) ◦⟨!A, idA ⟩. For the converse
to hold, it is suﬃcient that C is cartesian closed: if (A, α) is a recursive F-
coalgebra, then, for any object Γ, by Prop. 3.11 for D = C, G = F, L = KΓ×Id,
τ = σΓ, the F-coalgebra (Γ × A, σΓ,A ◦(idΓ × α)) is recursive.
An object A is the carrier of a ﬁnal strongly recursive F-coalgebra iﬀit is
the carrier of a strongly initial F-algebra.
Very recursiveness is roughly in the same position wrt. recursiveness for
coalgebras as allowing primitive recursion is wrt. initiality for algebras. The
new work of Ad´amek, Milius and Velebil [19,3] on the free completely iterative
(resp. iterative) monad of a functor (elaborating on their original approach in
[1,2]) is centered around the dual concept (resp. a ﬁnitary version of it).
Deﬁnition 3.13 (very recursive coalgebra) Let C be cartesian and F :
C →C a functor. An F-coalgebra (A, α) is very recursive iﬀ, for any (KA×F)-
algebra (C, ϕ), there is a unique morphism f : A →C, denoted vﬁxA,α(ϕ),
satisfying

An F-coalgebra (A, α) is very recursive iﬀthe (KA × F)-coalgebra

A very recursive F-coalgebra (A, α) is necessar-
ily recursive: for an F-algebra (C, ϕ), ﬁxF,α(ϕ) = vﬁxF,α(ϕ◦sndA,F C). But not
every recursive coalgebra is very recursive.

The concept of very recursive coalgebras and its dual are elegant and useful
because of the following fact whose dual is central in [19].
Proposition 3.14 For any object X, an object DX is the carrier of a cofree
very recursive F-coalgebra over X iﬀDX is the carrier of an initial (KX ×F)-
algebra.
With ‘very recursive’ replaced with ‘recursive’, this equivalence is valid in
the degenerate case X = 1 (an object A carries a ﬁnal recursive F-coalgebra
iﬀit carries an initial F-algebra), but not generally.

Recursive coalgebras from comonads
We shall now proceed to more powerful suﬃcient conditions for a coalgebra
being recursive. These are based on comonads, comonad-algebras and dis-
tributive laws of a functor over a comonad. We recall the deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 4.1 (comonad) A comonad on a category C is a functor D : C →
C together with natural transformations ε : D
.→Id (counit) and δ : D
.→D2
(comultiplication) satisfying, for any object X,

We present three theorems, each saying that a coalgebra constructed in a
certain fashion from a coalgebra known to be recursive is recursive as well.
We begin by the main theorem, which uses a general comonad.

Theorem 4.4 Let F : C →C be a functor, (A, α) a recursive F-coalgebra,
D = (D, ε, δ) a comonad on C and (A, ı) a D-coalgebra. If κ is a distributive
law of F over D satisfying

(∗)
then (A, Fı ◦α) is a recursive FD-coalgebra (and, consequently, by Prop. 3.9,
(A, Dα ◦ı) is a recursive DF-coalgebra).
It might make sense to deﬁne that the data (A, α, ı) form, say, a dicoalgebra
of (F, D, κ) iﬀthey meet the condition (*) and to then develop a theory of
functor-comonad-dicoalgebras (cf. the functor-functor-bialgebras of Turi and
Plotkin [26] or the monad-functor-bialgebras of [4,7]), but we have chosen not
to speciﬁcally pursue this line here, as we will not need many properties of
dicoalgebras.
Proof. Consider any FD-algebra (C, ϕ). Let ψ = Dϕ ◦κDC ◦FδC : FDC →
DC, g = ﬁxF,α(ψ) : A →DC and f = εC ◦g : A →C. We show that (i) f is
a FD-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, Fı ◦α) to (C, ϕ) and (ii) it is
the only one, i.e., ﬁxF D,F ı◦α(ϕ) = f.
Proof of (i): We ﬁrst notice that Dg◦ı = ﬁxF,α(Dψ◦κDC) = δC ◦g. This is
witnessed by the commutation of the outer squares in the following diagrams.

Theorem 4.4 provides a powerful generalization of the central theorem in
[27], which was on structured recursion schemes for initial algebras derivable
from comonads (cf. also the dual result stated in [4,7]; we note that in [28],
the substitution and solution theorems of [20,1] were proved from this result).
Indeed, the theorem of [27] is just a special case of Theorem 4.4 now.
Corollary 4.5 Let F : C →C be a functor with an initial algebra and
D = (D, ε, δ) a comonad on C.
If κ is a distributive law of F over D,
then (µF, FItF( DinF ◦κµF ) ◦in−1
F ) is a recursive FD-coalgebra.
Proof. It is easy to check that (µF, ItF( DinF ◦κµF )) is a D-coalgebra. It
is also immediate that it relates appropriately to the recursive F-coalgebra
(µF, in−1
F ) via κ. Hence, by Theorem 4.4, (µF, FItF( DinF ◦κµF ) ◦in−1
F ) is a
recursive FD-coalgebra.
2
We learn that the result in [27] was provable not so much because of the
initiality of the initial F-algebra (µF, inF) as it was because of the recursiveness
of its inverse F-coalgebra (µF, in−1
F ): the coalgebra (µF, in−1
F ) can be replaced
13

Capretta, Uustalu, Vene
by a recursive coalgebra (A, α) to obtain a more general statement whereas
one cannot replace (µF, inF) with some other algebra.
A useful class of comonads are comonads cofree over a functor. For a func-
tor H which has a cofree comonad, let us agree to write DH = (DH, εH, δH)
for this comonad and σH for the extraction of H from DH. We recall the well
known fact that DH sends an object X to the carrier of a cofree H-coalgebra
over X. We write θH
X for the structure map of this coalgebra. For the unique
coalgebra morphism from an H-coalgebra (C, ϕ) to (DHX, θH
X) that sends a
morphism χ : C →X to εH
X : DHX →X, we write genH
X(χ, ϕ). For any
object X, σH
X = HεH
X ◦θH
X : DHX →HX. For any H-coalgebra (C, ϕ), object
X and morphism χ : C →X, σH
X ◦genH
X(χ, ϕ) = Hχ ◦ϕ : C →HX.
For cofree comonads, by specializing Theorem 4.4, we obtain our second
theorem.
Theorem 4.6 Let F : C →C be a functor, (A, α) a recursive F-coalgebra,
H : C →C a functor with a cofree comonad and (A, ) a H-coalgebra. If
λ : FDH

where ¯= genH
A(idA, ), then (A, F ¯◦α) is a recursive FDH-coalgebra (and,
consequently, (A, Hα ◦) is a recursive HF-coalgebra).
Proof. Deﬁne a natural transformation ¯λ : FDH
.→DHF by ¯λX
=
genH
F X(FεH
X, λDHX ◦FδH
X).
It is easy to verify (these are standard lifting
results) that (A, ¯) is a DH-coalgebra and ¯λ a distributive law of F over DH.
The commutation of the outer triangles and squares in the following diagrams
gives us that DHα ◦¯= genH
F A(α, ) = ¯λA ◦F ¯◦α.

Therefore, by Theorem 4.4 (taking D = DH, ı = ¯, κ = ¯λ), we get that
(A, F ¯◦α) is a recursive FDH-coalgebra.

Our third theorem, where the cofree comonad does not appear manifestly,
but is nonetheless present in the background, is a consequence from Theo-
rem 4.6.
Theorem 4.7 Let F : C →C be a functor, (A, α) a recursive F-coalgebra,
H : C →C a functor with a cofree comonad and (A, ) a H-coalgebra. If
λ′ : FH

then (A, F◦α) is a recursive FH-coalgebra.
Proof. Deﬁne a natural transformation λ : FDH
.→HF by λX = λ′
X ◦FσH
X.
We get that λA ◦F ¯= λ′
A ◦F(σH
A ◦genH
A (idA, )) = λ′
A ◦F(HidA ◦) = λ′
A ◦F.
Hence, by Theorem 4.6, (A, F ¯◦α) is a recursive FDH-coalgebra.
Now consider an arbitrary FH-algebra (C, ϕ).
Let ψ = ϕ ◦FσH
C
:
FDHC →C. The following diagram witnesses that a morphism f : A →C
is a FH-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, F◦α) to (C, ϕ) iﬀit is a
FDH-coalgebra-to-algebra morphism from (A, F ¯◦α) to (C, ψ).

Prop. 3.8 is now immediate provided that there is a cofree comonad for the
functor Id × F: Given a recursive F-coalgebra (A, α), the recursiveness of the
F(Id × F)-coalgebra (A, F⟨idA, α ⟩◦α) is the conclusion of Theorem 4.7 for
H = Id × F, = ⟨idA, α ⟩and λ′
X = ⟨FfstX,F X, FsndX,F X ⟩: F(X × FX) →
FX × F 2X.

Conclusions and future work
We have motivated the relevance of recursive functor-coalgebras for program-
ming: the recursiveness of the coalgebra appearing in a structured general-
recursion equation is a suﬃcient condition for its solvability. Since there is no
practical general method for checking whether a given coalgebra is recursive,
one should strive for useful suﬃcient conditions. We have shown how to use
comonads, comonad-coalgebras and distributive laws to construct new recur-
sive coalgebras from coalgebras already known to be recursive. These results
provide a signiﬁcant generalization (and modularization of the proofs) of the
results of [27] on structured recursion schemes for initial algebras. By duality,
they also generalize the dual results of [4,7].
This paper reports only our ﬁrst results on recursive coalgebras and most
of our questions are unanswered yet. Apart from checking whether the the-
orems of Section 4 can be strengthened in some useful ways, e.g. along the
lines considered in [4] (modulo the duality) (replacing the assumption about
the existence of a cofree comonad over H in Theorem 4.7 by some weaker con-
dition), we would like to take a closer look at wellfounded induction. Taylor
[24] has shown that a functor-algebra is recursive iﬀit is wellfounded in the
sense of his categorical notion, but only for Set (or an elementary topos) and
for functors preserving monos and inverse image diagrams. We would like to
ﬁnd out weaker useful conditions under which the implications in each direc-
tion remain valid. Finally, we are interested in seeing if the results admit any
useful type-theoretic versions. One might wish to be able to turn the struc-
tured general recursion scheme of a recursive coalgebra into a reduction rule
in a typed lambda calculus without giving rise to non-terminating reduction
sequences of welltyped terms. The questions are when this is possible and how
to accomplish it.
