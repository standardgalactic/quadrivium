QUESTION
Which two utilities can you use to set up a job to run at a specified
time?
1
at and crond
2
atrun and crontab
3
at and crontab
4
atd and crond
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The ‘at’ command is used to execute commands at a
specified time and optional date. A cron job is a program or script
scheduled at a specified time. The ‘crontab’ program is used to cre-
ate user cron jobs. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/a/at.html
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/c/crontab.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The Cron daemon (crond) is the program that runs the cr\
2
on job at the specified time. It is not used to set
3
up a cron job.
4
B:Atrun is used to run jobs scheduled by the ‘at’ program\
5
. It is not used to set up a job to run at a specified
6
time.
7
D:Atd is the ‘at’ deamon. Similar to the cron daemon, it \
8
is the program that runs the jobs scheduled with the
9
‘at’ command.

QUESTION
After creating a backup of the users home directories called backup.cpio
you are asked to restore a file called memo.ben. What command
should you type?
Correct Answer: cpio –iF backup.cpio memo.ben
Explanation: The ‘cpio’ command is used to create backups or re-
store files from a backup. The –i option is to extract something. The
F option is to specify a file. Here we are extracting memo.ben from a
file named backup.cpio. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/c/cpio.htm
QUESTION
You wish to restore the file memo.ben which was backed up in the
tarfile MyBackup.tar. What command should you type?
Correct Answer: tar xf MyBackup.tar memo.ben
Explanation: Tarfiles are created using the ‘tar’ utility. Therefore,
you should use the ‘tar’ utility to extract the files. The x option is
to extract and the f option is to specify a filename to extract from.
Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/t/tar.html
QUESTION
When is the most important time to restore a file from your backup?
1
On a regular scheduled basis to verify that the data is a\
2
vailable.
3
When the system crashes.
4
When a user inadvertently loses a file.
5
When your boss asks to see how restoring a file works.
Correct Answer: A

Part I
3
Explanation: According to ‘best practice’, you should regularly
restore files to verify that your backup procedures are working. It’s
no good backing up files regularly if you are unable to restore files
when needed.
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:When the system crashes, you may need to restore your w\
2
hole system. However, this shouldn’t be the
3
only time you restore files.
4
C:When a user loses a file, it will need to be restored. \
5
However, you should prepare for this eventuality by
6
regularly testing your backup/restore process to ensure y\
7
ou are able to restore a file when needed.
8
D:When your boss asks to see how restoring a file works, \
9
you want it to work when you show him. This is
10
why you should test your backup/restore processes.
QUESTION
Which one of the following factors does not play a role in choosing
the type of backup media to use?
1
How frequently a file changes.
2
How long you need to retain the backup.
3
How much data needs to be backed up.
4
How frequently the backed up data needs to be accessed.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Your choice of backup media will depend on its
capacity, its shelf life and the time it takes to access the data. The
frequency of file changes is irrelevant.
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
4
1
B:Different backup media can be kept for varying periods \
2
of time. You should find out from the
3
manufacturers how long a backup media can be kept without\
4
losing its data.
5
C:Obviously, your choice of backup media will depend on t\
6
he amount of data to be backed up. For
7
example, a CD-ROM can hold around 700MB of data while tap\
8
es can hold up to hundreds of gigabytes of
9
data.
10
D:Your choice of backup media will also depend on the tim\
11
e it takes to retrieve data from the media.
12
Reading data from a CD-ROM or DVD is much quicker than re\
13
ading data from a tape.
QUESTION
You attempt to log out but receive an error message that you
cannot. When you issue the jobs command, you see a process that
is running in the background. How can you fix thus so that you can
logout?
1
Issue the kill command with the PID of each running comma\
2
nd of the pipeline as an argument.
3
Issue the kill command with the job number as an argument.
4
Issue the kill command with the PID of the last command a\
5
s an argument.
6
Issue the kill command without any arguments.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The kill command is used to send a signal to kill
one or more process IDs. You must own the process or be a privi-
leged user, otherwise the kill command will be ignored. Reference:
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/k/kill.html
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
5
1
A:You need to end the background process. You know its pr\
2
ocess ID; therefore you should issue the
3
process ID with the kill command to kill the appropriate \
4
process.
5
B:You cannot use the job number with the kill command. Yo\
6
u should use the process ID or process name.
7
D:The kill command won’t work if it doesn’t know what pro\
8
cess you want it to kill.
QUESTION
The top utility can be used to change the priority of a running
process? Another utility that can also be used to change priority
is_______?
Correct Answer: renice
QUESTION
You need to search the entire directory structure to locate a specific
file. How could you do this and still be able to run other commands
while the find command is still searching for you file?
1
find / -name filename &
2
find / -name filename
3
bg find / -name filename
4
&find / -name filename &
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The find command is used to locate files. / is the
root directory, so searching from / will search the entire direc-
tory tree. The –name <filename> enables you to search for a
file named <filename>. The ampersand character (&) is used to

Part I
6
return control of the shell returning you to the command prompt,
without have to wait for the command to execute. Reference:
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/f/find.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:With no ampersand (&) following the command, you will n\
2
ot be able to run other commands until the find
3
command has completed its search.
4
C:The bg command is used to run a suspended job in the ba\
5
ckground if job control is enabled. However,
6
the program or command would have to started and then sus\
7
pended for this to work.
8
D:The ampersand (&) must follow the command, not precede \
9
it.
QUESTION
In order to display the last five commands you have entered using
the history command, you would type _______.
Correct Answer: history 5
Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation: The history command is used
to display the previously entered commands. If you typed history
with no arguments, you would likely get a long scrolling list of com-
mands. By typing a number after ‘history’, you will display only the
last <number> of commands. Reference: http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux
7.3-Manual/getting-started-guide/s1-q-and-ahistory-tips.html
QUESTION
You telnet into several of your servers simultaneously. During
the day, you sometimes get confused as to which telnet session

Part I
7
is connected to which server. Which of the following commands
in your .profile would make it obvious to which server you are
attached?
1
PS1=’\h: \w>’
2
PS1=’\s: \W>’
3
PS1=’\!: \t>’
4
PS1=’\a: \n>’
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The PS1 environment variable controls the prompt on
the command line, and can be used by users to tell what system
they are on, the directory they are currently in, the current date
and more depending on how this variable is configured. The \h
option is used to specify the hostname and the \w option will
give the full path of the current working directory. Reference:
http://ctdp.tripod.com/os/linux/tips/tipsps1.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The \s option is used to display the shell name. This w\
2
on’t give any indication of which machine you are
3
connected to.
4
C:The \ option is used to display the history number of t\
5
he current command. This won’t give any indication
6
of which machine you are connected to.
7
D:The \a option is used to display a new line. This won’t\
8
give any indication of which machine you are
9
connected to.
QUESTION
You have to type your name and title frequently throughout the
day and would like to decrease the number of key strokes you use

Part I
8
to type this. Which one of your configuration files would you edit
to bind this information to one of the function keys?
Correct Answer: .inputrc
Explanation: The inputrc file is used to map keystrokes to text or
commands. You can use this file to make a function key display
your name and title. Other common uses include mapping a func-
tion key to lock your computer or run a command. Note: Addi-
tional answer: ∼/.inputrc (if asked after the full path) Reference:
http://beyond.linuxfromscratch.org/view/cvs/postlfs/inputrc.html
QUESTION
When typing at the command line, the default editor is the _____-
___ library.
Correct Answer: readline
Explanation: The default command line editor is the Readline li-
brary. As with most text editor programs, it allows certain keystrokes
to aid in the writing/editing of a command. For example, there are
keystroke combinations that allow you to jump to the beginning or
end of the line, or to jump to the start or end of a previous word. Ref-
erence: http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/bash/rlman.html
QUESTION
What can you type at a command line to determine which shell
you are using?
Correct Answer: echo $SHELL
Explanation: The ‘echo’ command is used to echo a string to
standard output. $shell is an environment variable that reflects
the current shell in use. Therefore, the ‘echo $shell’ command will
display the name and path of the shell you are using. Reference:
http://www.santafe.edu/projects/echo/how-to/node30.html

QUESTION
You have recently decided to convert from using a monolithic
kernel to using a modular kernel. You have made the appropriate
changes in your kernel configuration. Next you wish to compile
your new kernel and modules and copy the modules to their proper
location. What would you type to do this?
1
make modules modules_install
2
make bzImage modules modules_install
3
make mrproper modules modules_install
4
make dep clean modules modules_install
5
make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: This command consists of multiple make commands
on the same line: The first part of the command, make dep,
actually takes your configuration and builds the corresponding
dependency tree. This process determines what gets compiled
and what doesn’t. The next step, make clean, erase all previous
traces of a compilation so as to avoid any mistakes in which
version of a feature gets tied into the kernel. The next step, make
bzImage does the full compilation of the kernel. The next two
steps, make modules and make modules_install will compile the
modules and copy them to their appropriate location. Reference:
http://www.openna.com/community/articles/security/v1.3-xml/chap7sec84.html
Incorrect Answers:
A:This command will compile the modules, but not the kernel.
B:You need the make dep command to build the dependency tree.
C:Make mrproper is similar to make clean except that it doesn’t
delete any binaries. However, there is no kernel image specified
in this command. D:There is no kernel image specified in this
command.

QUESTION
To allow a user to mount a CD and read from it, which entry should
be put into /etc/fstab?
1
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,user,ro 0 0
2
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,uid=user,gid=group,r\
3
o 0 0
4
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,User,ro 0 0
5
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,usermap,ro 0 0
6
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,owners,ro 0 0
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: This entry in the fstab file allows any user to mount
the CD-ROM (/dev/cdrom) in the /mnt/ cdrom directory. Iso9660
is the file system for the CD-ROM. Noauto means that the CD-
ROM won’t be automatically mounted when the system boots.
The first ‘0’ means that the CD-ROM shouldn’t be backed up and
the second ‘0’ means that the CD-ROM file system shouldn’t be
checked for errors when the machine boots. Reference: Roderick
W. Smith. Sybex Linux + Study Guide: Page 400/1.
Incorrect Answers:
1
B: The syntax of this entry is incorrect.
2
C:The ‘user’ field should be lowercase.
3
D:Usermap is an invalid entry for the user field.
4
E:Owners is an invalid entry for the user field.
QUESTION
What is the usable disk space of a RAID 5 array of five 18 GB drives
with one drive dedicated as a spare?

Part I
11
1
18GB
2
34GB
3
54GB
4
72GB
5
90GB
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The question states that you have 5 18GB drives, but
one is dedicated as a spare. Therefore, you have the use of 4 drives
which equals 72GB. When using RAID 5, parity data is written
across the disks, using the equivalent of one disk’s space (18GB).
Therefore, the total useable space is 72 – 18 = 54GB. Reference:
http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/infobrf/raidfin.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The total usable space is 54GB, not 18GB.
2
B:The total usable space is 54GB, not 34GB.
3
D: The equivalent of one drive is used for parity. Theref\
4
ore, the total useable space is 72 – 18 = 54GB, not
5
72GB.
6
E: One drive is spare and the equivalent of one drive is \
7
used for parity. Therefore, the total useable space
8
is 72 – 18 = 54GB, not 90GB.
QUESTION
You have to mount the /data filesystem from an NFS server (srv
1) that does not support locking. Which of the following mount
commands should you use?

Part I
12
1
mount –a –t nfs
2
mount –o locking=off srv1:/data /mnt/data
3
mount –o nolocking srv1:/data /mnt/data
4
mount –o nolock srv1:/data /mnt/data
5
mount –o nolock/data@srv1 /mnt/data
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: If you are mounting a volume that does not support
locking, you need to use the nolock option with the mount com-
mand. The nolock option tells the system to not use the NFS locking
protocol. Reference: http://docsrv.caldera.com:8457/cgi-bin/info2html?(am-
utils.info.gz)opts%2520Option
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:This answer has the wrong command options.
2
B:‘Locking=off’ is the wrong option. It should be ‘nolock\
3
’.
4
C:‘Nolocking’ is the wrong option. It should be ‘nolock’.
5
E:/data@srv1 is the wrong syntax. It should be <servernam\
6
e>:/<foldername>.
QUESTION
To list the filesystem available from the NFS server ‘castor’, the
command” ____ -e castor” can be used.
Correct Answer: showmount
Explanation: The showmount is used to display information about
NFS filesystems. The –e option is used to specify an exported
filesystem. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/s/showmount.html

QUESTION
When an ext2 partition is formatted, a fixed percentage of the
blocks on the disk are reserved for use by the root user. After the
filesystem has been created this percentage can be modified using
which utility?

Part I
15
1
tune2fs
2
mke2fs
3
e2fsck
4
mount
5
hdparm
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The tune2fs utility can be used to modify the reserved
blocks. For example, the tune2fs – u <username> command can
be used to allow a user to use the reserved blocks. Reference:
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/t/tune2fs.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:You need the tune2fs utility, not mke2fs.
2
C:E2fsck is used to check a disk for bad blocks. It is no\
3
t used for reserved blocks.
4
D:The mount command is used to mount a filesystem. It is \

QUESTION
You are asked to provide access through your FTP server to a
network share available from an NT server running on your local
network- For this purpose, you will need ______ support in the
kernel and to mount the NT share using the smbmount command
line utility:
Correct Answer: smbfs
Explanation: Windows NT uses SMB (Server Message Blocks) for
network communications. In order to be able to use the smb-
mount command to mount a Windows NT share, your kernel must

Part I
16
have smbfs (server message block file system) support. Reference:
http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/∼jn/linux/smbfs/
QUESTION
On an ext2 filesystem, a running daemon has created a large logfile
that is beginning to fill the disk. After deleting the file with an “rm-
f” command as root, “df” shows that the space is still in use even
though the file is not shown using “ls”. To reclaim this space you
must:
1
Restart the daemon.
2
Unmount and remount the filesystem.
3
Use sync.
4
Recreate the file.
5
Run fsck.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: If you have a daemon which writes a log file and keeps
that file open for writing then removing the file will not free up the
disk space. The filesystem still sees the program as having a refer-
ence to it. Therefore the filesystem will not free up that disk space.
The only way to free the space is to restart the daemon Reference:
http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-fileutils/2001-February/001495.html
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
17
1
B:Unmounting and remounting the filesystem is unnecessary\
2
and may not free the space.
3
C:Sync is used to write the buffers to disk. It will not \
4
free the space.
5
D:Recreating the file will not free the space because the\
6
daemon has a reference to the old file.
7
E:Fsck is a file system checking tool. It won’t free the \
8
space because it won’t recognize it as corrupted.
QUESTION
While checking the logfiles on your log server, you notice that
all client machines are showing up by IP address rather than by
hostname, although DNS is configured and running. How would
you ensure that host entries show by name rather than by IP?
1
Restart named and then syslogd on the log server.
2
Add the central logging server to all inbound logging hos\
3
ts’ /etc/hosts.
4
Recompile syslogd to add remote logging support.
5
Restart syslogd on the inbound logging clients to force D\
6
NS resolution.
7
Add all inbound logging hosts to /etc/hosts on the log se\
8
rver, then restart syslogd.
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: I don’t know why the DNS resolution isn’t working
for the syslog daemon. It could be that there are lots of log entries
and that the DNS requests are timing out. Therefore, adding the
inbound logging hosts to /etc/hosts on the log server will enable
local hostname resolution, thus negating the need to use DNS.
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
18
1
A:The question states that DNS is configured and running \
2
and therefore does not need to be restarted.
3
B:This won’t work. The clients are able to contact the lo\
4
gging server. Adding the central logging server to
5
all inbound logging hosts’ /etc/hosts files won’t affect \
6
how the logging server records the log entries.
7
C:Remote logging support is already enabled because the I\
8
P addresses are being logged.
9
D:DNS resolution needs to be forced on the server, not th\
10
e clients.

20
1
A. at –l
2
B. at –q
3
C. at –d
4
D. atwho
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The at –l command is the same as the atq command.
It will list the user’s pending jobs, unless the user is a privi-
leged user; in which case, everybody’s jobs are listed Reference:
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/a/at.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The –q option is used to place the job in a specified q\
2
ueue. It does not display who has scheduled jobs.

QUESTION
You want to create a compressed backup of the users home direc-
tories. What utility should you use?
Correct Answer: tar
Explanation: The tar utility is used to archive multiple files into
one ‘tarball’. The –z option invokes another utility called gzip and
instructs it to compress the files before tar archives them. Reference:
http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/t/tar.html
QUESTION
You are covering for another system administrator and one of the
users asks you to restore a file for him. You locate the correct tarfile

Part I

by checking the backup log but you do not know how the directory
structure was stored. What command can you use to determine
this?
1
tar fx tarfile dirname
2
tar tvf tarfile filename
3
tar ctf tarfile
4
tar tvf tarfile
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: You can list the contents of a ‘tarball’ with the tar tvf
tarfile command. The t option is used to list the files and directories.
The v option runs the command in verbose mode. The f option
allows you to specify the name of the tarball (a tarball is a common
name for an archive created with the tar utility) with the f <file-
name> option. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/t/tar.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The syntax of this command is wrong. The x must come be\
2
fore the f. This also does not list the contents
3
of the file.
4
B:This command would list the path to ‘filename’. Althoug\
5
h this would be required information to restore a
6
file, the question states that you want to view the direc\
7
tory structure.

location. Having a backup copy of a file is always recommended.
QUESTION
When planning your backup strategy you need to consider how
often you will perform a backup, how much time the backup takes
and what media you will use. What other factor must you consider
when planning your backup strategy?
Correct Answer: what to backup
Explanation: The first thing to consider when planning a backup
strategy is what you are going to back up. Then you can think about
the amount of data this will be. This will affect your other decisions
such as what media to use etc.
QUESTION
What key combination can you press to suspend a running job and
place it in the background?
Correct Answer: ctrl-z
Explanation: You can suspend a currently running job by us-
ing the Ctrl + z keystroke. This will stop the job, but it won’t
end it. The job will be available to be resumed. Note: you can
only stop jobs that were started in your current shell. Reference:

QUESTION
Using command substitution, how would you display the value of
the present working directory?

Part I
23
1
echo $(pwd)
2
echo pwd
3
$pwd
4
pwd | echo
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The echo command can be used to display the con-
tents of variables. The present working directory is held in the
pwd variable. Echo $(pwd) will display the contents of the pwd
variable. Other commands that would work are echo $ PWD and
echo “$PWD”. Reference: http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/ksh-be-
foreyoustart.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:Echo pwd would display the text ‘pwd’.
2
C:$pwd doesn’t do anything although $PWD would work.

D:pwd | echo doesn’t do anything.
QUESTION
Every time you attempt to delete a file using the rm utility, the
operating system prompts you for confirmation. You know that this
is not the customary behavior for the rm command. What is wrong?
1
rm has been aliased as rm –i
2
The version of rm installed on your system is incorrect.
3
This is the normal behavior of the newest version of rm.
4
There is an incorrect link on your system.
Correct Answer: A

Part I
24
Explanation: The –i option with the rm command runs the com-
mand in ‘interactive’ mode. This will cause rm to prompt you for
the deletion of a file. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/r/rm.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The fact that rm is prompting for a confirmation indica\
2
tes that the version of rm is compatible with your

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Tab completion is where you can type the first few
letters of a command or filename then press tab to automatically
complete the command or filename. You need to type enough letters
so that there is only one command or filename starting with those
letters. In this question you could type v then i then space then

D:You need a minimum of 6 keystrokes, not 4.
QUESTION
After typing in a new command and pressing enter, you receive
an error message indicating incorrect syntax. This error message
originated from?
1
The shell.
2
The operating system.
3
The command.
4
The kernel.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: When you run a ‘command’ you are actually instruct-
ing the shell to run a program. If the shell can find the program,
it will run it. The shell knows how to start the program, but it
doesn’t know the syntax of the program/command. If you get an
error saying ‘incorrect syntax’, the error will be coming from the
program.
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
26
1
A:The shell knows how to start the program, but it doesn’\
2
t know the syntax of the program/command. A
3
shell error message would be for example, ‘<command>: Com\
4
mand not found.’.
5
B:The operating system runs the shell. It doesn’t know ab\
6
out specific commands.

D:The kernel is effectively the operating system. It does\
8
n’t know about specific commands.
QUESTION
A single machine acts as a mail server, web server, and gateway to
the Internet for the rest of your internal network. Why shouldn’t
you also use this machine as your central log host?
It may reduce web server performance. The remote logging may
have a negative impact on network performance. If the web server
crashed, log messages from other hosts would be lost. Under high
load, syslogd on the web server may start rejecting messages,
and clients would try to log the error, creating a recursive loop
between the clients and the log host. If the security of your server
is compromised, an attacker would have access to log information
from all your hosts.
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: You are running three services that connect directly
to the Internet (mail server, web server and gateway). This in itself
poses a security risk. The logs will contain a lot of information that
an attacker would be able to access if the attacker gained access to
your system.
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
27
1
A:The logging may have a minimal effect on the web server\
2
. This is not as much a problem as the security
3
risk in answer
4
B:It is unlikely that the remote logging will have any ne\
5
gative impact on the network performance.
6
C:If the web server crashed you may not be able to access\
7
the logs. However, this is not as much a
8
problem as the security risk in answer
9
D:This just wouldn’t happen.
QUESTION
Which of the following parameters in your smb.conf file specifies
the relationship between Windows/SMB usernames and Linux/U-
NIX usernames?
1
smb usernames = /etc/smbusers
2
username map = /etc/smbusers
3
map usernames = lowercase nospace
4
smb usernames = map to same unix name
usernames map = /etc/windows-usernames.map
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: To map Windows usernames to Linux/UNIX user-
names, you would specify the username map = /etc/smbusers pa-
rameter in the smb.conf file. You would then add mappings for each
user account in the smb.conf file. For example, windows_username
= linux_username. Reference: http://www.mandrakeuser.org/docs/connect/csamba2
Incorrect Answers:

Part I

QUESTION
Assuming modules for all supported filesystems have been loaded,
which file contains a list of filesystems that can be currently
mounted on the system?
1
/proc/filesystems
2
/dev/filesystems
3
/etc/filesystems
4
/var/fs/filesystems
5
/etc/config/filesystems
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: In the file /proc/filesystems you can find which filesys-
tems your kernel currently supports. (If you need a currently
unsupported one, you’ll need to insert the corresponding module
or recompile the kernel.) Reference: http://www.fifi.org/cgi-bin/-

QUESTION
An ext2 filesystem is used by an application that frequently reads
a large number of small files. Performance can be improved by
mounting the filesystem with the _________ option.
1
atime
2
noatime
3
noexec
4
nosuid
5
sync
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Linux records information about when files were
created and last modified as well as when it was last accessed.
There is a cost associated with recording the last access time.
The ext2 file system of Linux has an attribute that allows the
super-user to mark individual files such that their last access time
is not recorded. This may lead to significant performance im-
provements on often accessed frequently changing files. Reference:

Part I
30
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/solrhe/Securing-Optimizing-Linux-RH-Edition-
v1.3/chap6sec73.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The atime option will record the last access time for e\
2
ach file which may degrade system performance.
3
C:Noexec is a mount flag to not allow any executables to \
4
be run from the filesystem. This won’t work since
5
the files are likely to be text files.
6
D:Nosuid is a mount flag to disallow any setuid binaries \
7
on the filesystem. This will not improve system
8
performance.
9
E:The sync command is used to write the buffers to disk. \
10
This will not improve system performance.
QUESTION
You decide to use the logical volume manager (LVM) to manage
four 4GB disk drives. After creating the volume group, how would
you create a 10GB logical volume called big-app?
1
vgcreate –p 10g –n /deb/vg01/big-app
2
vgcreate –l 2560 /dev/vg01/big-app
3
mklvm –v 10240 –n /dev/vg01/big-app
4
lvcreate –v 10240 /dev/vg01/big-app
5
lvcreate –l 2560 vg01 –n big-app
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: When you create a volume group, it will have a
physical extent size of 4MB by default, unless otherwise speci-
fied. When you add disks to the volume group, the disk space
is divided into chunks equal to the physical extent size (4MB
by default). When you create a logical volume with the lvcreate

Part I
31
command, the –l option is used to specify the size of the log-
ical drive in ‘logical extents’. The logical extents are the same
size as the physical extents. Therefore, to create a 10GB logi-
cal drive, you would specify 2560 logical extents (2560 x 4MB
= 10GB). Vg01 is the name of the volume group in which to
create the logical volume. The –n option allows you to enter a
name for the logical volume. In this case ‘big-app’. Reference:
http://devresource.hp.com/STKLI/man/11iv1.5/lvcreate_1m.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The vgcreate command is used to create the volume group.
2
B:The vgcreate command is used to create the volume group.
3
C:Mklvm is an invalid command.
4
D:-v is an incorrect option to create a logical volume.
QUESTION
You maintain daily backups of a large file, as well as calculating an
MD5 checksum with md5sum. When verifying the contents of one
such backup, you notice that the new checksum is different from
the previous one by only one byte. What does this tell you about
the contents of the file?
1
A single character in the original file has been modified.
2
1/32nd of the original file has been modified.
3
1/128th of the original file has been modified.
4
It tells you that the original file has been modified.
The contents of the file are in reverse order from the original.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The MD5 (Message Digest number 5) value for a file
is a 128-bit value similar to a checksum. This value is calculated

Part I
32
according to the contents of a file. If a file has changed, the
MD5/checksum value will be different. Reference: http://www.iay.pwp.blueyonder.co
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:A different checksum means that the file has changed.
2
the file has changed.
3
B:A different checksum means that the file has changed.
4
the file has changed.
5
C:A different checksum means that the file has changed.
6
the file has changed.
7
E:A different checksum means that the file has changed.
8
the file has changed.
QUESTION
You are creating a script with demands that the previous command
execute correctly. How would you correctly test the exit status of
the previous command in BASH?
1
if [ “$#” –eq “0” ]; then`
2
if [ “$?” –eq “0” ]; then`
3
if [ ‘$#’ == 0 ]; then`
4
if [ ‘$?’ == ‘0’]; then`
5
if [ $@ -eq 0 ]; then`
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The variable “$?” checks the exit status of the last
command run. The –eq “0” statement is used to check whether
a condition is true. The statement if [ “$?” –eq “0” ]; then‘ will
check that the last command executed correctly and run the next
part of the script. Reference: http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/ksh-
basics.html
Incorrect Answers:

Part I
33
1
A:The variable is “$?” not “$#”.
2
C:The variable is “$?” not “$#”.
3
D:The variable is “$?” not ‘$?’ (double quotes, not singl\
4
e quotes).
5
E:The variable is “$?” not $@.
QUESTION
You are having problems with programs crashing on an SMP
system, and would like to run your system in non-SMP mode for
troubleshooting purposes. What is the correct parameter to pass to
the kernel at boot time to force it to use a single CPU?
block-cpu-1 cpucount=1 disable-cpu nosmp enable_smp=no
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The nosmp option can be used at boot time to disable
SMP (symmetric multiprocessing), thus causing the system to run
in uniprocessor (single processor) mode.
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:This in an incorrect option.
2
B:Cpucount=1 will run one processor, but the single proce\
3
ssor will run in SMP mode. Cpucount=0 will run
4
no processors in SMP mode effectively disabling SMP.
5
C:Disable-cpu in an incorrect option.
6
E:enable_smp=no is an incorrect option.
QUESTION
You want to export a local file system /data, and permit read-write
access for all users on hostA. In addition, the root account on hostA

Part I
34
should be allowed root level access. All other hosts are to have read-
only access. Which of the following /etc/exports lines would you
use?
1
/data hostA(rw,no_root_squash) (ro)
2
/data hostA(allow_root) –ro
3
/data –ro,rw=hostA(root)
4
/data hostA=rw,root *=ro
5
/data hostA(rw,all_squash,anonid=0) @all(ro)
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The format of the /etc/exports lines is ‘directoryname
hostname(options)’. In this case you are exporting the /data direc-
tory. HostA has the (rw,no_root_squash) permissions applied and
everyone else gets the (ro) permission. The rw permission allows
HostA read/write permissions. The no_root_squash option gives
the root account on HostA root access to the /data directory. Every-
one else gets the ro permission which means read only. Reference:
http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/usersguide/linux_ugnfs.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The option to allow root access is no_root_squash, not \
2
allow_root.
3
C:The syntax in this answer is incorrect.
4
D:The syntax in this answer is incorrect.
5
E:The syntax in this answer is incorrect.

QUESTION
Several of your users have been scheduling large at jobs to run dur-
ing peak load times. How can you prevent anyone from scheduling
an at job?
1
Delete the file /etc/at.deny
2
Create an empty file called /etc/at.deny
3
Create two empty files: /etc/at.deny and /etc/at.allow
4
Create an empty file called /etc/at.allow
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The /etc/at.allow and the /etc/at.deny files are used
to control who is allowed to run the ‘at’ command. If the file
/etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed
to use the ‘at’ command, and the /etc/at.deny file is ignored. Refer-
ence: http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/man/man5/at.deny.5.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:The /etc/at.allow file is read before the /etc/at.deny \
2
file. If an /etc/at.allow file exists, any names in that \
3
file
4
will be able to use the ‘at’ command’. Deleting the /etc/\
5
at.deny file may work, but only if no /etc/at.allow file
6
exists.
7
B:An empty file called /etc/at.deny is the default on a L\
8
inux system and allows anyone to use the ‘at’
9
command.
10
C:Creating two empty files: /etc/at.deny and /etc/at.allo\

Part I

11
w would also work because an empty /etc/at.allow
12
file would prevent the use of the ‘at’ command. However, \
13
it is unnecessary to create both files.
QUESTION
You want to create a compressed backup of the users home direc-
tories so you can issue the command gzip /home/* backup.gz but it
fails. The reason it failed is that gzip will only compress one ____ at
a time.
Correct Answer: file
Explanation: The command: gzip <filename> backup.gz will com-
press <filename> and rename it to backup.gz. This only works with
a single file. To compress multiple files into one file (archive), you
should use the tar utility with the z option. Tar can archive multiple
files into a single file (archive). The z option causes tar to use gzip to
compress the files first. Reference: http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/g/gzip.htm
QUESTION
You need to view the contents of the tarfile called MyBackup.tar.
What command would you use?
Correct Answer: tar tf MyBackup.tar -or- tar -tf MyBackup.tar
Answer: tar -tf MyBackup.tar Explanation: You can list the contents
of a ‘tarball’ with the ‘tar tf tarfile’ command. The t option is used
to list the files and directories. The f option allows you to specify
the name of the tarball (a tarball is a common name for an archive
created with the tar utility) with the f <filename> option. Reference:

QUESTION
When you back up only the files that have changed since the last
backup, this is called a _______ backup. A. Partial
1
B. Differential
2
C. Full
3
D. Copy
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: When you run a full backup, the files are marked as
having been backed up (the archive attribute is cleared). When
a file is created or changed, it is marked as ‘not backed up’ (the
archive attribute is set). A differential backup backs up any files
created or changed since the last full backup (the files marked as
‘not backed up’). It does not mark files as having been backed up
(in other words, the archive attribute is not cleared). Reference:
http://www.raid-unix-mac-disk-datarecovery-service.com/diferential_-

QUESTION
You have been given the job of administering a new server. It houses
a database used by the sales people. This information is changed

Part I
38
frequently and is not duplicated anywhere else. What should you
do to ensure that this information is not lost?
Create a backup strategy that includes backing up this information
at least daily. Prepare a proposal to purchase a backup server.
Recommend that the server be made part of a cluster. Install an
additional hard drive in the server.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: To ensure that data isn’t lost, it should be backed up.
The question states that the information is changed frequently, so
it should be backed up frequently.
Incorrect Answers:
B:A backup server usually runs backup software. This may not be
necessary and is no use without a backup strategy. C:Clustering
the server would require additional servers and would be very
expensive. Furthermore, depending on the type of cluster, you
may only have one set of hard disks containing the information.
D:Installing an additional hard drive would only work if the data
was regularly backed up to the additional hard drive. However, if
the server failed, the data would still be unavailable.
QUESTION
What utility can you use to show a dynamic listing of running
processes?
Correct Answer: top
Explanation: The ‘top’ command is used to provide information
(frequently refreshed) about the most CPUintensive processes cur-
rently running. The ‘ps’ command lists all running processes;
however, this information isn’t dynamically refreshed.

QUESTION
You previously ran the find command to locate a particular file. You
want to run that command again. What would be the quickest way
to do this?
1
A. fc –l find <enter>
2
n
3
B. history –l find <enter>
4
history n
5
C. Retype the command
6
D. fc –n find
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The –l option used with the fc command is used to
list the commands saved in the ‘history’. The ‘fc –l find’ command
will display all recent commands starting with the word ‘find’.
After pressing enter, the list is displayed and you can recall the
command by entering the number (n) of the command. Reference:
http://www.computerhope.com/unix/uhistory.htm
Incorrect Answers:
B:The syntax of the ‘history’ command is wrong. C:Whether it
would be quicker to retype the command or not depends on the
name of file you were looking for previously. It is unlikely that
this is a trick question, so the answer would be to use the fc
command. D:The ‘fc –n find’ command would display the recent
‘find’ commands, but without the command numbers. It would not
run the required command.
QUESTION
Which of the following environment variables determines your
working directory at the completion of a successful login?

Part I
40
HOME BASH_ENV PWD BLENDERDIR
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The HOME environment variable determines your
working directory when you log on. This is typically /home/<username>
for a normal user account or the root directory (/) for the root user.
The HOME environment variable also determines the directory you
will be taken to if you enter the ‘cd’ command with no arguments.
Reference: http://www.isu.edu/departments/comcom/unix/workshop/environment.
Incorrect Answers:
B: The BASH_ENV variable is used for non-interactive shells. It
does not determine your working directory when you log on. C:The
PWD variable contains the current working directory. It does not
determine your working directory when you log on. The ‘pwd’
command is used to display the full path to your current directory.
D:The BLENDERDIR variable is used with a piece of software
named ‘Blender’. It does not determine your working directory
when you log on.

1
Change the /etc/inputrc file
2
Change the /etc/profile file
3
Change the ~/.inputrc file
4
Change the ~/.profile file

Another setting that can be changed is the command line ed-
itor. If you want this setting to only affect you, you edit the
file in your home directory (∼/ signifies your home directory).
Reference: http://ctdp.tripod.com/os/linux/howlinuxworks/linux_-
hlkeyprogs.html
Incorrect Answers:
A:The settings in the /etc/inputrc file would affect all users. If you
want this setting to only affect you, you edit the file in your home
directory. B:The default editor is not set in this file. D:The default
editor is not set in this file.
QUESTION
You want to enter a series of commands from the command line.
What would be the quickest way to do this?
Press enter after entering each command and its arguments. Put
them in a script and execute the script. Separate each command
with a semi-colon (;) and press enter after the last command.
Separate each command with a / and press enter after the last
command.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: You can enter multiple commands on one line by sep-
arating them with a semi-colon (;). Pressing enter after the last com-
mand will run the commands. Reference: http://unix.about.com/library/tips/bltip016
Incorrect Answers:
A:Pressing enter after a command will run the command before
you can enter another command. B:A script listing the commands
would work but this isn’t the quickest way of doing it. D:You
need to use semi-colons (;) to separate the commands, not forward
slashes (/).

QUESTION
You have compiled and installed a new kernel on your SCSI based
machine. After installing the new kernel, the boot process stops at
a point with the error “VFS PANIC: Unable to mount root FS.” You
can boot again off the old kernel without any problems. Given that
/etc/modules.conf is correct and that the SCSI controller is selected
as a module in the kernel, what most likely is the cause?
The module failed to build. The new kernel can’t initialize the
SCSI controller. There is no initrd image for the new kernel. SCSI
disk support isn’t enabled in the kernel. SCSI generic support isn’t
enabled in the kernel.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The question states that that the machine is SCSI
based and you can boot to the old kernel. This indicates that the sys-
tem is successfully booting from the SCSI drive (when using the old
kernel). The SCSI controller module needs to be loaded at boot time
before the system is able to mount the root file system. To load the
SCSI controller module at boot time, you need an initrd image for
the new kernel. Reference: http://www.linuxhelp.co.za/RedHat61/rhref/s1-
sysadmin-build-kernel.htm#S2-SYSADMININITRD
Incorrect Answers:
A:It is unlikely that the module failed to build. B:The new kernel
can’t initialize the SCSI controller. However, the reason for this is
most likely to be that there is no initrd image for the new kernel.

QUESTION
The ‘user’ option in /etc/fstab allows a normal user to mount/un-
mount filesystems. When used on removable devices, this can allow
unaudited applications to be made available on your system. For
security reasons, you may wish to disable: The suid bit. Device
nodes. Running of executables. Writing to the mounted filesystem.
Which of the following is a valid /etc/fstab entry which implements
AT LEAST one of these features?
/dev/fd0 /mnt ext2 ro,user,noauto,noexec,nodev 0 0 /dev/cdrom
/mnt iso9660 rw,user,nobin,nosuid,nodev 00 /dev/cdrom /mnt iso9660
ro|user|!dev|!suid|!bin 0 0 /dev/fd0 /mnt vfat rw+user+noexec+nodev+nosuid
0 0 /dev/cdrom /mnt auto ro|user|!auto
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The ‘ro’ option means read only. This means that the
drive can only be mounted in read only mode and therefore, cannot
be written to. The noexec option prevents the running of executable
files. Reference: http://www.humbug.org.au/talks/fstab/fstab_op-
tions.html
Incorrect Answers:
B:The rw option will allow the drive to be mounted in read/write
mode. The question states that writing to the filesystem should be
disabled. C:The options must be separated by commas. Therefore
the syntax in this answer is incorrect. D:The options must be sepa-
rated by commas. Therefore the syntax in this answer is incorrect.
E:The options must be separated by commas. Therefore the syntax
in this answer is incorrect.
QUESTION
You have been asked by your management to come up with a
backup solution that covers not only data loss, but also situations

Part I
44
where the entire system, or building, is destroyed. Your solution
should also protect against data theft. Which of the following plans
provides the most secure redundant backup and storage
solution? A. Once a week, all of your systems receive a full system
backup to tape. Those tapes are stored in a secured location in your
facility. B. Once a week, all of your systems receive an incremental
system backup to tape. Those tapes are stored in a secured location
in remote facility. C. Every night, all of your systems receive an
incremental system backup to tape. Those tapes are stored in a
secured location in a remote facility. D. Every night, all of your
systems receive an incremental system backup to tape, and once
a month, all systems receive a full backup to tape. Those tapes are
stored in a secured remote facility. Once a week, all of your systems
receive a full backup to tape. Twice a month, all of your systems
receive a full backup to CD. The tapes are stored in a secured remote
facility. The CD’s are stored locally.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Your backup strategy should allow for backups to
occur as often as possible. Daily backups are recommended but
this isn’t always possible because the amount of time a full backup
would take. For this reason, daily incremental backups are recom-
mended. An incremental backup will only backup the files that
have been created or changed since the last backup, thus saving
time and backup media space. You should however perform full
backups on a regular basis (monthly is recommended). This will
allow the easy restoration of a failed system. The backup tapes
should be stored in a secured remote facility, in case the building is
destroyed.

QUESTION
Which of the following daemons must be running on an NFS
server?
1
portmap
2
nfsiod
3
nfsd
4
xinetd
5
mountd
Correct Answer: ACE
Explanation: If you want to provide NFS service to other hosts,
you have to run the rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd daemons on your
machine. As RPC-based programs, they are not managed by inetd,
but are started up at boot time and register themselves with the
portmapper; therefore, you have to make sure to start them only
after rpc.portmap is running. Portmap provides port information to
clients requesting RPC services on the server. Mountd determines
which filesystem and devices are available to which machine

and users. Nfsd is the daemon on the server that handles client
filesystem requests.

QUESTION
Which process had the Process ID number 1?
1
bash
2
kernel

init
4
it varies
5
none
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: As with files, all processes that run on a GNU/Linux
system are organized in the form of a tree. The root of this tree is
init. Each process has a number (its PID, Process ID), together with
the number of its parent process (PPID, Parent Process ID). The
PID of init is 1, and so is its PPID: init is its own father. Reference:

QUESTION
For a change to the primary Samba configuration file smb.conf to
take effect, it is necessary to:
1
Restart the smbd and nmbd processes.
2
Send a HUP signal to the smbd and nmbd processes.
3
Do nothing.
4
Reboot the system.
5
Restart the Samba subsystem.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Whenever you make changes to the smb.conf file, it is
necessary to restart the smbd and nmbd processes. Smbd regularly
reads the smb.conf file and implements any changes. However,
these changes don’t affect any previously established connections.
To apply the changes to any previously established connections,
you must restart smbd and nmbd. Reference: http://us2.samba.org/samba/ftp/cvs_-

QUESTION
After installing a package using dpkg, you find that the package
manager tools no longer function. You isolate the problem to a
broken library and you have a copy of the fixed library in a Debian
.deb file. How can you extract files from a .deb file without using
the Debian package manager?
1
A. deb packages are compressed tar files with custom scri\
2
pts.
3
Use GNU ‘tar’ to extract the file.
4
B. deb packages are redhat (rpm) packages with different \
5
fields.
6
Use ‘rpm’ to extract the file.
7
C. deb packages are simply gziped cpio files.
8
Use ‘gunzip’ to decompress the package and then use ‘cpio\
9
’ to extract the file.
10
D. deb packages use a proprietary format and the file can\
11
not be extracted without specialized tools.
12
deb packages are ar archives with a special magic number.
13
Use ‘ar’ to extract the data member and then use GNU ‘tar\
14
’ to extract the file.

Part I
49
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: Debian archive (.deb) files can be parsed and manip-
ulated by the utility ar. The precise contents of Debian archive files
changed since Debian 0.93. The new contents are understood by
versions of the primary package tool, dpkg, later than 0.93.76, and
is described in the “deb”(5) man page. The old format is described
in “deb-old”(5). Using the command ar -t foo_VVV-RRR.deb, you’ll
see that a Debian archive file contains these members: debian-
binary: Contains one or more lines; currently it contains only
one line giving the version number (2.0) of the Debian pack-
age format. control.tar.gz: A compressed (gzip’d) tar file which
contains the Debian control files for this package. (Confusingly,
one of these files, and the only one which is required, is itself
named control.) data.tar.gz: A compressed (gzip’d) tar file which
contains the executables, libraries, documentation, etc., associated
with this package. In other words, this component is the filesys-
tem data part of a Debian package. You can extract files from
the .tar.gz files using the ‘tar’ utility. Reference: http://flits102-
126.flits.rug.nl/∼erik/debian/debian-faq-6.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:You must first use the ‘ar’ utility to open the .deb fi\

le. Then you can use ‘tar’ to extract the required files.
3
B:.deb files are not rpm (redhat package manager) files, \
4
and therefore cannot be opened with the rpm

C:.deb packages are not gziped cpio files, and therefore \

/etc/auto.debian with /etc/auto.debian containing debian:rw,soft,intr:ftp.example-
debian.org::/pub/debian
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Autofs uses the automount daemon to manage your
mount points by only mounting them dynamically when they
are accessed. Autofs consults the master map configuration file
/etc/auto.master to determine which mount points are defined. It
then starts an automount process with the appropriate parameters
for each mount point. Each line in the master map defines a
mount point and a separate map file that defines the filesys-
tems to be mounted under this mount point. In this question,
the /etc/auto.master file would contain the line “/usr/local/debian
/etc/auto.debian”. /usr/ local/debian is the mount point on the local
machine. /etc/auto.debian is the name of the map file that defines
what should be mounted at the mount point. The /etc/auto.debian

Part I
51
file should contain “debian-ro,soft,intr:ftp.example-debian.org:/pub/debian”.
This contains the mount point (debian), followed by some mount
options (ro,soft,intr) followed by the directory to be mounted in the
form of hostname:directory (ftp.example-debian.org:/pub/debian).

1
cpio
2
cp
3
mv
4
mvdir
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The ‘cp’ command is used to copy files or directories

Full
3
Partial
4
Copy

Part I

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: If you are backing up just one partition and not the
entire system, you are backing up only ‘part’ of the system. This is
therefore a partial backup.
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:A differential backup backs up all files that have been\
2
changed or created since the last full or
3
incremental backup. A differential backup does not descri\
4
be what portion of a system was backed up.
5
B:A full backup backs up all the specified files. A full \
6
backup does not describe what portion of a system
7
was backed up.
8
D:A copy backup backs up all the specified files. The dif\
9
ference between a full backup and a copy backup
is that a full backup marks the files as having been backed up,
whereas a copy backup doesn’t. A copy backup does not describe
what portion of a system was backed up.

around to the left. Which of the following key combinations would
achieve this?
1
Esc, /, Enter

/project/etc/auto.project /datayp:data.map If you change the con-
tents of /etc/auto.project to include a new source path what must
be done to access the new path?
1
Shutdown and restart the local NFS client daemons.
2
Run fsck on the affected mount point.
3
Issue the /etc/init.d/autofs reload command.
4
Add the newly mapped path to /etc/fstab.
5
Nothing, simply access the newly mapped resource.
Correct Answer: E
Explanation: Autofs uses the automount daemon to manage your
mount points by only mounting them dynamically when they
are accessed. Autofs consults the master map configuration file
/etc/auto.master to determine which mount points are defined. It
then starts an automount process with the appropriate parameters
for each mount point. Each line in the master map defines a mount
point and a separate map
file that defines the filesystems to be mounted under this mount
point. For example, the /etc/auto.misc file might define mount
points in the /misc directory; this relationship would be defined
in the /etc/auto.master file. Each entry in auto.master has three
fields. The first field is the mount point. The second field is
the location of the map file, and the third field is optional. The
third field can contain information such as a timeout value. If

Part I
58
the source path changes, you can access the new path with-
out changing anything because the mount points are mounted
and unmounted dynamically when accessed or closed. Reference:

QUESTION
You have added a new file system to /etc/exports, but users com-
plian that they still get “Permission denied” errors when they try
to mount the new file system. Which of the following is the best
solution to this problem?
Reboot the server. Add the option (no_root_squash) to the entry
already added. Restart NFS. Run the command exportfs –a Run the
command export –nfs.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The exportfs command makes local directories avail-
able for Network File System (NFS) clients to mount. This com-
mand is normally invoked during system startup by the /etc/rc.nfsfile
and uses information in the /etc/exports file to export one or
more directories, which must be specified with full path names.
The /etc/xtab file lists directories that are currently exported.
To display this file, enter the exportfs command without flags
or arguments. To alter the file or to alter the characteristics of
one of its directories, root users can edit the /etc/exports file
and run the exportfs command. The –a option exports all di-
rectories listed in the /etc/exports file. Such alterations can be
done at any time. Never edit the /etc/xtab file directly. Reference:

/tmp
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The /usr partition contains common executables and
documents such as man pages (help files), all of which should not
be changed by users. Therefore, this partition should be mounted as
read only. Reference: http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-

QUESTION
You have installed a new application but when you type in the
command to start it you get the error message: Command not found
What do you need to do to fix this problem?
Add the directory containing the application to your path. Specify
the directory’s name whenever you run the application. Verify that
the execute permission has been applied to the command. Give
everyone read, write and execute permissions to the application’s
directory.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: One important environment variable is PATH, a list of
directories separated by colons (‘:’). These directories are searched
through to find commands. If you try to invoke command ‘foo’, all
the
directories in PATH (in that order) are searched for an executable
file ‘foo’ (one with x-bit on). If a file is found, it is executed.

QUESTION
You typed the following at the command line: ls –al /home/ hadden
What key strokes would you enter to remove the space between the
‘/’ and ‘hadden’ without having to retype the entire line?
1
Ctrl-B, Del
2
Esc-b, Del
3
Esc-Del, Del
4
Ctrl-b, Del
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The Esc-b keystroke combination will move the curser
back one word (to the start of the word ‘hadden’). The Del keystroke
will delete the previous character; in this case, it will delete the
space before the word ‘hadden’. Reference: http://sseti.udg.es/marga/books/O’Reilly-

QUESTION
When setting up a client to log to a central logging server, you
should:
Start the syslogd daemon on the server with all of the clients
in its hostlist. Add @servername to the appropriate log line in

Part I
68
/etc/syslog.conf Use the server as a DHCP server for the client.
Share the log file on the server using NFS. None of the above.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The file /etc/syslog.conf contains information used
by the system log daemon, syslogd to forward a system message
to appropriate log files and/or users. When forwarding messages
to a remote logging server, you would specify the name of a
remote host, prefixed with an @, as with: @server, which indi-
cates that messages are to be forwarded to the syslogd on the
named host. Reference: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/man-
cgi?syslog.conf+4
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The syslogd daemon on the local machine needs to be con\
2
figured to send messages to the remote
3
logging server.
4
C:DHCP is unrelated to logging and is therefore not requi\
5
red.

QUESTION
You have been asked to block network access to an NFS sever. You
need to block all access except NFS access. Which of the following
actions would you take to achieve this?

Part I
69
1
Make sure that xinetd is switched off.
2
Place “ALL: ALL” in /etc/hosts.deny and “NFS: ALL” in /et\
3
c/hosts.allow
4
Add IPChains rules to deny all incoming packets except fo\
5
r portmapper
6
Place “ALL: ALL” in /etc/hosts.deny and “portmap: ALL” in\
7
/etc/hosts.allow
8
Ensure that the nfs-access.o module is configured into th\
9
e kernel and use the command “nfs-ctl-allow
10
<your IP range>” to provide the required access
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The hosts.allow file is read before the hosts.deny file.
This means that you can block access to ‘all’ in the hosts.deny file,
but allow access to specific ports by specific hosts in the hosts.allow
file. In this answer, we are blocking all ports to all hosts in the
hosts.deny file. However, we are allowing access to the portmap
service for all hosts in the hosts.allow file. (The portmap service is
for access to NFS). Reference: http://www.mandrakeuser.org/docs/connect/cnfs2.htm
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:Xinetd must be running.
2
B:NFS uses the portmapper service. Therefore, you should \
3
enter ‘portmap: ALL’ in the hosts.allow file.
4
C:IPChains is a firewall program. This may work (if you h\
5
ave IPChains running), however using the
6
hosts.allow and hosts.deny files is much simpler.
7
E:The module and command in this question don’t exist or \

are incorrectly named.
QUESTION
What command would you type to use the cpio command to create
a backup called backup.cpio of all the users home directories?

Part I
70
Correct Answer: find /home | cpio –o > backup.cpio
Explanation: The cpio command expects to receive a list that
contains one file per line. That is exactly the type of list that the
find utility creates. The ls utility can also create this type of list,
meaning that you will see either of the ls or the find utilities used
in conjunction with cpio. And since cpio archives a list of files it
receives from standard input, you usually use a pipe (|) whenever
you create an archive with the cpio utility. A lot of documentation
suggests using the –print option with the find command. For
example, find /home print | cpio –o > backup.cpio. However, this
is not required on Linux systems, and other systems that use
GNU find, although it is required on Unix systems. Reference:
http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/aix/cmds/aixcmds1/cpio.htm
QUESTION
What is wrong with the following command? tar cvfb //dev/tape
20
1
You cannot use the c option with the b option.
2
The correct command should be tar –cvfb /dev/tape20.
3
The arguments are not in the same order as the correspond\
4
ing modifiers.
5
The files to be backed up have not been specified.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The command should read tar cvfb /dev/tape 20 / .
The letters c, v, f and b are the ‘modifiers’. The arguments are the
options for the modifiers and should be in the same order as the
modifiers. The c modifier is to create an archive. The v modifier
is for verbose mode. The f modifier specifies the name of the tar
file and so needs an ‘argument’ (in this case a tape drive called
/dev/tape). The b modifier is used to set a block size and so needs an

Part I
71
‘argument’ (in this case 20). Note that the arguments following the
modifiers are in the same order as the modifier. The “f” precedes
the “b” modifier so the arguments have the device before the
blocking factor. The arguments must be in the same order as the
modifiers, which can sometimes cause a little confusion. After the
modifiers and arguments have been entered, you need to enter
the files to be backed up (in this case the root directory ‘/’). Ref-
erence: http://freebooks.boom.ru/view/LinuxUnleashed/ch45/759-
762.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
A:You can use the c option with the b option.
2
B:You don’t need a hyphen (-) when specifying tar options\
3
. Furthermore, the files to be backed up haven’t
4
been specified.

place.
QUESTION
Many factors are taken into account when planning a backup
strategy. The one most important one is how often does the file

QUESTION
In order to create a file called DirContents containing the contents
of the /etc directory you would type _______.
Correct Answer: ls /etc > DirContents
Explanation: Mostly all commands send their output to the screen
or take input from the keyboard, but in Linux it is possible to send
output to a file or to read input from a file. For example, the ls
command sends it’s output to screen; to send the output to a file,
you can use the command ls > filename. This will send the output of
the ls command to filename. In this question, the ls command lists
the contents of the /etc directory and sends the list to a file named
DirContents. Reference: http://www.netti.hu/doc/LinuxShellScript/rpf.htm
QUESTION
You are running out of space in your home directory. While looking
for files to delete or compress you find a large file called .bash_-

Part I
73
history and delete it. A few days later, it is back and as large as
before. What do you need to do to ensure that its size is smaller?
1
Set the HISTFILESIZE variable to a smaller number.
2
Set the HISTSIZE to a smaller number.
3
Set the NOHISTFILE variable to true.
4
Set the HISTAPPEND variable to true.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The bash_history file is a file in a user’s home direc-
tory that contains a list of the (recent) commands issued by this user
at the bash command line. This file can grow to up to the number of
lines specified in the HISTFILESIZE variable; therefore, to reduce
the maximum size of the file, you should set
the HISTFILESIZE variable to a smaller number. Reference: http://www.slug-
vt.org/bash.html
Incorrect Answers:
1
B:The HISTSIZE variable contains the number of commands i\
2
n the history. When a user logs off, the
3
commands are written to the bash_history file.
4
C:There is no NOHISTFILE variable.
5
D:If the HISTAPPEND variable is set to true, the history \
6
will be appended to the history file (bash_history),
7
otherwise the file will be overwritten. Therefore, settin\
8
g the HISTAPPEND variable to false, not true would

work.
QUESTION
You would like to temporarily change your command line editor to
be vi. What command should you type to change it?

Part I

Correct Answer: set –o vi
Explanation: The readline support in the bash shell defaults to
emacs editing mode. You can easily switch that to vi mode by
issuing the following command: set -o vi. This will last until you
logoff. The next time you log on, the default editing mode will be
used. Reference: http://www.portico.org/index.php3?catList=26
QUESTION
Which of the following interprets your actions when typing at the
command line for the operating system?
1
Utility
2
Application
3
Shell
4
Command
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The “shell” is another name for the command shell
or command interpreter. This is the program that gives you a
command prompt, accepts the commands you type there, and
basically makes the computer do what you tell it to. The shell’s job
is to interpret your commands and run the programs you request.
Linux was designed to be a multitasking operating system, which
means you can run more than one program at one time. Linux was
also designed as a multi-user OS, which means that you can have
more than one shell running at the same time. (Each user gets his
own shell at login.) As a user, you have access only to the programs
you are running, not the ones other users are running (though you
can run your own copy of the same program). The programs are
kept separate because they are “enclosed” in a “shell”. Reference:
http://www.control-escape.com/lx-shell.html

QUESTION
You have created a local ext2 file system on the third partition
of your first IDE disk drive. You want to facilitate easy manual
mounting but you DO NOT wish the filesystem to be automatically
mounted at a boot. What is the correct /etc/fstab entry?
1
/dev/hda3/newfilesystem ext2 noboot 0 1
2
/newfilesystem /dev/hda3 ext2 defaults 0 1
3
/newfilesystem ext2 /dev/hda3 user 0 1
4
/dev/hda3/newfilesystem ext2 noauto 0 1
5
/dev/hda3 ext2 /newfilesystem defaults 0 –1
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: /dev/hda3 indicates the 3rd partition on the first IDE
hard disk (hda). Ext2 indicates the filesystem type. Noauto means
that the filesystem will not be automatically mounted. The first ‘0’
means that the filesystem shouldn’t be backed up and the 1 means
that the filesystem should be checked for errors when the machine
boots. Reference: http://www.humbug.org.au/talks/fstab/fstab_op-

QUESTION
The command ______ flushes the filesystem buffers and ensures
that the changes that you have made to a file are written to disk.
Correct Answer: sync
Explanation: The sync command is used to flush the filesystem
buffers and ensures that the changes that you have made to a

system runs the sync command to flush the buffers to disk, but
the command can be manually entered at any time. Reference:

device couldn’t be mounted or informing that init couldn’t be
found. B. An error message is shown and the system reboots
after a keypress. C. An error message is shown and the system
boots in maintenance mode. D. An error message is shown and
the administrator is asked to specify a valid root filesystem to
continue the boot process. An error message is shown, stating that
the corresponding kernel module couldn’t be loaded.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Some Required information to Boot loader is boot par-
tition, root partition, kernel file, initrd image file. If Kernel unable to
mount the / filesystem, it shows error like mount: error 15 mounting

Otherwise, change the values in the kernel image that specify the
RAM disk size (by default located at decimal byte offset 504 in the
kernel), VGA mode (default 506), and root device (default 508). You
must specify the kernel image to be changed, and may specify a
new value and a different offset. Using rdev to change these values
directly in an image file is discouraged. These values can all be set
by a boot loader such as lilo or grub. Options: -r Behave like ramsize.
-v Behave like vidmode. -R Behave like rootflags

You have installed some new libraries, but these are not available
to programs and are not listed by ldconfig –p. What file should the
path to the libraries be added to, before running ldconfig?
Correct Answer: ld.so.conf
Explanation:
ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent
shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command
line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/lib
and /usr/lib). The cache is used by the run-time linker, ld.so or
ld-linux.so. ldconfig checks the header and file names of the li-
braries it encounters when determining which versions should have
their links updated. Some files: /lib/ld.so run-time linker/loader
/etc/ld.so.conf File containing a list of colon, space, tab, newline,
or comma spearated directories in which to search for libraries.
/etc/ld.so.cache File containing an ordered list of libraries found in

QUESTION
The server has two network cards. The driver for the first card is
the module 8139too and the driver for the second card is the module
ne2k-pci. How is it possible to ensure that the card using the 8139too
driver is detected before the card using the ne2k-pci driver?

Part I

QUESTION
What needs to be done to enable 32 bit I/O transfer mode for (E)IDE
disks, on a system running a 2.4 series Linux kernel?

Part I
107
1
The Linux kernel must be recompiled.
2
The sysctl utility must be used.
3
The hdparm utility must be used.
4
This feature isn’t supported in 2.4 series kernels.
This feature is enabled by default in 2.4 series kernels
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: hdparm provides a command line interface to various
hard disk ioctls supported by the stock Linux ATA/ IDE device
driver subsystem. Some options may work correctly only with the
latest kernels. -d Disable/enable the “using_dma” flag for this drive.
This option now works with most combinations of drives and PCI
interfaces which support DMA and which are known to the IDE
driver. It is also a good idea to use the appropriate -X option in
combination with -d1 to ensure that the drive itself is programmed
for the correct DMA mode, although most BIOSs should do this
for you at boot time. Using DMA nearly always gives the best
performance, with fast I/O throughput and low CPU usage. But
there are at least a few configurations of chipsets and drives for
which DMA does not make much of a difference, or may even slow
things down (on really messed up hardware!). Your mileage may
vary.
QUESTION
Which RAID level provides most redundancy?
1
RAID0
2
RAID1
3
RAID4
4
RAID5
Correct Answer: B

Part I
108
Explanation: RAID Level 1 is called mirroring and also requires two
RAID Partitions. The resulting RAID device is virtual partition the
size of the smallest of the member RAID partitions. All RAID parti-
tions which are members of the RAID device contain identical data.
IF any disk in the RAID device fails, the RAID device continues to
function without losing data. This is useful for fault tolerance, but
is costly terms of disk space.
QUESTION
A new PCMCIA network card is not functioning correctly. To
troubleshoot this, the socket information should be checked. How
can this be done? Select two.
1
cardctl info
2
cardctl –s
3
cardmgr –s
4
cat /var/lib/pcmcia/stab
5
cat /proc/pcmcia
Correct Answer: BD
Explanation: Cardmgr monitors PCMCIA sockets for card insertion
and removal events. When a card is inserted, cardmgr looks up the
card in a database of known cards. If the card can be identified,
appropriate device drivers will be loaded and bound to the card.
When a card is ejected, that cards drivers will be shut down
and unloaded if possible. Based on the contents of the PCMCIA
card configuration database, cardmgr may also execute arbitrary
commands when appropriate cards are either inserted or removed.
All insertion and removal events, device driver loads and unloads,
and startup and shutdown commands are reported in the system
log file. Warnings and errors will also be logged. Current card and

QUESTION
The Human Interface Device (HID) is being used, which of the
following represents a USB mouse connected to the PC?
1
/dev/psaux
2
/dev/ttyS0
3
/dev/input/mice
4
/dev/usb/mouse0
5
/dev/ttyUSB0
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on
USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and Mouse Support Do
not turn on USB HIDBP Mouse support. Perform the normal kernel
rebuild and installation steps. If you are installing as modules,
you need to load the input.o, hid.o and mousedev.o modules. Plug
in a USB mouse and check that your mouse has been correctly
sensed by the kernel. If you don’t have a kernel message, look for
the changes to /proc/bus/usb/devices. Since USB supports multiple
identical devices, you can have multiple mice plugged in. You can
get each mouse seperately, or you can get them all mixed together.
You almost always want the mixed version, and that is what will
be used together. You need to set up a device node entry for the
mixed mice. It is customary to create the entries for this device
in the /dev/input/ directory. Use the following commands: mkdir
/dev/input mknod /dev/input/mice c 13 63

QUESTION
One of the IDE hard drives in a server is transferring data very
slowly. What command must be run to enable DMA on it?

Explanation: hdparm provides a command line interface to various
hard disk ioctls supported by the stock Linux ATA/ IDE device
driver subsystem. Some options may work correctly only with the

111
latest kernels. -d Disable/enable the “using_dma” flag for this drive.
This option now works with most combinations of drives and PCI
interfaces which support DMA and which are known to the IDE
driver. It is also a good idea to use the appropriate -X option in
combination with -d1 to ensure that the drive itself is programmed
for the correct DMA mode, although most BIOSs should do this
for you at boot time. Using DMA nearly always gives the best
performance, with fast I/O throughput and low CPU usage. But
there are at least a few configurations of chipsets and drives for
which DMA does not make much of a difference, or may even slow
things down (on really messed up hardware!). Your mileage may
vary.

4
mkisofs –j –T –o backup.iso /home/joe
5
mkisofs –d –T –r –o backup.iso /home/joe
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
mkisofs - create an hybrid ISO9660/JOLIET/HFS filesystem with
optional Rock Ridge attributes. -D Do not use deep directory
relocation, and instead just pack them in the way we see them.
If ISO9660:1999 has not been selected, this violates the ISO9660
standard, but it happens to work on many systems. Use with
caution. -T Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the
CDROM, which can be used on non-Rock Ridge capable systems
to help establish the correct file names. There is also information
present in the file that indicates the major and minor numbers for
block and character devices, and each symlink has the name of the
link file given. -r This is like the -R option, but file ownership and
modes are set to more useful values. The uid and gid are set to zero,
because they are usually only useful on the authorâs system, and
not useful to the client. All the file read bits are set true, so that files
and directories are globally readable on the client. If any execute
bit is set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables
are globally executable on the client. If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client. All write bits are cleared, because the CD-
Rom will be mounted readonly in any case. If any of the special
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only file system, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0. When used on Win32, the execute bit is set on all files. This
is a result of the lack of file permissions on Win32 and the Cygwin
POSIX emulation layer.

Correct Answer: tune2fs
Explanation: tune2fs allows the system administrator to adjust var-
ious tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2/ext3 filesystems.
QUESTION
Which command, with options, could be used to change an ext2 file
system on /dev/hda1 to an ext3 file system?
Correct Answer: tune2fs –j /dev/hda1
Explanation: tune2fs allows the system administrator to adjust var-
ious tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2/ ext3 filesystems.
-j Add an ext3 journal to the filesystem. If the -J option is not
specified, the default journal parameters will be used to create an
appropriately sized journal stored within the filesystem. Note that
you must be using a kernel which has ext3 support in order to
actually make use of the journal.

/etc/auto.mount
3
/etc/automaster
4
/etc/auto.master
5
/etc/automount/mounts
Correct Answer: D
Explanation
Explanation/Reference: Explanation: autofs will consult a config-
uration file /etc/auto.master . The auto.master map is consulted
when the autofs script is invoked to set up the necessary mount
points for the automounter. Each line in this file describes a mount
point and points to another file describing the file systems to
be mounted under this mountpoint. The access to those maps is
governed by a key.

To restore the kernel source to the previous, unpatched, version,
which of the following commands could be used?
1
patch --restore
2
patch --remove
3
patch –U
4
patch --undo
5
patch -R
Correct Answer: E

Part I
126
Explanation: patch takes a patch file patchfile containing a dif-
ference listing produced by the diff program and applies those
differences to one or more original files, producing patched versions
-R or –reverse :Assume that this patch was created with the old
and new files swapped. Patch attempts to swap each hunk around
before applying it. Rejects come out in the swapped format. The -R
option does not work with ed diff scripts because there is too little
information to reconstruct the reverse operation.

QUESTION
A new kernel version needs to be compiled to use a new feature.
If the old kernel configuration file is available, which make target
will only update the configuration file for the new kernel version?
(Please enter only the make target.)
Correct Answer: oldconfig
Not make oldconfig. Would only make the target.

Part I
127
Explanation: oldconfig will read the defaults from an existing
.config and rewrite necessary links and files. Necessary means what
new features are added then the running kernel. Use this option
if you’ve made minor changes to source files or need to script the
rebuild process. Note that oldconfig will only work within the same
major version of the kernel. You cannot, for example, use a 2.4.x
.config with the 2.6.x kernel.
QUESTION
Your newly-compiled kernel can not find any modules it needs to
load. What command was missed when compiling and installing
the kernel?
Correct Answer: make modules_install
Explanation: make modules_install must be run as a root user
because it creates the directory under /lib/ modules/kernel-version
and places all modules to load by kernel. If you forget at kernel-
recompile time, your new kernel doesn’t get the modules to load.
QUESTION
A pre-compiled module has been moved to /lib/modules/<kernel-
version> but ‘modprobe –a <modulename>’ fails to load it. What
needs to be done to enable usage of this module?
1
modules.conf or modprob.conf must be edited.
2
The system must be rebooted.
3
Make modules_install must be run.
4
Depmod must be run.
5
The kernel must be re-compiled.
Correct Answer: D

Part I
128
Explanation: While we load the modules, it checks the dependency
whether loaded or not ? For dependency it checks the modules.dep
file that file should generate by running the depmod command.
Most probably unable to load the modules is due to dependencies.
QUESTION
Which command would you use to apply a diff file to an original?
1
patch > diff-file
2
patch < diff-file
3

4
cat diff-file >> kernel
5
cat diff-file << kernel
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: patch takes a patch file patchfile containing a differ-
ence listing produced by the diff program and applies those dif-
ferences to one or more original files, producing patched versions.
Normally the patched versions are put in place of the originals.
Running patch command by taking input from the diff-file

QUESTION
What script is included with the kernel source to patch a kernel?
1
patch
2
patch-kernel
3
apply-patch
4
update-kernel
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The linux/scripts/patch-kernel is a Perl program that
attempts to automate this process. patch-kernel will deduce the
current source version number and compare this to the patch files
found in the current directory. If higher-version patch files are
found, the script will step through these sequentially upgrading the
sources. Frankly, I have never had much luck with this script, but
your mileage may vary.
