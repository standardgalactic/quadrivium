FED STATE & INSULIN 
Learning Objectives 
•
Identify the major hormones secreted by the    
       pancreas and their cells of origin. 
•
Describe the relationship between blood glucose  
       concentration and insulin secretion. 
•
Identify the major target organs for insulin and its  
       effect on these cells.    
•
Identify disease states caused either by the lack of  
       insulin or by resistance to insulin.  

FUEL HOMEOSTASIS 
Why do we need food? 
- Generate energy for current activities 
- Acquire fuel substrates for energy reserves  
   needed between meals 
- Provide raw materials for cell & tissue turnover 
   and for heat loss 
 
Body energy = energy intake – energy output (mass balance). 
 
Behavioral mechanisms such as hunger and satiety govern 
when and how much is ingested. 

FED STATE   
IS ANABOLIC 
FASTED STATE   
IS CATABOLIC 

Hormones control anabolic versus catabolic pathways.  
This is also regulated by CNS which governs the eating center  
(hypothalamus) to regulate feeding, satiety, and fasting. 
High insulin (or leptin) in blood inhibits feeding.  
 
“Minute to Minute” maintenance = insulin & glucagon 
 
Stress energy = cortisol, epinephrine, glucagon and 
growth hormone 
 
Long term starvation = thyroid hormone  
METABOLIC STATES 

OPPOSING REFLEX LOOPS 

GLUCOSE STIMULATED  
INSULIN SECRETION 
Step 1. Glucose (Glc) entry 
Step 2. Glc trapped as Glc6P 
Step 3. ATP generated 
Step 4. ATP gated K+ channel closes; cell depolarizes 
Step 5. Voltage gated Ca++ channel opens; Ca++ enters 
Step 6. Ca++ release from the internal stores (ER)  
Step 7. Insulin is secreted 
Step 8. Voltage gated K+ channel opens; cell repolarizes.  

BETA CELL REGULATION  

-
Muscle, liver, and adipose tissue 
 
-
Receptor are tyrosine kinases 
 
-    Recruits GLUT 4 (glucose transporter) to the 
cell surface of muscle & fat cells. 
 
-    Increases synthesis of energy stores (fats & 
 
glycogen)

DIABETES MELLITAS (DM)  
“too little glucose inside cells”  
“too much glucose outside cells” 
Type 1 (Insulin Dependent, IDDM)  
 - insulin insufficiency due to destruction of the beta cell 
 - requires insulin replacement therapy 
 
Type 2 (Not Insulin Dependent, NIDDM)  
- insulin insufficiency due to lower response of beta cell   
- insulin receptor resistance in target tissues   
 
 

KEY CONCEPTS 
•
Energy from diet may be used immediately or stored. 
 
•
Hormones control metabolic pathways. Anabolic  
metabolism dominates in the fed state. Catabolic  
Metabolism dominates in the fasting state.  
 
•
Insulin to glucagon ratio regulates “minute to minute”  
metabolism. Insulin promotes fuel storage (anabolism).  
Glucagon promotes fuel mobilization (catabolism).  
 
•
Beta cells secrete insulin.  Secretion is regulated by  
substrate, parasympathetic NS (feed forward) and by  
sympathetic NS (inhibition).    
 
•
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease.  Type I diabetics 
 have insulin insufficiency. Type II diabetics may have insulin  
insufficiency and/or receptor resistance in target tissues.
