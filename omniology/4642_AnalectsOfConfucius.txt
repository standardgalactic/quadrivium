Foreword
T
his guidebook has been prepared by talented writers at The Great 
Courses, and each of its sections summarizes the teachings in the 24 
lectures on Confucius and the Analects. As you begin your study of the 
Analects, however, I wanted to point out a few of the potential pitfalls that can 
appear as you begin to learn more about the text—especially if you consult 
books, articles, and websites in the early phases of your study.
One of the biggest challenges for people new to the Analects is the necessity 
of learning just a little bit of Chinese. It is nearly impossible to study Confucius’s 
thought without becoming familiar with a few key terms. So prominent are 
about a dozen of them in the text of the Analects that it is useful to learn more 
about how they figured in Chinese thought. Indeed, these lectures cover more 
than a dozen of the most important ones.
If seeing Chinese terms looks daunting, let me assure you that it is nothing 
compared to the challenges of reading English translations of those terms. The 
English language is so rich with possibilities for translation from the original 
Chinese text that it can lead to confusion for readers just beginning to 
familiarize themselves with the Analects. As a way of introducing this challenge, 
let me begin with a brief anecdote. When I was preparing these lectures, I 
assigned the draft manuscripts to the students in my seminar about Confucius 
and the Analects at Beloit College. The majority of those students did not know 
Chinese—just like many members of The Great Courses audience. Several 
were so thorough in their work that they read the lecture drafts with websites 
open and several translations of the Analects at their sides.
And then a funny thing happened. They were often perplexed when they 
looked at the different materials—my lecture, a website, and several other 
translations. One comment summed up the confusion very nicely. “I can’t 
understand what is going on. For li, I have seen everything from ‘neighborhood’ 
to ‘ritual,’ and even ‘pattern,’ as well as other English words. I just don’t 
understand what is going on!”

Foreword  vii
The first challenge for the newcomer to Chinese texts lies in being confronted 
by many different meanings for just one sound. For every Chinese sound 
such as li (pronounced “lee”), there are dozens, if not hundreds, of individual 
Chinese characters in a comprehensive dictionary. Most of those characters 
don’t create problems, even for specialists, because they are technical terms. 
The serious challenge for people beginning to study the Analects is that there 
are three or four of those li sounds that can create serious confusion. I have 
tried very hard to make those situations clear in these lectures. In each lecture, 
when I say a sound in Chinese (such as li), I then follow it with the specific 
Chinese character and a translation. In this case, I might say, “Unlike later 
Chinese thinkers, Confucius emphasized ritual conduct (禮 li) more than the 
‘patterns’ manifested in things (理 li).” Although it looks complicated, it will 
become clear as the lectures proceed.
So, in our growing list of challenges, let’s call this first one:
[1] One Sound, Many Meanings
Some things that sound the same have different Chinese 
characters and different meanings. Just a few characters 
used in the Analects with the simple sound of li are: 理, 禮, 
利, 立,  離, and 力, each with very different meanings.
These many meanings lead to a second and far more serious challenge. You 
see, those same readers were bewildered by the number of different ways 
that various translators have used to translate key Chinese terms. The same 
reader who pointed out his difficulty in facing so many li sounds added another 
comment. “I can’t understand how there can be half a dozen or more ways to 
say 孝 xiao. Can’t they just decide on one way and leave it at that? Why do all 
of those different translators have to confuse us?”
Before we proceed to an explanation, let’s add this second challenge to our 
list:

viii  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
[2] Many Translations
Some specific Chinese characters have many possible 
English translations. As an example, 孝 xiao can easily 
be rendered “filial piety,” “family reverence,” and “filial 
conduct,” just to name a few.
In order to explain, let’s take a look at two of the most important concepts in 
Confucius’s Analects. Indeed, I devote the better part of two lectures to each 
concept, and I try to lead listeners to develop a deeper understanding of the 
issues surrounding them.
The first concept is 孝 xiao (pronounced “shh + yow”). Think of its core 
meaning as a child being devoted to parents. Children who are xiao are 
obedient and deferential—but they know how to remind their parents 
when they do something wrong (like throwing recycling into the trash bin 
or driving too fast on city streets). An old but very useful term that figures 
in most translations, even today, is the English word “filial.” I sometimes use 
this translation in these lectures, too. The problem is that “filial” or “filiality” 
alone doesn’t provide the translator (or lecturer) with the breadth of variation 
for showing the range of meaning Confucius seems to present through his 
teachings. For that reason, the earliest translators almost all translated 孝 xiao 
as “filial piety.”
“Piety” sounds a little Victorian, doesn’t it? Furthermore, the word “piety” speaks 
to the very religious focus of many early translators, many of whom were 
missionaries of one kind or another. Beyond the 19th- or even 18th-century tone 
of the word “piety,” there is another problem that I stress in my own teaching 
(and you will hear often in these lectures). Piety is a very individualistic word; 
it usually focuses its power on a single person’s devotion. It doesn’t begin to 
approach what I (and many others in China and beyond) see in the social and 
relational qualities of the term xiao as used by Confucius and his followers in 
the Analects. So here is a small sample of some of the ways that xiao has been 
translated. Let’s think of it as a significant, but limited, semantic field.

Foreword  ix
Filial Piety
Family Reverence
Filial Conduct/Filial Devotion/Filial Obligation
I have chosen to translate 孝 xiao with the terms in the last line, believing that 
they help to tease out more of the social idea embedded in the concept than 
those in the first or second lines. I do find “family reverence” to be a beautiful 
translation. To my mind, though, the term 孝 xiao eventually takes on meanings 
in the Analects that are so far beyond the realm of the family that I prefer to 
call it “filial conduct” (or sometimes “filial devotion,” and occasionally even “filial 
obligation”).
Now consider a related problem. Some Chinese characters really would be 
better left untranslated, because no English word or phrase really approaches 
the Chinese meaning very closely. Indeed, using an English word creates special 
interpretive problems. Let’s add the difficulty of translation to our growing list.
[3] Translation Difficulty
Some terms are almost untranslatable, and any translation 
serves merely as a placeholder for deeper meanings that 
must be grasped through study. The most significant of 
these is 天 tian, which is commonly translated as “heaven” 
(including in these lectures). It is a very different kind of 
“heaven” than many Westerners imagine, however.
The word 天 tian (it sounds like a combination of “tea” and “yen”) has given 
Western translators (and teachers of Chinese language and culture) fits 
over the generations. The most common translation is “heaven,” and I have 
somewhat reluctantly chosen to use that term in these lectures.
The only real alternative to using the English word “heaven” is simply to 
render it tian, requiring that the listener learn the Chinese term and add it to 

x  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
our knowledge of Chinese culture. In fact, that is what many of us do in our 
classes, but there we have the advantage of being able to prod, cajole, harp, 
and occasionally pester students until they grasp 天 tian’s ineffable qualities 
over the course of a semester. But even a thorough 24-lecture series on the 
Analects does not afford enough time easily to work without translations. 
Be aware of this key point, though. The “heaven” referred to in the Analects is 
what we often call a placeholder concept. It is a far cry from any kind of Judeo-
Christian concept of heaven that can be imagined. It is not a land of milk and 
honey, nor a place where a theistic figure resides. It isn’t really even a place at 
all. It is a bit like a vague, conceptual corporate board of ancestors and former 
kings that exerts a moral force upon earthly activities. For now, however, just 
think of “heaven” as a placeholder for something that you will learn more 
about as you listen and read.
While 孝 xiao and 天 tian seem complicated, no single concept is more central 
to Confucius’s Analects than 仁 ren (sounds like “wren”). Much more difficult 
to define (in any language) than 孝 xiao, the semantic field surrounding 仁 
ren is enormously complex. As a way of thinking about it, just imagine people 
acting to the very best of their abilities in the whirlwind of social, ethical, and 
moral situations. Here is a rendering of the semantic field from just a few sets 
of translations.
Humanity    Humaneness
Benevolence 
Man-Being-At-His-Best
Authoritative Conduct    Consummate Conduct
Open any translation of the Analects and you will see these translations and 
perhaps a few others. The top lines have the oldest history, with generations of 
translators who were looking for a Biblical connection to early Chinese texts. 
“Humanity,” but especially “benevolence,” are accurate renderings of part of 
the meaning of 仁 ren. Yet those translations are far more individualistic for 
many of us who perceive a much broader social and relational teaching in 
Confucius’s Analects. For the same reason, the somewhat prolix “man-being-

Foreword  xi
at-his-best” tends toward a character-driven, individual quality. 仁 ren is much 
more than that, though.
A recent translator tried the term “authoritative conduct.” It is a very good 
rendering that helps readers to grasp the way that the person with 仁 ren is 
in command of complex ethical and social situations. The problem that most 
readers could not surmount was the array of rather negative English language 
associations with the word “authoritative.” Those negative associations 
rendered the intent of the translators ineffective—too many Western readers 
heard strains of “authoritarian,” even though that was not at all the message of 
the translators. So let’s add another item to our list.
[4] Problematic Associations
Some very useful English words carry secondary meanings 
that make their use in translation especially problematic. 
One example is a phrase used to translate 仁 ren: 
“authoritative conduct.” Many Westerners can’t help but hear 
“authoritarian,” or other strains they regard as negative, even 
though the word need not be interpreted in that manner.
One of the translators who used “authoritative conduct” in a very fine 
translation of the Analects has reconsidered recently. In a subsequent book, he 
has translated 仁 ren as “consummate conduct.” The translation “consummate 
conduct” gives a very good sense of the flowing, confident-yet-humble sense 
of the term, and I have used it in my own translations for these lectures. 
Nevertheless, I continue to try to find terms and phrases that might tease 
out even more of the social and relational qualities of 仁 ren. For me, the 
term really conveys a kind of social, moral, and ethical virtuosity. My lectures 
explain this idea in detail. It is like a violinist with exquisite skills, but those skills 
only show their full array of wonder when in concert with others. 仁 ren is a 
virtuoso command of complex situations, played to sincere perfection. And 
why didn’t I then choose to translate 仁 ren as “social-moral-ethical virtuosity” 

xii  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
in these lectures? Well, that leads to our fifth and final point on the list. The 
most accurate English rendering is often far too cumbersome—far too many 
words—for a translation that seeks to give a sense of the beautifully spare, 
even laconic, quality of the Analects.
[5] Accurate but Clumsy
Sometimes the most accurate translation (one that gives 
a rich, full sense of the terms used in the Analects) is so 
cumbersome that it masks an equally important aspect 
of the text—its beautifully laconic quality. While I think 
that 仁 ren can best be rendered as “social-ethical-moral 
virtuosity,” repeated use of it (as required in the Analects) 
creates a needlessly clumsy feel that—accurate or not—
detracts from a beautifully efficient text.
 
Translation is about choice, but it is also about audience. I have prepared my 
translations in these lectures to meet the needs of ambitious people who are 
just beginning their study of Confucius and the famous book associated with 
him. I have paid careful attention to the list we have just considered when 
translating and explaining the Analects. The lectures have been designed to 
help you grow in both your own knowledge of the text and as an interpreter 
of the complex puzzles that confront everyone who learns about another 
language and culture. 
The social and relational dynamics that I (and many others) see in Confucius’s 
Analects have guided my own interpretations, and I seek to teach listeners 
how to think in that manner—in a way much closer to the actual text of 
the Analects than the character-driven and individualistic translations of earlier 
eras. In my own translations for this course, I have (whenever possible) 
translated appropriate passages in the plural. Using the plural helps to avoid 

Foreword  xiii
an individualistic focus that is muted in Confucius’s Analects in favor of a social-
relational theme. Consider the following passage.
4.3
Individualistic Translation
The Master said, “The person exhibiting consummate 
conduct (仁 ren) is the only one capable of liking a good 
person and disliking a bad person.”
4.3 
Social-Relational Translation
The Master said, “People exhibiting consummate conduct 
(仁 ren) are the only ones capable of liking good people 
and disliking bad ones.”
The difference may seem minor in just one brief translation, but imagine how 
the understanding of the text is influenced when translators have consistently 
used the singular and individual focus to convey Confucius’s meaning. I believe 
that it distorts it—and quite starkly—as one individualistic interpretation is 
piled upon another. 
Of course, when a passage clearly does speak of the individual, it is necessary 
to translate that accurately, too. Still, one of the most significant lessons you will 
draw from these lectures is that we should not assume without reflection that 
Confucius is speaking of a single person in many of his statements. I far prefer 
to err on the side of assuming the rich background of human beings engaged 
in activities together, and I think that you will see, as you learn more about the 
Analects, that developing a social-relational perspective will be useful.

xiv  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
So let’s take a look at the list one more time, with all five items together. They 
serve as a good reminder of how to approach the early stages of your learning 
about Confucius’s Analects.
[1] One Sound, Many Meanings
Some things that sound the same have different Chinese 
characters and different meanings. Just a few characters 
used in the Analects with the simple sound of li are: 理, 禮,  
利, 立,  離, and 力, each with very different meanings.
[2] Many Translations
Some specific Chinese characters have many possible 
English translations. As an example, 孝 xiao can easily 
be rendered “filial piety,” “family reverence,” and “filial 
conduct,” just to name a few.
[3] Translation Difficulty
Some terms are almost untranslatable, and any translation 
serves merely as a placeholder for deeper meanings that 
must be grasped through study. The most significant of 
these is 天 tian, which is commonly translated as “heaven” 
(including in these lectures). It is a very different kind of 
“heaven” than many Westerners imagine, however.
[4] Problematic Associations
Some very useful English words carry secondary meanings 
that make their use in translation especially problematic. 

Foreword  xv
One example is a phrase used to translate 仁 ren: 
“authoritative conduct.” Many Westerners can’t help but 
hear “authoritarian,” or other strains they regard as negative, 
even though the word need not be interpreted in that 
manner.
[5] Accurate but Clumsy
Sometimes the most accurate translation (one that gives 
a rich, full sense of the terms used in the Analects) is so 
cumbersome that it masks an equally important aspect 
of the text—its beautifully laconic quality. While I think 
that 仁 ren can best be rendered as “social-ethical-moral 
virtuosity,” repeated use of it (as required in the Analects) 
creates a needlessly clumsy feel that—accurate or not—
detracts from a beautifully efficient text.
One final note is necessary. Think back to the three examples I have used in 
this foreword. For decades, and really much more than a century, “filial piety,” 
“heaven,” and “benevolence” have been used to translate 孝 xiao, 天 tian, and 
仁 ren. So why shouldn’t we channel that continuity and use it to create a 
path to understanding through consistency, instead of introducing a wide array 
of new terms? Continuity matters, and I value it. But not now, and not with 
the world’s most recognized Chinese thinker and book entering a new era in 
global understanding. 
No, if there ever was a time for a useful kind of translational chaos, it is surely 
now. There may be a centuries-old tradition of translations such as “filial piety” 
and “benevolence,” but those who read them amount to just a tiny fraction of 
the exploding audience for Confucius’s thought in the 21st century. From my 
perspective, now is precisely the right time for teachers and scholars to work 
through the interpretive challenges of Confucius’s Analects, and to develop 
an approach and a vocabulary that gets to the heart of this great book’s 

xvi  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
deep message about how to live one’s life in a community and world that is 
connected in ways we can’t always easily comprehend.
There is dipping your toes into the water, and then there is jumping straight 
into the pool. I prefer the latter, and I think you will, too. Instead of doling out 
information, these lectures aim to teach you how to think about Confucius’s 
Analects, and that is a far more useful lesson than merely memorizing a stream 
of translations that have been used for a very long time.
 
I urge you not to start exploring full translations of the Analects until you 
have completed these 24 lectures. After you have, though, such reading will 
be invaluable, should you choose to pursue it. While you are still beginning to 
grasp the key concepts, though, the profusion of different full-text translations 
can limit rather than expand understanding. 
As an alternative, I have included on my blog, Round and Square, several 
passages from the Analects that show a wide range of different translations for 
passages that we will discuss in these lectures. Even early on in your listening, it 
might be useful to browse through several of them, so that you can see both 
the extraordinary agreement in many cases about what a passage means and 
the often bewildering array of different translations for key terms. I will have 
much more to say about these matters in the guidebook’s afterword, which will 
describe possible paths to take after completing the lectures, including reading 
several full translations at a time, as I require in the classes that I teach. With 
the foundation of these lectures to support you, such reading will eventually 
lead to even deeper understanding of a very great book.

A Note  
on Chinese Characters and 
Key Terms in the Analects
1. A Brief Guide to Chinese [Mandarin] Pronunciation
Chinese characters can be pronounced in various dialects, the two most 
prominent today being Cantonese and Mandarin. There are many more, 
though, and each region has a wide array of dialects and sub-dialects spoken 
at home, in shops, and in any situation where language can be localized (much 
as regional phrases and pronunciations work in the United States). Mandarin is 
a standardized dialect that is taught in schools in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and 
beyond. It is used consistently on television, as well. The Chinese names and 
terms in this lecture series are all pronounced in Mandarin.
As I have noted, many Chinese throughout the world speak a local dialect 
at home and Mandarin only in more public contexts, providing the richness 
of regional variation for something best illustrated by the early saying (I 
paraphrase here) “Walk even three miles, and speech begins to get fuzzy; 
walk twenty miles and it is hard to understand anything being said.” I am 
reminded of something I learned in my ethnographic fieldwork on the 
southern sacred mountain in Hunan Province. People make a clear distinction 
between “front mountain” (前山) and “back mountain” (後山). I am routinely 
told, on both front and back, that it is difficult to understand people from 
the other side—they live just 10 miles apart—unless they speak the shared 
dialect of Mandarin.
Unlike a language such as Japanese, which can have half a dozen or more 
ways to pronounce a written character, Mandarin usually has one way to 
pronounce it. There are numerous exceptions, but one of the central features 
of Chinese language study is that the student must learn, for the vast majority 

xviii  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
of characters, just one pronunciation. In other words, in Mandarin, ren 仁 is 
always pronounced something like “wren,” but remember this idea: one 
character, one syllable. Today’s language has a single syllable for every character 
in the language. For example, the character 喜, meaning something close to 
“happiness,” is pronounced relatively closely to “she.”
From that foundation, English speakers who seek to translate Chinese 
characters must find a way to transliterate the character’s pronunciation. For 
people who don’t read Chinese the matter is very complicated, indeed. The 
process of transliteration is often referred to as Romanization (it is almost 
always capitalized). It refers to the result of rendering a Chinese character (as 
in the example above) into something resembling an alphabetic form. 
The two most commonly used transliteration (Romanization) systems used 
in the West today are Pinyin and Wade-Giles. The italicized letters below are 
transliterations of the character 喜 using these two systems.
xi    Pinyin: Used by most scholars and almost all current 
newspapers and journals.
hsi   Wade-Giles: Used by most scholars (and other 
publications) until the mid-1970s. It is still used by 
many scholars, especially those who have grown used 
to using it when it was standard.
There are other systems, too, but Pinyin and Wade-Giles dominate most 
publications. Pinyin has taken root in much of the world, and it is used in these 
lectures. But Pinyin’s use of the initial consonants z, q, and x can be confusing, 
especially for English readers. It gets even worse when one reads, say, a 
translation of the Analects published in the 1970s and another published more 
recently. The former will likely contain terms in Wade-Giles Romanization, 
and the latter probably will have Pinyin. Suddenly, the term you have grown 
comfortable thinking of as xi is written hsi (or vice versa).
Readers must (as I like to think of it) take a deep breath and remember that 
both words refer to just one Chinese character. It is seemingly simple, at 

A Note on Chinese Characters and Key Terms in the Analects  xix
least until you open another book and see first 喜 xi and then 喜 hsi. It can 
be disastrously confusing when what I have been transliterating in Pinyin as
仁ren comes out as仁jen in another book. Both are perfectly accurate, but 
they present confusing challenges for readers just beginning their studies 
of the Analects or Chinese history. The situation can become even more 
confusing if one listens to a set of lectures such as these (using Pinyin) and, 
perhaps, checks a translation from the library that happens to use Wade-
Giles Romanization.
In those cases, the very same person’s name might appear to be spelled in two 
different ways. I often joke to my colleagues in American and European history 
that they have it easy—students have to learn “Washington,” “Adams,” and 
even “Charlemagne” only once (even as badly as they might pronounce the 
latter). In Chinese studies, the situation is far grimmer. One of my colleagues 
tells the story of a student paper he once received. It compared the thought of 
“two” Chinese philosophers: Xunzi and Hsün-tzu. The student argued that their 
philosophies were quite similar, but that they differed in certain respects—
the language seemed to be subtly different. The problem is that “Xunzi” and 
“Hsün-tzu” refer to exactly the same person. The Chinese characters behind 
those “two” names are simply 荀子.
Although the story comes across initially as humorous, I actually find it 
to be quite sad. It is difficult enough to learn philosophical, historical, and 
literary concepts in any language. To add a chaos of words to that challenge 
worries me. So, in order to help your studies, I am adding here a partial 
chart meant to introduce some of the pronunciation tools for the terms 
you will encounter. For our purposes, though, the most important thing to

2. Writing the Characters
If you want to learn how to write the key terms in the Analects in Chinese, 
you will have to learn the basics of the writing process. Learning to write 
some of the key concepts in the Analects can be a useful tool if you wish 
to deepen your understanding. Please note that only sustained study of 
the Chinese language with experienced teachers can give you a thorough 
grounding in Chinese studies. My advice here is simply for those who wish 
to write out characters such as 孝 xiao, 天 tian, 仁 ren, and 禮 li as they seek 
to understand how the text works. For this purpose, I strongly recommend 
William McNaughton’s Reading and Writing Chinese. It is imperative that you 
get the traditional character edition if you want to learn the fundamentals of 
Chinese writing.  
Chinese characters do have a simplified form that is used today in the People’s 
Republic of China. A brief way to explain a complicated situation is that it is 
much easier for beginners to move from traditional to simplified characters 
than vice versa. McNaughton’s traditional character edition will teach the 
fundamentals of the Chinese writing system. I ask my own students every 
semester to write out the first 1,000 characters from McNaughton’s text 
during the course of their Chinese historical and cultural studies (about 60 
characters a week). I collect their notebooks regularly and comment on their 
progress. I urge them to treat the book like a drawing course, and to follow 

A Note on Chinese Characters and Key Terms in the Analects   xxi
its stroke-order charts carefully. The results are remarkable. In a few weeks, 
students who previously had never attempted to write Chinese begin to 
understand the internal logic of the Chinese writing system. Chinese characters 
are not chicken scratchings, and McNaughton’s book shows how and why. I 
must add that I implore my students not to try to memorize the characters 
at this point. Those who attempt to do so just slow down the internalization-
of-principles process and actually inhibit their progress. Memorization is for 
language study. The purpose of internalizing the principles of writing is what we 
seek here.
This is the way to get started, but only a good language teacher can help you 
from there.

Books That Matter: 
The Analects of Confucius
Scope
Born in the mid-6th century B.C.E., Confucius led a life that would only appear 
to be monumental in the centuries after his death. Although he struggled to 
find even a relatively minor position in the courts of his time, his influence 
on later generations was truly extraordinary. Unable to find administrative 
employment, Confucius taught. Many of the lessons he imparted to his 
followers were remembered and written down in the decades after his death. 
Although Confucius did not write the Analects, many of the approximately 500 
entries in the text employ his voice. Together, the entries in the Analects create 
a comprehensive approach to living in a complex social world. The lessons are 
as resonant today as they were 2,500 years ago.
The course begins by introducing Confucius, the Analects, and the reasons 
why his lessons matter, even in a modern world that Confucius would not 
recognize. You will then consider a series of thematic and historical topics that 
will help you understand how to read the Analects. Afterward, you will focus 
on a number of important passages in the text. Along the way, you will meet 
several of Confucius’s most dedicated followers, including Zai Wo, who is 
something of a trickster figure in the world of the Analects; Yan Hui, Confucius’s 
favorite student; Zilu, an ambitious and energetic student who more than 
occasionally worried Confucius with his headstrong approach; and Zigong, a 
truly devoted follower who was able to ask Confucius questions that often 
resulted in new articulations of his teachings. You will then examine certain 
themes in the Analects regarding the worlds of government and social living 
that lie at the very heart of Confucius’s teachings.
After this thorough introduction to the Analects, you will focus on the key 
conceptual elements in the text. You will begin with fundamentals, and nothing 
is more fundamental to the teachings of the Analects than the concept and 

2  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
practice of filial conduct. You will then move on to a concept that is allied 
to filial conduct: the principle of remonstrance. You will also consider several 
other concepts that Confucius maintained lay at the heart of being an 
exemplary person—the kind of person whose influence radiates outward 
to make everyone better. These concepts include exerting all of one’s effort, 
sincerity, being true to one’s word, and virtue or excellence, and they are 
brought to completion in empathy or reciprocity. You will see that all of these 
skills, when put together and honed in the practice of social life, prepare a 
person for the highest levels of conduct. You will also learn about consummate 
conduct and ritual conduct, skills that are so advanced and so nuanced that 
they require mastery of all that has come before. You will conclude this section 
by learning how all of these skills come together in the practice of managing 
oneself, managing one’s family, and managing (as the saying in China goes) all 
under heaven.
By the time you reach the final section of the course, you will be ready for a 
fascinating story about Confucius’s legacy and the ways in which the Analects 
helped to shape Chinese government, society, and history up to the present 
day. Confucius has made an extraordinary comeback in the last few decades. In 
this final section, you will see how and why Confucius and the Analects are still 
relevant in and beyond China to this day. ■

Lecture 1
The Hidden Teaching 
Dynamic of the Analects
A
lmost everyone has heard of Confucius, and yet relatively few 
people in the West know much about him or why the one little 
book attributed to him—he didn’t write a word of it, actually—
has changed the world. At times ambiguous, contradictory, and even 
maddening, the Analects of Confucius is also filled with priceless wisdom 
and is deeply rewarding to explore. This course will endeavor to make 
sense of this provocative text that has shaped China and vast territories 
beyond it for millennia. 
The Life of Confucius


The man known in the West as Confucius is called Kongfuzi or Kongzi in 
China. He was a philosopher, teacher, civil servant, and political advisor 
of sorts who was apparently born around 551 B.C.E., perhaps in Qufu, 
in the state of Lu. Lu is now part of China’s peninsular province of 
Shandong, which is located in the country’s northeast and extends into 
the Yellow Sea.


We have many pieces of information about Confucius’s life, but almost 
nothing is known with certainty. The sources of information that we have 
about Confucius are unreliable and contradictory, and they seem to be a 
blend of fact and hagiography. We can say with confidence, however, that 
by a century or so after his death, Confucius was revered in China as a 
great thinker and educator.

4  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


It appears that Confucius lived in poverty for a period of his childhood. 
He developed a reverence for knowledge and self-improvement, both 
for its own sake and as a way of improving society, which was in a state of 
instability in his time.


Confucius evidently became a teacher. He most likely began tutoring pupils 
individually or in small numbers, as was common in his day. Confucius 
appears to have later attained a government post in his home state of Lu. 
At a certain point, however, he went into exile, perhaps when the Duke 
he served lost political power.


He traveled for some years, seeking positions as a political advisor to 
leaders of neighboring states but never finding a job that lasted for any 
great length of time. During those travels, Confucius was accompanied by 
a small band of loyal disciples who continued to learn from him. 


Ultimately, Confucius returned to Lu, where he established an academy 
and taught for the remainder of his life—a period of just five years, if the 
sources can be believed.


The best source for information about Confucius and his ideas is the 
Analects itself. But it presents many challenges for the historian, not to 
mention the average reader—in part because Confucius didn’t write it. 


The Analects is a collection of ideas attributed to Confucius, compiled by 
his students, students of his students, and/or people even more tenuously 
connected to him. It didn’t take its present, rather perplexing shape until a 
few centuries after his death, and recent discoveries continue to shed new 
light on its meaning.


For all the uncertainties surrounding it, the Analects has been so deeply 
revered over the centuries that it is no exaggeration to say that it is a 
cornerstone of East Asian civilization. Its influence is alive in modern China 
and beyond to this day.

The Analects


One way to look at the Analects is as a set of instructions, gentle 
corrections, and stern admonitions for “students” who wish to become 
better people. But viewed more broadly, it can be seen as a set of guiding 
principles for a meaningful and ethical life and for maintaining a just and 
peaceful society. 


The Analects is a collection of brief passages that capture Confucius’s 
teachings, either in the form of direct statements by Confucius, statements 
he made in conversation with others, or statements by other people, 
such as Confucius’s students. Some statements seem to relate to one 
another, but others at least appear to be in no particular order. This can 
be confusing for a first-time reader.


Although the text threatens to burst into a sea of details, linked by nothing 
but the verbal borders of the chapters themselves, the Analects is held 
together by something quite profound. We will refer to it in this course as 
Confucius’s “teaching dynamic.” There is a pedagogical imperative at work 
in the Analects.


The Analects is fundamentally performative in that they were meant to be 
chanted. In China, there is a term (bei) used for memorizing and reciting 
out loud. Many educational texts were meant to be “talked,” and the 
Analects seems to have been assembled in keeping with that tradition. 
Little children began their studies with primer texts that helped them 
learn the rhythmic cadences of classical Chinese. In time, they began a 
process of memorization that had many variants, but one solid goal: to 
be able to recite, sometimes backward and forward, the key texts of the 
classical tradition. Confucius’s Analects became one of those texts, and in 
most education programs for 2,000 years, it towered over all the others.


The Analects is performative in another significant sense. There is a kind of 
drama involved in the way that the text unfolds—the way that a problem 
is opened up, examined, and then left until “the next time.” And there 
always is a “next time,” all of the way to the end of the book.

Lecture 1—The Hidden Teaching Dynamic of the Analects  7
Confucius’s Model Society


The ideas in the Analects are not those of an ascetic who separated himself 
from society in a quest for truth or enlightenment. On the contrary, they 
represent the concerns of a man who was deeply troubled about the 
state of his society and wanted above all to improve it.


Confucius lived during the Eastern Zhou dynasty, at the close of what is 
called the Spring and Autumn Period. China’s imperial structure was in a 
weakened state, and warfare had been ongoing for many years among 
its constituent feudal states. But China was on the verge of even greater 
conflict: the Warring States period, when larger states would field larger 
armies and social order in many quarters would break down. 


Confucius saw the signs of what was coming all around him. Sons killed 
fathers, and ministers of government killed rulers. Even when the disorder 
did not lead to murder, Confucius bemoaned the lack of respect shown 
at all levels of society. Large families had started to arrogate to themselves 
the trappings of kingly rule—to appropriate the rituals of the Zhou 
dynasty court itself. For Confucius, this appropriation was deplorable, 
evidence that society’s fabric was coming apart.


In striving to foster a harmonious society, Confucius had a model in mind. 
It was that of the early Zhou court, some 500 years before his time, and it 
centered around a figure called the Duke of Zhou.


The Duke of Zhou plays an iconic role in the early, often hazy, mythical 
history of China. The story goes that his brother, the victorious King 
Wu, had subdued a stagnant and corrupt Shang dynasty in the mid-11th 
century B.C.E. But King Wu died shortly after the victory. His heir, Prince 
Cheng, was much too young to rule, and the Duke of Zhou chose to rule 
in his place until the young man became old enough to take the reins of 
government on his own.


The Duke of Zhou had to endure withering attacks on his character 
from officials who were certain that he simply planned to dispose of the 
heir and rule alone. In later centuries in China, such usurpations would 

8  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
occur quite frequently, but the Duke of Zhou insisted that he would be 
a teacher to the prince, even as he worked to solidify the foundations of 
what would become an 800-year dynasty. When King Cheng came of age, 
having learned lessons in ruling from his uncle, the Duke of Zhou quietly 
stepped aside. That is the rich blend of mythology and history that have 
echoed for centuries in China.


It was those teachings—the ways of the honorable Duke of Zhou—that 
Confucius wished to bring back. His people had lost their way, and he 
knew in his heart and mind that the lessons rested in the leadership and 
demeanor of the great duke. Confucius wanted the Zhou order to prevail, 
and he sought in his own teaching to articulate just how that should 
happen. In a profound sense, the Analects is about bringing back a simpler 
and more harmonious society—the world of the Duke of Zhou.


The Zhou dynasty in which Confucius lived had begun as a loose 
confederation of states—200 or more—linked in theory and ritual 
practice to the Zhou king. That was in the 11th century B.C.E., the period 
that Confucius revered. Over the centuries, however, the common human 
tendency to occupy other territories and vie for ascendancy took its toll. 
Two hundred mostly tiny states became, in a process of swallow-or-be-
swallowed, 100—and then 50.


When Confucius looked at the future, he saw disaster, and he urgently 
called on people to change their ways in order to prevent it. And 
disaster came. It was partly Confucius’s prescience that convinced later 
generations, as they finally emerged from a brutal era, to revisit his ideas.


In Confucius’s day, however, few listened. It seems that people in power 
had little use for his insights. His earnest counsel never led to steady 
employment, whether in his home state of Lu or beyond.


Confucius was certain that he could put his ideas into practice. What he 
lacked was any significant opportunity to bring his ideas beyond what today 
we call the classroom. And so, with a palpable sense of resignation, he taught.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Think about times when society seems to have gone “to hell in a hand 
basket.” What kinds of people emerge to address the situation? How do 
they do it?
2.	 What are the implications of “performative” texts—from Confucius’s 
Analects to Plato’s dialogues? What distinguishes them from other kinds 
of texts?

Lecture 2
The Analects:  
A Bird’s-Eye View
I
magination. That one word sums up Confucius, the Analects, and 
the influence of his teachings. Confucius’s critics dismissed him as 
a narrow-minded pedant, but he was anything but that. He offers 
invaluable insights on how to live your life. Don’t just earn your keep and 
rest on your days off, he urges; look, learn, imagine, teach. Live your work 
(and certainly don’t just work to live, if you can help it). Think about it, 
ponder it, and find elements of lasting reflection even in the simplest of 
daily activities. This course will show you why and how to make Confucius’s 
text into a lifetime teaching tool for yourself, your family, your community, 
and the larger world, just as Confucius intended.
Imagination and Engagement


C. Wright Mills’s The Sociological Imagination is a classic of social thought. 
In this slender volume, Mills writes about his work not as if it were a 
job; for Mills, his work seemed to be an all-encompassing outlook on the 
world. In other words, real imagination and creativity had to be a full-time 
occupation. It couldn’t just be turned on and off.


Mills continues by underlining how essential this combining of ideas 
that he described really is—and how subjective (and sometimes even 
unacademic) it all feels. Mills says that truly, deeply imaginative social 
thinkers cannot, will not, and could never close it down. They are always 
thinking, always reflecting, and always learning new things about a changing 
world. Such imagination feeds on every experience that we have, and it 

Lecture 2—The Analects: A Bird’s-Eye View  11
goes so far beyond simply earning a living as to be in a different category 
of entrepreneurship altogether.


“Go all in,” Mills almost shouts at his readers. Risk having loose, sloppy, 
and first-draft-style ideas. Sense that “this thing” over here and “that thing” 
over there might be related. Then mull it over, talk about it, and dive into 
more analysis. Don’t sit on the sidelines, and don’t check out after a good 
day’s work. Live your work, and then share it with others.


C. Wright Mills was onto something, and Confucius likely would have 
agreed with him. People have a thirst for knowledge and for lessons they 
can internalize—lessons that might make them better individuals, better 
family members, and better members of larger communities.


At least in the West, we too often hear these lessons through the voice 
of individual character. But what we are starved for—often without fully 
realizing it—is a different kind of lesson: We want to know how to live 
with integrity with others. No amount of personal integrity alone can 
work if we don’t know how to carry out our lives with other people, in 
community, in society.


What we must learn is that living well in the world (and solving the large 
and small challenges all around us) requires a remarkable combination of 
ethical and social imagination. 


From the University of Hawaii to Harvard, and from Montana to Texas—
and all throughout North America, Europe, and the rest of the world—
courses in Chinese philosophy have produced robust enrollment figures, 
even at a time when many people bemoan the sheer practicality of 
interests among students. Something is going on, and we would do best to 
listen to that hunger for understanding.
The Western Approach


One of the best books about philosophy is Bryan Magee’s memoir, 
Confessions of a Philosopher. Although Magee’s book is squarely about the 

12  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Western philosophical tradition, he raises an important point for all of us 
early on.


Magee feels that the profession of philosophy has failed us and that it has 
done so exactly when we need it most. He describes his own experience 
studying philosophy at Oxford in the 1950s and being disgusted with 
what he regarded as the tiny little questions about how we use language 
favored by analytical philosophers of that era. It wasn’t until he undertook 
a year of study at Yale in the 1960s that, in reading Immanuel Kant’s three 
critiques (The Critique of Pure Reason, The Critique of Practical Reason, and 
The Critique of Judgment), Magee found a philosopher who asked big 
philosophical questions on what life in our world is all about.


But here’s the problem: Westerners tend to think about big questions 
through one of two lenses. Sometimes we contemplate the great 
structures of the universe or the vast sweep of human history, and other 
times we study the tiny structures that shape our knowledge, from DNA 
to subatomic particles. Both lenses embody the Western emphasis on 
logic, rationality, and a highly individualistic view of the world.


Confucius certainly doesn’t seem to be looking at the world through those 
lenses, nor does he seem to be asking the big questions of which Bryan 
Magee spoke. Immanuel Kant asked how we know what we think we know. 
He asked about our aesthetic standards. He argued for uncompromising 
ethical standards. How could Confucius ever compete with that?


In fact, Confucius’s Analects does deal with the big questions. Questions 
don’t get any bigger than how we should live our lives with and among 
others.
The Confucian Approach


In years past, the consensus among students and professors of Chinese 
studies was that Confucius was an impractical, rulemaking bore. The 
general view was that he had little to teach us in modern society and 
that the Analects was only of value for what it could tell us about China’s 

Lecture 2—The Analects: A Bird’s-Eye View  13
past. The idea that Confucius could 
be the carrier of a vital message, of 
a way of knowing and acting in the 
world, struck many academics as 
nonsense.


Confucian 
engagement 
differs 
radically 
from 
many 
Western 
ideals of disengaged study from 
the outside. To comprehend the 
Analects, you must be all in. You must 
enter the conversation, the complex 
exchange of questions and answers, 
assertions 
and 
observations, 
challenges and retorts that make up 
the gentle pedagogical rhythms of 
the Analects.


The Analects welcomes the reader 
who is willing to engage with it. But 
learning to do so can admittedly be 
challenging. What follows is an example of this type of exchange, so that 
you can see how you might enter the conversation of the Analects yourself.


A large number of entries in Confucius’s Analects set up a special kind of 
social scene. It is one in which someone (sometimes dukes and territorial 
governors, other times his own students) ask him a question. His answers 
can help us to enter the growing dialogue. Be sure to listen for these 
social interactions.
17.8
The Master said, “Zilu! Have you heard of the six negative 
qualities and the six positive qualities?” “No, I haven’t,” 
replied Zilu. “Well, sit down then,” said the Master. “I 

14  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
will instruct you. Wanting to be consummate in conduct 
but not wanting to study—that is a first flaw, and it 
will lead to fatuousness. Wanting knowledge but not 
wanting to study—that is a second flaw, and it will lead to 
rootlessness.”
The Master continues: 
“Wanting to be true to one’s word, but not wanting to 
study—that is a third flaw, and it leads to impairment. 
Wanting to be upright, but not wanting to study—that is 
a fourth flaw, and it leads to impudence. Wanting to be 
brave without wanting to study—that is a fifth flaw, and it 
leads to disorder. Finally, wanting to be solid and firm but 
not wanting to study—that is a sixth flaw, and it leads to 
foolhardiness.”


This kind of entry teaches the reader (or listener) how to enter the 
conversation. In this passage, Confucius uses a series of ordinary words 
and contrasts them with studying or not studying. People who confronted 
Confucius’s teachings during the master’s lifetime, as well as in the decades 
and centuries that followed, were hearing something different from the 
ways they used those words.


Confucius used concepts in new and sometimes startling ways. 
Interactions like the one above are an example of Confucius teaching his 
listeners how to think creatively—imaginatively—and to continue to do 
so for themselves and for others.


If you are still struggling to grasp how the text of the Analects works, 
don’t despair. There will be many more opportunities in this course to 
understand it. Rest assured that you’re not alone; plenty of people who 
earnestly wish to understand Confucius’s message have tried (often 
repeatedly) to do so.

Lecture 2—The Analects: A Bird’s-Eye View  15


The Analects is difficult to penetrate at the outset. But if you can master 
the essentials of reading it, you will find yourself greatly rewarded and 
your life enriched, as many persistent readers have discovered. To do so 
requires that you enter the world of the text in a way that is different 
from the one in which most of us were trained.


Imagine what it was like in a much earlier era, when information at the 
click of a button was a thing of utter fantasy. Imagine a world in which the 
gift of a book could change your life forever. Imagine a world in which you 
didn’t just read, but read, reread, read again, and lived a book. It is so far 
from the way that we think today that we need to remind ourselves of 
the power that a single book can contain.


Confucius’s Analects contains that kind of transformative power, and you 
can experience it for yourself if you approach the book in the right way. It 
must be read, reread, and lived.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The Western philosophical tradition places a heavy focus upon 
“rationality” in decision-making. Confucius maintains that one must be 
“all in.” What are the implications of being personally invested in how 
and what one learns?
2.	 Is it possible to be “Confucian” outside of China?

Lecture 3
The Man We Call Confucius
C
onfucius failed to put the ideas he taught into practice. He 
sought to change the society in which he lived, but he received 
only the barest attention from local or regional rulers. From the 
perspective of his life experience, it would have been impossible to guess 
that he would become the most influential person in his society and one 
of the most important figures in world history. How he achieved that 
status is quite a story, yet even that story’s majestic outline comes to us in 
tiny snippets that give just a few pieces of the complex mosaic of his life 
and teaching.
Biographical Sources


Most of what we know about Confucius comes from the text of the 
Analects itself. A great deal of additional information about Confucius’s 
home state of Lu and some of the prominent people in Lu public life, 
including Confucius and several of his students, is contained in a text 
called the Zuozhuan (Zuo Commentary)—a narrative commentary on a 
terse historical work, the Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn Annals), covering 
three centuries of life in eastern China.


More details can be gleaned from writers claiming to know about how 
Confucius lived, even though some were born long after him. Perhaps 
the most influential of these is Mencius (372–289 B.C.E.), the only other 
Chinese figure to be given a Latinized name by the earliest Western 
translators. Another thinker, Mencius’s contemporary Xunzi (c. 310–c. 
220 B.C.E.), explicated many of Confucius’s teachings in his own highly 
refined set of essays. A further thinker from a tradition often critical of the 

Lecture 3—The Man We Call Confucius  17
Confucians presents several surprisingly detailed and insightful portrayals 
of Confucius. This author, Zhuangzi (c. 370–287 B.C.E.), could be 
eviscerating in his criticism and yet wonderfully nuanced in his descriptions 
of a frail Confucius.


The most comprehensive treatment of all was compiled by one of 
China’s greatest historians, Sima Qian. Writing almost four centuries after 
Confucius’s death, Sima Qian’s biography of Confucius in his elaborate and 
influential Historical Records (Shiji) so deeply influenced the interpretation 
of Confucius’s life and work that we must take it seriously, despite 
clear evidence that it was written long after Confucius’s death and that 
enormous amounts of the biography are highly embellished. For more 
than 2,000 years, it has shaped the way readers in China view Confucius.


As we take our first steps down this biographical path, keep in mind the 
concept of veridicality. In a nutshell, veridicality means that something is 
“in accordance with the historical sources.” Because Confucius lived 2,500 
years ago, we will never know what happened in his life with any degree 
of certainty. This fact requires that we strengthen our resolve, know what 
we can know, accept that some things we might never know, and keep 
learning all of the time.
Textual Fragments of Confucius’s Life


In the Analects, Confucius emphasized a term that is one of the most 
powerful and persistent in all of Chinese thought: the Way. Synonyms for 
the Chinese character (道) range from “way” to “path,” “road,” “route,” 
and more. It is one of the most ancient of concepts, and it is also pre-
sectarian—before the divided schools of thought of Confucius’s and later 
eras. To lead a life, to function in society, was to be on the Way.


Confucius used the Way to establish his message. In many respects, the 
Analects frames the Way as a combination of an individual’s life path 
with the larger path (or paths) that make up a civilization. It is a complex 
melding of individual and society that leads toward a better or (as 
Confucius worriedly taught) a worse society.



Confucius lived from 551–479 B.C.E. When he was born, the Zhou 
dynastic order that was the touchstone for his philosophy was beginning a 
slow process of unraveling. By the time Confucius died, his world was on 
the verge of serious disorder that would cause disruptions for the next 
250 years.


One item in the Analects states that Confucius’s origins were quite humble 
and that his family was by no means well-off. His father died when he was 
young, and his mother raised him under difficult circumstances. Confucius 
stated that his hardy youth was quite problematic. He spent much of his 
youth doing odd jobs and, in the process, learning practical skills in order 
to survive.


Americans often hear of Confucius’s hardy youth and read into it a kind 
of Horatio Alger narrative about “pulling himself up by the bootstraps” 
or “rising from the mailroom to the boardroom.” Such an interpretation 
could occasionally be heard in China, too, but Confucius was having none 
of it. “It would have been far better to study,” he notes in the Analects.


One can see in Confucius’s statement a kind of frustration with the 
marginalization he experienced along social or even class lines, and this 
should be taken seriously. Confucius never quite broke through to the 
successes he imagined, and a combined puzzlement and resentment is 
apparent throughout the Analects. On the other hand, there seems to 
be much more to his statement. Confucius genuinely believed that study 
was truly a lifetime process and that it should begin early in life. For him, 
learning the ways of peasants, laborers, shopkeepers, and travelers paled 
in comparison to careful learning and reflection from great texts.


Confucius spent most of his life failing to make a mark, yet he persisted. 
One of the most famous of all passages in the Analects describes a life of 
endless trying—never giving up, even when there is little or no chance of 
success.

Zilu spent the night at Stone Gate. The morning gatekeeper 
inquired, “Where are you from?” Zilu replied, “From 
Confucius’s academy.” The gatekeeper said, “Isn’t he the 
one who knows that his objective cannot be accomplished, 
and yet he keeps on moving forward anyway?”


Making a difference mattered 
profoundly to Confucius, and 
he sought to put his ideas 
into practice. Sometimes he 
even seems to lose his way, 
and more than occasionally 
we sense that he doesn’t 
have the right feel for the 
target.


As he moved through his 
later decades—now called 
to serve or counsel, now 
ignored and waiting for the 
next summons—Confucius 
was always ready to try a 
new target, to hit his mark 
just right. But not once, in 
all of his years, was he able 
to strike the target to his 
satisfaction.

Confucius’s Teaching Career


Confucius’s career as a teacher, although shaped by a lifetime of travel, 
frustration, despair, and hope, lasted for only five years, from 484–479 
B.C.E. Those five years were an exceptionally brief period in which to 
make a name that would shine as China’s greatest teacher for 2,500 
years.


The structure and organization of Confucius’s “school” can only be 
gleaned from scattered items in the Analects. For example, one fascinating 
glimpse into the give-and-take between the master and his disciples, or 
the teacher and his students, can be found in a dynamic exchange with 
several students.
11.22
Zilu asked, “When learning something, should I put it 
right into practice?” The Master replied, “Your father and 
elder brothers are still alive; how would you dare to act 
immediately after learning something?” Ran Qiu then asked 
the same question. The Master replied, “Yes. Upon learning 
something, put it into action forthwith.” 


Here Confucius is in his full teacherly mode. Two different students, with 
different characters and personalities, ask the sage the same question. 
What they get is not one, but two different answers. To make sense 
of this, let’s examine Confucius’s answer when a third student asks for 
clarification.
11.22
Gongxi Hua inquired, “When Zilu asked, you told him to 
hesitate—to defer to his family’s elders. Yet when Ran Qiu 
asked the very same question, you told him to proceed with 

Lecture 3—The Man We Call Confucius  21
alacrity. This befuddles me; dare I ask what you meant?” 
“The Master replied, “Ran Qiu is timid and reserved, so I 
exhorted him to go forward; Zilu possesses the intensity of 
two people, so I wanted to restrain him.”


Here we see the full force of the teaching dynamic in the Analects. 
Confucius is in his element as he tailors his message to the specific 
needs, as he perceives them, of each of his students. There are 
few cookie-cutter templates in Confucius’s teachings. He seems to 
understand that the world is made up of many different kinds of people 
and circumstances. While there are common principles going back to 
the Duke of Zhou whom Confucius so idolized, and even beyond, 
action must be crafted.


For Confucius, learning was a powerful joint effort between teacher and 
student, and he wanted students who, in today’s terms, wanted to be 
there. He had no interest at all in passive learning, and he set a high bar for 
interaction and reflection for each of his students.


The Analects reflects both Confucius’s despair and hope that his work 
would achieve positive change in his world. It was perhaps those warring 
emotions that produced his insistence on rituals, music, and rules. In 
his view, attention to these matters would strengthen the social order, 
but he always tailored his teachings to meet the specific needs of his 
students.


When Confucius died in 479 B.C.E., he was not a person of great 
influence. Yet the man who would reign above all teachers in Chinese 
history answered, at least after a fashion, the very questions about 
personal character, flexibility, and complexity that we have been asking. 


The Analects also gives us a glimpse at Confucius’s own account of 
his teaching philosophy, long before others would argue about it for 
themselves. It all holds together, he says, in one winding line.

Lecture 4
How the Analects Is 
Organized
T
he most successful readers are those who patiently get to know 
the Analects rather than stubbornly trying to ring meaning from 
it through sheer force of intellectual will. While the text of the 
Analects appears to be disorganized, there are actually several patterns 
holding it together. In this lecture, you will learn about some of these 
patterns. Look for the patterns, and you will be well on your way to 
understanding a text that has stumped Westerners (and more than a few 
East Asian readers) for centuries.
Reading the Analects


One way to think about Confucius’s Analects is that it contains a series 
of significant teachings that are carved into little pieces—analects—and 
scattered in almost random fashion throughout the text. The scattered 
nature of the text has made reading it a challenge for Westerners who 
have sought the teachings of a great thinker. They often expect far more 
systematic coverage than the Analects offers. 


The way that the text of the Analects is taught today in China, Taiwan, 
Singapore, and beyond emphasizes the supposedly “most important” 
sayings in the text. In other words, it cherry-picks the material that 
those in charge (parents, teachers, and government bureaucrats) want 
young people to learn. And then they are tested repeatedly on them. A 
fascinating and troubling result is that students who pass the high school 
and college examinations know parts of the text of the Analects very well. 

24  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
They have memorized some of the phrases “for the tests” and can repeat 
them verbatim in almost any context. But they do not know the book as 
a whole.


Today, Confucius’s Analects has been endlessly mined for the “essentials”—a 
problematic concept if ever there was one. The “most important” passages 
have been set aside and combined into small booklets. As a result, in China 
and the West, we have today a problematic and fragmented understanding 
of a very great book, not least because almost no one reads the whole 
thing anymore. In this course, we will begin to put the text back together 
again. We won’t be able to go start to finish, but we will continue to use 
this principle of sequential reading as much as possible.


There was a time not too long ago when young readers read the Analects 
from beginning to end. Indeed, they memorized the 500 sayings that were 
arranged into 20 unevenly spaced chapters. And it was not just that they 
studied harder that made them better readers of the Analects. They knew 
the text. They knew its gaps, its nuances, and its rhythm. 
The Structure of the Analects


There are several structural levels at work in the Analects. The most basic 
will be referred to in this course as “chapters.” The Chinese term is juan, 
and it refers to a unit of text that originally was bound separately. Early 
manuscripts written on bamboo formed a limited space for copying a 
text. In time, the juan became the formative division in all of Chinese 
writing. Exceedingly long texts were not described in pages, but rather in 
the number of chapters or juan.


Confucius’s Analects contains 20 juan. The first juan contains 16 phrases of 
varying lengths, the second 24, and the last—the twentieth—just three. The 
longest juan in terms of individual passages is the fourteenth, with 44 items.


There is a staccato-like, performative dimension to the Analects, and in 
many ways its chapters work in ways akin to scenes in dramatic writing. 
Each chapter is a cluster of seemingly unrelated phrases, but each sets the 

Lecture 4—How the Analects Is Organized  25
scene, so to speak, for the next. The experience of reading the Analects 
from beginning to end, then, feels a great deal more like reading drama 
than an extended philosophical argument. 


The greatest challenge in thinking of the divisions of the Analects as 
chapters is that they are not really about anything. Not one of them is 
organized under a topic or a theme and certainly not a fully-formed plot. 
There is no clearly discernable relationship, to a modern sensibility—and 
especially to a Western one—between the first passage in a chapter 
and the last. This can make learning the text maddening to readers 
experienced in reading other literary traditions.


The chapter titles themselves illustrate the issue. It was only much later in 
the Chinese tradition—long after Confucius lived—that chapters began 
to have titles that foretold what might be contained within the chapter 
as a whole, its argument, or story. Following a practice that was already 
established long before Confucius, the Analects contains 20 titles of two 
characters each. Each consists of a multiword title constructed in the same 
way—based, with only one exception, on two characters taken from the 
first line of each chapter.


This titling process tries to find the first two substantive characters of 
the chapter, and those selections have become embedded in memory 
for serious readers over the centuries. Any well-read scholar could 
immediately recite the 20 chapter titles of the Analects without delay. But 
the titles amount to something just short of gibberish in terms of telling 
what each chapter contains.


Here the process becomes even more strange: The titles of the last nine 
chapters all contain names of actual people, sometimes with their official 
titles. To the uninitiated, this seems to imply that the chapter will be about 
that person, or at least that the person will play a large role in the chapter. 
It is almost never the case, however. So even though a chapter may be 
given the title “Yan Yuan,” one of the names referring to Confucius’s 
favorite student, it is a stretch to think of the chapter as being about him. 
A few statements may deal with him, but that is the extent of it.

26  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Going even further, it is not even an absolutely strict rule that chapter titles 
be exactly two characters long. Because chapter 15 contains a character 
for a person’s title, it is the only one that is three characters long.


All of these details sound immensely strange—chapter titles that 
everyone knows, yet they have almost nothing to do with the contents 
within—but don’t worry. It is part of an even larger structure that begins 
to make sense if you stay with it. It is almost as though the chaos of 
500 individual sayings under 20 arbitrary (but painstakingly memorized) 
chapter titles is a cruel postmodern trick played upon gullible readers 
trying to find meaning.


Most of us are drawn to find linkages of some kind, and the challenges 
are enormous when confronting a text such as the Analects. If we ignore 
this issue, we are in danger of sensing far too much continuity in a text 
that truly represents a scattering of significant sayings. We have to learn 
to read the Analects in a way that grasps those continuities as part of 
a grander pattern, but avoids the temptation to assume that statements 
inevitably build upon each other.


While we certainly can (and will) take away key lessons from the Analects, 
we should not forget that it is really a grand orchestration of themes that 
bring together the teachings of earlier eras and seek to perpetuate them 
into new eras. That such a project has lasted well into a third millennium of 
influence in China should tell us that something beyond a mere confusion 
of words, passages, and chapters, is going on.
Reading Classical Chinese Texts


Chinese readers often face certain challenges when reading classical 
Chinese. They already know many of the Chinese characters being used, 
but they lack deep experience with the key grammatical particles that 
make classical Chinese much more spare in terms of linguistic context and 
infinitely more complex.



In addition, the classical language has changed quite dramatically over the 
generations. As a result, many of the characters modern readers think 
of as unproblematic actually mean something a bit different than they 
think. Many combinations of two characters take on dramatically different 
meanings when read in a classical text.


An even more thorny problem in early Chinese documents is that there 
is no punctuation. The commas and colons and spaces that are a part of 
punctuated modern editions are not present in the classical texts. The 
classical Chinese of Confucius’s day was an elaborate puzzle that required 
creative readers to sort out everything. In addition to reading everything 
from beginning to end, readers had to figure out even where the “sayings” 
began and ended. While there certainly are grammatical clues in many 
cases, it remains an enormous challenge.


The implications of this reader-centered analysis would give literature 
professors much to think about, but the reality when we consider how 
people have read the Analects over many centuries was the following: 
Readers were confronted with approximately 500 sayings arranged in 
20 chapters, each with a title drawn from two of the initial characters in 
the text. Where chapters began and ended was clear enough (there are 
gaps in the original bamboo panels, after all), but within each chapter 
the main text was interspersed with many lines—and sometimes 
pages—of small print commentary. This commentary appeared in the 
middle of the page, separated from the main text, and at the bottom 
of the page. And there was no punctuation whatsoever. Readers had to 
determine the syntax for themselves, often with the aid of teachers and 
guidebooks.


Like the punctuation that readers had to insert using their own interpretive 
skills, understanding how the Analects work is a creative act. It can teach 
profound lessons, even amidst so much seeming chaos.

Lecture 5
The Provenance of the 
Analects
I
n recent years, archaeological discoveries have transformed scholars’ 
understanding of early Chinese texts, including the Analects. Such 
discoveries have often created interpretive confusion where scholars 
had for many years felt certainty. With more discoveries on the way, the 
only thing that is certain is that the understanding of the Analects will 
continue changing throughout our lifetimes and well beyond.
The Impact of Archaeological Discoveries


When it comes to our understanding of Confucius’s Analects and other 
classical Chinese texts, we live in interesting times, and most of the 
developments have been enormously positive. New knowledge is forcing 
us to rethink assumptions we have had about early Chinese society and the 
texts that have steered our interpretations. Much of this new knowledge 
comes from archaeological discoveries in ancient tombs and other sites.


For all the tumult in modern Chinese politics, a kind of archaeological 
humility has remained, intent on preserving the past and using the 
best tools available—even waiting decades in some cases to excavate 
significant sites, in hopes that better technology will aid the process.


Among the most significant items found thus far have been books. These 
discoveries have changed the way we read early Chinese history, often in 
dramatic fashion, and have profoundly clarified the meaning of classical 
Chinese texts.

30  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


For example, the books did not assume the finished or “received” forms until 
many decades, and often even centuries, after they were first composed. 
Writers edited, reflected, moved text, discussed the growing work with 
others, and kept tinkering. That tinkering would be lost to us without the 
riches we have gained from archaeological discoveries of buried texts.


Through examination of these discovered texts, we have learned that 
some of the actual Chinese characters differed, even when the meaning 
was strikingly similar. The grammatical patterns are often different as well. 


If these details seem minor, realize that moving whole sections of text 
from, for example, the beginning to the middle—and something else from 
the middle to the opening—can have profound implications for a text 
that has been read and admired for several thousand years.
Tinkering with Texts


Scholars and local courts kept busy in early Chinese history. They not 
only fought for ascendancy in a changing political order, but also strove for 
intellectual impact.


During this period, thinkers were sought after. Rulers understood that 
they needed these people that today we call philosophers. From a 
Warring States perspective, however, they might more properly be called 
high-powered consultants.


The stakes were high, the services of these thinkers cost fortunes, and their 
views were contested, often bitterly so. Thinkers we today call “Confucian” 
disdained Daoist ideas for their simplicity, while Daoists mocked the rules 
and regulations that Confucians created—and they were only a small part 
of what are often called the Hundred Schools of the period. All sides 
advised states that won and lost.


Some successful thinkers received major positions. Other successful 
thinkers seemingly avoided politics (while still crafting a political message 
that might be heard much later).

Lecture 5—The Provenance of the Analects  31


Through it all, these advisers, their subordinates, and the people who 
employed them tinkered with texts such as the Analects, even while 
writing their own works. The process was the intricate (and occasionally 
clumsy) work of many different hands, with more than a few tinkerers 
having a stake in whether or not Confucius (or any other author) was 
taken seriously.


This process continued through the first great unification of China in the 
Qin dynasty (221–206 B.C.E.) and the subsequent Han dynasty (206 
B.C.E.–220 C.E.). It was not until the first centuries of the Common 
Era, 2,000 years ago, that classical texts much like we read today would 
emerge. Before that, there was tinkering and enormous social change.
The Dingzhou Analects


There is a marvelous detective story built into the discovery and 
painstaking editing of the oldest version of the Analects that we have 
today. What we have learned from scattered bamboo fragments found 
in a tomb in north-central China confirms that those Analects contain 
linguistic alterations, differences in organization, and other slight variations 
on preceding versions. Four hundred years after its first bits were 
composed, it’s clear that the Analects wasn’t quite finished yet.


Found in Hebei province, Dingzhou Tomb #40 belonged to an ally of 
an early Han dynasty emperor in the 1st century B.C.E. The tomb was 
a rare find, because officials of relatively insignificant status such as the 
one found there ordinarily did not merit elaborate burial.


The tomb and its contents were beset by a series of misfortunes that 
would seem to be the stuff of fiction, had they not been documented 
over the course of the last 40 years. But the tomb has helped us attain a 
deeper understanding of the Analects regardless.


One of the most common problems for tombs all over the world is 
robbery. In the case of the Dingzhou tomb, there definitely was robbery, 
and a good portion of the tomb’s many contents were plundered. It 

32  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
seems clear that the thieves were after the most precious possession in 
the tomb: an elaborate tunic of jade, held together by golden threads. 
Countless tombs in China have had the corpses stripped of jade, but this 
one survived. Only a few pieces of jade are missing, and the tunic tells us a 
great deal about Chinese burial practices of the time.


The survival of the jade tunic in the Dingzhou tomb can partly be 
attributed to an intricate and sturdy outer coffin that made robbery 
not only cumbersome, but also an engineering challenge requiring 
sophisticated thieves with the appropriate tools. However, many other 
jade costumes were pilfered before and after the robbery of the Dingzhou 
tomb. Something else happened at Dingzhou, and it is one of the only 
reasons that we also have a version of the Analects composed some four 
centuries after Confucius’s death: during the robbery, there was a fire.


When the fire broke out, the robbers fled, dropping bits of jade, text, and 
bronze as they hurried out. The records do not indicate that any robbers 
died in the attempt, and the tomb seems not to have been disturbed 
again. The jade tunic remained.


This is the confused scene that archaeologists came upon in 1973. The 
archaeologists found one of the most stunningly intact jade costumes ever 
found on a corpse, along with several metallic objects that survived a 
fierce fire in a wooden construction. And then they entered the eastern 
compartment of the rear chamber. That corner was the small study 
reserved for the deceased, and it had a special knife used by ancient 
writers, three large ink slabs, a copper pot, and a significant number of 
texts organized in bamboo slips. 


Some of the texts that were in this library for the deceased had been 
stolen, but the remaining ones were charred by the fire—some almost 
beyond recognition. Many of the bamboo strips have hard- or impossible-
to-read characters, often at the edges of the strips. As happens after a 
century or so, even in the best preserved tombs, the threads that hold 
the bamboo strips together disintegrate, leaving the bamboo strips to 
fall into each other, losing any sequencing that we might have been able 

Lecture 5—The Provenance of the Analects  33
to grasp had they still been connected by threads. Nonetheless, it was a 
spectacular find, and the various strips and fragments were sent to Beijing 
for further study at the National Cultural Relics Bureau.


Work began at the National Cultural Relics Bureau a year later, in 1974. 
By its nature it was painstaking, but it occurred during a time of enormous 
upheaval and change in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, many 
of the country’s leading scholars were working on discoveries to the south 
at Mawangdui. Several of those scholars joined the Dingzhou project 
later, in 1976, and everything looked hopeful as they began systematically 
transcribing the bamboo strips onto carefully organized cards. 


But in July 1976, one of most disastrous earthquakes in modern history 
shook northern China. This Tangshan earthquake devastated large portions 
of the countryside, killing thousands of people. The earthquake also tipped 
the wooden storage chest containing the precious bamboo fragments 
from Dingzhou Tomb #40. The chest opened as it fell to the ground, and 
the fragments scattered across the floor. Any sense of organization that 
might have seemed possible was now gone. Worse, many of the fragile 
strips were further damaged, and characters that had seemed possible to 
decipher after the initial discovery now were gibberish.


Work continued until 1981, but was halted again. Finally, in 1993, a 
final report was published. Knowing the fate of the oldest Analects in a 
bewildering stream of bad luck makes that report seem disappointing, but 
what we have learned about the Analects from the Dingzhou discovery is 
still significant.
Lessons Learned from the Dingzhou Analects


While many early texts have somewhat different patterns and phrasings—
not to mention word choice—from those schoolchildren memorized for 
generation, there is a remarkable consistency at work, as well. Based on 
the Dingzhou Analects, the similarities to current editions far outweigh the 
differences. It is fundamentally the same text that we study today.

34  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Nevertheless, almost every single line of the Dingzhou Analects contains 
something that varies from today’s received text. Reviewing some of these 
differences will give us a better sense of just what archaeology means in 
the preservation and teaching of a world classic.


First, there are hundreds of locations (over 700, depending on how one 
counts) in which the Dingzhou Analects varies from the Analects that 
was taught in most schools throughout Chinese history. What we cannot 
know at this point is the order of the chapters or even the chapter titles. 
Because they were preserved, and then scattered, in bamboo strips—
not to mention plundered and overturned—we will never know if the 
contents of this text had a different order.


Sometimes the characters used in the Dingzhou Analects are very basic 
roots of more complex ones in today’s text—中 for 仲 (middle), or 間 
for 簡 (between). Other times, the forms are more specific than found in 
today’s text—智for 知 (knowledge), or 壹 for 一 (one). There are many 
more, and they get quite technical, but this will give you a sense of another 
type of difference in the Dingzhou Analects.


One of the most interesting ways that the Dingzhou Analects differs from 
more recent versions is in the very passages themselves. What we can 
see in the archaeological fragments is that some of the divisions within 
the text may be more arbitrary than a carefully memorizing schoolchild 
would ever realize. What we have learned about punctuation as a creative 
act takes on added significance here.


The Dingzhou Analects creates a fascinating picture of similarity and 
difference at work. On one hand, the text seems to hold together in 
much the same way that our more recent versions do. On the other 
hand, almost every line contains something different. After 15 or more 
centuries of learners memorizing the same combinations of words, we 
now live in a time when any classical text we might have read could 
“change” any day.

The Analects in Miniature
A
s you have learned, the text of the Analects took many centuries 
to form, and the order of the passages and chapters do not 
reflect meticulous single authorship. Nevertheless, the opening 
passages of the Analects set the tone for the entire text as it has been 
read for most of the past 2,000 years. From individual conduct to running 
the state itself, the core themes of the Analects are all present in these five 
passages.
Analects 1.1


The first lines of the Analects are so famous, so ubiquitous in Chinese 
culture, and so often quoted in Chinese life that it is hardly an exaggeration 
to say that everyone in China knows them. But even though everyone 
may have heard of the first passage of the Analects and may even be able 
to recite it, it is still a formidable jumble of ideas.
1.1
The Master said, “To study, and then find opportunities 
to make use of it, is this not indeed a pleasure? To have 
friends arrive from distant places, is this not indeed a source 
of enjoyment? To be unacknowledged or misunderstood 
by others, and yet to harbor no resentment, is this not the 
mark of an exemplary person (君子)?”

Lecture 6—The Analects in Miniature  37


The last two words—”exemplary person”—are a translation of the 
Chinese phrase junzi (君子). For decades, translators have rendered 
that phrase as “the gentleman.” However, “gentleman” is probably more 
Victorian than is helpful for a modern reader of the English language. 
Something resembling Confucius’s vision is present in the older term, but 
the alternative translation of junzi as “exemplary person” brings together 
more of the multiple meanings hinted at in the text.


The next element concerns when friends arrive from distant places. 
Indeed, few things are more joyful than companions coming from afar. This 
line is so common in Chinese conversation that it gets mentioned to the 
point of cliché. It is hardly unusual for someone to utter it when seeing a 
friend or acquaintance after a long time away. But there is more to this 
statement.


On traditional Chinese calendars, which contain not only dates but all 
manner of interesting commentary, you will find certain days that are 
designated as particularly good or bad for various activities. None of these 
calendars, however, list a day as bad for study. It is just that some days 
are especially good for it. This undoubtedly reflects Confucian influence. In 
the vast majority of cases, the Chinese characters noting that it is a good 
day for study are paired immediately with the information that it is also a 
good day for gathering with friends. Friendship and learning form the very 
heart of social communion in the world of the Analects.


Just as the first two statements of Analects 1.1 seem to be independent 
of each other until we understand coming together in intellectual 
companionship and communion, the third speaks to the whole person—
the one who studies, reflects, shares views, discusses with others, and truly 
wants to make a difference in the world, as Confucius did.
Analects 1.2


From the solid structure of the first passage in the Analects, the text 
passes the “narrative” to one of Confucius’s students.

38  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


This back-and-forth between master and followers is not unusual. It was 
those very students who kept alive Confucius’s teachings after his death, 
in part by compiling the Analects itself. In a very real sense, it is their 
book.


Although the Analects is dominated by statements and discussion topics 
initiated by Confucius, a large number of the entries are attributed to 
either his students or (occasionally) someone outside the setting of 
Confucius’s school. The second statement in the Analects follows this 
pattern. Here, a colleague the students turned to by the name of Youzi 
speaks to the foundation of all human character. 
1.2
Master You said, “Rare indeed is the person of filial and 
fraternal conduct (孝弟) who yet enjoys defying his 
superiors. And among those not inclined to defy authority, 
there has never been one who incited rebellion. Exemplary 
people (君子) focus upon the roots. Once the roots are 
established, the Way will grow and spread. As for filial 
and fraternal conduct, they are, I suspect, the root of all 
consummate conduct (仁).”


At the core of the best people and their actions is respect for superiors 
and a desire not to create disorder. Even further, those people work 
together in a hierarchy of knowledge, values, and expectations. While 
the first passage in the Analects speaks across many world cultures and 
civilizations, this one might strike at least some Western listeners a bit 
more abrasively.


Here we see at least one strain of what has appealed to Chinese rulers 
since Confucius’s time: an emphasis on harmony, and one explicitly 
linked to respecting authority. There is a hierarchical dynamic at work in 

Lecture 6—The Analects in Miniature  39
Confucian thought, and it will color almost everything we encounter in 
the Analects from this point forward.


That hierarchy does not occur in any significant sense in the opening 
passage is a surprise. It is almost everywhere else in the text and in Chinese 
society. It is important, however, to distinguish respect for hierarchy from 
blind obedience. In this passage, Youzi states that having the best kind of 
conduct is grounded in being a good sibling and child. The best kind of 
person does not create discord in the family or beyond it.


A shallow misinterpretation of this passage has led many Chinese 
rulers to mistaken judgments. One of the reasons that today’s Chinese 
Communist Party leaders have embraced Confucius more warmly than 
almost anyone would have anticipated is this very emphasis in Analects 1.2 
on harmony. Even without saying the word “harmony,” it can be taken as 
a defense of the status quo. However, that is not what many interpreters 
think Confucius and his students meant, any more than they wished to 
level society into everyone being equal.
Analects 1.3


The Analects follows the two complex and comprehensive passage that 
lead the document with a spare, succinct, and to-the-point assertion that 
you had better have substance, because all polish and no grit just won’t do 
the job. Analects 1.3 is a delight, but it is far from simple.
1.3
The Master said, “Rare indeed is it when glib words 
and [ostentatious] appearance accompany consummate 
conduct (仁).”


This is a passage that speaks across the ages and to almost every society. 
Brief, memorable statements such that in Analects 1.3 are like candy for 

40  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
personal growth narratives. Have substance; don’t be shallow. “Just be 
serious, even grave,” the advice seems to say. Resist the easy answers, and 
build a strong foundation of character and self-reflection. Don’t make 
Faustian bargains with celebrity and short term gain.


The real test will come as we see this initial advice play out in the course 
of the text. With these simple words, Confucius sets the bar very high for 
those in public life.
Analects 1.4


The fourth passage introduces one of the most important themes in the 
entire text of the Analects, and it is one of Confucius’s most devoted students 
who speaks—Zengzi, or “Master Zeng.” It stresses that proper conduct in 
itself won’t do. Truly serious people must also examine their actions every 
single day. They should note their successes, to be sure, but they must above 
all reflect on where they failed to live up to their own standards.
1.4
Master Zeng said, “I examine my person and conduct every 
day in three ways. First, in my interactions with others, have 
I done all that I can? Second, when dealing with friends 
and peers, have I managed to keep my word? Finally, have I 
reviewed and acted upon what I have learned?”


This fourth passage in the Analects shows that the book will not only 
be made up of the ideas of the Master, Confucius, himself. It will be a 
collaborative effort centered on Confucius’s teachings, but multiple voices 
will speak throughout the text.


The heart of Zengzi’s message lies in self-reflection, and we will see the 
theme of continual reflection upon, and repair of, both self and society in 
the Analects. This theme goes well back in Chinese culture.

Lecture 6—The Analects in Miniature  41


Zengzi’s genius here lies in bringing the concept of examination and repair 
to the level of the individual, and this key move would cast a very long 
shadow in Confucian thought over the centuries. Of course, it is not 
Zengzi’s idea alone. But in the context of the Analects, it appears early and 
in Zengzi’s words.


Zengzi’s words contains three related ideas. He asks himself daily about his 
interactions with others—has he done all that he can? Next, he reflects 
upon his dealings with friends and peers who are relative equals in terms 
of the social hierarchies of his day—has he kept his word? Finally, has 
he reviewed and acted upon what he has learned? These very questions 
would become a significant part of daily self-examination rituals practiced 
by later Confucians for 2,500 years.
Analects 1.5


The first five passages of the Analects are an effective miniature of the 
work as a whole, a wonderful introduction to a complex text.


Entry five adds one more key element to this miniaturized tale. If the 
other four stressed individuals and social interactions, the fifth is about 
running the whole show. Confucius speaks again, as he has in Analects 1.1 
and 1.3, and his topic now is how to run a state.
1.5
The Master said, “In leading a state of a thousand chariots, 
respectfully undertake your responsibilities and keep your 
word in all of your dealings. Be frugal in your expenditures, 
and care for others. Employ the working people in state 
projects only at the proper times of the year.”


Notice the focus of Confucius’s examples. Above all, we see again the 
importance of keeping one’s word.

42  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Frugality is another theme that Confucius, his pupils, and Confucian 
scholars through the centuries would emphasize, often to complete lack 
of interest on the part of the rulers they served. Notice how Confucius 
here links frugality and care for others. For Confucian thinkers, frugality, 
care for others, and keeping one’s word were all of a piece.


The ending is exquisitely poignant for those who have spent a great deal 
of time reading Chinese history—or, really, the history of any large polity 
or world empire. Confucius doesn’t just leave his message at “frugality.” 
He senses something that would be even more detrimental to ruling 
families than the social woes caused by spendthrift ways—such as building 
exquisite palaces, gardens, and terraces, or hosting lavish banquets that 
strain the treasury.


According to Confucius, if a ruler took the rural farmers out of their fields 
to participate in what is called corvée labor—required work on behalf of 
the government—it needed to be in the agricultural downtime of the late 
fall and winter, if at all. To take farmers from their fields during planting or 
harvest was to endanger not only their lives, but the health of the entire 
state.

Questions to Consider
1.	 At the end of Analects 1.1, Confucius notes that one of the highest 
virtues is to be unknown, yet not resentful. Think about people or 
situations in which these words resonate.
2.	 In Analects 1.2, we learn that being an effective member of society 
begins at home. Many other thinkers have stated similar thoughts all 
over the world. Who are some of them?
3.	 In Analects 1.3, we hear that slick words and flashy appearance rarely 
lead to the highest levels of conduct. This, too, has been said all over the 
world. When and where have similar sentiments been voiced?

Lecture 7
Learning to Read the 
Analects
W
hat we think of today as the “received text” of the Analects 
took many centuries to take shape. Tomb fragments that 
have been discovered—with the text still in flux—show a 
document four centuries old that still was awaiting “final” form. And even 
though there are really no absolute rules when it comes to the structure 
and patterning of the Analects, the observations in this lecture will help 
you to negotiate a chapter-by-chapter reading of the text.
The Accuracy of the Analects


Readers of the Analects are well served by focusing on early chapters. The 
earlier you are in the text, the more likely you are to be reading selections 
that were composed in the century or so after Confucius’s death.


There is nothing that we can do to change the basic fact that the Analects 
was written entirely by others. Not a word of it was written by Confucius. 
It is even unlikely that very much in the text we have today represents 
the memory of an actual student of Confucius’s who might be recalling a 
precise phrase decades after the sage uttered it.


A core textual issue appears once we realize that a given passage from 
the Analects may have been written 10 years, 100 years, or even 300 years 
after the fact. Nevertheless, we should not assume without reflection that 
a document written 300 years after the fact is less accurate than one 
written, for example, 200 years after the fact. Both are so distant from 

Lecture 7—Learning to Read the Analects  45
the original events that it would be a serious mistake to assume that date 
alone can help us.


If we are going to understand what Confucius’s Analects might teach us, 
we must come to terms with what it cannot. It cannot bring us face-to-
face with Confucius’s finest teaching moments. Instead, we must gain a 
nuanced understanding of what parts of the text that are nearer to the 
events are useful and what parts less so; what parts further from them 
are useful and what parts less so.


There is a fair bit of evidence that the earlier chapters of the Analects 
tend to be some of the oldest. Scholars have spent a great deal of time 
parsing the materials with an eye toward understanding which materials 
might have been the direct, or close-to-direct, work of Confucius’s actual 
followers and their own followers.


A large number of scholars over the centuries have suspected quite 
strongly that chapters 4–8 (or 4–9) form a kind of solid working-core 
of the text, although not everyone agrees. The most general wisdom has 
been that the first 15 chapters are the oldest strata of text, and that the 
last five are an eclectic blend of early thoughts and later reflections, put 
together by followers of followers of followers (and beyond). Chapter 20, 
almost everyone agrees, could not have been written until many years 
after Confucius’s death.


For our purposes, we will divide the text this way: Chapters 1–3 form 
a kind of introduction, and chapters 4–8 comprise the core of what 
Confucius’s own students wrote, albeit probably decades after the fact. 


Chapters 9–11 are among the most interesting in the entire text of the 
Analects. They cover in detail what Confucius was like as a person, and 
they provide, by far, the majority of Analects statements that do not begin 
with Confucius’s own words (“the Master said…”). Most scholars think 
that these three chapters were written by a generation of students-of-
students. These statements are bound to be more general. Whether 
they are less accurate is another question. We should not assume lack 

46  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
of accuracy just because of temporal distance, although we should be 
careful.


After chapters 9–11, There is a great deal of material left (fully half of 
the text). This material is a mix of statements beginning with “the Master 
said…” and more distant reflections. This last half is the hardest part of the 
Analects to study with any strong sense of where the material came from.


Note that at the very end of each chapter, especially in the last nine chapters 
of the text, the last statement or two may seem to come from nowhere 
we have seen before. It is highly probable that several of the final items in 
Analects chapters are the work of eager writers who, many years after the 
Analects began to be assembled, decided to add their own thoughts to the 
material. Occasionally, they wrote about topics completely unrelated to the 
Analects. As a result, we should be wary, at the very least, about framing any 
grand arguments around only a chapter-ending string of text.
Themes in the Early Chapters


If we think about chapters 1–3 as broadly introductory, we can begin to 
see several themes. In Analects 2.1, Confucius explains the broad principle 
of ruling with virtue. The ruler stays put; everything else orbits around 
that figure.
2.1
The Master said, “To govern with excellence and virtue 
(德) is analogous to the Pole Star; it resides in its fixed 
place, while the multitude of stars encircle it.”


This entry in the Analects is a fine example of the way that Chinese 
cosmological thought merged with Confucius’s teaching. Some of the 
other schools of thought in Confucius’s era were interested in larger 
questions about how the universe operates and the role of individuals 

Lecture 7—Learning to Read the Analects  47
and societies within it. Confucius himself was not especially interested in 
such ideas. He states at various points in the Analects his lack of desire to 
ponder questions far beyond the human world. 


Nevertheless, in describing how a ruler should rule with excellence 
and virtue, the analogy to the heavens is right there. Like the pole star, 
the ruler remains fixed in place, and the other stars—the whirlwind of 
life and politics—takes place around him. This idea of a fixed center of 
political authority is a powerful and persistent one in Chinese thought. It 
would be many centuries, however, before later Confucians would make 
a conscious move to link the Analects to a larger cosmology more directly.


In Analects 3.1, Confucius expresses his disgust with powerful families in 
his own time. He is exasperated by the overreach of the Ji clan, who had 
usurped kingly and even imperial rituals and benefits for decades.
3.1
Confucius said of the Ji clan, “Eight rows of eight dancers 
in their courtyard—if this conduct can be tolerated, what 
conduct cannot be tolerated?”


Chinese culture has, since ancient times, placed great symbolic significance 
in numbers, and eight rows of eight dancers—a unit of 64 dancers—
had such a cosmological significance that it was permitted to be used 
only by the Zhou king himself. Confucius was offended by the Ji clan’s 
shameless appropriation of an imperial tradition. To Confucius, it signaled a 
fundamental lack of understanding of ritual in Zhou society that Confucius 
saw as the center of all governance.
Illustrative Passages


What follows are several passages from chapter 5 that illustrate the 
teachings and structure of the Analects. Examination of these passages will 

48  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
give you a continuous sense of what you will find in the Analects when 
you begin to tackle it for yourself.


In Analects 5.11, Confucius engages in a quite common practice of his—
criticizing someone who is not participating in the discussion. More than 
a few entries in the Analects express a judgment of another person, and it 
is often a quite withering one. Confucius was not shy about rendering his 
opinion, and a pupil named Shen Cheng is the object of his derision here.
5.11
The Master said, “I have never met a person who is truly 
unwavering.” Someone asked, “What about Shen Cheng?” 
“Shen Cheng is insatiable in his desires; how could he be 
called ‘unwavering’?”


The commentaries on the Analects 
don’t tell us much about this pupil, 
Shen Cheng, but he quickly became 
known to centuries of students 
as “the acquisitive one.” Note in 
particular how Confucius links the 
positive trait of being unwavering—
the Chinese character connotes an 
iron-like strength—with the negative 
trait of being insatiable. The latter 
undercuts the former.


As a result of the human tendency 
to juxtapose entries that likely have 
little connection, it is difficult to 
ignore the fact that Confucius, in 
the very next entry, criticizes one of 
his students quite directly. Criticizing 

Lecture 7—Learning to Read the Analects  49
students is a common theme in the Analects, and it seems to suggest 
pedagogical inflexibility on the part of the Master. Here, Zigong just isn’t 
ready in the Master’s eyes for the ideals he expresses.
5.12
Zigong said, “I do not wish others to impose upon me, 
just as I also wish not to impose upon others.” The Master 
replied, “Zigong, such lofty abilities are far beyond you.”


Confucius’s response is even harsher than it might sound in isolation, 
because Zigong here is echoing the kind of statement that his fellow 
student, Zengzi, made in Analects 1.4—that he aspires to a kind of daily 
self-examination. Zigong was simply channeling the sayings of his colleague 
and his teacher, but he is told in return that he is lacking. In the very next 
entry, however, Zigong is allowed to speak with authority.
5.13
Zigong said, “We followers can gain much from the Master’s 
wide-ranging learning, and yet we hear little from him on 
subjects such as ‘human nature’ or ‘the Way of Heaven.’”


Except for the fact that we just saw him put in place by his teacher, Zigong 
sounds like he knows a great deal here in Analects 5.13. Indeed, Zigong 
speaks to the very reticence Confucius mostly had in speaking about 
human nature and the cosmos.


Turning in Analects 5.14 to another disciple, the Analects describes Zilu as 
fearful about acting upon his learning without adequate knowledge.

50  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
5.14
Upon learning something new, Zilu feared only that—
before putting the teachings into practice—he would learn 
something further.


This seems to be the very picture of trepidation. However, a scan of the 
commentaries shows that for some interpreters, the passage was meant 
to be a relatively positive portrayal, and that the penultimate Chinese 
character in the last phrase should have been rendered “hear it again.” 
That changes the meaning quite dramatically.
5.14
Upon learning something new, Zilu feared only that—
before putting the teachings into practice—he would hear 
it again before taking action.


One way to look at Zilu’s fear here is that he would begin to hear the 
drumbeat of what he has learned to make himself and others better 
without doing anything about it. 


From this final example, but also the sequence of four entries in a key 
chapter, we can begin to perceive some of the challenges in reading 
Confucius’s Analects. Just one Chinese character—same pronunciation, 
but written differently (有/又)—changes a good portion of the meaning 
in this last entry. “Learning something more” becomes “hearing something 
again,” depending on which character is used. While most statements in 
the text don’t open themselves up to such a profound level of change, 
this should show the combination of rigor and creativity that is required 
to read the Analects well.

Lecture 8
Confucius’s Students:  
Zai Wo and Yan Hui
W
hile every entry in the Analects should be examined for 
the teaching dynamic between Confucius and his students, 
there is a cluster of passages that speak directly to the way 
that Confucius taught, his relationships with students, and the students 
themselves. Recall that Confucius spent well over a decade on the road 
before he returned to Lu in 484 B.C.E. and opened his academy. During 
those travels, he was accompanied by four students, core supporters who 
knew the sage best. You will learn about two of them in this lecture: Zai 
Wo and Yan Hui.
Confucius’s Teaching Methods


One of Confucius’s basic teaching methods was to begin by posing a 
question and then setting students to work on it. He was not afraid to be 
critical, and his standards were high. On the other hand, many passages in 
the Analects begin with a student or other individual making a statement 
(or asking a question) and Confucius responding. While a lesson can 
always be derived from these exchanges, they also offer wonderful insights 
into what Confucius thought of his students and vice versa.


The social life of Confucius’s school is very difficult to glean from the text 
of the Analects. We can get an occasional glimpse of students jockeying for 
position and favor (successfully and unsuccessfully) within the school and 
beyond—in the world of court life and administrative employment. These 

Lecture 8—Confucius’s Students: Zai Wo and Yan Hui   53
glimpses can tell us a great deal about how the school functioned, even 
though no equivalent of a mission statement has ever been found. 


Confucius demanded discipline, but he was intensely creative. Confucius 
stated that he would not continue to teach a student who, after he 
revealed one-quarter of a problem, could not unravel the other three-
quarters. He taught them how to think, and students needed to use all 
of their learning to craft solutions. In this, Confucius showed a suppleness 
that very few later critics understood. He was not a teacher of rigid 
structures, but rather one who tried to teach his students to use a solid 
foundation of learning to create solutions to complex problems.
Zai Wo


Confucius had very little patience for sloth, as he perceived it. One of 
those diligent pupils who accompanied Confucius on his lengthy travels 
happened to take a nap one day. Confucius was reportedly so shocked 
by that behavior that he not only excoriated the student, but changed his 
entire attitude toward humanity.
5.10
Zai Wo lay asleep during daylight hours. The Master said, 
“Decaying wood cannot be carved, and walls of dung 
cannot be troweled. With conduct this out-of-line, why 
should I even bother to scold him?” The Master continued, 
“When younger, I used to deal with others by listening to 
what they said and believing they would follow through 
on their words. Now, when dealing with others, I listen to 
what they say and then observe the actions they take. It is 
because of Zai Wo that I have changed.”

54  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Few offenses could rival the choice, at least in Confucius’s mind, of sleeping 
when you could be using the precious few hours of available daylight to 
study. Wasted daylight was wasted life.


Zai Wo comes off very badly here, but there are other passages that help 
to round out a bit more of his character. Few wayward students have 
borne anything like the centuries-long brunt of their teacher’s anger the 
way that Zai Wo has. He clearly was devoted to Confucius, as he was with 
him for the better part of two decades. The following is a different look at 
a prickly and, at times, annoyingly interesting student.


Probing some of the most important territory in the teachings of the 
Analects, Zai Wo asks Confucius how far one should go in the pursuit of 
consummate conduct. Here he seemingly sets a rhetorical trap for his 
teacher.
6.26
Zai Wo asked, “If someone told a person of consummate 
conduct that there was another consummate person down 
in a well, should he go down after him?” The Master 
replied, “Why would he do that? The exemplary person 
can seek to help, but he cannot be ensnared; he can be 
deceived, perhaps, but not duped.”


Confucius doesn’t take the bait, but we can see that Zai Wo, despite 
his sleepy behavior in one passage, was, at once, a prickly personality, 
a persistent investigator, and a student devoted in his own way to his 
teacher. 


A fascinating figure fills mythological literature all over the world—from 
Europe to the Americas, throughout Australia, and all over Asia. It is that 
of the trickster. The term is a difficult one to define, but tricksters can 
almost always be seen as slippery figures who show more than occasional 

Lecture 8—Confucius’s Students: Zai Wo and Yan Hui   55
glimpses of brilliance, even as they play at petty antics that often infuriate 
more storied and seemingly serious figures in the tales


Zai Wo as trickster: If we can even begin to imagine such a thing, the 
Analects takes on a wholly new dimension that enters the realm of 
mythology. This is appropriate, given the enormous role that the text has 
played in Chinese history. If we can begin to think of Zai Wo as a linchpin 
in the Analects—even in the few passages in which he is present—we 
might perceive other figures in a more “mythistorical” dimension (a 
merging of myth and history) that is meant to teach larger lessons beyond 
the greatness or failures of individual human beings. 
Yan Hui


Confucius clearly had a favorite student—favorite by far—and that was 
Yan Hui, sometimes referred to as Yan Yuan. Confucius was ambivalent 
about almost every one of his disciples, but not Yan Hui. Yan Hui was the 
crème de la crème, and Confucius mourned his far-too-early death. In 
Chinese lore, there never has been a student who could match him.


Teachers who are confident of their abilities, as Confucius surely was, 
rarely speak of a student matching them. However, while Yan Hui was 
still alive, Confucius’s pupil Zigong came to Confucius and asked what he 
thought about Zigong’s abilities. In one of the most memorable lines in 
the Analects, Confucius says, “You do not approach Yan Hui; neither of us 
approaches him.”


Perhaps the best place to begin our examination of Yan Hui is with a 
retrospective comment about him that comes fairly early in the book, 
in chapter 6. Duke Ai of Lu, asks Confucius about learning. The term 
he uses is haoxue, and the two Chinese characters that convey it have 
taken on a power far beyond their ordinary meaning (which is simply “to 
like learning”) because of statements such as this one. They have come 
to mean a mixture of desire, yearning, hard work, and talent, all rolled 
together into one neat and seemingly simple concept.

56  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
6.3
Duke Ai asked Confucius, “Among your disciples, can any 
be said truly to love learning? Confucius replied, “There 
was one—Yan Hui. He truly was eager to learn. He did 
not let anger taint his interactions with others, and he 
never made the same mistake twice. Alas, his life was 
brief, and he died young. Now, no one I have encountered 
approaches Yan Hui’s desire to learn and improve.”


We can see some of the things that Confucius valued in a student here. 
Love of learning was foremost, but notice what follows it. Confucius was a 
taskmaster, but he knew that people made errors. What he valued above 
all was learning from errors and not making the mistake again. On top of 
that, we see that Yan Hui kept his emotions in check. This passage is truly a 
framework for what Confucius valued in a student.


The picture Confucius paints in his statements about Yan Hui contribute 
to an exemplary story of fortitude and persistence that has been admired 
all the way up to the present. It is not an easy path, and many students 
from Yan Hui’s time onward have given up long before they have even 
begun to approach Yan Hui’s dedication.


When Yan Hui died, Confucius wept. His response was so far beyond 
the ritual propriety that he himself taught to others that his pupils were 
stunned. It is one of the most human elements in the entire text of the 
Analects.


Confucius taught that there were strict ritual observances with regard to 
everything from mealtime etiquette and the simplest of village traditions 
to the proceedings of the loftiest courts of his era. And in the hierarchical 
world of Confucius’s Zhou dynasty, it was unseemly to express too 
much emotion upon the death of someone of lower rank. Nevertheless, 
Confucius mourned so intensely for Yan Hui that many of those around 

Lecture 8—Confucius’s Students: Zai Wo and Yan Hui   57
him worried about his health—both mental and physical, as we would 
characterize it today.
11.9
When Yan Hui died, the Master grieved, “Alas! Heaven has 
overwhelmed me! Heaven has overwhelmed me!”
11.10
When Yan Hui died, Confucius wept for him without 
restraint. His followers worried, saying “Master, you weep 
without restraint!” The Master replied, “I weep without 
restraint? If not for Yan Hui, then for whom would I weep 
without restraint?”


Not long after his extreme and seemingly sincere expressions of grief, 
however, Confucius appears to have returned to his ritual-observing, 
social-compartmentalizing earlier self.
11.8
When Yan Hui died, his father, Yan Lu, asked the Master 
for his carriage, hoping that it could be sold, and the money 
used to pay for an outer coffin for his son. Confucius 
declined, saying, “Whether talented or not, everyone 
speaks on behalf of a son. When my own son, Boyu, 
died, I provided an inner coffin, but could not afford an 
outer coffin. It was necessary that I retained my carriage, 
because—having held a rank just below the state ministers—
it would not be appropriate for me to go on foot.”

58  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


This appears to be a rather rapid change of mood on the part of the 
venerable sage. We know enough about the intervals between death 
and funerary observances in early China to see that we are talking about 
mere days, not weeks or months. That is not a great deal of time to mourn 
intensely, reflect, adjust, and return to the solid core of ritual observance 
that defined Confucius’s life.


Giving up his carriage so that Yan Hui’s father could provide an outer 
coffin would have created several levels of problems for Confucius. Not 
only Confucius realize that providing a pupil with an outer coffin exceeds 
by far what he could do for his own son, who also died young, but his own 
place in a shaky social order required that he ride in a carriage. Apparently, 
there were limits to Confucius’s grief.


We have a small handful of entries that seem to express Yan Hui’s own 
voice. In a strict sense, of course, this is impossible, because Yan Hui died 
before Confucius and even Confucius’s own words in the Analects had been 
pieced together by those who lived after him. Nevertheless, the entry that 
follows gives us a sense of Yan Hui the student, the scholar, and the idealist.
9.11
Yan Hui sighed deeply, saying, “The more I turn my gaze 
upward, the higher it all appears; the more resolutely I bore 
into it, the more impenetrable it becomes. I look for it in 
front of me, yet suddenly it is behind me. The Master leads 
me step-by-step, beckoning me ever-forward; he broadens 
my learning in cultural matters, yet channels my thoughts 
and actions with ritual practice. Even had I wanted to quit, 
I would be unable to do so. When I feel that my talents are 
completely spent, it is as though something more towers 
above me. Yet even though I wish to follow after it, there is 
no way to bridge the gap.”

Lecture 8—Confucius’s Students: Zai Wo and Yan Hui   59


In deeply human fashion, Yan Hui speaks here of striving, toiling, and 
even doubting himself. It is one of the most beautiful passages in the 
Analects, because it shows the formidable combination of learning, seeking, 
following, and being overcome with concern. It shows exactly why the 
Master found Yan Hui to be a truly special follower.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Confucius seemingly said that one of his students surpassed him. 
Think about situations in our lives in which we either acknowledge or 
celebrate people surpassing us. Why would someone who is already 
acknowledged as a leader celebrate one of his students surpassing him?
2.	 Think about tricksters—people who disrupt the normal functioning of 
social relations. How can they be useful in society?
3.	 Confucius experienced (according to the Analects) a sense of 
overwhelming sorrow when his follower Yan Hui died. How does 
unexpected loss affect individuals and groups?

Lecture 9
Confucius’s Students:  
Zilu and Zigong
Y
ou have already met Zai Wo and Yan Hui, two students who 
accompanied Confucius on his travels and who later studied with 
him at his teaching academy. In this lecture, you will learn about 
two other followers, Zilu and Zigong, who were also with Confucius 
during much of his long journey and afterward. As you study the entries in 
which each of them are mentioned, you will begin to get a picture of the 
lives and characters of these two core students.
Zilu


Zilu is one of the most difficult figures in the Analects to characterize. 
A close reading of the passages in which he appears reveals him to 
possess a surprisingly nuanced character. In some passages, Zilu shows an 
ambitious streak, and Confucius more than occasionally attempts to slow 
him down. In other passages, however, Zilu exhibits a devotion to learning 
and the Way that belies the common characterizations of him as foolish 
and headstrong.


The bulk of Analects passages featuring Zilu—more than two dozen in 
all—portray an individual who just might be in over his head in the refined 
and disciplined world of Confucius’s academy. Yet there he remains, by 
Confucius’s side, even as other disciples receive less thorough treatment.


Confucius could be extremely critical of Zilu, and many of his fellow 
students were quick to follow the Master’s critical comments and be 

Lecture 9—Confucius’s Students: Zilu and Zigong   61
dismissive of Zilu. In the world of the Analects, Zilu has a rough-and-ready 
character.


Consider the beginning of a long passage that seems tailor-made for 
gaining the goodwill of the Master. It seems almost to be a set-up, until 
Zilu quibbles and it all backfires. Zilu starts out by playing the role of 
gentle critic, only to be schooled by the Master.
13.3..
Zilu asked, “If the ruler of Wei gave you management of 
his state, what would you do first?” The Master replied, 
“First, I would make sure that names and terms were used 
correctly!” Zilu responded, “You would do that first? Why 
such impracticality? Who cares about proper naming?”
The Master replied, “How can you be such a rube? 
Exemplary people seek guidance in issues they don’t 
comprehend. When names are not used precisely, 
communication is ambiguous. When language is 
ambiguous, affairs will remain unsettled. When affairs 
are unsettled, the channeling power of music and ritual 
conduct will wither. When music and ritual withers, 
administration of punishments will go awry and the people 
will be utterly confused. Therefore, when exemplary 
people give a name to something, it most certainly can be 
clearly articulated.
When clearly articulated, it can definitely be put into 
practice. When it comes to the use of language, there is 
absolutely nothing scattered or careless about the words of 
the exemplary person.”

62  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


In this passage, Confucius explains how entirely wrong Zilu really had it. 
If language is not used properly, ritual propriety will eventually fragment, 
music will not flourish, and eventually even laws and punishments will fall 
out of order. Confucius concludes with a scolding that seems directed as 
much at Zilu himself as future generations.


The theme of Zilu-as-rustic may perhaps nowhere be seen more clearly 
than in a charmingly naïve scene when Confucius praises the wayward 
pupil—and the pupil is perhaps just a bit too happy with the situation.
9.27
The Master said, “If there is anyone who would be 
unashamed to stand next to an official displaying apparel 
made from the fur of fox or badger, that person surely 
would by Zilu.” He quoted a line stanza from the Book of 
Songs to illustrate.
Not envious, not covetous
How could he not be good?
After hearing this encomium, Zilu recited the lines over 
and over. The Master chided him, “These brief lines—how 
is it that you make such a treasure of them?”


Confucius begins with warm praise, and finishes by undercutting it almost 
entirely. It is a lesson in the power of encouragement, to be sure, but also 
a fascinating window into the relationship between Confucius and one of 
his stalwart followers.


Zilu’s actions can quite accurately be summed up as headstrong—
whether he was engrossed in study or dreams of official employment. 

Lecture 9—Confucius’s Students: Zilu and Zigong   63
Confucius himself often chastised Zilu for being foolhardy, and predicted 
that he would come to a very bad end.


The Analects contains many negative remarks about Zilu, and it would 
be easy just to dismiss him as a crude and unreflective bumpkin. Such 
a dismissal would be a serious mistake, however. Zilu is as fascinating a 
figure as there is in the Analects, and precisely because his conduct is so 
wide-ranging (veering between going too far, as the Master noted, to his 
simple expressions of joy at Confucius’s praise). 
Zigong


Zigong is another fascinating figure in the Analects. Unlike Zai Wo, Zilu, or 
even Yan Hui, Zigong knew how to elicit ever-deeper teachings from the 
master. He exhibited aspects of almost all of the positive qualities shown 
by his peers Zai Wo, Yan Hui, Zilu, and others. He listened intently, sought 
to put the teachings into practice, and was open to being criticized. But in 
one of the most famous entries in the Analects, Confucius called Zigong 
“a tool.” This is not meant in the idiomatic American English sense—
the larger context combines “implement” and “vessel”—but it is almost 
equally problematic.


Consider the following statement from chapter 2.
2.12
The Master said, “The exemplary person is not a ritual 
vessel.”


This brief statement has puzzled interpreters over the ages. Some 
commentaries have stressed that the meaning of “ritual vessel” refers to 
an object used only for limited, special functions. Others have interpreted 
it in almost the opposite sense—the exemplary person is not a “tool.” 
Either way, imagine a reader’s surprise when, three chapters later, the 

64  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
following statement appears directly after Confucius praises another 
follower, calling that fellow an “exemplary person.” 
5.4
Zigong asked, “What do you think of me?” The Master 
replied, “You are a vessel.” Zigong asked further, “What 
kind of vessel am I?” “The Master replied, “A hu or lian 
vessel—specialized and precious, yet not meant to function 
in diverse circumstances.”


This exchange tells us much about both Zigong and Confucius. One way 
of reading Confucius’s second statement is that he let up a little, easing the 
wound of his first statement. Another reading considers such exchanges 
as taking place between an avid student and a critical, but caring, teacher—
Confucius is not afraid to be tough on Zigong because he knows that he 
can take it.


The three dozen Zigong entries in the Analects provide several more 
examples of Confucius taking his follower to task. Perhaps the most 
telling comes in chapter 3, when Zigong sought to cut a few corners in a 
significant ceremony.
3.17
Zigong wished to abandon the almost defunct ritual 
practice of sacrificing a sheep at the New Moon ceremony 
each lunar month. The Master said, “Zigong! You begrudge 
the price of the sheep. I value the ritual as it is meant to be 
conducted.”

Lecture 9—Confucius’s Students: Zilu and Zigong   65


As every experienced reader of the Analects knows, ritual propriety takes 
precedence over considerations of cost, and mere accounting is no match 
for the requirements of an important sacrifice.


The broad sweep of the Zigong entries shows a student who had a 
knack for teasing out the teachings of his mentor and perhaps even taking 
several of his fellow students down a notch.


Zigong seemingly comes into his own in the later chapters of the Analects. 
Of course, there was only a very loose sense of narrative control exercised 
upon the Analects, and as you have learned, we know little about how it 
was crafted. Still, for the careful reader of the Zigong passages—especially 
when they are read as a unit—the student comes into his own, both as 
an articulator of ethical conduct and as a fierce defender of his teacher. In 
six consecutive passages from Analects 19.20–19.25, Zigong becomes the 
one who schools people who are just a bit too glib with their own words.


Zigong, perhaps more than any of Confucius’s core followers, showed 
distinct, even dramatic, growth in the actual unfolding of the chapters of 
the Analects. It is tempting to see the placement of these passages as 
a constructed narrative. It works well, however, to consider the matter 
loosely as the way in which a diligent student—and one who makes more 
than a few mistakes along the way—rises to become a teacher in his own 
right, never forgetting the skills imparted by his teacher.
Understanding the Characters in the Analects 


We have now discussed four of Confucius’s followers: Zai Wo, Yan Hui, 
Zilu, and Zigong. These four students were at least 20 and probably 30 or 
more years younger than their teacher. They made their ways on a long 
journey with Confucius, and all ended up back with him in his academy in 
Lu. All pushed the sage in directions that can teach us new things about 
the world of the Analects and about ourselves.


The Analects passages containing the names of these four students 
amount to almost a quarter of the text; with Confucius himself, they 

66  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
make up a strong plurality of entries. With their characterizations firmly in 
mind, you should now be able to imagine a distinct student-type for each 
of them. They will provide an anchor of sorts as the complexity of the 
Analects continues to unfold, but only if you work to use this information 
to understand the text.


The key to grasping the multiple personalities in the Analects lies in 
mastering five figures—Confucius and his four most consistent (and often 
most ardent) followers. They form a small community of teaching and 
learning that will expand as you read.


As you gain confidence in the subtleties of Zai Wo, Yan Hui, Zilu, and Zigong, 
the other characters in the Analects will begin to come to life in a way that 
does not happen if you simply read a cast of characters. Like the characters 
in a play, the personalities of Confucius’s students come to life in action and 
around ideas that have shaped Chinese thought for 25 centuries.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Confucius had a tendency to put down his followers, even if he thought 
highly of them. What role (positive and negative) does a teacher’s put-
down play in education?
2.	 Zilu seemed bored by Confucius’s emphasis on precise language in 
shaping government and society. Confucius is adamant about getting the 
language right. Is precise language important in our lives?

Lecture 10
Confucius on the Purpose of 
Learning
T
hroughout world history, a certain kind of thinker has asked a 
persistent question: What is the purpose of learning? The question 
and its answers mattered intensely to Confucius, and he weighs in 
over the course of the Analects from many perspectives. This dynamic is 
part of what makes reading the received Analects, from beginning to end, 
a worthwhile practice.
The Exemplary Person and the Petty Person


In the Analects, the staccato pacing of themes concerning the purpose 
of learning seems like the pattern of a seminar with a gifted teacher. 
Consider the following passage about the relationship between learning 
and the larger world.
13.5
The Master said, “If people can recite the three hundred 
items in the Book of Songs, yet still fail to make use of 
that knowledge when given an official position—or when 
sent abroad on diplomatic missions—what is the use of 
studying? Even though they have learned so much, what is 
the use of it to them?”

68  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


The text referred to in this 
passage is to one of the core 
works of the Chinese classics, 
the 
Book 
of 
Songs, 
which 
Confucius deeply admired as 
a source of wisdom. Without 
being able to bring one’s 
learning into the hurly-burly 
world of action, Confucius says, 
mere study means little.


Confucius believed that his 
teachings, which to his mind 
were the teachings of the 
ages, were meant to be put 
directly 
into 
practice. 
The 
Confucian school’s belief was 
that its teaching was about the 
management of a harmonious 
society 
under 
heaven—that 
is, the essentially infinite realm 
of the Chinese state as it was 
conceived in Confucius’s day. 


The purpose of learning in Confucius’s world was service—more 
specifically, service in a hierarchically organized political structure in which 
rulers were replaced by eldest sons in the best of times and usurpers in 
the worst of them. Confucius believed that his era was on its way to the 
worst of times, and that only proper teaching of the Book of Songs, the 
rites, and music could stem the negative tide.


Much of Confucius’s personal frustration grew directly from his own 
inability to merge pure and practical learning, or to convince anyone to 
give him a position of importance that he could use to show just how 
effective his teachings could be. As much as he believed that careful study 

Lecture 10—Confucius on the Purpose of Learning  69
of the Book of Songs led him toward better service, he never had a real 
opportunity to show it. He hoped to do so through his students.


Consider the exchange between master and disciple in the following passage, 
in which we see Confucius’s nuanced and politically aware statement about 
how to bring one’s character and teachings to the larger world.
13.24
Zigong asked Confucius, “‘Everyone in the community 
admires a person’—what do you think of that saying?” 
“That is not sufficient,” answered the Master. Zigong 
continued, “‘Everyone in the village despises a person’—
what about that?” “It is still not sufficient,” answered the 
Master. He continued, “It would be far preferable if the 
community members who are good express admiration and 
those lacking in goodness despise him.”


This idealistic statement on the part of the sage is one of the most 
problematic in the Analects. To be admired by those who are “good” 
and despised by those “lacking in goodness” is fraught with problems in 
all but the simplest worlds of good and bad. Translating this statement 
to a world of political intrigue, power, and endless machinations (as in 
Confucius’s own 6th–5th century B.C.E. society) makes the observation 
all but useless beyond those who have already bought into Confucius’s 
worldview.


Many critics considered Confucius’s ideas to be hopelessly naïve. It is 
clear, however, that Confucius was adamant in his position. The very next 
passage presents a contrast that Confucius draws throughout the Analects: 
the exemplary person and the petty person.

70  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
13.25
The Master said, “Exemplary people are easy to serve 
and difficult to please. Trying to please them with 
conduct contravening the Way will displease them. When 
employing others, they utilize them with an understanding 
of their capacities. Petty people are difficult to serve but 
easy to please. Trying to please them with conduct that 
contravenes the Way is little problem for them, yet when 
employing others, they hold unreasonable expectations and 
expect them to be good at everything.”


Confucius’s phrase about the “petty people” does not refer to peasants, 
ordinary shopkeepers, or humble people (as Confucius himself was born) 
all over his world. Confucius’s petty person is someone who is as talented 
as his finest students but is so self-absorbed, so focused on his own goals 
and needs, that he perverts what is good for society for his own ends.


Consider the next passage, a much briefer and more pungent entry.
13.26
The Master said, “Exemplary people are venerable but not 
haughty; petty people are haughty but not venerable.”


There are many more such passages. The contrast between the exemplary 
person and the petty person is a monumental one in the Analects, and it 
goes to the heart of Confucius’s teachings about how he and his students 
needed to relate to the wider world.

Lecture 10—Confucius on the Purpose of Learning  71
The World of Public Affairs


A large portion of the teaching messages in the Analects hover somewhere 
between discussion of individual character and matters of larger political 
attention. These messages teach us how to move from the principles which 
should be guiding us in our own lives to shaping the larger world around us.


Consider the following exchange, which sums up the relationship between 
studying, reflection, and action. Those who overlearn Confucius’s teachings 
often choose pondering over practice. Confucius disabuses his students of 
any such idea.
5.20
Ji Wenzi thought three times before taking action. Upon 
hearing this, the Master said, “Twice is enough.”


This brief entry is a beautiful rejoinder to those critics, in East Asia and 
the West, who wish to caricature Confucius as an endlessly dallying 
pedagogue, unable to muster the decision-making to accomplish anything 
in the real world.


There are three consecutive passages in chapter 8 that are especially 
intriguing when it comes to thinking about the relationship between 
learning and public service. Recall that the larger point of learning in 
Confucius’s view was to be prepared to serve. Confucius—and especially 
his follower Yan Hui—embraced the notion of personal growth, and the 
tradition that would become associated with Confucius made personal 
growth all-important. For the sage himself, however, the transition from 
personal growth to employment was especially tricky. Confucius wanted 
his students to be prepared to serve, but he didn’t want them to be in 
too much of a hurry.

72  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
8.12
The Master said, “Someone who studies for three years 
without turning attention to official employment and 
salary—this is not easy to find these days.”


Confucius’s reputation as a teacher, even in the small state of Lu 2,500 years 
ago, was enhanced when his best students joined the court and received 
an official salary. On the other hand, if they were not polished enough, real 
trouble could lie ahead, and one’s reputation could just as easily be tarnished. 


Confucius goes further in Analects 8.14.
8.14
The Master said, “Do not involve yourself in official matters 
for positions you do not hold.”


Here Confucius cautions that students (and officials already holding positions) 
should focus on the present. Whether thinking about future positions leads 
to time-wasting or severe meddling, it is useless from Confucius’s perspective. 
Focus on your role, Confucius says. Keep in tune with the times and be ready 
for either frustration or advancement, but do not let thoughts of another 
position occupy too many of your present thoughts.


Now consider the longer passage between these two brief gems of insight.
8.13
The Master said, “Be deeply committed to love of learning 
and maintain, even unto death, the sterling Way (善道). 
A state in turmoil should not be entered, and an agitated 

Lecture 10—Confucius on the Purpose of Learning  73
realm is no place to reside. When a state possesses the Way, 
it is right to be celebrated, but when it does not, one should 
become a recluse. When the state possesses the Way, it is 
shameful to be poor and without position. When it does 
not, it is shameful to be wealthy and high-ranking.”


Confucius sets exceptionally high standards here. Those standards are 
both developmental and etched into the relationship between character 
and the times in which one happens to live. Challenging times call, in 
Confucius’s view, for a profoundly different relationship to employment 
than times when the world is one with the Way.


In these three clustered passages, we see a relationship between learning 
and service that clearly does value the slow, day-by-day acquisition of 
knowledge. It is then placed against the potentially tumultuous times 
through which Confucius knew that future generations would live.
Progress and Regress


Another fascinating three-passage sequence appears in chapter 9. The first 
of these passages shows that Confucius was well aware of the inexorable 
surge of time.
9.17
The Master stood at the bank of a river. “Isn’t the flow of 
life like this river—churning continually, day and night?”


Time passes, never ceasing, and human beings have to find their place 
in its great river. Confucius realized this, in the end, when he returned to 
the state of Lu in 484 B.C.E. and gave his last efforts toward teaching. It 
seemed to be a last gasp attempt to make a mark in a minor area, but it 

74  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
is apparent that Confucius gave it what he had left. Yet the river rushed 
onward.


It is difficult to keep one’s focus on the river of time in the face of all the 
distractions in our lives. Confucius knew this well. In the following passage, 
he pinpoints a particular human frailty—often, if not always, a male one—
that perplexed him when he saw talent in wayward students.
9.18
The Master said, “I have not yet met a person more 
enraptured by the virtues of excellent conduct than [德] 
than by sensual beauty.”


Confucius’s doubts about both his students and the rulers of his age were 
dominated by what we might call “sexual distractions.” He despaired of 
finding a person more enraptured by the virtues of excellent conduct 
than by sensual beauty.


Now consider the last statement in this three-passage sequence from 
chapter 9. It states in succinct fashion the relationship between progress 
and regress and shows what Confucius thought we should be considering 
as we ponder our own futures.
9.19
The Master said, “Just as in the example of building up 
earth to make a small mountain, if I quit one basketful 
short of my goal, I have stopped. And just as in the 
example of filling a trench with dirt to level it with the 
surrounding ground, if—having thrown in only one 
basketful—I continue, then I am making progress.”

Lecture 10—Confucius on the Purpose of Learning  75


Most interpreters have interpreted this passage as reflecting Confucius’s 
attitude toward constant learning and improvement. Although there is 
potential ambiguity in the phrasing, one point is clear enough: Stopping 
short is not an option for Confucius. Always making progress is the goal. 
And in a larger sense, Confucius was only beginning to get started in 
teaching how to fit progress and regress into the larger picture of a life 
well lived.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Confucius speaks of putting things into practice. He states that no 
amount of study matters if a person can’t make it work in the world. 
What is the relationship between studying and making a difference in 
the world?
2.	 Confucius emphasizes the contrast between the exemplary person 
and the petty person. His petty person is a smart and very capable 
individual who has not internalized the principles in which Confucius 
believes. What is the difference between exemplary and petty as you 
think about historical and present-day society?
3.	 Confucius states, in disagreeing with a follower, that thinking three times 
before taking action is too much. When is thinking thrice a bit too 
much?

Lecture 11
Filial Devotion in the 
Analects
T
his lecture and the seven that follow will delve into particularly 
significant items in the Analects that came to form the foundation 
for all Confucian thought in Chinese history. In this lecture, you 
will learn about the concept of filial conduct, a key conceptual element in 
the Analects.
The Importance of Filial Conduct


No concept is more central to Confucian thought than the Chinese 
character xiao, which, depending on the circumstance, can be rendered as 
“filial conduct,” “filial devotion,” and even “filial obligation.”


The core message of Confucius’s teachings on how to behave in society is 
that devoted children or loyal followers labor on behalf of their seniors or 
superiors, but they also have a duty to correct them.


An important notion in the study of childhood development is the 
idea that solid foundations are required before more complex thinking 
is possible. Consider the following entry in the Analects with this 
developmental idea in mind.

Lecture 11—Filial Devotion in the Analects  77
1.2
Master You said, “Rare indeed is the person of filial and 
fraternal conduct who yet enjoys defying his superiors. And 
among those not inclined to defy authority, there has never 
been one who incited rebellion. Exemplary people focus 
upon the roots. Once the roots are established, the Way 
will grow and spread. As for filial and fraternal conduct, 
they are, I suspect, the root of all consummate conduct.”


If “filial and fraternal conduct” is the “root of all consummate conduct,” 
as this passage states, then it would appear that much more complex 
matters, such as benevolence, ritual propriety, and the higher virtues have 
their foundation in the conduct of family life.


The Chinese character for “filial conduct” (孝) is instructive. On top is a 
fragment from the original character for “old” or “venerable” (老). Filial 
conduct pairs that seniority in the family (and beyond) with another 
element meaning “child” (子). That simple combination, in turn, leads 
to the Chinese character for “teaching” or “education” (教). This is the 
powerful idea behind the developmental focus of filial conduct. It begins at 
home, is honed in social roles within the family, and is carried on, in a deep 
educational sense, into the larger world.


Confucius was once asked why he did not serve in government. This was 
more than occasionally a sore point with Confucius, who was frustrated 
by his failure to be recognized by rulers of his time. Early in the text of the 
Analects, however, he seems to reject the entire premise of the question 
centered on governmental employment.

78  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
2.21
Someone asked Confucius, “Why are you not engaged in 
official service?” The Master replied, “The Book of History 
states, ‘Filial conduct lies precisely in being filial! One need 
only be filial in conduct with parents and siblings to engage 
in official service.’ By exhibiting filial conduct in my life, I 
am engaged in official service. Why must I be ‘engaged in 
official service?’”


According to this line of Confucian thinking, filial conduct connects 
directly with official service. Indeed, the core connection between running 
a family and running larger social and political bodies has formed, over the 
centuries, a strong line of political philosophy spanning early mythology to 
politics today.
The Classic of Filial Conduct


The message of filial devotion is most prominent in a text that features 
Confucius and his follower Zengzi—a slender book often translated into 
English as the Classic of Filial Piety. Many modern scholars are inclined 
to avoid the word “piety,” however, because it has been so thoroughly 
influenced by Western religious thought that it frames the meaning of the 
Chinese character (xiao) far too narrowly. We will therefore refer to this 
influential book as the Classic of Filial Conduct.


Although it is a work created in the centuries after Confucius and Zengzi 
lived and taught, the Classic of Filial Conduct features these two prominent 
Confucians in its opening scenes, and their influence persists throughout 
its 18 brief chapters.


The Classic of Filial Conduct was traditionally one of the first texts that 
children memorized, soon after learning their first Chinese characters. 
Even today, it is an influential text in and beyond China. It is relatively 

Lecture 11—Filial Devotion in the Analects  79
simple and direct in language, but the Classic of Filial Conduct goes far 
beyond being a basic primer. The power of its themes fuel almost every 
lesson in Chinese government and politics.


Consider the following excerpt from the Classic of Filial Conduct. Never was 
the classroom dynamic more evident in Confucius’s lessons than it is here.
Confucius was at repose in his residence, and Master Zeng 
(Zengzi) attended him. The Master said, “The former 
kings had the greatest excellence and the integral Way. 
With these, they brought calm to all under heaven and 
harmony to the people—above and below were without 
resentment…
Zengzi rose from his mat and spoke, “Your follower is not 
nimble of mind, and my understanding is inadequate. Could 
you elaborate?” The Master replied, “As for filial conduct, it 
is the root of excellence and the place where all education 
begins. Take your place again, and I will clarify it for you.


“Have a seat, and I will explain things to you” is the message that Confucius 
sends to his student. What follows is an explication that begins with the 
root of filial conduct and extends to the whole world.
Your hair, your skin—your whole body—is acquired 
from your parents. You dare not do anything to harm it. 
Protect it—that is precisely where filial conduct begins. Set 
yourself aright, pursue the Way; advance your name for 
later ages, in order to honor your father and mother. These 
actions mark the completion of filial conduct. Therefore 
filial conduct begins with serving one’s parents and family; 

80  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
it reaches its middle in serving one’s ruler; it comes to 
completion in setting oneself aright in the world.


The principle of filial conduct thus covers the entire range of human 
interaction, from the most basic interactions within the family to making 
one’s way in the greater world.
The Confucian Symbolic Universe


Consider the world that emerges from the Analects and related texts, such 
as the Classic of Filial Conduct. We will refer to this world as the Confucian 
symbolic universe. This phrase conveys the complex intersection of family 
life, government, and even the work of the heavens in people’s lives. 


The Confucian symbolic universe amounts to more than a series of social 
and cosmic images. Family, society, government, and the cosmos were held 
together by a powerful moral bond—the bond of filial conduct. Filiality 
was the glue that held the cosmos and society together, from heaven 
down to the common people. It was a moral glue, linking people through 
a basic Chinese cultural ideal. It was an ideal that linked high and low, near 
and far; it was a bond that tied together the entire universe of human 
social relations.


As we have seen, filiality is a term that, in the strict sense, relates to the 
family. It is the most basic link between people, connecting parents and 
children and elder and younger siblings. Because of its interpretive power, 
however, filiality can be extended metaphorically to many bonds between 
people, institutions, and ideas, giving otherwise impersonal relationships a 
profoundly moral dimension.


The symbolism of social relationships in the Chinese classics is powerful 
precisely because it is founded on a solid relationship that was basic to 
Chinese society. The acts of venerating ancestors, ruling, tilling the earth, 
being a parent, a child, or both—all were placed in a moral framework. 
Thus, we have not merely filiality between a parent and a child, but filiality 

Lecture 11—Filial Devotion in the Analects  81
within a hierarchical symbolic 
system in which the glue that 
holds it all together is that very 
filial conduct—a system with 
moral dimensions that gives 
a son a reason for working his 
father’s fields and the subject a 
reason for obeying his sovereign.


The model for the harmonious 
government and cosmos was 
the 
harmonious 
family. The 
government was the family writ 
large—the young, loyal and 
obedient toward the old, worked 
to preserve the common good 
(rank and ancestral rites within 
the family, harmony between 
high and low in government).


In 
the 
Confucian 
symbolic 
universe, family and government 
are structured along similar 
lines. If a son proved to be capable within the family, his virtue could be 
transferred to government. Loyal to his sovereign, respectful of his father, 
deferential to his elder brothers, the filial son cultivated a proper decorum 
which served him well in his interactions within the Confucian symbolic 
universe.


The family, with its myriad social relationships, was the model of the larger 
Chinese society and its governmental relationships of sovereign to subject, 
minister to minister, and so forth. Just as the father of the family served 
as the sovereign within his domain, the emperor acted as a father to the 
government, while simultaneously linking it to the cosmic realm as the Son 
of Heaven.

82  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


These relationships, when combined, form a cultural theory of social 
order with the metaphysical underpinnings of a worldview. Everyone—
even the Son of Heaven—owed respect to a higher authority. All people 
had others for whom they were responsible. Even relationships between 
relative equals were reconceived as hierarchical (elder and younger 
brothers, for example).


Starting from the realities of the social world, filiality is a practical and 
symbolic way of dealing with these realities and creating an orderly society. 
Government models the family, family models the government—and both 
model the Way of Heaven.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The Analects has a kind of developmental rhetoric that articulates how 
understanding certain concepts and developing skills build upon each 
other. In what other areas of life and learning is it necessary to grasp 
one skill before managing another?
2.	 In the Analects, Confucius often focuses upon the details of filial 
conduct. Think about deferential conduct in your own life. How much 
do the details of comportment matter in a social interaction?

Lecture 12
Confucius on the Value of 
Remonstrance
I
n Confucius’s Analects, the concept of remonstrance, or filial critique, 
exists as a built-in check for out-of-control authority. A bookend to 
the principle of filial devotion, remonstrance is intended to provide 
a necessary corrective—to stop the father from imperiling the family, for 
example, or the ruler from causing the ruin of the state. In this lecture, 
you will examine the nature of filial critique in China’s hierarchical and 
network-driven society. You will also learn about the ways in which 
remonstrance appears and is more than occasionally crushed, even in a 
social and political system modeled on the teachings of the Analects.
Understanding Remonstrance


Remonstrance (諫) is an important part of Chinese history, philosophy, 
and literature, and the concept lies at the very heart of Chinese social and 
political life.


At its most basic, remonstrance is the duty of a child to correct the 
actions of an adult. Breaking the basic role of devoted child, that same 
child is obligated to teach straying adults something that they should 
already know. At its most dramatic, remonstrance is accompanied by 
images of fearless officials (sometimes dragging their coffins behind them 
in anticipation of their punishments) on their way to rebuke authorities 
who are set on paths to destruction.

The concept of remonstrance is versatile, slippery, and enduring—albeit 
on a small scale and what might be called a minor chord. Consider the 
Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary’s definition.
remonstrance

grievance; especially: a document formally stating such 
points
2: an act or instance of remonstrating


Culture has a great deal to do with the way we view the word 
“remonstrance.” In English, we tend to look at it along the lines of 
“admonition” or “reproof.” But in East Asia, “remonstrance” has a distinctly 
hierarchical component. Partly because of its critical quality—of the kind 
that can harm friendships and make states totter—the cultural details 
matter a great deal.


An early passage in the Analects speaks to the fine line at work for dutiful 
children who sense that their parents are following the wrong path. In 
this passage, we see the extraordinary care that Confucius exhibited with 
regard to the duty of remonstrance.
4.18
In serving your father and mother, remonstrate with 
them, taking care to be gentle in the process. If, upon 
seeing that they wish not to follow your advice, continue 
to be respectful and do not contravene them. Do not be 
resentful, even if your frustration is difficult to bear.

Lecture 12—Confucius on the Value of Remonstrance  85


“Do not be resentful” seems to imply that the remonstrance is over. 
This may not be Confucius’s point, however. Well-stated but demure 
remonstrance has a kind of persistence that, over time, changes families, 
communities, and the state.
Remonstrance in the Classic of Filial Conduct


The Classic of Filial Conduct (which Confucius is said to have compiled and 
edited) connects the concepts of filial conduct and remonstrance. The 
text gives an intriguing glimpse at what Confucius meant by the governing 
power of remonstrance.


The structure of the Classic of Filial Conduct is remarkable. It lays out a 
vision of hierarchy as a natural process in the world, and it describes how 
filial conduct serves to give everyone important roles in society, no matter 
how large or small. After an introductory section, with Confucius playing 
a role every bit as central to the text as he does in the Analects, the 
Classic of Filial Conduct describes what filial conduct looks like from the 
perspective of every major group in Confucius’s society.


Section 2 describes the filial conduct of the Son of Heaven, or emperor. 
Quoting another classic text, the Book of Documents, Confucius notes that 
“When this one person, the ruler, behaves well in serving his parents, the 
entire population will look up to his example.” For Confucius, the key to 
being in charge lies in serving one’s parents and setting an example for 
others to do so.


From the ruler, the Classic of Filial Conduct proceeds toward the actions of 
hereditary lords, the ministers and high officials, on to the lower officials, 
and down to the common people, who themselves play a role in a 
harmonious society. In the excerpt that follows, Confucius describes the 
filial conduct of the common people and how society fits together with it.
Making use of the cycles of nature, making the most of 
the earth’s potential, being judicious in their actions, and 

86  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
prudent in what they use—through all of these practices, 
the common people care for their parents. This, then, is 
the filial conduct of the common people. So it is that, from 
the Son of Heaven on down to the common people, filial 
conduct is without end or beginning, and no person should 
fear being unequal to its challenges.


While Confucius states the best case for harmonious social living through 
filial conduct, he did not forget that remonstrance is the key to correcting 
the small (and sometimes large) errors and imperfections that crop up 
when people live together.


Section 15 of the Classic of Filial Conduct (“On Remonstrance”) also packs 
some drama in its message. It begins with Confucius’s follower Zengzi 
saying that he has learned deeply from the master on the subjects of 
parental love, reverence, respect, and maintaining the good name of the 
family. Then Zengzi asks the following question: “I wish to ask whether 
children can be considered filial simply by complying with everything their 
father demands.” Confucius is so exercised by Zengzi’s simple question 
that he repeats himself with a kind of exasperated sputter.
The Master said, “What could you possibly be saying? What 
could you possibly be saying? In times before our era, if 
the Son of Heaven had just seven remonstrating ministers 
of government, although he lacked the Way, he would not 
lose all under heaven.”


From there, Confucius digs into the picture of a full, flowing, remonstrating 
society—one that is held together by the very act of criticizing authority 
for the good of everyone.

Lecture 12—Confucius on the Value of Remonstrance  87
If leading members of the nobility had just five 
remonstrating ministers, although they lacked the Way, 
they would not lose their states. If high-ranking officials 
had even three remonstrating ministers, even though 
they lacked the way, they would not lose their extended 
families. If mere scholar-officials had but one remonstrating 
friend, they would not lose the regard of their peers. And if 
a father had a remonstrating son, even though he lacked the 
Way, he would not be mired in questionable conduct.


A society that is held together by the social glue of reverence and 
obedience to parents and leaders requires a system check. For Confucius, 
there is no possibility of a society—even a family—on autopilot. Course 
correction is a constant concern, and there can be no let up. People in 
authority need to learn to be attentive to these criticisms, to be sure. 
Nonetheless, Confucius puts the responsibility squarely on the child, the 
government official, or anyone who knows that the first responsibility 
is reverence and obedience, but such loyalty is tied at all times to the 
responsibility to criticize.


Confucius concludes with a flourish.
Hence, when the person who is senior engages in 
questionable conduct, a son cannot but remonstrate with 
the father, and a minister cannot but remonstrate with the 
ruler. When there is questionable conduct, there must be 
remonstrance. Following the father’s wishes?—How could 
that possibly be considered filial conduct?

88  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Remonstrating with people in authority is filial; it is obedience and loyalty 
for Confucius. There is no loyalty without correction.
Remonstrance in the Analects


Remonstrance can be dangerous for individual critics, their peers, and even 
their families. During several periods of Chinese history, it was so dangerous 
that criticism led to certain death. In the Analects, Confucius is so sensitive 
to this concern that he sometimes seems to bury its potential in layer upon 
layer of meticulous couching of his rhetoric, personal demeanor, and action.


In a passage three-quarters of the way through the text, Confucius warns 
that remonstrating children or officials must be aware of their own biases 
and must think carefully about whether or not they are offering critique 
for the greater good, not their own personal interests. It is necessary to 
exercise a kind of inner-reflexivity in the act of remonstrance that we see 
nowhere in the act of filial devotion.
14.22
Zilu asked about serving one’s ruler. The Master replied, 
“Never deceive. Be completely upfront when admonishing 
the ruler.”


After hearing Confucius’s admonition in Analects 14.22, all but the fiercest 
of critics might well be persuaded that it is better just to stand aside and 
let events take their course. This approach is entirely incorrect. In fact, for 
Confucius, it rises to a kind of moral wrong. In Analects 15.8, Confucius 
exhorts the reader to be vigilant and to critique authority when it is 
necessary.

Lecture 12—Confucius on the Value of Remonstrance  89
15.8
The Master said, “Not speaking with people who truly can 
benefit from your words is to let those people go to waste. 
Those who are wise never let people go to waste, and yet 
neither do they squander their words.”


In other words, we are to pour ourselves into correcting the person 
who will listen and attempt to understand, but we are not to waste our 
energy on the person who is so dense as not to hear what we say. This 
is an enormous task. It is easy to see how difficult it could be, even in the 
somewhat idealistic pages of the Analects, much less the hurly-burly of 
political life in an ever-changing China. Minding your own business is not 
an option in the world of Confucius’s Analects.


If we read the Analects carefully, we will see that only the superior person 
is capable of correction. In fact, only the superior person is truly capable 
of filial conduct, even though the “easier” forms of devotion can proceed 
mechanically for many members of society. At its highest levels, filial conduct 
and correction are of a piece—and they are performed in the deepest sense 
of human beings fully attuned to their surroundings, soaking in all of the 
nuances of their situations. They carry out their devotions (and corrections) 
assiduously, and with a deft stroke that no mere technician ever could.


The most explicit statement of all concerning remonstrance comes very late 
in the Analects. In this passage, Confucius examines whether it is possible to 
work side-by-side with the petty person in the service of the ruler.
17.15
The Master said, “Can it be possible to work together with 
petty colleagues while serving one’s ruler? Before receiving 
an official position, all petty people worry about is that 
they might not be appointed. Once appointed, they are 

90  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
apprehensive about losing their positions. And amidst all of 
that anxiety, they will stop at nothing to hold on.”


The key to filial conduct and remonstrance emanates from these points. 
One must focus entirely on the good of the organization, whether that is 
the family or state. Focusing entirely on oneself, as a petty person would, 
goes against both the ideal of filial conduct and the duty of remonstrance. 
Only by thinking about the larger context of social and moral networks 
can real progress be made.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The Analects emphasizes a duty for children (and junior members of a 
hierarchy) to correct parents and superiors. In what other parts of life 
do societies emphasize the necessity of correction?
2.	 Confucius emphasizes that correction of parents must be gentle—there 
are limits. Why do you think that he combines a duty to correct while 
urging that correction to be gentle?

uilding upon the foundation of filial devotion and the duty of 
remonstrance, a series of key concepts in the Analects cluster 
together to round out the whole person. These additional concepts 
unify the foundation and foster in serious learners the skills that will result, 
with careful study and practice, in the highest level of Confucian practice. 
In this lecture, you will examine several concepts that help complete the 
individual—one who is capable of truly becoming an exemplary person.
Loyalty


The concept of “loyalty,” or “exerting all of one’s effort,” (忠 zhong) is 
a complex amalgamation of devotion to authority and steering that 
authority toward proper conduct without fail. There is nothing simple 
(or order-following) about it. For that reason, the English word “loyalty” 
is problematic. It is not the best translation into English of what really is 
going on in the text of the Analects.


The Chinese character itself is composed of two elements—”middle, 
center” (中) above and “heart-mind” below (心). This character, which 
Westerners have translated as “loyalty,” is closer to something like “piercing 
the center of emotion and thought” (忠). It can also be translated as 
“exerting all of one’s effort.” This concept represents a powerful form of 
loyalty to the teachings that every serious Confucian learner shared.

92  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


In chapter 4 of the Analects, Confucius makes a remarkable statement. It 
is even more surprising because it is embedded in the middle of the text. 
He tells Zengzi, his devoted follower, that a single idea connects all of his 
teaching.
4.15
The Master said, “Zeng! My Way (道) is held together by a 
single strand.” Master Zeng replied, “Yes, certainly.” When 
the Master had departed, the followers asked, “What did 
he mean?” Master Zeng said, “The Master’s Way lies in 
exerting all of one’s effort (忠) and relating to the needs of 
others (恕). That is all.”


In this passage, “exerting all of one’s effort” is tied to another powerful 
concept—reciprocity, or relating to the needs of others. It is in statements 
such as this that we can begin to see the evocative power of Confucius’s 
teachings. Far from blind devotion to authority, the concept of exerting all 
of one’s effort is further tied to sensing the needs of others. 
Sincerity and Trust


The specific Chinese character for “sincerity” (誠 cheng) is rarely 
mentioned in the Analects, but it bubbles beneath the surface and would, 
in time, explode into prominence generations after the Analects became 
cemented in Chinese education and political life. 


“Trust,” or “standing by one’s words,” (信 xin) is an allied concept that 
expects proper conduct from others, even as you seek to do right by 
them. Few concepts in Confucius’s Analects carry more weight.


The concept of xin is all about interactions with others. The personal 
dimension remains significant, to be sure; without the moral bearing of 
the inner person, there can be no trust, no being true to one’s word. Yet 

Lecture 13—The Exemplary Person in the Analects  93
trust manifests itself in profoundly varying ways that go so far beyond the 
individual that it threatens to break the bonds tying it to a limited vision of 
the phrase “trust me.”


Consider the following passage from the Analects, in which Confucius 
implores his student Zizhang to be true to his word for the good of the 
greater community.
15.6
Zizhang asked about making one’s way in the world. The 
Master replied, “If your words reflect your devotion and you 
stand by those words—and if you are diligent and respectful 
as you proceed—then even though you might live in the 
faraway states of Man or Mo, your behavior will be proper. 
If, by contrast, your words do not reflect your devotion and 
you are not true to those words—and you are not diligent 
or respectful as you proceed—then even in your own home 
area, how can you proceed? When you take your position, 
keep these ideas right in front of you; when riding in your 
carriage, see them right before you. Then, and only then, 
will you make your way properly in the world.” Zizhang 
wrote this phrase on his sash as a reminder.


Note that “being true to one’s word” is linked closely to “exerting all of 
one’s effort,” which is a far cry from the traditional translation for zhong, 
“loyalty.” Throughout the Analects, these two concepts are tied closely 
together. Exerting all of one’s effort and being true to one’s word are 
both intimately linked in a kind of relational ethics that makes the entire 
social fabric stronger. For Confucius, there is never an “I” or “me” without 
an “us.”

94  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Virtue


“Virtue,” or “excellence,” (德 de) is a social concept, not merely one of 
individual character. As Confucius states in the Analects, “Virtue is never 
alone; it always has neighbors.”


The English word “virtue” is a pretty good translation of de, and it is 
one that helps us on our path toward rounding out the full person in 
Confucian thought. But “virtue” is too closely mired in an individualistic 
worldview that fails to comprehend the profound social dynamics 
of Confucius’s teachings in the Analects. A better translation for de is 
“excellence.”


Consider the following passage, in which Confucius is asked about 
the opposite of virtue or excellence: shameful conduct (恥 chi). The 
passage includes the concept of the Way, which, as we have seen, is an 
ancient Chinese notion that Confucius wove into his own teachings.
14.1
Yuan Si asked about shameful conduct. The Master replied, 
“When the state possesses the Way, to receive an official 
salary is expected. Yet to receive a salary when the state 
has lost the Way—that is shameful.” Yuan Si inquired 
further, “If people refrain from attacking others—as well as 
from boastfulness, rancor, and covetousness—can they be 
considered to be consummate people?” The Master replied, 
“It is possible, but it would be difficult. Even so, I do not 
know if it rises to the level of ‘consummate conduct’.”


Knowing when and how to engage and to disengage lies at the heart 
of excellence in conduct. When the Way prevails, people of excellence 
need to serve. Confucius strikes this theme even more powerfully in 
chapter 8. 

Lecture 13—The Exemplary Person in the Analects  95
8.13
The Master said, “Be deeply committed to love of learning 
and maintain, even unto death, the sterling Way (善道). 
A state in turmoil should not be entered, and an agitated 
realm is no place to reside. When a state possesses the Way, 
it is right to be celebrated, but when it does not one should 
become a recluse. When the state possesses the Way, it is 
shameful to be poor and without position. When it does 
not, it is shameful to be wealthy and high-ranking.”


It would be a mistake to read Confucius’s statement as one of 
pusillanimous concern for safety. His point is easy to miss for a modern 
reader. It would seem that Confucius takes poor government as a reality, 
and he cautions the person who loves learning and serves with diligence 
to persevere. That same person should not sell his integrity, however. 
Knowing when to serve and when to retire gracefully is one of the most 
important skills of all in a dangerous political universe.


Both excellence and virtue are profoundly social. Neither ever stand 
alone, even though one might cultivate one’s skills in relative isolation and 
develop an inner core of strength. To make a difference in the world, one 
must work with others.

Fostering excellence among his peers and followers was not easy for 
Confucius, and he more than occasionally voiced his frustration. Some of 
the best known entries in the Analects show an exasperated Confucius 
chiding humanity for its inability to reach for excellence.

96  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
5.27
The Master said, “I am exasperated! I have not yet met the 
person who, when faced with his own errors, takes himself 
to task and looks deeply at his own conduct.”
6.29
The Master said, “Proceeding through life and society by 
exhibiting balance and proportion in all matters—is this not 
the way to true excellence? It has been a long time since 
such conduct was common among the people.”


Part of Confucius’s teaching strategy was to describe key concepts and 
skills in terms of their opposites. This power of negative example has a 
long tradition in Chinese history, and Confucius was a master of it. Some 
of the most memorable examples in all of education are those entries in 
the Analects that tell us how badly things might go astray. In the following 
passage, Confucius warns that virtue and excellence can be undermined.
15.27
The Master said, “Glib words impair the virtues of excellent 
conduct (德). If people are incapable of handling small 
matters, grand plans will come to ruin.”


There is a two-pronged attack at work here. Glib words soak in and 
create fissures, like frozen water in a tiny sidewalk crack. They are one 
of the sources of discord. But the second issue makes for an odd pairing: 
Don’t be incapable of handling small matters, either. It’s almost as though 
the message is “think big, but soak in the details, too.” If you know anything 
about the way the best diplomats are trained all over the world, it sounds 

Lecture 13—The Exemplary Person in the Analects  97
very much like Confucius’s advice—grand plans and small matters, all at 
the same time.
Empathy


For Confucius, the core concepts of the Analects fit together to round out 
the whole person. This is always a matter of combining focus on individual 
capability and action in the world. Rounding out the whole person begins 
with filial conduct and the obligation to critique those in authority. It is 
completed by mastering the core actions of exerting all of one’s effort, 
being true to one’s word, and cultivating excellence.


Let’s take another look at a passage we explored at the beginning of this 
lecture.
4.15
Master Zeng said, “The Master’s Way lies in exerting all of 
one’s effort (忠) and relating to the needs of others (恕). 
That is all.”


What is “relating to the needs of others” (恕 shu), and why does it figure 
so powerfully in Confucius’s vision? The English word “empathy” is a 
relatively close fit with the Chinese term, but think of it as less about the 
character of the individual feeling it than the entire social network creating 
mirrored patterns of empathy among a large group of people. Relating to 
the needs of others is a profoundly social matter. 


Empathy is driven by changing situations. If social and political life were 
unchanging, we could probably just memorize a list of rules. Yet we all 
know that life is much more complicated than that. Comprehending the 
particular situations people face requires an ability to empathize with the 
details of other people’s challenges. 

98  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
5.23
The Master said, “Bo Yi and Shu Qi did not harbor old 
resentments. Because of this, they did not stir the anger of 
others.”
15.24
Zigong asked, “Is there an idea that can be put into practice 
throughout one’s life—to the end of one’s days?” The Master 
replied, “There is relating to the needs of others (恕)—do 
not demand of others anything that you are not prepared to 
accept.”


These passages give an indication of the range of possibilities when 
empathy or reciprocity shape the whole person—and society. Sensing 
deeply the challenges—and even the joys—of others frames Confucian 
ethical teachings in profound ways, and it reminds us that all ethical 
behavior is ultimately about connecting individuals with the rest of 
society.


Empathy helps tie together the concepts we have studied—doing one’s 
utmost, standing by one’s word, and virtue, or excellence. In powerful 
ways, they are individual skills that need to be honed one by one. For 
the whole person to come to fruition as a social and even political being, 
however, they all must come together. Once they do, one can focus 
one’s efforts on attaining that highest of Confucian skills, consummate 
conduct.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Many terms in the Analects are difficult to translate clearly into English. 
The challenge is not just limited to Chinese. Think about words in 
English that are challenging to explain to others. Regional usages are 
among the most fascinating of these.
2.	 One of the challenges of reading the Analects is the way that terms 
have changed over time (in China and beyond). Think of words that 
have changed in the course of your own lifetime.
3.	 Virtue doesn’t stand alone in Confucius’s estimation. Think about ways 
in which conduct (good and bad) spreads beyond an individual to affect 
others.

Lecture 14
Confucius’s Ideal: 
Consummate Conduct
I
n this lecture, you will begin to examine the complex but vitally 
important subject of consummate conduct, the most difficult and 
important of all of Confucius’s concepts. Indeed, it is the most difficult 
of all concepts in Chinese philosophy. The topic of consummate conduct 
has dominated learned commentaries for 25 centuries in China and for 
as long as there has been a Confucian tradition in Japan and Korea. It is 
a concept that reveals the true depth of Confucius’s teachings and firmly 
negates the claims of his critics.
The Basics of Consummate Conduct


The character that represents “consummate conduct,” ren (仁), is 
a vertical line just to the left of two short horizontal ones. It has the 
appearance a person standing next to the number two. It’s pronounced 
in exactly the same way as the character for “person,” but the character 
for consummate conduct has an intriguing extra dimension that suggests 
surrounding humanity. In fact, human relations are what consummate 
conduct is all about.


“A person standing next to the number two” is actually not very far 
away from the original etymological entries for the term in early Chinese 
encyclopedias. To reinforce this idea, think about the concepts that we 
have studied up until now. Personal conduct is tied to social action in the 
world. There is no room in Confucius’s teaching for lone wolves who just 
do their own things.

Lecture 14—Confucius’s Ideal: Consummate Conduct  101


Many Western writers have translated this important character as 
“benevolence.” Others have rendered it “humanity,” and one mid-20th 
century scholar called it “man being at his best.” Roger Ames and Henry 
Rosemont translated it as “authoritative conduct” in their 1997 translation 
of the Analects. A decade later, Roger Ames revised his translation to the 
“consummate person” or that person’s “consummate conduct.”


No concept in Confucius’s text is spoken of so frequently, and with so 
much depth, as consummate conduct. What follows is the first passage in 
which it appears in the Analects. Note the way that many of the concepts 
we have studied appear in this passage, as though building toward 
consummate conduct.
1.6
The Master said, “As a younger sibling, be filial when at 
home and, when outside the home, defer to elders. Be 
cautious with language and keep your word. Show care for 
the multitude of people, but exhibit particular affection 
for those who are consummate in the way they conduct 
themselves. If any strength is left, engage in study to make 
yourself even better.”


Filial conduct and attention to deference (an aspect of filiality) build 
toward making good on one’s word. From there, Confucius’s idea 
spreads outward to the larger society. His final comment is just the kind 
of teacherly-ironic observation that can make a classroom great—if you 
have any energy left, devote yourself to further study.


For Confucius, consummate conduct is deeply entwined with practical 
situations that face us every day. Consummate conduct is something 
we do, not an abstract principle meant only for discussion among a few 
intellectuals.

102  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


One of Confucius’s most generalizable statements about consummate 
conduct is also one of the most specific. In this passage, we see that 
consummate conduct is situational. Circumstances matter.
4.5
The Master said, “Wealth and the recognition of others—
these are what people desire. But if they are attained 
by diversions from the Way, they are not worth having. 
Penury and low position are what people disdain, but if 
they are a result of maintaining the Way, they should not 
be shunned. How could an exemplary person who deserts 
consummate conduct be worthy of the name? Exemplary 
people do not abandon consummate conduct for even the 
time it takes to eat a single meal. When distressed they 
move toward it; when anxious they move toward it.”


Not for the space of a single meal does the consummate person avoid 
the highest forms of conduct. In good times and in bad, it is always there. 
The concept is about acting in the world; it is deeply situational. Personal 
integrity is central (Confucius was fond of noting this), but that integrity 
always merges with specific situations.


Consider the idea of practical mastery, a concept explored by the 
anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu. Practical mastery is a mastery of situations, 
which can be as simple as shaking hands (or bowing) as one meets an 
acquaintance on the street to planning an elaborate celebration for 
family and community. Bourdieu’s practical mastery is akin to Confucius’s 
consummate conduct, but for one dimension, which we must not ignore: 
Confucius’s points about consummate conduct are distinctly moral. 


Knowing just how to act in complex situations is a central element in 
Confucius’s teachings. But it must be tied to a kind of shared (and 

Lecture 14—Confucius’s Ideal: Consummate Conduct  103
profoundly social) integrity that every proper Chinese schoolchild has 
been learning almost since birth.


Confucius’s interaction with his best student, Yan Hui, gives us a clearer 
picture of what Confucius meant by consummate conduct.
12.1
Yan Hui asked about consummate conduct (仁). The 
Master replied, “By channeling one’s energies and 
focusing upon ritual practice—that is how people become 
consummate in their conduct. Even if for only one day they 
channeled their energy and focused upon ritual practice, 
everyone and everything would come to be influenced by 
such consummate conduct. Becoming consummate in one’s 
conduct comes from deep within a person; how could it 
come from the outside?”
Yan Hui said, “Could you elaborate upon the details?” The 
Master replied, “Do not observe beyond the parameters of 
proper ritual conduct. Do not listen beyond the parameters 
of proper ritual conduct. Do not speak beyond the 
parameters of proper ritual conduct. In short, do nothing 
that contravenes proper ritual conduct.” Yan Hui replied, 
“Although I am not terribly perceptive, I shall earnestly put 
into practice what you have stated here.”


The whole empire would bend if one were able, for the space of a single 
day, to follow through with the kind of consummate drive that would 
move social and political mountains. But mastery is required. 

104  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
The Implications of Consummate Conduct


Late in the Analects, Confucius’s occasionally prickly student, Zigong, asked 
the master about the practice of consummate conduct. Confucius made 
clear that a craftsman must sharpen his tools, and that he must master his 
craft. This included making the right kind of friends and a particular kind 
of learning.
15.10
Zigong inquired about consummate conduct (仁). The 
Master replied, “Artisans wishing to polish their skills must 
first sharpen their tools. While living in any given state, 
serve the ministers of most worthy character (賢) and 
befriend those scholar-officials who are most consummate 
in their conduct.”


Sharpen your tools. It is not much of a stretch for us, 25 centuries later, to 
interpret this as a honing of one’s skills. Confucius seems to be saying here 
that honing one’s skills requires choosing the right people to be around—
that we should find the “right” employers and make friends with people 
who will make us better.


To develop consummate conduct, it is necessary first to develop the core 
skills that come before this higher-level one (filial conduct, remonstrance, 
exerting all of one’s effort, being true to one’s word, excellence, and 
relating to the needs of others). After that, the only way to keep improving 
is to study and learn from others.


Immediately preceding Confucius’s statement about broadening one’s 
friendships is a broad and encompassing statement that seems to bury 
the one that comes after. What’s important to grasp is that consummate 
conduct isn’t just a lifestyle choice for Confucius. It’s life or death.

Lecture 14—Confucius’s Ideal: Consummate Conduct  105
15.9
The Master said, “As for steadfast scholar-officials and 
people of consummate conduct, they would never 
jeopardize their consummate conduct, even in order to save 
their lives. Indeed, they might rather sacrifice their lives in 
order to attain it.”
Defining Consummate Conduct


Nowhere in the Analects is consummate conduct defined. For the reader 
with experience in Western philosophy, the lack of definition is nothing 
short of exasperating. 


The most famous definition of consummate conduct was proposed in 
the 11th century C.E., 16 centuries after Confucius lived, by one of the 
great minds of Confucianism. The scholar Cheng Hao boiled consummate 
conduct down to four Chinese characters:
仁者天也
“Consummate conduct; it is heaven.”


If this definition is puzzling to you, join the crowd. It takes a lifetime to 
gain mastery of the nuances of what Confucius means by consummate 
conduct. And for the dearth of definitions in the text, there is no shortage 
of grand statements.


There is little doubt that Confucius felt that consummate conduct was the 
center of all Confucian teachings. Consider another sequence of entries 
later in chapter 15.

106  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
15.35
The Master said, “Consummate conduct is more crucial 
for the common people than even the fire and water 
they use every day. People have been known to die when 
encountering fire and water, yet no one has ever died when 
encountering consummate conduct.”


In this puzzling entry (which has been interpreted in diverse ways over 
the years), Confucius speaks to the implications of consummate conduct 
for the people themselves. He is still speaking to the learner who is 
likely to serve as an aide to a ruler (or the ruler himself). Like the idea 
he expresses of excellence, Confucius seems to feel that consummate 
conduct will radiate outward to affect everyone in the larger society.


Consummate conduct is so important that even a particular kind of 
remonstrance might be required to achieve it.
15.36
The Master said, “In always conducting oneself 
consummately (仁), do not give way—even to your 
teacher.”


Do not give way if somehow even your teacher diverts you from 
consummate conduct, Confucius says. But there is much more to learn 
about this complex concept.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Practical mastery of situations is one of the skills that Confucian 
education emphasizes. Think of ways in which you or others have 
exhibited practical mastery in social situations.
2.	 Cultivation and maintenance of skills is a central theme in the Analects. 
How do you keep getting better at skills in your own life?
3.	 Can society be transformed by an individual’s character? Confucius 
clearly thinks so. In what ways can you see evidence for (and against) 
this characterization?

Lecture 15
Confucius on Cultivating 
the Social Self
C
onsummate conduct is one of the central concepts in Confucius’s 
Analects, and it is never far from Confucius’s thoughts or those of 
his followers. A closer look at this important concept will reveal 
that consummate conduct is made up of a wide variety of smaller social 
and moral skills. Putting them all together and keeping them attuned 
requires a kind of social and moral virtuosity that few people can attain. 
To Confucius’s mind, however, serious people should always be working 
toward this distant goal.
Components of Consummate Conduct


The closest thing in the Analects to the all-important Confucian concept 
of consummate conduct appears in just one entry in the text. It occurs 
toward the very end of the work, and that is likely because Confucius 
and his followers never seemed to think of it as a definition. Rather, this 
passage was another way of explaining a challenging idea with an example. 
17.6
Zizhang asked Confucius about consummate conduct. 
Confucius said, “People who can put into practice five 
things in the broader world can be considered to be 
consummate in their conduct.” “What are these five 
things?” asked Zizhang. Confucius replied, “Respectfulness, 

Lecture 15—Confucius on Cultivating the Social Self  109
magnanimity, being true to one’s word, a nimble mind, 
and generosity.” If people are respectful, they will avoid 
humiliation. If people are magnanimous, they will influence 
others. If people stand by their words, others will come 
to rely on them. If people are nimble of mind, they gain 
success. And if people are generous, they will have the 
ability to make full use of other’s talents.”


Confucius is stating that all of the skills required to round out the 
whole person are required to create a truly consummate person. It is 
a developmental process that requires filial conduct and remonstrance. 
From there, it builds toward exerting all of one’s effort, being true to one’s 
word, and exhibiting excellence in conduct. In this passage, we see that 
these skills might well build toward an even higher level that encompasses 
all of the other skills—consummate conduct.
Maintenance and Repair


Confucius and his followers understood the need for maintenance of the 
skills that make up consummate conduct. In fact, they had several words 
for this process: maintenance, repair, self-cultivation, reflection, study. 
All are geared toward leading the serious person toward consummate 
conduct.


Consider one of the first passages in the Analects, taking note of the way 
that the personal skills discussed previously come together in daily reflection.
1.4
Master Zeng said, “I examine my person and conduct every 
day in three ways. First, in my interactions with others, have 
I done all that I can? Second, when dealing with friends 

110  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
and peers, have I managed to keep my word? Finally, have I 
reviewed and acted upon what I have learned?”


Daily reflection is the heart of personal maintenance and the beginning of 
any serious attempt to improve as a person. Zengzi assessed his conduct, 
reflected upon it, and made plans to hone his actions the next day. In 
another passage, Zilu, Confucius’s headstrong follower, seems to bait 
Confucius on this subject.
14.42
Zilu asked about exemplary people. The Master replied, 
“They cultivate themselves by channeling their respectful 
behavior.” “Is that all?” Zilu asked. “They cultivate 
themselves by bringing calm to their colleagues,” answered 
Confucius. “And is that all?” continued Zilu. Confucius 
concluded, “They cultivate themselves by bringing calm to 
the people—even a sage king such as Yao or Shun would be 
challenged in that regard.”


In this passage, we see the deeply social message conveyed in the Analects. 
While cultivation is focused on personal growth, much more is required. 
People who cultivate their skills ultimately help to create a society in 
which people interact harmoniously. It is about both the part and the 
whole—the individual and society—all at the same time.
Study and Reflection


Late in the text of the Analects, Confucius states that just a few more 
years of life and study would bring him to a new level. Even near the end 
of his life, he still perceived himself as an unfinished project. But he seems 
confident that further study would be the solution.

Lecture 15—Confucius on Cultivating the Social Self  111
7.17
If several years were to be added to my lifespan, I will have 
spent fifty years of study in all. And if that happened, I 
might then be free of serious errors.


Confucius states that he comes up short, but it is not difficult to see a 
message of constant and never-ending assessment and improvement at 
work for him in this passage.


Learning from others lies at the heart of ongoing education. In one of 
the most famous passages in the Analects, Confucius states that one can 
always learn when walking with others.
7.22
The Master said, “Even when walking in a group of three 
companions, I will surely find instruction. I select what is 
positive from them and pursue it. I reflect upon what is 
negative—inwardly correcting similar negative qualities I 
might have.”


We can learn from positive behavior, and we can learn from negative 
behavior. The deep learner is always learning, always acting, and always 
learning some more.


In a peculiar passage at the end of chapter 17, Confucius discusses what 
happens when learning from the words of others, intense personal reflection, 
and exerting oneself to put it all into practice doesn’t seem to work.

112  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
17.26
The Master said, “For the person who reaches forty years of 
age and still bears the enmity of his peers—it will remain 
that way to the end of his days.”


Confucius strikes a disturbingly bleak note here. Confucius expects, it 
seems, that people who are on track with personal and social development 
will have achieved at least a toehold in society by the age of 40.


In the following passage, Confucius makes one of his broadest statements 
about how the developmental process should work.
2.4
The Master said, “By the age of fifteen, I had set my 
heart-and-mind upon study and learning. At thirty, I 
took my place in the larger society. By the age of forty, I 
was no longer overcome by doubt. At fifty, I had come 
to understand the way of heaven. By sixty, my ear was 
attuned, and from the age of seventy, I could give my heart-
and-mind full rein without going astray.”


Confucius explicitly describes a detailed progression. At 15, his heart-and-
mind was set upon study. From here we begin to see the profoundly 
developmental teachings of the Analects unfold.


Confucius knew that making oneself better at handling the demands 
of a complex society with aplomb required a balance of learning and 
reflection. Without that balance, trouble ensues.

Lecture 15—Confucius on Cultivating the Social Self  113
2.15
The Master said, “Studying without reflecting leads to 
deception; reflecting without studying leads to peril.”
Consummate Conduct and the Exemplary Person


Being true to one’s words is not the end of the story for Confucius when 
he assesses a person’s conduct.
11.21
The Master said, “If people are serious and ardent in their 
social interactions, a question still remains—are they 
exemplary people (君子) or just putting on appearances?” 


Confucius introduces here the idea that a person can be insincere—only 
appearing to act with integrity. In other passages, he makes clear that such 
insincerity is one of the great problems of leadership in his era, and that 
constant vigilance is required to exercise and interpret truly consummate 
conduct. 


Confucius also warns about the dangers of petty conduct. In the following 
passage, he links this danger explicitly to the underside of holding office.
6.13
The Master said to Zixia, “You surely wish to become the 
kind of scholar and official who stands out as an exemplary 
person—not the kind that is a petty person.”

114  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Don’t be a petty official, Confucius says; be better than that. The contrast 
between exemplary and petty is so stark in the Analects that it seems to 
set out a rudimentary curriculum for consummate conduct. 


One of Confucius’s most sweeping comments about consummate 
conduct states that exemplary people learn broadly of culture, discipline 
this learning through ritual propriety, and do not stray from that course.
6.27
The Master said, “Exemplary people learn broadly in 
cultural matters. Moreover, they discipline themselves 
by observing standards of ritual conduct. By doing these 
things, they proceed without swerving off-course.”


Remaining on course is key, according to Confucius; the petty person 
seems to be incapable of doing so.


The only way to grow with the teachings of the Analects is through 
the combination of study and action that Confucius prescribes. First, we 
must read the text from start to finish, over and over again, internalizing 
its key teachings. Second, we must make these teachings work in our 
own lives.

Lecture 16
Ritual Conduct in the 
Analects
I
n previous lectures, you learned about skills discussed in the Analects 
that culminate in the core Confucian principle of consummate 
conduct. In this lecture, you will learn about the practice of ritual 
propriety, or li, which is where everything comes together. For Confucius, 
ritual is not just stuffy rule-following. To understand Confucius and the 
Analects, you must sense in ritual practice a liveliness and spontaneous joy 
that can be difficult to recognize.
The Basics of Ritual Conduct


Consternation among scholars over whether Confucius was stodgy or 
transformative boils down to a single Chinese character: li (禮). This 
character can be translated into English as “ritual,” “ritual conduct,” or 
“ritual propriety.” Li encompasses all three English terms, and we will use 
all three in this lecture.


Ritual is everywhere, and it brings the rhythms of society together even in 
the simplest of movements. It is a mistake to think of ritual only as the big 
stuff—the elaborate ceremonies that remain in shared memories for days, 
months, and years. Ritual, for Confucius, is far more comprehensive than 
most people’s narrow visions allow.


Ritual lies at the very heart of the Analects, and it is perhaps the biggest 
action item in the entire Analects agenda. One of the first passages in the 
text lays out the grand plan that links harmony in society with ritual actions.

Lecture 16—Ritual Conduct in the Analects  117
1.12
Master You said, “The most valuable outcome of ritual 
conduct (禮) lies in achieving harmony. It was this that 
made the Way of the Former Kings so beautiful—small 
and great benefits flowed from it. And yet when things go 
awry, it is not enough just to know about harmony from 
study. Without serious engagement in ritual conduct and 
regulation of its effects, harmony will never be achieved.” 


Harmony is all-important, but one of Confucius’s successors—Youzi, or 
“Master You”—notes that harmony in itself is not the goal. Harmony at all 
costs is detrimental to the larger goals of society.


In the previous passage, Master You is focused on a kind of big picture that 
we don’t often consider when conflict appears in our own lives. What 
he seems to mean is that the core elements of social life cannot simply 
be made to harmonize. We cannot force harmony upon a fundamentally 
flawed situation. 


Ritual requires the proper person—one who is highly cultivated, engaged 
in self-reflection, and deeply learned—to carry out the kind of ritual 
propriety that results in real harmony. This kind of person is able to 
channel all of the skills we have studied into a highly prescribed set of 
actions. Moreover, that person carries out with precision a dizzying array 
of items that have to be memorized, practiced, and then performed.
The Purpose of Ritual Conduct


The point of Confucius’s description of ritual conduct is that we must 
carry out prescribed actions, but enact them with fluid spontaneity. At its 
worst, ritual is much like a weak actor’s poorly read lines, which remind 
everyone that the movement before them is scripted, contrived. At its 
best, ritual is a dizzying display of virtuosity that brings everyone into the 

118  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
moment and raises the level of interaction to create a special kind of 
magic between people.


Confucius speaks directly to the problem of just going through the 
motions in a passage that shows how seriously he took the ritual process.
3.12
The saying “sacrifice as though present” means that one 
must sacrifice as though the spirits are actually present 
and involved in the ritual. The Master added, “If I do not 
engage in the ritual sacrifice myself, it is as though I have 
not sacrificed at all.”


The first sentence sets the tone for Confucius. The saying “sacrifice as 
though present” refers to family and state rituals, and it was already 
common by Confucius’s time. It has remained so even to the present—
adapted to changing contexts, but bearing the core message that it is 
imperative not just to go through the motions in ritual conduct.


In ritual interaction with the “unseen world,” performing the ritual 
consummately means that one must interact with departed spirits. 
Otherwise, the performance becomes just a ceremonial scene. That is the 
last thing Confucius wanted, and it explains his desire to participate fully in 
the ritual process—as though the spirits are present.
The Limits of Ritual Conduct


Confucius did not pretend to understand everything, and nowhere does 
his confusion appear more starkly than in a set of passages in chapter 3 
that relate to a different ritual, one that apparently had little appeal for 
Confucius. The ritual involved the pouring out of wine as a sacrifice to 
ancestral spirits.

Lecture 16—Ritual Conduct in the Analects  119
3.10
The Master said, “After the libation in the di imperial 
sacrifice, I do not desire to watch further.”


The statement “I do not desire to watch further” seems discordant with 
what we already know of Confucius. How can someone so strongly 
committed to ritual practice in all of its details express a lack of interest? 
It appears that exasperation might be a better way to understand 
Confucius’s reaction to this particularly abstruse imperial sacrifice.
3.11
Someone asked the Master about the di imperial sacrifice. 
The Master replied, “I don’t understand it. People who could 
understand it could rule the vast realm as though he possessed 
it right here”—and he pointed to the palm of his hand.


It might be better to think of these passages as the limits of ritual for 
Confucius. The power of ritual lies in its ability to weave its details into 
a transformative swirl that integrates disparate elements of society and 
makes them whole, even if only for a time. But what if the details are so 
obscure that even the greatest aficionados just scratch their heads?


This type of confusion is what we should read into Confucius’s reaction in 
the previous passage. The di sacrifice seems to have lost any tether to social 
reality, and it spins off into the unknown. Although Confucius does not say 
the words, it appears that he finds that kind of detail to be quite useless.


More commonly for Confucius, exasperation was directed squarely at 
upstarts who appropriated rituals so far beyond their place in society 
that he tried to remonstrate with them. More often than not, he was 
unsuccessful.

120  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


The Analects contain a recurring theme in which Confucius speaks out 
against what he saw as ritual abuse. In the following passage, the Ji clan, which 
we have seen Confucius criticize before, is once again at fault in his eyes.
3.6
The Ji clan was about to make the great sacrificial pilgrimage 
to Mt. Tai. The Master asked Ran Qiu, “Can’t you save them 
from this untenable situation?” Ran Qiu replied, “I cannot.” 
The Master sighed, “Is it possible that Mt. Tai is not as able 
as Lin Fang in understanding proper ritual conduct?”


Critiquing the ritual leader of the Ji clan (the “Lin Fang” who is 
mentioned in this passage), Confucius notes clearly that Mt. Tai—the 
great sacred mountain in their midst—is the source of the ritual, not the 
Ji clan. Confucius’s contempt here is clear. How dare an upstart family 
usurp ritual that, for Confucius at least, was embedded in the sacred 
mountain itself and the cosmology it represents? That is one way that 
ritual fails.


How should ritual work, when everything goes beautifully? A passage 
coming just after Confucius’s exasperation with the Ji clan sums up the 
sage’s most positive feelings about rituals. In this passage, he discusses a 
ritual intended to achieve the difficult task of uniting keen competitors.
3.7
The Master said, “Exemplary people do not compete 
with one another. The nearest exception is the archery 
ceremony. Greeting and accommodating each other, 
the archers mount stairs of the hall. Descending, after 

Lecture 16—Ritual Conduct in the Analects  121
contesting, they share a drink together. Even when 
competing, they remain exemplary people.”


For Confucius, the archery ceremony was marked by greeting, deference, 
toasting one another, and contesting with others. In its best sense, then, 
ritual is integrative, bringing even fragmented factions together—even in 
times of intense competition. If there is any hope for the social harmony 
that Confucius desired, people needed to grasp that ritual was not crusty, 
staid, and mechanical behavior. It was instead the very lifeblood of a well-
functioning society.

Lecture 17
Confucius on Embodied 
Ritual and Music
C
onfucius wanted to pour his whole person into ritual conduct. 
This idea has deep roots in the Chinese language; the traditional 
Chinese characters representing “ritual” and “body” are intimately 
tied together. For Confucius, ritual conduct is performative, not a set of 
mere prescriptions. In this lecture, you will learn about Confucius’s view of 
ritual conduct as embodied action.
Attention to Detail


The words spoken in rituals were important to Confucius. Consider the 
following entry in the Analects. For Confucius, details matter, and this 
passage is one of many that speak to the need to get it just right.
7.18
The Master used precise pronunciations and phrasing in the 
following situations—reciting the Book of Songs or the Book 
of Documents, and when engaged in ritual practice. On all 
of these occasions, he emphasized ancient pronunciations.


Confucius was not immune to criticism about his care for detail. In fact, he 
was used to it—even ready for it. In chapter 3, Confucius doubles down on 
detail, going so far as to say that attention to detail is in itself ritual conduct.

Lecture 17—Confucius on Embodied Ritual and Music  123
3.15
When the Master entered the Great Ancestral Temple, he 
asked questions about everything taking place. Someone 
critiqued, “Who said that this fellow from Zou village 
understands ritual processes? When he enters the hall, he 
asks questions about everything!” When the critique was 
reported to Confucius, he said, “That, too, is ritual conduct.”


For Confucius, asking questions had nothing to do with ignorance. Rather, 
it was a strong signal that the inquiring person cared deeply about the 
ritual process. When it comes to ritual conduct, Confucius believed, 
questioning lies at its very heart.


Confucius goes even further just a few passages later. He clearly is ready 
for the criticism that comes with being meticulous about details.
3.18
The Master said, “If, in serving your ruler, you are 
meticulous about each detail of the rites, others will 
consider you to be obsequious.”


If you are following the proper procedures, Confucius says, and if you care 
deeply about how the machinery of politics and ritual cohere, a good 
ruler will surely understand. If your peers find such detail tiresome, that’s 
their problem.


Confucius never takes his eyes off the central message that ritual builds 
upon all of the key skills in the Analects. Ritual is the portal to managing 
the whole world—what Chinese writers called “all under heaven.”

124  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


In these passages, Confucius shows his passion for the very spirit of ritual 
conduct. Ritual is to be practiced, inquired about, and constantly reviewed. 
Maintenance and repair (not to mention study) are as significant to ritual 
as they are at the more developmental stages of learning that we have 
already considered.
8.2
The Master said, “Reverence unchanneled by ritual conduct 
leads to travails. Prudence unchanneled by ritual conduct 
leads to timidity. Courage unchanneled by ritual conduct 
leads to recklessness. Straightforwardness unchanneled 
by ritual conduct leads to boorishness. When exemplary 
people are deeply committed to family and kinship ties, the 
people will seek to be consummate in their conduct. When 
those they have known for a long time are not neglected, 
the people will continue to interact freely with each other.”


In other words, ritual action is the key to vibrancy. On the other hand, 
slavish rule-following leads to deterioration—first of the ritual itself, then 
with greater devastation to the larger community.
Ritual in Social and Political Life


Confucius clearly saw ritual conduct and propriety as a driving force in 
managing self, state, and society. In chapter 14, we come across a passage 
noting that, if leaders adhere to ritual, the people will follow.
14.41
The Master said, “If those in positions of leadership follow 
ritual process, then the common people will be easy to lead.”

Lecture 17—Confucius on Embodied Ritual and Music  125


This passage speaks precisely to the necessary combination of ritual 
commitment and movement. If the learned, reflective, exemplary person 
follows the prescriptions in detailed rituals, that person will channel a 
powerful social force that emanates from the very bodily movements 
ritually performed all the way outward to influence the family, the 
community, and the larger society itself. 


For Confucius, ritual conduct flows outward from the ritual’s language, 
and then that language is embodied and sent forth to transform ever-
larger groups of people. Confucius anticipates several recent scholars in 
stating that the serious practitioner is likely to find better models of ritual 
conduct and propriety in rural enclaves than among his fellow aristocrats.


It is earlier people—the rustics of old—who hold the clues to excellence 
in ritual. Confucius addresses this issue at the beginning of chapter 11.
11.1
The Master said, “The first people to engage in ritual 
practice and play music were the country folk of old. Those 
who have come later were more refined and learned. But 
when it comes to engaging in ritual practice and playing 
music, I follow the first.”


This statement implies that there is something fundamental about the way 
that rustics or simple folk approached ritual. Something powerful is being 
stated here, and it engages more than the relationship between body 
and ritual. It implies that there is a connection to the very foundations of 
ritual practice.
Ritual and Frugality


In the Analects, Confucius links ritual to frugality. This connection is more 
difficult than it might first appear to those of us who easily grasp that 

126  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
spending more than we can afford on graduations, weddings, and funerals is 
foolish on many levels—even beyond the practicalities of the bottom line. 


For Confucius, ritual is not about being stingy; the ritual comes first. Recall 
that Confucius scolded his follower Zigong for begrudging the expenses 
of ritual.
3.17
Zigong wished to abandon the almost defunct ritual 
practice of sacrificing a sheep at the New Moon ceremony 
each lunar month. The Master said, “Zigong! You begrudge 
the price of the sheep. I value the ritual as it is meant to be 
conducted.”


In this context, 25 centuries ago, Confucius perceived the sheep as 
property. He says here that the expense should not be spared. But 
Confucius appears to contradict himself earlier in the same chapter by 
stating the importance of frugality.
3.4
Lin Fang asked about the roots of ritual conduct. The 
Master replied, “A question of the first category! As for 
ritual conduct, it is better to be frugal than extravagant. In 
mourning, it is better to let one’s grief flow than to worry 
over details of decorum.


Clearly, Confucius was concerned with the roots of ritual conduct. 
Sometimes it is necessary to spend whatever the ritual requires. Most 
of the time, however, we should concentrate on genuine emotions and 
fluent, embodied action. Cost is not the central issue.

Lecture 17—Confucius on Embodied Ritual and Music  127


In one prominent passage in chapter 3, Confucius expresses serious 
contempt for one of the stalwarts of early Chinese history, the ruler 
Guanzhong, who lived several centuries before Confucius’s time. In this 
passage, Confucius makes clear that he views Guanzhong as a spendthrift.
3.22
The Master said, “Guanzhong was a vessel of limited 
capacity.” Someone asked, “Do you mean that Guanzhong 
was frugal?” The Master replied, “Guanzhong had three 
different residences, each with a complete staff—each 
person with one assigned duty. How could that be 
considered ‘frugal’?” The interlocutor continued, “If that is 
the case, did Guanzhong understand ritual process?” The 
Master replied, “Rulers of states erect walled gates in front 
of their palaces; Guanzhong also did so. Rulers of states 
also have stands set up for inverted ritual drinking vessels; 
Guanzhong had them, as well. If Guanzhong can be said to 
understand ritual processes, well, then who doesn’t?”


Although the references border on complete obscurity for many readers 
today, Guanzhong figured in Confucius’s world in ways similar to how 
Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan might appear in American political 
discourse today. Guanzhong was a major figure, yet Confucius says here 
that Guanzhong did not understand the limits of ritual propriety.


The matter of frugality also seems to underlie Confucius’s criticism of the 
way Guanzhong imitates the rituals of the ruler of the state. Not only is it 
improper to be adopting rituals intended to be performed by the head of 
state, Confucius seems to be saying, it’s also wasteful.

128  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Ritual and Music


Confucius adds two other ideas to ritual practice that alternately reinforce 
and contest it. First, he states in chapter 3 that ritual lies at the heart of 
consummate conduct. In the following passage, he reverses the way that 
we usually think of developmental stages in Confucian learning. 
3.3
The Master said, “People lacking consummate conduct—
what have they to do with ritual conduct? People who are 
not consummate in their conduct—what have they to do 
with the playing of music?”


Consummate conduct leads, in our developmental model, toward precise 
ritual conduct and propriety. Proper ritual (and music) leads back toward 
further development of consummate conduct. Development is a continual 
process. For the nuanced practitioner, it never ends.


The key to making sure that improvement never ends, Confucius felt, was 
music. Confucius understood what thinkers such as Plato, Jean Jacques 
Rousseau, and (more recently) Allan Bloom expressed in their own 
writings. Music matters. In many ways, consummate conduct finds its 
completion in ritual conduct, but ritual conduct is set into motion with 
music. A beautifully performed ritual is musical in ways that go far beyond 
the actual role of musicians in the events. 


Social life, when it flows in the way that Confucius expressed, echoes the 
melodic flow of music. In the following passage, Confucius links ritual and 
music with exemplary conduct. In addition, he gives us a picture of what 
happens if we don’t do things right.

Lecture 17—Confucius on Embodied Ritual and Music  129
16.5
Confucius said, “Pleasure can be found in three kinds 
of ventures. Injury can result from three others. To find 
pleasure in channeling one’s energy in ritual practice 
and music, to delight in the goodness of others, and to 
enjoy interacting together with companions of worthy 
character—all three of these bring improvement to the 
individual and society. Injury comes from delighting in 
boastfulness, taking pleasure in licentious diversions, and 
from indulging to excess.”


Confucius returns here to his rhetoric of oscillating positives and negatives. 
He is not afraid to talk about the downside, but the power of his teaching 
lies in explicating the upside. And while striving for proper character and 
doing well by others are truly goals for which the serious student should 
strive, it is in music that all of the elements of Confucian teaching come 
together in a powerful, fluid movement. 


Ritual creates community, and it is sustained with music. At its best, the 
society Confucius invokes in his teachings creates something larger 
than any individual could fathom. It is a community founded in personal 
integrity and transformed by communal ritual and musicality.

1.	 Confucius is clear that ritual conduct is not slavish rule-following. Think 
of examples of spontaneous, flowing ritual conduct from your own 
experience.

Lecture 18
The Analects on Effective 
Rule
C
onfucius’s Analects is filled with details about the best ways to 
serve, to rule, and even to step aside when the circumstances 
require. All of the teachings of the Analects come together in 
governing family, community, and all under heaven. That act of governing 
is the greatest challenge in all of Confucian learning. This lecture examines 
how to govern effectively by managing these competing challenges.
A Model for Society


In one intriguing entry in the Analects, Confucius states that to govern is 
to correct.
12.17
Ji Kangzi asked about governing. Confucius replied, saying 
“The key to governing lies in being correct. When leaders 
are themselves correct, their influence will pervade the rest 
of society—who would dare to do otherwise?”


This idea—that to govern effectively is to do what is proper—might 
not sound earthshaking on first hearing. Confucius’s point is profound, 
however. If we are to rule effectively, Confucius seems to say here, we 
need to tweak, hone, and steer.

132  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


This concept builds to the statement that government, and any official’s 
government service, must serve as a model. It is not enough just to maintain 
whatever social order is in place. Government service must correct the 
little twists and turns that slowly set a good society off-course. Governing 
is hard work, as Zilu learns in a passage at the beginning of chapter 13.
13.1
Zilu asked about governing. The Master replied, “Make 
yourself a model, and then inspire the people to work 
industriously.” “Could you clarify?” asked Zilu. The Master 
replied, “Be unrelenting in your efforts.”


Hard work will get you everywhere in Confucius’s world—or at least very 
far along the path. Although the ending of that memorable passage (“be 
unrelenting in your efforts”) perhaps steals the thunder, there is a broader 
message that we should not forget: Government service must be a model. 
It starts with the unflagging efforts of the government official, but that 
official must be a model that radiates a message—in itself—of proper 
conduct in society (family, community, and the larger world).


Confucius persists in the previous passage with an admonition that one 
must learn to correct oneself. How can one be a model without looking 
inwardly at one’s own conduct? It is almost as though the remonstrance 
ideal that we encountered previously is brought to a new level here, and 
that being a model implies making oneself one’s best.


This idea of self-correction links directly back to the personal cultivation 
and maintenance we have encountered already. It is a cycle of individual 
discipline that proceeds outward toward service in one’s family and 
government and then right back toward further renewal of the self. This 
cycle of correction, maintenance, improvement, and repair lies at the heart 
of Confucius’s message.

Lecture 18—The Analects on Effective Rule  133


First we correct ourselves, then we correct others. To put a finer point 
on it, we might say that the two elements are never really separate. In 
paying attention to our own frailties, we are already (perhaps subtly, but 
nonetheless powerfully) correcting others.
Leading by Example


In one passage in the Analects, a visitor asked Confucius about governing. His 
answer speaks to the ritual spontaneity required to bring people together.
13.16
The Governor of She asked about governing. The Master 
replied, “Lead so that those near to you are satisfied, and so 
that those far from you are drawn to you.”


Early in the text, Confucius speaks of the power of good rule to set others 
into motion. The image there is that the people, like the stars above, encircle 
the virtuous leader. In this passage, we see an intriguing twist on that idea: 
Those nearby are happy. The good ruler creates joy all around him.


The good ruler also attracts those far from him to come toward him. 
Confucius means several things by “far” here. The Chinese text clearly 
speaks to our most common thoughts about physical distance. Confucius 
has more in mind, however. Every society has its outliers, and Confucius 
believed in the transformative power of a ruler’s good example. He states 
this sentiment in several places, and never more powerfully than in giving 
advice to an official named Ji Kangzi.
12.19
Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about governing, “What if one 
were to kill those lacking the Way in order to attract others 

134  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
who possess it?” Confucius replied, “Why should a leader 
speak of killing? If leaders wish to be good, the people 
will also be good. The abilities of the exemplary person 
resembles the wind, while that of the petty person resembles 
grass. The wind blows and the grass bends in response.”


The power to sway people with exemplary conduct so far outweighs the 
sheer force of law that there is no comparison in Confucius’s thinking. 
In fact, no amount of punishment or coercion can even come close to 
accomplishing what a shining personal example can. This emphasis upon 
example over punishment would become one of the great points of 
conflict in Chinese history. 


In Confucius’s Analects, shining examples dominate. Perhaps the most 
famous passage in the text states explicitly that institutional measures 
cannot compare to virtuous rule.
2.3
The Master said, “Use legal measures and coercion 
to lead the people, and they will surely seek to avoid 
punishment—yet they will lack a sense of shame. Lead 
them with excellence (德), and regulate them with ritual 
conduct (禮), and they will gain a sense of shame and bring 
order to themselves.”


Of itself, society is molded and transformed through the skills that we 
have encountered to this point. As with Confucius’s descriptions of ritual 
conduct, skillful fluidity in governing creates harmony. Even the simplest 
acts of governing ripple in influence to the larger society.


Leadership failure, for Confucius, is not a matter of chance. Indeed, it 
seems to be close to being a matter of personal character. Leadership 

Lecture 18—The Analects on Effective Rule  135
is a product of putting all of Confucius’s teachings together. No one can 
simply will it.


Confucius speaks to the challenges of hiring and promoting talented 
people when his follower Zhonggong finds his way into public service.
13.2
Zhonggong, while serving as an official for the Ji clan, asked 
about governing. The Master replied, “Make yourself a 
model for government officials, overlook minor faults, and 
promote people of worthy character and ability.” Zhonggong 
inquired further, “How can worthy character and ability be 
recognized?” The Master replied, “Promote those you know 
to be worthy. As for those about whom you are unsure, how 
will others let them slip through the cracks?”


Confucius seems to understand the soft underbelly of effective rule. Even 
the official behind the scenes who promotes and demotes officials is 
vulnerable to chatter, to criticism. Confucius here gives Zhonggong (and 
the rest of us) a way of thinking about how good choices sometimes 
neutralize the tough choices that do not result in an official position.


For Confucius, a ruler’s first priority was to keep the people fed. By 
extension, government needed to provide the setting for people to thrive 
in agriculture and to feed their families. Greed will get rulers nowhere, 
in Confucius’s world. However, the importance of food itself remained 
second to Confucius’s most important teaching: Virtue and setting an 
example beats everything, even having enough to eat.


The following passage may be startling for many listeners, but Confucius 
is adamant. Give up food, Confucius says, before you give up standing by 
your word.

136  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
12.7
Zigong asked about governing. The Master replied, 
“Sufficient food, sufficient arms, and the people’s trust 
that leaders will stand by their words—these are the keys.” 
Zigong inquired, further, “If it is necessary to discard one of 
these three things, which would be discarded first?” “Arms,” 
responded the Master. Zigong continued, “If it were necessary 
to give up another of the remaining two, which would it be?” 
“Give up the food,” replied the Master. He continued, “Since 
early times, everyone has faced death; without trust in a 
leader’s word, society cannot be sustained.”


Nothing, for Confucius, goes ahead of being true to one’s word. Not 
even the sustenance of the ruler and the people. Above all, Confucius 
is concerned with the vitality of the larger community; it is the core 
social message of the Analects, and the ruler is only a tiny part of it. If the 
community will not endure, nothing else is possible.
The Importance of Advisers


From Confucius’s Analects onward, and throughout the Confucian 
tradition, advisers were the key to ruling effectively. This precept is one of 
the reasons why Confucius devoted his own teaching to creating talented 
advisers.


For Confucius, ruling itself was a product of an odd combination of nobility, 
luck, and talent. It was such qualities that could lead someone to become 
a ruler in Confucius’s world of fragmented, battling kingdoms. Advisers, 
however, had only one combination package to offer—their talent, their 
advice, and their management skills.

Lecture 18—The Analects on Effective Rule  137


Confucius’s focus on educating talented advisers is nowhere more clear 
than in a passage in chapter 14. Confucius speaks with contempt about 
a ruler whom he feels has poor moral character, yet who has somehow 
retained power in spite of his failings.
14.19
The Master spoke about Duke Ling of Wei, saying that he 
had lost the Way. Kangzi inquired, “If this is the case, why 
did his state not fail?” The Master replied, “Zhongshu Yu 
managed diplomatic visits, Priest Tuo attended to matters 
in the ancestral temple, and Wangsun Jia was in charge of 
military matters. This being the case, how could the state 
have failed?”


According to Confucius, even a flawed ruler who had lost the Way could 
not come to ruin so long as trusted and talented aides were there to 
institute policy. In the world of kingly rule, in which flawed rulers more 
than occasionally found their way to the throne, it was up to able advisers 
to reset the path of state. 


Failure was not an option, at least in Confucius’s teaching. Confucius’s 
answer to his follower’s question combines devotion to service, correction 
(remonstrance, really), and personal integrity—even when the ruler lacked 
it. And then it all comes together. For Confucius, in a passage in chapter 6, 
all it takes is a single, masterful stroke.
6.24
The Master said, “The state of Qi could, with just one shift, 
become like the state of Lu; with one shift the state of Lu 
could attain the Way.”

138  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Confucius, being from Lu, has a positive vision of his own state. Even 
Qi—a lesser state in Confucius’s estimation—could become as well run 
as Lu. And Lu itself could achieve the highest level of all—attaining the 
Way. All it would take to achieve these ends is one strike, just one move.


If we are to follow the thread of the Analects, we surely understand 
that the “one shift” described in the passage above is focused upon a 
combination of the skills we have studied to this point—filial conduct, 
remonstrance, exerting all of one’s effort, being true to one’s word, 
and living with excellence. These merge into the comprehensive goal of 
consummate conduct, and it all comes together in ritual propriety. 


For Confucius, ruling effectively is thoroughly grounded in the morality 
and integrity of the ruler and the officials surrounding the ruler’s office. 
Confucius maintained that successful individuals always needed to think 
beyond themselves. He was adamant until his death, and his message 
persists, even today.

Mencius: The Next 
Confucian Sage
B
y the time Confucius died in 479 B.C.E., the Zhou order was 
crumbling, and the world would soon turn darker, more violent, 
and more intensely contested. This was the Warring States period, 
when contending domains reduced each other from 200 states all the 
way down to one. When the dust cleared, fully 250 years later, that 
fractured order had been replaced by a vast empire that went far beyond 
what Confucius envisioned. Nevertheless, the Analects would prove to be 
the cornerstone (and, more than occasionally, the lightning rod) for 25 
centuries of Chinese rulers, scholars, and students. This lecture examines 
the life and work of Mencius, a key figure in this fascinating story.
Mencius


One of the key actors in the story of Confucius’s revitalization lived about 
a century after him. Mencius (372–289 B.C.E.) is the only other Chinese 
thinker who was deemed worthy of being given a Latinized name by the 
early Western translators in the 17th century. In Chinese, his name sounds 
like “Mengzi.”


Mencius’s collected writings represent both a spirited defense of 
Confucius’s Analects and a significant expansion of it. Unlike the pithy 
moral aphorisms that dominate the text of the Analects, Mencius’s text 
gives us long narratives that are more akin to dramatic performances. This 
makes them more accessible than the Analects for many people.

140  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Mencius’s text—called, simply, the Mencius—is one of the most important 
books in all of Chinese history. It is almost three times longer than the 
Analects (11,705 characters for the Analects and 34,685 characters for the 
Mencius) and represents a series of social interactions polished into an 
elegant literary format.


Most of what we know about Mencius comes from the book that he and 
his disciples wrote, but Mencius’s text does not give many hints about 
his life. We do know that he was a native of Zou, a small state not far 
from Confucius’s home state of Lu—both are in present-day Shandong 
province in eastern China.


Mencius does not appear in any other texts until he made his way to 
the state of Qi in 324 B.C.E. Scattered texts confirm many of the travels 
mentioned in Mencius’s text, but we know astonishingly little about the 
life he led.


At least one tale about Mencius’s childhood has remained to this day. It 
has been told in many forms, but one of the most memorable appears in 
a little learner’s primer used over the last 1,000 years called the Sanzijing 
(Three Character Classic). It tells a story of Mencius’s mother in rhyming 
three-syllable cadences. Widowed when Mencius was three, she worked 
to give little Mencius the proper learning environment.

Of old, the mother of Mencius
Chose a good neighborhood

Lecture 19—Mencius: The Next Confucian Sage  141
When her son would not study
She broke the shuttle from the loom.


Another version has it that Mencius’s mother moved first to a 
neighborhood near a cemetery, and precocious little Mencius became 
obsessed with funerary practices. This alarmed his mother, who hoped to 
raise a serious scholar. Next, she moved near a market, and little Mencius 
began tallying accounts with the vendors. This also worried his mother. 
Finally, she moved near a school, and her son eventually became one of 
the greatest scholars in Chinese history.
Speaking Truth to Power


Going much further than Confucius, Mencius wastes little time with 
decorum when dealing with the leaders of powerful kingdoms. From 
Mencius’s perspective, the key teachings we have seen in the Analects are 
inherent in the very fabric of social life. For him, the ruler who misses 
them will always fail; the ruler who embraces them will always succeed.


The very first passage of the Mencius gives a fine example of the 
philosopher’s approach to hierarchy, leadership, and conduct. He was in 
the habit of visiting kings, and this passage has him meeting with a certain 
King Hui of the state of Liang. King Hui is impressed that Mencius has 
traveled many hundreds of li to see him. (A li is about one-half of a 
kilometer, or one-third of a mile).
IA.1
Mencius arrived to meet King Hui of Liang. The king said, 
“Venerable sir, you have not regarded a thousand li as too 
distant in coming to see me. Surely you must have the 
means to bring profit to my state?”

Mencius (372–289 B.C.E.)

Lecture 19—Mencius: The Next Confucian Sage  143


You might think of King Hui’s last line as a kind of social nicety, without 
particular force or deep motivation. But Mencius uses it as a way to begin 
crafting his approach to ruling. “What is the point of mentioning profit?” 
asks Mencius. His response is pointed, and immediately the situation 
plays into Mencius’s hands. “All that matters is that there be consummate 
conduct (仁) and rightness (義).” Why on earth, he snaps, would you 
speak of profit or advantage (利)?


Mencius has cut the ruler to size—rhetorically, at least—before they could 
even sit down to a nice, refreshing drink after a long trip. But for Mencius, 
even more than for Confucius, these were not matters of politesse; they 
were the difference between success and failure, thriving and starving, in 
an increasingly vicious world.


The risk of speaking out against powerful rulers on their home turf made 
it an equally serious enterprise. At this point, Mencius begins to explain 
precisely how the state will fail if those who lead it ask how they can 
profit. Everyone from the king’s courtiers to the lowliest commoner will 
ape the leader’s behavior, states Mencius, and all will be imperiled.


A few entries later, Mencius is again speaking with King Hui of Liang.
IA.3
King Hui of Liang said, “I have extended all of my effort on 
behalf of my state. When Henei’s harvest was endangered, 
I moved the people to Hedong, and the grain to Henei. 
When the same thing happened in Hedong, I followed the 
same principle. As for the governing of neighboring states, 
I have not seen them do anything like the work I have 
undertaken. And yet they have not lost population and I 
have not gained, either.”

144  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Mencius cannot seem to bear giving a direct answer that speaks to kingly 
hubris. Instead, he begins with an analogy.
IA.3
“Your Majesty enjoys the ways of war. I request to use an 
analogy from warfare. When weapons are raised and the 
drums begin to beat, a number of soldiers dropped their 
weapons and armor, and deserted. One of them went a 
hundred paces before stopping; another went fifty paces. 
The one who went fifty paces taunted the one who went 
one hundred—what do you think about that?”
“He shouldn’t have taunted him,” replied the King. “One 
soldier did not go a hundred paces, nothing more. They 
both deserted.” Mencius replied, “If that is apparent to you, 
then you will not expect your state to gain population from 
neighboring states.”


Completely entangled at this point, King Hui listens and watches as the 
spider begins to wrap him up in its web. Mencius launches into a long 
discussion of the kingly way and the manner in which a true king pays 
close attention to the proper seasons, so that people can work the fields 
and provide for themselves rather than only toil on behalf of the king in 
war or building projects. Careful attention to people’s labors is precisely 
the point that Confucius made in Analects 1.5: employ the people during 
the proper seasons. 


Mencius continues his lesson by discussing the importance of customs 
and education, hierarchy and discipline.

Lecture 19—Mencius: The Next Confucian Sage  145
IA.3
When those who have lived more than seven decades wear 
silk and eat meat, and the common people are not cold or 
hungry, although their ruler does not have the title of king, 
he truly is one.


Although this sequence is masterful, Mencius is not quite done. To finish 
off his prey, Mencius issues the rhetorical spider bite in very personal 
terms. It seems that the situation is a good deal direr in King Hui’s realm 
than he was willing to acknowledge.
IA.3
When food humans need is given to dogs and pigs, you 
do not know enough to allocate it. When people fall 
from starvation on the road, you do not know enough to 
distribute food adequately. When people die, you seem to 
say, “It wasn’t me; it was the harvest.” But how is it different 
to kill people by stabbing them and saying, “It wasn’t me; it 
was the weapon?” If only you stop doing the same with the 
crops, the common people will flock to your state.


The teachings of Confucius and Mencius have had a significant impact 
on almost all approaches to governing in Chinese history. When rulers 
agreed with them, those teachings worked their way into state policy. 
Even when rulers and thinkers disagreed, they were arguing within and 
against a dominant tradition that had come to be called Confucian, with 
Confucius and Mencius as its two most prominent spokesmen.


Confucius and Mencius weren’t dominant yet, however. It is easy 
to forget that the impact of the Confucian tradition did not emerge 

146  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
directly out of the thought and work of Confucius, or of Mencius. It 
was a later development crafted by imperial governments, and it would 
take centuries to happen. For now, everything was in flux, and many 
thinkers felt that they had much better approaches than the people we 
call Confucians.
Inborn Goodness


Building upon Confucius’s own teachings, Mencius articulated with a 
newfound fire the message that people are born inherently good. All they 
have to do, according to Mencius, is to recapture and relearn what they 
have always held deep within them.


The passage that follows is one of the many memorable Mencian 
interpretations of inborn goodness.
2A.6
People all possess hearts-and-minds that cannot endure 
others’ distress. The Former Kings each possessed such a 
responsive heart-and-mind, and they completed its potential 
with responsive and benevolent government. By living with 
a responsive heart-mind, and putting into practice responsive 
and benevolent leadership, ruling all under heaven was as 
simple as turning over the palm of their hands.


Mencius, again expanding upon Confucius’s teachings about government, 
explicitly connects a sincere heart with compassionate government. 


Mencius is not saying (as critiques of Confucian thought would state 
right up to the present) that having a good heart was limited to self and 
family—for one’s private life, but with no relevance to power politics 
in a messy, complicated era. He is stating that running the whole show, 

Lecture 19—Mencius: The Next Confucian Sage  147
being an effective leader who can unite the empire (something everyone 
wanted to see by the time Mencius reached old age), required having a 
beautifully nurtured, inborn heart of goodness. And everyone has one.
2A.6
When I say that no person lacks a heart-and-mind that cannot 
endure others’ distress, it is for this reason. Imagine a person 
who sees a little child about to fall down into a well. He could 
not endure what was about to happen. His compassion was 
not a result of wanting the good will of the child’s parents, 
nor was it because he wanted the acclaim of his peers, and 
not even because of his aversion to the child’s cries. 


Mencius quickly dispenses with many of the arguments that have been 
made over the ages to respond to the cynicism that becomes a part of 
daily common sense. For Mencius, there is only one reason why even the 
most grizzled and miserable of people will do good in situations that strip 
them of the flawed ways that they have learned from others over the 
years. That reason is compassion.


Mencius goes further, stating that a heart of compassion is the very heart 
of all humanity. Everything must flow from it.
2A.6
This example [of the child near the well] shows that 
anyone without a heart-and-mind incapable of enduring 
others’ distress is not fully human. Anyone who is incapable 
of feeling shame is not fully human. Anyone who is 
incapable of showing deference is not fully human.

148  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Anyone who does not possess a heart-and-mind capable 
of distinguishing good from bad is not fully human.... 
People who possess these four traits are like those with four 
healthy limbs. People who have these capabilities but who 
do not act positively in the world cripple themselves.


You’re not even human, states Mencius, if you do not begin with a heart 
of compassion. So how can you possibly govern humanity? For Mencius, 
as for Confucius, it was a matter of taking all of those inborn qualities 
and polishing them into conduct that will prevail both within and beyond 
the home. Constant learning and development of these qualities is the 
very foundation of all superior human conduct. For Mencius, there is no 
alternative.
2A.6
If people who possess these four elements can further 
develop them, it will be akin to a fire lighting or a rushing 
spring flowing through. When people develop these skills, 
they are capable of leading the territories within the Four 
Seas. And yet, if they do not develop them, they will be 
incapable even of serving their fathers and mothers, much 
less all under heaven.


Mencius is the quintessential spokesman for the Confucian tradition. 
Because Mencius was such a force as a thinker in his own right, it is 
sometimes easy to forget that he was Confucian thought’s most 
influential "review essayist," explicating Confucius’s Analects for later 
generations.

Confucius’s Daoist and 
Legalist Critics
C
onfucius and Mencius were not speaking in a vacuum. Advisers in 
other states had equally strong opinions, and they were not shy 
about sharing them. Even some of those thinkers who generally 
agreed with Mencius disagreed sharply about some of his points. In this 
lecture, you will learn about the work of some of these dissenting scholars.
Xunzi


The most famous disagreement among Confucian thinkers arose between 
Mencius and Xunzi, a writer who lived in the 3rd century B.C.E.


At stake in the disagreement between Mencius and Xunzi was how 
society should be governed in a time of strife—a concrete and urgent 
matter. The argument quickly became the stuff of Chinese philosophical 
legend, and Xunzi has come to be regarded as one of Mencius’s greatest 
foes. The historical telling badly caricatures the depths of both thinkers 
and their programs, however.


Xunzi wrote what some regard as the most inspired literary and 
philosophical essays in the early Chinese tradition. His collected writings 
contain 32 elegant essays that show a level of literary refinement that 
provides a contrast with the brief aphorisms of the Analects and the 
carefully revised transcriptions of social interactions conveyed in the 
Mencius.

Lecture 20—Confucius’s Daoist and Legalist Critics  151


Mencius felt strongly that people were born good. Goodness was always 
there—for everyone, from the beginning and to the core. Xunzi voiced 
the polar opposite view, that human beings were born flawed and in need 
of serious remedy. Only through years of nurturing, learning, and reflection, 
Xunzi believed, could people undo the bad nature with which they were 
born. Consider Xunzi’s pointed rhetoric in the passage that follows.
Mencius said that people’s capacity to learn is evidence that 
their nature is good. I disagree. His statement shows he 
does not know what human nature is and has not pondered 
the distinction between human nature and what is created 
by human beings. Human nature is what Heaven supplies. 
It cannot be learned or worked at. Ritual and moral 
principles were produced by the sages; they are things 
people can master by study and effort….
Now, it is human nature to want to eat to one’s fill when 
hungry, to want to warm up when cold, to want to rest 
when tired. These are all a part of people’s emotional 
nature. When a man is hungry and yet on seeing an elder 
lets him eat first, it is because he knows he should yield.... 
Thus, if people followed their feelings and nature, they 
would not defer or yield, for deferring and yielding run 
counter to their emotional nature. Viewed from this 
perspective, it is obvious that man’s nature is bad and good 
is a human product.


The particulars of this philosophical difference are fascinating, and much 
ink has been brushed over the details of this contrast between these two 
great scholars. If studied carefully, it is possible to tease out some of the 
implications of starting from good and bad with regard to human nature. 

152  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


On a practical level, however, the advice that Mencius and Xunzi give is 
quite similar. Both advocated an intense form of education, one that we 
might call Confucian, to repair the damage that, from Xunzi’s point of view, 
was there from birth, and, in Mencius’s eyes, was caused by society. That is 
the shared teaching of Mencius and Xunzi, and it goes all the way back to 
Confucius and the Analects. Study hard and improve (or recover) yourself: 
that is the core message of the great Confucian thinkers.
The Daoist Critique


Going several steps further than Confucius, Mencius, or Xunzi, China’s 
Daoist philosophers delighted in revealing the flaws in all textual learning 
and all rulemaking. A major theme in these Daoist philosophers’ writings 
is that by striving too much—by being too literal, too result-oriented—we 
will forget to live and forget to be a part of the larger world.


One of the most memorable critiques of bookish education comes from 
a lowly wheelwright of ancient China. It is conveyed to us by the Daoist 
philosopher known as Zhuangzi, who lived from c. 369–286 B.C.E., about 
the same time as Mencius.
Duke Huan was reading upstairs in the hall while Pian the 
wheelwright was hewing a wheel in the courtyard below. 
Pian set aside his chisel and went upstairs, where he said 
to Duke Huan, “Dare I ask what words are in the book 
my Duke is reading?” The Duke responded: “They are the 
words of the sages." "Are these sages alive today?” asked the 
wheelwright. The Duke answered, “They have been dead 
for some time.” The wheelwright said, “Thus what your 
Excellence is reading is like the dregs of dead sages!”
Duke Huan said, “How may a wheel chiseler have opinions 
about my reading? Explain, and I will allow it; if you cannot 

Lecture 20—Confucius’s Daoist and Legalist Critics  153
explain, you will die.” The wheelwright replied, “I, your 
servant, understand things from the perspective of my own 
work. When I chisel a wheel, if I move slowly, it will not stay 
put; if I go fast, it will not carve. I find the way somewhere 
between a pace of fast and slow—I grip the chisel in my 
hands but respond with my heart. I cannot articulate it, 
yet something is contained within me. Your servant cannot 
teach it to his son, nor can his son learn it from him. In 
this manner I have put this into practice for seventy years, 
growing old carving wheels. Men of antiquity could not pass 
on what they practiced, and died. Because of this, what your 
Majesty is reading is the dregs of men of antiquity.”


For Pian the wheelwright, Duke Huan is someone who merely ponders 
the dregs of dead sages, waiting for a moment of inspiration that rarely 
comes. Pian’s hands-on-the-wheel learning is something very different. He 
chisels and shapes his world from the rhythms of his work. It is a matter of 
feel and harmony and flow. If you press or try or strive, you lose that flow.


This characterization of life is a prime example of the early Daoist outlook, 
which emphasized the Way. The early Daoists stressed that the Way was 
like the veins in a piece of jade. They constitute a natural patterning that, 
once followed, is smooth and harmonic. We must follow their paths, not 
force them into straight lines, as Daoists accused the Confucians of doing.


For the Daoist critics of Confucian writers, the real value of learning the 
lessons of the present and past lay in achieving this completeness, this 
effortlessness in the Way—and that goes far beyond what any pedestrian 
sayings about life and learning could ever do.


Zhuangzi, the author of the wheel-chiseling anecdote, delighted in showing 
the Way in the most offbeat of examples.

154  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Cook Ding was carving a cow for Duke Wenhui. His hands 
darted, his shoulders leaned, his feet tapped, and his knees 
bent—performed, without missing a beat, to the tune of The 
Mulberry Grove Dance and the Jingshou Suite—as his knife 
sliced the meat. Duke Wenhui said, “How excellent it is that 
your skills have reached this level!” Cook Ding wiped his 
knife, put it aside, and responded. “What your servant loves 
most is the Way, which surpasses mere technical ability. 
When I began carving oxen all I saw were whole oxen.
“After three years, I never again saw an ox whole. At present, 
I, your servant, encounter it with my spirit, and do not see 
it with my eyes. Knowledge stops and the spirit follows its 
course. Relying on the natural, heavenly pattern, I pierce the 
large openings leading to the largest cavities, following that 
which is inherent. I never cut a tendon or ligament, much less 
a bone. A good cook changes knives each year—he cuts. A 
so-so cook changes knives every month—he hacks. Now 
your servant has already had this knife nineteen years. It has 
carved several thousand oxen, and yet the blade appears to 
have just come from the grindstone.”
To this, Duke Wenhui replies: “Excellent. After hearing 
Cook Ding’s words, I have obtained knowledge of 
nurturing life!”


If there is oneness—if there are lessons for living—in chopping up dead 
cows, we can be sure that it lies there waiting for our personal chiseling, 
crafting, and cutting. Every action has its Way, as any Daoist could tell you, 
but it is only in action that it can be found. The first line of the Daodejing 

Lecture 20—Confucius’s Daoist and Legalist Critics  155
(Classic of the Way and Virtue) states the case in memorable fashion: “The 
way that can be articulated is not the constant way”—道可道非常道也.


The Daoist critique of Confucian thought was perhaps the strongest 
ever leveled at it, even though the Daoists didn’t directly address the key 
question that concerned the Confucians—namely, how to govern. There 
were other critics, however, who had very precise notions of how the 
state ought to operate, and they took a very dim view of Confucian ideas. 
The Legalist Perspective


The biggest problem for Confucian thinkers, who naturally hoped to 
influence people in power with their philosophy, was that few people 
were as capable or willing to adhere to Confucian principles as Confucius, 
Mencius, and their most devoted disciples. Less diligent students too often 
skipped from study to action and back again (or took midday naps). Some 
merely recited the Book of Songs, which Confucius revered, not having 
a clue as to how its teachings might translate into action in the world 
around them.


In the heart of the Warring States period, the Legalist philosopher Han 
Fei, who lived from 281–233 B.C.E., leveled a devastating critique at the 
Confucians. He used the example of a farmer in the state of Song that 
sums up every negative quality of procrastination, silly hopefulness, and 
fatalism that could be found in Confucian thought. The gullible farmer 
remains one of the most memorable examples in Chinese literature of 
missing the point entirely—of seeing only yesterday while tripping over 
today.
Among the people of Song there was a farmer who tilled 
the land. In his field there was a stump. One day, while 
he was farming, a rabbit dashed across the field, hit the 
stump, broke its neck on impact, and died. Seeing this, the 
farmer cast aside his plow and stood guard at the stump, 

156  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
hoping to gain another rabbit. He would find no more 
rabbits in this manner, and the farmer was mocked by 
people in the state of Song.


Most farmers would realize that they should continue hoeing and tilling if 
they want to be able to feed themselves. It does not take much real world 
experience to see the folly in this story. Han Fei tells the story because 
he wishes to assert that Confucius, Mencius, and especially their shallow 
followers are really just stump-watchers.


Han Fei criticizes those who looked to the past for models of government. 
He said that those who sought to bring back the virtues of the Duke 
of Zhou—like Confucius himself—were fuzzy-minded dilettantes with 
no clear idea about how to proceed in a complicated world. They were 
no better than the dull-minded farmer in the state of Song, waiting for 
another rabbit to charge (or for the Duke of Zhou to appear).


Even in the volatile times of the Warring States period, this criticism 
was very harsh. Han Fei derided the kinds of extremes that any bookish 
tradition can create. For every thoughtful, meaningful action that emerged 
from Confucius’s careful study, there were many more people who tried 
to apply his principles but got caught in the morass of detail, or who failed 
to see the other three-quarters of a problem placed right before them.


In the Mencius, King Hui just takes the abuse that Mencius heaps on him; 
his role is to be a literary foil for Mencius. Not so Han Fei. From Han Fei’s 
perspective, the people don’t know what they need, only what feels good 
in the moment. Only the rulers can know what the people need.


The practical takedown by Legalist thinkers seemed to be the ultimate 
counterpunch to Confucianism. And the Confucians seemed dead in the 
water when the Legalists were the ones to unite all under heaven and 
create the first truly unified empire in Chinese history. That empire would 
last in one form or another (with a few gaps) for 2,100 years.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Xunzi maintains that people are born bad, and this idea has been 
persistent in many societies. But Mencius and Xunzi agree that the 
key to life lies in education. Whether good or bad, what is the role of 
learning in shaping behavior?
2.	 The Daoists spoke of being one with the flow of nature. Give several 
examples of being one with the flow in your own life.
3.	 Han Fei argues that looking to the past for solutions is useless (like 
watching for a second rabbit to rush into a stump). What other thinkers 
have emphasized looking forward, not to the past?

State Confucianism and 
Buddhism
C
onfucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism have all exerted powerful 
influences on China. It is no exaggeration, however, to say that 
Confucianism has dominated China since the beginning of the 
Han dynasty. This dominance is due in large part to the tremendous 
influence that Confucian doctrine has had on Chinese education. 
Although it was challenged at almost every step throughout its history, 
Confucianism was resilient, as you will learn in this lecture.
The Qin Dynasty


In 221 B.C.E., the Legalist-inspired Qin dynasty wiped out the last 
contending army and unified China into a new imperial order—one 
that would persist, in one way or another, until the 20th century C.E. The 
Legalists and the Qin state standardized the written script, created an 
administrative structure that would persist for ages, and even proclaimed 
the appropriate width for carriage axles.


The Qin dynasty loathed Confucian thought. There are stories about the 
burning of Confucian texts and of burying Confucian scholars alive—
along with scores of thinkers from other competing schools of thought. 


For a while, the Qin dynasty’s methods appeared to work. The Legalists 
had prevailed, it seemed, and the Confucians had lost. But the behemoth 
of the Legalist enterprise, the all-powerful Qin state, lasted only 15 years 

Lecture 21—State Confucianism and Buddhism  159
(though the new imperial order that the Qin established endured for over 
two millennia).


Most historians today will say that the swift downfall of the Qin dynasty is 
complicated, and that the Legalist rhetoricians, under a kind of ideological 
frenzy, underestimated the nuances of ruling actual people. Confucian 
writers, however, have held for the last 22 centuries that the Qin was 
undone by its very inability to care—its utter lack of compassion for what 
the people actually felt.
The Han Dynasty


After a four-year civil war, the Legalist Qin state was unseated by 
a peasant ruler named Liu Bang, who became emperor of a newly 
established Han dynasty. The Han would rule (with a brief gap) for the 
next four centuries, from 206 B.C.E.–220 C.E. It was during these four 
centuries that Confucian teachings moved from the sidelines right into 
the very seat of power in China—a place where Confucianism would 
more than occasionally be pushed aside, but from which it would never 
wholly leave.


During the Han dynasty, the Confucianism of the Analects became buried 
in a complex amalgam that has come to be called State Confucianism 
or Imperial Confucianism. Confucian thought was incorporated into a 
massive state that was every bit as centralized, and in many respects even 
more so, than the short-lived Qin dynasty before it.


State Confucianism in China developed in two very broad (and quite 
different) ways. On one hand, it developed a sophisticated cosmology that 
integrated Confucian teachings with pre-sectarian Chinese thought. On 
the other hand, the Confucian state developed a particular integration of 
practical and idealistic rhetoric that would last in China up to the present.


Through it all, Confucian thought persisted. The historian Sima Guang, 
writing in the 11th century C.E., believed that Confucianism was what held 
Han dynasty together through the best and worst of times.

The Rise of Buddhism


The Han dynasty suffered internal upheaval in the 2nd century C.E., and 
it collapsed in 220 C.E. Thereafter, China fell into a state of warlordism 
that was followed by the subdivision of Chinese territory into northern 
and southern kingdoms. This Period of Division lasted until the 6th 
century C.E. While tumultuous, this period produced substantial cultural 
transformation.


The most significant political and intellectual change during the Period 
of Division was the entrenchment of Buddhism as an intellectual and, 
indeed, political force from the upper classes down to the common 
people. As a set of doctrines created in South Asia that were brought to 
China, Buddhism was, for many Chinese, a foreign doctrine that disrupted 
important aspects of family ritual and harmony.

Lecture 21—State Confucianism and Buddhism  161


By shaving one’s head and rejecting one’s family, a Buddhist monk or nun 
went against some of the most basic ideas of family reverence known in 
China. Early Buddhist advocates in China argued that it was necessary to 
look beyond these surface-level differences and to focus on a message—
profoundly original in the Chinese intellectual context—that addressed 
human suffering and the impermanence of life. 


For all of its positives, ephemerality and impermanence is something that 
Confucius’s teaching never addressed in a serious manner. Some less-
than-charitable interpretations have described a thoroughly committed 
Confucian life as toiling on behalf of family and state all one’s life. At the 
very end, death is a good rest. This message might have appealed to 
devoted sons of noble or striving-to-succeed families, but it didn’t touch 
the workers in the fields. 


Perhaps not surprisingly, this interpretation of Confucianism did not 
resonate powerfully with Chinese rulers, either. What they regarded as 
severe frugality and a sometimes useless pacifism was problematic, at best, 
for many of them. For that reason, officials tended to be more thoroughly 
Confucian than the rulers who employed them.


Buddhism made its slow, integrative move into China from the middle of 
the Han dynasty onward. It is now so much a part of Chinese tradition 
that it is foolish to think of it as a foreign doctrine. In fact, in spite of initial 
resistance, Buddhism has been a part of Chinese tradition almost from 
the time it arrived. It is no small irony that one of the most persistent 
integrative forces in Chinese history came from afar.


The Three Treasures of the Buddha—the Buddha, the dharma, and the 
sangha—open a window onto a way of thinking about life and religion 
that was startlingly new to China. The Buddha offered the ideal of 
enlightenment to all people; the dharma articulates the universal laws 
of human life; the sangha refers to practicing communities—people who 
have gathered together to follow the Buddhist way. 

162  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


Buddhism’s Four Noble Truths state that life is suffering, and that the ways 
of the world do not bring happiness. Craving lies at the root of suffering, 
and suffering can only end when the cycle is broken. Finally, the Buddhist 
Eightfold Path as a means of ending suffering requires right perspective, 
right thought, right speech, right action, right life-path, right effort, right 
mindfulness, and right concentration. The goal, albeit a distant one, 
is nirvana—not an explosion of joy or lands of milk and honey, but an 
extinguishing, as when two fingers put out the flame on a candle.
Religious Daoism


Although it never was to have the enormous influence of Buddhism on all 
levels of Chinese society, religious Daoism played a significant role in the 
diverse intellectual climate of the time. Its focus on astrology, breathing 
techniques, mysterious sexual rituals, and the ingestion of substances that 
were thought to guarantee immortality deeply influenced many rulers 
and practitioners in later China.


The same Period of Division that saw Buddhism come to the fore as a 
force in Chinese religious life gave power to the writings and practices 
of groups of Daoist adepts in China. Venerating the Chinese philosopher 
Laozi as a deity and raising many other figures into a Daoist pantheon, the 
practices, lineages, and writings of what is often called religious Daoism 
form only a loose connection to the more philosophical teachings of 
Laozi and Zhuangzi.


Many of the deepest teachings of religious Daoism and its various sects 
can be found in the Daozang, an enormous compendium referred to as 
the Daoist Canon. The compilation began in the 4th century as a way to 
bring together varying strands of Daoist thought and practice. It remains 
a vital source for both practitioners and scholars today, even though its 
contents are enormously diverse, containing well over 1,000 scrolls and 
thousands of discrete texts.


A vibrant new style of literature and strange stories took root during the 
Period of Division, and the period saw a wide array of innovative medical 

Lecture 21—State Confucianism and Buddhism  163
techniques and artistic creations. From that moment forward, Confucian 
thought would blend (sometimes almost seamlessly, but at other times 
in a highly contested manner) with Buddhism and Daoism. Legalism, too, 
became integrated into Confucian thought.
Neo-Confucianism


By the Tang dynasty (618–906 C.E.), China had well-developed 
monasteries and academies devoted to Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian 
teachings. The Tang state—and the Sui state before it—each promoted 
a blending of doctrines meant to support their claims to rule and 
perpetuate their own command of the territory.


By the 9th century, after the disastrous rebellion of An Lushan (755–
763  C.E.) that tore the Tang dynasty apart, a number of influential 
thinkers in the Confucian tradition began to articulate a new vision of 
their teachings. These scholars saw Buddhism, in particular, and Daoism 
as undermining the core teachings of Confucianism, on which (they 
argued) Chinese civilization was built. They roundly condemned the 
financial benefits given to Buddhist and Daoist sects, as well as their 
lucrative landholdings.


This backlash had political, economic, and intellectual implications. 
Many landed Buddhist and Daoist estates were confiscated, and 
the organizational strength of the various sects, if not their ongoing 
connections to wide groups of believers, was dealt a severe blow.


The following centuries were turbulent, and they are among the most 
fascinating in Chinese history. The syncretic blending of Confucian, Buddhist, 
and Daoist thought continued apace, even as Confucians doubled down 
on what they thought of as the excesses of the other doctrines.


The Confucian perspective in this period was articulated forcefully in an 
influential essay written by the scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072  C.E.), 
who saw both a past that was problematic and the potential for a 
powerful future. Ouyang Xiu pointed to the disorder created after the fall 

164  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
of the Han dynasty, asserting that it was a time that was ripe for the entry 
of dangerous foreign doctrines that would harm China. The way forward, 
he argued, lay in a commitment to a spirited rethinking of the original 
Confucian vision.


The profound intellectual diversity that followed was a creative synthesis 
of classical Confucian scholarship and the realities of life in a later era. The 
adherents of this synthesis sought to apply what they thought to be the 
original vision of thinkers such as Confucius and Mencius, and thereby to 
reform life around them.


This Neo-Confucian vision prevailed in powerful and often uncontested 
ways for the next 10 centuries. It slowly became so controlling and 
dominant—even with the attendant influences of Buddhism and 
Daoism—that it came to be second nature in the vast and, for the most 
part, unified empire that today we call China.

Lecture 22
Sima Guang and the 
Confucian Revival
T
he revived form of Confucianism that emerged in China in the 11th 
century C.E. is known in the West as Neo-Confucianism. Although 
Neo-Confucianism is difficult to define, its vision of reengaged 
Confucian learning took the Analects seriously while engaging a changing 
world, and it changed China. One of the best ways to understand that 
vision is by taking an extended look at historian Sima Guang, one of the 
giants of Confucianism.
The Life of Sima Guang


Sima Guang lived approximately 1,500 years after Confucius—almost 
1,000 years before our own time. Everyone in China today knows his 
name, whether they agree with his perspectives or not. He is in textbooks 
and on postage stamps, and new books are written about him every 
year. Sima Guang was steeped in the teachings of Confucius. He was a 
Confucian in almost every respect.


One of the most famous stories in all of Chinese history goes like 
this: On a sunny day in the 1020s, a precocious little boy named Sima 
Guang, seven years old, sat reading classical historical documents in his 
father’s well-appointed study. He was the very picture of the diligent 
young scholar in a culture that admired lifelong learners. As Sima studied, 
children played in the large courtyard surrounding the family compound. 
Suddenly, cries of confusion came from the courtyard. Sima Guang’s 
biography in the Songshi, or Song Dynasty History—a work compiled 

166  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
in the 14th century by a team of historians in the subsequent Yuan 
dynasty—tells what happened next.
A group of children was playing in the courtyard when 
one child climbed onto a large, decorative urn. His feet 
slipped and he fell into deep rainwater in the vessel. The 
other children fled in fear and confusion, but Sima Guang 
grasped a stone and broke the vessel, saving the child’s life.


This passage shows the very picture of the Confucian vision. It was the 
little reader—the gifted student of the classical histories—who was able 
to move directly from text to action, from clear knowledge of his books 
to making a difference in the world.


Far from presenting Sima as a young hermit, it shows that only he was 
able to take action and save the life of the drowning child. The other, 
presumably less serious, children were unable to cope with the enormity 
of the problem and fled. The roughhousing youths likely had far more 
experience in the world than the seven-year-old bookworm in his father’s 
study. But only little Sima was able to bridge the fundamental gap between 
learning about the world and living in it. Only Sima put down his book, 
switched roles, and picked up a rock.


This story has everything to do with the big, historical management 
book that Sima Guang would later write. It has everything to do with the 
larger story of how Confucian learning was supposed to lead to active 
engagement in the world.


Forty years later, after passing the highest state examinations at a 
breathtakingly early age and moving quickly through the administrative 
hierarchy, Sima Guang found himself in another study—that of the 
emperor himself. The immensely talented Sima held the prestigious 

Lecture 22—Sima Guang and the Confucian Revival  167
position of chief tutor to the emperor Yingzong. It was a sure route to the 
premiership, the highest civilian office in the empire.


His official task was to explain the lessons of the past to the emperor 
in a way that could help him function smoothly in difficult political and 
managerial situations. In fact, he had been doing this for decades. The Song 
Dynasty History explains.
When Sima Guang was seven years old, he already 
appeared to be a highly accomplished individual. He would 
hear the classical histories recounted by the family tutor; he 
admired them, and explained their contents to his family, 
all the while highlighting the broad outlines and teachings 
for them. From that point onward, he was never without a 
book in his hands, to the point that he paid no attention to 
hunger or thirst, heat or cold.


In 1066, a mature Sima Guang highlighted the broad outlines of the 
classical histories not for his family, but for the emperor. He distilled the 
lessons from China’s history as a way of showing how government should 
be managed in the present day. He had already spent a lifetime studying, 
and throughout that life he had constantly sought to translate his learning 
into meaningful results in the world around him. 


Sima was on the verge of putting all of his knowledge into practice in a 
position of great influence. But in 1067, the emperor Yingzong died, and 
his eldest son, Shenzong, succeeded him. Sima Guang quickly learned that 
he would have a difficult time convincing the late emperor’s son of his 
cautious Confucian perspective. After a year of trying (unsuccessfully), his 
influence was on the wane and his chief rival was given the premiership 
over him. So Sima retired to Luoyang, a city 200 miles away, and wrote.

168  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius


The result of Sima Guang’s efforts, a 10,000-page book called the Zizhi 
tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Ruling), is a brilliant combination of 
painstaking scholarship and very angry revenge. It is both a commentary 
on past political developments and a guidebook to effective government. 
Sima and his five assistants scoured over 300 original historical sources 
and placed what they saw as the best elements into their new book. They 
then provided layers and layers of commentary from the time the events 
happened, from later pundits, and in their own words.


It is these commentaries that constitute the managerial gold in the 
Comprehensive Mirror, because they create a series of linked case studies 
showing not only what happened over the course of close to 1,500 years 
of Chinese policymaking, but how the various actors outlined, argued, 
and implemented the policies. The work hammers home several lessons 
so powerfully that every careful reader has been influenced by them for 
almost 1,000 years. The lessons are rooted in the Analects, but are shaped 
by Sima Guang to suit later eras, in which society, the economy, and the 
political system had changed dramatically.
Sima Guang on Hierarchy


Sima Guang studied Confucius and the Analects assiduously. He regarded 
the articulation of roles as the first and most formative lesson for all 
effective management. Sima begins the Comprehensive Mirror with it, and 
configurations of changing roles appear on virtually every page. Changing 
roles, which are a part of all of our lives, can be seen in children becoming 
parents—and then grandparents. Changes occur when people complete 
courses of study, when employees are promoted or demoted, and in 
many more situations. 


If Sima Guang were to appear suddenly as a management consultant 
in an American corporation, he would likely be struck by how hard 
Americans try to pretend that these variations in roles don’t exist. For 
Sima, “hierarchy” was not a bad word. The reader of the Comprehensive 
Mirror learns that nothing is ever exactly level.

Lecture 22—Sima Guang and the Confucian Revival  169


Even in China during Sima Guang’s time, making hierarchy work could be 
frustrating. Consider the following excerpt from the Comprehensive Mirror 
that speaks to this difficulty.
The Emperor once arrived suddenly at the gate of the 
shangshu. Prostrating himself, Chen Jiao asked the emperor, 
“Whither are you bound, Your Majesty?” The emperor 
said, “I want to examine the state documents.” Jiao said, 
“This is my duty and not a thing Your Majesty should take 
care of. If I have been remiss in my duty, I request that I be 
dismissed forthwith. Your Majesty ought to return.” The 
emperor was ashamed and, turning his carriage, returned.


This is as far from top-down management as we could imagine. In many 
ways, Sima Guang calls for attunement—a kind of harmony within the 
organization—that leaders must understand if they hope to succeed in 
a complex world and at home. As in this example, the tune can be a 
clanging, abrasive reminder that the person in charge isn’t in charge alone. 


Sima Guang’s arguments are based solidly on the teachings of Confucius’s 
Analects, but they also tackle issues so far from those Confucius envisioned 
as to require a rethinking of their implications. Living in the 11th century 
and writing a work of history that covered the full expanse of time 
from the century Confucius died to the beginning of his own era—403 
B.C.E.–959 C.E.—Sima Guang charted the development of a Chinese 
imperial system and taught how Confucian principles still mattered, no 
matter the complexity of the organization.
Sima Guang on Remonstrance


Remonstrance is the art of warning—the art of the junior member of any 
unit telling the senior what he needs to hear. The Comprehensive Mirror 
contains 10,000 pages on this topic. Sima Guang highlighted remonstrance 

170  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
for a reason: it is this vital shift that puts the other lessons into motion and 
creates an organization that learns.


Criticizing your boss is about as fraught as life gets in relative peacetime. 
Bosses can certainly teach their employees a good deal, but they need 
information too. Subordinates are often in the best position to deliver this 
information. If the information is bad, subordinates often keep silent. By 
contrast, the Comprehensive Mirror is filled with colorful and sometimes 
startling examples of ministers of government staring down emperors 
and telling them what they need to hear.


Lively examples sit side by side in the Comprehensive Mirror with less 
dramatic reminders to the ruler that the criticism is not personal. The 
subordinate’s loyalty is to the organization and its ideals, not just to the 
person who happens to be in charge. Loyalty to something beyond 
the person who happens to be in charge at the moment is a powerful 
message that can embolden employees and make bosses shudder. This is 
generally a good thing for organizations.


One point is certain, and Sima Guang knew it well: When knowledge 
moves upward in this manner, organizations prosper. Remonstrance is the 
dynamic that sets the organization’s learning structures spinning. When 
practiced as an organizational art—the way that Sima Guang articulated 
throughout the Comprehensive Mirror—it contains the kernels of powerful 
growth and continual learning for individuals, divisions, and corporations. It 
takes the core lessons of the Analects and shows how they can work in a 
world that had changed markedly since Confucius lived. 


Sima Guang saw that the greater goal of an organization needs to be not 
mere cooperation, but coordination. Coordination results in this transfer 
of knowledge as a matter of course, like playing the notes on a scale. Such 
coordination may sound impossible, but Sima Guang thought otherwise. 
The Comprehensive Mirror focuses on the goal of achieving coordination in 
all organizational practice.

Lecture 22—Sima Guang and the Confucian Revival  171


Sima Guang’s reinterpretation of Confucius was enormously influential. 
His approach to history in the Comprehensive Mirror led to innovations 
in historical scholarship throughout China, and it influenced Confucian 
thinkers in Japan and Korea as well. And Sima Guang’s own life story 
has been a part of Chinese life for most of the last millennium. Sima 
Guang and the Comprehensive Mirror remain a lively topic in China to the 
present day.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Sima Guang, echoing Confucius and others, felt that hierarchical order 
was a foundation of society. Americans are largely skeptical of hierarchy. 
How do you feel about hierarchy in your life? When has it worked? 
When hasn’t it?
2.	 Sima Guang was a bookworm when he was young, yet he was able to 
respond effectively in real-life situations and saved a drowning child. Can 
you think of other examples of moving from text to action?
3.	 Confucius (and Sima Guang) emphasized that people must fully 
embrace their roles. What roles do you play, and how have they 
changed over the course of your life?

Lecture 23
Neo-Confucianism and the 
Political Order
T
he great historian Sima Guang was not the first committed 
Confucian who sought to craft the teachings of Confucius for a 
new age. From Sima Guang’s Northern Song dynasty onward, 
Confucianism would enter a new period that would reshape the very 
foundations of education and government in China. This lecture will 
examine several figures who played key roles in the development—and 
eventual ossification—of Confucianism in China.
Ouyang Xiu


Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) was one of the consummate scholar-officials of 
11th-century China, and he played significant roles in politics, administration, 
and letters during his long official career. He is known for a number of 
influential essays that are still anthologized today, as well as a wide range 
of innovative poems. 


Ouyang was also one of the Northern Song’s great innovators in historical 
writing, which had come to be a leading genre for Confucian thinkers 
over the centuries since Confucius. Ouyang’s historical writings were fresh 
interpretations of the recent past that were sometimes criticized for being 
too innovative, too ready to espouse a strongly Confucian vision of the 
past.


This strong commentarial voice was one of Ouyang’s major contributions 
to a century of Confucian change in historical writing. Ouyang Xiu deeply 

Lecture 23—Neo-Confucianism and the Political Order  173
influenced Sima Guang as a Confucian government official and historical 
scholar. Ouyang’s influential essay, “On Fundamentals,” is a spirited 
celebration of Confucian principles, and it builds in its conclusion to a 
criticism of other doctrines, such as Buddhism and Daoism.
The Cheng Brothers


The reassertion of a powerful Confucian vision had only begun by the 
time Ouyang Xiu and Sima Guang died in the 11th century. Another major 
Northern Song dynasty intellectual, Cheng Hao, and his younger brother, 
Cheng Yi, are often credited with further reinvigorating Confucian studies. 
Building upon the work of Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, and others, they 
created the foundation for a new kind of Neo-Confucian scholarship 
based on the study of li, or immanent principle.


One way to think about immanent principle is to see everything in the 
world as having a principle manifested within it that gives it a particular 
character. And while each thing in the world has its own immanent 
principle, all of these are enveloped in one overarching principle. This 
Neo-Confucian philosophical turn used the Analects as a foundation, but 
moved far beyond Confucius’s questions to others that considered more 
directly how the world (and cosmos) worked.


Together, the Cheng brothers are regarded as two of the Six Masters of 
Northern Song thought. Cheng Hao held that immanent principle was 
a core principle of nature and that it gave rise to all things. At the core 
of the individual’s behavior was ren (consummate conduct). Cheng Hao 
defined ren in terms of feeling, even empathy, maintaining that patients 
who are numb to pain or itching are akin to people without consummate 
conduct—they cannot feel in a full manner.


This capacity for empathic response fueled further teachings on moral 
cultivation and action in the wider world. For Cheng Hao, the subtle 
interplay between tangible matters of the universe—things we can see 
and touch—and the intangible immanent principle created the foundation 
for an innovative approach to human conduct in a changing cosmos. But 

174  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
these ideas are so far from the Analects that it is possible that Confucius 
would have had to be retaught his lessons for a new era.


Known as a lively and outgoing individual, Cheng Hao thrived in the 
dynamic social universe of 1070s Luoyang, the central Chinese city where 
a conservative faction of Confucian officials lived in semi-exile. Recall that 
Luoyang is where Sima Guang composed the Comprehensive Mirror. Cheng 
Hao’s personal influence on his contemporaries was strong, and it played a 
role in the gradual acceptance of lixue, or “Studies of Immanent Principle,” 
in the Chinese intellectual world. Cheng Hao died in 1085 at age 53.


More taciturn than his brother, Cheng Yi eschewed administrative 
office. The fact that he outlived his elder brother by 20 years benefited 
their mutual legacy, even though those years were checkered by court 
factionalism and divisive politics. Cheng Yi diverged somewhat from the 
teachings of his brother and the early master Mencius with regard to self-
cultivation and learning over the course of a lifetime. For Cheng Yi, moral 
cultivation was grounded in jujing, or composed living. 


Self-reflection required cultivation of the heart-mind with a calm 
disposition. Through it all was the Cheng brothers’ focus on the overarching 
immanent principle of li, and Cheng Yi expanded slightly on Cheng Hao’s 
assertion of tianli (“heavenly li”) with the famous statement that “heaven 
is li” (tianzhe li ye). In this statement he combines two powerful ideas and 
ties them together as one.
Zhu Xi


The ideas of Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, the Cheng brothers, and many 
other Confucians of the 11th century had a profound influence on Zhu 
Xi (1130–1200), an intellectual who lived a century later. Zhu Xi did 
much to further this version of Neo-Confucianism and create a kind of 
bibliography of Neo-Confucian philosophy.


One of the foremost intellectuals in all of Chinese history, Zhu Xi not only 
offered new approaches to the expanding school of Neo-Confucianism, 

Lecture 23—Neo-Confucianism and the Political Order  175
he also reshaped the very curriculum that subsequent generations would 
study. He fundamentally reorganized Confucian education on the model 
of what became known as the Four Books: Confucius’s Analects, the works 
of Mencius, and two small sections of the Classic of Rites that Confucius 
admired. This new approach became the foundation for all scholarship 
leading to the imperial examinations for over six centuries.


Zhu Xi was born in Fujian province, and stories of his youthful precocity 
abound, as is common with major intellectual figures in China. Although 
he passed the imperial examinations at the strikingly early age of 19, he 
did not immediately assume office, instead preferring various sinecures 
that allowed him to focus on reading, study, and reflection.


Well into his third decade, Zhu Xi’s education was eclectic, including 
serious study of both Buddhist and Daoist traditions, in addition to the 
Confucian works that he had to master for the examinations. It was not 
until he was 30 years old that Zhu Xi took up the advice of his father, by 
then deceased, and began sustained study of the Confucian tradition.


Elaborating upon the ideas of heavenly li of Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi, 
Zhu Xi maintained that li is immanent in all things and connected to taiji 
(“supreme ultimate”), a kind of universal power. Qi (“substance, matter”) 
is the tangible manifestation of li, and the two work together in a constant, 
flowing process. They vary in terms of yang and yin energy and in their 
relative strengths at any one moment.


The extension of these Confucian ideas into the realm of human learning 
and conduct was a key element of Zhu Xi’s ethical teaching. He strongly 
criticized Xunzi and championed Mencius regarding the innate nature of 
human beings. Echoing Mencius, Zhu Xi argued that people were born 
with perfect li. That clarity could be sullied by excess qi; the key to moral 
self-cultivation was to clarify li’s effects. 


Zhu Xi maintained that knowledge of the world and action in it worked 
together. Even so, many of his teachings clearly prioritize the search for 
knowledge, leaving action in the world less clearly articulated. At the core 

176  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
of knowledge and action for Zhu Xi was “The Investigation of Things” (格
物 gewu). As with li and qi, these investigations require seeing more deeply 
the relationship between immanent principle and physical matter. Debate 
over the implications of these investigations continues to this day.
Wang Yangming


Wang Yangming (1472–1529) was another of the most prominent 
intellectuals of China’s late imperial period. He combined enormous 
talent as a general and administrator with one of the liveliest philosophical 
agendas in all of Chinese history.


Wang passed the imperial examinations in 1499, saw a brief period of 
exile when he got into a dispute with one of the emperor’s powerful 
eunuchs in the early 16th century, and then served as governor of the 
province of Jiangxi. In his decades of administrative service, Wang was able 
to put some of his teachings into practice and see for himself the effects 
of his philosophical outlook on actual policy and administration.


As a young man Wang studied the works of “Cheng-Zhu” philosophy—
the writings of Cheng Hao, Cheng Yi, and Zhu Xi. Wang lived more than 
three centuries after them, and much had changed in that time.


Wang’s dissatisfaction with the Cheng-Zhu emphasis on the dynamics of 
learning led him toward a fresh approach toward action in the world. 
Arguing that knowledge could not be prior to action—that they were 
deeply intertwined at all levels—he found many earlier thinkers in the 
Confucian traditions to be irredeemably flawed.


Wang also maintained that learning is not by its very nature good. It can 
degenerate in profound fashion, and memorization, recitation, and other 
popular approaches easily broke down into “vulgar learning” (suxue) that 
actually harmed the educational process. Serious learning meant careful 
study and reflection—internalization of teachings—rather than merely 
studying for an examination.


Wang further asserted that immanent principle was not in the mind, but 
was rather one with the mind. This seemingly subtle adjustment to the 
teachings of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi had profound implications. 


Wang argued that the world cannot be investigated independently of 
the self, and that our notions of objective knowledge had to be adjusted 
accordingly. Thinkers to this day in China and the West grapple with this 
issue, whether in the terms expressed by Wang Yangming, Immanuel Kant, 
or others. 
Examination and Ossification


In China’s later dynasties, the feverish and bountiful philosophical 
speculations of Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, the Cheng brothers, Zhu Xi, 
and Wang Yangming slowly became frozen in place as a kind of ossified 
commentarial shell. Within decades, this shell became as much an 
intellectual prison for young scholars as it was once ripe territory for 
innovative thought.


In the centuries after Zhu Xi’s death, even if every other variable had 
stayed the same, the Four Books focus of the curriculum would have had 
a debilitating effect. Within decades, students were memorizing the Four 
Books and devoting the rest of their studies to the products that emerged 
from a burgeoning industry in cram books and cram schools.


Something dangerous for the growth of young minds was happening, and 
it would persist for many hundreds of years, to the point that a wicked 
backlash was inevitable. It is one thing, as in the 1,500 years before Zhu 
Xi, for study of Confucius to be strongly recommended, or even required. 
It is another thing entirely for Confucius to be the key to the inner 
chambers—the only game in town—with other readings added only as 
study continued to more advanced stages.


The examination system remained geared to producing officials for a 
society of approximately 100 million. In 1400, there were 36 Chinese 
provinces; in 1900, there were 38. As a result, 500 years later there was 

178  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
still almost the same number of governors to be selected through the 
rigorous examination system. But during this time, in which the Four 
Books became the foundation of Chinese civil-service education, the 
population of China exploded from an already formidable 100 million in 
Sima Guang’s day to 400 million in the late 19th century. The number of 
official positions didn’t even begin to keep pace. By 1500, the possibility of 
rising through the myriad levels of testing had gone from dismal to nearly 
impossible. 


It only got worse from there. A prominent novel of the 18th century—
In the Groves of Scholarship (儒林外史 rulin waishi), sometimes translated 
simply as The Scholars—laid bare the misery of examination seekers, 
teacher-charlatans, and predatory merchants seeking to benefit from the 
willingness of families to pay for their sons to be “educated.” Both irony 
and rebuke lay at the heart of The Scholars. Consider the following preface 
to the text.
The four words “success, fame, riches, and rank” are the 
number one focal point of the whole book. Therefore 
this theme is broached right at the beginning.... All the 
multifarious variations of the rest of the book are but 
hellish transformation of these four words made manifest. 
It can be said that this is similar to a blade of grass turning 
into a sixteen-foot golden Buddha.


As the 19th century wore on into its third, fourth, and subsequent decades, 
these words would haunt educators in China. The examinations had been 
transformed into a great, glowering “golden Buddha” of retribution, and 
his sights were set squarely on Confucius himself—the lonely sage who 
couldn’t even find a significant position in his own lifetime.

Questions to Consider
1.	 How did Confucian teachings develop as Confucianism, Daoism, 
Buddhism, and other traditions blended together 1,000 years after 
Confucius lived?
2.	 How did later Confucian thinkers use the Analects and its ideas in new 
ways?
3.	 What were some of the implications of adding Confucius’s Analects 
to the curriculum required of every person who studied for the 
examinations in China for more than 500 years? More broadly, what 
becomes of a text when it is required (good and bad)?

Lecture 24
Confucius’s Comeback in a 
Global World
T
he long history of imperial China ended with the forced resignation 
of the last emperor of the Qing dynasty. By that time, Western 
powers had long been exerting a strong influence on internal 
Chinese affairs through aggressive trade practices, gunboat diplomacy, and 
open warfare. The Chinese government and its Confucian civil service 
system seemed helpless in the face of this onslaught, and strong internal 
pressures began to develop. This lecture examines these developments 
and the current state of Confucianism in China and around the world.
Attempts at Reform


Toward the end of the Qing dynasty, China’s stultifying array of rituals and 
rules had bound its populace and limited its progress. Confucian practices 
had long been central to that system. As the decades went on—and as 
the news became steadily worse with regard to foreign intrusion and the 
inability of China’s rulers to check it—a drumbeat began to be heard: It’s 
all Confucius’s fault.


Confucius had become so dominant through the very civil-service 
examination system that was meant to make his teachings resonant, 
nuanced, and subtle, that his teachings instead came to be associated 
with almost everything traditional in Chinese society. When both internal 
and external pressures began to mount, the Confucius (and the Analects) 
associated with traditionalism came to be anathema, the very target of 
disgust from everyone who sought to reform the way that China operated.

Lecture 24—Confucius’s Comeback in a Global World  181


Equally deep frustration echoed throughout East Asia. Why would a 
Confucian-centered examination system train people for anything like 
the challenges of a changing world? From this perspective, the changes 
advocated by scholars who tried to adapt Confucianism to new times—
people like Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, the Cheng brothers, Zhu Xi, and 
Wang Yangming—were wholly inadequate in the face of the enormous 
impacts of global commerce and social unrest.


The battle for ascendancy between Confucianism and its detractors took 
many forms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many Confucians 
thought of themselves as pragmatists, and it was not at all uncommon 
to see a focused kind of internal Confucian reform in the writings and 
actions of scholars, officials, and even military warlords.


For a brief period, the attempts at reform found their way to the higher 
reaches of the Qing imperial government with an innovative program 
set forth by Prince Gong (1833–1898). This program was ultimately 
crushed by a different kind of traditional authority in the person of the 
empress dowager Cixi, who exerted great influence over China for close 
to 50 years until her death in 1908. But that should not make us take 
less seriously the sincere attempts within the Chinese government to 
use Confucian thought—including the specific lessons of the Analects 
themselves—to remake China at the dawn of a new century.


A new age was upon China in the first decade of the 20th century. The 
last imperial examinations were given in 1905 and the final lower-level 
exams about a year later. Suddenly, Zhu Xi’s chosen Four Books were no 
longer required reading, and there was no clear replacement in sight. Both 
traditionalists and reformers were looking at a dramatically new landscape.


Half a decade later, the imperial government fell. It was replaced by a 
Republican government that was riddled not only with internal conflict 
and external weakness, but also an initial lack of vision about what a 
modern China really was. This set the tone for a great debate about the 
role of traditionalism (and Confucius in particular) that rages in East Asia 
to this very day. 

182  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Communism and Nationalism


With the advent of a Republican era in China, the cases for and 
against Confucius took starkly opposed tracks. The Nationalist Party, 
or Guomindang, which controlled much of China until the Communist 
takeover in 1949, gave a warm embrace to both Confucian and Christian 
teachings. While the embrace wasn’t always without tension, it did begin 
to signal two broad camps in modern Chinese life: those who sought an 
Eastern Ethics and Western Science approach, and those who rejected 
Confucian traditionalism outright, blaming it for the bulk of China’s ills.


Along with that split, the 20th century saw emerging critiques of Confucius 
and Confucianism grow to arguably their greatest intensity. From the fall 
of the empire until the last decades of the century, writers of fiction and 
political thinkers savaged traditional culture. On some level, Confucius was 
the stand-in culprit in the narratives, not so much because of specific lessons 
he promulgated as because of the ubiquity of his message over the centuries.


At the same time, another equally significant trend was developing. 
Following a long line of thinkers who sought to bridge East and West, 
including those who took the Eastern Ethics and Western Science view, 
Nationalist intellectuals sought ways to reconcile Confucian and Christian 
teachings, on the one hand, and a rapidly changing international situation 
in the wake of World War I, on the other.


The stakes in these internal debates became even higher in the face of 
Japanese aggression and World War II. Japan was eventually subdued with 
the help of Allied Forces in 1945, but a bitter, all-out civil war erupted 
between the Nationalists and Communists almost immediately thereafter.


By 1949, the Communists were victorious, and what was left of the 
Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan and set up a rival government that still 
rules that island today. The Communists, meanwhile, began to assert a 
very different kind of rule over the bulk of continental China.


With the Communist triumph over the Nationalists, Mao Zedong 
announced in Beijing on October 1 of that year that “the Chinese people 

Lecture 24—Confucius’s Comeback in a Global World  183
have stood up.” Although the actual words could be interpreted in various 
ways, later events clearly show that part of that “standing up” was to be 
against traditionalism. As it turned out, Confucius was to bear a large 
brunt of the attack.


From the early 1950s through the devastating decade of the Cultural 
Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, the Analects was pilloried. Moreover, 
Confucius’s birthplace in Qufu—and particularly the vast, rolling Confucian 
Cemetery in Qufu’s outskirts—were devastated by vandalism from the 
young Red Guards, who were vehemently antitraditional. So thorough 
was the systematic contempt for Confucius that it seemed to present a 
profound break between an earlier traditional history that embraced the 
sage and a modern history that utterly rejected him.


Perhaps out of sincere ideological commitment, and perhaps with a bit of 
strategic thinking, the defeated Nationalist general Chiang Kai-shek took 
a starkly different path in the island-bound Republic of China (known to 
many as Taiwan). There, traditional teachings remained the foundation of 
a modern educational system and an economy that would be among the 
world’s most vibrant in the latter half of the 20th century. The Nationalists 
seem to have concluded that at least part of the path back to playing a 
role in Chinese life lay in embracing Confucius—even as their powerful 
and hostile neighbors across the Taiwan Strait rejected him.
Confucianism’s Resurgence


Confucius and the Analects have since made a spectacular recovery 
with the Chinese government and in its messages to both domestic and 
international audiences. That this could have happened mere decades 
after the graves of Confucius’s family were being destroyed in the sage’s 
hometown is remarkable. Nevertheless, an active Confucian message is 
being aggressively promulgated both internally and abroad.


China has been subtle enough in its use of Confucianism to make it 
an effective new means of outreach in the Western world. Westerners 
who know China only through what they read often get a very skewed 

184  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
picture of life there, and through a lens that frequently stresses Chinese 
authoritarianism—hard power, in the terminology of international 
relations.


But China has been increasingly effective with a sophisticated form of soft 
power, and never more so than in the growing (and enormously well-
funded) set of Confucius Institutes that have sprung up all over the world. 
The institutes are funded by the Chinese Ministry of Education, and they 
are not completely independent operating entities. Formed ostensibly 
to promote the teaching of Mandarin Chinese, they have become both 
cultural oases in areas with little knowledge of Chinese culture and highly 
contentious zones of conflict in universities that are not used to dictates 
coming from foreign governments.


In 2006, an obscure professor of dietary science (not Confucian studies) 
named Yu Dan became an instant sensation throughout China by 
publishing a series of reflections on the Analects for a readership that 
no one then realized was ravenous for Confucius’s message. Yu Dan’s 
approach makes textual scholars squirm, because it can seem like a self-
help lesson with no connection whatsoever to the text of the Analects. 
Indeed, some people have called Yu Dan a charlatan, and a few have 
booed her off the stage at Beijing University. Nevertheless, Yu Dan has 
become fabulously wealthy by providing the hope that ordinary people 
can engage with the teachings of the great sage of Lu. She has shown 
that people want—and possibly even need—those seemingly outmoded 
teachings. Demand for books on Confucius has injected new vibrancy 
into the publishing industry.


In spite of the criticism Confucius’s ideas have received since ancient 
times, when we ask today how we should live our lives in a 21st-century 
world, Confucius is still there. Confucius is still the face of China, and his 
persistent teachings speak to how we should live with integrity and with 
others.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Pressure for change in China came from the inside and the outside in 
the 19th century. Can you think of other historical situations in which 
the emphasis is often placed on outside forces, masking the inside ones?
2.	 Confucius in many ways became the stand-in for everything bad about 
traditional China by the early 20th century. Can you think of parallels in 
which one traditional figure becomes the focus of a large number of 
arguments for change?
3.	 Confucius and the Analects have made a remarkable resurgence in the 
past few decades. What do you see that is persistent in the teachings of 
the Analects that might contribute to that resurgence (or do you see it 
mostly as a matter of outside forces and issues)?

Afterword
H
aving completed these 24 lectures, you have learned not only a great 
deal about Confucius, but also much about his followers, the Analects 
itself, and the development of a Confucian tradition in China. You 
have a grasp of the most central conceptual elements in the text, and you 
have developed a working sense of some of the individuals mentioned in the 
book. These lectures form a self-contained whole, and you now have a good 
working knowledge of the subject.
This afterword is designed for those listeners who wish to keep learning 
about Confucius and the Analects. As we have seen, Confucius valued a kind 
of all-in study that never ended. He wanted serious stories to join a broad 
conversation about how to live among others in a complex world. If you are 
inclined to pursue such a project, the place to begin after these lectures is the 
text of the Analects itself. Toward that end, we’ll begin a list, much like we did in 
the foreword to this guidebook.
[1] Read
Read half a dozen translations together. Your reading 
should be both comparative—reading passages that speak 
to you in all of the books—and cover to cover, in order to 
grasp the teaching dynamic of the Analects.
In my History 150 introductory seminar (“Confucius and the World”), I assign 
six different translations of the Analects. One of the most important skills that 
anyone can learn when confronting great books is to read them again and 
again. It is just not possible, upon a first reading, to grasp connections that 
begin to appear clearly with subsequent readings. Only then does one have a 
sense of the whole—of where the story, or argument, is going.

Afterword  187
As a teacher, I have found it extraordinarily difficult to convince students to 
reread important texts. No amount of pleading or prodding seems to convince 
more than a handful to read, reread, and then read again. If you are devoted 
to careful study in your own life, it probably won’t be hard to convince you of 
the importance of repeated readings, but my students and I have discovered 
another, unexpected, positive that flows from reading a half-dozen different 
translations of the Analects. 
Not only does processing the material help to internalize it, but something 
else begins to happen, as well. As readers begin to internalize different ways 
to approach the material of the Analects, they begin to see patterns within 
and among the translations. Slowly, the teaching dynamic—the varied pace of 
insights throughout the text, like a class taught by a fine teacher—begins to 
emerge. Without forcing the issue, multiple readings of different translations 
open the text to new insights.
As you begin to cement your understanding, I recommend the following six 
translations. There will surely be more to follow in the coming years, and I am 
certainly not casting aspersions on ones I have not listed here. Spanning from 
the mid-20th century to the second decade of the 21st century, these books 
present a wide range of very good translations—each with different positives 
(and maybe an occasional negative; remember, translation is about choice).
I have included one translation that is somewhat dated, but it provides a useful 
contrast with the others. I have included the bibliographical notes for them 
here, so that you can get a glimpse of what each book has to offer. Through 
these books, you will gain a much deeper understanding of the Analects with 
the foundation provided by these lectures and a reading of these books. I have 
listed them here in chronological order, but you may choose to read them in 
any order you wish.

translation from an earlier interpretive era, Waley’s

he translated from Chinese and Japanese. Although some 
translations are dated, they all have a literary flair that is 
lacking in some more modern translations.

scholarship to the translation.

a discussion of the commentarial tradition below each 
translation. This is the place to go when readers are ready to 
learn more about the long tradition of Analects commentary 
(and one of the few places to gain a sense of it without 
learning classical Chinese).
[Annping Chin Translation]
The Analects (Lunyu). Translated with an introduction 
and commentary by Annping Chin. New York: Penguin 
Books, 2014. Annping Chin’s translation of the Analects 
pairs nicely with her biographical work, The Authentic 
Confucius. Reading them together is a useful exercise. Chin 
uses an influential commentary by Liu Baonan to shape 
her interpretations of challenging passages. In addition, she 
includes a very useful feature in which she discusses her 
translation of the text after most of the passages.

on the liveliness scale and is consistently fascinating in its 
interpretations of both central and more obscure terms. 
Michael Nylan’s introduction is masterful, and it is the work 
of one of the most distinguished scholars of ancient China of 
our time.
There is no rush for this reading. Take the process at your own speed, and think 
about connections as you proceed. In time, you may be drawn to even more 
translations from earlier eras, as well as those that are hot off the press. By the 
time you have both the foundation of these lectures and a firm grounding in 
multiple translations, you will know clearly which next steps you are drawn to. If 
you continue to learn more in this manner, make use of the bibliography for this 
lecture series and those of the translations you read. You will begin to see the 
names of texts that have influenced virtually every translator during the past half 
century, and you will begin to join the conversation, as we discussed in lecture 2.
 
By far the most important steps you can take are to grasp the foundations for 
studying Confucius’s Analects (the purpose of these lectures) and then to learn 
more about the text through deep comparative reading. In my classes, that is the 
foundation we lay first. From there, though, I teach ways to bring understanding 
to entirely new levels through concentrated, if not terribly time-consuming, 
activities. The first of these can be summed up as the second item on our list.
[2] Explore Language
Get yourself a notebook devoted to study of the Analects. 
Make a list of items in the Analects that you find most 
important. Now use as many dictionaries as you can to 
explore some of those concepts in the text, and build your 
own knowledge of the semantic fields surrounding them.

If you have a dictionary or two lying around, start there. Look up “filial” or 
“consummate” in the dictionary and work through the definitions. Go online 
and explore synonyms and antonyms, and consult other dictionaries. Jot down 
what you learn in your notebook; start a pattern of noticing and transcribing 
what you see. Do your translators use many different terms to translate a key 
idea into English (as they surely do with 仁 ren)? I require my students to start 
a separate notebook page for each key concept and to make spoke outlines of 
the semantic fields surrounding each word. For ideas such as 天 tian, there is 
usually not much on the page (which can provide a lesson in itself). For others, 
such as we’ve seen with 仁 ren, the page begins to fill quickly. If you continue 
to pursue this project—taking your time as you go, and using spare moments 
here and there—you will start to see the pages grow into a self-teaching tool 
that will expand your understanding.
Let’s go further, though. If you are familiar with other languages, I encourage 
you to explore the key terms or ideas of the Analects in those languages. For 
example, if you speak Spanish, think about some of the same ideas you have 
encountered in your study of Confucius’s Analects, and continue to build your 
semantic fields with Spanish—add them directly to the page you started with 
English terms; add new languages to your growing semantic fields.
 Again, you will begin to see a pattern emerge. Most languages have ideas 
similar to those that Confucius expressed (they were about getting good at 
life, after all, and people all over the world have sought to do just that). Still, it 
won’t be long before you sense that each language treats these ideas a little 
bit differently—and the distinctions you make will grow your understanding 
even further.
Whether or not you know other languages, you likely have experience with 
the way that people express themselves in different parts of the country, 
within various regions, and even within parts of the same community. Think 
about the same range of Confucian terms, and reflect upon ways that people 
express similar sentiments, such as the basic idea of 仁 ren, consummate 
conduct. Can you think of sayings that refer to being devoted to one’s 
parents? I was struck, recently by what one of my students from West Virginia 
said about a person he thought was acting with consummate conduct. 
Afterword  191

192  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
He told of what she had done, and then he added, “She’s good people.” 
Employing a regional phrase, he started in the singular and ended in the 
plural—and that is exactly the kind of phrase you need to write down in 
your notebook when you hear it. It grows your semantic field around the 
concept of 仁. The phrase the student used is about the social nature of 
individual effort—in consummate conduct. It is precisely in this manner that 
you will grasp that the language of the Analects is the language of living with 
others in society. It is everywhere.
 
With your notebook and the grounding that you have gained by thinking 
about language in the context of life, you are now ready for the next step that 
I require of my students. Almost as soon as they begin to consult dictionaries 
and think about language in their own lives, I teach them how anthropologists 
study language and culture. For example, when I am doing my fieldwork on 
Chinese pilgrimage mountains, I try to understand how language is used in 
the specific location of the mountains. For that, I bring my trusty notebook. 
When I hear something that sounds intriguing, such as “people from the front 
of the mountain and the back of the mountain can’t understand each other,” 
I jot it down immediately, even if I am not sure how I will use the information 
in the future. In short, I have learned something, and I make a note, just in 
case I can find a connection. In my Analects class, I ask my students to look for 
language in the world around them. Don’t just seek it in dictionaries; look for 
it in the world.
So let’s add a little field research to our growing list.
[3] Become a Language Fieldworker 
Become a fieldworker in the world of changing language. 
Language is not just in books—it is in life. Language is alive 
and moving. Find it, and write it down. Then think about 
it, and look for more.

One example I like to ponder is Confucius’s use of a very significant term in 
his thought (one that would persist in many traditions throughout Chinese 
history): 道 dao (sounds like “dow”). It is often translated as “road,” “path,” 
and, more generally, the “Way.” So I ask my students to think about paths, 
roads, and ways and then to look for them everywhere. And a funny thing 
happens when they take the intellectual concept of “path” and then start to 
see and even walk it in their worlds. At Beloit College, where I teach, there are 
sidewalks carefully designed to keep people walking along the path and not to 
trample the beautiful grass all around the campus. Yet my students, with their 
notebooks, start to notice all sorts of little shortcut paths through the grass—
shortcuts that the sidewalk designers didn’t anticipate. The flow of humanity 
just trampled right through the most carefully planned of layouts.
And then those students begin to think about the ways that shortcuts, paths, 
and ways work in the manner that we conduct our lives. They become 
anthropologists in the field of lived language, and their understanding of what 
Confucius and his followers were doing in the Analects goes even deeper.
 
By the time that my students have internalized their use of notebooks for the 
study of lived language from Confucius’s Analects, the rest begins to happen 
almost as a matter of course. Once they have gotten used to noticing that 
concepts such as 孝 xiao, 仁 ren, and others are everywhere around them, they 
can’t help but notice those ideas, even in their reading for seemingly unrelated 
classes (and they soon learn that everything is related). I have had students find 
the Analects in psychology and political science classes, in their reading of English 
literature, and, yes, even in physics, chemistry, biology, and the other natural 
sciences. So the next step will probably take care of itself. Here it is, though.
[4] Read Widely about Life
Read other books about life from a wide variety of 
traditions. These can vary from books about understanding 
what life is about (St. Augustine, Montaigne, Rousseau, 
Afterword  193

194  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Thoreau, and others) to books about how the world works 
(from the humanities and social sciences to the natural 
sciences). Read—and keep writing in your notebook.
Most cultural traditions have a long history of reflecting upon the meaning 
of life. Read some of those books (a few are listed in the item above). Don’t 
forget the many fine books about those writers and their works, too. What 
you are doing when you reach this level is a kind of syntopical reading that 
puts you in charge of defining and refining questions you want answered. Use 
books and life (always with your notebook) to gain your own kind of mastery 
of the material. In short, make it your own.
Literature can be very useful in this process. Shakespeare is unparalleled 
for raising complex problems of filiality or consummate conduct, but from 
Cervantes and Dostoevsky to Ann Beattie and Philip Roth, you will find 
material for your thinking with everything you read. And don’t slight the daily 
news—or even your social media feeds. Every single information source 
contains scores of potential teaching elements, from the strategies politicians 
employ to everyday stories of local heroes (and goats). The child who saves 
grandma from a burning kitchen has a story that parallels the greatest of 
Confucian tales. Likewise, the politician who caves to public opinion while 
another rival stands firm for principle sets up a thought experiment about 
Confucius’s contrast between exemplary people and petty people.
Books, news, the world around us—the Analects is alive, and it is everywhere. 
Make the Analects your own, and you will be on your way in just the way 
Confucius taught.
 
This brings us to the last item in our list. It is the culmination of the entire 
learning process, and it continues, on and on, the more you learn and the more 
you instruct.

[5] Teach It
Make it your own, and then teach others what you have 
learned. Once you have joined the conversation, keep 
learning and expanding. You can’t help but want to share 
what you have learned, and you should share it.
For my students, this step is at least ostensibly more formal than I am advising 
in this guidebook. My students have to give a public presentation and write a 
paper. In other words, all of the steps I have laid out above culminate in making 
their studies their own—in joining the conversation in a meaningful way. This 
work culminates in teaching it to others. In a classroom, presentations and 
written work are time-honored ways to teach others. But all of us follow these 
steps if we are committed enough. In presenting these lectures, writing these 
guidebook notes, and publishing essays about Confucius, I am taking what I 
know and trying to teach it to others. 
My students do it, too, and if you take these steps seriously and begin to join 
the conversation that Confucius and his students began 2,500 years ago, you 
will do the same thing. You will likely begin by telling people you know well and 
whom you trust to understand your initial steps at understanding. They will 
likely ask questions, and you then will do your best to articulate answers, or at 
least convey a way of grasping the interpretive challenges. And in doing all of 
that, you will have become a teacher, and you will have helped someone else 
begin to join the conversation, too.
 
Let’s take a last look at the complete list. Every item fits together, and the five 
items in the foreword work with these items to create, literally and figuratively, 
handfuls of ways to approach the difficult but rewarding text that is Confucius’s 
Analects.

196  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
[1] Read
Read half a dozen translations together. Your reading 
should be both comparative—reading passages that speak 
to you in all of the books—and cover to cover, in order to 
grasp the teaching dynamic of the Analects.
[2] Explore Language
Get yourself a notebook devoted to study of the Analects. 
Make a list of items in the Analects that you find most 
important. Now use as many dictionaries as you can to 
explore some of those concepts in the text, and build your 
own knowledge of the semantic fields surrounding them.
[3] Become a Language Fieldworker 
Become a fieldworker in the world of changing language. 
Language is not just in books—it is in life. Language is alive 
and moving. Find it, and write it down. Then think about 
it, and look for more.
[4] Read Widely about Life
Read other books about life from a wide variety of 
traditions. These can vary from books about understanding 
what life is about (St. Augustine, Montaigne, Rousseau, 
Thoreau, and others) to books about how the world works 
(from the humanities and social sciences to the natural 
sciences). Read—and keep writing in your notebook.

[5] Teach It
Make it your own, and then teach others what you have 
learned. Once you have joined the conversation, keep 
learning and expanding. You can’t help but want to share 
what you have learned, and you should share it.
As you proceed, you will surely find ways to tailor these ideas to your own 
ways of learning. It is a guide to a process that combines what Confucius taught 
with 2,500 years of learning that followed. And if you pursue it, Confucius 
knows exactly what to call you—a teacher.
2.11
The Master said, “Always reviewing past knowledge and 
yet continually learning about present conditions—such a 
person can truly be called a teacher.”1

about the Analects. Just look for the prominent “Confucius’s Analects” location on the 
Round and Square home page, and you will be led to examples of each of the 10 items 
covered in the foreword and afterword of this guidebook. There you will find sample 
spoke outlines of semantic fields, photographs that touch upon some of the text’s core 
concepts, stories about Confucius and his followers, my own ongoing translation of the 
Analects, and information about the Confucian tradition within and beyond China.

was a practicing historian and philosopher who has much to teach students of 
Chinese history, despite the fact that he focuses almost entirely on the West. 
His treatment of thinking through the past has stirred debate since its original 
publication in the 1940s.
Confucius. The Analects (Lun yü). Translated with an introduction by D. C. Lau. 
London: Penguin Books, 1979. D.C. Lau’s translation was the standard for 
more than three decades. He follows the Zhu Xi commentary closely when 
interpreting passages, which gives it even more of a foundational flair. Several 
generations of scholars living today got their introduction to Confucius from 
D.C. Lau’s work.
———. The Analects (Lunyu). Translated with an introduction and commentary 
by Annping Chin. New York: Penguin Books, 2014. Annping Chin’s translation 
of the Analects pairs nicely with her biographical work, The Authentic Confucius. 
Reading them together is a useful exercise. Chin uses an influential commentary 
by Liu Baonan to shape her interpretations of challenging passages. In addition, 
she includes a very useful feature in which she discusses her translation of the 
text after most of the passages.
———. The Analects of Confucius. Translated and annotated by Arthur Waley. 
New York: Vintage Books, 1938. A classic translation from an earlier interpretive 
era, Waley’s translation fits nicely with a phenomenal array of texts that he 
translated from Chinese and Japanese. Although some translations are dated, 
they all have a literary flair that is lacking in some more modern translations.

introduction is masterful, and it is the work of one of the most distinguished 
scholars of ancient China of our time.
———. Confucius Analects: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries. 
Translated by Edward Slingerland. Indianapolis, IN: Hacket Publishing, 2003. 
Edward Slingerland has provided a valuable service to readers by translating 
the Analects in thorough fashion and including a discussion of the commentarial 
tradition below each translation. This is the place to go when readers are ready 
to learn more about the long tradition of Analects commentary (and one of 
the few places to gain a sense of it without learning classical Chinese).
———. The Original Analects: Sayings of Confucius and His Successors. Translated 
with commentary by E. Bruce Brooks and A. Taeko Brooks. New York: 
Columbia University Press, 1998. The translation that the Brookses provide is 
valuable in itself. Their research on the dating of the texts sections, however, 
is invaluable. They help readers understand the various ages of the Analects’ 
various sections and show that first doesn’t always mean earliest.
Covey, Stephen R. The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People: Restoring the 
Character Ethic. New York: A Fireside Book, 1990. Covey was a thoroughly 
Confucian thinker without necessarily even knowing it. His chapter titled 
“Sharpen the Saw” provides a very useful way of thinking about Confucian 
ideas of repair, maintenance, and daily self-reflection.
Creel, Herrlee Glessner, ed. Literary Chinese by the Inductive Method. Vol. 1. The 
Hsiao Ching, revised and enlarged edition. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago 
Press, 1979. One of the first full-time academics in the United States who 
focused on Chinese studies, Herrlee Creel wrote a wide array of analytical and 
language study books. His inductive method for learning classic Chinese works 
is innovative, and it is as useful today as when he first used it in classes in the 
1930s and 1940s.
———, ed. Literary Chinese by the Inductive Method. Vol. 2. Selections from the

by Glen W. Baxter. Vol. 1. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965. A 
superb and comprehensive translation of a small portion of Sima Guang’s 
Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Ruling. Not only does Fang translate the text of 
the Comprehensive Mirror, he also translates the texts from which Sima Guang 
and his aides drew their material. 
Fingarette, Herbert. Confucius: The Secular as Sacred. New York: Harper 
Torchbooks, 1972. This slender volume has had an enormous impact on 
Western studies of Confucius’s Analects. Fingarette argues that readers who 
only see staid officiousness in Analects passages miss the point. Instead, the 
Analects articulates an almost magical command of social and ritual life that 
speaks to readers even today.
Frye, Northrop. The Great Code: The Bible and Literature. New York: A Harvest/
HBJ Book, 1982. The great literary critic Northrop Frye’s first study of the Bible 
speaks to a challenge that readers of Confucius’s Analects also face—to grasp 
its messages, it is necessary to read it straight through, from beginning to end, 
and possess it as a totality, no matter how difficult that might be.
Fung, Yu-lan. The Period of Philosophers. Vol. 1 of A History of Chinese Philosophy. 
Translated by Derk Bodde. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952. 
Fung’s history of Chinese philosophy is thorough and still useful more than 
six decades after its publication. The first volume treats the classical period of 
Chinese philosophy dealt with in most of these lectures.

The second volume of Fung’s work treats the development of the Confucian 
tradition along with other forms of thought that saw prominence during the 
imperial era.
Gardner, Daniel K. Confucianism: A Very Short Introduction. New York: Oxford 
University Press, 2014. One of the most useful brief introductions to 
Confucianism available. 
———, trans. The Four Books: The Basic Teachings of the Later Confucian Tradition. 
Indianapolis, IN: Hacket Publishing, 2007. Gardner’s overview of the Four Books 
is a very useful introduction to the foundational classics that formed the basis 
of all study for examinations in the late imperial period.
———. Zhu Xi’s Reading of the Analects: Canon, Commentary, and the Classical 
Tradition. New York: Columbia University Press, 2003. Written by a scholar 
whose scholarly work has focused upon Zhu Xi, this book shows the ways in 
which Zhu Xi articulated an innovative approach to the Analects and shaped 
late-imperial education.
Gardner, John. On Becoming a Novelist. Foreword by Raymond Carver. New 
York: Harper & Row, 1983. Gardner describes a way of writing fiction that 
focuses upon setting the reader in a dream world of sorts; only clumsy writing 
breaks the dream. A parallel can be drawn to ritual conduct in Confucius’s 
Analects; only clumsy practitioners break the dream of flowing, even 
spontaneous, ritual conduct.
Goldin, Paul R. Confucianism. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011. 
Another solid overview of the Confucian tradition, from the world of the 
Analects through the development of Neo-Confucian doctrines and into the 
present.
Graham, A. C. Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China. La 
Salle, IL: Open Court, 1989. A valuable study of the manner in which thinkers 
contended with one another during the Warring States period (475–221 
B.C.E.). Readers will never again be lulled into thinking of early philosophers 
as speaking in relative vacuums during the era. Instead, they engaged with one

another in many ways and vied for ascendancy in thought even as rulers of 
their time vied with one another for power.
———. Two Chinese Philosophers: The Metaphysics of the Brothers Ch’êng. La 
Salle, IL: Open Court, 1992. A fine study of the philosophical work undertaken 
by Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi of the Northern Song period. The Cheng 
brothers created a foundation for the thought of Zhu Xi and later thinkers.
Granet, Marcel. Chinese Civilization. Translated by Kathleen E. Innes and Mabel R. 
Brailsford. Cleveland, OH: Meridian Books, 1964. One of Granet’s masterworks, 
Chinese Civilization was originally published in 1929. It provides an innovative 
Durkheimian analysis of Chinese social life that is as memorable as it is astute.
———. The Religion of the Chinese People. Translated, edited and with an 
introduction by Maurice Freedman. New York: Harper & Row, 1975. Granet’s 
1922 introduction to Chinese religion is lively and surprising to certain kinds 
of objectivist readers. Granet combines a thorough knowledge of Chinese 
classical texts with a French literary flair that the translator, Maurice Freedman, 
calls “genius.”
Hall, David L., and Roger T. Ames. Thinking Through Confucius. Albany: State 
University of New York Press, 1987. One of a series of collaborative works 
by David Hall and Roger Ames, Thinking Through Confucius provides readers 
with an approach to the Analects that is thoroughly philosophical and deals 
with larger questions of interest to students of both the Chinese tradition and 
comparative philosophy.
Henricks, Robert G., trans. Lao-Tzu: Te-Tao Ching: A New Translation Based On the 
Recently Discovered Ma-Wang-Tui Texts. New York: Ballantine Books, 1989. An 
introduction to and translation of the Mawangdui archaeological discover that 
has deeply influenced our knowledge of early Chinese culture and the texts 
that were written in the pre-imperial period.
Hutton, Eric L., trans. Xunzi: The Complete Text. Princeton, NJ: Princeton

most elegant writers in early China. Xunzi’s 32 essays are some of the finest

literary gems ever written, and they provide a fascinating set of agreements 
and counterpoints to the thinking of Confucius and Mencius.
Inoue Yasushi. Confucius: A Novel. Translated by Roger K. Thomas. London: 
Peter Owen Publishers, 1992. An extraordinary novel by a well-known 
Japanese novelist, this book is (in the best tradition of Japanese historical 
fiction) thoroughly researched and founded on strong historiographical 
foundations. Inoue tells a story of Confucius’s profound influence through the 
eyes of a fictional follower who became enraptured by Confucius’s bearing 
and influence. It goes into substantial philosophical depth with text passages 
from the Analects, and it gives a thorough (fiction mixed with text passages) 
introduction to three of Confucius’s closest followers. 
Ivanhoe, Philip J. Confucian Moral Self Cultivation. 2nd ed. Indianapolis, IN: Hacket 
Publishing, 2000. Ivanhoe’s text speaks to the necessity of maintenance in the 
Confucian tradition and the increasing emphasis on moral self-cultivation in 
Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought through the centuries.
Ji, Xiao-bin. Politics and Conservatism in Northern Song China: The Career and 
Thought of Sima Guang (A.D. 1019–1086). Hong Kong: The Chinese University 
Press, 2005. A book-length study of Sima Guang’s life, politics, and historiography. 
A good place to learn more about one of the giants of the Confucian tradition.
Knapp, Keith Nathaniel. Selfless Offspring: Filial Children and Social Order in 
Medieval China. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2005. A good treatment of 
the concept of filiality and its role in teaching values of harmony and social order 
in a period that saw changing approaches to core concepts from the Analects.
Knoblock, John. Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete Works. Vol. 
1, Books 1–6. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1988. Thoroughly 
researched and annotated, Knoblock’s study of Xunzi’s writings is a valuable 
tool for the reader who has already become acquainted with the Confucian 
tradition and Xunzi’s role within it.

for ambitious general readers who wish to understand how specialized 
research can be brought to bear upon a general introduction to Chinese life. 
Lau, D. C., trans. Mencius. London: Penguin Books, 1970. Fewer translations of 
the Mencius are available than for Confucius’s Analects. Lau’s work remains a 
standard.
Lee, Peter H., ed. Sourcebook of Korean Civilization, Vol. 2: From the Seventh 
Century to the Modern Period. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. 
In the best tradition of the Columbia sourcebooks, Peter Lee’s collection of 
historical documents from Korean history provide a wonderful treatment of a 
fascinating civilization that, while influenced profoundly by Confucian thought, 
developed in its own ways, as well.

———, trans. The Ch’un Ts’ew with The Tso Chuen. Vol. 5 of The Chinese Classics. 
Taipei: SMC Publishing, 1991. James Legge’s translations of the Chinese classics 
have been as influential as any in the Western tradition. Although dated in 
many ways, no one has attempted anything as comprehensive as translating 
a full array of classical texts. For those interested in historical perspectives, 
Legge’s translations are invaluable; they shaped English translations for many 
decades and continue to influence them even today.
Lévi-Strauss, Claude. Les Structures Élémentaries de la Parenté. Paris: Mouton & 
Co., 1967. 
———. The Elementary Structures of Kinship, Rev. ed. Translated by James Harle 
Bell, John Richard von Sturmer, and Rodney Needham, ed. Boston, MA: Beacon 
Press, 1969. Claude Lévi-Strauss’s elaborate study of kinship contains a gemlike 
early chapter dealing with reciprocity in which (building upon the work of Emile 
Durkheim, Marcel Granet, and Marcel Mauss) he describes how pouring wine 
for one another in a French restaurant creates a special kind of social dynamic.
Luo, Guanzhong. Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel. Translated with an 
afterword and notes by Moss Roberts. Berkeley: University of California Press, 
1991. A comprehensive translation of one of the great novels of the Chinese 
tradition. This novel contains the story of Matron Xu and her son, who was 
drawn to be with her out of misplaced feelings about filial conduct.
Magee, Bryan. Confessions of a Philosopher: A Journey through Western Philosophy. 
New York: Random House, 1997. One of the best introductions to thinking 
philosophically (and thinking about philosophy) for general readers, Magee 
describes in a rich personal narrative how some of the great thinkers of the 
Western tradition were thoroughly engaged with the big questions about life 
and thought. He complains memorably that the profession of philosophy has 
become just a fragment of those big thoughts, and he argues for a return to a 
rich kind of philosophical inquiry.
Major, John S. Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought: Chapters Three, Four, and 
Five of the Huainanzi. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. A fine, 
scholarly study of a major text from China’s long-lived second dynasty, the 

Bibliography  209
Han (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.). In the Huainanzi, among other texts of the period, 
we can see the development of correlative cosmology and the five phases 
principles that helped to fuel a new kind of Imperial Confucianism.
Makeham, John. Transmitters and Creators: Chinese Commentators and 
Commentaries on the Analects. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, 
2003. Although written for specialists, this book is accessible to the reader who 
has learned about the core principles of Confucian thought (as taught in these 
lectures). Makeham analyzes four key commentaries and provides a thorough 
treatment of the important role of the commentarial tradition in Confucian 
studies.
Mann, Susan, and Yu-Yin Cheng, eds. Under Confucian Eyes: Writings on Gender 
in Chinese History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001. An invaluable 
collection of essays, Under Confucian Eyes opens a necessary set of discussions 
about gender in a Confucian tradition that is deeply relevant to changing 
perspectives on Confucian thought today.
McPhee, John. The John McPhee Reader. Edited by William L. Howarth. New 
York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1991. William Howarth’s introduction to John 
McPhee’s working techniques is an exhilirating treatment of a literary master 
at work. McPhee’s approach to reporting provides a valuable perspective on 
how one must continue to learn in a Confucian ritual tradition.
Mead, George Herbert. The Individual and the Social Self: Unpublished Work of 
George Herbert Mead. Edited with an introduction by David L. Miller. Chicago, 
IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1982. 
———. Mind, Self, and Society: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist. Edited 
by Charles W. Morris. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1967. 
Among 20th-century social thinkers, few are more valuable in a serious study of 
interrelational dynamics and social life than George Herbert Mead. A side-by-
side reading of Mead and Confucius is one of the most fascinating exercises a 
serious reader can undertake.

210  Books That Matter: The Analects of Confucius
Mills, C. Wright. The Sociological Imagination. New York: Oxford University 
Press, 2000. Mills’s work forcefully articulates an all-in approach to serious 
social inquiry that parallels the approach of Confucius in the Analects. The 
work remains, more than half a century after its original publication in 1959, 
one of the best examples of living one’s study rather than just engaging in a 
course of study.
Miyazaki Ichisada. China’s Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of 
Imperial China. Translated by Conrad Schirokauer. New Haven, CT: Yale University

path to examination success and failure in the late imperial period in China.
Mote, Frederick W. Intellectual Foundations of China. 2nd ed. New York:
