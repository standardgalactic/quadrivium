About the Author
While some people get revved up at car races and others ride the wild waves of
the stock market, Cecie Kraynak gets her jollies traveling to Spanish-speaking
countries, chatting it up with complete strangers, and haggling with the local 
merchants. 
Cecie inherited her love of Spanish language and culture from her mother, Jo Anne
Howard, also a Spanish major, who cultivated Cecie’s innate interest and encour-
aged her to travel and study abroad. From the heartland of Crawfordsville, Indiana,
Cecie first set out to study at the University of the Americas in Cholua, Mexico,
and later spent her junior year abroad at the Universidad Complutense in Madrid,
Spain. She earned her Bachelor’s degree in Spanish and secondary education in
1980 from Purdue University, and also received her Master’s degree in Spanish 
literature from Purdue. During her grad school years, Cecie taught Spanish to
undergraduates and served as the graduate assistant for Purdue’s summer study
program in Mexico City.
After graduating in 1983, Cecie began what was to become a 20-year career teach-
ing Spanish to junior high and high school students. She continues to teach and
travel and has served as a consultant on several Spanish learning guides, includ-
ing Teach Yourself Spanish in 24 Hours (MacMillan) and Spanish for Healthcare
Professionals (Barron’s).


Dedication
To Joe, without whom this book would never have made it to press; to my mother,
who shared her love of Spanish with me in the first place; and to my high school
Spanish teacher, Marilyn Britton, who gave me such a fantastic foundation in
Spanish grammar and usage.

Spanish Verbs For Dummies 

Introduction
V
erbs seem simple enough, right? They’re action words. They describe what’s happen-
ing, what happened, or what will happen. In practice, however, they become a little
more complicated. They change depending on the time the action occurred, the being or
number of beings performing the action, the likelihood that an action or condition can
occur, and whether the action is a statement, question, or command.
In your native language, you automatically select the correct verb form without thinking
twice about it, but when you’re picking up a new language, you need to ﬁgure out how to
conjugate the different verb types so that they agree with the subject of the sentence — I;
you (singular); he, she, or it; we; you (plural); or they — and express the action in the right
tense — past, present, or future, just to name a few. I’d name them all right here, but
Spanish has a total of 14 tenses. And if that isn’t enough to drive you batty, some Spanish
verb stems even change their spellings.
Yep, Spanish verbs are pretty much out to get you. Fortunately, Spanish Verbs For Dummies
is here to help you survive the onslaught and make sense of the confusing rules and regula-
tions and to drill you on the most common exceptions. Each chapter is packed with exam-
ples, conjugation charts, and plenty of exercises to drive the point home.
This book is your opportunity to prove to yourself that you’ve mastered Spanish verbs and
can use them in a sentence. With Spanish Verbs For Dummies, a little practice reading conju-
gation charts, and a pencil or pen, you’re well-prepared to tackle even the most irregular
verbs in the Spanish language.
About This Book
Spanish Verbs For Dummies is a refresher course, reference book, and workbook all rolled
into one and seasoned with just a dash of humor. Each chapter addresses a tense by show-
ing you how to form it (in Spanish, of course), illustrates how to use the tense in context,
and then tests your mettle with exercises that help you determine whether you’ve mastered
the lesson.
Most of the exercises you meet along the way are true/false questions or actual translations.
I could’ve thrown in some multiple choice or matching exercises, but in Spanish, you typi-
cally ﬁnd out very little from such activities, so I decided to stick with something a little
more challenging.
One nice thing about this workbook and other For Dummies books is that you can choose to
work all the way through the book from Chapter 1 to the very end, or you can skip around
however you like. If you’ve already mastered a particular tense, for example, you don’t have
to spend time reviewing it and scribbling answers in the book. That way, you can devote
more time to the conjugations that are most perplexing. Dive in wherever you want, and if
you need to swim back to shore, that’s ﬁne, too.

Spanish Verbs For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
I used several conventions in this book to present the information in a consistent format. As
you work through the book, you may bump into the following items:
 Conjugation boxes: As you begin to use this book, you will no doubt notice that I
chose a rather conventional method to introduce the different verb conjugations. I use
what I refer to as the conjugation box, which looks like this:
pedir (e-i) = to ask for
yo pido
nosotros/as pedimos
tú pides
vosotros/as pedís
él, ella pide
ellos/as piden
Ud.  
Uds. 
This handy little tool acts like a mental billboard. It displays the Spanish verb, its
English meaning, and then conjugates the verb, presenting the three singular conjuga-
tions in the left column and the three plural conjugations in the right column.
 Vocabulary chart: Vocabulary charts provide a quick rundown of common words or
expressions typically providing the Spanish word in the left column with its English
equivalent in the right column. In some cases, the charts contain additional columns to
illustrate different forms, such as a present participle.
 Instructions for practice activities: I include instructions for each set of practice activi-
ties. The instructions are intended to be short and sweet, so you can quickly proceed
to the task at hand.
 Answer keys: At the end of each chapter is an Answer Key that provides the correct
answers to all practice activities within the chapter. In some cases where you answer
cierto (true) or falso (false), I simply provide a translation of the statements in ques-
tion, because technically no answer is right or wrong.
You’re likely to spot the following abbreviations, as well. Don’t let them throw you off
course.
 sing. (singular)
 pl. (plural)
 m. or masc. (masculine)
 f. or fem. (feminine)
Each chapter of this book begins with a concise explanation of the topic at hand — typically
a speciﬁc Spanish verb tense conjugation, just in case you need a brief refresher. However,
this book assumes that you’ve already had some exposure to the topic, either in a class or
in another book, such as Spanish For Dummies by Susan Wald and the Language Experts at
Berlitz (Wiley Publishing).
After the brief review of the verb tense and a few pertinent examples, each chapter follows
up with practice opportunities to reinforce what you discovered.

Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I made the following foolish assumptions about you:
 You already have a background in Spanish, have learned all of the verb tenses, and are
looking for an opportunity to review and practice that knowledge. If you’re a rank
beginner, Spanish For Dummies is a great place to start.
 You’ve taken at least two years of Spanish or the equivalent.
 You’re boning up on Spanish verbs for your own ediﬁcation or your son, daughter,
grandson, granddaughter, niece, nephew, or special someone is taking their second or
third year of Spanish, and you want to help, but you haven’t looked at a verb conjuga-
tion for years.
 You love Spanish (like me!), and you actually enjoy conjugating verbs. . . . Okay, so that
may be pushing it just a little.
How This Book is Organized
All books in the For Dummies series are divided into parts so that you can zero in on your
topic of preference and quickly skip anything that looks boring or inconsequential. The
chapters in Spanish Verbs For Dummies fall into the following seven parts.
Unlike most other Spanish verb books on the market, which group lessons according to
tense, Spanish Verbs For Dummies starts with the easier verb forms and progresses to the
more complex. I think this approach makes the topic a little less intimidating and much
more accessible for most beginning learners, but feel free to skip around. Use the following
part descriptions as your road map.
Part I: Presenting the Present Tense
The present is the culmination of the past and the springboard to the future, making it the
perfect place to begin any discussion of Spanish verbs. This part introduces Spanish verbs,
provides plenty of practice with regular verbs in the present tense, shows you how to
phrase commands and questions, and then leaves you coming and going with the verbs
venir and ir. In this part, I promise not to dig up anything from the past or mention con-
cerns about the future.
Part II: Exploring Some Exceptional Exceptions
Every language rule has its exceptions, and the rules covering Spanish verbs are no excep-
tions. The chapters in this part help you deal with Spanish verbs that don’t know how to
behave. You ﬁgure out how to express your likes and dislikes with the verb gustar, differen-
tiate between being and being with the verbs ser and estar, cope with the peculiarities of
stem-changing and spelling-changing verbs, and deal with a handful of other Spanish verb
oddities.

Introduction

Part III: Working Out with the 
Remaining Simple Tenses
Although everyone lives in the present, you constantly look back at the past and forward to
the future, so you need a way to describe actions that happen at different times. The chapters
in this part show you how to form the six remaining simple tenses: preterit, imperfect, future,
conditional, subjunctive (mood), and imperfect subjunctive. This part focuses on regular
verbs, so you don’t have to worry about the nasty exceptions. Those are covered in Part IV.
Part IV: Coping with Irregular Verbs
Mastering the rules and regulations that govern the conjugation of Spanish verbs can take
you only so far. Eventually, you need to ﬁnd out how to conjugate the irregular verbs — the
verbs that break the rules. The chapters in this part show you how to conjugate the most
common irregular verbs in the seven simple tenses and provide plenty of practice activities
to help tattoo the conjugation charts onto your gray matter.
Part V: Getting Help with the Helping Verb Haber
When it comes to Spanish verbs, even Spanish verbs can use a little help. Through the use
of the verb haber you can transform the seven simple tenses into seven compound tenses
to describe actions that generally happened before other actions. Sound confusing? Well,
you’re right; it’s confusing. But the chapters in this part make the concept crystal clear and
provide hands-on examples and exercises that can make it seem like second nature.
Part VI: Part of Tens 
No For Dummies book would be complete without a Part of Tens to provide you with some
quick tips and a couple handfuls of useful tidbits you can immediately put to good use.
Spanish Verbs for Dummies provides three chapters of 10 items each — 30 in all! Here you
pick up 10 Spanish idioms, 10 verbs for holidays and other special occasions, and the 10
most frequently asked questions in Spanish (and their replies). I was going to include 10
Spanish curses, but my editor censored the chapter.
Part VII: Appendixes
Throughout this book, you may come across exercises that include some unfamiliar words,
so I stuck a few appendixes at the back of the book for quick reference. As you can quickly
see by scanning them, they are in no way intended as comprehensive references. If you
want a thorough reference, you can purchase any of several Spanish dictionaries or special-
ized Spanish verb references. I included a brief English/Spanish and Spanish/English 
glossary to help you with the vocabulary that you may not know and a list of common 
irregular verb conjugations.

Icons Used in This Book
Every For Dummies book has a generous collection of notes, tips, warnings, and other
essential and entertaining insights spattered across its pages, and this book is no different.
To prevent you from inadvertently overlooking some particularly valuable piece of advice, I
ﬂagged each of these golden nuggets of knowledge with one of the following icons.
Example icons pop up wherever it’s best for me to show you, rather than tell you how to form
or use a particular verb conjugation. Before you begin an exercise, check out the Example
icons to see how it’s done.
Tip icons appear to cue you in on a time-saving suggestion or shortcut. If I know an easier
way to perform a particular task or remember a tough-to-grasp concept or conjugation, I
share it with you by way of these tips.
Remember icons are there to poke you in the ribs so you make sure to commit to memory
an important tidbit of information. The points marked with these icons can usually make
your life a little easier.
Practice icons ﬂag the beginning of a practice exercise. In some cases, you may want to skip
ahead to the practice exercise to test your knowledge before you read my explanation of it. If
you can complete the exercise correctly on your own, you may not need the brief refresher
course. If you get fewer than eight out of ten answers correct, though, you may need to
review.
Where to Go from Here
So much for the preliminaries. Now it’s time to dive right in to the sea of Spanish verbs and
immerse yourself in its 14 tenses and a never-ending stream of conjugation charts, rules,
and exceptions.
The most important advice I can give you before you start your journey is to take a fearless,
conﬁdent approach when checking out any topic, especially a second or third or fourth 
language. You didn’t learn your ﬁrst language without making countless mistakes, and you
certainly won’t learn your next language without a few trips and stumbles. The only people
who don’t make it are the students who quit. Stick with it, make bold mistakes, and if you’re
committed to communicating with someone in Spanish, you’ll eventually get it.
And don’t forget — if you haven’t already read Spanish For Dummies, be sure to pick up a
copy and start practicing some conversational Spanish. Spanish For Dummies shows you
the bare-bones basics and then provides chapter after chapter showing you how to use
your Spanish in the real Spanish-speaking world.

Part I
Presenting the 
Present Tense

In this part . . .
T
he present is a pivotal point — the culmination of the
past and the springboard to the future. As such, the
present is a good place to start when studying verbs in
any language and a great place to begin brushing up on
the basics.
In this part, I introduce you to Spanish verbs, the subject
pronouns that commonly accompany them, and the four
main verb types. You get to warm up with some regular
verbs in the present tense, modify actions with adverbs,
build sentences, and figure out how to speak in the pas-
sive voice (for those rare occasions when you want to
remove yourself from what you have to say). You also
encounter some special constructions including com-
mands, yes/no questions, and interrogatives.

 Getting subject pronouns involved in the action
 Identifying the four main verb types
B
efore you immerse yourself in any heavy-duty verb conjugations, take some time to
brush up on the basics so you can effectively communicate using the various verb
types. You need to understand
 What a verb is
 What the basic verb types are
 What sorts of subject pronouns you can use to describe the being performing the
action
 What a conjugation chart is
This chapter eases you into the subject of Spanish verbs by deﬁning verbs and showing you
how to classify them. You discover how to identify the parts of a verb, the subject pronouns
that identify the person or thing performing the action, and the four different types of verbs
you may meet on the street. The exercises in this chapter give you a solid framework on
which to build your newfound skills.
Recognizing the Four Main Verb Types
Spanish verbs hang out in their own cliques, and each group has its own way of doing
things. If you’re going to have any success dealing with Spanish verbs, you’d better be able
to identify which of the four following groups a verb belongs to:
 Regular verbs: These verbs are easy to get along with because they follow the regular
conjugation rules for -ar, -er, and -ir verbs. You’ll like these guys (see the next section
and Chapter 2).
 Stem-changing verbs: These verbs morph depending on how you use them in a sen-
tence. You’ll encounter three types of stem-changing verbs, classiﬁed according to
their stem changes: e to i, e to ie, and o to ue (see Chapter 8).
 Spelling-change verbs: Consonant spelling changes occur in some of the conjugated
forms of these verbs. The changes enable the verbs to comply with pronunciation rules
of the particular letters. The affected consonants are c, g, and z (see Chapter 8)

10
Part I: Presenting the Present Tense 
 Reﬂexive verbs: Whenever you do something to yourself, you use a reﬂexive verb to
express the fact that the action is performed or “reﬂected back” on you, the subject of
the sentence. Reﬂexive verbs are accompanied by reﬂexive pronouns, like herself or
themselves; for example, “Barry poked himself in the eye.” The reﬂexive pronoun has to
agree with the subject of the sentence and follow the placement rules for all object pro-
nouns, the pronouns that receive the action (see Chapter 3).
Getting the Lowdown on Regular Spanish Verbs
Verbs are action words. They’re the movers and the shakers of the world. They describe the
action that is taking place, has taken place, or will take place. They command, they question,
they conjecture, and they describe states of being. No sentence is complete without one.
A raw verb is expressed as an inﬁnitive. In English, that means the to form — “to eat,” for
example. Nobody’s doing the eating, and the eating is not being done at any speciﬁc time or
in any speciﬁc way, and nobody’s really eating anything. An inﬁnitive is an action, pure and
simple.
In Spanish, you have no to to rely on. Spanish expresses the inﬁnitive form of its verbs
through verb endings: -ar, -er, and -ir. For example, hablar (to speak),comer (to eat), and
vivir (to live). All Spanish verbs use one of these three endings. When you chop off the -ar,
-er, or -ir endings, the remaining letters make up the verb stem.
Below are some regular Spanish verbs. Determine each verb’s stem and classify it as an -ar,
-er, or -ir verb, as I show you in the following example:
hablar = habl, - ar
1.
vivir = _______________, - _____
2.
comer = _______________ , - _____
3.
abrir = _______________ , - _____
4.
presentar = _______________ , - _____
5.
mirar = _______________ , - _____
6.
astar = _______________ , - _____
7.
escribir = _______________ , - _____
8.
leer = _______________ , - _____
9.
romper = _______________ , - _____
10.
suprimir = _______________ , - _____
Meeting Subject Pronouns Face to Face
I, we, you, he, she, it, and they are the English subject pronouns. They tell the verb who or
what is performing the action, and they dictate the form of the verb you must use. In
English, he shops, but they shop.

Spanish uses nine subject pronouns: (yo, tú, usted, él, ella, nosotros or nosotras, vosotros
or vosotras, ustedes, and ellos or ellas). The subject pronoun determines the conjugated
form of the verb. Just like in English, the Spanish inﬁnitive form of the verb means that no
one is doing the action, but the conjugated form signiﬁes that some individual or group is
performing the action. Whenever you conjugate a verb, you set up a chart, like the one that
follows, and ﬁll in each subject pronoun’s accompanying verb form.
Spanish Subject Pronouns
yo = I
nosotros = we (mixed or male group)
nosotras = we (female group)
tú = you (familiar)
vosotros you (familiar, mixed or male group)
vosotras = you (familiar, female group)
él = he
ellos = they (mixed or male group)
ella = she
ellas = female group
usted (Ud.) = you (formal)
ustedes (Uds.) you (formal)
Although usted is usually abbreviated to Ud. when written, you still pronounce it usted.
Likewise, although ustedes is usually abbreviated to Uds. when written, you still pronounce
it ustedes.
The vosotros form (you plural, familiar) is used almost exclusively in Spain. In its place,
other countries use the Uds. form of the verb. Also, keep in mind that in English, only one
you is used for all four of the Spanish you’s (although sometimes for the plural you, you may
say “you guys” if you’re from the North or “y’all” if you’re from the South — so in that way
English-speakers sort of create a plural you).
Select the correct Spanish subject pronoun to replace the following names or nouns.
(Unless speciﬁed, the familiar you is the singular form.) Here’s an example:
Jim = él
11.
my friends (mixed or male group) = _______________
12.
the students (mixed or male group) = _______________ 
13.
she = _______________ 
14.
you (familiar) = _______________ 
15.
my parents = _______________ 
16.
my best friend (male) = _______________ 
17.
Bob and Tom = _______________ 
18.
her dad = _______________ 
19.
Susan = _______________ 
20.
George and I = _______________

Chapter 2
Warming Up with Regular Verbs
in the Present Tense
In This Chapter
 Loosening up with present tense -ar, -er, and -ir verb conjugations
 Speaking in complete sentences
 Adding character to your verbs with adverbs
 Discovering the personal a and the passive voice
M
ost verbs are fairly well-behaved. They follow the rules. They’re predictable, espe-
cially in the present tense, which makes them fairly easy to master. The regular
Spanish verbs come in three ﬂavors — -ar, -er, and -ir — and you won’t ﬁnd anything tricky
about conjugating them. Regular verbs, therefore, are a great place to start your warm-up
exercises with the present tense.
In this chapter, you work exclusively with the three regular verb forms in the present tense.
You ﬁnd out how to conjugate all three using the subject pronoun chart I introduce in
Chapter 1 — no exceptions, I promise. This chapter also provides a list of commonly used
regular -ar, -er, and -ir verbs, so you can get in some additional practice on your own.
To keep you from dozing off with the easy stuff, I’ve thrown in some adverbs so you can tell
people when particular actions or events are occurring. You also discover how to
 Build a sentence in Spanish, complete with subject and verb
 Use the personal a
 Avoid taking responsibility for your actions by using the passive voice — an essential
lesson for all budding politicians
Conjugating -ar Verbs
Conjugating regular -ar verbs is a snap. You take the inﬁnitive form of the verb, which ends
in -ar, chop off the -ar, and replace it with the ending for the appropriate subject pronouns:
I, you, he, she, we, or they. If you need to review subject pronouns and how they inﬂuence
verb conjugations, refer to Chapter 1. I’m going to present all verb conjugations in these
three-row, two-column boxes until you’re sick and tired of seeing them, so master the con-
cept of subject pronouns before you go any further.
The subject pronoun dictates the verb form that you use in a sentence. If you start a sen-
tence with I, for example, and you use an -ar verb, that verb must end in -o.

14
Part I: Presenting the Present Tense 
Regular present tense -ar verb endings:
yo -o
nosotros/as -amos
tú -as
vosotros/as -áis
él, ella -a
ellos/as -an
Ud.
Uds.
So the present-tense conjugations for a regular -ar verb such as hablar (to speak) are . . . 
hablar  = to speak
hablo
hablamos
hablas
habláis
habla
hablan
Yo hablo español. = I speak Spanish.
Now I bet you want a few more -ar verbs to play with, so Table 2-1 shows some commonly
used regular -ar verbs that you can throw around at your next dinner party.

Unlike in English, which keeps its verbs and prepositions separate, some verbs in the
Spanish language include a preposition (like to or at). Table 2-1 includes two such verbs:
escuchar and mirar. As a native English speaker, you may be tempted to toss in an extra
preposition. Avoid the temptation.
Translate the following subjects and verbs into Spanish. The subject pronoun guides you in
selecting the correct conjugation, and the verb must agree with the subject. In some cases
when you follow a subject with a conjugated verb, you create a simple sentence. For details
about creating sentences, refer to “Building a Sentence from the Ground Up” later in this
chapter.
The vosotros form isn’t used in this activity, so when you see you (plural) use the Uds. form.
Here’s an example, to get you started:
we celebrate = nosotros celebramos
1.
I clean = _______________
2.

Chapter 2: Warming Up with Regular Verbs in the Present Tense

Conjugating -er Verbs
The -ar verbs set the pattern for all the regular verbs, including the -er and -ir verbs. To con-
jugate -er verbs, you chop the -er off the end of the verb and add the appropriate verb end-
ings so that the verb agrees with its subject pronoun. If you can etch the following
conjugation chart on your gray matter, you’ll have everything you need to conjugate any -er
verb you may encounter.
Regular present tense -er verb endings:
yo -o
nosotros/as -emos
tú -es
vosotros/as -éis
él, ella -e
ellos/as -en
Ud.
Uds.
So the present-tense conjugations for a regular -er verb such as aprender (to understand)
are . . . 
aprender = to understand
aprendo
aprendemos
aprendes
aprendéis
aprende
aprenden
Nosotros aprendemos. = We understand.
Understanding is certainly necessary, but you don’t want to restrict all of your actions to
such a passive activity, so Table 2-2 gives you some additional -er verbs that are a little
more fun and interesting.

Conjugating -ir Verbs
The -ar and -er verbs make up the bulk of the regular verbs, but a small number of -ir verbs
round out the collection. You conjugate these verbs the same as the -er verbs, except for
the nosotros and the vosotros forms. The following conjugation chart shows just what I

Timing Your Actions with Adverbs
The tense is built right into the verb, but that isn’t always speciﬁc enough to describe pre-
cisely when an action is occurring in the present. Is it happening now, sometimes, always,
every Saturday? By tacking on an adverb, you can express time more precisely.
19
Chapter 2: Warming Up with Regular Verbs in the Present Tense

The present tense in Spanish conveys not only an ongoing present tense action, such as
“I’m talking on the phone,” but also an action that you’re in the habit of doing, such as “I
talk on the phone a lot.” Adverbs help you make those distinctions.
Table 2-4 gives a list of adverbs commonly used with the present tense:

Building a Sentence from the Ground Up
A subject and a verb are all you really need to create a bona ﬁde sentence: Yo canto (I sing).
That’s a sentence. In Spanish, you can even drop the subject when its meaning is under-
stood from the verb ending: Canto. Now that’s one short sentence.
Of course, if you walk around Spain or Mexico or some other Spanish-speaking country
expressing yourself in one-word sentences, you’ll come across as being a little odd. Most of
the time, you want to convey a little (or a lot) more information. You want to indicate when
something happened, why it happened, who was performing the action, and what the action
was being performed on.
When you have more to say, you can turn to some other parts of speech, such as the
adverbs I discuss in the preceding section. By putting a subject, verb, adverb, and some
other select words together, you can begin to express yourself in Spanish.
If you use two verbs together and the second one is in the inﬁnitive form, you don’t need
anything between them unless they’re a part of a verb structure, a commonly used phrase
that contains one or more verbs. For information about them, check out Chapter 3.

Getting Chummy with the Personal “a”
In Spanish, the preposition to is a. If you want to say “to the store,” for example, you say “a
la tienda.”
Spanish has a very important use for a that doesn’t even translate to English, and that’s the
personal a. Whenever the direct object of the verb is a person or a pet, the direct object
must be preceded by the Spanish personal a.
This rule is sometimes hard to remember because it has no English equivalent, but a few
examples can help drive home the point:
Ellos ayudan a los 
= They help the students a lot.
estudiantes mucho.
Los estudiantes escuchan 
= The students listen to the teacher.
a la profesora.
Yo ayudo a mi mamá en la 
= I help my mom in the kitchen every day.
cocina todos los días.
Él escucha la radio.
= He listens to the radio.
(Because the verb escuchar includes the preposition,
in the English translation to listen to, you omit the
preposition before the radio.)
Translate the following statements into Spanish. Some include the personal a, and some
don’t. Here’s an example:

Speaking of the Passive Voice . . .
When you want a lesson in using the passive voice, tune into a Washington press confer-
ence. During the press conference, you rarely hear about the person or persons responsible
for making a particular decision or performing a speciﬁc action. Instead, you hear passive
constructions like these:
 The decision was made last July.
 Action was taken to stem the violence.
 Authorities were called in to investigate.
 Funds were misappropriated.
23
Chapter 2: Warming Up with Regular Verbs in the Present Tense

With the passive voice, you never know who’s performing the action, which sometimes is
exactly how you want to present certain information, especially if you’re a scientist or a
politician. Following are some additional examples:
 No swimming is allowed after 10 p.m.
 No eating is allowed outside of the dining room.
 English and Spanish are spoken here.
 French is spoken in France.
In Spanish, you form the passive voice with se and either the third-person singular or the
third-person plural of the verb in question. The noun or nouns that follow the conjugated
verb determine whether the verb is singular or plural in form. In other words, a singular
noun is preceded by a verb in its singular form, and a plural noun or multiple nouns are pre-
ceded by a verb in its plural form.
The following list provides translations of the English statements in the preceding bulleted
list:
 No se permite nadar después de las 10 p.m.
 No se permite comer fuera del comedor.
 Se hablan inglés y español aquí.
 Se habla francés en Francia.

Constructing Commands
and Other Verb Structures
In This Chapter
 Barking out commands with the imperative mood
 Moving along with the present progressive
 Staring into the mirror with some reﬂexive verbs
 Exploring multiple uses for the verb tener
T
o order someone to carry out a task, you use the imperative mood. To express continu-
ing action in the present, you use the present progressive tense. To express an action
that acts upon the subject of the sentence, you use a reﬂexive verb. In Spanish, you can
build these and various other verb structures, and you can use the irregular verb tener (to
have) to say not only what you have, but what you have to do and what you feel like doing.
In this chapter, you ﬁnd out how to form these common verb structures, and you get a feel
for some of their nuances. After successfully completing the exercises in this chapter, you’ll
have the conﬁdence and know-how you need to use these verb structures competently in
writing and in your next conversation.
Taking Command with the Imperative Mood
When you tell a waiter to bring you water, ask a dinner guest to please pass the salt, or tell
your dog to lie down, you’re using the imperative mood. You’re giving a command — telling
someone, or sometimes yourself, to do something.
The imperative is called a mood, rather than a tense, because it deals with wants and
desires, and the time is always now.
In most cases, you bark out commands in the you form, but remember that in Spanish you
can mean any of four different you’s. With the imperative, you can also give what is called a
Let’s command, as in, “Let’s go to the movie.” This less assertive form of the imperative
takes the nosotros form. For more about the four Spanish forms of you and other subject
pronouns, see Chapter 1.
You can form positive tú commands by dropping the -s from the present tense tú forms of
regular -ar, -er, or -ir verbs:
hablas (you speak) becomes habla (speak)
comes (you eat) becomes come (eat)
escribes (you write) becomes escribe (write)

32
Part I: Presenting the Present Tense 
In Spanish exclamations and questions, the punctuation comes upside down at the begin-
ning of the phrase, as well as at the end.
You can form negative tú commands by taking the -o off of the present-tense yo form and
adding -es for regular -ar verbs and -as for regular -er and -ir verbs:
hablo (I speak) becomes no hables (don’t speak)
como (I eat) becomes no comas (don’t eat)
escribo (I write) becomes no escribas (don’t write)
Spanish also includes some irregular tú form commands. Table 3-1 shows the positive and
negative forms of the most common irregular tú form commands:
Table 3-1

decir = to say, tell

Forming the formal “you” singular command
When forming the formal you singular, or the usted (Ud.) commands in the positive and the
negative forms, you drop the -o ending of the yo form, and add an -e for -ar verbs or an -a for
-er and -ir verbs. Here are a few examples:
Hable. = Speak.
No hable. = Don’t speak.
Coma. =Eat.
No coma. =Don’t eat.
Escriba. = Write.
No escriba. = Don’t write.
Spanish has only the following three irregular usted commands:

the Ud. command form. This rule applies for the regular and irregular verbs, as shown in
the following examples:
Hablen. = Speak.
¡No coman! = Don’t eat!
Escriban. = Write.
¡No sean tontos! = Don’t be foolish!

Forming the informal “you” plural command
When forming the positive, informal, plural you or vosotros commands for regular verbs,
you drop the -r from the inﬁnitive form and add -d, as you can see in the following examples:
¡Hablad! = Speak!
Comed. = Eat.
Escribid. = Write.
When forming the negative vosotros commands, you simply drop the -o from the present-
tense yo form and add -éis for -ar verbs or -áis for -er and -ir verbs, as follows:
¡No habléis! = Don’t speak!
No comáis. = Don’t eat.
No escribáis. = Don’t write.
The same three verbs are irregular in the negative vosotros command forms as in the usted
forms. They are

Forming the “Let’s” command
The nosotros form commands, or the let’s commands, enable you to make suggestions to
your friends or to a group of people (including yourself) about what you want to do. When
forming these commands, take the -o off of the present-tense yo form of the verb and add 
-emos for -ar verbs or -amos for -er and -ir verbs. You simply put no in front of the verb to
make a negative let’s command. Some examples follow in Table 3-2:

Acting in the Now with the Present Progressive
You may think that if you’re doing something now, you have only one way of expressing that
action in the present tense. But, no, that would be far too easy. You can use the simple pres-
ent tense to describe a current action or an action that you perform on a regular basis, such
as “I wash dishes.” But you can also express the same present action as something that’s
taking place right now by using the present progressive.
You form the present progressive by taking the present tense of the verb estar (to be) and
the present participle or -ing form of the action verb. When you put these two together, you
have to be + doing. Whoever or whatever is performing the action determines the form of
estar — which happens to be irregular in the present tense — that you use. First of all, here
are the forms of estar:
estar = to be
estoy
estamos
estás
estáis
está
están
Yo estoy. = I am.
39
Chapter 3: Constructing Commands and Other Verb Structures

The second part of this structure consists of the present participle, or -ing form, of the
action verb, which you form by dropping the -ar off the inﬁnitive form of the verb and then
adding -ando. For -er and -ir verbs, you drop the -er or -ir ending and add -iendo. Use the
following examples as your guide:
hablar (to speak) becomes hablando (speaking)
comer (to eat) becomes comiendo (eating)
escribir (to write) becomes escribiendo (writing)
When you put it all together, you get the present progressive:
Yo estoy hablando. = I am talking.
Él está comiendo. = He is eating.
Ellos están escribiendo. = They are writing.
Of course, every crowd has its exceptions. Table 3-4 lays out many of the most common
irregular present participles.

Reflecting on Reflexive Verbs
Whenever you look at yourself, drive yourself to the mall, or worry yourself silly, you’re
involved in a reﬂexive action. You, the subject, are doing something to yourself, the direct
object. In English, reﬂexive actions become a little fuzzy, because so much is considered to
be understood. Spanish, however, delineates reﬂexive action by requiring the use of a reﬂex-
ive verb and a reﬂexive pronoun, such as myself, yourself, or herself.
When creating a reﬂexive verb construction, you need a subject, a reﬂexive verb, and a
reﬂexive pronoun, but not necessarily in that order. When you conjugate the reﬂexive verbs
in English, you place the pronouns in front of the conjugated verb. In other words, you say,
“You bathe yourself.” But in Spanish, the order is you yourself bathe.
41
Chapter 3: Constructing Commands and Other Verb Structures

The following table shows a reﬂexive verb given in all of its present tense conjugations.
reﬂexive pronoun + bañarse = to bathe (oneself)
me baño
nos bañamos
te bañas
os bañáis
se baña
se bañan
Yo me baño. = I bathe myself.
Many of these reﬂexive verbs involve the mention of a body part, and because it’s already
clear to whom the body part belongs (because of the reﬂexive verb), you don’t use a pos-
sessive pronoun. Instead of saying, “I brush my hair,” for example, you’d say, “I brush the
hair,” because the reﬂexive pronoun already signals that it’s your hair.
Two verbs that are used reﬂexively but vary slightly from the general deﬁnition of a reﬂex-
ive verb are irse, which when used reﬂexively, means to go away, and the verb comerse,
which doesn’t mean to eat oneself but rather to gobble up.
Table 3-5 gives a list of some commonly used reﬂexive verbs:

Chapter 3: Constructing Commands and Other Verb Structures

Having It All with Tener
The verb tener is a simple irregular verb that’s basically used to express possession, such
as “I have a new car,” or “Pedro has a dog named Sam.” But it’s deceptively basic and
extremely versatile. You combine tener with other verbs to express a desire or obligation to
take action. You can also use it to express age — how young or how old you are. In short,
you can get a lot of mileage out of this unassuming verb.
Use the following chart to drill yourself on the present tense forms of tener.
tener = to have
tengo
tenemos
tienes
tenéis
tiene
tienen
Uds. tienen. = You (plural, formal) have.
Expressing desire or obligation with tener
You can use tener to create additional verb structures that express desire or obligation. The
following instructions explain how to create each verb structure:
 To express desire, or say that someone feels like doing something, take the form of
tener that agrees with the subject of your sentence and then add ganas de + inﬁnitive.
 To express obligation, or say that someone has to perform an action, take the form of
tener that agrees with the subject of your sentence and then add que + inﬁnitive.
Here are a few examples to show you how these two structures work.
Yo tengo ganas de ir de compras. = I feel like going shopping.
Ella tiene ganas de cantar. = She feels like singing.
Ellos tienen que estudiar. = They have to study.
Él tiene que trabajar hoy. = He has to work today.
Telling your age with tener
When someone asks you how old you are, tener can help you answer the question. Take the
correct conjugated form for whomever you are describing and then give the correct number
of years that that person has, or as you’d say in English, “is.”
The following examples should help you phrase your answer to questions about age:
Yo tengo veinte años. = I am 20. (literally translates as “I have 20 years”)
Ella tiene treinta y cinco años. = She is 35.
In Spanish, it’s not about how old you are but how many years you have.

Popping the Questions
In This Chapter
 Soliciting a yes/no answer
 Questioning the facts
 Digging deeper with interrogatives
 Providing the particulars
W
hen your inquiring mind wants to know something, it asks questions. You may ask
yes/no questions. Did you go to the concert last night? Did you drive? Did you have a
good time? Did you commit a felony? Or you may ask more speciﬁc, interrogative questions,
such as: What time did the concert start? Where was it? Who was the main performer? Why
did the police have to drive you home? You need to know how to phrase those questions
and how to answer them.
In this chapter, I tell you how to structure yes/no and interrogative questions; restructure a
statement to form a question; use common interrogative words, such as who, what, when,
where, and why; and answer yes/no and interrogative questions. If you still have questions
after you complete this chapter, at least you’ll know how to ask them.
Asking a Yes/No Question(for Lawyers Only)
Lawyers love yes/no questions because they leave no wiggle room. A witness is on the
stand, and the lawyer asks a question to which only two answers are acceptable — yes or
no. But yes/no questions also are suitable for other situations. If you want to know whether
someone knows something, you can ask a yes/no question before getting into the particu-
lars. Yes/no questions enable you to cut to the chase.
In English, when you ask a yes/no question in the present tense, you often begin with either
do or does. For example: Do you like ice cream? Does she wear makeup? When forming a
yes/no question in Spanish, however, you don’t need to add anything. You simply take a
simple statement and invert (switch the places of) the subject and the verb. Of course, you
have to add the question marks — both of them — one at the beginning and one at the end.
You can see what I mean in the following examples:
Él tiene un carro nuevo. = ¿Tiene él un carro nuevo?
Ellos bailan muy bien. =¿Bailan ellos muy bien?
Make the following statements into questions by inverting the subject and the verb, as I
show you in the following example:
Él trabaja aquí. = ¿Trabaja él aquí?

Answering a Yes/No Question 
with a Yes/No Answer
To say yes in Spanish, say, “Sí.” No is “No.” For the sake of clarity and emphasis, however,
you may want to include a portion of the question in your answer. Doing so has the added
beneﬁt of proving that you were, in fact, listening.

To answer positively, open your statement with sí and then follow up with the statement
you’re supporting. To answer negatively, start with saying, “No, (subject) no . . .” followed
by the statement that you’re negating. The subject is in parentheses because you don’t
always have to include it in Spanish if the information already is clear. 
Here’s an example of a question answered positively and negatively:
Question
¿Baila Raúl mucho? = Does Raúl dance a lot?
Positive response
Sí, Raúl baila mucho. = Yes, Raúl dances a lot.
Negative response
No, Raúl no baila mucho. = No, Raúl doesn’t dance a lot.

Posing Interrogative Questions Inquiring Minds
Want to Know
An experienced news reporter knows the importance of the ﬁve major interrogatives: Who?
What? When? Where? and Why? If the reporter can obtain solid answers to those ﬁve ques-
tions, he or she has everything necessary to put together a Pulitzer Prize winning piece.
Those ﬁve interrogative words are a good start in Spanish, too, but you also need to famil-
iarize yourself with some additional interrogative words. Table 4-1 reveals the most impor-
tant interrogative words in English and Spanish.
Table 4-1
Interrogative Words
Spanish Interrogative Words
Translation
¿Quién(es) . . . ?
Who . . . ?
¿Qué . . . ?
What . . . ?
¿Dónde . . . ?
Where . . . ?
¿Adónde . . . ?
Where (to) . . . ?
¿De dónde . . . ?
Where (from) . . . ?
¿Cuándo . . . ?
When . . . ?
¿Cómo . . . ?
How . . . ?
¿Porqué . . . ?
Why . . . ?
¿Cuánto/a . . . ?
How much . . . ?
¿Cuántos/as . . . ?
How many . . . ?
To form a question with the interrogative words, you follow the same inversion rule that
you use when forming a yes/no question, but then you tack on the interrogative word at the
beginning, and of course, add the question marks. If you want to know when Susana dances
well, for example, here’s how you would phrase your question:
Susana baila muy bien. = Susana dances really well.
¿Cuándo baila Susana muy bien? = When does Susana dance really well?
To inquire who dances really well, simply omit Susana’s name and rephrase your question
as follows:
¿Quién baila muy bien? = Who dances really well?
To ﬁnd out how Susana dances, use the interrogative word cómo to structure your interrog-
ative question in the following way:
¿Cómo baila Susana? = How does Susana dance?

Chapter 4: Popping the Questions

Coming up with Some Answers
The easiest way to answer an interrogative question is to recycle the material — rephrase
the question as a statement and tack on the speciﬁc information your interrogator
requested. In the previous section, interrogative questions were formed out of statements
by omitting the information that you were seeking and adding an interrogative word at the
front of the question. To answer these same questions, you simply reverse the process by:
1. Omitting the interrogative word.
2. Inverting the question into a statement.
3. Adding the details.
So if you want to know when Juan studies, and the answer is every day, the question and
answer will look like this:
¿Cuándo estudia Juan? = Juan estudia todos los días.
Now say, for example, you want to know who studies every day. You omit Juan’s name and
add who instead of when as your interrogative. The Q&A then looks like this:
¿Quién estudia todos los días? = Juan estudia todos los días.
The plural who (¿Quiénes . . . ?) is used when the suspected answer is more than one
person. When using the plural who, the Q&A takes on the following appearance:
¿Quiénes estudian todos los días? = Juan y Antonio estudian todos los días.
Answer the following interrogative questions in Spanish by using the information from
the statements in the ﬁrst activity in this chapter under “Asking a Yes/No Question (for
Lawyers Only).”

Coming and Going with Venir and Ir
In This Chapter
 Going once, going twice, with the verb ir
 Introducing the verb venir
 Contracting the prepositions a and de
D
o you ever get that feeling that you don’t know whether you’re coming or going? Well, in
this chapter, you get to do both with the Spanish verbs venir (to come) and ir (to go).
Although these verbs are two of the tiniest in the Spanish language, they’re also two of the
most commonly used and irregular verbs, and they demand special attention in this book.
In this chapter, not only do you ﬁnd out how to express your goings and comings in
Spanish, but you also discover how to do it in all of the present-tense forms. And because
you’re always coming from somewhere or going to someplace, you also ﬁnd out how to use
these prepositions to describe where it is you’re coming from or going to.
Going the Distance with Ir
The verb ir is deﬁnitely the smallest -ir type verb, and that’s really all it is — an i and an r.
Actually, it looks like a verb without a verb stem, an end with no beginning. It’s also one of
the most irregular verbs in the Spanish language. As you can see from its conjugation chart,
the verb ir gives the term irregular a whole new meaning. Who would ever think that going
could be so complicated?
ir = to go
voy
vamos
vas
vais
va
van
Nosotros vamos. = We go.
Spend some time drilling the verb forms into your brain cells, and then when you think you
have them down, proceed to the following exercise to test your skills.
Provide the correct form of the verb ir for the following subjects, as I show you here:
Mi papá = va
1.
Tomás = _______________
2.
nosotros = _______________
3.
yo = _______________

Coming Around with Venir
People come and people go.
The verb venir covers the coming end of the equation. Although the verb venir isn’t quite
as irregular as ir, it’s still fairly irregular, as the following conjugation chart shows.
venir = to come
vengo
venimos
vienes
venís
viene
vienen
Uds. vienen. = You (plural, formal) come.
Spend some time drilling the venir verb forms, and then when you think you have them
down, proceed to the following exercise to test your skills.
Provide the correct form of the verb venir to say that the following people are coming.
Here’s an example to get you started:
Los estudiantes = vienen
11.
yo = _______________
12.
mis amigos = _______________
13.
ellos = _______________

16.
mi hermana = _______________
17.
tú = _______________

18.
vosotras = _______________
19.
Raúl y yo = _______________
20.
el profesor = _______________
Contracting a and de — Only When You Must
Whenever you talk about coming and going you need to use the prepositions a (to in
English) and de (from in English), because you will always be going to or coming from some-
place. When using these prepositions in Spanish, you ﬁrst need to become acquainted with
one crucial rule: Whenever a or de precedes the masculine singular article el, you must con-
tract the preposition. When a precedes el, the two contract to form al. When de precedes
el, the two contract to form del. The following examples help drive the point home:
Yo voy (a + el parque) al parque. = I am going to the park.
Nosotros vamos (a + el restaurante) = We are going to the Mexican restaurant.
al restaurante mexicano.
Ellos vienen (de + el cine) del cine. = They are coming from the cinema.
Él viene (de + el teatro) del teatro. = He is coming from the theater.
These contractions, al and del, occur only with the masculine singular article el.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish, using the verbs ir and venir and the prepo-
sitions a and de, as I show you here:
We are going to a restaurant tonight.
Nosotros vamos a un restaurante esta noche.

Exploring Some Exceptional
Exceptions

In this part . . . 
Just when you thought you had this verb thing under
control, the language throws its exceptions at you. In
this case, I’m talking about the verbs that refuse to conform
to the standard rules and regulations that govern con-
jugations. The Spanish language features a couple notable
exceptions, including the verb gustar (for expressing your
likes and dislikes), ser (for describing the essence of a
person, place, or thing), and estar (for describing the tem-
porary condition or location of a person, place, or thing).
Spanish also has some stem-changing and spelling-
changing verbs to further confuse you.
In this part, you find out how to describe who you are,
what you do, where you’re from, and what you like and
dislike. I even show you how to hold your own in a con-
versation about the weather.

Chapter 6
Declaring Your Likes and Dislikes
with Gustar
In This Chapter
 Clarifying action with indirect object pronouns
 Making choices with verbs like gustar
 Exposing yourself to more verbs like gustar
W
hen it comes to liking and disliking something, English and Spanish have a slightly
different way of expressing what’s going on. In English, the subject of the sentence is
in charge of liking or disliking something. You may say, “I like vanilla ice cream,” or, “I don’t
like red sports cars.” In Spanish, the object of your desire, or lack of desire, is more respon-
sible for pleasing you. Instead of saying, “I like vanilla ice cream,” you say, “Vanilla ice cream
is pleasing to me” — “Me gusta el helado de vainilla.”
In Spanish, rather than looking for the subject at the beginning of the sentence to determine
the verb form, you look to the object at the end of the sentence. The object is in control of
the action. This chapter introduces you to an entire group of verbs with a variety of mean-
ings that share this reverse formation process and use indirect-object pronouns to clarify
the who in the sentence.
Taking on Indirect-Object Pronouns
Before I get started explaining the ﬁner points of a complicated Spanish verb gustar, I need
to let you in on the secret of indirect-object pronouns, because you need them when you
work with gustar and other verbs like it.
An indirect object is anything or anyone that the action of a sentence affects in an indirect
way. If you kick your friend Sally the ball, for example, the ball is the direct object because
it’s getting kicked, and Sally is the indirect object. When you use the indirect object, you’re
saying you’re kicking the ball “to Sally.”
A pronoun is a word that stands in for a speciﬁc name or noun. Think of it as the generic
brand. So if instead of saying you “kicked your friend Sally the ball,” you said you “kicked
her the ball,” you’d be using an indirect object pronoun — her. The indirect-object pronoun
usually implies the word to or for. Spanish uses the indirect-object pronouns in the table
that follows.
Indirect Object Pronouns
me = to me
nos = to us
te = to you (familiar)
os = to you (plural, familiar)
le = to him, her, you (formal)
les = to them, you (plural, formal)

74
Part II: Exploring Some Exceptional Exceptions 
When you use one of these indirect-object pronouns in a Spanish sentence, be sure to place
it in front of the conjugated verb.
Take Your Pick: Gusta or Gustan?
In Spanish, expressions of like and dislike are completely ﬂip-ﬂopped when compared to
English. You use the verb gustar for the verb to like in English, but gustar really means to be
pleasing to. When you form a sentence, then, whatever is doing the pleasing becomes the
subject and determines the form of the verb gustar. Use the following rules as your guide:
 If you like a single thing, use the third-person singular form, gusta.
 If you like two or more things, use the third-person plural form, gustan.
 If you like to do activities and you’re using verbs to describe those activities, use the
third-person singular form. Stick with the third-person singular, even if you like multi-
ple activities.
 Use indirect-object pronouns to clarify to whom the thing (subject) is pleasing. If you
need further clariﬁcation, place a clause with a and the  name of the person at the
beginning of your sentence.
To see how this plays out in real life, check out the following example:
Sentence: A Juan le gusta el restaurante Mexicano.
Literal translation: To Juan, to him, is pleasing the Mexican restaurant.
Real-life translation: Juan likes the Mexican restaurant.
A Juan is used here to clarify who is indicated by the pronoun le. Sometimes you need
prepositional phrases only for emphasis, rather than clarity. For example, if I was telling you
about something that I liked, you’d know that the Spanish indirect-object pronoun me was
me, but I can emphasize that I really liked it by adding, a mí at the front of my sentence.
Here’s a sentence with a plural subject. Remember, the subject is at the end of the sentence.
Sentence: A ellos les gustan las películas.
Literal translation: To them are pleasing movies.
Real-life translation: They like movies.
You simply put a no in front of the indirect-object pronoun — after the clarifying clause —
to make a negative statement with the verb gustar and other similar verbs. So for example:
A él no le gusta pescar. = He doesn’t like to ﬁsh.
You can add mucho after the verb to say that you really like something. For example:
A ella le gusta mucho bailar. = She really likes dancing.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish. Remember to use clarifying clauses with the
preposition a at the beginning of your sentences. Use gusta with singular subjects and verbs
and gustan with plural subjects, as I show you here:
The children like candy. = A los niños les gustan los dulces.

1.
She likes dogs.

2.
They like to dance.

Brushing up on Other Verbs Like Gustar
You have to admit that gustar is out of the norm as far as Spanish verbs go, but it isn’t a
one-of-a-kind wonder. The verb gustar is a member of an exclusive organization of verbs
that include verbs that mean repugnant to, fascinating to, and interesting to.
Conjugating these verbs is a snap. You can forget, for a moment anyway, all you learned
about ﬁrst- and second-person singular and plural. All these verbs conjugate just like gustar,
using indirect-object pronouns and the third-person singular and plural forms. Table 6-1
shows the most commonly used gustar look-alikes along with their meanings.
Table 6-1
Verbs Conjugated in the Third Person with Indirect Objects

to be enchanting to
faltar
to be lacking to
fascinar
to be fascinating to
importar
to be important to
interesar
to be interesting to
molestar
to bother
parecer
to seem; to appear to
The -ar verbs above use either the endings -a or -an. The verb parecer, which is the only -er
verb, uses the endings -e or -en.

Being All That You Can Be 
with Ser and Estar
In This Chapter
 Describing the unchanging nature of a person, place, or thing with ser
 Expressing the ever-changing being of a person, place, or thing with estar
 Discerning the subtle nuances of ser and estar
T
he concept of being is quite simple — unless, of course, you happen to be an armchair
philosopher. Sometimes philosophers become so obsessed with the concept of being
that they begin to question their own being. They have to come up with quotes (like
Descartes’s “I think, therefore I am”) just to be able to acknowledge their own existence.
In this chapter, I won’t get quite that obsessed with the concept of being, but I am going to tell
you about the two verbs that express being in Spanish — ser and estar. Both verbs literally
mean to be, but ser refers to the essence of being, such as the roundness of a ball, and estar
refers to the changing nature of being, such as the location of the ball. By the end of this chap-
ter, you’ll know all the forms of ser and estar and when to use one or the other in a sentence.
Being is the most basic of actions, and the information about it in this chapter can be of
utmost importance to you, so be attentive!
Capturing the Essence of One’s Being with Ser
When you meet someone for the ﬁrst time, you probably ask a series of questions to ﬁnd out
who that person is. You may ask that person about his or her profession, hometown, or rela-
tionship to others — is that person a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or mother?
As you converse, the qualities of the person’s personality may show through. He or she may
appear sensitive or funny or interesting. All of these relatively unchanging qualities comprise
a person’s essence — the unchanging being of a person, place, or thing. Think of the verb ser
as the what-it-is verb. When you need to tell somebody what something is, use the verb ser.
When expressing this form of being in Spanish, you use the verb ser, an irregular verb that
has the following present-tense forms:
ser = to be
soy
somos
eres
sois
es
son
Él es abogado. = He is a lawyer.

82
Part II: Exploring Some Exceptional Exceptions 
Here are some examples of descriptive sentences using ser:
Ella es alta. = She is tall.
Ellos son estudiantes. = They are students.
La señora González es bonita. = Mrs. González is pretty.
Yo soy de California. = I am from California.
La escuela es nueva. = The school is new.
Give the correct form of the verb ser that you’d use if the following people or things were
the subjects of your sentences. Here’s an example:
mi hermana = es
1.
ella = _______________
2.
nosotros = _______________
3.
mis amigos = _______________
4.
Juan = _______________
5.
tú = _______________
6.
su padre = _______________
7.
el museo = _______________
8.
los niños = _______________
9.
Miguel y Elena = _______________
10.
ellos = _______________
Being Here, There, or Anywhere with Estar
Certain aspects of one’s being are variable. You may be sad one day and ecstatic the next. A
friend may be ill. Your mother-in-law may be vacationing in Cancun. Those forms of being
don’t deﬁne a person’s nature, but rather they deﬁne temporary conditions that typically
are affected by outside inﬂuences.
When describing the changing nature of a person, place, or thing in Spanish, you use the
verb estar. Like ser, estar literally translates as to be, but you typically use estar to describe
more variable forms of being, such as health, feelings, and location. Like ser, estar is an
irregular verb that takes the following present-tense forms:
estar = to be
estoy
estamos
estás
estáis
está
están
Ellos están en el parque. = They are at the park.

Because most forms of being have to do with temporary conditions, you can ﬁnd plenty of
uses for the verb estar, as the following examples illustrate:
Nosotros estamos en el cine. = We are at the cinema.
Ellos están aburridos. = They are bored.
Ella está triste. = She is sad.
Yo estoy enfermo. = I am sick.
Juan está en la playa. = Juan is at the beach.
Accents are used in four of the forms of estar. (Check out the conjugation chart earlier in
the section.) Accent marks to show stress in Spanish are used when a word does not fall
into one of the following categories:
 In words that end in a vowel or n or s, the stress naturally falls on the second-to-last
syllable. In mañana (tomorrow), for example, the stress is on -ña.
 In words that end in a consonant other than n or s, the stress naturally falls on the last
syllable. In the word cantar (to sing), you stress -tar.
Give the correct form of the verb estar that you’d use if the following people or things were
the subjects of your sentences. Here’s an example:
su casa = está
11.
sus padres = _______________
12.
Emilio = _______________
13.
mis hermanas = _______________
14.
Francisco y Elena = _______________
15.
Juana y yo = _______________
16.
Uds. = _______________
17.
tú = _______________
18.
nosotros = _______________
19.
yo = _______________
20.
el ediﬁcio nuevo = _______________
Choosing Your Manner of Being: Ser or Estar?
Perhaps the most difﬁcult part about using ser and estar correctly in a sentence is choosing
which one to use. The concept of two different types of being — unchanging essential being
and being that changes depending on various conditions — is easy enough to grasp, but
when you encounter different types of being, trying to pigeonhole them as one or the other
can be quite challenging.
83
Chapter 7: Being All That You Can Be with Ser and Estar

This section provides some additional guidelines that can help you decide whether to use
ser or estar. The exercises in this section provide you with additional practice, mixing it up
a little, so you not only need to know which form of the verb to use but also which verb is
most appropriate. Be prepared to be challenged.
Deciding when to use ser
You already know that you use the verb ser to describe the unchanging characteristics of a
person, place, or thing, but what exactly does that mean? The following lists provide addi-
tional details to help you identify situations in which to use ser:
Origin and Nationality
Ella es de España. = She is from Spain.
Ella es española. = She is Spanish.
The Four P’s: Personality, Physical Attributes, Profession, and Possession
Él es divertido. = He is fun.
Susana es baja. = Susana is short.
Mi padre es un médico. = My father is a doctor.
El carro azul es mío. = The blue car is mine.
Date and Time
Hoy es el seis de enero. = Today is of January 6th.
Son las nueve de la noche. = It is 9 p.m.
Relationships
Ellos son mis padres. = They are my parents.
Rafael es mi mejor amigo. = Rafael is my best friend.
Deciding when to use estar
You know to use the verb estar to describe the changing characteristics of a person, place,
or thing, but what exactly does that mean? The following list provides additional details to
help you identify situations in which to use estar:
Location
Su casa está en la avenida Juárez. = Her house is on Juarez Avenue.
El cine está cerca del centro. = The cinema is near the center of town.
Mood and Physical Condition
El profesor está enojado. = The teacher is angry.
Mi madre está emocionada. = My mother is excited.
Los estudiantes están aburridos. = The students are bored.
La señorita Martínez está enferma. = Miss Martinez is sick.

E
very language has its share of troublemakers — the exceptions to the rules. The most
famous of these rules in the English language has to be: i before e except after c or
when pronounced as a as in “neighbor” and “weigh.” Spanish verbs have several exceptions
that are likewise dedicated to ﬂustering beginning Spanish speakers and writers. Some
verbs insist on changing their verb stems depending on the conjugation. Others change
their spellings.
This chapter introduces you to the mind-muddling, stem-changing, and spelling-changing
verbs and lets you in on the tricks to conjugating them properly so that you can retain their
proper pronunciations. You ﬁnd out how to tap the power of the diminutive yet powerful
verb hay, and you discover various ways to discuss the weather with the two primary fore-
casting verbs hacer and estar.
Getting a Grip on Stem-Changing Verbs
When you hear the term stem-changing verbs, you may imagine some weird grammatical
creature in a sci-ﬁﬂick that morphs as terriﬁed beginning Spanish students attempt to con-
jugate it. Dealing with stem-changing verbs is not exactly that bad, but it requires some
patience and understanding. To help you cope, keep the following points in mind:
 Focus on present-tense conjugations for now. The chapters in Part IV deal with irregu-
larities in other tenses.
 You encounter three types of stem-changing verbs in which the vowel used in the stem
changes from e to i, e to ie, or o to ue.
 The verb jugar has a stem-change from u to ue, but it doesn’t constitute its own category.
I include it here, however, because it follows the same rules as other stem-changers.
 Stem changes occur in all of the present-tense forms of the verb except for the nosotros
and the vosotros forms.
Sometimes the conjugation format for stem-changing verbs is referred to as the boot,
because if you were to draw a dark line around the forms that have a stem change, they’d
resemble a boot. Check out Figure 8-1 to see what I mean.

Presto Change-O: Verbs with Spelling Changes
Stem-changing verbs experience spelling changes that arise from the requirements of the
conjugation. Other verbs require spelling changes based on pronunciation. Spanish is a pho-
netic language, so what you see is what you get. Or, more precisely, what you see is what
you say or what you hear.
92
Part II: Exploring Some Exceptional Exceptions 

To keep pronunciation consistent, spelling changes are often required. As a verb is conju-
gated, changes in its spelling may alter the way the word is pronounced, so additional
spelling changes are required to ensure that the resulting pronunciation of the word
matches the pronunciation of the original. To provide some semblance of logic to these
spelling changes, I’ve divided the spelling changes into these eight groups:
 Group 1: Soft g changes to j in front of an -o or an -a ending.
 Group 2: Hard gu changes to g in front of an -o or an -a ending.
 Group 3: Hard qu changes to c in front of an -o or an -a ending.
 Group 4: The c in cer or cir verbs, when preceded by a consonant, changes to a z in
front of an -o or an -a ending.
 Group 5: The c in cer or cir verbs, when preceded by a vowel, changes to a zc in front
of an -o or an -a ending. (This spelling-change rule is not dictated by pronunciation 
reasons, but it still falls under the category of a spelling change rule.)
 Group 6: Hard c changes to qu in front of an -e ending.
 Group 7: The letter z changes to c in front of an -e ending.
 Group 8: Hard g changes to gu in front of an -e ending.
Groups 6 through 8 don’t affect the present tense, so you work with them in Part III of
Spanish Verbs For Dummies, in which I cover the subjunctive mood. Following are examples
of spelling changes in the present tense from the ﬁrst ﬁve groups. Pay particular attention
to the yo form, which has an -o ending.
Group 1 (soft g to j): escoger = to choose
escojo
escogemos
escoges
escogéis
escoge
escogen
Uds. escogen. = You (plural, formal) choose.
Another verb in this group is proteger (to protect).
Group 2 (hard gu to g): distinguir = to distinguish
distingo
distinguimos
distingues
distinguís
distingue
distinguen
Ella distingue. = She distinguishes.
Two other verbs in this group are conseguir (to attain) and seguir (to follow).
Group 3 (hard qu to c): delinquir = to offend
delinco
delinquimos
delinques
delinquís
delinque
delinquen
Yo delinco. = I offend.
93
Chapter 8: Wrestling with Some Irregular Formations

This verb stands alone. I can’t think of another verb that follows its example.
Group 4 (c to z): convencer = to convince
convenzo
convencemos
convences
convencéis
convence
convencen
Vosotros convencéis. = You (plural, familiar) convince.
Another verb in this group is vencer (to defeat, to conquer). 
Group5 (c to cz): conocer = to know, to be familiar with
conozco
conocemos
conoces
conocéis
conoce
conocen
Nosotras conocemos. = We (female) know.
Other verbs in this group are conducir (to drive), producir (to produce), traducir (to trans-
late), crecer (to grow), ofrecer (to offer), and pertenecer (to pertain).
Expressing Yourself with the Puny
but Powerful Hay
The tiny verb hay packs a powerful punch in Spanish. Depending on the context in which
you use it, this little three-letter word is a universal sentence starter that can take on any of
the following meanings:
 There is . . .
 There are . . .
 Is there . . . ?
 Are there . . . ?
Take a look at just how versatile this mighty hay can be in the following examples:
Hay un libro en la mesa. = There is a book on the table.
Hay veinticinco estudiantes en la clase. = There are 25 students in the class.
¿Hay un libro en la mesa? = Is there a book on the table?
¿Hay veinticinco estudiantes en la clase? = Are there 25 students in the class?
Translate the following sentences into Spanish using the puny but powerful hay. Here’s an
example to get you started:
There are a lot of boys in the class. = Hay muchos chicos en la clase.

Forecasting the Weather with Hacer and Estar
When you need to say something but really have nothing to say, you can always break the
proverbial ice by talking about the weather. Discussing the weather in Spanish means using
the verb hacer, which means to do or to make. Although it doesn’t translate literally in
weather expressions, hacer is used to mean it is or it’s.
The examples that follow in Table 8-4 are some common weather expressions that use the
verb hacer:

Hace (muy) mal tiempo.

The verb estar (to be) also is used in weather expressions but to a much lesser degree (you
can ﬁnd out more about the versatile estar in Chapter 7). The following examples in Table 8-5
are weather descriptions that use estar:

Working Out with the
Remaining Simple Tenses

In this part . . . 
T
he present tense can carry you only so far. You need
other tenses and other moods to discuss past events
and future occasions and to express your hopes, desires,
and attitudes. The chapters in this part depart from the
present but stick with the regular verbs. Here you find out
how to describe past events in the preterit and imperfect,
dream about upcoming prospects with the future tense,
form conditional what if statements, and use the subjunc-
tive mood to convey uncertainty about the present and
past and express wishes, doubts, and opinions.
Each chapter provides a quick review of how to conjugate
regular verbs in the specified tense or mood and helps
you identify situations in which you should use the tense
or mood.

and Imperfect Tenses
In This Chapter
 Expressing past, completed actions with the preterit tense
 Mastering the regular preterit conjugations
 Describing ongoing actions in the past with the imperfect tense
 Getting a grip on the regular imperfect conjugations
 Discerning the subtle nuances between the preterit and imperfect tenses
W
hat’s past is past. Or is it? The past tense can be a little murky in Spanish (and in
English). Sometimes, an action in the past is complete: It’s done, over, you can stick
a fork in it. In other cases, past action is a little more vague. It doesn’t relate to a speciﬁc
event but to a past action that was continuous, ongoing, or habitual — something you “used
to do” or “were doing,” for example, at no set period or time. In English, you probably distin-
guish between these subtle nuances in past tense all the time without ever giving it a
second thought, but to be able to effectively understand and use the different tenses in
Spanish, you need to become much more aware of their differences.
In this chapter, you discover how to conjugate verbs in both the preterit and imperfect
tenses, and you explore distinctions in usage. You encounter each tense separately and get
plenty of practice with their respective conjugations. After you practice with each tense on
its own, I mix it up a bit, challenging you to select the appropriate tense based on how each
verb is used in a series of sample sentences.
Getting Over It with the Preterit
The preterit tense enables you to put the past behind you. It describes a completed past
action — something that happened yesterday, last night, last week, last year, or at some
other deﬁnite point in time. The action may have occurred a speciﬁc number of times or
within an enclosed period of time, but it’s done, ﬁnished. You have closure.
When working with the preterit, it helps to have some time words at your disposal, so you
can describe, speciﬁcally, when a particular action took place. Table 9-1 lists time words
commonly used with the preterit tense.

To form regular -ar verbs in the preterit tense, you add the following endings to the verb
stem:
yo -é
nosotros/as -amos
tú -aste
vosotros/as -asteis
él, ella -o
ellos/as -aron
Ud.
Uds.
So here’s what the verb hablar looks like in the preterit tense:
hablar = to speak
hablé
hablamos
hablaste
hablasteis
habló
hablaron
Yo hablé. = I spoke.
Spelling changes, like the ones I discuss in Chapter 8, play a part in the preterit tense for
some -ar verbs. Keep the following spelling changes in mind:
 Change z to c in front of -é.
empezar (to begin) becomes yo empecé
 Change hard c to qu in front of -é.
explicar (to explain) becomes yo expliqué
 Change hard g to gu in front of -é.
llegar (to arrive) becomes yo llegué

To form regular -er and -ir verbs in the preterit tense, you add the following endings to the
verb stem:
yo -í
nosotros/as -imos
tú -iste
vosotros/as -isteis
él, ella -ió
ellos/as -ieron
Ud.
Uds.
Here’s what the verb comer looks like in the preterit tense:
comer = to eat
comí
comimos
comiste
comisteis
comió
comieron
Él comió. = He ate.
And here’s what the verb vivir looks like in the preterit tense:
vivir = to live
viví
vivimos
viviste
vivisteis
vivió
vivieron
Tú viviste. = You (familiar) lived.
Notice that the nosotros forms of -ar and -ir verbs are the same in the preterit tense as they
are in the present tense.
Put the following regular verbs into their correct preterit form according to the subjects
given, as I show you here:
mi mamá/hablar = mi mamá habló

103
Chapter 9: Looking Back with the Preterit and Imperfect Tenses

Practicing with the Regular Preterit
Being able to use the preterit after learning how to form it often requires some additional
practice. The key concept to wrap your brain around when it comes to the preterit tense is
that the action is completed in the past and shows no signs of continuing. If you’re looking to
communicate this sense of ﬁnality, then the preterit is the tense for you.
Here’s how I can use the preterit to describe a typical morning, from the time I woke up to
the time I arrived at work (all completed actions):
Me levanté a las siete y media. = I woke up at 7:30.
Me duché. = I took a shower.
Me cepillé los dientes y me peiné. = I brushed my teeth and combed my hair.
Me vestí. = I got dressed.
Desayuné. = I ate breakfast.
Salí de la casa a las ocho y media. = I left home at 8:30.
Llegué a mi trabajo a las nueve. = I arrived at work at 9.
I could go on, but the monotony of my day would only make you sleepy. To keep things
interesting, try your hand at it.
Translate the following statements into Spanish. Follow my lead:
My brother attended a concert last night. = Mi hermano asistió a un concierto anoche.
11.
I ate at a Mexican restaurant yesterday.

Answer Sí or No to the following preterit tense statements based on your past actions, as I
show you in the following example:
Si ¿Compraste un carro nuevo el año pasado? (Did you buy a new car last year?)
16.
_____ ¿Llamaste a un amigo por teléfono ayer?
17.
_____ ¿Visitaste a un museo el ﬁn de semana pasado?

23.
_____ ¿Miraste la televisión anoche?
24.
_____ ¿Caminaste al centro esta mañana?
25.
_____ ¿Comiste pizza esta tarde?
Giving Hazy Details with the Imperfect
The imperfect tense is vague and imprecise. That’s why it’s called imperfect. When you
know something happened in the past, but you’re not really sure when or how often, you
use the imperfect tense. In English, you typically use the expressions used to or always to
describe these actions:
I used to golf every Sunday.
My mom always made tamales for the holidays.
Chico used to run ﬁve miles a day.
The imperfect is used to describe continuous, ongoing, or habitual past action.
When forming the regular imperfect tense of -ar verbs, you add the following endings to the
verb stem:
Yo -aba
nosotros/as -ábamos
Tú -abas
vosotros/as -abais
él, ella -aba
ellos/as -aban
Ud.
Ud.
So the imperfect conjugations of hablar are
hablar = to speak
hablaba
hablábamos
hablabas
hablabais
hablaba
hablaban
Yo hablaba. = I used to speak.
To conjugate -er and -ir regular verbs into the imperfect tense, you add the following end-
ings to the verb stem:
yo –ía
nosotros/as -íamos
tú –ías
vosotros/as -íais
él, ella -ía
ellos/as -ían
Ud.
Uds.
105
Chapter 9: Looking Back with the Preterit and Imperfect Tenses

So the imperfect conjugations of the verb comer are
comer = to eat
comía
comíamos
comías
comíais
comía
comían
Nosotros comíamos. = We used to eat.
And the imperfect conjugations of the verb vivir are
vivir = to live
vivía
vivíamos
vivías
vivíais
vivía
vivían
Ud. vivía. = You (formal) used to live.
Now that you have all of the regular imperfect conjugations, take a few minutes to etch it on

Practicing with the Regular Imperfect
You know the regular imperfect conjugations and can recite them in your sleep, but can you
use them in a sentence? You’re about to ﬁnd out. In this section, you get to test your skills
with the regular imperfect, but ﬁrst, see Table 9-2 to review the list of time expressions that
are commonly used with the imperfect tense:

The imperfect is a very useful past tense for expressing background actions or actions that
were going on when they were suddenly interrupted by a preterit tense action. The actions
described by the imperfect tense are ongoing or habitual past actions that don’t show their
beginning or their end or any particular time limitations.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish using the imperfect tense. Here’s an example
to get you started:
I used to attend church every Sunday. = Yo asistía a la iglesia todos los domingos. 
36.

Answer Sí or No to the following statements based on your past actions. Because these
statements are in the imperfect tense, they refer to activities that you used to do. Here’s an
example:
Sí ¿Jugabas al tenis? (Did you used to play tennis?)
46.
_____ ¿Trabajabas mucho?
47.
_____ ¿Estudiabas con amigos los ﬁnes de semana?

Preterit or Imperfect? You Decide
Now, the moment you’ve been waiting for — the moment that challenges you to select the
right tense for the right job. You’re given a sentence that expresses or describes an action
from the past, and it’s up to you to decide which tense to use — preterit or imperfect. When
choosing between the two, review the uses for the preterit and the imperfect in Table 9-3.
108
Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 

Table 9-3
Uses of the Preterit and Imperfect Tenses
Uses of the preterit
Uses of the imperfect
To describe an action or a series of actions 
To describe ongoing or continuous past actions, 
which were completed in the past
without focusing on their beginning or end
To express an action, event, or state of mind
To describe conditions in the past
that happened in the past and was completed 
at a speciﬁc moment or period
To tell the time in the past
When choosing between the imperfect and the preterit, watch for time words to use as
clues, and remember that the imperfect often translates to English as “used to.”
After you’ve decided on the appropriate tense, you can then conjugate the verb and supply
any necessary time phrases to complete the translation. The following practice activities
can help you see for yourself whether you’ve grasped the difference between these two past
tenses. After you’ve ﬁgured it out, you may just ﬁnd yourself saying, “¡Viva la diferencia!”
Translate the following sentences into Spanish. You must choose which past tense to use —
the preterit or the imperfect — and then conjugate the verb accordingly, as I show you here:
I wrote a letter to my sister last night. = Yo escribí una carta a mi hermana anoche.

Looking Ahead with the Future Tense
In This Chapter
 Conjugating regular forms of the future tense
 Understanding the uses of future tense
 Expressing yourself in future tense
S
ome people get tense about the future, because it’s unknown and uncertain. When
you’re studying a foreign language, however, you may get tense about the future for
entirely different reasons — perhaps because you don’t know how to form the future tense
or use it to describe future events or actions. This chapter builds your conﬁdence by show-
ing you the basics of forming and using the future tense to describe actions and events that
will occur. When will they occur? Whenever you say they will, by using adverbs and adver-
bial phrases such as tomorrow, next week, next year, this Saturday, and next month. In this
chapter, you discover the basics of forming the regular future tense and using adverbs to
make your expressions more precise.
Forming the Regular Future Tense
The regular future tense is one of the easiest tenses to form. You simply take the entire -ar,
-er, or -ir verb in its inﬁnitive form and add the appropriate ending.
yo -é
nosotros/as -emos
tú -ás
vosotros/as -éis
él, ella -á
ellos/as -án
Ud.
Uds.
Here are examples of regular -ar, -er, and -ir verbs conjugated in the future tense, with a sen-
tence given to show their use.
hablar = to speak
hablaré
hablaremos
hablarás
hablaréis
hablará
hablarán
Tomás hablará por teléfono con Susana mañana. = Thomas will talk on the phone with 
Susan tomorrow.

116
Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 
comer = to eat
comeré
comeremos
comerás
comeréis
comerá
comerán
Nosotros comeremos pizza esta tarde. = We will eat pizza this afternoon.
escribir = to write
escribiré
escribiremos
escribirás
escribiréis
escribirá
escribirán
Ella escribirá una carta mañana. = She will write a letter tomorrow.
Translate each phrase, giving the correct subject pronoun for the following future tense
verbs. (Remember that in some forms more than one choice is correct.) Here’s what I mean:
tú llevarás = you will wear
1.
_______________ venderé = _______________
2.
_______________ comprará = _______________
3.
_______________ celebraremos = _______________
4.
_______________ ganará = _______________
5.
_______________ vivirás = _______________
6.
_______________ bailarán = _______________
7.
_______________ cantaré = _______________
8.
_______________ comeremos = _______________
9.
_______________ hablará = _______________
10.
_______________ llamarás = _______________
Put the following inﬁnitives in the correct future form according to the subject given. The
subject may be a name, a noun, or a pronoun. Remember, all future tense conjugated forms
have a written accent mark except the nosotros form.
Here’s an example:
ella/ir de compras = irá de compras
11.
José/pintar = _______________
12.
Raúl y Susana/bailar = _______________

13.
El profesor/acercarse = _______________
14.
Mi papá/visitar = _______________

Ellos/aprender = _______________
18.
Nosotros/jugar = _______________
19.
El mecánico/reparar = _______________
20.
Tú/cerrar = _______________
Talking About the Future
Now that you have become successful at forming the regular future tense, you get a chance
to put what you’ve learned into practice by describing future actions in complete sentences.
Table 10-1 gives a list of some useful time expressions that give more speciﬁc information to
your audience as to when in the future the action will take place.

on what you will be doing in the future. Here’s an example:
C Almorzaré a la una hoy. (I will eat lunch at 1 p.m. today.)
You can omit the subject pronoun in a Spanish sentence if the subject is clear. For example:
if the verb ending is -é in the future tense, the subject clearly is yo.

Answer the following questions with complete sentences. Note that all sentences refer to
future actions.
In Spanish, you can omit the subject if the subject is clear. Therefore, you can omit yo in
these answers. Likewise, in Spanish, two negatives do not equal a positive; in fact, you must
use two no’s to respond negatively in Spanish. The equivalent in English takes the form,
“No, I won’t be eating . . .”
Here’s how your answers might look:
¿Correrás en el parque mañana? (Will you run in the park tomorrow?)
Positive response: Sí, yo correré en el parque mañana.
Negative response: No, yo no correré en el parque mañana.

S
hould’ve, could’ve, would’ve . . . that’s what the conditional tense is all about. If the con-
ditions were appropriate, then the action should’ve, could’ve, or would’ve resulted . . .
theoretically speaking. Simply put, you use the conditional tense to express a conditional
action. But you can also use it to make a polite request or to subtly, or not so subtly, suggest
that someone perform a certain action.
In this chapter, you investigate the regular present tense conjugations of the conditional
tense. You ﬁnd out how to form the conditional tense and how to use it in a sentence. And,
if you so choose, you get plenty of practice to hone your conditional skills.
Forming the Regular Conditional Tense,
If You Really Want To
In English, the key word to forming the conditional tense is would. You or somebody else
would do something if the conditions were right. In Spanish, you actually change the form of
the verb to build the sense of would right into it. When conjugating Spanish verbs in the reg-
ular conditional tense, keep the following points in mind:
 The regular conditional tense is a combination of the imperfect and future tenses.
Check out Chapters 9 and 10 to review how to form the imperfect and future tenses.
 The regular conditional tense requires no spelling or stem changes.
When conjugating regular -ar, -er, and -ir verbs in the conditional tense, you simply take the
entire verb inﬁnitive (don’t drop anything) and then add the imperfect verb endings you use
for -er and -ir verbs.
Check out the following conjugation charts for each verb type.

Waffling with the Conditional Tense
The conditional tense is great for wafﬂing on issues. You can state any impossible condition
or set of conditions you like and then say you would’ve done something if only that condi-
tion or set of conditions had been in place. It works in every language — English, Spanish,
Italian, you name it — and you don’t even have to be a politician to use it.

You often use the conditional tense in a sentence with two verbs, in which one verb states
the condition or problem and then the second verb states, in the conditional, what you’d do
under that condition or if faced with that problem. For example, in the sentence, “If I had a
million dollars, I’d travel around the world,” the ﬁrst verb states a situation or condition,
and the second verb expresses what you would do if that situation or condition existed.
A sentence with an if clause in it requires the subjunctive mood (See Chapter 12). None of
the practice activities in this section uses any if clauses.
Say whether you’d do any of the following if you had a million dollars by answering Sí or No.
Here’s an example:
Sí ¿Investirías en el mercado de valores? (Would you invest in the stock market?)

_____ ¿Viajarías alrededor del mundo?

_____ ¿Comprarías una casa muy grande y ostentoso?

Getting Wishy-Washy with the
Subjunctive Mood
In This Chapter
 Transforming verbs into the regular present subjunctive
 Injecting a little doubt with the subjunctive
 Expressing impersonal opinions or unﬁnished actions
 More uses for the subjunctive
T
he subjunctive mood is tentative and uncertain. It enables you to wish, desire, and sup-
pose, whenever reality falls short of expectations. It allows you to put all your short-
comings behind you and suppose, just for the time being, that you’re something you’re not
or that certain conditions are in place that aren’t really in place — “If only I were rich . . .”
The subjunctive mood also enables you to add a pinch of doubt to statements and offer
impersonal opinions, so you can express yourself without being overly committal. It’s an
empowering grammatical construction.
In this chapter, you explore how to form the regular present tense subjunctive conjugations
for -ar, -er, and -ir verbs, and you discover the various uses of the subjunctive, so you know
when to use it and to what effect. After you ﬁnd out how to form the subjunctive and when
and why to use it, you’re well-equipped for putting it to work in your own conversations and
written communications.
The subjunctive in Spanish is called a mood or a mode rather than a tense, because it indi-
cates the way in which the action or state of being is conceived or the attitude that the
speaker has toward what she’s saying.
Making the Present Subjunctive Work for You
The ﬁrst step in using the subjunctive is investigating how to conjugate it. Although the
method is straightforward, it varies depending on whether you’re conjugating -ar or -er and
-ir verbs. Following are the differences:
 For -ar verbs, start with the yo form, drop the -o, and add the regular endings for 
present-tense -er verbs. (Use the third-person singular ending for yo.)
 For -er and -ir verbs, start with the yo form, drop the -o, and add the regular -ar 
present-tense endings. (Again, use the third-person singular ending for yo.)
You can start with the verb’s root and add the endings, but then you have to deal with sev-
eral exceptions. By starting with the yo form and dropping the -o, you have fewer exceptions.

132
Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 
Regular -ar present-tense subjunctive endings:
yo -e
nosotros/as -emos
tú -es
vosotros/as -éis
él, ella -e
ellos/as -en
Ud.
Uds.
The verb hablar is always ready and willing to lend itself as an example, so I’ve included it
here. Put hablar in the yo form, hablo, and then drop the -o and add the endings as speci-
ﬁed. Here’s what you get:
hablar = to speak
hable
hablemos
hables
habléis
hable
hablen
Ellos hablen. = They may speak.
Because the subjunctive mood expresses doubt, desire, uncertainty, and opinion, may is the
best translation for the model verbs, but keep in mind that the word may may not always
apply.
Regular -er and -ir present-tense subjunctive endings:
yo -a
nosotros/as -amos
tú -as
vosotros/as -áis
él, ella -a
ellos/as -an
Ud.
Uds.
Using comer as the model -er verb, start with the yo form, and then drop the -o and add the
regular -ar present-tense endings. Here’s what you get:
comer = to eat
coma
comamos
comas
comáis
coma
coman
Yo coma. = I may eat.
The -ir verbs follow the same routine. Using vivir as the model -ir verb, start with the yo form,
and then drop the -o and add the regular -ar present-tense endings. Here’s what you get:
vivir = to live
viva
vivamos
vivas
viváis
viva
vivan
Ud. viva. = You (formal) may live.

Staying on top of spelling changes
Several of the spelling changes come into play with the present-tense subjunctive conjuga-
tions. Note the following spelling changes:
 z to c in front of e:
empezar (to begin) becomes yo empiece (that I may begin)
 hard c to qu in front of e:
buscar (to look for) becomes yo busque (that I may look for)
 hard g to gu in front of e:
llegar (to arrive) becomes yo llegue (that I may arrive)
 gu to g in front of a:
seguir (to follow) becomes yo siga (that I may follow)
 soft g to j in front of a:
proteger (to protect) becomes yo proteja (that I may protect)
Keeping up on stem changes
Stem-changing verbs in the subjunctive don’t change stems in the nosotros or vosotros con-
jugations (which is the same as in the present tense), except in the following instances:
 In -ir verbs with the stem change of o to ue, the o changes to u.
dormir (to sleep) becomes
nosotros durmamos (that we may sleep)
vosotros durmáis (that you may sleep)
 In -ir verbs with the stem change of e to ie, the e changes to i.
mentir (to lie) becomes
nosotros mintamos (that we may lie)
vosotros mintáis (that you may lie)
 In -ir verbs with the stem change of e to i, the e changes to i.
pedir (to ask for) becomes
nosotros pidamos (that we may become)
vosotros pidáis (that you may become)
Put the following verbs into their correct present tense subjunctive forms based on the sub-
jects given. Here’s what I mean:
Uds./pasar = pasen
1.
nosotros/abrir = _______________
2.
tú/cerrar = _______________

Expressing Your Innermost (and 
Not-So-Innermost) Desires
One of the coolest features of the subjunctive mood is that it enables you to express desire,
hope, or preference; offer suggestions, recommendations, or advice; and even insist or beg
for what you want. In other words, even though you may not get what you want, you can
certainly ask for it, hope for it, and even insist on it. These expressions of desire, hope, and
preference require a combination of two clauses:
 The main clause expresses the desire, doubt, or opinion in the indicative mood (state-
ment of fact): for example, “I hope . . . ,” “Sally advises . . . ,” or “Pedro prefers . . .”
 The subordinate clause describes that which is being desired, doubted, or offered as
an opinion, and you express it in the subjunctive mood. Using the ﬁrst main clause
(from the previous bullet) as an example: “I hope that my package arrives tomorrow.”
This section introduces you to the most common expressions of desire used in main clauses
that require the subjunctive in the subordinate clauses. These expressions of desire are
verbs that relay hope, preference, or even a recommendation.
The verbs in Table 12-1 express what the subject wants or would like to happen, but the 
outcome is uncertain, so the subjunctive subordinate clause is required. Stem changes are
in parentheses.
Table 12-1
Verbs That Express Desire
Verb
Translation
aconsejar
to advise
esperar
to hope
insistir en
to insist on
mandar
to order
pedir (e to i)
to ask for, to request
preferir (e to ie)
to prefer
134
Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 

Verb
Translation
querer
to want
recomendar
to recommend
rogar (o to ue)
to pray, to beg
sugerir (e to ie)
to suggest
When the verb in the main clause expresses desire, the verb in the subordinate clause must
be in the subjunctive. The conjunction que (that) connects the two clauses, and the subor-
dinate clause (the one that requires the subjunctive) expresses uncertainty as to whether
the action in the action actually occurs.
In the following examples, the conjunction is underlined, and the subordinate clause is in
italics:
 Él recomienda que yo llegue temprano. = He recommends that I arrive early.
 Ellos preﬁeren que nosotros no paguemos. = They prefer that we not pay.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish. Here’s an example:
The counselor advises that the students study abroad for one year.

Conveying Doubt, Impersonal Opinion,
or Incomplete Action
The subjunctive mood typically is positive, enabling subjects to hope, prefer, and insist, but
it doesn’t need to be positive. It simply needs to be uncertain, and uncertainty can take
many forms, including:
 Doubt: For the optimist, the subjunctive offers hope. For the pessimist, the subjunctive
offers doubt. The subject doubts or can’t imagine that something or other happens.
 Impersonal opinion: When you want to put forth an opinion without taking credit or
blame for it, you can use the subjunctive to express impersonal opinion. In English, the
key word in expressing impersonal opinion is it’s. For example, “It’s important that . . . ,”
“It’s necessary that . . . ,” or “It’s preferable that . . .”
 Incomplete action: Some connecting words and phrases, such as unless, before, and
in case, introduce subordinate clauses that express incomplete action. In such cases,
the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty, because the action has not yet been 
completed.
Voicing your doubts and reservations
Like English, Spanish uses several words to express doubt, including, of course, the verb
doubt itself. Each verb that expresses some form of doubt must be followed by the subjunc-
tive in order to convey the sense of uncertainty. The list in Table 12-2 contains common
verbs that express doubt in Spanish. 
Table 12-2
Verbs That Express Doubt
Verb
Translation
dudar
to doubt 
no creer
to not believe
no estar convencido/a de

no estar seguro/a de

Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 

Verb
Translation
no parecer

to not think
no suponer
to not suppose
temer
to suspect, to fear
You could put together a sentence like this one to show that you’re uncertain:
Yo dudo que ella llegue a tiempo. = I doubt that she arrives on time.
Although the verbs listed in the negative use the subjunctive in their subordinate clauses,
these same verbs require the indicative when used in the afﬁrmative.
Expressing impersonal opinion
When you want to express an opinion but don’t necessarily want that opinion attributed to
you, you can use the subjunctive to express impersonal opinion. The list of commonly used
Spanish expressions in Table 12-3 state an impersonal opinion and require the subjunctive
in the subordinate clause.
These expressions convey impersonal opinion by expressing emotion, uncertainty, unreal-
ity, or an indirect or implied command.

Here’s a sentence that expresses impersonal opionion:
Es necesario que ellos trabajen más. = It’s necessary that they work more.
Making one action conditional upon another
When one action is conditional upon another uncertain action, you use the subjunctive to
convey that uncertainty. In the sentence, “I’ll clean their room as soon as they leave,” for
example, the main clause, “I’ll clean their room,” is conditional upon the subordinate clause,
“as soon as they leave.” Several connecting phrases cue the use of the subjunctive, includ-
ing the following terms in Table 12-4.

a menos que

When the subordinate clause describes uncertain, incomplete action, the verb in the main
clause usually is in the future tense. (For more information about the future tense, see
Chapter 10.)
Here’s a sentence that uses the future tense and the subjunctive mood:
Yo le hablaré tan pronto como llegue. = I’ll speak will him as soon as he arrives.

Wrapping Up the Uses of the Subjunctive
The subjunctive is incredibly versatile, and you use it for even more than expressing doubt,
voicing an impersonal opinion, or setting up a conditional action. In this section, I introduce
you to further situations that call for the subjunctive. You can use the subjunctive mood
 In an adjectival clause if the antecedent is someone or something that is indeﬁnite, neg-
ative, vague, or nonexistent. For example:
Ellos buscan un cocinero quien = They are looking for a cook who 
prepare comida china
prepares Chinese food.
No hay nadie aquí quien corra = There is no one here who runs faster than her.
más rapido que ella.
¿Hay alguién en tu escuela = Does anyone at your school speak Russian?
que hable ruso?
 After the adverbs acaso, quizás, and tal vez, which all mean perhaps. For example:
Quizás ellos lleguen mañana. = Perhaps they will arrive tomorrow.
 After aunque (although or even if) if the action has not yet occurred. For example:
Aunque no gane, lo intentará. = Although he may not win, he will try.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish. Here’s an example:
Perhaps he studies more. = Quizás él estudie más.

Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 

Chapter 13
Conveying Uncertainty about the Past
with the Imperfect Subjunctive
In This Chapter
 Wishing in the past tense
 Doubting and offering opinions about the past
 Expressing mannerly requests with querer and poder
 Presuming in the past with if clauses
 Making suppositions with as if or as though
H
indsight isn’t always 20/20. Sometimes it’s more like 50/50. You may believe that some-
thing happened or hope it happened rather than knowing it happened. In Spanish, you
use the imperfect subjunctive to express uncertainty about the past. The good news is that
unlike the indicative past tense, which gives you the choice between the preterit and the
imperfect (Chapter 9), the subjunctive uses only the imperfect. Whenever the verb in the
main clause is in the past tense (whether preterit, imperfect, or past perfect), the subordi-
nate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive (Chapter 13).
In this chapter, you investigate how to form the imperfect subjunctive and then use it in var-
ious statements to express wishes, doubt, or opinions about the past.
The indicative mood states facts. The subjunctive mood expresses subjective observations,
wishes, desires, doubts, preferences, opinions, and anything else that is not an objective
fact.
Forming the Imperfect Subjunctive
Every tense and mood has its own quirky formation that you must follow to conjugate the
verb. In the case of the imperfect subjunctive, here’s what you do:
1. Start with the third-person plural form of the preterite (Chapter 9).
2. Drop the -ron ending to establish the verb’s base.
This verb base is used for all verbs whether they’re regular, irregular, stem-changing, or
spelling-change verbs.
3. Add the common endings from the list that follows:
yo -ra
nosotros/as -ramos
tú -ras
vosotros/as -rais
él, ella -ra
ellos/as -ran
Ud.
Uds.

146
Part III: Working Out with the Remaining Simple Tenses 
You can use the following endings, instead:
yo -se
nosotros/as -semos
tú -ses
vosotros/as -seis
él, ella -se
ellos/as -sen
Ud.
Uds.
The following tables respectively show an example of an -ar, -er, and -ir regular verb conju-
gated into the imperfect subjunctive.
hablar = to speak
hablara
habláramos
hablaras
hablarais
hablara
hablaran
Mi padre prohibió que yo hablara por teléfono después de las 11:00 de la noche. = 
My father prohibited that I talk on the phone after 11:00 p.m.
comer = to eat
comiera
comiéramos
comieras
comierais
comiera
comieran
Mi padre dudaba que nosotros comiéramos toda la pizza. = My father doubted that we ate the
whole pizza.
abrir = to open
abriera
abriéramos
abrieras
abrierais
abriera
abrieran
Ellos deseaban que su padre abriera la puerta. = They wished that his father would open the door.
The vowel that precedes the nosotros ending is always accented.

vided, as I show you in the following example:

10.

Wishing, Doubting, and Opining About the Past
Whenever you express uncertainty about a past action, you use the imperfect subjunctive,
but several key words and circumstances can also clue you in to the need for the imperfect
subjunctive, like the following:
 Verbs, such as desear (to wish), prohibir (to forbid), and creer (to believe), when
used to introduce a subordinate clause concerning an uncertain event that occurred
in the past
 Expressions of personal opinion about past events that are introduced with que (that)
 The conjunctions a ﬁn de que (in order that or so that) and sin que (without)
Introducing uncertainty with uncertain verbs
Some verbs naturally call for the use of the subjunctive; some of these verbs are listed in
Chapter 12. Table 13-1 shows a list of additional verbs that, when followed by que, always
require the subjunctive in the que clause:
Table 13-1

alegrarse de que

prohibir que

subjunctive.

dependent clause. Table 13-2 gives some additional expressions in the imperfect tense that
require the imperfect subjunctive.

Introducing uncertainty with uncertain 
conjunctions
Conjunctions smooth the transition from the main clause to the subordinate clause. When
these conjunctions express uncertainty, they must be followed by the subjunctive.
Following are two conjunctions that always require the use of the subjunctive.
 a ﬁn de que = in order that, so that
 sin que = without
Using the preceding impersonal expressions and conjunctions, translate the following sen-
tences into Spanish, as I show you here:
It was interesting that they didn’t say anything about their mother.

Ordering and Asking Politely with
the Imperfect Subjunctive
In polite society, you don’t tell your host, “I want this or that.” You say something like, “I
would like this or that.” You don’t ask someone, “Can you do such and such?” Instead, you
say something like “Would you please do such and such?” Proper manners also are impor-
tant in Spanish. To express yourself politely in Spanish, you use the imperfect subjunctive
along with one of the following two words:
 Querer, which literally means to want. Rather than using the verb in the straight pres-
ent tense, which would translate rather brusquely to “I want,” use the imperfect sub-
junctive, which adds a much more subtle and polite sound to the request. “Quisiera
una hamburguesa,” for example, translates as, “I would like a hamburger.”
 Poder, which literally means to be able to or can. Rather than use the present tense
(which translates as “Can you do such and such?”) or the future tense (which trans-
lates to “Will you do such and such?”) use the imperfect subjunctive. “¿Si pudieras,
lavarías los platos?” for example, translates very politely as, “If you could, would you
wash the dishes?”
Translate these orders and requests into Spanish using the imperfect subjunctive, as I show
you in the following example.

Speaking of Possibilities with If
The word if is packed to the gills with uncertainty; hence, it always calls for the use of the
subjunctive.

a la universidad.
college.
In this example, you’re starting the sentence with the subordinate clause, which requires
that were be in the imperfect subjunctive. The main clause, I would go to college, is in the
indicative (Chapter 12).

Supposing with As if or As though
As if . . . has achieved slang status in the English language, essentially meaning I can’t
believe what you’re saying. In Spanish, the phrase hasn’t quite achieved slang status, but it
does imply a sense that you’re assuming something is true. To say as if or as though in
Spanish, you use the expression como si.
When a subordinate clause begins with como si, the verb is in the imperfect subjunctive.
The main clause can either be in the present, the past, or the conditional.
Here are some examples of sentences using as if and/or as though.
Ella actuaba como si ganara el premio. = She acted as though she had won the prize.
Él hablaba como si supiera todas

Coping with Irregular Verbs

In this part . . . 
E
very crowd has a few irregulars — rule breakers 
who simply choose to be different. When it comes to
Spanish verbs, the rule breakers are the irregular verbs —
verbs that drastically change their stems or spellings
through their conjugations. They’re Spanish verb outlaws,
following no predictable patterns and heeding no rules or
regulations. The only way to master these rogue verbs is
to study them and memorize their conjugation charts.
The chapters in this part introduce the most common
irregular verbs by tense and mood, so you can quickly
identify them and master their conjugation charts. Each
chapter focuses on a specific tense or mood to give you a
command of irregularities in the present, preterit, imper-
fect, future, conditional, present subjunctive, and imper-
fect subjunctive.

Chapter 14
Dealing with Present Irregularities
In This Chapter
 Meeting the present-tense rule breakers
 Coming to terms with verbs that are irregular only in their yo form
 Rubbing elbows with the most commonly used present-tense irregulars
E
ven the present tense has its irregularities — verbs that refuse to conform to the rules
of proper conjugations. In Spanish, verbs that are irregular in the present tense fall into
two categories:
 Verbs that are irregular only in the yo form.
 Verbs that are irregular in any or all forms.
Verbs that are irregular only in the yo pose no great challenge, because for the most part
they’re regular. After you learn the single irregularity, they’re pretty easy to deal with. Verbs
that are irregular in any and all forms pose a greater challenge, simply because they’re so
unpredictable. The irregularities follow no set pattern. To deal with them, you have two
choices — memorize the verbs and their irregularities or keep your conjugation charts
handy.
In this chapter, you encounter the most common verbs that have irregular formations in the
present tense, and you ﬁnd out how to deal with them.
Meeting Common Verbs with Irregular Yo Forms
Verbs with yo form irregularities aren’t just irregular — they’re pretty weird. You have verbs
like caber (to ﬁt), which morphs into quepo, and verbs like dar (to give), which becomes
doy. Neither rhyme nor reason seem to govern their irregularities.
Table 14-1 lists the more commonly used irregular verbs. They are presented in their inﬁni-
tive forms with their meanings and then in their yo forms.

To conjugate these verbs into any other form, you simply follow the regular conjugation
rules for either an -ar, -er, or -ir verb (see Chapter 2).
Hanging Out with the Present Tense Irregulars
Most irregular verbs are consistent in their weirdness. They break the rules in all of their
present-tense forms; although you’ll quickly see that some of these verbs have regularly
formed nosotros/as and vosotros/as forms.
Because these verbs are so irregular, the best way to deal with them is to memorize their
conjugation charts (by rote), so you won’t have to think twice when conjugating them.
The following charts list ﬁve of the most commonly used present-tense irregular verbs. I
include each verb’s meaning and conjugated forms.
decir = to tell
digo
decimos
dices
decís

Yo digo. = I tell.

 Getting a handle on variations and eccentricities by grouping like verbs
I
rregularities in the preterit tense can make your brain hurt. They’re not all that confus-
ing; they’re simply more numerous and varied than most. To help you cope, this chapter
groups like verbs to lend some order to the chaos. This grouping should help you under-
stand and memorize the various formations so they become second nature.
To survive and succeed, you need to rely on your knowledge and understanding of the pres-
ent tense and what you already know about verbs. When you put it all together, the preterit
tense should form a cohesive whole. Not to worry — the excessive list of irregularities that
accompanies the preterit tense is not found anywhere else! Thank goodness for small
favors.
If you’re not comfortable with irregular verbs in the present tense, you may want to review
Chapter 14 before tackling irregularities in the preterit tense (deﬁned in Chapter 9).
Yo! Spelling Changes in the Preterit Yo Form
The preterit tense has several irregularities that are manifested as spelling changes or, if
you prefer fancier terminology, orthographic changes. Chapter 8 discusses these changes in
detail and provides exercises to hone your skills. You need to remain aware of such spelling
changes when dealing with irregularities in the preterit tense.
Spanish verbs experience the following three orthographic changes in the preterit, and they
occur only in the ﬁrst person singular, or yo form:
 Verbs ending in -gar change the g to gu in front of an e.
pagar becomes yo pagué = I paid.
 Verbs ending in -car change the c to qu in front of an e.
buscar becomes yo busqué = I looked for.
 Verbs ending in -zar change the z to c in front of an e.
comenzar becomes yo comencé = I began.

168
Part IV: Coping with Irregular Verbs 
Give the correct yo form preterit conjugations of the following verbs, as I show you in the
following example:
chocar = choqué
1.
tocar = _______________
2.
practicar = _______________

8.
empezar = _______________
9.
clasiﬁcar = _______________
10.
tragar = _______________
Changing Stems in the Preterit
As I explain in Chapter 8, some verbs experience stem changes when you conjugate them. In
the present tense, stem changes occur in all three verbs types: -ar, -er, and -ir. In the
preterit, however, only -ir verbs experience stem changes, and they occur only in the third-
person/you formal singular (él, ella, Ud.) and plural (ellos/as, Uds.) forms of the verbs.
These two factors narrow down the changes quite a bit. The following are the three types of
changes that occur in the preterit:
 In verbs that change o to ue in the present, the o changes to u.
 In verbs that change e to ie in the present, the e changes to i.
 In verbs that change e to i in the present, the e changes to i.
In the preterit tense, stem changes occur only in the third-person singular and third-person
plural forms.
Table 15-1 lists some verbs that have these stem changes.

Following the Crowd with a Few
Representative Verbs
When you’re dealing with irregular verbs, sometimes the best way to proceed is to snatch
a couple representatives from the crowd, learn their irregularities, and then apply what
you ﬁnd out to similar verbs. This section introduces some sample irregular verbs that 
function as representatives for various small groups of verbs that behave in much the
same way.
169
Chapter 15: Confronting Irregularities in the Preterit Tense

Tagging along with decir and traer
The two verbs decir (to say or to tell) and traer (to bring) have a small group of followers,
but when you’re dealing with the preterit, you take any help you can get. You can ﬁnd out
how to conjugate these two verbs and then apply the rules to similar verbs.
Here’s how these representative verbs morph in their conjugated forms:
decir = to say, to tell
dije
dijimos
dijiste
dijisteis
dijo
dijeron
Yo dije. = I said.
traer = to bring
traje
trajimos
trajiste
trajisteis
trajo
trajeron
Él trajo. = He brought.
Following are several verbs that conjugate in the preterit like traer:
 atraer = to attract
 distraer = to distract
 retraer = to bring back
 sustraer = to remove
Continuing the pattern with dar and ver
The verbs dar (to give) and ver (to see) have exactly the same preterit conjugated endings
and a very small group of followers. What’s interesting is that the verb ver actually follows
the regular conjugation rules for -er preterit verbs except that it omits the accent marks on
the ﬁrst and third person singular/you formal (yo and él, ella, Ud.) forms.
Here’s what these two verbs look like in the preterit:
dar = to give
di
dimos
diste
disteis
dio
dieron
Yo di. = I gave.

Eleven freaky verbs that share their irregularities
Now here are some freaky verbs that look and behave more like a group! These 11 verbs all
have irregular stems in the preterit, and they all share the same irregular preterit endings.
Here are the endings that all 11 of these verbs use:
yo -e
nosotros/as -imos
tú -iste
vosotros/as -isteis
él, ella -o
ellos/as -ieron
Ud.
Uds.
These irregular preterit endings use no accent marks.
Table 15-2 lists the 11 verbs. Each verb is presented in its inﬁnitive form, with the deﬁnition
and then the irregular preterit stem.

To further complicate the scenario, some verbs have the audacity to change their meaning
slightly in the preterit, so before you get into any heavy-duty exercises, expand your aware-
ness of these subtle shifts in meaning. Table 15-3 introduces these meaning-shifters and 
provides their deﬁnitions in the present and preterit tenses, so you can compare them 
side-by-side.

Changing i to y in the preterit
In English, some nouns change y to i in the plural and add es. In Spanish, the verbs do the
changing, and the i changes to y. A small group of -er and -ir verbs follow this pattern. When
the -er or -ir ending is preceded by i in the third-person singular (él, ella, Ud.) and plural
(ellos/as, Uds.) and a written accent appears over the letter i in all the other forms, the
ending changes to a y. Here’s an example:
creer = to believe
creí
creímos
creíste
creísteis
creyó
creyeron
Nosotros creímos. = We believed.
Following are some other verbs that follow this pattern:
 (reﬂexive pronoun +) caer = to fall (down)
 leer = to read
 oír = to hear
 poseer = to possess
 proveer = to provide
This rule has a couple exceptions. The verb traer (to bring) and the other verbs formed
with traer don’t follow this conjugation pattern. See the earlier section “A group to follow
decir and traer.” Also omitted are verbs ending in -guir, such as the verb seguir (to follow),
because the u is not pronounced but merely serves to create a hard g sound.
Constructing destructive verbs like destruir
When you feel like getting a little destructive with the verb destruir (to destroy) and other
verbs that end in -uir, follow the i-to-y rule spelled out in the previous section, but be aware
of one major exception. The written accent mark over the i is used only in the ﬁrst-person
singular (yo) form.
173
Chapter 15: Confronting Irregularities in the Preterit Tense

I conjugated destruir here, so you can see what I mean.
destruir = to destroy
destruí
destruimos
destruiste
destruisteis
destruyó
destruyeron
Vosotros destruisteis. = You (plural, familiar) destroyed.
Following is a list of verbs that conjugate in the preterit according to the pattern shown
here with destruir:
 construir = to build, to construct
 contribuir = to contribute
 ﬂuir = to ﬂow
 huir = to ﬂee, to run away
 incluir = to include
 inﬂuir = to inﬂuence
Sharing irregularities: The verbs ser and ir
The verbs ser and ir are a couple unique oddballs that form their own dysfunctional duet.
They pretend that they’re two distinct verbs, but in the preterit, they look and behave
exactly the same way. Just looking at them, it’s tough to tell them apart. The only way to tell
the difference is to obtain the meaning from the context in which the verb is used. Just look
at the following conjugation chart to see what I mean:
ser = to be
ir = to go
fui
fuimos
fuiste
fuisteis
fue
fueron
Yo fui su amigo. = I was his friend.
Yo fui al parquet. = I went to the park.
Producing the preterit with verbs ending in -ucir
Not quite as weird as the verb ser and ir are verbs that end in -ucir, such as the model verb
I’ve chosen for this section traducir (to translate). Examine the following conjugation chart
to determine how to conjugate traducir and verbs just like it.
traducir = to translate
traduje
tradujimos
tradujiste
tradujisteis
trudujo
trudujeron
Ella trudujo. = She translated.
174
Part IV: Coping with Irregular Verbs 

The verb traducir has a small group of followers, including the following verbs:
 conducir = to drive, to lead
 deducir = to deduce
 introducir = to introduce
 producir = to produce
 reducir = to reduce, to cut down

Unveiling Irregularities in the Imperfect,
Future, and Conditional Tenses
In This Chapter
 Taking a trip back to the regular imperfect tense
 Introducing three irregular imperfect verbs
 Presenting the irregular future and conditional verbs
T
he imperfect, future, and conditional tenses are the most regular of the bunch, so I lump
them all together in this chapter and deal with them as a group. Only three verbs have
irregularities in the imperfect tense, so they’re a snap. The future and the conditional tenses
are almost as easy to manage, because they have so much in common — they share the
same irregular stems when conjugated.
For comparison purposes, this chapter begins with a review of the formation of the regular
imperfect tense before unveiling some of the more irregular verb formations. Then it intro-
duces you to a trio of verbs that have some extremely irregular formations in the imperfect
tense. Finally, you get a brief primer, with exercises of course, to hone your skills with the
verbs that have irregularities in the future and conditional tenses.
Revisiting the Formation
of the Regular Imperfect
When it comes to conjugations, calling the imperfect tense “imperfect” is a misnomer; it’s
the most regular of all the tenses. Almost all Spanish verbs are formed regularly in the
imperfect tense. Just remember these two simple rules:
For -ar verbs, drop the -ar ending and then add the following endings:
yo -aba
nosotros/as -ábamos
tú -abas
vosotros/as -abais
él, ella -aba
ellos/as -aban
Ud.
Uds.
For -er and -ir verbs, drop the -er or -ir ending and then add the following endings:
yo -ía
nosotros/as -íamos
tú -ías
vosotros/as -íais
él, ella -ía
-ellos/as -ían
Ud.
Ud.

Meeting the Tres Amigos: Three Irregular
Imperfect Verbs
The following three verbs are the only verbs in the Spanish language that are formed irregu-
larly in the imperfect tense:
 ir = to go
 ser = to be
 ver = to see
The conjugations of these verbs don’t have anything in common with one another, but with
only three verbs to remember, who’s complaining? The tables that follow present the conju-
gations for these three verbs.
ir = to go
iba
íbamos
ibas
ibais
iba
iban
Vosotros íbais. = You (plural, familiar) used to go.

ser = to be
era
éramos
eras
erais
Ud. era
eran
Tú eras. = You used to be.
ver = to see
veía
veíamos
veías
veíais
veía
veían
Nosotros veíamos. = We used to see.
In all of the imperfect verb formations whether regular or irregular, the ﬁrst-person (yo) and
third-person/you formal (él, ella, Ud.) singular forms are the same.
In the imperfect, you’re expressing past actions that used to take place in a nonspeciﬁc or
ongoing past period of time.

Rounding Up Three Types 
of Irregular Future Verbs
The Spanish language has a dozen basic verbs that have irregular stems in the future tense.
A dozen verbs aren’t all that much to remember, but they’re easier to master if you divvy
them up into three groups, which is what I do in this section. The groups are based on how
the irregular stems are formed.
These verbs still use the regular future endings, which are: -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, and -án.
Group 1: The verbs in this group (Table 16-1) keep their regular inﬁnitive stem with the
addition of the letter r.

irregular conditional, because the two share the same stems. After you commit the 12 basic
verbs and their irregular stems to memory, you simply add the regular conditional verb
endings and — voilá! — you have the irregular conditional.
Here are the conditional verb endings:
yo -ía
nosotros/as -íamos
tú -ías
vosotros/as -íais
él, ella -ía
ellos/as -ían
Ud.
Uds.
The same derivative verbs that were shown in the previous section follow this same irregu-
lar conjugation pattern. See Table 16-5:

Mastering Subjectivity with the
Irregular Present Subjunctive
In This Chapter
 Revisiting the present subjunctive with a few irregularities
 Changing a verb’s spelling to maintain its pronunciation in the present subjunctive
 Conjugating the six verbs with irregular present subjunctive forms
T
he subjunctive mood is the mood of uncertainty, doubt, and impersonal opinion. Adding
to the uncertainty is the fact that several verbs don’t follow the standard operating pro-
cedure for the subjunctive mood. Some verbs demand spelling changes or stem changes in
the subjunctive mood. Others follow no pattern at all.
This chapter deals speciﬁcally with the irregular present subjunctive verbs and their conju-
gations. If you’re looking for verbs that are better behaved in the present subjunctive,
review the following:
 The present subjunctive in Chapter 12, including the formation of the regular, stem-
changing, and spelling changing verbs.
 Verbs with irregular yo forms, such as conocer, hacer, salir, and tener, as I discuss
throughout this book. All verbs are considered to be regular in the present subjunctive
formation if they use their present-tense yo form followed by the appropriate endings,
even if the yo form is irregular.
Grappling with Spelling Changes
Spelling changes occur in certain verb conjugations to keep the pronunciation of the 
conjugated verb consistent with the pronunciation of the verb in its inﬁnitive form. (See
Chapter 8.) In the present subjunctive, the following spelling changes must occur to main-
tain proper pronunciation:
 The z changes to c in front of e, as in the verb empezar (to begin). The present tense
yo form is empiezo. The present subjunctive conjugation is presented in the table that
follows:

192
Part IV: Coping with Irregular Verbs 
empezar = to begin
empiece
empecemos*
empieces
empecéis*
empiece
empiecen
La profesora duda que los estudiantes empiecen la tarea sin su ayuda. = The professor
doubts that the students would (might) start the assignment without her help.
*The stem changing -ar and -er verbs don’t stem change in the nosotros or vosotros forms 
in the present-tense subjunctive.
Other verbs with spelling changes like empezar include the following. Note that
almorzar also has a ue stem change.
almorzar (ue) = to eat lunch
lanzar = to hurl
tropezar = to stumble
 Hard c changes to qu in front of e, as in the verb buscar (to look for). The present-tense
yo form is busco. The present subjunctive conjugation is presented in the table that
follows:
buscar = to look for
busque
busquemos
busques
busquéis
busque
busquen
No vamos a encontrar el dinero a menos que lo busquemos por todas partes. = We won’t ﬁnd the
money unless we look for it everywhere.
Other verbs that conjugate like buscar include:
arrancar = to root up (out), to boot up (a computer)
sacar = to get, to take out
secar = to dry
 Hard g changes to gu in front of e, as in the verb llegar (to arrive). The present tense yo
form is llego. The present subjunctive conjugation is presented in the table that follows:
llegar = to arrive
llegue
lleguemos
llegues
lleguéis
llegue
lleguen
Quizá él no llegue a tiempo. = Perhaps he won’t arrive on time.
Other verbs that conjugate like llegar include the following. Jugar and rogar also have
ue stem changes.
apagar = to put out, to turn off
jugar (ue) = to play (a sport or a game)
pagar = to pay
rogar (ue) = to pray, to beg

Digging Up the Irregular Subjunctive Verbs
The bad news is that some verbs refuse to follow the pattern that most verbs follow for the
present subjunctive; they don’t use the present-tense yo form followed by the appropriate
subjunctive endings. The good news is that you have only six such verbs to deal with. The
best approach is to look all six of these verbs in the eye and memorize their present sub-
junctive conjugations as presented right here.

Part V
Getting Help with the
Helping Verb Haber

In this part . . . 
T
he verb haber is like a turbocharger for other Spanish
verbs. With the addition of haber, a verb in the past
tense can become more past, a conditional statement can
be completed, and a future action can be finished. Haber
turns did into had done, would into would have, and will
into will have. It’s a helping verb that completes an action.
By adding haber to your toolbox, you equip yourself with
a whole new set of tenses — the seven compound tenses.
The chapters in this part introduce you to the verb haber
and show you how to use it to form the seven compound
tenses.

Chapter 18
Presenting the Present Perfect
In This Chapter
 Brushing up on the present tense forms of the helping verb haber
 Forming the regular past participles for -ar, -er, and -ir verbs
 Meeting some common irregular past participles face to face
 Putting it all together to form the present perfect
E
ach simple tense has a corresponding compound tense — seven simple tenses, seven
compound tenses. The compound tenses make actions perfect or complete. In English,
for example, you eat in the present, but you have eaten in the present perfect. In other words,
you’re done eating in the present tense. Granted, the distinction between the past and the
present perfect can be a little subtle in any language, but you’ll get the hang of it.
Forming any compound tense in Spanish is essentially a two-step process:
1. Begin with the helping verb haber, which translates as to have in the desired tense (the
present tense in this chapter).
2. Tack on the past participle of the main verb.
Voilá! You have the main verb expressed in the desired compound tense.
This chapter introduces the ﬁrst of the seven compound tenses — the present perfect. You
ﬁrst investigate the present tense forms of haber. After that, you ﬁnd out how to form the
regular past participles. The chapter wraps up by introducing a few commonly used verbs
that have irregular past participles.
Laying the Groundwork: Conjugating Haber
The secret to conjugating verbs in any compound tense is discovering how to conjugate the
verb haber (to have) in the desired tense. After you check that out, you simply tack on the
past participle of the main verb, and you’re done. Here’s the verb haber conjugated in the
present tense:
haber = (helping verb) to have
he 
hemos

Yo he hablado. = I have spoken.

Part V: Getting Help with the Helping Verb Haber 
Making Past Participles Out 
of -ar, -er, and -ir Verbs
Every verb has a past participle that expresses a completed action, such as taken, spoken,
and danced. Forming the past participle in English has probably become second nature to
you. In Spanish, you simply need to observe the following two rules for forming the regular
past participles of -ar, -er, and -ir verbs:
 For -ar verbs, drop the -ar of the inﬁnitive form and add -ado.
 For -er and -ir verbs, drop the -er or -ir of the inﬁnitive form and add -ido.
Forming and using the past participles is equivalent to using -ed or -en endings in English.
Table 18-1 shows examples of each type of verb:

Boning Up on Irregular Past Participles
If all verbs were as structured and disciplined as the regular -ar, -er, and -ir verbs, life as a
student of the Spanish language would be a snap. Unfortunately, the Spanish language has 
a hefty collection of verbs that have irregular past participles. To keep these verbs from
becoming too unwieldy, I’ve broken them down into the following two groups:
 Group 1 consists of -er and -ir verbs in which a vowel immediately precedes the inﬁni-
tive ending. These verbs form their past participles regularly, but you must add an
accent mark over the i in the -ido ending. Verbs that end in -uir are not included. No
accent mark is necessary when a verb such as construir (to construct) is put into the
past participle form, construido. Table 18-2 includes some Group 1 verbs:

tern and thus must be memorized. Table 18-3 includes several common verbs whose

Pumping Iron with the Present Perfect
Now that you know how to conjugate the verb haber in the present tense and form the past
participle of some common verbs, you have everything you need to know to be able to form
the present perfect. It’s time to put it all together and ﬂex your muscles with your new com-
pound tense. As you ﬂex, keep the following rules and regulations in mind:
 Use the present perfect to express or describe actions that have happened recently
and/or actions that still hold true in the present, as in the sentences: “She has arrived,”
or “They have lived here for two years (and still do).”
 Never separate the verb haber and the past participle with any other words.
 When using an object pronoun with the present perfect, the pronoun must precede the
conjugated form of the verb haber.
The sample sentences in the list that follows show the use of the present perfect:
Yo he terminado la carta. = I have ﬁnished the letter.
Ellos han empezado la casa nueva. = They have started the new house.
Ella ha leído aquella novela. = She has read that novel.
Write Sí or No to indicate whether you’ve done the following things today. Here’s an example:
Sí ¿Has comido algo? = (Have you eaten something?)
11.
_____ ¿Has leído el periódico?
12.
_____ ¿Has visitado un museo?

Going Back in Time with the Pluperfect
and the Preterit Perfect
In This Chapter
 Describing actions that happened before other past actions
 Conjugating haber in the imperfect and preterit tenses
 Adding a past participle to form the pluperfect and preterit perfect
 Distinguishing the difference between the pluperfect and the preterit perfect
B
ecause most people generally perceive time as a linear progression from one event to
the next, some past actions can be, well, more past than others. “After I had heard that
grasshoppers were a delicacy in Mexico,” for example, “I decided to try them.” In English,
the helping verb had is used along with the past participle of the main verb to form the past
perfect or pluperfect. Spanish includes two past-perfect tenses:
 Pluperfect is commonly used in conversation. The pluperfect is formed with the imper-
fect tense of the verb haber followed by the past participle of the main verb.
 Preterit perfect is commonly used in formal writing and literature. The preterit perfect is
formed with the preterit tense of the verb haber followed by the past participle of the
main verb.
In most cases, you’re going to use the pluperfect. You can pretty much ignore the preterit per-
fect, unless you’re reading or writing a novel in Spanish or presenting a formal paper. If you’re
studying Spanish primarily to converse, be sure to skip the parts on the preterit perfect.
Mastering the Bare-Bones Basics: 
Forming the Pluperfect Tense
To form the pluperfect tense, you start with the imperfect conjugation of the verb haber
and then tack on the past participle of the main verb. Fortunately, haber follows the rules of
regular -er verbs in the imperfect tense — dropping the inﬁnitive verb ending and then add
the endings -ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, and -ían. Following is the conjugation chart you need
to etch on your brain cells.
haber = (helping verb) to have
había
habíamos
habías
habíais
había
habían
Él habia vivido. = He had lived.

208
Part V: Getting Help with the Helping Verb Haber 
Coming up with the right conjugation of haber is just the ﬁrst step in forming your compound-
verb conjugation. You must then add the past participle of the verb whose action is being
described. See Chapter 18 for instructions on forming past participles.
Touching on the Preterit Perfect
Of the seven compound tenses, the preterit perfect is the one you’re likely to use least
often. It’s a strictly formal tense that may come in handy for your reading or composition
but won’t come up in conversation.
To form the preterit perfect, you begin with the preterit tense of the verb haber and then
add the past participle of the main verb. It just so happens that the preterit conjugations of
haber are irregular, so you need to memorize the following conjugation chart.
haber = (helping verb) to have
hube
hubimos
hubiste
hubisteis
hubo
hubieron
Él hubo vivido. = He had lived.
Don’t forget to add the past participle of the main verb. It must appear immediately follow-
ing the verb haber, as I explain in Chapter 18.
Here’s how the complete conjugation of the past participle of viajar looks:
haber viajado = to have traveled
he viajado
hubimos viajado
hubiste viajado
hubisteis viajado
hubo viajado 
hubieron viajado
Tú hubiste viajado. = You (familiar) have traveled.
Being in the Right Tense at the Right Time
As you’ve probably noticed, the pluperfect and preterit tenses in Spanish have identical
translations in English. Go ﬁgure! So what’s the difference? Why would you use one rather
than the other? Just as the imperfect and preterit tenses have subtle differences with regard
to the past, so do the pluperfect and preterit tenses. The differences in this case center less
on conceptual distinctions and more on the contexts in which they’re used:
 Pluperfect: The pluperfect is conversational and is used in everyday speech to
describe a past action that happened prior to another past action. The more recent
past action typically signals the end of the previous past action, as in the following
examples:
Nosotros habíamos terminado con la
= We had ﬁnished dinner before they 
cena antes de que ellos llegaron.
arrived.

Ella nos había llamado antes de visitar.
= She had called us before visiting.
Yo me había acostado después de mi
= I had gone to bed after my favorite 
programa favorito.
program.
 Preterit perfect: The preterit perfect is used primarily in formal or literary Spanish.
Here are some examples of the preterit perfect tense:
Una vez que hubimos visto toda la

Speaking of Lost Possibilities, 
the Future, and Probability
In This Chapter
 Completing an action in the future with the future perfect
 Explaining why an action wasn’t completed with the conditional perfect
 Picking the right tense — future perfect or conditional perfect
T
he compound tenses can be considered the perfect tenses in the sense that they express
completed actions. But how can an action be completed if it occurs in the future tense
or only if a pre-existing condition occurs? This chapter answers those questions by intro-
ducing the following two compound tenses:
 Future perfect: With the future perfect, you combine the future tense of the verb haber
with the past participle of the main verb to express actions that will have happened.
 Conditional perfect: With the conditional perfect, you combine the conditional tense
of the verb haber with the past participle of the main verb to express actions that
would have happened if the speciﬁed condition existed.
To form any of the compound tenses, you begin with the verb haber in the desired tense
and follow it with the past participle of the main verb. This chapter provides instructions on
how to conjugate haber in the future and conditional tenses. Refer to Chapter 18 for instruc-
tions and exercises on forming the past participles for regular and irregular verbs.
Making the Future Perfect
The future perfect tense enables you to describe actions in the future that you are almost
entirely sure will happen. Of course, you can never really be sure that a future action has
been completed.
To form the future perfect, you follow the same two steps you take to form any of the com-
pound tenses:
1. Begin with the verb haber in the appropriate tense (in this case, future tense).
2. Add the past participle of the main verb.
The only curve here is that the helping verb haber is formed irregularly in the future tense.
You start with the irregular verb stem habr and add the regular future verb endings, as
shown in the chart that follows.

216

Future verb endings for -ar, -er, and -ir verbs:

The following chart shows the conjugation for the verb haber in the future tense.
haber = (helping verb) to have
habré
habremos
habrás
habréis
habrá
habrán
Nosotros habremos vivido aquí 10 años este diciembre. = 
We will have lived here 10 years this December.
Here’s how you use the helping verb haber and the past participle to create the future per-
fect tense.
haber terminado = to have ﬁnished
habré terminado
habremos terminado
habrás terminado
habréis terminado
habrá terminado
habrán terminado
Yo habré terminado el proyecto antes de salir de vacación. = 
I will have ﬁnished the project before leaving for vacation.

Making Excuses with the Conditional Perfect
The conditional perfect is a tense you can’t live without. It enables you to provide excuses
for actions that would have taken place if certain conditions had existed. “I would have
arrived on time,” for example, “if my car wasn’t being repaired.”
Forming the conditional perfect is similar to the process you follow for forming the future-
perfect tense. You begin with the verb haber in the desired tense (in this case, the condi-
tional tense) and then add the past participle of the main verb. To form both the future and
conditional tenses of the verb haber, you begin with the irregular verb stem habr and then
add the required verb endings. The following chart provides the verb endings for the condi-
tional tense.
Conditional verb endings for -ar, -er, and -ir verbs:
yo –ía
nosotros/as -íamos
tú –ías

Decisions, Decisions: Future Perfect 
or Conditional Perfect?
Conceptually speaking, the future and conditional perfect tenses are similar — each tense
expresses completed action in a future time. The similarities end there, however, because
the future tense expresses action that’s almost sure to be completed in the future, whereas
the conditional perfect carries a great deal of doubt concerning the outcome. The following
sections provide additional guidelines to help you distinguish between these two com-
pound tenses and choose the tense that best suits your needs.
Using the future perfect
The future perfect is packed with promise. Use it when the outcome is almost certain. This
tense lets you
 Express what will have happened by a given time in the future; for example:
Nosotros habremos terminado
= We will have ﬁnished by 2 p.m.
para las dos.
Ellos habrán llegado para este ﬁn = They will have arrived by this weekend.
de semana.
Use para to introduce the time expressions in these sentences.
 Express probability or conjecture (when a slight doubt exists) of a recent past action;
for example:
Ella lo habrá terminado.
= She’s probably ﬁnished it.
Ellos habrán llegado.
= They must have (probably have) arrived.
Translate the following sentences into Spanish. Here’s an example:

__________________________________________________________________________________
Using the conditional perfect
Use the conditional perfect to express an action that would have happened but didn’t. Such
sentences typically contain a dependent clause explaining why the action did not occur;
this is your excuse clause — the one that gets you out of trouble.
When forming the dependent clause, keep the following two rules in mind:
 When this dependent clause begins with but, the verb in that clause is in the indicative
(Chapter 12).
 When dependent clause begins with if, the verb in the clause is in the imperfect sub-
junctive (Chapter 13).
Following are a couple examples that show the conditional perfect at work in a real, live sen-
tence, complete with a dependent clause:
Nosotros habríamos ido, pero teníamos = We would have gone, but we had to work.
que trabajar.
Él habría hablado con ella, pero no 
= He would have talked with her, but he didn’t
entendía la situación.
understand the situation.
Note: Use the indicative after but in the dependent clause.

= They would have earned more money if 
hubieran trabajado más horas.

called you on time.
Note: Use the imperfect subjunctive after if in the dependent clause.

T
he present perfect is perfect for describing actions that have happened. The subjunctive
mood describes actions that may happen. Roll the two together and you get the present
perfect subjunctive — a compound tense that describes actions that may have happened.
This chapter shows you how to form the present perfect subjunctive and provides plenty of
exercises to help you hone your skills. You also investigate how to put the present perfect
subjunctive to work in daily conversation and in writing.
Check out Chapter 12 for details about forming and using the present subjunctive.
Meeting the Present Perfect 
Subjunctive Face to Face
Like the other compound tenses, you form the present perfect subjunctive by taking the fol-
lowing two steps:
1. Begin with the verb haber conjugated in the appropriate tense (in this case, present
subjunctive).
2. Add the past participle of the main verb. (See Chapter 18 for instructions on how to
form past participles.)
The following chart shows the verb haber conjugated in the present perfect.
haber = (helping verb) to have
haya
hayamos
hayas
hayáis
haya
hayan
Espero que ellos hayan terminado su trabajo a tiempo. = 
I hope that they have ﬁnished their work on time.

Mobilizing the Present Perfect Subjunctive
The subtle distinctions among different tenses can make deciding which tense to use tough
for you. A case in point is the distinction between the present subjunctive and the present
perfect subjunctive. The following guidelines should help you decide which tense is most
appropriate:
 When the main clause of your sentence expresses doubt or desire in the present or
present-perfect tense (when something has happened), use the subjunctive in the sub-
ordinate clause, as I discuss in Chapter 12.
Here’s an example:
Yo no supongo que tú leas los mismos = I don’t suppose that you (might) read the 
libros que yo.
same books as I.
 When the subordinate clause refers to an action that may have taken place, use 
the present perfect subjunctive in the subordinate clause, as shown in the following
examples.
El profesor duda que todos los 
= The teacher doubts that all of the students 
estudiantes hayan hecho la tarea.
have done the homework.
Los padres preﬁeren que sus niños 
= Parents prefer that their children have 
hayan comido comida saludable.
eaten healthful food.
Es posible que nosotros hayamos 
= It’s possible that we may have arrived late.
llegado tarde.

Expressing Doubts about the Past 
with the Pluperfect Subjunctive
In This Chapter
 Believing or expecting that something had happened
 Forming the pluperfect subjunctive with a little help from haber
 Knowing when to use the pluperfect subjunctive
H
ave you ever hoped or expected that something had happened? If so, you probably
hoped or expected in the pluperfect subjunctive and probably didn’t even realize you
were doing it. In English, you don’t really use the pluperfect subjunctive, but you use some-
thing similar to it in sentences like this one:
I wished that I had slept before the party.
The main clause I wished is in the past tense, and what I wished for — that I had slept before
the party — is in the pluperfect, which also is called the past perfect tense. And because
what I wished for didn’t happen, it’s subjunctive.
Before you get into the various uses of the pluperfect subjunctive, however, you need to
ﬁnd out how to form it. That’s the subject of the following section.
Getting Your Feet Wet with 
the Pluperfect Subjunctive
Like other compound tenses, you form the pluperfect subjunctive by taking the following
two steps:
1. Begin with the verb haber conjugated in the appropriate tense (in this case, imperfect
subjunctive).
2. Add the past participle of the main verb. (See Chapter 18 for instructions on how to
form past participles.)
The chart that follows shows the verb haber conjugated in the imperfect tense.
As I explain in Chapter 13, the imperfect subjunctive has two possible sets of endings. The
following chart shows the most commonly used endings. The rule for conjugating a verb
into its imperfect subjunctive form is to take the third person plural form of the verb, drop
the -ron, and add the following endings:

232
Part V: Getting Help with the Helping Verb Haber 
yo -ra
nosotros/as -ramos
tú -ras
vosotros/as -rais
él, ella -ra
ellos/as -ran
Ud.
Uds.
Following this rule, the conjugation of the verb haber into the imperfect subjunctive is
shown in the following chart.
haber = (helping verb) to have
hubiera
hubiéramos
hubieras
hubierais
hubiera
hubieran
Yo deseaba que hubiera dormido antes de la ﬁesta. = I wished that I had slept before the party.
Notice that the ﬁrst person singular (yo) and the third person singular (él, ella, Ud.) forms
of this conjugation are the same, the same as in the present perfect subjunctive.
haber comido= to have eaten
hubiera comido
hubieramos comido
hubieras comido
hubierais comido 
hubiera comido
hubieran comido
Ellos creían que nosotros hubieramos comido antes de llegar. = 
They believed (thought) that we had eaten before arriving.
Translate the following compound-verb structures into the Spanish pluperfect subjunctive.
Here’s an example:
she had written = ella hubiera escrito
1.
we had gone = _______________
2. I had judged = _______________
3.

8.

10.

Diving in with the Pluperfect Subjunctive
The pluperfect subjunctive expresses the same time frame as the pluperfect; that is, it
expresses a past action that is more past than another past action. The difference is that the
pluperfect subjunctive is used in sentences with a main clause that requires the use of the
subjunctive mood in the subordinate clause.
The following sentences reveal the difference between the pluperfect indicative and the plu-
perfect subjunctive:
 Pluperfect Indicative
Yo creía que ellos habían llegado a 
= I believed that they had arrived on 
tiempo.
time.
Note that this sentence is a statement of fact.
 Pluperfect Subjunctive
Yo dudaba que ella hubiera llamado. = I doubted that she had called.
Note that this sentence expresses doubt, so it uses the subjunctive.
For basic information about the subjunctive mood, check out Chapter 12.
Another subtle distinction you need to be able to make is between the present perfect sub-
junctive (see Chapter 21) and the pluperfect subjunctive. Both constructions begin with a
main clause and call for the subjunctive in the subordinate clause. The present perfect sub-
junctive, however, refers to actions that may have happened, whereas the pluperfect sub-
junctive references an action in the subordinate clause that possibly had happened.
The following sentences help distinguish between present perfect and the pluperfect 
subjunctives:
 Present Perfect Subjunctive
Es importante que los estudiantes 
= It is important that the students have 
hayan leído la lección.
read the lesson.
 Pluperfect Subjunctive:
Yo no creía que él hubiera robado 
= I didn’t believe that he had robbed 
la tienda.
the store.
Note that both of these sentences are in the subjunctive mood. Only the tense is changed.
Translate the following sentence into Spanish, as I show in the following example:
I didn’t believe that she had brought enough money.
Yo no creía que ella hubiera traído suﬁciente dinero.

S
pecial occasions, by their very nature, are action-packed events — the perfect occa-
sions to hone your verbal skills. In this chapter, I show you ten of the most common
and enjoyable verbs and tell you about the traditional celebrations during which you may
want to use them.
Bailar = To Dance
Siempre bailamos cuando celebramos.
= We always dance when we are 
celebrating.
What fun is a celebration without dancing? The Mexican Hat Dance is one of the most famous
dances in the world. What better partner could you choose than a hat that never gets tired
and never misses a step? For the Mexican Hat Dance, you must use a tall hat with a wide
brim. You put the hat on the ﬂoor, and a man and a woman dance around it. The man tries to
catch the woman by chasing her around the hat. In the end the woman picks up the hat and
puts it on, which signals that now the man can catch the woman and dance with her.
Bailar is a regular -ar  verb. See Chapter 2 for details about how to conjugate it.
Cantar = To Sing
Yo canto en el coro de la iglesia.
= I sing in the church choir.
Christmas continues to be an extremely religious celebration in South America. Most people
set up decorations with an elaborate manger, and they’re sure to attend the Midnight
Christmas Eve Mass. After the Mass, people ﬁll the streets to wish friends and family good-
will and to sing carols together.
Cantar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).

244
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Cocinar = To Cook
Mi madre siempre cocina algo especial para = My mother always cooks something 
mi cumpleaños.
special for my birthday.
Much special cooking is done for the different holidays celebrated in the Spanish-speaking
countries. One such holiday celebrated in Spain is St. John’s Day, which falls on June 24. If
your name is John (or Juan in Spanish) then this day is your special day, and your family
will bake you a big cake in the shape of the letter J.
Cocinar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Cumplir = To Complete, To Turn 
(So Many Years Old)
Este añi él va a cumplir 10 años.
= This year he will complete 10 years.
In Spanish-speaking countries, people don’t ask “How old are you?” They say “How many
years do you have?” or “How many years have you completed?” People wish one another 
a happy birthday by saying Feliz Cumpleaños, which literally translates as “Happy
Completed Years.” Strange but true.
Cumplir is a regular -ir verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Desfilar = To Parade
Ahora ellos desﬁlan en la calle.
= Now they are parading in the street.
Desﬁles, or parades, are common to many holidays around the world, and the Spanish-
speaking countries are no exception. As a matter of fact, given their elaborate public dis-
plays of color and merry-making, you might say that they’re masters at it. One Spanish
holiday that features a parade is Assumption Day or Día de la Asunción. This day celebrates
the body of Mary rising to heaven to be united with her soul in heaven. Many statues of
Mary adorned with ﬂowers and colorful ribbons are paraded through the streets.
Desﬁlar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Pedir Prestado = To Borrow
Ella siempre pide prestado dinero para 
= She always borrows money for 
algo.
something.
April Fool’s Day is celebrated in Mexico but in a slightly different way. Instead of playing
little tricks, people attempt to borrow items from others. If anyone is foolish enough to lend

something on this of all days, the items borrowed are not returned. Instead the borrower
sends the lender a poem to say that he or she has been fooled.
Pedir prestado is an”e to i” stem-changing verb (see Chapter 8 for more about how to con-
jugate it).
Regalar = To Give a Gift
Mis padres me regalaron un carro nuevo
= My parents gave me a new car when I 
cuando me gradué.
graduated.
El Día de los Tres Reyes, literally “The Day of the Three Kings,” also called “Epiphany,” 
is celebrated on January 6. This day is to celebrate the coming of the Three Wise Men to
Bethlehem. On this day, children leave their shoes out to be ﬁlled with goodies by the Magi.
The wise man named Balthazar is the favorite of the children, because he brings them gifts
and candy called turrón.
Regalar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Rezar = To Pray
Nosotros rezamos cada día.
= We pray every day.
Much praying is done during the season of Lent while worshippers strengthen their faith in
God through repentance and meditation. The Lenten season lasts 40 days and leads to the
celebration of the risen Christ at Easter. The 40 days may symbolize the 40 days that Moses
spent on Mount Sinai, the 40 years that the Jewish people were wandering, the 40 days that
Jesus spent in the desert, or the 40 hours that Jesus was in the tomb. A modern Lenten
custom is the World Day of Prayer, which is a day when Christians all around the world pray
that Christ’s will be done and that His peace may come to earth.
Rezar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Tirar Agua = To Throw Water
Ellos tiran agua durante el carnival en unos = They throw water during “Carnival” in 
países de latinoamérica.
some countries in Latin America.
Part of Carnival in some Spanish-speaking countries is water throwing. People throw water
from rooftops and balconies on innocent passers by. Young men go to the houses of their
girlfriends where a battle ensues during which they try to throw each other into a fountain,
bathtub (ﬁlled with water), or shower. In Catholic countries, carnivals are festive days
before the serious Lenten season begins. These days come to an end with the climax on
Shrove Tuesday. In the United States, we have a large Carnival celebrated in New Orleans,
called Mardi Gras.
Tirar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).

“Día de los Muertos.”
the “Day of the Dead.”
Another uniquely Hispanic custom is the celebration of the Día de los Muertos or The Day
of the Dead, celebrated November 2. Also known as All Soul’s Day, this holiday is the equiva-
lent of Halloween  (October 31), which is actually All Hallow’s Eve or the eve of All Saint’s
Day on November 1. Hispanic people celebrate this day to honor loved ones who have
passed away. A common practice is to take a picnic to the cemetery to visit the graves of
the deceased. It is important to remember to bring all of the favorite foods of the family
member who has passed on, because it is believed that on this day they are allowed to
return to earth to celebrate and eat with their loved ones.
Visitar is a regular -ar verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it). 
Ir is an irregular verb (see Chapter 5 for more about how to conjugate it).
Comer Mazapán = To Eat Marzipan
Cuando estoy en España siempre como = When I am in Spain I always eat
mazapán.
marzipan.
Of the variety of sweets available in Spain at Christmas time, none is molded more artisti-
cally than mazapán (or marzipan), which came to Spain from the Arabians, who ruled Spain
for nearly eight centuries. Marzipan is a delicacy made of crushed almonds with sugar and
eggs mixed in. The ancient city of Toledo in Spain is the marzipan capital.
Comer is a regular -er verb (see Chapter 2 for more about how to conjugate it).
Comer Uvas = To Eat Grapes
Cuando se celebra “El Año Nuevo” en = When the New Year is celebrated in 
España, es tradicional comer 12 uvas Spain, it is traditional to eat 12 grapes 
cuando es medíanoche.
at midnight. 
In all cultures, eating usually is an integral part of any holiday, but Spain has a New Year’s
Eve custom that involves eating, not for the taste and satisfaction, but for good luck. At the
stroke of midnight, revelers are supposed to eat 12 grapes, one at each strike of the hour.
Everyone pops one grape at each strike of the clock and gives New Year’s wishes to friends
and family. The eating of the 12 grapes is to ensure that the coming year will have 12 happy
months. Of course, it’s best to try to get the seedless variety!

Questions about Spanish

 Listing differences in tense, mood, and mode
 Recognizing a diphthong when you meet one
W
hen you learn a ﬁrst language, you don’t need to conceptualize the structures or use
your intellect to understand grammar and usage. All that technical stuff is internal-
ized as you gain more and more knowledge of the language. It becomes second-nature. You
develop a mental schemata for structure and grammar in your brain, as you develop from a
babbling baby into an eloquent adult. Some people are extremely fortunate and are taught
two, three, or even more languages from birth. When that happens, the brain makes
allowances for all of the different mental schemata for each of the languages.
When you’re learning a second language later in life, however, the existing schemata are so
well entrenched that your brain must work overtime to make the necessary adjustments.
You almost have to unlearn one way before you can learn the new way. Not only are there
thousands of new vocabulary words to memorize, but you have to integrate the new and
complex grammatical structures and conﬁgurations into your already spinning head.
In an attempt to help sort out some of the most unusual or difﬁcult of these concepts, this
chapter presents what I consider to be ten of the most common difﬁculties that people have
when learning Spanish grammar and usage.
What’s the difference between por and para?
The Spanish language includes a few utility words that change meaning depending on the
context. Two such words, por and para, are easy to confuse, especially for those who 
are learning Spanish for the ﬁrst time. The following guidelines help alleviate some of the
confusion:
Por is used for the following:
 To describe a means of transportation
por avión = by plane.
 To perform multiplication
dos por tres son seis = two times three equals six

248
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 To do something for someone
Lo hice por ella. = I did it for her.
 To express a length of time
Juan estuvo en francía por tres días. = Juan was in France for three days.
 As the preposition through
Viajamos por tres estados. We traveled through three states.
Para is used for the following:
 To express purpose as in order to or for
Ella trabaja para ganar dinero. = She works to earn money.
Yo trabajo para el Sr. Gonzalez. = I work for Mr. Gonzalez.
 As the preposition to
Ellos van para California. = They are going to California.
Para mi sorpresa él llegó temprano. = To my surprise, he arrived early.
 As the preposition by
Debe estar listo para las dos. = It should be ready by 2 p.m.
What’s the difference between ser and estar?
The verbs ser and estar both mean to be, but being is a concept that varies depending on its
context (check out Chapter 7 for a detailed explanation of ser and estar). Here is some addi-
tional guidance that can help you make the correct choice.
Ser is used for the following:
 To state one’s origin, or where a person is from
Él es de México. = He is from Mexico.
 To describe the qualities of a person, place, or thing
Juan Luís es muy inteligente. = Juan Luís is very intelligent.
Su casa es muy grande.= Their house is very large.
 To state one’s profession
Mi papá era abogado. = My father was a lawyer.
Estar is used for the following:
 To specify the location of a person, place, or thing
Yo estoy en la biblioteca. = I am at the library.
 To describe one’s condition or feelings
Él está enfermo. = He is sick.
Ellos están muy contentos. = They are very happy.
 To state the condition of a place or a thing
La puerta está abierta. = The door is open.
El centro comercial está cerrado los ﬁnes de semana. = The mall is closed on weekends.

 To form the present progressive
Marisol está estudiando ahora. = Marisol is studying now.
 To form the past progressive
Ellos estaban saliendo cuando él llegó. = They were leaving when he arrived.
What’s the difference between 
tener que and deber?
The difference between tener que and deber generally boils down to the difference between
being compelled to do something and feeling morally obligated to perform the task. Tener que
plus an inﬁnitive means that someone has to do whatever the verb inﬁnitive states — you
only have to die and pay taxes. On the other hand deber has the implication of moral obliga-
tion, as in this is what one should or ought to do.” For example:
Tú tienes que pagar el impuesto.
= You have to pay the tax.
Tú debes ayudar a los que necesitan 
= You should (ought to) help those in need.
ayuda.
What’s the difference between 
poner and ponerse?
The verbs poner and ponerse look like identical twins and sound even more alike, but they
actually are quite different. Poner is to put or place something somewhere, or to turn something
on, such as a light or a TV. Whereas ponerse means to become, to put on (clothing), or to set
(as in the setting sun). The following examples help illustrate the distinction between the two:
Yo puse el libro en el escritorio.
= I put the book on the desk.

house.
Él se puso médico.
= He became a doctor.

uniformes.

= The sun sets earlier in the winter.
invierno.
What’s the difference between a 
verb tense and a mood or mode?
The tense of a verb tells the time of an action or state; for example, past, present or future,
as in the following examples:
Yo estudio mucho.
= I study a lot.
Yo estudié ayer.
= I studied yesterday.
Yo estudiaré mañana.
= I will study tomorrow.

Chapter 25: Answers to the Ten Most Common Questions about Spanish

The mood or mode of a verb is a reﬂection of the subject’s attitude toward what the verb
expresses. The main moods in Spanish are the imperative (or commands), the indicative
(statements of fact), and the subjunctive (basically subjective — wishes, suppositions,
doubts, and so on).
What’s the difference between 
tú and usted (Ud.)?
Both tú and usted (Ud.) are subject pronouns that mean you (singular). The difference is to
whom you’re speaking. The pronoun tú is the familiar or informal you, because it’s used
when speaking to a friend or family member. On the other hand, when you want to be more
respectful or when you don’t know someone well, you use usted (Ud.), which is referred to
as the formal you.
What’s the difference between 
vosotros and ustedes (Uds.)?
The pronouns vosotros and ustedes (Uds.) follow the same usage rules as tú and usted and
represent their plural equivalents. Vosotros is you (plural, familiar or informal) and is used
with friends and family members, whereas ustedes (Uds.) is you (plural, formal) and is used
in more formal or respectful conversation. Vosotros is used primarily; in Spain, and in Latin
America, the ustedes form is often used for both the informal and formal you.
How do you form a negative statement?
To form a negative statement in Spanish, simply add a no in front of the verb and any direct,
indirect, or reﬂexive pronouns (if there are any). The following examples show you what 
to do:
Él no tiene mi anillo.
= He doesn’t have my ring.
Él no lo tiene.
= He doesn’t have it.
How do you pluralize in Spanish?
Three very simple rules apply when you want to form the plurals of nouns and adjectives in
Spanish. The following chart explains what they are:
If the word ends in . . . 
add . . . 
a vowel
s
a consonant
es
a z
change the z to a c, and add es

What in the world is a diphthong?
In Spanish diphthongs are called diptongos — a sequence of two vowels that glide together
and count as a single sound. Look for the italics in the following examples to see diptongos
in action:
agua (ah-gwah)
= water
caimán (ky-mahn)
= alligator

I
n every language, including English, a particular action can have 20 or more words to
describe it, and each word can have a slightly different meaning. You can, for example,
call someone — or summon or phone or beckon or contact or subpoena or . . . you get the
idea. 
In your native tongue, the slight variations in meaning become second nature, but when
you’re learning a new language, and you’re looking up meanings of words in a dictionary,
the subtle nuances are easy to miss. This chapter presents the ten most commonly misused
verbs in the Spanish language, explains their correct usage, and provides examples to clar-
ify their differences. 
To Ask or to Ask For
Use preguntó only for asking questions. As I show you in the following examples:
Yo pregunté a la profesora, “¿Cuántos 
= I asked the teacher, “How old are you?”
años tiene usted?”
Ella siempre pregunta muchas preguntas = She always asks a lot of questions in 
en la clase de química.
chemistry class.
If you’re asking for, in the sense of ordering or requesting something, the use pedir, prop-
erly conjugated, of course. The following sentences show you what I mean:
Ellos pidieron unas pizzas para el 
= They ordered (requested, asked for) 
almuerzo.
some pizzas for lunch.
Él pidió las direcciones para nuestra 
= He asked for directions to our new 
casa nueva.
house.

254
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Having More Than Someone Else or Having
More Than a Specific Number
When you’re saying that you have more of a speciﬁc number of something, you use “más
de” plus the number of the things that you have more of, as I show you in the following
examples:
Él tiene más de veinte sombreros.
= He has more than twenty hats.
Ella ganó más de cien mil dólares.
= She won more than one hundred 
thousand dollars.
On the other hand, when you want to say that you have more of something than someone else
has or you like one thing more than another, then you use “más que,” as in these examples:
Nosotros tenemos más tierra que ellos.
= We have more land than they do.
A Rafael le gustan las frutas más que las
= Rafael likes fruit more than vegetables.
verduras.
Knowing Someone or Something
The verbs conocer and saber both mean “to know,” but they are used differently. The verb
conocer means to know or be familiar with a person, place or thing. The following sentences
show you the correct use of conocer:
Yo conozco a su madre.
= I know his mother.
Ellos conocen al director de la escuela.
= They know the principal of the school.
Susana conoce San Francisco.
= Susana knows (is familiar with) San
Francisco.
Mi esposo conoce muy bien la música de = My husband knows the music of Bob 
Bob Dylan.
Dylan very well.
The verb saber, on the other hand, means to know something, such as a fact, or how to do
something. The following sentences show you the right way to use saber:
Miguel sabe que ellos son de Chile.
= Miguel knows that they are from Chile.
Mi cuñado sabe volar un avión.
= My brother-in-law knows how to ﬂy an 
airplane.
Leaving Something or Just Plain Leaving 
The verbs salir and dejar both mean “to leave,” but you should use salir to express the
action of leaving a place, as the following examples illustrate: 
Ellos salieron del teatro temprano.
= They left the theater early.
El tren sale a las dos de la tarde.
= The train leaves at 2 p.m.

When you want to say that someone left something, use dejar instead, as I show you in the
following examples:
El hombre dejó una propina en la mesa.
= The man left a tip on the table.
Nosotros dejamos la maleta en casa.
= We left the suitcase at home.
Returning Something or Just Returning
Both regresar and devolver mean “to return,” but you use regresar to describe a situation
in which a person is returning. Here are some examples:
Él siempre regresa temprano de 
= He always returns early from vacation.
vacación.
Nuestros hijos regresaron tarde a casa 
= Our children returned home late last 
anoche.
night.
Use devolver when someone is returning an item, as I show you in the following example:
Marcela devolvió el vestido, porque era 
= Marcela returned the dress because it 
demasiado grande.
was too large.
Los estudiantes devolvieron los libros 
= The students returned the books to the 
a la biblioteca a tiempo.
library on time.
Spending Money or Time
The verbs gastar and sasar both mean “to spend,” but Spanish actually has two distinct
words to differentiate between “spending time” and “spending money.” Use gastar to spend
money (think of spending money on gas), as in the following example:
Ella siempre gasta mucho dinero en 
= She always spends a lot of money at 
Target.
Target.
Me gusta gastar dinero.
= I like spending money.
If you’re spending time, use pasar (think of passing the time), as in the following example: 
Cuando nosotros vamos a Florida, 
= When we go to Florida, we always spend 
siempre pasamos la mayoría del tiempo 
the majority of the time at the beach.
en la playa.
Ellos pasaron dos horas en el parque 
= They spent 2 hours in the park yesterday.
ayer.
Playing a Game, an Instrument, or a Role
Spanish has three verbs that translate as “to play”: jugar, tocar, and desempeñar, but their
meanings are far from identical. 
255
Chapter 26: Avoiding Ten Common Spanish Verbs Mix-ups

To say that you are playing a sport or a game, you use jugar, as in the following example:
Los muchachos juegan al fútbol todas 
= The boys play soccer every afternoon.
las tardes.
Mi padre jugó baloncesto mucho cuando = My father played basketball a lot when he 
era niño.
was a child.
To say that you are playing an instrument, use tocar, as the following example illustrates:
Juan toca el piano en la orquesta.
= Juan plays the piano in the orchestra.
Mi amigo siempre toca la guitarra y canta = My friend always plays the guitar and 
cuando nosotros tenemos una ﬁesta.
sings when we have a party.
Last but not least, if you want to say that you or someone is playing a role (as in a play), use
the verb desempeñar. Here are some examples:
Boris Karloff desempeñó la parte de 
= Boris Karloff played the part of 
Frankenstein en la película.
Frankenstein in the movie. 
Ella desempeña la parte de la heroína en = She plays the part of the heroine in my 
mi programa favorita.
favorite program.
To Wake up or to Get up
To wake up is despertarse. You use it like this:
Mi madre se despertó a las 8:00 de la 
= My mother woke up at 8:00 a.m. 
mañana ayer.
yesterday.
Ellos se despertaron tarde esta mañana, = They woke up late this morning, and 
y por eso llegaron tarde a la escuela.
therefore arrived late to school.
To physically, get up (out of the bed) is levantarse. It’s appropriate in sentences like these:
A Raquel le gusta levantarse tarde si no 
= Raquel likes to get up late if she doesn’t 
tiene nada que hacer.
have anything to do.
Nosotros nos levantamos a las 11:00 de 
= We got up at 11:00 a.m. last Saturday.
la mañana el sábado pasado.
So you can wake up at 7:00 a.m., but sooner or later you have to get up to actually go 
anywhere. Of course, if you’re prone to sleepwalking, you might levantarse before you 
despertarse.
To Leave or to Take Leave of
Salir is to physically leave from a place. You use it like this:
Mis padres salieron para el aeropuerto 
= My parents left for the airport at 4:00 p.m. 
a las 4:00 de la tarde hoy.
today.
Ellos salieron de la ﬁesta temprano.
= They left the party early.
256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Despedirse, on the other hand, means to take leave of, or to say “good-bye.” Here are some
examples:
Él siempre se despide cuando sale.
= He always says good-bye when he leaves.
Los estudiantes se despidieron a todos.
= The students said good-bye to everyone.
It Is Sunny vs. It Is Cloudy
When describing the weather in Spanish you usually use either the verb estar which means
“to be,” as in the following example:
Mañana estará nublado.
= Tomorrow it will be cloudy.
You might also use the verb hacer, which means “to make,” as the following example shows:
Hoy hace buen tiempo.
= Today it is nice (good) weather.
Why? Well, it comes down to the weather condition itself. Use hacer to describe weather
that has no action taking place:
Hace (mucho) sol.
= It’s (very) sunny.
Hace (mucho) calor.
= It’s (very) hot.
Hace (mucho) frío.
= It’s (very) cold.
Hace (muy) mal tiempo.
= It’s (very) bad weather.
Use estar to describe weather that has an action taking place:
Está nevando.
= It’s snowing.
Está lloviendo.
= It’s raining.

P
resent and past participles can come in handy, but the irregular present and past par-
ticiples often are difﬁcult to remember. To help keep them fresh in your mind, this
appendix provides a brief overview of common irregular present and past participles.
